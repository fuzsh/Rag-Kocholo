They are currently members of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference. Since 1991, the team has played its home games at the Delta Center.\n\nThe franchise began play as an expansion team in 1974 as the New Orleans Jazz (as a tribute to New Orleans' history of originating Jazz music). The Jazz moved to Salt Lake City in 1979.\n\nThe Jazz were one of the most unsuccessful teams in the league in their early years, and it would be 10 years before they made a playoff appearance (in 1984). They would not miss the playoffs again until 2004. During the late 1980s, John Stockton and Karl Malone arose as the franchise players for the team, and formed one of the most famed Point Guard–Power Forward duos in NBA history. Led by coach Jerry Sloan, who took over for Frank Layden in 1988, they became one of the powerhouse teams of the 1990s, culminating in two NBA Finals appearances in 1997 and 1998, where they lost both times in six games to the Chicago Bulls, led by Michael Jordan.\n\nBoth Stockton and Malone moved on in 2003. After missing the playoffs for three consecutive seasons, the Jazz returned to prominence under the on-court leadership of Point Guard Deron Williams. However, partway through the 2010-11 season, the Jazz began a restructuring after the retirement of Jerry Sloan and the trade of Williams to the New Jersey Nets.\n\nQuin Snyder was hired as head coach in June 2014. Under Snyder's leadership, the Jazz have experienced success. With the development of Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell into All–Stars, the Jazz launched themselves back into playoff contention, eventually earning the league's best regular season record in the 2020–21 season. However, following disappointing early playoff exits in both 2021 and 2022, the Jazz traded Mitchell and Gobert to the Cleveland Cavaliers and Minnesota Timberwolves, respectively, in the 2022 offseason and entered a new era of rebuilding centered around Lauri Markkanen, who became an All-Star in his first season with the Jazz after being acquired in the Mitchell trade.\n\nFranchise history[]\n\nEarly years in New Orleans[]\n\nIn 1974, the Jazz franchise began in New Orleans as the 18th team to enter the NBA. The team's first major move was to trade for star player Pete Maravich (who had played collegiately at LSU) from the Atlanta Hawks for two first-round draft picks, three second-round picks, and one third-round pick over the next three years.[1] Although he was considered one of the most entertaining players in the league and won the scoring championship in 1977 with 31.1 points per game, the Jazz' best record while in New Orleans was 39–43 in the 1977–78 season. Maravich struggled with knee injuries from that season onward.\n\nVenue issues were a continual problem for the team while on New Orleans. In the Jazz's first season, when they played in the Loyola University Fieldhouse, the basketball court was raised so high that the players' association made the team put a net around the court so that players wouldn't fall off of the court and into the stands.[2] Later, they played games in the Louisiana Superdome, but things were no better; due to high demand for the stadium, onerous lease terms and fucking Maravich's constant knee problems. They also faced the prospect of spending a whole month on the road each year due to Mardi Gras festivities.[1][3] Years later, founding owner Sam Battisone claimed that there was no contingency plan in case the Jazz ever made the playoffs. However, the Superdome's manager at the time, Bill Curl, said that the stadium's management always submitted a list of potential playoff dates to the Jazz management, but these letters were never answered.[4]\n\nAfter what turned out to be their final season in the Big Easy, the Jazz were dealt one final humiliation when the Los Angeles Lakers selected Magic Johnson with the first overall pick in the 1979 NBA Draft. The pick would have belonged to the Jazz had they not traded it to Los Angeles to acquire Gail Goodrich two years earlier. To make matters worse, the Jazz had given up the rights to Moses Malone in order to regain one of the three first-round picks used for the Goodrich trade; the combination of Magic and Moses becoming superstars and Goodrich's ineffective, injury-ruined few years in New Orleans made this one of the most lopsided transactions in NBA history.\n\n1979–84: Move to Utah; Foundation for success is built[]\n\nDespite being barely competitive, the Jazz drew fairly well during their first five years. However, by 1979 the franchise was sinking financially. Barry Mendelson, the team's executive vice president for most of the team's early years, said one factor in the team's financial troubles was an 11 percent amusement tax, the highest in the nation at the time. The team also couldn't attract much local corporate support—an important factor even in those days—or local investors.[4]\n\nBattisone concluded that the franchise could not be viable in New Orleans and decided to move elsewhere. After scouting out several new homes, he decided to move to Salt Lake City, even though it was a smaller market than New Orleans at the time. However, Salt Lake City had proven it could support a pro basketball team when it played host to the American Basketball Association's Utah Stars from 1970 to 1976. The Stars had been extremely popular in the city, but their financial picture inexplicably collapsed in their last two seasons, and they folded in December 1975 after playing only 16 games of the ABA's final season. Although Salt Lake City was not known for its jazz culture, the team decided to keep the name, as well as the team's original colors of green, purple and gold (the colors of Mardi Gras). Some were offended by the Jazz keeping the franchise name after moving from New Orleans, citing it as a metaphor for the theft of Jazz from its cultural roots.\n\nThe Jazz's attendance actually declined slightly after the team's move from New Orleans to Utah, due to a late approval for the move (June 1979) and poor marketing in the Salt Lake City area.[5][6] The team's management made the first of several moves in 1979, bringing high-scoring forward Adrian Dantley to Utah in exchange for Spencer Haywood. Dantley averaged 28.0 points per game during the 1979-80 season, allowing the team to waive Pete Maravich early in the year. The team struggled to a 24-58 mark, but was rewarded with the 2nd overall pick in the 1980 NBA Draft, which they used to pick Darrell Griffith of Louisville, another piece of the rebuilding puzzle.\n\nDuring the 1980-81 NBA Season, the club struggled financially as well as on the court. Despite having perennial All-Star Dantley, a 20 point per game scorer in Griffith; as well as emerging point guard Rickey Green, the Jazz were unable to produce a winning team, going 28-54.\n\nTom Nissalke departed as coach after the team started the 1981-82 season with an 8-12 record, and General Manager Frank Layden replaced him. Layden's coaching wasn't an improvement initially, as the Jazz went 17-45 the rest of that season to finish 25-57.\n\nThe 1982 NBA Draft saw the Jazz pick forward Dominique Wilkins, who was reluctant to play for them. Combined with the cash-strapped ownership, this produced another trade to improve cash flow - Atlanta gave up guards John Drew and Freeman Williams, plus $1 million in cash, for the rights to Wilkins.\n\nFor the 1982-83 season, Dantley ended up missing 60 of 82 games due to injury, depriving the team of its leading scorer for much of the season. Newcomer John Drew also missed time, playing in only 44 games. The Jazz ended up being led by Darrell Griffith (22.2 ppg), Rickey Green (14.3 ppg), and Danny Schayes (12.4 ppg). A rookie 7'4\" center, Mark Eaton, began manning the post as well. The team finished 30-52, still out of the playoffs, but an improvement over recent years.\n\nDuring the 1983 NBA Draft, the Jazz used their first-round pick, #7 overall, to choose Thurl Bailey, of the 1983 NCAA Champion North Carolina State University Wolfpack, and later took Bobby Hansen of the University of Iowa, in the third round, 54th overall.\n\n1983-84 opened as a season of uncertainty. The team was losing money, and management was crafting stunts, such as playing games in Las Vegas, to help the team be more profitable.[7] The team was rumored to be moving from Utah also, due to the small market and ownership's struggles financially. However, the team's fortunes on the court continued to improve, with a healthy Adrian Dantley, Jeff Wilkins, and rookie Thurl Bailey at the forward positions, Mark Eaton & Rich Kelley jointly manning the post, and Rickey Green with Darrell Griffith at the guards, and John Drew providing 17 points per night off the bench. The team went 45-37 and won the Midwest Division, their first division title in team history.\n\nThey advanced to the NBA Playoffs, defeating the Denver Nuggets 3-2 in the first round, and moved on to play the Phoenix Suns in the second round. Despite having homecourt in the best of seven series, the Jazz lost to the more experienced Suns, 4-2.\n\n1984–2003: The Stockton/Malone era[]\n\nJazz fans were not happy a month later, when the team picked an unknown point guard in the 1st round of the NBA Draft, John Stockton of Gonzaga. The Jazz fans on hand for the draft party booed the selection.[8]\n\nThe 1984-85 season saw the emergence of Mark Eaton as a defensive force. averaging 5.56 blocks per game along with 9.7 points and 11.3 rebounds per game, winning the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. On the downside, John Drew played only 19 games on the season, depriving the team of their high-scoring sixth man. Despite that, the Jazz returned to the playoffs, facing off with the Houston Rockets and their All-Star Centers, Hakeem Olajuwon and Ralph Sampson. The Jazz prevailed in the series, 3-2, advancing to the second round to face the high-scoring Denver Nuggets. Utah fell to Denver, 4-1 in the second-round series.\n\nThe team's perennial financial woes and instability were somewhat stabilized during April 1985, when Larry H. Miller bought 50% of the team for $8 million, and became a co-owner with Sam Battistone, who had been seeking to move the team.[9] In the 1985 NBA Draft the team added Karl Malone from Louisiana Tech, a 6'9\" 250 pound power forward.\n\nMalone made an immediate impact in the 1985–86 season, averaging 14.9 points and 8.9 rebounds per outing, supplementing Dantley in the frontcourt. However, starting guard Darrell Griffith missed the entire season with a stress fracture, and the team hovered around the .500 mark most of the year. In the 1985-86 postseason, the Jazz faltered in the first round against the Dallas Mavericks, losing the series 3–1.\n\nDuring the offseason in 1986, co-owner Sam Battistone was approached to sell the team to Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner, who would have moved the team to Minneapolis, Minnesota. Larry Miller didn't want to sell the team, but due to contractual language in his agreement with Battistone, could have been bought out by the new owners if he refused to sell. Offers went as high as $28 million for the team as a whole during this process (the Jazz were valued at $16 million less than a year earlier when Miller purchased half for $8 million). Miller stepped in at the last minute and purchased the remaining 50% of the team for $14 million, buying out the original contract with Battistone, and kept the team in Utah.[10] Wolfenson and Ratner later became the founders of the Minnesota Timberwolves expansion franchise which, coincidentally, was almost sold and moved to New Orleans in 1994.\n\nThe 1986–87 season was one of change. Adrian Dantley, the team's star player that had carried them through the early years in Utah, was traded to Detroit for Kelly Tripucka, who ended up splitting time with Thurl Bailey. Darrell Griffith, back from injuries that caused him to miss the 1985-86 season, lost his starting spot at guard to Bobby Hansen. John Stockton was warranting more time behind, and in front of, Rickey Green at the point guard position. Amidst all these changes, the team went 44-38 on the season, and lost to the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nFor the 1987-88 Season, John Stockton took over for Rickey Green as the starting point guard, and Karl Malone began establishing himself as one of the better power forwards in the league. That year, the team finished 47-35 and defeated Portland, 3–1, in the first round, earning a second round matchup with the defending NBA Champion Los Angeles Lakers. After LA took Game 1 at home, the Jazz surprised the Lakers by winning Game 2 in LA, 101–97, and took the lead in the series 2–1 with a Game 3 win in Salt Lake City. The Jazz lost Games 4 and 5, but fought back to demolish the Lakers in Game 6, 108-80, tying the series 3-3. In the deciding Game 7, the Lakers prevailed, 109–98. But the Jazz had shown they were no longer the pushover of their early days.\n\n1988–1990: Arrival of Jerry Sloan[]\n\nDuring the 1988–89 season, Frank Layden stepped down as head coach of the Jazz after the first 17 games of the season, and was replaced by Jerry Sloan. The Jazz won 51 games and the Midwest Division title as the team grew better overall. Malone and Stockton, as well as Mark Eaton, were All-Stars. Eaton won Defensive Player of the Year for the second time, and it appeared the Jazz were ready to take the next step in the post-season, after having pushed the Los Angeles Lakers to seven games in the 2nd round the previous year. However, in a playoff upset, the #7 seeded Golden State Warriors defeated the #2 seeded Jazz, 3 games to 0, in the first round, ending the Jazz's season abruptly.\n\nIn the following year, 1989–90, the Jazz made some changes, with Bobby Hansen supplanting Darrell Griffith as the starting guard alongside Stockton. Also Thurl Bailey, relied on for 19 points per game the previous year, had his role reduced somewhat, as rookie forward–guard Blue Edwards played a prominent role in the front court. Mike Brown, a backup forward–center, spelled Mark Eaton more frequently. The results were the best win–loss mark in team history, with the Jazz going 55–27 and finishing second in the division to the San Antonio Spurs (56–26). Karl Malone had his best season statistically, averaging 31.0 points and 11.1 rebounds. John Stockton averaged 17.2 points and 14.5 assists per outing, both career highs, with the assist total and average leading the NBA that year. In the playoffs, they were matched up with the Phoenix Suns, led by All-Stars Tom Chambers and Kevin Johnson. Phoenix defeated the Jazz 3–2 in the first round. Once again, the Jazz were left with questions as to how they could do so well in the regular season but fail to advance in the playoffs. [11]\n\n1990–1996: Working towards championship contention[]\n\nFor the 1990–91 season, the Jazz made another move to improve the team, with a three-way trade being made. Shooting Guard Jeff Malone was brought to Utah from the Washington Bullets, while Eric Leckner and Bobby Hansen were sent from Utah to the Sacramento Kings, and Pervis Ellison ended up going from Sacramento to Washington.[12]\n\nThe Jazz began the season 22-15, then found their stride, going 27-8 during January and February, with new addition Jeff Malone averaging 18.6 points that year, giving the Jazz three strong scoring options (Karl Malone, Jeff Malone, and John Stockton – 64.8 of the team's 104 points per game). The Jazz finished 54-28, 2nd in the division to San Antonio by 1 game, similar to their division finish the prior year. In the playoffs, they met the Phoenix Suns for the second year in a row, but this time the Jazz were ready. Game 1 was a blowout in Utah's favor, on Phoenix's home floor, 129-90, setting the tone for the series, as Utah eliminated the Suns 3-1, earning a second round match-up with the Portland Trail Blazers, the defending Western Conference Champions. [13] The Jazz played well, keeping close in most of the games, but ultimately lost the series 4–1 to the deeper and more experienced Blazers.\n\nThe 1991-92 season proved to be the most successful in history, to that time, for the Jazz. They moved to a newly built home, the Delta Center, a state-of-the art arena that seated 19,911 fans. This was a huge improvement over the Salt Palace, which seated just over 12,000 and lacked luxury suites and retail space. Early in the year, a trade brought Tyrone Corbin, a tough, defensive forward, from Minnesota in exchange for fan-favorite Thurl Bailey.\n\nThe Jazz went 55-27 over the season, winning the Midwest Division Title for the first time since 1989, and looked to advance farther in the postseason. In the playoffs, the Jazz defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 3-2 in the first round, then took care of the Seattle SuperSonics in the second round, 4-1, advancing to the Western Conference Finals for the first time, where they faced the Portland Trail Blazers. Once again, Portland proved to be the superior team, defeating the Jazz 4-2 in the series and denying them a trip to the NBA Finals.\n\nThe 1992-93 season proved to be a disappointment compared with the years before, with a 47-35 mark and 3rd place in the division. The center position, manned capably by Mark Eaton for most of the past decade, became suspect as Eaton struggled with injuries and age. The bright spot was the hosting of the All-Star Game and the surrounding events of All-Star Weekend.[14] The Jazz had a disappointing run in the playoffs as well, losing to the Seattle SuperSonics in the first round, 3-2. [13] During the postseason, the team addressed the center position by acquiring 7'0\" Felton Spencer from Minnesota, in return for backup center Mike Brown.\n\nDuring the 1993–94 season, the Jazz traded Jeff Malone to the Philadelphia 76ers for shooting guard Jeff Hornacek. Hornacek meshed well with Stockton, and the Jazz improved to a 53–29 record for the year. In the playoffs, they faced San Antonio in the first round, shutting down NBA scoring leader David Robinson in the series. Robinson had averaged 29.8 points on 50% shooting during the regular season, numbers that dropped to 20.0 and 41% against Utah.[15] The Jazz then fought off a determined Denver Nuggets team 4–3 in the conference semi-finals (almost blowing a 3–0 series lead in the process), to advance to the Western Conference Finals, where they lost to the eventual NBA champion Houston Rockets 4–1.\n\nIn the 1994–95 season, the Jazz had significant depth and talent at their disposal and were expected to make a serious run for the championship. However, they lost starting center Felton Spencer 34 games into the season with a ruptured Achilles Tendon. The Jazz were deep enough to still finish with a 60–22 record. However, the Jazz lost to the Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs, 3-2.\n\nBig man Greg Ostertag was added to the team for the 1995–96 season. The Jazz went 55-27, and reached the conference finals for the third time in history, nearly overcoming a 3–1 series deficit, but eventually losing to the Seattle SuperSonics 4–3.\n\n1996–1998: Reaching the NBA Finals[]\n\nIn the next two seasons, the Jazz were finally able to capitalize on their regular season success. In 1996–97, the Jazz had their best record in franchise history at 64–18, winning the Midwest Division and finishing with the best overall record in the Western Conference. The team was made up of the mainstays, Stockton, Malone, and Hornacek, as well as Bryon Russell, Antoine Carr, Howard Eisley, and Shandon Anderson. Malone won his first NBA MVP for the 1996-97 regular season, averaging 27.4 points, 9.9 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game. [16]\n\nThe Jazz reached the NBA Finals for the first time after beating the Los Angeles Clippers 3–0, Los Angeles Lakers 4–1, and Houston Rockets 4–2. The Jazz then met Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the finals, losing to the Bulls 4–2, with the last two games being decided in the final seconds (scores of 90–88 and 87–86). [17]\n\nDuring the offseason, the Jazz made no significant changes to their roster. As the 1997–98 season neared, the Jazz were expected to be contenders for the championship once again. However, Stockton suffered a serious knee injury before the season began, and missed the first 18 games, in which the Jazz went 11-7. Once Stockton returned, the team went 51-13 the rest of the way, mirroring their winning pace of the year before, to finish at 62–20 for the season, winning the Midwest Division and also homecourt advantage for the playoffs. [18] [19]\n\nIn the playoffs, the Jazz beat the Houston Rockets 3–2, and the San Antonio Spurs 4–1, to advance to the Western Conference Finals for the third straight year. Utah, with a veteran core of Stockton, Malone and Hornacek (averaging 34.3 years of age), were facing a Los Angeles Lakers squad led by superstar Shaquille O'Neal, guards Eddie Jones, Nick Van Exel, and a young Kobe Bryant. The Jazz set the tone for the series with a resounding win in Game 1, 112-77. Game 2 was much closer, a 99-95 Jazz victory, and Games 3 and 4 in Los Angeles were decided by an average of 7.5 points. However, the Jazz prevailed in a sweep, 4–0, giving the Los Angeles their first playoff series sweep since the 1989 NBA Finals, and earning a 2nd straight trip to the NBA Finals. [20]\n\nIn the 1998 NBA Finals, the Jazz took Game 1 at home 88–85. However, the Bulls overcame a slow start to win Game 2 93–88, easily took Game 3, 96–54 and won a closer Game 4, 86–82 to lead 3–1 in the series. The Jazz fought back to win Game 5 on the road, 83–81, to trail 3-2 in the series, with Game 6 (and a Game 7 if needed) in Salt Lake City. The Jazz held a lead in most of Game 6, but the Bulls rallied, and in the last seconds of the game, Michael Jordan made a famous jump shot to win the game, 87–86, and the series for Chicago, 4–2. [21]\n\n1999–2003: Stockton and Malone's final years[]\n\nIn the 1999 season, shortened to 50 games due to a lockout, the Jazz finished the season 37–13, tied with the Spurs for the best record in the league. They defeated the Sacramento Kings in five games in the first round of the playoffs. However, they lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Portland Trail Blazers. Despite yet another disappointment, Malone was awarded his second MVP. [22]\n\nDuring the 1999–00 season, the Jazz finished 55–27 and won the Midwest Division but once again struggled in the postseason, losing to the Portland Trail Blazers, again during the second round. During the offseason, Hornacek retired and Howard Eisley was traded in a four-team deal that brought in Donyell Marshall. They selected promising high school basketball star DeShawn Stevenson in the first round of the NBA Draft.\n\nIn the 2000–01 season, they went 53–29, but they faltered in the playoffs, surrendering a 2–0 series lead in the first round of the playoffs to the Dallas Mavericks, to lose the series 3-2. It was their earliest exit from the playoffs since the 1994-95 season.\n\nIn the 2001–02 season, Andrei Kirilenko made his rookie debut, averaging 10.7 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 1.91 blocks per game. The team started slowly, going 16-15 over the first two months, and finished 12-13 to go 44-38 overall. They lost to the Sacramento Kings 3–1 in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nPrior to the 2002–03, Marshall and Russell moved on to other teams. Forward Matt Harpring was brought over from the Philadelphia 76ers. He took over the starting forward spot next to Malone and averaged 17.6 points and 6.6 rebounds, the best numbers of his career. The Jazz approached 50 wins going into the playoffs, ultimately going 47–35. They faced the Sacramento Kings once again, losing in a seven-game first round series, 4–1.\n\nAfter the season, the end of an era came when Stockton retired, and Malone left as a free agent to join the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n2003–2005: Rebuilding[]\n\nWith their two franchise cornerstones in Malone and Stockton gone, the team was suddenly lacking a foundation going into the 2003–04 season. They were expected to finish near the bottom of the NBA by several NBA preview magazines, including Sports Illustrated.[23] Surprisingly, the Jazz finished with a 42–40 record. The team featured several unheralded players who emerged into key contributors, including Kirilenko, Raja Bell, and Carlos Arroyo. In particular, Kirilenko demonstrated versatility on both offense and defense and earned a spot in the All-Star Game. The Jazz missed the playoffs by just one game to the Denver Nuggets, ending their streak of 20 consecutive seasons in the playoffs. Jerry Sloan finished second in the voting for the NBA Coach of the Year Award, losing to Hubie Brown of the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nDuring the offseason, the team made moves to bolster their roster, acquiring Carlos Boozer and Mehmet Okur as free agents and re-signing Carlos Arroyo and Gordan Giricek to extensions.\n\nThe 2004-05 season was marked by a series of injuries, first to Arroyo and Raul Lopez, and later to Boozer and Kirilenko, which were a large part of the team's fall to the bottom of the division. When healthy, Boozer filled the power forward position ably, averaging 17.8 points and 9.0 rebounds in 51 games. The Jazz ended the 2004–05 season with a record of 26–56, their worst since the 1981-82 season.\n\nIn the summer of 2005, the Jazz continued to shape their roster by trading three draft picks in order to acquire the #3 pick overall, which they used to select point guard Deron Williams of the University of Illinois. Other transactions included Raja Bell leaving the team for the Phoenix Suns, the Jazz re-obtaining center Greg Ostertag from the Kings, and oft-injured point guard Raul Lopez being traded to the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nThe 2005–06 season was injury-plagued before it even started; Boozer missed the first 49 games and Gordan Giricek and Kirilenko both missed significant time due to injuries. Okur and Kirilenko, however, showed consistently good play, while Williams, despite a mid-season slump, did not disappoint. However, team owner Larry Miller continually expressed his displeasure with the team's effort during that year. The Jazz stayed in the playoff race until the third-to-last game, when they lost to the Dallas Mavericks. The Jazz ended the season 41–41 and just 3 games out of the playoffs. Ostertag retired at the end of the season, having spent 10 of his 11 NBA seasons with the team.\n\nIn the 2006 NBA Draft, the Jazz selected promising University of Arkansas shooting guard Ronnie Brewer in the first round and in the second round selected point guard Dee Brown and power forward Paul Millsap. Several young players were traded away for Golden State Warriors guard Derek Fisher, giving them a veteran point guard. The Jazz were heralded by several major sports websites for drafting well and making good offseason moves.[24][25]\n\n2005–2010: Williams/Boozer Era[]\n\nDuring the 2006–07 season, the Jazz improved considerably compared to the prior years, finishing with a 51–31 record. Boozer was selected as an All-Star for the first time (though he missed the game to a minor injury) and center Mehmet Okur was selected to the All-Star game as well. Deron Williams had a breakout sophomore season, finishing third in the league in assists per game with 9.3 (behind Steve Nash and Chris Paul).\n\nThe team also developed a deep bench; in the 10 games that Boozer and Okur (the two leading scorers) missed, the team went 8–2. Paul Millsap was a pleasant surprise as a rookie, becoming a competent backup to Boozer. Despite the elevated play of the Jazz's budding stars, Kirilenko showed a significant drop in his statistics and seemed to struggle adapting to his reduced role. This eventually led to a well-publicized breakdown early in the first round of the playoffs.[26]\n\nThe Jazz faced the Houston Rockets in the first round that year, a matchup of #4-#5 seeds (Utah was seeded higher due to winning the Northwest Division, but Houston had a 52-30 record opposed to Utah's 51-31, giving them homecourt in the series). It was a physical, close-fought matchup, with each of the first 6 games being won by the home team. The Jazz were able to break this trend in the 7th game, beating the Rockets 103–99 in Houston. The Jazz then went on to face the eighth-seeded Golden State Warriors, who were coming off a historic upset of the #1-seeded Dallas Mavericks (who had gone 67–15 in the regular season, one of the best in NBA history). However, the Jazz easily handled the Warriors, winning the series 4–1, and made their first Western Conference Finals appearance since 1998. The Jazz faced the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals, but were unable to handle the more experienced Spurs, losing 4 games to 1 in the series to the eventual NBA Champions.\n\nDuring the offseason, the Jazz gained a hometown D-League affiliate in the Utah Flash (based in Orem), which they shared with the Boston Celtics. They selected shooting guard Morris Almond in the first round, although ultimately they made few lineup changes. The most significant move was in letting Derek Fisher go. Fisher had become a fan favorite due to his strong play, and also a sympathetic one due to his daughter's well-publicized battle with a rare form of eye cancer. Fisher moved to Los Angeles during the offseason to be closer to better care for his daughter, and later signed with the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he won three championships from 2000–2002. Controversy arose after Andrei Kirilenko led his Russian national team to a win in EuroBasket 2007 (the European championship), a tournament in which he was named MVP. After this, Kirilenko posted on a blog that he wished to be traded from the Jazz and would be willing to walk away from his contract.[27] He later reaffirmed this in interviews. However, no trade was made and he remained with the team.\n\nDuring the 2007–08 season, after a trade that sent guard Gordan Giricek to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for guard Kyle Korver, the Jazz ran off a record-tying 19-game home winning streak and improved on the road after a rough December. Despite the off-season controversy and trade talk, Kirilenko elevated his play, improving all stats from the previous season and seeming content with his new role more as a defender and a facilitator as opposed to a scorer. Carlos Boozer again won an All-Star selection, while Deron Williams continued to elevate his play, averaging 13.3 assists per game in March (as opposed to 10.5 for the season as a whole). The Jazz finished the regular season 5th best in the west with a 54–28 record. For the first time since the 97-98 season, the Jazz sold out every home game, and they possessed a phenomenal 37-4 home record; this was, however, offset by a subpar road record.\n\nThe Jazz once again became matched against the Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs, this time as a #4 seed (although the Rockets possessed home-court advantage due to a better record). The Jazz jumped out to a quick 2-0 series lead in Houston, but lost the first game in Salt Lake City. After splitting the next two games, the Jazz dealt the Rockets a 113-91 blowout victory in game 6, placing them into a second-round matchup with the #1 seed Los Angeles Lakers, their first postseason meeting since the since the 1998 Western Conference Finals. Utah lost games 1 and 2 in Los Angeles. However the Jazz held up their great home winning record by defeating Los Angeles in Games 3 and 4. The Jazz lost game 5 in L.A. and were eventually eliminated in Game 6. The Jazz made no major offseason moves during the following offseason, though Deron Williams was an integral part of the Gold-Medal winning Redeem Team at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.\n\nThe 2008–09 season was difficult for the Jazz as they struggled with consistent injuries that continually disrupted the chemistry of the team, and although they were once again nearly unstoppable at home, they possessed a poor road record. Utah's top three players all missed significant times due to sickness or injuries; Deron Williams missed 13 of the first 15 games, Carlos Boozer missed more than half of the season, and Mehmet Okur missed sporadic time due to both injuries and his father's sickness that forced him to travel to his native Turkey early in the season. On February 20, 2009, Jazz owner Larry H. Miller died of complications from diabetes. His son, Greg Miller, became the new CEO of the team. The Jazz finished with a 48–34 record, causing them to slip to #8 in the competitive Western Conference playoff race, after which they were eliminated by the Los Angeles Lakers for the second year in a row, 4 games to 1.\n\nThe season ended up being the last for long-time radio and former TV announcer Hot Rod Hundley, who announced his retirement after being with the Jazz for their entire history (35 years). Despite the disappointment, Deron Williams proved himself to be one of the elite point guards of the league, averaging 19.4 points and 10.8 assists per game, second in the league, despite playing the entire season with a lingering ankle injury.\n\nDuring the 2009 NBA Draft, the Jazz selected point guard Eric Maynor #20 overall to back up Deron Williams. Veteran Matt Harpring retired, citing consistent injuries sustained from his physical playing style. Rumors began to circulate that Boozer wanted a trade, fueled by rumors that the Jazz were shopping him after he chose to \"opt-in\" to the last year of his contract; however, the team stated publicly that they were not seeking to trade him, and Boozer remained with the team heading into the 2009–10 season. The Jazz also added rookie shooting guard Wesley Matthews to the lineup after an impressive training camp.\n\nAs the 2009–10 season began, the Jazz stumbled a bit early, starting off 19-17. Several trades were made by the team during the season, one that sent promising rookie Eric Maynor and the contract of the retired Matt Harpring to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Another sent starting shooting guard Ronnie Brewer to the Memphis Grizzlies at midseason, a trade which was openly criticized by Deron Williams.[28] The Brewer trade cleared the way for Wesley Matthews to take over the starting shooting guard spot. Also, Deron Williams was selected to play in the All-Star Game for the first time, and after a controversial offseason, Carlos Boozer played better than the year prior, averaging 19.5 points and 11.2 rebounds per game, and missed only 4 games to injuries. He even suggested that he would be happy to stay with Utah long-term.[29] After returning from an early season injury, Kyle Korver set the NBA record for three-point field goal percentage in a season.[30]\n\nIn a tight Western Conference, the Jazz finished the season 53-29 and lost the division in a tiebreaker with the Denver Nuggets, ending with the #5 seed, matched up with the Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs. Kirilenko, who had missed 13 of the last 15 games of the regular season due to a nagging calf muscle strain, re-aggravated the injury the day before the first game of the playoffs and missed the first round, while Mehmet Okur tore his Achilles tendon in the first game and missed the rest of the playoffs. Despite the injuries, the Jazz played well enough to defeat Denver 4-2 in the series. The Jazz were then eliminated by the Los Angeles Lakers for the third year in a row, being swept 4-0 (the first 4 game sweep in Jazz history).\n\nDuring the 2010 NBA Draft, the Utah Jazz selected Gordon Hayward with the #9 overall pick, and Jeremy Evans in the second round.\n\nCarlos Boozer agreed to a 5-year, $80 million contract with the Chicago Bulls in free agency on July 7, 2010. The Jazz turned the transaction into a sign-and-trade one day later, receiving a trade exception worth around $13 million in return from Chicago.[31] Kyle Korver also agreed to sign with the Chicago Bulls, two days later, on July 9, 2010. Terms were not announced, but multiple reports have his deal for 3 years, $13 million.[32]\n\nWesley Matthews signed a 5-year $33 million dollar offer sheet with the Portland Trail Blazers, as a restricted free agent, on July 10, 2010. The Jazz declined to match the offer, allowing Portland to acquire Matthews.\n\nLess than a week after the Boozer defection, on July 13, 2010, the team traded Kosta Koufos and 2 future first round picks to Minnesota for Forward/Center Al Jefferson, using the trade exception from the Carlos Boozer deal to receive Jefferson's contract without exceeding the salary cap.[33]\n\nRaja Bell was added also, to provide backcourt help after the losses of Korver and Matthews. He was signed to a 3-year, $10 million contract.\n\nOn June 15, 2010, the Jazz unveiled a new color scheme and logo which represented a return to the old 'music note' logo. The team unveiled new uniforms on August 16.[34]\n\nThe Jazz tendered restricted free-agent center Kyrylo Fesenko a $1 million qualifying offer in June 2010. The offer entitled Utah to match any offer that Fesenko received from another team, whether signed or not. Fesenko signed the offer on September 27, 2010, the day before training camp began.[35]\n\nOn the eve of training camp, the Jazz added two more players, center Francisco Elson and guard Earl Watson to shore up the roster for the 2010-11 season.\n\n2010–2013: Millsap/Jefferson era[]\n\nOn February 10, 2011, head coach Jerry Sloan resigned in the middle of the season along with assistant Phil Johnson. Tyrone Corbin was named the new head coach, and a week later the Jazz hired assistant coach and former Jazz player Jeff Hornacek. On February 23, 2011, the Jazz traded star player Deron Williams to the New Jersey Nets for two 1st round draft picks (New Jersey's 2011 and Golden State's conditional 2012) and players, Derrick Favors and Devin Harris, after Williams got into a shouting match with head coach Jerry Sloan during a game against the Chicago Bulls. While Williams was under contract through Template:NBAy with a player option worth $17.7 million for Template:NBAy, Jazz chief executive officer Greg Miller did not believe they would be able to re-sign Williams. \"And while I never saw any indication that he wouldn’t re-sign with us, I never saw any indication he would,” said Miller.[36][37]\n\nThe remainder of the season saw the Jazz continue to struggle, finishing with a 39–43 record, 11th in the Western Conference, therefore missing the playoffs for the first time since 2006.\n\nDuring the 2011 draft, the Jazz had two top-14 picks (one acquired in the trade that sent Williams to the New Jersey Nets), and used them on Enes Kanter and Alec Burks. Following the end of the 2011 NBA lockout that saw the 2011–12 season shortened to 66 games, the Jazz bid farewell to their two longest-tenured players – Mehmet Okur was traded to the Nets for a future second-round pick, and Andrei Kirilenko, who played in his native Russia during the lockout and whose contract had expired after the 2011 season, decided to stay in Russia for the remainder of the 2011–12 season. They also acquired free agent veterans Josh Howard and Jamaal Tinsley.\n\nDuring the 2012 off-season, the Jazz traded Devin Harris to the Hawks for Marvin Williams.\n\nIn the 2012 draft, the Jazz selected Kevin Murphy with the No. 47 overall pick. The Jazz signed Mo Williams and Randy Foye, both former Clippers, and re-signed Jeremy Evans and Tinsley during the off-season. Long-time Jazz player C. J. Miles decided to sign with Cleveland. Andrei Kirilenko did not re-sign with the Jazz in the off-season. The Jazz also named Dennis Lindsey as general manager and Kevin O'Connor as vice president of basketball operations.\n\nLongtime assistant coach Scott Layden left Utah to be a part of the San Antonio Spurs front office.\n\n2013–2017: Hayward/Gobert era[]\n\nBefore the 2013–14 season began, Utah did not retain either Paul Millsap or Al Jefferson. Millsap accepted a two-year offer to join the Atlanta Hawks, while Jefferson signed with the Charlotte Bobcats. Jeff Hornacek was hired during the off-season as head coach of the Phoenix Suns. On March 14, 2014, the Jazz were officially eliminated from playoff contention with a 96–87 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nOn June 27, 2013, Rudy Gobert was selected with the 27th overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. He was later traded on draft night to the Utah Jazz. On July 6, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Jazz and joined them for the 2013 NBA Summer League.\n\nOn May 20, 2014, the Jazz earned the 5th pick in the 2014 NBA draft at the NBA Draft Lottery, with which they chose 18-year-old Australian point guard Dante Exum. They also had the 23rd pick from a trade with the Golden State Warriors and their own pick in the second round (the 35th pick overall). With the 23rd pick they selected Rodney Hood from Duke University. The 35th pick was used to select Jarnell Stokes, who was subsequently traded to the Memphis Grizzlies for a future second-round pick.\n\nOn June 6, 2014, Atlanta Hawks assistant coach Quin Snyder was named the eighth head coach in team history. Snyder signed a three-year contract with a team option for a fourth. He replaced Tyrone Corbin. Prior to joining the Utah Jazz, Snyder previously served as an NBA assistant coach for the Atlanta Hawks, Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers, and Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe Jazz ended the 2015–16 season with a win-loss record of 40–42, good for ninth place in the Western Conference; however, the team failed to qualify to play in the NBA Playoffs by one game.\n\nThe Jazz finished 51–31 during the 2016–17 season and qualified to play in the NBA Playoffs as the Western Conference's fifth seed. They defeated the Los Angeles Clippers in seven games in the first round for the team's first playoff series win since 2010. The team advanced to play the defending Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors in the conference semifinals where they were swept 4–0, ending their season. Gordon Hayward and Rudy Gobert had breakout seasons in 2017. After putting together several solid seasons in prior years, Hayward was named an NBA All-Star, while Gobert was named to the NBA Defensive First Team and All NBA Second Team.\n\nHayward left the Jazz to sign with the Boston Celtics as a free agent on July 4, 2017, announcing his decision in a letter published by The Players' Tribune. Hayward's contract was finalized on July 14, 2017.\n\n2017–2022: The Gobert and Mitchell era[]\n\n2017: Arrival of Donovan Mitchell[]\n\nOn June 22, 2017, Donovan Mitchell was selected with the 13th overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft by the Denver Nuggets, who immediately traded Mitchell's rights to the Jazz in exchange for Trey Lyles. The Jazz also acquired veteran Ricky Rubio to play the point guard position.\n\nThe Jazz began the 2017–18 season poorly, with an injury to Gobert and a lack of scoring leaving them with a 17–21 record by the end of December. In the second half of the season, the Jazz made rookie Mitchell a starter, and he subsequently led the team and all rookies in the league in points scored. Mitchell went on to break the record for the most three-pointers ever made by a rookie.[56] The team improved drastically as a scoring team, and with the return of Gobert and improved play of Rubio, the Jazz finished the season on a 32-13 run and ended with a 48–34 record. The late season burst earned the Jazz a no. 5 seed in the 2018 NBA Playoffs, where they went on to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 4–2 in the First Round before losing in the Second Round to the Houston Rockets in five games. After the season, Rudy Gobert was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year, Donovan Mitchell was runner-up in the Rookie of the Year voting, Quin Snyder was runner-up Coach of the Year, and general manager Dennis Lindsey was runner-up Executive of the Year.\n\n2018–20: Regular Season Success and Playoff Disappointment[]\n\nThe 2018-19 season began with promise for the Jazz after the surprising success of the 2017-18 season. However by the end of November, they were 11-12 and in 10th place in the Western Conference standings. This continued in December as Mitchell struggled with his shot, and the Jazz record continued to be around the break-even mark.\n\nHowever, in the New Year, Mitchell turned the corner and played much better, averaging 27.7 points in January and 25.4 in February. And the Jazz improved down the stretch, closing out the season with a 32-13 run to finish 50-32 and earned the #5 seed in the Western Conference playoffs.[61] In the first round, they drew the Houston Rockets, who were on a run of their own, going 33-14 in 2019 after a slow start. Houston proved to be too much for the Jazz, taking the series 4-1.\n\nOn May 10, 2019, the Jazz announced the promotion of Dennis Lindsey to executive vice president of basketball operations and Justin Zanik to general manager.\n\nDuring the 2019 off-season, the Jazz added several players by trade and free agency, including Jeff Green, Mike Conley Jr., Ed Davis, Bojan Bogdanović, and Emmanuel Mudiay, while Derrick Favors, Kyle Korver, Jae Crowder, Raul Neto, and Ricky Rubio left the team. Sports media viewed the changes as positive.\n\nOn the opening day of the 2019–20 season, a press conference was held, announcing that Utah will host the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, which will be the second time the Jazz have hosted this event; the prior time was in 1993.\n\nOn December 24, 2019, the Jazz announced that they had waived forward Jeff Green, signed G-League free agent Rayjon Tucker, and traded Dante Exum to the Cleveland Cavaliers for shooting guard Jordan Clarkson, whose trade in particular was seen as overwhelmingly positive by the media, if also bittersweet for Jazz fans who hoped that Exum would eventually mature into the franchise cornerstone he was drafted to be.\n\nOn January 30, 2020, Gobert and Mitchell were named reserves for the 2020 NBA All-Star Game. This marked the first time since 2007 that multiple Utah Jazz players had been selected to the All-Star game. In March 2020, Jazz players Gobert and Mitchell were diagnosed with COVID-19, making the Jazz the first major sporting franchise in North America to be directly affected by the disease, and resulting in the suspension of all remaining NBA games of the season.\n\nOn June 4, 2020, the Jazz clinched a playoff berth for the fourth straight season, after the NBA approved a plan to return to play in the NBA Bubble with only 22 teams in late July.\n\nThe Jazz were mediocre in the eight seeding games, posting a 3–5 record. However, this allowed them to lock up the Western Conference sixth seed and a favorable matchup with the Denver Nuggets. In Game 1, Donovan Mitchell achieved the third-highest single-game scoring total in playoff history (behind only Michael Jordan and Elgin Baylor) with 57 points, but the Jazz lost to the Nuggets in overtime. Mitchell's brilliant play continued through the series as the Jazz won the next three games, two of them by lopsided margins; however, they blew their 3–1 lead and lost at the buzzer in Game 7 of the series. Within hours of that game, Mitchell agreed to a five-year max extension that would keep him in Utah.\n\n2020–22: Three NBA All-Stars and Playoff Contention[]\n\nOn October 28, 2020, the Utah Jazz organization announced that Ryan Smith, a Utah native and the billionaire co-founder of Qualtrics, had purchased the team from the Miller family. Smith agreed at the time of the sale to honor the terms of the legacy trust into which the Millers had placed the Jazz organization, including the provision requiring the team to be kept in Utah. On April 16, 2021, the Jazz announced that Dwyane Wade had purchased a minority ownership stake in the team and was expected to have hands-on involvement in team operations.\n\nThe Jazz began their 2020–21 season with an NBA-best and franchise-record 23–5 start, with Donovan Mitchell leading the team in scoring and Jordan Clarkson emerging as the frontrunner for Sixth Man of the Year. On February 17, 2021, head coach Quin Snyder was announced as the head coach of the Western Conference team for the 2021 NBA All-Star Game, becoming the first Jazz coach so honored since Frank Layden in 1984. On February 23, Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert were announced as All-Star reserves for the second consecutive season, with Mitchell also slated to compete in the three-point contest. On March 5, Mike Conley was selected as an All-Star reserve for the first time in his career, replacing the injured Devin Booker. Conley was also announced as Booker's replacement in the three-point contest. This marked the second time in franchise history (the first being 1989 with John Stockton, Karl Malone, and Mark Eaton) that three Jazz players had been selected as All-Stars.\n\nOn February 24, 2021, former Jazz forward Elijah Millsap alleged via Twitter that Dennis Lindsey (then the team's general manager) had made a racist remark to him during an interview in 2015. Both Lindsey and Quin Snyder, who was present for the conversation, adamantly denied the allegations. The Jazz subsequently announced that independent counsel had been retained by the organization to investigate whether the allegations were true. On March 16, the NBA announced that this investigation had concluded that there was no proof Lindsey had made the comments, citing the fact that nobody associated with the meeting could corroborate Millsap's story (including Millsap's own agent, who confirmed that Millsap had never mentioned the incident to him at the time). The Jazz organization subsequently cleared Lindsey of any wrongdoing.\n\nOn May 16, 2021, the Jazz defeated the Sacramento Kings 121-99 to clinch sole possession of the best regular season record in the NBA for the first time in franchise history (the Jazz had tied for the best record in 1998 and 1999), and cliched the top-seed in the Western Conference for the first time since the 1997–98 season.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Jazz defeated the Memphis Grizzlies in five games in the first round, winning their first playoff series since 2018. The Jazz advanced to the semifinals, where they faced the fourth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers. This was the fourth meeting between the two teams in the playoffs, with the Jazz having won all three previous meetings (1992, 1997, 2017). Unfortunately for the Jazz, despite winning the first two games of the series they would go on to lose the next four games to the Clippers, ultimately losing the series in six games.\n\nAfter a win against the Memphis Grizzlies in overtime on April 5, 2022, the Jazz clinched their sixth consecutive playoff appearance.\n\nThe Jazz finished the 2021–22 season regular season with a 49–33 record, clinching the No. 5 seed in the Western Conference and winning their 5th Northwest Division title (11th overall).\n\nIn the playoffs, the Jazz faced the 4th-seeded Dallas Mavericks in the first round. The two teams previously met in the first round of the 2001 NBA Playoffs, with the Mavericks winning in five games. The Jazz would go on to lose in six games to the Mavericks.\n\n2022–present: The Lauri Markkanen era[]\n\n2022: Departures of Gobert and Mitchell[]\n\nOn July 1, 2022, the Jazz traded three–time NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award winner Rudy Gobert to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Leandro Bolmaro, and Walker Kessler, the number 22 selection in the 2022 NBA Draft. The Jazz also acquired four future first round draft picks from the Timberwolves. On August 25, 2022, Beverley was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Stanley Johnson along with Talen Horton-Tucker. On September 1, 2022, the Jazz traded three-time all-star guard Donovan Mitchell to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Collin Sexton, Lauri Markkanen, Ochai Agbaji, the Cavaliers' top selection and the 14th pick in the 2022 Draft, and three future unprotected first–round draft picks, and 2 pick swaps.\n\nOn June 5, 2022, Quin Snyder announced his resignation as head coach of the Jazz. On June 29, the Jazz organization announced that Boston Celtics assistant coach Will Hardy had been hired as Snyder's replacement.\n\nOn February 2, 2023, Lauri Markkanen was selected to appear as a reserve in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, his first career All-Star selection. On February 10, it was further announced that Markkanen had been selected as an All-Star starter as a result of injuries to Stephen Curry and Zion Williamson. Markkanen also participated in the Three-Point Contest during All-Star weekend. In addition, the Jazz fielded a three-player team of Collin Sexton, Walker Kessler, and Jordan Clarkson in the NBA's re-formatted team skills challenge. The three Jazzmen ultimately won the event.\n\nOn February 8, 2023, the Jazz traded Malik Beasley and Jarred Vanderbilt to the Los Angeles Lakers and Mike Conley Jr., Nickeil Alexander-Walker, and two future second-round picks to the Minnesota Timberwolves as part of a three-team trade. In return, the Jazz received Russell Westbrook, Juan Toscano-Anderson, and Damian Jones along with the Lakers' 2027 first-round pick. The Jazz subsequently negotiated a buyout of Westbrook's contract and waived him, allowing him to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nRivals[]\n\nThe Jazz have not had a natural or fierce rival throughout their history, where each team has been competitive with the other over a long period of time. There have been several teams that they have played more than once in the NBA playoffs.\n\nThe Jazz have played the Houston Rockets eight times in the playoffs with the Jazz winning the series five times. The Rockets won two NBA championships in 1994 and 1995), while defeating the Jazz along the way. The Portland Trail Blazers advanced to the 1992 NBA Finals after defeating the Jazz, while the Seattle SuperSonics advanced to the 1996 NBA Finals after defeating the Jazz as well. The San Antonio Spurs won an NBA championship in 2007 after defeating the Jazz in the Conference Finals, while Utah advanced to the 1998 NBA Finals after defeating San Antonio in the Conference Semifinals.\n\nUtah advanced to the NBA Finals both times that they defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, while the Lakers have advanced to the Finals each year they defeated Utah in either First Round or Conference Semifinals, winning NBA championships in 1988, 2009, and 2010. During the 2012–13 season, the Jazz and the Lakers competed for the eighth seed in the Western Conference, but the Jazz did not qualify for the 2013 NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe Jazz also have a regional rivalry with the Denver Nuggets. Both clubs are geographically situated in the Rocky Mountains, and have been part of the same division since 1979, having moved to the Northwest Division for the 2004–05 season.\n\nOlympians[]\n\nOn June 23, 2008, it was officially announced that team members Deron Williams and Carlos Boozer were selected for the 2008 U.S. Olympic basketball team that participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics in China. The Jazz were the only team in the NBA with two players on the 2008 U.S. Olympic squad. The \"Redeem Team\" was awarded the gold medal.\n\nWilliams and Boozer joined former Jazz players John Stockton and Karl Malone as the only Jazzmen to be selected to play for the U.S. team. Stockton and Malone won gold medals at the 1992 and 1996 Olympic games. Andrei Kirilenko represented his home country of Russia at the 2008 games.\n\nSeason-by-season records[]\n\nNote: W = Wins, L = Losses, % = Percentage\n\nSeason W L % Playoffs Results New Orleans Jazz 1974-75 23 59 .280 1975-76 38 44 .463 1976-77 35 47 .427 1977-78 39 43 .476 1978-79 26 56 .317 Utah Jazz 1979-80 24 58 .293 1980-81 28 54 .341 1981-82 25 57 .305 1982-83 30 52 .366 1983-84 45 37 .549 Won First Round\n\nLost Conference Semifinals Utah 3, Denver 2\n\nPhoenix 4, Utah 2 1984-85 41 41 .500 Won First Round\n\nLost Conference Semifinals Utah 3, Houston 2\n\nDenver 4, Utah 1 1985-86 42 40 .512 Lost First Round Dallas 3, Utah 1 1986-87 44 38 .537 Lost First Round Golden State 3, Utah 2 1987-88 47 35 .573 Won First Round\n\nLost Conference Semifinals Utah 3, Portland 1\n\nLA Lakers 4, Utah 3 1988-89 51 31 .622 Lost First Round Golden State 3, Utah 0 1989-90 55 27 .671 Lost First Round Phoenix 3, Utah 2 1990-91 54 28 .659 Won First Round\n\nLost Conference Semifinals Utah 3, Phoenix 1\n\nPortland 4, Utah 1 1991-92 55 27 .671 Won First Round\n\nWon Conference Semifinals\n\nLost Conference Finals Utah 3, LA Clippers 2\n\nUtah 4, Seattle 1\n\nPortland 4, Utah 2 1992-93 47 35 .573 Lost First Round Seattle 3, Utah 2 1993-94 53 29 .646 Won First Round\n\nWon Conference Semifinals\n\nLost Conference Finals Utah 3, San Antonio 1\n\nUtah 4, Denver 3\n\nHouston 4, Utah 1 1994-95 60 22 .732 Lost First Round Houston 3, Utah 2 1995-96 55 27 .671 Won First Round\n\nWon Conference Semifinals\n\nLost Conference Finals Utah 3, Portland 2\n\nUtah 4, San Antonio 2\n\nSeattle 4, Utah 3 1996-97 64 18 .780 Won First Round\n\nWon Conference Semifinals\n\nWon Conference Finals\n\nLost NBA Finals Utah 3, LA Clippers 0\n\nUtah 4, LA Lakers 1\n\nUtah 4, Houston 2\n\nChicago 4, Utah 2 1997-98 62 20 .756 Won First Round\n\nWon Conference Semifinals\n\nWon Conference Finals\n\nLost NBA Finals Utah 3, Houston 2\n\nUtah 4, San Antonio 1\n\nUtah 4, LA Lakers 0\n\nChicago 4, Utah 2 1998-99 37 13 .740 Won First Round\n\nLost Conference Semifinals Utah 3, Sacramento 3\n\nPortland 4, Utah 2 1999-00 55 27 .671 Won First Round\n\nLost Conference Semifinals Utah 3, Seattle 2\n\nPortland 4, Utah 1 2000-01 53 29 .646 Lost First Round Dallas 3, Utah 2 2001-02 44 38 .537 Lost First Round Sacramento 3, Utah 1 2002-03 47 35 .573 Lost First Round Sacramento 4, Utah 1 2003-04 42 40 .512 2004-05 26 56 .317 2005-06 41 41 .500 2006-07 51 31 .622 Won First Round\n\nWon Conference Semifinals\n\nLost Conference Finals Utah 4, Houston 3\n\nUtah 4, Golden State 1\n\nSan Antonio 4, Utah 1 2007-08 54 28 .659 Won First Round\n\nLost Conference Semifinals Utah 4, Houston 2\n\nLA Lakers 4, Utah 2 2008-09 48 34 .585 Lost First Round LA Lakers 4, Utah 1 2009-10 53 29 .646 Won First Round\n\nLost Conference Semifinals Utah 4, Denver 2\n\nLA Lakers 4, Utah 0 2010-11 39 43 .476 2011-12 36 30 .545 Lost First Round San Antonio 4, Utah 0 2012-13 43 39 .524 2013-14 25 57 .305 2014-15 38 44 .463 2015-16 40 42 .488 2016-17 51 31 .622 Won First Round\n\nLost Conference Semifinals Utah 4, LA Clippers 3\n\nGolden State 4, Utah 0 2017-18 48 34 .585 Won First Round\n\nLost Conference Semifinals Utah 4, Oklahoma City 2\n\nHouston 4, Utah 1 2018-19 50 32 .610 Lost First Round Houston 4, Utah 1 2019-20 44 28 .611 Lost First Round Denver 4, Utah 3 2020-21 52 20 .722 Won First Round\n\nLost Conference Semifinals Utah 4, Memphis 1\n\nLA Clippers 4, Utah 2 2021-22 49 33 .598 Lost First Round Dallas 4, Utah 2 2022-23 37 45 .451 2023-24 31 51 .378 Totals 2008 1706 .539 Playoffs 118 134 .468 0 Championships\n\nArenas and Logos[]\n\nArenas[]\n\nNew Orleans Jazz\n\nLoyola Field House (1974–1975)\n\nMunicipal Auditorium (1974–1975)\n\nLouisiana Superdome (1975–1979)\n\nUtah Jazz\n\nSalt Palace (1979–1991)\n\nDelta Center (formerly Salt Lake Ice Center, EnergySolutions Arena, Vivint Smart Home Arena, and Vivint Arena) (1991–present)\n\nLogos[]\n\nUniforms[]\n\nSince the team's move from New Orleans to Salt Lake City in 1979, the Utah Jazz have worn several uniforms throughout their franchise history. From 1979–1996, the Jazz' home uniforms consisted of the \"basketball forming J music note to write on Jazz\" logo on the center chest, with purple numbers. The only modification to this uniform was the word \"Utah\" being added to the center chest logo in 1986. From 1979–1984, the Jazz' road uniforms were dark green, with the aforementioned Jazz logo on the center chest and gold numbers. For the 1984–85 season, the dark green road uniforms were changed to purple, with white trim added around the gold numbers. These uniforms were worn until the 1995–96 season.\n\nFor the 1996–97 season, the Jazz drastically updated their logos and uniforms, with a new color scheme of purple, copper and turquoise. Their new uniform set featured a silhouette of the Wasatch Range on the center chest, with a stylish new Jazz script, and purple & turquoise details. On the road purple jersey, the white mountain range gradually fades to purple just above the numbers, which are white, with copper interior trim and teal outlining. On the home white jersey, the numbers are purple, with white interior trim and teal outlining. The Jazz wore these jerseys until the 2003–04 season.\n\nThe Jazz also introduced an alternate black jersey in the 1998–99 season, with the Jazz script on the center chest, but without the Wasatch Range silhouette. On this jersey, both the Jazz script and numbers are white, with purple interior trim and copper outlining, and copper side panels. These jerseys were worn until the 2003–04 season.\n\nIn the 2004–05 season, the Jazz once again updated their color scheme, logos and uniforms. The new color scheme, which the team used until the end of the 2009–10 season, consisted of navy blue, powder blue, silver & purple, though the latter color was only used on the primary logo and alternate logo. The team logo remained the same, for the exception of the new color variation. The new home uniform consisted of an updated \"Jazz\" script on the center chest in navy blue, with navy numbers, both of which had silver interior trim and powder blue outlining. The new road uniform was navy blue, with a \"Utah\" script in powder blue on the center chest and powder blue numbers, both of which had silver outlining and white interior trim.\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, the Jazz introduced a new alternate powder blue uniform. This uniform, which the team used until the end of the 2009–10 season, featured a Jazz script identical to the team logo and navy blue numbers below the script, also with silver and white trim. The nameplate on the back of the jersey was navy blue.\n\nOn June 15, 2010, the Jazz unveiled a new logo and color scheme on the team's official website.[38] For the 2010–11 season, the Jazz reverted to the team's original music note logo (without the word Utah), with a new color scheme of navy blue, gold, dark green & gray.[39] The new uniform set, which was unveiled on August 16, 2010, features a design nearly identical to the team's aforementioned 1980s uniform designs, with the following differences: navy blue replacing purple on the road jerseys, dark green numerals on the home white jerseys, a white Jazz logo script on the road jerseys and side panels on both the home and away jerseys. The new uniforms were a combination of both the old and new styles, with navy blue retained from the most recent color scheme, but the now-famous 'J-note' logo and gold and green were revived.[40]\n\nThe Jazz unveiled an alternate jersey on December 9, 2011, that is similar to their road jersey, but swaps the navy and green colors so that the primary color is green, with a navy stripe on the side. This uniform was worn until the 2015–16 season.\n\nOn May 12, 2016, the Jazz updated their logos for the 2016–17 season. The team selected its wordmark logo as its new primary logo, with the addition of the word 'Utah' above the two Z's; because of that, the team discontinued the use of the mountain logo, which had been used since 1996. Modified uniforms were also unveiled. The new uniform set consisted of a new, custom number font, a modified green alternate, with a \"Utah\" script arched in white, and a new navy sleeved alternate featuring the white 'J-note' logo on the right breast and numbers on the left breast in gold, with green, gold and white stripes below the chest.\n\nIn 2017, as part of the switch to Nike as the NBA's uniform provider, the Jazz made some slight changes to their uniform set. While the white \"Association\" and navy \"Icon\" uniforms remained mostly intact, the Jazz retired their green and navy sleeved alternates in favor of a gold \"Statement\" uniform, featuring the navy 'J-note' logo and green numbers. The \"City\" uniform was inspired from the red rock formations found in Southern Utah, and it featured a gradient of gold, orange, burgundy and black.\n\nThrowback uniforms[]\n\nThe Jazz have worn the original J-note uniforms on three separate occasions. During the 2003–04 season, the Jazz commemorated the team's 25th season in Utah by donning replicas of the 1986–96 white uniforms.
