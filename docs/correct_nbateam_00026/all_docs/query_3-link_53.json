Some athletes have been symbolic figures of Black ability, while others have taken their activism beyond the court to the courtroom, boardroom and the newsroom.\n\nAbout the Exhibition\n\nWhen: Ongoing\n\nWhere: Level 3 (L3), Community Galleries\n\nCurator: Damion Thomas\n\nBecause sports were among the first, and most high profile spaces to accept African Americans on relative terms of equality, sport has had a unique role within American culture. Within black communities, sports have always been political. From the refusal to allow African Americans an opportunity to compete to the formation of African American segregated sporting teams and leagues; from the hard won battles to compete at the highest levels of the game to the introduction of African American expressive cultural practices within the games, the African American presence in sports has had social and political consequences.\n\nJourney Through the Exhibition\n\nSports Storylines\n\nSports matter beyond the playing field. This exhibition demonstrates the centrality of African American contributions and challenges to contemporary American culture and politics. African Americans created their own sports institutions, most notably the Negro Leagues, during the era of segregation. The exhibition examines the impact of these institutions as well as the integration of African American sports figures into all-white leagues.\n\nAt times, sports leads social change. Other times, sports stymies social change. Sports: Leveling the Playing Field continues the chronological exploration of African American activism and the quest for justice and equality begun in the exhibitions on slavery and segregation through the participation of African Americans in sports.\n\nSports are a way to measure racial progress within the United States. The exhibition encourages visitors to think about ways they can help make America a more just and equitable place by providing historical context for honest discussions about race and social justice.\n\nA Closer Look"
