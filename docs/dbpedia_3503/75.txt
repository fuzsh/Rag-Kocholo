TURNER, Mary Pictou Ruth Elizabeth ‘Mary’ Turner, age 84, of Pictou, passed away Thursday April 16, 2020 in the Valley View Villa, Riverton. Mary was born in New Glasgow on December 25, 1935. She was married to the late Robert Edwin "Doey" Turner. Mary was a devoted mother to her four children, Stephen (Hilda), Randy (Sharon), Bradley (Doreen) and Anne Marie Dawn; devoted to her grandchildren, Stephanie, Nick, Jody, Devin, Dennis, Desmond and Elliott and great-grandchildren, Keisha, Chase, Taylor, Nicholas, Layla, Westley, and Sadie, who were the loves of her life. Mary was predeceased by her mother, Margaret Penny; brothers, Francis and Robert; and is survived by a brother, Johnny Penny. Mary was a life member of the Royal Canadian Legion, Branch 16, Pictou, where she devoted a lot of her time serving her community with her spirit and her spunk. Here is where she loved to dance, socialize and dress to the nines, and also claiming her nick name…the late Mary T, for her continuous tardiness. Mary will be missed for her simple gestures of kindness and her big hugs. Cremation has taken place and a private family service will follow at a later date. The family would like to acknowledge the "Excellent Care" provided by the staff of Valley View Villa where Mary has spent the past six years.
