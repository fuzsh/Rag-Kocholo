Thomas is a Professor in the Department of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, and the co-Director of the Ohio Prison Education Exchange Project.\n\nTrained as a feminist geographer, her work examines how youth in the US come to understand themselves and their identities in and through institutional spaces like schools and detention facilities. Her research shows that while youth must spend vast amounts of time negotiating institutional structures that demand behavioral conformity, they alone shoulder the repercussions when they fail to meet expectations that are grounded in stereotypes, norms, and demands for idealized bodies. Her research foregrounds the emotional and subjective experiences of youth, especially girls, gender nonconforming, and queer youth, as they confront the oppressive social and cultural expectations of gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, and embodiment.\n\nDr. Thomas teaches courses on the school to prison pipeline, feminist pedagogy, feminist prison studies, and settler colonialism. She has taught courses on feminist and queer perspectives on incarceration and feminist studies at the Ohio Reformatory for Women. In collaboration with Dr. Tiyi Morris at OPEEP, she is working to expand OSU’s commitment to prison-based education. Her goal as an educator is to foster opportunities that enable personal and intellectual growth to flourish simultaneously and to elevate collaborative practices of teaching and learning. She spent many years as a volunteer at juvenile detention facilities in central Ohio with incarcerated youth, and as a higher education volunteer at the Marion Correctional Institution through the nonprofit organization, Healing Broken Circles.\n\nPlease visit OPEEP: Ohio Prison Education Exchange Project.\n\nWe are building prison-to-college pathways through innovative teaching and collaborative inside-out learning in prison settings.\n\nBook Publications\n\nSettling the Boom: The Sites and Subjects of Bakken Oil (co-edited with Bruce Braun, 2022)\n\nUrban Geography: A Critical Introduction (With Andrew Jonas and Eugene McCann.
