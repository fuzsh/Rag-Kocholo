        "text": "Keri Elizabeth Millikan Turner,42, passed away unexpectedly due to an unknown medical condition on Thursday, August 26th, 2021.\n\nKeri was the first-born daughter of Robyn Allred Millikan and Bernard Worth Millikan. Her love of music and all things theatrical became apparent throughout her early years as she participated in various pageants, choirs and productions. Keri graduated from Randleman High School in 1997 and continued on to become a Carolina Tar Heel with a Bachelor of Arts in Music and a Sociology Degree. Keri's professional life fell in line with the glitz and glam of her personal life. She was an accomplished stylist with an unmatched love for and from her clients. In 2008, Keri reconnected with a high school prom date, Brandon Turner, that would later become her husband and father to their two beautiful babies. The last several years have been dedicated to the care and education of their children as she valiantly took on the title of homeschool mom. Keri was a wearer of many hats; Mother, Wife, Daughter, Sister, Vocalist, Teacher and Friend to name a few. She lived her life to the fullest and her superstar personality was showcased in all that she did.\n\nKeri was preceded in death by her grandparents, Blanche and Bob Allred, Mary Coltrane and Frank Millikan, as well as her father, Bernard Millikan.\n\nShe is survived by her children Eliza Beth and Kenan Turner, husband Brandon Turner, mother Robyn Millikan of Franklinville, sister Tori (Jason) Shina of Canfield, OH, nieces Siena, Sophia and Emily and a multitude of family and friends.\n\nThe family will receive friends Thursday, September 2, 2021 from 9:30 -10:30 am at Mt. Lebanon United Methodist Church. The service will follow at 11:00 am with Rev. Jenna Grogan, Rev. Dr. Kathryn Campbell, and Rev. Joel Bartz. The burial will follow at Randolph Memorial Park, Asheboro.\n\nIn Lieu of flowers, donations can be made to The Partnership for Children of Christians United Outreach Center, P.O. Box 784, Asheboro, NC 27204."
