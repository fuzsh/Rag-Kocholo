        "text": "Do the two of you look for projects to do together?\n\nEWAN McGREGOR Yes. Do you have one? (Laughs) We’re definitely on the lookout.\n\nWhen you first got the script, did you think about Mary right away?\n\nMcGREGOR First I read the script and was very intrigued. I really liked Ben and I was very excited about (director) Sam Miller coming on because I loved “I May Destroy You.” So I was on board. When we started talking about casting, I was very keen to have them think about Mary for the role of Anna. But at first, we didn’t know how much of her story would be in the show. In the book, you turn the page and seven years have gone by and you learn that things have happened between the Count and Anna, but you didn’t see them or read them. So I wanted to know that the part was going to be big enough for Mary to play.\n\nMary, how much of a part did you see on the page?\n\nMARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD Very little. I think I had the first two episodes and obviously I had the novel, so I knew that their relationship was going to blossom over the course of 30 years. But I didn’t know whether they would focus on that. I was given a bit of confidence that it was going to be a great role, even though we didn’t have the scripts yet. And so that was enough for me to jump on board and say yes. And then as the episodes were starting to roll in, I was floored by how beautiful our scenes were and how much the story started to focus on our relationship.\n\nSpeaking of the modern sensibility, Mary, you’re playing a woman who’s trying to establish her own agency in an environment where she’s surrounded by powerful men that she’s expected to please. I imagine that you probably didn’t need to turn to history books for your research.\n\nWINSTEAD (Laughs) I know! Absolutely. Obviously so much of our story is taken from the novel, which is brilliant. But also, Ben wrote these incredible scenes that were informed by the characters and what he imagined them to be going through. I thought it was so astute and true to the experience of so many women—of that time, and now, and of all time. I just was amazed by how much it resonated with me personally. When you get to be the age I’m at now (39), I can look back and see how I was navigating so much of my career trying to please everyone and not to make anyone unhappy, but I was not able to see it for what it was at the time. That comes much later. All of that felt very true.\n\nAt first the relationship between the Count and Anna is charged and sexy and she has the upper hand, but it becomes much more tender. Did playing it change when you found yourselves with your spouse in a story about family?\n\nMcGREGOR Yeah. It’s difficult to describe, really. I’ve had people saying, “Oh, you’ve got to work with your wife” with horror, but it’s such a pleasure to do. When the camera’s rolling, I’m not looking across at my wife. I’m the Count looking at Anna. But we have such an instinct with each other when we’re working, it’s as good as it can get.\n\nWINSTEAD Obviously, it’s amazing to work with someone that you love and also that you respect and admire as an actor. And to me, there was an added benefit of the ease that we have with one another. When you’re starting to work with someone, you don’t know what you’re going to get. (Laughs) And sometimes it can be difficult to go to an emotional place with someone that you maybe have trouble connecting with. That’s obviously not the case with us.\n\nWhen you first played Ramona for the film, did you feel her story was incomplete?\n\nI don’t think I ever felt it was incomplete in terms of wanting to know desperately what was going to happen next or anything like that. I did think that there was a lot more to her that I would have loved to explore. Obviously, when you’re making something that’s based on a book or based on a series of books, there’s going to be a lot more in there than you’re able to capture in one film. So I think I always felt it would be fun to be able to explore all these other little bits and pieces that we didn’t get to see of her in the film.\n\nBut I wasn’t exactly wondering what’s going to happen next because I thought it was such a lovely ending, the way that that film wrapped up and I thought it was really perfect. So whenever ideas about sequels were bandied about, I was sort of like, oh yeah, that’d be great. But I didn’t really ever take it too seriously because I thought it was kind of like the perfect, you know, full circle that the way it was handled in the film.\n\nSo what was your first reaction when, or your initial reaction when you found out that Ramona was going to be the front and center for this series?\n\nYou know, it was really unexpected and lovely. I think I thought it was going to be amazing, but I don’t think I really realized what it was going to feel like until I was there doing it. And I didn’t realize how much it was going to mean to me.\n\nIt really meant a lot to me to be able to have Ramona kind of telling this story in her own way and to be kind of taking the reins because I think for a lot of the film, she was a bit passive, you know, she’s sort of watching all this happen around her and because of her, but there’s only a few kind of points in the movie where she gets to actually kind of take charge. And now in this series, she’s doing it throughout the whole series. And that was incredibly cathartic and meaningful for me to get to do that.\n\nWhat was it like to explore her and like to really dig deep into what caused the pain and how she dealt with it?\n\nI was just so grateful to have the opportunity to do that because, you know, I think it was all kind of there when we were doing the movie and I kind of felt all of these things for her. I really felt a lot of empathy for her in terms of how she was feeling and that vulnerability that she was covering up and that she was afraid of and all of those things.\n\nBut I think, you know, it wasn’t really her story. So we didn’t really get to see so much of what was underneath that guardedness. So I felt really grateful to get to kind of unveil that a little bit more and people behind that curtain and to get to see her have that realization about herself.\n\nYou know, I think in that scene with Roxy is when it really kind of clicks for her, what she’s been doing her whole life that she’s just runs away when she gets scared or when people get too close to her and, you know, and feeling regret for that. And so it was great to get to humanize her in that way, that there are, that she is vulnerable and that she is a loving person, but that she’s afraid. And so I was just really thankful to get to show that because I love her so much as a character."
