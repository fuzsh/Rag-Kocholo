        "text": "In FIRST FAMILY: The McCormicks of Pelee Island, local writer Rick McCormick invites readers to explore the early days of this remarkable Lake Erie island.\n\nHis engaging narrative promises to captivate locals, history enthusiasts, and anyone who has visited Pelee Island.\n\nFollowing the success of his debut book, CAPTIVATING: The Extraordinary Lives of Alexander McCormick & Elizabeth Turner, Rick now unveils his second work.\n\nFIRST FAMILY delves into the rich history of his ancestors, offering a deeper look into the lives that shaped Pelee Island’s heritage.\n\nRick’s latest release explores his family’s colourful past, revealing new insights and stories that enrich the island’s historical tapestry.\n\nRick has deep ties to Essex County through his McCormick lineage, tracing back to his great-great-grandfather who was an 18th-century fur trader.\n\nHis eldest son William is known as the island’s “first white owner” and has a significant role in the book. William’s brother Mathew is the author’s great-grandfather.\n\nFIRST FAMILY: The McCormicks of Pelee Island focuses on William McCormick, his wife Mary Cornwall McCormick and their 13 children. With vivid storytelling and a wealth of historical insight, Rick’s book paints a rich tapestry of the family’s past, making it a must-read for those eager to delve into the origins and enduring legacy of Pelee Island.\n\nRick has been collecting his family’s history since the early 1980s. As a student of historical study, he has designed and co-edited the Harrow Early Immigrant Research Society (HEIRS) newsletter for the past 12 years. With over 100 issues published to date, past issues can be found on the organization’s website at www.HEIRS.ca.\n\nRick’s parents were both born and raised in Essex County. His father owned three drugstores in Ford City during the 1920s. His ancestors were mostly farmers around Harrow with McCormick Sideroad being named after his great grandfather. His sons continued their farming tradition on either side of this road, north of Harrow.\n\nAccording to Rick, members of HEIRS have been encouraged to record their family history before important details are lost forever. It was important for him to “walk the talk” and write the most up-to-date story of the McCormick family of Pelee Island, using today’s research tools and technology.\n\nDigging deeper whenever possible, and rather than just recording birth and death dates, in FIRST FAMILY Rick has collected colourful details that give the reader a broad look at the lives of the island’s earliest extended family.\n\nRick notes that writing a book of this sort is a large undertaking which may explain why so few people make the effort to actually write down their own family story. It’s his hope that some future writer might use FIRST FAMILY as part of their own research.\n\nCompleting the book took Rick five months of daily fact-checking, researching and writing, followed by several weeks of tweaking based on feedback from capable proofreaders.\n\nFor those considering a similar endeavour, Rick offers advice.\n\n“Choose one person of interest in your family and develop their life story or focus on a major event in their life. Even if a book is not in the cards for you, start chatting with grandparents, aunts, and uncles about your family today.”\n\nDocumenting family history is easier today with modern cameras and scanners. Rick recommends making copies of important family photos and documents now, and jotting down short anecdotes as you hear them.\n\nTaking the time to video-record interesting and personal stories told first-hand by relatives ensures they can be shared with future generations. If one delays the collection of these valuable memories, there’s a risk of losing your important family history.\n\nThis was the motivation for Rick.\n\n“I wanted my children and grandchildren to know their ancestors, not just by looking at a gravestone photos, but by knowing their names and character, and understanding what their lives contributed to Pelee Island’s history,” he said.\n\nFIRST FAMILY: The McCormicks of Pelee Island is available at Pelee ArtWorks, a non-profit organization that was established in 1995 to create a centre for arts and culture on Pelee island. If you’re visiting the island, you will find Pelee ArtWorks at 82 East West Road.\n\nArtWorks is open 7 days a week from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. They can be reached by phone at 226-918-5825.\n\n.\n\nON AMAZON\n\nTo purchase:\n\nRick’s new book FIRST FAMILY: The McCormicks of Pelee Island\n\nClick here"
