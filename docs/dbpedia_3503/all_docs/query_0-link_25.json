Much love, Katie Crawford Wynne\n\n- Katie Crawford Wynne, Virginia Beach, Virginia\n\nI thought that I was living a life on my own terms in a bubble until I met Martha. I don’t know how we even evolved into the closest of friends because I don’t remember me without her. When I met Martha I met someone as silly, quirky, fun, loved with her whole heart, and was the best mom and wife ever. Martha made going to the gas station fun! We traveled to many places, shared heartfelt stories, and we never had a bad time even when I cried she made me laugh. My life will never be the same without Martha, but her love, fun spirit, and passion for life will always shine on in Haley, Turner, and Caroline. I am blessed for having known such a wonderful woman. Martha changed my life for the better. I will take what I learned from her and keep on being my silly self always looking for a side-eye glance.

May God give them strength and may she rest in peace\n\n- Ricky Burnsed, Midway, Ha.\n\nMartha always brought a smile to my face every time I saw her.
