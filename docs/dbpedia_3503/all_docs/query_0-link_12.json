        "text": "CHRISTIANSBURG -- The family of the Christiansburg High School freshman who died recently from a drug overdose plans soon to tour area schools and speak with senior citizens to share their story about the dangers of drug abuse.\n\nMary Elizabeth Turner, 15, was pronounced brain dead at 4 a.m. Saturday at Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital.\n\nMary had a loving heart. She was sweet and shy, and even if she didn't always burst with smiles she loved people, her family said Thursday.\n\nShane Guynn, Mary's cross country coach at Christiansburg High, called her a \"quiet leader,\" and friends said her wit was unmatchable. Mary used it often to lighten the mood or to entertain friends and family.\n\n\"She didn't have to try to be funny,\" said 17-year-old former girlfriend Amber Anderson. \"That's what made her great. She didn't need to impress anybody.\"\n\nMary was a creative girl who loved her younger brothers, her friends and the outdoors. She was a quick study who picked up knitting and the guitar early and even dabbled in percussion.\n\nBut those things weren't enough, and Mary had turned to recreational drugs several years ago.\n\nOn May 13, she had snorted oxycodone with a friend after school, and family members said they think she may have taken Valium and smoked methamphetamine later that night.\n\nThe concoction proved fatal.\n\nMary's mother, Angela Petersheim, found her daughter unresponsive the next day. Mary was lying on her back, hands clenched, unable to move and gasping for air. She never regained consciousness.\n\nTests at the hospital showed Mary had opiates in her system. If she recovered, doctors said, she would be partially paralyzed.\n\nThe family didn't give up hope.\n\nThe overdose had caused brain damage, but she was still alive.\n\n\"There was still a viable person in there,\" said Janet Giovanetti, the mother of Petersheim's fiance, Ralph Giovanetti.\n\nThey clung to her side, but her blood pressure continued to crash and rebound. Mary finally stopped fighting Saturday morning.\n\nHer family was left with a gut-wrenching decision. They elected to donate her organs and removed her from life support Monday.\n\nOnce they heal from the loss, Petersheim and Giovanetti want to crusade against drug use, in hope of saving young lives.\n\n\"It would be a waste to lose just one more child,\" Janet Giovanetti said. \"Parents need to take more interest in what their children are doing.\"\n\nIn Mary's case, they did.\n\nPetersheim knew her daughter needed help.\n\nMary had a history of drug abuse.\n\nWhen she was 12, Ralph Giovanetti found a pen cap with what appeared to be crushed pills in her room.\n\n\"A lot of friends knew and just were afraid to say anything,\" Petersheim said.\n\nPetersheim and Giovanetti worked with her to get help, and Mary did stop abusing drugs for a while.\n\nBut the drug use, mostly prescriptions or cough medicine, coincided with bouts of depression. Mary was hospitalized in her early teens because of the condition.\n\nShe was sad and angry, more than the typical teen, her family said.\n\nFirst, she lashed out at school, and then she turned her anger inward, Petersheim said.\n\nCounseling helped some, but the depression never subsided fully.\n\nPetersheim can pinpoint in photos where her daughter started to wander from the amused, smiling blue-eyed young girl to a more troubled teen.\n\nHer eyes turned dark and the smile into a smirk or a sullen look.\n\nFriends said the drugs may have helped her cope.\n\nBut Janet Giovanetti said Mary thought they also helped make her fit in at school.\n\n\"Mary was cool without the drugs,\" she said.\n\nUnfortunately, what others thought wasn't enough, family said. Drugs filled a void.\n\nIt's a problem with which many young people in the area grapple, the family suspects.\n\n\"I think we're still very naive,\" Giovanetti said. \"People just don't know about the interaction with drugs. They don't realize that tweens even, they get their hands on cold medication [and other drugs] and they get their high off of that.\"\n\nThe National Institutes of Health's Institute on Drug Abuse concurs. Its Monitoring the Future survey shows that nearly one in 10 high school seniors nationwide reported nonmedical use of opiates such as Vicodin, while one in 20 reported abuse of OxyContin, a brand of oxycodone.\n\nOf those who admitted using opiates, about 66 percent said they were given the drugs or bought them from a friend or relative, according to the survey.\n\nTo keep Mary's death from being in vain, Giovanetti said she wants to reach students before high school, as well as grandparents and family members from whom they might obtain the drugs.\n\nAmber, a Christiansburg High junior, thinks it's a good idea.\n\n\"Kids think that they're invincible, and look what happens,\" she said. \"Read the obituaries. She thought she could handle it, and she couldn't.\"\n\nTeen users need to know, \"no you're not invincible, you need help,\" Amber said.\n\nFor now, the knowledge that Mary's heart already has found a recipient is giving Petersheim and her family some solace. They say they know Mary will always be with them and that as an organ donor, she is helping others like she always wanted.\n\nFuneral services will be at 2 p.m. today in the chapel of Horne Funeral Home in Christiansburg.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
