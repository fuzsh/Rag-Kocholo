        "text": "By Elizabeth Strout\n\nI don’t know how Elizabeth Strout does it. Every report from the world of Lucy Barton and Olive Kitteridge and dear Bob Burgess holds me spellbound. I sit down thinking, Is this going to work? Can she do it again? And I stand up thinking, This is the best one of all. There is a directness and clarity in the writing that could be confused with simplicity, but it’s the least simple thing in the world. As readers we are taken in, as one is taken into the confidence of a friend. The story pours out and we gratefully accept it. I don’t know anyone who writes like Elizabeth Strout, and I find her work wildly inspiring. She makes me want to be a better writer.\n\nBut what if you’ve never read her before? What if the names Lucy and Olive and Bob mean nothing to you? Don’t worry. Life is a narrative, and you can jump in anywhere you want. It will all make sense, and then you’ll have the supreme pleasure of going back to read all the Strout novels that came before.\n\nWhat is Tell Me Everything about? Love and friendship. Loss and regret. Everything and nothing at all. In that way it is very much like life. I loved it, and I’m betting you will, too.\n\nAnn Patchett"
