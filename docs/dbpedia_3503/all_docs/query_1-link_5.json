Also, I am confident that his unique experiences as an All-American athlete will be invaluable to our student-athletes as they continue to grow and develop.”\n\nHubaker worked with Rinker at Eastern Michigan last season, primarily with the women’s distance athletes in terms of administering work-outs while managing recruiting responsibilities. During his time with the Eagles, he helped coach three individual MAC champions in the mile, 800 and 3,000 meters along with three individual runner-up finishers in the 5K and the 10K. He also assisted in helping the EMU women’s team to the 2023-24 MAC Indoor Track and Field Championships.\n\nPrior to his time at Eastern Michigan, Hubaker was on the staff at his alma mater the University of Michigan for one season, where he assisted the coaching staff in all recruiting duties including assembling recruiting classes and leading recruiting visits.\n\nHubaker competed at Michigan from 2017-2022, earning Second Team All-American honors in the steeplechase in 2021. He also served as the team captain for the Wolverines and graduated with a degree in sport management."
