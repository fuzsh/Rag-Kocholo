        "text": "MEMPHIS (UPI)—Proud Mary, a tugboat with a 73-year-old history that inspired a 1971 hit record, is no longer “roltin’ down the river.”\n\nThe tug, now called the Mary Elizabeth, has been tied to a Memphis dock for two years. It has a rusted hull, peeling paint, a fire‐wracked deckhouse and an uncertain future,\n\nBut J. L. Murphy, owner of the boat since 1973, does not want to abandon it.\n\n“I don't know what I'm going to do with it,” Mr. Murphy said, “but I would like to refurbish it.”\n\nThe boat wasmade famous by the hlt song “Proud Mary,” by Creedence Clearwater Revival. Ike and Tina Turner made another popular recording of the song about two years later.\n\nR. V. Warner, the boat's skipper and a former owner, said the Mary Elizabeth was built in Newburgh, N. Y., in 1905. Originally powered by steam, the tug was used to ferry prisoners from New York to Sing Sing prison.\n\nLater, the vessel was equipped with a diesel engine and used as a ferry across Lake Pontchartrain to New Orleans, In 1928, Mr. Warner brought the boat to Tennessee. Until recently, it was used as a harbor boat in Memphis."
