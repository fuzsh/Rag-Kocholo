        "text": "NAVASOTA — More than 1,200 people crowded into Brosig Auditorium on Friday for the funeral of Navasota civic leader and businessman Lonnie Turner.\n\nThe racially mixed crowd included Grimes County Judge Ira E. “Bud” Haynie, District Clerk Wayne Rucker, Navasota Mayor Pat Gruner and City Councilwoman Mildred Edwards.\n\nThe 54-year-old Turner, a beloved figure in the community known for his volunteer and charity efforts, was shot to death a week earlier in his south Navasota home. His body was discovered by his 21-year-old son, Lonnie Turner Jr.\n\nAuthorities have made no arrest in the killing.\n\nTurner, who owned the Jones Funeral Home branches in Navasota and Caldwell, was remembered by his sister, Frankie Turner Manning, as a man who “loved this community and believed it is an extension of the family.”\n\nDuring the burial later at Rest Haven Cemetery, the Rev. Roland Booker, took note of the large crowd that had turned out for the funeral.\n\nAddressing Turner’s mother, Mary Elizabeth Turner, Booker said, “When Lonnie was a little boy, you probably told him to grow up and be a good man. Now you can know, as witnessed by all these people here today, that he was a good man.”\n\nThough the funeral arrangements were handled by Turner’s Navasota funeral home, the owners and personnel of other funeral homes gathered Friday to do the things Turner and his own staff would have done — directing traffic, seating those attending and moving flowers from the auditorium to the cemetery as the service concluded.\n\n• David Sullens’ e-mail address is\n\ndsullens@aol.com\n\n.\n\nTurner\n\nTurner\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
