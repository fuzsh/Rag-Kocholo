        "meta_description": "&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMary (DeFelice) Turner, 85, of Shadyside, died Friday, June 28, 2013 at Belmont Community Hospital in Bellaire. Born in Bellaire on September 3, 1927, she was the youngest child of the late Julio and Meri (Panone) DeFelice. She was a 1945 graduate of St. John High School in Bellaire and was a former employee of the G.C. Murphy Company. Mary was a member of St. Mary Catholic Church in Shadyside.\r\n\r\nMary lived her entire life within five miles of where she was born—not one to travel, she was most comfortable in her kitchen at home.  She will always be remembered by family and friends for her delicious cooking--especially her spaghetti and meatballs. No one ever left hungry because she always fixed enough food to feed a small army.\r\n\r\nOn June 13, 2013, Mary celebrated 60 years of marriage to Robert L. “Bob” Turner who survives along with four children: Robert (Catherine) Turner of Shelby; Mary Chuckery (Don Crozier) of Shadyside; Louis (Heather) Turner of Springfield; and Joanne Misenhelder of Bridgeport. Eight grandchildren: Aaron Turner of Lexington; Adam (Elizabeth) Turner of Beavercreek; Alyse Turner of Shelby; Antonia, Annmeri, and Dominic Turner of Springfield; Stephanie and Anthony Chuckery of Shadyside; 1 great-granddaughter, Christa Berry. Also surviving is her sister, Emma Closser, of Kenton.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her parents, Mary was preceded in death by a sister, Agnes Copper in 1997; brother, Adam DeFelice in 2000, and a brother who died in infancy.\r\n\r\nFriends may call on Tuesday, July 2, 2013 from 2-4 and 6-8 at the Bauknecht-Altmeyer Funeral Home, 3900 Central Avenue, Shadyside, where a vigil service will be held at 7:30 PM. Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated on Wednesday at 10:30 AM at St. Mary Catholic Church in Shadyside, Fr. Samuel R. Saprano officiating. Burial will be in Mt. Calvary Cemetery in Bellaire. Memorial expressions may be made to St. John Central High School, St. Mary Catholic Church, or the OR&amp;W Fire District Shadyside.
