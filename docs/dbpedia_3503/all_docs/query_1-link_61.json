        "text": "martygrant.com Home > Genealogy > Bryson > Families > William\n\n[Commentary] [Children] [Researcher List] [Register Report] [A Note about sources] [How to contact me] [Home]\n\nI (Marty Grant) am a 1st cousin 7 times removed to William Bryson.\n\nSpecial thanks to Lawrence Wood (1937-1997), Ethel Updike (1899-?) and James Hardy Bryson (1870-1941) for their various write-ups on this family.\n\nFirst of all I should note that there were several men named \"William Bryson\" in Western NC in the early to mid 1800's. However, this William seems to be the only one (for a couple of decades anyway) in the Haywood and Macon County area for some time. I don't think that I have confused him with any of the other Williams. For the record, his Uncle William M. Bryson (c1750) remained in the Buncombe County area (now Henderson County), His cousins of the same name also lived in different counties, though not too far away.\n\nWilliam Bryson was born ca 1775/80 (per census analysis). Ethel Updike lists \"ca. 1778\", which fits within the range given by the census records. I'm not sure where he was born for he died prior to the 1850 census (which listed birth places). His three children who survived to the 1880 census showed different birth places for their father. Two of them showed North Carolina (which works) and one showed Virginia (which seems unlikely). Based only on this, I'd say that William was likely born in North Carolina, probably in either Rowan (now Iredell) County, or in Lincoln (now Catawba) County. I don't know for sure where his parents were residing in the late 1770's.\n\nWilliam Bryson is a son of James Holmes Bryson (1740/50) and Sarah Countryman. I've seen no primary evidence proving this connection, but several early family histories (written in the 1800's) list this William as James' son, and I see no reason to doubt it. He does fit there circumstantially as well.\n\nIt seems very likely that William was named for his Uncle William M. Bryson (c1750).\n\nWilliam's parents were in Lincoln (now Catawba) County in the 1780's, and they left Lincoln County between 1787 and 1790 and moved to Pendleton District, South Carolina. William undoubtedly grew up in both of these places.\n\nWilliam would have been between 10 and 15 years old by the 1790 census, and was apparently home with his parents in Pendleton District, SC aged \"under 16\" (born ca 1774/90).\n\nIn the late 1790's, William's parents moved to Buncombe County, North Carolina and settled near the French Broad River.\n\nWilliam would have been between 10 and 25 years old by the time of the 1800 census. He seems to be listed with his parents for that census in the age 16-25 age group (born ca 1774/84).\n\nWilliam Bryson married Elizabeth Turner sometime between 1800 and ca 1802 in Buncombe County. She was born ca 1780/90 (per census analysis) in North Carolina (county unknown). She is a proven child of Joseph Turner and Mary ---, as proven by a deed from 1815.\n\nIn 1806, residents of Western Buncombe County made a petition requesting the formation of a new county (Haywood County), and William Bryson was one of the signers. This is most likely this William, for the other William (his Uncle) did not live in that part of Buncombe County. The new county was created in 1808, and many of the Buncombe County Brysons fell into the new county, or moved there shortly afterwards.\n\nFor the 1810 census, William Bryson was listed in Haywood County. Unfortunately only his name is legible, but his enumerations are not. Unfortunately, this census was alphabetical, so I can't tell who their neighbors were, nor where they might have been living.\n\nIn late 1819, William's nephew William H. Bryson (1798) came of age, and he lived nearby, so there is the possibility of mixing up their records, though the younger William almost always used his middle initial.\n\nWilliam was listed on the 1820 census in Haywood County. Unfortunately, this census was alphabetical, so I can't tell who their neighbors were, nor where they might have been living.\n\n1820 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1820 Haywood Co, NC pg 213 William Bryson 320010-30110 Analysis: 1 Male(s) 26-44 (1775-1794) William BRYSON (1775/80) s/o James & Sarah 2 Male(s) 10-15 (1804-1810) James M.

William did not appear on the list until 1833, so apparently he didn't join this church right away. I'm assuming this is the same Elizabeth, but it is possible it is someone else. (First Baptist Church Register, Microfilm copy at North Carolina Archives).\n\nElizabeth Bryson was listed as a member of the First Baptist Church in 1827. (First Baptist Church Register, Microfilm copy at North Carolina Archives).\n\nIn 1828 a Petition was filed by Haywood County residents requesting the formation of Macon County from the Southwestern part of Haywood. Among the signers were William Bryson, who listed his family as containing 2 males over 21, 2 males under 21, 4 females, and 1 \"colored\" person. This works out to be: 2 Males over 21 (born before ca 1807): William himself and son James; 2 males under 21 (born ca 1807/1828) being sons William and Joseph, and the 4 females being wife Elizabeth, and daughters Sarah, Elizabeth and Martha.\n\nIn 1828, Macon County was formed from the western portion of Haywood County, and included the area where the William Bryson family resided.\n\nOn 24 Sep 1828, William Bryson (and Gray Crowe) witnessed a deed from David Peake to John Lamm. (Macon Co, NC Deed Book A page 9 from \"Records of Old Macon County, N.C. 1829-1850\" compiled by Barbara Sears McRae, 1991. * Note: All deeds mentioned hereafter from books \"A\" through \"E\" are taken from this book.)\n\nElizabeth Bryson was listed as a member of the First Baptist Church in 1828. (First Baptist Church Register, Microfilm copy at North Carolina Archives).\n\nElizabeth Bryson was listed as a member of the First Baptist Church in 1829. (First Baptist Church Register, Microfilm copy at North Carolina Archives).\n\nWilliam Bryson was listed on the 1830 census in Macon County. He was not listed near other Brysons, though several were just a page away. His neighbors on either side were Ebenezer Scroggs and Barcley Willson.\n\n1830 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1830 Macon Co, NC pg 24 William Bryson 0020000100000-0012001000000 Analysis: 1 Male(s) 50-59 (1770-1780) William BRYSON (1775/80) s/o James & Sarah 2 Male(s) 10-14 (1815-1820) William Hailing BRYSON (1814/15) son > m 1835 Joseph Byers BRYSON (1819/20) son 1 Female(s) 40-49 (1780-1790) Elizabeth TURNER Bryson (1780/90) wife 2 Female(s) 15-19 (1810-1815) Martha BRYSON (1809) daughter m by 1840 Elizabeth BRYSON (1811) daughter m by 1831 1 Female(s) 10-14 (1815-1820) Sarah BRYSON (1813) daughter m by 1831\n\nElizabeth Bryson was listed as a member of the First Baptist Church in 1830. (First Baptist Church Register, Microfilm copy at North Carolina Archives).\n\nElizabeth Bryson was listed as a member of the First Baptist Church in 1831. (First Baptist Church Register, Microfilm copy at North Carolina Archives).\n\nElizabeth Bryson was listed as a member of the First Baptist Church in 1832. This same year (on 6 Oct 1832), William Bryson was received as a member. (First Baptist Church Register, Microfilm copy at North Carolina Archives).\n\nWilliam and Elizabeth Bryson were listed on the 1833 membership list of the First Baptist Church. (First Baptist Church Register, Microfilm copy at North Carolina Archives).\n\nOn 8 Oct 1833, William Bryson Sr and several others made a bond of $10,000 for John Tatham to become Clerk of Court for the next term. The other bondsmen were Richard Wilson Sr, Thomas Tatham Sr, John Wilson, John Dobson, John Dillard, Zachariah Cabe, James Poteet, and Christopher Setser. (Macon Co, NC Deed Book A page 204).\n\nWilliam and Elizabeth Bryson were listed on the 1834 membership list of the First Baptist Church. (First Baptist Church Register, Microfilm copy at North Carolina Archives).\n\nWilliam and Elizabeth Bryson were listed on the 1835 membership list of the First Baptist Church. I did not read the film beyond this year. (First Baptist Church Register, Microfilm copy at North Carolina Archives).\n\nWilliam Bryson voted in the 1835 Congressional Elections. He was listed as having voted in Macon County in Franklin Precinct.\n\nWilliam Bryson died on 27 Feb 1837 (source?) in Macon County, and is supposedly buried at Sugar Fork Baptist Church Cemetery.\n\nAlthough he was dead by then, William received a State Land Grant on 15 Dec 1838 for 50 acres on Sugartown Fork of Tennessee River \"at Head of John Bryson's branch\", entered 2 May 1836. (Macon Co, NC Deed Book B page 1108).\n\nOn 24 Dec 1838, William Bryson and Barrack Norton, Thomas Millsapps and John Dobson received a 50 acre State Land Grant on White Water Creek. On the same date, the same men (plus David Millsaps) received a 100 acre grant on Toxaway River. (Macon Co, NC Deed Book B page 723, 724).\n\nWidow Elizabeth Bryson was listed as head of household on the 1840 census in Macon County. She was next door to son William Bryson, and next to Elijah Cox. No other Brysons were close by.\n\n1840 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1840 Macon Co, NC pg 149 Elizabeth Bryson 0000100000000-0000000100000 Analysis: 1 Male(s) 20-29 (1810-1820) Joseph Byers BRYSON (1819/20) son --> Hd 1850 1 Female(s) 50-59 (1780-1790) Elizabeth TURNER Bryson (1780/90) wd/o William\n\nOn 10 Jul 1843, Elizabeth Jane Bryson received a State Land Grant of 200 acres on George's Creek of Toxaway River, entered 27 Aug 1843 (after it was granted? One of these dates must be wrong). I don't know who this is for sure, but it could be Elizabeth, widow of William Bryson, however, I think this should actually say Elizabeth Jane Cunningham instead since the land adjoined two of her sisters (Magdelena Cunningham Bryson and Mary Ann Cunningham Bryson). I could be wrong about this, but I've seen nothing (so far) to indicate that Elizabeth Turner Bryson had a middle name of \"Jane\". (Macon Co, NC Deed Book D page 1665).\n\nOn 10 Sep 1844 the heirs of William Bryson deeded several tracts to Elijah Kimzey (also an heir). They were listed as: Elizabeth Bryson, Mary Murry, Jefferson Bryson, John T. Bryson, John Phillips and wife Elizabeth, William Bryson and Joseph Bryson. The tracts were on Sugarfork River between Elijah (Ellijay) and Nickajack, being 50 acres and 48 acres. Witnesses were Peter McClure and Henry Barrony. George McClure witnessed for Joseph Bryson, and J. R. Siler witnessed Phillips and wife. (Macon Co, NC Deed Book E page 4)\n\nI did not find Elizabeth on the 1850 census.\n\nChildren\n\nWilliam Bryson and Elizabeth Jane Turner had seven children as proven by several sources, including some deeds in the 1840's. Ethel Updike added three more children: James M. Bryson and Nancy Bryson Honnicutt (c1805), wife of Jehodiah Honnicutt and Martha Bryson Tatham. I can accept James, but I don't think Nancy belongs here, for she was not named in any of the deeds among William's heirs, nor does she fit based on census analysis. However, I'm leaving her for the time being. Hardy Bryson mentioned only sons Jefferson, Joseph and John. He did mention James or William nor any of the daughters of William Bryson Sr.\n\nMary \"Polly Bryson (c1802)\n\nJames M. Bryson (1804/10)\n\nNancy Bryson (c1805)\n\nThomas Jefferson Bryson (1806)\n\nJohn Turner Bryson (c1808)\n\nMartha Bryson (c1809)\n\nElizabeth Bryson (1811)\n\nSarah Bryson (1813)\n\nWilliam Hailing Bryson (c1815)\n\nJoseph Byers Bryson (c1820)\n\nMary \"Polly Bryson was born ca \"1802\" (source?), presumably in Buncombe (now Haywood) Co, NC. She is a proven child of William Bryson as proven by an 1843 deed and an 1844 deed, both naming her as an heir.\n\nShe was probably with her parents for the 1810 census, though that census is illegible. She was apparently home with them in 1820 (age 16-25, born ca 1794/1804).\n\nShe married John M. Murray between 1820 and ca 1824, presumably in Haywood (now Macon) Co, NC. No marriage record was found. The 1843 and 1844 deeds I mentioned earlier prove that Mary was married to a \"Murry\", but do not list her husband's given name.\n\nThey were listed on the 1830 census in Macon County just a couple of houses from brother Jefferson Bryson and from John's widowed mother Margaret.\n\n1830 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1830 Macon Co, NC pg 31 John M. Murry 1000100000000-1200100000000 Analysis: 1 Male(s) 20-29 (1800-1810) John M.

MURRAY (1825) daughter 1 Female(s) 0-4 (1825-1830) Mary Malinda MURRAY (1829) daughter\n\nOn 19 Dec 1834, John Murry of Macon sold land to John Redman. Witnesses were Daniel Cook and John T. Bryson (brother-in-law). (Macon Co, NC Deed Book A page 248).\n\nI was unable to locate them on the 1840 census, but they may have been in Union Co, GA then, though not listed on the census that year.\n\nJohn M. Murray seems to have died between ca 1841 and ca 1843, probably in Union Co, GA.\n\nOn 26 Jan 1843 Mary Mury of Union Co, GA sold \"all my right\" in the estate of William Bryson, deceased, on Sugar Fork, to Elijah Kimzey (brother-in-law), for $80. She signed with a mark. Witnesses were John Brown and Ebenezer Fain. (Macon Co, NC Deed Book D page 1893).\n\nOn 10 Sep 1844, Mary Murry and her mother and siblings sold more of the William Bryson estate. (Macon Co, NC Deed Book E page 4).\n\nMary Bryson Murray died between 1844 and 1850 in Union Co, GA.\n\nAll of the unmarried children were living together in Union Co, GA in 1850. They were two houses from John Redmon whom their father had sold land in Macon Co, NC in 1834. Perhaps they were related somehow.\n\n1850 census abstract: (Explanation of this census)\n\n(Note: The dates at the end of each line are not part of the original census, but are approximate birth years based on age)\n\n1850 UNION CO, GA Page 274 House/Family # 1004/1004 - Twp MURRAY W C 23 M W FARMER NC 1826/1827 MURRAY BETSEY 25 F W NC 1824/1825 MURRAY MARINDA 20 F W NC 1829/1830 MURRAY JANE 18 F W NC 1831/1832 MURRAY PERRY 15 M W LABORER NC 1834/1835 MURRAY REBECCA 12 F W NC 1837/1838 MURRAY JOHN 10 M W NC 1839/1840\n\nWilliam and sister Elizabeth and brother John were listed on the 1860 census in Fannin Co, GA (formed 1854 from Union and Gilmer). I found one sibling in neighboring Rabun Co, GA, but I did not find the rest in 1860.\n\nJames M. Bryson was born ca 1804/10 (per census analysis), presumably in Haywood Co, NC. He is not a proven son of William and Elizabeth, but both Updike and Wood list him here. They said that other descendants in the William family remembered there being a brother named James. He does match up with an unknown son per the 1820 census, and he did marry a sister of Mary Bryson Murray's husband. That does not prove they were siblings, but it is suggestive of such.\n\nHe was probably with his parents for the 1810 census, though that census is illegible. He was apparently home with them in 1820 (age 10-15, born ca 1804/10). He did not seem to be at home in 1830. He would have been over 21 then, so could have been anywhere. Someone his age was with James Holmes Bryson (1740/50) (his grandfather) in 1830 and that could be James M. Bryson, but there is no way to be sure.\n\nOn 20 Nov 1832, James M. Bryson obtained a marriage bond in Macon County to marry Margaret Murray daughter of James (his name was on bond as her father). Margaret is a sister to James M. Murray who married Mary Bryson, James M. Bryson's sister.\n\nOn 20 Dec 1833, James M. Bryson sold 52 acres to John Tatham land apparently being land which Tatham conveyed \"to my wife Margaret, by name of Margaret Mury\". I'm not sure what this means, but apparently Tatham had already deeded it to Margaret, but James was paying for it? Witnesses were William F. McKee and William Sorrells. I don't know which John Tatham this was. The elder John (1774) was married to a Murray, probably an Aunt of Margaret. The younger John (1799) was soon to become James' brother-in-law. William F. McKee later married a first cousin of James', being a daughter of James Bryson Sr (1775/80). (Macon Co, NC Deed Book A page 167).\n\nBefore 20 Feb 1837 (date deed was registered), a mortgage deed was made by several parties, and James M. Bryson was mentioned. It is not clear who was the main party to this deed: Joseph Welch of Macon to John H. Chinnof Monroe Co, TN of 2nd Part, John McGhee of Monroe CO, TN of 3rd part, note executed by Welch and James M. Bryson, James Angel, Edmond McElder, Thomas Welch, James Truet and Robert Hall. Witnessed by S. McDowell and J. K. Gray. (Macon Co, NC Deed Book A page 317).\n\nJames was not listed on the 1840 census in Macon County. There was a James M. Bryson in Gilmer Co, GA in 1840. His age is right, so this may be him. He was three houses from an apparent widow Jane Bryson (c1790). I have not been able to identify her yet. She was obviously closely related to James M. Bryson. If it turns out that he is not a son of William and Elizabeth, then could Jane be his mother? There is also the possibility that this is not the same James M. Bryson. He was next door to Jacob Stewart (1777).\n\n1840 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1840 Gilmer Co, GA pg 14 James M. Bryson 0000010000000-1000010000000 Analysis: 1 Male(s) 30-39 (1800-1810) James M.

Bryson was not named in the 1844 deed where the heirs of William Bryson sold their shares. This could mean that he was dead by then, or that he was not an heir.\n\nHe was dead before 1850, for Margaret was listed as head of household on the census that year in Gilmer Co, GA.\n\n1850 census abstract: (Explanation of this census)\n\n(Note: The dates at the end of each line are not part of the original census, but are approximate birth years based on age)\n\n1850 GILMER CO, GA Page 405B House/Family # 805/ 805 - SUBDIVISION NO 33 Twp BRYSON MARGARET 48 F W NC 1801/1802 BRYSON ALFRED J 15 M W FARMER NC 1834/1835\n\nI did not find Margaret on the 1860 census. There was a Joseph A. Bryson listed in 1860 in Gilmer who was the same age as Alfred J. Bryson. Is it the same person? The initials and age match.\n\nNancy Bryson was born ca 1804/05 (per 1850 and 1860 census), in North Carolina somewhere. I have serious doubts as to whether Nancy belongs in this family. She was not named in any of the Estate divisions of William Bryson (in the early 1840's), yet she lived long past that time. She also does not fit into William's 1820 census household. However, Ethel Updike and Lawrence Wood included her in this family based on the word of Elizabeth Wright Prince (1893), a Great Granddaughter of William Bryson. She referred to her as \"Aunt Nancy\" and Lawrence Wood said that she (Nancy) planted the seeds for an Apple Tree at William Bryson's home, the fruit of which was later called the \"Cullasaja Apple\".\n\nThere could be several explanations for this. First, she could be a child of William and Elizabeth, but not listed in the 1844 deed naming the heirs. That could be perhaps because she had already disposed of her share. Secondly, she may be an \"Aunt\" in name only, as in an elder friend of the family affectionately called \"Aunt\". Third, she could be an Aunt, but not via the Bryson family, but through another connection. Since the family tradition is all we have to go on, I'm going to leave her here in this family, but with a serious need for some proof. Does anyone have any evidence for these two facts: 1- Is Nancy a Bryson? What is the evidence?. 2- Is she William and Elizabeth's daughter? What is the evidence?\n\nI have recently found several Honnicutt (Hunnicutt) researchers who list this Nancy as a McCall. None of them had any proof to go with it, but I would bet this is correct. In case it is not, I'll still outline this family here, but you will note that Nancy is not included in the Register Report below.\n\nNancy may have been home with her parents for the 1810 census, unfortunately the enumerations for William Bryson in 1810 are illegible.\n\nIn 1820 William Bryson had three daughters \"under 10\" or born ca 1810/20, and none in the 10-15 group (born ca 1804/10), and one in the 16-25 group (born ca 1794/1804). The three younger daughters are proven to be Martha (c1809), Elizabeth (1811) and Sarah (1813). The older one is Mary (c1802). That leaves no room for Nancy in the home. Since she was about 15 then, she could easily have been living with another family as a servant or house keeper.\n\nNancy married Jehodia Honnicutt before ca 1827, presumably in Haywood (now Macon) Co, NC. He was born ca 1799/1800 (per 1850 census) in North Carolina somewhere. I don't know who his parents were, but there was a James Honnicutt (c1785) in Macon in 1830. He may be too young to be his father, but could be an older brother or Uncle. James had moved to Rabun Co, GA shortly after 1830. I think they are probably brothers, for both Jehodia and James were School Teachers, and occupations often \"ran in the family\".\n\nI have not been able to find Jehodia Honnicutt on the 1830 census. James Honnicutt was the only one of that surname in Macon County that year. There was a William Honeycut (1800/10) in Franklin Co, GA in 1830. You'll understand why I mention this as you read on.\n\nBased on the birth places of their children, I can track this family somewhat, however there is some contradictory data. Daughter Amanda was born ca 1827 in NC (per 1850 and 1880 census). Son Warren was born ca 1832 in Georgia (per 1850 census) or in North Carolina (per 1860 census). Son Madison was born ca 1835 in GA (per 1850 census) or in South Carolina (per 1860 census). It seems certain that this family was in Georgia by 1839.\n\nThe 1840 census shows Jehodia Honnicutt in Franklin County, Georgia. I don't know what drew them there, but I mentioned before that a William Honnicutt had been there in 1830 (but he was gone by 1840). I don't know what (if any) relationship there was between them, but they could certainly be brothers. There were no Brysons in Franklin Co, GA that I'm aware of.\n\n1840 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1840 Franklin Co, GA pg 317 Jehoyta Honycut 2100001000000-1020010000000 Analysis: 1 Male(s) 40-49 (1790-1800) Jehodia HONNICUTT (1799/1800) 1 Male(s) 5-9 (1830-1835) Warren L.

They were living somewhere near Gum Log or Ivy Log which is close to Cherokee Co, NC border. Their neighbors included several relatives of mine (but not related to the Brysons) including my Uncle and Aunt Thomas Erwin and wife Mary Patterson Erwin and my ancestor Mary Murphy Wright just two houses away. Although there were several Brysons in Union County in 1850, none of them were nearby. They all lived in the sections that became Fannin County (in 1854) and Towns County (in 1856). The Honnicutts lived in the section that remained Union County, but close to the Towns County line. They were the only ones of their surname in the county in 1850.\n\n1850 census abstract: (Explanation of this census)\n\n(Note: The dates at the end of each line are not part of the original census, but are approximate birth years based on age)\n\n1850 UNION CO, GA Page 213 House/Family # 157/ 157 - 85TH DISTRICT Twp HONEYCUT GEHOIDA 50 M W TEACHER NC 1799/1800 HONEYCUT NANCY 45 F W NC 1804/1805 HONEYCUT AMANDA 23 F W NC 1826/1827 HONEYCUT WARREN 18 M W FARMER GA 1831/1832 HONEYCUT MADISON 15 M W FARMER GA 1834/1835 HONEYCUT WILLIAM 11 M W GA 1838/1839 HONEYCUT ALBERT 7 M W GA 1842/1843 HONEYCUT ROBERT 3 M W GA 1846/1847 HONEYCUT FLOYD 1 M W GA 1848/1849\n\nThey were still in Union County for the 1860 census.

In 1853 Hart County was formed from the eastern portion of Franklin, and this seems to be the area where they moved back to. I'm only assuming that was where they had lived in the 1840's.\n\nI was unable to find Jehodia and Nancy in 1870. I don't have an 1870 census index, but they were not in Union County that year, nor in Shoal Creek Township of Hart County (where daughter Amanda was living in 1870 and 1880). They may have died in the 1860's, or been somewhere else in Georgia in 1870.\n\nI was unable to locate them in 1880 either, so they were probably dead by then.\n\nThomas Jefferson Bryson was born 27 Nov 1806 (source?) in Buncombe (now Haywood) Co, NC. He is a proven son of William and Elizabeth as named in an 1844 deed.\n\nHe married Ellen Sidney Tatham before ca 1827. They lived in Macon Co, NC, later in Cherokee Co, NC, and then moved to Georgia, living in Forsyth and Dekalb Co, GA.\n\nSee their own page for additional information.\n\nJohn Turner Bryson was born \"1808\" (source?) in Haywood Co, NC. He is a proven son of William and Elizabeth as named in an 1844 deed.\n\nHe married Susan Redmond in the 1820's. They lived in Macon Co, NC later in Union (now Fannin) Co, GA.\n\nSee their own page for additional information.\n\nMartha Bryson was born ca 1809 (source?) presumably in Haywood County. I don't know what proof there is that Martha was a Bryson, nor what proof there is that she was a child of William and Elizabeth. She was not named in the 1844 deed naming the heirs of William Bryson. Ethel Updike did not include her in this family, but Lawrence Wood did, but offered no sources as to why he put her here. She does not fit very well into the census enumerations of her parents, so that also works against including her here.\n\nMy personal belief is (pending evidence to the contrary) is that she does not belong in this family, but for the sake of argument, I'll leave her \"attached\" until this is solved. She married John Tatham before ca 1845 and apparently lived in Cherokee Co, NC and Missouri and California. I have not been able to find them on the 1850 census. They were in Butte Co, California for the 1860 census. Their children were born ca 1845 and ca 1846 in MO, ca 1852 and ca 1856 in California. That means they were probably in Missouri for the 1850 census, or between there and California.\n\nElizabeth Bryson was born 20 May 1811 (source?) in Haywood Co, NC. She is a proven child of William and Elizabeth, named in the 1844 deed naming his heirs. She was apparently home with her parents for the 1820 census (\"under 10\", born ca 1810/20), and apparently home in 1830 (age 15-19, born ca 1810/15).\n\nElizabeth married John Phillips ca 1830-1831, presumably in Macon County (no marriage record found). Their marriage is proven by the 1844 deed naming the heirs of William Bryson which names Elizabeth Phillips and husband John Phillips. John was born 18 Aug 1802 (source?), son of Phillip Phillips and Mary Oneal. I don't know the source for his parents, but Phillip and Mary were just a few houses from John and Elizabeth in 1850.\n\nThey were listed on the 1840 census in Macon County. They were not listed near any of the Brysons.\n\n1840 census analysis (based on available evidence): (Explanation of this census)\n\n1840 Macon Co, NC pg 159 John Phillips 0100010000000-0100010000000 Analysis: 1 Male(s) 30-39 (1800-1810) John PHILLIPS (1802) 1 Male(s) 5-9 (1830-1835) Nathaniel G.

She is a proven child of William and Elizabeth, named in an 1849 deed where she and her husband sold their share of the William Bryson estate. Her husband was named in an 1843 and 1844 deed where the other heirs sold him their shares, but those two deeds didn't mention Sarah.\n\nShe was apparently home with her parents for the 1820 census (\"under 10\", born ca 1810/20), and apparently home in 1830 (age 15-19, born ca 1810/15).\n\nSarah Bryson married Elijah Kimsey (or Kimzey) between 1830 and 1831 in Macon Co, NC (no record found).
