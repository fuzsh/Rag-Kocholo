        "text": "My name is Mary-Elizabeth Thompson and I am very excited to begin my first year of teaching elementary music at Laurel Park! My family moved to Raleigh after living in Texas for the last ten years, where I was an Associate Professor of Music at Sul Ross State University and played flute professionally. I received my Bachelors of Music Education from Furman University; my Masters in flute performance from Kent State University; and my Doctor of Musical Arts from the University of Kansas. I have been teaching music for more than 20 years and look forward to sharing my love of music with the students at LPE.\n\nOne fun fact about me is that I love performing and researching Mexican music, and I was even able to spend a year in Mexico City doing just that. Mexico City remains one of my favorite places in the world! In my free time, I love to read, practice yoga, and spend time with my husband, my children, and my mom. We are all very happy to be living here and look forward to learning about all of the fun things to do in the area."
