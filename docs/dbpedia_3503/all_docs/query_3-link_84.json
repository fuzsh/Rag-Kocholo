There are three possible sources for the derivation of the name. The commonly suggested derivation is the occupation.\n\nA turner is a person whose work is to form articles with a lathe. Many different materials were used: wood, metal, bone, and clay. The name may also have come from the occupation of milling. The other possible derivation of the name is from a place in Normandy, Le Tournoir\n\n(that is French for \"the Black Tower\"). Another possibility is from the practice of noblemen who would send out peasants in front of the hunters to make game birds fly up, hence (turner).\n\nThe probability is that some Turner families took their name from the one source and others from the other source. This would mean that not all persons named Turner are, when their lineage is traced to the beginning point, related.\n\nB\n\nIs there a John aboard?\n\nThe name \"Turner\" appears on the Mayflower passenger list. Not likely our direct line. It appears on ship passenger lists in Virginia in 1622, 1642, and 1653, as well as in other early years of the colonization of America.\n\nThe earliest Turner in our line that any group has been able to trace is a John Turner, who lived in Virginia. No one has been able to prove this for sure. Some speculate. We have not been able to determine when and where he was born. It seems reasonable to suppose that he was born in the \"old country\" and that his birth occurred near the end of the sixteenth century (late 1500's). According to ship passenger lists, there was a John Turner and an \"E\" Turner who came to Virginia in 1653. Incidentally, there was also and Elizabeth Turner who came in the same year. But, then who was she?\n\nIf John was our first ancestor, he was the father of an Edward or some groups claim a William.\n\nThe John Turner on the Mayflower passenger list(not likely our ancestor) and his two sons died in one of the bad winters in Plymouth Colony.\n\nC.\n\nWilliam the Quaker,\n\nWilliam was the son of John. Some groups claim that our line is through Edward who was married to Catherine Carter. Edward was William's son. Edward's brother Thomas was our line. Some groups want to go directly from William to Roger who married Elizabeth Bryan, but our research indicates that Roger was William's grandson, therefore our next ancestor was Thomas. William's children were among the original members of the Concord Monthly Meeting of Friends (Quakers), in Chester County, PA. We don't know William's birth date. He lived in Surry Co, NC in 1740.\n\nD.\n\nThomas Turner (Son of William the Quaker)\n\nThomas was born in 1667 and died in 1774. He married Susan Anthony in 1689. Thomas was born in Pennsylvania.\n\nThomas moved to Virginia and to Rowan Co, NC. He had three sons at the time. They were Edward, Roger, and Thomas.\n\nRoger, Edward and Thomas lived with the Boones and Bryans until about 1734. Then with Squire Boone and others went down the Great Wagon Road, through the Shenandoah Valley to Morgan Bryan's Quaker Settlement on Opequon Creek, Frederick Co, VA.\n\nAbout 1754 they went to NC and settled in Bryan's settlement which was made of : Morgan Bryan; Squire Boone; William and John Linville; George Farbush; James Hughes; James Carter; Roger, Edward, and Thomas Turner; most of whom were related to Morgan Bryan.\n\nThomas's children married:\n\nRoger Turner to Elizabeth Bryan\n\nEdward Turner to Ann Kimbrough\n\nThomas to Mary Boone\n\nRoger was our next direct line ancestor.\n\nE.\n\nRoger Sr.\n\nRoger Turner Sr was born in 1689 in Pennsylvania and was married to Elizabeth Bryan (Daniel Boone's Aunt). He died in 1778 in NC. He married in Surry Co, NC. He also died in Surry Co.\n\nCourt records in 1763 show that Roger and probably his brother Thomas helped Daniel Boone build a road to Salisbury, NC.\n\nThe entry reads:\n\n12 July 1763, On motion it is ordered that a wagon road the best and nearest and best way from the shallow ford upon the Yadkin River to the town of Salisbury and the following persons are appointed to lay off and mark the same, to wit: Samuel Bryan, Morgan Bryan, James Bryan, Roger Turner, Matthew Sparks, Edward Roberts, Daniel Boon, Barnet Stagner, David Johnston, James McMahan, Robert Forbush and Thomas Turner and according they appear notice and be qualified before the nearest magistrate, for their faithful discharge of their office.\n\nRoger Sr and his children between 1755 and 1761 obtained more than 2000 acres of land on both sides of the Yadkin River near the Shallow Ford.\n\nRoger Sr lived on what was called Turner's Creek.\n\nBetween 1755 and 1765 he received two granville grants for 700 acres.\n\nThe opposite pages are extracts from Wilkes Co, NC records showing some of the activities of Roger Sr and his children.\n\nNone of these activities listed is likely to be Roger Sr grandson Revolutionary War Roger.\n\nRoger and Elizabeth at one time when living in the Yadkin River lived on the next property to D. Boone. At last account one of the old chimneys from Boone's house is still standing. This place is on the Yadkin about 20 miles from Boone, NC.\n\nThe next three pages show three different researchers opinion on Roger Sr's background.\n\nE.\n\nDaniel Boone and Roger built a road together and lived in the same area.\n\nBoone shortly left the area. From 1769-1771 he was gone hunting in Kentucky. In 1773 he started to Kentucky and turned back. In 1775 he moved his family to Kentucky. Roger Sr stayed in North Carolina.\n\nPreacher Soelle visits Roger Sr:\n\nNorth Carolina Historical Commission records shows that a preacher Soelle visited Roger Turner Sr, in 1773. He states that Roger was the oldest man in the neighborhood and that he was 84 and blind.\n\nRoger Sr's will:\n\nThe will of Roger Turner Sr., filed in Rowan County is dated Feb 2, 1775 and was probated at the November term of court in 1778. It mentions his wife Elisabeth, sons Elias, Robert, Thomas and Roger; daughters Hannah and Mary and Mary; and grandson Roger, son of Thomas.\n\nThe Thomas listed last was our next direct ancestor and then his son Roger (Revolutionary War Roger).\n\nF.\n\nThomas Turner 1731-1806 (Son of Roger Sr and father of Revolutionary War Roger)\n\nThomas was born in 1731 in Wilkes Co and was married to Charity Swain and later to a second wife.\n\nThomas's children were; Jane, John, Roger(Ours), Thomas (see side bar) and Edward.\n\nSome groups list also Abraham, James, and Reuben. These may have been from a second wife.\n\nThomas was in his 40's at the time of the Revolutionary War. We have no record of his serving. We know that his son Roger and Thomas served. This is about all we know. He died in 1806.\n\nSide Bar\n\nThomas Turner Jr, son of Thomas and brother to Revolutionary War Roger was born in 1760 in North Carolina, and married Mary Buchner.\n\nIn Breathitt Co, in 1840, Thomas is listed as 83 years old and a Revolutionary War soldier.\n\nSome groups that are doing research claim that Thomas Jr was our ancestor directly and the father of Edward who came to Breathitt Co and that Roger was not Edward's father. However, most groups trace our line from Thomas Sr to Revolutionary War Roger and then to Breathitt Co Edward.\n\nUntil this matter is cleared we claim Roger instead of his brother Thomas Jr.\n\nG.\n\nRevolutionary War Roger Turner (Son of Thomas Sr)\n\nRoger Turner was born in 1757 in North Carolina and died in 1845 in Breathitt Co., Ky.\n\nRoger married 17 November 1799 in Wilkes Co, North Carolina to Sarah Speed. Roger served in the Revolutionary War.\n\nOn the next pages are copies of his request for a pension and his marriage records.\n\nRevolutionary War Roger had six children that lived to adulthood. They were Jesse, Thomas, Elizabeth, Roger, David, and Edward.\n\nSee enclosed chart starting with Roger Sr.\n\nRoger arrived in Kentucky between 1820 and 1830 to live with his son Thomas. Thomas had arrived earlier and had purchased land on Turkey Creek in Breathitt Co on 5-18-1822.\n\nThomas was a brother to Edward (ours) who settled on the Middle Fork River at the mouth of Elsom Creek.\n\nEdward may be buried on Sebastian Branch, Breathitt Co.\n\nH.\n\nEdward Turner\n\nEdward Turner was born in 1781 in North Carolina and died in 1850 in Kentucky. He was married to Sally Buttrey (born 1787) in North Carolina. She was the daughter of Timothy Buttrey and Mary Allen Buttrey. They married 5-5-1805 in Wilkes Co., N.C.\n\nTheir children were Mary, John, Thomas (Humpy), Edward, Sally, Nancy, and Elizabeth.\n\nEdward dammed up the river at themouth of Elsom Creek and had a mill that sawed logs and ground corn. He made his living farming and logging. Some groups claim that Edward was in the War of 1812. He would have been 31 at the time. We have found proof that an Edward was in the service. Most think he was ours. (See Edward's war record).\n\nEdward moved to Breathitt County about the same time that his brother Thomas did.\n\nEdward and Sally were the parents of Thomas (Humpy) Turner, the next in our direct line. Edward is supposedly buried on his old farm, the present day farm of Harlan Bowling, located a short distance up the highway above the mouth of Elsom. Their graves have been destroyed, but a few markers remain.\n\nIt appears that Edward Turner who came to Breathitt Co and settled at the mouth of Elsom did serve in the War of 1812. He served 19 days from February 9, 1815 to March 9, 1815. See Attached muster roll and payroll.\n\nI.\n\nThomas H. (Humpy) Turner\n\nThomas was born in 1812 in Breathitt Co and was married on 9-24-1833 to Mary (Polly) Johnson who died 5-20-1853 at the age of 39. Polly was the daughter of Robert and Rachel Helton Johnson and she lived on Longs Creek.\n\nThomas was the father of our Jesse.\n\nHe also had a Timothy, Elliott, Edward, John, Wilburn, Mary Paschal, Shadrach (Shade) and Rachel. See previous ancestor chart.\n\n1850 Breathitt Co. Census:\n\n284 Thomas H 38 NC\n\nPolly 35\n\nJesse 15\n\nTimothy 13\n\nElliott 11\n\nEdward 9\n\nJohn 7\n\nWilburn 5\n\nMary 4\n\nPaschal(M) 3\n\nShadrach 1\n\nJ.\n\nCivil War Jesse\n\nJesse Turner(1835-1885) married Fannie Estepp and is buried at the Bob Turner Cemetery on Longs Creek in Breathitt Co.\n\nGrandfather Venison said that his grandfather Jesse sold a hollow of land at Buckhorn containing over a hundred acres for a milk cow and a rifle.\n\nI have run across one story about a mountain man selling his land for a rifle and a dog.\n\nI have not been able to confirm this story yet.\n\nGrandpa Venison said the Fannie (Jesse's wife) was a full-blooded Cherokee Indian. We don't know for sure.\n\nA Dana Vaughn thinks Fannie is the Fannah listed in the Clay Co census as the daughter of Joseph.\n\nJesse apparently was a private in the 14th Kentucky Volunteer Cavalry, Company K. He enrolled on Dec 3, 1862. He was mustered in June 15, 1863 at Lexington, Ky for a 1 year period.\n\nCompany K of the 14 Cavalry was commanded by Captain William Strong. Edward Marcum was a 1stLt and Nimrod McIntosh was a 2dLt. and William Little was a sergeant.\n\nJesse was listed on the roll as mustered out Jan 29, 1864 to Booneville, Ky.\n\nHis name is listed under the Deserted column.\n\nAlso on Jan 28, 1864 a Hogin Hocker is listed as deserted to Booneville, Ky.\n\nWe are still researching to see if this was or was not our Jesse. Company I also had a Jesse Turner listed as deserted and served one day under Captain Amis. Amis and Strong had a feud later.\n\nGrandpa Venison said that his father John (Jesse's Son) had to leave Breathitt Co (Long's Creek) because of the trouble after the Civil War when Captain Bill Strong was involved in a feud with the Amis clan.\n\nVenison said he thought that Jesse was still on good terms with Captain Bill and rode with him after the Civil War during the period of trouble in Breathitt Co with the Ku Klux Klan or home guard.\n\nA good source of information on this is John Ed Pearce Days of Darkness, The Feuds of Eastern Kentucky, copyright 1994, University of Ky Press.\n\nGrandpa Venison said that his grandfather left Breathitt Co and moved to a hollow on Cow Creek where Venison was born. The hollow is located along Estill McIntosh's church on Cow Creek across the hill from Long's Creek.\n\nAt any rate, Jesse is buried on Long's Creek.\n\nSee attached list of Jesse and Fannie's children prepared by Betty Estepp. A note: most say that Joel was the baby. See the 1880 attached Breathitt Co census.\n\nVenison said he believed that Fannie's parents were Joel Estepp and a Hall. We are still working on Jesse's wife's line.\n\nJoel said that most of Jesse's brothers were involved in some way in the Civil War. We are still working on this.\n\nJesse Turner (1880 Breathitt Co Census)\n\nJesse 45\n\nFannie 38\n\nSallie 19\n\nPolly 16\n\nMartha J 13\n\nShadrach 11\n\nRachel 8\n\n` John 6\n\nElliott 4\n\nTimothy 2\n\nFemale 2/12\n\n1890 Census\n\nJesse B. 9/35\n\nFannie B. 5/39\n\nAnne B. 4/1878\n\nJoel B. May 1879\n\nWho was Fannie Estepp?\n\nFannie was the wife of our Jesse (Civil War). Little is known of her.\n\nShe was born May 13, 1839 and died April 14, 1922. She is buried beside Jesse at the Bob Turner cemetery.\n\nVenison always said that Fannie's father was Joel Estepp and that her mother was a Hall. He claims that Hall was a full bloodied Cherokee Indian. So far I have not been able to prove this.\n\nMost researchers on the Estepp line think that Fannie is the Fannah Estepp listed in the 1850 Clay Co Census.If this is correct her father was Joseph Estepp, a Virginia farmer and her mother was Sally.\n\nAccording to Joel Turner, Joel Estepp was James(Jim) Esteppe. James was Joel's grandfather.\n\nI am presently continuing research on this line.\n\nK.\n\nReverend John Turner(Father of Grandpa Venison Turner)\n\nReverend John Turner (Born Dec 25, 1875 and died Jan 18, 1950). He married Elizabeth Deaton Nov 17, 1892. I (Ernest Turner) remember John when he was at our house at Blue Diamond and was sick and ready to die. He called Brother Venison and I - Jesse and Frank James.\n\nJohn was an old Regular Baptist. One story is that he was \"churched\" for getting frisky with the widow women. Did he do this? Did he get back in their good graces?\n\nWhy did John leave Breathitt Co and settle on Cow Creek? It may have had something to do with the Strong-Amis feud?\n\nJohn is buried at Elsom in an unmarked grave. His grave is at the bottom of the cemetery near where the preachers platform is.\n\nJohn in his later life broke up housekeeping and lived with his friends and relatives until\n\nhe died.\n\nAfter Elizabeth died and John married again, story is that his new bride said that Venison (Grandpa) had to go.\n\nVenison told me that he and John didn't get along. Venison left home and joined the army.\n\n1900 Census, Cow Creek Precinct No 4, W.J.

Marriage record of John and Elizabeth is attached.\n\nJohn was known to ride the rafts down the river to Frankfort. Venison said that he went several times.\n\nAbout 5 months out of the year , especially in the spring and sometimes in the fall, mountain men would cut trees and make rafts from the logs. When it rained a lot, they would \" \"float\" down the river with the tide to Frankfort where they sold their logs. After selling their logs they had to walk back. The runs started seriously in 1871.\n\nThere are many stories about these mountain men and their exploits. Some took a fancy to factory made whiskey and bluegrass women. Several were known \"shoot up the place\". There was a running feud between the rafters and the citizens along the Kentucky river. On the whole most were civilized and well behaved.\n\nThere were several places on the way back and the way down that they could \"stay all night\".\n\nThe North and South forkers went home by way of Winchester. The Middle Forkers went home by way of Richmond.\n\nIn 1915, 15,000 logs per hour were said to have passed Jackson on the way to Frankfort.\n\nToday poplar, red oak, and walnut are trucked out since the locks and dams were built.\n\nGrandpa Venison said he went with his Dad up and down Longs Creek on \"Kneelboats\". These were small shallow boats that carried goods up the river to various businesses.\n\nJohn had sons Jesse and Reuben who grew up and had children. He also had a girl named Haley who married John Holland. I have some information on Haley and John. Most of their children grew up in the Combs area of Perry Co. A good source of information on Venison's brother Jesse is Carol Barnett. Her address is 2823 Laurel Drive, Hebron, Ky 41048.\n\nElizabeth Deaton (Venison's Mother)\n\nElizabeth Deaton was born May 10, 1872 and died Dec 25, 1911. She is buried at the Squire Turner graveyard at Houston, Ky.\n\nMost researchers think that Elizabeth was the daughter of John Simpkins and Sythia Caudill. John Simpkins was raised by the Deatons. he went by the name of John \"Blue\" Deaton. \"Blue\" being slang for illegitimate.\n\nElizabeth may have had a daughter named Sythia before she married John. She is listed above Grandpa Venison in the census record.\n\nElizabeth \"Lizzie\" Simpkins was raised by her mother Sythia Ann and her second husband Peter McIntosh. Elizabeth may have used or been known by McIntosh. Venison's brother Jesse and Venison's death certificates had her listed as Elizabeth Deaton.\n\nMost researchers accept Elizabeth's mother as Sythia Caudill, but several researchers are not convinced that John Simpkins was Elizabeth's father.\n\nL.\n\nReverend Venison Turner Oct 15, 1895-1979:\n\nVenison Turner was the oldest child of John Turner and Elizabeth Deaton. He stated that his birth was 1895. When a local electric book ran a story about a snow in June of 1894, Venison stated that he remembers his parents telling him that he was born that year. The Census records shows a Sythia Ann as older than Venison. She was probably a child of Elizabeth before she married John. Their marriage records shows that it was a first marriage for each.\n\nVenison was born on Cow Creek in Owsley Co. he was living in Owsley in 1900 but by 1910 he was back in Breathitt.\n\nJohn later remarried after Elizabeth died and the story is that Venison had to leave before the woman would marry John.\n\nVenison told me that he remembers sleeping in the old house that was built in those days. He said that he slept in the loft and remembers waking up in the winter with snow on his covers.\n\nVenison joined the army in 1914 and served until 1917. He took his training at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.\n\nAccording to his discharge he was in the Quartermaster Corps. He was not in any battles and did not go to Europe regardless of the stories he told.\n\nWhether he help build the Panama Canal or not, I don't know. Panama was considered part of the U. S. at the time and whether they would consider that outside of the U.S., I don't know.\n\nAfter the war, instead of coming home, he stayed in Texas for a few years. His dad was drawing a pension on him. How he worked this, I don't know. He stayed on a ranch in Texas with a childless couple. They tried to get him to stay. They said that they would give him the ranch after they died. He told me that after he came back to Kentucky and married, he tried to get grandmother to go back to Texas with him.\n\nHe said that while in Texas, he kept thinking about a pine tree near the place where Sarah lived.\n\nSome locals say that one day several years after the war, Sarah and her parents woke up one morning and found Venison \"passed out drunk\" on their front porch. He gave up his drinking later in life.\n\nHe married Sarah Herald on November 5, 1919.\n\nCensus records show that Venison and Sarah and Jesse and his wife were living with John in 1920.\n\nVenison and Sarah had 9 children. Only 3 lived to be grown.\n\nVenison mad a living working in the coal mines in Perry Co.\n\nHe worked for the Blue Diamond Coal Company on First Creek in Perry County from 1933 until 1957.\n\nVenison concluded his coal mining career by cleaning coal cars. He would take a broom and shovel and clean the coal cars. He had a German shepherd dog named Mike that stayed with him. Mike bit Venison's boss one time when he tried to pick up some of Venison's tools.\n\nVenison was a member of the Pentecostal Church. He told me that after he joined the church, he didn't think he was ever going to get \"the baptism of the Holy Ghost\". This is an experience that Pentecostals seek after getting saved. It is usually accomplished by speaking in tongues. He said he was sitting on a rock at the mouth of Elsom when the Spirit moved on him.\n\nHe went from church to church preaching and many times they had services at peoples houses.\n\nAfter retiring from Blue Diamond Coal, Venison moved to Meadow Creek in Owsley County where he lived until his death.\n\nHe remarried after Sarah's death to Lovely Howard. She lived several years after their marriage. They resided on Kentucky route 30 just North of Booneville in a rented home. She is\n\nburied with Sarah on Elsom. Venison left space between the two to be buried but before he died, he changed his mind. He decided that he wanted to be buried on Turkey Creek (Houston-Squire Turner Graveyard), where his mother was buried.\n\nVenison spent his last few years with me, my wife and his great-grandchildren.\n\nAfter eating a good supper he went out on the front porch of my house and sat down. My daughter, Anna, was riding her bicycle. He said to her, \"Be careful, my baby and don't wreck\" and then he passed away peacefully.\n\nVenison had 3 children that grew up.\n\nHis son, Willie, didn't have any children.\n\nFor anyone who wants a complete list of family members for Loretta and Charley, I have a separate book on this. I have a page for each family member.

Above the land that we own on Turkey Creek is the old chimney where Sarah was born. She is buried on Elsom.\n\nM.\n\nCharley Turner (Jun 24, 1921 - Feb 21, 1994)\n\nCharley Turner was born on Longs Creek in Breathitt County very close to where you turn to go to Buckhorn, Ky on Ky route 28. At that time this area was called Crockettsville.\n\nHe lived in this area as well as WolfCoal in another section of the county. He moved to Perry Co with Venison and as soon as he was old enough to work in the mines, he quit school and went to work.\n\nHe worked mostly for Blue Diamond Coal Company. He was a drill man. Dr Wagers(the company doctor) had to sew up his jaw once as a result of the drill getting loose. Charley worked over 20 years inside the mines.\n\nHe married Margaret Ann Campbell and lived with her until her death in 1987. They were married May 28, 1943. (See marriage license and certificate). Charley and Margaret (Margie) had 12 children. See chart (Heirs of Venison Turner and Sarah Herald).\n\nCharley always told everyone that he was going to raise his own baseball team. He raised his children up teaching them to play. Most played just for the fun of it. Clayton played Little League and High School ball.\n\nCharley later moved to Owsley County when the UMWA pulled out of Blue Diamond\n\nand the mine closed. He still worked briefly for Blue Diamond after moving to Owsley Co,\n\nand worked at various jobs until he got old enough to draw his miner's pension and social security. During the period he coached Little League baseball in Owsley Co. (See article by Deron Mays). He received a Kentucky Colonel commission for the little league work.\n\nCharley worked for Townsend Tree Service, the \"Happy Pappys\", Booneville Water Plant and even worked in the mine in Willie Herald's hollow.\n\nDuring his work life he usually kept a large truck which he would haul scrap iron to Lexington but mostly to move people in and out of the Blue Diamond community.\n\nAfter his retirement he devoted his time to picking up pop cans and taking care of his son Chester.\n\nIn case you didn't know, the money he picked up from pop cans were used to buy presents or give his children and grandchildren money for Christmas.\n\nThis is just a brief outline of Charley's life. More will follow in separate articles and stories that will be compiled and given to you later or put into the newsletter.\n\nMargaret Ann Campbell:\n\nThe wife of Charley Turner and mother of their 12 children was born April 3, 1927 in Perry Co.She was the daughter of Bradley Eversole and Ann Coldwell.\n\nBradley was a teacher and a Mason. He was killed in a coal mine accident.\n\nMarriage license show that Bradley was the son of Press Eversole and Rebecca Eversole.\n\nAfter Bradley's death, Ann married Martin Fugate. She took the name Campbell.\n\nCensus records show that Bradley was the grandson of Joseph Campbell and Emiline with their daughter Rebecca being Bradley's mother. Rebecca and Press were probably never married. This may be why Ann took the Campbell name. Bradley may have took it after their marriage. (See marriage certificates and census record).\n\nAnn was the daughter of Johnnie and Elzie Colwell. (See census record).\n\nI recently got a whole packet of information about the Campbells from Dr Roy Kidd of Knott Co. I have tried to piece the Campbell side of mother's family tree together from this information. If any major changes are needed, we will revise it.\n\n1900 Perry Co Census:\n\nName Born\n\nJoseph Campbell Aug 1837 Married 15 years\n\nEmiline(Wife) Sep 1839 10 children\n\nRebecca(Daughter) Oct 1875 divorced (1 child)\n\nFrank E. Apr 1877\n\nMack Jun 1883\n\nHardy Nov 1888\n\nBradley (Grandson) Sep 1895\n\nBradley must be son of Rebecca. She and Press were probably never married. There were several Preston Eversoles, so I can't say which one was Bradley's father.\n\nBoyd Campbell (Son of Ann Colwell Campbell), claims tha Life Magazine published a picture of Press Eversole on (or with) his mule and jug, around 1945.\n\nAnnie Colwell Born 1899 Perry Co (Mom's mother)\n\nFather - John Colwell 1863\n\nMarried Bradley Eversole Age 20\n\nAnnie 16, married Dec 1915 Grapevine, Ky\n\n1900 Census\n\nAnnie Colwell Born Perry Co\n\nFather John Colwell 1873(Note: Buried on Campbells Creek)\n\nMother Elzie 1876\n\n1910 Census\n\nColwell, John 37 1st Marriage Married 14 years Wife 4 children, 4 children living\n\nElzie 34 1st Marriage\n\nAnne 10 daughter\n\nEllen 8 daughter\n\nWooley 6 Son\n\nPearl 2 Son\n\nCAMPBELL FAMILY TREE\n\n1st Generation\n\nJohn Campbell (Scotland) John Couch\n\nMary Polly Boone\n\n2nd Generation\n\nJoseph Campbell (1763)\n\nPolly Couch (1772)\n\n3rd Generation\n\nFrank Campbell (1802) NC William Eversole\n\nMargaret Williams(1804) NC Serena Frain\n\n4th Generation\n\nJoseph Campbell 1841\n\nEmoline Eversole 1844\n\n5th Generation\n\nPreston Eversole Johnny Colwell\n\nRebecca Campbell Elzie\n\n6th Generation\n\nBradley Campbell(Note: Buried in the Tunnel Hill Cemetery, between Second\n\nAnn Colwell Creek and Campbells Creek)"
