        "text": "BrainDead\n\nThis ambitious CBS series, cancelled after one season in June, deserved more time for viewers to find it. An unusual combination of political satire and science fiction, it involves mind-controlling space insects. They invade Washington, D.C., taking over anyone whose brain they can crawl inside, including top politicians. The joke is that in today's divisive capital, no one can tell. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, a \"scream queen\" in \"10 Cloverfield Lane\" and \"The Thing,\" shows a deft comedic touch in the lead. She's an out-of-work documentary filmmaker moving back home to work for her brother, a U.S. senator (Danny Pino). As the 2016 presidential campaign rages in the background, she senses something is very wrong. Unrated, 13 episodes, 561 minutes. Extras: three featurettes and a gag reel. From Paramount. Released Dec. 6 on DVD.\n\nJason Bourne\n\nMatt Damon took a nine-year break from playing memory-challenged CIA assassin Jason Bourne, but he hasn't forgotten what it takes to make an exciting spy thriller. Bourne is hiding out because he knows his former bosses want him taken out. So he keeps a low profile, fighting in underground bare-fisted matches to make money. A former colleague (Julia Stiles) pulls him back into the fray when she brings him new evidence about his family's involvement in the program. Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vikander and Vincent Cassel star in the July release, which hopscotches from Greece to Iceland to Virginia and other exotic locales. This is director Paul Greengrass' third \"Bourne\" outing. PG-13. From Universal Pictures Home Entertainment. Released Dec. 6. Also released Dec. 6 is a six-disc set with all five \"Bourne\" films, called \"The Bourne Ultimate Collection.\"\n\nDon't Think Twice\n\nA six-member improv comedy team toils for years together only to have their cozy group dynamic threatened when one of them is cast in a network sketch comedy show resembling \"Saturday Night Live.\" What happens to the rest of them now that one member is rocketing to solo stardom? Will the others ever get their big break? This bright comedy from July stars Keegan-Michael Key, Gillian Jacobs and Mike Birbiglia, who also wrote and directed. Rated R, 92 minutes. From Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.\n\nMad Max High Octane Collection\n\nAll four \"Mad Max\" films are assembled in this eight-disc Blu-ray set, the first three starring Mel Gibson.

Released Dec. 6.\n\nShannara Chronicles, season one\n\nElves, druids, trolls and the occasional human interact in this science-fiction fantasy series from New Zealand, set in the distant future.

Show\n\nNot one but two seminal rock concert films from the mid-1960s make their Blu-ray debuts in this combo collector's edition. Performers include the Rolling Stones, James Brown, the Beach Boys, Ike and Tina Turner, The Byrds, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Chuck Berry, the Ronettes and Ray Charles.

Released Dec. 6.\n\nKicks\n\nAfter working hard and saving up money to buy new Air Jordan sneakers, Brandon, 15, loses his treasured footwear to a local thief.

Jahking Guillory plays the young hero in this adventure from September set in the East Bay section of Oakland, California, where having the right shoes means everything to kids. From Universal Pictures Home Entertainment. Released Dec. 6 on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\nThe Hollars\n\nJohn Krasinski of \"The Office\" stars in and directs this romantic comedy-drama from August about a big-city artist back in his small-town home because a family member has fallen ill. The great cast includes Sharlto Copley, Richard Jenkins, Anna Kendrick and Margo Martindale. From Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. Released Dec. 6.\n\nHenry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\n\nThe controversial 1986 horror crime film, shot on 16mm in 28 days in 1986 for $110,000, gets a 30th anniversary Blu-ray makeover. Director John McNaughton's debut, loosely based on a serial killer portrayed by Michael Rooker, is presented in a new 4K scan.
