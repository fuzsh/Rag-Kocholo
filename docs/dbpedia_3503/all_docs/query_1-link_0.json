        "text": "Mary Lee Sears Turner-the name evokes different things for different people.\n\nFor her family, she was in the true sense of the word a matriarch-where she was, her presence was felt. She listened, she laughed, she offered wisdom in a quiet way, and she always had time-to host slumber parties for grandchildren; to drink tea with her daughters; to applaud the endeavors of her son and sons-in-law...always encouraging, always interested, always fully present.\n\nAnd one might think that great-grandchildren would only experience the passing glory of MamaLee, but that would be incorrect. Her interest in her great-grandchildren rivaled that of hers for the previous generations. Though her limited mobility in her later years precluded some things, she once again was very present through lunch dates, phone calls, and much-loved conversations around her table, where she listened more than she talked and offered quiet, pithy wisdom with a sparkle in her eye.\n\nAnd from her friends over the past few days, words-wise, loving, encouraging, supportive, a real sense of humor, a role model, a treasure-have been shared. And she was a loyal friend playing mahjong with the same friends for over 20 years. In her quiet way, Mary Lee Sears Turner was always a presence.\n\nWhile Lee loved her friends and her family, her life love was B. Jack Turner. They met while he was at Texas Tech studying geology after serving in the Navy during World War II, and she was teaching school in Big Spring after graduating from TCU. It was a whirlwind, love-at-first-sight kind of thing. While her family in McKinney, Texas was planning a wedding, they eloped and were pretty much inseparable after that.\n\nYet of all the ways Lee will be remembered and truly the most important one was her relationship with her Lord Jesus Christ. Lee was raised in the Methodist church, and her mother's faith played a huge role in her life. Minnie Viola Reneau Sears breathed hymns. She played both the piano and the pump organ in the days of circuit preachers, so she was a blend of all denominations-a refreshing faith. Lee carried peace from her faith in the midst of many storms of life. While she taught high school Sunday School in her early life, she really taught with her life. She loved the Lord, and she trusted Him...no matter what-and with great authenticity.\n\nMary Lee Sears Turner was born on May 3, 1928, and her faith became sight on May 8, 2024. Her family-daughters Jacki Parker (Jimmy), Judy Carter (Bruce), grandchildren Kyle Turner (Amy); Chance Turner (Kim); Rebecca Strauser (Tyson); Laura Elizabeth Cutbirth; Davis Parker (Melissa); Evan Parker (Lauren); Cameron Carter; Hillary Boss; great-grandchildren Caroline, Jack, and Will Turner; Julian and Marion Strauser; Tillman and Tapley Turner; Hugh, Ella, Nola, and Julia Parker; Hailey, June, James, and Max Parker; James, Jack, and Sears Boss are grateful for the time they shared with MamaLee. And B. Jack Turner, Jonathan Wade Turner, and Brian Ellis Cutbirth are rejoicing to resume theirs.\n\nAt 96 years of age Lee had shared her life with her friends and her family, and it was time to enter eternity with her Lord. Many of us think we can see her and her life love, Jack, dancing on a heavenly dance floor...\n\nThe family will continue to celebrate MamaLee's life with a private burial and wishes to express gratitude to Mrs. Gina Goettsch and the Wesley Court staff and to Dr. Sandra Hazelip and Big Country Hospice."
