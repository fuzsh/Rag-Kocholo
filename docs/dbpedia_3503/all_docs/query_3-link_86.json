        "text": "Evelyn Elizabeth Turner, 75, of Prince Frederick, passed away October 26, 2013 at the Burnett-Calvert Hospice House. She was born February 11, 1938 in Long Island, NY to Vance Ralph and Alice Elizabeth (Ludlum) Collom. Evelyn was raised in Arlington, VA, where she attended school.\n\nPrimarily a mother and homemaker, Evelyn also worked in customer service at Woodward & Lothrop Department Stores, and was a substitute teacher and a bus driver.\n\nShe moved to Prince Frederick in 1976, and was a proud Calvert Hospice Volunteer for over twenty years. She was a member of the Red Hats Society and the Calvert Garden Club. Evelyn loved being on the water, fishing and crabbing, and enjoyed golf in her younger years. She was a devoted mother, and great cook. Most of all she loved spending time with her family and friends and valued the relationships she had with them. Many referred to her as \"the classiest lady they knew.\"\n\nEvelyn was preceded in death by her parents and her husband William \"Bill\" Turner.\n\nShe is survived by three sons, Christopher B. Fleshren and wife Toby of Manassas, VA, David G. Fleshren and wife Manuela of Springfield, VA, and Michael D. Fleshren and wife Mivaun of Loris, SC. Also surviving are grandchildren Nicole and Kyle Fleshren, both of Loris, SC, a brother Vance R. Collom and wife Judy of Webster, NY, and several nieces and nephews.\n\nArrangements provided by Rausch Funeral Home."
