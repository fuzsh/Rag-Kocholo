While storms ravaged the Dutch coast and Sint-Maarten continued to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, the coalition talks remained stuck in the doldrums on the eve of Prinsjesdag – or ‘Budget Day’ as we’re fond of calling it. This week’s podcast gives you the lowdown on the history, horses and hats that make up the ceremonial opening of the Parliamentary year. We also tell you about a woman who lost €147 when she was caught short in Amsterdam and a man who lost €5 million when his nerves got the better of him on live TV, and explain why neither the prime minister nor the Dutch flower trade are as romantic as they might seem.

In this podcast we said the record for the longest cabinet was held by the Den Uyl cabinet of 1977. We did, of course, mean the Van Agt cabinet of 1977, which took office after Joop den Uyl had tried unsuccessfully to form a government.
