        "text": "Club house\n\nNot only has the programming changed over the years, so have the possibilities offered by the campus. “There are more people on the TU/e grounds, decision-making more often involves consultation or more groups having their say and, an important point, there are fewer spare rooms. A ramble through the basements of the Main building and various laboratories, like the one we did for the lustrum performance TU Odyssey in 2011, would be pretty tricky these days. In Luna, where we now hold our performances, there is a lively culture, but we are still very much in the startup phase there.”\n\nAnother change: the active role that students can play. Corine Bolwerk, SG program-maker since 1988, explains: “In the past we were a club house of sorts. It was their second home. Now it is harder to find students who are prepared to commit for a longer stretch.”\n\nSami Faltas, SG chief from 1988 to 1994, still remembers well the remarkable performance in 1990: “A lecturer told me that he was a member of the Skepsis Foundation, which combats superstition and quackery. A young man from the Transcendental Meditation movement had claimed that he could fly with the aid of TM, and the skeptic offered him 10,000 Dutch guilders if he could demonstrate that under controlled conditions.”\n\nThat lecturer, that was Jan Willem Nienhuys. He taught in the early 1990s at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, and at that time he was actively involved in the Skepsis Foundation. The Foundation placed an appeal in the Eindhovens Dagblad, which had previously published an article about the Transcendental Meditation movement, for someone to give a demonstration.\n\nNienhuys: “Frans van de Logt answered the call. He was supposed to hover for 1 second at least 1 meter off the ground and if he managed to do so we would give him 10,000 Dutch guilders. I had withdrawn this money from the bank in advance and let it be seen prior to the test. I have to say my wife was worried that TU/e's measuring technique would prove insufficient and we would lose the money.\n\nThe Grote Zaal (now known as the Blauwe Zaal, ed.) was bursting at the seams, people were standing on other's people's shoulders to get a view. The audience numbered about six hundred. It is remarkable, isn't it, that so many technical students came to see whether the guy could do it.\n\nAmazement, introduction and enjoyment\n\nVan de Logt started to meditate, made three little hops and received modest applause. Later, when the video footage was examined, it was proved that when making his best leap he got no higher than 20 centimeters off the ground for roughly 0.4 seconds. What annoyed me was that it turned out to be a promotional stunt. Van de Logt wanted to advertise his own club.”\n\nNonetheless, recollecting all this, Sami Faltas calls it a successful event: “The three elements of our motto came to fruition: amazement, introduction and enjoyment.”\n\nAnother anecdote from Joost Rekers. “My first job was doing the layout of the information booklets, and as a rule I thought the programming was a bit boring. Things have changed since then. I once interviewed two bodybuilders who also gave a demonstration. And various Dutch celebrities, such as Henk Schiffmacher and Tom Egbers.\n\nI have made all kinds of stage sets, like the one used for a performance by Annie M.G. Schmidt. She came to the university on three occasions for our annual series Autobiographical and we made a lounge for her in 1950s style. Annie M.G. Schmidt sat in an armchair, next to which we had placed a stuffed sheep - a reference to her poems about the sheep named Veronica. Her eyesight was poor and she didn't notice the animal at all. Halfway through the interview she happened to touch it and when she looked at it up close she had the fright of her life. The audience found it hilarious.”\n\nSG chief Sami Faltas talks about this period: “To captive the students' interest, we not only looked for exciting themes and entertaining speakers or performers, but also aimed to design the events in an attractive way. We started using stage sets and introductory music and from then on events that simply involved three boring men sat at a table covered in green baize talking their heads off were banned. When we picked speakers we paid just as much attention to the presentation as to the content. This formula worked well and also inspired some other SGs.”\n\n\"But the story disappeared after that and I only remembered it months later. After a lot of googling I discovered that a Prix Pictet had indeed been set up and that a photo agency in London had something to do with it. They were very surprised by my interest. 'No, but hey, a technical university, that's a nice idea. Come along to the award ceremony for the first edition, early September in Paris, then we can take the time to discuss it.'\n\nKofi Anan awarded the prizes at the chic opening and the exhibition was absolutely stunning. Perhaps in my carefree state I was already drinking steadily without being aware of it; glasses were being refreshed automatically. At any rate, I didn't make the after-party.\"\n\n“Every TU/e lustrum is an important occasion for SG to put on a production of its own making, with artists, scientists, students and the SG team,” tells Asselbergs.\n\n“Take the TU/e Odyssey in 2011, for example. It was an intense quest for art and technology that took the public to the farthest corners of the TU/e campus, guided by a voice on the headset. The public was taken to the roof and the basements on floor -2 of the Main building, meditated in Gaslab and experienced the crackling Tesla in the High Voltage Laboratory (now Corona in Luna, ed.). People experienced the TU/e campus as they never would again. These days a TU Odyssey would be entirely unfeasible, the campus has hardly any untidy corners where you can make it happen.”\n\n….in 1958 there was an administration of the Technical College (TH) that saw a need for a ‘general educational program’. Initially, a number of one-off lectures are held and once these start to become a regular occurrence, SG is born at TU/e. Interesting fact: Studium Generale is Latin for 'general study' or 'generale education' and in the Middle Ages it was the name given to the type of education that later gave rise to the universities. The activities at the TH expand to include music lectures, exhibitions and discussions about politics. Writers too are welcome, like Willem Frederik Hermans and Gerard Reve.\n\nRight from the start, students are involved in devising the program. In 1970 a discussion starts about the direction being taken by SG, partly because the number of interested students is dwindling. The conclusion: the cultural activities can stay, but SG must become more relevant to social problems. In the 1980s and 1990s the range of activities expands again. Since 2000 SG has increasingly put on productions with ‘others’. These days students can earn credits by following certain SG programs. (Source: TU/e Encyclopedia)"
