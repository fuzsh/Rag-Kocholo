        "text": "In January 2021, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and his cabinet resigned in the wake of a startling scandal. For six consecutive years between 2013–19, Dutch tax authorities had wrongfully accused over 26,000 families of fraudulently collecting childcare allowances. Authorities in the Tax and Customs Administration alleged that thousands of families had pocketed a benefit that paid working parents for a percentage of the cost of childcare, which is not publicly funded in the Netherlands. Many of the families accused were ordered to repay tens of thousands of euros in childcare allowances, plunging households into enduring financial ruin.Footnote 1 But perhaps the most striking fact of the childcare benefits scandal (toeslagenaffaire) was the seemingly deliberate targeting of people of non-European ethnic origin – including citizens from Caribbean territories under Dutch sovereignty – and individuals holding dual nationality. Despite this, the parliamentary investigation into the scandal declined to explore the role of ethnic or racial discrimination.Footnote 2 The question of how a government institution came to equate non-European born Dutch citizens with abuse of the welfare state remained, to the great consternation of victims and racial justice activists, unaddressed.Footnote 3\n\nThis was not the first time in the Netherlands that perceived outsiders were accused of exploiting social assistance. Similar assumptions played a formative role in shaping the Dutch welfare state as it overlapped with the end of empire. After 1965, the Dutch welfare state transformed from one of Europe's smallest to one of its largest social safety nets. But the universal insurance and disability schemes that made the Dutch welfare state the envy of continental progressives would be called into question by the 1970s and significantly eroded by the mid-1990s.Footnote 4 In the 1970s, shocks to the global oil and gas economy coincided with decolonisation and growing migration from the former Dutch colonies of Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles.Footnote 5 The tens of thousands of people who moved from the Caribbean to the erstwhile metropole sought relief from looming restrictions on the rights of citizenship and economic redress in a highly stratified commonwealth forged through centuries of colonialism. As Dutch citizens, they possessed ostensibly unfettered access to the Dutch welfare state. Yet, throughout the following decades, social scientists commissioned by state and municipal actors fastidiously tabulated Caribbean interactions with the welfare state. Their most abiding preoccupation was the ‘matrifocal’ family structure of Dutch citizens from the Caribbean, imagined as fundamentally heterosexual if not properly heteronormative.Footnote 6 Although growing numbers of white European Dutch women were also uncoupling marriage and reproduction during this time, social scientists drew on an existing corpus of Black family studies developed decades earlier, contributing to perceptions of a fundamental incompatibility between Caribbean kinship and the demands of mainstream Dutch society. The result was an eroded faith in the ability of welfare to solve social inequality.\n\nIn order to understand this trajectory, it is important to consider the transnational itinerancy of racial knowledge that informed expert assertions in the Netherlands. Emerging in the 1930s and 1940s in the United States and colonial Caribbean, Black family studies was initially designed to inform policy in the context of accelerating urban migration and labour rebellions that threatened the stability of white hegemony and colonial rule.Footnote 7 This very same knowledge circulated in an enlarged transimperial geography, travelling not just north and south across the Caribbean Sea but also east across the Atlantic. In the age of decolonisation in Europe, the revival of this intellectual programme remained wedded to policy objectives but now became oriented toward a different task. Over subsequent decades, authorities in the Netherlands used this knowledge to assess prospects for integrating Caribbean Dutch citizens into metropolitan society, in the 1970s defending more interventionist social programs but, in the 1980s, as the welfare state was dismantled, supporting claims that economic improvement would not alter ‘cultural’ practices.Footnote 8 Eventually, these studies were deployed to illustrate that the putatively unchanging qualities of Caribbean kinship would tax the European welfare state. A science of colonial reform thus became a science of retrenchment.\n\nFocusing on the science that informed state policy yields new insights about Dutch society in the postwar era. As scholars of Britain and France have recently shown, empire's end was intimately intertwined with the trajectory of welfarism.Footnote 9 In the Netherlands too, the circulation of racial knowledge informed the supposedly colour-blind development of the welfare state as decolonisation inaugurated significant internal movements across the Kingdom of the Netherlands, a commonwealth encompassing the Netherlands, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles bound by Dutch sovereignty and common citizenship.Footnote 10 While scholars have often heralded the reduction of social spending in the Netherlands as a ‘miracle’ achieved through stunning social consensus and resulting in impressive wealth and job creation, the perception that welfare retrenchment was especially benign and immune to racist manipulation (in marked contrast to the US ‘War on Welfare’) appears dubious when considering how the welfare state and its scientists responded to Caribbean migration.Footnote 11\n\nBy tracking the movement of racial knowledge and notions of public obligation imperilled as a result, this article joins a growing body of scholarship that contends that assumptions about race and racism have palpably shaped Dutch society and its institutions – evident not least in the qualification of the rights of Caribbean Dutch people, who are frequently understood as ‘outsiders’ despite their Dutch citizenship.Footnote 12 Though Dutch authorities no longer employed the word ‘race’ or used it as an administrative category following the violence of the Holocaust and the Second World War, in publicly-funded research, the consolidation of group identities based on kinship offers powerful evidence for the process by which ‘family becomes racial ontology’,Footnote 13 ushering in racist essentialisms through the backdoor of culturalist arguments about family life.\n\nFinally, this paper shows that, contrary to the consensual narrative of welfare retrenchment in the Netherlands, state expertise and the reduction of social spending did not go uncontested.Footnote 14 Oppositional voices emerged among social welfare organisations established by Caribbean Dutch people who identified state-funded knowledge production as uniquely harmful, promoting stereotypes of pathological dependency while weakening institutional support for Caribbean families. But activists did not dismiss expertise entirely. They called for a renewed intellectual agenda that studied racism within Dutch society and advocated for public services like childcare, community centres and family allowances. Ultimately, activist efforts to claim emancipation through the welfare state ran aground on the erosion of social spending throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nDrawing upon archival sources from Dutch state and municipal bodies as well as the published works and personal papers of prominent figures in Black family studies in Europe, the United States and the Caribbean, this paper tracks how knowledge about race and the family moved and to what ends. It argues that expert knowledge played a role in the organisation of the welfare state from the onset of increased Caribbean migration in the early 1970s to 1996, when important social legislation was overhauled. It begins by surveying the origins of a Black family studies programme and its relationship to racialised systems of governance in the United States and the Caribbean to outline the debates that captivated social scientists and bureaucrats in the Netherlands decades later. Secondly, the article turns toward Dutch state investment in social scientific research in the 1970s, which emerged to track Caribbean Dutch citizens in the welfare state. It then examines expert attempts to define and categorise the family in view of administrative demands and changing norms in European Dutch society, a process that constructed race through the taxonomy of kinship. Finally, it concludes by exploring the strident defence of public obligation launched by Caribbean Dutch organisations in the Netherlands, who at once criticised the effects of hegemonic knowledge production while reimagining the emancipatory potential of expertise in a climate of austerity."
