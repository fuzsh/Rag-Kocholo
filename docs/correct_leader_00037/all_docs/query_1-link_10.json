        "text": "While storms ravaged the Dutch coast and Sint-Maarten continued to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, the coalition talks remained stuck in the doldrums on the eve of Prinsjesdag – or ‘Budget Day’ as we’re fond of calling it. This week’s podcast gives you the lowdown on the history, horses and hats that make up the ceremonial opening of the Parliamentary year. We also tell you about a woman who lost €147 when she was caught short in Amsterdam and a man who lost €5 million when his nerves got the better of him on live TV, and explain why neither the prime minister nor the Dutch flower trade are as romantic as they might seem.\n\nIn this podcast we said the record for the longest cabinet was held by the Den Uyl cabinet of 1977. We did, of course, mean the Van Agt cabinet of 1977, which took office after Joop den Uyl had tried unsuccessfully to form a government.\n\nClick here if you’d like to donate to the Red Cross Hurricane Irma appeal Nederland helpt Sint-Maarten\n\nTop story\n\nFirst autumn storms hit Dutch coast\n\nNews\n\nNew government may bring back student grants\n\nAppeal for Sint-Maarten begins as island counts cost of Hurricane Irma\n\nInternational organisations bring jobs to The Hague\n\nOne in five Dutch millionaires is a farmer\n\nGame show loser loses again in court\n\nWoman contests fine for urinating in public\n\nDiscussion: Prinsjesdag/ Budget Day\n\nClick here (and scroll down) for a map of the route of the royal procession to the state opening of parliament\n\nPrinsjesdag timetable (Dutch government website)\n\nWikipedia page on Prinsjesdag"
