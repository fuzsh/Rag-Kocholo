        "text": "Foto: Wessel Wierda\n\nIn short, the WFC in Amsterdam-West is “a gathering place,” which, moreover, is open 24 hours a day. Or as the site of the WFC itself describes it: a “city within a city.” And as befits a good city, it also thinks about students.\n\nExam rooms\n\nEver since October 2013, UvA and HvA students have been trickling in here at regular intervals to take exams. Almost every faculty has already taken exams there. Past the shop windows of clothing stores in the void, students walk to an escalator that takes them to the so-called East and West Halls of the WFC. About 500 students per hall can be accommodated there.\n\n“It’s a fine location for examinations,” says Tubâ Ozcan, team leader of Examinations at the UvA and HvA. In front of the halls there is a large entrance hall with coffee makers, where lockers are available for students and proctors can gather, Ozcan said. “It’s quite large and spacious, and also easily accessible by public transport.”\n\nThe WFC installs the chairs and tables, and the UvA installs the laptops. Once in a while, the communication fails, which once resulted in over 1,000 freshmen seeing their microeconomics exam canceled upon arrival, for example. But normally everything goes smoothly, Ozcan says.\n\nText continues below image\n\nMultiple exam rooms\n\nThe World Fashion Center is not the only place where the UvA holds exams. They are also held at the IWO in Amsterdam Zuid-Oost.\n\nJohan Cruijff Arena\n\nDuring corona, Ozcan had to look for new exam venues because the GGD had to use many halls as testing locations to conform to the one and a half meter rule. So she diverted to larger venues, such as the Johan Cruijf Arena and the Amsterdam Passenger Terminal.\n\nWillem Endstra\n\nPrince Bernhard opened the complex in 1968, after former Prime Minister Joop Den Uyl, Amsterdam’s Public Works alderman at the time, first broke ground five years earlier. Since then, the WFC has steadily grown in size, with a second and third tower built in 1978 and 1986, respectively.\n\nThe architect of the WFC building is Huig Maaskant, who has designed many well-known buildings in Rotterdam. These include the Groothandelsgebouw (1955)—reconstruction architecture at its best—and the iconic Euromast. But even more famous than the building’s architect, is one of its former owners. Real estate criminal Willem Endstra, aka “banker of the underworld,” owned the WFC from 2000 to 2003. A year later, he was murdered at the behest of Willem Holleeder.\n\nThat did not contribute to a sparkling image for the WFC, the newspaper Trouw wrote back in 2008. “We would rather look forward than back,” the then-WFC director responded to the newspaper at the time. All the new facilities and the construction of a tech hub in the building with 6,000 square meters for tech start-ups underscore that ambition. “The city within a city” looks ready for the future."
