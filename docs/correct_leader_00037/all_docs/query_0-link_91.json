        "text": "When President Obama declared: “We don’t look to be ruled,” during his address to the Democratic Convention last night, the little voice inside me shot back: “Wait a minute Mr. President. Aren’t you the leader of our government?” When he followed that statement with the notion of self-government, the little voice heaved a sigh and sheepishly mumbled: “I get it.”\n\nThe idea of self-government is one of the founding principles of the American civilization. The idea is not universal. There are many cultures that value being ruled. They love their chiefs, emperors, kings, or queens. We don’t. We elect our representatives to our city halls, state houses or congress to fight it out on our behalf. If they mess up, they are out! At least that is our plan and our process. That we continue to adhere to this principle, in spite of major changes in our population mix attests to the strength of these values in our culture. But we should not be surprised that cracks appear in this foundation, that some of our fellow citizens are rethinking the principle, yearning for a ruler, looking to Trump to return them to the proverbial “good old days”. Their choice may be a symptom of cracks in our foundation. Such cracks are unavoidable in any society, and are probably more pronounced in America due to our population mix and dynamism.\n\nThe challenge for those who believe in our founding principles is to watch for those cracks and mend them promptly.\n\nIn my view, this mending is in progress and the country continues to adhere to this founding principle even as it adapts to the changing outlook and needs of its people. Three reasons give me hope for the future.\n\nWhen Obama was elected President, his detractors threw everything in his way to ensure failure of his presidency. He won his second term and is ending his time in office with the approval of a majority of Americans.\n\nA major political party has just nominated its first female candidate for president and she has a good chance of becoming America’s first Madame President.\n\nAmericans have recovered from their unfounded fear of democratic socialism and have accepted Bernie Sanders as a serious candidate for President of the United States. In 1980 when our European allies such as Willy Brandt of (West) Germany, Joop den Uyl of the Netherlands, Francois Mitterrand of France, Olof Palme of Sweden, and others attended the “Eurosocialism and America” conference in our capital city, Washington, most American political leaders left town or hid in their closets—lest they should be caught by the media crossing the path of a Socialist. As I recall, the only American elected leader who dared to attend the conference was Ron Dellums of California. Times do change.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton wins this election, she will serve an America that is more ready for change than the one Obama found. If Trump wins the Presidency, America will have failed to mend the wear and tear on its founding principle of self-government.\n\nSondlo@gmail.com"
