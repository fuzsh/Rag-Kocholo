        "text": "ROCHESTER — Police issued an arrest warrant Monday for a man charged with assaulting a convenience store clerk with a hamburger.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Daniel Cappiello signed a city police warrant for Tony Carr, 37, of 22 Wendy Lane, Berwick, Maine, on Class A misdemeanor charges of simple assault and criminal mischief stemming from a Nov. 28 incident.\n\nThe incident unfolded at the Highland Street Cumberland Farms, in East Rochester, when a man entered the building and placed a fast-food burger in the microwave, then attempted to pay for the hamburger as it was heating, police Sgt. Anthony Triano said.\n\nThe man became enraged when clerk Scott Litzenberger told him he had to bring the burger from the microwave to the front counter 15 feet away in order to pay for it.\n\nAfter a sharp exchange of words, the man walked back to the microwave, removed the steaming burger and walked back to the waiting Litzenberger.\n\nThe two apparently exchanged a few brief words again, when the man, \"just lost it,\" according to another clerk.\n\nInstead of paying, the suspect shoved the steaming, greasy burger into Litzenberger’s left eye, causing scalding burns, Triano said.\n\nHe then smashed the now dripping burger face-down on the counter and stormed out of the store without paying for the ruined food or helping the burned Litzenberger, police said.\n\nThe charge of simple assault stems from Carr’s use of the burger to strike and burn Litzenberger, while the criminal mischief charge stems from Carr’s destruction of the hamburger without paying, Triano said.\n\nPolice confirmed that the hamburger was taken as evidence after the assault.\n\nThe incident is apparently a common one, according to another clerk at the store.\n\n\"That time of night, you tend to get people who are belligerent. They want things they can’t have and we just try and do our job,\" said clerk Bill Rollo at just after 2 a.m. this morning.\n\nThe actual assault was surprising though, Rollo said.\n\n\"He (Litzenberger) didn’t seem too happy about it at all when I showed up to relieve him. He had a burned eye and eyeball. It was all red,\" said Rollo, who often replaces Litzenberger.\n\n\"I know Scott said that the guy was giving him a really hard time about telling him to pay for the burger up front, so he shoved the burger in his face,\" Rollo said.\n\nHe added that Litzenberger was slated to go on vacation at the end of the week, but should be returning to work on Thursday night.\n\n\"I think he was well enough to go on vacation and I’m sure he’s fine now. I know he got it taken care of that night,\" Rollo added."
