        "text": "Alfred Bester is an odd landmark in science fiction history. On one hand he’s indisputably a pulp author who put a heavy emphasis on pacing and excitement. On the other his experiments with typography and form prefigured New Wave Science Fiction and are occasionally credited with birthing the movement. He was a white man writing in the 1950s, so when describing a black woman’s skin color in The Stars my Destination he uses the word “negro” (which is unacceptable in modern culture but at the time was considered the “proper” way to say “black person”) but the actual character is independent, intelligent and holds a respectable job as a hospital worker who rehabilitates accident victims.\n\nIt’s Bester’s contradictions that make him so fascinating to watch, even when he’s not entirely successful. However good he is (or however bad he became after his hiatus), in his prime Bester was always delivering an experience that was somehow unique and strange. Case in point: The Demolished Man, a Freudian thriller.\n\nIn the 24th century, where a small fraction of humanity has developed telepathic powers, corporate executive Ben Reich is being out-competed by a rival company. Desperate to hold onto his power, Reich decides to murder the opposing CEO and take control of the market by force. The problem is that, thanks to the presence of telepaths in the populace, there hasn’t been a successful premeditated murder for 70 years. Armed with only his wits, a telepathic partner-in-crime and a very catchy tune Reich must cheat a seemingly flawless system and win a battle of wits with the police prefect, Lincoln Powell, one of the most powerful telepaths in the solar system.\n\nIt’s a great premise for a suspense story, but the execution is not what you’d expect. If you don’t have at least a passing familiarity with Freudian psychology then the book will make very little sense to you because the characters’ traits and behaviors are written for the express purpose of being in line with Freud’s theories. It’s similar to a magic system except instead of deciding which spells a character can cast it determines what a character does and how they behave.\n\nIt’s an interesting concept, but in some ways it’s the book’s main issue. In theory there isn’t a reason why one can’t change the psychological system by which characters operate in the same way that one changes a setting or, again, a magic system. In practice, however, tampering with character psychology means altering the system that has allowed works of fiction to function for the past millennia. If characters’ behaviors and traits don’t obey the psychological system that all people operate by then it becomes difficult to sympathize or get invested in their struggles (which is not to say that characters have to reflect the audience’s opinions). Some writers choose to take this to its extreme and create characters who are so utterly alien that they fascinate rather than endear, but Bester does not go this far, and so his characters are stuck in a limbo where they come off as strange but in a contrived way rather than a natural one. Then again, Bester’s strong suit is not psychology, which under him tended to be slapdash even when he wasn’t evoking Freud. Probably because he didn’t care about making sure everything lined up from one chapter to the next.\n\nBester’s approach to worldbuilding seems to be taking everything that he thought might be cool or help the plot and cramming it into this story with wanton disregard for consistency. People who obsess over inconsistencies and plot holes in fiction might end up frustrated by Bester, but I appreciate that in his universe there’s always an interesting idea just around the corner, which complements the breakneck pace very well. Even when he’s contradicting what he established previously he’s still delivering an exciting story.\n\nThere are some truly standout sequences in this book, even if the pace is too quick to tell the terrifying and claustrophobic tale that the premise implies. The writing can get a bit repetitive because the book was originally serialized—each chapter was a stand-alone story and the book is simply a collection of them—but on the whole Bester’s writing is every bit as precise and laconic as I’ve come to expect from him (I wouldn’t have it any other way). It’s a thrilling and strange mystery novel that at times even manages to be funny, but I must say that it loses steam by the end thanks to a twist ending that will come off as either absurd or lackluster depending on how much you buy into the setting’s Freudian cosmology and an unconvincing philosophical conclusion. The story is wrapped up a bit too neatly where an open-ended conclusion would have been preferable.\n\nAnd now an obligatory comment about the book’s gender politics.\n\nIn this respect the book hasn’t aged particularly well. There’s nothing outright insulting in the book’s portrayal of women, but it’s not what I’d call “progressive,” either. Some of this might be attributable to the book’s Freudian themes and feminist icons in the 1950s aging poorly (I’m just guessing; I haven’t done research into the matter) but coming to this from The Stars my Destination was disappointing.\n\nUltimately, for all its merits, The Demolished Man falls short of the high mark Bester set for himself with The Stars my Destination. It isn’t as tight, the ending isn’t nearly as good and Bester’s famed experiments aren’t as fascinating here. Bester’s attempts to portray telepathic conversations through designs created entirely out of words (right) is interesting, but even if it’s a more complex technique than anything he did in Stars it’s still not as memorable as the chapter where Bester uses changing font sizes and arrangement of letters in order to show a character experiencing synesthesia.\n\nAfter all that, however, I do recommend The Demolished Man. It’s a weird, fun and exciting little book that I appreciate in part because it’s well-constructed but also because it’d be very difficult to find anything like it in any medium."
