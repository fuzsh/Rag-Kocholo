        "text": "The main meetings of the European Parliament, also known as âplenary sessionsâ, take place 12 times a year in Strasbourg, France, and up to 6 times a year in Brussels, Belgium.\n\nThe European Parliament has 705 members, also called MEPs, from all EU countries. The number of members per country varies: more populous countries have more members than smaller, less populous ones. Members from across the EU with similar political views work together in political groups just as in national parliaments, instead of forming groups according to their nationality.\n\nThe European Parliament takes decisions on EU laws together with the Council of the European Union. If the Parliament and the Council cannot agree on a piece of legislation, there will be no new law. The Parliament elects the President of the European Commission and has the right to approve or to dismiss the whole European Commission. It also approves the budget of the European Union.\n\nconsilium.europa.eu/en/european-council\n\nThe European Council brings together the elected leaders of EU countries, i.e. the heads of state or heads of government. These leaders meet at least four times per year. Their meetings are often referred to as âEuropean summitsâ. The European Council sets the EUâs main political priorities and overall policy direction. It is chaired by a president who is elected every 2Â½Â years.\n\nThe European Council does not pass EU laws. That is the job of the European Parliament and the Council of the European UnionÂ â donât mix them up!\n\nIn Council meetings, about 80Â % of law proposals are decided by qualified majority vote, also called a âdouble majorityâ. Under qualified-majority voting, each minister casts one vote for or against a proposal, or abstains. As the number of people represented by each minister varies according to the population of their country, a âdouble majorityâ is required to adopt a decision fairly: at least 55Â % of EU countries (15 out of 27) representing at least 65Â % of the total EU population (around 447Â million) must vote in favour for a law to pass.\n\nSee here for more details: europa.eu/!fh76Jm\n\nTry out the voting calculator on the Councilâs website to see how this system works with the exercise below: europa.eu/!rM38Ru\n\nImagine your class has collected money for a school trip and you now need to agree on a destination. Someone suggests putting the proposed destination to a vote by qualified majority. Are you all of the same opinion or do you need to take a qualified-majority vote?\n\nChoose someone to represent the European CommissionÂ â they have 1Â minute to argue in favour of a certain destination. Pick another student to take charge of the Councilâs voting calculator. Assign each of your classmates the role of a minister from each of the 27 EU countries.\n\nEach âministerâ should then vote for or against the proposed destinationÂ â or they can abstain.\n\nCheck the result on the Councilâs calculator. What was the outcome? Were you able to agree on the proposed destination? Discuss your thoughts about this type of voting process with the group.\n\nThe European Commission president is nominated by the Member States via the European Council and is formally appointed by the European Parliament. The other Commissioners are proposed by their countryâs government and approved by the European Parliament. Commissioners do not represent the views of their country of origin but rather the common interest of the EU. Each member of the Commission is assigned responsibility for a specific policy area by the president, such as energy, the economy or the environment.\n\nThe European Commission proposes new laws and programmes in the general interest of the EU. Before making a proposal, the Commission seeks the opinions of national parliaments, governments, interest groups, experts and the general public, by inviting them to make comments online.\n\nFor more information about how you can make your voice heard in EU policymaking, see section: Your voice in the EU decision-making\n\nThe Commissionâs proposals are scrutinised in detail by the European Parliament and the Council. These two institutions take the final decision on all EU laws. They can amend proposals or reject them altogether. The European Commission also manages EU policies and the budget, and ensures that EU countries apply EU law correctly.\n\nThe European Commission is the âexecutive bodyâ of the EU.\n\nThe European Commission is responsible for managing the EU's budget, monitoring the application of EU law, and drafting EU laws.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nThe day-to-day work of the Commission is carried out by its administrative staff, experts, translators, interpreters and assistants. Commission officialsÂ â like the staff of other EU institutionsÂ â are recruited via the European Personnel Selection Office (epso.europa.eu).\n\nThese officials are citizens of the EU countries, selected by recruitment competitions. Around 32Â 000 people work for the Commission. That may sound like a lot, but it is in fact fewer than the number of staff employed by most large city councils in the EU.\n\nIf this sounds like a career you might be interested in, you can apply for an EUÂ traineeship with any of the EUÂ institutions.\n\nFind out more here: europa.eu/!tu37Kg\n\nEXERCISE 8 LAW-MAKING IN THEÂ EU\n\nThe most common procedure for making laws in the EU is called the âordinary legislative procedureâ. With this procedure, proposals for a new law are examined up to three times (in so-called readings). If no agreement can be reached, the proposal is withdrawn.\n\nThe EU treaties specify who can pass laws in what areas: the EU, national governments or both. EU countries are responsible for making their own decisions and laws in certain areas of national policy like industry, health and education. In these areas, the EU only provides support to national governments. In areas where the EU or national governments can act, the EU may only take action if it can do so more effectively.\n\nFind out more aboutÂ EU competences: europa.eu/!Nm66pq\n\nThe readings mainly involve three institutions: the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission. Please put each institution in the correct box in the image."
