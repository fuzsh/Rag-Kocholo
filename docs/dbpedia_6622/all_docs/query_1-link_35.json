        "text": "Christian Democratic People’s Party, Swiss centre-right political party that endorses Christian democratic principles. With FDP. The Liberals, the Social Democratic Party, and the Swiss People’s Party, the Christian Democratic People’s Party (CVP) has governed Switzerland as part of a grand coalition since 1959. Its strongest support is found in the Roman Catholic areas of Switzerland.\n\nFounded in 1912 as the Swiss Conservative Party, the Christian Democratic People’s Party was created to represent the interests of Switzerland’s Roman Catholics. Since its founding, it also has included representatives of Christian trade unions. In 1957 the party was renamed the Conservative–Social Christian Party of Switzerland, and it took its present name in 1970. The CVP traditionally has been opposed to the centralization of power at the federal level and to federal taxation, favouring instead the raising of revenues by such means as taxes on tobacco and alcohol. The party supports the use of religious institutions and the application of religious values to the solving of social problems and has endorsed policy aimed at strengthening the family unit. The CVP has also encouraged greater participation by Switzerland in international relations, including support for aid to developing countries and entry into the United Nations (which the country joined in 2002) and the European Union."
