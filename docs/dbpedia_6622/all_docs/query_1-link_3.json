        "text": "Committed to creating a stronger Europe\n\nThe Group of the European People's Party (EPP Group) is the largest and oldest group in the European Parliament. Our roots reach back to Europe’s Founding Fathers – Robert Schuman, Alcide De Gasperi and Konrad Adenauer – and our Members come from all of Europe’s Member States.\n\nA centre-right group, we are committed to creating a stronger Europe, built on its people. After all, our people are our economy and the people of Europe are the largest economy in the world.\n\nOur goal is to create a more competitive and democratic Europe, where people can build the life they want. We want to give everyone an equal chance to succeed including family firms, small businesses, innovators, inventors, researchers, scientists and self-employed, amongst others. Equally, we want to provide a safety net for anyone who is struggling.\n\nWe see the European continent as a place where people travel, do business, invest, learn from each other, buy, sell, collaborate and team up. Do you?\n\nElected locally to represent your interests in Europe\n\nLike all Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), EPP Group Members are elected locally by voters in their Member State to represent local people’s interests on legislative and policy issues at the European level.\n\nMembers of the European Parliament are organised by political affiliation rather than country and may only belong to at most one political group. The EPP Group is the largest of the European Parliament’s seven political groups.\n\nThe Members you elected are there to represent your national interest at a European level, guided by the overall position of the EPP Group."
