The Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) consists of 306 members of the national Parliaments and 306 substitutes. They are divided into 5 political fractions:

Socialists, Democrats and Greens Group (SOC)

Group of the European People's Party (EPP/CD)

Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE)

European Conservatives Group and Democratic Alliance (EC/DA)

Group of the Unified European Left (UEL)

Members not belonging to a Political Group

The Austrian Delegation consists of 6 members and 6 substitutes who are all members of the Austrian Nationalrat or Austrian Bundesrat.

The PACE holds four regular plenary sessions per year and periodically meets in commissions. It develops resolutions, recommendations, opinions and guidelines for Governments, Parliaments or political parties. The assembly also monitors elections and crisis-regions in Europe. Since January 2022 Tiny Kox (Netherlands) is President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

The work of the Parliamentary Assembly has been conducted primarily by videoconference since March 2020. In June 2022, it will again be possible to perceive all aspects of parliamentary life in Strasbourg. The Austrian parliamentary delegation to the June session was correspondingly high-ranking.

Likewise, contacts between MEPs and the Permanent Representation can now once again be maintained directly.

Cities and municipalities that strive to achieve European standards in their administration can apply for the Diploma of Europe, the Plaque of Honor and the Europe Prize. Several Austrian provincial capitals have received the award in the last 74 years, most recently St. PÃ¶lten in 2001: List of award winners.
