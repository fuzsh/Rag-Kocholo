        "text": "01 of 19\n\nMarlon Brando (Don Vito Corleone)\n\nThe Godfather's success marked a comeback for Marlon Brando, whose appeal with critics and audiences had seemingly dried up by the 1970s. (At the time, he hadn't starred in a box office hit, or earned an Oscar nomination, since 1958.) His transformative performance as the wise Don Corleone won over skeptical Paramount executives and earned him his second Best Actor Oscar — which he famously declined, sending activist Sacheen Littlefeather to protest Hollywood's treatment of Native Americans.\n\nThe comeback didn't last, unfortunately. After another hit with the controversial Last Tango in Paris (1972), Brando's later career was quite scattershot, with the occasional success like Apocalypse Now (1979) balanced out by such notorious flops as The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996). His reputation for being difficult to work with also continued to worsen, and his roles became more and more sporadic. In 2004, Brando died at 80.\n\nRelated content: The 15 most fascinating revelations in The Contender: The Story of Marlon Brando\n\n02 of 19\n\nAl Pacino (Michael Corleone)\n\nCoppola fought hard to cast the then-unknown Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, against executives who wanted a star like Robert Redford or Warren Beatty in the role. The Godfather rocketed Pacino to stardom, earning him his first Oscar nomination and kicking off a string of acclaimed performances, with such films as Serpico (1973), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), and, of course, his return as Michael in The Godfather Part II.\n\nPacino has had an illustrious career in the ensuing decades, including another turn as Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part III and a long-awaited Oscar win for Scent of a Woman in 1993. He's continued to work throughout the years, with acclaimed roles in the 2019 films Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and The Irishman (the latter being his first collaboration with director Martin Scorsese) and his first regular TV role, as a Nazi hunter on Amazon and Jordan Peele's Hunters. He also portrayed Aldo Gucci in the buzzed-about 2021 film House of Gucci.\n\nRelated content: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Francis Ford Coppola reunite for 50th anniversary of The Godfather at the Oscars\n\n03 of 19\n\nRobert Duvall (Tom Hagen)\n\nRobert Duvall (like everyone else) earned a heap of praise for his Godfather performance, as level-headed consigliere Tom Hagen, earning an Oscar nomination of his own. He returned to the role for Part II, but sat out Part III. Though Duvall had drawn attention for his performances in M*A*S*H (1970) and George Lucas' THX 1138 (1971), The Godfather established him as a major figure in acting.\n\nDuvall won an Oscar for playing a country singer recovering from alcoholism in 1983's Tender Mercies, and continued to appear regularly on stage and screen, often to critical acclaim. In later years, he earned another Oscar nomination for 2014's The Judge; played an older power broker in 2018's Widows; and appeared in Adam Sandler's 2022 basketball film, Hustle.\n\nRelated content: Robert Duvall reflects on The Godfather mooning contest, working with Marlon Brando\n\n04 of 19\n\nJames Caan (Sonny Corleone)\n\nJames Caan was the rare actor Paramount actually wanted to be in The Godfather, replacing the initially-cast Carmine Caridi in the role of hot-tempered Sonny Corleone. Along with Duvall and Pacino, Caan secured a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for the film. He also appeared briefly in Part II, reprising the role of Sonny in a flashback.\n\nCaan worked steadily from then on, though in less prominent parts than some of his costars. He reportedly turned down roles in several successful films, including Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), Apocalypse Now, and Superman (1978) — with the latter two featuring his Godfather costar Brando. Caan is also known to younger audiences as Buddy's (Will Ferrell) curmudgeonly father in 2003's Elf. Caan died at age 82 in 2022.\n\nRelated content: Al Pacino, Kathy Bates, and more stars pay tribute to James Caan: 'The film world has suffered a big loss'\n\n05 of 19\n\nDiane Keaton (Kay Adams Corleone)\n\nAs with several of her costars, The Godfather proved to be Diane Keaton's breakout, carrying her from a burgeoning stage career to onscreen stardom. As Michael's embattled wife Kay, a small-but-crucial role in the first film, Keaton got to show off some emotional fireworks in Part II's explosive confrontation, and returned to the role again for Part III.\n\nKeaton went on to give acclaimed performances in such films as 1977's Annie Hall (for which she won an Oscar), Manhattan (1979), Reds (1980), and Something's Gotta Give (2003). On television, she appeared in HBO's The Young Pope (as a nun who raised Jude Law's titular cleric). She also starred in the 2018 hit Book Club and a 2020 Father of the Bride reunion on Netflix. In addition to roles in Mack & Rita (2022) and Maybe I Do (2023), Keaton reprised her Book Club role in the 2023 sequel.\n\nRelated content: Diane Keaton and Keanu Reeves give us the Something's Gotta Give ending we deserved at the Oscars\n\n06 of 19\n\nRobert De Niro (Young Vito Corleone)\n\nAfter unsuccessfully auditioning for several roles in The Godfather, Robert De Niro earned the role of the young Vito Corleone in Part II. Before appearing in the sequel, he had received notice for his performances in the 1973 films Bang the Drum Slowly and Mean Streets, the latter being his first collaboration with Martin Scorsese. De Niro won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for The Godfather Part II, making him and Brando the first actors to win Oscars for playing the same character.\n\nDe Niro became one of the most acclaimed actors of the New Hollywood era with his performances in Taxi Driver (1976), The Deer Hunter (1978), and Raging Bull (1980), among other films. His later projects include Joker (2019), in a role nodding to his and Scorsese's The King of Comedy; The Irishman (2019), which reunited him with both Pacino and Scorsese; The War With Grandpa (2020), a movie only notable for dethroning Tenet at the box office during the COVID-19 pandemic; and Amsterdam (2022), a star-studded ensemble film directed by David O. Russell. De Niro teamed with Scorsese yet again for the anticipated Killers of the Flower Moon (2023).\n\nRelated content: The 20 essential Robert De Niro performances\n\n07 of 19\n\nJohn Cazale (Fredo Corleone)\n\nJohn Cazale made his feature film debut with The Godfather, coming off of several Off Broadway stage roles. Though he has relatively little screen time in the first film, Cazale made an impression on Coppola, who cast him in 1974's The Conversation and significantly expanded Cazale's role — Michael's soft-spoken but ultimately treacherous brother Fredo — in Part II.\n\nCazale appeared in only five films before dying of lung cancer at age 42 in 1978. All five — two Godfather films, The Conversation, Dog Day Afternoon (1975), and The Deer Hunter — were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar. Cazale also continued to act on stage until his death.\n\n08 of 19\n\nAbe Vigoda (Sal Tessio)\n\nAbe Vigoda also mainly worked on stage before The Godfather, with just one uncredited screen appearance before playing wily capo Sal Tessio. He reprised the role briefly in Part II's closing flashback scene.\n\nVigoda's most famous role besides Tessio is probably the grouchy Det. Phil Fish on the 1970s sitcom Barney Miller. He appeared in numerous films and TV shows before his death in 2016. News outlets erroneously identified Vigoda as deceased multiple times before his actual death, which became a frequent joke during talk show appearances.\n\nRelated content: Abe Vigoda: Conan O'Brien remembers his silly side in touching tribute\n\n09 of 19\n\nTalia Shire (Connie Corleone)\n\nTalia Shire had appeared in a small handful of films before her brother Francis Ford Coppola cast her as Vito's daughter, Connie. Shire also appears in Part II and Part III, with Connie becoming a close advisor to Michael in the latter film. She received a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for Part II.\n\nShire went on to star as Rocky's (Sylvester Stallone) girlfriend-turned-wife Adrian in Rocky (1976) and its sequels (1979–1990), earning another Oscar nod for the first film. In later years, she guest-starred on Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce and Netflix's Grace and Frankie, and appeared in Working Man (2019) and Chantilly Bridge (2023). As a Coppola, Shire is part of a Hollywood family network: Jason Schwartzman is her son and Nicolas Cage is her nephew. She is also set to act in Francis Ford Coppola's forthcoming film, Megalopolis, which stars Adam Driver, Nathalie Emmanuel, Aubrey Plaza, and more.\n\n10 of 19\n\nBruno Kirby (Young Peter Clemenza)\n\nYet another actor who earned a major career boost from The Godfather, Bruno Kirby played Vito's longtime associate Peter Clemenza in Part II's flashback sequences. (Interestingly, Richard Castellano, who played the older Clemenza in the first film, played Kirby's father on a short-lived sitcom called The Super.)\n\nIn the '80s and '90s, Kirby became a popular choice for supporting roles in comedies, appearing in Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), When Harry Met Sally (1989), and City Slickers (1991), among other films. Kirby died from leukemia-related complications in 2006.\n\n11 of 19\n\nAndy García (Vincent Mancini)\n\nBefore playing Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son Vincent in The Godfather Part III, Andy García had already appeared in another mob movie, on the other side of the law: Brian De Palma's 1987 Al Capone picture, The Untouchables. For his portrayal of the loyal but hot-tempered Vincent, García earned an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nGarcía's subsequent appearances have included Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's trilogy (2001–2007) and HBO's Ballers. He's also booked roles in Book Club and its sequel (with Godfather Part III costar Diane Keaton), Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018), The Mule (2018), and a 2022 remake of Father of the Bride, as well as TV gigs on Modern Love and Rebel. (He also earned praise from EW for his performance — as a mobster! — in the play Key Largo in 2019.)\n\nRelated content: Andy García reflects on his Godfather dream coming true and 'unjust' Sofia Coppola criticism\n\n12 of 19\n\nBridget Fonda (Grace Hamilton)\n\nBridget Fonda's film debut came at age 5 in 1969; she appeared as a child in a commune in Easy Rider, which was directed by her father, Peter Fonda. (The former actor is part of a storied showbiz family that also includes grandfather Henry Fonda and aunt Jane Fonda.) It wasn't until her role in Part III — as journalist Grace Hamilton — that her career took off, however. Starring roles in Single White Female (1992), Singles (1992), and Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown (1997) followed.\n\nFonda retired from acting in 2002, and married composer Danny Elfman shortly thereafter.\n\n13 of 19\n\nSofia Coppola (Mary Corleone)\n\nSofia Coppola, Francis Ford's daughter, was famously cast in Part III at the last minute, after Winona Ryder dropped out of the film. Her performance as Michael's innocent daughter, Mary, was one of the threequel's most-criticized elements, with Coppola winning two Razzie Awards for Worst Supporting Actress and Worst New Star. Coppola also appeared in the first Godfather, playing Connie's infant son in the climactic baptism scene.\n\nCoppola has appeared on screen a few more times, including a small role in Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace (for which she earned another Razzie nomination; was that really necessary?) and a 2022 episode of What We Do in the Shadows, but has since found her true calling behind the camera. She received rave reviews for her feature directorial debut, The Virgin Suicides, in 1999, and has continued to earn acclaim for her subsequent films: Coppola was the first American woman to receive a Best Director Oscar nomination (for 2003's Lost in Translation), the Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion (for 2010's Somewhere), and the Cannes Film Festival's Best Director award (for 2017's The Beguiled). Her father-daughter film On the Rocks, starring Rashida Jones and Bill Murray, was released on Apple TV+ in 2020, and her anticipated film — which is based on Priscilla Presley's memoir, Elvis and Me — wrapped filming in December 2022.\n\nRelated content: Sofia Coppola's movies, ranked\n\n14 of 19\n\nMorgana King (Carmela Corleone)\n\nMorgana King already had a thriving career as a jazz singer when she was cast as the Corleone matriarch in The Godfather. Known for her four-octave vocal range, King began performing professionally at age 16, toured nightclubs and concert halls for decades, and released dozens of albums. Oddly enough, she only sings on screen once in The Godfather, during the opening wedding sequence.\n\nKing had only a few other acting credits after The Godfather, including a 1993 guest role on the soap opera All My Children. She died in March 2018.\n\n15 of 19\n\nLee Strasberg (Hyman Roth)\n\nLee Strasberg's significance to the Godfather films goes far beyond his Part II role as fading Mob titan Hyman Roth. As the director of New York's legendary Actors Studio, Strasberg helped pioneer the \"Method\" school of acting utilized by Brando, De Niro, Pacino, and many others. His performance as Roth was one of only a few onscreen roles, and it earned Strasberg his only Oscar nomination.\n\nStrasberg's legacy lives on through the acting techniques he helped develop, which changed screen acting as we know it and are still widely taught and utilized to this day. Strasberg died unexpectedly at age 80 in 1982.\n\n16 of 19\n\nGianni Russo (Carlo Rizzi)\n\nGianni Russo made his film debut in The Godfather as Connie's abusive husband, Carlo Rizzi. But Russo's life story reads more like the opening stretch of Goodfellas: Raised in New York's Little Italy, he was a delivery boy for Mob boss Frank Costello in his youth, and claims to have connections to numerous underworld figures, though he was never deeply involved with the Mafia.\n\nRusso's screen career might be the least interesting thing about him. He has appeared in numerous small roles in film and TV, including Rush Hour 2 (2001) and Seabiscuit (2003). He's also, by his own account, owned a Las Vegas club and casino, \"known three popes, five presidents, and every Mafia boss,\" romanced Marilyn Monroe and Zsa Zsa Gabor, and defeated 23 federal indictments. And he sings, too!\n\n17 of 19\n\nFranc D'Ambrosio (Anthony Corleone)\n\nCoppola cast Franc D'Ambrosio as Michael's son, Anthony, in Part III after seeing him perform in Sweeney Todd on Broadway. D'Ambrosio's vocal chops (he later studied under famed tenor Luciano Pavarotti) made him an ideal fit for the role of the aspiring opera singer. He also performed a vocal version of The Godfather's iconic theme for the soundtrack.\n\nPart III remains D'Ambrosio's only screen credit. Shortly after the film, he began a six-year run playing the title role in Broadway's The Phantom of the Opera. He continues to tour and perform worldwide as a solo artist.\n\n18 of 19\n\nEli Wallach (Don Altobello)\n\nBy the time he played the treacherous Don Altobello in Part III, Eli Wallach was one of the most prolific character actors of stage and screen. He studied under Strasberg at the Actors Studio and appeared in such classic films as The Magnificent Seven (1960) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966).\n\nWallach continued to act into his 90s, and his career ultimately spanned more than six decades. His later work included 2006's The Holiday and the Wall Street sequel Money Never Sleeps before he retired in 2010. Wallach died at age 98 in 2014.\n\n19 of 19\n\nSimonetta Stefanelli (Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone)\n\nSimonetta Stefanelli's work before The Godfather consisted entirely of films in her home country of Italy. As Michael's doomed first wife Apollonia, she played a small but memorable role in the crime epic.\n\nDespite the attention The Godfather brought, Stefanelli did not pursue a career in Hollywood. \"They wanted nothing more than to expose my body,\" she told PEOPLE in 1997. \"I refused so much work.\" She appeared in several more European films before retiring from acting in 1992."
