        "text": "Director: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nWriters: Mario Puzo, Francis Ford Coppola\n\nCast: Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire, John Cazale, Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg, Michael V. Gazzo\n\nSynopsis: The rise of a mob boss is shown in parallel with the fall of his son.\n\nStory Analysis Description\n\n*Analysis based off work of Robert McKee, Joseph Campbell and Syd Field\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nMichael Corleone\n\nVito Andolini\n\nKay Corleone\n\nFredo Corleone\n\nSenator Geary\n\nVito’s Mother\n\nConnie Corleone\n\nFrank Pentangelli\n\nLandlord\n\nPrinciple of Antagonism\n\nControlling Idea\n\nYou lose your family when you compromise your morality.\n\nPLOT\n\nSEQUENCE LIST\n\nHERO’S JOURNEY\n\nARCHETYPES\n\nSCENE BREAKDOWN\n\nThe film opens with Vito’s mother’s short storyline. Her husband has been murdered by a local warlord and she is trying to keep her family safe. When her eldest son is also murdered, her focus turns to her youngest son, Vito, and his survival. This opening sequence establishes the world that Vito comes from, one where violence is prevalent and power is hard-earned.\n\nVito’s mother goes to Don Ciccio and begs for his life. When he refuses and kills her, this represents her Act Two Climax and the end of her storyline. Her mission to preserve her family has failed. Her death catapults Vito into his Inciting Incident, setting him adrift as he seeks to find his own means of taking control of his life.\n\nMuch as in the first film, the idea of America will be explored; Vito is an estranged immigrant, coming to the United States for a fresh start in a new land of opportunity. Seeing the Statue of Liberty, he crosses the first threshold into this new world, held back by people who misrepresent his name and diagnose him with smallpox.\n\nThe second Godfather film is a mirror image of the first, but distorted. The basic story beats repeat themselves, but with the family now under the power of Michael, these beats illustrate how he fails to live up to his father’s legacy. While the first film featured a happy party at Connie’s wedding full of relatives and singing, Anthony’s first communion ceremony is staid and hollow, devoid of love and all glitz and glamour. Michael is trying to buy love instead of earning it, like Vito did. This will be further emphasized by cutting back to Vito’s rise throughout the film, one man’s rise contrasted with one man’s fall. This is Michael’s Ordinary World, constantly trying to appease and be his father, before the lust for revenge overtakes him.\n\nMichael’s influence in the world has increased with his sway over government officials, with the reluctant Senator Geary standing as an adversary to his plans for expansion. Geary’s Inciting Incident occurs when Michael asks him for the gaming license in Nevada, an integral step in Michael’s plan. His Act One Climax here exposes his racism and commitment to hurt Michael, charging him an exorbitant amount of money. By directly insulting Michael’s family, he becomes Michael’s enemy.\n\nFurthering Michael’s business dealings, we learn about Hyman Roth and his failing health and Tom being kept out of certain business dealings, setups that will have payoffs later on. It is unknown when or why Hyman Roth decides to kill Michael, his Inciting Incident mysterious.\n\nConnie has lost her way after the events of the first film. She is aimless, sleeping around, ignoring her children. Her Inciting Incident is Michael cutting her off from the family’s funds, no longer financing her misguided ways. This is also a test of his own power and influence as he tries to emulate his father, but she does not view him with that same kind of respect.\n\nFrankie’s Inciting Incident occurs when the Rosato brothers cross him. Seeking Michael’s permission to eliminate them, he’s refused because of Michael’s deal with Hyman Roth, culminating in his Act One Climax. This tests Frankie’s resolve to the Corleone family, no longer based in love and kinship, but instead with fear and power.\n\nKay is unsure of Michael, relating to him how he once told her that he would make the family business legitimate. This hesitance is expanded when shots ring out at Michael in their bedroom, Kay’s Inciting Incident. This is also Michael’s Inciting Incident, setting him on a path of revenge, his life and power threatened. Unbeknownst to the audience, this is also Fredo’s Act One Climax, his Inciting Incident of being approached by Johnny Ola and wanting to help the family precipitating this attempted hit.\n\nAs he begins to embark on his journey, Michael uses this Tests, Allies and Enemies moment to maintain the trust of Tom. Putting him in charge of the family, Michael reveals that he knows of the existence of a traitor, a setup that will payoff.\n\nMichael checks on Anthony, insinuating that one day he will join the family business. This further shows the importance of Michael’s empire; his father gave it to him and he plans to give it to his son. Any attack against him is a threat to his father’s legacy and his son’s upbringing. Michael uses this logic as a justification for his actions, while in reality, he only seeks to feel powerful.\n\nVito is now a young man. He is surviving in America, married, working at a grocery store. His ambition is either latent or nonexistent, seemingly content going to plays and staying in his cultural neighborhood that reminds him of Italy. But there is a power system still at work, Don Fanucci extorting local businesses and accumulating power.\n\nFanucci uses his power to get Vito fired, a Progressive Complication that threatens Vito’s livelihood and family. Without means to support his new life, he must choose whether to stay legitimate or bend to other corruptible means of success.\n\nClemenza serves as a Herald to Vito, inviting him into the criminal world and a chance to take control of his life. By helping Clemenza and stealing the rug for his wife, Vito achieves his Act One Climax, entering the world of the mob and setting up a confrontation with Don Fanucci.\n\nRoth appears as a kindly old man, senile and harmless. Michael feels him out, testing him as he gauges who he can trust. When Roth gives the go-ahead to kill Frankie, Michael’s expression changes; he knows Roth’s been working against him.\n\nFor both Michael and Frankie, the realization that Hyman Roth was behind the attempted assassination represents a Progressive Complication. Michael’s road to vengeance becomes harder as Roth is a dangerous adversary, one that requires him to play a delicate game of seeming friendly while waiting for the moment to strike. For Frankie, he’s ordered by Michael to resolve his dispute with the Rosato brothers, complicating his morals and dedication to the family.\n\nFrankie’s near assassination by the Rosato brothers constitutes his Act Two Climax, a dramatic reversal in his fortunes. He believes he was betrayed by the Corleones, forcing him into seclusion and a decision that will impact Michael later on.\n\nAfter the murder of the prostitute, Geary is grief-stricken and dumbfounded. His Act Two Climax pushes him closer to the Corleones, their power over him complete. This demonstrates the Corleones lack of empathy to any life, even innocent, a harbinger of the carnage later in the film.\n\nAs Kay realizes that Michael is not acting on his promise to her, she also comes to the realization that he is holding her as a prisoner, not valuing her as a person, his possessiveness not bound in love but a desire to maintain his legacy. This serves as her Act One Climax, propelling her towards a decision to hurt Michael to restore her personhood.\n\nMichael keeps Roth close, going along with the guise of a business partnership. Whether or not he intends to expand his empire into Cuba without Roth is unclear, but it is clearly not his main motivation; he wants to kill Roth.\n\nA revolutionary blows up a police captain and himself. Michael sees this as an opportunity to avoid paying Roth the $2 million necessary for the Cuba deal, a way to stall Roth until the time is ripe for assassination. This is a continuation of his Tests, Allies and Enemies, searching for the traitor in his family.\n\nMichael believes that family could never betray him which explains his relatively loose composition around Fredo. He tries to relax, having drinks, explaining his plan. For Fredo, with the knowledge that he goofed up against the family, this represents his Midpoint; he thinks he’s in the clear. Michael will kill Roth and no one will ever know that he was the betrayer. He just has to keep cool and let Michael exact his revenge.\n\nMichael’s Approach to the Inmost Cave is this subtle moment of unspoken understanding between him and Roth. Roth knows that Michael had Moe Green killed and Michael knows that Roth ordered Frank Pentangeli killed. Neither admits these truths to the other. But Roth refuses to act because it would compromise business. Michael however takes Roth’s actions personally, seeking revenge despite the negative implications that would ensue. His murderous intent against Roth and eventually Fredo and Frankie is in direct confrontation with his business ventures. This represents Michael’s moment of truth, an opportunity for him to turn back and do the righteous thing. He doesn’t take it.\n\nMichael orders his bodyguard to kill Roth. When the bodyguard is caught and killed, this represents a Progressive Complication to his plans for revenge. Roth now knows that Michael knows and Michael’s hopes of a quick conclusion to their confrontation are dashed.\n\nMichael discovers that Fredo betrayed him, a shocking revelation. Whether Fredo’s motivations were personal or simplistic in nature, the betrayal rocks Michael’s core sense of family and puts his desire in a different light; to achieve revenge in the attempt on his family, he has to kill a member of his family. What would his father do? Can he forgive him? This is Michael’s Midpoint, a dramatic change in his journey. For Fredo, this is his Act Two Climax. He thought he was in the clear, but his betrayal is now known. He has to change his strategy if he hopes to survive.\n\nFredo and Michael are now in an intractable position. Does Fredo trust Michael not to kill him? Does Michael trust himself not to kill Fredo? As Fredo runs away into the nights of a rioting Havana, leaving Michael in the taters of a fallen expansion as Castro takes control of Cuba, this is Michael’s Ordeal, from which he must change to find revenge and keep his family.\n\nAs Michael attempts to regroup, Tom informs him that Fredo may be alright. He then learns of Kay’s miscarriage, a direct threat to his family’s legacy. Little does he know that Kay actually had an abortion, a realization that will shatter their relationship. Kay’s action constitutes her Midpoint, a direct attack against her husband for his evil ways.\n\nVito is prospering with his criminal syndicate, reaping rewards that were beyond his means as a simple grocer. But Fanucci demands money, a token that emphasizes his power over their borough. This is a Progressive Complication for Vito, putting him in direct competition with a warlord and pushing him towards a move that will determine whether his family will thrive or fail.\n\nWith their backs to the wall, Clemenza and Tessio argue that they should just pay Fanucci to avoid any trouble. Vito doesn’t see it that way though. Initially a triumvirate, Vito seizes the moment to become the leader of his criminal gang, getting the others to agree to a deal where they pay Faunucci less. This is Vito’s Approach to the Inmost Cave, a moment that will define his leadership and dedication.\n\nVito’s Ordeal is long and intricate, highly plotted as he meticulously follows Fanucci through a festival and to his apartment before he murders him. This is an action that Vito can not retreat from; he has murdered a crimelord and seeks to replace him. He launches himself into the mob world, becoming that which killed his mother, father and brother and threatens his children and wife. Vito refuses to be taken down by the same organizations that have plagued him to this point, using what he has learned to achieve power for the betterment of his own life. Rather than a repudiation of the criminal world, Vito seeks to make it his own, working with the Devil instead of rising above it.\n\nMichael’s Road Back features him profoundly changed; his brother has betrayed him, a Congressional investigation threatens to imprison him, his enemy escaped and his wife just lost their next baby. Back in Nevada, no one greets him. He is a ghost, trying to take stock of his life as he converses with his mother, a Meeting with a Mentor, but whose lesson he does not take to heart.\n\nVito’s Reward after his Ordeal is the prestige and power of being a crimelord. The film then pivots to a small subplot involving a landlord, an old lady and a dog to illustrate his standing in the community. The Landlord’s plot begins offscreen when he orders the eviction of an old woman due to her yapping dog. A friend of Mama Corleone, she appeals to Vito and his reputation to help her. This is a test of his charm and power.\n\nVito works to change the Landlord’s mind, paying him off. This is his Act Two Climax as the situation changes.\n\nVito’s reputation has grown indeed. The Landlord is scared shitless by Vito, stumbling away and letting the woman stay with a discount, his Act Three Climax. For Vito, this is his Act Two Climax, his power in the community assured, the only impediment to establishing himself in this new land the lingering memory of his past.\n\nRoth’s next move in going after Michael is to use the powers of the federal government to trap him, a Senate hearing having the potential to derail his family. For Michael, this is a Progressive Complication, the return of his adversary in a new, surprising way. For Senator Geary, this is his Act Three Climax. Though in Michael’s pocket, his influence is minimized by the Senate questioner Quedstadt, who belongs to Roth.\n\nMichael tries to outmaneuver Roth, reading a statement before the Senate commission, but he learns that a witness will be brought forward, threatening him. Another Progressive Complication.\n\nMichael and Fredo’s discussion is heartbreaking, revealing how far Vito’s shadow looms over them. With both trying to impress the spirit of their father, one son is threatened at the prospect of losing the empire and the other has betrayed the family in an attempt to make something of his life. For Fredo, this is his Act Three Climax, Michael severing their connection, leaving Fredo broken.\n\nMichael pulls an ace in the hole by finding Frankie’s Sicilian brother and stopping his testimony. This is Michael’s second Ordeal, emerging having overcome Roth’s final play against him. Frankie achieves his Act Three Climax, bowing to Michael’s power and forgoing his possible vengeance.\n\nKay tries to leave Michael with the kids, a foolhardy attempt that Michael would never allow. He tries to reason with her, appealing to the hollow hope that he will change. She doesn’t believe him though, worn down after years of waiting and talking herself into staying with him and not seeing him follow through on his promise to her. And then she crushes him, revealing that she had an abortion, her Act Two Climax, her only measure to strike Michael that would cause lasting damage. This irrevocably shatters their relationship.\n\nVito’s Road Back features him returning to Sicily, a successful man, a personification of the American dream. With the lessons he has learned over a lifetime of hardship, he is transformed.\n\nVito kills Don Ciccio, perhaps his only act of vengeance, the death serving no purpose to his business, but completing his arc from infant boy to crime lord. There is a cost as his friend Don Tommasino is shot and paralyzed, perhaps illustrating to Vito that all personal business carries risks, a lesson that Michael never grasps.\n\nThe death of Mama Corleone puts Michael in a perilous position; he never wanted anything to happen to his brother while she was alive. Now that she’s gone, Fredo has no value to the family. Will Michael follow through on his pledge to kill him? Connie attempts to talk to him, reaching her first and only Act Climax, dedicating herself to the family after years of wandering without purpose. For a moment, it seems as though Michael might change. This is Fredo’s Resurrection as Michael embraces him, seemingly part of the family once again. But a look to Al hints at a darker intention lurking.\n\nWith the battle seemingly won, Michael instead plans to eliminate his enemies. Tom points out the folly of his actions. He’s won. There’s nothing to be gained by going after Roth or Frankie. Michael sees no other option, his desire for vengeance clouding his own propriety. This is Michael’s fatal flaw, his desire for maintaining power controlling his actions, even beyond the point of acceptance, his Act Two Climax demonstrating that he will lose what he values most dear because of hubris.\n\nTom and Frankie pontificate on the nature of their business and where it’s led them. The family they’ve striven to build and maintain is whole, but decrepit, the capitalist nature of their enterprise breaking their moral backbone. With nowhere to really turn, Frankie Approaches the Inmost Cave, his moment of decision in what to do with the rest of his life. Tom gives him an opening if he chooses to take it, the opportunity to let his family live on after him; all he has to do is die.\n\nKay sneaks over to see her children, but Michael discovers the secret rendezvous and slams the door in her face with cold, calculating grandiose. This is Kay’s Act Four Climax, Michael literally shutting the door on their relationship. She is nothing to him, her journey with the family over.\n\nFredo and Frankie die, ending their storylines with their Act Four Climaxes. Michael’s Act Three Climax is the final elimination of all of his enemies, the final action in the degradation of his soul for which there is no return.\n\nThe flashback to Vito’s surprise birthday party illuminates the radically different fates of the principal characters of both Godfather films. Here they are young, protected by Vito, whose shadow looms large even though he never appears. As Michael refuses his father’s deferment, his initial character flaw is revealed, a desire to be his own man, free of the burden of his family, to be powerful no matter the people he hurts along the way. This is Michael’s Elixir, the knowledge that his choices were his own, his lust the destruction of his morality and his family, which he both loves and hates.\n\nMichael faces the results of his actions, which remain a mystery to the audience. Does he regret killing Fredo? Banishing his wife? Killing Sollozzo and McCluskey? Does he feel vindicated? Whatever Michael tells himself, as the audience views the elderly, tormented man, they can not help but feel the betrayal of his humanity and the life lesson to take from his journey.\n\nOVERALL\n\nThe Godfather Part II is a massive film. At over 3 hours long, there are 9 storylines, anchored by the father-son relationship of Vito and Michael. As one rises, the other falls. The film is a further emphasis on the themes of the first Godfather film, how Michael fails where his father succeeded and what their pursuit of American capitalism ultimately means to their roles as patriarchs of the family.\n\nMichael’s fatal flaw is the misappropriation of power with love. He tries to buy the respect his father earned, holding lavish parties and expanding the empire to Cuba. When his life and his family’s legacy are threatened, the lust for vengeance consumes him, falsely believing that eradicating his enemies will earn him unrequited respect. Instead, it alienates everyone, his facade crumbling as the pressure mounts.\n\nFor Kay and Fredo, they both try to reach a Michael that doesn’t exist anymore. After the trauma and sacrifices Michael endures in the first film, he is radically transformed. Fredo is unable to break through to his younger brother, failing to prove himself as a family member or a lieutenant, paying for his stupidity with his life. When Kay realizes who her husband has become, she hurts him the only way she can and aborts his child. By crossing him, they both sever their value in his view.\n\nThis stands in contrast to Vito, a personification of the American dream and also its downfall. Vito is an immigrant, escaping a volatile homeland with the hope of a new beginning. As he beholds the Statue of Liberty, there is legitimate hope that he could flourish and survive whilst Italy flounders in debts and vendettas. The wealth he accumulates through innovation and sheer will is passed on to his son at which point all meaning from it is squandered. Michael uses his father’s success to promulgate his own ego, mistaking the ideal of fairness from his father as a smokescreen to accumulating prestige and respect.\n\nFor as much promise that Vito is presented with, he still falls back into the old world view of criminality and power accumulation. A failure of the American promise, Vito is unable to make ends meet and turns to the same business that destroyed his family, using the lessons of his past to accumulate power. Vito, despite his success, therefore becomes a cautionary tale of the lure of power. He abuses the opportunity of America idealism and signs a deal with the devil for riches and respect, dooming himself to a life of crime and his family to a history of violence.\n\nThere’s a parallelism between both the first and second films, used to highlight the different approaches of father and son. Both films start with a party, continue on to an assassination attempt on the Don, feature a dramatic Midpoint murder, find a period of peace and end with a murderous rampage. Despite the similar circumstances, each instance is markedly different; Whereas Connie’s wedding is full of love and dancing, Anthony’s first communion is forced and sterile. Where Vito responds to the assassination attempt and war with calmness, Michael seeks vengeance. The murders of the five crime families feel almost justified compared to Michael wiping out Roth, Fredo and Frankie. Despite their similarities, at the end of the second film, Michael has lost everyone, his actions and motivations proving themselves careless.\n\nAs an antagonist, Roth is looking to the future, towards a new horizon, one where they can do business with a friendly government and expand. Given the nature of expansion, when he sees his partner, Michael, a young, eager and feared mob boss, he feels threatened by the possibility of his promise. Little does Roth realize though, Michael does not hold any promise, his life more hollow than the aging Roth. The entire conflict is ultimately based on a lie, both Michael and Roth misjudging the other, resulting in a resolution that leaves both losers.\n\nThe Godfather Part II expands the canvas of the Godfather world, incorporating old Italy, thriving New York City, sleazy Nevada, tumultuous Cuba and crooked Washington. It gives a portrait of a world with multiple players, all corruptible and self-centered, from revolutionaries to casino owners to senators. In a way, this pulls back the facade of American exceptionalism, revealing the deviousness of human nature right in front of us.\n\nThe Godfather Part II is my favorite film. The first time I watched it, I hated it. I couldn’t fathom how different the film was to the original. I fastforwarded vast portions of it, not understanding how people thought it was any good. For awhile, I even though the third film was better.\n\nBut on rewatch, a remarkable shift overtook me. Unburdened with expectations, the movie stepped out of its predecessor’s shadow to become an involving drama of Shakespearean proportions. Everything about the narrative clicked, and I felt myself as Michael, as Vito, as Fredo. Who hasn’t wanted to live up to their parents? Who hasn’t wanted to make something out of their life? Who hasn’t wanted to appease their family? That identification made the entire narrative soul crushing, delivering a sobering lesson on the possibility of legacy. We can never become our parents, no matter how hard we try or refuse. If love is not willingly reciprocated, we will never feel that attachment to another. And the American dream is ripe with the potential for abuse because mankind is full of desires, dualities and conundrums that could ultimately destroy us. The Godfather Part II is an invaluable view into the human condition."
