        "text": "Along with Terminator 2, The Empire Strikes Back and Aliens, The Godfather: Part II is one of those sequels that is always destined to be in a tug-o’-war over whether it surpasses its predecessor or not. For my money, Part II is distinctly inferior to The Godfather, though for all the right reasons. This is a more ambitious, sprawling story that offers a more direct skewering of American institutions and hypocrisy. It’s also a maturer piece, taking time to reflect more on choices and consequences, and everyone looks more comfortable in their roles. But it’s also a bit too big for itself, and lacks the tightness of the film that sired it.\n\nThe key innovation here is the extended flashbacks, intercutting the present day storyline with the origin story of Vito Corleone forced to watch his mother killed in front of him, then escaping to America, rising up in his local community to sow the seeds of his business, before returning to Sicily to kill the old man who killed his father. It’s a story of long-held retribution, the silent child holding a grudge that would take decades to resolve. And we get to watch Vito become Vito, seeing him make his first offer he can’t refuse in the form of a murder of a local bigshot, before beginning his own brand of neighbourhood protection built on respect and favours.\n\nRobert De Niro plays the young adult Vito, and he’s extraordinary, both in his impersonation of Marlon Brando’s distinctive hoarse whisper, and in his combination of menace and charm. The recreation of early twentieth-century New York is spectacular, and seeing Vito working the streets, accepting gifts of oranges and grabbing unscrupulous landlords for a respectful conversation outside the barber is thrilling. He’s already a quiet, unpredictable man; his burst of violence when he kills the deaf, sleepy old man who killed his mother comes from nowhere, but shows us the man he can be and the reason he is able to inspire fear even while performing himself as a friendly man. It’s a beautiful historical sequence.\n\nThe disappointment is that this plot line is so subordinated to the Michael storyline, and never feels entirely satisfactory by itself. The thematic resonances are beautifully done, as Michael makes choices about family and channels his father in realising that he cannot let old grudges go. But while the connections are there to be made, the epic scope never entirely matches up as a coherent narrative experience, and it feels like the story of this version of Vito is begun but not allowed to properly conclude. In some ways, though, it’s a reminder that this is fundamentally Michael’s story, as he becomes the encapsulation of his father who exceeds what has gone before.\n\nThe modern storyline is far more satisfactory, as Michael engages in a long form cat-and-mouse game with whoever tries to kill him and Kay in their bedroom early in the film on the night of their son’s confirmation. Michael leaps into action, travelling around the Americas – Miami, Cuba, New York – to confront the old Jewish financier who he suspects is behind the hit; the Corleone sub-boss who wants to resolve things old-school on the streets; and the inside man who made the hit possible, who turns out to be his own brother, Fredo. The film never leaves us in doubt of Michael’s power, and as he slowly tightens the noose to bring together a series of brutal deaths in the film’s closing sequence, it’s a reminder of the sheer extent of his influence. By the end of the film he has defeated a senate inquiry, got rid of all his enemies, and is able to bow his head, alone, in a moment of private mourning.\n\nBecause this is a film in which Michael wins and yet also loses. Two things derail Michael. Firstly, he is in Cuba on the night of the revolution, and is one of the many rich Americans chased out of a country that has rejected capitalism and everything America stands for, thwarting all of Michael’s plans in the process. On a grand scale, Michael is doomed; he’s struggling to make the business legitimate, and America is increasingly not a place where crime families like his can operate. But on a personal level, he is emasculated by Kay. In the film’s standout scene, he tries to make Kay feel better about her miscarriage, only for her to shockingly tell him that she had an abortion, because she would rather kill his son than bring him into the world. It’s the only moment in these two films where we have seen Michael truly, unforgivably, brutally hurt. And while Kay is made to suffer for it, Michael closing the door in her face as she pleads with her son to give her a kiss, it’s Michael who is alone at the film’s close. He keeps neither his enemies or his friends close, and in his dark compound, alone, he may already be being forgotten."
