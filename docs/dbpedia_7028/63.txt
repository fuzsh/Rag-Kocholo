Featuring an introduction by guests from the Huntington Theatre Company's production of The Lehman Trilogy (June 13 - July 16).

Often regarded as the best sequel ever made, The Godfather: Part II is Francis Ford Coppola's continuation of the Corleone saga, following up his earlier masterpiece with another, a film that ambitiously expands upon the original's complexity and scope without losing any of its emotional intimacy.

Splitting the narrative into two timelines, The Godfather: Part II effortlessly weaves the past with the present, highlighting the parallels between Michael and his father as they both navigate the corrupt world of the Sicilian mafia.
