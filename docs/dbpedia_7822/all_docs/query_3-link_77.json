        "text": "Seeing several regiments faltering on the battlefield, Wellington ordered Gordon to ride for reserve troops and steady the line. His path included a sizable stretch of open ground and Gordon would have known that the chances of him crossing this unscathed were slim. Sure enough, the inevitable stray bullet found its mark, halting his progress mid-ride. There must have been several agonizing seconds watching from the side-lines, knowing that the fate of many men rested on those orders getting through. The wound however did not deter the valiant Gordon. Collecting himself, he raced off again, joined the reserve line, marched with them into battle and then galloped to re-join his Commander in Chief. On his arrival, Lawrence describes how Gordon “… was pale and drooping, and faintly said his orders were executed …” The alleged exchange which followed is stoically British:\n\n[Wellington] “Gordon you are wounded – I fear severely.”\n\n[Gordon] “I’m afraid I am My Lord.”\n\nAccording to Lawrence, Gordon died on his way to the surgeon, his duty fulfilled.\n\nEvidently Lawrence had been passing on tit-bits of battle gossip for a while to Isabella however, as you might expect, Lawrence’s version is highly romanticized.\n\nAccounts differ as to what actually happened to Alexander Gordon and how long he took to die. After being hit in the leg by a cannon ball – musket ball – grape shot [insert deadly projectile here], Gordon did indeed carry out his orders but far from expiring like a hero in front of his commanding officer, all accounts (including those of the attending surgeon, Dr John Hume!) agree that his leg was amputated and he died at half-past three on 19 June 1815; over five agonizing hours after the end of the Battle of Waterloo.\n\nWhatever you believe, the heroic expiration after duty done or the much more plausible (and painful!) death by amputation and blood loss, I think you will agree that Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Alexander Gordon deserves to be celebrated along with the thousands of heroes who gave their lives to help keep Europe free.\n\nThe full text of the letter reads:\n\n24 July 1815\n\nMy dear Friend\n\nThe papers that I send will give you the traits of heroism in Lord Wellington – the dreadful loss and hazard of the conflict – I send you one of a private nature – of Sir Alexander Gordon, Brother to Lord Aberdeen.\n\nLord W. seeing two or three Regiments giving way, told him to ride instantly to others in reserve, and bid them advance immediately to their support. The space of ground was comparatively open through which he had to ride, and when he had got about half way, they saw him stop and bend on his horse – An Aid de Camp of Lord W. said to him “Sir – Gordons stopped,” “Is he” said he “Then I know he’s wounded” but he was seen to raise his head and gallop forward as before – He reached the Regiments – he advanced with them, and then rode back full speed to Lord W but evidently hardly able to support himself. When he came up he was pale and drooping, and faintly said his orders were executed “Gordon you are wounded – I fear severely”, “I’m afraid I am My Lord.” They then took him off his horse and he died as they were carrying him to the Rear. He was wounded in the thigh, and an artery touched – died from loss of blood.\n\nLord Wellington and Bonaparte were twice within a few yards of each other, and the former threw himself into a square of infantry at the moment it was attacked by Bonaparte heading his Guards.\n\nAt one time all our Cannon were taken every one but Lord Wellington despaired “What a Conflict! What a Result! How dreadful as you see the loss! How imperishable the Fame!”\n\nI dine today with Sir Henry Towers at Fulham and will give you on Monday any new details that I may learn.\n\nGive my best remembrances to Mrs Marshall and believe me ever my dear Friend most truly yours\n\nThomas Lawrence"
