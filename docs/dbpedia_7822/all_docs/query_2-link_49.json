He was on his boat, on the ocean, doing what he loved to do. He was 64 years old.\n\nGord led an interesting life. He was talented, quick witted, well read and curious about how things work, or rather how things could work better. He was a loyal friend, who made connections with others that lasted a lifetime.\n\nHe spent his early adult years in the Canadian Navy where he trained as a steam engineer. Gord spent the last 20+ years working at Brentwood College in Mill Bay where he was instrumental in creating an energy management system that significantly lowered the school's carbon footprint.\n\nHe loved his work, and the opportunity to do things differently.\n\nGord was predeceased by his wife Patricia, and his parents Marg and Vince.\n\nGord is survived by his wife Sally, his 3 sons, Brian (Joanne), Micheal, and Adam (Kara), as well as his sister Kathryn (Gregg) and 3 grandchildren, Branden, Bria and Sage.\n\nFriends and family will gather for a celebration of Gord's life in July.\n\nThis has been shared 0 times\n\n0\n\nShares\n\nShare by Email\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on X\n\nShare via Text Message\n\nobits\n\nDialogue and debate are integral to a free society and we welcome and encourage you to share your views on the issues of the day.
