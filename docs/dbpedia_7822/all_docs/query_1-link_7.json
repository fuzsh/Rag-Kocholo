        "text": "grave http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=40520997\n\nAlexander Gordon (1635 in Aberdeen Scotland - 1697) of a noble line, fought as a Scot Royalist and was captured by Oliver Cromwell's army at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 at the end of the English Civil War. He was imprisoned at Tothill Field outside London over the winter of 1651-1652. He was transported to the New World in 1652 and entered into indentured servitude. His later victory over servitude became the legal precedent in Massachusetts.\n\nThe Alexander Gordon line is the earliest Gordon family in the New World according to the Gordon Genealogy DNA Project, and decsends from Adam de Gordoun through Sir William Gordon 1265 Laird of Strathbogie (now Huntly).\n\nAlong with many other Scotch prisoners, he sailed on the ship \"Liberty\", commanded by Capt. James Allen to Boston and was confined at Watertown as a prisoner of war.\n\nFor a year or more Alexander remained with John Cloyes, a boatswain, or mate, of the vessel living in Cambridge on the road to Watertown --near the site of Cambridge Hospital today.\n\nWhile there he formed an acquaintance with Samuel Stratton of Watertown, with whom he made a six year contract on April 25, 1653, as an apprentice, to learn the art of husbandry. This contract should have ended in 1659, but after a years work without pay, Cloyes sold Alexander, like chattel, to Samuel Stratton in Watertown, as a \"husbandry apprentice.\" The term apprentice was used in name only. Later, other consignments of this virtually free workforce was shipped to America and was used in the towns of Massachusetts and the adjacent provinces. As the story of the first consignment had whetted the envy of those who had failed to procure cheap labor from this new kind of auction block of slave laborers. They were sold to planters and mill owners, the usual terms was a service of six years.\n\nThose who engaged in this traffic, euphemistically hid with the label \"apprenticeships.\" The idea was that this label would encourage the masters not to drive their helpless servants to the point of ill treatment, although it is not believed that this was the situation.\n\nOn May 23, 1655, a number of them, including Alexander, complained of this inevitable outgrowth of bondage and petitioned the General Court of Massachusetts for freedom, but their request was refused.\n\nSamuel Stratton of Watertown had bought one of these Scotsmen; one Alexander Gordon. It is, of course, an open question whether these men/boys, unable to sign their names, or read, could read the indentures by which they were bound and in this particular case it is clear that Alexander Gordon was a victim of ill treatment.\n\nOn November 3, 1663, through the kindness of a resident of Cambridge, Alexander appealed again to the court in Massachusetts and was released from his contract. His six year contract with Samuel Stratton ended on paper in 1659. But Alexander was forced to continue working until November of 1663 when he won his freedom in a landmark court case in Massachusetts.\n\nAlexander made his way to New Hampshire, where in the company of other Scots ex-prisoners, he helped found the town of Exeter. He found employment at the sawmill of Nicholas Lisson.\n\nAt 28, Alexander Gordon married the owner's daughter, Mary Lisson(19) and became the forefather of the extensive Gordon family in New England.\n\nAlexander Gordon died in 1697.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Gordon_(pioneer)\n\nAlexander Gordon was born in Scotland in 1635. At the age of sixteen he was a young soldier in General Monk’s army in 1651 which went forth with the design to place Charles II as king on the throne which was vacant by the execution of his father King Charles I. On September 3 1651, roughly 12,000 Royalist of General Monk's army were holed up in the English town of Worcester. This became known as the \"Battle of Worcester\". During the 10 hour battle 3,000 were killed and 7,000 taken prisoner. Alexander was captured by English Soldiers led by Oliver Cromwell and was jailed as a prisoner of war at Tuthill Fields prison near St. Margaret’s church in London, England. Alexander was held prisoner thru the winter of 1651 and 1652. Daniel Stone of Cambridge, England secured his release from prison in the spring of 1652 on condition that he be deported to the colonies. That year Alexander sailed to America aboard the Liberty, a ship commanded by Captain John Allen. The liberty landed in Boston. Alexander paid for his passage with a six year bound labor contract with John Cloyes, also called indentured servitude. As part of his contract Alexander was confined to Watertown, Massachusetts. John Cloyes sold his apprenticeship to Samual Stratton in October of 1652 without compensation to Alexander for his year worked. Alexander appealed to the court twice. On his second appeal, Alexander was released from his contract. Alexender then moved to Exeter, New Hampshire and found employment at a sawmill owned by Nicholas Lissen. In October 10, 1664 he married Nicholas Lissen's daughter, Mary Lissen in Exeter, New Hampshire and was given twenty acres of land as dowry by his father-in-law. He received a grant of land of twenty acres from Exeter on 10 October 1664 which was adjacent to the land given to him by Nicholas Lissen. Mary and Alexander had eight children, 2 daughters and 6 sons. In 1675 enlisted the colonists army to help defend the colony against the Indian chief, King Philip. In 1695, at the age of 60, Alexander again enlisted in the army, serving in Capt. Kingsley Hall's company in \"King Williams War\". Alexander eventually owned several sawmills. Alexander died in Exeter, New Hampshire in 1697 at the age of 62.\n\nSPOW\n\nScottish soldier taken prisoner at the Battle of Worcester, 1652 and transported to America on the \"John and Sarah.\" Indentured to Samuel Stratton, Watertown, Mass., October 15, 1652 - 1654. Settled at Exeter, NH. where granted 20 acres in 1664. \"Nicholas Smith 1629 Genealogy\" says that Alexander was taken prisoner at Tuthill Field, London; Redeemed by Daniel Stone of Cambridge; came to NE with John Cloyes under verbal agreement, working passage with Capt. John Allen. Cloyes sold him to Samuel Stratton (Oct.15, 1652).
