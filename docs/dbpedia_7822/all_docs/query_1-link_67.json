During the next 10 years he was employed on various papers. He was the Washington, D.C., correspondent of the New York Enquirer and associate editor of the Morning Courier and New York Enquirer, his articles attracting much attention. He founded the short-lived Globe in New York City in 1832, and in 1833–34 he was the chief editor and one of the proprietors of The Pennsylvanian at Philadelphia."
