        "text": "Having returned from Indonesia with thousands of words of mostly jargon, sprawled over three different devices, two note pads and some toilet paper, Gordon has finally pieced it all together in fairly readable English in the form of his second book. Following the release of The Nepali Flat, Gordon packed in his job to become a full-time writer, taking probably the world’s largest pay-cut in the process. He is currently working his way through Chile and Argentina, with plans of traveling north through Bolivia and into Peru for his third book. Gordon was born in tropical Northern Australia to a pair of intrepid adventurers that soon began dragging him around the world. He spent four years at boarding school in Scotland, partook in a brief yet unspectacular stint at the University of London, studying Arabic, before transferring to the University of Jordan (in Jordan). Six months later he gained his first professional writing experience working as a sports journalist in the Gulf. He is off to see the world in 2018, starting with South America, with plans of trekking Morocco’s Atlas Mountains, the Canadian Rockies and pretty much anything that forms a bump on the earth’s surface. Please get in touch, he would love to hear from you!
