        "text": "On drug therapy Few medicines are to be prescribed, and these with the greatest simplicity. They ought not to be often changed, till a fair tryal is made of their Efficacy. By prescribing a Multitude of Remedies, and those too compounded, it is impossible to say to which the Cure is owing and this is the Cause why medicines lie so much in obscurity. A Physician I think should prescribe but one single medicine, unless he can give a reason for making an Addition such as to cover nauseousness, to make a Medicine sit easily on the Stomach, to prevent a Cathartic’s griping etc. In such cases one or perhaps two Additions are necessarily. There are 2 cases however, which often prevent a Physician from prescribing so few Medicines as he would wish to do. First, in some places of the World, a Physician is only paid for his Medicines and not for his Attendance, which puts a Man who must live by his Business under the disagreeable necessity of cramming his Patient with Drugs; in this Case, one should endeavour to study what can do least hurt, and should use the greatest elegance of Prescription. Another case is, where the Patient has an Inclination for Drugs, and if some is not taken every 3 or 4 Hours, he thinks the Physician neglects him, or does not know what to do with him. But unless a Physician is drove by Necessity to prescribe where it is not necessary, it is a very illiberate thing, and unworthy a Man of Honour to poison his Patient with Drugs. Particular Regard ought always to be had to the state of the Patient's mind. The Spirits and vis vitae ought always to be supported as a much as possible in all diseases, particularly in all the nervous disorders, and stomachic, which always affects the mind more or less — Such affections I have often seen removed by agreeable conversation, and perhaps a bottle of Wine, especially in Hypochondriac Patients — The supporting the Vis Vitae is particularly necessary in the case of Fever, for I certainly know of many People who have sunk under a Fever for want of a proper use of Cordials, especially Wine. Keeping the Mind cheerful and gently agitated, has also the same effects as moderate Exercise, and ought therefore to be much regarded in all Chronic Diseases having the least tendency to the Nervous kind. Lastly in those cases which appeared to be desperate, and where the Patient by the course of the Disease is hastening to certain death, any Remedy, however desperate, that may have a chance of saving the Patient's Life, ought to be tried. But this must be managed with great delicacy, as very often the Physician’s Character and subsistence depend upon the success of such Experiments and therefore I cannot recommend it as a general Rule. It is the Reproach of the Profession that so many have been cured by the rash Prescription of illiberate Quacks after being given over by the regular Physicians. These People however, have the advantage of Physicians that they have no character to lose. Where there is no clear Indication of diseases, what is proper to be done? If the disease is not very urgent, it is better for the Physician to lay by, rather than prescribe a Remedy, the Consequence of which he is not sure of."
