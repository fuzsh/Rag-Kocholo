The citizen recognized him from recent media coverage and contacted authorities.\n\nOfficers promptly responded and took Dykes into custody.\n\nHe has been charged with one count each of aggravated assault, assault with a weapon, break and enter with intent, robbery, and four counts of breach of probation.\n\nThe accused was held for a bail hearing.\n\nPolice are thanking the media and the public for their assistance with this investigation.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact YRPS’s #2 District Criminal Investigations Bureau at 1-866-876-5423, ext. 7241, or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477) or going online at www.1800222tips.com.\n\nWith files from CTV News Toronto's Alex Arsenych"
