        "text": "In itself, his appointment amounts to something of a mini comeback. He helped mastermind Labour’s landslide election victory in 2001 as campaign co-ordinator, overseeing the work of the government’s influential strategy unit.\n\nIn 2003 he was promoted to the cabinet but ahead of this month’s UK general election, he was sidelined. He was replaced by the loyal Blairite Alan Milburn and in a September 2004 reshuffle was given a junior trade minister’s job without cabinet status.\n\nNow though, Alexander is firmly back centre-stage, appointed as successor to Denis MacShane as minister for Europe. The post has been upgraded to allow Alexander, described as one of the brightest of Labour’s rising stars, to attend meetings of the Cabinet, a move some see as a reflection of the importance Blair attaches to winning a ‘Yes’ vote in next year’s referendum.\n\nOthers point out that in appointing an arch-Brownite as Europe minister, Blair has tied Brown’s fortunes as well as his own to the referendum outcome. “The intriguing question,” says a Scottish journalist, “is how hard will Brown try to win the UK referendum on the constitution?\n\n“A UK ‘No’ vote would hasten Blair’s departure and potentially allow Prime Minister Brown to reconstruct the UK’s relationship with the rest of the EU.\n\n“The problem would be that the Europe minister of the time would also have to take a fall for the failure. But maybe Douglas is confident that Gordon would save him even from that. Brown is very loyal to his people.”\n\nStill aged only 38 (and often described as “ridiculously young looking”), Alexander is of a different political generation from Brown. But his relatively modest upbringing in Paisley, a town just to the south-west of Glasgow, has similarities to Brown’s. His father Douglas, like Brown’s, was a Church of Scotland minister. His mother, Joyce, was a hospital haematologist.\n\nHis childhood was steeped in traditional socialist politics: his parents took him in his pram to Labour Party rallies and on anti-apartheid protests. His father was politically active and close to the party’s senior figures in Scotland. He presided over the funeral of Scottish political grandee, Donald Dewar, in Glasgow in October 2000. Douglas junior joined the Labour Party when he was only 14.\n\n“Alexander’s upbringing,” says a senior Scottish Labour party source, “was very much the product of the Presbyterian ethic in which the idea of public service, of contributing something to the community, is absolutely to the fore.”\n\nHe was the youngest of three children. His sister Wendy is a member of the Scottish Parliament and was for a time a star of the devolved regional administration, the Scottish Executive, but she stood down as a minister in May 2002. Douglas later claimed that his sister had been the victim of sexism and that the power she held as a minister was resented. His other sister, Susan, lives in Canada.\n\nAt 17, Alexander won a scholarship to an international college in Vancouver. After a couple of years, he returned to study politics at Edinburgh University where he was, predictably, involved in student politics.\n\nIn 1988, he won a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania, one of the US’ eight prestigious Ivy League universities. During his year there he had a taste of American politics, working on the unsuccessful presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis as a press officer, before returning to Edinburgh where he graduated with a first-class honours degree.\n\nHaving twice studied in North America, Alexander is known to have a passion for the continent. One Westminster-based observer says: “He is something of an Atlanticist in his political outlook. He was one of a very small Labour Party delegation to go to the Democratic convention last year to meet the Kerry camp. He holds pro-US views.”\n\nHis final-year tutor at Edinburgh had also taught Brown and it was through him that he met the man who was to become his political mentor.\n\nAt their first meeting, at Brown’s flat, it is said that the pair spoke less about politics and more about the football match that they watched on television.\n\nIn 1990, Alexander began working as a researcher and speech-writer for Brown and the man described as “Gordon’s wee boy” has hardly looked back since. Even his domestic life has a Brown connection. In 1996, he met his Southampton-born wife Jacqui. She used to work for Brown’s wife Sarah Macaulay. The couple were married four years later at the Anglican church she attends in London.\n\nAfter a three-year spell working as a solicitor, Alexander found himself (reputedly thanks to Brown’s help) short-listed for the rock-solid Labour seat of Paisley South. He won it in a 1997 by-election, called following the suicide of its Labour incumbent Gordon McMaster.\n\nAs a newly-elected MP, he was an enthusiastic campaigner for Scottish devolution which resulted, in 1999, in a Scottish parliament in Edinburgh.\n\nA senior Scottish journalist describes Alexander as a “near-perfect evolution of a professional politician”.\n\n“The important thing to remember about him,” he says, “is that he’s never had a ‘real’ job. Look at his CV and the closest he comes to it is a brief spell as a solicitor but even then, I am told, his employer didn’t actually ask him to do much work, just put him on the books with a salary in the hope of currying favour with Scottish Labour and a rising star.\n\n“Even having to represent a constituency doesn’t mean he has to do much ‘retail’ politics: it’s the sort of seat where anyone would get elected as long as they’re the Labour candidate.”\n\nAccording to a senior Labour source in Scotland, many of his colleagues find his manner “irksome”.\n\n“He’s a young man with immense ability and the most intelligent of the various Europe ministers appointed by Blair. In terms of raw intelligence, he’s head and shoulders above them all.\n\n“But it’s got to be said he is also incredibly arrogant and finds it difficult to conceal his cleverness. People find this irksome.”\n\nHis critics point out that while he talks fast and has the air of someone who knows what they’re talking about, aside from his impressive educational record he lacks achievement.\n\nFollowing his role in Labour’s 2001 election win, he was made minister for e-commerce. At the time, Alexander was the youngest minister. In the reshuffle which followed the resignation of Stephen Byers, he became minister of state at the Cabinet Office with added responsibilities.\n\nA Westminster journalist recalls that last year “he was poised between being a Brownite and Blairite, so Brown didn’t save him when Blair expelled him to the periphery of the world as trade minister”.\n\nBut in this month’s reshuffle, it was the multi-lingual and fiercely pro-European MacShane who lost out.\n\nWith the UK presidency of the EU about to start, Alexander is assured of a hectic six months and not much time for his favoured pastime of fishing.\n\nBut Scottish Labour MEP Catherine Stihler does not doubt Alexander’s thirst for the job and for the tough task of promoting the constitution.\n\nShe says: “Douglas is formidable and having someone as driven as him in the post will do no harm to the job of promoting both the treaty and Europe.”\n\nAlexander remarked once in a newspaper interview that: “I serve a community and I serve a cause.” So will the cause he now serves be that of Blair, Brown, Europe or his own personal advancement? Perhaps this master of contradictions can succeed in serving all four causes at once.\n\nBiography\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1967: Born, Glasgow, Scotland\n\n1981: Joins Labour Party\n\n1984: Wins a Scottish scholarship to attend an international college in Vancouver, Canada\n\n1988: Wins scholarship to study at University of Pennsylvania, US\n\n1990: Parliamentary researcher for Gordon Brown\n\n1994-97: Solicitor\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1997: Elected MP\n\n2001: Joins government as minister for e-commerce at the department of trade and industry\n\n2002-04: Deputy Cabinet Office minister\n\n2003: Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster\n\n2004: Overseas trade minister\n\n2005: Minister for Europe\n\nAdvertisement"
