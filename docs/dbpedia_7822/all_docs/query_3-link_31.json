        "text": "1937\n\nDecember, 1937 visits Art Institute of Chicago during a train layover, goes to a movie theater where they screen the sinking of the U.S.S. Panay in a newsreel.\n\nWhen the train continues onto the end of its line in Seattle, Parks buys his first camera, a Voightlander Brilliant and shoots photographs by the Puget Sound.\n\nParks still living in Minneapolis, gets his film developed at an Eastman Kodak shop where he impresses the shopkeeper. As a result, they let him exhibit his work on 5th Street in Minneapolis, eventually. (Timing??)\n\nParks gets fired after a fight with his racist boss on the Northcoast Limited right around Christmas.\n\n1941\n\nIn the spring and fall, holds two solo exhibitions at South Side Community Art Center, presenting pictorial, fashion, and commercial photographs\n\nIllustrated article, \"Chicago's New South Side Art Center,\" by Dr. Alain Locke (of Howard University), September edition of Magazine of Art, 1941, the American Federation of Arts publication\n\nPhotographs Eleanor Roosevelt at an opening event at the South Side Arts Center in October, 1941 for Crisis.\n\nChicago Tribune,\"November 9, 1941, \"Our Town\"\n\nPhotographed fashions in Chicago and in his free time, photographed poverty in Chicago’s South Side. These images of Chicago’s South Side were what he was granted the Rosenwald Fellowship for.\n\nOther single cuts in various magazines, including an article by Vernon Winslow in Crisis, October, 1941.\n\n“Well, actually, Jack Delano came to . . . whom I admired very much; a very good photographer — was in Chicago on the southside and on some sort of project. I can’t remember what it was. And he, too, saw some of my work. He was the one first who mentioned that if I got the Rosenwald Fellowship certainly they would be happy to have me down with the FSA. And I went around with Jack on several of his assignments; he took me around and naturally I was rather thrilled, for here was a photographer from FSA; and he was such a gentle and wonderful guy, and still is. And so that sort of set my sights and when the Rosenwald people asked me exactly what I wanted to do I said I would like to be with the FSA. I then boned up on it to find out exactly what was being done. And that was the initial interest.” (oral interview 1964)\n\n1942\n\nBeginning of 1942, Parks is living in Chicago\n\nAt 29, Parks applies for Rosenwald fellowship by January 5, 1942 (period of grant allotment supposed to pass from May 1942-May 1943)\n\nAdvertisement for Supreme Liberty Life Insurance Company\n\nOn application for fellowship states he has this upcoming exhibition: Chicago's Women's Aid from Feb. 7-15, 1942 with Langston Hughes \"In this exhibit I will work closely with Langston Hughes, and we will attempt to work out a technique for taking the captions for the pictures from his latest book of poetry, \"Shakespeare in Harlem.\" (pg 3 of application)\n\nApril 18, 1942 Parks is informed of his acceptance and receives a grant for $1,800.\n\nMay, 1942 Parks goes to DC for his fellowship at the FSA, one of Roosevelt’s New Deal programs meant to show the “Face of America,” Americans living during the Depression years in rural and urban areas. Parks mostly stayed in the Northeast, documenting New England, upstate New York, and DC. “They were making an indictment of America – the terrible mess that President Herbert Hoover had left.”\n\nAugust, 1942, (contrary to Gordon’s accounts of January) Parks takes his famous portrait of Ella Watson, American Gothic, and follows her around for several weeks taking pictures of her at home, working, and at church.\n\n“I took her into this woman’s office and there was the American flag and I stood her up with her mop hanging down with the American flag hanging down Grant Wood style and did this marvelous portrait, which Stryker thought it was just about the end. He said, “My God, this can’t be published, but it’s a start.” So it was published. I sneaked it out and published it in an old paper that used to be in Brooklyn. It was published in Brooklyn, you probably remember, what was it called? I forget, a Marshall Field paper, do you remember that one?” (Oral interview 1964)\n\n“What the camera had to do was expose the evils of racism, the evils of poverty, the discrimination and the bigotry, by showing the people who suffered most under it.” (from “The Photographs of Gordon Parks, 1983.)\n\nParks experiences racism and segregation throughout DC, including in the cafeteria of the FSA building, although Parks refuses to sit in a segregated area there.\n\nJohn Vachon, one of the photographers with the FSA, becomes Parks’ closest friend (they go on to work together for the OWI and Standard Oil and Vachon briefly works at LIFE until he starts at LOOK)\n\n1943\n\nParks is asked by Roy Stryker to leave the FSA as it is being disbanded and absorbed into the Office of War Information and join the OWI.\n\nParks photographs the Tuskegee Airmen.\n\nFeatured in U.S. Camera magazine (with kind of degrading accolades)\n\nJuly, 1943 Parks returns to Harlem to photograph Richard Wright for13 Against the Odds , Edwin R. Embree’s compilation of biographies about distinguished African Americans of the time. (AIC Invisible Man, p. 15)\n\nAugust 1, 1943, Parks witnesses a riot outbreak in Harlem over the rumored death of a Black soldier at the hands of a white police officer (AIC Invisible Man p. 16 and A Choice of Weapons p. 241)\n\n1944\n\nSon, David Parks, born.\n\nGoes to work for Standard Oil Company in New York to be a part of Roy Stryker’s team of photographers there. Standard Oil had started a public relations campaign based on offering free high quality photographs of the American landscape to magazines. Roy Stryker was hired to direct the photography department. Standard Oil had a bad reputation from muckrakers (journalists exposing corruption and social injustices in corporations/politics, etc.) in 1910 in McClure’s magazine. The photographs weren’t used very much because they were free. All they wanted was the Standard Oil credit line.\n\nThe Standard Oil executives wanted to publish a corporate book and Stryker had Parks doing the portraits. One of the executives discriminates against Parks but ends up hiring him to do a portrait of his whole family.\n\n1947\n\nShoots for various fashion magazines, including Circuit’s Smart Woman in NY (December 1947) where he does a photoshoot including his wife, Sally Alvis Parks.\n\nJuly, 1947 Dr. Clark doll test story published in Ebony. Photos from Harlem psychological clinic.\n\nParks publishes his first book, Flash Photography on photo techniques. He had been sought out to do two books on photography techniques by Franklin Watts’ publishing house and was given a $1,000 advance, showing some of his work from Standard Oil and the FSA as part of his portfolio. Gordon chose some of the portrait subjects (i.e. Bob Flarity, Alex Leiberman, Tina Fredericks, etc.) and Mrs. Watts put in secretaries/friends from the publishing house, which Parks says “hurt the book.” Parks writes the text. He does not keep the negatives because at the time he did not think it was important to archive them.\n\nParks goes to Alex Leiberman’s office at Vogue and shows his work. Parks begins to freelance at Vogue."
