        "text": "COOKEVILLE, Tenn. In the closest thing to a debate likely to happen in Tennessee's U.S. Senate race this year, Sen. Lamar Alexander came out swinging against Democratic challenger Gordon Ball, who responded with barbs of his own.\n\nAlexander went on the attack right from the start Thursday at an early morning candidate forum in Cookeville — not the prime-time televised debate Ball has called for — with talking points and zingers, calling a vote for his opponent a vote for the \"Obama agenda.\" A vote for himself, the incumbent Republican said, was a vote for a new GOP majority.\n\nBall, taken by surprise at first, adjusted quickly, framing the two-term senator as part of the problem in Washington.\n\nAlexander went first, saying his opponent would be trying to fool the audience Thursday morning. He noted Ball's \"F\" grade from the National Rifle Association and cast him as supporting most aspects of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature legislative accomplishment. He raised recent revelations that Ball's campaign had used policy statements from the websites of other Democratic senators, calling it plagiarism and Ball just \"one more cut-and-paste vote for the Obama agenda.\"\n\n\"My opponent has a reputation as a very good lawyer in Knoxville,\" Alexander said. \"If you're a cocaine smuggler, and you're guilty, he's the one you'd want to hire to persuade the jury that you're not.\n\n\"I've made my money being a capitalist. He made his money suing capitalists.\"\n\nBall fires back\n\nThe Alexander-Ball race turned negative in competing television advertisements last week, but on Thursday, the day after early voting started, the same themes emerged in what could be the candidates' only chance to discuss issues face to face. The 74-year-old Alexander, seeking a third term in office, again turned down Ball's request for a series of statewide debates.\n\nThe two met at 7:30 a.m. in an off-campus Tennessee Tech University agriculture center, about midway between Nashville and Knoxville. It was not televised live, according to officials from the Tennessee Farm Bureau, which sponsored the event, but they said C-SPAN might replay it later.\n\nBall, a 65-year-old class-action attorney and self-described moderate Democrat, seemed surprised by the incumbent's gloves-off approach. He later said he thought the outing would be more tame.\n\n\"I really thought we weren't going to talk about each other, we were going to talk about issues,\" Ball told 100 or so farm bureau members seated in folding chairs. \"But my opponent, in his opening statement, talked about me.\"\n\nHe also defended himself: \"I'm a country lawyer, and I doubt I can spell plagiarism.\"\n\nBall introduced himself as a \"moonshiner's son\" from Cocke County and said he was raised in a home that had a shotgun in every bedroom. He said he believes in raising the minimum wage, equal pay for women and benefits for veterans — things he said his opponent is against.\n\nBall called Washington a \"quagmire\" and a place he's never even visited. If elected, he said, he would vote against reappointing Democratic Sen. Harry Reid as the Senate's majority leader.\n\nWhile Alexander was clearly the more aggressive of the two, Ball eventually fired back.\n\n\"If you want to change what's gone on under my opponent's watch in this country, you've got to change the people in Washington.\"\n\n\"If gridlock is Harry Reid,\" Ball said, echoing a statement made by Alexander, \"then why did my opponent vote for Obama and Reid 62 percent of the time?\"\n\nAlexander favored to win\n\nAlexander, a former governor whose political career spans four decades in Tennessee, is a heavy favorite to win another term. He has taken Ball's candidacy seriously, though, after collecting less than half the Republican vote during the party's primary in August.\n\nState Rep. Joe Carr, the tea party favorite, collected 41 percent of that vote, and while many notable supporters of Carr have now publicly backed Alexander, not all of them have, including Carr. In Ball, Democrats have a credible candidate, and one with money, having recently pumped $1 million of his own money into his campaign.\n\nSeeking to defy recent Republican momentum in Tennessee, Ball has claimed positions typically favored by the right. For example, he has come out against Common Core academic standards and taken a restrictive approach to undocumented immigrants. Ball said those two issues explain why Carr has refrained from endorsing Alexander.\n\nA debate over immigration — with the candidates accusing each other of being for amnesty — flared at Thursday's forum. But by the end of it, their positions didn't seem all that different.\n\nBall, calling for greater border security but not necessarily a fence, said he supports registering the nation's illegal immigrants to let them work but would make them pay taxes and have them get in the back of the line to become citizens.\n\n\"And I mean the back of the line,\" he said. \"Not in front of anyone else.\"\n\nAlexander, who has been under fire from tea party Republicans for his vote on an immigration bill last year that offered a path to citizenship, said his approach would penalize illegal immigrants and not let them get any benefits.\n\n\"The definition of amnesty is a path to citizenship without a penalty,\" Alexander said.\n\nAlexander, on numerous occasions, took aim at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Clean Water Act, accusing the federal government of overreach by regulating \"mud puddles\" and standing water in fields. He also said more time should be spent limiting child labor regulations on rural farms.\n\nBall, calling his commitment to protecting the environment \"second to none,\" referenced his class-action suit to help clean the Pigeon River in East Tennessee, a route he said was prompted by inaction by the EPA.\n\nAbove all, he sought to build a case for Tennesseans to elect a Democrat after years of sending Republicans to Washington. He said Republicans have gone too far to the right and Democrats too far to the left.\n\n\"That's why I'm running,\" he said. \"I'm tired of being stuck in the middle.\"\n\nDebates declined\n\nBall, talking to reporters after the one-hour forum, renewed his call for a real debate.\n\n\"We need to do this debate across the state, and we need to do it live and on TV,\" he said, \"so everybody in the state could see exactly where Lamar Alexander and I differ.\"\n\nAlexander, who declined that format in his 2006 election and has done so this fall as well, said, \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\n\"We're appearing on the same television shows,\" he said. \"We're interviewed by the same reporters. We have plenty of opportunities to let people see the choice.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison at 615-259-8236 and on Twitter @joeygarrison."
