        "text": "James Alexander Gordon, who has died aged 78, possessed one of the best known and loved of voices on British radio. For almost 40 years, he was the man whom generations of football fans heard reading the Saturday afternoon football results on Sports Report, first on BBC Radio 2 and more recently on 5 Live, and to an audience around the globe through the World Service.\n\nHis voice became almost as synonymous with the programme as Hubert Bath's rousing theme tune, Out of the Blue. As the music continued, a succession of accomplished sports presenters, among them Peter Jones, Des Lynam, John Inverdale and Mark Pougatch, read out the day's headlines over it before adding: \"But first, a full check of today's classified football results, read as always by James Alexander Gordon.\"\n\nGordon, or \"Jag\" as he was affectionately known within the corridors of the BBC, honed a style all of his own. \"Manchester United,\" he would say with an eager upwards inflection suggesting the home side had won, before adding \"five\". Then he lowered his voice to indicate bad news for the next team: \"Liverpool, nil.\"\n\nHe had never planned to retire, nor had the corporation any intention of moving him aside, but throat cancer affected his mellifluous voice and last year he underwent surgery and the removal of his larynx. When it became clear that he could no longer continue, the former Radio 4 newsreader Charlotte Green took his place.\n\nListeners may have almost felt they knew him, and his popularity with fellow broadcasters was a key factor in ensuring his longevity as a BBC announcer. Seemingly ever cheerful, always wearing one of his array of trademark colourful bow-ties, he was first appointed to the BBC in 1972 as a news and continuity announcer after Jimmy Kingsbury, Radio Two's head of presentation, heard him speaking. At the time, the network was looking to expand its range of regional voices: Kingsbury arranged an audition and was impressed with the Scottish tones that he heard.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh, James was brought up by adoptive parents who owned a public house in the city, and his upbringing was anything but that of the ex-public-school brigade who once held sway within Broadcasting House. When six months old he contracted polio, and said it was during the months he spent in a hospital bed that his appreciation of radio began. Unable to play sport, he had a limp, and learned to walk with raised-sole footwear.\n\nHe told the Edinburgh Evening News of how he arrived at intonations indicating home wins, draws and away wins while still young. The results were followed particularly keenly in an age when many checked their football pools coupons through listening to Sports Report â€“ including James's father. He was irritated by announcers' voices creating false expectations, so his son would collect the results and take them into a cupboard with a torch by way of mocked-up radio, with what struck him as greater success. \"When I did my first broadcast, dad cried and said, 'The wee bugger's finally done it.'\"\n\nThough he left school without any great academic achievements, he developed real talent as a musician. He went on to earn a living playing the piano on board cruiseliners, and then as a promoter of artists such as the bandleaders Bert Kaempfert and James Last, trying to secure for them all-important radio airplay.\n\nOnce on Radio 2 himself, Gordon read the news and presented a variety of programmes, before being asked one afternoon in October 1973 to \"nip across to the sports room and read the classifieds\". Nervously, he did so in the manner that was to become inimitable.\n\nFor several years, he shared the results reading with others while continuing to deliver news on Radio 2 and Newsbeat on Radio 1. But gradually he made the results spot his own and became an integral part of the Saturday team, loving the banter and storytelling in the BBC Club or the pubs close to Broadcasting House where broadcasters and production staff would unwind after the programme.\n\nAudrey Adams, Gordon's producer from 1983 to 2013, recalls how he would reduce his colleagues to hysterics with anecdotes such as his account of a night in what is now the Langham hotel, formerly owned by the BBC, in Portland Place. \"The place was reputedly haunted, and James, who may have had a pint or two, woke up and was terrified to see the ghostly figure of a man in Regency costume standing at the foot of his bed. He said the ghost disappeared only when he reached down to grab his heavy raised shoe and hurled it in the direction of the spectre.\"\n\nAfter taking redundancy from the BBC in the early 1990s, Gordon continued to work as a freelance, recording numerous voiceovers and company videos while continuing to read the classifieds.\n\nHe is survived by his second wife, Julia, and by a son, David, and two granddaughters, Molly and Martha, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce."
