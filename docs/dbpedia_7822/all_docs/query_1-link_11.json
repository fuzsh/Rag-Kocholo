        "text": "The convictions appealed from are affirmed (Judges McGowan and Smith for the court, Chief Judge Bazelon dissenting), except that in No. 23,190 appellant Alexander's convictions on three of the four counts of assault are vacated, as is also the sentence on the fourth, and the case is remanded for resentencing on such remaining assault count (Judges Bazelon and Smith for the court, Judge McGowan dissenting).\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\nBAZELON, Chief Judge:\n\nThe extreme length of this opinion reflects the number and perplexity of the issues presented for review. While brevity may normally be a touchstone of good writing style as well as sound judicial practice, it is occasionally essential to write at length on issues of far-reaching importance. The grounds of error raised on this appeal cut across our entire system of criminal justice. Appellants raise a very substantial challenge to the trial court's rulings on the admissibility of evidence, instructions to the jury, sentencing, expert testimony, and the nature of criminal responsibility.\n\nAt issue here are much more than technical rules of law devoid of any significance outside a courtroom or law school lecture hall. A racial epithet hurled at appellants by one of their victims touched off an explosion of violence and bloodshed, an explosion that reverberates the traumas of our entire society. We cannot rationally decry crime and brutality and racial animosity without at the same time struggling to enhance the fairness and integrity of the criminal justice system. That system has first-line responsibility for probing and coping with these complex problems.\n\nThe tragic events which gave rise to this appeal might possibly have been avoided by various means. Proponents of legislation for the effective control of firearms will find powerful ammunition here. But such measures can never reach the root causes of crime so long as we remain in ignorance of the mental agonies that produce bizarre and violent behavior. Criminal trials-and, above all, the responsibility defense-compel us to explore these problems, and thereby offer some slight hope that we will learn, in the course of deciding individual cases, something about the causes of crime. Not only the defendant but the criminal justice system as a whole has a vital interest in insuring that trials are conducted without significant error and in a manner that guarantees the ventilation of all the pertinent issues and information. We cannot afford to obscure the difficult questions for the sake of speed and efficiency in obtaining convictions, since efficiency of that order yields a specious economy. Appellate courts must scrutinize carefully the record of trial, and expose-where necessary with opinions as lengthy as this one-the difficulties that plague our efforts to improve the quality of the criminal justice system.\n\nOn the evening of June 4, 1968, five men and a woman-all white-walked into a hamburger shop, stood by the take-out counter, and ordered some food. The men were United States Marine Lieutenants in formal dress white uniforms; the woman was a friend of one of them. They noticed three Negro men sitting at the other end of the counter; these were appellants Alexander and Murdock and one Cornelius Frazier.\n\nWhat ensued in the restaurant had the tragic result that both Alexander and Murdock drew guns on the group, and that shots were fired that left two of the Marines dead and another and the woman seriously wounded. At a joint trial by jury in February, 1969, Alexander and Murdock were each found guilty of carrying a dangerous weapon, and of four counts of assault with a dangerous weapon. Murdock, in addition, was found guilty of two counts of second-degree murder. A separate hearing for Murdock on the issue of insanity was held in November, 1969, at the close of which the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. Appellants received consecutive sentences as to several counts, totalling five to twenty-three years for Alexander, and twenty years to life for Murdock.\n\nSince the case presents numerous and complicated issues and since the reasoning which underlies the Court's decision is expressed in part in this opinion and in part in the separate opinion by Judge McGowan, this opinion begins with a table of contents describing the Court's disposition of each issue and indicating the pages at which the discussion of each issue is set forth.\n\nPART I: TRIAL ISSUES 928\n\nA. Detailed summary of the evidence concerning the incident in the restaurant 928\n\nB. Alexander: The imposition of separate convictions and consecutive sentences was improper where a defendant, by a single act, put in fear different members of a group toward whom his action was collectively directed.\n\nBAZELON, C. J., for the Court 930\n\nMcGOWAN, J., dissenting 966\n\nC. Alexander: It is unnecessary for the Court to decide whether the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that they could convict Alexander of murder, manslaughter, or assault with a dangerous weapon on the theory that he aided and abetted Murdock.\n\nMcGOWAN, J., for the Court 966\n\nBAZELON, C. J., dissenting 934\n\nD. Alexander: If erroneous, the submission to the jury of the murder and manslaughter counts was harmless.\n\nMcGOWAN, J., for the Court 966\n\nBAZELON, C. J., dissenting 936\n\nE. Murdock: The evidence was sufficient to support a finding of malice; the instruction on manslaughter was unnecessarily confusing, and a revised instruction is proposed.\n\nBAZELON, C. J., for the Court 941\n\nPART II: INSANITY HEARING ISSUES 947\n\nA. Murdock: The trial judge correctly denied the proposed instruction on diminished responsibility.\n\nMcGOWAN, J., for the Court 967-968\n\nBAZELON, C. J., dissenting 948\n\nB. Murdock: The trial judge did not err in refusing to grant a new trial despite the exclusion of conclusory testimony by a government psychologist testifying in favor of the insanity defense.\n\nMcGOWAN, J., for the Court 967-968\n\nBAZELON, C. J., dissenting 952\n\nC. Murdock: The trial judge did not err in instructing the jury with respect to the testimony relating to the defendant's \"rotten social background.\"\n\nMcGOWAN, J., for the Court 968\n\nBAZELON, C. J., dissenting 957\n\nPART I: THE TRIAL\n\nFive United States Marine Lieutenants-Ellsworth Kramer, Thaddeus Lesnick, William King, Frank Marasco, and Daniel LeGear-attended a dinner at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, on the evening of June 4, 1968, in celebration of their near-completion of basic officers' training. After dinner, they drove to Washington, arriving about midnight, still wearing their formal dress white uniforms. They stopped for about an hour-and-a-half at a nightclub, where they each had a drink. They were well-behaved and \"conducted themselves like gentlemen.\" At the nightclub they met Barbara Kelly, a good friend of Lieutenant Kramer. They accompanied her to her apartment, which she shared with another young woman, and visited there with the two women until about 2:40 a. m. When the five Marines departed, Miss Kelly accompanied them, intending to return to the nightclub to meet another friend. Along the way, they decided to stop at a hamburger shop to get some coffee and sandwiches before the trip back to Quantico. The six of them entered the shop, stood by the take-out counter, and ordered their food. They noticed three Negro males sitting at the other end of the counter. As described by Lieutenant Kramer, \" [T]heir hair was in Afro-bush cut, wearing medallions, jersey knit shirts, sport jackets. . . . [T]hey were what I consider in eccentric dress.\" The three men were Alexander, Murdock, and Cornelius Frazier. The critical events which subsequently took place in the restaurant were described by the four survivors of the Marine group and by Murdock and Frazier. Alexander chose not to take the stand.\n\nAccording to the prosecution witnesses, Lieutenant Kramer realized that appellant Alexander was staring at him, and he returned the stare. \" [I]t was on the order of a Mexican stand-off type thing where you just keep staring at one another for an indefinite period of time.\" No words were exchanged between the two men, and Lieutenant Kramer soon turned and faced the counter. Shortly thereafter Frazier, Murdock, and Alexander got up from where they were sitting and walked to the door behind the Marines. Murdock and Frazier left the shop, but Alexander stopped in the doorway. He tapped Lieutenant Kramer on the shoulder. When the Marine turned around, Alexander poked his uniform name tag and said, \"You want to talk about it more? You want to come outside and talk about it more?\" When Lieutenant Kramer replied, \"Yes, I am ready to come out\" or \"Yes, I guess so,\" Alexander added, \"I am going to make you a Little Red Ridinghood.\" At this point, Lieutenant King stepped up beside Lieutenant Kramer and made a remark variously reported by the prosecution witnesses as \"What you God-damn niggers want?\", \"What do you want, you nigger?\", \"What do you want, dirty nigger bastard?\", and \"Get out of here nigger.\" Thereupon Alexander abruptly drew a long-barrelled .38 caliber revolver, cocked it, and pointed it at the group or directly into Lieutenant King's chest, saying, \"I will show you what I want,\" or \"This is what I want.\"The Marines possessed no weapons whatsoever and, according to their testimony, were not advancing toward Alexander. As they stood there, shocked at the sight of the gun, Murdock reentered the shop at Alexander's left and rear, and drew a short-barrelled .38 caliber revolver. A series of shots suddenly rang out, and the Marines and Miss Kelly fell or dived to the floor. None attempted to retaliate because they all were taking cover and trying to get out of the line of fire. Alexander and Murdock withdrew from the shop, but one of them stuck his arm back into the shop and attempted-unsuccessfully-to fire his weapon several times more. Only Lieutenant Kramer attempted to identify this man, and he said it was Murdock.\n\nLieutenants King and Lesnick were mortally wounded in the fusillade; they died within minutes. Lieutenant Kramer was wounded in the head, but he remained conscious, as did Miss Kelly, who had been shot in the hip. Only Lieutenants LeGear and Marasco were not hit.\n\nAlexander, Murdock, and Frazier fled to Alexander's automobile and drove off rapidly in the wrong direction on a oneway street. Alexander was driving, and as the car drove off, Murdock fired three more shots from the window of the car, at the door of the hamburger shop, and at people in the street. A nearby scout car raced after the fleeing car and stopped them within a few blocks. Two revolvers were recovered from the front floorboard of Alexander's automobile.\n\nFor the defense, Frazier and appellant Murdock testified that the Marines in the restaurant had been drunk and loud. Frazier testified that they had obstructed his exit as he left. He walked around them and left the restaurant just ahead of Murdock, but when he looked back, Murdock had gone back inside. He then heard shots and ran to Alexander's car.\n\nMurdock testified that when he realized that Alexander had not followed him out of the restaurant, he returned, and as he entered he heard someone say, \"Get out, you black bastards.\" He then saw the Marine advancing towards him. Murdock called to Alexander to leave with him, and Alexander turned as if to go. Murdock then heard a \"sound like all the feet in the place were moving,\" turned around himself, and saw Alexander's drawn gun. Murdock pulled his own gun, as a reflex, and testified that he \"commenced firing about the time one of them was actually right up on me. . . . . [M]aybe a foot away.\" He testified that the other Marines were advancing toward him fast, and he felt they were going to kill him. On crossexamination he admitted that he emptied his fully-loaded revolver at the Marine group in the restaurant, testified that he didn't know if Alexander had fired, and admitted that he fired three shots from Alexander's gun from the window of the car as it was driven off.\n\nWho fired the bullets inside the restaurant was an issue of some importance during the trial, but because of the testimony of the Government's firearms expert, both sides seem now to agree that Alexander did not fire his revolver inside the restaurant, and that Murdock-as he testified himself-emptied his gun at the Marines and Miss Kelly, picked up Alexander's gun in the automobile, and fired three shots with it from the window.\n\n* * *\n\n[The following instruction, which may be called the instruction on provocation, would immediately follow whatever second degree murder instruction was given.]\n\nNow, there was evidence in this case that one or both defendants acted in the heat of passion caused by provocation on the part of one or more of the deceased. I shall now instruct you on the rule of provocation.\n\nIf a homicide is committed in the heat of passion caused by adequate provocation, then the defendant is not guilty of the offense of second degree murder. In addition to adequate provocation, there must be heat of passion caused by that provocation. Both the provocation and the passion must exist at the time the injury or injuries causing the death of the deceased are inflicted.\n\n\"Heat of passion\" includes rage, resentment, anger, terror, and fear. Heat of passion may be produced by fear as well as by rage.\n\nProvocation, in order to be adequate to acquit defendant of second degree murder, must be such as might naturally induce a reasonable man in the passion of the moment to lose self-control and commit the act on impulse and without reflection.\n\nA blow or other personal violence may constitute adequate provocation. But a trivial or slight provocation, entirely disproportionate to the violence of the retaliation, is not adequate provocation to acquit the defendant of second degree murder. Mere words standing alone, no matter how insulting, no matter how offensive, no matter how abusive, are not adequate to acquit the defendant of second degree murder.\n\nYou are reminded that the burden is on the Government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant is guilty of murder in the second degree. With regard to provocation, therefore, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that provocation did not occur, or that any provocation that did occur was not adequate as a matter of law, or that defendant was not in heat of passion caused by that provocation. In other words, if you have a reasonable doubt whether or not the defendant acted in heat of passion caused by adequate provocation, the verdict must be not guilty of murder in the second degree.\n\n* * *\n\nTHE WITNESS: I don't have the raw -the actual MMPI which I want to talk about. I have the summary sheet. I don't have the actual 568 questions. I have his responses, but I don't know what the actual questions were. I just have a summary sheet here which essentially is just comparing the results of that, not breaking down to the various parts. I do have the results of other tests which I perhaps can go into to justify the sullen quality, the idea of being alone and against the system, and things of that sort.\n\nMurdock's counsel then attempted to elicit from the witness the specific test responses that the trial court clearly wanted.\n\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: What test do you have the actual questions or raw materials on?\n\nA: Well, I have responses, for example, to the sentence completion test which is a series of beginning sentences and the individual is supposed to then follow through and put the answers. Like, \"I like-\" and then the individual is supposed to add to this.\n\nQ: It there any such thing as a representative sampling of those questions?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Would you read several representative questions?\n\nA: O.K. Back home everybody is well. At bedtime I go to sleep. Men will be men. A mother should love her family. I need freedom. The future is not-\n\nQ: Don't read the whole test.\n\nA: This is just a sample. I am showing the fact that he is not-You know, this manner of questioning is most difficult to me. It is so difficult-These tests are looked at and combined, I mean, in its totality. Individually we can come up with some conclusions based on each test, but they only make sense when they are compared to other tests and the relationships between them comparing to what we know about the individual totally. I can't isolate and on the basis of a few responses say he is this or that. There is consistent evidence in various tests to show that he basically harbors a good deal of resentment, that he does seem to have a tendency to blame others for things he is very inadequate in. I have evidence which shows he does seem to feel basically inadequate and things of that sort.\n\nTHE COURT: Mr. Witness, you are entitled to those opinions, but you are not the judge. The jury is the judge of the facts and, therefore, you are required to explain to the jury in factual terms in whatever manner you wish to do it what the underlying material is from which you reach your opinion, because the jury is not required to accept the opinion of any expert and they have to weigh the testimony of experts and to do that they need to know what it is that the expert relied on to reach his conclusions.\n\nDefense counsel asked no further questions of the witness, apparently in the belief that he would be unable to elicit the kind of information the trial judge was demanding.\n\nThe problem of dealing effectively with testimony based on psychological tests is not a new one for this court. We have frequently seen attorneys and judges elicit from a psychologist a series of test questions and answers, thereby setting up an easy target for ridicule. It would be inappropriate to shield these tests from scrutiny by prohibiting such questions, especially in light of the fact that the validity of psychological tests is subject to considerable question within the mental health professions. Indeed, it may be that the validity of the tests is so doubtful that they should be excluded from evidence as a matter of law. But if courts are willing to accept the tests as legitimate diagnostic tools, it is troublesome to see counsel or the court attempting to discredit them in a particular case by ridicule, rather than exploring their acknowledged strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIt would have been perfectly appropriate to question Dr. Blum further about the precision of his tests, the margin of error in their results, and the significance of his findings in this particular case. He might well have been asked how closely Murdock's responses matched the standard profile on which Dr. Blum based his evaluation-whether Murdock fit squarely in a standard category or whether the psychological evaluation was more tentative. By asking exclusively for specific test responses, which could add little to the jury's understanding of the expert's opinion, the trial judge may have inadvertently cut off the flow of information about the statistical nature of the tests, information without which the jury could not evaluate Dr. Blum's opinion testimony.\n\n2. When the trial court's questions failed to elicit a satisfactory explanation from Dr. Blum, the court concluded that his testimony had no weight at all, and instructed the jury to disregard it. We need not decide whether that remedy would be appropriate if conclusory testimony were presented by a prosecution witness, or by an expert privately retained by the defendant. In this case, the deficient testimony was presented by an expert on the staff of a government hospital, who was required by law to examine the defendant.\n\nMurdock moved for a mistrial, arguing that if the court-ordered mental examination was defective as a matter of law, then it would be impossible to have a fair trial on the issue of insanity. The trial court rejected that argument, having previously observed that Murdock was free to move for the appointment of an independent expert instead of relying on the testimony of Dr. Blum. In my view, the ruling was plainly erroneous.\n\nIt is firmly established in our cases that a defendant with a potential insanity defense has a legal right to a pretrial mental examination at government expense. Accordingly, Murdock was entitled to rely on the government to provide a legally adequate examination at the hospital to which he was committed for observation. If the examination afforded Murdock at St. Elizabeths Hospital proved at trial to be inadequate, it is no answer to say he could have obtained an adequate examination by a motion for the appointment of an independent expert.\n\nThe trial court did not purport to rule directly on the adequacy of the examination; it ruled only on the adequacy of Dr. Blum's performance as a witness. It is clear, however, that a pretrial mental examination is inadequate for its purpose if the examiner cannot explain his findings to a court. In short, the defendant's right to an adequate pretrial examination includes the right to examiners who can perform as witnesses.\n\nIf Dr. Blum's testimony was legally inadequate, then that defect is not cured by the fact that another Hospital staff member testified about the pretrial mental examination. Dr. Pugh, a staff psychiatrist who testified for the government, based his opinion on a single interview and on the medical records, including a report of the psychological tests. Since the test results were presented to the jury, it was crucial for Murdock to present the views of the Hospital staff member most closely connected with those tests. When the trial judge concluded that Dr. Blum's testimony was inadmissible, he should have granted Murdock's motion for a mistrial, and ordered a new mental examination, by experts capable of explaining their conclusions to a court.\n\nIt should go without saying that Murdock ought not to suffer for the inadequacy of the government psychologist's testimony. Apparently it does need saying, however, since he is made to suffer by this Court's conclusion that he can be tried and convicted without adequate expert assistance. This case is only one among a great many which clearly demonstrate that the responsibility defense is nothing more than a public ritual, maintained to satisfy the public's need for the image-and only that-of fairness and justice. It is still another indication that we have junked the defense in practice. Honesty requires us to do the same with its theory and rhetoric.\n\nI turn finally to what I regard as a serious error in the jury charge on the issue of criminal responsibility. In order to put the problem in perspective, it will be necessary to review the testimony in some detail.\n\n1. Murdock relied primarily on the testimony of Dr. Williams, a board-certified psychiatrist, and professor at Howard University Medical School. Dr. Williams had examined Murdock on two occasions during his confinement in St. Elizabeths Hospital. According to the testimony of Dr. Williams, Murdock was strongly delusional, though not hallucinating or psychotic; he was greatly preoccupied with the unfair treatment of Negroes in this country, and the idea that racial war was inevitable. He showed compulsiveness in his behavior, emotional immaturity, and some psychopathic traits. Since his emotional difficulties were closely tied to his sense of racial oppression, it is probable that when the Marine in the Little Tavern called him a \"black bastard\" Murdock had an irresistible impulse to shoot. His emotional disorder had its roots in his childhood, in the Watts section of Los Angeles; particularly important was the fact that his father had deserted his mother, and he grew up in a large family with little money and little love or attention.\n\nDr. Williams stated firmly that in his view Murdock was suffering from an abnormal mental condition that substantially impaired his behavior controls. But he stated just as firmly that the condition did not amount to a mental illness:\n\nMy idea of mental illness is that an individual is out of touch with reality. He has auditory hallucinations, he has delusions, he has mannerisms that set him off as a different individual. He withdraws from society. And his behavior as such is tremendously bizarre. This is what I call, what they would call at Johns Hopkins, a major psychosis and a form of mental illness.\n\n* * *\n\nWhile the trial court denied the requested instruction, we cannot say that ruling was error. The judge carefully instructed the jury to resolve the question of mental illness in accordance with its legal definition; he told them they were not bound by medical conclusions as to what is or is not a mental disease, and he told them to ignore defense counsel's concession that Murdock was without mental disease. In this respect the instructions conform to the requirements set forth in our cases.\n\nBut the judge injected into the instructions a special note of caution, in response to the testimony and argument presented in this case. He told the jury:\n\nWe are not concerned with a question of whether or not a man had a rotten social background. We are concerned with the question of his criminal responsibility. That is to say, whether he had an abnormal condition of the mind that affected his emotional and behavioral processes at the time of the offense.\n\nIns. Tr. at 262. Defense counsel had objected to that instruction before it was given, because his theory of the case was that Murdock had an abnormal mental condition caused in part by his \"rotten social background.\" The trial court overruled his objection, deeming the instruction necessary to counteract what he saw as an attempt by defense counsel to appeal to the jurors on the basis of sympathy, or passion, or prejudice.\n\nIt may well be that the trial judge was motivated by a reasonable fear that the jury would reach its decision on the basis not of the law but of sympathy for the victims of a racist society. Nevertheless, I think that the quoted instruction was reversible error. It had the effect of telling the jury to disregard the testimony relating to Murdock's social and economic background and to consider only the testimony framed in terms of \"illness.\" Such an instruction is contrary to law, and it clearly undermined Murdock's approach to the insanity defense in this case. For Murdock's strategy had two parts: first, he sought to convince the jury to disregard Dr. Williams' finding of no \"mental illness,\" and then he sought to persuade them to find mental illness in the legal sense of the term. The jury could hardly consider the issue of mental illness without considering Murdock's background, in view of the fact that all the witnesses traced such disabilities as they found at least in part to his background.\n\n2. No matter what the trial judge intended, his instruction may have deprived Murdock of a fair trial on the issue of responsibility. But even if that instruction had not been offered, Murdock could argue that he was denied a fair opportunity to present his particular responsibility defense-a defense not clearly grounded on any medically recognized \"mental disease or defect.\" While the language of our responsibility test theoretically leaves room for such a defense, our experience reveals that in practice it imposes illogical constraints on the flow of information to the jury and also on the breadth of the jury's inquiry. Our test demands an \"abnormal condition of the mind,\" and that term carries implications that may mislead counsel, the court, and the jury.\n\nMcDonald defined mental illness for purposes of the responsibility defense as an abnormal condition of the mind that \"substantially affects mental or emotional processes and substantially impairs behavior controls.\" The thrust of Murdock's defense was that the environment in which he was raised-his \"rotten social background\"-conditioned him to respond to certain stimuli in a manner most of us would consider flagrantly inappropriate. Because of his early conditioning, he argued, he was denied any meaningful choice when the racial insult triggered the explosion in the restaurant. He asked the jury to conclude that his \"rotten social background,\" and the resulting impairment of mental or emotional processes and behavior controls, ruled his violent reaction in the same manner that the behavior of a paranoid schizophrenic may be ruled by his \"mental condition.\" Whether this impairment amounted to an \"abnormal condition of the mind\" is, in my opinion, at best an academic question. But the consequences we predicate on the answer may be very meaningful indeed.\n\nWe have never said that an exculpatory mental illness must be reflected in some organic or pathological condition. Nor have we enshrined psychosis as a prerequisite of the defense. But our experience has made it clear that the terms we use-\"mental disease or defect\" and \"abnormal condition of the mind\" -carry a distinct flavor of pathology. And they deflect attention from the crucial, functional question-did the defendant lack the ability to make any meaningful choice of action -to an artificial and misleading excursion into the thicket of psychiatric diagnosis and nomenclature.\n\nIt does not necessarily follow, however, that we should push the responsibility defense to its logical limits and abandon all of the trappings of the medical or disease model. However illogical and disingenuous, that model arguably serves important interests. Primarily, by offering a rationale for detention of persons who are found not guilty by reason of \"insanity,\" it offers us shelter from a downpour of troublesome questions. If we were to facilitate Murdock's defense, as logic and morality would seem to command, so that a jury might acquit him because of his \"rotten social background\" rather than any treatable mental illness, the community would have to decide what to do with him.\n\nIf acquitted because he lacked responsibility, Murdock would automatically have been committed to St. Elizabeths Hospital for further examination. He could then obtain an unconditional release only upon the certification of the hospital superintendent \"(1) that such person has recovered his sanity, (2) that, in the opinion of the superintendent, such person will not in the reasonable future be dangerous to himself or others * * *.\" Plainly, the Hospital would find it difficult to justify holding Murdock on the grounds that he was insane in any conventional sense. None of the psychiatrists who testified at trial, including those from St. Elizabeths, suggested that his \"sanity\" had ever been lost.\n\nNevertheless, Murdock may well be dangerous. We have no carefully-crafted technique for resolving the complex of legal, moral, and political questions concealed in the determination of dangerousness. Regrettably, those questions are now decided, at least in the first instance, by psychiatrists. We can only speculate on the outcome of their inquiry.\n\nThey might conclude that Murdock's rage and resentment were burned off by the explosion in the restaurant; the cathartic effect of his violent outburst may have made its repetition unlikely. On the other hand, the crime Murdock committed is a prototype of the crimes that arouse the greatest public anxiety. He seems to be a man whose bitterness and racial hostility have turned into blasting powder which can be touched off by a spark. Since there is no obvious way to insulate him from further sparks, and since the powder is not being deactivated, further explosions may be unavoidable. It would not be surprising if the psychiatrists took the view that Murdock is now, and is likely to remain, extremely dangerous.\n\nHowever accurate the prediction of dangerousness, it is not at all clear that the statute would permit Murdock's confinement. Read literally, the statute seems to establish a return to sanity and an absence of dangerousness as independent pre-conditions of unconditional release. D.C.Code Sec. 24-301(e). That reading would require the hospitalization of a dangerous person who lacked any mental illness whatsoever. Our cases have made it clear, however, that \"dangerousness\" refers to \"dangerousness by reason of mental illness.\" Thus, a defendant who was dangerous but no longer insane could not be involuntarily hospitalized. See Dixon v. Jacobs, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 319, 328, 427 F.2d 589, 598 (1970). If Murdock cannot be considered insane, the hospital would have to release him.\n\nWe are left, therefore, with an obligation to choose among four unattractive alternatives:\n\nA. We can impose narrow and admittedly illogical limitations on the responsibility defense to insure that a defendant like Murdock will not be acquitted on the theory that he lacked responsibility. By confining such a defendant in a penitentiary, we can avoid the difficult questions presented by the effort to hold him in confinement following a successful use of the responsibility defense.\n\nB. If we remove the practical impediments to Murdock's defense and he is, in fact, acquitted for lack of responsibility, he could be released from custody in spite of his apparent dangerousness. That result would conform with the principle that civil commitment is ordinarily barred where a defendant is dangerous but not mentally ill. And there are even precedents for the acquittal and release of dangerous defendants who have been brought to trial on a criminal charge. The fourth amendment exclusionary rule, for example, effectively precludes conviction of some defendants who appear to be dangerous. But that rule has been subjected to heavy assault even though it serves important, extrinsic interests-the redress and deterrence of unconstitutional action and the preservation of judicial integrity. Acquitting a defendant like Murdock and returning him to the street might also protect our integrity. But it would probably be more difficult to obtain public support for, or even unfriendly acquiescence in, Murdock's release than to defend the operation of the exclusionary rule. It could be said, after all, that acquittal would result not in spite of Murdock's dangerousness, but precisely because of it. Thus, while there may be no reason in logic why Murdock could not be returned to the street, as a practical matter that is probably an unfeasible result.\n\nC. If the community will not tolerate Murdock's release we can strive to find a vaguely therapeutic purpose for hospitalization. Skinnerian-like techniques may be available to re-program his behavior. We might conclude that they should be used and that their use justifies his confinement. But that will require us to stretch the medical model substantially so that new techniques can be applied to many persons not conventionally considered \"sick.\"\n\nI do not mean to suggest the existence of a bold line which segregates the orthodox, universally-admired techniques, from the techniques which are unconventional, morally and legally troublesome, and as yet unaccepted. Some commentators have insisted that the most traditional techniques, including psychotherapy, should never be imposed on an unwilling subject. And some of the techniques which raise the most profound moral and legal questions are already being put to use. Still, there does seem to be a continuum running from the less controversial to the more controversial techniques. Without suggesting that we can blink at the techniques that are now widely used, it seems clear to me that we must, at the very least, scrutinize with care the implications of advancing further along the continuum.\n\nD. Finally, if there are no known or foreseeable techniques for \"curing\" someone like Murdock (or if we are unwilling to utilize the techniques that may be available), and if the incapacitation of the defendant is a practical imperative, we will have to confine him in exclusive reliance on a prediction of dangerousness. That confinement would be nothing more or less than unadorned preventive detention.\n\nThe options that would permit us to acquit Murdock but hold him in custody nonetheless-preventive detention and a stretching of the medical model to permit the use of new techniques-raise profound moral and legal questions. Resolution of those questions would require a prolonged and thorough public debate. But however they are resolved, it is at least clear that each of these options requires an expansion of the boundaries of the civil commitment doctrine. We could strive to limit the expansion by applying the new rationale only to persons who have undergone a criminal trial and been acquitted for lack of responsibility. But as a practical matter it seems very unlikely that the expansion could be so confined. The new rationale would permit-perhaps demand -that all persons who are rendered dangerous by a \"rotten social background\" should be preventively detained. Or that all persons who exhibit antisocial behavior patterns should have their behavior re-conditioned. We cannot escape the probability, if not absolute certainty, that every effort to diminish the class of persons who can be found criminally responsible will produce a concomitant expansion in the class of persons who can be subjected to involuntary civil commitment. The implications in this context are staggering. The price of permitting Murdock to claim the benefit of a logical aspect of the responsibility doctrine may be the unleashing of a detention device that operates, by hypothesis, at the exclusive expense of the lowest social and economic class.\n\nThat result can certainly be avoided -even if we are unwilling to return the defendant to the street-by reading the responsibility doctrine so narrowly that the issue of post-acquittal custody rarely arises. (See Option A at pages 962-963 supra.) We could, for example, redefine the concept of responsibility so that it would approximate the concept of selfdefense. All civil and criminal sanctions on the nonresponsible defendant would be barred, and the test would be reformulated to ask explicitly, which defendants should escape all state-imposed sanctions. Alternatively, we could retain the medical model and acknowledge its illogic as a significant virtue. Psychosis may be an irrational test of criminal responsibility, but it does have a recognizable symptomatology. In the civil commitment context it may provide the only manageable stopping point short of a fullfledged scheme of preventive detention. These limitations on the responsibility defense permit an avoidance -perhaps to the good-of a confrontation with the difficult questions posed by preventive detention and the various forms of behavior control.\n\nOn the other hand, we sacrifice a great deal by discouraging Murdock's responsibility defense. If we could remove the practical impediments to the free flow of information we might begin to learn something about the causes of crime. We might discover, for example, that there is a significant causal relationship between violent criminal behavior and a \"rotten social background.\" That realization would require us to consider, for example, whether income redistribution and social reconstruction are indispensable first steps toward solving the problem of violent crime.\n\n***\n\n* * *\n\nEach of these approaches to the responsibility doctrine has significant advantages and disadvantages. No one can fault us for choosing the wrong approach. We can be faulted, however, for refusing to make any choice at all-or at least for refusing to confront the implications and shortcomings of our de facto choice. It is a critical responsibility of courts, legislatures and commentators to undertake a purposive analysis of the responsibility defense, instead of merely paying it lip-service in deference to its historical significance and our \"liberal\" consciences. Under each of the prevailing tests of criminal responsibility, the operation of the defense has been haphazard, perfunctory, and virtually inexplicable. If we cannot overcome the irrational operation of the defense, we may have no honest choice but to abandon it and hold all persons criminally responsible for their action.\n\nMcGOWAN, Circuit Judge:\n\nThe tragic and senseless events giving rise to these appeals are a recurring byproduct of a society which, unable as yet to eliminate explosive racial tensions, appears equally paralyzed to deny easy access to guns. Cultural infantilism of this kind inevitably exacts a high price, which in this instance was paid by the two young officers who were killed. The ultimate responsibility for their deaths reaches far beyond these appellants.\n\nAs courts, however, we administer a system of justice which is limited in its reach. We deal only with those formally accused under laws which define criminal accountability narrowly. Our function on these appeals is to determine whether appellants had a fair opportunity to defend themselves, and were tried and sentenced according to law.No. 23,190\n\nAppellant Alexander in his appeal raises only the question of whether there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict against him on the four counts of assault. He urged in this regard that the record evidence did not establish that Alexander had pointed his gun at any of the four people who were the subject of these counts. Alternatively, Alexander asserted that, even if the evidence be taken to indicate that Alexander had pointed his gun at the four people as a group, that in law could only constitute one offense of assault as distinct from four; and that only one sentence could be imposed by way of punishment.\n\nThe testimony with respect to the pointing of the gun by Alexander is somewhat diverse and confused, which is not surprising considering the circumstances from which it arose. What does emerge incontestably is that Alexander pointed his gun in a menacing manner at the Marine party, and that each of that group was reasonably justified in believing that he or she was in mortal danger, thereby giving rise in my view to separate offenses of assault. My colleagues, although not rejecting this view of the testimony, have concluded that only one offense of assault could have been committed; and they therefore vacate the convictions on three counts of assault and remand for resentencing on the fourth. I, on the authority of Barringer v. United States, 130 U.S.App. D.C. 186, 399 F.2d 557 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1057, 89 S. Ct. 697, 21 L. Ed. 2d 698 (1969), do not agree that the sentences are improper.\n\nAlthough the issue is not raised by appellant Alexander, Judge Bazelon would reverse his assault convictions on the ground that an erroneous aiding and abetting instruction was given and that, despite the jury's eventual finding that Alexander was not guilty of second degree murder, Alexander was fatally prejudiced in the jury's consideration of the assault counts. Judge Smith and I are of the view that no such result is compelled on this record. Pretermitting, for present purposes only, the question of whether the aiding and abetting instruction was or was not justified by the evidence, it is obvious that its practical significance for Alexander-and for the jury-was in relation to Alexander's possible complicity in the actual shooting by Murdock. It seems wholly unlikely that the jury could have had any doubts about Alexander's prior and independent confrontation of the Marine party with his own gun.\n\nThe aiding and abetting instruction undoubtedly gave the jury a difficult problem with respect to Alexander's accountability under the second degree murder charge. Its verdict of not guilty suggests strongly that the jury did not believe that Alexander anticipated the shooting intervention by Murdock. It does not suggest the thought that Alexander's only assault was that of aiding Murdock to menace the party by this intervention. Thus, our conclusion is that, even if it be assumed for this purpose only that the aiding and abetting instruction was unwarranted, the giving of it does not necessitate the reversal of Alexander's conviction on the assault counts, however difficult a problem we might have if the jury had found Alexander guilty of second degree murder. The fact would seem to be that the evidence in this record is slight that Alexander aided or abetted the fatal shooting, but is, at the same time, very strong indeed that Alexander committed his own assault upon the members of the party. Any substantial motivation for the jury to compromise is missing. No. 23,783\n\nAppellant Murdock's claims of error on appeal are principally that (1) the evidence was inadequate to support his conviction of second degree murder, and (2) the trial court erred in refusing an instruction that the evidence of mental impairment adduced by the defense, although insufficient to require an acquittal under the insanity defense, may be regarded by the jury as sufficient to negate the element of malice.\n\nAs to the first of these matters, the court is unanimous in its view that the issue of malice was for the jury and that, on the evidence before it, a finding that malice existed is sustainable. The court is also unanimous in its view that the existing instructions in use in this circuit do not differentiate properly between provocation and heat of passion as a defense to second degree murder, on the one hand, and the essential elements of manslaughter, on the other. We think the discussion of this contained in Part 1 E of Judge Bazelon's opinion is helpful, and we join in the proposal of a revised instruction for use hereafter.\n\nWith respect to the second question of the instruction on diminished responsibility, the rejection of this instruction by the trial court was clearly within the terms of the law as it has been thus far conceived to be by this court. See Fisher v. United States, 328 U.S. 463, 66 S. Ct. 1318, 90 L. Ed. 1382 (1946); Stewart v. United States, 129 U.S.App.D.C. 303, 394 F.2d 778 (1968). If the law is to be changed so as to make evidence tendered in support of an insanity defense also relevant to the intent elements in the alleged crime itself independently of insanity, that must be done by the court sitting en banc.\n\nJudge Bazelon finds reversal to be compelled by the failure of the trial court to declare a mistrial, as distinct from merely striking the testimony of the psychologist, Dr. Blum. The basis for this position seems to be that whenever a St. Elizabeths staff witness, called by the defense, proves unable to give legally admissible testimony about a courtordered commitment to the hospital for examination, the defense is entitled to a mistrial. It presumably can have no other basis for the reason that, although Judge Bazelon looks with a not uncritical eye on the court's treatment of this witness, he nowhere concludes that the court erred in striking the testimony.\n\nSuch a conclusion could not, we believe, he reached by anyone reading the entire portion of the transcript covering Dr. Blum's appearance. That discloses that the trial court itself never terminated the opportunity of the defense to elicit competent testimony from Dr. Blum; and most, if not all, of the difficulty was due to a failure of communication, ending in evident mutual exasperation, between defense counsel and his witness, reflecting either an unawareness or a disregard of our admonitions about conclusory expert testimony in Washington v. United States, 129 U.S. App.D.C. 29, 390 F.2d 444 (1967). It may be that there are special problems in accommodating Washington to testimony by psychologists, as distinct from psychiatrists. But we made no such distinction in Washington, and the trial judge appears to have been adhering to the doctrine laid down by us in that case.\n\nThe declaration of a mistrial was not the only alternative consistent with fairness. Expert witnesses from St. Elizabeths or anywhere else must testify by reference to Washington, and counsel who call them as witnesses must see to it that they do. The mere fact that St. Elizabeths personnel are employed by the same Government which has provided for the examination commitment does not alter this fact, or mean that every trial must be aborted whenever such a witness falters in this respect. In any event, the prejudice was minimal. The jury in fact heard all of Dr. Blum's testimony and undoubtedly related to it the testimony of Dr. Pugh, the psychiatrist from St. Elizabeths called by the Government, that \" [A]s far as his personality is concerned, both by history and by psychological testing, [appellant] is a person who overreacts to the possibility of physical threat and is likely to defend himself against physical threats that are not as great as he sees them being. . . .\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nJudge Bazelon also finds reversal to be compelled by reason of a statement made to the jury by the court in the course of its instructions. The bare words used are not a faulty statement of the law. They remind the jury that the issue before them for decision is not one of the shortcomings of society generally, but rather that of appellant Murdock's criminal responsibility for the illegal acts of which he had earlier been found guilty; and, the court added in the next breath, that issue turns on \"whether [appellant] had an abnormal condition of the mind that affected his emotional and behavioral processes at the time of the offense.\" This last is, of course, an unexceptionable statement of what we have declared to be the law in this jurisdiction.\n\nIf the trial court had added another sentence to the effect that the jury, in resolving the question before it, was free to take into account all the evidence placed before it, we take it that there could be no question of reversal on this ground. Judge Bazelon attributes to the court's statement the effect of telling the jury to disregard any of the evidence heard by it which bore upon the conditions under which appellant's life had been lived. If the court had any such purpose, it seems odd that it initially permitted to come in all the evidence which was offered on this score. If the fact was that the court belatedly decided that the evidence should not have been received, it would have formally stricken that evidence and explicitly told the jury to disregard it. The court did not do that, although in another aspect of this appeal it acted to strike evidence already heard by the jury which the court thought was not legally appropriate for consideration by it.\n\nIn this context, the court's statement cannot be regarded as either being intended to do more, or as having the effect of doing more, than to focus the attention of the jury more precisely upon the exact legal formulation within which, and by reference to which, it was required to consider the evidence. We do not see how this can constitute reversible error, either in the abstract or in the more concrete terms of its possibly prejudicial effect upon the jury's deliberations. The jury was not aware of the reason why the judge had felt impelled to include this statement, nor did they know that it was a last-minute addition to the otherwise lengthy and complete instructions. That reason shows in the transcript of a colloquy with counsel outside the jury's hearing.\n\nAt this remove, and confronted only with a cold record, it is difficult to pass judgment on the merits of this reason. But we are not now under the necessity of deciding whether what was done was wise, but whether it was, in the context of this trial, of such a nature as to necessitate the overturning of the jury's verdict. We are not persuaded that it was."
