        "text": "Library of Virginia and VMFA Announce Winner of Annual Art in Literature Award\n\nThe Library of Virginia and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts are pleased to announce the winner of the annual Art in Literature: The Mary Lynn Kotz Award. This award recognizes an outstanding book in fiction or nonfiction that demonstrates the highest literary merit as a creative or scholarly work on the theme of visual artists or art. Categories include works of journalism, poetry, fiction, biography, and history, as well as museum exhibition catalogs.\n\nThis years finalists for the Art in Literature Award are: French Riviera and Its Artists: Art, Literature, Love, and Life on the Côte DAzur by John Baxter, María Izquierdo and Frida Kahlo: Challenging Visions in Modern Mexican Art by Nancy Defebach, Portraits at an Exhibition by Patrick Horrigan, Hold Still: A Memoir with Photographs by Sally Mann, and The Master of the Prado by Javier Sierra.\n\nThe judges selected Portraits at an Exhibition by Patrick Horrigan as this year's winner. The winner will be recognized on Friday, October 14, 2016, at VMFA and on Saturday, October 15, 2016, at the Library of Virginia's annual Virginia Literary Awards Gala.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBorn and raised in Reading, Pennsylvania, Patrick E. Horrigan received his BA from The Catholic University of America and his PhD from Columbia University. He is the author of the novel Portraits at an Exhibition (Lethe Press), about a young mans search for the meaning of life amid a gallery of old masters portraits, and Widescreen Dreams: Growing Up Gay at the Movies (University of Wisconsin Press), an analysis of several popular films from the 1960s and '70s. He has written artists' catalog essays for Thions Limi-Tate: Drawings of Life and Dreams (cueB Gallery, London) and Ernesto Pujols Loss of Faith (Galeria Ramis Barquet, New York). His essay The Inner Life of Ordinary People appears in Anthony Enns and Christopher R. Smits Screening Disability: Essays on Cinema and Disability (University Press of America). His one-act play, Messages for Gary: A Drama in Voicemail, composed entirely of answering machine messages received by the activist and socialist scholar Gary Lucek, was a critically acclaimed hit at the Third Annual New York International Fringe Festival. With his husband, the actor and writer Eduardo Leanez, he co-wrote the solo show You Are Confused! about the relationship between a gay Venezuelan boy and his charismatic mother. He and Leanez are the hosts of Actors with Accents, a recurring variety show in Manhattans East Village. Winner of the 2015 David Newton Award for Excellence in Teaching, he is an associate professor of English at the Brooklyn campus of Long Island University. He lives in Manhattan.\n\nAbout the Award\n\nArt in Literature: The Mary Lynn Kotz Award recognizes an outstanding book published in the previous year that is written primarily in response to a work (or works) of art while also showing the highest literary quality as a creative or scholarly work. This unique award, established in 2013, is named in honor of Mary Lynn Kotz, author of the award-winning biography Rauschenberg: A Life. The inaugural award recipient was The Innocence of Objects by Nobel Laureate Orhan Pamuk. The 2014 award winner was Carolyn Kreiter-Foronda for The Embrace: Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. Last year's winner was Susan Vreeland for her novel Lisette's List.\n\nThe Art in Literature Award is presented each year during the annual Virginia Literary Awards Celebration weekend, which will take place in Richmond, Virginia, on October 14 and 15, 2016. The events begin on Friday evening, October 14, with a program celebrating the Art in Literature Awardwinning author. The Friday program is held at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, with a talk given by the author about the writing of the book, and is followed by a book signing and reception.\n\nThe award itself will be presented on Saturday evening, October 15, at a gala reception and dinner held at the Library of Virginia. During the dinner program, in addition to honoring the Art in Literature winner, the Library will also present awards to the best work by a Virginia author in the genres of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry as well as a Literary Lifetime Achievement honoree. Nikki Giovanni will receive this year's Literary Lifetime Achievement Award, but the winners of the fiction, nonfiction, and poetry awards are kept secret until the awards evening on October 15.

The Library of Virginia is here to help.\n\nIn 2012 the Library of Virginia began working with 11 public libraries to loan scanners and computers to scan unique materials found in their collections. This pilot project was funded with a federal Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) grant. Although much of what was scanned was school yearbooks, the libraries didnt have a good way to make them available to the public.\n\nThe Library of Virginia recommended making Virginia yearbooks available through the Digitization Collaborative of Lyrasis, a nonprofit membership organization that works with libraries, archives, and museums. The Library is a partner in the collaborative, which provides professional and cost-effective digitization, as well as public access to materials through the Internet Archive. We have already digitized items in our rare book collection and helped the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries digitize their monthly magazine, Virginia Wildlife, so we knew it was an efficient, effective way to create digital collections.\n\nThe first yearbooks to be digitized and made available online are from the Pulaski County Public Library (https://archive.org/details/pulaskicountypl). Among those now being scanned are the Trucker yearbooks from Churchland High School in Portsmouth.\n\nOf special note is a significant yearbook collection located at the Orange County African American Historical Society. The Hawk was the yearbook of George Washington Carver Regional High School for African American students in Rapidan. The school opened in 1948, offering education beyond the seventh grade to African American students whose opportunities were severely limited by segregation. By the time the school closed in 1968, approximately 2,500 students had been educated there. The 17 yearbooks scanned from Carver Regional High School can be viewed here: https://archive.org/details/culpepercountylibrary.\n\nTwenty-one additional libraries are organizing their yearbook collections and prepping materials for digitization, all of which will be completed with federal LSTA funds. We expect even more libraries to get on board in the coming year. .\n\nBy the way, the girl from homeroom was Mary Sue Morrison.\n\nSubmitted by Jan Hathcock, Churchland High School Alum"
