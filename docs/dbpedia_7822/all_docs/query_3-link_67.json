        "text": "Alexander (Sandy) Gordon’s parents were Alexander Gordon (farm servant/ploughman) (1876-1955) and Christina Dunnet(t) (1889-1984) who were married in Wick, Caithness in Scotland on the 3rd of May 1912.\n\nThe 1921 census shows that Sandy was their fourth child of six (Robert was born in 1922) and named after his father (as well as his long-dead grandfather). They were all known by shortened names – Frank, Isa, Chris, Sandy, Bill and Bob.\n\nSandy was born on the 22nd November 1916 at Gelshfield in the parish of Bower, Caithness.\n\nThe family had moved to another farm (Hempriggs) in the parish of Wick by the time of the 1921 census. The family often moved on the end of May ‘Term Day’ but always within Caithness. He attended Wick South School before moving on to his secondary education in Wick High School.\n\nAt the time of Sandy’s death in 1941, his parents were living in Newton Row, near Wick.\n\nHis entire short adult working career was in RAF service. He enlisted on 5th September 1932 when his civil occupation is given as scholar.\n\nOn entry he was described as 5’8”, chest 29”, fair hair, hazel eyes, fair complexion, birth mark on back of neck. On extension he’d grown to 5’11” and put four inches on his chest measurement. His RAF service record outlines his development, progress and promotions:\n\n8.9.32 A/A [aircraft apprentice]\n\n31.12.34 A/A, VG character, trade\n\nA/A 23.8.35 WOM [wireless operator mechanic], promoted to AC1 [Aircraftsman First Class]\n\n31.12.36 LAC [Leading aircraftsman], VG character, trade WOM, proficiency Satisfactory\n\n31.12.37 LAC, VG character, WOM, proficiency SUPR [superior – recommended for promotion]\n\n6.10.38 Airman Pilot 15.9.38 Promoted to Corporal 19.7.39 WEM [Wireless & Electrical Mechanic]/pilot, promoted to Sergeant 1.4.41 Temporary Flight Sergeant\n\nIt also shows his service from his enlistment in 1932 to his death in 1941:\n\n1.8.32 1 Wing Halton (Apprentice training) 12.9.32 E & WS (No.1 Electrical and Wireless School, RAF Cranwell)\n\n23.8.35 SHQ Donibristle (Fife, Scotland)\n\n1.1.36 8 FTS (No. 8 Flying Training School, Montrose)\n\n1.9.36 800 (FF) Squadron HMS Courageous (FF-Fleet Fighter - Fleet Air Arm)\n\n6.10.38 No. 26 (T) Group (T = Training)\n\n14.12.38 No. 1 RAF Depot (NE) (Uxbridge)\n\n30.12.38 ME (ME = Middle East)\n\n13.1.39 4 FTS (4 Flying Training School – Abu Sueir, Egypt)\n\n30.8.39 Pilots pool, Abu Sueir\n\n12.11.39 102 (M) Unit (Maintenance unit at RAF Abu Sueir)\n\n9.1.40 84 Squadron, Iraq 24.9.40 84 Squadron (TJ)\n\nSandy’s final posting was a transfer to Squadron 84 (Iraq) on 9th January 1940. From there he contributed significantly to the war effort on at least three occasions in 1940 and 1941 (as described in his Distinguished Flying Medal citation below): at Tobruk in October 1940; Kuçovë in December 1940 and the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941.\n\nThomas Henry Wisdom provides further first-hand information about Sandy’s contribution during the Battle of Cape Matapan in his 1942 book ‘Wings over Olympus’, p. 173: 'Sergeant Gordon, one of the stalwarts of 84 Squadron, scored two direct hits on a cruiser with big bombs, and said: “Though they changed formation and zigzagged violently, and their A.A. was reasonably heavy, we were able to spend some time taking aim, and made a low-level attack. I saw one of my biggest bombs hit the largest ship amidships. Clouds of black and yellow smoke issued for a long time and ship stopped.”' [Wisdom was a sports journalist and racing driver in civilian life.]\n\nSandy was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM) in 1941 for these contributions. The award was reported in the London Gazette of 15th July of that year, by which time he had been reported missing: https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/35219/page/4065 (accessed 29 December 2023)\n\nThis slighter longer version of the citation in the London Gazette appears on a WW2 online forum as a quotation from Ian Tavender’s (2000) book ‘The Distinguished Flying Medal Register for the Second World War. Vol. I’: ‘Flight Sergeant Gordon is the pilot of a crew which has completed a total of 25 raids. On 25th October, 1940, while on a raid on Tobruk, he was attacked by fighters and one engine was put out of action. By good co-operation between gunner and pilot, they beat off the attack and subsequently force-landed in the desert. On 22nd December, 1940, Flight Sergeant Gordon's crew were in a formation of nine aircraft for the bombing of Kuçovë oil wells (Albania) when it was attacked by four G.50's. Two of our aircraft were shot down and five of the remaining seven badly damaged. Flight Sergeant Gordon's starboard engine was put out of action as they fought back until Sergeant Furney (Wireless Operator/Air Gunner) received a severe head wound. By this time, the aircraft was badly damaged and Flight Sergeant Gordon showed great skill in bringing his aircraft over 200 miles back to base. Before he was wounded, Sergeant Furney was shooting back fiercely and co-operating well with the other aircraft of the formation in concentrating cross-fire on the attacking aircraft. On 28th March, 1941, Flight Sergeant Gordon carried out a highly successful attack on the Italian fleet off Cape Matapan. In spite of intense anti-aircraft fire, Flight Sergeant Gordon dived to a height of 4,000 feet and scored two direct hits with his 2,500lb. bombs on a cruiser, thereby crippling it since it was seen to slow down with other vessels standing by it. In this way, Flight Sergeant Gordon was directly instrumental in bringing the Italian fleet into action. At all times Flight Sergeant Gordon and Sergeant Furney have shown great keeness in accomplishing their tasks.’ [Sergeant Furney was Irish and died with Sandy: https://ww2talk.com/index.php?threads/sergeant-george-furney-d-f-m-84-sqdn.15201/ (accessed 29 December 2023)]\n\nThe plane failed to return to RAF Habbaniyah, Iraq from a reconnaissance sortie on the 31st May 1941.\n\nThey had been shot down near Musaiyabby by a Vichy French MS.406. 'Its [RAF Habbaniyah’s] situation in the desert, 300 miles by air from our nearest bases on the Persian Gulf and 500 miles from our bases in Palestine, made it particularly vulnerable when in 1941, it was threatened with attack by Iraqi forces. There were no operational units on the station, but there was No. 4 Flying Training School and a number of trainer aircraft. Early in April work commenced on fitting guns and bomb racks to these aircraft, and by the end of the month some seventy had been made serviceable for operations. At the same time intensive training courses were instituted in bomb aiming and air gunnery. When the Iraqi forces besieged Habbaniya this improvised striking force was the backbone of constant air-raids on the enemy positions and, together with the nightly raids on their gun emplacements by the R.A.F. Levies defending the station, was mainly responsible for the withdrawl of the Iraqi forces from the plateau adjoining the airfield during the night of 5/6th May.' https://www.cwgc.org/visit-us/find-cemeteries-memorials/cemetery-details/2014801/habbaniya-war-cemetery/ (accessed 30 December 2023)\n\nSandy’s parents were informed of his death in a letter dated 21st June, 1941 after having earlier received a telegram (on 4th June) indicating that he was missing.\n\nIn the letter, his Commanding Officer expresses ‘what a serious loss to it [his squadron] his death is, and how deeply he will be missed here. His outstanding courage and skill gained for him the admiration of all with whom he came into contact, and played an essential part in establishing the reputation which the Squadron earned for sterling work in Greece, though his own quality as a pilot has been demonstrated on many occasions before that, especially when, in Libya, he brought back a damaged aircraft in circumstances of great difficulty, a feat which he later repeated in Greece. He enjoyed not only the admiration but also the affection of his colleagues, for his happy nature uncomplaining in the worst conditions, could not fail to endear him to them’.\n\nThe CO refers to Sandy as Alec, which was presumably how he was known in the RAF. Further evidence for this comes from a letter dated 22nd December 1943 from an RAF ‘pal’ from their Cranwell and Abu Sueir days who was looking for Alec, having lost touch as the pal had been a prisoner of war from July 1940 to September 1943. A further letter from the Air Commodore, Air Officer i/c Records dated 5th September 1941 informed his bereaved parents that Sandy’s body had been recovered and was buried at the Habbaniya Cemetery on 22nd August 1941.\n\nSandy’s death was reported in the local weekly newspaper (John o’Groat Journal) on the 1st August 1941: https://www.highlifehighland.com/caithness-archive-centre/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2016/04/Week-100-JOG-1-Aug-Posthumous-Award-to-WIck-Pilot.jpg (accessed 30 December 2023)\n\nIt was also reported in the local St. Andrews Parish Magazine, Pultneytown (Wick) in the September 1941 issue, p. 1: 'Much sympathy is felt with Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Gordon, Newton, who have heard that their son, Sergeant Alexander Gordon, R.A.F., some time ago reported missing, is now known to have been killed. They were informed at the same time that he had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal “for courage, determination and devotion to duty.” The Officer commanding his squadron writes: “The immediate occasion was the battle of Cape Matapan, in which a bomb dropped by your son’s aircraft scored a direct hit on an Italian cruiser, crippling it to such an extent that the remainder of the fleet were forced to slow down in order to protect it, so enabling the British fleet to overtake and join action. No one could have deserved it more thoroughly, and the squadron, which is proud of his achievements, grieves that he never knew of the award.”'\n\nThe wording at the bottom of the later grave stone at Habbaniya, chosen by his family, is AT THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN AND IN THE MORNING WE WILL REMEMBER HIM – a personal adaptation from lines in the well-known poem ‘For the Fallen’ by Laurence Binyon.\n\nAs a family memorial to Sandy, one of his nephews (born in 1948) was named after him. While his nieces and nephews had no direct contact with our Uncle Sandy, his appearance and character can be remembered both through photographs and descriptions that are left from letters and other written material about him.\n\nHe was a tall, handsome young man with a kind face who was clearly a career RAF service-man. He was skilled, brave and tenacious as well as a good colleague.\n\nSandy’s life from 1932 took him far away from his family and provided him with very life different experiences from the farm-work done by previous generations of the family in terms of skills development, travel and other aspects of RAF life.\n\nWith many thanks to my sister and brother (Pat and Sandy) and my cousins Gloria and Deborah (and her husband Paul) for information and photos."
