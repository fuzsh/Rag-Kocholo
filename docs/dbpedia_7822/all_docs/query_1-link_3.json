Apart from the date, Banks’ transcript appears to be accurate, though I haven’t checked every word. He also cites Alexander Gordon’s indenture, but I haven’t checked that yet.”\n\nand here is his indenture to Samuel Stratton, enrolled in the Middlesex Deeds.

MARY GORDON.\n\nWritten and Submitted by Mary Gordon:\n\nAlexander Gordon 1635-1697\n\nAs a young Scotchman, Alexander Gordon was a soldier in General Monk’s army. General Monk was defeated at the battle of Worcester, Sept 3, 1651 and his army captured. Alexander thus became a prisoner of war and with several thousand of his countrymen was held in a makeshift prison camp at Tuthill Fields, Westminster, London, near St. Margaret’s church.[Cha] There he spent the winter of 1651-52. The next season he was redeemed by Daniel Stone of Cambridge and deported to America under verbal agreement to John Cloyes to work his passage under Captain John Allen. According to the book Dudley and Allied Families, John Allen was a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts and Captain of the ship;”Liberty”[Dud]]. For a year or more he remained with John Cloyes, a boatswain, dwelling in Cambridge on the then road to Watertown. After a year of ill treatment and no pay, he appealed to the court of Massachusetts to be released from his contract and block his sale to Samuel Stratton. 15 Oct 1652. A second appeal was filed and granted in Feb 1653-4 (Mass Hist Soc. Proc. 61.25) His history unknown for 10 yrs. [Syb39]. Though this information says he was released from his contract, I have found another entry on some of the notesfrom passenger lists from the John and Sara that state an Alexander Gorthing was sold to Samuel Stratton of Watertown. Could this be a reference to the same Alexander Gordon? In the book New World Immigrants, the text does state they consider Alexander Gordon and Alexander Gorthing to be the same person. The spelling difference could be attributed to pronunciation, as I have seen the name spelled similarly in other documents. Following is an excerpt from the book New World Immigrants which goes into a bit more detail:“It is not to be supposed that those who engaged in this traffic, euphemistically hidden with the label of “apprenticeships,” should hesitate to drive their helpless servants to the point of ill treatment, although it is not believed that this was a general situation. However, on May 23, 1655, a number of them complained of this inevitable outgrowth of bondage and petitioned the General Court of Massachusetts for freedome, but their request was refused in the following terms: In answer to the petition of several Scotshmen [who desire to be freed from their masters, the Court, seeing] no proofe nor probabilitye appearing of what the petitioners affirme, the Court sees no cause to graunt theire request.Samuel Stratton of Watertown bought one of these Scotchmen and the documents in the case are here shown. It is, of course, an open question whether these men, unable to sign their names, could read the indentures by which they were bound and in this particular case it is clear that Alexander Gordon, the party of the second part,was a victim of ill treatment. His original indenture was as follows:This indenture witnesseth that I, Allexander Gorthing Scotchman, Latley being arrived the coasts of New England, do covenant agree and promise to Serve Goodman Stratton, Planter of Watertowne the full space of six years, wherein I do promise to do him true and faithfull service not to absent myself day or night out of his family during the time of Apprentiship aforesaid without his Licence or consent, that I will not entangle or engage myself in any way of Contracts of marriage during the aforesaid time, all his Lawfull demands and injunctions I do promise to fulfill to my uttermost power and abilities, all this I the aforesaid Allexander do likewise promise, bynd and ingage myself to serve my full time to some of his sonnes untill it be fully expired if providence should take away my present master by death, witness my handAllexander GorthingHis marke &amp; a seale.Mass.

Recorded 25:4: 1653 By me Tho Danforth RecorderThis may be regarded as a typical case of the less fortunate bondservants. It would seem that after he had finished his service with his first master, or possibly before he was redeemed through the benevolence of a resident of Cambridge, even in his freedom Stratton (perhaps a typo, I believe they are referring to Gordon here)became the victim of mistreatment at the hands of a subsequent employer. The following is a statement of his subsequent difficulties addressed to the County Court at Charlestown, as well as a confirmation of the story of his travels after the Battle of Worcester:To the honored the Deputy Governor with the rest of the magistrates assembled in the County Court now held at Charlestowne this 3d of the 11th mo. 1653.\n\nThe Petition of Alexander Gorden Scotchman.\n\nHumbly Showeth Whereas by the wise providence of the Almighty God your poare petitioner (with many others of his countrymen) was taken a prisoner in the late English wars with Scotland, and with many more prisoners brought into Tottell fields, where and frome whence your poare petitioner was redeemed by monies payd by Mr. Daniel Stone of Cambridge, who hath, as appears by his bill given under his hand, freely given your poare petitioner the same, and also whereas Jno Cloise of Watertowne at the same time moved your petitioner to go along with him by sea to this place without any agreement for time or wages, only his promise to be as a father in all love and kindness to your poare petitioner, and also whereas your poare petitioner obtained his passage by his labour without any charge to the said Cloise as Mr. Jno Allen the m[aste]r of the said Ship hath under his hand given, manifesting also his willingness your poare petitioner should have the benefit of the same, also whereas the said Jno. Cloise hath (after faythfull service for about a years space performed by your petitioner and hard usage by the wife of the said Cloise) now should your poare petitioner for seventeen pounds without any recompense or consideration of his promise made to your petitioner, or the petitioners labor in the ship or on shoare whereby your poare petitioner apprehendeth himself to be much wronged, yet being a poare exile and friendless hath been willing to suffer, your petitioner do therefore now humbly Comend the Consideration of the premises to this Honored Court having no other refuge; and your petitioner shall be ready to prove the perticulars above named, and doe Humbly intreate this Honored Court to vousafe the Consideration thereof that so far as justice and equity, according to the laws of God and this Cominwealth, will tend to the relief of your petitioner, your poare petitioner may receive some help therefrome, And your petitioner shall set down well payd with the determination of this Honored Court and shall continue humbly to pray etc. Alexander Gorden [Mic79]\n\nLittle is known of Alexander once this court case was settled until 10 years later when he shows in the town of Exeter, New Hampshire. According to the write up on John Sinclair, Alexander Gordon was purchased along with 6 of his countrymen by Nicholas Lissen to work in Saw Mills owned by Mr. Lissen on the Little River in Exeter, New Hampshire. According to the book New England Marriages Prior to 1700[Cla85] Alexander married Mary Lissen, daughter of Nicholas Lissen before October 1664. He lived the rest of his life in the town of Exeter. Following are excerpts from History of Exeter: Bell History of Exeter (Pg 58, 59)\n\nNumber and Names of Inhabitants\n\nThe population made a very gradual increase, as was to be expected, for there was little in the frontier settlement to attract new comers. It was those who were content to endure had work and hard fare, in the faith of securing better things in the future, who were the bone and sinew of Exeter. Yet there was a gain in numbers.On the twelfth of October, 1669, the General Court appointed John Gilman lieutenant of the military company, at the same time declaring that there were “about sixty soldiers in Exeter.” This, if the usual ratio holds good, would imply that there were about three hundred inhabitants of all classes. A fair proportion of the early settlers had passed their lives in the town, and were succeeded by their children. Others had come in, some for a temporary, others for a permanent residence. The new names that appear upon the town records between 1640 and 1680 will be given here, together with others derived from other sources. No complete list is to be found, onthe books of the town, or elsewhere, and it is probably that the fullest that can now be gathered is quite imperfect.\n\nNAMES FIRST ON THE TOWN BOOKS BETWEEN 1640 – 1680\n\nJohn Barber April 1, 1678\n\nJohn Bean January 21, 1660-1\n\nThomas Biggs September 5, 1643\n\nNathaniel Bolter May 6, 1645\n\nRobert Booth February 10, 1647-8\n\nRichard Bray October 10, 1664\n\nWilliam Bromfield December 1, 1664\n\nJohn Bursley September 5, 1643\n\nPhilip Cartee March 29, 1668\n\nPhillip Chesley January 21, 1664-5\n\nJohn Clark August 29, 1661\n\nJeremy Connor October 10, 1664\n\nThomas Cornish January 21, 1648-9\n\nChristian Dolloff March 30, 1668\n\nAbraham Drake June 10, 1644\n\nNathaniel Drake April 22, 1649\n\nTeague Drisco October 10, 1664\n\nRiley Dudley April 1, 1678\n\nSamuel Dudley May 13, 1673-4\n\nTheophilus Dudley December 1, 1664\n\nEleazor Elkins March 3, 1673-4\n\nEphraim Folsom April 1, 1678\n\nIsrael Folsom October 10, 1664\n\nJohn Folsom November 4, 1647\n\nJohn Folsom, Jr. September 28, 1668\n\nNathaniel Folsom October 10, 1664\n\nPeter Folsom March 30, 1670\n\nSamuel Folsom October 10, 1664\n\nJohn Garland August 26, 1650\n\nCharles Gilman September 28, 1668\n\nEdward Gilman, Sr. May 10, 1652\n\nEdward Gilman, Jr. November 4, 1647\n\nJohn Gilman January 12, 1648-9\n\nJohn Gilman, Jr. November 4, 1647\n\nMoses Gilman February 10, 1647-8\n\nCharles Glidden March 30, 1674\n\nJames Godfrey March 16, 1660-1\n\nAlexander Gordon October 10, 1664\n\nSamuel Greenfield May 19, 1664\n\nWilliam Hacket October 10, 1664\n\nJoseph Hall October 10, 1664\n\nSamuel Hall March 11, 1678-9\n\nRobert Hathersay (Hersey) August 5, 1644\n\nEdmond Johnson August 26, 1650\n\nThomas Jones August 5, 1644\n\nJoel Judkins April 2, 1675\n\nDuny (?)

He had a mill upon the Little river. His descendants occupied lands in the southwestern part of the town, and were generally farmers, except one or two who had the control of mills at King’s falls. One, of the later generation, George William Gordon, was appointed consul at Rio Janeiro, and was afterwards postmaster of Boston. Nathaniel Gordon, a present resident of the town, was a lawyer by profession, and has been president of the state SenateAppendix IIIBicentennial Address of Hon. Jeremiah SmithExcerpt pg 456Among the persons who united their fortunes to ours during the first century (for I must confine myself for obvious reasons chiefly to that period), and whose names are still “familiar to our ears as household words,” – the men who bore the heat and burden of the day, and to whom this day must be devoted; — among these men we find the names of Gilman, Folsom, Hilton, Colcord, Thing, Gordon, Magoon, Conner, Robinson, Pearson, Lawrence, King, Odiorne, Lamson, Tilton, Philbrick, Poor, Perryman, Emery and many others. The descendantsof these respectable men still dwell among us. Time would fail me even briefly to mention the good things our records abundantly testify concerning them; — how acceptably they filled the municipal and public offices conferred upon them. But I cannot deny myself the pleasure of a brief notice of two or three.\n\nHISTORY OF EXETER: PART II FAMILY REGISTER\n\nFROM THE EXETER RECORDS, Pg 21-22\n\nAlexander Gordon, said to be Scotch soldier of Charles II, taken prisoner by Parlimentarians, sent to America 1651, md. 1663 Mary Listen, dau.

Exeter 1697\n\nThe Alexander Gordon line is the earliest known Gordon family in the New World according to the House of Gordon DNA Project, and descends from Adam de Gordoun through Sir William Gordon 1265 Laird of Strathbogie (now Huntly). According to the site Sir William Gordon is the progenitor for the Southern or Lowland Gordons of Lochinvar and Kenmure.[TAG14]\n\nAlexander Gordon entered into a contractual agreement with John Cloise while still at Tothill Fields near London.\n\nPage 57 of Social and Economic Networks in Early Massachusetts: Atlantic Connections by Marsha L. Hamilton:\n\n“Non-Puritan servants also arrived in Massachusetts in the 1650s under individual contracts. ALEXANDER GORDON, for example, petitioned the Middlesex County court in 1653 to stop the sale of his labor by his master, John Cloise. Gordon had been captured during the Battle of Worcester in 1652 [1651] and sent to Tothill Field, near London, to await deportation. While there, he agreed to go to Massachusetts with Cloise “without any agreement for time or wages, only his promise to be as a father in all love and kindness” Gordon paid for his passage by working on the ship and then worked for Cloise for a year without pay, receiving only room and board. Cloise later sold him for seventeen pounds, prompting Gordon’s complaint.”"
