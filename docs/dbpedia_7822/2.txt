Alexandra Robert Gordon has been a Judge on the San Francisco Superior Court since 2018. Prior to her appointment, she served for nearly a decade as a Deputy Attorney General in the California Department of Justice. As a member of the Government Law Section, she represented California’s constitutional officers in state and federal trial and appellate courts. Judge Gordon handled many high-profile cases from the trial court to the United States Supreme Court, including challenges to California’s law prohibiting the possession of large-capacity magazines, banning possession of shark fin, and requiring the disclosure of major donor information by charitable organizations. She received a California Lawyer of the Year Award in 2014 for her work defending the constitutionality of a law that prohibits mental health professionals from engaging in treatments intended to change the sexual orientation of a minor. Before joining the Attorney General’s Office, Judge Gordon was a supervisor and staff attorney at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Since her appointment to the Superior Court, Judge Gordon has presided over the felony arraignment calendar, criminal trials, preliminary hearings, and criminal domestic violence court.
