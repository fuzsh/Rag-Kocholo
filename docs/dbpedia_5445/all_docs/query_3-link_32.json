        "text": "Choosing a baby name is one of the first (and most important) decisions parents can make, but they often forget that they can have more than one bite at that particular apple. Sure, all the spotlight (and stress) goes on the first name, but parents get to choose a middle name, too!\n\nAnd with middle names, the pressure's off. Kids can choose to use (or divulge) their middle names or not as they get older, so parents don't have to worry about \"screwing it up\" and living with baby name regret. They can think out of the box a little more. If they went with a time-honored first name, they can pick a trendy name for a middle. If they wanted a super-unique first name, the middle can be a popular name. Basically, the possibilities are endless."
