All her babies are pretty, but she insists that this one is going to be freakishly beautiful and needs a name that suits her. It sounds weird, but when she’s pregnant her predictions about her kids come true…while pregnant with her first, she said she had a dream about her first two kids, and she described, in detail, their looks, personalities, and names…5 years later, we’re ago still freaked out by the fact that her kids are 100% accurate to everything she described. So I’m trusting her gut on this one when she says she “just has a feeling” that this baby needs a stunning name.\n\nSo…what would you suggest? Everything I’ve thrown out to her seems “too common” or “too popular” or “not special enough”\n\nBefore they found out they were pregnant, she was dead-set on naming the next one [name_f]Scarlett[/name_f], but since she found out she’s pregnant she suddenly thinks its too high on the SSA list.\n\nSo…what would you suggest for a stunningly beautiful name?\n\nI think that my top ten girls names are beautiful\n\n[name_f]Lyra[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Annabel[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Juliette[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Thalia[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Rosalie[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Lucy[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Alice[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Verity[/name_f]\n\n[name_u]Evelyn[/name_u]\n\n[name_f]Imogen[/name_f]\n\nOther names I love are:\n\n[name_f]Primrose[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Scarlett[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Tabitha[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Olivia[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Ione[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Florence[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Coralie[/name_f]\n\n[name_u]Meredith[/name_u]\n\n[name_f]Elsa[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Ophelia[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Miranda[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Callista[/name_f]\n\nI also love my name: [name_f]Lily[/name_f] hope I helped. I also have a longer list somewhere so if you like these names but aren’t totally convinced I might have some of a similar style so if you want to message me I’ll try and find it.\n\nMy first thought was [name_f]Laetitia[/name_f] (This has many spelling variants, her pick).\n\nI dislike [name_f]Teah[/name_f], but love [name_f]Thea[/name_f]. What about [name_f]Althea[/name_f]? [name_f]Alethea[/name_f]? Amalthea?\n\n[name_f]Seraphina[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Serena[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Callista[/name_f]- meaning most beautiful.\n\n[name_f]Angelina[/name_f]- my own name, I’m biased.\n\n[name_f]Aurelia[/name_f]- meaning golden.\n\n[name_f]Octavia[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Odette[/name_f]- like the swan princess.\n\n[name_f]Violetta[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Narcissa[/name_f]- my GP. Not sure this is a good idea, but Cissa’s pretty anyway.\n\n[name_f]Bianca[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Amadea[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Amandine[/name_f]\n\nBlandina- I know one girl with this name. A pretty violin player.\n\n[name_f]Celeste[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Vincentia[/name_f]\n\nSilena\n\n[name_f]Esme[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Melisande[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Fiona[/name_f]\n\nWhats’ her other kids’ names, btw?\n\nI don’t necessarily feel that someone who is gorgeous(at least physically beautiful), whatever their name is, doesn’t really matter or have to “match” their looks.\n\nYour sister may want to wait until her daughter is born by settling on two or three favorite names beforehand, just in case she “looks” more like an [name_u]Ivory[/name_u] or [name_f]Teah[/name_f], or whatever name she chooses.\n\nHere are some ones that I personally think are gorgeous:\n\n[name_f]Alexandria[/name_f] or [name_u]Dominique[/name_u]\n\n[name_f]Ivana[/name_f] (ihv-AWN-ah)\n\n[name_f]Jessamyn[/name_f] or [name_f]Josefina[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Fiona[/name_f] or [name_f]Oriana[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Aura[/name_f] / [name_f]Ora[/name_f]\n\n[name_u]Genesis[/name_u] or [name_f]Giselle[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Gemma[/name_f] or [name_f]Evangelique[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Angelique[/name_f] or [name_f]Emerald[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Pearl[/name_f], [name_f]Helena[/name_f] (heh-[name_m]LAY[/name_m]-nah)\n\nGlorianne -glory+anne or Gloriana\n\n[name_f]Iris[/name_f], [name_f]Annabeth[/name_f], Annajoy, Annajoyce, or [name_f]Candace[/name_f]\n\nBefore I came to Nameberry, [name_f]Scarlett[/name_f] was on the top of my girl’s list too. My husband wasn’t too thrilled with it though when I suggested it the day we found out I was pregnant, and thus we started from scratch. I can’t tell you how happy I was to find this site and our perfect name for both a girl and a boy. Here are some of our left-overs that we thought were beautiful.\n\n[name_f]Giselle[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Juliette[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Seraphina[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Celina[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Marietta[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Colette[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Josephine[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Isabella[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Faustina[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Evangeline[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Marguerite[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Carolina[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Nicolette[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Rosalie[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Philomena[/name_f]\n\nPS I do like her choice of [name_f]Teah[/name_f] (prefer [name_f]Tia[/name_f]), I think it’s very pretty!\n\nEverything in my signature, haha,\n\nSome ideas:\n\n[name_u]Everly[/name_u] [name_f]Maeve[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Aria[/name_f] [name_f]Sophie[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Melia[/name_f] [name_u]Piper[/name_u] (really loving [name_f]Melia[/name_f] right now. I pronounce it Muh-lee-a, but others pronounce it like Meal-ee-a)\n\n[name_f]Cecilia[/name_f] (I know 2 incredibly beautiful girls with this name)\n\n[name_f]Celia[/name_f] (same as [name_f]Cecilia[/name_f], but only 1)\n\n[name_f]Fiona[/name_f] or [name_f]Flora[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Diana[/name_f]\n\nWhat are her older kids names? [name_m]Just[/name_m] so we can get an idea of what names she likes.\n\nAlso, with [name_f]Teah[/name_f], how about [name_f]Thea[/name_f] instead, but pronounced the same way? I know a girl with this name (spelling and pronunciation), and think it’s much nicer than [name_f]Teah[/name_f]. [name_u]Ivory[/name_u] is ok, but NMS.\n\nHere are some pretty names meaning some version of “beautiful” or “stunning”:\n\n[name_f]Alina[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Anwen[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Astrid[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Aoibh[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Aoife[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Bella[/name_f]/[name_f]Belle[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Bellerose[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Bonnie[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Calista[/name_f]/[name_f]Callista[/name_f]/[name_f]Calixta[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Calla[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Callie[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Ceridwen[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Elili[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Harika[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Jamila[/name_f]/[name_f]Jamilla[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Norabel[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Nomi[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Naava[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Rana[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Ramana[/name_f]\n\n[name_u]Teagan[/name_u]\n\n[name_f]Shaina[/name_f]/[name_f]Shayna[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Tove[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Zaina[/name_f]/[name_f]Zayna[/name_f]\n\n[name_u]Zuri[/name_u]\n\n[name_f]Jolie[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Nava[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Rosalind[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Aoibhe[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Indira[/name_f]\n\n[name_f]Sena[/name_f]\n\nHelen\n\nAphrodite\n\nVenus\n\nI did some research on names, so see what you think.
