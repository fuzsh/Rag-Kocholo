        "text": "For those who still enjoy a cable subscription, here is a selection of cable and network TV shows, movies and specials that broadcast this week, Aug. 5 to Aug. 11. Details and times are subject to change.\n\nMonday\n\nWWE MONDAY NIGHT RAW 8 p.m. on Syfy. This franchise first aired in 1993, making John Cena, Mark William Calaway as the Undertaker, and Dwayne Johnson as the Rock household names in the years that followed. The spandex-clad legacy continues from the CFG Bank Arena in Baltimore, where the Wyatt Sicks will take on Chad Gable and the Creed Brothers, and Sonya Deville will face Dakota Kai.\n\nTuesday\n\nBOMBSHELL (1933) 6 p.m. on TCM. Sick and tired of sleazy publicists, ambitious movie studio demands and endless fabricated scandals, Lola Burns (Jean Harlow) daydreams of a life outside of golden-era Hollywood, free of bright lights and lofty expectations. Will she get what she wants or will she be forced to stay in the pictures?\n\nWednesday\n\nHULK (2003) 7 p.m. on Syfy. In the early 2000s canon of comic book characters making their way onto the big screen — “Spider-Man” starring Tobey Maguire was released the year before, in 2002 — “Hulk” smashes in with bigger fights, bigger explosions and, well, everything is just bigger. After an experiment gone wrong, Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), a genetics researcher, is left with a side effect of mammoth proportions: Get him angry and he’ll transform into a raging green monster.\n\nPRETTY WOMAN (1990) 9 p.m. on HBO. Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts), a prostitute in the red-light district of Los Angeles, catches the attention of Edward Lewis (Richard Gere), a charming entrepreneur, and suddenly finds herself in a real-life fairy tale — with real-life consequences. One thing is certain: Missing this film would be a “big mistake. Big. Huge!”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
