        "text": "Are you familiar with the phrase, beauty is only skin deep? Don't tell Redditors that, as a recent opinion question was asked on the website, about where the most beautiful women in the US are from, and the top-15 is pretty interesting. Here's what Redditor's had to say about where to find the most beautiful women in the US.\n\nThe website Insider Monkey \"looked at ten Reddit threads that asked commenters to mention the US states with the most beautiful women. We only chose threads with more than 50 comments and studied more than 500 comments to shortlist the US states with the most recommendations by Reddit users. We then counted the number of upvotes on each comment and chose the top 25 states with the most upvotes.\"\n\nHere is the top-15 according to the upvotes on Reddit:\n\n15. Virginia (409 upvotes)\n\n14. North Carolina (432 upvotes)\n\n13. Utah (489 upvotes)\n\n12. Maryland (504 upvotes)\n\n11. Nebraska (519 upvotes)\n\n10. Arizona (532 upvotes)\n\n9. Washington (543 upvotes)\n\n8. Georgia (565 upvotes)\n\n7. Texas (587 upvotes)\n\n6. Colorado (593 upvotes)\n\n5. Minnesota (609 upvotes)\n\n4. New York (621 upvotes)*\n\n3. Hawaii (621 upvotes)*\n\n2. Florida (673 upvotes)\n\n1. California (991 upvotes)\n\nI suppose there is something to California being at number one, I don't recall anyone writing songs about 'Minnesota Girls' like they have about California Girls. But seeing Minnesota make the Top-5 was pretty cool to see.\n\nThere wasn't a reason for New York and Hawaii being in the order they are in, as both received the same number of upvotes on Reddit, did they give the advantage to the island state versus the state that has 'Long Island'?\n\nNot much Midwest love except for Minnesota and (Nebraska)**\n\nI think Minnesota could have been ranked higher than New York, but the top 3 are places that when you hear the name you automatically think of beaches, sunshine, and folks out at the beach in bathing suits.\n\nWhat do you think? Do Redditors know what they are talking about when it comes to beauty?\n\n** Some folks don't think Nebraska is in the Midwest."
