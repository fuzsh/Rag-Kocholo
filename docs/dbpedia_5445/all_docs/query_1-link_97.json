        "text": "Anyone can be a beautiful girl where there is an ugly guy around…\n\nWhen I tell you that I literally almost fell off my chair when I heard a girl talk about “the beautiful girl effect”, I really mean it! I was shocked at the fact that I’ve never heard it before because it is so prevalent in today’s dating scene and it related to quite a few of my personal situations, which is why I want to discuss it a bit further with all of you today.\n\nLet’s start with the most obvious question- “What’s the ‘beautiful girl effect’?”\n\n“The beautiful girl effect” is the term used to illustrate an imbalance present in romantic dynamics between an unattractive man and a stunning woman. Of course, attractiveness is relative, but generally speaking it is apparent when one party is more gifted in the looks department in comparison to the other one.\n\nIn this instance the beautiful girl is able to overlook the guy’s unattractiveness due to his other, more redeeming qualities (perhaps he’s really nice, charming or funny), which inflates the guy’s ego making him think he’s more attractive than he actually is, because he got a much more attractive girl to like him. The reason why men think this way is because they operate from a visual perspective, whereas women are more focused on other aspects, such as personality, touch, chemistry, etc.\n\nThe issue comes about when the relationship between these very apparent opposites starts progressing. This is typically when the guy realizes “the game” is over, meaning the girl is there to stay and he no longer needs to put on the nice or funny guy act in order to keep her.\n\nIn his mind, he got the beautiful girl because he is also attractive, much more attractive than he originally thought, which isn’t the case. The girl simply overlooked his appearance because of his other qualities. But, to him that makes no sense. That is why he will usually start acting like a complete jackass and eventually lose the woman he fought so hard to get.\n\nWhat should you do in this scenario, as the beautiful woman that you are?\n\nPer my experience, the best thing you can do is not to even entertain the idea of dating someone who is much less attractive than yourself. It sounds harsh and cruel and shallow. I know. But, listen to me when I say that it’s actually fair because you need to be physically attracted to them in order to have a relationship with them. Otherwise, they can only be your friend. That’s just the way it works.\n\nAnother thing, if we switch roles, and take the male POV- “Do you think a man would entertain an idea of dating a woman he’s not attracted to just because she’s nice or funny?” Highly unlikely. Men rarely give women they are not attracted to chances because that’s just not in their nature. As I mentioned before, men are visual creatures and as such they make decisions based on visual input. Therefore, you are also allowed to give them the taste of their own medicine in this regard.\n\nThose are two things you can do beforehand, but let’s say you’ve got yourself into a pickle with this kind of guy. What do you do in this instance?\n\nMy advice would be to first try to communicate your needs and see if there is a possibility of reasoning with him. You’d be surprised by the power a simple conversation can hold. Gently explain what may be bothering you. Don’t attack him or assume anything, but simply express your feelings and offer possible ways of fixing the issue.\n\nIf that fails, then just leave. Don’t bother changing his mind or trying to get him to treat you better, because he won’t. His mind is set and that’s the way it is. You cannot change him no matter what."
