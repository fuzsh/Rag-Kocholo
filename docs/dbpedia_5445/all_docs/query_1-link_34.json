        "text": "General Visitor Info\n\nThe park is surrounded by beautiful homesâ€”though none as eye-catching as the Painted Ladies. You'll notice that many homes built in the Queen Anne style have similar architectural features: balconies, porches, and incredible height.\n\nTake your time in admiring these homes, and be sure to snap plenty of photos. We think the best shots come when the sun is setting, casting a golden glow over the Painted Ladies.\n\nThere are other gorgeous corners of Alamo Square Park. Grassy, open lawns are perfect for a picnic, a ball game, or a run for your four-legged friend. Yep, there's a dog park in the northwest corner of the park. And don't forget about getting a cup of coffee from the Lady Falcon Coffee truck, serving coffee every day from the middle of the park.\n\nHow to Get There\n\nFrom most downtown and Union Square hotels, you can hop on the westbound #5 Muni bus and exit at McAllister and Pierce streets. From there, it's just a short walk to Alamo Square Park.\n\nTo reach the Painted Ladies from different points around the city, consult the Muni map.\n\nSurrounding Neighborhoods\n\nTo the east of Alamo Square Park, you'll find Hayes Valley, with its boutiques and excellent restaurants; the Fillmore, with its historic music venues, high-end retail, and terrific bars.\n\nJust one block west of the park is Divisadero Street, a major thoroughfare lined with shops, restaurants, bars, and nightclubs. Travel north on Divisadero to reach Pacific Heights and the Marina. Travel south to reach the Castro and Noe Valley."
