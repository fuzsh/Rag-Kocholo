        "text": "Whether you want to honor your family's heritage, take inspiration from around the world or try to find a unique baby girl name that's still flying under-the-radar, checking out these top hispanic girl names is a good place to start on your baby-name quest.\n\nThey pull from different sources of inspiration. Some are names that are already among the most popular names in the United States, and just so happen to be of Spanish or Latin origin. Others are hitting the top of the baby-name lists in Spanish-speaking countries like Spain and Mexico.\n\nFor those who don't want to follow the baby-name trends, there are some names that haven't hit any most-used lists at all, and are still lying low waiting for unique families to claim them. Try these on for size, and then next thing you know you'll be all set (and can start looking for a middle name to go with it).\n\nPopular Hispanic Girl Names\n\nSome parents look for a name that everyone knows and can spell, while others seek out names that are more unique and unusual. The first thing to do is know which names are the most common already.\n\nTo check the popularity of the name, it's best to visit the website of the Social Security Administration (SSA), which keeps track of the use of baby names in the United States and puts out a list of the most popular baby names for girls each year.\n\nThis year, these are the names that broke into the top 100 that are either Spanish or Latin in origin (listed from most popular to least popular):\n\nOlivia\n\nIsabella\n\nAva\n\nLuna\n\nCamila\n\nEmily/Emilia\n\nAurora\n\nNora\n\nNova\n\nVictoria\n\nStella\n\nElena\n\nValentina\n\nVivian\n\nLiliana\n\nFor an interesting comparison, the SSA also keeps a separate list of the most-popular names in Puerto Rico. They may not be of Spanish or Latin origin, but the top 10 names are Valentina, Aurora, Emma, Victoria, Catalina, Luna, Amaia, Gianna, Isabella and Alaia.\n\nOf those, Alaia is new to the top 10, having unseated Mia, and between Alaia and Amaia (also spelled Amaya) you can see a trend in names that start with A- and end in -aia. And last year, Aurora debuted on the list at No. 4, and this year has climbed to No. 2, showing the staying power of the nature-inspired name trend (see also: Luna and Nova).\n\nIf you're looking for something a little different, Noah and Dylan are on the list of most popular boys' names in Puerto Rico, which are also nice options for unisex names.\n\nTrendy Hispanic Girl Names\n\nIf you're in the baby-name search, you're probably already familiar with BabyCenter, which keeps track of baby names chosen by its users. But you might not know that BabyCenter also has a Spanish-language site, BabyCenter en Español, which, according to the site, is used by Hispanic parents in the United States and in 22 Spanish-speaking countries.\n\nIt also keeps track of interest in baby names. These were the most popular baby girl names on BabyCenter en Español in 2023 that don't already appear on the SSA most popular list for the United States or Puerto Rico, in order of popularity.\n\nSofía\n\nAntonella\n\nMartina\n\nLucía\n\nJulieta\n\nAitana\n\nAmelia\n\nLuciana\n\nSara/Sarah\n\nRenata\n\nAna/Hannah\n\nAlma\n\nSamantha\n\nValeria\n\nLia\n\nJulia\n\nXimena/Jimena\n\nAlana/Alanna\n\nPaula\n\nAlison/Allison\n\nMariana\n\nChloe\n\nAdhara\n\nDelfina\n\nAbigail\n\nRoma\n\nÁmbar\n\nAmanda\n\nBriana/Brianna\n\nDaniela\n\nRomina\n\nNatalia\n\nDana\n\nSamara\n\nBianca\n\nMaría José\n\nGabriela\n\nIvanna\n\nGuadalupe\n\nLara\n\nAbril\n\nJazmín/Jasmín\n\nJosefina\n\nElizabeth/Elisabet\n\nCeleste\n\nPaulina\n\nMiranda\n\nIn addition to Ámbar and Jazmín/Jasmín, Génesis, Gala, Ainara, Maya/Maia, Justina, Alfonsina, Madison and Amparo are new entries into the top 100, if you want to use that to gauge where the trends are headed. Adhara was one of the fastest climbers, leaping up 60 places in rank between last year and the year before, followed by Ana/Hanna, which jumped up 56 spots. Pilar, Francesca and Violeta are names bubbling under that are also making big gains.\n\nThe Most Popular Girl Names in Spain\n\nNameberry has found some names that are very popular in Spain, but haven't become as common in the United States as Isabella and Olivia. Here are some they suggest that haven't yet made it onto the SSA or BabyCenter lists, in order of popularity.\n\nMaria\n\nCarla\n\nCarmen\n\nVega\n\nLola\n\nAlba\n\nNoa\n\nClaudia\n\nVera\n\nAlejandra\n\nTriana\n\nManuela\n\nCandela\n\nLaia\n\nInes\n\nAdriana\n\nBlanca\n\nMarina\n\nCarlota\n\nMarta\n\nClara\n\nRocio\n\nAriadna\n\nIrene\n\nAlicia\n\nAmira\n\nCelia\n\nIndia\n\nOna\n\nThe Most Popular Girl Names in Mexico\n\nNames.org compiled a list of the most popular Mexican baby names, which also includes names of Aztec (Nahuatl) origin. While there are some repeats, there are some interesting additions as well, listed here from most popular to least popular.\n\nIsabella\n\nJuanita\n\nCarmen\n\nAngel\n\nLula\n\nLuna\n\nLiliana\n\nGuadalupe\n\nDaniela\n\nAlejandra\n\nJaime\n\nEsmeralda\n\nAlondra\n\nYesenia\n\nXimena\n\nMarisol\n\nKassandra\n\nCatalina\n\nLizbeth\n\nBlanca\n\nDanna\n\nMaritza\n\nNayeli\n\nNoemi\n\nSusana\n\nPerla\n\nEsperanza\n\nItzel\n\nDulce\n\nAraceli\n\nFernanda\n\nNames.org also notes that Xitlali, Katalia, Nailea, Ahtziri and Vianney rank among Mexican names with the most interest among the site's international users.\n\nRare Hispanic Girl Names\n\nThese haven't reached any of the top spots on the lists of trends, so if you're looking for a unique Hispanic name, these might be the way to go.\n\nAntonia\n\nAurelia\n\nCarolina\n\nDominga\n\nEstefanía\n\nEstrella\n\nGloria\n\nLeandra\n\nPaloma\n\nRamona\n\nReina\n\nRosalind\n\nSolana\n\nXiomara\n\nYolanda\n\nLooking for more great baby names?\n\nCheck out other Good Housekeeping lists:"
