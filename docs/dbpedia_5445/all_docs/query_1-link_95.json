        "text": "After I arrived in Santa Marta and Cartagena, I was bedazzled by all the gorgeous women and they were everywhere, all about the place. They were selling vegetables on the streets, tickets on the railway counter, running street salons and generally very well dressed and inherently vivacious. My camera just could not stop clicking and I probably took about two hundred pictures of the women alone. My Swiss companions were startled but they were forced to admit that the beauty standards here were much higher than their Scandinavian counterparts.\n\nThis is a matter of debate of course. As the days passed, I would walk down to the central square and pass the bustling markets. 70 percent of the vendors and hawkers were women. I would notice them bargaining with customers and engage in mild flirtations. The customers were quite taken by the potentially beauteous shop owner. Beauty standards are really high here. Though, after few days of observation I noticed that some women do adhere to unrealistic beauty standards.\n\nPlenty of beauty hacks were available right on the streets. Many girls had opened salons on the sidewalk itself where they cater to eye brow colouring, braiding, day makeup etc. Also noticed many teenage pregnant girls and moms. While I was walking down and taking pictures a young teenage mom carrying her child followed me asked me to buy some lollipops. I looked back and smiled realising she was actually begging. Later I felt bad and thought that it must be so difficult to rear a child by yourself. By contrast the women in Medellin were more modern and outgoing since Medellin is like a metropolis. There, I met artists and writers who were more than just their physical selves. But even in conversations with them they admitted that beauty standards in their country are way too high and sometimes quite unrealistic. It’s a complex society still undergoing many changes. Not being judgemental here. Just observing!\n\nFrequent searches leading to this page:-\n\ncolombian beauty standards, beauty standards in colombia, colombia beautiful woman, why are colombians so beautiful, where are the most beautiful woman in colombia"
