Compound nouns are of three main types: Open or spaced compound nouns, hyphenated compound nouns and closed or solid compound nouns.\n\nDefinition of a Compound Noun\n\nAccording to the Cambridge Dictionary, a compound noun is defined as ‘a noun that is made up of two or more different words, for example, “cake shop”, “French fries”, “high-flyer”, or “schoolteacher”.’ The Oxford Learners’ Dictionary provides a similar definition. It defines a compound noun as ‘a noun, an adjective or a verb made of two or more words or parts of words, written as one or more words, or joined by a hyphen. Travel agent, dark-haired and bathroom are all compound nouns.’\n\nTypes of Compound Nouns with Examples\n\nAs mentioned above, there are three main types of compound nouns.\n\nSpaced or Open Compound Noun\n\nA spaced or open compound noun is one in which there is a space between the two words which form the compound noun.\n\nFor example:\n\nCricket bat\n\nFast food\n\nFlower shop\n\nHyphenated Compound Nouns\n\nA hyphenated compound noun is one in which the two words are separated with the use of a hyphen.\n\nFor example:\n\nBy-product\n\nMother-in-law\n\nPasser-by\n\nClosed or Solid Compound Nouns\n\nA closed or solid compound noun is one in which the two words do not have any spaces or hyphens separating them. They are usually considered as a single word.\n\nFor example:\n\nSunflower\n\nClassroom\n\nRainfall\n\nForming Compound Nouns\n\nYou can form compound nouns by combining different parts of speech. All compound nouns, though belonging to different parts of speech, perform the same function as a noun.
