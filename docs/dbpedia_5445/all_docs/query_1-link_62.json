        "text": "There are many examples of beautiful women in the Bible. So much that we probably won’t touch on them all. There are those who were Queens, those that were wise, and those that were so physically gorgeous their husbands would even dare to lie. In our societies today, many don’t really know what true beauty is. Some think it has to do with having no cellulite, no stretch marks, and being strong and independent. However, we will be looking at beautiful women from the vantage point of Scripture. Join me as I dive into the many beautiful female Bible heroes found in God’s word.\n\nThis post contains affiliate links. See my full disclosure for more details.\n\nWhat Does the Bible Say About a Woman’s Beauty?\n\nA beautiful woman is one that has exchanged a self-focused life for one that is focused on God with the Holy Spirit’s help. This is exactly what Peter explains when he wrote that the beauty of the woman is found within.\n\n1 Peter 3:3-6 (ESV) “Do not let your adorning be external – the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear – but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God’s sight is very precious.”\n\nThis post contains affiliate links. See my full disclosure for more details.\n\nTimothy also addresses the inner beauty of a woman in the Bible. (1 Timothy 2:9-10)\n\nIn these verses, we see what is beautiful to God in the life of a believing woman of faith. God never looks on the outward appearance, he has and will always look at the beauty shown in our hearts.\n\nWomen are known for the way in which they carry themselves and men are usually attracted to them because of what they can see physically. However, that is not where a woman’s worth is found. Women shouldn’t take pride in the way they look on the outside. The beauty found within is of more value than anything else that can be seen by the naked eye.\n\nThe most beautiful woman in the Bible is not one person but many. It is women who fear the Lord, loves like Christ, are temperate, respectful, and kind. This is also true of you. You will be a beautiful woman in the sight of God and man if you fear the Lord and live to please him.\n\nWho Are Beautiful Women in the Bible?\n\nHere are the names of the women in the Bible we will look at:\n\nSarai\n\nHannah\n\nDorcus (Tabitha)\n\nEsther\n\nAbigail\n\nRuth\n\nPhoebe\n\nMary (the Mother of Jesus)\n\nMary Magdalene\n\nThere are strong women in the Bible known for physical beauty and inner beauty that sets them apart from others. The stories of women in the Bible are so outstanding because most don’t show physical strength but quiet humility and dependence on God. Women are important in the kingdom of God and can even win over an unsaved husband when living the way God advises. (1 Peter 3:1)\n\nOne of the first instances we see in the Bible about the physical beauty of women is found in the book of Genesis. When Adam was first introduced to Eve, she blew him away. Some believe the first thing he said was woe, man. This was what Adam was searching for that he never knew was missing. Eve was called a woman because of the way Adam expressed himself when he saw her. It is obvious that what he saw on the outside was so fascinating and suitably matched for him because of his reaction.\n\nAdam didn’t get to know Eve until after he saw her, he had no idea of her true nature but I’m sure it would be pretty important to him if she was anything like the women that Proverbs describes as quarrelsome and nagging. (Prov 21:19) Proverbs also tell us that outer beauty is of no value if the inner beauty lacks discretion. (Prov 11:22)\n\nThe book of Proverbs gives us many characteristics of beautiful women in the Bible, it tells us that finding a wife is a good thing and she is worth much more than precious jewels. (Prov 31:10; 18:22) She is someone that has gentle grace and this quality earns her respect from those around her. (Prov 11:16)\n\nLet’s look at some of the beautiful women in the Bible and what made their beauty shine. Each of these women listed below has displayed faithfulness and inner beauty. They were either kind, loving, wise, temperate, physically beautiful, or, but most importantly, completely sold out to God. This is not an exhaustive list but each woman displays the beauty that God wants us to exhibit.\n\nWho Are the Significant Females in the Bible\n\nHere is an overview of different powerful women in the Bible. As we study Bible verses about these women we quickly see that their strength and power was directly tied to their trust in God. This is what made these women beautiful in the eyes of God.\n\nSarai (Sarah)\n\nSarah, the wife of Abraham, was a woman of beauty. We find her story in the Old Testament book of Genesis. She was so beautiful that her husband made her promise to tell anyone that can bring them harm, she was his sister instead of his wife. On two occasions listed in Scripture, Sarah was taken to the powerful men of the city because of her beauty.\n\nAlthough Sarah was beautiful, she was listed in the hall of faith in the book of Hebrews because she remained faithful to God.\n\nHebrews 11:11- And by faith, even Sarah, who was past childbearing age, was enabled to bear children because she considered him faithful who had made the promise.\n\nSarah shows us that faithfulness is key to seeing God’s promises come to fruition. God granted his promise to her by giving her a son in her old age. She shows us the importance of waiting on God and truly trusting in what he says. Sarah was also a woman of prayer when Pharaoh wanted to touch her as a married woman, she prayed to God and he struck him with diseases so she could remain faithful to Abraham. (Gen 12:10-20)\n\nThrough Sarah’s faithfulness to God, she shared in the promises God gave to Abraham.\n\nAre you patiently waiting for God to answer your prayers? Are you being faithful to him as you wait?\n\nHannah\n\nHannah was one of two wives to her husband, Elkanah. She was devoted to the Lord God and content with her life except for not being able to bear children. She made a vow to the Lord to remember her. She was a woman of prayer and obedience. God answered her prayer and remembered her and she conceived.\n\nWhat stands out about Hannah is her faith commitment to God and the promise she made to him. She promised to give her firstborn child to the Lord as soon as he was weaned and she did. (1 Samuel 1)\n\nWhen you make a promise to God do you keep it? Are you a woman of your word?\n\nDorcus (Tabitha)\n\nDorcus was one of the disciples of Jesus Christ and some believed even part of his inner circle. She was a servant to those who were widowed and poor in her community and died suddenly. (Acts 9:36-43) The people in the community recognized the great loss that affected them because she was gone. She was known for being a seamstress, being kind, compassionate, and helpful. These are all qualities of a believing woman who loves God. The greatest commandment is to love your neighbor as you love yourself and this is what Tabitha did. Her love wasn’t just mentioned it was shown.\n\nAre you someone that loves others as Jesus does? How do you serve others?\n\nEsther\n\nQueen Esther was chosen by King Ahasuerus because of her physical beauty. (Esther 2:17) God knew the important task ahead to save the Jewish nation. When Queen Vashti refused to obey the King, Esther was chosen to rule alongside the King in her place. She prayed and fasted when the King was going to destroy the Jewish nation and trusted God for the outcome. Esther wasn’t just someone with outer beauty but she was filled with inner beauty because her loyalty was to God and his chosen people.\n\nAs a new queen, she walked up to the King without being summoned ( a crime punishable by death even though she was Queen) and trusted God for deliverance. “If I perish, I perish”, those were her words. (Esther 4:17)\n\nDo you trust God for the hard decisions you have to make? Do you care more about yourself or would you stand in the way of those who needed help? Do you fast and pray before making a decision? The book of Esther encourages us in these things.\n\nAbigail\n\nAbigail is known for her intelligence and beauty. Her husband, Nabal acted foolishly against David and almost caused his and his entire male household’s death. She quickly rushed to his aid and righted the wrong her husband committed, showing how beautiful she was not only on the outside but within. Abigail had good judgment and entreated David on behalf of God. She showed bravery, courage, and fast thinking. She eventually became David’s wife when her husband died. (1 Samuel 25)\n\nAre you brave and courageous? Do you honor your husband or father in the way you live? Have you asked God for wisdom and intelligence? These are beautiful traits that honor and please God.\n\nRuth\n\nRuth is a woman of inner beauty because she trusted in Naomi’s God for provision for them both. She could have returned to her family when her husband died but she chose to remain with her mother-in-law and trust God to provide for them. She chose to devote herself to God and the people of Israel. Her faithfulness to God and Naomi enabled her to marry Boaz, her kinsman-redeemer, and bear an heir to secure Naomi’s line. Ruth trusted in God and proved his faithfulness towards her. (Ruth 4:1-10)\n\nPheobe\n\nPheobe is found once in the New Testament but she is especially beautiful for the life in which she lived. She was a dedicated servant or deaconess of the church and a devoted servant of God. In the New Testament era, the deacon would care for the widows and help families in the community. Paul, himself recommended her. The Bible gives us the qualification for servant or deacon in the church then, so Pheobe must have been one who was not a double-tongue, gossiper, or busybody. She dedicated her life to serving the Lord. (Romans 16:1-2)\n\nHow can you assist those in your community?\n\nCharm is deceitful and beauty is vain but the woman that fears the Lord shall be praised. – Proverbs 31:10-31\n\nMary (the Mother of Jesus)\n\nMary, the mother of Jesus, stands as a symbol of grace and unwavering faith in the eyes of God. Mary’s willingness to embrace the profound responsibility of being the mother of the Messiah demonstrates her trust in God’s plan, even in the face of uncertainty. Her strength and resilience during moments of profound challenge, such as witnessing her son’s crucifixion, exemplify a beauty that emanates from inner fortitude and spiritual depth. Mary’s role in the biblical narrative portrays a woman of profound virtue and devotion to God, reflecting a beauty that extends beyond the superficial and inspires us to seek a similar connection with God.\n\nThis passage is an example of what a beautiful woman in the Bible embodied. It is an example of who you can be as a Christian woman if you are dedicated to the Word of God and living for Him. It isn’t a sin to have physical beauty but your inner beauty is of much worth to God. You can become a woman after God’s own heart if you balance both areas of beauty and put God first. Let’s draw strength and inspiritation from the examples of these Biblcal women. Their lives encourage us to keep trusting God in difficult times.\n\nRelated Posts and Resources:\n\nBible Studies for Women\n\nBible Study Printables\n\nCharacteristics of a Virtuous Women\n\nHow to Use the Inductive Bible Study Method\n\nMeet the Author:\n\nKeneesha is a wife, mom, wife, teacher, blogger, and Biblical Counselor.
