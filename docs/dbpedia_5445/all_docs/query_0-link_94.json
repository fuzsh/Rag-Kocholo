        "text": "Beauty is a subjective experience, yet some scientists have dared to quantify it using ancient Greek principles. Dr. Julian de Silva, a London-based cosmetic surgeon, has approached beauty with a mathematical formula known as the “Golden Ratio” or Phi, which is approximately 1.618. According to this theory, the closer the facial proportions are to this number, the nearer they approach ideal beauty.\n\nThe Science Behind the Beauty\n\nDr. de Silva employed advanced facial mapping technology to measure various facial features against the Golden Ratio. This method considers everything from the length and width of the face to more specific metrics like the distances between the eyes and from the nose to the chin. The closer these measurements are to the Golden Ratio, the more “perfect” the face is deemed to be.\n\nA Glance at the Top 10\n\nThese women, many of whom are familiar faces from Hollywood and the music industry, have been celebrated not just for their talents but now, for their scientifically assessed beauty.\n\n1. Bella Hadid tops the list with a 94.35% adherence to the Golden Ratio. Beyond her modeling accolades and fashion campaigns, Bella is also venturing into business with her wellness drink brand.\n\n2. Beyoncé follows closely with 92.44%. Her face nearly matches the ideal proportions, which might be one of the many reasons this music icon continues to captivate audiences worldwide.\n\n3. Amber Heard ranks third with a score of 91.85%. Known for both her acting and high-profile personal life, her facial symmetry places her among the aesthetic elite according to this measure.\n\n4. Ariana Grande, with 91.81%, is recognized not just for her vocal range but also for her facial symmetry. Beyond her entertainment career, Ariana is also known for her activism, from gender equality to gun control.\n\n5. Taylor Swift claims the fifth spot with 91.64%. This singer-songwriter has not only captivated listeners with her lyrics but also apparently meets the high standards of classical beauty proportions.\n\n6. Kate Moss, known as a groundbreaking model, ranks sixth with 91.05%. Despite not fitting the conventional model height, her facial proportions have made a significant mark.\n\n7. Scarlett Johansson is seventh with 90.91%. Her successful acting career is complemented by facial features that fit closely with the Golden Ratio.\n\n8. Natalie Portman, an actress renowned for both her intelligence and acting prowess, is eighth with 90.51%. Her roles often resonate with a grace that might just be partly explained by her near-perfect facial symmetry.\n\n9. Katy Perry, ninth with 90.08%, has been a pop sensation and a philanthropist. Her facial proportions and public engagements make her a favorite both on and off stage.\n\n10. Cara Delevingne rounds out the list with 89.99%. This model and actress is celebrated for her distinct style and outspoken personality, traits that complement her place in this unique ranking.\n\nBeauty and Controversy\n\nWhile the scientific approach to measuring beauty might add a new dimension to how we understand aesthetic appeal, it’s not without controversy. Critics argue that beauty is far too complex and culturally varied to be effectively captured by mathematical ratios. Moreover, the emphasis on facial symmetry and proportions may overlook the broader societal push towards recognizing and celebrating diverse forms of beauty.\n\nAs fascinating as it is to see science attempt to quantify beauty, it’s essential to remember that beauty’s true measure is far more nuanced than a number or a ratio could ever encapsulate. Whether in the gleam of the camera lights or the quieter moments away from the public eye, each of these women shines in unique and incomparable ways."
