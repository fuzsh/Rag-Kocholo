        "text": "The subtleties and depth of meaning of French names for girls are profound.\n\nTheir etymology goes back generations.\n\nClass. Elegance. Sophistication.\n\nThe French language carries some beautiful nuances with a rich history, making it a truly unique language.\n\nThis is what makes French names for girls so special.\n\nChoosing a French name for a girl can be a challenge, and that’s why I created this post.\n\nKeep reading to see my list of the best French names for girls.\n\nFacts about female names in French\n\nBefore I get started with my list, there are a few things to note about popular French names for girls.\n\nFirst, the etymology of many French girl names has religious origins (Catholicism).\n\nThis is due to the tradition of giving children names from the Roman Catholic calendar of saints and laws that remained until recently. After 1966 (when these laws were changed), parents were given more freedom to be flexible with their children’s names.\n\nFrom 1993 onward, all restrictions were lifted and to this day, French parents can give their children a name of their choice.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that French names for girls are also based on adjectives and other descriptive meanings.\n\nThe name Claire, for example, has connotations of the word ‘clear’ in English, and there are many other examples of names that are derived from descriptive meanings.\n\nI’ve included these in my list below.\n\nFinally, one interesting, fun fact about some French girl names is that they have been absorbed into the English language and their English forms sometimes have shortened versions.\n\nJaqueline, for example, can be shortened to ‘Jackie’ in English.\n\nWith that, let’s take a look at the top 100+ trendy French names for girls below.\n\nFrench names for girls listed alphabetically\n\nI’ve listed the French names for girls alphabetically from A to Z below.\n\nThere’s a good mix of popular/trending, uncommon, cute and meaningful names here.\n\nI also have provided the etymology/meaning of the name and how it should be pronounced.\n\nFrench names starting with A\n\nFrench names starting with B\n\nFrench names starting with C\n\nFrench names starting with D\n\nFrench names starting with E\n\nFrench names starting with F\n\nFrench names starting with G\n\nFrench names starting with H\n\nFrench names starting with I\n\nFrench names starting with J\n\nFrench names starting with L\n\nFrench names starting with M\n\nFrench names starting with N\n\nFrench names starting with O\n\nFrench names starting with P\n\nFrench names starting with R\n\nFrench names starting with S\n\nFrench names starting with V\n\nFrench names starting with Z\n\nThat’s the end of my list!\n\nWhich female French name will you choose?\n\nI know that naming a new-born is a challenging task. But I also realize that the name you choose will be special, because there are so many unique, beautiful French names for girls to choose from.\n\nDon’t forget, there are even many unique and uncommon variations of these popular French girl’s names.\n\nI hope these names have given you some inspiring ideas.\n\nYou might also like to check out this list of Arabic girl names as well.\n\nIf I’ve missed a unique, cute or popular French girl’s name, let me know.\n\nAdd it in the comments below!\n\n🎓 Cite article"
