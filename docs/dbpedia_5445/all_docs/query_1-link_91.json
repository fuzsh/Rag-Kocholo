A shorter first name is often a good choice if your child's last name is going to be long and multisyllabic: spoken or written together, the two names can balance each other well. Some parents also naturally prefer names with fewer letters in: quicker to read and recognise – and cheaper to put on the back of a football shirt! These names are undeniably short but still adorably sweet.\n\n86. Ana\n\nOrigin: Spanish\n\nMeaning: gracious\n\n87. Brisa\n\nOrigin: Spanish\n\nMeaning: breeze\n\n88.

These compound names can be made up of any Spanish names, so you can experiment with pairing any two girl names in this article if you'd like to give double-naming a go. We've also included below a small selection of the most popular Spanish double names for a girl to give you some ideas. Interestingly, though most double Spanish girl names will be made up of 2 girl names, the most popular compound name for girls in Spanish-speaking countries is actually Maria José, which is a girl's name (Maria), followed by a boy's name (José).\n\n96.

Above all, you want to be sure you're choosing a name both you and your daughter will really love. Here are our tips on picking the right girl's name for your baby daughter:\n\nThink about the impression it makes. Do you want the name to reflect tradition and honour your family history or be trendy, quirky or unusual?\n\nPractise saying it out loud. See if you can imagine using it on a daily basis. Test it out with your surname and any middle name choices too. Don't forget to check what your child’s initials would be.\n\nThink about nicknames. Would you mind people changing it or shortening it into a nickname or pet name? Or is it important to choose a name which cannot be shortened?\n\nConsider the meaning. Is it important that the meaning has real significance to you and your partner?\n\nThink about how other people will see it. Does it matter to you that it's easy to spell and pronounce? Will your or your child constantly be correcting people?\n\nCheck whether your favourite names appear on the most popular lists in the UK. If they do, this means you’re not alone in loving it, but it also means when you call your daughter’s name in the playground, several other children might turn round too.\n\nDon’t rush the decision. It’s fine to wait until you meet your baby to see whether your favourite name actually suits her. You could even test it out for a few hours before announcing it to the world and making it official.\n\nPic: Getty Images\n\nRead more:"
