        "text": "Picking your baby's name is both an honor and a joy. There are so many great choices—and strong female names are a great place to start. Having a strong women's name can inspire and encourage your child as they grow. Think about your own personal female role models to come up with strong female names that might be just right for your baby. Or do a deep dive researching potential new heroines to name your child after.\n\nTo get you going on your strong women's name hunt, consider our list of real and fictional strong female trailblazers. These women are known for their remarkable achievements, whether they be in history, film, or literature, and picking one of these names will create a powerful legacy for your baby.\n\nStrong Female Names Inspired by Historic Women\n\nNaming your baby in honor of one of the world's many strong female historical figures will give them a powerful link to the past—and motivation to reach for the stars.\n\nAmelia: Consider naming your daughter after Amelia Earhart, one of the most famous women adventurers. Although the name broke into the top 5 in 2021 making it a very popular choice, it's a nice alternative to chart-topping Emma.\n\nBeatrix: The name of the creator of the beloved Peter Rabbit series, Beatrix is a variation on Beatrice. It still hasn't cracked the top 1,000 names (though Beatrice is nearing the top 500), making it a great choice for parents who want a distinctive take on a strong classic name.\n\nClara: Born as Clarissa Harlowe Barton, the Civil War nurse and founder of the American Red Cross preferred to be called Clara. (Her nickname means \"bright and famous.\") Clara currently ranks just outside the top 100 but is still rare enough to stand out.\n\nCoco: Talk about a couture name—this nickname used by the fabled fashion icon Coco Chanel was also the pick of Courteney Cox and David Arquette for their daughter. It hasn't yet cracked the top 1,000, so odds are your child will stand out with this strong female name.\n\nElizabeth: England's legendary Elizabeth I and Elizabeth II were crowned with a strong, biblical name that's perfectly timeless. Elizabeth offers dozens of nickname options, from Eliza to Bess (as Elizabeth I was sometimes known), making it a versatile option.\n\nElla: Storied singer Ella Fitzgerald's name means \"bright light,\" indicating someone destined to be a star. The name has recently experienced a resurgence in popularity and currently ranks in the top 20.\n\nEmily: Beloved 19th-century poet Emily Dickinson has a name that's equally popular—Emily ranked in the top five girl names for over 15 years before dropping in the ranks in 2009 (though it was still in the top 50 as of 2021).\n\nFrida: The artistic contributions of brilliant Mexican artist Frida Kahlo weren't recognized until decades after her death—and the same can be said for her name, a German one that means \"peace.\" It didn't crack the top 1,000 until the 1990s and has yet to break into the top 500.\n\nGloria: Feminist and journalist Gloria Steinem has fronted the women's liberation movement since the 1960s, fighting for marriage and pay equality and reproductive rights. Her name, which means \"glory,\" has bounced just outside the top 500 for the last decade, making it ripe for a comeback.\n\nHarriet: Harriet Tubman, a formerly enslaved person who helped guide dozens of enslaved people to freedom through the Underground Railroad and later fought for women's suffrage, went by her mother's first name, which she took sometime in the 1940s. The name has cracked the top 1,000 just once since the 1970s.\n\nJane: The grande dame of 18th-century romance, Jane Austen has a name that's as classic as her novels—but even though it has seen a surge in popularity (it's currently in the 200s), it's likely your daughter will be the only Jane in their class.\n\nLaura: Memories of Laura Ingalls Wilder's life on the prairie gave readers a vivid description of how our nation grew. The name, which means \"laurel tree,\" reached its peak popularity when the TV series based on the author's books hit the small screen.\n\nLouisa: Her classic novel Little Women still remains popular, and Louisa May Alcott's name, which means \"fame,\" seems to be making a comeback.\n\nMargaret: This gem of a name means \"pearl,\" an appropriate choice for Margaret Mead, a brilliant cultural anthropologist. This strong traditional girl name, in the top 150 as of 2021, lends itself to tons of nicknames: Meg, Maggie, Margie, and Marge, to name a few.\n\nRosa: The first lady of the American civil rights movement, Rosa Parks, was given a pretty variation of the more common name Rose. It's a sweet but strong substitute for the more popular floral monikers, Lily and Violet.\n\nRuth: The \"notorious RGB\" aka Ruth Bader Ginsberg was one of the most popular Supreme Court justices, and her Biblical first name means \"friend.\" An old-fashioned pick, Ruth is now on the rise again and within the top 200 names.\n\nSandra: The nation's first female Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has a name truly worthy of her former post: Sandra means \"defending men.\" The name reached its peak around the time O'Connor was born.\n\nSusan: The first name of the most famous suffragist, Susan B. Anthony, reached its heyday in the 1960s; despite its beautiful meaning (\"lily\" in Hebrew) and its famous namesake, it's less common today.\n\nZora: Harlem Renaissance author Zora Neale Hurston (her claim to fame is the classic Their Eyes Were Watching God) had a relatively popular name back when she was born, but it's just reentering the top 1,000 now. Consider Zora, which means \"sunrise,\" in lieu of the top 50 Zoe.\n\nStrong Girl Names Inspired by Fearless Fictional Heroines\n\nBeing named after one of these fearless heroines will inspire your child, reminding them that they can achieve great things and surmount the impossible.\n\nAnne: The story of fictional teen Anne Shirley's life on Prince Edward Island has been beloved by generations of young readers—and the name, which means \"grace,\" is equally beloved.\n\nCarol: Captain Marvel's alter ego Carol Danvers wears a name that peaked in popularity during World War II. It's a feminization of Charles, which means \"free man.\"\n\nDiana: Wonder Woman's alter ego is Diana Prince, who was named after the Roman goddess of the moon. It's a top 250 baby name that means \"divine.\"\n\nDorothy: The girl who explored the Yellow Brick Road in Oz, otherwise known as Dorothy Gale, has a name that means \"loved by God.\" After a decline in popularity in the last half of the 20th century, it's currently back in vogue.\n\nElsa: The ultracool heroine of Frozen, Elsa of Arendel inspired plenty of parents when the movie came out. Elsa's another variation on the popular Elizabeth.\n\nHermione: Before J.K. Rowling picked Hermione Granger's name for her legendarily bright witch, it appeared in ancient mythology and in Shakespeare. Hermione is a variation on the Greek god Hermes, and means \"messenger.\"\n\nJosephine: Louisa May Alcott's alter ego in the Little Women series, the tomboy-ish Josephine March generally went by \"Jo.\" A timeless name that had a small dip in popularity in the late 1980s, it's currently in the top 100 names for girls.\n\nKatniss: The fictional Hunger Games heroine Katniss Everdeen is named for a real-life aquatic plant, making this a rare (but cool) botanical name pick.\n\nLeia: The rebellious princess-slash-general Leia Organa from the Star Wars series is solely responsible for the popularity of this name, which has gotten a huge bump in the past decade. The name, of Hindi origin, means \"law.\"\n\nLisa: The brainy Lisa Simpson of The Simpsons has a name that reached its peak in the 1960s and 70s. It's a shortened variation on Elizabeth and shares its meaning, \"consecrated by God.\"\n\nLuna: The quirky cool Luna Lovegood in Harry Potter's band of heroes has single-handedly resulted in a huge rise in this name's popularity. The name means \"moon.\"\n\nMatilda: The telekinetic title character from Roald Dahl's classic Matilda has inspired many modern parents to give their kids this name. It's one of the doubly strong female names—with a cool character and an apropos meaning, \"battle mighty,\" to recommend it.\n\nRey: The heroine of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, Rey sports a name that has historically been given to boys. It means \"king.\"\n\nSarah: The badass Sarah Connor who battled the Terminators has a Biblical name that means \"princess.\"\n\nScarlett: The ruthless and vivacious Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With the Wind has inspired plenty of baby names, breaking the top 20 in 2016.\n\nGirl Names That Mean Strong\n\nYou can't go wrong with these fierce women's names that literally mean strong!\n\nAdira: A pretty name of Hebrew origin, Adira means \"strong.\"\n\nAndrea: A variation of the popular boys' name Andrew, Andrea shares its meaning, \"strong and manly.\"\n\nAudrey: A top 100 favorite since the turn of the century, Audrey means \"noble strength.\"\n\nBernadette: This 1940s favorite is a feminization of Bernard—a German name that gets a little French flair from the -ette ending. It means \"brave as a bear.\"\n\nBridget: This Gaelic name and its numerous sisters—Brigitte, Birgit, and Brighid, to name a few—can mean strength or \"praised one.\"\n\nBriella: A feminization of Brian or a shortened version of Gabrielle, this top 350 baby name means \"God is my strength.\"\n\nCasey: An Irish unisex name, Casey means \"brave in battle.\" It's currently more popular for boys but makes a lovely pick for a girl baby as well.\n\nDrew: Another unisex name, Drew's a shortened version of Andrew and also means \"strong and manly.\"\n\nFernanda: A top 600 pick, Fernanda is a Spanish name that means \"bold voyager.\"\n\nGabriella/Gabrielle: This pair of variations on the boys' name Gabriel shares its meaning, \"God is my strength.\"\n\nGertrude: An old-fashioned name with a great nickname (Trudy) that's still waiting for its comeback, Gertrude means \"strength of a spear.\"\n\nKeren: A Hebrew name that means \"powerful,\" Keren's a nice variant on the still out-of-vogue Karen.\n\nMildred: You can get to the popular nickname Millie with this vintage English name, which means \"gentle strength.\"\n\nMillicent: Another path to \"Millie,\" Millicent is a German name that means \"strong in work.\"\n\nValentine/Valentina: A saintly name, Valentine and Valentina literally mean valiant.\n\nValerie: A top 200 name, Valerie is a French moniker that means \"valor.\"\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nTell us why!"
