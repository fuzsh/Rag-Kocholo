        "text": "By Maya Angelou\n\nPretty women wonder where my secret lies.\n\nI’m not cute or built to suit a fashion model’s size\n\nBut when I start to tell them,\n\nThey think I’m telling lies.\n\nI say,\n\nIt’s in the reach of my arms,\n\nThe span of my hips,\n\nThe stride of my step,\n\nThe curl of my lips.\n\nI’m a woman\n\nPhenomenally.\n\nPhenomenal woman,\n\nThat’s me.\n\nI walk into a room\n\nJust as cool as you please,\n\nAnd to a man,\n\nThe fellows stand or\n\nFall down on their knees.\n\nThen they swarm around me,\n\nA hive of honey bees.\n\nI say,\n\nIt’s the fire in my eyes,\n\nAnd the flash of my teeth,\n\nThe swing in my waist,\n\nAnd the joy in my feet.\n\nI’m a woman\n\nPhenomenally.\n\nPhenomenal woman,\n\nThat’s me.\n\nMen themselves have wondered\n\nWhat they see in me.\n\nThey try so much\n\nBut they can’t touch\n\nMy inner mystery.\n\nWhen I try to show them,\n\nThey say they still can’t see.\n\nI say,\n\nIt’s in the arch of my back,\n\nThe sun of my smile,\n\nThe ride of my breasts,\n\nThe grace of my style.\n\nI’m a woman\n\nPhenomenally.\n\nPhenomenal woman,\n\nThat’s me.\n\nNow you understand\n\nJust why my head’s not bowed.\n\nI don’t shout or jump about\n\nOr have to talk real loud.\n\nWhen you see me passing,\n\nIt ought to make you proud.\n\nI say,\n\nIt’s in the click of my heels,\n\nThe bend of my hair,\n\nthe palm of my hand,\n\nThe need for my care.\n\n’Cause I’m a woman\n\nPhenomenally.\n\nPhenomenal woman,\n\nThat’s me.\n\nMaya Angelou, “Phenomenal Woman” from And Still I Rise.
