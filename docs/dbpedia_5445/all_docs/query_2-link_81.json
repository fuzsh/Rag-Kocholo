        "text": "I’m so excited to kick off our new baby name series today! We had so many wonderful submissions and will work our way through as many as we can. We hope even if we don’t get to yours specifically, that you find some names you love through someone who perhaps had a similar ask or style to you!\n\nIf you’re wondering who the “we” is that I’m referencing, it’s myself and my closest friend Lauren! Baby naming is a topic we’ve had fun with for ourselves, family and friends and the baby name posts I’ve shared here on the blog have been some of my all-time most popular, so clearly we aren’t alone in this! The two of us will be the ones brainstorming the initial list of names we share here based on the submissions we receive…\n\nAnd then that’s where you all come in! After we share our suggestions, we’d love to hear YOU share any names you can think of that fit the description in the comments below! Let’s help some mamas out!! It’s going to be so fun.\n\nSo without further ado, let’s get to our first baby name topic from Annie M!!\n\nAnnie M has a daughter named Emerson Jane. She doesn’t know if she’s having a boy or girl, but has a boy name picked out already so she’s just looking for girl names for this little one! Here’s what Annie had to say:\n\nWe actually don’t know what we are having next month but we have a boy name we love. We are stuck on girl names!! We have no middle name picked out. I remember reading a book when I was pregnant with my first that described my name style as “last names first” and I think that’s probably very accurate because all the names in that category are names I like – but none I LOVE for a girl hence why I’m coming to you! ☺️ I’m the same as you, I don’t want a super popular or traditional name but I also don’t want to go overboard different/made up.\n\nReady for our suggestions!?\n\nLast Names as First Names\n\nThere are so many last names that make perfect first names for little ones. They are often strong and bold, but still familiar and easy to pronounce. They also provide some fun nickname options! Here are a few favorites:\n\nMonroe\n\nWindsor (Winnie)\n\nDraper\n\nJones\n\nHutton\n\nParker\n\nCampbell (Cammy)\n\nMiller\n\nDelaney\n\nBennett (Bennie)\n\nShort Middle Names To Pair With Surnames\n\nHere are some short middle names that would pair perfectly with last names used as first names:\n\nEve\n\nGrey/Gray/Grae\n\nKate\n\nEra\n\nNoa\n\nBee\n\nGreer\n\nMae\n\nMoore\n\nWren\n\nSample Name Pairings – Our Favorite Picks!\n\nHere are some of our favorite combos from the surnames we listed above!\n\nWindsor Grey\n\nJones Noa\n\nCampbell Mae\n\nParker Bee\n\nMiller Wren\n\nDraper Moore\n\nWhat are your favorite last names as first names?\n\nNow here’s where you come in! What are your favorite last names that could be used as first names? What did we miss!? Or, any faves that we included? Would love to hear ’em below!!\n\nCongratulations, Annie! Hope you find some names you love from this community!!\n\nMore Baby Name Ideas"
