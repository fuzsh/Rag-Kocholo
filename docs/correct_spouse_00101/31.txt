Here is the news about John Enos’s wife dying… she died in February…

It is with sadness that Soaps.com reports the passing of Jennie Lee Enos, wife of actor John Enos, who played the popular character, Bobby Marsino, on “The Young and the Restless” from 2003 - 2005. John’s Facebook wall filled with condolences from fans, friends, and loved ones after he posted that he’d lost the love of his life. Jennie, who married John in 2006, died on February 18 following a long illness. She is survived by a sister and her mother, as well as her husband and their beloved pet dogs, Duke and Bruno. A funeral service is planned for tomorrow

There was a thread somebody posted not long ago where I heard the same thing here.

Very sad they made a beautiful couple.

I send my condolences once again to John and both their families.

I think she was buried within a few days… I did not see a thing about her being buried at the present time.

I still don’t undestand why this was posted as current news… when it is very easy to find that she died in February.

Just google his name and you can find out the info…
