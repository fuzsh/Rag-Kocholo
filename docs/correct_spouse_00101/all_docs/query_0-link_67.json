        "text": "It’s official: Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage will be a Cooper family affair.\n\nAt the Television Critics Association’s annual summer press tour Saturday, executive producer Steve Molaro confirmed that Zoe Perry, Raegan Revord and Annie Potts will reprise their respective roles as Mary, Missy and Meemaw on the highly anticipated spinoff as guest stars.\n\n“Zoe and Annie are in the first episode, and Raegan will be in the second episode,” Molaro confirmed to TVLine.\n\nAs for Iain Armitage, who played the titular boy genius on the recently ended Big Bang Theory prequel, fellow EP Steve Holland noted, “Like we’ve always said, this is a world where this family exists and can be a part of this world. We love all these actors. Sheldon is in Pasadena going to school, but I think for a Christmas or a Thanksgiving [episode], we would love to have him stop by.\n\n“This is a world where these actors can keep coming and playing,” he reiterated. “We don’t want to make it a ‘guest star of the week’ thing, but they’re a part of this world.”\n\nAs previously reported, Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage will follow the eponymous couple (played by Montana Jordan and Emily Osment) as they “raise their young family in Texas while navigating the challenges of adulthood, parenting and marriage,” according to the official logline. Will Sasso and Rachel Bay Jones, who recurred on Young Sheldon as Mandy’s parents Jim and Audrey, are on board as series regulars.\n\nIn a previous interview with TVLine, Armitage said that he’d be “honored to” reprise Sheldon on the spinoff. “If I got a call to go back, that’d be so much fun,” he said. “I’m also just excited to get to sit back on my couch with some popcorn and watch their show because they’re so good. But I could totally see myself getting in the khakis again, putting on the old penny loafers and bow tie, and going back out on the job.”\n\nPotts, meanwhile, voiced her disdain with CBS and Warner Bros. for ending Young Sheldon after seven seasons, calling it a “stupid business move.”\n\nUnlike Young Sheldon, which pivoted to a single-camera format, Georgie & Mandy will revert to multi-cam and shoot in front of a live, studio audience — just like Big Bang Theory. The series premiere airs Thursday, Oct. 17 at 8/7c on CBS.\n\n(With reporting by Matt Webb Mitovich)"
