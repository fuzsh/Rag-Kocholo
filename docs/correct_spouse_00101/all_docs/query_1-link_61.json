        "text": "Mills Family\n\nJohn Mills (b. ca. 1660 England-possibly March 17, 1704 O.S. [March 28, 1705 N.S.])[1] Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) probably married before 1688 to Mary or Sarah Harrold (d. October 17, 1759 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). He came to America around 1682 according to Paul Mills in Mills Family History, but in another book, he and Louis E. Jones state that he came to Salem, New Jersey on the \"Henry and Ann\" in 1681[2]. Richard Harrold arrived with him and they supported themselves by cutting lumber with a whip saw they bought to Pennsylvania. When the saw wore out, they made hand saws with it that have been handed down to descendants.[3]\n\nThis was around the time William Penn received his grant for Pennsylvania (1681). In the same year, the Friends started meeting at the house of Thomas Fairman I Shackamaxon. They joined with the new settlers to Pennsylvania to establish the Philadelphia Monthly and Quarterly Meeting on January 9, 1682 O.S. [January 20, 1683 N.S.].[4]\n\nThe only early known records of the Mills at the Philadelphia Monthly Meetings are John deaths; the relocation certificate of Mary Mills from Fairfax, Virginia Monthly Meeting on June 20, 1752; and the death of Sarah Mills on October 17, 1759.\n\nHis burial is listed, as the same day as his death, in the \"Account of the deceased Buried in the Buring ground in Philadelphia.\" It is not proven for sure if any or all of these Mills are John Mills or close relatives.\n\nAn article about him was written by his great grandson, Jeremiah Mills (b. 1784 son of Amos Mills, son of Hur Mills, son of John Mills, son of this John Mills), and is as follows:\n\nMy great grandfather, I can not tell how many generations back, came from England and arrived in Philadelphia in the early day of that now populous city. There was another young man with him by the name of Harrold. On landing I suppose that they had nothing but their hands to depend on for a living, and lumber for building being in demand, these two young men bought what was called a \"whipsaw\" and went to work. How long they continued in this line of work I am not able to say, but until they wore the saw out. Then they broke it into and made them hand saws, one of which I can remember to have seen as a boy. It was the \"Mills Family Property.\" How long they stayed in Philadelphia I can't tell but the next account I have of them is in Virginia near Winchester on Opekan Creek.\"[5]\n\nChild of John Mills:\n\nJohn Mills (see below)\n\nJohn Mills (ca. 1688 Pennsylvania-November 24, 1760 Rowan County, North Carolina) married first in about 1708 to Rebecca ______ or Rachel Bates. He married second to Rebecca Harrold (or Stephen).\n\nHe was a member of the New Garden Monthly Meeting in Chester County, Pennsylvania; Monoquesy/Monocacy (or Cold Spring) Meeting in Prince George's County (became Frederick County in 1748), Maryland; and Hopewell (originally Opeckan) Monthly Meeting in Frederick County, Virginia (split from Orange County in 1738 and organized in 1743).[6]\n\nThe Monocacy Quaker settlement near Buckeystown, Maryland started by brothers Henry and Josiah Ballenger. They land Henry leased, \"Henry\", and later purchased was surveyed for John Radford on November 23, 1724 and Josiah had \"Josiah\" surveyed on November 4, 1725. Both were northeast of present day Buckeystown. Other early Quaker settlers were Isaac Lehnert, Baltis Fout, Christian Kemp, Meredith Davis, Joseph Wells, and Thomas Matthews.[7]\n\nThe first record of the Mills in the area was when Thomas Mills got married to Elizabeth Harrold per the New Garden Monthly Meeting minutes in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Thomas, son of John, is listed as being from the Monocacy and Potomac River at the time of the marriage on June 18, 1730. Witnessed included Reuben Mills, Henry Mills, Mary Mills, John Mills, Rebeckah Mills, John Mills Junr. and Hur Mills. The June 3, 1731 Nottingham Monthly Meeting records lists John Mills, Thos: Mills, Hur Mills, Reuben Mills, and Eliz: Mills as some of the witnesses to the marriage of George Mathews and Elizabeth Wright. Both marriages occurred at Josiah Ballinger's home at Monoquisy. The Rebeckah Mills may be John Mill's first wife. The relationship between Reuben Mills and the other Mills is not known.\n\nHe was one of the seventy founding families that had joined Hopewell Monthly Meeting by 1732.[8] In 1735, he received a land patent for 1315 acres in Virginia, which is now Berkeley County, West Virginia. (see Mills Virginia Land Records) Between 1742 and 1744, he sold the land to his sons Thomas (307 1/2 acres), Henry (207 1/2 acres), and Hur (250 acres) as well as Jonathan Harrold (150 acres), William Chenoworth (100 acres), and John Hayes (200 acres).[9] His other adult son at the time, John, received his own land patent around the same time as his father. In the deeds, John Mills Sr. was listed as living in Prince George's County, Maryland. His second wife, Rebecca, was also listed on most of the release deeds. Although he was listed as a resident of Prince George's County, no Maryland land transactions have been found for John Mills. (see Mills Maryland Land Records)\n\nThomas Mills sold 130 acres of his land to John Thomson in 1745, and in return John Thomson sold it back to John Mills, Sr. in 1749. Jonathan Harrold, Thomas's brother-in-law, sold his land back to John Mills, Sr. in 1750. John Mills, Sr. sold both tracts to Jacob Rees in 1753. His sons Thomas, Henry, and Hur sold their lands to other members of the Rees family. John Mills, Jr. sold the remainder of his lands to William Baldwin in 1752. (see Mills Virginia Land Records)\n\nJohn Mills, Jr was received in Cane Creek Monthly Meeting on October 1, 1752 in Orange County (now Alamance), North Carolina (certificate was from Hopewell Monthly Meeting, Opeckan and dated August 1, 1752). John Mills, Sr, Thomas, Hurr, and Henry were received on September 1, 1753 (certificate was dated May 7, 1753).[10]\n\nHe and his second family moved to Cane Creek Monthly Meeting, North Carolina in 1752.[11] [12] [13]\n\nThe land grant office in Raleigh has two grants for John Mills, Sr in Rowan County.[14] The first one (Grant #124) was for 500 acres on Wolf Run granted in 1754.[15] I haven't been able to find a copy of the grant, but it might be the same land patent recorded for his widow in 1762. The second grant (Grant #114) was from 1759. It could take several years from the time an application was submitted for land, a warrant (authorization for surveyor) was issued, a survey was taken, and grant document was produced. (see Mills North Carolina Land Records)\n\nThe New Garden settlement, where the Mills located, started around 1750 and in 1751 a meeting for worship was granted by Cane Creek with monthly meetings circulating between Cane Creek and New Garden before New Garden Monthly Meeting was established. The Friends in the area wanted to start the New Garden Monthly Meeting in Rowan County (now Guilford County) because of the difficulty in attending the Cane Creek Monthly Meeting. They requested the privilege of holding a Monthly Meeting during the Perquimans and Little River Quarterly meeting on May 25, 1754. Among the original members were John Mills, Henry Mills, and Thomas Mills.[16]\n\nJohn Mills' will was signed on September 28, 1759 and probated in July 1761 term of Rowen County Court. He left 1 shilling a piece to his children from his first wife: Thomas, John, Henry, Hur Mills, and Mary Beeson. He left the rest of his estate to his wife Rebeckah to take care of their children, not named. They are named on the New Garden Monthly Meeting records. (see Mills North Carolina Probate Records)\n\nIt is not sure what happened to Rebeckah. She did receive a grant for 500 acres in Rowan County in 1762, which she sold to Jesse Johnson in the same year. (see Mills North Carolina Land Records) In Jeremiah Mills' narrative, he states that she moved to Montgomery County, North Carolina. (Maybe Montgomery County, Ohio.) She may have also followed members of the Mills family to South Carolina. There is a Rebekah Mills who is mentioned in Newberry County land records. Also, a Rebekah Mills estate was probated in April 1806. (see Mills South Carolina Probate Records)\n\nJeremiah Mills' narrative states the following about John Mills:\n\n\"How long they stayed in Philadelphia I can't tell but the next account I have of them is in Virginia near Winchester on Opekan Creek.\n\nThere my father-Amos Mills-son of Hur (Herr) Mills was born in 1752. About this time the Indian troubles came up, what was called \"Bradcocks War.\" Our people being Quakers became alarmed and left for North Carolina.\n\nMy great grandfather and all of his sons and daughters settled in Guilford County on the waters of the Deep River. The Beesons, the Beals, the Venights all came out about the same time and I think from about the same place in Virginia, the most of which settled on the waters of the Deep River, although some settled on branches of the Haw River and others on a creek call \"Polecat.\"\n\n...My great-grand father's name was John. He married twice. I think his first wife had five sons and no more, but I can't tell which was the oldest, but know their names. Here they are: John, Thomas, Hurr, Henry, and William, and by his last wife he had George and Jonathan. About his daughters I can't say how many nor from which wife, two are all I remember to heard of. One married William Beeson and the other Henry Humphries, he and six others were hung on a post oak limb near Hillsborough at the Regulation battle in 1760.\"\n\nChildren of John and Rachel (Bates) Mills:\n\nThomas Mills (1709 Chester County, Pennsylvania-September 10, 1793 Guilford County, North Carolina[17]) married Elizabeth Harrold (March 10, 1711-September 9, 1771) at June 18, 1730 in Prince George's County, Maryland. Hopewell Monthly Meeting, Frederick, County, Virginia (recorded in New Garden Monthly Meeting in Chester County, Pennsylvania.) She was the daughter of Richard and Mary Beals Harrold. Richard migrated from London to America on the Henry and Ann in 1681. Thomas and Elizabeth lived in Rowan County, North Carolina and attended New Garden and Deep River Monthly Meetings.\n\nJeremiah Mills' narrative states the following about Thomas Mills' family:\n\nNow we are through with John's family. We will begin with Thomas and see what we can say for his family. He married a Harrold sister to my grandfather. They had three sons. Richard, Reuben & Thomas. Richard had a large family. I can not say how many, but will name some I have seen and others I have heard of: Asa, William and Hur I have seen and if I am not mistaken have heard of others. They want to Tennesse before my remembrance. Reuben stayed on Deep River in 1807. He moved to Belmont County, Ohio. He was blind some years before he died. Thomas died of Consumption on the Pengbranch. He had but four children to live and have families. His wife was Jeminah Jones. Daniel Mills, their son married a woman named Carr. Richard married an Osburn, Elizabeth married Solomon Hodgson and Sarah marries one-eyed John Hodgson.\"\n\nMary (December 4, 1731-September 10, 1793) married on August 31, 1754 to John Hodgson (March 11, 1738-April 2, 1813) at New Garden Monthly Meeting.\n\nRebeckah (b.

The April 30, 1763 New Garden Monthly Meeting minutes state,\n\n\"Deep River preparative meeting informs us that William Mills haith Contrary to the known Rules of our Christian Disciplines Accomplished his Sister in Accomplishing her marriage Before a Justis and has been Frequently in the practice of going to Shooting matches there Shooting for prises and other Disorders which Being Contrary to truth we therefore appoint Bouter Bach and John Hiatt to Visit him and indeavour to Bring him to Light of his Disorderly beheavour that he may Chair the truth which Suffers Reproach thereby and Report their Care to our Next Meeting~\"\n\nHistorical Marker for Bush River Monthly Meeting, near Newberry, South Carolina\n\nAt the same meeting\n\n\"It Appears that Rebeckah Mills haith Joyned in marrage with one not of our Society Anthony Hoggat is Appointed to Assist our Womans friends in Prepaorong a testification against her and Produce it to our Next Meeting for Approbation~\"\n\nThe May 28, 1763 minutes state,\n\n\"William Hiatt and and Thomas Thornbrouh is appointed to prepare a Testification against William Mills and Produce to Our Next Meeting for Approbation~\n\nthe friend appointed to assist our women Friends in prepairing a Testification against Rebeckah Umpriss make Report he had So Done which was approved of and Signed by Henry thornbrouh is appointed to Read it at the Close of a first Day meeting at Deepriver & make his Report of his Care to our Next meeting~\"\n\nThe June 25, 1763 minutes state,\n\n\"One of the Friends appointed Last meeting meeting to prepar a Testification against William Mills Produced one to this meeting which was approved of and Signed the other Friend not appearing and Henry thornbrough is appointed to Read it at Close of a first Day meeting at Deepriver and Report his Care to our Next Meeting~\"\n\nThe July 30, 1763 (dated 1764) minutes state,\n\n\"the Friend appointed Last meeting to Read the the testification against William Mills Report he has so Done~\"\n\nThe next stage of William's life (and death) can be found in Jeremiah Mills' narrative, he mentions his great uncle William.\n\n\"Well, I know nothing about father's Uncle William. He and some others went to South Carlina in early times. My father considered him the most active man he every saw. He was killed in attempting to take a run-away Negro. He appeared to give up, but while he was getting a rope to tie him the negro wheeled and stabbed him. I saw a man by the name of Right who said that he was his grandfather. That he had heard his mother relate the story about her father being killed by that Negro, and that William Mills was his grandfather's name.\n\nAs to the other uncles. I know very little about them after my great-grandfather died, their mother left Deep River and went to Montgomery County, North Carolina and there stayed. I never saw George or Jonathan, but once Ezekiah Mills who lives between Pendelton and Greenfield, is George's son, and there some more in Indiana if living.\"[24]\n\nIn 1767, a William Mills received a grant for 300 acres on Youngs Fork, a branch of Bush River, in South Carolina. The 50 acres of the land was sold by John, his wife, Mary, and his mother, Rebeccah to Joseph Scott in 1774 after William had died. Another 100 acres was sold by John and Mary Mills to Isaac Mills, also in 1774. In 1785, the remaining 150 acres was sold by John and Mary Mills to Thomas Mills. (see Mills South Carolina Land Patent Records)\n\nThe earliest known Quaker in the area was Samuel Kelly who moved from Camden, South Carolina in 1762. By 1770, the Western Quarterly Meeting appointed a committee that looked into establishing a monthly meeting at Bush River. It was approved in November 1770, but the first meeting was not until April 1772.[25] [26]\n\nOn September 29, 1774, \"John Mills & Mary his Wife & Rebeccah Mills his Mother of Berkeley County South Carolina Ninety Six District\" sold the 300 acres granted to William Mills, deceased, to Joseph Scott. (see Mills South Carolina Land Records)\n\nThere is much confusion on William's family. For instance, in George Leland Summer's Newberry County, South Carolina: Historical and Genealogical Annals, William Mills wife is given as Rebeckah and sons John, Isaac, William, and Thomas. Much of this is probably in reference to the selling of William Mills' land after his death. The only relationships actually mentioned in those deeds are John and Mary being spouses and Rebeckah being John's mother. Since John was married by 1774, it would be very unlikely for him to be the son of William, who was born in 1742. Likewise, if Isaac was William's son, he probably would have been too young to buy land in 1774. William is listed as a son probably because the elder William Mills is referenced as William Mills, Sr. in several of the deeds.\n\nIsaac Mills, and his wife Sarah, sold his land to Robert Brown on August 27, 1802. Thomas Mills, and his wife Jean, sold his land to Henry Boozer on July 14, 1803. (see Mills South Carolina Land Records)\n\nIn Paul Mills' Mills Family History, he lists the same family members for William Mills and Robert Mills, Elizabeth Mills (who married a Gauntt), and Charity Mills (who married a Downes). Robert Mills died in 1791 with at least 2 children old enough to be involved in a land transaction between them in 1793. Most likely, Robert was too old to be a son of William. Wlliam, Thomas, and Robert were all granted lands near one another and were probably more contemporaries. (see Mills South Carolina Land Patent Records)\n\nSome researchers have speculated that Rebeccah Mills was William Mills widow and John Mills was his son. The deed does not specify William Mills relation to either Rebeccah or John Mills. Since this William Mills is most likely the one born in 1742, he would have been too young to have a married son. More likely, Rebeccah Mills was William's widowed mother. However, Rebeccah's stepson, John Mills married Sarah Beals, who died in 1800. Also, all indications are that John and Sarah Beals stayed in Rowan/Guilford County.\n\nThere is a William Mills mentioned in the Orange County, North Carolina Court Minutes. During a April 7, 1755 meeting of the Commissioners for Roads, Joseph Pinson & William Mills, Sr. were appointed overseears of the road under the inspection of John Pittman. During the February 1761 term of the Orange County Inferior Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions, it was ordered \"that Solomon West, Hezekiah Collins, John West Junr., Solomon Jones, William Mills, John Mills, Robert Mills, Robert Jones, John Odaniel, William Odaniel, Thomas Lynch, Francis Wilkinson & Edward Bailey, John Boid and THomas Lapsey, Michael Boyd, Jacob Bailey & Daniel Sullivant with there Taxable mark upon the road laid out by order of this Court from James Contrils to Taylors Road- Also that the Inhabitants in the following Districts work on the said road to wit from Dolittles on the County line Creek to Lewis Odean's on Hogins's Creek, thence to the head of the County Line-\"\n\nIn the August 1761 term, it was ordered \"that William Mills, Senr. be appointed Overseer of the road from James Allison, Esqr. to Hendersons Creek, John Roberson from thence to John Boyds and George Adams from thence to the end.-\"\n\nIn the February 1764 term, it was ordered \"that a Road known by the name of Harman Husbands leading from Bear Creek to Cumberland line be cleared and kept in repair to Cross deep River, at William Thompson's and that William Thompson be Overseer of the said Road from Cumberland line to Bear Creek with the hands on the South side of the Said Creek from John Mills's and from Harman Husbands plantation on the North said of the said Creek and also the hadns on the South Side of the said Creek to Cumber line ~ Also Robert Walkins in Appointed Overseer of the said Road from Bear Creek to Low Creek with the most convenient hands.

(see Mills South Carolina Land Patent Records) In 1793, Robert Mills, Jr. sold William Mills his 100 acres left to him by his father who died intestate. The land was original 200 acres patented to Thomas Hopkins in 1770.

She married second William Arnold on October 9, 1837 in Warren County, Ohio.\n\nThe November 1794 Men's Minutes for Bush River Monthly Minute states \"James Mills, having been under the care and notice of Friends for a considerable time past, now requests to be received into Membership, and nothing appearing to obstruct this Meeting grants his request, and received him as such. He having likewise made request for his children namely William, John, Isaac, Jane, Sarah, and David Mills with which request this Meeting unites and received them as members of our Society.\"[34]\n\n\" In the latter part of 1799 some families of friends from Bush River MM, South Carolina, settled near the present site of Waynesville. Some months later a group of Friends arrived from Hopewell MM, Va., and during the same year, a few from North Carolina. Other Friends continued to arrive and a volunteer meeting for worship was established April 26, 1801, at Waynesville. Twelve families were represented in the meeting. All of these members were certified to Westland Monthly Meeting, Western Pennsylvania. This meeting was recognized by Westland Monthly Meeting, December 26, 1801, and Miami MM was established October 13, 1803. From this nucleus developed the meetings of Ohio west of Hocking River, including what later became West Branch QM to the north and Whitewater QM in eastern Indiana, as well as all the friends meetings in Indiana and farther west.\n\nThe rapid settlement of Friends in the valleys of the Miamis is shown by the fact that in three years, from the middle of 1804 to the middle of 1807, there were received at Miami Monthly Meeting 367 removal certificates conveying to that meeting the membership of 1697 persons. These did not all settle in the vicinity of Waynesville nor even in Warren County, but were scattered through what are now Clinton, Highland, Greene, Montgomery, Miami and Preble counties in Ohio, and Wayne County, Indiana.\"[35]\n\nAccording to Bush River Monthly Meeting records, the families of Robert Kelly, Abijah O'Neall, and James Mills settled near Waynesville, Ohio on November 20, 1799.[36] Certificates of membership were received by multiple families, including those of Alexander Mills and James Mills, at the Westland Monthly Meeting, Washington County, Pennsylvania on December 25, 1802 from Bush River Monthly Meeting, Newberry County, South Carolina dated September 25, 1802. The first marriage was James' son William to Mary Richards. It was solemnized by a Baptist minister since the monthly meeting that needed to be consulted was so far away.[37]\n\nMiami Monthly Meeting (Warren County, Ohio)\n\nThe new meeting had a phenomenal growth from the beginning. The migration from the south to the Northwest, which disrupted so many meetings in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, was in full tide and for several years Miami was the principal objective point if the home seekers. In the first five years of its existence, Miami Monthy Meeting received about 550 certificates of membership from other monthly meetings. Of these certificates about 170 were from South Carolina, 150 from North Carolina, 75 from Virginia, 50 from Tennessee and 35 from Georgia. Others were from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland. The total number of memberships received on the basis of these certificates was about 2200.\n\nThe first meeting house, a log structure, was built in 1805, according to account. Previous to that time meetings were held in private houses. In 1811, a brick meeting house was constructed. In 1828 the meeting was divided into two branches. The followers of the doctrines of Elias Hicks constituted one branch, called Hicksite after the name of their leader. Those who rejected Hick's teachings formed the other branch, called Orthodox. The Orthodox branch, being in the minority, withdrew to the old log meeting house, while the Hicksites remained in possession of the brick house.\"[38]\n\nI have not seen any land records for James Mills in Newberry County. The first known land record in Warren County, Ohio was 100 acres purchased from David Pugh in 1817 and sold to William and Mary Evans in 1820. James must have purchased other lands since he sold 57 acres each to Curtis, David, and Isaac Mills in 1818. (see Mills Ohio Land Records) James bought a lot in Winchester, Randolph County, Indiana in 1821. (see Mills Indiana Land Records)\n\nThey were granted a certificate from Miami Monthly Meeting, dated April 26, 1820 to New Garden Monthly Meeting, Indiana. James is listed in the 1820 Wayne County Census. They moved to Arba Monthly Meeting on September 28, 1831.[39] [40] [41]\n\nThe notes for the May 25, 1831 Arba Monthly Meeting of Women Friends states, \"Those appointed in case of James Mills and his wife Lydia request report it is complied with and men friends produced a certifycate which was read, but some friends not being satisfied it is continued under the same friends care another month.\"\n\nThe May 25, 1831 Arba Monthly Meeting of Friends notes state, \"The friends appointed to prepare a certificate for James Mills and wife Lydia produced one but there appearing an obstruction in the meeting it directs it to be retained in the hands of the same committee and appoints Micajah Morgan & Thomas Parker to have the case under care and report to next Meeting.\"\n\nThe notes for the meeting held June 22, 1831, states \"Those continued in case of James Mills and his wife Lydia requested Report that they found nothing to hinder and men friends produced over a certificate which was read approved and signed.\"\n\nOn October 9, 1837, Lydia Mills married George Arnold in Warren County, Ohio. The were wed by Justice of the Peace, George Harlan. She was disowned by the Quakers at the Miami Monthly Meeting on December 26, 1838 for marrying out of unity. George Arnold was married previously to Lydia's sister, Rachel Jay.[42]\n\nGeorge signed his will on May 26, 1840. He left Lydia $200 provided she leaves his grandson and lives with another person. He left his grandson, John Arnold, Jr., his farm and estate. He named his son, John Arnold, Sr., executor, but when the will was proved during the March Term of the Clinton County, Ohio Court of Common Plea, both John Arnold, Sr. and John Hawkins refused to be the executor. Lydia was not mentioned in the court proceeding. (see Mills Ohio Probate Records)\n\nIn the 1840 Census, there is a man age 80 to 89 years old living in the household of John Arnold, Jr. However, the only other persons in the household were two males age 20 to 29 (one being John Arnold), one female age 20 to 29, and one female under 5.\n\nChildren of James and Lydia (Jay):\n\nWilliam (d.

They were married by James Neal \"A Minister of the Gospel.\" Elisha married second on November 13, 1869 to Elizabeth Talbert (September 17, 1844 Indiana-January 26, 1934 Wabash, Indiana). They were wed by J. W. Hiett, Minister. Elizabeth was the daughter of Elijah and Mary (Pray) Talbert.\n\nBessie Mills, Elizabeth Talbot Mills, Clara Mills Kinsey, Elijah Mills, Rose Mills Bond\n\nElisha was disowned by the Quakers on July 4, 1850. The Westfield Monthly Meeting notes state, \"Elisha Mills who has had a right of membership in the society has joined another society of religious profession attended a marriage accomplished contrary to our discipline and departed from plainness in dress for which he has been treated with without the desired effect we therefore disown him from being a member with us.\"\n\nIn December 1856, Martha's parents, John and Martha Metsker, sold Elisha and Martha 58 ½ acres in Noblesville Township. The land was sold back to John and Martha in August 1865 during Elisha and Martha's divorce and sold back to Martha Mills. (see Mills Indiana Land Records) Martha's lands were partitioned between her three children after her death. (see Mills Indiana Court Records and Mills Indiana Probate Records)\n\nBracelet Elisha Mills brought back from the Civil War for his daughter.\n\nElisha and Martha owned a three story brick house on the West Bend of the White River near Noblesville, Indiana. In the summer of 1862, he enlisted in the civil war and fought in Company D of the 75th Indiana regiment. His muster card states he had a dark complexion, black eyes, black hair and was 6'1\". Led by Colonel John U. Petit, the company chased Morgan's forces through Kentucky and Tennessee. On September 19th and 20th, 1863, they fought in the Battle of Chickamauga. They also fought in the Battle of Missionary Ridge on November 25, 1863. The regiment continued into Georgia and joined Sherman's march on November 16, 1964 and reached Savannah in December. The last action the regiment saw was at Smithfield, North Carolina in January of 1865. He left service on June 8, 1865. Elisha bought back some souvenirs from his battles. He had a Stradivarius violin that he said he bought from a fellow soldier as well as a small gold bracelet for his daughter, Clara. The bracelet was recovered from a hidden cache of gold and jewels taken from a southern mansion.\n\nWhen Elisha returned he found out Martha had been living with another man. According to Mills family side, she had presumed that he had died in the war and started living with the farm hand hired to help run the farm during his absence. Upon finding this out, he left the house, went to the field, and struck the hired hand a blow that flattened him to the ground. The Metsker's version has Elisha coming back from the war and financed a large party for his Civil War buddies from the money Martha had saved after paying off the farm mortgage while he was at war. Elisha filed a complaint for divorce on May 14, 1866. Since Martha failed to appear for the court summons, the case was ruled in Elisha's favor and neither sides' complaints were recorded. (see Mills Indiana Court Records)\n\nMartha supposedly did laundry to buy a violin and practiced in the haymow or hayloft because her father did not want her to play the violin.\n\nMartha married second John Wrenn (ca. 1844 Hamilton County, Indiana-January 14, 1921 Placierville, CA). He was the son of Elijah and Martha Wrenn, who lived near Martha's parent according to the 1860 and 1870 Noblesville Township, Hamilton County Censuses. He went to medical school, and the plan was for her to do the same, but she died before she started. Shortly after Martha's death, he was living with the family of Gideon Newby in Delaware Township and listed as a farmer in the 1870 Census. John married second Elizabeth Keyser. She was from Neichstach, Bavaria and studied medicine at Homeopathic College of New York City. They lived in Cincinnati, where they were enumerated in the 1880 Census and he was listed as a doctor while Elizabeth was listed as a housekeeper. They had two children, Joe and Florence. The family moved to Placerville, California in 1887, where she died on May 23, 1898. Florence died before her mother.[51] [52]\n\nThe 1900 census has a John Wrenn listed in Knox County, Illinois living with the family of Clinton Wrenn. He is listed as a boarder and day laborer, but his birth month is reported as January 1845, birthplace as Indiana, and marital status as widowed. (John's son Joe was living in a boarding house in Placerville per the 1900 Census.) John then married Sarah E. Melton in Washington County, Kansas on August 27, 1901. The had 3 children, William, Howard, and Agnes Martha. They are reported in the 1910 and 1920 census, except for Howard, who is only reported in the 1910 Census, age 2. &nbp;Other tragedies that occurred in the Wrenn family were the suicide by hanging of John Wrenn's older brother in October 1859 per the 1860 Noblesville Township Census Mortality Schedule, and the arrest of John's son Joe on 2 counts of grand theft in 1929. He was received in San Quentin on May 28, 1929; paroled on October 28, 1931; and discharged on July 28, 1933. He was a physician at the time.\n\nMartha's estate was auctioned by her second husband on November 12, 1869. The advertisement mentions all personal property will be sold including horses, cattle, sheep, two wagons, household furniture and other articles.\n\nElisha met Elizabeth Talbert when he delivered the message to her that her fiancé Townsen Newby had died in the Civil War. Elisha was elected auditor of Hamilton County on March 1, 1869. In October 1869, he was living on Catherine Street in Nobleville.\n\nHe raised racing horses for a while. In a May 7, 1875 article in the Noblesville Ledger touted one of his horses, Paddy Jr., as \"to be the finest specimen of a general purpose horse in Hamilton County.\" On May 7, the Ledger referred to Big John, owned by Elisha Mills, as a magnificent Jack and without doubt the best foul-getter in Central Indiana. On September 7, 1877, the Ledger reported \"Elisha Mills' mare Lizzie appears to have been in bad luck in the race. She came in seventh and last.\"\n\nBack row: Cecil, Elizabeth Talbert, James\n\nFront row: Jennie, Rose, and Bessie Mills\n\nIn May 1878, he was living about 1 mile west of Noblesville. He was elected as superintendent of the Sheridan Sunday School in May 1879. In July 1879 there was a land sale due to the case of Samuel Arnett, Administer of E. Arnett are plaintiffs and Elisha Mills, Elizabeth T. Mills, Thomas Levi, et al. are defendents. In September 1880, Elisha and Elizabeth moved with their family to Howard County, Indiana.

It is given as 1-17-1704/5. The list starts double dating with 1-4-1699-1700, but the practice is inconsistent. Some, but not all, of the 11th, 12th, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd months are double dated. It is assumed that 1st month is March.\n\n[2] In Coldham's Complete Book of Emigrants 1661-1699, there are four references to the ship \"Henry and Ann\".

Munro's property and private business papers had been confiscated, and he intended to hold the deed books as ransom. In order to hide them from the Americans, Munro buried the Orange County deed books in a wooded area near the town and went on his way, leaving them to rot in the ground.\n\nThat is why there is a lacuna in the present Orange County deed books from 1752 through 1781. One early books containg deeds proved from the June Court of 1755 through the June Court of 1756 escaped Munro's clutches; this is now Deed Book 1. Deed Book 2 contains the few deeds from 1752 through 1781 that were brought in for re-recordation, as well as the deeds proved from 1782 into the year 1785.\" The probate of deeds recorded in the court minutes were extracted by the Clerk of Court into a separate volumer during the years 1752 to 1763. Though there is no surviving descriptopns of most of the land transactions, names of grantors, grantees, and witnesses, acreage, and probate dates are available.\n\nSince Quakers forbade swearing oaths, Colonial law required them to take the deed or bill of sale to the Court and officially personally acknowledge it. Thus, the Register contains many examples of Quakers selling property.\n\nIn the book, Specific dates were assigned instead of the original \"the second Tuesday of\" the month to facilitate research.\n\n[29] Newberry County was formed from the Ninety-Six District in 1785.\n\n[30] Many of the birth and death dates of John Mills and his family came from the Cane Creek Monthly Meeting in Union County, South Carolina.
