        "text": "Jennie (Enos) Snyder was born on Aug. 9, 1881 near Normalville, Fayette County, PA, the daughter of Perry and Joanna (Minerd) Enos.\n\nIn early adulthood, prior to marriage, Jennie was active in the Poplar Run Sunday School and served as its librarian. She and her husband belonged to this church all their lives.\n\nOn Dec. 15, 1903, when she was age 22, Jennie was united in marriage with 25-year-old Norman S. Snyder (1878-1954). He was the son of John S. and Melinda (Shaffer) Snyder of Indian Head in nearby Saltlick Township. Rev. J.W.K. Salomon performed the nuptials.\n\nAt the time of marriage, Norman earned a living as a laborer.\n\nThe couple went on to have 10 known children  Clarence Snyder, Mabel Richter, Nettie Snyder, Alverda Firestone, Pauline Brown, Kathryn Prinkey, James Ernest Snyder, Charles Edward Snyder, Dollie Laymon and Erma Laymon McCue. Sadly, daughter Nettie died as an infant.\n\nThey resided at Bakersville, Somerset County, PA in the early 1910s, before settling at White near Normalville. Circa 1920, when the federal census was enumerated, the family resided near Indian Head in Saltlick Township, and Norman operated his own blacksmith shop. Later, Norman was supervisor of road maintenance for 24 years in Saltlick Township. The family were members of the Poplar Run Church of God of Prophecy.\n\nSeveral of the Snyder daughters liked to tease by calling each other \"Hen Miner,\" the name of a grand-uncle, Henry A. Miner. The story was that the uncle \"would get his temper up\" or \"got upset\" or more accurately \"got spells\" and this was derogatory enough in the minds of the girls that it made for a good insult.\n\nWhen she was widowed and in her later years, Jennie's mother came to live in their home. As her mind began to fail, and her memory play tricks from decades earlier, she would awaken in the middle of the night and rouse Jennie, saying it was time to kill chickens and cook and bake for the threshers who were staying there to work. Sometimes, during those episodes, Jennie would gently say \"Mother, let's go back to bed, we'll take care of it in the morning.\" At other times, however, the two of them would be up most of the night. Then in the morning, when Jennie would ask about it, her mother would say, \"Why didn't you smack me in the face and tell me to go to bed?\" But, as one of Jennie's daughters later recalled, \"You couldn't tell my grandmother anything like that.\"\n\nNorman endured kidney disease for a decade prior to his death. When he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in early June 1954, he died only four days later, at home, on June 8, 1954 after an extended illness,\" said the Courier. Rev.'s William Smith and Charles Uphold officiated at the funeral service. The Courier noted that among Norman's survivors were 17 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.\n\nJennie was afflicted for two decades with chronic bronchial problems. She died a little more than a year after her husband, from complications of heart disease, on June 18, 1955. They are buried in Normalville Cemetery.\n\n~ Son Clarence Snyder ~\n\nSon Clarence Snyder (1904-1957) was born on May 24, 1904, in Indian Head, Fayette County, the eldest of the Snyder children.\n\nTragically, he suffered from a congenital birth defect -- commonly called \"water on the brain\" -- which led to an over-enlarged skull for his entire life.\n\nHe never married and died of kidney ailments on April 23, 1957 at the age of 52. Burial was in Normalville Cemetery.\n\nEarl and Mabel, early 1940s\n\n~ Daughter Mabel (Snyder) Richter ~\n\nDaughter Mabel Snyder (1906-1993) was born on Jan. 29, 1906 in Saltlick Township, Fayette County.\n\nOn May 14, 1923, at Freed or Stauffer near Mt. Pleasant, Westmoreland County, PA, the 17-year-old Mabel was united in marriage with 19-year-old Earl Richter (1903-1974). The ceremony was preformed by Jim Wiltrout, said to have been \"a one armed justice of the peace.\" Earl was the son of Allen and Harriet (Robbins) Richter, and at the time of marriage worked as a laborer.\n\nThey had five daughters -- Beulah Berger, Helen Nicholson, Grace Kooser, Mae Grimm and Erma E. White.\n\nThe family moved to a farm near White and remained there actively farming for decades.\n\nSaid the Connellsville Daily Courier, Earl \"was a retired farmer and conducted a farm products route in Connellsville for more than 35 years. He also was a former coal miner. He was a member of the Clinton Church of God, and was choir leader, a former elder, Sunday school superintendent and teacher of the Mens Bible Class.\n\nMabel had a deep love for family history and retained in he memory many stories she had been told by her parents, uncles and aunts. She kept a collection of hundreds of Daily Courier obituaries of family and friends.\n\nSadly, Earl was stricken and died on arrival at Connellsville State General Hospital at the age of 70 on March 28, 1974. Survivors included 15 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.\n\nMabel outlived him by nearly two decades. She passed away at home on Sept. 6, 1993, at the age of 87. An obituary in the Greensburg Tribune-Review noted that she was survived by 15 grandchildren, 23 great-grandchildren and one great-great grandchild. Interment was in the Normalville Cemetery, with Rev. John L. Woods officiating at the funeral.\n\nDaughter Erma E. Richter (1923-2013) was born on Aug. 15, 1923 in Normalville.
