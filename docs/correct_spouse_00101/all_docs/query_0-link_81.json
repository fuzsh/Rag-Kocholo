        "text": "As I write this column, I am looking out at a lovely fall day after the only beneficial rain we have had in months. It has been a beautiful summer and fall, and I hope you have enjoyed them as I have. • I recently spoke with Mary Elizabeth Brennan Shea, MS’59. She tells me she is still living in her home of more than 60 years and remains active with several organizations in Salem. They include the Salem Garden Club and the Explorers Lifelong Learning Institute at Salem State University. • I talked with Frank Cruise in October. He and Pat are doing well and are living in a retirement-care community. Frank and I came from Somerville. In the summer before starting at Boston College, we worked in the public library book bindery. Although not on active duty, Frank is still a true Marine. I also enjoyed talking with Pat. Pat knew my mother and sister, Anne, and each time we talk, she recalls fond memories of those relationships. • As time goes on, we have become fewer and fewer. It is becoming difficult to find content for this column. It would help if you were to contact the Alumni Association or me directly at 508-755-3615 with a bit of news. Best wishes for the New Year.\n\nThe news is slim this season as our lives slim down so unexpectedly in this era of the coronavirus. Unfortunately, most celebrations, travel, and gatherings have been delayed or canceled for all of us. • But Ellie Pope Clem was the first to come through, with news of the birth of a new grandchild (one thing that can’t be postponed!) and plans for a family wedding in January 2021, details of which are still in flux. Meanwhile, Dave and Ellie are in comfort and safety at the Colonnades in Charlottesville, Virginia. As restrictions on outside events loosened up, they were able to attend concerts of their son Michael while the warm weather held but will soon revert to online listening. • Liz Doyle Eckl reports some changes in her life, including the postponement of her first grandchild’s wedding and the long-awaited visit of her oldest son. She stays busy decluttering her house (an ongoing process for all of us), reading, and doing many activities on Zoom. Liz has been in touch with Margy Craig Sheehy, who has moved back to DC after many years in her Montessori teaching career in California. • Kate McCann Benson writes from her community in Hanover, New Hampshire, her wishes for good health for all. She recalls such wonderful memories of our years together. • I (Connie Weldon LeMaitre) was delighted to receive a phone call from Barbara Lowe Eckel, MSW’59, in Atlanta. We had so much to catch up on since our days as freshman roommates (along with Mary Leigh Madden) in Stuart Hall, directly across the hall from Mother White, whose door read “WARDEN.” You can imagine my terror of this flying nun (who turned out to be so loving and supportive); this was my first introduction to and venture in a Catholic institution. We roommates were a diverse trio who quickly learned to adapt to each other’s backgrounds and live in small quarters (remember those narrow beds and small desks). It was Barbara’s first time away from her home in Jamaica, and I am sure I didn’t empathize enough with her adjustment and homesick moments. I have hence apologized for being such a selfish 17-year-old, but gracious Barbara said she didn’t notice! I do urge you all to stay in touch with your old friends from a simpler and youthful time. It is so rewarding. • If you need the contact info of old friends, let me know as I have some addresses and phone numbers of NC’57 classmates. Call me: 978-258-3288.\n\nKudos and thanks to Joan Downing Lachance for her efforts these past years in compiling our class notes after she replaced Dave Rafferty as class correspondent. You served us well, Joan. Now it’s up to us, classmates, to fill the notes column. If you are like me, when Boston College Magazine arrives, you turn first to the class notes for 1958 before you read the articles. But without contributions from you, our column will deteriorate into nothing more than my contact info. Can you take five minutes to email a snippet of your life in these maroon and golden years—just so we know you are “still kicking”? Are you a great-grandparent? Anyone a great-great-grandparent? Do you have a grandchild at BC? Still traveling? Are you a snowbird? • John Theall checked in with news that he is keeping in shape playing tennis. John and Evie’s granddaughter Cameron Elders is a senior at BC. Another granddaughter, Katie Elders, is a sophomore and varsity lacrosse player at Dartmouth. • Grace and Bob Taggart celebrated their 61st wedding anniversary in October. They raised 7 children and have 12 grandchildren. Bob was a member of the BC varsity baseball team and sends greetings to his teammates. • Thomas Hassey ’88 notified us of the death of his father, Tom Hassey, in May and said how proud Tom was of his BC heritage: “I think his blood was maroon and gold.” Tom was an active member of our board over the years and a fixture at many reunions. • We enjoyed our final luncheon at the Wianno Club in Osterville on Cape Cod in August 2019. Elaine Gilmore, who was at Wianno when Ed Gilmore launched the first event, was there to close it out. Thanks go to Barbara Cuneo O’Connell, Pat Brine O’Riordan, and the late Dottie Sollitto Hiltz, who took over hosting from Ed. It was great to see at the Wianno Club Peg Quinn, Joe Cavanaugh and Barbara Hermberg, Lavinia and Joe Giardina, Gail and Bill Sweeney, Kenneth Joyce, Marian Bernardini DeLollis, Virginia DeGenova, and Joyce Ryder Rizzuto. • Thanks to Bea Capraro Busa, who is again hosting the Naples, Florida, luncheon around St. Patrick’s Day 2021. If you’re interested in attending, contact Bea at bcbusa58@bc.edu. FYI: For those of us born in the late 1930s, life expectancy for men was 58 years; for women, 62 years. Carpe diem!\n\nMary Azzara Archdeacon begins: “Dear friend, aren’t we lucky we’re still corresponding!” She will be celebrating her 84th birthday with her sister Joan and Mary Keating McKell at the Three Village Inn in Stony Brook, New York. She and dear friends say the rosary every Tuesday and Thursday, via Zoom, for her daughter Vickie, who is battling cancer. • Sheila Quinlan Brown writes from Vashon Island off the coast of Seattle that she is in good health. Several months ago, Brian, her husband of 58 years, died at home. Sheila is grateful she could care for him with the help of hospice. Her four children live nearby. The youngest often travels to Mexico. • Julie Saver Reusch expresses dismay that the lockdown has denied her the joy of hugging loved ones, but her good news is that she will be a great-grandmother again to a baby boy, the grandson of Joshua’s son. • Anne Defazio Berra writes she connects by calling old friends. She stays busy gardening, reading, and keeping tabs on Margie George Vis. Margie’s broken left femur has healed, but she has also undergone quadruple heart bypass surgery and hip replacement revision surgery. Her 2020 travels were curtailed, but she was able to make three week-long visits to the George family cottage in Wisconsin with her sister Sue and her brother Steve and his wife, Charlotte. She has been blessed with the loving care of her eldest daughter, Elle. • Jo Kirk Cleary enjoyed a good summer on the Cape. Her two brothers, their wives, and she and husband Billy had several picnic-style sunset dinners on the beach while observing the negative effects the California wildfires had on the sunsets on the Cape. Returning to Auburndale, they had to contend with an old copper beech tree that had fallen on their garage in August. Her good news is that Billy has fully recuperated from his bypass surgery and is back to golf and walking—but no more ice cream. • Sheila Hurley Canty enjoyed visiting family and friends at their house on the Cape. While not able to hug her grandchildren, she was blessed by the presence of her sister Kay, who moved from Maryland to Massachusetts in June. Peg Keane Timpson ’76, is well in Manchester, enjoying long walks on the beach, a little golf, online bridge, and some social-distance gatherings with family and friends. She misses her volunteer work at the Peabody Essex Museum. • Judith Young Runnette has been following the pandemic rules by reading digital books from the library, playing online bridge, and knitting, which she took up in January. • Maureen O’Donnell Kent sends best wishes to all and hopes to get south this winter. • I have been in contact with Kate Glutting Arcand, who experienced a serious fall resulting in a hospital stay and a move to an assisted living facility, Osher Inn at the Cedars, in Portland, Maine. She is in good spirits and welcomes visits with grandchildren. • The Schorr family is well in New Jersey, trying to adjust to the fact that we must follow Army football via TV instead of in the stadium. I am working hard at recovering from colorectal surgery by walking 10,000 steps a day and playing a little golf and tennis. I join all our classmates who have expressed their wishes that we all stay well, enjoy many blessings in the upcoming year, and remember with gratitude the time we spent together learning in the Sacred Heart tradition.\n\nWell, as I write, the coronavirus continues to be the dominant news in our lives, followed closely by the looming presidential election. Or is it the other way around? Classes resume at Chestnut Hill, for now anyway, “Pops on the Heights” goes virtual, and football is played in mostly empty surroundings. Strange. • News from and about classmates: Peter Murphy, a retired ambassador and consultant, reports that the BC alumni news gets to Monaco two months after publication, but he’s staying there since his family is scattered over the world, including in London, Bangkok, Italy, and New York City. • Sad news, reporting the recent death of Tom Mahoney of Peabody and St. John’s Prep before BC. His obituary noted that he was the youngest of nine, and he never forgot summers spent working at leather tanneries in Peabody. He was also proud of the no-hitter that he pitched in eighth grade against a rival city grammar school. In his US Navy career he was the medical doctor for a lengthy Antarctic tour, maybe the only class member with that credit. • I also saw Cal Dorsey, of Malden and Malden Catholic, at the services for Tom; Cal still manages to look 20 years younger. Tom and Cal went on to Georgetown Medical and then returned to practice locally. • Lastly, I report the recent death of Beth Grady, MS’64, a student and later a faculty member in BC’s nursing program. Beth was a leader in class affairs, always willing to organize an event and round up support. She created and coordinated the effort to publish a yearbook for our 50th. A woman of widespread accomplishments, professionally and personally, she will be missed. • Send your notes, contact a classmate, brighten your day. If you need contact info, I’ve got it.\n\nIt has been difficult at best to gather material for this month’s column, given that most of us have been hunkering down and curtailing normal activities, but I thank Al Hyland and Ken Cahill for reiterating what seems to be the overall message from classmates that their major activity has been just trying to stay healthy. I have, however, been able to gather a few bits and pieces. • John Sheehan is continuing his studies of the Irish (Gaelic) language. He was fortunate enough to recently get to Dublin, Donegal, and Clare (before the pandemic, I presume). John helped me get started on my own Irish study, and I can already tell you that any language that has two different names for each day of the week is not something for the faint-hearted. No wonder most of our ancestors from the Emerald Isle spoke English when they arrived here. • Pauline LeBlanc Doherty and her husband, Paul Croke ’55, MBA’62, are giving up their beautiful Scituate home to move to Linden Ponds in Hingham. • My wife, Kay, and I managed to get out of Australia just before all the restrictions and closures took place, but after arriving back in New Hampshire, we found that the queen (well actually the prime minister) had closed the Canadian border to all Americans, even those who have summer homes in Nova Scotia. The fortunate part was that for the first time ever, Kay got to spend autumn in New Hampshire during one of the most spectacular foliage seasons I have ever seen. • John Flaherty and his wife, Julie, also had a close encounter, ending a trip to Antarctica right before the curtains closed. Although still domiciled in Longboat Key, Florida, they have just acquired a summer home in Highland, North Carolina. • Fortunately, I know of only one death since our last column, that of Double Eagle and singer-musician Joe Forry ’61. I still have a fond recollection from years ago of spotting Joe at the piano, entertaining the dinner patrons of a well-known restaurant in Alexandria, Virginia. • Did Jack Ferris actually name his new dog Fenway? • As I am writing this, two weeks before the presidential election, I suspect the world may have changed a bit by the time you read this. I’ll be interested to hear how some of you may have been affected. Sorry for all the self-references, but as I said, it has been difficult to gather material recently. • One last FYI: the Alumni Association is considering “make-up” class reunions in June 2021 for those classes whose reunion had to be canceled this past year. • Sláinte!\n\nDon’t forget that 2021 is our anniversary year! Reunion Weekend will take place in June. Volunteers are always welcome! • Faith Mead Bertrand writes: “It will be wonderful seeing those of us who can make this reunion…. As for my activities during this time, the past six-plus months began for my husband, Jerry, and me with an 80th birthday trip to New Orleans. We drove and spent five weeks away from the snow and cold in Boston. For the past three years, I have played in an all-accordion orchestra that rehearsed in Wellesley. We have played several concerts, one of which I organized and which raised over $1,700 for the local food pantry.” • Maryann Morrisey Curtain writes: “Indeed this time has been different.” She read 93 books, including Moby Dick and Le Comte de Monte-Cristo, which she tried in French, with some success. She also enjoyed Zoom meetings with her church group and met “some of the ladies,” including Ellen MacDonald Carbone. • Beth Good Wadden writes: “I would love for this event [Reunion] to happen! I am teaching two yoga classes each week, using Zoom. My sister, my children, and my grandchildren come to class—from Boston, Rhode Island, Minneapolis, San Diego, Palm Springs, and Seattle!” • Judy Thompson Collins writes that her Nashville son, Paul, started an art project to encourage people to vote. Paul is professor of art at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, Tennessee. • From Gail Giere Collins: “I made masks until the stores ran out of elastic. Frank ’59 and I go to Mass with about 50 people here in Massachusetts. The doors are open, every other pew is roped off, and Mass ends after Communion. God bless first responders.” Many of Gail’s children and their families have contracted and recovered from COVID-19 because they are in the medical field. “Our parents had to live through a recession and two world wars, and we will survive this with care and patience and come out stronger,” Gail writes. • Joan Merrick Egan emailed in September: “We are still on the Cape and had lunch with Alice Dresser Pusateri and Gail Giere Collins. As for the smoke, we were lucky that Indian Wells (California) was too far to get hit with the ash, but we had very dark skies. What a year.” She was planning to head back to California in October. • I have spoken to Ellen MacDonald Carbone and Mary Nolan Calise a few times. They and their families are well.\n\nWe hope you have all seen the picture and article featuring our own Samuel Fardy in Boston College Magazine. At the BC Band’s 100th anniversary celebration, Sam, one of the senior members of SymBa, was asked to write an article with a glimpse back at the band’s early days. Sam never dreamed the article would appear in the alumni magazine. “I had no idea how much attention that publication gets. I am getting calls from friends I didn’t even know went to BC,” he writes. • Patricia and Kevin Doyle “escaped” to Chatham on the Cape to celebrate the upcoming big day when Kevin would join the “Octogenarian Club.” Statistically, they ran into an unbelievable scenario. Five people in the 12-room inn had birthdays on the same day! Kevin wants to send congratulations to all who belong to this exclusive “club.” • Carol Dorey Hurzeler retired last fall from psychiatric nursing and now works one day per week at the St. Vincent de Paul thrift store run by her church, attends two Al-Anon meetings weekly, belongs to the church choir, and works out regularly at the gym. She says she is “happy to find out I can do the gym, sing with my mask on, and socially distance!” The Hurzelers have four children and eight grandchildren. • Paul Horrigan is now retired and has a new address: You can email him at paulhorrigan123@gmail.com. He sends best wishes to all. • Both Charles McCarthy and William Nagle, MEd’70, called to say hi. • Our condolences to the families of the following classmates. Jean Marie Hanagan Allin taught French and Spanish in several school districts. She was predeceased by her husband, Sherwood, and leaves a daughter, Catherine. Anthony Capodilupo was the star of many campus plays and shows. After earning an MFA in drama from Yale University, he received very positive reviews as a cast member in several Broadway plays. Tony also wrote, produced, and starred in plays presented in a theater he opened beneath The European Restaurant. Ultimately, he entered his father’s real estate business and was a successful businessman. Tony was predeceased by his wife, Sara, and leaves two daughters. Walter Whalen’s many accomplishments included serving as a lieutenant JG aboard the USS Albany and holding leadership positions in several companies before becoming executive director of International Business Products. Walter especially enjoyed his golden retrievers, which he trained and registered as therapy pets. Walter leaves his wife, Jeannie, and three children. After graduation, John Kazmierczak served in the US Army. John enjoyed running his own business, County Line Associates, attending BC football games, vacationing on the Jersey Shore, and celebrating holidays with his family. John leaves his wife, Mary Joan, and four children. Francis Coyle is survived by his wife, Mary Kay, three daughters, and two stepsons. Born in Scotland, Frank became a US citizen in 1962. He served in the US Army, was promoted to captain, and received the Army Commendation Medal for meritorious service. Most of his career was with Raytheon as an engineer. James Dacey believed in equality for all; he marched with Dr. King and became friends with US Representative John Lewis. Jim earned a doctorate in math, taught math and science, and also coached Little League. He faced multiple myeloma with great courage, determination, and acceptance. Jim was predeceased by his wife, Judith, and leaves two children. • We hope you and all you hold dear are well.\n\nJudy Pizzarello Bishop, who comes from a career in broadcast journalism and was a senior producer at CNBC in the 1990s, wrote that she has just written a book, published in August, called Changing Channels: From Just the Facts to Outrageous Opinions (Palmetto, 2020). In it she explores this headline-driven phenomenon. It’s a book about television journalism, its present and its future told by the people who know it best. Through exclusive interviews and little-known public statements, high-profile anchors, reporters, executives, and media critics weigh in and tell us what they really think when the cameras aren’t rolling. It’s a great read. Congratulations, Judy! • Mary Bobay Murphy, like all of us, is locked down because of COVID-19 and grateful to have children and grandchildren nearby to socially distance visit with and help with food shopping. • I too am blessed to have 12 of my 13 grandchildren living nearby. My daughter, Kelly ’87, who along with her son is a gourmet cook, spoils me with meals delivered to my door. • Gail Capon Hill has children living in the Boston area, New York City, and upstate New York, which is more typical of most of our classmates. Gail and I agreed that those early-morning “senior hours” for food shopping are great. As hard as it is, everyone seems to be adjusting to the new norm, with family Zoom calls, and watching the grandkids soccer games from the car. The consensus is that we can handle this but agree it is much more difficult for our children and grandchildren. We were lucky to have had a great college experience at Newton. I wonder what Zoom mixers in the Quonset hut would look like! • Bobbi Schroetter Speck says that she is pursuing most of her activities through Zoom and is back on the tennis court. Her seven grandkids, ages 12–23, have all been working with their dads/uncles in the family winery during the pandemic. “My sons don’t just work for our winery—they are the winery! Henry of Pelham is still our main brand and is premium wine, but ‘the boys’ have also branded themselves, and if you look at their website (speckbros.ca) you’ll see some fun brands, too.” I well remember, Bobbi, your treating us to your wine at one of our parties on the eve of a reunion. • Julie McGraw Brown is working remotely for Powered by People, Beto O’Rourke’s newest organization focused on assisting Democratic candidates running for Congress. • When I was calling classmates to update our database, I found Carol Lo Chin, who lives in Wellesley, in California, where she and her husband have been stranded in their condo in Dublin for months because of COVID-19. I was able to give her Gerry Wang Huang’s contact info in Mountain View, so hopefully they can have a distanced visit! • Liz Martin Dougherty is contentedly settled in her new assisted-living home in Silver Spring, Maryland. Liz was the queen of knitters, so she will never be lacking something to do. • Dale Mullarkey, who lives on the coast in North Carolina, also keeps busy with her knitting and needlepoint. Her career had been in the world of finance, so she continues to consult with nonprofits. Two of her granddaughters have ventured to Ireland and Scotland for college. One attended St. Andrew’s in Scotland and is now working for Discovery in New York City while the other is a senior at Trinity College in Dublin. A third granddaughter is a freshman at the University of Denver. Whether here or in Europe, our college-age grandchildren seem to be doing most of their classes online. I can’t imagine SWC online! • Mary Hallisey McNamara is thrilled to have her son Paul ’94 and his family moving back east. Paul has been on the West Coast for years as California bureau chief for CNBC. He has now taken a position in New York City as a producer for The News with Shepard Smith on CNBC at 7:00 p.m. Mary’s other son lives in New Jersey, so family get-togethers, post COVID, will be a lot easier. • I am sorry to report that Linda Keenan Kraft, our classmate freshman and sophomore years, passed away in May. • Barbara Keane Blais is still enjoying her life in Gloucester and proximity to the ocean, where she swims daily from mid-May to mid-September. • Please let me know if you have any changes in your address, email, or phone, and send me news!\n\nIn August, Carol and Jim Norton hosted the third annual Cape Cod summer luncheon, beautifully catered at their Mashpee home. Present and socially distanced were Judy and Frank Carney, Kay and John Golden, Meg and Dave Kelley, Karen and Tom Quirk, and Oky and Brian Sullivan, MA’65. • Elder softball is back! Doubleheaders take place on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. Mike Neri, for one, relishes the healthy activity; it’s the “best exercise I get, plus one golfing round per week,” he says. Mike also recalled our gathering at last year’s Veterans Day Mass on November 11, 2019: “It was a great day. I hope we (John Levis, Tom Quirk, Ed Rae) can make it an annual get-together.” • Joe Dimino related a story about Red Sox great Tony Conigliaro, whose rising career was cruelly curtailed in 1967 by a “beanball” injury. In early 1982, he had applied for a broadcasting position at WSBK TV-Boston, where Joe was station manager, and was a leading candidate for the job before suffering the heart attack and stroke that left him in a coma. Joe began his own career in broadcasting in 1967 as an account executive for Storer Sales in New York; he rose to national sales manager, then station manager, VP, and general manager, of WSBK-Boston—you may recall him together with Dana Hersey on the popular informative series, Ask the Manager during his time in Boston—before becoming president, television stations division, for Storer Communications Inc., in Miami. • Harry Crump passed away in September. An excellent running back for BC, he was recognized as Catholic All-American and went on to play for the Patriots. He also enjoyed golf and tennis and later played as a member of various country clubs. Professionally, most notably, Harry was president of American Flexible Conduit Company and served on several boards, including those of Roger Williams University and the Special Olympics. • Be masked. Be safe. Be well.\n\nJim Spillane, S.J., MA’68, MDiv’76, has left Tanzania and is now back at Santa Dharma University, a Jesuit school in Yogjakarta, Indonesia, where he taught for so many years before. He hopes to start a master’s program in tourism modeled after the very successful program he ran at St. Augustine University of Tanzania. • Betsy O’Connor Hand and Margie Supple Mone recently met for lunch on the Cape. After over 50 years in nursing, both retired this fall from their current positions—Betsy as an instructor at Cape Cod Community College, and Margie as a clinical nurse specialist in diabetes education at Brockton Neighborhood Health Center. • John Hirsh has completed 50 years of teaching at Georgetown University and has established the Edward L. Hirsh collection of English rare books of the 16th–19th centuries at BC’s Burns Library in memory of his father, who taught at Boston College for many years. • The New York Timesgave a rave review of Karen I Said, written and performed by Eliza Bent, Bob Bent’s daughter. “In this wicked 45-minute satire on wokeness, the problem is evident right from the start: Karen, a 38-year-old white woman, has called the police on a man of color for delivering a meat lasagna instead of the ‘vegetarian goddess’ variety she ordered,” said the Times. Theater sure is different under pandemic protocols. • John Bormolini has been contributing a monthly column of remembrances to the Local Yokel, a publication about West Stockbridge, where he grew up. Recently he recruited fellow townsman Peter Angelini, who authored “Other Pandemics: Polio and Tuberculosis” as it related to West Stockbridge in the ’40s and ’50s. (To the uninitiated, West Stockbridge is Norman Rockwell territory.) • An endowed scholarship has been established in the name of Bill Collins, MA’67, at BC High. Bill taught English there for most of his career. • Michael St. Clair, MA’65, writes: “I was a Jesuit scholastic when I graduated in 1964. After leaving the Jesuits, I became a professor of psychology at Emmanuel College, Boston, for almost 40 years. I recall with great pleasure and respect my Jesuit teachers and colleagues. My two sons are doing well, and I have three granddaughters. My education has served me well and nourished my curiosity over a lifetime. My most recent book was on Chinese art, and my latest project is on the transmission of ancient Greek manuscripts via Byzantine scribes, continuing interests from seeds planted way back from my early education.”\n\nCarol Sorace Whalen sent me the news that Professor Bill Godfrey died on April 7, 2020, at his Port Jefferson, New York, home. He was 91. He had been diagnosed with pneumonia and tested negative for the coronavirus, but doctors suspected the virus was nevertheless the cause of his death. His wife, Valerie, described him as “radically moderate,” as well as funny and an excellent cook (as quoted in Newsday). Carol said that she and Ann Marie DeNisco Labbate stayed in touch with him for decades and got together as recently as a few years ago. He was a “fan of the rigors of our Newton education” and a close friend of Faine McMullen, RSCJ. He joined the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and led the Upward Bound program at Stony Brook University, where he was the only Latin instructor for decades. And here’s where we come in! After leaving a banking career at Citibank and W.R. Grace, he took a 50-percent pay cut in 1960 to teach at Newton, specifically Spanish, French, Latin, money and banking, and Latin American history and politics! He left Newton in 1965 to teach Latin at Stony Brook. Which means that we, the Class of 1964, were the lucky ones to have him on our faculty. My write-up here is a mere hint at the list of his other accomplishments. I strongly recommend reading his obituary in the April 15, 2020, issue of Newsday. There’s even a photo! It’s fascinating reading. • Some more news, from Mary Shay McGuire: Her book of poetry, Always the Blue Tide Turning, is now available on Amazon. She said that she keeps in touch with Jennifer Kilbourn Kramer, who, Mary says, creates magnificent quilts. • During last summer, Peggy Cox Curran sold her house in Seekonk and moved to North Carolina, where she’ll be living near her daughter. Peggy is planning to winter in North Carolina and summer in Narragansett, Rhode Island. • Sue Roy Patten has also moved, from Inverness, Illinois, to Fort Myers, Florida. Thank goodness for Zoom! • I’m pretty sure that this dystopian universe we’re in is going to be with us a while longer. So all I can say is: Keep Zooming and keep eating ice cream! In moderation, of course. Except for Zooming. Zoom with reckless abandon!\n\nBob Mallon writes that he has 10 copies of an album cut by the University Chorale in 1963 and would be happy to distribute them at no cost to classmates. The album pictures Gasson Hall on the cover; he sent me a photo of it, which I could email to classmates interested in receiving one of Bob’s copies. He is looking for another album, made earlier, that had a plain white cover; he would like to borrow it and send it to California to the outfit that converted to a CD the album he already has. You can reach Bob at teacher4eva@yahoo.com. • Mike Jones sent an email about five classmates and their spouses who have been having virtual cocktail parties using Zoom: Mike and Nancy (Brox) Jones, Jack ’62 and Rosemary (Thomas) MacKinnon, Phil and Marie (Formichelli) McCarthy, Shelby and Janet (Hunt) Mudarri, and Steve and Donna (Doyle) Sutton. • Kevin Bokoske emailed me that his wife of 61 years, Nancy, passed away this September after many years of suffering. She leaves their daughter, Sharon Teitelbaum, of Arlington, Virginia, and their son, Douglas, and his wife, Mary, of Portland, Oregon. Kevin lives in Fort Lauderdale, where the funeral was held. • Kevin Flatley has republished The Little Blue Book of Estate Planning. It’s available on Amazon online books. Kevin has spent 35 years in banking and now, retired, is counsel at his son-in-law’s law practice, Keating Law Office, in Reading. Kevin and his wife live in Methuen on a lake and see their 5 children and 15 grandchildren often.\n\nGreetings! I apologize for the absence of the last two columns. I expected to be back on track with this column until my computer was infected with a virus; now on a borrowed computer of which I have little knowledge, I’m trying to recall some of the news that you have sent in past months. I promise that the next column will be better if y’all will send me some news. • Many classmates responded with beautiful tributes to Cathy Lugar after her passing in April. Cathy worked so hard to come back from the effects of a stroke but, sadly, she lost her fight against COVID-19. • William Godfrey also passed away in April, at the age of 91. Mr. Godfrey was a popular classics professor during our years at Newton. • Libby Miller Fitzgerald and her friend initiated a “Coins for Change Caring Meters” in which old parking meters are painted and refurbished to be used as “piggy banks” to collect spare change from passersby. The collections are matched by local businesses and are donated to local charities. • Thanks to Marianne Pizzuto Haggerty, we learned of the death of Barbara Ryan Burke Endrizzi due to COVID-19. Barbara left college early to marry John Burke, who died in Vietnam shortly after graduation. She is survived by her second husband and three children. • Like the rest of us, Fred and Mary (Ratchford) Hesselgrave have been locked down since the start of the pandemic. Mary’s nephew has been staying with them, allowing Mary the opportunity to spend some days hiking and kayaking while the two men spend precious time together. • I am sad to report that Joan Mutty McPartlin’s husband, Paul ’66, passed away, peacefully, in August. Paul and Joan met at a New Year’s Eve event in 1961 and were married for 54 years. They have five children. • As I write this, my wish for all is that 2021 will see the fulfillment of our fondest dreams: good health, good friends, and peace for all.\n\nOur 55th reunion is scheduled for June 2021. Stay tuned! • Here are some more thoughts on COVID-19 life from the fall. Terry Ancona Orueta writes: “Here in Spain, we are deep into the second wave of the epidemic but are better prepared to deal with it. Masks and social distancing are mandatory. School starts next week, and that seems like an impossible endeavor (so glad I’m retired!). I have loved Zoom calls with friends and family—we should have done this before!” Kathy Brosnan Dixon agrees that Zoom has been “one of the true blessings to come out of this strange time.” She and Judy Mullen Connorton, Judy McCluskey Flood, Sharon Cuffe Fleming, Sheila McIntire Barry, and Susi Marion Cooney meet every Wednesday to Zoom chat for 40 minutes. She writes: “We used to consider ourselves lucky if we saw each other once a year!” Betty Wahn Goletti writes: “Thanks to COVID-19, I’m stuck here in Rome—I suppose there are worse places to be stuck! With few tourists around, I’m really seeing my hometown. This morning my friend and I were the only two visitors at the Napoleon Museum, the Basilica of St. Augustine with its Caravaggio, and the Keats-Shelley House. It’s fun reliving the past!” Jane Cass O’Leary reports that “the pandemic completely changed our normal summer. We have a summer home, and we missed hosting our family and friends and enjoying lazy days at the beach with them. Fall goal: lose these COVID 10 pounds!” Kathy Byron Kahr, MSW’68, and her husband are downsizing—selling their family home in Providence, Rhode Island, and settling into their place in Chatham. They planned to spend the winter in Bend, Oregon, where their son Tony ’04 and his family live. “Our other son and his family live in LA, so hopefully, when the pandemic subsides, we will see more of them. This difficult time has made us decide what was most important in life, and being near family is it.” • Book recommendations from Barbara Childs Hall include The Salt Path by Raynor Winn, The Dutch House by Ann Patchett, and Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens. • Condolences to the family of Janice Sacco Ablon, who died on August 27 of complications from surgery. Janice received a master’s in psychology from Tufts and worked as a child psychologist on the North Shore of Massachusetts for many years. She was a widow; her husband Jerry had died three years ago.\n\n2021…Greetings to one and all! Since there was little news sent in, I trust that all are managing in this topsy-turvy world and will be enjoying this new year despite any continuation of the coronavirus or other challenges to our lives. Those who responded to my email all send their best wishes to the rest of you. • Terry Lane Ferrarone reports all is well with her family; the six grandchildren are in virtual and hybrid schools, despite the smoke of the western fires. • Our classmates didn’t report problems, although few apparently live around the worst of the fires. Hopefully the same is true for your families who faced any natural disasters last year. • The coronavirus challenge, and perhaps our increasing years/creaking joints, brought several to reconsider how they are living. Donna Shelton spent her fall writing “Get Out the Vote” postcards and packing. After 26 years, she and Frank moved two miles from their home to an apartment in suburban Virginia. She said it was time to make the transition rather than waiting until the bones groaned even more. She remains close enough to work with her school-age grandchildren. • Faith Brouillard Hughes considered moving closer to her family in Brooklyn. Instead they found a place closer to her on Cape Cod. Parents and grandchildren can work/learn from home, with “teacher” Faith nearby to provide the extra support. • Marilyn Santos Velayo relayed details of restricted living in the Philippines. For four months, people basically stayed home; children and senior citizens couldn’t go out even for necessities. Then things eased a bit, and again in September, but public transportation still hadn’t fully come back by October. Masks or face shields were mandatory. There was access to regular liturgical celebrations online, but celebration of one of their biggest church feast days—November 1—wasn’t allowed. Her one “benefit” was to have four months for intensive household cleaning—“now important things can be found immediately!” Additionally, she kept current, and had her own opinions, on the international (for her) news, including the pre-election happenings here in the States. Travel restrictions precluded her annual visits from her international daughters and families. Like the rest of us, Marilyn hopes that 2021 will restore circumstances of a normal (new normal?) way of life. • Meanwhile, take care; keep in touch! If you are not on my direct mailing lists for occasional extra news, let me know that too.\n\nGreetings, classmates. • So sadly, we begin with news from Florida of the sudden passing last July of Frank Dever from complications of the coronavirus. Frank was a proud Eagle as well as a devoted Red Sox fan. Our sincerest sympathy is extended to his wife, Diane, and to his children, Carolyn ’88 and Mark ’90; his grandchildren; and his extended family and friends. • Bill Fitzgerald shares further sadness: Bill Cavanagh passed away on October 17. Bill spent most of his working life first in Arizona then in southern California. He retired as a CFO/senior VP of AECOM a few years ago. He will be missed by his family and many friends. • In these challenging times, Bill Plunkert is continuing his work as a spiritual director, now through the use of Zoom or FaceTime. Though not as effective as person-to-person, his team is continuing to minister to the homeless and others, who, in material ways, are not as fortunate as most of us. Bill and his wife, Donna, live in Great Falls, Virginia, and have two children and five grandchildren. Bill reminds us that we all have so much to be grateful for. He gives a special shout-out to his soccer and baseball buddies and wishes all of us BC’68-ers the best. • Jim Boucher, of Burke, Virginia, has written a lovely poetic song lyric about a BC alumnus revisiting the Heights. His poem opens: “Walking along Linden Lane/I face that day long ago/When I saw what spring could bring/For many years to follow./First there’s gothic Gasson Hall/Where Michael guards the way/And the clock upon the tower/Measures each day.” Though space precludes my continuing, you can follow his nostalgic journey across campus by going online to our class website via the Alumni Association. • Friends, please stay well, stay safe, as we await the glorious reawakening of springtime’s promise! Go, Eagles!\n\nJo Tolksdorf Solet writes that it was wonderful to reconnect with old friends at our 50th reunion and to explore where life has taken us. She adds that we are an accomplished group who came of age just as opportunities for women were opening further. At Harvard Medical School, Jo serves as elected faculty chair of the Joint Committee on the Status of Women. She works for gender equity in science and medicine as well as researches and teaches as part of the Division of Sleep Medicine. Also, Jo contributes to community preservation efforts as a member of the Cambridge Historical Commission. Her husband, Mike, is a retired attorney who presently works with nonprofits. Her son Paul is an LA screenwriter and director. His movie Tread can be seen on Netflix. Son David is a criminal prosecutor who works on serious unsolved crimes. His two daughters, Celia and Angela, brighten each and every day for Jo. • After retirement in 2017, Julia Lopez joined several boards, including a foundation dedicated to supporting indigenous rights around the world, especially in securing and protecting lands and territories. Additionally, Julia spends time on the board of the Bay Area’s public media. Her niece, nephew, and godchildren continue to inspire Julia in their commitment to make the world a better place for all. • Betty Downes works in the behavioral health field at the state level, including with recent initiatives in clinical practice improvement. Recently she enjoyed a short visit with Marge Gaynor Palmer, who was returning to Colorado after visiting her sister in Albuquerque. • Our class has a new NBA team to cheer for because Judy Vetter’s nephew, Taylor Jenkins, is the head coach of the Memphis Grizzlies. When not in the stands, Judy can be found in the small cabin she built in East Texas around the edge of Big Bend National Park or working in her studio in a house adjacent to where she officially resides. • Tom ’68 and Pat (Mannion) Sugrue have hunkered down in Alexandria, Virginia, and at their beach house in Rehoboth, Delaware. With masks in place and practicing social distancing, the Sugrues were able to see their two daughters, Erin (of Minneapolis) and Kerry (Capitol Hill), and their five grandchildren for a gathering over the summer. • As COVID-19 is still very much a part of our lives, we continue to hope that you and your loved ones are well. Stay safe, all of you.\n\nIt was good hearing from Chuck Klemballa. Chuck is living in New York City. His three daughters, (two of whom have graduated from BC) and six grandchildren are all healthy and live close by. Chuck’s grandchildren range in age from 3 to 19. Due to COVID-19, Chuck’s retirement preference of traveling worldwide and enjoying all New York City has to offer have been basically shut down. Chuck commented on how much he enjoyed our 50th reunion last year and is already looking forward to our 55th reunion in 2024. • Jim O’Reilly’s 55th textbook, COVID-19 and Other Pandemics: Business and Legal Challenges (co-authored with Philip Hagan), has been well received. Jim serves on a committee developing uniform laws for state legislators on local and state controls of activities during the pandemic. He continues to teach his MD-MPH students at the University of Cincinnati. • Doug Carnival became a grandfather for the first time when his daughter, Leighlin Carnival Bille ’07, delivered a baby boy, Dawson, in July 2020. Doug lives in St. Paul, Minnesota. • I am sorry to report the death of Jay Sullivan, of Dover, on October 16, 2020. Jay was the former husband of Amy Kalberer, who passed away in 2004, and Norma Sullivan. He is also survived by his son, Jonathan; daughter, Kristin Boal; and grandchildren, Griffin, Annabelle, and Jack Boal and Marc and Sydney Sullivan. While at BC, Jay participated in the ROTC program, and he later served in the Vietnam War as a first lieutenant. An Eagle Scout, Jay remained committed to scouting for his entire life, serving as scoutmaster of Troop 1, Dover, and on the executive board of the Boston Council. Jay and son Jonathan worked together at Sullivan Associates, both as corporate benefits specialists. • Please take the time to email me and let me know how things are with you. Everyone, please be well and stay safe.\n\nGreetings from Ohio. I always think, “What will I write for my next column?” when I have no news, but somehow someone somewhere comes through for me. This time it was Ann Lessing Young. After my last column was printed, Ann contacted me. She loved Winnie Loving’s quote from the column, cut it out and hung it in her kitchen! Ann’s family is well, with all four of her daughters currently living in Greenwich. Her daughter Lindsay recently had a little boy, Raphael, Ann’s first grandson. He joins his big sister Simone. Congratulations! Ann’s son lives in the Hollywood Hills. Ann’s new husband, Nick, has four children and three grandchildren. They have homes in Florida and Connecticut as well as Quogue, New York, where they go in the summer. Ann also filled me in on Pat Farrell. Ann recently visited Pat at her gorgeous 18th-century barn in Water Mill in the Hamptons. Pat still has her co-op in Central Park South but due to COVID-19, she is more in residence out East. She continues her artwork, using many new art media. Pat’s son Mark is in Africa with Doctors Without Borders. Her husband, Tom, is EVP at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. • Ellie Parks Mullen also contacted me after the last column. She and Peter are happy hunkering down in Chatham on Cape Cod. • Mary “Bebee” Carroll Linder has recently become the chairperson for the Hudson Valley Writers Center. During October, the Center had a virtual gala. Bebee invited some of us to attend as her guests. Several well-known writers were in attendance that evening, including Jericho Brown, Susan Choi, Toi Derricotte, Katharine Holabird, and Leslie Jamison. Each author did readings. Live questions and answers followed and then a silent auction. Bebee has belonged to this organization for 10 years. She enjoys the intellectual stimulation. The Writers Center does workshops and readings; owns its own small press; and does a terrific outreach program, where the members teach creative writing to at-risk teenagers and to young immigrant children. Bebee says you can’t believe the fantastic talent that’s been unearthed. • In reading the last issue, I noticed that KJ McIntyre has passed away. Condolences go out to her family. • Take care, and send some news my way. Be that someone who comes somehow from somewhere for me!\n\nA few things to mention this time, so let’s get to it. • I had a great conversation with Jack Hanrahan, a retired advertising executive, who is now involved in the legal world. For the last eight years, Jack has been a volunteer and now manager of a legal and justice center in Charlottesville, Virginia, focused on counseling ACA and Medicaid recipients. He manages a number of other volunteers as well as some UVA law students. Steve and his wife, Lisa, have three grown daughters, all working in the advertising world and living in Charlottesville. • For those who remember struggling to pay rent in Brighton, you have a friend, although on the other side of the country and in a decidedly higher rent district. Lou Milkowski has been named chair of the Beverly Hills Rent Stabilization Commission. Lou, a longtime Beverly Hills resident, has for a number of years been involved in practicing tax and entertainment law, with a side interest in civic affairs. He was previously on the Traffic and Parking Commission and was a founder of the Beverly Hills Community Theater. He and his wife, Gloria, were named Beverly Hills Older Americans of the Year in 2017 in acknowledgment of their involvement and contributions in civic affairs. • It’s always good to hear from one of our nurses. I had a nice chat with Barbara Wyand Walker, who recently retired from the Greenbrier Valley Medical Center. She was awarded emeritus certification in infection control and epidemiology by the Certification Board of Infection Control and Epidemiology. Barbara has been involved in the area of infection control for over 40 years. She worked in several locations after graduating as her husband, Jay, was in the Navy. They have been in Lewisburg, West Virginia, for several years. She has two grown children, Jeremy and Stephanie, and two grandchildren. • As so often is the case in this column, I close with mention of a couple of classmates who live on only in our memories. This is especially sad as both were somewhat local, had stayed in touch with BC, and but for the curse of COVID-19 perhaps would have been with us had we gathered last June. Tom Byrne, MBA’79, of Tiverton, Rhode Island, passed away in September after a brief battle with glioblastoma. He had spent much of his career in pharmaceutical sales and the last decade with Merrill Lynch in Providence. Tom leaves his wife, Edythe DeMarco, their son, Jason, and a large extended family. Kathleen Murphy Hess passed away in July from complications related to diabetes, COVID-19, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Kathy was married to John Hess (Notre Dame ’70) and had two sons, Patrick ’00 and Kevin ’04, and two grandsons, Finnian and Dominic. Kathy spent 27 years as the coordinator of early childhood education at Triton Regional School in Byfield. • I look forward to seeing you all if we are able to gather this coming June.\n\nI hope this message finds you in good health and good spirits! Despite pandemic constraints, we’ve remained an active crew. • Katie O’Shea McGillicuddy continues teaching classes via Zoom at Harvard Institute for Learning in Retirement. Inspired by the unsolved 1990 robbery of 13 masterpieces from Boston’s Gardner Museum, she created a course, Famous Art Heists. She reports: “The research and preparation is definitely giving me something to do during the pandemic. I’ve pulled out my 50-plus-year-old Janson’s History of Art text more than once!” • Rita Houlihan helped FutureChurch celebrate 30 years of work for renewal of the church with a two-evening virtual gathering in October. The theme of the evening was “Making Sense of 2020: Being Church Today!” The event celebrated those working to create new models of lay ministry and to advance women’s full participation in the life, ministry, and governance of the Church. • Our team at Honoring the Future published two educator’s guides offering middle and high school teachers free online resources to enliven virtual classes in art, science, and many other subjects. • Liz Scannell Burke and husband Jack, MSW’75, raved about their experience at the Franklin Park Zoo’s lantern lights festival—and the dazzling displays are well worth a peek! Google “Boston Lights: A Lantern Experience.” Liz and Jack celebrated the event with their kids and grandchildren—the first time all had been together since last winter. • And catching up belatedly—my apologies!—with a bit of pre-pandemic news that we’ve not yet properly honored: Tec Manalac Jose and husband Gilbert celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary last fall—congratulations!—and hosted a party to commemorate the occasion. Tec reports: “What started as a simple dinner party for 50 (we had 30 for our 30th in Istanbul) ended up as an old-fashioned dress-up dinner dance with a live band for 80 friends and family, party favors, and lots of photos. Included were really good friends, including Lynne McCarthy, Anne McDermott, and Liz Gibbons, who came to San Francisco from Manila, LA, New York, Florida, and Mississippi the Monday before Thanksgiving. We are thankful that we could celebrate with all the trimmings before the virus invaded and kept us in our homes.” • Speaking of the holidays, best wishes to all for what I hope was a peaceful, joyful season! May we rejoice in our many blessings and continue to support each other when times get tough.\n\nIt is with great sadness that I report the passing of Robert Maguire, of Wayland, on September 1, 2019, after a brief illness. Bob loved all things BC, and he served as our class correspondent for many years. He always looked forward to reuniting with his classmates at the reunions. Bob was a friend to everyone he knew. Bob, with his joy for life, is greatly missed by his family: wife Ann, daughter Melissa Moran, son Rob, and two grandchildren. He will also be truly missed by his BC classmates. • Michael Dunn reports that after more than 50 years with C&W Services (formerly Allied Maintenance), he is retiring on December 31, 2020. Michael is looking forward to spending more time with his family, including wife Nancy ’98; son Gregory ’99; daughter-in-law Jaclyn ’99, MS’05; son Nicolas ’01, JD’08; daughter-in-law Nicole, and seven grandsons: Teddy, Jack, Frankie, Nolan, Xavier, Sammy, and Roosevelt! He relates that his life has been quite a journey and he feels truly blessed. • After 40-plus years of living in Switzerland, Martha Ritchie Swiderski has returned to America for her retirement and has been trying to track down her former apartment-mates. She has reconnected with Linda Hanrahan, Linda DeStefano, and Brian and Pam (Torrey) Hayes. She is also in contact with Carole and Jim Clancy-Hughes via telephone chats. She is now trying to locate Anne Spillane and Kathy Sullivan Connolly, MEd’72. Anne and Kathy, if you are reading this column, please email her. • Joe Collins reports that John Mashia has sold his house in Killingworth, Connecticut, where he lived for 33 years with his wife, Janet, and moved to nearby Madison to be closer to his son, Chris ’01. John also has a condo in Naples, Florida, where he looks forward to hosting his many BC friends during the winter months. • I recall a gruesome lecture on the 1918 flu pandemic during my second year of medical school. Our professor attempted to reassure us: “Don’t worry, something like this only happens every 100 years or so.” I hope that all of my classmates are safe and well during these very difficult times. I also hope that we will see some resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic before the time of our 50th reunion. I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nWell, we have to admit it! The Class of ’71 has turned 71! By the time you read this, many will be facing 72. With that in mind, what are we waiting for? It’s time to celebrate our 50th reunion. It’s been rescheduled for this coming June, and we hope many ladies will be able to participate. There may even be some activities planned virtually for other dates to accommodate various schedules and health concerns. Reliving our college days and making new memories as we celebrate is always fun. Keeping those memories alive is so important, especially as we age. Part of the plan this year is to group the classes that missed last year’s reunions with ours and the Class of 1966. That means we will celebrate with the Classes of 1965, 1966, and 1970. Eileen McIntyre provided me with information from a Zoom meeting that was held to discuss planning this reunion. Part of that discussion featured the fundraising necessary to name a room in Boston College’s McMullen Art Museum after our NCSH studio art director, (Mother) Carol Putnam. As we all age, we realize that before too long there will be no more Newton College reunions and no more laughing conversations reliving our girlhood days. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could help fellow NCSH graduates achieve this goal of honoring one of our beloved professors, who also initiated the studio art program at Boston College? By late November, you should have received mailings about our reunion and about the Carol Putnam project. • As far as the news of classmates is concerned, most of us are doing the usual family activities on a much smaller scale due to COVID-19 precautions. However, quite surprisingly, I had a newsy email from David Doran ’74, who reported that his sister, Susan Doran Gelpke, has been living in Tuscany since 1978, having moved there from Rome after graduation. Susan has a family farm, Fattoria Corsano e Paterno, famous for its cheese, oils, and wines. According to David, “Many TV foodie personalities have filmed there, including Tony Bourdain.” Susan still keeps in touch with our classmate Mary Pat McGovern, who lives in Paris. Last year they met for a visit in Naples. • In closing, let’s hope we can rally many participants in our reunion activities, even if they are virtual. • Stay well in 2021.\n\nI got more news for this column than I expected. One reason is a message I received from Tom DeSimone, who’s a semiretired developer of shopping centers and a resident of Swampscott. He and four classmate friends, along with their wives, had their annual reunion in September. The others who joined Tom and his wife, Midge, were Laurie and Mike Driscoll, Kathy and Jim Martens, Christine and Jim Breitenfeld, and Wendy and John Larivee. Mike is a musician and a retired teacher in Amesbury. Jim Martens is retired as the owner of The Bagel Mill in Peterborough, New Hampshire, and a resident of Sharon in that state. Jim Breitenfeld is a retired Nike salesman in Saratoga Springs, New York. John is retired as the former CEO of Community Resources for Justice in Boston and a resident there. • I had several other messages: one was from Br. Joe Barnett, who’s a resident of Managua, Nicaragua, where he teaches local residents the skill of beekeeping. • Another was from Judy Chamberlain Brault, of Glen Rock, New Jersey. I misstated the name of her late husband, Peter, in my previous column. • Also, I heard from Richard Mucci, MA’74, who’s retired after having been CEO of New York Life. He keeps busy with board memberships and volunteer work from his homes in Boston and Nantucket. • Also, I got some news from my “happy 70th birthday” calls. Jack Harrington, a resident of Brewster, New York, and a retired CFO, along with his wife, Cathie, went to Florida in February and to the top of Mount Washington in September. Mike Spatola, who’s retired in Hingham from his job as a fundraiser for BC Law, became a grandfather a week before that birthday. He and his wife, Patty, spend winters in South Carolina. • Brian Corrigan, of Corona del Mar, California, is still active as a senior managing director of Colliers International. His son, Connor ’12, was married in Maine in August. • John Dervan writes that he has retired after 37 years as an intervention cardiologist at SUNY Long Island. He and his wife, Nancy, live in the town of St. James. • Dan Jasinski reports from Austin, Texas, that he’s retired from his second career, that of a college instructor. His first career was as an officer in the Air Force. • My condolences to the families of the following: Frances Rega, MEd’77, who was an English teacher at Revere High School; Maria Trevisani Nelson, who taught in the Weymouth school system; and Charles Gigante, who was retired after having been CEO of New England Life Care.\n\nDuring a recent call, Shelly Noone Connolly mentioned that Dennis and Kathy (Hickey) Barrie opened a new museum. Kathy sent along this story: “[I] am happy to report that the long-awaited US Olympic & Paralympic Museum did open—and during the pandemic on July 30, 2020! Our firm, Barrie Projects, has been thrilled to be a part of this effort—from developing the feasibility study in 2013, to developing the content and finally securing the last important artifacts to be installed! Amazingly, it’s the first comprehensive US Olympic museum—which quickly became the first US Olympic and Paralympic Museum. Due to that important inclusion, we set our sights on developing the most accessible museum in the country in terms of physical interventions that would make the museum enjoyable equally to all visitors, no matter their abilities. The building, by the noted architectural firm DS+R (High Line, MoMA, Lincoln Center, etc.) is simply stunning, and located in Colorado Springs, the home of the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee. It’s highly interactive, filled with the full arc of American Olympic and Paralympic stories and achievements.” You will find more information and beautiful pictures of Kathy and Dennis’s latest project on the internet. • Ed and Lisa (Kirby) Greissing write that their daughter Kirby married Matt Conway at Georgetown University on August 8, 2020, with only 10 people allowed in the chapel. Kirby’s six brothers took turns going in. Fr. William Byrne, soon to be the new bishop of the Springfield diocese, officiated. • Congratulations to Kathy Connor, who retired from the mortgage industry last summer. • Please continue to share Newton news with our classmates, and be safe.\n\nGreetings, fellow Eagles. • A correction from Rick Palermo: “In the fall BC magazine my work information was incorrect. I spent four years as superintendent in Millbury and 14 in Lynnfield.” Thanks for setting us straight. • Robert Boova is the vice-chair of the cardiovascular surgery division at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University in Philadelphia. All four of his children are BC graduates: Bryan ’02, Chrissy ’04, Meghan ’07, and Katie ’10. Mom (Villanova ’74) is the only non-Eagle in the family. They now have four grandchildren, all boys. • A Zoom call with fellow 45 Strathmore Road and Mod roommates from the Class of 1973 was recently organized and included Jim Cusick (Tampa), Terry O’Donnell (Framingham), Don MacAloon (Detroit), Doug Goransson (Marblehead), John Lally (Atlanta), Jim Mullin (Australia), Pat Gregorius (Tampa), Brian Rothwell (Boston), and Billy Morin ’74 (Springfield). Everyone is healthy, safe, and for the most part still working, except for Don who is refining his number 8 handicap, and Jim Mullin, who lives near the oceanfront in Australia. • Raymond Keough writes: “Hello to all my classmates at BC, especially my teammates on the BC lacrosse team and my fellow future educators in the Lynch School of Education. After 33 years of teaching at Diman Regional Vocational Technical High School, I have retired as a full-time English teacher, but I am now teaching online (as most teachers) for Fitchburg State University and the Community College of Rhode Island. It keeps me busy for sure! I would love to hear from any lax players from BC or from anyone I knew from those days for that matter. Email me at rpkeough@ccri.edu. I hope everyone is doing well in these times and remembering our great times together at the Heights!” • Paul and Joan (Sennott) Boudreau have finally moved back to Massachusetts after 45 years of coaching football, 30 of them in the NFL. They enjoy spending time with their five grandkids and their goldendoodle, Dakota. They are proud parents of son Paul ’97, the special teams coordinator in Winnipeg for the CFL 2019 Grey Cup Champions, and daughter Jill. Paul Sr. enjoys staying in touch with many of his old teammates at the BC football alumni golf outings.\n\nDear classmates, the news this cycle is a little sparse—I’m sure travel has been very limited due to the pandemic. My husband and I (Kathy Dennen Morris) had to cancel several trips last spring and summer. In the near future, I’m looking forward to new adventures as well as visiting family and friends! • Kate Novak Vick reports that she was able to host a small family COVID-conscious wedding for her son, Charles, and new daughter-in-law, Clare, in September. With plenty of pre-event testing and quarantining, 20 family members and friends were able to attend. Her daughter, Sarah, flew from LA three weeks before so she would have plenty of time to quarantine before the day. Despite the pandemic and necessary precautions, the outdoor event was lovely. The weather was great and they all stayed safe and well! They are so excited to have Clare join their family. The newlyweds just moved into their new home in Randolph, New Jersey. • Randy and Mimi (Reiley) Vilord just sold the home where they have lived for more than 40 years. They are moving to a condo in Warwick, New York, which is close to their youngest daughter and her growing family. • It is with great sadness that I share news of the passing of our classmate Patty Higgins, on October 10. • Please remain vigilant and stay safe during the winter.\n\nThank you to all who submitted news. I am writing this column in mid-October and hope that when you read it, you and your loved ones are healthy and happy. I won’t miss 2020, but we have a lot of good news to share! • Bernadette (Darcy), MS’82, and John Lane are living in Cambridge and enjoying their perfect baby granddaughter, Lucy Joseph Lane, daughter of Tracy and John Lane Jr. ’09—congratulations! • Also joining the grandparents’ club are Marie and Bob McCarthy, MBA’94, with the birth of Margaret Pond Quesada. Bob has retired from banking; they live in Scituate and spend time in Pocasset. • I got a great note from Jim Sullivan, who shared news that his Mod roommate Jim Staudt, who has five sons, was blessed with a baby granddaughter in July. I hope all these new babies will keep us young! Jim Sullivan has moved to Asheville, North Carolina. He spent three years writing his first novel, Children of Galway, based on the March 18, 1990, theft of 13 paintings worth $500 million from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. The thieves were never caught. He enjoyed writing it, and I am looking forward to reading it. • Mary Westropp is very busy being the publicist for the film This Ain’t Normal. The documentary profiles gang-involved youth in Boston and the street and social workers and organizations that strive to provide help to these teens in danger. • After a brief retirement in 2018, Kerry Donovan and Juan Garcia moved to Phoenix from Pasadena. The pandemic made them realize how much they missed family, and the last note I received said that they are moving back to Boston. Welcome back! • Best wishes to John and Nancy (Rosplock) Tesoro, who celebrated their 45th wedding anniversary. They have retired; Nancy was a teacher at Red Bank Catholic High School, and John was a partner at KPMG. John serves on several boards, including the board of trustees of Catholic Charities in central New Jersey. They are grandparents to six boys and one girl and are looking forward to spending more time with them on the Jersey Shore this summer. • Diane Demartini Meyers has been a school nurse in New Jersey for 20 years; she loves her job at a school for developmentally disabled children. Thank you to her—and to all nurses, doctors, teachers, and others who have worked so tirelessly for others over the past year. • Please write.\n\nHello, classmates! As we are moving into 2021 and the future, we can look forward to our in-person reunion on campus in June. If pandemic uncertainty prevails, BC is planning a virtual experience the same weekend. Options are open, and BC will keep us updated as they have more information to share. • Michael Carty’s oldest son, Thomas, has been accepted and will enroll in Carroll College starting in the fall semester of 2021. Carroll College is a Jesuit College with about 1,400 students, located in Helena, Montana. • Walt Fey writes: “I had a great social interaction via Zoom with classmates Sue MacDonald Lomas, Connie Capro Gannon, Rosann Rubino Della Ventura, Teri Malinowski Karamourtopoulos, Margarita Gonzalez Newcomer, Maureen McGann, and Marcus Kim Bucci, all Class of ’75ers, and Anna Lynn Galardi Wheeler, who was at BC for only a year, but what an impression she made…. Most all of us date back to CLX our freshman year, moving on later to Hillside and the Mods. I know I was there at Hillside the Friday evening, I believe, when streaking became a varsity sport at BC—and I was a fan. We’re all still singing Beatles songs along with Cat, Elton, and Carole, reminiscing about those oh, so formative years. Let us all give thanks to Doug Flutie ’85; now when people ask and I tell them I graduated from BC, they are most often impressed. I am thankful most every day for my BC experience and BFFLs.” • Blake Godbout finished a jury trial on March 12, and the courts of the Commonwealth were closed soon thereafter! “Social distancing” had not yet become embedded in our day-to-day life. Blake writes: “We are very adaptable creatures and have continued to get things done, just in different ways! It has been a crossroads for many, and I am looking forward to what portends for 2021.” Blake is still very busy practicing law at his firm but did spend the summer working remotely from Nantucket. • Dennis ’74 and Nancy (O’Connor) McCleary have been amazingly busy during the pandemic. Prior to the lockdown, their oldest daughter, Zibby (Elizabeth) ’05, MSW’10, and her husband, Ed Ryan ’92, moved into the McClearys’ household with their toddler, Frances Rosemary, while home searching. The pandemic hit, and they still maintain their residence with Nancy and Dennis—and added a baby girl, Eleanor Fitzgerald, in May! The McClearys’ second daughter, Meg, a nurse director at the Brigham, delivered her first baby, Mairead McCleary Cole, so they are now the proud grandparents of three girls! If you look closely at the next home football games, you may see Nancy and Dennis in the stands as cardboard cutouts. Dennis has fun texting during the games with John Halcovich, Brian Smith, and Kevin McDonald ’76. Nancy emails/texts often with Susan Darveau Murphy, Scottie Reid Meehan, Candy Kelley McLaughlin MEd’82, Sally Hanke Lynch, and Jan Goldman O’Connor ’76. They greatly miss the fun tailgates and can’t wait to get back on campus. • Take care, and let’s continue to stay in touch.\n\nBy now you know that our 45th reunion has been rescheduled to June 2021, so please keep a lookout for details on how to participate either in person or virtually. • With our original May date still on our calendars, Lee Costello, Mary Ferris, Carol Fitzsimons, Joanne McCarthy Goggins, Jo Ann Hilliard Holland, Carol Finigan Wilson, and I connected for a Zoom reunion. Everyone was ready to “see and be seen,” with Jo Ann wearing her senior citizen football jersey and Carol Fitzsimons in a beautiful tunic from her trip to India, and a few even had their hair cut! Carol Wilson came armed with some yearbook facts from our four years, including: we were “fashion forward” and wore scarves on our heads when we “dressed up”; Schlitz was the preferred beer; our college librarian was male; we had a drama club; and she was on the yearbook committee, much to her surprise! With several months into COVID restrictions, everyone had found their way managing WFH, family responsibilities, and ever-changing travel and holiday plans, all with health and wellness at the forefront. As we talked about quarantine cooking and eating, Mary shared a great place for BBQ ribs and Southern comfort food in Boston, Darryl’s Corner Bar & Kitchen! Joanne had spoken with Mary Stevens McDermott, who was staying well and busy on the Cape, and Lee heard from Helen Fox-O’Brien. Our collective takeaway after a wonderful time together was that we continue to marvel that our friendships from Newton are everlasting and deep and know no bounds. • It was so nice hearing from Barbara Trayers Athy, who was very pleased to report that the Worcester Art Museum has reopened for visitors. She writes: “WAM has been an important part of my life as I’ve been able to take studio and art history classes there and have served on several committees. Our annual Flora in Winter event will take place both virtually and in person at the end of February. It’s an exciting four-day celebration of art and flora, and this will be the fifth year that I’ve been lucky enough to be one of the arrangers interpreting a piece from the WAM collection. See the museum website for more details, and perhaps I’ll find some familiar Newton faces in the galleries!” • I look forward to hearing your news in 2021!\n\nDespite these uncertain times, our class reunion is scheduled for June 2021. Veteran committee members have been in contact, and discussions are ongoing with the Alumni Association representatives. Kenny Brine, Virginia Champagne, Paul True, Judith Cox Marley, Steve and Christine Healey McManama, and Gerry Shea are eager to get to work, but obviously we are in wait-and-see mode for the foreseeable future. Let’s hope and pray for the best! • Michael Gee has enjoyed a fine career in corporate America and has written for Harvard Business Review. He wrote “A Nationwide Conversation around Reparations” (July 24, 2020) and “Why Aren’t Black Employees Getting More White-Collar Jobs” (February 28, 2018). Check out hbr.org. Mike resides in Washington, D.C. • Recently celebrating 42 years of marriage were Bern and Debbie (Doyle) Caniff. They have three grown children and three grandsons. They lived for many years in Lynnfield, but in 2014 they pursued their dream of living on the coast and moved to Swampscott. They have enjoyed many travel adventures and hope to resume when the pandemic recedes. • Andrea and Mike “Zeeto” Ianzito reside in Atlanta, where Mike is communications director for Ashton Woods Homes. Their twin daughters departed for college, making them empty nesters. • A denizen of Barrington, Illinois, Brian Casey celebrated 43 years of marriage to Mary (Loker) ’78. They were blessed with two daughters and a son and now are delighted by two grandchildren, a boy and a girl. • Another Midwesterner, Katherine Rybak, resides in Evansville, Indiana. This proud Hoosier worked for Indiana Legal Services for over 40 years and retired last May. She provided civil legal services to low-income and elderly clients. She looks forward to when she can once again visit and care for her grandchildren in England. • Lawrence and Doris (Pholeric) Gruel, MEd’77, of Kingsville, Maryland, recently celebrated 40 years of marriage. After 44 years of teaching special education, Doris retired last July and plans to spend lots of time with four grandkids who live in Florida. • Please stay safe and sound, and keep in touch. God bless!\n\nBack on February 2, before the beginning of the pandemic, Jim McCurdy, of Andover, and some of his old BC friends (not in age but in length of time, right Jim?) got together in Boston. Mary Ellen Degnan ’78, Larry Feather MEd’78, Ed Reardon, and Jim met near the ICA and chatted away while walking the six-mile Harborwalk. They ended the day with a nice dinner at Provisions State Street restaurant near the Aquarium. Jim enjoyed spending a great day with friends, catching up on family life, getting outside, and reminiscing about their youthful days at BC. Back in the day, they all worked at a Newton Saturday camp (at Westwood’s Hale Reservation), as part of Professor John Dacey’s ed psych class. They all have fond memories of the kids, the student counselors, and the staff. Mary Ellen, Ed, Larry, and Jim all retired recently and look forward to new chapters in their lives. Jim sends special thanks to Larry for making the drive up from Pine Brook, New Jersey, for the weekend, and to Mary Ellen for flying in from Columbia, Missouri! • Cheryl Carleton’s youngest daughter, Carolyn Asher, is a senior at BC. Although the restrictions brought forth by the pandemic have made it more difficult to move back on campus, it was a great trip down memory lane for Cheryl when she moved Carolyn into the Mods this past August. Cheryl lived in the Mods in her junior year at BC as well. She and Carolyn had a great time in autumn 2019, when they attended a football game tailgate party! She was very surprised by the extent to which the BC campus has changed! Cheryl has three other daughters and has been an economics professor at Villanova University for the past 35 years. • Peninnah Cooper Kanzi, of Atlanta, notes that the pandemic has been a very challenging and unusual situation for many. As an undergraduate in 1975, she decided to change her “healthy lifestyle” to a “more healthy” one and has maintained it ever since. She writes: “That single decision made over 46 years ago has literally saved my life through many challenging life situations.” She is grateful to have made it safely through the pandemic so far and adds: “There is hope, with faith and the will to do what the body, mind, and spirit need to do in order to protect oneself.” • Jackie Gonzalez, of Dripping Springs, Texas, has written a book about CEOs’ impact on company culture and the importance of culture in trying to unite people of disparate opinions around common goals. For more information about her book, titled “Creating Culture: Why Some Organizations Thrive While Others Survive,” visit j29associates.com/books. A portion of all proceeds go to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. • Linda Schiller McKelligan retired and moved from Massachusetts to Pawleys Island, South Carolina, in January 2017. After 40 years in the educational field, she retired from Walpole Public Schools as director of student services.\n\nGreetings to all during these strange and different times. The law of averages suggests that some of you may have been affected (and/or infected?) with COVID-19. I, myself, was tested twice (negative) and sadly my BC roommate/Mod-mate, Donna Jones ’77, died from what is thought to have been complications of COVID. I pray by the time this issue is in your hands that the virus is finally more under control than not. • Now on to more pleasant news—although with a slight COVID slant: George Ravanis was excited to announce in October that he was celebrating the re-opening of his restaurant, Frank’s Steak House, in Cambridge. “COVID closed us, but we are back!” he wrote. George is celebrating ownership of 46 years of New England’s longest-running steak house. The eatery has been named a Phantom Gourmet favorite (Phantom is a food-related TV program featuring profiles of New England–area restaurants), and the steak house has also appeared on the Food Network. George sends a shout-out to his BC golf partners, Greg Gailius ’77, Greg Stewart ’80, Joe Carter ’80, Fr. Kevin MacDonald, Jim Conroy, Bob Meara ’79, Steve Craft ’80, Dave Cullinane ’80, and Tim Dachos ’79. “Great guys, great friends, great ballplayers, okay golfers.” His words, not mine! • Speaking of words, Terrence Crimmins, MAT’05, reports that his third novel, Ghetto Teacher, based on his 10 years of teaching history in Baltimore City Public Schools, is coming out in early 2022, and will look into the “terrible problems in urban education that seriously need to be addressed,” he said. Congratulations, Terrence! • Once again—and I feel like a broken record here—please send in any updates, professional or personal news, retirement plans, trips taken, etc. Inquiring minds really do want to know. Thank you!\n\nIt’s our 40th reunion year! Mark your calendars to participate the first weekend in June! Our Reunion Committee, chaired by Rich Canning and Meg McGrory Kelleher, is planning Reunion Weekend and events leading up to it, so be sure to watch your inbox for details! • John Stack recently retired from American Express in New York City as senior VP and looks forward to life’s next chapter. • After a three-year stint with the Buffalo Bills and a long career in the real estate business in the Boston area, Mark Roopenian is managing director of DivcoWest Real Estate Investments, where he is developing Cambridge Crossing, a 45-acre, mixed-use commercial and residential project, the largest project in the history of Cambridge. Mark is married to his BC sweetheart, Kirsten Nicholson, and they have three children and one amazing little grandson! • From Lakeville, William McGurk reports that his sons are both launched successfully into the world and will go further than he did! Alex (Connecticut College ’17) is transferring from the University of Rochester to Cornell University to continue his PhD studies in immunology. Colin (College of the Holy Cross ’19) commissioned into the US Navy on graduation, completed Navy Nuclear Power School, and joins our submarine fleet this winter. • Congratulations to Brian Murphy, who is an editor on the foreign desk at the Washington Post and part of the team that won the Pulitzer Prize in 2020 for explanatory journalism for a series of stories on climate change hot spots around the world. He has also published his fourth book, Adrift: A True Story of Tragedy on the Icy Atlantic and the One Who Lived to Tell About It (DeCapo, 2018), recounting the story of an 1856 shipwreck and its sole survivor. • Bob Shea recently moved to the law firm of Beck Reed Riden in Boston, where he is a partner practicing labor and employment law. • Brac’s and my first grandson, Cryder Thomas Stanwick (another prospect for BC’s Class of 2042!), was born on March 14, 2020, the same day the Baltimore Sun’s headline screamed “National Emergency!” He has certainly been a bright spot in an otherwise tough year. I am about to wind up my term as the 132nd president of the Virginia Bar Association, the oldest and largest voluntary bar association in Virginia. It has been a year of dealing with governor’s orders, emergency legislation, and crisis management, but serving has been the highlight of my professional career (although I must admit I’m just a tad glad it’s over!). • See you in June!\n\nFrom Mike O’Neil: “I am very sad to report that we lost our dear friend, classmate, roommate, BC Eagle hockey teammate and brother, Bob ‘Okie’ O’Connor, to melanoma on August 21, 2020. He was 59. Okie was a world-class goalie and NHL draft pick—and a better husband to wife Carolyn and their three first-round picks, Ian, Kyle, and Brice. He leaves behind ‘Okie’s Angels’ (the life partners of his sons): Blaine, Sam, and LeighAnn, along with grandsons Declan and Keegan O’Connor. ‘The Cat,’ as we called him, will be forever missed but never forgotten.” • Gina Bough Sisti’s daughter Christina graduated in 2020 from Tulane University, where she played for the women’s tennis team. She is now an analyst for Ernst & Young at their Hoboken office. Gina’s son, Andrew, graduated in 2018 from Bowdoin, where he played football as the kicker, and entered NYU College of Dentistry in July. Gina is a licensed real estate broker for Houlihan Lawrence, Scarsdale office, and lives in Westchester with her husband. She went to Petra and the Holy Land last summer and reports it was her favorite trip ever! She looks forward to turning 60 and to our 40th BC reunion! • Christine Raines retired from a 35-plus-year, very successful career on Wall Street, the past 14 years as a managing director, and recently started a position at Ability Beyond as a life skills coach for cognitively impaired adults. She was a volunteer at Rosary Hill Home, a Catholic cancer hospice in Hawthorne, New York—founded by Rose Hawthorne, daughter of American novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne—until the coronavirus shut out volunteers. • In August, John and Caryn (Bollhofer) Wolak celebrated the marriage of their daughter, Julia ’16, a Connell School of Nursing alumna, to Matthew Munfakh ’16. The immediate families of the bride and groom were present for an intimate wedding ceremony in Charleston, South Carolina. John and Caryn have three children and reside in New Jersey. Julia and Matthew have settled in Chicago. • Thomas Egger is now in his 29th year at Emergency Physicians Professional Association in Minneapolis. He writes it is quiet at home with his three sons far afield: Thomas Jr. (27), a USMC grad, is a captain in the US Marine Corps and a former infantry officer with recent deployment to the South Pacific; Andrew (24), a Colby College alumnus with a major in physics and also a Marine, is now a first lieutenant in jet fighter school for F-18 and F-35 aircraft; and Matthew (19) is a sophomore studying international relations and Chinese at Durham University in the UK. Thomas remains busy with work as well as doing home repair, assisting an elderly mother, and training for Nordic ski racing and triathlons. While his work as an ER physician has isolated him from friends and family due to his frequent exposure to COVID patients, he has managed so far to stay healthy!\n\nGreetings! • Greg Swenson is a partner with Brigg Macadam in London. His firm arranges private capital investment in emerging and frontier markets in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. He is also a commentator on CNN International, BBC News, and other media. • John Di Masi is both excited and proud that his son, John “Jack” Di Masi, is in the Class of ’23 at BC’s Carroll School of Management. It gives John and his family another reason to visit the Heights. • After retirement from Verizon as a central office tech in communications, Barbara Lyons worked four years for St. Catherine’s in Norwood. She is now with the Norwood Public Schools as a special needs bus monitor, a job she loves. • Mark Caola had dinner in the North End with his daughter Sarah, Class of ’22, and fellow Eagles Karen (Ellinghaus) ’85 and Frank Carpenito and Mike Larkin.

As a leadership development consultant, coach, and workshop facilitator, Ann-Marie is fulfilling her lifelong passion for learning and career vision in thought leadership. She is excited to see where the program leads in her research and practical implications. • With sadness, I report that on January 22, 2020, our classmate Stephen Mingolla ended his long battle with MS/ALS. He had a long career at Pleasant Valley Country Club in Sutton and served as the PGA Tournament co-director from 1985 to 1995. He accomplished many challenging goals throughout life, including completing the 2004 Boston Marathon. He supported many charities. Stephen leaves his wife, Melissa, and children Stephen, Matthew, Isabelle, Michelle, and Christopher. In Stephen’s last days, a smile came to his face while reminiscing with classmates John Miller, Mark Perron, and Michael Goodberlet.\n\nHi, ’86 Eagles! I hope everyone is staying safe and happy during these crazy pandemic times and finding ways to connect to your family and friends—makes you really appreciate all the fun times and freedoms we have had, especially in our BC days. Thanks to everyone who wrote in with news to share with our ’86 classmates, and please keep the emails coming—I love hearing from everyone! • Unfortunately, Stephen Flatley wrote in with sad news that his sister Laura Flatley Lacey ’84 passed away on July 26, 2020.

Thanks, Jim, and hope you can come to the 35th reunion and see your Cushing pals in person. • Greg Rowe and his wife, Emily, became first-time grandparents with the birth of Jackson James Duval to their daughter in Cincinnati.

She and her husband, Tom, raised their daughters, Lindsey and Lydia, in Boston, and, she writes, it was a complete adventure.

After a corporate career in sales and operations, Carolyn launched her home and office organizing business, Carolyn Loucas Professional Organizer, five years ago. She adds: “First person to be recognized at our 25th reunion? My husband, Tom, by Jerry Frost, on the steps of McElroy.” • Physician Claudia Morris received an $8.7 million grant at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta for research on a drug for sickle cell pain. • Wendy Horton Lash writes: “After waiting 32 years, I finally received my master of science degree in interdisciplinary studies/K–8 math specialist from Virginia Commonwealth University in July 2019.

Donna writes: “The theme of the intergenerational discussion between students and the college’s advisory board members was Gwen Ifill’s legacy today. It was a lively discussion about the racial justice issues and the lack of women, especially women of color, in journalism.” • Carol Palmer Winig was on a social-distance roll, joining Patti Carroll Schipelliti and birthday girls Moira Clancy Riccio and Ann Kulevich Kane in the North End for outdoor dining. • Kim Johnston-Brooks spent months walking the halls of Congress knocking on doors, testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, was part of a documentary soon to be in theaters, wrote articles, joined the board of the Stronghold Freedom Foundation, and contacted hundreds of members of Congress and Senators in an effort to pass legislation and raise awareness for 10,100 American service men and women who were exposed to toxic contaminants and radiation in service to our nation after 9/11.

It is for Tim and the other families that she advocates—for their recognition for their service to our nation. I encourage you to read about it at strongholdfreedomfoundation.org. • David and Sue (Connolly) DeGeorge planned a return to the Heights with others to see their children graduate.

Of note, Tara is the third Coffey child to graduate from BC, and Alex could be spotted on the field each weekend with the Screaming Eagles Marching Band, leading the drums section. • I’ll close with a heart- and dinner-warming story. Heather Guerriero Dans, a senior sales manager at Monogram Appliances, and Alan Stern, MA’88, of George Washington Toma appliance company, worked together to assist Kathleen Rock Snow ’87 in fully replacing a Monogram range after she had been waiting more than eight weeks for back-ordered parts.

I hope you are all doing well and managing life in our new normal. While it was disappointing to not have our 30th reunion, there is hope for 2021! • We send thoughts and prayers to the family of Donna Morrissey, a longtime American Red Cross executive, who passed away in May from COVID-19.

All three children are away at school, and John misses the times when braces and Catholic school tuition were their chief expenses! They are hoping the family greyhound, Alice, can cope. • Charlie Wagner has stayed in the Boston area since graduation and currently lives in Medfield. He had a busy and exciting last year, his first as EVP and CFO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a leading biotech company with four medicines approved for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. In 2020, Charlie and wife Susie celebrated their 25th anniversary. Their daughter Molly is at Holy Cross, having returned from a semester in Melbourne, Australia.
