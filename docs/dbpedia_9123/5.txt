The History of Beijing as a Capital

Beijing was called 'Jin City' in the Western Zhou Dynasty era (1047â771 BC), when it was a regional capital. In medieval times, Beijing was again a capital during the reigns of five of the most recent dynasties: the Liao (916â1125), Jin (1115â1234), Yuan (1279â1368), Ming (1368â1644), and Qing (1644â1912).

The world-famous Forbidden City was built in Beijing in 1420, when the Ming dynasty moved its capital from Nanjing. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the capital of China was again moved to Nanjing as civil war broke out. After the People's Republic of China was founded on October 1st, 1949, Beijing was named as the new capital of China. Read more on Beijing History.
