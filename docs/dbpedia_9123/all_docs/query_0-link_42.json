        "text": "Beijing is the capital of the (People’s Republic of China) China. It is the country’s political centre, cultural centre, international communication centre and centre of scientific and technological innovation. Beijing is the world’s most populous national capital, with more than 21 million residents in an administrative area of 16,410.5 km2 (6,336 sq mi).\n\nHowever, its built-up area, the third largest in China after Guangzhou and Shanghai, is slightly larger, encompassing three districts in Hebei (Sanhe, Dachanghui and Zhuzhou) but still the Myun and Pinggu districts in Beijing are not collected.\n\nIt is located in northern China and is governed as a municipality with 16 urban, suburban and rural districts under the direct administration of the State Council. Beijing is mostly surrounded by Hebei Province, except for the neighbouring country of Tianjin to the southeast. Together, the three divisions form Jinjinji Megalopolis and the National Capital Region of China.\n\nName:\n\nOver the past 3,000 years, the city of Beijing has had many other names. The name Beijing, meaning “northern capital” (the Chinese characters 北 for north and 京 for capital), was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming Dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing (“southern capital”). had gone.\n\nThe English spelling Beijing is the government’s official romanization of these two characters adopted in the 1980s because they are pronounced in standard Mandarin. An Old English spelling, Peking, was used by the Jesuit missionary Martino Martini in a famous atlas published in Amsterdam in 1655.\n\nAlthough Peking is no longer the common name of the city, some of the city’s old landmarks and facilities, such as Beijing Capital International Airport, with the IATA code PEK, and Peking University, still retain their former romance."
