        "text": "As the country's capital city, Beijing is the political and cultural center of the People's Republic of China. As such, Beijing has a long history as the center of political and economic power and many headquarters of the largest Chinese companies are located in the city. A major part of the economy belongs to the service sector, with financial services and information technology exerting growing influence. Together with surrounding Hebei province and Tianjin municipality, Beijing forms the Jing-Jin-Ji metropolitan cluster in Northern China.\n\nDemographic and economic development\n\nBeijing is one of four municipalities in China, which are directly administered by the central government. Over the last decades, the city has attracted many migrant workers from rural areas which have contributed to population growth and in 2015 the population of the administrative area of the city had reached nearly 21.9 million. In 2017, the government announced plans to keep the urban population below 23 million by 2020, and it is likely that this target will continue to be a priority in the future. Recent population figures reflect these political objectives. The number of inhabitants living in the urban area of the city, not including distant suburbs und the surrounding countryside, was estimated to range at around 21.8 million in 2023.\n\nBeijing has the second largest GDP of all cities in China. The share of the service sector in the city's GDP reached more than 80 percent in recent years, which is very high compared to other cities and provinces in the country. Important industries within the service sector include financial services, information technology, and scientific research and technical services, which together accounted for almost half of Beijing’s GDP and displayed the highest sector growth rates in the years not affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The city is a center of research and education and home to several leading Chinese universities.\n\nThe Jing-Jin-Ji metropolitan cluster\n\nThe municipal government has recently taken measures to adjust Beijing's development within the regional Jing-Jin-Ji metropolitan cluster. This is in order to overcome what is termed “big city disease”: congested infrastructure and high levels of pollution. In accordance with the new Beijing urban master plan released in 2017, certain non-essential industries and administrative units have been relocated to designated areas east and south of the city. The plan opens up new opportunities for urban development but will also need careful execution to successfully integrate less developed regions into the urban infrastructure."
