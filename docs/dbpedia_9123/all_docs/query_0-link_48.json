Here are 10 interesting facts you should know if you're already planning your trip to Beijing, or if you're just starting to think about it.\n\nChinese: åäº¬ BÄijÄ«ng /bay-jing/ 'North Capital'\n\n1. Beijing is one of the oldest cities in the world.\n\nThe Forbidden City is one of the most important historical attractions in Beijing.\n\nBeijing's history can be traced back 3,000 years. It's about as old as London, six times older than New York, and ten times older than Sydney. The city retains a wealth of historical sites, such as the Great Wall and the Forbidden City.\n\nBeijing is also one of the oldest inhabited areas in the world. Fossils indicate that Peking Man (Homo erectus) lived there from 770,000 to 230,000 years ago. The Peking Man World Heritage Site at Zhoukoudian is the place to see the fossils.\n\n2. Beijing is a 6-times capital city.\n\nThe Tian'anmen Square\n\nBeijing has been the capital to six notable Chinese governments. China has been ruled from Beijing for over 700 years, which is why there are so many historical sites to explore.\n\n221 BC: Yan State Capital, Warring States Period\n\n1271: first a national capital for the Yuan Dynasty\n\n1402: Became Ming Dynasty (1368â1644) capital\n\n1644: Qing Dynasty capital\n\n1912: Republic of China capital\n\nOctober 1, 1949: The people's Republic of China inaugurated by Mao Zedong\n\nRecommended Tours:\n\n4-Day Beijing Private Tour\n\nBeijing Traditional Food Tour\n\n3.

Their magnificent and well-preserved architecture was constructed hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe Great Wall is one of the greatest sights in the world - the longest wall in the world, an awe-inspiring feat of ancient defensive architecture.\n\nThe Forbidden City is the largest palace in the world.
