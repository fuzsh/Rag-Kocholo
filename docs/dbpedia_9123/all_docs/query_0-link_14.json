Discover the top 10 facts about Beijing right here!\n\nBeijing is one of the world’s oldest cities\n\nAs an inhabited city, Beijing has over 3,000 years of history and is one of the oldest in the world! The city is six times older than New York.\n\nThe historical artifacts around Beijing are ancient: the Great Wall was built in the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BCE). Today it is just to the north of the city. Scientists have determined ancient human species (Homo erectus) lived in the area where Beijing is today around 770,000 to 230,000 years ago.\n\nRead More: 10 Chinese Dynasties You Should Know\n\nBeijing is arranged in rings\n\nWith the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square at the very center, Beijing has expanded in “rings” outward over the decades. Each “ring” is marked by a big circular road that goes around the whole city. The concept originated with Beijing tram lines that ran from the 1920s to the 1950s, where a tram that looped from Tiananmen to Gulou was called the “Ring Road” route. In Beijing, you will often hear people give directions by referencing the ring roads: “It’s out in the fifth ring,” or “I live in the third ring.”\n\nBeijing currently has 7 ring roads. Even Beijing’s metro lines follow the ring pattern:\n\nBeijing pronunciation became standard Mandarin\n\nWhy is Beijing known as the best place to learn Mandarin Chinese? It’s because the style of Chinese spoken in the capital over time became the standard dialect for all of China.\n\nAccording to the Chinese Language Institute, “in 1932, a dictionary of a common language based on northern prestige dialects from in and around Beijing emerged. This dictionary was called Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use (国音常用字汇 Guóyīn Chángyòng Zìhuì). Eventually, its contents would become the foundation for modern Putonghua.” (Putonghua=Modern Mandarin).\n\n…But, Beijing still has its own unique dialect!\n\nIf you learn Chinese in Beijing, you might realize that many speakers will add an “er” sound to the end of words (儿 in Chinese). But in other places, like Shanghai and Taiwan, Chinese speakers might not understand you if you speak this way. The “er” sound is a central feature of Beijing dialect, and can make every word sound a bit different:\n\n不知道 buzhidao (I don’t know) sounds like burdao\n\n一点点 yidiandian (a little bit) sounds like yidiar\n\n老师 laoshi (teacher) sounds like laoer\n\nA Beijing dialect speaker interviewed by the New York Times said, “I love to listen to the Beijing dialect…It is something innate. When I speak the Beijing dialect, it comes naturally from my heart.”\n\nBeijing was the capital 6 times\n\nThis is one of the best trivia facts about Beijing.

In the past, this was definitely true. Coal accounted for 40% of pollution in Beijing due to factories on the edge of the city and neighboring provinces producing power generation, steel, and cement. But Beijing declared a “War on Pollution” in 2014, and the results are excellent! 2021 was the best year on record for Beijing clear skies since 2013, with CGTN reporting “The number of severely polluted days during summer and autumn was eight days, dropping by 86.2 percent compared to 2012.”\n\nNow that the pollution has improved significantly, Beijingers have switched to complaining about traffic instead.
