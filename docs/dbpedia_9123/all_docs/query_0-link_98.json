        "text": "Circled by a series of ring roads, dotted with iconic and monumental architecture and criss-crossed by major arteries, Beijing represents one of the world’s most rapidly growing consumer markets. With a population of about 21 million, an increasing number of whom are well-educated members of the consumer class, Beijing is a hotbed of economic activity. Beijing’s economy is driven in large part by services, including tourism, government, education and media.\n\nDemand for logistics and distribution services in Beijing is fueled in part by the city’s rapidly growing e-commerce industry, which reaches the peaks of skyscrapers and crowded historic alleyways. Beijing is a hub for land and air transportation and home to a large number of warehouses. Beijing Capital Airport, which handled nearly 90 million passengers in 2015, is the world’s second-busiest airport.\n\nPrologis owns available warehouses in Beijing and operates industrial warehouse properties throughout the Beijing area."
