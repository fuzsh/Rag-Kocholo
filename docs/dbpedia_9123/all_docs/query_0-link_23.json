        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBeijing (formerly transliterated \"Peking\") literally means Northern Capital, a role it has played many times in China's long history. Beijing's history dates back several thousand years but it first became notable in Chinese history after it was made the capital of the State of Yan under the name Yanjing. Yan was one of the major kingdoms of the Warring States Period, some 2,000 years ago. After the fall of Yan, during the later Han and Tang dynasties, the Beijing-area was a major prefecture of northern China.\n\nIn 938, Beijing was conquered by the Khitans and declared the capital of the Liao Dynasty. The Mongols seized the city in 1215. From 1264 Beijing served as the capital of a united China under Kublai Khan. His victorious Mongol forces renamed the city, Great Capital (大都). From there, Kublai and his descendants ruled their empire from a northern location closer to the Mongol homelands. During this period, the walled city was enlarged and many palaces and temples were built.\n\nAfter the fall of the Mongol-founded Yuan dynasty in 1368, the capital was initially moved to Nanjing. However, in 1403 the 3rd Ming emperor, Zhu Di, also known as Emperor Yongle, moved it back to Beijing and gave the city its present name. The Ming period was Beijing's golden era. The Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven and many other Beijing landmarks were built in this period. The capital developed into a huge city becoming the religious and cultural center of Asia.\n\nIn 1644, the Ming Dynasty was overthrown by the rebel leader Li Zicheng, though his rule would be short lived as he was quickly overthrown by the Manchus, who established China's last imperial line - the Qing. Despite the changing political climate, Beijing remained the capital. The Manchu imperial family moved into the Forbidden City and remained there until 1911. The Qing built both the Summer Palace and Old Summer Palace. These served as summer retreats for the emperors and their entourages. During the 19th century, Western countries established foreign legations in the Qianmen area south of the Forbidden City. These came under siege during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900.\n\nThe Qing dynasty fell in 1911 and was replaced by the Republic of China, with Sun Yat-sen as its first president. In the chaotic first years of Republican China, Beijing was beset by fighting warlords. Following the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang moved the capital to Nanjing in 1928, and renamed Beijing as Beiping (北平, literally \"Northern Peace\") to emphasize that it was no longer a capital. Beijing remained a center for education and culture throughout the Republican Era. When the Kuomintang was defeated by the Communists in 1949, the new government proclaimed a People's Republic with its capital at Beijing.\n\nOrientation\n\n[edit]\n\nBeijing is a vast city, spanning 16,800 km² and divided into 16 districts, with significant distances between them. The city is bordered by Hebei province to the north, west, and south, and by Tianjin to the east. Beijing is a central part of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) regional development strategy, launched in 2014, which aims to create a mega region with enhanced connectivity. High-speed rail now allows travelers to reach Tianjin from Beijing in just 30 minutes, and the newly developed Xiong'an New Area in Hebei in 20 minutes. Xiong'an is envisioned as a techno and eco-utopia, designed to relieve some of Beijing's non-capital functions.\n\nThe city used to be almost entirely made up of hutongs with narrow lanes and single story buildings. Now, many of the hutongs have given way to broad boulevards and modern buildings, contributing to an airy, sprawling feel, in sharp contrast to cities like Hong Kong and Shanghai. Beijing is the political centre of the country, with official buildings and embassy areas dominating the city and many historical buildings and sites especially within the 2nd Ring Road.\n\nPeople\n\n[edit]\n\nBeijingers take great pride in being citizens of the capital, given the city's historical, cultural, and political significance. This pride is sometimes described as 大北京主义 or \"Great Beijing-ism,\" reflecting their distinct attitude toward people from other regions of China. Compared to people elsewhere in the country, Beijingers are often more interested in politics and more willing to discuss current events. They also tend to be mindful of maintaining face and frequently use humor to navigate social situations. Despite this, many Chinese from other provinces find Beijingers to be friendly and straightforward, especially when compared to people from Shanghai. The city has undergone a remarkable transformation, evolving from a fast-growing, developing metropolis with occasional horse-drawn wagons on city streets in the 2000s, into an affluent, middle-class society marked by rampant consumerism and trendy hangout spots by the 2020s.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nBeijing has a monsoon-influenced continental climate with hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. The best time to visit is in September and October, during the \"Golden Autumn\" (金秋). Spring is the season for dust storms and is otherwise warm and dry. Summer can be oppressively hot and the tourist crowds tend to be the largest as well. Winter is cold and dry, with infrequent, but beautiful, snow. Temperatures can easily fall below −10 °C in winter and or just as readily rise above 35 °C in summer as well.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2022, Beijing's permanent resident population stood at 21.84 million, with a registered population of 14.28 million. This difference is largely due to the difficulty many residents face in obtaining hukou, the household registration that grants access to better education and welfare services in the city. Beijing has been actively managing its population growth. The city has seen a continued decline in birth rates among its permanent residents in line with a wider national trend.\n\nRead\n\n[edit]\n\nExplore books by foreigners who have experienced life in Beijing. This tradition started as early as the 13th century with the Travels of Marco Polo, where he gives an account of the layout of the city and its people during the time of Kublai Khan.\n\nIn the 1990s, two Peace Corps volunteers went on to write books about Beijing. The Last Days of Old Beijing: Life in the Vanishing Backstreets of a City Transformed by Michael Meyer (2008) offers an account of life in one of Beijing's remaining hutong neighborhoods, blending personal experiences with the city's modern architectural history. Peter Hessler, a writer for the New Yorker in Beijing during the 2000s, wrote Oracle Bones (2006), exploring the lives of ordinary people in China while documenting the country's transformation.\n\nFor a historical perspective, Peking Picnic by Ann Bridge, a bestseller from the 1930s, provides a glimpse into the city and expat life through the eyes of a British diplomat's wife. Other significant works include Sir Harold Acton’s Peonies and Ponies (1941), Sir Reginald Fleming Johnston’s Twilight in the Forbidden City (1934), and Juliet Bredon’s Peking - A Historical and Intimate Description of Its Chief Places of Interest (1922), written by an Englishwoman who grew up and lived in Beijing until 1924.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nBeijing has a world-class public transportation network, with an extensive subway system that gets you to most of the major tourist attractions. Frequent buses and dockless shared bicycles outside of stations complement the subway system. Most people use ride-hailing apps like DiDi (https://www.didiglobal.com/) through the DiDi miniapp within Alipay, the payment app of choice for visitors, to call taxis.\n\nThough some residents of Beijing know conversational English (especially in tourist areas or Haidian District's university cluster), do not count on finding a taxi driver or passerby who knows English well. Neither should foreigners with minimal experience with the Chinese language put faith in their ability to pronounce Chinese place names correctly. Before embarking on a trip around the city, it is best to print out the names of places you want to visit in Chinese characters or get your hotel front desk staff to write them out for you. When going to specific addresses, writing nearby intersections or basic directions can be helpful as well. Show the text to the taxi driver or just ask for help on the street. In general, you will have a better chance of getting help in English if you address younger people.\n\nCrossing the road in Beijing may be challenging for pedestrians unused to the local driving styles. Before crossing, assume that none of the road users will yield to you, even if a policeman is present. Zebra crossings are often ignored. Chinese drivers frequently use their horns and may play games of chicken with pedestrians and other vehicles. Should you hear a loud horn when crossing the road, always look around as there is probably a car right behind you or heading straight for you. If you find several cars and bicycles veering towards you from different directions, do not try to run to safety; instead, stand still. For drivers and cyclists, a stationary obstacle is easier to avoid. Traffic light crossings have zebra stripes painted on the road, but you should only cross when the walk light is green. When a mass of people crosses together, cars are more likely to stop or slow down.\n\nBy subway\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: Ticket machines at certain subway stations such as Tian’anmen East require a Chinese ID (or Foreigner's Permanent Resident ID Card) as part of the payment process. Unless you're a long-term resident in China possessing the latter, you cannot use the ticket machines at those stations and must go to a manned counter to buy your ticket. These exist in all stations, but not are not necessarily staffed at all entrances/exits. Alternatively, you may use a smartphone app (i.e. Yìtōngxíng, Chinese only) to buy your ticket. (Information last updated 14 Jul 2024)\n\nThe Beijing Subway is a good way to quickly get around the city and is clearly marked in English for travelers, with announcements being bilingual in Mandarin and English. It is clean, fast and efficient. The network has expanded at a furious pace, with 22 lines now operational and more being built. Unlike most giant cities' subways, it has a grid-like network which is refreshingly easy to navigate. The subway system shuts down around 22:30, and opens again around 05:00, with signage at the entrance to each station.\n\nSubway entrances are marked by a large blue \"G\" around a smaller \"B.\" Single tickets cost ¥3 to ¥10, with the Capital Airport Express at ¥25 and the Daxing Airport Express between ¥10 and ¥35. Tickets are valid only on the day of purchase and from the issuing station. Machines provide English instructions and give change in coins for ¥10 or ¥20 bills. Keep your ticket for entry and exit.\n\nFrequent travelers should use a Beijing Transportation Card. Tap the card at turnstiles for entry and exit. Refunds are available at select stations like Xizhimen and Haidianhuangzhuang.\n\nBags must pass through X-ray checks, and dangerous liquids may be confiscated. You might need to drink a little water in front of security to prove it’s safe.\n\nFor ticket or turnstile issues, ask station staff for help. Fare dodging is illegal and punishable by fines or arrest. Smoking is prohibited in trains and stations.\n\nRush hours are very crowded, especially on lines 1, 4, 10, and 13. Avoid these times if possible, and be cautious of pickpockets during the rush for seats.\n\nLines are listed below. Transfers between lines are permitted with the exception of the two Airport Express lines, for which a separate ticket is required.\n\n1 runs east–west from Sihui East to Pingguoyuan crossing the political heart of the city along Chang'an street, passing the Forbidden City, Tian'anmen Square and Wangfujing. From 29 August 2021, through service started between 1 and 1 , providing direct connection between the downtown and the Universal Resort.\n\n2 is the inner loop line following the old city walls. The first and last trains start/end at Xizhimen and the line serves Lama Temple and Beijing Railway Station.\n\n4 runs north–south on the west side of the city and serves the Old and New Summer Palaces, Beijing University and Beijing South Station.\n\n5 runs north–south on the east side of the city.\n\n6 runs west–east through the city center, serving Nanluoguxiang, Chaoyangmen, Changying and the municipal administration center in Tongzhou.\n\n7 runs west–east on the south side of the city, ending at the newly built Universal Resort in Tongzhou.\n\n8 runs north–south near the center of the city from Zhuxinzhuang (Changping) to Yinghai (Daxing), serving Huilongguan, the Olympic Stadium, Drum Tower, Nanluoguxiang, Wangfujing, Qianmen and Yongdingmen.\n\n9 serves Fengtai district, including Beijing West Railway Station.\n\n10 is the outer loop line that circles around the entire city.\n\n11 is only in a small portion, connecting Jin'anqiao (start of Line 6) and Shougang Park which is converted from a former steel factory.\n\n13 is an elevated line serving the northern suburbs. The line starts at Xizhimen and ends at Dongzhimen and passes through Wudaokou.\n\n14 passes through Chaoyang District and then turns west through to the southern suburbs.\n\n15 runs across the north and north-east suburbs of the city.\n\n16 serves the northwest of Haidian District, which is home to several hills including Jiufeng and Baiwangshan, and ends at Yuyuantan Park East Gate in downtown Beijing (near Diaoyutai State Guesthouse and Yuyuantan Park).\n\nruns diagonal on the southeast suburbs, linking Shilihe and Yizhuang New Town.\n\n19 is a rapid line on the west side of the city, from Mudanyuan to Xingong via Jishuitan, Niujie and Caoqiao.\n\nS1 (also called the maglev line) and 1 , Changping , 4 , Fangshan and Yizhuang connect the outer suburbs to the city and are of little use for tourists.\n\nXijiao is a tram line which runs from Bagou station on line 10, passing various tourist attractions like The Summer Palace, to Xiangshan (Frargrant Hills).\n\nruns from Dongzhimen, the northeast corner of the 2nd ring road to Capital Airport via Sanyuanqiao.\n\nruns from Caoqiao to Daxing Airport.\n\nBy bicycle\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Cycling in China\n\nOnce known as a nation of bicycles, China saw private cars dominate the roads from the 1990s until the 2010s. However, the arrival of several dockless ridesharing bike companies, each with a distinctive color, has transformed Beijing back into a city of bikes. These bikes are now crowded everywhere and waiting at every subway station exit. The infrastructure from Beijing's days as the capital of the \"Bicycle Kingdom\" makes exploring the city by bike excellent. The city is flat, and all major streets have bike lanes. Bicycling is often faster than traveling by car, taxi, or bus due to traffic congestion in the motorized lanes.\n\nFour-wheeled motorized traffic in Beijing usually observes traffic signals with the exception of making turns at red lights which is often done without slowing or deferring to pedestrians or bicyclists. Pedestrians, bicycles and all other vehicles (for example, motorized bicycles, mopeds and tricycles) generally do not observe traffic signals. Also, cars, trucks and buses do not defer to cyclists on the road so it is common for a vehicle to make a right turn from an inside lane across a bike lane with no concern for cyclists traveling in the bike lane. Sometimes a right-turning vehicle crossing a bike lane will sound its horn as a warning, but not always. Cyclists also need to be on the lookout for wrong-way traffic in the bike lanes, usually bicycles and tricycles but sometimes motor vehicles, too. Wrong-way traffic usually stays close to the curb so you move to the left to get by them, but not always. Bicycling Beijingers tend not to wear helmets, nor do they use lights at night. Few bikes even have rear reflectors. The moderate pace and sheer numbers of bicyclists in Beijing appear to make bike travel safer than it would be otherwise.\n\nWhile you will see cyclists use many creative paths across wide, busy intersections in Beijing, the safest way for cyclists is to observe the traffic signals (there are often special signals for cyclists) and to make left turns in two steps as a pedestrian would. But if you spend any significant amount of time cycling in Beijing, you will probably start adopting more creative approaches. These can be learned by finding a local cyclist going your way and following him or her across the intersection.\n\nSeveral professional bike rental companies, as well as major hotels and some hostels, rent bikes on an hourly basis. For those who need the security of a guide, a bike touring company like Baja Bikes Beijing would be a great way to go.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nBeijing's bus system can be particularly useful for short trips, especially when your origin or destination is not within walking distance of a subway stop. Quite often, subway stations can be more than 1 km from where you want to go, and it takes time to navigate the subway system, including getting in and out of stations. Additionally, taking the bus allows you to see the city while traveling, rather than just a subway tunnel.\n\nMoreover, buses are a great option if you are on a tight budget. While typical subway fares range from ¥3-7, bus fares are distance based but start at ¥2, with a 50% discount if you use the Beijing Transportation Card instead of cash. When using the card make sure to touch in and out on most bus lines to ensure the correct fare is calculated. Notices above the doors will indicate whether you need to swipe your card when getting off.\n\nBuses in Beijing are equipped with air-conditioning, heating in winter, TVs, scrolling screens that display stops in Chinese (and often English), and broadcast systems that announce stops in both Chinese and English. However, bus staff speak little English, and bus stop signs are in Chinese. For assistance, you can call the English-speaking operators at the Beijing Public Transport Customer Helpline (96166). Beijing buses can get very crowded, so be vigilant about your valuables.\n\nBus Routes\n\n[edit]\n\nBus lines are numbered from 1–999. Buses under 300 serve the city center, while those 300 and above connect the city center with distant areas. Buses in the 800s and 900s link Beijing with its outer suburbs. Special lines, express services, and night buses have specific prefixes or numbering.\n\nDirections can be obtained on AutoNavi Maps, Baidu Maps, or Mapbar. Most maps are in Chinese, but AutoNavi Maps are available in foreign languages in Apple Maps or Google Maps. Apple Maps users can also access the 'live bus' feature in Transit mode.\n\nMost buses with a line number under 200 run daily from 05:00-23:00. Buses numbered 300 and above typically run from 06:00-22:00. Night buses usually operate from 23:20-04:50. Routes can be very crowded during rush hours (06:30-09:00 and 17:00-21:00). On major holidays, most city routes have more frequent service.\n\nTour lines and direct express lines have special fare systems.\n\nBy minibus\n\n[edit]\n\nMinibuses are very common in the countryside outside the urban areas. Privately operated, most trips cost less than ¥10 per short journey and only a little more for longer journeys.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficial taxis in Beijing are reliable and relatively inexpensive. If you don't speak Mandarin, it's advisable to have the Chinese characters for your destination ready in advance. Most people use ride-hailing apps like DiDi, accessible through the DiDi miniapp within Alipay, the preferred payment app for visitors, to call both official taxis and ridesharing services. You will likely only need to get into an official taxi directly from the airport or railway station taxi lines. While ridesharing taxis are available at these busy locations, it is often easier to wait in line for an official taxi due to the hectic nature of finding a ridesharing vehicle.\n\nFares and meters\n\n[edit]\n\nIf the taxi driver \"forgets\" to switch the taxi meter on, remind him by politely asking them to run the meter and gesturing at the meter box (请打表 qǐng dǎbiǎo), though most can understand \"meter please\", and all can understand a simple point at the meter. At the end, it is a good idea to ask for a receipt (发票 fā piào) also while gesturing to the meter and making a writing motion. Having a receipt is handy in case you want to make a complaint later or for business reimbursement purposes, and since the receipt has the cab number, you stand a greater chance of getting your possessions back if you forget anything in the taxi.\n\nIf you want a tour around Beijing and its vicinities, you can ask your hotel to hire a cab for one day or several days. It usually costs ¥400-600 per day, depending on where you go. You can also ask just about any driver to perform this service as most are more than willing to do so. If you have Chinese-speaking assistance, then bargain down the cost. No matter the cost, the taxi is yours for the day and will wait for you at various destinations.\n\nCommunicating with the drivers can be a problem, as most do not speak English. Many will not even pick up foreign passengers on the street due to the perceived language barrier. The solution should that happen is to go into a nearby hotel and ask the desk staff to call a cab.\n\nYou can ask that your hotel write your destination on a card to give to the driver. Make sure to take the hotel's card (and a map) that lists the hotel's address in Chinese. This can be a 'get out of jail free' card if you get lost and need to get back via taxi. A regular city map with streets and sights in Chinese will also help.\n\nAvoiding scams and fakes\n\n[edit]\n\nTo avoid being taken advantage of, it is a good idea to know the rough direction, cost, and distance of your destination. If the cab goes in the wrong direction for a long distance, verify the location with the taxi driver. For scamming drivers, that is usually enough for them to go back on the right track (without ever acknowledging that they were trying to cheat you). Honest drivers will explain why they are going that way. In addition, sometimes a cab driver might tell you an extravagant price to get somewhere and tell you the meter is broken.\n\nDishonest drivers may attempt to hand back counterfeit bills as change. When receiving large bills like ¥50 or ¥100, check the paper quality, watermark, and the imprint's clarity to ensure they're genuine. If a bill seems suspect, it's acceptable to refuse it and ask for another. Sometimes, taxi drivers may claim that your genuine bill is fake and discreetly swap it with a counterfeit one. Always keep an eye on your money, especially when handling larger denominations. To minimize your chances of being scammed, use a ride hailing app like DiDi to call a taxi.\n\nThere are several \"makeshift taxis\" running around Beijing including a seat fixed up to the back of an electric scooter. These guys will scam you big time if you don't negotiate a clear fare beforehand. Upon arriving your destination, for a 2-minute ride, the driver will demand ¥300 and will be very belligerent if you don't pay it.\n\nUnofficial cabs hang out around tourist sights like the Great Wall and the Summer Palace. Pirate cabs will charge you a higher fee for the journey, unless you are a good bargainer, know where you are going, and know what the right fare should be.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Driving in China\n\nDriving in Beijing can be quite complicated with seemingly perpetual traffic jams. Many hotels rent cars that come with drivers for up to ¥1,000 per day. Public transport or taxis will get you to most of the main tourist sites and therefore renting a car is not often required at all.\n\nShort visa holders (less than 3 months) can get a provisional driver's license at Beijing Capital International Airport or the transportation police stations in the city within minutes. You need to provide your passport as well as your foreign driver's license and do a small examination to confirm you don't have a physical or visual disability that affects driving. With a provisional license you can legally drive cars in China. Ask any information desk at the airport for directions.\n\nYou can find the counters of many car rental companies in the arrival hall of Terminal 2 in Beijing Capital Airport, although English is not usually spoken.\n\nCcar rental companies serving the Beijing Capital Airport include:\n\nChina Auto Rental, Tel: +86 400 616 6666\n\nAvis also operates a car-rental service in Beijing\n\nThe daily rate of smaller, economical cars is about ¥200-300. You need to deposit around ¥3000 (possible by using CUP/VISA/MasterCard credit card).\n\n20% of cars have to be off city centre roads on weekdays — you are affected on different days depending on the last digit of your number plate. These alternate every 13 weeks. The police have a right to fine you repeatedly if you are caught on the road when you should have left your car at home. If travelling to Tianjin by car, remember they operate the same system in tandem with Beijing's road rationing schedules. On weekends no such limits apply in either cities, which may give rise to worse jams during peak travel hours.\n\nVehicles without a licence registered in Beijing are subject to severe restrictions in the capital — most need a special permit to enter the part of town inside the 6th Ring Road, and for those which are granted this licence, it must be renewed nearly every week. You must have your passport / Chinese ID, driving licence and vehicle licence (\"blue book\", not larger registration certificate) with you at all times, especially when leaving or entering Beijing, as you will be checked by the police.\n\nBy suburban railway\n\n[edit]\n\nBeijing has a suburban railway system, though it's not the typical way for tourists to get around. For the S2, S5, or S9 lines, arrive early to avoid crowds and secure a good seat. The S2 line features a first-class car, a dining car with large windows, and standard class cars. You can't book tickets in advance for the S2 line, so purchase them at the station or use the \"Yitongxing\" mobile app for other lines. The gate closes 5 minutes before departure, so be prompt. Long-distance trains to places like Huangcun and Miyun are available but may not be as convenient as buses.\n\nThe lines are as follows:\n\nBCR Sub-Central from Liangxiang railway station (in Fangshan) to Qiaozhuang East railway station (in Tongzhou). All trains call at Beijing West Railway Station, Beijing Railway Station and Beijing East Station. Not so many trains serve the line, but it can be a wise way to travel through the center of the city, especially during peak hours when the roads are too busy, buses and the metro are crowded, but the trains are quite \"empty\" except the section from Liangxiang to Beijing West.\n\nBCR S2 from Huangtudian station (near Huoying subway station on lines 8 and 13) to Yanqing, is a good choice if you are going to the northern suburbs, especially during morning and evening rush hours when the freeway is extremely crowded. All trains call at Badaling station where you can take a free shuttle bus to Badaling Great Wall. Some trains also stop at Nankou station between Badaling and Huangtudian. A train extends the service to Kangzhuang or Shacheng on Mondays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Fares are ¥5 for one station and ¥6 for more than one on the main line, and ¥16 from Huangtudian to Kangzhuang or Shacheng. This is the only suburban railway line that a standard Beijing Transportation Card can be used and your card should at least have a balance of ¥16. This line was described by the Chinese media as \"The most beautiful commuting routine\" and attracts many visitors. Trains from the city during evening rush or to the city in morning rush may be really crowded.\n\nBCR Huaimi (also known as S5), from Beijing North station to Gubeikou in the northeastern suburbs, reaches Huairou town and Changping North station. All trains call at Changping North Railway Station. However, there are only two \"pairs\" of trains to/from Gubeikou per day, one pair in the morning and one in the afternoon. Another four \"pairs\" of trains are available between Beijing North and Huairou North. Fares are ¥9 to Huairou North and ¥12 to Gubeikou.\n\nBCR Tongmi starts at Tongzhou West railway station, and has two branches. One to Miyun North railway station, which has only one pair of train: inbound (from Miyun) in the morning and outbound (to Miyun) in the evening. The other branch to Huairou North railway station with only one outbound train in the morning and only one inbound in the afternoon. Maximum fares are all ¥8.\n\nS9 line from Beijing East Station to Jizhou which is in Tianjin. It uses the name of Beijing Suburban Railway, but is operated by National Rail long-distance trains. A journey takes 40 minutes and is cheaper than buses. However services are very limited.\n\nBeijing Transportation Card\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Beijing Transportation Card, commonly known as the Yikatong card, is a convenient way to pay for public transport in Beijing. The card can be obtained at subway stations in physical form or mobile version. When acquiring a physical card, a deposit of ¥20 is required. You can charge the card at subway stations, transit hubs, or service centers. It is worth noting that visitors with non-Chinese phone numbers have reported difficulties in getting the mini-app for the card to work within the Alipay payment app.\n\nThe card can be used mainly for:\n\nAll buses operated by Beijing Public Transport, Bafangda buses, and Yvntong bus lines, with a 50% discount on fares.\n\nAll subway lines, including the Xijiao tram line.\n\nSuburban railway line S2.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Beijing's district articles\n\nGreat Wall\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Great Wall of China (长城 Chángchéng) is the must-see on any trip to Beijing and a destination worth visiting multiple times due to its vastness and the variety of views, landscapes, and hikes it offers. The Wall is located about an hour by train or 1½ hours by bus from the city (be aware of bus scams, as mentioned in the \"Stay Safe\" section below). For general information on the Great Wall, see Great Wall, and for details on specific sections, refer to Northeastern Beijing, Yanqing District, Huairou District, and Northern Suburbs.\n\nThe Badaling section is the most famous but also heavily restored and crowded. For a more enjoyable tourist experience, Mutianyu is recommended over Badaling; it offers similar restoration but with fewer crowds. Closer to the city center, about 60 km away in Changping District, is Juyongguan Pass, a well-known section of the Great Wall located in a deep gorge of the Taihang Mountains north of Beijing.\n\nFor those seeking less crowded areas, Jinshanling and Huanghuacheng are more challenging to reach by public transportation but offer stunning views of the wall away from the crowds. The distant Simatai section in the northeast can be combined with a night visit or an overnight stay at Gubei Watertown, a recreated historical village beside the wall.\n\nLandmarks\n\n[edit]\n\nThe heart of Beijing is defined by the Central Axis, a historic landmark that runs from north to south through the city's core. This axis is home to numerous significant sites that illustrate the evolution of Beijing from its origins during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), when the city, then known as Dadu, became the capital. The Central Axis was further developed during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and refined in the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912). The urban pattern, roads, and design of this area showcase the ideal capital city as prescribed in an ancient text known as the Book of Diverse Crafts. In 2024, the Central Axis was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the title \"Beijing Central Axis: A Building Ensemble Exhibiting the Ideal Order of the Chinese Capital.\"\n\nAt the core of the Central Axis is Tiananmen Square, situated in Dongcheng District. As the world's largest public square, it is a must-see destination for visitors from around the globe. The square is surrounded by iconic buildings, including the Great Hall of the People, the Museum of Chinese History, the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, and the Forbidden City. Tiananmen Square also houses the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall and the Monument to the People's Martyrs.\n\nIn the Gulou neighborhood, you'll find at the north end the Drum and Bell Towers, which are remarkable remnants from the medieval city and contribute to Beijing's rich historical narrative. To the south the axis also features Qianmen in Dongcheng District, a last vestige of the city's walls.\n\nIn contrast to the historical landmarks of the Central Axis, Chaoyang District offers contemporary symbols of modern Beijing. The National Stadium (commonly known as the Bird's Nest) stands as an enduring symbol of the 2008 Olympic Games. Nearby, the striking CCTV Headquarters has become an icon of contemporary Beijing, surrounded by the city's skyline, which includes supertall structures like the China World Trade Center Tower 3, Tower 3B, and the China Zun.\n\nPalaces, temples and parks\n\n[edit]\n\nBeijing offers numerous green oases, providing a welcome respite from the city's bustling boulevards and narrow hutongs. These green spaces are popular among locals for relaxation, sports, dancing, singing, and general recreation.\n\nThe most significant palace is the Forbidden City (故宫博物院), which served as the Imperial Court during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Remarkably, it remained largely untouched during the Cultural Revolution thanks to Premier Zhou Enlai's intervention.\n\nDongcheng District is filled iconic sites. There is the Temple of Heaven (天坛), a symbol of Beijing, surrounded by a lively park where locals engage in tea drinking, calligraphy, tai-chi, and people-watching. Nanluoguxiang (南锣鼓巷), a historic lane from the Yuan Dynasty, stretching 786 meters long and 8 meters wide, part of the protected hutong areas of Beijing. Additionally, the Yonghegong (Lama Temple) (雍和宫), one of China's most important and beautiful temples, and the nearby Confucius Temple (孔庙).\n\nIn Xicheng District, notable parks include Zhongshan Park (中山公园) and Beihai Park (北海公园). Chaoyang District boasts Chaoyang Park (朝阳公园) and Ritan Park (日坛公园). The Beijing Zoo (北京动物园) in Xicheng District is renowned for its traditional landscaping and giant pandas, although the conditions for the animals have faced criticism.\n\nHaidian District offers attractions such as the Summer Palace (颐和园), the ruins of the Old Summer Palace (圆明园), Fragrant Hills (香山), and the Beijing Botanical Garden (北京植物园). All these sites are close to each other and worth visiting.\n\nMuseums and galleries\n\n[edit]\n\nThe museums in Beijing are generally not yet up to the standard seen in cities such as Paris, Rome, New York or even Taipei. However the city contains one of the largest and most well known museums in Asia, the Palace Museum also known as the Forbidden City. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. China's government is determined to change the backward perception of its museums and has invested heavily in their development. It has also made most of them (not the Forbidden City) free to visit. However, for some museums, tickets must be reserved three days in advance.\n\nOne of the most well-known museums in Beijing is the National Museum (国家博物馆) in Dongcheng District, which was renovated in 2011. The Military Museum (军事博物馆) in Haidian District has long been a favorite with domestic and foreign tourists. The Capital Museum (首都博物馆) in Xicheng District is a new high-profile museum with historical and art exhibitions. The China Aviation Museum (中国民航博物馆) located in the Beijing/Northern Suburbs is surprisingly good and hosts 200+ rare and unique Chinese (mostly Russian) aircraft. Finally, a number of restored former residences of famous Beijingers, especially in Xicheng District, give a good insight into daily life in former times.\n\nThe contemporary art scene in Beijing is thriving, with numerous artists showcasing and selling their work in galleries throughout the city. The most established and easily accessible area is the 798 Art District in Chaoyang District anchored by the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art. This district has a commerical atmosphere of mainstream galleries and luxury billboards dotting the area. Other notable art districts include the Caochangdi Art District in Chaoyang District and the Songzhuang Art Community in Tongzhou District. Yanjiao, outside of Beijing, is home to studios of young artists who had sought lower rents in Hebei province.\n\nHutongs\n\n[edit]\n\nBeijing's hutongs, its ancient alleyways, offer a glimpse into traditional Beijing architecture dating back to the Yuan dynasty (1266-1368). The buildings in these hutongs are typically constructed in the traditional courtyard (四合院 sìhéyuàn) style. Originally, many of these courtyard homes were occupied by aristocrats, but after the Communist takeover in 1949, they were displaced and poorer families moved in. Today, hutongs can still be found throughout the area within the 2nd Ring Road, though many are being demolished to make way for new buildings and wider roads. The hutongs near Qianmen and Houhai are particularly popular among tourists. While the narrow alleyways may seem intimidating to travelers accustomed to Beijing's modern wide streets, the locals are friendly and often willing to help if you look lost.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Beijing's district articles\n\nBeijing provides an ideal opportunity to sample food from all over the country. Some of Beijing's best restaurants serve food from Sichuan, Hunan, Guangzhou, Tibet, Yunnan, Xinjiang, and more.\n\nRestaurant areas\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the most famous streets for food in Beijing is undoubtedly Guijie (簋街/鬼街). This vibrant street, located in the Dongcheng District, is a true food paradise, featuring a wide array of excellent cuisines. Stretching over a kilometer, Guijie is home to more than 150 eateries, with about 90% of the commercial spaces dedicated to dining.\n\nAs a global city, Beijing also boasts a variety of international restaurants. However, for a unique dining experience, head to Shenlu Jie, a street north of Ritan Park, a neighborhood of Cyrillic signs, in the Chaoyang District. This street is lined with restaurants offering Central and West Asian cuisines, and even includes a Russian grocery store. One standout spot is Kavkaz, run by an entrepreneur from Azerbaijan, which serves dishes from across the former Soviet Union and has the best sheesha in Beijing.\n\nPeking duck\n\n[edit]\n\nPeking duck (北京烤鸭 Bĕijīng kăoyā) is a famous Beijing speciality served at many restaurants, but there are quite a few restaurants dedicated to the art of roasting the perfect duck. Peking duck is served with thin pancakes, plum sauce (甜面酱 tiánmiàn jiàng), and slivers of scallions and cucumbers. You dip the duck in the sauce and roll it up in the pancake with a few slivers of scallions and/or cucumbers. The end result is a mouthwatering combination of the cool crunchiness of the cucumber, the sharpness of the scallions, and the rich flavours of the duck.The two best known restaurants are Dadong or Quanjude.\n\nOther specialties\n\n[edit]\n\nBeijing is also known for its mutton hotpot (涮羊肉 shuàn yáng ròu), which originally came from the Manchu people and emphasizes mutton over other meats. Like variations of hotpot (general name 火锅 huŏ guō) from elsewhere in China and Japan, hotpot is a cook-it-yourself affair in a steaming pot in the center of the table. Unlike Sichuan hotpot, mutton hotpot features a savory, non-spicy broth. If that's not exciting enough for you, you can also request a spicy broth (one that is flaming red, filled with peppers, and not for the weak!) To play it safe and satisfy everyone, you can request a yuan-yang (鸳鸯 yuānyáng) pot divided down the middle, with spicy broth on one side and regular broth on the other. Raw ingredients are purchased by the plate, including other types of meat and seafood, vegetables, mushrooms, noodles, and tofu, so it's also perfectly possible to have vegetarian hotpot. A dipping sauce, usually sesame, is served as well; you can add chilis, garlic, cilantro, etc., to customize your own sauce. While \"raw\" sounds dangerous, boiling the meat yourself is the best way to ensure that more risky meats like pork are fully cooked and free of germs. In the city center, hotpot can run as much as ¥40-50 per person, but on the outskirts it can be found for as little as ¥10-25. Low-budget types may reuse the spices or cooking broth from previous guests, although it has been boiling for several hours.\n\nFor those who have a sweet tooth or enjoys snacks, Beijing is a city with a lot more choices. Traditional snacks like \"Lvdagun\" (驴打滚 means \"Donkey rolling in the muddle\", made from rice and red beans) \"Wandouhuang\" (豌豆黄 means the yellow peas, made from yellow peas, soft) \"Fulingbing\" (茯苓饼 means poria cocos pancake or a fuling pancake, usually made from a mixture of the herbal plant and flour and stuffings) and so many other kinds.\n\nStreet food\n\n[edit]\n\nSome of the cheapest and most delicious meals can be had on the streets. For a tourist street food experience, start at Wangfujing has a \"snack street\" selling such mundane fare like lamb, chicken, and beef as well as multiple styles of noodle dishes, such as Sichuan style rice noodles, but the brave can also sample silkworm, scorpion, and various organs all skewered on a stick and grilled to order.\n\nSavory pancakes (煎饼果子 Jiānbĭng guŏzi) are one of the most popular street snacks, eaten from morning till night with most carts operating during the morning commute and then opening again at night for the after-club crowds and night-owls. This delicious pancake is cooked with an egg on a griddle, a fried dough crisp is added, and the whole thing is drizzled in scallions and a savory sauce. Hot sauce is optional. Diehard fans often go on a quest for the best cart in the city. Lamb kebabs (羊肉串儿 yángròu chuànr) and other kebabs are grilled on makeshift stands all around Beijing, from the late afternoon to late at night. A winter speciality, candied haw berries (冰糖葫芦 bīngtáng húlu) are dipped in molten sugar which is left to harden in the cold and sold on a stick. You can also find variations with oranges, grapes, strawberries, and bananas, or dipped in crumbled peanuts as well as sugar. This sweet snack can also sometimes be found in the spring and the summer, but the haw berries are often from last season's crop.\n\nVegetarians\n\n[edit]\n\nBeijing is not known for vegetarian fare, though there are vegetarian restaurants scattered across the city catering to devout Buddhists. The most renowned vegetarian restaurant is King's Joy (京兆尹), a fine dining experience of vegetarian dishes made with green, seasonal produce sourced from local organic farms. The restaurant is located at Wudaoying Hutong in the Dongcheng District. A budget veggie option with rave reviews is the 廷香小馆 (Lotus Restaurant), which is located in a hard to find building south of Sanlitun in Chaoyang District.\n\nDrink\n\n[edit]\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Beijing's district articles\n\nTea, tea, and more tea! Some shops are in malls and others are stand-alone establishments. Whatever their location, always ask the price before ordering or else brace yourself for the most expensive egg-sized cup of tea in the world. You can experience different styles of tea ceremonies and tea tastings at tea houses especially in the Qianmen area south of Tiananmen Square. These can range widely in quality and price. Some tea houses are really tourist traps whose main goal is to milk you of your money (See warning box). You can get a free tea demonstration at most Tenrenfu tea houses which are located throughout the city and at some malls. A private room or a quiet back table in a tea house with mid-range tea for two should cost ¥100-200. After an afternoon in such shops the remaining tea is yours to take home. Once tea is ordered, the table is yours for as long as you like.\n\nExcellent coffee can be found in independent cafés scattered throughout the city. A prime spot for coffee enthusiasts is Wudaoying Hutong in Dongcheng District, a narrow alley lined with small cafés that are serious about their brews. For those seeking a scenic coffee experience, the hutongs surrounding the Miaoying Temple in Xicheng District offer several cafés with terraces. These spots provide magnificent views of a towering 13th-century pagoda designed by a Nepalese architect, making them ideal for a picturesque coffee break.\n\nThe quintessential Chinese hard liquor is baijiu (白酒 báijiǔ), a distilled grain spirit typically made from sorghum. While there are many affordable brands, Maotai (茅台 Máotái) stands out as the national liquor and is the most revered, with prices starting from ¥1500. Erguotou (二锅头 Èrguōtóu), another local variety, is notably potent (40-60% alcohol) and is often sold in gallon jugs at prices comparable to water—caution is advised to avoid confusion. Another high-end option is Wuliangye (五粮液), priced around ¥1000, which may appeal to those new to baijiu due to its milder flavor.\n\nPopular Chinese beers in Beijing include Tsingtao (青岛 Qīngdǎo) and Yanjing (燕京 Yànjīng), the latter being Beijing's local brew with a dominant presence. For craft beer enthusiasts, Great Leap Brewing (大跃) is a notable microbrewery with a hard to find location in the hutongs around Gulou.\n\nPlaces to drink\n\n[edit]\n\nMost of Beijing's bars are located in one of the bar clusters around the city. In the beginning there was only one was Sanlitun, but many areas have emerged.\n\nSanlitun in Chaoyang District historically and presently the centre of nightlife in Beijing.\n\nWorkers Stadium in Chaoyang District and adjacent to Sanlitun; clubs line the east side of the stadium complex.\n\nNanluoguxiang and surrounding hutongs in Dongcheng District located in the middle of the hutongs in the Gulou neighborhood, east of the Drum and Bell Towers; finding hard to locate bars in a maze of hutong alleys is one of the unique pleasures of nightlife in Beijing.\n\nHouhai in Xicheng District is a bar area located on Houhai Lake, west of the Bell and Drum Towers; once thriving but popularity has faded since the 2000s.\n\nWest Gate of Chaoyang Park in Chaoyang District is a small bar area.\n\nLadies' Street in Chaoyang District is a small bar area near the third embassy area.\n\nWudaokou in Haidian District is the hangout spot for foreign and local university students; the bar street is anchored by a 7-11 where drinkers mill about outside.\n\nDashanzi in Chaoyang District, Beijing's trendy art zone; this old warehouse and factory district has been taken over by art galleries, art shops and bars."
