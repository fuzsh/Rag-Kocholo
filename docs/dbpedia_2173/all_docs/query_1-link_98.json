        "text": "Do you really think shooting is a practical option in a built-up area? Shooting is already an option in England for Lesser Black-backed gulls, which can be the main urban gull species in some areas.\n\nIt seems to me that the tools are already there for people to deal with urban gulls if they want to (egg removal, netting/spikes for buildings, improved refuse handling).\n\nI agree with your drift here--shooting in urban areas would be impractical. I live close to the Sussex Downs and see swarms in the fields and following tractors. I mentioned earlier about a partridge shoot going on in those same fields. Shooters were lined up with what appeared to be 12 guage shotguns and the birds were being dropped with relative ease. Firing into a huge swarm of gulls would be effective in the same way.\n\nEvery article I have read all agree that the other methods of control have proven to be ineffective as the gull population continues to rise. London is a good example as huge sums of money have been invested yet the number of pairs has increased from a few hundred to 20,000 in (IIRC) about 5 - 7 years (see my PDF for the relevant article--it is the RSPB's data).\n\nThe problem is, I believe, the lack of predators and the possible change in behaviour that goes along with increased numbers. Hawks are now seen as useless because large numbers of gulls simply mob them and chase them off. A herring gull will even attack a bald eagle in flight as it knows no fear:\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/iknownowforsure/7207267156/\n\nhttp://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle...-tough-enough-to-take-on-peel-gulls-1-1785239\n\nhttp://www.picasuk.com/lethal_bird_control.html#lnk4\n\nFlying a bird of prey is now being commonly offered as a means of deterring roof-nesting gulls and yet birds of prey are even less effective at scaring gulls than they are at scaring pigeons! Gulls will never be deterred by raptors during the breeding period and at any other time of the year the threat is equally benign. In fact gulls will commonly mob birds of prey and chase them away so once this is understood it becomes clear that no matter which species is used, and to what extent, it is far more likely that the gull represents a greater threat to the raptor than the reverse. Even so, councils like Bath and North East Somerset Council spend huge sums of taxpayer’s money attempting to scare roof-nesting gulls with commercial hawk handlers to no effect at all.\n\nThe gull appears to be a predator that kn ows no predators. What can keep its population in check? Allow a plague to happen and hope for bird flu? IMHO we need an urgent study to kn ow what we are dealing with.\n\nGullplague (thats a rather leading username?),\n\nEverything you post above is about Herring Gulls being a nuscience to the public, not then being a threat to biodiversity as per the title of the thread. Can you outline any cases where the presence of Herring Gulls (urban or coastal) has had a marked and prolonged impression on the local ecosystem. Now if you were looking at Canada Geese instead .....\n\nhttp://www.birdforum.net/showthread.php?t=218323\n\nIf you look at my PDF under the heading threats to other species there is a sampling of examples of showing gull predation threatening to place other species on the endangered list. The most recent example is the gull attacks on whales off Argentina--the experts admit that this is causing an upset to the bio-sphere as the whales are changing habits and breeding grounds. The cause is thought to be a gull population explosion causing them to become more creative in their choice of sustenance.\n\nI am hoping that all of these articles are demonstrating that we do have a problem and that Freddy\"Alfred\" Hitchcock's iconic film \"The Birds\" may have been prophetic. But what was ommitted in that film was predation vs. other species. THe question arises--are gulls becoming more aggressive as numbers increase and does this account for the growing numbers of attacks against humans?\n\nAttachments\n\nHerring (and similar) Gull threat to health and safety and bio-diversity, revised 28 September, 2012\n\nApologies; I hadn't realised you were a Hollywood insider, although I am aware that I am a pleb.\n\nAre you now saying that all Larus gulls should be subject to some sort of controls? And what about Sparrowhawks, harriers, Peregrines? They can all be \"brutal\" if you want to ascribe human characteristics to wild animals.\n\nDavid\n\nThe \"Freddy\" thing was a bit TIC as it seems to be making the rounds at the moment with Cameron's attempt to be more plebian with his \"Dave\" moniker! There is an ancient Benny Hill sketch on \"hollywood insiders\" where the use of familiar abbreviations are mocked--not sure how this all relates but I suppose a little light relief can help defuse things.\n\nThe \"brutal\" word came from the other thread on this forum, presumably by a keen gull watcher.\n\nI am not sure that there is a population explosion in other species such that they are a threat to bio-diversity and humans. There are so many articles all pointing to a problem with gull numbers and my issue is that DEFRA and RSPB have been relying on dated material to inform the public that the HG is declining in numbers.\n\nMy agenda is simple: force DEFRA to commission a study so that we know what we are dealing with and to determine if all of the local government health officers, health authorities, Peter Rock et. al., RSPB as to Severn Estuary and London--the 2 areas they admit are seeing a huge increase in HGs--are right in seeing massive increases in HG (and similar) in every large city, coastal and inland.\n\nIt is a worldwide trend and I cannot believ the UK is unique in seeing a decline--especially when the RSPB themselves admit to 2 large increases in areas where their knowledge has been challenged (by PR and London Councils).\n\nThis appears to be a similar argument that DEFRA used with Buzzards ie they are at ther top of the food chain so only Man can control their numbers but this could be said for any number of species. How about a study on pike gobbling up all the ickle fish?\n\nSome have highlighted the HG (and similar) as a threat to bio-diversity by reason of sheer weight of numbers and migration into territory where gulls have not been present before. A new and sudden invasion takes place and it seems the balance is going to shift somewhere and given the gull's predatory prowess the majority of species are going to come off the worse. This is particularly true in Italy in the predation of swifts, and in Greece where the Meditteranean gull is now endagered due to the larger gulls (\n\nhttp://www.greek-islands-travel.co.uk/greek-lifestyle/hard-times-for-greek-island-seagulls.html\n\nRival populations of the Yellow-legged Gull has also had an impact after their population surged to approximately 200,000 breeding pairs.\n\nhttp://www.springerlink.com/content/n226q58637118846/?MUD=MP \" Is the yellow-legged gull a superabundantbird species in the Mediterranean? Impacton fauna and flora, conservation measuresand research priorities.\"\n\nDespite the relatively limited number of both intensive and general studies, it clearly appears that the population explosion has had a very diverse and severe effect on the ecosystem as a whole (flora, vertebrates, interspecific competition, extinction–colonization processes). The most serious damage has occurred around the largest breeding colonies to the detriment of fragile, rare or very restricted plant and animal species. Thus, from the point of view of fauna and flora conservation, the yellow-legged gull can, for the moment, be considered to be locally superabun dant. Control measures are often very onerous and necessitate heavy manpower and material resources. Additional extensive\n\ninvestigations will be necessary to assess the future development of yellow-legged gull populations and their impact on natural environments.\n\nhttp://www.itameriportaali.fi/en/tietoa/yleiskuvaus/en_GB/780/\n\nThreats to the Baltic birds\n\nThe recent decreases in numbers among several species mentioned above are caused, among other things, ...great black-backed gull and herring gull\n\nHow about gulls devouring whales?\n\nhttp://news.discovery.com/earth/flesh-eating-seagulls-devour-whales-alive-120829.html\n\nOr gulls wiping out a duck colony in a country pond where ducks have been living peacably for centuries?\n\nhttp://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/local-news/gulls-feed-baby-duck-to-young-1-1406188\n\nForty-five ducklings were born this year and 43 of them have been eaten. We were able to rescue and look after one duckling — they are very difficult to catch — and the second survived on its own. We are getting a lot of complaints from the public because they see this happening and the children get quite upset.\n\nhttp://www.rktl.fi/en/julkaisut/j/473.html\n\nCulling project on herring gulls of the central Gulf of Finland 2004–2007\n\nDuring the project, the predation rate by the herring gull on the chicks of the lesser blackbacked gull was reduced to about one-quarter of the 1990s level. It is suggested that this reduction is caused by the cull, reducing the numbers of predatory gulls along the coast.\n\nThere are hundreds of these articles and they are becoming more frequent. Who would have thought of gulls devouring whales? Or putting swallows on the endangered species list?Is it not time to start smelling the coffee? That is all I am asking! DEFRA and the RSPB are in denial in this area and their reliance on a 12 year old survey is dangerous to not just humans.\n\nhttp://www.italiamia.com/education_seagulls.php\n\nSwifts (rondoni), are particularly susceptible to depredation by gulls since they, too, nest on roof-tops, under the tiles. The gulls either catch them as they come in to their nests or pull them out from under the tiles. They have even been know to catch swifts in the air! The result is that these delightful and very characteristic birds of Italian summers are rapidly diminishing in numbers.\n\nPerhaps you should get Andrew Mitchell to help you with your campaign.\n\nI see you are on the IOM. Parents lived in Port St Mary quite a few years ago. Loved it when I visited. Their house was the last one before you entered the track to the Chasms.\n\nInterestingly, I have been looking at the IOM from a gull perspective.\n\nhttp://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/is-it-time-for-seagull-cull-1-3734308\n\nFriday 2 September 2011\n\nIs it time for seagull cull?\n\nPEEL Commissioners are to hold talks on what action they will be taking over the growing problems with seagulls in the town...seagulls have been a problem for a number of years, but they have become bolder and more of a problem recently.\n\nhttp://www.braddan.gov.im/news.aspx?NewsID=755\n\nHerring Gull Nuisance\n\nSince the 1970’s the number of roof nesting gulls has steadily increased around the British Isles causing problems in many inland areas. As in the Isle of Man the main culprit is the Herring Gull.\n\nDue to their increasing habit of roof top nesting, herring gulls are causing considerable nuisance, particularly during the breeding season throughout coastal and inland communities..../\n\nPreventative measures should be taken by owner occupiers to discourage roof top nesting by erecting appropriate netting or devices on chimney heads or flat roofing..../\n\n​\n\nHere is an amazing photo of a biker culling a gull at 170 mph.

The Manx breeding population has fallen by 28 per cent since 1969.​\n\n\"Ironically\" might have been better stated as inexplicably or incredulously. If gulls were dwindling why is the threat increasing? Has anyone carried out a serious study of these gulls on the IOM? Or is Seabird 2000 still relied upon?\n\nI want to ask a few questions about some of the points you have stated.\n\n1. Is there any particular reason for the drop in numbers of HG's?\n\n2. Has the drop in HG numbers seen an increase in the number of other birds on the island both predatory and non-predatory?\n\n3. I have seen footage of HG's kill birds mainly Pigeons for whatever reason on youtube but thats rare cases. When you say the least inoffensive of the 3 breeding big gulls - what does that mean?\n\n4. What was the diet of the 3 breeding big gulls on the island?\n\n5. Did any of the Gulls have predators - Peregrines, Buzzards, Ravens and Great Black-Backed Gulls themselves.....they may not take adult HG's but surely young?\n\nHere on Skomer we currently have about 400 pairs of Herring Gulls, down from a peak of nearly 3000 in the late 70s.\n\nIn 9 years working on the island I have never seen a Herring Gull kill an adult bird, They do take a fair few chicks and eggs - Kittiwakes, Guillemots, Razorbills & Puffin & Manxie chicks if they're flooded out but generally they seem to be most inoffensive of the 3 breeding big gulls, and also the least aggressive to humans.\n\nPersonally I don't think they are having any detrimental affect to any other species on the island - although that would not neccessarily be the case if you didn't have such a healthy seabird population.\n\nThere are a number of predators that could have taken HG's ie White-tailed Sea Eagle, Golden eagle, Goshawk but they are all too busily being persecuted.\n\nWe are just dealing with a bird which is opportunistic and as it suffers because of human greed at one side it manages to exploit the slobbish side of humans on another.\n\nGulls go wherever there is food. They have spread into urban areas simply because of humans leaving food unfinished around. If humans were not so greedy and not so careless they would probably be out there on the coast. I have no idea how they could impact an urban eco-system which is already being impacted by humans. They might have an impact upon Corvid and Pigeon populations as they will feed on the samething - which some might not complain about!\n\nThe gull appears to be a predator that kn ows no predators. What can keep its population in check? Allow a plague to happen and hope for bird flu? IMHO we need an urgent study to kn ow what we are dealing with.\n\nPeregrine falcons have been known to predate Great Black-Backed Gulls at times but rarely do they hunt birds above their size. They need a much larger and more aggressive bird to deal with large Gulls maybe a Goshawk.\n\nTaking a photo of a Mobbing bird does not mean anything. We neither know what happened before or after. However, most potential predators are mobbed and you would be surprised how prey items successfully mob predators much bigger and stronger.\n\nIf you really want a Gull predator then look to the Skua family!\n\nI agree with your drift here--shooting in urban areas would be impractical. I live close to the Sussex Downs and see swarms in the fields and following tractors. I mentioned earlier about a partridge shoot going on in those same fields.

They have single-handedly destroyed biodiversity in Jersey, to the extent that we have no wild birds left, and have even been seen pecking the eyes out of tigers at our world famous zoo. There is strong evidence to suggest that Herring Gulls are responsible for birth defects in new-born babies and a huge rise in heroin abuse among teenagers.

Predation on chicks by black rats Rattus rattus has a negative impact at some breeding colonies (Jones et al. 2008). Nevertheless Audouin's Gull shows a very nomadic breeding site selection and high dispersal rates from year to year, probably avoiding large densities of Yellow-legged Gulls (Oro and Matínez-Abraín 2007; Genovart et al. 2003; Martínez-Abraín et al. 2003).\n\nCulling of Yellow-legged Gulls Larus michehellis was conducted from 2000 to 2009 on Alborán Island, Spain, and demonstrated immediate local benefits (Paracuellos and Nevado 2010).
