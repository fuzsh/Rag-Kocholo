        "text": "By now, the name Juha Kyyrö is bound to ring a bell for most music fans and musicians in Finland. Over an onerous decade for the music industry, the Fullsteam Family – begot by Kyyrö’s unbridled enthusiasm in music – has invigorated the independent (live) music scene in Finland, to the extent that many look back to the late 1990s as a sonic void.\n\nIn the meantime, Fullsteam has grown from one man’s fledgling hobby to a fully-fledged family of music companies with 15 full-time employees, and a varying number of raring interns. The revenue of the company has soared from 50,000 in 2004 to 6 million euros in 2011.\n\nOver the years, the merits of Fullsteam Agency include performances by Prince, Sigur Rós, Belle and Sebastian, Mars Volta and The Flaming Lips, while Fullsteam Records has been responsible for critically acclaimed albums by Abduktio, Callisto, I Walk the Line, Ismo Alanko Teholla, Jaakko & Jay and others – enough to justify six consecutive selections as the independent label of the year in Finland.\n\nToday, the Fullsteam Agency brings roughly 200 foreign bands to Finland a year, and Kyyrö’s prodigy is, on the one hand, a pedestal for ambitious Finnish musicians and, on the other, an encouragement to all who want to get their hands dirty in the music industry.\n\nAfter some scheduling glitches, which seem to suggest that he is yet to run out of steam, SixDegrees got its hands on Kyyrö’s account of the past decade of uncontrolled growth and terrific journeys.\n\nWhat was the impetus for Fullsteam?\n\nIt all started with my love-affair with music – and partly because no one was organising gigs in Finland for my favourite bands or releasing music by the smaller bands I liked. There was never any notion of a profession though, other than as a distant, unrealistic dream; it was rather a hobby and a lifestyle. In some ways, the same energy still thrives, even if Fullsteam has become a real job, with some boring responsibilities.\n\nFullsteam rocketed to the very heart of the Finnish music scene in virtually no time. Has the growth been controlled?\n\nDefinitely not, the growth has never been controlled. I would rather say that the growth over the first few years was surprising and uncontrolled, but maybe that’s why it never caused any major problems. We never had growth strategies or loans as burdens. We just pushed onward, which has resulted in an increase in both revenue and taxes – among other things. Fullsteam is still driven by our desire to get our hands dirty, while everything else remains consequent. Size as such is by no means significant, but growth has enabled us to do things that don’t necessarily turn a profit or things that we want to do for altogether other reasons.\n\nHow and why has Fullsteam been able to engage such a wide range of bands and musicians across genre boundaries? Do any particular triumphs spring to mind?\n\nI believe we are on the same wavelength with many artists, and our love for music is bound to have some bearing. We devote time and efforts to our projects, but I’m sure others do as well.\n\nIt seems that we are always associated with whatever genre our most successful bands represent at a particular time, but both I and Fullsteam have released a wide variety of music from the very beginning. For example, the decision to release the J. Karjalainen album Lännen-Jukka was made on a whim after I got excited about the album and wanted to have it on vinyl. Since no one was putting the record out, I asked if we could do that.\n\nMore than any single event, though, it’s great to look back to the terrific journeys we have enjoyed with a number of bands and Flogging Molly, The Sounds, Opeth, Lapko, Rubik, Disco Ensemble, No Shame and many others.\n\nFullsteam was selected as the best independent label of the year in Finland on six consecutive occasions. How does that make you feel?\n\nFrankly, it got a bit ridiculous, because after a while it seemed like people were habitually voting certain candidates in certain categories – although in many cases, we really did deserve the recognition. Since then, Sakara has claimed the title two times in a row, and it seems that people are definitely not voting for us, because of our streak there, luckily.\n\nThere has been a notable decline in Fullsteam releases in recent years. Why is that?\n\nThe small bands that we started with years ago have grown quite remarkably over the years, and today releasing an album by Rubik, Lapko or Disco Ensemble is simply a massive effort which requires time and energy, not least because their albums are released in so many countries. I guess you can say we have professionalised and thereby the number of albums we put out per year has naturally decreased.\n\nThe Fullsteam calendar currently features a mind-boggling array of shows, from the 18-year-old Justin Bieber to the legendary Rush, alternative pioneers Converge and Mono, and the rising indie character Ariel Pink’s Haunted Graffiti. Heck, there is even a Top Gear Live event there. What exactly is next for Fullsteam?\n\nOur calendar has just about everything at the moment, but the same punk and indie shows are also still there. It’s fun to be able to try new projects and ways of doing things. At least we won’t get bored to death! In the future, I only hope we can continue doing what we want and embrace the wonderful spirit of co-operation and energy we have. That would be the tops.\n\nAleksi Teivainen"
