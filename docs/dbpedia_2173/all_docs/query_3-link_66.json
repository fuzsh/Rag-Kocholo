I suspect that they need grit like other birds\n\nwith access to land. You deserve a gull joke. I hope it's new.\n\nA young man inherited a beach house and a generous fortune from an aunt.\n\nA condition of the inheritance was that he live in the house and care\n\nfor the porpoises she kept in what had been the indoor swimming pool.\n\nShe claimed (posthumously) that they would live forever if fed a regular\n\ndiet of seagulls. It became the young man's task to collect them from\n\nthe beach.\n\nOne morning, as he returned to the house with his catch, his way was\n\nblocked by a lion apparently asleep on his doorstep. As he watched for a\n\nwhile from a safe distance, the lion opened one eye and closed it again\n\nwithout showing any inclination to move. Our hero decided to risk\n\nstepping over the lion; it was important to maintain his charges'\n\nroutine. He was immediately arrested and charged with transporting gulls\n\nacross a staid lion for immortal porpoises.\n\nOuch!\n\nJerry\n\n--\n\nShould any political party attempt to abolish Social Security,\n\nunemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs,\n\nyou would not hear of that party again in our political history.\n\nThere is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes that you can\n\ndo these things. Among them are a few Texas oil millionaires, and an\n\noccasional politician or businessman from other areas. Their number\n\nis negligible, and they are stupid.\n\n- Pres. Dwight D.

You\n\ncould also talk to some of the local zoos, gulls have been kept fairly\n\nsuccessfully in zoos and aquariums for quite some time.\n\nAlso, check out your local bait or fishing shops. They should have bait fish\n\navailible, which are usually whatever common small marine fish is local in\n\nyour area. Chances are that is what your gull is eating. Even if the bird\n\nwas found inland I bet that they spend at least a part of the year at the\n\nshore. Note: if the fish has been frozen at any point you will need to\n\nsupplement for Vit B12 as that breaks down in frozen fish. I would also try\n\nfeeding veggitables to him, such as peas, carrots, and cooked sweet\n\npotatoes.\n\nHard plastic kiddie pools are easier to clean then a pond, unless you can\n\ndrain your pond every day. Chances are he's going to poop in the water or\n\nwant to eat in it, which means that you will have to clean it out so he can\n\nhave desent drinking water, as well as preventing algae blooms. A gull\n\nshould tame easily, goodness knows the ones around here are horrible\n\nbeggers. Once he figures out that you are the Source of Food I have no doubt\n\nthat he will become more friendly, but watch out for the beak! I've been\n\nbitten by ravens and I imagine that a gull would be worse, especially if\n\nhe's one of the larger species.\n\nAlso, if you are making an open top pen be aware that there could be\n\nproblems with predators. I don't know how many hawks you have there, but I\n\nthink a Common Buzard or Sparrowhawk might be a problem, as well as some of\n\nthe owls. There is also the issue of stray dogs and cats and foxes, as well\n\nas rats. Something to think about when designing an enclosure. It might be a\n\ngood idea to clean his enclosure every evening to get rid of any leftover\n\nfood that might attract unwanted pests.\n\nGloria\n\nOn Thu, 26 May 2005 09:15:35 +0100, Katie wrote:\n\n> I found a seagull with a broken wing and took him to the vet's.

Hope this helps. -Akira\n\n- - -\n\nAquatic Birds\n\nRecommendations for feeding other fish-eating birds (eg, cormorant, heron,\n\n_gull_, tern, loon, grebe, petrel) are similar to those for penguins. Some\n\nspecies will accept commercial bird-of-prey diets, trout pellets, and/or\n\nmice in the diet, as well as fish.\n\n...\n\nPenguins, pelicans, and other fish-eating species in the wild feed\n\nprimarily on fish, crustaceans, and squid. In captivity, capelin, squid,\n\nsmelt, herring, mackerel, and whiting are commonly fed. One of the most\n\nimportant aspects of feeding penguins and other fish-eating birds is fish\n\nquality (see MARINE MAMMALS, p 1529). All fish-eating birds should receive\n\na mixed diet consisting of at last 2 fish species to ensure proper\n\nnutrition. Supplements commonly given to penguins include salt,\n\npolyunsaturated fatty acids, and vitamins. Dietary salt (NaCl) is provided\n\nto birds in freshwater exhibits to help maintain proper functioning of the\n\nsalt glands; 0.5-1 g salt/bird/day should be adequate for most species.\n\nProviding a supplemental source of essential fatty acids has been\n\nrecommended during reproduction and molting when monotypic diets of smelt\n\nare fed: 2-3mL of corn oil /bird/day has been satisfactory. Thiamine and\n\nvitamin E supplementation (25mg thiamine and 100 IU vitamin E/kg of fish,\n\nas fed) is recommended whenever fish that have been frozen are fed. Vitamin\n\nD3 supplementation (250-500 IU/kg of fish, as fed) may be beneficial for\n\nbirds not exposed to direct sunlight. Providing calcium carbonate or\n\ndicalcium phosphate to females during reproductive periods is a common\n\npractice to ensure proper eggshell formation. Penguins and pelicans should\n\nbe fed individually by hand to ensure that each bird receives the proper\n\namount of supplements and to better monitor intake. Generally, intake is\n\n0.5-2 kg fish/day depending on the species of penguin, fat content of the\n\nfish, and molt status.\n\np.1532 MARINE MAMMALS / NUTRITION AND NUTRITIONAL DISEASES\n\nGenerally captive animals fed a diet that is solely or primarily fish are\n\nprovided dead fish that have been frozen. The logistics and difficulty in\n\nproviding this fish can lead to some special nutritional concerns. All fish\n\nare not of equal nutritional value; diets consisting of a single species of\n\nfish are unlikely to provide balanced nutrition for anyanimal. Similarly,\n\none diet will not serve all piscivores equally. Only fish suitable for\n\nhuman consumption should be fed.\n\nStorage and thawing of frozen fish must be monitored carefully. Feed fish\n\nshould be held at -19F (-28C) to reduce deterioration of their nutritional\n\nvalue through oxidation of amino acids and unsaturated lipids. Dehydration\n\nof frozen fish can also be a problem for animals that obtain their water\n\nfrom their food. Fatty fish should not be stored > 6 mo. Few fish, with the\n\npossible exception of capelin, should be stored > 1yr. To retain optimal\n\nvitamin content and reduce moisture loss, frozen fish should be thawed in\n\nair under refrigeration. Thawing in water leaches away water-soluble\n\nvitamins. Thawing at room temperature encourages bacterial growth and\n\nspoilage.\n\n...\n\nHahaha! I've been feeding him steak and bacon so far... :)\n\nThat is not really good to be feeding a sea gull. I dont really think\n\nyou are really taking this serious by thinking it is a joke feeding\n\nsteak & bacon!!\n\nHow sad, whats it going to be like in about 30yrs time if he is a baby\n\nnow what are you going to be feeding it then?? Fish - pilchards,\n\nwhitebait are a good sensible diet. You will need to have it on\n\nVitamins you need specialty sea tablets for all sea birds. What about\n\nCalcium for its bones after having a wing cut off, it needs calcium. I\n\nreally think you should get this bird to an experienced carer. We\n\nrescue wildlife that unlicensed people have had for months and then\n\nthey say they dont want it anymore(eg: Eastern Grey\n\nKangaroo's/possums/birds). It is just rediculous , then its our very\n\nown hard task of having to rehab it getting it to eat the foods or\n\nsupplement foods it is supposed to be eating. People like you who\n\nthinks it is funny to be feeding the bird bacon and steak. If you arent\n\nserious about saving this birds life euthanasia would have been kinder.\n\nSurely you have other groups - zoo's, animal parks,etc that would give\n\nthe gull a much better life with other sea birds and the proper care.\n\nHow would you like to live a life without legs or arms and be locked\n\nup. It may be a joke to you whether you love birds or not....thinking\n\nits funny to be feeding it bacon. It's just not on. Are you supposed to\n\nbe licensed to take injured birds where you are??\n\nI am really sorry for sounding so angry, come on what type of a life\n\ndoes this poor bird deserve after you got the wing cut off?? With its\n\nown kind in a zoo or park, eating a proper diet or running around some\n\nhouse with you feeding it whatever you want. What happens when you get\n\ntired of it?\n\nMaz\n\n\"Akira\" <akir...@hotmail.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:mbg0ra1snb8r$.i4yet5i0gm4t.dlg@40tude.net...\n\n\n\nIn my opinion posting this information is irresponsible.

I'd go as far as\n\nto say that they are one of the easiest birds to take care of...\n\nIn the beginning, I fed the babies a mixture of fish blended with full\n\ncream milk - which they thrived on. Once the babies were big enough to\n\nstart running around and fluttering, it was a hard job to keep them\n\naway from whatever I was eating at the time (they climb on the table,\n\nsteal food from your plate and attempt to grab it from your mouth -\n\nwhich I let them do sometimes). I simply gave them a portion of\n\nwhatever I was having, fed them a bit of canned tuna/salmon every day\n\nand made sure they had plenty of fresh water to drink. All the gulls\n\ngrew large, plump and strong and eventually flew away. They seemed\n\nperfectly fine in the wild - some of them hung around the area for\n\nweeks and seemed perfectly healthy and able to fend for themselves,\n\noccasionally sitting on my fence and calling to me.\n\nThe fact that the gull in question is crippled means that the original\n\nposter should take care WRT predators but I can't really see her\n\nhaving any problems - gulls are tough cookies and very adaptable. Keep\n\nhim clean and safe, give him something to swim/bathe in, don't feed\n\nhim too much junk (a healthy diet for a human seems to be, from my\n\npersonal experience perfectly adequate for a gull) and you should be\n\nfine with your new 'pet'. If he's only a baby he should become quite\n\ntame, though don't be surprised if he tries to assert himself over you\n\nat the top of the pecking order!\n\nmaz wrote:\n\n> Full cream milk is bad for all birds!!!

As long as you don't do anything\n\nstupid like feed them on a bread-only diet, I can't really see you\n\ndoing it much harm with 'human' food (provided you eat a fairly\n\nhealthy diet yourself). There are plenty of urban gulls who have\n\nprobably never even seen a fish in their lives (unless it was a piece\n\nof fried fish dropped in the street or a rotting fish-head at the\n\ndump) and exist solely - and thrive on 'human' food.\n\n\"Phil D.\" <no-...@home.here.now> wrote in message\n\nnews:q9mn91t1r63k2vjrd...@4ax.com...\n\n> On 30 May 2005 16:01:02 -0700, \"maz\" <mazb...@ozemail.com.au> wrote:\n\n>\n\n>>Full cream milk is bad for all birds!!!

I saw no need to change it.\n\nMilk isn't toxic to birds. While they can't digest lactose it doesn't hurt\n\nthem either, lactose just passes through their digestive system undigested.\n\nAt worse it might give them gas. And gulls are scavengers, fully capable of\n\neating rotten carrion and not coming to harm.\n\nThere is a big difference between the types of food that a captive bird\n\nshould be fed, and the foods that we can feed a wild one. For example\n\nfeeding a diet of lard and sunflower seeds to a pet finch would be very\n\nwrong,the finch would likely become sick and die within months on such a\n\ndiet. For a wild finch suet and sunflower seeds are an excelent way to see\n\nthem up close, and do no harm. This is because a wild bird needs more energy\n\nthen a captive one and won't get fat (unless that's what they need to do),\n\nand wild birds are able to eat other foods and thus balance their diet.\n\nI guess my point is that in a way you both are correct. Gulls can and do eat\n\neverything in the wild and come to no harm, but captive birds should not be\n\nfed anything and everything. They should be fed only healthy foods. What\n\nthat is for a gull I can't really say, since I have no experience with them,\n\nbut I imagin that it would be a diet of mostly small marine fish (most\n\nlikely whatever local baitfish, as well as fresh herrings and sardines), as\n\nwell as some veggies and fruits, and possibly soaked monkey biscuit.\n\nGloria\n\nOn Thu, 26 May 2005 09:15:35 +0100, Katie wrote:\n\n> I found a seagull with a broken wing and took him to the vet's.

He's my responsibility and I\n\n> fully intend to look after him.\n\nKatie,\n\nFYI, I found this very informative web site:\n\nhttp://britishwildlifehelpline.com/index.html\n\n(The earlier listing of British rehab centers was actually part of this\n\nwebsite.)\n\nIt has some specific instructions as to what to feed gulls on an emergency\n\nbasis when they aren't eating. (Fishy canned cat food, if necessary diluted\n\nwith water and tube-fed, is what they suggest.) Also it has a list of some\n\nrehab-related reference books that you might want to look into.\n\nAlthough the site doesn't have any other gull-specific info, it does say:\n\n\"If you want any other information please contact:\n\nma...@britishwildlifehelpline.com \"\n\nSo I wonder if this could be another potential source of info for you,\n\nalong with the previously mentioned list of rehab facilities.\n\nAlso, aside from all of the above, one thing I would consider doing, if I\n\nwere you, is weighing the bird periodically. Keeping a record of this and\n\nmonitoring weight trend should help you judge its current health status.\n\nFor example if it is maintaining or gaining weight and looks alert and\n\nresponsive, probably things are going okay. On the other hand if it starts\n\nto lose weight, it may be time to consult a vet to see what might be going\n\non, etc. Just a suggestion.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-Akira (in California, USA)\n\n\"Still learning gull ID after all these years\"\n\n\"Grygon's\" <REMOVESP...@gmail.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:d7joms$cnb$1...@reader2.nmix.net...\n\n> taking in a wild animal, no matter your good attentions is never a good\n\nidea\n\n> unless you are experienced with animal rescue or are prepared to do a good\n\n> amount of research, and i don't mean by just asking newsgroups. contact\n\n> your local animal wild life rescue center or zoo and they can set you up\n\n> either with some one who already knows what they are doing, or with\n\nsomeone\n\n> who can teach you what to do. it seems to me you have no experience in\n\nthis\n\n> sort of thing, and the animal will suffer for it. :(\n\n>\n\n> another thing to consider: it might be illegal in your state to have this\n\n> bird!\n\nAhem.
