        "text": "Finland is a member of the Schengen Agreement, so check Schengen Visa for details on various types of visas you may need. To enter and travel around Finland, U.S. citizens are required to have an approved ETIAS visa waiver.\n\nIn addition, you may enter for Finland for up to 90 days for tourist purposes without a visa. For more details on travel into and within Schengen countries, please see our fact sheet.\n\nSince Finland has one of the best public transportation systems, you don‚Äôt need to rent a car to get around.\n\nBY TRAIN: The trains are clean and comfortable, even if you have to take an overnight train traveling from Helsinki to Lapland (Kolari station,) or from Helsinki to Rovaniemi requires approximately about 8 hours. Valtion Rautatiet runs Finnish trains. It‚Äôs a fast and efficient service, with prices roughly equivalent to buses on the same route. VR‚Äôs website offers comprehensive timetable information, and major stations have ticket machines. Tickets can also be purchased online, where there are discounted advance fares. You can board and pay the conductor, but if the station where you boarded had ticket-purchasing facilities, you‚Äôll be charged a small penalty fee (‚Ç¨2 to ‚Ç¨5). The main types of trains are the high-speed Pendolino (the fastest and most expensive class), fast Intercity (IC), Express and 2nd-class-only Regional trains (H on the timetable). Eurail and InterRail each offer their own ‚ÄúCountry‚Äù and ‚ÄúGlobal‚Äù passes, which offer travel within 28-30 European countries. Be sure to check out the websites for eligibility and discount information.\n\nBY FERRY / BOAT: There are many ferry lines (Viking, Tallink, Finnlines‚Ä¶etc.) traveling over the Baltic Sea, between Finland, Estonia and Russia.\n\nBY BUS: There are also many express coach lines (Matkahuolto, Onnibus, ExpressBus) that can reach from big cities to smaller villages and towns. Departures range from every 10 to 15 minutes in cities, and every 30 to 60 minutes in small towns. Fares keep around ‚Ç¨2.50 to ‚Ç¨3.50 and payment goes directly to the driver.\n\nBY CAR: During summertime, renting a car and driving through Finland offers beautiful scenery around the way. During winter months, however, it‚Äôs not recommended to rent a car if you‚Äôre not familiar with snowy and slippery roads. Finland follows right-handed traffic, and headlights must be turned on at all times. Caution must be taken since elks and reindeer that are active during evenings and wander freely on the roads. The taxi (taksi) in Finland is more expensive, particularly for short rides. There‚Äôs an initial charge of ‚Ç¨3.90 in Helsinki (often more elsewhere) with a minimum of ‚Ç¨7 and a per-kilometre charge of up to ‚Ç¨1.09. Fares increase with 4 or more passengers, and there‚Äôs a surcharge for night and weekend services.\n\nFinland is very safe for female solo travelers, since the country has low crime rates and locals are extremely hospitable. It is statistically the least dangerous place on Earth, and was recently rated the happiest country worldwide. However, you should always follow normal travel rules, and guard your bags, wallets and other personal effects.\n\nThe Finns are extremely friendly, so anytime you feel like you‚Äôre in danger or need help, locals will be more than willing to assist.\n\nFinland also ranks first in reliable police services. The average pickup time for emergency calls is 5 seconds. To get a hold of police, fire and ambulance services, be sure to contact the emergency number 112.\n\nThe weather in Finland is quite diverse. In fact, the country is considered to have both a maritime and continental climate.\n\nIf you love winter activities, then December to March is the best period to visit Finland. If you prefer spring activities, then aim for April and May. The warmest month in Finland is typically July, and the coldest is February.\n\nFinland‚Äôs weather is variable and can change very quickly, which is common for weather in Scandinavia.\n\nThese are the estimated local temperatures according to seasons:\n\nSpring: 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius)\n\nSummer: 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius)\n\nAutumn: 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12 degrees Celsius)\n\nWinter: -45¬∞C to -50¬∞C in Lapland, -35¬∞C to -45¬∞C in other regions.\n\nWinters are long and cold. In northern parts of Finland, you can find snow on the ground for upwards of 90 days each year. This weather is perfect if your bucket list entails visiting reindeer farms, steaming in saunas nestled into snow-capped mountains, or viewing the northern lights. The mildest weather in winter is found in southwestern Finland, amongst the countless islands in the Baltic Sea.\n\nFinnish is the first official language of Finland, spoken by 93% of the country‚Äôs 5 million inhabitants. It‚Äôs renowned as one of the most difficult languages to learn since it‚Äôs theoretically related to Hungarian, but locals speak English in most tourist areas. As opposed to other Scandinavian countries that have similar Germanic roots, the Finnish language is closer to Russian than it is to Swedish, Norwegian or Danish.\n\nSwedish is spoken by around 6% of the population, most of whom live in the southwest.\n\nS√°mi is a minority language in the Nordic countries which is spoken by around 2,000 people in the north of Finland, making up about 0.03% of the population.\n\nHere are a few basic words and phrases to learn:\n\nHello = Hei (pronounced ‚Äúhey‚Äù)\n\nGoodbye = Hei Hei (‚Äúhey hey‚Äù)\n\nYes = Kyll√§ (ku-yu-la)\n\nNo = Ei (pronounced like the letter ‚Äúa‚Äù)\n\nThank you = Kiitos\n\nYou are welcome = Ei kest√§\n\nExcuse me = Anteeksi (sounds like ‚Äúaun-taxi‚Äù)\n\nMy name is ‚Ä¶ = Nimeni on ‚Ä¶ (‚Äúknee-many on‚Äù)\n\nNice to meet you = Hauska tavata\n\nHotel = Hotelli\n\nAirport = Lentokentt√§\n\nTrain = Juna\n\nBus = Bussi\n\nSubway = Metro\n\nTicket = Lippu (‚Äúleap-o‚Äù)\n\nFinland‚Äôs unit of currency is Euros. Though the most common use of payment is via debit or credit cards, there are plenty of ATMs‚Äîespecially in the cities‚Äîand most machines will accept cards issued by major international banks. US, UK and Australian cards are widely accepted in Finnish hotels, restaurants, stores and markets. Visa, Mastercard and Maestro are most common, and American Express is accepted in most places as well.\n\nAs a rule, service is included in restaurant bills. Therefore, tipping has never fitted very comfortably into the Finnish way of life. You can feel safe that while nobody will object, very few will mind not being tipped.\n\nTipping! Restaurants typically include a service charge so tipping isn‚Äôt necessary. Always check the bill and you can always tip more for excellent service but it is not expected."
