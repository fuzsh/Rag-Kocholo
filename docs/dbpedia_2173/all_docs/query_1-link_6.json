        "text": "Although metalheads and hillbillies alike might be loath to admit it, bluegrass and metal actually have a LOT in common. Both require an immense amount of skill and are played with lots of notes at a very high speed. And then, of course, there’s the drinking.\n\nSo it’s not really a stretch to imagine that a bluegrass cover of a metal song might come out of Finland, a country known for having skilled metal musicians and a culture steeped in metal — although I didn’t know that down home, hillbilly bluegrass had made it’s way there yet.\n\nNo idea what possessed them to name their band this, but here’s Steve’n’Seagulls doing “Seek and Destroy,” and doing it up, too:\n\nI guess this is what it feels like to be culturally misappropriated. A bunch of Finns dressing up like American rednecks. Kind of like when we play power metal? I’m okay with it."
