        "text": "so these guys moved in on Thursday when I first noticed them and have been harassing all my birds.\n\nEating all their seed and scaring them away.. They weren't there today so hoping they gone now.\n\nI really don't have the time to run back and forth from work 4 to 5 times per day to check on all my critters..\n\nI will if I have too though!!!\n\nBlériot53 Posted at 7-23 06:51\n\nThey can be as much of a nuisance as pigeons when they settle in an area in numbers.\n\nI look after a handful of pigeons and doves as well yes.\n\nThey are pretty big eaters but I don't have to worry about them preying on all of the other birds.\n\nSeagulls are known to eat other birds and Olivia is not too thrilled about having them on her field.\n\nShe had 2 eggs in her nest a week ago but the big storm we had a few days ago, she lost one..\n\n(i waited for her to fly far away before I took this. it's the morning after the huge storm we had. I was worried as shYte. I can see her nest all day from work)\n\nThere is 1 left and looks to be ok. If it does hatch, there is not enough time left in the season for it to develop enough to fly south with mom and dad in late September anyway. I will get in touch with the Ministry of Wildlife and the Perth County Humane Society the second I see anything wrong.\n\nI saw her and egg again today and everything seems to be ok..\n\nThanks Blériot53!!\n\nBlériot53 Posted at 7-23 22:37\n\nFrom what you say, if the egg hatches the chick would of necessity overwiinter with you if it cannot migrate. Would it survive?\n\nPandion Haliaetus eggs take 32 to 43 days of incubation, then another 48 to 59 days to fledge.\n\nSo take the bare minimum @ 30 plus 50 = 80 days from today which would take us to Oct. 12thish.\n\nReally pushing it there as Olivia and her mate Oscar will be flying south by this time for sure..\n\nIf it hatches, I will contact Perth Humane Society to let them know. I really don't know what happened\n\nto the first four she hatched in early May. They were all there one day and gone the next and they were\n\nnot tiny.. You could see them for miles in that nest.. Didn't need a drone.. Wouldn't take the drone near the nest anyway if there are babies in it.. If I was in a position to rescue it if it was abandoned,\n\nyou bet your life it would survive.. I've done my research and would make sure it got everything it needed.. We will have to wait until about August 5th to the 10th to see if it hatches.\n\nHave a cpl of weeks to go yet and anything can happen ..\n\nNo worries,, I have faith\n\nThanks Blériot!!\n\nDowntownRDB Posted at 7-24 03:03\n\nNicely filmed Johnny. Gulls can be a real pain. I call them trash birds because they will eat anything and then poop all over the place. I got tired of having to pressure wash my dock so I got an air horn and a flying owl kite. So far it appears they have moved on from my property.\n\nHopefully, the egg will hatch soon.\n\nyes they called trash birds here and yes they poop everywhere lmao.\n\nActually if you notice that roof near the end of that video?\n\nPoooop Everywhere wholly ..\n\nThey are a pain in the butt and cause a lot of grief but I still Love them\n\nI hope the egg hatches soon as well.. If it does, I will be keeping my eye on it 24/7..\n\nAugust 5th to 10th..\n\nThanks DownTown!!!\n\nMs Ivy Posted at 7-24 12:59\n\nThat is a lot of gulls hitting one of those would be bad for sure.\n\nI have a similar issue with blue jays where i live, lots and lotS of blue jays here and they are very aggressive toward other birds that frequent my bird feeders as well\n\nI have never seen that many in that area ever.\n\nHave no idea what attracted them.\n\nI have seen 1 Blue Jay all summer.. That is it .\n\nYes they are very aggressive when in packs for sure and probably best that there are none around.\n\nI have at least 10 different species that are living on the property and come to feed regularly..\n\nIt's very sweet to see them all get a long and share. No fighting what so ever\n\nThey even share with the squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, ground hogs, and rabbits.\n\nYes I have quite the zoo @ work lolZ..\n\nThank You Ms Ivy !! It is sad how bigger birds can pester and harass smaller ones, and also occasionally people. My friend has been harassed by many of them, he tends to be jumpy when he visits my house and has to walk past a couple of \"hotspots\". Those gulls also have been pooping around our high-rises front and back yards, my neighbour attempted to scare them away by placing a rubber snake on a table at the back yard but they don't seem to care about it. Luckily, those birds haven't harassed me, but my car tends to get bombed way too often.\n\nI hope the inhabitant of that egg will make it through!\n\nHGDC84 Posted at 7-24 14:28\n\nIt is sad how bigger birds can pester and harass smaller ones, and also occasionally people.

First-winter European birds have more checkered upperparts, more streaked underparts, and a paler rump and base to the tail.\n\nRing-billed Gulls are smaller and more daintily built than Herring Gulls. Breeding birds have yellow legs and a black line around the bill, whereas breeding Herring Gulls have pink legs and a red mark on the lower bill.\n\nI will do some further investigating sometime this week to figure out for sure. Yes it's very hard to tell\n\nfrom the video, but didn't see any red or markings on their bills.\n\nThanks DAFlys!!"
