        "text": "Daisy showed early promise with their debut album , but since then some unfortunate events have slowed down their progress. Thankfully even a burned down rehearsal place wasn't enough to make them quit and now things look bright for them. The new material is stronger than ever. Some soft pop of the eighties seem to flavour some of the new songs. That might sound scary, but instead it all works beautifully.\n\nDrowsy is young finnish songwriter Mauri Heikkinen who got a record deal from excellent british label Fat Cat (also Animal Collective, Sigur Ros, Amandine etc) before no-one really knew him in Finland. Unfortunately it still seems that he is not very well-known eventhough he has two really good full albums out on Fat Cat Records.\n\nDrowsy's music falls a bit far from the centerpoint of this website. People have been trying to categorize Drowsy into acid folk and psych folk genres and it has been said that his music recalls Syd Barrett, Robert Wyatt and Smog. But it's definitely not too weird for pop fans either. There's beautiful melodies and atmospheric tunes for us to enjoy. Drowsy makes hauntingly good material and is definitely an artists that deserves much more recognition in his homeland.\n\nThere's never too many alt.country / power pop groups as far as I'm concerned. And Ethel Suspense isn't just another decent band in that excellent category. They certainly are one of the better ones. If you've have soft spot in your heart for groups like The Jayhawks, Wilco and Teenage Fanclub, you better make some room for Ethel Suspense too. I'm sure you'll love them too. This is excellent country-tinged guitar pop.\n\nThe Everglades writes melodic and colourful pop songs. There are certainly some 60's influences and you can hear some Beatles here and there. But that's never a bad thing. They categorize their music as fockpop. I'm not really sure what that is, but it must be something great, because I really like what I'm hearing. At least it's well-crafted and beautifully arranged pop music.\n\nIntensive, passionate and emotional guitar pop. Flannelmouth is creating dramatic pop music and therefore fans of groups like The Smiths or Suede should take a notice. But it's not the whole thruth. They are also able to write lighter beautiful pop tunes and the dramatic side isn't always on the front. Anyway, if you're looking for emotion-filled intensive guitar pop with strong vocals and plenty of addictive melodies, Flannelmouth is a really good choise.\n\nGoodnight Monsters is a wonderful pop group and I hope great things will happen to them. They might not be the greatest musicians on earth, but they have something that all perfect masters of their instruments doesn't necessarily have. Joyful approach, true love for pop music and perfect pop sensibility are things I value highly and these boys have those things covered well. Matti might be even the best new pop songwriter in the country. During every Goodnight Monsters concert, I just keep wondering how much I love his songs. And because Valtteri can also write really good songs, the songwriting department of the band is in great shape. Goodnight Monsters is the band for you, if you love sweet and joyful indie pop.\n\nGraceskull seem to be on a break at this moment in time and Ove and Julius are mostly concentrating to their other music projects. Anyway, this is really tender and beautiful music. Some might argue that Ove's voice isn't strong enough to carry these beautiful songs. They are totally wrong if you ask me. I even feel that the singing is a huge part of their charm. Think of softly floating acoustic-based material in the vein of Red House Painters.\n\nHarry Hunks is still alive and they are still the most charming band in the country. Nowadays there's only two harry hunks Matti and Antti, but they still have more charm than a room full of hollywood hunks. Harry Hunks is a marvellous group and can do anything you can hope for. Whether you're looking for beautiful and moody pop, light and loungy treats or charming pop hits, they can provide it all. I'm still hoping for a debut album to appear. if it happens, I will be smiling for days, weeks or decades.\n\nThis is not pop music, but Jolly Jumpers is one of the best bands in Finland and needs to be listed. They've been doing their own thing for 20 years. You might call it desert rock or finnish americana if you wish. I'm not sure what it should be called, but I know for a fact that it sounds utterly wonderful. Rural blues, whisky-eyed country, homegrown rock and two amazing guitarist. It just doesn't get much better than this.\n\nThere's never too much of finnish americana. Helsinki-based Kim Curly band is able to create marvellous songs that fall somewhere between americana and folk rock. They are still in the early stage of their hopefully brilliant career, but the first little release shows bags of talent. Very captivating stuff and highly recommended if you are into americana or country-tinged pop music.\n\nI suppose The Krispies shouldn't be here anymore. It looks like they won't ever return. Perhaps The Krispies was just a one-off project. But a brilliant project nevertheless. Sometimes I wonder have neither Knipi (Egotrippi) or Lasse Kurki (Lemonator) released anything better during their wonderful careers in pop music. Solid Gold Rockstars by The Krispies remain as one of the very best guitar pop albums ever released in this country.\n\nTired of all that pop music and looking for something different. Jarno Alho & Janne Lastumäki do make wonderful pop music in Sister Flo, but their other group Kytäjä is instrumental music that takes you to the 70's. You can expect beautiful moods and jazzy feelings. It's flavoured with soul, delivered with heart. It's harmonic, it's captivating, it's even proge-ish. It can be everything you want it to be. It's the escape to a dream of reality.\n\nThe Latebirds seem to spend more time in america than in Finland. And I suppose it's understandable, because there's not much market for this kind of music in this little country. During their stayings across the pond they've collaborated with folks like Wilco's Ken Coomer. The Latebirds is basicly a rock group but there's a fair share of country influences and pop melodies in their songs. It all leans strongly to american songwriting tradition and major influences are artists like The Band, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Tom Petty.\n\nIf I ever had any doubts, they completely faded away when I saw Laurila's live performance. This is just one damn tight live band. I don't think I've seen better live concerts from a finnish band during the last year or two. This is quite rockin' pop, but there's plenty of gorgeous melodies and Mr. Janne Laurila is one amazing vocalist. They are quite versatile too. You can find sunny pop hits, almost trendy rockers, good old power pop songs and even a ballad or two. A wonderful band.\n\nLeaky Soles is a melodic indie rock / guitar pop trio from Turku. Often compared to bands like Weakerthans and The Lemonheads and they certainly take influences from US indie rock of the nineties. Janne Rinne is an excellent songwriter and capable of writing some of the finest indie tunes on these shores. Leaky Soles is a marvellous selection, if you want some indie rock that is delivered with pop sensibility.\n\nSunny indie-pop sounds, easy-flowing colourful melodies and gorgeous male/female vocals. Awesome thoughtful arrangements and some non-typical instrumets like flutes and trumpets building up the atmosphere. Le Futur Pompiste is a truly marvellous indie pop outfit. If you want some guidelines, think of early Stereolab sharing their secrets with 60's groups like Free Design. A great band and deserves much more recognition. Thankfully the indie pop people know them all around the globe.\n\nLemonator is one of the first pop bands that I ever came across with. Well to be precise, it is almost their fault that I became a pop fan. Lemonator is also one of the better known bands on this website. They started out in the late nineties by creating pretty straightforward power pop, but the years have brought more colours and more beauty to their sound. This is timeless, beautifully crafted pop music. Music big enough to fill a stadium, songs small enough to fill the hearts indie snobs.\n\nDamn Seagulls should have entered the bands section a few years ago, but unfortunately I was totally blind and it took me until spring 2007 to get my eyesight back and completely fall in love with this group. This is gorgeous big sounding rock music with hints of soul and punk thrown into the mix. Think of Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street band, Afghan Whigs, Hold Steady. Fabulous soul-flavoured rockers, but also plenty of slower material with pop sensibility. A perfect live band too.\n\nYou might have gotten to know them because of their wonderful animated music videos. If you did you must have noticed that the music itself is equally brilliant. It's gorgeous melodic indie rock. Think of Beck who is focusing on guitar-orientated rock music for a change. Twisted tales and great melodies. Pretty recognisable sound too.\n\nJohnny Superhero is a group that gives me mixed-up feelings. On the other hand, they have some really wonderful pop songs in the vein of Nada Surf and The Posies, but some of the material is a bit too rock for my taste. But the good stuff is indeed really really good and I do love half of their material. It also needs to be said that Johnny Superhero has a fabulous vocalist. What a wonderful voice.\n\nHell Cat is a glorious mess and a whole lot of fun. But not without really good songs and killer hooks. They don't take themselves too seriously, but based on their myspace tunes there certainly are lots of great pop moments in the songs. It also seems that anything can and will happen in the songs. To be honest I don't really know much about them, but perhaps I'm wiser after I've seen their live performance. Right now I'll suggest that you judge it yourself and hit the link below.\n\nWell perhaps not pop music, but wonderful music nevertheless and deserves to be included. To Tirzah for example is such a perfect song that pitchfork would praise it to heavens, if it was released by some \"right\" label like Drag City or Fat Cat. Very unique folky singer-songwriter material and I totally love his voice. If some label wants an imaginary culture award from onechord.net, release Eadweard Muybridge's myspace songs as an seven inch single and you'll have it.\n\nThe Dance is a promising new group that released a great Campfire Call Out -EP in late 2006. Few months later lead singer Olli Noroviita left the group in order to be able to focus on his other bands. Therefore the future is bit unclear at the moment, but new lead vocalist Ville Pelttari is also a really good one, so there shouldn't be huge problems in the horizon and I'm fairly confident that they'll continue to give us highly melodic and energetic pop music.\n\nBuzzing guitars, power chords, high energy. These are some guidelines that lead us to the music of Hundred million martians. That description didn't sound very pop (or maybe it did), but there's no need to worry. Despite the inevitable rock and even glampunk elements, they are familiar with the tradition of powerpop and haven't forgotten catchy melodies. Hundred Million Martians continues to impress with each and every release.\n\nSamae Koskinen is the frontman of Sister Flo, but when he finds time he also makes solo releases and tours with his band called Taikabändi. His solo debut Vol 1 gained a lot media interest, because the lyrics had been written by finnish novelists and poets (okay it gained it because it was a fantastic album). It proved to be a good idea and some fabulous pop songs born out of these collaborations. The next solo album is scheluded for the year 2008.\n\nJanne Lastumäki is a busy guy. He is playing in wonderful groups such as Sister Flo, Kytäjä, Tolbiac, Kevin and still manages to find time for own material. There are no official solo releases. Just some demos on his myspace page, but I'm already impressed. This is music that has a heart that heals you and arms where you can rest. If you look up the phrase \"beauty in sound\" from the web dictionary, it probably links you to Janne's myspace. The music might take you somewhere in the 60's and 70's where light pop psychedelia emerges with canterbury's folk scene and is then flavoured by jazzy elements and progressive structures.\n\nThe Electric Crayon Set is a psych-pop group led by Timo Pääkkö (experienced musician who was also a founding member of Penniless People of Bulgaria). This is 60's and 70's influenced psychedelic powerpop and modpop. They've also played at International Pop Overthrow festival at Liverpool. It's a band that I've managed to miss almost completely which is a shame because based on myspace samples they do make my kind of music. Especially Good Girl is a fabulous pop tune with a killer chorus.\n\nI Was a Teenage Satan Worshipper comes from Tampere. It's hard to describe them, but you might get close if you think about electroclash with buzzing indie rock guitars and synth sound from the 80's. It's rhythmic and dancable pop music and a whole lot of fun. Perhaps not the finest choise for fans of traditional pop like myself, but certainly provides a a good alternative.\n\nA little town called Ylivieska has brought a lot of pop talent to this country of ours. Some of them are Linna brothers Esa and Olli who started out with some punk pop in a group called Time Flies in the early 90s. Since then years have gone by and unfortunately the years brought sadness inside them. A great songwriter, producer, musician and all-around nice guy Olli Linna passed away few years ago and left a giant hole in the finnish pop scene. Thankfully Esa Linna continues to charm us with excellent homemade powerpop. There are no releases available, but you can follow his talent on his myspace page.\n\nAndy Lundström is a Vaasa-based pop singer-songwriter. I think he used to play in Leopold Delloria, but nowadays he is focusing on solo career. Anyway, he writes really good melodic pop tunes and has a really good voice. The production might be too radio-friendly for indie snobs like yours truly, but it can't hide the fact that the songs are well-crafted and beautifully played. A new upcoming talent and I certainly need to keep an ear on him.\n\nThis is was a total last minute entry to this band section. I was on streetcar myspace at 3 am and noticed this on their top friends. Went to have a listen and instantly fell in love. Truly beautiful down-to-earth country tunes. A great vocalist, beautiful instrumentation. Totally my kind of stuff. And if that name has something to do with Townes Van Zandt, I love them even more. To be honest, I know absolutely nothing about them at this point. Only thing I know is that they have two wonderful country songs on their myspace"
