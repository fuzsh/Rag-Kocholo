        "text": "My DS mentioned that his seaside town has few seagulls now. They are usually noisy and troublesome but they have gone. I then realised that the school field near me has lost its usual little flock. We put it down to the lack of people eating take aways and dropping food- there are a lot of take-away food places near me. But one thing I don't know is where have the seagulls gone? A waste tip is my best guess, but has anyone seen more seagulls?\n\nThere are plenty here on The Suffolk coast trisher. We have a Kittywake colony out on the water cooling rigs in the sea. Our fields at the back has a flock of herring gulls that sun themselves and they call from our roof tops and it echoes down the chimney. I love the sound and they never bother us for food.\n\nThey've been here, perpetrating nuisance on my washing! We are inland, so they have no business here!! Now that you mention it, though, they were often around the school, about a quarter of a mile away, but didn't usually get this far.\n\nWould your DS like them back?\n\nTrisher They are all by my house here by the promenade on The Wirral, they strut their stuff down on the green dips some are so big they are quite scary really,last week I saw 4 of them perched on the roof of the house opposite they where very vocal to say the least I haven't noticed any decrease in their numbers.\n\nWheniwasyourage I think he's very pleased to be rid of them. He did say it was being able to hear the birds singing that first alerted him because it was usually drowned out by seagull screams. So I think you can keep them!!\n\ntanith that's interesting there is a golf course about a mile away from me.I might go and see if it's full of them. But just realised golf has started again so maybe they will be on the move.\n\nA lot of them are in Blackburn in Lancashire as we have people who will put food down on the ground to feed the pigeons, birds of the crow family, seagulls and rats. I wish people could see the link between putting food on the ground and the amount of rats around. And they drive to the area round where I live to do this, not even in their own back yard.\n\nWe live outskirts of Liverpool in a leafy area they are always around but not really a nuisance. Lately though they are landing on the ground and fighting over something they have found. They don't usually land in the road or our gardens just fly above and land on the meadow in the park on our doorstep. We only have one takeaway half a mile away but it's been closed since the virus started. Maybe they have come in land more to have a better chance of finding food.\n\nThere seem to be less in our area.\n\nA couple of days ago my two dogs were in the garden enjoying their beef rib bones and one dog decided to come in and have a drink of water. He was just about to return to his bone and I was looking out of the kitchen window when a large seagull swooped into the garden and took his beef rib bone. It was quite a sight this seagull with large bone in it’s mouth, he had to land on the fence before he took flight again, so I don’t know how far the seagull got with it. I had visions of someone being hit by a flying bone.\n\nThe poor dog spent ages scouring the garden looking for his bone, my other dog was totally oblivious of the seagull visitor as he was concentrating on his fixated on his bone.\n\nThey're here. Someone nearby feeds them and they do their business on our car after their dinner.\n\nActually, I do remember when they used to frequent the rubbish tips years ago before we recycled our food more. Perhaps they still do?\n\nThere are usually quite a few on the Thames where I live, although lately we have been walking in Bushy Park not along the river. Now I come to think of it they aren't as prolific in the park ponds, where quite a few species of waterfowl have hatched young. I have seen them at all of late a Good thing!\n\nMy late parents retired to the Sussex coast and my mum was always complaining they grew to the size of chickens, probably an exaggeration, but were nevertheless a damn nuisance. As others have stated, lost their source of food, probably finding dive bombing in on hapless chip munchers is fast becoming a thing of the past for them! maybe as a consequence they won't be supersized for the foreseeable future!\n\nSeagulls have been in the fields round here while farmers have been ploughing. Ploughing is pretty much over now, though, no I’m not sure where they’ll move on to.\n\nRedtop, your poor doggy! Years ago when we had a dog, she spotted a mouse when we were out on a walk. It disappeared into a hole in the hedge bank and that was that. However, she returned to that spot and looked for the mouse every single time we revisited that area, even though we didn’t go there very often. How do dogs remember?"
