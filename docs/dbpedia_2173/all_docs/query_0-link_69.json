        "text": "Such a high concentration of attractions means that Senate Square is an important part of most city tour, which typically include round-trip transfers to save you the stress of taking public transport. Private tours and hop-on hop-off bus rides allow you to personalize your itinerary, while inclusive packages such as the Helsinki Card—which proves ideal for families and budget-conscious travelers—come with discounted access to attractions and unlimited use of public transport.\n\nThe centrally-located square is accessible by foot, tram, or bus. It’s also a convenient 10-minute drive from the cruise terminal, making it a popular stop on shore excursions designed to maximize limited time in Helsinki. If taking the metro, the nearest station is the University of Helsinki, located on Line 1.\n\nDon’t miss the Sound of the Senate Square, which has been ringing out since 2005. The sound installation is a modern composition, based on the classic European glockenspiel, and reverberates throughout the square for five minutes from from 5:49pm each day.\n\nSenate Square’s oldest building was completed in 1757, over 50 years before Alexander I of Russia made Helsinki the new Finnish capital. However, it’s Alexander I’s nephew, Alexander II, who is commemorated in the middle of the square. The statue was erected in 1894, when Finland was still a Russian territory, in recognition of the assassinated Tsar’s relatively progressive reforms, which had allowed Finland to strengthen its national autonomy.\n\nLikely to Sell Out\n\nBased on our booking data and information from the provider from the past 30 days, this experience is likely to sell out through Viator."
