        "text": "History\n\nThe band's first release, Julia EP was a theme record focused around the life and death of Julia, a character created by Jukka and Johannes. It gained many good reviews, most of them praising the young band's promising song writing and Jukka's exceptional voice.\n\nIn 2003 the band recorded their debut album, Ivory Tower at Soundtrack Studios in Helsinki. Kaj was replaced by Miska on bass. The album was released in May and the band started their first European tour.\n\nTheir second album Red Lights, White Lines was recorded and mixed between June and July 2004 in Fascination Street Studio in Örebro, under producers Jens Borgen and Jonas Olsson. The album was mastered at cutting room in Stockholm by Thomas Eberger. Red Lights, White Lines was released in Finland and Italy in 2004 and later in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Portugal and Japan in 2005. By the summer of 2005 the album was sold out and re-released in the same fall with new cover art work.\n\nTheir third album One Minute Too Late was released in Finland on 18 October 2006. Miska left the band and was replaced by Jore. The album's debut single New Day was released on 20 September 2006 and on its second week reached number 1 on Finland's YleX most wanted chart.\n\nAlbums\n\nIvory Tower (Fullsteam 2003)\n\n1.
