        "meta_description": "6 reviews and 26 photos of HOLIDAY INN \"I did not look at the Yelp reviews before booking my hotel. I did look at reviews elsewhere though. Once I checked in on Yelp and noticed the multiple bad reviews I was a bit nervous. But as you can see I gave the hotel 5 stars! First, I'm known for being a critical person, so 5 stars from me is extremely high. The 5 stars is relative to other places I have stayed in Europe and the US. \n\nSo let's get started... The hotel interior seems to have been updated since many of the previous reviews. The inside is fresh and welcoming, but does retain traditional Holiday Inn familiarity. There is a business center area in the lobby, interactive large screen e-concierge, Fussball table, kids games and books, and bar area. The front desk staff were warm and welcoming each time I interacted with them. My room was beyond expectations (disclaimer - I had an executive room) for the price and for Europe. It was about the size of a US Holiday Inn room and bathroom, but with additional accents that made it feel much more lush. The storage space was also plentiful with three closets for hanging and multiple other storage areas for flat items. My view of the bustling Helsinki streets included the train and bus station too. There are male and female saunas available (which I did not use) and a small gym. \n\nThe breakfast was bountiful and delicious. They must have updated since previous reviews. The restaurant was well decorated and look recently updated. The options were more than plentiful and outdid the previous hotels. They included local Finnish favorites as well as traditional holiday inn elements (pancake machine). But this pancake machine comes with jam, syrup, sugar, chocolate sauce, powdered sugar, and whipped cream options! Breakfast was included with my room night or would have been 20 Euros. \n\nLocation - I stayed my first two nights closer to Senate Square and thought the Holiday Inn would be too far from the center city. But was I wrong - one street over (two blocks) is Stockmann's which was an easy walk, even for someone culturally trained not to walk much. From the hotel you have multiple shopping areas within sight and within a 4 block radius. Senate Square is also not that far. If you are riding the tram everywhere, then you're not far from anything! The hotel is directly in front of the airport bus pickup/drop off and I could see it from my room. The main train station is also adjacent to the hotel. \n\nI only stayed one night, but could have definitely stayed for a month quite happily with the space and the staff. If I return to Helsinki this is my hotel of choice.  (My first two nights were paid by my host, but I checked the website and the rate at the HI was actual equal or less depending on the HI rate category you choose. I can say the HI was much much much more well appointed then my first hotel.) Good job!\"",
