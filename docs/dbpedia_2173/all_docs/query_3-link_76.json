Are you afraid of the dark, Or are you afraid of the light? Does it feel like your life was planned Before you even touched the ground? Your closest ones, They were Brutus, They stabbed you in the back. It's you who keeps on abusing me, Who lies right into my face, Who stole my reality, My own worst enemy. How could you ever be so cruel? Think of everything that we've been trough. That you take a step, Doesn't mean I take too. Why do you Brutus? You think that it's something you can't handle. All the lies 'bout the everlasting grace. You close your eyes and scream so loud, So that you can't hear the angels cry for help. Everybody knows that Elvis died on burgers. In an emergency it's my favorite turn-off. I gotta, I gotta learn it the hard way, That's the only way. Should I stab because I love, Or because I hate? It's you who keeps on abusing me, Who lies right into my face, Who stole my reality, My own worst enemy. How could you ever be so cruel? Think of everything that we've been trough. That you take a step, Doesn't mean I take too. Why do you Brutus? You think that it's something you can't handle. All the lies 'bout the everlasting grace. You close your eyes and scream so loud, So that you can't hear the angels cry for help.\n\nBecome A Better Singer In Only 30 Days, With Easy Video Lessons!"
