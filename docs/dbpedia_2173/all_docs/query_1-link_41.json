        "text": "How would Jason and I wine and Dinyuan L.A. the true facts about goals? And what is the connection to Neil and Lou? It might just be Phillips. All this and more on a brand new last looks. Hit the theme! Hello people of earth and Neil Diamond completus. I'm your host Paul Livingston Seagull and welcome to How Did This Get Made. Last looks where you get to voice your issues on, you guessed it, Jonathan Livingston Seagull. And I know you got a lot of issues. Plus Jason and I will just chat about reality TV and our favorite LA activities, plus I'm going to reveal next week's movie and before we do any of that.\n\nLet me just give a big shout out, a huge shout out to Mark Granger for that opening theme, Mark, I loved it, it's great, I love all these last look songs. They're great. So much so that I thought that this group would be up to the challenge to create a brand new How did this get made theme? It's not something that can just be done. It's gotta be special. It's gotta be unique. It's gotta blow our fucking socks off.\n\nI guess knock would be the term but these will be blown off and you know what we've gotten a few submissions they're good but I don't know if they've got the goods. Jason and I will evaluate some of these songs on an upcoming last looks episode kind of steer our composers into a direction see how we're feeling about them but anyway I don't want that to dissuade you I don't want that to dissuade you. I don't want that pressure to be on you. I want you to create a song that you think is perfect for the show, and you can set it\n\nto How To Disget Made at EarWolf.com. You can also send in songs for the show, a just chat segment, or just the opening theme of Last Looks, just like Mark Granger did. Send them to How To Disget Made at EarWolf.com. And remember, they don't have to be long. As a matter of fact, I prefer if they weren't. People, how to disget made is going on tour. That's right. And just a few weeks, we will be in Portland,\n\nProvidence, New Haven, Connecticut, and Brooklyn, New York. That's right, from October 18th to the 21st, we're going to be in Portland, Rhode Island, New Haven, and Brooklyn. And then we're going to take a couple weeks off. And then we're going to come back and go to Chicago in Minneapolis. And that will be on November 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th. That's right. We're doing two-night residencies. Can you consider it a residency if it's only two nights? We're doing two- night residencies in Chicago and Minneapolis.\n\nWe're keeping it primarily on the Eastern Seaboard, but we would love to see you follow us from Maine all the way down to Brooklyn. Tickets are selling fast and that is exciting to me. Anyway, you want more information. You want to know where you can get those tickets. Go to hdtgm.com. As I speak, Averl is working hard to pick some amazing movies for all of these shows. And we will announce those movies on our website\n\nand social media as soon as those picks are locked in. But don't worry about that. Averl's got that. You get the ticket. We'll see what the show. I want you with a costume on, I want you coming with a second opinion, I want you with a notebook full of questions\n\nabout whatever movie we're picking because you the audience are a giant part of the show and every show is completely different. Anyway, before we dive into corrections and emissions, I want to give some love to the second opinion singers because, like I just mentioned, I want you to come with a second opinion song, right? And I'm consistently blown away by the level, the quality of the songs that we get at these live shows. And at the Jonathan Livingston Seagull show, We were blown away by these songs,\n\nand we felt like we had to share a few more of our favorite songs with you. So take a listen to these bangers from the Beacon Theater, and we'll be right back with corrections and omissions. Now it's time for a second, Abenions. I have often streamed tons of airborne flicks, Conair and Sky Captain, not to mention Birdemic. Then I met this girl, Johnny Livingston,\n\nand like Top Guns Maverick, I had tried to just felt the need for speed. Y'all this film was lit. That's my second opinion. You can talk, you're shit. Somehow I'll fly on. I have found my flock. They're right here at the beacon. And I'll go on Amazon and rate this film five stars.\n\nWow. Name? David Hensiegel. Thank you. Incredible. Wow. Wow.

OK, I'm a weirdo, flying on my own.\n\nJacob's lighter, heaven, or hell. Maybe me on marine bone, well, they said, I'll cast in my... ...on clear if I died, gathering my cult of birds in garbage beach city. Probably lots of seagulls died to make a shitty allegory. I said, come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me. Neal, diamond charts for brains, pretty sure fletcher's a zombie. Yeah!\n\nAmazing crowd work of music. Incredible. What's your name? Amazing crowd work of music. Incredible! What's your name? My name is Bianca Segal. Yeah! Bianca Segal! Next one up! Fantastic!\n\nWow, these are all stone co-bangers. Here we go. And now it's time for second! The pins. Watch how fast this eagle flies. I'm a freak. I will be ostracized. Your bird is now an outcast in his clan.\n\nYou'll be forced to watch me fly to distant lands. Oh, I'm just a goal. Oh, I'm just a goal. You'll force to watch me for the next 90 minutes of your life. Oh, I'm just a goal. Did you like this movie? Well, fuck you, it had no animal rights. Oh, I wanna fuck more in.\n\nOh, I want a fuck more in. Amazing, your name? Neil. Thank you, Neil. Great job for that. Thank you. Take us home. Take us home. Take us into the...\n\nEvery one of these has been better than the show. Amazing. And you didn't want us to do this movie. And you guys are all online being like, I hate second-apingian songs. I wish you would do a true song. Why would they do second-apingian songs? I would have gone to stood if I knew.\n\nAnd now it's time for second opinions. Oh! Tell me something, bird. Yeah! Did you know this movie was absurd? Or did you love it when Jonathan kept whispering? I log on to Amazon. Second opinion, Jonathan Livingson. I'm gonna rate five songs.\n\nCrash through the surface with single Jesus. He's faster than the speed of sound. In the outcast. In the outcast. We're part of the outcast now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Great. Wow. What's your name? Matthew John Seagull.\n\nOh, M.J.S. everybody. Wow. How did this go? How did this go? How did this go? Welcome back. Last week, we talked at length about Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a movie that discord user grayest-hound thinks could have had the tagline Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Put it on for your cat when they're home alone.\n\nYou know what? Honestly, I think a cat might be bored by this movie. Anyway, we had questions about this movie. And we talked about it for a very long time, but we realized that we might have missed a few things. So here is your chance to either set a straight, ask about something that we didn't even consider, or even fact check us if you must. It is now time for corrections and omissions.\n\nCorrections and omissions. Thank you, Bionic Limbs for that great theme song. Let's go to the Discord. B-M-L, a purported bird expert who attended the live show, writes in with some sequel insights. Though the goal filmed in the snow scene was unnaturally placed, their goals in general are not deterred by snow or cold weather, with some living in the Arctic and Arctic climates. We think of birds as flying south for the winter because of the cold, but in reality,\n\nmost birds are extremely cold tolerant and actually migrate because of the seasonal changes in food supply. So to be clear, yes, the goal on the snowy mountain definitely died, but from starvation not from hypothermia. By the way, that should be the ASPCA warning at the end of this film. Also, BML continues with a few other seagull inaccuracies. There was footage of distant goals doing loop deloops and barrels. However, goals do not naturally perform these maneuvers. This must have been shot using radio control models, presumably built by Art Shoe, credited in\n\nthe film for aerobatic aircraft. And in addition, goals do not dive below the water surface like GANITS or BOOBIES. That sequence appeared to use a model for the aerial dive as well and very upsettingly cut to a go forced underwater. Yeah, this movie was tough to watch, BML, but I appreciate that you brought some seagull truth to us. And a Beringston seagull as Choir Rights. Why is there so little human presence in this movie?\n\nWe see a landfill which indicates that humans are around and impacting their world. I'm surprised that human activity does factor in at all to the seagull's lifestyle or philosophy, but then again, I don't factor seagulls into mine. Maybe I should. And a barrington seagull, I got to love that. I got to love that you\n\nyou checked yourself. Jane Siegel writes, I love this by the way. Author Richard Bach, not this question, which I might love. I just love that everyone has SQLized their name. Author Richard Bach couldn't have been too unhappy with the portrayal of Siegel's in the film adaptation because he married the goal wrangler extraordinaire Leslie Parish after meeting during the making of the film. Now, here's a note from Scott. Scott comes and goes, well, Leslie Parish is the film's associate producer that director Hal Bartlett inexplicably demoted to researcher in the final credits.\n\nRichard and Leslie married in 1981, but divorced in 1999. So maybe honestly, he did it just to prank her. I think that that's what Scott's trying to prove. I mean, 81 to 99, not a bad run. Not a bad run at all. Let's go to the phones. Colin Segal, what do you got? Hey, Paul, this is Colin from Chicago, and I just finished listening to the Jonathan Booth's Incegal episode and I thought I'd give you some more information on the film that I got here from the books, the 50 worst films of all time and how they got that way. It's a book published in 1978, so it's a little out of date, but it does have an entire chapter devoted to Jonathan Booth's Incegal.\n\nAnd one thing it says here, it says, intending to cash in on the anticipated Seagull bandwagon, several manufacturers created new products relating to the film. These articles all bore the name and official insignia of the famed Seagull. The equipment included leisure footwear, bedsheets, autographed pillows, blankets, ready-made draperies, tablecloths, t-shirts, sweatshirts, tank tops, iron on patches, handcrafted copper enamel pins, handcrafted yarn, punch needle rug kits, stuffed toys, greeting cards, plaques, posters, keychains, puzzles, and a game devised by Mattel.\n\nI know how to play that game. Anyway, thanks for everything. Love the show. Bye. What? Are you telling me that I can find a Jonathan Livingston Seagull game on eBay? People. I need... Alright, I'm on eBay. I'm going to be on eBay right now. And autographed Pele's. Pele's. By who? Who? Richard Bach a Seagull I mean I once wants to a Star Trek convention in a dog from Boyd your did sign autographs they put his paw and ink I don't know if that was again a humane thing to do but wow Colin I need picks I need picks all right what do we got we got Jackie\n\nSeagull this is this is endlessly entertaining to me i got this is jackie from boston and i think i like johnathan with the seat and i like it because i thought as a religious allegory and like a hero's journey non-office is christmas is our third of the time i was the first food of both of them are trying to estate the suffering of their respective worlds, and to bartham\n\nthrough achieving enlightenment, that Jonathan through achieving perfect speed. But during this, Jonathan finds that constantly trying to go faster is only bringing him more suffering and pain, and only brings more suffering into the world. And both of them have to leave their societies at the consequences of this. So, Siddhartha has to leave or choose to leave voluntarily. And Jonathan has kicked out of, I guess, his civil kingdom,\n\nboth of them go into the wilderness and through that they experience various forms of violence and peace in the world. And Jonathan ultimately achieves his enlightenment through his supernatural experiences with Chang, who says her fixed speed not going faster, but already being there. Essentially telling him that constantly trying to go faster is actually preventing him from attaining enlightenment. And when Jonathan understands this, he achieves enlightenment and can fly with perfect speed. And all of a sudden, at the end of his hero's journey, like Siddhartha, having achieved enlightenment, Jonathan understands that his role is not to stay in Seagull\n\nNirvana like the other Seagulls who can find a perfect speed, but rather to return to Earth so that he can teach other Seagulls how to achieve perfect speed as well. Anyway, yeah, Jonathan Lillington Seagull is Berguta and enlightenment is perfect speed. Yes, you are completely correct. Jonathan is Buddha and his enlightenment is perfect speed. Yes, you are completely correct. Jonathan is Buddha and his enlightenment is perfect speed. I think you're right. I think that that's why we are having trouble kind of russing with the theme. It is about a state of mind, a zen state of mind. Well, you said it. I'm not gonna correct you. You're right. Jackie, you're right. What do I have to say? Add to it. I don't need to man-splain it.\n\nAll right. Next up, we have Morgan Seagull, the book expert from the episode. She was fantastic. So, Morgan, what else do you got to tell us? Hey, Paul. This is Morgan from the New York Jonathan Livingston Seagull Show. I just had a point of clarification on a question I had gotten from you all about the movie versus the book. So you had asked if the Seagulls had done the outer space in the movie, then I said no. And the issue is in the movie you see them flying through outer space that definitely did not happen in the book. In the book, what happens is Jonathan and his mentor just appear on what allegedly maybe another planet\n\nwith multiple sons. So there is no travel through space per se. They just arrived. That is all. Thank you. Whoa. Thank you for calling. Again, another person checking themselves, not going out there.\n\nYou did your best. We appreciated you out there and I love that you called in to say, you know what, I got it wrong. And that honestly is all that we're responsible for. We make a mistake. We come back in. We tell the truth and you know what, you're a okay. You're already where a okay, now you're AOK plus.\n\nBack to the discord, Hobo bot writes, I might have missed it, but did anyone guess as to why Jonathan is so intent on 62 miles per hour specifically? I think the writer's converted units for an American audience since 100 kilometers per hour equals 62 miles per hour and 100 is a nice round number, which brings up a lot more questions like why was Jonathan originally using the metric system? Why didn't they just say 100 miles per hour? Why were kilometers involved at all since the writer is American? You know what, Hobobot, I think I do have an answer for this, because the pilot was an aviator, and I believe that kilometers is how you would\n\ncalculate speed as a aviator. Again, it's a good guess, I'm not sure. I don't do one of those people who have a jet private airplane flying around. That's not up. I leave that to the pilots. I don't need to be that as a hobby. I don't like anyone who has a hobby of flying a plane. OK, Grumble Bottom Rites.\n\nGrumble Bottom. You broke the Sequel thing. OK, Grumble Bottom Rites. Re-flight speed. No damn go is going 60 miles per hour. Gear Falcons can hit 60 miles per hour on a street flight. Peragon Falcons, the fastest animal on the planet can hit 240 miles per hour during a power dive, but only go about 50 during a street flight.\n\nGoals, even the bigger, faster ones like herring Goals, go maybe around 20 miles per hour. They are nimble flyers, but they are not fast. Boom, grumble bottom, hit it, hard. No one researched birds. It was an allegory. Johnny unusual rights. So Chang is like a low key, orientalist archetype stereotype, right? I mean all the other birds have Western names except for the wise and master character who is a bird\n\nHe doesn't have a grotesque accent. Thank God, but I feel like calling him Chang in the 70s is playing on the idea that people of other cultures like Asian are somehow more spiritually in tune. I mean Johnny unusual. Yeah, I mean we see that all the time. And I think it was a very, like I think if we're going to this idea of like, Zen and Buddhism, and I think that of course, of course it was. Of course. BML of course, Charms in with one more thing here. It's funny that Hummingbirds are the only type of bird that June likes, given her disdain for the squabbling and fighting of goals, she might be dismayed to learn that hummingbirds are among the most aggressive cutthroat creatures in the animal kingdom. The males use their\n\nbills to stab other males and to fence, they parry like their sword fighters. Sometimes knocking birds off a perch, some hummingbirds even have hooked beaks with serrations that look like sharks teeth that can be used to tear out other birds feathers. Whoa, BML kind of come in hard at the hummingbirds. I also want to add light goals, pigeons often get a bad rap as well. And light goals, they are in fact highly skilled fires. Whose ubiquitous presence is a testament to their evolutionary success. So, as bird expert Dr. Alan Grant says in Jurassic Park, try to show a little respect. And you know what? I'm going to show you some respect here, BML, for bringing the heat\n\nwith your bird facts. You are our winner. This week for Corrections and omissions and you get this amazing song from Joel Terry for that song. Remember if you want to submit an alt movie tagline or chime in with your own thoughts about the latest episode. Hit up the discord at discord.gg slash HDTGM or call us at 619. Paul asks, stick around. Jason Manzookus will join me after the break to chat about reality TV, our favorite LA activities and music that we are currently loving. A beer I back. You know, every Monday is a chance to look back at episodes from How To Discaught Made History. This week we re-released after Earth with Paul F. Tompkins. And now to tip our hat to the Seagulls. We are re-releasing.\n\nBird Demick. That's right. We're Dalienkivik. Whitney Moore. They join us. It's one of our early, if not one of our first Largo episodes every Monday, a brand new, old episode. Can that be possible as a Noxymoron? Maybe it is. Anyway, don't worry about that because now it is time for Jason\n\nand I to open up the helpline and answer some listener questions. This week's theme comes to us from Lazybones, play are back. I wanted to let you know that you asked for it and we made it which is right now in the T public store there is a parents night out shirt. How did this get made? Parents night out shirt. So people who come to see how did this get me live. So does it say like does it say parents night out see how did this get me live. So does it say like, does it say parents night out at how did this get me live? Or? It does not say at how did this get me made.\n\nAnd I think that was because we were not on it, but the design was so good that we just like the parents night out element. We could probably throw on the, I think we should throw in at how did this get, even if it's little tight. Yeah, a little one on the bottom. Just so it's so that you know it's for all\n\nthat you're getting a sitter to come see us but it's it's also parents night out it's a good looking shirt all right we'll get for good looking parents we love the so if you're an ego parent out there don't wear the shirt wear it don't wear it all right let's go to the phones uh Scott what do we got? Hey Colin Jason this is Jacob from New York. I've been listening to quite a few years and recently I've heard you all mention Survivor on the podcast a few times, so I thought I'd finally call it and say hi. I actually competed on a season of Survivor a couple years ago. It went really badly, like really badly, but I'm most happy to answer any questions you might have about the show.\n\nAnyways, I actually work in casting and development now for reality shows in particular. So my question for you guys is if I heard you were the host and on scripted series, what kind of show was you wanted to be? I know you both love alone, maybe you go survival centric, maybe like a classic pyramid kind of trivia or maybe some empty stuff like match game I'm just curious and and let me know I'll get started on the pitch right away I have a good one oh my god wow I so Paul I'm not I'm not a survivor person but yes recognize this person do you know who it is I would be very survivor person, but do you recognize this person? Do you know who it is?\n\nI would be very honest and say, I don't recognize him, but that's because we haven't watched all the seasons yet. We have just been digging in. So we've watched a lot. I have not seen a season, but now I'm excited to maybe move this up to the top. Wow, a survivor contestant is a fan of the show.\n\nPretty cool. Pretty cool. So this is a good question. Have you ever had any interest in hosting like a reality show type of thing? I have one idea that they could never make that I always been. Okay. Go. What's that? I would love to do a survivor style show or survivor meets American Ninja warrior, but the premise would be die hard. One person with a paintball gun having to get through a building using what their wits to escape. Like they're needed to be like, there needs to be challenges. But I think hand to hand fighting\n\nwould be part of it. I also believe that paintball guns would be part of it. Like I think you could do a bunch of different elements of it and there have to be like some puzzles to solve and things like that. But I've always thought that I would love to see how somebody could figure out a I love that that's a great that's a great that's a great pitch. I so much so that I hesitate to allow you to put it in the episode. Like you should, you should keep that. No, no, I don't know if you should. It's a great idea.\n\nI do agree with you. It's a difficult to execute idea. It's a show that feels to me like lawsuits would be rolled in. I think what's the thing is, the thing about an American Ninja Warrior is what you're showcasing is the how adept people are at the challenge and the skills being put in front of the, they need to execute the course, rather the obstacle course versus things like survivor or these other shows are personality based. These are really stories of these people.\n\nThe challenges are there and they are kind of hiccups and hurdles in the road, but really, it is just to force everybody to be more themselves or to dig whatever all the interpersonal drama is. I feel like for a lot of those shows. A hundred percent, I think the thing I really found about Survivor that I love is when they do the merge, when the tribes merge, that's when you start to really fall in love with these characters because\n\nit is. It's so many characters. You're getting fun moments and you're making opinions, but when they're all in there and you really get to see how they're working, that's what I like. And that, to me, is alone. You really start to see a person's personality. Thank you. For a while, after a loan, they were doing like these,\n\nsome guy was like talking to the contestants and doing like, wrap-ups and what did you think and this and that. And I was like, oh, I'd like to do that. You know what I mean? Like, I don't, I don't want to go out and like host a, you know, survivor type. I don't want to go out.\n\nBut there is something about having, like the conversation you and I have, you and I had with Wonea. Yes. It was great. I really enjoyed that. Anyway, I can't really think of anything that I have that I would like to do,\n\nyou know, my own idea or something like that, but I will say this gets to a little bit of something I've been watching and you can decide and tell me whether we should include this or not. But something I've been watching. And you can decide and tell me whether we should include this or not, but something I've been watching a bunch of lately on, specifically on YouTube, frankly, is, and I would love to do it, is, and I'm curious if you, what your opinion is of this show,\n\nI think, I feel like maybe you have one, is Taskmaster. Oh, yeah. I mean, look, I love that. That's a competition reality show. And it's fucking hilarious. Oh, yeah. I mean, look, I love that. That's a competition reality show. And it's fucking hilarious. I love it. Boy, the show is a fucking blast.\n\nAnd they're a former, friend of the, I mean, not former friend of the pot, but friend of the pot, former guest, Ashling Bees on a season, Nishkumar's on a, like there's great people, James A. Caster, who we've talked about before. Oh, I love James. And his famous podcast that I believe\n\nwe called Last Meal, but I believe is called Off Menu, but I'm going to continue to call it. I'm going to continue to call Last Meal and ask that James and the rest of the guys on the podcast, please change the name. Please change the name of the podcast and what it's about to better suit what we talked about before. Yes, we don't look like idiots. Don't make us look like stupid. Make your show what we described. Thank you I I love I mean I love that show and I still get tweets about it But I love Taskmaster as it's really I Don't know it's it's a smart smart show and that's a kind of\n\nI really show yes We we created a show for unspooled which was like a pop culture show that had similar tasks. It was all like, it was basically creating comedy bits. And, you know, I like that, like where it's like, it's more creative than a right or wrong answer or just a task. Yes, it is. It's fun. And people are encouraged to break the rules and solve the puzzle in ways that are comedically rewarding rather than the right way to do a thing. It's all, it is, it is challenges given by comedians to a panel of comedians and it's almost always absurdly like failure based and hilarious.\n\nAnd to me, what I am excited about, and you just reminded me about this, is I think I need to start showing my son's junior taskmaster. No, it existed. A spin-off, right? So it's not cool. Nine to 11 are on this one. Oh, that's a great one. That's a great one.\n\nThat's a great one. Yeah. So I need to, I have to figure that out. I got to figure out how I can get this from my kids because I think that they would go bananas for it. Yeah, I like that too. I will say, if you want to watch it, if you want to check it out, I would just, just for strike sake, direct you to the YouTube channel.\n\nGreat. It has quite a lot of long clips, individual tasks, and in whole episodes for that matter. So it's all there. All right. A lot of it. Yeah, and I feel like I don't understand why the UK has embraced funny panel shows\n\nand America seems to always be behind on that. Well, they've had them forever. that's like those are staples of british you know night television is chat shows and panel shows and we just simply don't have it here we don't have those comedy forward game shows panel shows chat shows uh... they we had them at certain uh... times i can't admit night\n\nyeah or like we did like bad versions of them We had them at certain times when they got midnight. Yeah, or like we did like bad versions of them. And I feel like there is, I don't know, there is like something about. I have a feeling. Yeah, I have a feeling. But you go ahead. No, no, go ahead. There's something uniquely American about needing to win.\n\nAnd so I feel like the American versions of those shows are actually too focused on the winning. And the British shows are really just focused on goofing around and bullshitting and roasting each other and busting balls and being clever and funny in a way that there is something that is uniquely American about like, well, I want a win. I gotta, I'm gonna contest that point because I want a win, you know what I mean? Well, that to me feels like, you know, I think you hit it now on the head of like, I think that people believe that,\n\nthe show isn't feel complete until someone has won our loss. Yes. And until there is clear, a clear winner who is the best. You know, and that really is a that really is a bummer because to me, it's like, aren't we just laughing at this? This is the thing that this is what we want to see. Right? Oh, yeah. Come on. It's a bullet. The show's really funny. I've been really I've been trying to while we're on strike, while we're, you know, we're we're not talking about stuff here. You know, we're not talking about this stuff. We're involved in're not talking about this stuff we're involved in\n\nor the other stuff that's around. I'm like, you know, I'm trying to like watch stuff that is not even part of those silos. I know. I love that. I mean, I've been trying to do similar stuff and just try to open my mind, see different things. And you know, by the way, if you like Taskmaster,\n\nthere's like two podcasts. Two. Oh, I didn't know that. Like a official podcast? Like their podcast? Yes. Taskmaster, the podcast, and then Taskmaster, the people's podcast. Nice.\n\nOkay. So yeah, there we go. I like that. And so they basically people can call up and disagree with what they've seen on the show. I love it. But that, no, that kind of stuff is, I really enjoy like, and before everybody freaks out, we are well aware that there was an American version of Taskmaster.\n\nBut that doesn't work. We're not talking about that, it didn't succeed, so we know. So go ahead. But that's the whole thing, it's like it didn't succeed because I feel like when things make the switch, they wreck it. Like something about it is wrecked.\n\nLike I love this, well, there's another a British show called Impostors. And I talked about my love of that show Impostors. And then America did it. And it was a complete, I just felt it was, like just not fun. Oh, I've never even heard of this before. Oh, okay, got it.\n\nOh, Jason, get on Imp Posters is another BBC show. A BBC show that no one thought was gonna be good. And it's great. Got it, okay. Yeah, they just, they really have a set of shows that occupy a space that we don't appear to be interested in. Culturally, those type of shows, you know what I mean?\n\nWe're not, we don't end up comedy yet. We love podcasts. It has the same elements of all the things that we gravitate towards as a culture. But like when it's positioned as like a talk show, chat show, but they even do a funny news show. I was watching when I was in the UK like a couple of months ago.\n\nIt was hilarious. It was great. It was like, oh, it's like, they're talking about news. They're making up news people are goofing on news Yeah, and it's like it kind of feels to me like what we did with best-wegever which Shockingly somebody just reached out to me to tell me it was a 20th anniversary of the premiere of that show Well, I was like wow. Yeah That's not crazy. I mean I can't even believe it But but that kind of idea like oh, we're just talking about funny stuff.\n\nThese are funny people talking about stuff. And even with that, the big switch that they made was they eventually switched it to a one person host. And Paul of Tompkins, one of the funniest, I thought he killed on that show, but I think one of the reasons why the ratings dropped had nothing to do with Paul F. It just had to do with people liked multiple people chatting. Just yes, exactly. And I think that show, I think the format change almost would have been better served\n\nby the group all being together to talk about this stuff. Right. You know what I mean? Rather than, rather than winnowing it onto a single voice, to instead have these five voices, but instead of having them each individually doing their bits, have them collectively as a group just bullshitting around and the same jokes, the same feeding off of each other. That would, people would enjoy that.\n\nIt's so much more fun. I mean, that's what we, That's what Gordon was trying to do with his show by, by basically doing Graham Norton's show. Yeah. And I still think that people respond to it in a weird way. I always remember, I think back to Jimmy Kimmel when he first started doing monologues. I used to love his monologues because they were like,\n\nit was like, talk soup. It was just very like, oh, here's a funny clip. Here's a thing. Here's a this. You know, it wasn't a traditional mold, and he's always very funny, and I feel like, but then you get forced into these patterns. And, no, no, every talk show needs a monologue, and it needs to go here.\n\nIt's got to look like this, and you, it has to feel like, like as if the Architecture of the show is what people want not the tone and personality of the host. Yeah, you know I know it's such an interesting It is interesting but I'm glad that we have a lot of great British shows to kind of catch up. Yeah All right, so let's hear one more call. Let's do it.\n\nHi, Jason and Paul. This is Morgan calling from Brooklyn. So this October, I'll be taking myself on a solo trip to LA to celebrate my birthday. I've been several times before, so I don't feel like I need to jam back my schedule or hit all the big sites. And I really value getting recommendations from people that live in the cities I'm visiting. I'm really open to anything, but I love live music, comedy, all types of food, record and book shopping.\n\nSo my question for you both is, if you were to think about your perfect long weekend in LA, what would be on the agenda? As I know, last episode you had a question from Kaylyn, who was also from Brooklyn and having her post-breakup new England summer. I had a very similar post-breakup new England summer. I had a very similar post-breakup New Jersey summer, so Kaylen, if you are looking for a fellow newly single friend when you get that to Brooklyn, maybe the folks at How It Does Get Me could put us in touch. Thank you guys, take care. Wow! Oh my God!\n\nPlease, please can we make this happen? That is, like, again, I love our fans. What a great message. I hope that Kaylen and Morgan have a do-link up. can we make this happen that is like again I love our fans. What a great message. I hope that Caitlin and Morgan have a do link up and have wonderful stories to call in with and tell us. Meet up on the Discord because that's a safe way to do it.\n\nAnd you can go there and that is Caitlin. By the way, I know that I just want to jump back for a second. You know, we were talking about Taskmaster. It's one of everyone to know that Taskmaster has their own streaming service. So you can go right to the money, right to them. Oh, they're on. They literally have their own, you can get everything,\n\nand international versions also on there. So just a good way to throw money out of not to streamers. And you can do that. Yeah, if you're looking, maybe it would be a good idea right now to say maybe stop some of your subscriptions to To streamers that might not be putting stuff out that you want right now and maybe give it to give it elsewhere 99 a month. Okay, so Question is this\n\nLooking for travel recommendations. Is that what we're hearing? I think it's yeah LA specific travel record a long weekend in if you had a long weekend in LA and it wasn't to service tourism type stuff or what would you want to be doing? I mean, for me, I'm gonna definitely make sure that I'm hitting a great sushi spot. Oh yeah, what do you got? I'm gonna look here. Give me one second to find you like a couple of.\n\nI'll throw a couple, why don't I throw a couple of things out because this gives me a little bit of an opportunity to shout out a few of the things that are on my list of things because just because Morgan mentioned record stores, I will of course recommend Amiba Records. Of course. And as well, go ahead with that. It's a different version now, right?\n\nIt's not really moved. It's moved. It's still Amiba. It's just moved to a different location. So it's still right there in Hollywood. You know, big, incredible record store. Another one of the, you know, if you're looking for things to watch right now, the Amiba has a show on their YouTube channel called What's in My Bang, where artists come on and go through the store and pick out records and DVDs and all sorts of stuff. And then they talk about it for 10 or 15 minutes,\n\nall the selections they made and what they like about them. And I've done one, they've done comedians, Matt Berry did one, and then all sorts of bands have done them. Recently, that band, Mama did one, always did one, tennis did one recently there's a bit a bunch that are that are terrific absolutely worth watching though what's in my bag series from amoeba records and I will also throw out merge records the record company that the that has like that super chunk started a mac and\n\nLaura from super chunk and they put out the new pornographers and destroyer and all sorts of great bands they also have now a youtube show where people go through their library and pull records that are meaningful and talk about them and that's pretty great as well so i love that i also love how they do that for the criterion closet too. It's great when people can do it. That's a great one. And there's a, in that respect, Paul,\n\nthere is a French video store called ConeBini. I don't know, K-O-N-B-I-N-I, they have a YouTube channel where they do similar to the criterion like closet video. It'll just, but it'll be like Wes Anderson walking through this. One of the last video stores left in Paris and he picks out for 40 minutes. He picks out, you know, two dozen movies and talks about them.\n\nIt's fantastic. I love that. All right. Well, speaking of movies, I'm going to hit two good movie spots for long weekend in LA, depending on when you're here. One is if you're here, you know, even all the way through October, Sanesbia is amazing. It's an outdoor movie experience in a cemetery. It's a big fucking fun night out.\n\nPeople get dressed up, they picnic, and you're in a cemetery watching great movies, and people really go all out to be there. And if that's not used. But you also don't have to. No, you can also just go, you don't have to dress up. If you want to just go and watch whatever movie they're showing, you can do that.\n\nIt's like blast. And they normally have like special guests. It's fun things. The other thing if you don't, if that's too much, is check out Videots, which is a video store, a num, not for profit video store, the last video store in LA. Ultimately, that has a collection of VHSs and DVDs\n\nthat you'll never find anywhere and a big, beautiful, beautiful new theater that is playing so many great movies. It's hard to keep up. I actually was talking to them the other day. I was like, I think I'm gonna do an Elaine May thing with them where like every first Monday of month it's gonna be like a\n\nElaine May movie so like for four months do a little thing like that. Mikey and Mikey. Mikey, Mikey, you leave. I knew Lee's heartbreak. Ishhtar, Ishhtar, do them all. I mean, there's five. What is your five of them? Four or five, yeah, that's it. You should, and for J, but if you do that, you should also link all of the blank check episodes that they did with all those movies.\n\nI just live that. I do read that I do all so great So good. I'll throw out a couple of other Because the Morgan mentioned bookstores. So I'll throw out For comics and graphic novels and so forth secret headquarters, which is now located in at water village new location. It's great. Yep Skyline books on Skyline or skylight skylight. I'm so sorry. Yeah. Skylight books on on Vermont is a great independent bookstore that's worth checking out. As well as the last bookstore downtown giant like like a crazy old school like it's in downtown LA, it's just a multi-level space,\n\njust packed to the gills with books. This is a cool spot to be in. I'm trying to think of like, oh, and like, you mentioned comedy, so of course, check out the Largo schedule, check out the, the Elysian theater in Frogtown, Dynasty typewriter in, I think,\n\nis it in Koreatown, where's Dynasty? Yeah, Koreatown, that makes sense. I'll give out those sushi places too. The place that I really love, and I couldn't remember the exact name of it, Goesmart. Goesmart is in a strip mall in Kanoga Park, and it's a little far to get to,\n\nbut it truly is the best sushi I've ever had. There's no physical menu there, okay? And you just go and get what they're gonna give you. And there's a new place in Atwater Village that June just went to called Mori Hero. Mori Hero, M-O-R-I-H-I-R-O, that's apparently fantastic. But that's a little bit more of a upscale,\n\na full Japanese dining experience. Gozemart is like, sushi. Great. Extreme. Love it. Okay, that sounds awesome. I don't know. I'm trying to think of other, I mean, there's a million music venues.\n\nI tend to go to the smaller ones, like shows that are playing it like Zebulon or you know some some more. What's the place we saw mannequin pussy? Because that place is great too or maybe is it the ballroom mannequin? Is it like a. Oh, Tearogram. It's a Tearogram. That's a great. That's a great. That's a beautiful room sounds great. Tearogram Zebulon. I'm trying to think to think, oh, there's a website. There's a thing I think it's called, oh, my rockness is the, is the website and you can select LA.\n\nThere's a, they do it for a couple of different cities and it aggregates all the concerts that are happening in that town, including like, you know, how did this get made at Largo will be listed. But you know, the rest of it is comedy,\n\nanything that's a venue has is on this, it's aggregated onto this one website. So it's pretty good, you know. I like that. Also, if you're in town on a weekend, long weekend, we're talking about the Smorgasburg, which is down in downtown LA, just it's a vendor specific awesome, you know,\n\nfood, everything, it's great. It's just a foot, it's just, it's just a fun way to hang out in downtown LA. You get a little taste of a lot of different places. And then depending on what weekend of the month you're here, if it happens to fall on the weekend when the Rose Bowl flea market is happening out at the Rose Bowl on a Sunday, you're not going to get a better Sunday afternoon than getting a coffee and wandering around a gigantic flea market for hours. I mean, that's wonderful. That's such a good. And I'm going to, you know, say this again, as someone who's been really enjoying this, if you're here during the soccer season,\n\ngoing to see the women's soccer league out here, it's amazing. That stadium is fantastic. It's L-A-F-C is the male version, and Angel City is the women's soccer team. And I've been to both. I love them both. I have to say that they- I've never haven't been. Oh, Angel City games are the most fun.\n\nI'll go say if you're going sometime. Okay, I'll go. Oh, you will love it. It's really, really fun. As a matter of fact, Messi was just in town here, and he just played this weekend. But Angel City, they're playing the stadium here. It's, the stadium is just beautiful.\n\nIt's just like, it's just outside an LA, right, by the museums and stuff like that. Ooh, that's great. Yeah, I love it. I'm trying to think of anything else. And I don't know if this is a spoiler, but we have Messi on next week's episode of the show, right? Yeah, he's gonna be talking about it's so weird.\n\nHe just wanna talk about the new saw movie. We're like, we don't really do new movies, but he's like, I want this. He's really held his spot. He called up. Messi is a huge, how did this get made for him? Oh my God, like, you know that he, whenever he scores a goal he screams G.O.\n\nStorm. Yes. And that way if you are if you are a professional athlete professional athlete and you listen to this podcast get in touch get in touch we need to know what you're up to and when you score a goal or get a home run in your sport we need you to start shouting how did this get made catchphrase? I'm down with that. I mean, you know, it was a Baba buoy at God I don't want that. I don't want people. No, I don't want you to be in the crowd No, that's what I'm saying. Yes. Yeah, exactly. I wanted to be the person themselves. Yes, exactly\n\nLike when the US opens on like the the when they, different players have like a little thing that they do. And I feel like, you know, that would be perfect. You know, you have a whole year to come up with the next thing you can want. Can you imagine if you are an athlete and every time you score or do whatever is impactful in your sport, and you just started screaming, geostorm, big, loud, loud and long and then the audience, the live stadium started doing it as well. Come on or if you got a whole stadium of 35,000 people to just start screaming, fuck the moon, fuck the moon. Fuck the moon would be the best thing to be yelling out loud. Just that's, I love that pin, we made that pin. Okay, Jason, I feel like we gave her a bunch of great things to do in LA. I think so.\n\nI think there's some pretty good recommendations, especially if you are, those are all local. Yes, those are, that's not like, oh, come and see the Hollywood sign. So there's a lot to do, but I hope this gave you a good enough start. Can I just shout out a few things if you don't mind, Paul? Yeah. One of the last times we talked about this, we were talking about, you would ask me specifically,\n\nI think, how do you find new music or about finding new music or so forth. And we were talking about some stuff. And I mentioned how much record stores were so integral and impactful to me for finding new music and getting turned on to new stuff and specifically I mentioned Aquarius Records in San Francisco, iconic record store, RIP, and I asked when the documentary called It Came From Aquarius is coming out, I got an answer and the producers sent me a link to watch the movie.\n\nSo I have watched the documentary. It was incredible. It made me so deeply nostalgic and so kind of melancholy for the end of this kind of, I even wrote stuff down from watching it because there was an element to it, which I was like exactly what you and I were talking about. You know, is what the documentary is so much about.\n\nIt's about creating community around music, around all of this excitement for discovery. Not just, hey, here's the new pornographers record, but hey, you just walked through the door. Do you want a record that is just Neil Hamburg or making prank phone calls? Or do you want a four-CD box set that is just shortwave radio broadcasts from the 50s? Like, how can I give you weird or stuff? Anyway, there's a couple of great quotes in it. One of the guys says, it felt like a tourist attraction for weirdos. And I was like, yes, that's what it was like.\n\nAnd somebody else, it says, it's a maniac store. And that to me, I was like, that's exciting. When you walk in someplace and you know, and Amiba gets at this, it's just much bigger. You, what's in there is not just the records you know about, but a tremendous amount of stuff you have no idea and it's just waiting for you to discover. Well, the way that I,\n\nthe way that I always experienced Amiba, was something that was so interesting. I was in San Francisco, I'd never been before. It was like, my first kind of solo trip alone and I was walking around, I heard, maybe it was great. I went there and and I found these VHS tapes of like celebrity bloopers and they were not put out by anybody\n\nSpecific and it was CDs and videotapes. It just seemed like they were almost homemade and it was just a collection of the weirdest shit and I was like, oh my God, I have this and I was so excited, it was like Orson Wells outtakes and you know, and just like, you know, William Shattner, like kind of yelling at somebody. Like it was, it felt like I found this kindred spirit. It's like where I found like the unared pilot of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\n\nOh wow. You know, like stuff like that. Like it was like a so fun. Yeah, and that's what these stores used to be like. And the fact that they're gone, the kind of place that is lampooned in a way or kind of, you know, made fun of a bit in high fidelity when, you know, John Q.SaxSaxx, I'm about to sell five copies\n\nof the Beta Band 3 EPs just by playing one song, but there is an element of, the Aquarius records, there's a big chunk of the documentary where they talk about the list, because every two weeks they would send out an email list of all little blurbred reviews of all this new music, and it was so well written and so compelling\n\nthat you would buy stuff simply based on their recommendation. That's all I want. And there's all these people that are in the documentary being like, yeah, that's how I ended up with all these circle records. Which is, and I laughed so hard because I have all those circle records as well\n\nthat it's like an incredible psychedelic finish rock band. I think they're from Finland. And the Aquarius was just so obsessed with this band and we're so good at talking about how obsessed they were, that it got a whole generation of people who read their breakdowns obsessed with this finish rock band called Circle and all their ancillary shootoff bands, off-shoot bands. Great, incredible stuff. Loved it.\n\nThat's what I want. I love that, I need it so much. It's really fun, but it makes me bummed because it's really hard to find that same kind of curation, that same kind of recommendation engine. And that's what's a bummer. And that's what I really like. That's the whole thing, you don't know who you trust. And I will say just for shits and gigs,\n\nif you're interested, the other documentary that I will recommend is the one about the record store in New York called Other Music. Oh, that's right. That was another longstanding record store that I used to go to all the time that had a similar vibe as Aquarius in terms of recommending very unique and interesting stuff.\n\nI'll also shout out a couple of other YouTube channels just because I'm trying to point people towards stuff that isn't struck. Yes. Our friend Rob Hubel recently was a guest host of Sandwiches of History. Yes! Which I was shocked because I just watched that show and then here's Hubel doing one. I was delighted. Action Bronson show fuck that's delicious. So it is now just running new episodes on YouTube that are absolutely hilarious and fantastic. And then Scott can you put in air horn sounds. Here we go.\n\nOkay, mannequin pussy, new music. Oh yeah. The album is called, or the song is called I Got Heaven, it's out now, it's fantastic. Please listen to the new Manicampusy. I'll also throw out the band Zebra, has an incredible album called Bird Hour, new music from the band Pile, fantastic,\n\ncareer woman, fantastic, new album from Alibaster De Plume, incredible, new music from Fival is Glock, the French band, great. And a new album from from Jamie Branch, jazz, trumpet player who died recently. The album is inexplicably called Fly or Die Fly or Die Fly or Die, parentheses, parentheses, World War, closed parentheses, close parentheses. I believe that's right. I love that. Album is incredible, beautiful,\n\nand it's a heartbreaking loss to the world of jazz and improvised music. All right, this is great. Jason, a pleasure as always. We'll talk soon. Yay. Thank you, Jason. Remember, you can call us anytime with a question at 619-PAUL-ASK that\n\n619-PAL asks.
