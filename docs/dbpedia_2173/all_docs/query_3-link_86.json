There is even a single gull in our neighborhood that I've named Ron, he doesn't really know his name yet. The more people that do that, the more brave they get! There is a group of seagulls in the United Kingdom that have become lovers of synthetic marijuana, K2 \"spice\" and have been classified as \"zombie birds\" that continue to get buck wild around the country!\n\nIn some beach towns, bikini clad beachgoers have been enjoying a bag of K2 or a hand rolled \"spice\" joint when seagulls have swooped down, grabbed the goods and flown away!! Balls. It takes balls for such a bird to bogart said drugs from human participants."
