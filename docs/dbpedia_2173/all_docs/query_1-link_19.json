Perhaps capitalizing on the fact that nearly 1 million people have viewed that video, the band have returned with another Mumford-ized version of a metal classic. Their live take of Dio’s “Holy Diver” takes the diving part of the song seriously, performing on a landlocked rowboat complete with life jackets, a captain’s hat, and enough ukelele and banjo to make Dio spin in his grave. We’re not really sure what the end goal for this band is, but they know how to make an enjoyable video, that’s for damn sure."
