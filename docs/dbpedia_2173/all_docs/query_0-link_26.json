        "text": "Category Archives: Uncategorized\n\nA few bison\n\nThe last stop on Road Trip with the Grands #2 was at our first stop on our way west 4 weeks ago, at Theodore Roosevelt National Park. We hoped to introduce the grandsons to a less intimidating version of a bison encounter (see the post on “the beast in the night”) than we had experienced several weeks ago in the park.\n\nWe saw myriads of prairie dogs on our way to our campsite, but no bison. A park volunteer told us the big males we had seen earlier were now with the rest of the herd, spread throughout the park. Oh no, a trip here with no bison sightings was not the way to end the road trip!\n\nBut the next morning we found three good-sized herds of mixed ages and sexes of bison on our way to the trail head for a wilderness hike. Success!\n\na story of regrowth, renewal, and resilience\n\nIn August of 2020, lightening triggered a massive wildfire in the coastal redwood forest of the Santa Cruz mountains an hour south of San Jose, CA. Eventually the fire would consume almost 87,000 acres, and about 97% of Big Basin State Park, including all of the public buildings. All that was left were the charred skeletons of 200-300 foot redwoods and some residual stone and iron structures in the public buildings.\n\nAlthough redwoods have thick bark capable of withstanding ground fires, the Big Basin fire was so hot and so high in the canopy, trees lost all of their leafy photosynthetic surfaces. Few people thought the forest would survive this devastation.\n\nFour years later, when we visited Big Basin last weekend, we saw a lush, green forest growing out of the blackened trunks of the lofty redwoods. What an amazing sight!\n\nBut the more amazing part of the recovery process is the regrowth of branches and needles in fire-damaged trees.\n\nHow was this revegetation of the blackened trunks possible?\n\nScientists learned two important things about the ecophysiology of redwoods from this fire: 1) dormant buds lay under the fire-charred bark that could give rise to new lateral branches and needles, and 2) redwoods (like other trees) store sugars to support that growth process, sometimes for hundreds of years if it doesn’t get used.\n\nLike the extra gasoline we put in our cars when the gas gauge gets low, trees keep adding sugars to their storage depots over time. When scientists brought sprouts from the regenerating redwoods back to the lab to analyze them by radiocarbon dating, they found a mix of sugars stored over several decades, some as long as 60 years.\n\nSo now we know that redwoods aren’t just resistant to fire damage, they are able to regrow green vegetation from dormant tissue and stored sugars — a unique part of their resilience in a fire-prone environment.\n\nThe Falls of Idaho\n\nThe Snake River flows over 1,000 miles from its headwaters in Yellowstone to join the Columbia river in south-central Washington. It carves a big smile in southern Idaho’s Snake River plain as the water rushes over waterfalls and through narrow canyons there — water that is essential for Idaho’s agricultural production. We stopped off in Idaho Falls and Twin Falls to take a look at some of the dramatic river features produced by the action of the river.\n\nTraveling another 160 miles west on I-15 and I-86, we crossed the deep Snake River canyon on an impressive bridge to drive into Twin Falls.\n\nBut even tributaries of the Snake River in the city of Twin Falls contribute their own spectacular waterfalls, like the Petrine-Coulee Falls that drop about 200 feet from canyon rim to the river.\n\nThere is no doubt that the most spectacular waterfall along this stretch of the Snake River is Shoshone Falls, located about 7 miles upstream from Twin Falls. At full flow this waterfall is bigger than Niagara, with its 212 foot drop and over 1000 foot rim. Unfortunately we ran out of daylight to see the view of these falls from the north side of the river.\n\nMaybe next time when we’re back this way…\n\nMajestic giants of the Arctic\n\nPolar bears are uniquely adapted to survive in one of the harshest environments on Earth. We picture them as the apex (top) predators on land (which they are), but they are actually marine mammals, capable of swimming long distances between ice floes or between distant points of land. In fact, a bear might travel 1500-15,000 square miles in a year in search of prey, using a combination of swimming, walking, and floating on ice floes. They can swim continuously using their powerful forelegs for 3-4 days at a time, covering more than 100 miles.\n\nCold tolerance is one of the key adaptations of all arctic mammals, but polar bears have evolved their own unique method of achieving it. Their fur coat consists of two layers, a short dense underfur, and a longer fur of guard hairs that are hollow spaces, lacking pigment, surrounded by a thick keratin shell. This one characteristic turns out to be the key to heat conservation for polar bears because heat from the skin that radiates toward the surface, first through the dense underfur, and then through the guard hair layer is trapped in the slender, air-filled tubes. This system works so well to trap the bear’s heat that they are invisible to thermal imaging! In addition, like other marine mammals, polar bears carry a thick layer of blubber beneath the skin as additional insulation. Of course all this insulation then makes the polar bear vulnerable to overheating in the summer sun.\n\nClose-up shots of these two bears gave us a chance to admire their other characteristics. Polar bears are huge. A big male might be 5 feet at the shoulder and its head might be at 10 feet when the bear stands up on two legs, which is a useful behavior when trying to spot seals lying on the ice. And their feet are huge, flat, dinner-plate sized pads with hair on the bottom of the pad to provide some friction against icy surfaces. Short but very sharp claws at the tips of the digits of the front paws are essential for gripping the ice shelf to propel them from the water onto the ice and for latching onto their prey.\n\nPolar bears have long snouts, small ears, and very small eyes. They use their heightened sense of smell to detect the presence of potential prey, rather than their eyesight. In fact, they can smell seals and other marine mammals on the ice from 20 miles away, and even detect a seal’s breathing hole from a half mile away. Their jaws are not large or particularly powerful, but their teeth are adapted for a carnivorous diet with very sharp canines and a space between canines and molars to accommodate biting off large chunks of meat.\n\nPolar bears adapt their hunting strategies to their prey with a combination of stalking, camouflage, sit-and wait (by a breathing hole), and surprise attack from behind their prey. The video by David Attenborough below shows their behavior well. It’s significant to note, however, that these sorts of surprise attacks are only successful about 5% of the time!\n\n(If you’re reading this post in your email, you won’t be able to see the video.

So this is the best view I saw until we left at midnight. The colors were far better the night before — darn!\n\nEven the crescent moon was cloudy and opaque. Better luck next time…\n\nSonoran desert sights\n\nThe Sonoran desert in southwestern Arizona is hot, but amazingly diverse in plant life because it receives two periods of rainfall annually and it provides subtropical warmth in the winter. In fact, some of the cacti growing in Organ Pipe National Monument on the U.S.-Mexican border can’t survive freezing temperatures.\n\nAfter the storms, a little sun…\n\nAnd then more rain, but in the meantime, we took some walks along the beach in Cambria and at Morro Rock. When the sun comes out, so do the animals.\n\nBetween the storms\n\nWe began the drive east during a set of storms that dropped a lot of rain on the California coast. But we ventured out between the raindrops to find a few birds in the heavy fog, stiff winds, and raging surf.\n\nDesert scenes\n\nThe Mojave Desert is a challenging environment for living things with its cold winters, extreme hot summers, and lack of water. But it is an interesting place to visit nevertheless because of its stark scenery, weird vegetation, and the odd formations found off the beaten path. We took a detour on a loop road through the Mojave National Preserve in southeastern California and found the following interesting scenes that really deserved a longer look — but unfortunately not this time.\n\nSo many places to explore in what looks from the highway like just more boring desert, but driving the back roads reveals a wonderland of places to see."
