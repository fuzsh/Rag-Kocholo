Luckily my friend \"ducked\" or should that be \"Seagulled\" and the bird hit the top of his head instead of his face.\n\nI dont know how the seagull felt but my mate had a severe headache for the rest of the day....\n\n__________________\n\nMember\n\nCountry: Other\n\nTown: Principalite d'Chaos\n\nBoat name: The Nashers Revenge!\n\nMake: Windsor Brothers\n\nLength: 6m +\n\nEngine: Optimax 225\n\nMMSI: \"Mmmmm SI\" she said!\n\nJoin Date: Jan 2004\n\nPosts: 4,883\n\nMy son, then 9, was standing in up our Rib whilst we were doing about 30 knots across a mirror flat Start bay during the summer.\n\nA seagul we disturbed flew towards us instead of away and attempted to scalp him with its wing, god only knows how it missed the A-Frame.\n\nThe seagul flew off and left my son woth a red mark on his forehead that went after a few minutes. Luckily he found it more funny than anything.\n\nNasher.\n\n__________________\n\nMember\n\nCountry: Other\n\nTown: San Carlos, Mexico\n\nBoat name: INDE\n\nMake: LOMAC 730\n\nLength: 7m +\n\nEngine: 200 Merc.\n\nMMSI: Please press 1\n\nJoin Date: May 2006\n\nPosts: 1,688\n\nGull attacks are quite common. If the gull thinks you are near it's territory either food supply or nest. They always go for the head.\n\n__________________\n\nRunning around like a head with it's chicken cut off.\n\nMember\n\nCountry: Other\n\nTown: Stanley, Falkland Is\n\nBoat name: Seawolf\n\nMake: Osprey Vipermax 5.8\n\nLength: 5m +\n\nEngine: Etec 150\n\nJoin Date: Mar 2006\n\nPosts: 3,726\n\nA cricket bat is what you need\n\nHaven't had a head on but I nearly ran over a shearwater once, it was gliding gracefully up the harbour about 2 feet off the water at about 20-25 knots, when it suddenly realised (when I was about six feet behind it) there was an orange boat gaining fast at about 35. I'd never seen a bird pull a turn that had contrails coming off its wingtips before but I think this one did\n\nAh the good old days when I had a boat that worked\n\n__________________\n\nA Boat is a hole in the water, surrounded by fibreglass, into which you throw money...\n\nSent from my Computer, using a keyboard and mouse\n\nMember\n\nCountry: UK - England\n\nTown: London\n\nBoat name: varies\n\nMake: n/a\n\nLength: n/a\n\nEngine: varies\n\nJoin Date: May 2004\n\nPosts: 128\n\nWhen gulls attack...\n\nIMHO it can be especially risky when travelling at speed at night, you can come across large groups of resting seabirds on the water. Add one swiftly travelling RIB and any slow reactions on the part of teh bird could (and has) lead to a collision. I know a RNLI Atlantic helm who was thankful for his Gecko on a night shout, and personally I have ducked a cormorant that popped out of the water directly ahead and went through three of us between the engines and out of the back of the A frame with only the loss of a few feathers. Scared the crap out of us though.\n\nHas the potential to be nasty though, just imagine a small chicken hitting your unprotected head travelling at 30+mph. Ouch!\n\nSo it is probably one of many other good reasons for slowing down at night....\n\nHowever, having blitzed through a huge flock of gulls once in the early hours and effectively running through a tunnel of birds just lit up by the red and green of the nav lights, it did look pretty cool. That was before the RNLI helm pointed out the rather obvious danger, plus the rather un-environmentally friendly impact on the poor birds! I should've known better!\n\n__________________\n\nRIBnet admin team\n\nCountry: UK - England\n\nTown: The wilds of Wiltshire\n\nBoat name: Dominator\n\nMake: SR5.4\n\nLength: 7m +\n\nEngine: Yam 85\n\nMMSI: 235055163\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2005\n\nPosts: 13,066\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by jwalker\n\nMore like the driver wasn't looking where the bird was going.\n\nYou are on the water, this is where seabirds live, it's their home, you are on their territory. I personally feel we should be looking out for their and all other sea dwellers' wellbeing.\n\nI think maybe we can make an exception for seagulls there-there's more inland on rubbish tips than at sea now\n\nThe damn things are worse than pigeons and nothing better than agressive flying rats.\n\n__________________\n\nNeed spares,consoles,consumables,hire,training or even a new boat?\n\nPlease click HERE and HERE and support our Trade Members.\n\nJoin up as a Trade member or Supporter HERE"
