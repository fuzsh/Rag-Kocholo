        "text": "Regular bird observations were made in the environs of Maputo, Mozambique, from October 2010 until September 2017. Casual observations ranging between Ponta d'Ouro and the Maputo Special Reserve in Maputo Province, in the south, through Gaza Province to the Bazaruto archipelago in Inhambane Province, in the north (see Fig. 1), were recorded in eBird ( www.eBird.com), and informally reported on the Facebook site Birds Mozambique and in the Recent Reports section of Bull. Afr. Bird Cl. My purpose here is to place sightings of terns, gulls and skuas on formal record, as part of an ongoing effort to publish all interesting bird records from this part of the country. A sibling publication covering other seabirds is planned.\n\nThe primary area covered was the hinterland of Maputo, but with nine visits to Inhambane and Tofo, one to Pomene and two to Bazaruto. Pelagic trips were made from Maputo (n = 15), Tofo (n = 6) and Bazaruto (n = 1). From Tofo and Bazaruto these trips traversed waters due east to c. 10–15 km offshore. From Maputo, pelagic trips crossed Maputo Bay and ranged north of Inhaca Island, reaching the continental shelf edge. Two trips ventured further south off the Machangulo Peninsula. For locations see Fig. 1. Birds were observed using binoculars and telescope, but digital photography was an important means of documenting records, especially at sea.\n\nSouthern Mozambique is here defined as that part of the country that falls within the Southern Africa ornithological region, and its northern boundary in Mozambique is delineated by the Zambezi River, as well as waters within Mozambique's Exclusive Economic Zone (Hockey et al. 2005).\n\nThe status of all of the species included here was described by Hockey et al. (2005) and many were treated in more detail by The atlas of the birds of Mozambique in the two volumes covering southern and central Mozambique (Parker 2000, 2005). Parker (2005) covered the provinces of Sofala and Manica, both of which fall within the Southern African region, but he also covered all of Tete, whereas only the southern part of this province, south of the Zambezi River and the Cahora Bassa Dam, forms part of the Southern Africa ornithological region. All of the data from Parker's studies were included within the Southern African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP) dataset, which were analysed in their entirety at the time by Hockey et al. (2005). However, data from Mozambique have continued to be added by observers since 2005 ( http://sabap2.adu.org.za/). Clancey (1996) also remains an important work underpinning our knowledge of southern Mozambique's avifauna.\n\nFor seabirds, Clancey (1971) provided the first list of sighting localities in southern Mozambique, while Brooke et al. (1981) compiled both published and unpublished data ‘from the coast or within sight of it’ to supplement Clancey's study. Lambert (2005) is the most important work on seabirds in southern Mozambique, based on 350 days of observations from prawn trawling vessels in Mozambican waters. Rollinson (in press) documented seabirds from a fishing vessel in Mozambican waters off southern and central Mozambique over the course of 79 days, between 1 August and 17 October 2015. As many of the sightings reported herein pre-date those of Rollinson (in press), his findings are discussed alongside those reported here (with his permission).\n\nThe main reference for the region is Hockey et al. (2005) wherein a short review of the status and records for all species is presented. Only those species for which my records augment knowledge of their status are included herein, and I have not attempted to comprehensively analyse SABAP, eBird and other major data sources for additional material. Taxonomy and nomenclature follow Dickinson & Remsen (2013).\n\nSABINE'S GULL Xema sabini\n\nBreeds in the Holarctic and migrates south through the Atlantic Ocean to spend the austral summer off southern Africa (Hockey et al. 2005). Rare in Mozambique, the first record was by Lambert (1983), followed by another four, all in February–April north of Inhaca Island (Lambert 2005), including one immature. Note that Lambert's first record (1983) was not mentioned by Clancey (1996), but was cited as being in press by Griffiths & Sinclair (1982) and subsequently incorrectly attributed to the latter authors by Hockey et al. (2005).\n\nOne north of Inhaca Island on 10 May 2015 (Fig. 3) is the sixth record for Mozambique. It was considered to be in its second-calendar year (CY) having nearly completed moulting its juvenile plumage, with the exception of some brownish wing-coverts and outer primaries, but sporting an adult non-breeding plumage neck collar (P. Morris pers. comm.).\n\nKELP GULL Larus dominicanus\n\nSubspecies vetula, known as Cape Gull, breeds in the austral summer on coasts of South Africa as far east as the Riet Keiskamma River, Eastern Cape (Tree 2006), and disperses north along the east and west coasts post-breeding (Crawford et al. 1997). Hockey et al. (2005) noted that it occurs as far north as Maputo. Parker (2000) described Kelp Gull as an uncommon non-breeding winter visitor to coasts, where it was seen alone or in groups of up to ten, estimating the number visiting this region as unlikely to exceed 300, and the mapped distribution shows records confined to the region of Maputo Bay. Parker (2005) did not record it in central Mozambique. Clancey (1996) noted records from Beira harbour, but these have not been substantiated subsequently and now appear very unlikely (see Lesser Black-backed Gull L. fuscus).\n\nObserved annual pattern of occurrence in Maputo Bay follows Parker (2000: 95), but first arrivals in January–February often involve recently fledged juveniles still growing their primaries. Birds of all ages arrive in March, and all depart in August–September. Up to 70 have been observed in Maputo Bay. Considering its confident behaviour on the breeding grounds, L. dominicanus is surprisingly discreet in Maputo Bay, feeding 1–2 km offshore, following prawn trawlers, and roosting on inaccessible, isolated sandbanks. It is rarely observed on the Maputo city beachfront, despite being present nearby in good numbers.\n\nIt is noteworthy that there were no sightings further north in Mozambique, despite considerable observer effort around Tofo and Inhambane, and potentially suitable habitat at Bilene. Rollinson (in press) observed one at sea c.150 km east of Vilankulos, on 8 October 2015, which appears to be the only recent reliable record north of Maputo.\n\nIt seems likely that Maputo Bay is a focal destination for a regularly returning subpopulation of Kelp Gulls, and it is remarkable that recently fledged juveniles reach Maputo Bay probably within just a few weeks of fledging. This is probably linked to feeding opportunities around the small fleet of inshore prawn trawlers that operate daily up to 15 km from Maputo, mostly inside the bay. Equally, the apparent absence of the species further north is perhaps related to the relative lack of inshore fishing vessels regularly working specific areas.\n\nSUBANTARCTIC SKUA Stercorarius antarcticus\n\nKnown off South Africa as a regular non-breeding visitor from its subantarctic breeding islands (Maclean 1984, Sinclair & Ryan 2003). Ryan et al. (2006) found the species in the Mozambique Channel near Europa Island, in the French Southern Ocean territories, but outside Mozambican waters, and Safford & Hawkins (2013) reported small numbers off Madagascar.\n\nHockey et al. (2005) mapped this species' range in Mozambique as coastal waters south of Inhaca Island, but there are few previous records to substantiate this. Clancey (1996) and Parker (2000) reported two in Mozambican waters, in August 1959 at Maputo (Brookeworth 1960) and in April 1968 off Inhaca Island (Jensen 1968). However, Lambert (2005) found 20 individuals on 17 dates, most of which were off Inhaca Island, but records were widely scattered with the northernmost off Quelimane.\n\nAll of my own records were made in 2015, when one was seen from shore near Tofo on 5 May, another single was north of Inhaca Island on 10 May and four were there on 13 June. In addition a single was seen off Tofo on 20 April 2015 (E. Marais pers. comm.) and another was video-recorded there on 7 April 2012 (H. Darrin pers. comm.). All were identified (relative to South Polar Skua S. maccormicki) by heavy build with broad wings, solid dark brown underparts and nape, and relatively narrow white band at bases of the primaries.\n\nThe species clearly ranges further north in Mozambique than has previously been documented. Rollinson (in press) observed a total of 32 birds, all in southerly locations east of Maputo. None was further north. It is interesting to note that, despite regular surveys offshore from Maputo, the bulk of the records was in 2015."
