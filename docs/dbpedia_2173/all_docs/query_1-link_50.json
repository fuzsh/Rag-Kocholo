        "text": "TOP 20 METAL/HARD ROCK ALBUMS OF 2023\n\nHey, it is Dan here from The Plague. Let me start with apologies for the lateness of posting this, but I have been using my YouTube platform to highlight my top albums for the past few years. If you are curious, you can check out my top albums for 2022 and 2021. This year, I spent an inordinate amount of time trying to decide if I wanted to continue the channel and eventually decided to put it to rest. But I did want to post this list somewhere to do what I can to help promote these amazing bands and albums, so I decided to get back to my roots here on tumblr. Anyway, enough rambling, let me jump into my top hard rock and metal albums for 2023. Of course, these are just the ones that I have heard and have resonated with me the most, so your mileage may vary. My tastes in recent years has skewed toward the traditional heavy metal revival, but there a few here that fall outside those boundaries, too. Let’s kick it off with #20…\n\n20. WITCHTOWER – Voyeur\n\nAlmost missed this one even though it was released back in March of 2023. I’ve been a fan of this Spanish four-piece for a while now and this one is very much in the same vein as previous releases, combining a mature brand of classic heavy metal with some speedy moments and that touch of Mercyful Fate that bands like In Solitude and Portrait explored in the early 2000s. Some really great and effective bass playing here, too.\n\n19. GIRLSCHOOL – WTFortyfive?\n\nThis one I almost didn’t bother to listen to, given the rather awkward, terrible album title, but glad I gave it a chance. Girlschool have definitely become heavier on recent albums, but they retain their solid, melodic songwriting chops and the trademark gang vocals on the choruses. I really enjoyed the variety of songs, from dark-edged metal to punky hard rock to power pop. Some of the lyrics are cringey (mainly “Bump in the Night”) but others are quite good, like “It’s a Mess” and “It Is What It Is.”\n\n18. ENFORCER – Nostalgia\n\nSweden’s purveyors of classic heavy metal with a touch of speed metal are back with their sixth album. While some were put off by the overly commercial sound on 2019’s Zenith, it is nice to hear Enforcer pretty much back on track with Nostalgia. “Coming Alive” and “Metal Supremacia” have all the fire and energy of the band’s early work, while the arena-rock elements still come through on tracks like “Unshackle Me” and “Heartbeats,” which reminds me of Def Leppard before they lost it.\n\n17. HIGH SPIRITS – Safe on the Other Side\n\nFifth album from Chicago mastermind Chris Black, who has also given us the likes of Superchrist, Pharaoh, Aktor, and Dawnbringer, among others. Another classic set of tunes that bridge the gap between hard rock and old-school heavy metal, always with a positive vibe underlying things. Not quite as memorable or heavy as 2020’s Hard to Stop and I don’t think they will ever top my absolute fave High Spirits album, Motivator, but even given that, this is an excellent album and easily one of 2023’s top 20.\n\n16. BURNING WITCHES – The Dark Tower\n\nAnother fifth album, this time from a Swiss five-piece, this is my favorite Burning Witches album yet. Their previous albums have been solid but usually only had one or two really memorable songs, whereas this time at least half the songs made an immediate impact and others have been growing on me. I like that they play traditional, powerful heavy metal but with a modern feel and production, much like bands like Primal Fear or Dream Evil.\n\n15. CIRITH UNGOL – Dark Parade\n\nI remember coming to Cirith Ungol rather late, as they often got a bad name in the press back in the day, but when One Foot in Hell came out, the cover art was just too cool to resist and I immediately fell in love with their unique take on epic heavy metal. I was so happy to see the band reunite and still deliver that classic sound. 2020’s Forever Black was good but lacked a bit in the production department, so I am happy to say that Dark Parade sounds lot fuller and more organic, plus the songs are more memorable. If this is indeed the band’s last album, they are going out on a high note, no doubt about it.\n\n14. TANITH – Voyage\n\nAnother band that has a pretty unique take on classic heavy metal and hard rock. They write really good, fairly complex tunes with elements of 70s-era Scorpions and UFO, but with dueling male and female lead vocals. Both singers are excellent in their own right but they also combine their voices quite often for an even greater effect. Been following these guys since being blown away by their performance at Frost & Fire IV back in 2018 and they have yet to disappoint.\n\n13. OBITUARY – Dying of Everything\n\nAlways my favorite of the Florida death metal bands, it is exciting to see the band really firing on all cylinders with their past couple records. This one might be my favorite since the classic Cause of Death, with some of the band’s most memorable tunes and the perfect production to showcase the band’s raw, pounding style.\n\n12. THE HAXANS – The Dead and the Restless\n\nThis is one of two albums in my top 20 that is decidedly not metal, but still rocks pretty hard. The Haxans are a project by Piggy D. of Wednesday 13 and Rob Zombie fame along with vocalist Ash Costello from New Years Day and they play a really cool mix of horror punk and goth rock. Although I wasn’t as consistently engaged with this one as I was with their Party Monsters debut, it features the same elements that made that one so enjoyable. They mix catchy vocal lines with stompy riffs really well and pull off serious, atmospheric tunes just as well as the more fun, tongue-in-cheek tracks.\n\n11. IMMORTAL – War Against All\n\nDespite all the drama behind the scenes and line-up changes, Immortal has somehow managed to maintain a pretty steady stream of quality albums and even though it is now just a one-man project of Demonaz, War Against All is very much another quality release. Closest comparison is obviously with Northern Chaos Gods, with a nice mix of ultra-fast and more moderate, marching riffs to be found here.\n\n10. CRUEL FORCE – Dawn of the Axe\n\nThird album from Germany’s awesome speed metal powerhouse Cruel Force. These guys expertly combine early Kreator, Exodus, and any number of other speed metal and proto-thrash outfits. The ripping riffs and explosive drum fills are unapologetically old-school but still sound fresh. Some touches of subtlety, too, such as the atmospheric detour in the midst of “Devil’s Dungeon” and the 7-minute epic “Realm of Sands.”\n\n9. MAGICK TOUCH – Cakes & Coffins\n\nThis is Norwegian heavy metal that is really hard to classify or compare to anyone else. It is heavy and melodic with clean vocals in a traditional metal way but doesn’t sound retro. As the title might suggest, the lyrics are all a bit offbeat, which further helps distinguish the band. Great songs, interesting arrangements, and solid musicianship complete the package.\n\n8. MEGATON SWORD – Might & Power\n\nSecond album from this Swiss traditional metal outfit shows them already expanding their sound and exploring new ideas. Still plenty of classic heavy metal here though, such as the Into Glory Ride-era Manowar sounding “The Raving Light of Day” and the pounding “Might.” The vocals are clean but very powerful and versatile and really help the band stand out. There is a certain melancholy to the band’s sound that reminds me vaguely of Sentenced, though you would never confuse the two bands.\n\n7. BEYOND THE BLACK – Beyond the Black\n\nAlthough I have become rather burned out on the symphonic metal scene in recent years, this album really stood out. There are so many bands that play well and have decent songs and production but they just aren’t memorable. Germany’s Beyond the Black really craft some great tunes with super infectious riffs and vocal melodies. Plus, the lyrics take a compelling look at life after death, reincarnation, and related topics, which also ties in nicely with the band’s name and, thus, perfect for this self-titled release.\n\n6. GOATEN – Midnight Conjuring\n\nThis amazing trio from Brazil has been around for a few years and released a couple of excellent EPs, but this is their debut full-length and it is a killer. The band combines heavy riffs with some unique, melodic vocals and absolutely infectious choruses. The band’s top-notch musicianship is used very judiciously to aid in creating atmosphere rather than showing off and it perfectly sets off the creepy, unsettling lyrics\n\n5. SAVAGE – Glory Riders\n\nGerman band that takes the very best of early W.A.S.P. and delivers it in a heavier fashion while retaining the energy and catchiness. Some nods to other 80s bands like Quiet Riot can be found, too, but the vocals and riffing owe a great deal to Blackie Lawless and company. Sadly, they seem to have split up, according to the Metal Archives and their social media accounts are down, so if anyone has any info on what happened here, I’d love to hear about it.\n\n4. RAVEN - All Hell’s Breaking Loose\n\nAnother great slab of energetic metal from one of the NWOBHM’s longest-running and most unique outfits. Not sure the songs are quite as memorable as the previous Metal City, but very close and they have really upped the speed to make this easily the fastest/heaviest Raven album ever. Drummer Mike Heller, who joined in 2018, is just wildly overplaying throughout the album and it is glorious.\n\n3. THE HIVES - The Death Of Randy Fitzsimmons\n\nThis is the other non-metal album on my list but it is just as energetic and powerful as most metal albums, if not more so. If you aren’t familiar with Sweden’s The Hives, they are a truly demented mix of punk, garage rock, dry humor and Rolling Stones’ swagger. Considering they haven’t released an album in over a decade, it is amazing they came back with one this absolutely powerful and it might well be their best one yet.\n\n2. ANTHEM – Crimson & Jet Black\n\nOne of the longest-running metal bands from Japan and one of the most consistent, Anthem continue to amaze by releasing this masterpiece, their 20th studio album. This is an instruction manual on how to create powerful, melodic, classic heavy metal songs with a modern production, stellar musicianship and the kind of diversity that keeps you glued to the speakers for the full 50+ minutes.\n\n1. SHADOWS – Out For Blood\n\nAnother amazing traditional heavy metal band that came out of nowhere, Shadows hails from Chile and have created the most infectious tunes of 2023. Elements of Shout-era Crue mix with early Dio and Mercyful Fate for a style that is at once familiar and unique. Although the band is the same line-up as the band Apostasy, I really hope this isn’t just a one-off album because I love it so much and really want to hear more in this vein.\n\nAs usual, there were way more excellent albums than just 20, but this list is my personal top 20 at the moment. Honorable mentions go out to TYRANN, CENTURY, BLOOD STAR, GRAVEDANCER (Brazilian blackened speed/thrash metal), BLACKBRAID, INCULTER, METAL CHURCH, SORCERER, and DEMONIAC. Also, quite a number of EPs and singles came out this past year. ACID BLADE, INTRANCED, DRIFTER, OLD GHOUL, and BRONZE\n\nOf course, I also have to mention some great non-metal releases in 2023, specifically those from KYLIE MINOGUE, DEPECHE MODE, GLUME, MEG MYERS, POPPY, SPARKS, NOBRO and NICK WATERHOUSE. 2024 has already boasted a number of excellent albums, such as JUDAS PRIEST, VULTURE, KMFDM, BRONZE, SAXON, LUCIFER, MINISTRY, and SCAVENGER, to name just a few. Hopefully, I will post next year’s list in a timelier fashion but, until then - stay metal!.\n\nTOP 20 ROCK/METAL ALBUMS OF 2020\n\nOne of my goals for 2020 was to revive The Plague webzine, this time as a YouTube channel. Although I did not achieve that, I’m hoping to get it up and running in 2021 so I can start reviewing and interviewing bands again. There were so many great, exciting releases in 2020, that my initial list was 70+ and it was very difficult to pare that down to my top 20. With bands representing Canada, Sweden, Colombia, Japan, Portugal, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, the USA and the UK, it was a very cosmopolitan year…\n\n20. POSSESSED STEEL – Aedris\n\nCanada is just overflowing with amazing metal bands these days. Possessed Steel hail from Toronto and have been around for a quite a while but this is their debut full-length and it is quite stunning. The style here is firmly rooted in classic heavy metal and USPM, with the lyrics an engaging (but not self-indulgent) fantasy concept piece. All of this combined with some gorgeous cover artwork makes for a classy and magical record.\n\n19. GLACIER – The Passing of Time\n\nThis Oregon outfit only released one EP back in 1985 before disappearing, but the quality of that release was good enough to keep the name alive in the hearts of die-hards ever since. Although only vocalist Michael Podrybau remains in the current line-up, the style and spirit of the band’s classic sound is very much intact. As comeback albums go, this is one of the best in recent memory, featuring eight tracks of pure, melodic metal that is both traditional and memorable.\n\n18. THE NIGHT FLIGHT ORCHESTRA – Aeromantic\n\nWhen NFO first started out, it seemed like more of a quaint side-project from Bjorn and David of Soilwork fame, but as they found their groove and kept up the quality with each album, it has clearly become very much a legit band of its own. Aeromantic is album #5 and finds NFO seamlessly blending 70s-inspried pomp rock with 80s hard-edged AOR. Although it isn’t my favorite NFO album to date (that title still goes to Skyline Whispers), it is right up there and “Servants of the Air” and “Transmissions” are instant classics.\n\n17. SPELL – Opulent Decay\n\nAnother Canadian outfit, this time from Vancouver and pulling in influences from the 70s. This is the trio’s third outing and, as much as I enjoyed the first two, it really all comes together here. The melodies are haunting, the arrangements are unpredictable, and the performances and production are both exceptional. Opulent Decay is not a collection of catchy tunes but more the type of album that takes you on a journey and never disappoints along the way.\n\n16. SPIRIT ADRIFT – Enlightened in Eternity\n\nNice to hear so many new American trad metal bands out there and Spirit Adrift are one of the best. There is a catchy, melodic quality to the vocal and guitar lines that reminds me of High Spirits, but with a grittier and heavier overall sound. The ten-plus minute closing track “Reunited in the Void” has a beautiful Sabbath-esque build-up that closes out the album on a particularly high note.\n\n15. SARCATOR – Sarcator\n\nThis young Swedish quartet conjure the exact type of modern thrash metal that I love: intense, raw, fast, with just a hint of death metal brutality. Like all great thrash records, there are plenty of cool change-ups and an endless stream of vicious, memorable riffs. There is a relentless vibe here that reminds me of late 80s Sepultura and the production is perfect to bring out Sarcator’s powerful sound.\n\n14. ETERNAL CHAMPION – Ravening Steel\n\nThis one I put off listening to for a while as I felt the band had been a bit overhyped in the past, but damn if they don’t deliver the goods here in spades. This is classic, epic heavy metal that builds on strong vocals and an endless stream of great riffs. Don’t be put off by the goofy album cover – this is top-notch true metal, the real deal.\n\n13. WITCHTRAP – Evil Strikes Again\n\nColombian blackened speed metal merchants Witchtrap have always been enjoyable but manage to outdo themselves on this, their fifth full-length outing. The songs are compact and well-structured, with tunes like “Midnight Rites” and “Death To False Metal” being particularly memorable. Witchtrap have that perfect balance of polished songwriting and raw delivery that really gives this a timeless feel.\n\n12. OCCULT BURIAL – Burning Eerie Lore\n\nBack to Canada one more time, this time for a hellish mix of black, speed, and thrash metal. The guitar tone is wonderfully raw and the vocals are a tortured wail from a well of reverb. Combined with some speedy, well-written tunes, the overall effect is electrifyingly eerie, as the title promises.\n\n11. OUTRAGE – Run Riot\n\nOutrage began life in the 80s as a stellar thrash band in the Metallica vein, but have evolved in many ways over the years without losing their skill at writing great tunes. Run Riot has some all-out thrashers, to be sure, but also delves into more melodic territory as well as more mid-tempo grinders and even a couple songs that veer towards stoner metal and punk. It is this diversity that really elevates this record above so many one-dimensional albums that I hear these days.\n\n10. IRONSWORD – Servants of Steel\n\nIf there is one band that deserves the throne vacated by Manilla Road when Mark Shelton passed, it would be Portugal’s Ironsword. Their sound covers similar ground, from grandiose epic to speedy power metal, with a focus on quality songwriting (no doubt why it has taken five years since their last album). I can’t really pick out a standout track here; it is pure quality from start to finish.\n\n9. MIDNIGHT – Rebirth by Blasphemy\n\nMidnight first came onto my radar with Satanic Royalty and, while I don’t think they have yet to equal that masterpiece, this one comes the closest. The band’s formula of Venom/Warfare-styled blackened punk/speed metal is completely intact, with the production offering a bit more clarity without diminishing the rawness necessary for these songs to get their point across. Midnight is a rare band that the critics seem to all love and yet are actually really good.\n\n8. KRAMP – Gods of Death\n\nHailing from Spain, Kramp are an absolute gem of true metal that reminds me of classic USPM like Tyton and Brocas Helm. There is nothing flashy about Kramp, but the songs and the performances speak for themselves with some of the best and most memorable choruses I’ve heard this year.\n\n7. VAMPIRE – Rex\n\nSo many great bands this year have been combining genres in interesting ways and Vampire do just that with black, thrash, speed, and death metal. While there is a certain retro and occult charm to Rex, there is also a great deal of precision and intricate dual-guitar work to be had. It is easy to just get carried away by the intensity of this album, but it also bears up well to deeper analysis and there is a lot of interesting stuff going on throughout.\n\n6. RAVEN – Metal City\n\nRaven are one of the most singular bands to come out of the NWOBHM scene and, despite their share of ups and downs over the years, have really come back to full strength in recent years. Their last opus, Extermination, was a great return to form, but Metal City takes it one step further. Not only is this the best produced Raven album ever, it has some of the band’s strongest performances, particularly the bass/guitar interplay, John Gallagher’s mighty vocal range, and Mike Heller’s insane drumming. To top it off, the songs themselves are diverse and highly memorable.\n\n5. SODOM – Genesis XIX\n\nWhile it was sad to see the band’s solid line-up of many years fall apart, having Frank Blackfire back in the band is a real delight. This could easily have been a lukewarm rehash of the Agent Orange glory days but thankfully it isn’t that at all. Instead, Genesis XIX takes that classic riffing and direct songwriting and wraps it in a raw but modern production, tossing in a few touches of post-thrash extreme metal for good measure. Trying to digest all 12 songs in one sitting can be difficult, but each track has its own character and I would rate this as Sodom’s best work since Better Off Dead.\n\n4. STALLION – Slaves of Time\n\nWhen it comes to good, old-fashioned heavy metal with piercing vocals and killer riffing, Stallion really nail it. Similar to bands like Enforcer and Striker, these German metallers incorporate a good dose of pure speed into their sound – just check out “No Mercy” and “Brain Dead.” But there is plenty of variety on Slaves of Time, with “Time to Reload” hitting a groove somewhere between Cinderella and Krokus, “All In” evoking some L.A. Guns swagger, and “Merchants of Fear” reminding me of Hallow’s Eve in their prime. It is this ability to write consistently great songs in so many styles and make it work as an album that put this so high on my list.\n\n3. DELAIN – Apocalypse & Chill\n\nSo many mediocre bands came out in the wake of Nightwish’s success and the first time I heard Delain back in 2009, I was skeptical. But each album since has been better than the one before and, although I think Moonbathers may be their pinnacle, this one is still very, very good. The band know how to write a good, catchy song and make it both heavy and very melodic, with the vocals, guitars, and keyboards all intertwining perfectly. Charlotte Wessels is one of those rare vocalists, too, that combines, skill, emotion, and her own unique personality to really drive home each song.\n\n2. LUCIFER – III\n\nAlthough the occult rock thing has died down a bit, Lucifer have proven with each release that they are at the top of the genre and III is their best one yet. They blend the psych and occult rock of the late 60s and early 70s with metal of the era such as Sabbath, Pentagram, and early Priest. The performances are all spot-on and every song tells its own story, making it both a collection of great tunes and a seamlessly coherent album as a whole.\n\n1. BLUE ÖYSTER CULT – The Symbol Remains\n\nAfter nearly 20 years, this album seemed destined to be at least something of a letdown, especially as 2001’s Curse of the Hidden Mirror was one of my least favorite BOC records. Fortunately, the band defied the curse of 2020 and unleashed a powerful album that stays true to the band’s roots while incorporating a modern production and wildly diverse array of songs. Longtime keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Richie Castellano finally gets to play on a BOC record and not only contributes several songs but also adds some excellent lead vocals to three tunes. With 14 tracks, there are only maybe three that fail to live up to the band’s high standards, but the remaining eleven are a joy and this record has already received more repeat plays than any other this year. By a lot.\n\nWhile those are my twenty favorite releases (as of this moment), the next 20 would include the albums from WHITE MAGICIAN, HITTMAN, TYRANT, MEGATON SWORD, BÜTCHER, FREEWAYS, CARDINAL WYRM, HELLRAIDERS, WYTCH HAZEL, SÖLICITÖR, TRAVELER, NIGHTMARE, AMARANTHE, TORCH, CIRITH UNGOL, GOD DETHRONED, DEATHSTORM, HAUNT, ARMORED SAINT and GREYHAWK\n\nAlso, there were plenty of great singles, EPs, and demos released in 2020. My favorites were ZATYR, BLOOD STAR, JENNER, VENATOR, THE TROOPS OF DOOM, WAR CURSE, FER DE LANCE, EARLY MOODS, DOUBLE CROSS, STEALTH, ONYXHEAD, MIDNIGHT DICE, MEURTRIÈRES, LUNATTACK, LÜGER, HIGH COMMAND, HELLCHARGER, AEROSCREAMER, WASTELAND COVEN, and VECTIS. I highly recommend checking out any and all of these bands for some high-quality metal.\n\nIt was very depressing to see how hard the bands, roadies, venues, etc. were affected this year by restrictions necessary to combat COVID-19 and I really look forward to the time in 2021 when everyone can come together to enjoy metal in person once again. I did manage to squeeze in a few shows in 2020, including ROSS THE BOSS, BLUE ÖYSTER CULT, POPPY, and the great local MERCYFUL FATE tribute act PRINCESS OF HELL. Fortunately, there are plenty of top-notch albums to be had and I urge everyone to buy any and all merch they can afford to help keep the bands (and venues!) afloat until live shows return.\n\nTOP 20 ROCK/METAL ALBUMS OF 2019\n\nBeen looking back at the list I made last year and it is hard to say if 2019 was better or not. I feel like, if nothing else, there were fewer let-downs and more out-of-the blue surprises, so I guess that means it was an improvement. For anyone who says there are no good metal albums coming out these days, I say they just need to dig a little. So many great bands have been forming in recent years and started looking back to the origins of metal before death and black metal ruled the world. Since that was the era I grew up in, it isn’t too surprising that a lot of my choices this year hark back to earlier times. Case in point…\n\n20. BEWITCHER - Under the Witching Cross\n\nFirst up is one of many bands to put a modern spin on a retro sound and this one is even from the PNW (Portland). In this case, the most obvious comparison is early Venom. “Hexenkrieg” even has a chorus like “Acid Queen” and a bridge straight outta “1000 Days in Sodom.” Lyrically, Bewitcher may be even more primitive, with lots of references to Satan, goats, and witching of all sorts. Musically, however, they do show some real diversity and skills, mixing up lightning-fast tunes with slower, pounding metal. No sophomore slump here, thank Satan.\n\n19. INCULTER - Fatal Visions\n\nNorway is starting to establish itself as a home for raw and brutal old-school thrash metal, with the likes of Condor, Deathhammer, and Nekromantheon delivering some wildly OTT albums in recent years. Inculter are a bit newer but really impressed with their debut in 2015 and are back with an even more lethal release in 2019. The riffing is relentless, although the band does do a good job of mixing up the tempos throughout. Still, fast thrash with touches of early Sodom and Sepultura is the core of Inculter’s sound and it is the perfect soundtrack for getting out your aggression here at civilization’s end.\n\n18. MIDNIGHT PRIEST - Aggressive Hauntings\n\nI’ve been following this Portuguese outfit since their debut nearly a decade ago and have seen a solid increase in songwriting and production, along with a solidification of style. Many bands have stolen King Diamond’s sound and style, but Midnight Priest use it as a jumping-off point into a realm of their own. The vocals cover a great range with theatrical lyrics of hauntings, convents, and candles, while the music is firmly in the classic 80s vein with some wildly catchy riffs that remind me as much of Priest and Accept as they do King and Fate.\n\n17. FATAL CURSE - Breaking the Trance\n\nHailing from the middle of upstate New York, this power trio has more in common with their NWOBHM-loving brethren across the northern border than they do most US bands. Fortunately, they pull it off with the effortlessness only a group of dyed-in-the-wool fans of the music can. Songs like “Can’t Stop the Thunder” and the title track overflow with pure, punchy energy that reminds me of the heyday of Diamond Head and Jaguar. It’s a short but power-packed debut that bodes well for the band’s future.\n\n16. BABYMETAL - Metal Galaxy\n\nAlthough this might seem out of place, I’ve always had a love for electronic dance music and this is the best combination of metal and dance I’ve heard yet. While the first two Babymetal records had a cool sound, they felt kind of samey and it was hard to really remember any of the individual tracks. Not so here. “Da Da Dance” is pure anime energy, while “Shanti Shanti Shanti” incorporates Indian instrumentation and melodies and “Oh! MAJINAI” can only be called a pirate anthem. Even “PA PA YA!!” with its rap bridge totally rocks. Some folks are turned off by ‘manufactured’ bands like this, which I totally get, but I’m more interested in the results and “Metal Galaxy” is a really solid, diverse album that I’ve come back to many times already.\n\n15. IRON GRIFFIN - Curse of the Sky\n\nFinland is apparently the world’s capitol of metal (most bands per capita) and represents all types well. Iron Griffin is a thoroughly original and enjoyable mix of 70s occult and hard rock, early USPM, and classic epic metal. The production is nice and organic, with each instrument shining through, especially the bass. Vocalist Maija Tiljander can deliver the mellow and screaming parts with equal panache, while all of the instruments are handled by Oskari Räsänen (drummer of the divine Mausoleum Gate). If you enjoyed their EP, this album is 100% better and that is saying something.\n\n14. VIGILANCE - Enter the Endless Abyss\n\nHaven’t heard too many Slovenian heavy metal bands (Hellcats is the only other one I can think of), but Vigilance is quite impressive in both delivery and originality. Their style is a fairly complex mix of classic, speed, and black metal. The riffing is solid, with plenty of Maiden-esque harmonies to be had, while the vocals are gruff in the vein of Amok-era Sentenced. Every song is a bit of a journey, without being overblown, and it makes for a very satisfying album experience.\n\n13. TANITH - In Another Time\n\nAfter being blown away by their performance at Frost & Fire IV, I was very pleased to see Tanith sign with Metal Blade and release a killer debut. Trying to describe the band’s sound is difficult, as they incorporate a lot of different elements. There is a definite 70s vibe and some early prog-rock influences at work, with complex song structures that thankfully never get self-indulgent. The blending of male and female clean vocals is another highlight and both work remarkably well with the melodic riffs. The bass playing is also worth noting, as it winds its way through each song in perfect counterpoint to whatever the guitar happens to be doing. Bonus points for writing a song about the Cassini probe and its journey to Saturn.\n\n12. ATLANTEAN KODEX - The Course of Empire\n\nWhen I hear the term ‘epic metal,’ this is exactly what comes to mind. It incorporates the most grandiose elements of bands like Manowar, Bathory, and Solstice, but Atlantean Kodex somehow take it to the next level. This isn’t a collection of catchy songs, it is a weighty opus that you need to sit back and let cascade over you. It has been six years since their last record but you can definitely hear the time was well-spent and great care taken to craft each song just so. Although it doesn’t surpass The White Goddess in grandeur, it is close behind.\n\n11. SUICIDAL ANGELS - Years of Aggression\n\nGreek thrash very much in the vein of the classics from ’88-’90. Solid production, straightforward but great riffing, and a wide range of tempos. There are songs that swing back and forth between fast and slow, some that are mid-tempo throughout, etc. I love that Suicidal Angels sound like they are equally influenced by the Germans and Bay Area thrashers equally, with nods to outliers like Sepultura and Artillery as well. The band tends to sound pretty much the same from album to album, and that is true here as well, but it feels like this is one of the best collection of songs they have put together yet.\n\n10. POUNDER - Uncivilized\n\nHere is another great US band, this time formed by some death metal merchants looking to do something a bit more traditional. Pounder really do a great job covering all the bases and Uncivilized overflows with catchy riffs and melodies, anthemic choruses, and a great deal of diversity. Speed metal like “Red Hot Leather” is followed by a power ballad in the form of the AOR-tinged “Long Time No Love” and both are excellent. Shades of Rainbow permeate tracks like “The Mists of Time” and “Uncivilized.” Early Pretty Maids is a good reference point for the styles covered and the gruff but melodic vocals. Stellar debut and I’m really hoping the band forges on as I think there a great deal of potential here for even better work.\n\n9. TOXIKULL - Cursed and Punished\n\nThis one almost slipped under my radar but glad I managed to hear it. This is the stunning sophomore release from Portugal’s Toxikull and is prime power/speed metal with searing vocals and some of the best change-ups and most memorable choruses of the year. Imagine Judas Priest’s Painkiller with more modern production and even more adrenaline and you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. Clocking in at just over a half hour, this is a solid album that never disappoints.\n\n8. DESTRUCTION - Born to Perish\n\nDestruction was never my favorite of the German thrashers but I still enjoyed most of their albums, even if they started to sound pretty much the same shortly after the reunion in 2000. I felt like something was different with this new one, as the opening snare drum assault of the title track got stuck in my head almost immediately. The overall style is still very much modern, thrashy Destruction, but there seems to be a little more melody overall and the songs feel more thought-out and memorable. It is always heartwarming to hear a band releasing one of their strongest albums this far into their career. Now we just need a US tour…\n\n7. MYSTIK - Mystik\n\nAnother release that I nearly missed out on is Mystik, who hail from Sweden and pack a real wallop of melodic speed metal with compelling vocals and strong choruses. The production is that perfect balance between pro and underground and gives the music a really timeless feeling. This is another short album that gets to the point and delivers, song after song. The vocals remind me a bit of early Warlock and Acid, while the music has a darker edge and the two complement each other to a T.\n\n6. ROTTING CHRIST - The Heretics\n\nThese Greek pioneers have really walked a wide-ranging path over the years, from raw black metal to polished gothic metal, and on into uncharted realms where those elements and more all come together in sublime fashion. There is a truly epic quality to the songs on The Heretics, even with all of the songs being in the 3-5 minute range. Gruff vocals are juxtaposed with clean backing vocals and chanted choruses, with the music covering equally diverse ground. A work of startling, dark beauty and possibly my favorite Rotting Christ record to date.\n\n5. VULTURE - Ghastly Waves & Battered Graves\n\nThis is pure German speed metal, with frantic yet melodic riffs, relentless drums, and piercing vocals. Bands like Ranger and Speedtrap brought the sound back to life a few years back and Vulture really take it to the next level. The aggression and rawness is still intact, with nods to early Exodus, but there is a keen sense of melody and strong songwriting that runs throughout the record. Plus, possibly the best album title of the year.\n\n4. AVATARIUM - The Fire I Long For While\n\nI have always enjoyed Avatarium’s records, this is the first time that it feels like the band has really come into its own and produced a remarkable piece of art in the process. The heavy, doomy riffs are still plentiful, but there is a deeper resonance to the melodies and riffs than ever before. The powerful vocals of Jennie-Ann Smith take the center seat, but the increased use of organ and fuzz-heavy guitars and bass really rounds out the sound. The shift from 100% Leif Edling-penned songs to the majority coming from Smith and guitarist Marcus Jidell also no doubt lends to the more unique character of The Fire I Long For (though I must say that “Epitaph of Heroes” would be right at home on Ancient Dreams).\n\n3. DEATH ANGEL - Humanicide\n\nAs much as I love many bay area thrash bands, I think Death Angel have secured themselves as my all-time favorite. Their first three albums are timeless and the albums since the reunion have been close behind. The worst thing I can say about any of the records is that they are good but maybe not as memorable as the ones before (notably The Evil Divide and Killing Season). Humanicide is probably my favorite since The Art of Dying, with a wide range of styles, memorable choruses, and the artistic blend of rough and polished that Death Angel does so well.\n\n2. SOILWORK - Verkligheten\n\nIt has been a while since I’ve paid that much attention to Soilwork and now I wonder if I’ve been missing out because this album is a monster. The combination of styles here, from melodic death metal with blastbeats to 80s metal to frantic thrash is intoxicating and executed so perfectly, the album just blows right by. “Full Moon Shoals” exemplifies the range perfectly, with one of the best bridges I’ve heard in ages. It feels like Bjorn’s involvement in the retro-minded Night Flight Orchestra has helped to give Soilwork a broader sound as well as a tighter focus on crafting the songs into something more than just a collection of riffs. Even the bonus Underworld EP is consistently strong, while many bands would just toss their throwaway tracks on such a release. For a band’s 11th album, Verkligheten is not just above average but near the top of the band’s best works, period.\n\n1. SACRED REICH - Awakening\n\nSacred Reich was one of the brightest stars of the late 80s thrash wave, with a strong debut and a timeless follow-up, but, like so many others, they lost their way in the 90s and eventually disbanded. Although it took the band 23 years to finally get their comeback record out, damn, it was totally worth the wait. Everything that I love about Sacred Reich is here: speedy riffs mixed with chugging mosh parts, a hypnotic rhythm section, Phil’s one-of-a-kind vocal assault, and every song a winner. Even “Death Valley,” which I didn’t care much for on first spin, has grown on me with its groovy, stoner vibe. The timing couldn’t be more perfect for Sacred Reich’s heartfelt, socially-conscious lyrics, too, and Awakening is hopefully just that: the dawn of a whole new era for OD and tha Reich!\n\nThere may not have been any big-name releases this year, but the underground came through with a ton of brilliant new releases. Narrowing down my list to 20 was more difficult than ever this year and I’d like to mention several other bands that nearly made the list: ALCEST, ANGEL WITCH, APHRODITE, BARBARIAN, CALYX, CRYPT SERMON, DEMON HEAD, EXCUSE, HAUNT, HELLISH GRAVE, KRYPTOS, LUCIFERA, METAL INQUISITOR, ROCK GODDESS, SANHEDRIN, SCREAMER, SMOULDER, and SPIRIT ADRIFT. Definitely check out any and all of these albums, preferably on Bandcamp where you can also buy them.\n\nWith so many smaller and retro-minded bands hitting the scene this year, there were also plenty of demos, EPs and 7” singles. Among the best: BEASTMAKER, CIRITH UNGOL DENIAL OF GOD, GALAXY, HAUNT, MIDNIGHT DICE, MIDNIGHT SPELL, SHADOW WARRIOR, SOLICITOR, SOURCE, THE NIGHT ETERNAL, TYRANN, and VISIGOTH. GALAXY in particular has the potential to really be something special and I can’t wait for their next release.\n\nWill 2020 top this year? Hard to say, but there are plenty of promising releases on the way from SODOM, HELLOWEEN, DELAIN, NIGHTWISH, DARK ANGEL, and LUCIFER. Maybe MEGADETH will surprise us with a worthy comeback, too, you never know. It will be a chaotic year for the world, no doubt, so we are going to need some good, solid metal releases to help us cope. Horns up!\n\nTOP 20 ROCK/METAL ALBUMS OF 2018\n\nThis has been a year of surprises and disappointments in pretty equal measure. Judas Priest blew me away with their latest record (and tour) and Immortal made one of the most triumphant comebacks in metal history. On the other hand, Voivod’s new one felt strangely by-the-numbers, as did the latest from Riot V and Monster Magnet. Still, the sheer amount of releases out there, just in the traditional metal and thrash scenes, is somewhat mind-boggling, and there were plenty of excellent albums to be found.\n\n(Countries represented this year: Italy, UK, Sweden, Norway, Germany, USA, Canada, Switzerland, Portugal, and Denmark).\n\n20. BURNING WITCHES - Hexenhammer\n\nSwitzerland is a tiny nation, but they have given the world some of the most creative and diverse bands over the years, from Krokus to Celtic Frost to Samael and beyond. Burning Witches combine elements of melodic thrash and classic heavy metal for a sound that works quite well and is perfectly suited to Seraina Telli’s powerful vocal delivery. The album has its ups and downs but the title track and “Open Your Mind” are both flat-out brilliant.\n\n19. PERPETRATÖR - Altered Beast\n\nThis is how I like my thrash metal: fast, evil, dirty, but still well-played and composed. Perpetratör hail from Portugal and this is only their second full album, but it is a scorcher. Songs like “Extreme Barbarity” and “Terminal Possession” are brutally fast in the vein of the early Germans, but the band explore some more mid-tempo riffs here and there as well. Like all my favorite thrash bands, these guys sound like they are playing just on the edge of what they can get away with and the effect is electric.\n\n18. ARTILLERY - The Face of Fear\n\nThese Danish thrashers are one of those bands that has always had consistently quality releases but, for whatever reason, never really made the impact others in the genre have over the years. While the line-up has changed over time, the current incarnation has done three albums together now and sounds quite comfortable here. The drum sound is a bit ‘bonky’ for my tastes, but the quality of the tunes rises above it. Bonus points for the variety of songs on offer, too, from speedy, complex thrash, to power ballads to straight-ahead heavy metal.\n\n17. LUCIFER - II\n\nLucifer’s brand of retro doom rock is both obvious in its influences and original in its assembly of said influences. The jazzier side of early Sabbath is the most prevalent element at work here, with riffs that range from heavy and evil to mournful and atmospheric. Despite some line-up changes, the sound is pretty consistent with the excellent debut from 2015, with perhaps a bit more clarity in the production (though nowhere near polished-sounding, fear not).\n\n16. WITCHING HOUR - …And Silent Grief Shadows the Passing Moon\n\nThe number of excellent bands with ‘witch’ in their name is strangely high this year and Germany’s Witching Hour are another to add to that list. This is their third full-length and displays a great deal of maturity and talent for writing complex yet compelling songs. Elements of black and thrash metal abound, but there is a lot of other stuff going on here, too, and lots of melody. The bass playing is particularly impressive and really adds a whole extra dimension to the music, while the vocals are a potent mix of plaintive and grim and complement the dark, intricate songs beautifully. This was a late-year release and, given some more spins, it will likely rise on this list.\n\n15. SATAN - Cruel Magic\n\nIt is rare that a band can pull together their classic line-up the way that Satan did in 2013, let alone one that can then proceed to release three albums back-to-back that fall right in line with their old material. Cruel Magic is the latest of these and has all the hallmarks that made Satan great: finely-crafted heavy metal that is speedy and complex, organic production, and an overall sound that is truly their own. They may have only caught the tail-end of the NWOBHM but damn if they weren’t one of the scene’s best and it is heart-warming to see and hear them continuing the legacy 35 years later.\n\n14. ABYSMAL GRIEF - Blasphema Secta\n\nAbysmal Grief are Italian doom masters that create a sound that is heavy, gothic, creepy, and relentless all at once. Most songs are in the 8-9 minute range and are usually centered around a few core riffs, but the way the band build them up and vary them throughout really pulls the listener in. Keyboards are used quite a bit and to great effect, while the vocals range from mournful to menacing. The band has kept a very consistent style since day one, with only the production getting a little better with each release, and Blasphema Secta sounds both heavier and cleaner than anything prior.\n\n13. STRIKER - Play to Win\n\nBeen following these stalwart Canucks since their debut EP a decade ago and I’m glad to see that they have continued to evolve and refine their sound with each new album. Play to Win is probably the most ‘commercial’ release to date, with tons of melody and big choruses, but there is still plenty of heaviness on tracks like “Heart of Lies” and “Summoner” to keep a nice balance. Striker has gotten really good at writing distinctive songs that aren’t just a collection of riffs but actual, well-constructed tunes.\n\n12. BULLET - Dust to Gold\n\nThis Swedish quintet has been bashing it out for 15+ years and still manages to release an invigorating collection of hard rockin’ metal tunes. Stylistically, Dust to Gold covers a fair amount of ground, from heavy metal in the vein of Accept and Grave Digger to more upbeat rockers ala Krokus and AC/DC. The common denominator throughout is a sense of fun that is missing from entirely too many albums these days.\n\n11. LEATHER - II\n\nLeather’s powerful voice was always the thing that raised Chastain from a good band to a great one and I’m pleased to report that she sounds just as good in 2018 as she did in 1988. The opening track “Juggernaut” is one of the best speed metal songs I have heard in a while and the rest of the album is consistently good, too. Shades of Dio and Priest color the wide range of tunes here and the band turn in some excellent, spirited performances. Glad to see Leather back on the scene and, as much as I enjoyed the Chastain reunion records, I think this one is even better.\n\n10. HAUNT - Burst Into Flame\n\nAlthough I enjoyed the first Haunt EP, the full-length debut really takes it up a notch. This is classic, old-school heavy metal that reminds me a bit of the first couple of Cauldron albums, with some wonderful dual-guitar work thrown in for good measure. The vocals are clean but remarkably restrained compared to some of the screamers out there, making for a nice change of pace. Songs “Reflectors” and “Burst Into Flame” have a haunting (ahem) timelessness to them and the album flows really well from start to finish.\n\n9. THE NIGHT FLIGHT ORCHESTRA - Sometimes the World Ain’t Enough\n\nDespite featuring members of Soilwork and Arch Enemy, this is a long, long way from death metal, melodic or otherwise. Although the band’s first effort had a distinctly late-70s hard rock vibe to it, each record since has taken the listener deeper into the world of 80s AOR. Unlike a lot of the sterile, radio-friendly acts from that actual era, NFO bring a warmth and heartfelt approach that really brings the music alive. This is the band’s fourth album and probably their weakest, but it still stands well above the average album of 2018. Songs like “Turn To Miami” and “Pretty Thing Closing In” are immediate, timeless classics.\n\n8. THE CROWN - Cobra Speed Venom\n\nAlthough Deathrace King is still one of my top 5 death metal records of all time, The Crown never really were able to duplicate its genius. Cobra Speed Venom, however, comes damn close. It has all the brutality that the band is known for but brings back a lot of the punky/thrash energy and memorable riffs that have been missing for a while. The first three songs might be the best start to any album this year; just relentless, mayhemic brilliance. Top it off with one of the coolest and most original album covers I’ve seen in a while, along with three bonus tracks that are actually worth adding, and you have one hell of a return to form.\n\n7. SAXON - Thunderbolt\n\nSaxon certainly made some missteps in the late 80s, but I can’t think of another band that has remained as true to form over the years, while also consistently putting out quality albums and touring relentlessly. Thunderbolt is no Wheels of Steel or even Call To Arms, but it is still a solid record that is as good or better than the last couple. From the melodic timelessness of “The Secret of Flight” to the moody “Nosferatu (The Vampire’s Waltz)” to the raging “They Played Rock and Roll,” there is also a diversity rivaled only by Priest on this list.\n\n6. BLACK OATH - Behold the Abyss\n\nWhen it comes to true, epic, soul-crushing doom metal, Black Oath have become true masters. I have been following this band since the Portrait of the Dead single back in 2010 and am pleased to say they just keep going from strength to strength. Behold the Abyss balances a lush production, clean vocals, and plenty of melody, with dreadnought riffage and blissfully dark, esoteric lyrics. A rich, dynamic work of black art.\n\n5. SIGN OF THE JACKAL - Breaking the Spell\n\nThis amazing Italian band has created a style that is equal parts early 80s Warlock and late 80s Judas Priest. Great, driving metal tunes that sometimes border on speed metal with plenty of screaming solos and hooky choruses. The recording, the mix, the energy, everything about this record is incredibly old-school and authentic, right down to the 32-minute running time.\n\n4. AUDREY HORNE - Blackout\n\nEver since these Norwegian rockers abandoned all pretense and went full-on retro with their Youngblood album, I have been hooked. They compose hard-hitting rock tunes with tons of hooks and Lizzy-esque harmonies that give a nod to metal and punk without really being either. The first three songs - “This is War,” “Audrevolution,” and “Blackout” - are all perfectly built and give a great cross-section of the band’s diverse sound. Toschie’s vocals are as unique as his fashion sense and, as much as I loved the last two records, I think this one may be their best yet.\n\n3. BRAINSTORM - Midnight Ghost\n\nBrainstorm has long since perfected their style (as far back as Soul Temptation, some fifteen years ago), and each new release is really just varying levels of execution. As good as Scary Creatures was a couple years back, Midnight Ghost is truly brilliant and may possibly take the title as my favorite Brainstorm outing. All of the usual plusses are in place - great production, top-notch musicianship, catchy tunes - but the songs themselves are just a tad bit more finely honed and memorable. “Ravenous Minds” and “When Pain Becomes Real” in particular are killer and there is nary a dull moment here.\n\n2. IMMORTAL - Northern Chaos Gods\n\nMy first Immortal record was At the Heart of Winter and it is still my favorite black metal album, hands down. The combination of raw, icy riffs with the mind-blowing drumming and just enough melody to keep it all together was/is intoxicating. Immortal has never done a bad album, but some are definitely better than others and Northern Chaos Gods is one of the best ones. The ferocity is up there with Pure Holocaust and Demonaz’s vocals, while not quite as distinctive as Abbath’s, fit the music perfectly. The band wisely took their time to put this record together and the results speak for themselves.\n\n1. JUDAS PRIEST - Firepower\n\nPriest has been one of my favorite metal bands since I first got into them back in ’82 and they are still right up there with Sabbath, Accept, and Mercyful Fate, with a catalog that is as diverse as it is brilliant. After the disappointing Nostradamus and good-but-not-great Redeemer of Souls, it was a real pleasure to hear Firepower, a true, all-guns-blazing Priest record. The production is 1000% better than anything they have released in the last two decades and the material is both diverse and top-notch. Songs like “Firepower,” “Never the Heroes,” “Children of the Sun,” and “No Surrender” have such a classic sound to them and Rob has not sounded this good since Painkiller. Even the weakest tracks (“Lone Wolf” and “Sea of Red”) have grown on me a bit, so I am confident that Firepower will go down in history as one of the band’s crowning achievements.\n\nI must also mention some very impressive EPs, demos, and singles that were released this year, namely those from CIRITH UNGOL, ROUGH SPELLS, ÜLTRA RAPTÖR, PULVER, SIGNIFICANT POINT, TENTATION, ANCIENT SÉANCE, SABÏRE, and OCCULT BURIAL. If you aren’t familiar with any of these bands or haven’t heard their latest, I highly recommend getting acquainted immediately.\n\nAs usual, my list could have gone on much longer, but here are the bands that just missed the top 20: AMORPHIS, AURA NOIR, BEHEMOTH, BLACK REBEL MOTORCYCLE CLUB, BLACK VIPER, BLADE KILLER, CAULDRON, DIMMU BORGIR, DREAM CHILD, GOAT WORSHIP, GRAHAM BONNETT BAND, IRON ANGEL, KHEMMIS, KRISIUN, NIGHT VIPER, PRIMAL FEAR, PROFESSOR BLACK, RIOT V, SABOTER, SKULL FIST, SUBSTRATUM, TAD MOROSE, VISIONS OF ATLANTIS, VULCAIN, WHITE WIZZARD, WITCHFYRE, and WYTCH HAZEL.\n\nWhat is on the horizon for 2019? Well, I am already psyched about the new ones from CANDLEMASS, DELAIN, ROCK GODDESS, FLOTSAM & JETSAM, CHAINBREAKER, SOILWORK, WITHIN TEMPTATION, MORTAL SCEPTER, HAMMERFALL, and TYTUS, plus possible releases from SACRED REICH, DEATH ANGEL, and EXCITER all have me really looking forward to the coming twelve months. The world is crumbling around us, but at least the metal scene is stronger than ever!\n\nI was never interested in writing about politics or religion. Politics were for the punk bands. Religious stuff was for people without anything else in their heads.\n\n- Demonaz\n\n(Source: kerrang.com)\n\nTop 20 Non-Metal Albums of 2017\n\nSo, while my passion has long been heavy metal, there is so much other great music out there I felt it was worth my time to compile a list of the best of the rest. These twenty albums represent quite a number of genres, but they all share the quality of being awesome…\n\n1. BLACK SEAGULL - Distant Lullabies\n\nAfter the heart-breaking demise of one of my favorite band of the last two decades, On Trial, I was overjoyed to hear that a couple of ex-members had formed a new band called Black Seagull. While the sound is a bit more mellow and countrified, the songwriting quality is still top-notch and it sounds very much like a logical continuation of the Forever album.\n\n2. ANVIL STRYKEZ - Anvil Strykez\n\nMy first impression was this would be a half-assed synthwave late-comer, based on the name, song titles, and album art, but damn if this isn’t one of the most thoroughly engaging albums all around. Vocoded vocals, pure 80s synth and drum machines, well-placed guitars, and a completely memorable and different approach for each tune add up to one hell of a spin.\n\n3. DEPECHE MODE - Spirit\n\nThe past few Mode records have been consistently good, if not quite as memorable as Playing the Angel or any of the classics. Spirit is a different beast and my favorite album of theirs since Songs of Faith and Devotion way back in in ’93. The songs “Going Backwards” and “Where’s the Revolution” rank right up there with anything they have penned and the lyrics throughout the album are the perfect reflection of our current state of devolved world affairs.\n\n4. POPPY - poppy.computer\n\nIt’s happening again. Some things are weird. Let’s appreciate together. Am I doing this right? Someone sent me this. Can you see it? These are cotton swabs. Poppy loves politics. You are Poppy. I’m Poppy. Everybody wants to be Poppy, Poppy.\n\n5. SNIFF ‘N’ THE TEARS - Random Elements\n\nOne of those groups that, save for one big top-40 hit back in 1979, has flown under the radar but consistently released top-notch albums over the years. Paul Roberts is the singer/songwriter that has helmed the group since the start (and even paints all the album covers) and he still sounds as unique as ever. He writes songs that have a certain melancholy to them that has always struck a chord with me and Random Elements is full of them.\n\n6. DANCE WITH THE DEAD - B-Sides: Volume 1\n\nWhile synthwave acts like GosT and Carpenter Brut have made a considerable number of fans among metalheads, Dance With the Dead goes the furthest in actually combining the styles. Retro synth lines are still the dominant feature but the chugging, thrashy riffs are nearly as omnipresent and the band add some very well-placed (and well-played) guitar solos on many tracks. This is their latest and they have only gone from strength to strength.\n\n7. THE HAXANS - Party Monsters\n\nThis is the kind of thing I would usually roll my eyes at and dismiss straight away but this duo has put together a collection of songs that are so infectious, I can’t stop listening to it. It is the perfect mix of death punk, pop, and Rob Zombie-eque horror metal. Vocalist Ashley Costello is a real gem, too, delivering the campy lyrics with the perfect mix of sensuality and power.\n\n8. KMFDM - Hell Yeah\n\nThese die-hard industrial rockers have been releasing slight variations on the same album for the past 25 years or so but, hey, it’s a fucking great album. Hell Yeah isn’t quite up there with WTF?! or WWIII but it’s better than the last couple and their revolutionary calls to action have never been timelier.\n\n9. THE NIGHT FLIGHT ORCHESTRA - Amber Galactic\n\nWhen it comes to paying tribute to classic AOR from the 70s and 80s, no one does it better and with more enthusiasm than The Night Flight Orchestra. Amber Galactic is not as consistently brilliant as the first two albums but it is still great and the song “Domino” is an instant classic.\n\n10. SIINAI - Sykli\n\nThis is Finnish ambient space trance. Repetitive, hypnotic electronics, looping guitars - it’s the perfect soundtrack for some meditation or that long, slow flight into the night. I’m always looking for chill stuff like this that works and, damn, this is executed with utmost perfection.\n\n11. CHEAP TRICK - We’re All Alright!\n\nWhile Cheap Trick made some pretty mediocre records in the 80s and 90s, their 70s albums all stand up as classics and they have done some good work in recent years, too, most notably 2009’s The Latest. We’re All Alright! might be even better and the first half in particular is loaded with some well-crafted and hard rocking tunes.\n\n12. CURSED MOON - Rite of Darkness\n\nThis album positively reeks of early-80s death rock in all the best ways. You’ve got driving basslines, reverby guitars, and gloomy synths, with the added bonus of gruff vocals that are more in the vein of early black or death metal. Not a ton of variety from song to song but it’s a highly enjoyable sound that works for a full album.\n\n13. THE MOON AND THE NIGHT SPIRIT - Metanoia\n\nThis is a cool Hungarian duo that has been around for a good 15 years now. They make a very enchanting brand of folky darkwave with dreamy melodies and ethereal vocals. This is the first time I have had a chance to hear them since I fell in love with their 2011 album Mohalepte a few years back and I’m pleased to report they haven’t lost any of their charms.\n\n14. LEGEND - Midnight Champion\n\nDuo from Iceland that manages to capture the vibe and quality of classic industrial-rock and infuse it with modern and rather epic touches. The songs don’t just kick in and race to a catchy chorus; you have to be patient. The payoff is always worth it, though, and each songs follows its own dramatic course.\n\n15. ADRENALINE RUSH - Soul Survivor\n\nThe debut from these Swedish hard rockers back in 2014 was a captivating collection of tunes that lived up to the band’s name. Soul Survivor is not quite as consistently good but it still has some damn fine tracks. The sound is big, melodic and surprisingly metal at times, with Tave Wanning’s vocals adding a great deal of charm, passion, and distinctiveness to the proceedings.\n\n16. JESUS AND MARY CHAIN - Damage and Joy\n\nI’ll admit I never paid much attention to these Scotts until the Automatic album came out and blew me away. Sadly, they seem to have slowly disintegrated after that, but after a lengthy break, they managed to return with one hell of a comeback record. Damage and Joy has some of the feedback from the early years, some of the electronics of the later years, and all of the sardonic humor and Velvet Underground chord progressions you would hope for.\n\n17. BLONDIE - Pollinator\n\nBlondie has had some good tunes since their reunion in 1999 but this is the first album where nearly every track is a winner. The three most important contributors to the band’s sound - Debbie Harry, guitarist Chris Stein, and drummer Clem Burke - are all still intact and in great form.\n\n18. BLACK MARE - Death Magick Mother\n\nThis is the solo project from Sera Timms, the lead vocalist of Ides of Gemini. Here she takes a far more traditional gothic tone with the music, while her vocals take on an even more ethereal feel than in Ides. No individual song really stands out but it all works together beautifully as a complete album.\n\n19. RAINBOWLICKER - I Saw The Light But Turned It Off\n\nMy first listen to this Finnish outfit was truly one of those WTF moments. Elements of punk, electro, chiptune, industrial and goth all merge together with some suitably peculiar, snotty vocals to make a fresh sound that is at once annoying and endearing.\n\n20. TARJA - From Spirits and Ghosts (Score for a Dark Christmas)\n\nChristmas albums have a tendency to be either too campy or too cliched for their own good. Tarja instead presents a collection of traditional (and one original) tunes done up in a suitably dramatic and darkly original fashion. While her solo rock albums have left me rather flat, I love her voice and the orchestral pairing is simply gorgeous. No one sounds like Tarja, no matter how hard they try.\n\nSome more bands with great releases in 2017 to check out if you are curious: AGUSA, BARDSPEC, CAMERATA MEDIOLANENS, DAN TERMINUS, FLAMES OF GENESIS, GALLEY BEGGAR, IIVII, KESHA, L.A. WITCH, LIVING COLOUR, PERTURBATOR, ROPE SECT, SOROR DOLOROSA, and UFFE LORENZEN.\n\nTop 20 Heavy Metal Albums of 2017\n\nWhile it has been a tragic year in many respects (natural disasters, mass shootings, data breaches, a political hellscape, etc.), there has been more good music unleashed on the world than ever. I’ve spent the past few weeks trying to narrow down just the stuff I have had a chance to listen to to a top 20 list and finally gave up. So, this year, I am splitting my list in two: one of metal releases and one of everything else.\n\nI’ll start with the metal releases. Several of these are new(er) bands I have discovered through Bandcamp and Youtube, but the majority are long-time favorites. Countries represented this year: USA (x7), Germany (x4), Sweden (x2), Japan (x2), Finland, Norway, Italy, Chile, and the U.K.\n\nWithout further ado, here are my top 20 fave metal records (and tapes) of 2017…\n\n20. EVIL - Rites of Evil\n\nBands that can successfully mix old-school black metal with thrash and/or speed metal always get my attention and Evil from Japan do it pretty damn well. Elements of early (like, REALLY early) Sodom are combined with Hellhammer to great effect, with lots of cool change-ups and a very raw production style.\n\n19. JACK STARR’S BURNING STARR - Stand Your Ground\n\nFrom his early work with Virgin Steele and amazing solo album with Rhett Forrester (RIP) back in 1984, Jack Starr has had a long and varied career. I was expecting Stand Your Ground to be good, just based on the last record, but damn it is some really top-notch US power metal. Only a few bands are doing this kind of material justice and it’s great to see one of the scene’s legends still out there and at the top of their game.\n\n18. JAG PANZER - The Deviant Chord\n\nIt’s been, what, six years since the last Jag Panzer record? Damn good to have them back though and worth the wait. The band’s brand of US power metal is still intact, with a good mix of the faster, heavier stuff and more expansive, melodic songs. It’s not the band’s best album, sure, but it is still a strong return after a long break.\n\n17. RAM - Rod\n\nRam really knocked it out of the park with their previous album so Rod was bound to be a bit of a disappointment. Still, there are many great songs here and even the six-part conceptual piece that makes up half of the album works remarkably well. Classic heavy metal is alive and well.\n\n16. SATYRICON - Deep Calleth Upon Deep\n\nThis one almost didn’t make my list because, frankly, I forgot it came out until I started looking back over the year. Which isn’t to say it isn’t memorable, only that I never got a copy of it to really give it a proper listen. Glad that I finally did, though, because it is a huge return to form after the rather disappointing eponymous release of 2013. The smoldering menace of Now, Diabolical is back in all its glory, with the drums possessing a particularly wonderful, organic thump.\n\n15. MIDNIGHT - Sweet Death and Ecstasy\n\nWhen it comes to filthy, punky black metal that worships at the altar of Venom, it is hard to beat Midnight. Having said that, No Mercy For Mayhem (2014) was a bit of a let-down after the still-brilliant Satanic Royalty (2011). Sweet Death and Ecstasy is right in between the two, with a couple of slower, more experimental cuts and fairly memorable songs in general.\n\n14. WALPYRGUS - Walpyrgus Nights\n\nDespite a logo and album art that looks more like black or doom metal, this band from Raleigh play a very potent brand of melodic metal with clean vocals and lots of guitar harmonies. Closest comparison I can think of is Immortal Soul-era Riot. Very catchy vocal lines, killer riffs, and strong songwriting all around make this one of the year’s most underrated albums.\n\n13. ACCEPT - The Rise of Chaos\n\nAccept pulled off a miracle by reforming without their iconic singer and then proceeding to release and tour 3 amazing albums in 5 years. While Stalingrad was the highpoint, Blind Rage was still a great album and The Rise of Chaos follows in similar fashion. It has a good mix of modern, heavier tracks like “No Regrets” and really classic-sounding cuts like “Analog Man.” One could argue that the band hasn’t progressed at all (and they would probably be the first to agree), but the release of another quality Accept record simply makes the world a better place.\n\n12. KREATOR - Gods of Violence\n\nKreator are easy to take for granted, as they deliver an album every few years that is always solid, kick-ass thrash metal with killer production. There are a number of great thrash bands out there (new and old), but I think Kreator are probably the most proficient and dependable of the lot. Gods of Violence is definitely on par with Phantom Antichrist and delivers at least one instant concert classic with “Totalitarian Terror.”\n\n11. MYRKUR - Mareridt\n\nMulti-instrumentalist Amalie Bruun is really evolving her brand of melodic black metal with this record, her second full-length album. One thing I really appreciate about this one is that each song is very distinctive and incorporates many different instruments and vocal styles. The guest appearance by Chelsea Wolfe doesn’t hurt either. One of the few critical darlings that actually deserves the attention.\n\n10. BOLIDO - Heavy Bombers\n\nChile is turning into a real hotbed for quality metal of all genres lately and Bolido is one of my favorite in the classic vein. They have a real talent for coming up with interesting riffs that are offbeat yet 100% metal. Just check out opening track “The Absolute Dominion of the Skies” and get hooked.\n\n9. SATAN’S HALLOW - Satan’s Hallow\n\nThe Midwest has been sourcing some great bands in recent years and Chicago’s Satan’s Hallow are right up there with the best of them. Their sound is very reminiscent of the NWOBHM, with plenty of catchy riffs, strong vocals and a healthy dose of speed now and then. More old-school metal for us aging headbangers!\n\n8. ORDEN OGAN - Gunmen\n\nWhile power metal as a whole has seen better days, certain bands are still out there delivering the goods and Germany’s Orden Ogan are one of my favorites. They manage to combine super-catchy melodies and huge choruses with fast and heavy riffage. Gunmen isn’t quite as good as 2015’s Ravenhead but it is damn close. Bonus: Liv Kristine guest vocal!\n\n7. EMYN MUIL - Elenion Ancalima\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Summoning, Italy’s Emyn Muil create epic pieces with a Viking metal flair and lyrics and imagery straight from Middle Earth. Grim vocals are used as another instrument to add to the atmosphere and the songs remain engaging throughout, despite their long running times.\n\n6. VENOM INC. - Ave\n\nI’m not sure exactly what people were expecting from this release but I was actually quite pleased. It continues in the vein of the Prime Evil-era Venom (naturally) but with a bit more of the ferocity of the early years. It is great to see these guys out there playing the classics on stage but I was happy they were also able to deliver a high-quality release of new tunes, too.\n\n5. OUTRAGE - Raging Out\n\nLong one of my favorite thrash bands, Japan’s Outrage went through some interesting turns in the 90s (who didn’t), but they have really returned to form with the last couple releases and Raging Out is one of their best to date. Pure old-school thrash with modern production. Still has some of the Metallica influence from the early days but it’s much less obvious now.\n\n4. MIDNIGHT RIDER - Manifestation\n\nI remember getting this band’s first EP about a decade ago and loving their mix of early Priest and Sabbath but then never heard from them again. Until 2017, when this full album comes out of nowhere and not only lives up to the earlier work but exceeds it in every way. If you ever wish Priest had recorded more albums in the vein of Stained Class and Sad Wings of Destiny, this album is for you. The production and mix are perfect, too, coming across as 1978 with more clarity and impact.\n\n3. VAMPIRE - With Primeval Force\n\nWhen Vampire first hit the scene, I was skeptical due to the hype and anonymity of the members, plus the debut was kind of underwhelming. Fortunately, their sophomore effort is leaps and bounds better, taking their raw, old-school thrash sound to new levels. They mix speed and brutality with a surprising amount of melody and skilled musicianship and the results are a frenzy of headbanging goodness.\n\n2. MAUSOLEUM GATE - Into a Dark Divinity\n\nThis Finnish outfit has been going for a few years now and never disappoints with their wonderfully eclectic mix of heavy metal, 70s hard rock, doom, and organ-heavy weirdness. Hints of Uriah Heep, BOC, Judas Priest, and Candlemass all shine through, but no description can really capture the band’s unique sound. Every track is epic in feel, even the shorter ones.\n\n1. SANHEDRIN - A Funeral For The World\n\nThe cover and title scream ‘doom metal’ but Brooklyn trio Sanhedrin tend more toward the likes of classic Diamond Head or… I don’t even know what. They cover a lot of ground and, yes, even some doom territory with the title cut, but it’s never anything less than killer, memorable metal. Can’t wait to see what this band does in the future.\n\nAs I said earlier, narrowing this list down to just 20 was a major chore. Of the bands that were very serious contenders but just didn’t quite make it are the latest from: ALDIOUS, ALPHA TIGER, ARCH ENEMY, BATTLE RAIDER, CONDOR, CULT OF EIBON, DEMON EYE, THE FERRYMEN, GOD DETHRONED, ICE AGE, L.A. GUNS, LADY BEAST, LIMBONIC ART, LYZZARD, MALLEUS, NIGHT, NIGHT VIPER, OBITUARY, OVERKILL, PORTRAIT, SEVEN KINGDOMS, SHAKRA, SLAEGT, SORCERER, STALKER, STRIKER, TYFON’S DOOM, URN, VHÄLDEMAR, VINTERSORG, and VULTURE.\n\nOn top of that, there were many excellent demos, 7” singles, and EPs this year. My favorites came from BOMBER, COVEN, CRIME, CROWN OF COMMAND, CULT OF EIBON, DREADFUL FATE, FORGED IN BLACK, FREEWAYS, HAUNT, KROSSFYRE, LUCIFER’S HAMMER, MIDNIGHT PREY, ORNASSI PAZUZU, POUNDER, ROCK GODDESS, and SPEEDCLAW. Rock Goddess in particular was nice to see back in action and I hope they manage to release a full album next year because the EP was very promising (despite the less than sterling production).\n\nAs good as the year was, I think 2018 has the potential to be a stunner. New albums from the mighty JUDAS PRIEST and SAXON are on the way soon, not to mention MONSTER MAGNET, SUMMONING, WHITE WIZZARD, LOUDNESS, TRIBULATION, POSSESSED, RIOT V, and VOIVOD. Plus… IMMORTAL… maybe? Finally?? It was promised in 2017 so here’s hoping it will finally appear. And maybe a new HADES ALMIGHTY, too? Stranger things have happened…\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nOther Space Episode 1: Into the Great Beyond...Beyond\n\nA great, great show that needs a second season (at least)…"
