        "text": "Lee Toma spotted a gull panting in the heat at Tenean Beach in Dorchester yesterday afternoon. If only there were a way for the bird to cool down there. And, yes, the gull looks way bigger compared to the tank than it really is, so don't have any nightmares about giant gulls.\n\nHeadline inspired by Sarah E. Bourne.\n\nWhen you think of birds at Jamaica Pond, what normally comes to mind are ducks, geese, maybe cormorants and swans. There's usually a flock of seagulls, too, it's just they rarely get near the shore - let alone come up and stand on it, like this gull did late this afternoon.\n\nSteve Klise spotted this young seagull at a Northern Avenue parking garage about to take a snort in disgust at the attempt to ban him from Castle Island.\n\nA disgusted citizen filed a 311 report after being dive bombed by a seagull at lunch time on West 3rd and C streets in South Boston this afternoon: Read more.\n\nNever mind the Goat, we've got the Seagull - and a British tourist was there to record it all on Salem Street in the North End - and provide appropriately horrified commentary, because nothing like this ever happens in jolly old England.\n\nVia Megan Johnson.\n\nKelley Hand braved the single-digit temps at Christoper Columbus Park this morning and got to watch seagulls in the sea smoke in Boston Harbor.\n\nJocelyn also scanned the sea smoke on the harbor.\n\nAfter this seagull gave Rick a basic \"Sup, bro?\" at his downtown office this morning, Rick noticed the bird had a metal band around one leg. And it turns out the band may be from a research project up in Maine.\n\nFor the past week, dd808 has watched a bird he's calling Bugsy Seagull attack his or her own reflection in a Government Center window. The Animal Rescue League papered over the window, but Bugsy outsmarted them - he just moved to another window.\n\nRenee Graham went out to her Coolidge Corner driveway this afternoon, only to be confronted with this situation:\n\nGuess I'll take the T tonight...\n\nNot long after, though, the bird flew the, um, coupe: Read more.\n\nSteveBikes spotted this rabbit and young seagull giving each other the eye outside the Boston Athletic Club in South Boston.\n\nUPDATE: As people are telling this bird-agnostic reporter, that's an immature gull, not a tern, so the headline's been adjusted accordingly. And thanks to Earl for the original headline idea."
