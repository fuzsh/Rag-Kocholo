        "text": "Ilosaarirock is after Ruisrock the second oldest festival in Finland. The city Joensuu is welcoming their festival guest always on the second July weekend in eastern Finland. Compared to Ruisrock this year, Ilosaarirock had a better rock´n´roll attitude. Staff and Volunteer workers might wasn´t that familiar with great customer service than in Ruisrock, but the band line-up was amazing and the city Joesnsuu never stopped partying during the weekend. Ilosaari is a festival I recommend everybody to see once in a lifetime. The atmosphere and the people are more than amazing. The weather for the festival weekend was perfect summer, sun and fun. 27 degrees and males without shirt were asking for free hugs – with pen written on the body: krapula hali – hangover hug, someone might got a lot of those.\n\nSaturday evening the truck stage – rekka lava in finnish, presented Finland´s Lost Society. Host Mikko Hakkarainen was welcoming the boys to the stage. He was very proud to present such a young, energetic and trashing hard band. Those guys always get better ideas for their shows, you all remember the red man? Now he is wearing a batman costume and holds a devil pike. After he get´s rid of that one he stage dives and mosh pits with the audience. Not just that was an amusing surprise in Ilosaarirock also frontman Samy showed how to drink beer from his guitar. Great trash metal, amazing sound and the craziness of those boys is attracting the audience to their shows. Wild mosh pitting, but a lot of fun on stage and in the audience made that show so real and great. Everybody in Finland loves Lost Society, time to change this in a world wide basis. Terro Hungry I would say is the best metal trash album of the year, so aggressive and strong it kept the audience going. Best gig ever – or best festival ever. Ilosaarirock and the society that was so lost made the party going on and on…\n\nLet´s festival. Mustasch from Sweden who is playing every year in Ilosaarirock were also a part of it this year. Herra Ylppö & Ihmiset, Happoradio, Stam1na, Lapko and the Blanko were the strong finnish supporting bands in the festival.\n\nThe Blanko just came back from Japan and showed on the sue stage on Sunday what they can. Into the Silence a very great rock album presented live goes under your skin. The sue tent was full, sure Finns are welcoming back a band that just succeeded abroad. Proud that the Blanko released their album now also in Japan and got the chance from Music Finland to perform in the Finland Fest in Tokyo a showcase that was end of May. Also Amorphis, Stam1na, Von Herzen Brothers and Arion were with in Japan: http://musicfinland.fi/en/events/2014/finland-fest-2014\n\nMain headliner for Ilosaarirock on Sunday was Alice in Chains from U.S. I personal wished I could tell more about the show, but it crossed unfortunately with the football world champion finals. Everybody needed to decided what is more important for them to see. A lot of people chose the Alice in Chains gig, might be the last time those guys perform in Finland. I heard they were amazing and fat guys in German and Argentina football trico came to the stage and presented the results of the game between the excellent music entertainment from Alice in Chains. Great humour guys.\n\nIlosaarirock the perfect summer festival. Thank you Joensuu and all the great people that attend to the festival.\n\nPitkä kuuma kesä is a free park concert that is organized every summer in Helsinki´s Alppipuisto. The festival started with lot of sunshine on Sunday the 15.06.2012. 3 stages were welcoming the artists: Fullsteam main stage, Sound-Inn-Paviljonki and Red Bull car stage. Sound-Inn-Paviljonki was the unplug stage. The festival started at 3 pm and run till 9 pm and set a sparkle with Lapko as main act in the end. In total 15 Finnish bands were performing in 30 minutes tact. The Festival was organized by Helsinki´s culture centre (Helsingin kulttuurikeskus) in cooperation with Fullsteam Records http://www.fullsteamrecords.com/home/. Alppipuisto has a lot of free events this summer time, for more information check out their website: http://www.alppipuistonkesa.info/.\n\nThe festival were presenting a few very intersting bands. One of them was Wedding Crashers a power rock band from Helsinki that is under contract with Universal Music. The main band members are: Esa Pottonen (Guitar and Vocals) and Oskari Halsti (Bass and Vocals), Wedding Crashers is a rock trio. More infos about them can be found on their own website: http://weddingcrashersmusic.com/ and to get a taste of Wedding Crashers music take a look at the youtube video Apes, which was produced by Luomustudio.\n\nLuomustudio is a talent video production company from Finland that mainly concentrates on beautiful outdoor music videos: http://www.luomustudio.fi/\n\nPitkä kuuma kesä festival had also the honour of having Helsinki´s talent alternative rock band Face of God playing. After the successful “One world tour” in cooperation with Luomustudio, the Face of God trio joined the festival. “One world” was a project that included a video blog of 60 gigs in 31 days in month May. More information about “One world” can be found here: http://1worldtour.net/ Face of God performed again an awesome acoustic show on the Sound-Inn-Paviljonki stage. The weird lyrics made the people dance and sing and enjoying the sunshine and drinks in the park.\n\nThe main act Lapko for who everybody was waiting and unfortunately it started to rain and didn´t stop as Lapko showed up on stage. But the people didn´t cared and stayed to support them. An audience with open umbrellas enjoyed the strong beats and great lyrics. Ice-cream, flowers and pussies had been an awesome song to have a picnic in the sunshine like in the beginning of that day but on the other hand it warmed also up as the rain cold the temperature a little bit down. The singer of Lapko Ville Malja showed up in white panties and shirt on the stage, he really was feeling the summer. Lapko makes very great alternative rock music related to love and happiness. Even in the rain they could engage a good mood from the audience. The band consists of: Anssi Nordberg (Bass), Ville Malja (Vocals&Guitar) and Janne Heikkonen (Drums). Lapko belongs to the label Fullsteam records, which took also part in the organization of the Festival as alrealdy mention earlier.
