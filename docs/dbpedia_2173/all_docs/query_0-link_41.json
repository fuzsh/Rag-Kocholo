        "text": "Danco Island & Paradise Harbour\n\nDay Four - Antarctica - 2022\n\nMorning first landing on Antarctica, followed by a beautiful afternoon scenic cruise â€¦ until the snow showed up.\n\nEditorâ€™s Comment: This travelogue, unlike the rest on this site, doesnâ€™t dive much into the logistics, planning, and execution of the tour itself; this topic was so expansive I covered it in a separate page, About Ocean Endeavour & Sailing with Intrepid Travel / Chimu Adventures on the Best of Antarctica, which I highly encourage you read as a companion piece to this one.\n\nGiddy as a schoolchild (Do cool people still say that? Yes, of course they do - itâ€™s the children who are out of touch), I took my travel companions up on the opportunity to walk the decks early on the morning of the fourth day. The clouds were swirling blues and purples, and the water in cove was only disturbed by slowly moving ice floes and the wake of the ship. The scenery was absolutely, positively stunning and I sincerely hope these pictures do it justice.\n\nTwo more ice floe photographs follow.\n\n2. Early Morning Ice #2\n\nAfter breakfast and a quick update meeting, the time had arrived. We were going to board the zodiacs and take our first steps on Antarctica!\n\nOur target for the morningâ€™s activity was Danco Island, a small, well, island off the Antarctic peninsula and home to a newly-arrived penguin colony.\n\nIâ€™ve included the video below, which covers our preparations in the mudroom, the boarding of the zodiac boat, and our arrival on Danco Island.\n\nIn the background is Danco Island, and you can see fellow travelers walking up the hill to visit the penguin colony.\n\nI discuss this in more detail in my companion article about Antarctic travel, but regulations only allow for 100 passengers ashore at a site at any one time. So my half of the ship had a scenic cruise around the island before swapping places with those on land. This gave us the chance to see some of Dancoâ€™s magnificent ice floes.\n\nThree ice photographs follow.\n\n7. Danco Island Ice #2\n\nDanco Island is named for Belgian geophysicist, a member of the Belgian Antarctic Expedition who died when his ship became stuck in pack ice.\n\nSoon enough, it was our turn to step foot on the continent. We were given the opportunity to walk up to the gentoo penguin colony as the other group had. As we moved up the hill, snow started to fall to give us the true Antarctica experience. It was lovely!\n\nThe gentoos were funny little creatures to watch, and I enjoyed the time we had there tremendously (even if the snow completely covered my eyeglasses, which I quickly jettisoned!)\n\nSix more gentoo penguin photographs follow, including one of my favorite photographs of all-time (youâ€™ll know the one!)\n\n13. Danco Island Penguins #3\n\nStepping back onto the Ocean Endeavour, I was fully able to take in what had just happened - we just stepped foot on Antarctica! For many, this was their seventh continent (even if they saved their celebration for the mainland); while this wasnâ€™t true for me (Australia still called), it was all the same the realization of a lifelong dream. I felt -and still feel- incredibly fortunate to have been able to take this journey, but it wouldnâ€™t be until our trip back that Iâ€™d really have time to fully explore these emotions (#spoilers).\n\nAfter the cruise, I snuck back out onto the viewing deck to catch some more views of the ice as the ship effortlessly glided along past Lemaire Island.\n\nFour more ice photographs from around Lemaire Island follow.\n\n20. Lemaire Island Ice #2\n\nThis little guy stopped by during my photography session to say hello.\n\nSoon enough, it was time for lunch and another zodiac cruise. This time, we were off to Paradise Harbour. No landing this time, just a scenic tour, but magnificent all the same. As before, I took a video of the adventure â€¦ while a bit shorter than the one from Danco Island, it is 360-degree so you can take in all the sights and sounds.\n\nChinstrap penguins may well be the most abundant type of penguin with over 7.5 million breeding pairs.\n\nQuickly, we came upon this lone chinstrap penguin resting on a small floe of ice. I was a big fan of this guy, nothing really seemed to bother him.\n\nThree more photographs of the chinstrap penguin follow.\n\n26. Paradise Harbour Chinstrip Penguin #2\n\nThere were a few extraordinary circumstances about our voyage to Antarctica: the first, as discussed, was the unseasonable abundance of whale life we saw on the Drake Passage; second, the incredible depth of the snow on land; and, third, the amount of floating ice was much greater than expected. While it made landings way, way more unlikely (you certainly can make landfall at Paradise Harbour in these conditions), you canâ€™t say it isnâ€™t pretty.\n\nA few more Paradise Harbour photographs follow for which words are unsatisfactory.\n\n30.
