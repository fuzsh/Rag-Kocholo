        "text": "Where I live close to the coast there's always been lots, but in recent years we are seeing a lot more inland birds as gulls seem to be heading inland to scavenge.\n\nMost of the rubbish in the streets here seems to be the binmen who make one hell of a mess every week but there are no longer road sweepers if you do not live near a shopping centre or on a main road.\n\n0\n\nWell I don't think they are because there is no such thing as a seagull\n\nCommon usage I suppose. And it’s easier to shout damn seagulls when they nick your ice cream, chips, or poo on you head.\n\nAnd listed by the major dictionaries as an informal term synonymous with gull. A case could be made that it's a tautology as gulls' natural habitat is the sea and its margins, but that's easy to forget when you see them standing on a litter bin and glaring at passers-by in the middle of Birmingham.\n\n2\n\nI love them... and pigeons. We share this planet with all the wildlife.\n\nCome and stay here for a while then. There are 3 baby gulls on an unoccupied bungalow roof nearby. They start screaming for food at 3.45 a.m. and several adults start flying around screaming. Then the pigeons start up and this continues on and off until darkness. Sleep? Joke!\n\n0"
