        "text": "1.\n\nComing Over Your Eyes 03:43\n\nIt is on! A saturday night and we’re cruisin' 'round the boulevard Small team on a porn-movie set In my van cause we couldn’t afford the rent Sudden speed draws a line on the road as it makes the pornstar fall back as he blew His load on the eyes and face of the driver And the Pornstar goes: I’m coming, I’m coming I’m coming over your eyes I’m coming, I’m coming I’m coming over! Hey Heeey I’m coming over your eyes What a mess the driver vomits and speeds up to a hundred miles Dark dust behind our van Riding bold gives a shit on climate change Proud pornstar with a reach like a gun celebrates Oh man what a killer prostate I have to admit I’m really impressed. And the pornstar goes... I’m coming, I’m coming I’m coming over your eyes I’m coming, I’m coming I’m coming over! Hey Heeey I’m coming over your eyes\n\n2.\n\nLove Ain't For Free 02:43\n\nLove ain’t for free Motherfucker, grab your life by the balls Love ain’t for free Grab ya lover - and shake it all night long You came such a long long way from a homeless out on the streets. Well that’s not the best position to ask for a price to pay. For a journey from the gutter to the top you took a dirty ride but you did it well. Pure shock, every cock, pulled your rack, as you suck, but you wear it with pride. Love ain’t for free Motherfucker, grab your life by the balls Love ain’t for free Grab ya lover - and shake it all night long You say that’s not the best job you had. What a surprise I thought you were fine? Well, I can see but at least you get paid and the business is safe. \"Safe\" you say \"is relative\" since your clients might not be that clean as you expect. So Stop, dontcha talk, start to shock, Heat it up, Let’s just stay alive Love ain’t for free Motherfucker, grab your life by the balls Love ain’t for free Grab ya lover - and shake it all night long\n\n3.\n\nParadise Calls 03:27\n\nAll those years have passed so pointless Everyone dies alone A little offtrack exploited Like this you can’t go on. Start the fight for a vast free life forever Grab your guns to cash out life. Paradise calls you’re gonna die tonight, too old to run and too young to hide. never backed down, never feared a fight At least you should have tried Everyday’s the same Like zombies Betrayal of our own. Feels like you are dead already It’s time to go all in Start the fight for a vast free life forever Grab your guns to cash out life. Paradise calls you’re gonna die tonight, too old to run and too young to hide. never backed down, never feared a fight At least you should have tried Paradise calls you’re gonna die tonight Paradise calls you’re gonna die tonight Paradise calls Paradise calls Paradise calls\n\n4.\n\nI went to bed too late and got up too soon My poor head still spinnin' from too much booze I got a foot in the gutter, a foot in the grave Ain't seen home in the last three days Oh my god, look what the cat dragged in Livin' my life, sin after sin Night rolls up and I do it again Oh my god, look what the cat dragged in No tell, motel, hotel bed If it wasn't for the sunlight, I'd swear I was dead I got a girl on the left of me, a girl on the right I know damn well I slept with both last night Sin after sin Oh my god, look what the cat dragged in Livin' my life, sin after sin Night rolls up and I do it again Oh my god, look what the cat dragged in\n\n5.\n\nThe Way She Rides 03:10\n\nWhat a great day motherfuckers There’s lotta love in the air They say a friend’s mom is holy and I don’t complain 'bout that But tell me that your dad doesn’t care Your Mom’s such a killer. And your daddy doesn’t know, Your mom’s such a killer and I wanna fill her and Baby we’re ready to go Your Mom is horny all the time I like the way she rides my bike Your Mom is horny all the time I like the way she rides my bike Your Mom is horny all the time I like the way she rides my bike Your daddy’s not home tonight I’m gonna stay the rest of my life We don’t have to claim we’re good looking That’s a sure thing to see I don’t care what they’re sayin’ and, I’m taking all the blame Damn your mom’s good looking on me. Your dad‘s really lucky Does he cherish that ride? Cause your mom’s really horny and near mint condition and Looks like she is low in miles. Your Mom is horny all the time I like the way she rides my bike Your Mom is horny all the time I like the way she rides my bike Your Mom is horny all the time I like the way she rides my bike Your daddy’s not home tonight I’m gonna stay the rest of my life\n\n6.\n\nWe came a long way - from here to Detroit the Michigan Highway felt like a sandpaper ride You took your daddy’s car out sneak it down the driveway and as we turn the key we’re free to leave that boring place Sorry to bother you I don’t wanna spoil the date Sorry to bother you but I just have to say... Excuse us, we‘re heading for the coast Goodbye Losers, we want so much more Excuse us, 9 to 5 is not for me Goodbye Losers, we‘re young and wild and free While the sun eats the desert the horizon’s in flames And I can’t take my eyes of you you’re amazing little girl Stars above us proud silver on blue and an endless stripe of freedom Underneath our shiny wheels Sorry to bother you I don’t wanna spoil the date Sorry to bother you but I just have to say... Excuse us, we‘re heading for the coast Goodbye Losers, we want so much more Excuse us, 9 to 5 is not for me Goodbye Losers, we‘re young and wild and free\n\n7.\n\nSimple Life 03:37\n\nYou know it’s the time the good things fade and nothing will be right Tonite, the best thing you can do is tell a lie. Tonite, just grab my hand and your passport and let’s run. Here we are, leaving all that makes us sore. Gone wrong to testify - the good old times - will might not get it right. Tonite, it’s better if we start over this way Tonite - coming up for the rundown of your life Let’s leave, It’s better there - wherever. Lead a simple Life Living under pressure Yet feelin’ so alive Keepin’ all together Let’s leave the simple life Living under pressure Leave the pressure aside You know their dreams are better but they may not last for me And I know, time will never do the things I do, for you, It’s easier to run and let’s just go, but don’t... Don’t make me regret this! Lead a simple Life Living under pressure Yet feelin’ so alive Keepin’ all together Let’s leave the simple life Living under pressure Leave the pressure aside\n\n8.\n\nPants on Fire 02:30\n\nCome on let’s roll, it’s a wednesday So let the weekend begin We’re leaders with a bottle of truth. Wait for leaving, I’m waiting for a call So I can ruin What you came for Soooo tonight the best thing I do Is total overdrive Nah Nah Nah, Nah Nah Nah, When I come home late night, wasted as fuck and my pants on fire When I call, will you answer? Follow us to glory and fame It’s blood and puke on the streets We're outta control Sound of arenas and the Sirens of Filth Can’t explain but for me that’s the purest kerosene and I'll... …start it tonight Whatever you decide Make your choice wiiiiiise Nah Nah Nah, Nah Nah Nah, When I come home late night, wasted as fuck and my pants on fire\n\n9.\n\nLove Me 03:37\n\nHurgh! Sailed in on the bleedin lips of a thousands of thiefs The cradle of filth made me be that way You know it’s a dirty town and they’re afraid of my roar This will be better with a loved one like you I saw you came around from the other side of town. Come take my hand Please calm me down. Love me, Like you’ve never loved before Show me, What I am living for. Love me, Like you never get enough Show me, I’m a super premium catch Down through the western states on the highway I love The desert wind smells better with you I like the way the V8 shakes your butt I have a great feeling like this is real love. I saw you came around from the other side of town. Come take my hand Please calm me down. Love me, Like you’ve never loved before Show me, What I am living for. Love me, Like you never get enough Show me, I’m a super premium catch\n\n10.\n\nShe's Hot 03:01\n\nShe’s hot and she knows it She’s comin' over I’m tryin' not to blow it She’s hot, man you know it Like a truck I’m fully overloaded Comin over in stockings and a heat arises With a sudden my brain explodes and I collide She’s hot and she knows it She’s comin' over I’m tryin’ not to blow it She’s hot and she knows it She’s comin' over I’m tryin’ not to blow it She’s hot and she knows it You can tell by her look she’s what I wanted Damn hot, a volcano. An eruption that reaches up to venus Heaven called they say they want their angel back I can not let her go she’s just a perfect match. She’s hot and she knows it She’s comin' over I’m tryin’ not to blow it She’s hot and she knows it She’s comin' over I’m tryin’ not to blow it She knows just how to drive you wild. She knows just how to drive you wild. She’s hot and she knows it She’s comin' over I’m tryin’ not to blow it She’s hot and she knows it She’s comin' over I’m tryin’ not to blow it\n\n11.\n\nHigher 03:56\n\nTo the lucky blokes the things you say keep’em following far away to find out it’s all just a lie. While struggling from suppressed to being blessed You make a nicer trip through life, Jump a knife on the way We’re leaving L.A. tonight. On our way out through the crowds Keep your elbows low There’s no need to be afraid Cause we’re here with you tonight We’re pushing you higher Laughing about limits when we roll Pushin’ you higher To where you’ve never gone before Pushin’ you higher Taste a bit of beer, cocaine and lime Pushin’ you higher Supercharged with cuban summertime Looking at the rest of the world And I know they didn’t think of us So we never turn our heads when we burn their houses with the middlefingers crossed Let me take you out for a ride Covered in the ruins we thought we’d play And we’re leaving it all and we fuck all the world and we burn down L.A.! We’re pushing you higher Laughing about limits when we roll Pushin’ you higher To where you’ve never gone before Pushin’ you higher Taste a bit of beer, cocaine and lime Pushin’ you higher Supercharged with cuban summertime\n\n12.\n\nLet's Not Get Drowned 04:26\n\nCome on let’s stay undercover. That playground, is closed today Come on let’s stay undercover for another, perfect day. let’s waste that day. Pick me up for a joyful round Who never gets up will never fall down So let’s stay undercover for another goddamn day Let’s waste the day. Let’s not fall down Life will be gone We might be dead before we fall without a sound Let’s not get drowned let’s not play their roles Who never get’s up will never fall down at all Come on let’s stay undercover Noone else will show up on the scene We can’t go on like the corporate mother fuckers Without a dream Go without me Come on let’s be proud nonbelievers Let’s blow up all things we hate I won’t get up and waste another minute on things I don’t believe. Fuck you honestly Let’s not fall down Life will be gone We might be dead before we fall without a sound Let’s not get drowned let’s not play their roles Who never get’s up will never fall down at all\n\n13.\n\nTabledance Bar 03:28\n\n14.\n\nSeagulls for Tonight 02:49"
