However recently I have looked out of the window and my damn neighbour is throwing bread out for the birds and foxes grrrr...so about 4.30am the foxes start hanging about in neighbours garden and the seagulls start flying about making typical seagull noise...waiting for mr thoughtless to feed them..which he does between 4.40 and 5.00am..is there anything I can do?

I'm fed up with it..\n\nI had this with a neighbour a while back. She used to chuck all sorts of food wast in the garden to feed foxes badgers seagulls pigeons.....and rats. I just told her to stop doing it and informed the council about the rats. Much to my surprise she stopped and moved .\n\nI used to feed a fox. It would come in the garden and look at me through the window, so I'd go out with food. Over time it was sufficiently comfortable with me that I could sit on the back step and it would lie down nearby. Sadly it disappeared, I've had a couple since then that were less tame.\n\nI used to feed a fox. It would come in the garden and look at me through the window, so I'd go out with food.

Sadly it disappeared, I've had a couple since then that were less tame.\n\nWhat a lovely story..perhaps we could swap houses for a time..I hope your an early riser? About 4am ish the noise starts...but not all bad mate, you can listen to my hifi..help yourself to toast and the cheap Belgian stubby bottles of beer by the front door! My better beer is in the fridge..hands off!! Lol\n\nI don't understand..I don't visit pistonheads forum ( I have a life, hifi and er... ukuleles! )\n\nHang on..they dig up the lawn!! Cool.. unfortunately this lazy neighbour has put down AstroTurf ( badly..it's all creased, looks awful plus the leaves seem stuck to the turf like velcro lol )\n\nEven better. At least a natural lawn would repair itself. The fake lawn would be ripped to shreds and look a right mess!\n\nThe idea that foxes lead to rat infestations by knocking rubbish over seems a bit wrongheaded to me. In our neighbourhood the foxes are the local pest control.\n\nI saw the rats in the woman's garden scavenging food, and I was't putting up with that. She was as mad as a hatter and a menace to public health, or so I was informed by her ex-partner who checked her out. The LA Infestations Officer or whatever he's called told me they could, and would, take action regarding rat infestations and waste food being chucked about."
