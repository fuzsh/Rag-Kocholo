Sprite properties refer to the characteristics or qualities of a sprite in computer graphics or video game development. These properties can include attributes such as position, size, rotation, scale, texture, color, transparency, and animation. These properties help define the appearance and behavior of the sprite within the game or application. Additionally, properties like collision detection and physics behavior can also be considered as sprite properties.
