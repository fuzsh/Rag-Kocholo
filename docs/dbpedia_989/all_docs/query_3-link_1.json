        "text": "I think textures are sprites on a 3D object but not sure if that is correct?\n\nNo.\n\nStrictly speaking, a texture is a term for one or more images that are bundled together in an object called a \"texture\", within the context of a GPU-based rendering system. A texture can be used when rendering a 3D object. Or it can be used when rendering a 2D object, because 2D objects are just special cases of 3D objects.\n\nA sprite is the term for an image, or part of an image, that is used to represent an entity (or part of an entity) in a game rendered with sprite/tile-based graphics.\n\nYou can put sprites inside textures. XNA does this internally, as it uses your 3D rendering system to render your stuff.\n\nDo you use textures in 2D games?\n\nXNA does. And generally most people who make games with 2D graphics do. It's the fastest way. But ultimately, this is an implementation detail that you should leave up to XNA.\n\nWhere do you apply the different parts of game art? For example when you use sprites vs animation.\n\nThis question is confused. Animations are composed of sprites. They're not separate things; one is a superset of the other. Typically you have a big image that holds multiple sprites that, when you flip between them, form animations.\n\nWhat are the difference between sprites, textures animation and other art?\n\nAgain, this question is confused.\n\nIs all 2D art in games considered sprites? Characters, background, etc.\n\nHistorically, \"sprite\" was used for things that move, while \"tile\" was used for things that don't move. However, you're using XNA, where \"sprite\" is used for both fixed and mobile things.\n\nThe historical reason was hardware-based. On 2D consoles, the hardware actually governed how sprites and tiles were rendered. It had hardware based tilemaps, scrolling, and sprite maps and animations. In modern graphics renderers, there's no need to make a distinction at the rendering level. Conceptually, you can make that distinction. But XNA makes you define your concepts.\n\nWhat size do you make your sprite sheets and each character in a sprite sheet?\n\nWithin the hardware limitations for your platform of choice, however you see fit. That's up to you.\n\nHowever, if performance is a concern (and in 2D games it often isn't a big one), you will want to pack as many sprites as possible into as few images as possible. You generally want all the terrain for your level in one sheet, and common enemies to share the same sheet. Things like that.\n\nBut you don't have to go crazy with it. The biggest thing is getting your terrain in a sheet. If you have to use different sheets for the at most 40 other characters you might be drawing on the screen, that's not going to be a major performance issue."
