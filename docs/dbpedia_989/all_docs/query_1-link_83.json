        "text": "The gaming and simulation industry is not a “future” industry nor is it a “future” market. It is here now, and it has an impact on all individuals. Computer and video game software sales are steadily growing. The simulation market is growing steadily. The gaming and simulation industries want skilled artists and programmers to meet the employment needs of these rapidly growing industry.\n\nThe Digital Gaming and Simulation program offers career training that leads to employment in the industry as a game and simulation artist and/or programmer. Students use state-of-the-art technologies to help reach their personal and professional goals\n\nThe game artist develops skills in 2D and 3D art, modeling and animation, illustration, graphic design, layout, and interface design in the development of games. The game programmer develops skills in design, programming, performance diagnostics, optimization, and game libraries during the development of games and simulations. The game and simulation artists and programmers work together in teams to develop games and/or simulations as a requirement for completing the program.\n\nAll students interested in entry into this program should be ready to take college English (ENGL 1301, Composition I) and college Math (MATH 1314, College Algebra). Students are required to maintain a “C” or better grade in all GAME courses to get credit for the course for the completion of their degree and/or certificate programs.\n\nIn addition, please note that a student may only earn one Occupational Skills Award (OSA) per academic year.\n\nTSI testing required prior to first enrollment for all AAS degrees and Level II certificates.\n\nHybrid programs allow students to take a mix of online and face-to-face courses. Hybrid programs offer 50% to 85% of their courses online and the remainder of the curriculum is taken in-person on one of HCC’s campuses. Please contact your advisor for more information about specific program requirements.\n\nLanguage Option Restrictions\n\nSome hybrid programs require students to participate in foreign language courses as part of the program’s required curriculum. Please contact your advisor for more information about specific program requirements and available language options. If you would like to take courses in a language that is not offered online, you would have to do so on campus.\n\nElective Course Restrictions\n\nSome hybrid programs may have a limited number of elective options available, based on which of the designated electives are currently offered online. Please contact your advisor for more information about specific program requirements.\n\nRequired Course Restrictions\n\nHybrid programs require students to participate in campus-based courses as part of a given program’s required curriculum. Please contact your advisor for more information about specific program requirements.\n\nPotential Course Restrictions\n\nSome online courses may have face-to-face requirements for exams, laboratory sessions, and other activities. Please review your course syllabus to determine if your online course has an on-campus laboratory or examination requirement."
