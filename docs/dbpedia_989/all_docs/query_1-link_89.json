        "text": "Achievements Unlocked\n\nThe University of Delaware's Bachelor of Arts in Game Studies and eSports prepares majors for excellence in a broad range of careers in the video game industry and related fields. Today's video game developers and publishers aren't just looking for qualified programmers and designers, they need well-balanced experts in cultural awareness, marketing, management, education, communication, law and health. Meanwhile, the surging popularity of eSports, live streaming and indie game development shows how global game culture continues to grow and diversify in the 21st century.\n\nUD's Game Studies and eSports degree provides graduates with a rigorous interdisciplinary background, unlocking the myriad skills that will allow them to conquer the challenges the video game industry faces every day.\n\nThe program features an internship, a Capstone experience and six core courses: Introduction to Art and Design for Games, Introduction to Programming in Games, Introduction to Game Development, Introduction to Writing for Games, Introduction to Game Studies and Introduction to eSport Management. In addition to the core curriculum above, majors complete five of the Focus Area Courses (15 credits), with at least three courses from the same focus area and at least two courses at the 400 level. After required courses are completed, sufficient elective credits must be taken to meet the minimum credit requirement for the degree with credits to total a minimum of 124."
