        "text": "AIMS\n\nDigital games are one of the largest entertainment industries, increasingly pervasive within society, and at the forefront of emerging technologies with respect to user experience and online social interaction. This subject will develop understanding and practical knowledge of the fundamental principles of game design, interactivity and immersion. It will examine how these techniques are increasingly being applied in contexts such as health, learning, web-design and in emerging virtual reality experiences. The subject will explore the deeper conceptual foundations of the theory of games and their use beyond the digital realm. Students will learn the underlying principles of how to design games, what games are and how they engage players. They will apply this knowledge to the analysis of games, the study of play, and the persuasive, transformative and educative potential of gaming experiences.\n\nINDICATIVE CONTENT\n\nFundamentals of game design; interactive techniques of gaming interfaces; social and collaborative techniques of game design; online game communities; trends in the games industry; mobile gaming; methods for studying play; persuasive games; gamification applications."
