Then tailor you statement towards the qualities they’re looking for, whether that’s a focus more on design or technical skills, or a combination of those.\n\nMost game design and animation courses will be looking for people who are creative and innovative. What original projects or hobbies have you undertaken, such as making a short film or animation of your own, or designing your own game or coding? Or maybe you’ve taken a hobby like pottery, painting, or graphic design and put your own spin on it?\n\nTechnical skills, like analytics, data handling, and programming will also be important, so demonstrate you have an understanding of that through courses you’ve taken, or projects you’ve done inside or outside of school.\n\nCan you also critique the work of an animator or game design company you like? Be specific about what you like about the drawing or design elements, what you think does and doesn’t work, and how you’d change it.\n\nDemonstrate you can work with others and independently, as teamwork and self-direction will both likely be involved in any future jobs. Have you had a part-time job, or a sport or hobby, that involved both those skills?\n\nPersonal statement builder\n\nTry our tool.\n\nGet help structuring your statement.\n\nSign up today"
