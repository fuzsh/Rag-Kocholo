        "text": "Begin with a foundation in drawing, visual culture, and 3D concepts. From there, you’ll dive into the principles of programming in a visual environment where you’ll design, implement, and debug the functionality of games and interactive programs. You’ll bring your ideas to life in our computer lab outfitted with gaming PCs and drawing tablets, and in our audio production space for sound design, recording, and mixing. Our virtual production and VFX studio include LED wall technology, motion-capture cameras, a green screen room, and render farm—facilities that are unmatched at any other school in New England.\n\nBut there’s more to games than technology. You’ll also learn the elements of production including game conceptualization, story development, as well as interface, character, soundtrack, and level design. As you find your strengths and interests, you’ll choose a specialization in one of four areas—Game Art, Game Audio, Game Design, or Virtual Production.\n\nEverything you learn and do in the major prepares you for the professional world. You’ll take several Interactive Studio courses where you’ll apply your skills to instructor-guided projects, such as building games, simulations, and artistic installations. Working alongside accomplished faculty in the gaming industry, gain hands-on experience working as part of a game studio production team with various departments, leads, development infrastructure, and real-world demands.\n\nA skilled game designer must also understand topics such as biology, anatomy, and geometry to create convincing characters and virtual environments. At Lesley, our College of Art & Design is situated within a larger university that has 25+ liberal arts majors and 45+ minors. That means you'll be able to study a range of topics that can enhance your practice. And with our reimagined general education curriculum, you’ll acquire knowledge and skills that employers value, which will prepare you to succeed in an increasingly complex, diverse, and global world."
