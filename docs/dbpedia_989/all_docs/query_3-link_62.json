        "text": "The attached is a demo application showing how Sprites can be used (I can only think of game applications).\n\nsprites are objects that move \"by themselves\" according to preset rules.\n\nIn the demo I show two types - a free-flyer and a path_walker.\n\nI created two classes - one for the game zone and the other for the sprites.\n\nI used GifDecoder Library by Agraham, and the idea of how to get the index in a common timer_tick from the spin-wheel thread.\n\nFor those who want different rules for the sprites - you can change it to suit your needs, that's what is so wonderful in classes, unlike libraries.\n\nA problem: after launching several groups of sprites I usually get a memory problem. You can see in the RemoveSprite sub that I remove the imageview but I suspect that some variables still stay in memory. I don't know how to destroy the sprite object completely. Please advise.\n\nEdit: Version 2 has better arrangement:\n\n- azimuh range moved to the sprite type definition\n\n- initialization of the sprite is done by reference to the game's type parameters array\n\n- collision between same type sprites are igmored.\n\nAttachments\n\nscreenshot.jpg\n\nAliens2.zip"
