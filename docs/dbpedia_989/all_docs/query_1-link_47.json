As new innovations, free-to-play, e-sports, and online gaming drive interest, the sector is expected to reach a value of nearly $290 billion by 2026.\n\nVideo game designers may take on different roles, responsibilities, and titles as part of the profession. Read on to discover how to become a video game designer and learn about educational requirements, tips to securing employment, and possible career paths.\n\nWhat Do Video Game Designers Do?\n\nVideo game designers can work on any or all aspects of a video game, including concept creation, animation, puzzle design, and narrative development. These professionals often collaborate with other artists, programmers, and content creators to develop a cohesive product. Lead designers typically manage this collaborative effort, ensuring contributions from their team of designers come together.\n\nGame designers work on strategy, puzzle, simulations, sports, and online games. Depending on the genre they work on, designers may work with game engines, game maker software, and artificial intelligence. While the roles and titles may vary by employer, the following categories outline major video game design careers and how they might differ.\n\nVideo Game Designers\n\nVideo game designers can hold many creative roles on a development team, including content, mechanics, and level design. They envision how the game will look and then pass that on to the artists, developers, and programmers. Lead designers and developers may cover the same ground, depending on the organization.\n\nVideo Game Developers\n\nDevelopers often manage the back-end technical aspects of the games. They handle production elements, coordinating the process of translating the game design into the final product. They may also work on user experience and quality assurance prior to launch.\n\nVideo Game Programmers\n\nVideo game programmers work with both designers and developers to bring the vision of the game to life. They work in multiple programming languages to create the graphics, physics, sound, and user interface. Programmers and artists often collaborate to ensure artwork is accurately incorporated into the game.\n\nVideo Game Artists\n\nVideo game artists create 2D and 3D animations for games using sketching, game modeling, and special effects software. They typically work with designers to ensure their visions align. Some artists can write their own code to add their creations to the game, whereas others work closely with programmers and development staff\n\nWhere Do Video Game Designers Work?\n\nVideo game designers typically work for game publishers and development studios, but they may also work for software developers, design or graphics companies, and marketing organizations. Some game designers are self-employed and take on contract or freelance work.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), software developers, art directors, computer programmers, and special effects artists all typically work regular hours in a collaborative office environment. However, deadlines may lead to busier schedules and longer hours. Many design-related positions allow professionals to work remotely when needed.\n\nVideo Game Designer Skills\n\nVideo game designers need design skills first and foremost. They need to understand modern design tools, techniques, and game engines, along with interface, environment, and graphics software. Video game designers should also possess strong communication, problem-solving, and leadership skills to manage a product’s many developmental stages.\n\nVideo game design also incorporates graphic design, programming, writing, and animation skills, so well-rounded game designers may have a greater impact and effectiveness as employees. Effective designers have a working knowledge of each of these areas, along with a familiarity of the media production and video game publishing process.\n\nProspective designers can pick up many skills on their own or pursue video game design degrees and certificates.\n\nSteps to Become a Video Game Designer\n\nThe video game design field offers an array of entry points. Professionals and new graduates come from different disciplines, specializations, educational backgrounds, and experience levels. The following walkthrough shows the most typical and effective educational pathway into the career.\n\n1. Complete a Video Game Design Certificate or Degree Program\n\nMost video game designers start their training with a degree or certificate program — 57% of designers possess a bachelor’s degree, 19% have an associate degree, and 10% have some college training. Prospective designers may pursue a master’s in entertainment arts or video game development, a bachelor’s in video game design or fine arts in game design, or an associate degree in computer science or programming.\n\nIn addition to full degrees, the video game design field may accept candidates with game design and game programming certificates. Students in these programs typically complete training in digital graphics, sound and environment design, character modeling, and animation techniques. They also acquire skills in storytelling, audience immersion, and project management.\n\nWhile the best video game design schools typically provide students with practical experiences to help them build their portfolios, learners can develop their own design examples to show employers. They can also attend design bootcamps or take online courses to develop their skills and hone their craft. While not a traditional pathway to the career, this independent route may lead to employment opportunities for some.\n\nWhat to Look for in a Video Game Design Program\n\nChoosing a video game design program requires some research and careful consideration, and it can help to know what to look for in a college. Most importantly, prospective schools should have regional accreditation. Without this formal recognition, the institutions may not qualify for federal financial aid and there is no assurance of quality for students and employers.\n\nProspective students should also look at the practical components of a program. Theory can be powerful, but hands-on training and internships give learners the opportunity to apply their knowledge, familiarize themselves with the job, and build real-world experience.\n\n2. Complete Video Game Design Internships\n\nInternships provide an up-close look at the video game design profession and they can lead to professional references and career opportunities down the line. Students can take paid, short-term positions with employers to gain valuable experience and discover which areas of the field they enjoy most.\n\nLearners may find internships in various sectors, including graphic design, development, programming, and animation. These placements can provide numerous short- and long-term benefits, so degree-seekers should take care to find the right internship opportunity for them and their unique goals.\n\n3. Build Your Video Game Design Portfolio\n\nMost employers want to see what a game designer has done before they hire or contract them. A portfolio demonstrates how students have applied their skills to relevant projects in the past. Students can use class assignments, work from previous internships, and hobby design projects.\n\nStudents should approach every pre-employment task with the intention of including it in their portfolio. Test out new tools, use different software, and learn as many skills as possible. Strong portfolios typically include games the candidate has created and launched, the number of sales or downloads the games has accumulated, and examples of teamwork and leadership.\n\n4. Get Hired as a Video Game Designer\n\nWhen it comes to landing that job as a video game designer, candidates have a few ways to increase their odds of success. First, they should make sure their portfolio is complete, diverse, and features intuitive navigation from section to section. Next, they should create a resume that highlights all relevant experience and education and catches the employer’s eye.\n\nAfter that, prospective video game designers should write a cover letter and prepare for the interview. As part of this process, they should research salaries so that they know the industry averages and can negotiate a starting salary. While the interview process can be nerve-wracking, applicants should try to relax, be themselves, and let their passion for the industry speak for itself.\n\n5. Keep Learning New Skills\n\nProfessionals can pick up new skills and information at conference workshops, discussion groups and forums, and mentorship programs from professional associations. They can also enroll in Coursera courses and edX online courses or enter a game development bootcamp.\n\nVideo Game Designer Salary Information\n\nVideo game designer salaries can vary considerably depending on their role and employer.
