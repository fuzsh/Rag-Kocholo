        "text": "Hey there! I bought your Pack 2 weeks ago and finally managed to put them to use! Its my first project with unity and im having loads of fun, especially with this nice pack! I made some little tweaks to the main character because i needed him to play a flute, nothing fancy really, but looks cute. i could pass you the png in case u are interested. Great job and thanks alot! :)\n\nHey,\n\nI'm working with your amazing assets on Unity. I'm pretty new in game dev but I made a tile rule for roads and figured out that sprites were missing for some cases.\n\nSo I created it with your asset and I would like to contact you to get your opinion as well as offer you to simply add these to your assets (precising that this is moslty for tile rules for Unity).\n\nSorry for my english and I hope I didn't do that for nothing cause I don't know unity good enough XD\n\nKeep doing such a great work!\n\n(This allow to combine all type of roads as in example with ONLY painting mode, NOT tile by tile by hand)\n\nE.G:"
