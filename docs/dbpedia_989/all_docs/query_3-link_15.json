Then the artist can just make handguns that conform to a certain size etc.\n\nI realise tools like Spine exist but I’m hoping to use a Unity led solution.\n\nThanks\n\nNick\n\nYou will in some way have to author a skeleton of gameobjects (Anima2D, Spine, etc) and animate them along with your character. Then you can add new child gameobjects to the points.\n\nFor instance, you would animate an object that follows the hand properly (or the sprite follows the bone if you’re using a skeletal animation package), and then make a handgun sprite the child of it. Then you can swap out that sprite or that child object to change guns."
