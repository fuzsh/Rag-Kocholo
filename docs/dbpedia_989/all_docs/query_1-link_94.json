Developers rely heavily on coding skills to program the creative aspects of video games that video game designers conceptualize. Designers may also work with a team of writers, animators, and testers to build a successful game.\n\nVideo game designers typically work in offices with designers, developers, and animators. Big gaming companies in the industry include Blizzard, Nintendo, and Microsoft.\n\nVideo game designers can work on various types of projects, including:\n\nConsole games\n\nComputer games\n\nMobile games\n\nOnline games\n\nTypically, this career path attracts creative, innovative, and enthusiastic individuals.

It’s also essential to learn basic computer skills, like Microsoft Excel.\n\nYou should also maintain a high GPA and score well on the ACT or SAT to earn admission into a top college. Plus, if you’re already a gamer, you can check out some of these eSports scholarships to make money for college by doing something you love!\n\nBe involved in extracurricular activities\n\nParticipating in extracurricular activities, clubs, camps, or internships related to design or computer programming are great way to prepare for a job as a video game designer.\n\nIf you’re looking to earn some industry experience before college, explore this list of computer science internships you can complete in high school. You’ll conduct hands-on research, connect with industry experts, and complete projects to give your college applications an extra boost.\n\nCollege\n\nEarn a Bachelor’s Degree\n\nAlthough it’s not mandatory to have a college degree to obtain an entry-level job as a video game designer, it’s almost imperative to have a bachelor’s degree to continue to increase your salary and expand your job role.\n\nIf you’re interested in studying game design specifically, there are a handful of schools that offer a Bachelor’s Degree in Game Design. Some of these colleges include the University of Southern California, Boise State University, and the University of Texas at Dallas.\n\nThe coursework for a game design degree usually includes software engineering, 2D animation, 3D animation, computer design, and programming languages.\n\nHowever, if your dream school isn’t on this list of colleges offering a game design major, don’t despair. You can earn your Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science, Animation, Computer Engineering, Graphic Design, or other related fields and still have a successful career as a video game designer.\n\nSince video game designers have a wide range of degrees to choose from, you can focus on selecting a college that’s the best for you in other areas, including finances.

Internships also lead to professional connections, which will be advantageous to you when you’re looking for a job after college.\n\nSearch for internships in animation and software development or even video game design with a gaming company you can complete during your college career.\n\nAfter College\n\nGain experience\n\nVideo game design is a highly competitive industry since there are a limited number of gaming companies that can hire a limited number of game designers. You may be lucky to score an entry-level job as a video game designer out of college, but you’ll likely need to gain some relevant experience in related industries first.\n\nWorking as a graphic designer, animator, or software developer can help you build a resume and a portfolio to attract potential employers.\n\nWhile you’re working in related fields, you can look for volunteer opportunities that allow you to expand your design and programming skills. You can also use the resources on the internet to put your skills to work and build a small-scale game on your own.\n\nBuild a resume and portfolio\n\nAs previously mentioned, building a solid resume and portfolio is essential to landing a job as a video game designer.\n\nYour resume should include your relevant work experience and also your hard and soft skills. Your hard skills include the platforms, software, and coding languages you are familiar with, and your soft skills include things like teamwork, documentation, and communication.\n\nYour portfolio should incorporate any relevant projects you’ve worked on, and if possible, any games you’ve designed. You can include videos of gameplay, gaming reviews, and back-end programming.\n\nGet an entry-level job\n\nHopefully, your awesome resume and portfolio will earn the attention of a video game company, and you can begin working as an entry-level video game designer.\n\nOver time, you will have several options to specialize and grow in your career as a video game designer. Some of these roles include:\n\nLead UX Designer\n\nSenior UX Designer\n\nSenior Product Designer\n\nUser Experience Director\n\nSenior Video Game Designer\n\nLevel Designer\n\nFurther Education\n\nBoot camp\n\nIt’s less common for video game designers to return to school to further their education. Instead, video game designers can complete game design boot camps to expand their skillset. Boot camps are short programs that can last anywhere from eight weeks to several months that teach you new programming languages, different types of game design, and other skills that can help you grow as a video game designer.\n\nHowever, a master’s degree in game design can help supplement work experience or boost your likelihood of growth in a high-profile company.\n\nLearn new skills\n\nOne of the most critical talents a video designer can develop is the willingness to teach themselves new skills. Even though self-guidance can’t replace a formal college education, there are dozens of online classes, videos, and other tools that video game designers can use to continue to keep their skills fresh.\n\nAdditionally, many organizations host workshops and seminars where you can learn more about design and development. It’s also beneficial for video game designers to stay current on industry news and trends, especially those interested in leadership, management, and other high-profile positions."
