Our Game Design program is purposefully interdisciplinary, providing a wide breadth of experiences in many different disciplines. In order to receive the fullest education in this field, it is recommended that you choose courses outside of the discipline. For instance, taking Art, Business, and Creative Writing will help you and your career more than only taking Game Design courses. Be adventurous and learn some things that you donâ€™t already know, or increase your knowledge in the skills you already possess!"
