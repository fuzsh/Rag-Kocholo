        "text": "Sprites and Textures are both images.\n\nA Sprite is an image that can be used as a 2d object, which have coordinates (x, y) and which you can move, destroy or create during the game.\n\nA Texture is also an image, but that will be used to change the appearence of an object. E.g. you can set a texture for the faces of a cube, a layer (like the background) or even a sprite. But as texture are not objects, you can't move them during the game.\n\nSprite is the image that is moving related to static images (for example background). Sprites are usually planes (rectangles) with texture on it. Sprites are used in 3D graphics for tricks such as Billboard or Impostor. In 2D games sprites are used instead of moving objects and also as backgrounds.\n\nTexture is an raster image that is to be projected on polygonal object. It worth using textures each time when using polygons is expensive for given objects details (for example bullet dots)"
