        "text": "CSS image sprites are a single image that combines multiple images, used to reduce page loading time and bandwidth consumption.\n\nWhy Use Image Sprites?\n\nImage sprites are used for two main reasons:\n\nFaster Page Loading: By using a single image, page loading time is significantly reduced.\n\nReduced Bandwidth: Less data is consumed, resulting in faster loading and improved user experience.\n\nImage sprites are generally used for designing a graphic social media bar or a navigation bar to make it more attractive and efficient at the same time. It is just a method in HTML and CSS to implement a more efficient way of putting images and designing web pages.\n\nUsed Image:\n\nHow Image Sprites Work\n\nImage sprites are implemented using HTML and CSS, where a single image is defined and then styled using CSS to display the desired image segment.\n\nExample: This example shows the use of image sprites in CSS.\n\nhtml\n\n<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <style> #navlist{ position:relative; } #navlistli{ margin:0; padding:0; list-style:none; position:absolute; top:0; } #navlistli, #navlista{ height:100px; display:block; } .gfg{ width:100px; left:0px; background:url('https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/icon.png')-0px-0px; } .gfg1{ width:100px; left:120px; background:url('https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/icon.png')-0px-140px; } .gfg2{ width:100px; left:240px; background:url('https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/icon.png')-300px-140px; } </style> </head> <body> <ul id=\"navlist\"> <li class=\"gfg\"><a href=\"#\"></a></li> <li class=\"gfg1\"><a href=\"#\"></a></li> <li class=\"gfg2\"><a href=\"#\"></a></li> </ul> </body> </html>\n\nOutput:\n\nUse Cases for Image Sprites\n\nImage sprites are commonly used for:\n\nGraphic Social Media Bars\n\nNavigation Bars\n\nIcon Sets\n\nCSS Image Sprites â€“ FAQs\n\nWhat are CSS image sprites?\n\nCSS image sprites combine multiple images into a single image file. This technique is used in web development to manage multiple UI graphic elements efficiently, reducing the number of server requests and speeding up page loads.\n\nHow do CSS image sprites work?\n\nIn CSS image sprites, various images are arranged into one larger image at different positions. CSS is then used to display only the relevant part of the aggregate image for different elements on the webpage by adjusting the background-position property.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using CSS image sprites?\n\nThe main benefits include reduced number of HTTP requests during page load, decreased overall file size of images, and faster site performance. Sprites also help in maintaining a cleaner HTML structure as multiple images are managed through a single file.\n\nHow do you create a CSS image sprite?\n\nTo create a CSS image sprite, you start by combining images into one single file using a graphic editor. Then, you reference the sprite image as a background image in CSS and use the background-position property to display only the needed section of the image for different elements.\n\nCan CSS image sprites have hover effects?\n\nYes, CSS image sprites can be used for hover effects. By changing the background-position on hover, a different part of the sprite image is shown, which can simulate the effect of changing images on mouseover."
