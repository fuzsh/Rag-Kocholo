Students also gain valuable skills in communicating and collaborating in team-based projects while building a strong portfolio of games. We partner with game studios to provide an authentic, real-world experience in our coursework. Learning is project-based, resulting in a portfolio of small and large projects that reflects a broad variety of work.\n\nOur students consistently produce high quality content and work for some of the largest and most respected game companies in the world (EA, Activision, Ubisoft, Rockstar, Blizzard, Bungie, Insomniac, and more). Our students and faculty created Plunder Panic, a team-based multiplayer game that received multiple awards, including the coveted People’s Choice Award at IndieCade 2018.\n\nVisit games.msu.edu to see examples of student games!\n\nOur program is also the home of the Games for Entertainment & Learning (GEL) Lab. The GEL's mission is to design innovative prototypes, techniques, and complete games for entertainment and learning and to advance state of the art knowledge about social and individual effects of digital games.\n\nView the MSU Games & Interactive Media BA Program Listing.\n\nTechnical Skills\n\nDesign\n\nGame Design\n\nVirtual / Augmented / Mixed Reality Design\n\nArt/Visuals\n\n3D Animation\n\n3D Modeling\n\n2D Illustration\n\nTechnical Art\n\nConcept Design\n\nEnvironment Design\n\nSound Design\n\nGame Interface Design\n\nStorytelling\n\nProgramming\n\nFoundations of Programming\n\nGame Programming\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nData Mining\n\nComputer Graphics (shaders, rendering, etc.)\n\nProject Management\n\nTime & Task Management\n\nTeam Building\n\nReporting\n\nBudgeting\n\nSoft Skills\n\nProduction\n\nTeamwork\n\nCommunication\n\nPresenting\n\nLeadership\n\nNegotiation\n\nSelf-directed learning\n\nClient relations\n\nCareers\n\nGame Designer (Lead Designer, Level Designer, Scripter): Includes level design, scripting, and leadership roles in game development teams.

Many games make use of 2 dimensional graphics for menus, UI, and in game assets.\n\nTechnical Artist: Technical artists are the bridge between the programming team and the art team. Knowledgeable in both programming and the art pipeline they create tools for artists and fix technical problems with assets.\n\nProducer (Assistant Producer, Associate Producer, Lead Producer): Producers, while generally outside of the technical aspects of game development are instrumental in creating a final product. Producers are focused on organization, deadlines, and team dynamics in an effort to make the development of an interactive media project as smooth as possible.\n\nProject Manager: Overseeing all aspects of a production, project managers are responsible for the vision of the game as well as the accurate execution of that vision.\n\nQuality Assurance: QA represents the testing of games to find bugs and errors in the programming. In QA testers will play games exhaustively while logging any bugs or errors they find along the way keeping the development team abreast of areas that need further refinement.\n\nSound Designer: The auditory experience of a game is one of its most important aspects. Sound designers range from composers who create interactive scores, to sound effects designers who craft atmospheric soundscapes for their games.\n\nGame Scenario Writer: Game writers differ from other writers in the sense that they are often tasked with writing branching dialogue that could take a number of different directions based on the user’s choices.
