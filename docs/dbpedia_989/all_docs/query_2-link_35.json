While Scrtach has been designed with a typical 3rd or 4th grader in mind, people of all ages can use it to learn the basics of programming in an enjoyable way! Scratch involves drag and drop of various blocks together to write programs & such an environment enables the users to focus on the logic & enjoy the learning experience! Unlike most Java/C++ development environments, there is NO free-form typing, so there are syntax errors either! Scratch is not limted to young people though - people of all ages with no programming experience can enjoy its simplicity and learn the basics of programming!\n\nGetting Started!\n\nWe use web based application development interface for Scratch Programming:\n\nHome: http://scratch.mit.edu/\n\nCreate New: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tip_bar=getStarted\n\n·Each object in Scratch is called a sprite. Default sprite is a cat.\n\n·The background for the sprite is called Stage OR backdrop.\n\n·Scripts can be dragged and placed/appended on to the grey workspace (towards right). Each group of scripts is run upon double-clicking the first block of script OR by triggering the event.\n\n·New sprites and backdrops can be added. Each sprite and backdrop is associated with respective sequence of scripts.\n\nFollowing image is for old version of Scratch. However, most components are still there in the latest version.\n\nUseful Shortcuts\n\nScript Pen>>Clear [Clears pen moves on screen]\n\nScript Motion>>go to x: 0 y: 0 [Sets the sprite at center of stage]\n\nToolbar File>>Revert [Resets sprite to start]\n\nReference sheet: tinyurl.com/scratchblocks\n\nExamples\n\n1.Simple animations using 1 object.\n\n2.Drawing various images\n\n5A\n\nWe cannot play a game without user interaction, right? Events is all about user interactions. Let us start with Start and Stop signs. Write 2 blocks of code  they will run in parallel when Start flag is pressed!\n\n5B\n\nYou can write code that get triggered by keyboard inputs. Add the following simple blocks of code (in addition to code in 5A)  now press b and s repeatedly. Now, click on Start flag, then press b and s to see the effct.\n\n5C\n\nHow about leaving a stamp along the way? Every time when you press c, it will leave a stamp!\n\n5D\n\nDo this at home (not sure lab will be quite enough to do this one)! Add this code and talk at the computer to make the Cat bigger!\n\n5E\n\nDo this at home too! Start fresh and do this code alone. As the Cat gets smaller, say something! It will get bigger!! Do your own extensions!!!\n\n6A\n\nHow about changing color in addition to bouncing when an edge is reached? Feel free to make your own modifications.\n\n6B\n\nTry to do the same with a ball (assign random color when it bounces). Also, make it bounce in all 4 edges.\n\n6C\n\nAs the cat is walking back and forth, it is tired and goes down a bit in size! Let us introduce a mouse along the way. As the cat crosses the mouse, cat eats it and grows in size!\n\nAdd Mouse sprite and complete this code. You can move the mouse around to control cats size. You can also play with the values in the program.\n\n6D\n\nHere is the same program with a small twist. Enhance the program so that cat does not become huge! Once it reaches the certain size, it can say I am not hungry anymore. Let us play! when it gets to close to the mouse! Use your creativity to enhance it more!!\n\n6E\n\nscratch.mit.edu/projects/15147375 shows another silly version. Review & understand the code for both sprites first. Note that it uses distance to function. Now, make the code changes to freeze the mouse when cat comes close to it. Another version would be to disguise as a bug. Create your own variations!\n\n7A\n\nGreeting Card: scratch.mit.edu/projects/11806234\n\nPlay it first. Then, click on to see the code behind this project.\n\nReview the code for this project first, then enhance it to make your favorite object to glide in when the greeting card is opened. You can control the glide speed by specifying the duration:\n\n7B\n\nPong Starter: scratch.mit.edu/projects/10128515\n\nReview the code first, then make the following enhancements:\n\n-Introduce a variable score to keep track of # of successful bounces.\n\n-Increase the speed of the ball after each bounce, or introduce levels and increase the speed when the score reaches 10, 20, 30, etc. (change backdrop too?)\n\n-Right-click on Ball sprite and duplicate it! Then, go to code for Ball2 and set the starting location x = 120 (instead of 20) and change the color to your favorite one! Now, play the game with 2 balls!\n\n7C\n\nhttp://scratch.mit.edu/projects/15768956/\n\nPlay this Shark-Fish game and review the code to understand. Then, think of your own enhancements and have fun with it!\n\nTic Tac Toe: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1425/\n\nVideo Tutorials: http://scratch.mit.edu/help/videos/# (Wizard Game)\n\nEscape the Box: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/3047921/#editor\n\nBurger Cat Test: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2286584/#editor\n\nhttp://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11937841\n\nhttp://scratch.mit.edu/projects/22119922\n\nhttp://scratch.mit.edu/projects/22120049"
