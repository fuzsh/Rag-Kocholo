Learn More.\n\nSo, you’re thinking about becoming a video game designer.\n\nMaybe your sister’s boyfriend mentioned something about it recently.\n\nOr maybe you’ve wanted to be involved in the creative process for video games ever since you first started playing them.\n\nRegardless of how you arrived here, this article will give you a good look at different types of video game designer education programs to launch your career.\n\nThe Requirements for Game Design\n\nIt’s worth going into a little detail about what it is game designers actually do.\n\nIf you want to learn even more about it, Udemy offers a course that serves as a quick introduction to what game design really is. We’ll outline it quickly below.\n\nA game designer is responsible for the majority of a game’s cohesion.\n\nAs a game designer, you are responsible for figuring out the game’s makeup.\n\nWhat elements exist in the game?\n\nWhy are the elements there?\n\nWhat is the game play like?\n\nWhat are the rules?\n\nYou will typically work with a team of designers, and this team is tasked with coming up with and defining essentially all of the pieces of the game.\n\nBy “pieces” we mean things like:\n\nCharacters\n\nStory elements\n\nSetting\n\nGame structure\n\nGame rules\n\nStuff in the game like vehicles and other objects\n\nThe designers are pretty much responsible for coming up with everything.\n\nGame Designer Qualifications\n\nOther times, the game’s main elements are already created, and it’s up to the designers to figure out the best way to build the game using those ingredients, within certain parameters. The parameters are typically things related to budget and timeframe.\n\nOnce the game’s vision is fleshed out, it’s up to the designers to communicate the vision to the programmers, the artists, and the rest of the production team.\n\nThe game goes through a few different development stages. It’s up to the designers to make adjustments when they’re needed.\n\nMaybe the technology isn’t capable of handling an ambitious project, or maybe the budget or time window isn’t large enough for the time needed. Either way, the design team works with the programmers, artists, and the rest of the crew to make the necessary tweaks.\n\nAs you can see, this is a position that requires a lot of collaboration, a good bit of creativity, and problem-solving skills. We’ll cover those and other skills needed to be a videogame designer – read on!\n\nWhere to Start Your Game Design Education\n\nThe team over at CreativeSkillSet.org has put together a great list of education requirements for game designers. Here are some of the skills they mention:\n\nHere are some of the skills they mention:\n\nCommunication skills\n\nCritical skills (accepting and giving constructive feedback)\n\nPresentation skills\n\nStorytelling skills\n\nBasic visual design skills\n\nBasic drawing skills\n\nBasic scripting or programming skills\n\nUser interface designing skills\n\nStrategic thinking skills\n\nBasic Video Game Designer Requirements\n\nModerate fluency in 2D and 3D animation and graphics packages\n\nAwareness of game platforms and the technology out there\n\nUnderstanding of gameplay theory\n\nRelevant health and safety procedures, and legislation\n\nThe role some of these skills have on the job is obvious. You’ll need to be able to communicate and present your ideas to the rest of the development team in order to get approval for the game to move forward.\n\nYou will probably have to do this more than once throughout a design process.\n\nBigger games can take years to develop.\n\nWith a mix of basic skills needed to be a videogame designer, like user interface design, programming, and drawing, the game designer has a grounded, realistic sense of what a team can produce within the time window and budget constraints.\n\nCommon Game Design Education Questions\n\nDo You Need a College Degree to Be a Game Designer?\n\nIt is possible to enter the video game developing world without taking any specific game designer education programs.\n\nThis option is becoming less prevalent, as more and more colleges are offering video game designer education.\n\nNow, a great way to show a company you have the tenacity to stick with a project long-term, and to show a company you’re serious about this career, is to undergo specialized game designer schooling.\n\nDegrees in fields like computer science and computer programming aren’t bad options if you’re looking to become a game designer.\n\nHowever, since an abundance of colleges now offer actual video game designer education and game development degrees, we will focus on those for now.\n\nHow long does it take to get a fame design education?\n\nGetting into game design is unique because there’s no standard “game designers’ education pathway” to get you there. Most of your decisions will come down to personal preferences and unique criteria.\n\nOne of the varying factors is the length and type of video game designer education you pursue.\n\nDifferent Game Design Education Paths\n\nTwo Years – Associate’s\n\nThe Associate degree approach is not a bad start on your game-designing path.\n\nTwo-year programs fulfill most education requirements for video game designers. They ensure you receive decent exposure to the fundamentals that will be driving your career.\n\nYou’ll experience industry software, and you’ll be introduced to creative concepts surrounding successful game creation. Coding, scripting, design theory, and illustration are other things you can expect to dabble in during your two-year stint in an associate program.\n\nThe only prerequisite for entering into an associate program is a high school diploma or a GED. It’s worth noting that a game designer position is a coveted position. In most cases, you will not be able to walk out of college with your degree and land a job as a game designer.\n\nIt’s significantly more likely that you’ll grab a position somewhere in the game-developing field. From here, you’ll be able to accrue some invaluable industry work experience to qualify for more advanced game design degree requirements. It’s these years of getting your feet wet in the industry that will really help you on your path to get higher video game designer education and land a true game designing job.\n\nStill, even with the emphasis on industry experience, you can get a job that acts as a logical stepping stone towards your dream position with these types of game designer qualifications. For video game designers, a two-year degree will be better than nothing, especially with the competitive trends showing up in the job market.\n\nA two-year degree will be better than nothing, especially with the competitive trends showing up in the job market.\n\nFour Years – Bachelor’s\n\nPursuing a Bachelor of Game Design means two more years of exposure to programming languages courses (as compared to an associate’s degree).\n\nIt will also give you more time to explore traditional art courses and gain experience to meet more specialized video game designer requirements.\n\nTwo more years also means twice as much time to develop your portfolio. Completed games or detailed proposals are extremely helpful in showing potential employers what you can do. As we mentioned, video game designer requirements are getting increasingly more difficult with even more competition.\n\nVideo games are a multi-billion dollar industry. People want in. Any chance you have to make yourself stand out, you should take.\n\nLike the associate’s degree, you will need to have your high school diploma, and most schools will be looking for SAT and ACT scores as well. If you’re looking for a traditional, campus-based college or university, here is a list of some top options. There are plenty of varied locations in there.\n\nWith schools from California to Rochester and Utah to Pennsylvania, You’ll likely be able to find a video game designer education program that works for you.\n\nWhat if you want to forego campus life?\n\nWhat if you’re employed full-time in a different field?\n\nWhat if you have a family or other obligations?\n\nTime to welcome the beautiful world of online courses.\n\nThere is a wealth of benefits in going to a video game design school. There was a time when online schools weren’t taken seriously, but that stigma is rapidly fading.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, you just can’t beat the convenience.\n\nThere’s also a price factor.\n\nTraditional expenses, like lodging and meal plans, aren’t weighing on your wallet when you don’t need to leave your home to attend college. It’s like you’re already getting experience with time and budget constraints. Throw that on your resume (Just kidding)!\n\nIf you don’t mind foregoing the campus experience, or you’ve already experienced it once and you’re looking to go back to school, online schooling is a great option.\n\nThe Recap\n\nFor the sake of having a very quick, very crude rundown of the video game designer requirements we just discussed, let’s go back over a few things:\n\nAn associate program will get you out into the industry the fastest.\n\nA bachelor’s program will give you more time to develop your skills and build your portfolio, and open you up to pursue your master’s degree.\n\nAn online degree for either associate or bachelor of game design means increased flexibility and potential savings.\n\nThe Game Design Master’s Program\n\nAs is typically the case for master’s programs, to enroll you’ll have to meet certain video game designer education requirements, preferably a bachelor’s degree in game designing.\n\nA primary difference in the master’s program (as compared to a bachelor’s program) is the inclusion of business and management course material. Study.com put together a list of courses one could expect to take in a game design masters program:\n\nGame marketing\n\nVideo game design mechanics\n\nProduction techniques\n\nProduction management principles\n\nHuman resource management\n\nObtaining your master’s degree, especially if you have good experience in the field, gives you a better chance to pass advanced video game designer requirements to work professionally right out of the program.\n\nA Master’s education for a game designer can make you a valuable pick-up for a video game production company.\n\nTraining and Skill Development Courses Outside of College\n\nWhat About Training and Skill Development Courses Outside of College?\n\nWhether you’re looking for training to supplement your degree or supplant your degree pursuit entirely, there is a wealth of online course offering education for game designers to help you along. Lynda.com, for example, has over 30 game design courses with over 1,200 video tutorials.\n\nThey offer many game designer education programs in everything from prop creation to level design. Lynda.com offers a free trial, so you can give it a test run and see what you find on there.\n\nThen there’s Udemy. Instead of being subscription-based, you pay per class. Most of seeming fairly inexpensive for the several hours of game designer education content they offer. Udemy lets you know the difficulty level for different courses, too. It varies from beginner to expert.\n\nThen there are sites like The Game Institute, which is dedicated solely to the world of games. This boasts a reasonably priced flat fee for 6 months or a year depending on how much you want to bite off at once. There’s also a 30-day no-risk money-back guarantee.\n\nThe benefit of using a service dedicated to the gaming industry, like the Game Institute, is that you’ll have access to forums full of other like-minded individuals. Puzzling out your problems with other aspiring game developers will serve you well as you’ll continue to collaborate in a professional setting.\n\nStart Your Game Design Education Today\n\nWith over 59% of Americans playing video games, there has never been a better time to get into the industry. There are ways for you to get started no matter where you are in your game designing education pathway.\n\nTraining and skill courses for video game development can be taken before you receive any formal game designer qualifications. A great way to introduce yourself to professional video game designer requirements is to mess around with design software yourself. Forums, too, give you access to a real treasure trove of free information.\n\nIf you still aren’t sure if game designing is right for you, you should try and connect with a game designer currently working in the industry.\n\nLook at the development teams for three or four of your favorite games and see if you can get contact information for any of the designers that worked on the game. If you live nearby, you could take them out for coffee and pick their brains about what they actually do. If they are far away, ask them for a quick five-minute phone call or skype session.\n\nChances are you’ll find someone willing to answer your questions, and they’ll be able to tell you exactly what you want to know about video game designer education.\n\n“What’s the work culture like? How much time do you spend doing X or Y? Would I be better off pursuing an X degree or taking Y courses?”\n\nPeople like to help other people, it’s a human thing, so start tracking some people down and making some moves.\n\nHopefully, you’re inspired and excited to take the next steps.\n\nGo get ‘em!"
