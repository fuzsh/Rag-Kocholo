        "text": "A sprite is an object or character in Scratch that can be programmed to perform actions based on scripts in a project using blocks. Each sprite has its own scripts, costumes, and sounds, and can move on its own. In the interface, sprites appear in the Sprites Pane below the stage.\n\nCreating a Sprite\n\nThe bar above the sprite list has four buttons for creating sprites. They are:\n\nThe search button allows one to choose a sprite from the library.\n\nThe paintbrush button creates a blank sprite with an empty costume.\n\nThe surprise button creates a random sprite.\n\nThe upload button allows one to upload a sprite from the computer.\n\nBefore May 13, 2021, the camera button allowed taking pictures with a device, but the feature was removed to discourage face reveals.[1]\n\nWhen a sprite is created, it will be placed at a random location on the Stage, usually around the center, and open the sprite in the tab one is currently viewing.\n\nScripting\n\nEach sprite in a Scratch project has an area for scripts, called the scripts area. Users may program sprites with blocks. Each sprite has scripts that function and run independently, and they can communicate with each other through broadcasts, variables, or sensing blocks.\n\nThe look of a sprite can be changed by using costumes. Each sprite has at least one costume, and costumes may be changed using Looks blocks. Costumes may be added from the Costumes Library or drawn, and they may be edited with the Paint Editor.\n\nSprites may also have sounds. Sounds can be recorded, added from the Sound Library, or uploaded, and may be edited with the Sound Editor.\n\nSprites (with all of their scripts, costumes, and sounds) can be exported, and then imported into another project if desired. This is achieved by right-clicking on a sprite's thumbnail in the sprite pane and then selecting \"save to local file\" in the pop-up menu. A sprite can also be dragged into the backpack and dragged out into another project for transporting. However, this will not save the sprite to one's computer.\n\nSprite Packs\n\nMain article: Sprite Pack\n\nA sprite pack, also known as a sprite collection, is a type of project that contains sprites for usage of other users. A sprite pack usually has a theme, but does not require one. Example themes include cars, dogs, dinosaurs, etc. A sprite pack can also contain sprites from existing video games.\n\nChanging the Default Sprite\n\nMain article: How to Change the Default Sprite\n\nBy default, creating a new project will provide a sprite with an image of the Scratch Cat without any scripts. This can only be changed in Scratch 1.4 by creating your own sprite, exporting it under the name default.sprite, and placing it in the costumes folder.\n\nSee Also\n\nSprite Pane\n\nHow to Move Sprites with the Arrow Keys\n\nList of Sprite Library Sprites"
