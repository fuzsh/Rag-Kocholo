        "text": "A career in video game design may appeal to creative, artistic, and tech-savvy people who like telling stories. As the popularity of video games grows, the demand for skilled video game designers will likely increase.\n\nThe video game industry generated $151.06 billion in 2019. Market research firm Grand View Research projects yearly revenue to grow to $291.16 billion by 2027.\n\nThis page explains how to become a video game designer, including education, experience, and certification requirements.\n\nWhat Is a Video Game Designer?\n\nPeople in many different roles collaborate to create video games, but the game designer is one of the most important.\n\nA video game designer comes up with a game's storyline, characters, rules, and overall concept. Daily responsibilities may include writing game documentation, brainstorming storyline ideas, and taking part in team meetings for new games under development.\n\nDesigners work with game developers, programmers, writers, and artists. Because they work with so many other people, video game designers need excellent communication and teamwork skills. Video game designers usually work for small or large video game publishers and studios. Major video game companies include Sony, Tencent Games, Nintendo, and Microsoft.\n\nWhat Education Do Video Game Designers Need?\n\nThe industry does not set specific education requirements for video game designers. Still, many employers prefer applicants with a college degree. A bachelor's degree in computer science, video game design, or video game development can help students develop the skills and knowledge to succeed in video game design.\n\nNot all video game designers go to college. Some professionals complete game design bootcamps or certificate programs. Others get relevant on-the-job training and experience in other tech positions.\n\nWith industry technology constantly evolving, video game designers need to keep up with new developments and trends. Game designers can stay current with the field by joining professional organizations, subscribing to industry publications, and taking ongoing workshops and trainings.\n\nHow Much Experience Do Video Game Designers Need?\n\nExperience requirements for a video game designer vary by employer. Some companies may hire designers without previous experience. However, job applicants with some hands-on game design background can stand out from candidates without any experience.\n\nStudents can get experience while still in school by completing an internship or capstone course. Degree programs and bootcamps often include these types of real-world opportunities.\n\nIn some cases, education can substitute for experience and vice versa. Video game companies are usually most concerned that potential employees hold the skills required to do the job. This is why a strong portfolio of work can be so important.\n\nTop Online Programs\n\nExplore programs of your interests with the high-quality standards and flexibility you need to take your career to the next level.\n\nCertifications\n\nProfessional certifications are optional in video game design. However, certifications alongside a portfolio can help prove your skills and knowledge to potential employers. College certificate programs differ from professional certifications.\n\nCertifications for video game designers and developers usually focus on specific technologies and game engines, like Unity. We describe three popular Unity certifications below.\n\nUnity Certified Associate Game Developer: This certification for game developers demonstrates competency in Unity concepts and skills. The certification exam covers topics like animation, audio, programming, and game art principles. Prerequisites include experience with C# in Unity.\n\nUnity Certified Associate Artist: To qualify for this certification, video game artists need 2-3 semesters of postsecondary Unity coursework. Candidates can also qualify through self-study. Applicants must know how to install and configure Unity software. The exam covers asset management; scene content design; and lighting, cameras, materials, and effects.\n\nUnity Certified Associate Programmer: This certification for video game programmers demonstrates programming, asset management, and debugging skills. Prerequisites include 2-3 semesters of post-secondary Unity coursework or self-study. Candidates should be able to deploy a basic build and interpret existing code.\n\nComputerScience.org is an advertising-supported site.
