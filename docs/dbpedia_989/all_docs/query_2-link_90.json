        "text": "Image manipulation is what you are looking for. To modify the current image you have and generate other facial expressions from it, you need to be very good at math. Image manipulation is not a basic stuff and I hope you are not new to programming.\n\nNow that you understand that, you need OpenCV to be able to do this. You need to make a wrapper for it in c#. You can get the already made wrapper [here].1 https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/21088 .It works on Windows,Mac, Android and iOS and will save you time. Its NOT free but the price is worth it compare to the time you will spend building the wrappers for all platforms.\n\nOnce you get this, you can start learning OpenCV from the following link.\n\nhttp://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/tutorials.html\n\nhttp://opencv-srf.blogspot.com/\n\nhttp://shervinemami.info/openCV.html\n\nhttp://www.cs.iit.edu/~agam/cs512/lect-notes/opencv-intro/opencv-intro.html"
