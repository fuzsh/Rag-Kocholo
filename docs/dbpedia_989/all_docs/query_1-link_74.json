        "text": "Our Bachelor of Science in Information Technology degree was the first BSIT program in Ohio and one of the first ten in the nation to receive accreditation from the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology. The program is uniquely designed to provide hands-on experience in the core foundation of information technology. Almost all major courses are hands-on, requiring projects and lab experience. Students participate and complete a two-semester senior design experience, in which they develop a real-life IT solution and present it to the community in the annual IT Expo.\n\nIn addition to the unique hands-on experience in the classroom, the IT program requires five semesters of cooperative education (co-op). Beginning their sophomore year, students alternate semesters of paid work in the IT industry with semesters of classroom instruction. The fulltime paid co-op working experience positions IT graduates to have over one year of work experience at the time of their graduation, making them highly competitive for career opportunities. The UC co-op program provides local, national and international placement opportunities.\n\nThe IT program emphasizes problem solving, communication, hands-on skills, innovation and integration in which the technology serves the mission and interest of the users and the organization.\n\nHonors Program—The University of Cincinnati honors program offers small, interactive classes that allow students to receive personalized instruction and to learn more effectively. The honors program enriches the educational experience of top students through course work and out-of-class experiences. Special topics courses allow honors students to broaden their intellectual horizons regardless of the discipline in which they are majoring. Students may also earn honors credit through experiential learning. Incoming freshmen are eligible to be invited to participate.\n\nStudent Organizations—To develop professionally and showcase leadership talents, many professional and social organizations exist in the college. In the School of Information Technology, there are two organizations: the Information Technology Student Association (ITSA) and Women in Information Technology (WIT).\n\nStudy Abroad—Study-abroad opportunities exist through the UC International Programs office. Students can study anywhere in the world on any type of program as long as they work with UC International Programs, get approval from their academic adviser and bring back a transcript with passing grades from an accredited institution. There are four different types of study-abroad experiences: UC programs, exchange programs, program providers and direct enrollment.\n\nCooperative Education (co-op)—The five semesters full time paid co-op working experience provides students with unique technical and interpersonal skills that highly prepare them for career opportunities of their choice. Local, regional and international companies in all types of industries and all sizes participate in this program, offering IT students unique opportunities. The income received helps many students graduate debt-free.\n\nInformation Technology Expo (IT Expo)—This annual community event is a unique tradition of the IT program at UC. Senior students present the IT solution they developed in their senior project to the community in an expo-like environment. Students learn how to communicate the complex technical solution and its impact and value to the public. Faculty, students, and invited guests also present research at the symposium. Projects are judged by local industry and each year, multiple awards are presented.\n\nAdmission to this program is generally available for students transferring to the University of Cincinnati if they were admissible directly from high school and have a 2.75 cumulative GPA (all prior institutions combined).\n\nStudents who were NOT admissible directly from high school must have:\n\n24 semester (36 quarter) hours earned\n\nat least a 2.75 cumulative GPA (all prior institutions combined)\n\nPlease note: If a potential student is interested in this major and does not meet these minimum standards, they are strongly encouraged to meet with a CECH Academic Advisor to develop an academic plan and discuss a more holistic approach to the admission process."
