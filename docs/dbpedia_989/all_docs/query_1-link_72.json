        "text": "The information in this section corresponds to the academic year 2024-2025\n\nGroupLanguage of instructionTeachersG15, classroom instruction, morningsEnglishJoan Casas Roma\n\nObjectives\n\nIn this course we will explore the fundamentals of game design and we will design both non-digital and digital games. This is important for understanding the basic concepts that go into a game and to sharpen our understanding of games by creating, analyzing and critiquing them. While it might seem that non-digital and digital games are quite different, all kinds of games share plenty of fundamentals that allow game designers to work in any medium to create games.\n\nAs part of the module sessions, the students will play, analyse and design games. They will also need to understand what are the differences between game development and game design, and to get familiar with some of the main tasks involved in game design. The course requires regular reading, writing and presentation exercises.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nLearning objectives\n\nStudents who successfully complete this subject will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the principles of game design and game development phases.\n\nCreate traditional games such as board and card games.\n\nPrepare digital games.\n\nDemonstrate capacity to communicate.\n\nDemonstrate a capacity for critical analysis of the theoretical and practical contexts relevant to this area.\n\nIdentify and apply appropriate research methods and theoretical frameworks for game design.\n\nArticulate a presentation.\n\nWrite a game design document (GDD) using the vocabulary acquired in class.\n\nGeneric Skills\n\nStudents who successfully complete this subject will be able to:\n\nIdentify and apply appropriate research methods and theoretical frameworks for independent study of media industries and digital culture.\n\nDemonstrate a capacity for critical analysis of the theoretical and practical contexts relevant to this area.\n\nCompetencies\n\nGeneral skills\n\nDesire to take part in lifelong learning, innovate, create value and acquire new knowledge.\n\nSpecific skills\n\nKnow about theory, requirements and basic aspects for conceptual design of games.\n\nBasic skills\n\nStudents have developed the learning skills necessary to undertake further studies with a high degree of independent learning.\n\nCore skills\n\nDisplay professional skills in complex multidisciplinary contexts, working in networked teams, whether face-to-face or online, through use of information and communication technology.\n\nUse oral, written and audiovisual forms of communication, in one's own language and in foreign languages, with a high standard of use, form and content.\n\nContent\n\nGame design concepts\n\nGame elements\n\nRules and mechanics\n\nWorld, narrative and character design\n\nUI and level design\n\nGame Design Document (GDD)\n\nMDA Framework\n\nPlaytesting\n\nGame pitch\n\nEvaluation\n\nYour grade will be determined based on:\n\nParticipation and work tracking (individual): 10%\n\nTeam-based workshop activities: 20%\n\nGame analysis tasks (individual): 35%\n\nDigital game preparation project (individual): 35%\n\nA second chance submission of some of the tasks seen throughout the module will be available to recover 45% of the mark.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis module will be divided in two kinds of sessions: seminar sessions and workshop sessions.\n\nIn seminar sessions, the key concepts related to game design will be presented, explained and exemplified through existing digital and non-digital games. Seminar sessions are meant to encourage and foster discussion among the students in order to understand and integrate key knowledge, skills and concepts that will need to be put into practice afterwards.\n\nIn workshop sessions, some of the key concepts seen in the seminar sessions will be put into practice. Students will work on both team-based and individual projects and activities related to designing prototypes of board games, modifying existing ones, and pitching and playtesting games, among others.\n\nAdditional attendance requirements\n\nIn the course, it is expected that the student will attend both seminar and workshops sessions, as well as virtual campus announcements. Furthermore, the student is responsible for completing the assignments on time and following their requirements.\n\nStudents are expected to be honest and ethical at all times in the pursuit of academic goals. Students who are found to be in violation of administrative procedure, will receive a grade of zero on the assignment or the module, depending on the gravity of such violation.\n\nBibliography\n\nBibliography\n\nKoster, R.
