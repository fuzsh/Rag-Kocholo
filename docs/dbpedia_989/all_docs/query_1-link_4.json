        "text": "Frank Luna\n\nFrank Luna has programmed interactive 3D computer graphics for more than a decade. He has 15 years of C++ programming experience, having worked as a contractor, with Hero Interactive, and on the open source Scorch 3D engine. Since 2004, he has taught C++ and mathematics for games at the Game Institute. He has also written a number of best-selling textbooks on game and graphics programming, including \"Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 11.0.\"\n\nJohn DeGoes\n\nJohn DeGoes began writing software and designing digital logic circuits during the early 1980s. He has been actively involved in the fields of computer science, mathematics, and game development for more than fifteen years. He has authored two games programming books, \"3D Game Programming with C++\" and \"3D Game Programming with C++ Gold Edition\" and several published articles on the subject. DeGoes holds a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics from Montana State University-Billings and is working on his doctorate in applied mathematics.\n\nGary Simmons\n\nGary Simmons started programming games in 1981. In May 2000, he founded Mr.GameMaker.com, a teaching site dedicated to helping game programmers (hobbyists and professionals alike) learn cutting-edge game programming techniques. Simmons has published dozens of full-length game development papers and tutorials. He has been teaching since 2001 and also serves as a faculty director.\n\nAdam Hoult\n\nAdam Hoult is the lead technology developer at the Game Institute. He started programming in the early 1980s and has since developed a number of engine and tool design projects. Hoult spent time running a development tools production company and game programming site. Eventually, he teamed up with fellow instructor Gary Simmons to develop the successful Mr.GameMaker.com teaching website.\n\nBrian Hall\n\nBrian Hall is an engineer and AI programmer at Midway Amusement Games. He currently works on advanced AI algorithms for an upcoming action-adventure console title. He has also designed and written parametetric airport generation software for SimAuthor Inc, as well as a real-time CLOD terrain system using real-world satellite imagery and elevation data. Previously, Hall was a senior engineer at Accurate Automation Corporation, where he developed real-time learning systems for detecting pilot-induced oscillations in aircraft."
