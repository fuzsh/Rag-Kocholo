What do you suggest I do?\n\nHere is a link to his code.\n\nI know how to fix this. The first way is to use groups. He should create a group and then add monster in it. Here’s what I did.\n\nYou also have to tell him to put drawSprites(monsterGroup) after the drawSprites(). But then I tried to do this, and it didn’t work. The monster truck wasn’t drawn, and that’s when I saw that monster wasn’t visible.\n\nHere’s the link to the code. Code.org - Game Lab\n\nNow it works, but there is another way to fix it. He can place the declaration of his monster sprite after the declaration of the background sprite. So basically just put the lines 4, 5 and 6 between the lines desert.setAnimation(“desert”);\n\nand\n\nvar Jack = createSprite(200, 200);\n\nHe should also delete that monster.visible = false; line because that’s the reason he wasn’t seeing the monster.\n\nHere’s the code: Code.org - Game Lab\n\nThank you for getting back to me. Since we haven’t used groups it might be better for him to work on layering the monster sprite after the declaration of other background sprite like you suggested. When I change the layering I am still not seeing the monster truck. I have compared our code and I can’t see what you did to make it show up. Can you look at the code I have changed as you suggested and see what I am doing differently?"
