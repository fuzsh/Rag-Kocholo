I need to connect it with my math content standards, but I cannot see how students can perform a reflection in sprite lab.\n\nI don’t have time to teach all of unit 3 in CS discoveries so students can use game lab – is there another way I can address this?\n\nThank you\n\nLibby\n\nHi @eoften,\n\nYou might need to give us more information about what you mean by reflection. I am thinking very literally (a mirror image of something) but not sure if that is what you mean.\n\nThere are some other resources that MAY?? be helpful to you:\n\nHere is a catalog of code.org curriculum where you can search by topic. It also does a good job of showing smaller activities and age group. Perhaps you can find something that would work with your limited time.\n\nComputer Science Connections is also another resource that shows some examples of code.org cs lessons that would work in classrooms such as math or language arts.\n\nI know these may not be exactly what you are looking for. Let us know more information about your question and hopefully someone can share more resources.\n\n~Michelle\n\nHello,\n\nThank you for your response. I had been using the code.org CSP curriculum, but now I am looking to use something with my high school geometry class.\n\nSo yes, I am looking at reflecting a sprite as a mirror image. I used the catalog of curriculum to find the level F curriculum, which I had thought would work, but the sprites do not appear toe be doing a pure reflection there.\n\nAt this time, I switched over to game lab, and am extending the project over a few weeks for students to work on asynchronously with structured check in points. It looks like there is a sprite.mirror() function in game lab that does not exist in sprite lab."
