        "text": "RE: Share Your Game Development Stories!\n\nMake a Good Mega Man Level 2 submissions had finished and we were putting in our last changes before the game was compiled and sent to the judges. Everyone was reverting stuff and just trying to get the game playable as fast as possible to get the EXE to the judges as fast as possible. I was in the middle of rewriting the Quick Laser code so that it could be stopped by Yoku Blocks. A rewrite that I had got kinda mostly working while I was making my submission for the contest, and had incorporated that functionality into my submission. The problem was it freaked out if you put the laser directly against walls, and I hadn't been able to figure it out yet.\n\nSo they're about to push out the judge EXE to the judges and the Quick Lasers in my stage would be broken without the fix. I said to wait, and put the rewrite as it's own object that was specifically used just for my stage and left the original Quick Laser code alone, and then nudged the laser spawner objects in my stage a pixel away from the walls so they wouldn't freak out. So I do that, and the EXE gets pushed out to the judges and stuff.\n\nBut then.\n\nQuote:ERROR in\n\naction number 1\n\nof Step Event\n\nfor object objQuickLaser_Entity1037:\n\nError in code at line 12:\n\nlist = collisionRectangleList(bbox_left, bbox_top, bbox_right, bbox_bottom, solids[i], false, false);\n\n^\n\nat position 86: Unknown variable solids\n\nI didn't test the object due to my rushing, just thinking that it would work since it was a very simple, straightforward procedure (never do this). I found the error after the EXE was sent to the judges. They facepalmed. But I fixed the error real quick, and they sent the EXE to the judges again. They were like \"it's okay it happens\" and all was well.\n\nBut THEN\n\nI tested it after and it turns out I HAD LEFT A SHOW_MESSAGE CALL THAT I USED TO DEBUG AND FIX THAT ERROR! So when you go into a room with the laser object it would spawn a message window and freeze the game, and every time you closed the window the game only ticks one frame and then another one shows up. Basically it made it impossible to have proper game inputs register, soft locking the game.\n\nAt this point somebody had renamed the dev chat's name to \"entity-fails-at-life\".\n\nWell I removed the show_message calls, and since the game was delayed already some people asked me to do some more quick fixes while I was at it, and the judge EXE went out for real this time. But the entire chat was just laughing their asses off at how stupid the situation was.\n\nAnd that's the story of how I single-handedly delayed MaGMML2 judging.\n\nProgramming a thing, ba da baa, programming a thing, ba da baa...\n\n(This post was last modified: 11-04-2018, 10:20 PM by Entity1037.)\n\nRE: Share Your Game Development Stories!\n\nThis reply actually took me days to write so it's gonna be a long one here.\n\nMy very first experience with game development started back in 2008-2009 back when i found Game Maker 6, and it was a program known to make games using Drag & Drop actions (other than using GML to actually make good games). Let's say my experience seemed fun at all when i registered a YoYo Games (Sandbox) account and i had played a plenty of crappy games (mostly crappy Mario fangames because I was a big mario fan back then), mostly i was into pretty simple platformers made using Mark Overmars' shitty platformer tutorial. Beyond that, i made lots of \"games\", many of them that make no sense at all (if you want, i'll share a collection of (not all) these old games, but they're all in .gmk format).\n\nAfter 2009, I used Game Maker for years and made some more games (one last game i've tried to make was called \"A Penguin's Adventure\" which was a very lame platformer featuring a MS Paint penguin going through 18 GODDAMN WORLDS, and uses the SMB3 assets for some reason) until after Game Maker 8's release. I was slowly going away with using this program once i was interested on radel999/HTFMegaman's Happy Tree Friends Adventures, a fangame series that mashed up Happy Tree Friends with various old Konami classic games (radel999 was a big fan of old Konami games) which then made me get into using Multimedia Fusion 2 (now Fusion 2.5) due to its visual scripting GUI that didn't use a programming language for eventing. Due to it's very simple programming features, I used Fusion 2.5 for like three (or four) years (and GameMaker became my rival).\n\nSo far, with Fusion 2.5, over time, i only managed to get several games out of the hood, but none of them are quality. Most of these games are horizontal SHMUP games, starting from NASUBI (based off some shovelware iOS game i don't remember), Player 1 Quest (a lame platforming fangame that used a character from a MFGG inside joke fangame), Klickodius Galaxies (another terrible SHMUP with a very crappy weapon progression system + has no game over as it stops the game after you lose all lives), then there were other games done with that but i had so many unfinished projects using Fusion 2.5, and about 90% of these games' qualities are brutally crap as my first MMF2 games. The last game I ever published was Space Karter: Foregone Warriors (which you can find it in my GameJolt profile), and it’s yet another SHMUP, but not much worse than my old SHMUPS but it’s still horrid due to insane enemy movements and crappy bullet patterns, not that the save system I implemented is also broken.\n\nIn midst of using Fusion 2.5, i used different engines like the RPG Maker series, starting with RPG Maker XP, which however, i never fully used it, and with the classic VX. With RPG Maker VX, i spent few years using this engine for fun and my very first game was a very linear one where the first boss was a grim reaper whom you fight when you simply interacted with a door, while other bosses are the Dr. Mario Virus and the last boss was Giygas from EarthBound (back then i had a very likeable interest of EarthBound despite not playing the game, and at ths day i still haven't played it), in a very crappy way to enact the boss's original transcript.\n\nAfter using VX and numerous attempts to make a tons of projects including a RPG about very small spaceships travelling in lands, a RPG starring a Roblox noob, etc., none of these projects came to light, but once VX Ace came out, it has become my best RPG Maker engine of all time, even to this day. I still made a bunch of stuff with VX Ace and i was more creative with it... but like what happened with VX, none of these projects were completed and were cancelled, but unlike how i did games back in VX, few of my projects in VX Ace are still on my hard drive (few projects i can show are SiER [a RPG game featuring some group of members from a dissolved forum community], an OFF action RPG fangame taking place after the events of OFF, a Five Nights at F***boys fangame and a SammyClassicSonicFan fangame that had a very absurd game length planned, and that’s the only project ever made that currently has a large portion of the game done, while the bigger portion isn’t).\n\nAnother game engine i got into is ZDoom, where i only did a joke .wad based on the very crude UAC Military Nightmare (it was infamous for its very mature content and contained Skulltag's creator treating him as a sexual antagonist), and like its original inspiration, it used random stuff and a confusing story involving a random person called Valletta (actually named after Malta's capital city) who gets in contact with a \"spriit\" after awakening from a nightmare and must defeat the dark side who is taking over the world. The .wad file resulted in an insane difficulty and i only had been playtesting this while resurrecting non-stop with the console, thus resulting the game being unbeatable without cheats.\n\nBack onto Fusion 2.5, when the FNAF fangame craze started for a while, my last moments using it was when i made a useless prototype of a Super Mario Kart using a Mode 7 rendering extension, then i tried replicating a Castlevania engine using the Platform Movement Object extension. With it, i was planning an Angry German Kid game that went with the Castlevania platforming style... but you know, that didn't happen, too. Thus follows a crisis that would lead me to stop using Fusion 2.5 as soon i never felt making games again.\n\nIn 2016, i went in to finally start reusing Game Maker and trying to learn GML by making a very simple program, but that practice i did wasn't much until one day, when Mega Engine came out, i was tempted to make a extraordinary return to GameMaker after years on hating this engine, so i have further proven that i've managed to get into programming, but i could only use GML out of all the programming languages because it is used within GameMaker's GUI. Other programming languages, including C++, is still hard for me to learn. Furthermore, after messing around with Mega Engine, i started working on a Darius engine and then a vertical SHMUP engine, that however, not both of these are done, but the vertical SHMUP engine was going to be used for a Raiden Fighters-based fangame, and it was actually better than how I worked on Fusion 2.5.\n\nSometimes i rarely tend to use Fusion 2.5 only for specific projects, but GameMaker: Studio will actually remain my true main game development engine, even if it's harder to use than Fusion 2.5. Currently, I still have the usual habit of switching too many projects and canning many of them, but at the time I wrote this, I’ve been working on a Mega Man joke fangame."
