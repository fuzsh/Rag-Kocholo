Hands-on gaming experience is a start, but you must also be able to draft and conceptualize a video game on paper and translate this idea into design software. Beyond this, you need to master the four major skill sets used by entry-level video game designers: programming languages, mathematics skills, game asset creation, and modern real-time game engines.\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A VIDEO GAME DESIGNER AND VIDEO GAME DEVELOPER?\n\nWhile video game designers are more involved with character, level and animation design, developers build out the world of a video game using various programming languages. Having both technical and design skills is an important aspect of planning and shipping a video game.\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nCreate your own video game as a portfolio piece\n\nLearn how to design and create video games for PC\n\nUnderstand the technical and aesthetic fundamentals for creating a successful game\n\nMaster the math, programming language, and game engine knowledge needed to design video games\n\nEnroll Now\n\nPrerequisites\n\nTo succeed in this course, you will need basic computer skills and a high school-level understanding of mathematics.\n\nCurriculum\n\nC++ PROGRAMMING FOR GAME DEVELOPERS I\n\nLearn the fundamentals of creating a C++ program.
