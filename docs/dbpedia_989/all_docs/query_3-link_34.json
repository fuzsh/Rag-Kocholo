Explore scratch coding for beginners online with a free class.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHow fun would it be if you could dress up your sprite just like yourself?\n\nIn Scratch, that is possible using a sprite costume! In this article, we’ll guide you in adding different accessories to make your sprite look better and fun!\n\nScratch Programming\n\nScratch is a visual programming language and an online community developed by the MIT Media Lab. It is designed to teach coding concepts to beginners, especially kids, in a fun and interactive way.\n\nScratch provides a graphical interface where users can drag and drop code blocks to create animations, games, stories, and interactive projects. If you are new to scratch programming, then we recommend you read the A to Z Guide on Block Coding.\n\nWhat are Sprite Costumes in Scratch programming?\n\nAs you can guess, a sprite costume refers to your sprite’s appearance or visual features. Each sprite can have multiple costumes, which allow it to change its appearance dynamically during the program’s execution.\n\nWhy do you think costumes would be used in Scratch? Well, it is used for creating animations, character movements, and visual effects in Scratch projects.\n\nThese costumes can be named, created, edited, deleted, and changed – so many options! The best part is that each and every sprite must have at least one costume. Each sprite has a default costume.\n\nHow to Make a Sprite Costume in Scratch?\n\nHere’s how you can customize your Sprite to look pretty and fun:\n\nCreate a Costume\n\nThere are two ways of getting a costume or background for a sprite or stage. (Yes, you can even customize the background of your Scratch Project!)\n\nDrawing one using the inbuilt Scratch built-in editor by selecting your sprite and clicking the “paint” button.\n\nGetting an image or multiple images from your computer, either by clicking the “import” button as shown or dragging in an image from an open folder.\n\nEdit a Costume\n\nThere are two different categories of costumes: Vector and Bitmap. Bitmap costumes are made from small dots called pixels. On the other hand, Vector costumes are made up of straight lines.\n\nHere is an image that highlights the difference:\n\nNow, Scratch offers similar editing options for both types of costumes with only minor differences. You’ll find more about it as you read ahead.\n\nIf you want to select an editing option, then you would have to click on the buttons shown above. You can find these buttons just below the paint editor.\n\nEditing in Bitmap\n\nThe brush. The brush is used to make general shapes, and it is the most common costume-making tool.\n\nThe line. The line is for creating straight edges that are hard to create with the brush.\n\nThe rectangle tool (or press and hold shift to draw a square). With this, you can draw a perfect box without much hassle.\n\nThe circle tool (Press and hold shift to draw a circle). This tool creates a better circle or oval than the brush tool if you want a good circle.\n\nThe text. Click on the place you want to type, and a text box will pop up. This may be used for labelling or custom texts.\n\nThe ‘fill with colour’ tool. Click anywhere to fill that space with any colour of your choice.\n\nThe eraser. You know what an eraser does! It eliminates the colour or whatever customization you have applied!\n\nThe ‘select’ tool. You use it to move the selected space to a new position.\n\nEditing in Vector\n\nThere are 9 editing options in the vector category, but only 2 of them are different from the bitmap category mentioned above. Let’s dive into the different functionality:\n\nThe reshape tool. After selecting an item, dots will appear around the shape in different places. You can move the dots around to create custom shapes, like a triangle from a square. How cool is that?\n\nThe select tool. It has the same function as discussed above. The only difference is when you select an object, two smart tools pop up: “Send back one layer” and the “Send forward one layer” tools.\n\nFor example, if your sprite is wearing a shirt and a jacket, then the shirt will be behind the jacket, so we can use the “Send back” option on the shirt.\n\nCostume-Related Blocks\n\nDo you want your sprite to change costumes mid-game, or support add-on customization? You can do all that via these code blocks:\n\nBased on the same colour of the first three blocks, you can tell they belong in the same “Looks” block section. On the other hand, the last block can be found in the “Sensing” block area.\n\nLet’s explain the purpose of each of these blocks:\n\nThe first block is used to switch the costumes of the sprite after some specific action.\n\nThe second block is used to trigger the next costume, if any.\n\nThe third block contains the number of the current costume of a sprite. You can select a particular costume for your sprite based on a specific condition.\n\nThe fourth block allows for any sprite’s dimensions, costume amount, volume, and size to be read.\n\nConclusion\n\nKudos to you for completing this journey with us. Now, you know everything about styling your sprites into fun and animated characters through costumes. Anytime you create a project on Scratch, don’t forget to customize your sprites according to your liking.\n\nScratch is a powerful tool that allows you to unleash your creativity and learn the basics of coding in a fun and engaging way."
