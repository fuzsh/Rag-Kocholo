        "text": "Images kids can create and program within a block-based coding interface are referred to as “actors” or “sprites.” Sprites can take a variety of forms, including random shapes, animals, and people, and the like. Different types of commands called code blocks are used to define how a sprite behaves. For example, looks blocks will define appearance, sound blocks make them audible, and motion blocks make them move.\n\nHere are some other things you may have always wanted to know about sprites.\n\nWhat are Sprites in Computer Science?\n\nIn computer science, a sprite is like a picture or drawing that we use in computer programs and games. It’s not 3D or fancy; it’s just a flat image, like a character or an item in a video game. Think of it as a sticker that we can move around on a computer screen.\n\nWe see sprites a lot in video games because they’re great for making characters and objects move and do things. Imagine a game where a character runs and jumps. The sprite of that character changes very quickly to make it look like they’re running and jumping. It’s like flipping through a flipbook really fast to see a smooth animation.\n\nSprites also help make things in computer programs look nice. They can be buttons, icons, or even health bars in a game. So, sprites are like the building blocks of pictures and animations in the digital world, helping us create all sorts of fun and useful things on our computers.\n\nHow Sprites Work\n\nInvented to minimize video game memory and storage requirements, they have since been adapted to perform in a variety of operations. Capable of being created from a blank screen or imported from other sources, sprites can be endowed with a variety of scripts, costumes and sounds. Instructions governing a sprite’s actions are referred to as scripts, while costumes define sprite’s appearance. The sounds a sprite makes are based upon its assigned audio clips.\n\nOnce created, a sprite can be resized, rotated and animated. A sprite’s interactions with other elements on the screen such as walls, platforms, furniture and the like can be programmed as well.\n\nCoding Sprites\n\nKids code sprites by “snapping” graphical blocks together, as opposed to authoring lines of code as is required in text-based coding. Each graphical block informs a specific state — such as a sprite’s appearance, motion or sound. “Stacked” one atop another, each of the coding blocks is executed in a descending sequence when the program is activated. A simple program might look like this: When this actor is clicked, it will play the squeak 1 sound effect.\n\nThis makes block coding easy to grasp, which is why it’s ideal for young children.\n\nWith these tools, kids can create sprites that talk, change costumes, grow, shrink and jump. They can also change backdrops and glide. With so much flexibility at their disposal, young programmers can create entire scenarios in which sprites perform in almost any manner they can imagine.\n\nLet’s say for example a child want to create a fish that changes color.\n\nTo accomplish this, they would create a repeat loop by stacking a “when actor clicked” block atop a “repeat” block atop a “wait” block, which can be set to the desired number of seconds of delay before the color change. To get the fish to change colors, a “change effect by” block would be inserted between the “repeat” and “wait” blocks. Nearly any other actions, such as swimming in circles, or growing, can be programmed to using similar blocks.\n\nWhat are sprite examples?\n\nCharacter sprites are like the actors in a video game. They’re 2D pictures that show the game’s characters doing different things, like walking, running, or jumping. Imagine a character in a game moving smoothly – that’s thanks to these sprites changing quickly to create the illusion of motion.\n\nThese character sprites also help show emotions and changes in the game. If a character is happy, sad, or surprised, the sprite changes to reflect that. As you progress in the game, characters can also get stronger or change their appearance, and these sprites show those transformations. So, character sprites are not just about how characters move but also how they feel and grow in the game.\n\nGame designers put a lot of work into making sure character sprites match the game’s look and story. They want players to feel like they’re part of the game world, and character sprites are a big part of making that happen.\n\nIntroducing Variables\n\nNumbers, words, and true-or-false values can be stored as variables. Variables can take one of two forms: local and global. A local variable is assigned to a particular actor or sprite, which is the only one that can access and modify it. Global variables can be employed and changed by any actor in a given project. This means that any data that needs to be shared by multiple actor can be stored as global. Such data can track the number of lives remaining for each character, or the overall score of a game.\n\nIn Summary\n\nAmong the things you may have always wanted to know about sprites, they can make block-based coding easier to grasp. Moreover, they have the potential to ensure kids get a sense of accomplishment as they play. In this way, sprites can make learning to code both easy and engaging. Block-coding introduces kids to the key concepts they’ll need to understand before moving on to text-based coding.\n\nHow To With Tynker\n\nTynker calls sprites “Actors,” and you can see all the actors in your Tynker project by looking at the Actor List.

At the core of all these amazing projects and discoveries is CODE. Code can be the thing that differentiates your child from peers and allows them to stand out as an asset for companies when they are looking for employment. The children who learn to code today will become the creators of the technology tomorrow. Learning to code can help children make a major contribution to the world that they live in and make a lasting impact.\n\nAs kids and teens learn to code, they also build essential skills like critical thinking, logic, and problem-solving. They learn to logically sequence events, create playable games, tell good stories, and model real situations. They also learn computational thinking by developing algorithmic and design thinking abilities. Coding for kids has become an essential element of a child’s education and an excellent way to express their creativity and imagination.\n\nHow Do I Start My Child Coding?\n\nCoding, otherwise known as programming, is a creative activity for all children. Your child might not care about writing data processing algorithms, but they might enjoy creating games, programming music, designing websites, or just playing with code. Learning to code is for everyone; you don’t have to be good at math or a “techie” to learn how to code. Kids as young as five can learn to code and pick it up faster than most adults.\n\nWhen your kids are starting, pick a program like MIT’s Scratch or Tynker Junior app. The visual style of these programs makes it easy for young children to learn to code. Scratch and Tynker have a graphical interface that works. Drag-and-drop code blocks snap together. Pieces of code that don’t make computational sense won’t fit together, making syntax errors impossible.\n\nOlder children can learn to code with Python by building games, art, music, and more. Some programs like Tynker offer a placement test to set your child on the right track for their age and experience level.\n\nWhat Age Is Best To Introduce Coding To Kids?\n\nEvery child learns at their own pace. They can learn different subjects at varying rates and ways. Experts believe that children should learn coding at an early age. According to MIT, the best age for kids to start learning coding languages such as Scratch Jr. or Tynker Jr. is from 5 to 7. Many programs allow your children to progress at their own pace or hire an instructor to help them move along.\n\nWith Tynker, a placement test will place your child on the correct path based on age and skill level, and Tynker supports children up to age 18 with real-world text languages like Python and JavaScript. Children progress to more difficult coding courses with the support of interactive tutorials and video instructions at their own pace.\n\nWhich Is The Best Coding For Kids Program?\n\nWith so many great services available, learning to code has never been easier!
