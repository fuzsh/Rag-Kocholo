Starting with the premise that video games are best viewed as a subset of humankind's much longer history of games, we will look through the past several thousand years, examining not only games, but also the people who study, create, and play them. Most importantly, we will take time to critically play the games we discuss, enabling students to gain a critical understanding and appreciation of canonical games.\n\nCredits: 3.00\n\nDGD 3 Game Studies\n\nThis is the most purely academic of the Core Digital Game Design and Development classes. This course asks students to read and write about games from an interested academic perspective. Throughout the semester, students will read works ranging from Dutch historian Johan Huizinga's Homo Ludens, an early 20th century sociological study of the role of play among humans, to Mary Flannagan's Critical Play, a much more modern look at games and their influence on modern art. While the core of the class is based on weekly readings and student responses, students will write major papers during the semester. During class time students will discuss the readings and make presentations based on their papers. Examples from both historical games and modern games will be used in class discussions.\n\nCredits: 3.00\n\nDGD 4 Digital Game Development 1\n\nDigital Game Development 1 is the first hands-on video game development class in the Digital Game Design and Development Program. This course focuses on the basic programming skills a student needs to start developing games on their own. As this is an introductory class, students are not expected to have any previous programming knowledge. Students will learn core programming concepts such as variables, if statements, for loops, arrays, functions, and object-oriented programming.

They will also learn how to successfully use visuals to enhance games with techniques like particle effects and interesting lighting.\n\nCredits: 3.00\n\nDGD 22 Audio Design for Games\n\nGames are multimedia entities and audio is an integral part of the experience. Creating compelling audio for games requires sound designers who know how to deal with interaction as well as the technical requirements of a given game system or platform. In this course, students will learn how to create dynamic audio for games that enhance the play experience and define the mood they intend to create.\n\nCredits: 3.00\n\nDGD 90 Senior Game Prototyping\n\nThis course helps students prepare for their senior project in the spring semester. This class provides guided ideation and prototyping as students determine what their senior project will be and how to best approach making it a reality in a limited amount of time.\n\nCredits: 3.00\n\nDGD 91 Senior Game Project\n\nThe entire Digital Game Design and Development program leads to the Senior Game Project. This class requires students to bring together everything they have learned over the course of the program to create a major final project. The Senior Game Project allows students to work as individuals or in groups of any size. Students do not need permission from the instructor to pursue a particular project. The primary requirement is that, by the end of the semester, each student has created a complete, polished, and successful game.\n\nCredits: 3.00\n\nMUS 14A Introduction to Music Technology\n\nThis course introduces students to digital music production, digital audio editing, sequencing and music notation at the computer.\n\nCredits: 3.00\n\nMUS 14B Sequencing and Production\n\nThis course is a continuation of MUS 14A centering on MIDI sequencing and includes explanations and demonstrations of recording and arranging techniques for creating dynamic musical sequences in any musical style.\n\nCredits: 3.00\n\nMUS 14C Music Notation Software"
