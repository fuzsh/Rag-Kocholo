BOSTON â€” Anthony Quinn, the barrel-chested Oscar winner known for his roles as the earthy hero of "Zorba the Greek" and the fierce Bedouin leader in "Lawrence of Arabia," died yesterday. He was 86.

Quinn's death was reported by Providence, R.I., Mayor Vincent "Buddy" Cianci. He said Quinn died of respiratory failure yesterday morning at a Boston hospital.

"He was larger than life," Cianci said. "I was proud to call him a friend." Quinn was living in Bristol, R.I., near Providence.

Quinn, who appeared in more than 100 feature films, won Academy Awards for best supporting actor in "Viva Zapata!" and "Lust for Life."

Born in Mexico and raised in poverty in East Los Angeles, Quinn went from stage and B-movie roles to become an international leading man renowned for his big-man sensitivit honest acting style.

In a film career spanning almost 50 years, Quinn portrayed characters ranging from kings to Indians, including a pope, a boxer and an artist. "I never get the girl," Quinn once joked in an interview. "I wind up with a country instead."

He won his first Oscar for his work in the 1952 film "Viva Zapata!" as brother of Mexican revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata.

To many, Quinn's Oscar-nominated characterization of the Greek peasant Zorba from the Nikos Kazantzakis novel remained his most memorable role. The ouzo-drinking and bouzouki-dancing Zorba was Quinn's favorite role as well, so much so that he returned to the stage in 1983 in a revival of the 1965 film role.

As a child, he shined shoes, sold papers and preached with Aimee Semple McPherson. After working as an movie extra, he met and married the adopted daughter of Cecil B. De Mille, Katherine.

A real-life artist, sculptor and author, his role as painter Paul Gauguin in the 1956 film "Lust for Life" earned him his second Oscar.

Quinn said in a 1987 interview that he reached most of the goals he set for himself as a young boy.

"I never satisfied that kid but I think he and I have made a deal now," he said, referring to his younger self. "It's like climbing a mountain: I didn't take him up Mount Everest, but I took him up Mount Whitney.

"And I think that's not bad."
