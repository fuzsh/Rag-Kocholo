        "text": "Anthony Quinn, Mexican (1915 - 2001)\n\nAnthony Quinn was born in Chihuahua, Mexico and his family moved to Los Angeles when he was four years old. Before becoming an Oscar winning actor, Quinn had been a prizefighter and a painter.\n\nHis first movie roll was in 1936. He made more than 100 films and appeared in several plays and television dramas.\n\nBetween takes on location and films he drew, painted and sculpted. Some of his best sculpture was created in Africa during the 1970s and 80s while he was working on a film there. Quinn was also a student and friend of Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nAnthony Quinn was a multi-faceted man of the world, intense, sensitive and dramatic. He is known to millions as a great performing artist for his work on the stage and in films; he is known only to a select few as a painter and sculptor.\n\nHe had boundless creative energies and talents and two consummate passions, women and his art.\n\nAt the age of 86, Anthony Quinn died of respiratory failure in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nThe Following Art is For Sale.
