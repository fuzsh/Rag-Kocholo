        "text": "(CBS/ AP) MALIBU, Calif. - A heart attack is suspected as the cause of actor Francesco Quinn's death Friday while walking on a street in Malibu. He was 48 and the son of Academy Award-winner Anthony Quinn.\n\nLos Angeles County sheriff's Lt. James Royal says Quinn was walking home from a store with his son when he collapsed on the Malibu street where he lived.\n\nThe Rome-born actor had appeared on screen several times with his famous father, including a TV movie based on Hemingway's best-selling novel \"The Old Man and the Sea,\" in which he played a younger version of Anthony's character.\n\nOne of Quinn's most memorable roles was as a raspy-voiced soldier named Rhah in the Oscar-winning Vietnam War drama \"Platoon.\" He also appeared in the television shows \"JAG,\" \"24\" and \"The Shield.\"\n\nHis agent, Arlene Thornton, tells the Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/qjRit9 ) that Quinn apparently died of a heart attack but the cause of death hasn't been officially determined.\n\nOne of a reported 13 of Anthony Quinn's children, Francesco was born in 1963 to Iolanda Addolori, who also was involved in the movie business as a wardrobe assistant.\n\nFrancesco was married to Valentina Castellani-Quinn, and had three children.\n\nHis father, who died in 2001, won two Academy Awards and starred in \"Zorba the Greek\" and \"Lawrence of Arabia.\""
