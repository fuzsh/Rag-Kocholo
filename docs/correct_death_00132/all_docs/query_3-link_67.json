        "text": "Utah Third District Court Judge Anthony Quinn died Thursday after he was hit by a driver while biking in Mill Creek Canyon. Quinn, who was 60, had served the Third District Court since 1997.\n\n\"It is with great sorrow that the court family has learned of the tragic passing of Judge Anthony Quinn. My deepest sympathies go out to his wife and family,\" said Utah Supreme Court Chief Justice Matthew Durrant in a statement. \"Judge Quinn was an outstanding judge and person whose service to the people of Utah over the past 16 years has touched countless lives. Our entire court family mourns his loss.\"\n\nUnified Police Lt. Justin Hoyal said the investigation of the accident is still ongoing and should take several weeks, as a crash analysis and reconnaissance team need to get more information from the scene. The name of the driver is not being released at this time.\n\nSummit County Attorney David Brickey said he and others in the County Attorney’s Office have appeared in front of Judge Quinn during their careers. Brickey said Quinn was \"firm and fair.\"\n\n\"We’re devastated by the loss of Judge Quinn, particularly in light of the fact that this is a community in which bicycle riders are all over the road,\" Brickey said. \"It’s a real wake-up call for all parties – drivers and bike riders – to be cognizant of one another and take care. It’s really tragic and a significant loss, not only for Judge Quinn’s family, but for our judiciary.\""
