        "text": "2. Anthony Quinn was born Antonio Rudolfo Oaxaca Quinn on April 21, 1915, in Chihuahua, Mexico, to Manuela (Oaxaca) and Francisco Quinn, who became an assistant cameraman at an LA film studio. His paternal grandfather was Irish, and the rest of his family was Mexican. His family moved to Los Angeles, California, where he grew up.\n\n4. Young Anthony had a number of experiences that influenced his later career as an actor. At different times, he was a professional boxer, studied architecture under Frank Lloyd Wright and was an assistant preacher to the famous evangelist, Aimee Simple McPherson. It was Frank Lloyd Wright who encouraged Quinn to pursue an acting career. After a short time doing stage performances and serving as a film extra, Quinn’s first starring role was in the 1936 film, Parole.\n\n6. Throughout his artistic career developed over four decades and a half, Anthony Quinn caused a lot of considerations that tried to catch in a few words the uniqueness of his personality as a man and actor. \"It is a presence that fills the house” declared those who knew him.\n\n8. Quinn appeared in more than a hundred feature films in his film career, including Lawrence of Arabia, Requiem for a Heavyweight, and, more recently, A Walk in the Clouds with Keanu Reeves in 1995. \"I can't retire,\" he told ABC's Bill Diehl \"I mean, I started working when I was a year and a half old, and I worked all my life.”\n\n10. He was one of the few actors to move easily and successfully between starring and supporting roles throughout his career. Quinn played a vast array of characters and ethnicities, including American, Arab, Basque, Chinese, English, French, Greek, Hawaiian, Hebrew, Hun, Irish, Italian, Mexican, Mongol, Native American, Filipino, Portuguese, Spaniard and Ukrainian. \"One of the reasons I did all the Greeks and Arab parts I did was because I was trying to identify myself as a man of the world,\" he told The Times.\n\n13. Quinn reached the zenith of his career, playing Zorba the Greek in the 1964 film of the same name(1964), which brought him his fourth, and last, Oscar nomination as Best Actor.\n\n15. He died on the 3rd of June 2001, in Boston, Massachusetts, from pneumonia and respiratory failure linked to his battle with throat cancer. He was 86 years old..\n\n17. His first wife was , the actress Katherine DeMille, who wed in 1937. The couple had five children: Christopher (1939-1941), Christina (born December 1, 1941), Catalina (born November 21, 1942), Duncan (born August 4, 1945), and Valentina (born December 26, 1952). In 1965, Quinn and DeMille were divorced, because of his affair with Italian costume designer Jolanda Addolori, whom he married in 1966.\n\n18. They had three children: Francesco Quinn (March 22, 1963 – August 5, 2011), Danny (born April 16, 1964), and Lorenzo Quinn (born May 7, 1966) . The union ended in 1997, after Quinn had children with his secretary, Katherine Benvin.\n\n19. He then married Benvin, with whom he had two children, Antonia Patricia Rose Quinn (born July 23, 1993) and Ryan Nicholas Quinn (born July 5, 1996). Quinn and Benvin remained married until his death.\n\n20. Quinn had also two children with Friedel Dunbar: Sean Quinn (born February 7, 1973) and Alex A. Quinn (born December 30, 1976)\n\n21. Anthony Quinn appeared in more movies with other Oscar-winning actors than any other Oscar-winning actor - a total of 46 Oscar-winning co-stars .\n\n22. Anthony Quinn is the actor who will forever remain in the history of the cinema and the public's memory as a symbol of vitality with the indestructible inner power and joy of life."
