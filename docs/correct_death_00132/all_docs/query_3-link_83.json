        "text": "Trying to beat rush-hour traffic in Boston often feels like being thrown into the middle of a “Mad Max” movie, so why not skip the road rage and watch “Fury Road” instead? Director George Miller returned to his cinematic post-apocalyptic world with his 2015 follow-up, this time giving Tom Hardy a turn at the steering wheel as the franchise’s titular character, played by Mel Gibson in the original trilogy. “Fury Road” also introduced fans to Charlize Theron’s Furiosa, who received her own spin-off prequel earlier this year, starring Anya Taylor-Joy as a younger version of the fierce imperator. Available on Max\n\nIf the summer heat has you wishing for the days of being bundled up on the T during the dead of winter, “Snowpiercer” might be able to help. This tale by Bong Joon-ho, the Academy Award-winning director of “Parasite,” stars Sudbury native Chris Evans as one of the few passengers lucky enough to be onboard a train that’s been built to keep its inhabitants out of the cold amid a new ice age. Unfortunately, the train is divided into a class system, with the wealthy living the good life in the front while the poor are struggling in the back of the train. Evans’s character ends up leading his fellow downtrodden passengers in a revolution and also discovers a “Soylent Green”-like twist with the train’s food supply along the way. Available on AMC+, Philo, Roku, and Sling TV\n\nAs one of American cinema’s most influential and important films, “In the Heat of the Night” by director Norman Jewison has left an indelible mark on the big screen and beyond. Based on John Ball’s novel of the same name, the 1967 classic crime story follows Virgil Tibbs, a Black homicide detective from Philadelphia played by Sidney Poitier, who receives a heated and racist welcoming by the Mississippi town’s white law enforcement when he arrives to investigate a murder. “In the Heat of the Night” won five Academy Awards, including a best actor nod for Rod Steiger’s role as Police Chief Bill Gillespie, Virgil’s hard-headed partner on the case. Available on MGM+, Pluto TV, Roku, and Tubi\n\nThe Oscar-winning drama “Anatomy of a Fall,” which also won the Palme d’Or at Cannes last year, was one of the most decorated international films of 2023. The drama stars Sandra Hüller as a grieving mother and widow who’s under investigation after her husband is found dead outside of their cabin in the French Alps. In addition to offering breathtaking views of snowy mountains, “Anatomy of a Fall” engrosses viewers with plenty of twists and turns that will have you guessing throughout its more than 2½-hour runtime. Available on Disney+ and Hulu\n\nTempers heat up in 1957′s “12 Angry Men,” the acclaimed film based on the 1954 teleplay by Reginald Rose, who also wrote the screenplay. Directed by Sidney Lumet, the classic legal drama centers around a dozen jurors stuck in a New York courthouse on a hot summer day as they deliberate over the evidence in a homicide trial. Henry Fonda earned a Golden Globe nomination for his role as Juror 8, the moral compasswho gets his fellow jurors to give the case an honest discussion. “12 Angry Men” also earned three Oscar nominations in 1958, including a nod for best picture. Available on MGM+, Pluto TV, Roku, and Tubi\n\nConcord in the winter gets some of the spotlight in the 2019 adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s classic coming-of-age drama, starring Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson, and Eliza Scanlen as the famed March sisters. Things get especially chilly during the scene where Pugh’s Amy falls through the ice on a frozen lake. “Little Women,” which earned a slew of accolades, including six Oscar nominations and one win for best costume design, filmed in Concord and all around the Bay State in 2018. Available on Hulu\n\nWish you were in Hawaii hanging out with furry alien friends who like to surf and rock out to Elvis? Same. Have a beach day indoors with Disney’s family-friendly animated classic “Lilo & Stitch,” which is reportedly getting the live-action treatment by the House of Mouse. In the meantime, take a trip back to 2002 with the animated original, which tells the heartwarming, “E.T.”-like tale of two sisters who befriend an alien and end up in a chaotic situation after it crash lands in Kauaʻi. Available on Disney+\n\nIf the family is feeling an icy adventure instead, there’s no better animated tale to cool off with than 2002′s “Ice Age.” This prehistoric comedy stars Ray Romano as Manny the mammoth, John Leguizamo as Sid the sloth, and Worcester’s own Denis Leary as Diego the saber-toothed tiger, who are all buddies as they make their way through the frozen landscape. While the film has spawned a slew of sequels (including several scientifically questionable entries where dinosaurs somehow still exist), trust us and stick with the original for your next movie night. Available on Disney+\n\nFor horror fans, summer screams movie night fun, and few films are as perfectly themed for the season as A24′s 2019 hit “Midsommar.” Director Ari Aster takes viewers on a nightmarish trip abroad with stars Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor, who play an American couple on a trip to Sweden with their friends to experience a summer festival. Thanks to some Swedish culty mayhem, the group of travelers gets into some pretty weird and dangerous stuff that, as you can expect, doesn’t end well for anyone. Maybe a trip to Disney World would be safer next time? Available on Max\n\nHere’s Johnny! For horror fans who’d prefer to have a chill sent down their spine, kick back with this wintry, scary movie classic courtesy of Stanley Kubrick. Based on Stephen King’s classic, “The Shining” stars Jack Nicholson and the late Shelley Duvall as a couple who become caretakers of a haunted hotel in Colorado and, along with their clairvoyant young son, are tormented by the evil lurking within its walls. Available on AMC+\n\nLisan al Gaib has arrived. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is back to foment rebellion on a scorching hot desert planet in this sandy sequel to director Denis Villeneuve’s 2021 sci-fi epic. One of the highest-grossing movies of 2024, “Dune: Part Two” follows Paul as he joins forces with Chani (Zendaya) and the native Fremen as they look to strike against Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) and his clan for the treachery they caused in the first film. If the sweltering desert setting and violent sandworms don’t have you sweating, the imperial intrigue will. Available on Max\n\nAre lightsaber battles and icy tundras more your speed? Skip the desert and immerse yourself in a frozen, alien world in the classic “Star Wars” sequel “The Empire Strikes Back.” In this intergalactic adventure, Luke (Mark Hamill), Han (Harrison Ford), Leia (Carrie Fisher), and the rest of the Rebel Alliance are hiding out on the ice planet Hoth when Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) and his Imperial forces arrive to cause trouble. Beyond the snowy tundra battles and face-offs with the yeti-like wampa, Han also famously gets put on ice (OK, technically the made-up substance carbonite), to Chewbacca’s chagrin. Available on Disney+\n\nFeel the heat of the desert without ever leaving your couch with the 1962 classic epic “Lawrence of Arabia.” Peter O’Toole plays the titular protagonist and famed British archaeologist and officer who rose to prominence for his role in World War I’s Arab Revolt. The film, which also stars Alec Guinness and Anthony Quinn, is a sprawling, nearly 4-hour biopic, so make sure to plan a few intermissions and bathroom breaks. Available on Amazon Prime Video\n\nTake a trip back to Middle Earth this summer and stream director Peter Jackson’s iconic first installment in “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy. Filmed in New Zealand, 2001′s “The Fellowship of the Ring” features incredible shots of sprawling, snowy mountains that will have viewers forgetting about the 90-degree weather outside. Follow along as Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his merry gang of misfits traverse the Misty Mountains and Mines of Moria en route to Mordor for a date with Mount Doom. If you really want to immerse yourself in J.R.R. Tolkien lore, stream the nearly 4-hour-long extended cut. Available on Max\n\nSteven Spielberg’s Martha’s Vineyard-filmed thriller should be on everyone’s summer movie menu each season. Set to celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2025, “Jaws” and its classic score by John Williams have been scaring audiences for decades, keeping beachgoers on their toes and on the lookout for killer sharks. Available on Peacock\n\nAs moviegoers have come to learn over the years: Don’t mess with Liam Neeson. The action-movie mainstay fends off a pack of angry wolves after crash landing in the Alaskan wilderness in “The Grey,” the 2011 survival thriller which also starred veteran actor Dermot Mulroney and frequent Marvel movie collaborator Frank Grillo. In typical Neeson fashion, the Irish actor is a gritty, badass in the movie, fighting off the cold and hungry animals with basically just his wits and his fists. Neeson 1, nature 0. Available on Amazon Prime Video\n\nHawaii is a pretty good vacation destination to escape to after a bad breakup, that is unless your ex is staying at the same resort as you (with a new rockstar boyfriend). Directed by Nicholas Stoller and produced by Judd Apatow, The 2008 comedy “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” stars Jason Segel as Peter, a TV music composer who spirals out of control after his longtime girlfriend Sarah (Kristen Bell) ends their relationship. Both wind up at the same Hawaiian resort, with Segel’s character slowly emerging from his slump thanks to a series of hilarious events as well as the help of Rachel (Mila Kunis), the hotel’s desk clerk and a budding love interest. Available on Max\n\nLike George Costanza saving himself instead of the kids at a birthday party fire, “Force Majeure” tells the tale of a not-so-macho man who earns the ire of his wife after he chooses to save himself instead of his family during an avalanche. Johannes Bah Kuhnke plays Tomas, the cowardly patriarch, while Lisa Loven Kongsli stars as his wife, Ebba, in this dark comedy from director and writer Ruben Östlund. Available on Disney+, Hulu, and Peacock\n\nThis 1966 classic, the final installment of director Sergio Leone’s “Dollars” trilogy, definitely brings the heat. Set in the Southwest amid the Civil War, “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly” follows a trio of gun-slinging bounty hunters (played by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach) who end up fighting over buried Confederate gold. The film has become a fan-favorite spaghetti western over the years thanks in large part to its epic Mexican standoff scene, which will have viewers sweating bullets. Available on Amazon Prime Video, AMC+, and Philo\n\nWhat do you get when you mix winter, the Old West, and the sensibilities of Quentin Tarantino? The answer: “The Hateful Eight.” The 2015 western flick stars Samuel L. Jackson as a Union Army veteran and bounty hunter who, along with seven other questionable characters, seeks shelter in an outpost from a blizzard. The film also stars Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Bruce Dern, Channing Tatum, and Tim Roth. Available on Paramount+ and Showtime"
