        "text": "The spokeswoman at Brigham and Women's hospital said he died at about 0930 local time (1430BST).\n\nQuinn, who appeared in more than 150 feature films, won Oscars as best supporting actor in Viva Zapata in 1952 and as the painter Paul Gauguin in Lust for Life four years later.\n\nHis death was reported by Vincent \"Buddy\" Cianci, a friend of the actor. He said Quinn died of respiratory failure.\n\n\"He was larger than life,\" Cianci said. \"I was proud to call him a friend.\"\n\nPoverty\n\nQuinn was born in Mexico and raised in poverty in East Los Angeles, he went from stage and B-movie roles to become an international leading man.\n\nIn a film career that spanned more than 50 years, Quinn portrayed characters ranging from kings to Indians, including a pope, a boxer and an artist.\n\nHe later concentrated on his other love, art, producing numerous sculptures and paintings.\n\nIrene Nagy Dessewffy, a friend of Quinn who produced art shows and publications featuring his work, said: \"He was motivated by the passion for his art.\n\n\"He was constantly drawing, or constantly writing, or constantly sketching. He never stopped. He was never doing nothing.\"\n\nQuinn's personal life was almost as flamboyant as many of his film parts and he was married twice, the first time to the adopted daughter of Cecil B de Mille.\n\nAlthough his second marriage lasted 20 years, he admitted having affairs and in all fathered 13 children by his wives and mistresses."
