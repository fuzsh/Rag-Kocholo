        "text": "This weekend was projected to be a breather in between massive openings for “Despicable Me 4” (Universal) and “Twisters” (Universal)/“Deadpool and Wolverine” (Disney) the following two weeks. It sort of worked out that way, but not the way it was expected.\n\n“Longlegs” (Neon) and “Fly Me to the Moon” (Sony) were projected to come in second and third this weekend with a combined $30 million-$35 million. That part happened. But Apple’s rom-com with Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum was expected to take second, perhaps at least $15 million (earlier projections higher), while Oz Perkins’ distinctive horror-thriller starring Nicolas Cage was felt to be $10 million or more.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nGuillermo del Toro Praises 'Longlegs': 'A Great Oz Perkins Film' and '100 Percent His Vibe'\n\nJohn Stamos Wants to Innovate the Way You Watch Local News and Weather\n\nInstead, “Longlegs” took second with $22.6 million, while “Fly” is initially placed at $10 million (others have it lower), and only in fifth place. Both are striking results.\n\nWith a budget including marketing under $10 million, “Longlegs” has grossed more in only one weekend than all but two Neon films (“Parasite” and “I, Tonya”) in their entire run. Released on the 25th anniversary of “The Blair Witch Project,” it is close enough in unexpected initial wide returns to take note.\n\n“Blair Witch,” which started the found-footage horror genre and was far and away its high point, opened limited, with in its first wide week grossing the equivalent of over $60 million today to an ultimate adjusted over $300 million. Different times, different result. Both though share the distinction of breaking out in the heart of the summer, with Neon smartly trusting their film and seeing this week offer the potential to stand out. Mission accomplished. It’s even more impressive with so many horror films released regularly and with Cage otherwise starring in new films. Saturday’s gross was above Friday’s (excluding previews), which is a positive sign for word of mouth contrary to the C+ Cinemascore (same as “Blair Witch”).\n\n“Moon” on the other hand is the latest disappointing Apple production to go big theatrically through a top distributor. Costing $100 million before marketing, even with an A- Cinemascore it failed to gain traction, or show momentum through the weekend (its Saturday was under the Friday-only gross).\n\nThe company has multiple films set for release (including “F1” through Warner Bros. next summer). In the absence of any clear sense of the benefit to Apple when later streamed, it remains difficult to make the case for continued theatrical play, and reinforces the sense that Netflix figured this out long ago.\n\nThe sixth film in the “Despicable Me”/”Minions” series made a little under $45 million, which was nearly double any other film this weekend. With its very respectable 40 percent second weekend drop the studio now projects total worldwide grosses of over $5 billion, putting it ahead of any other animated franchise unadjusted for inflation.\n\n“Inside Out 2” (Disney) was third, down only 32 percent. At nearly $573 million, this remains as a possibility to reach “Barbie,” which grossed $636 million last year. “A Quiet Place: Day One” (Paramount), despite competition from “Longlegs,” held well with almost $12 million for fourth.\n\nOverall, five films (if “Moon” does as estimated) did $10 million or better this weekend. That’s healthy, and something that even pre-Covid wasn’t automatic in July (not at all in 2019, then three out of four weekends in 2018). Total box office was about $127 million, down from $140 million last year. Year to date has improved to now off 16 percent from 2023.\n\nA rare mid-summer awards contender hit its marks. “Sing Sing” (A24) with Colman Domingo had a decent four theater (New York/Los Angeles) debut of $137,000 ($34,000 per theater) as it begins its slow rollout. In an unusual move, it is expected to not expand until August in order to build expected word of mouth and avoid competing with the juggernauts the next two weeks. The inspirational, prison-set film isn’t guarantee-specialized fare, so this careful handling seems totally logical.\n\nA series of other respectable limited openings also debuted. “National Anthem” (LD/Variance) did $42,400 in four in New York/Los Angeles locations. Two documentaries opened exclusive in New York, with “Eno” (Film First) taking in $14,446 at the Film Forum. Its presentation includes a slightly different version on different days. “America’s Burning” (Abramorama) $11,325 ($15,450 in four). “Water Brother: The Sid Abbruzzi Story,” self-distributed by its directors, played for two days (two shows only) in Newport, Rhode Island for $12,699 (sold out additional shows mid-week for the documentary will get it to $25,000).\n\nOpening wider, veteran Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur’s “Touch” (Focus) managed $470,000 in 316, while “Dandelion” (IFC) could only claim $65,000 in 446.\n\nThe Top 10\n\n1.
