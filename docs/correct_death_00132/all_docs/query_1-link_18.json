        "text": "Transcript\n\nWILLIAMS: Our celebration, as you can see, celebrated my 64th birthday last month, and I'm working on a new play, \"The Red Devil Battery Sign.\" The stars are Anthony Quinn and Claire Bloom, the director, Ed Sherin, and a great favorite of mine, the Mexican actress Katy Jurado. The first day when the cast assembles for a new production is always an exciting one.\n\nMAN: Quiet, please.\n\nWOMAN: Quiet, keep quiet. Thank you.\n\nMAN: You must have a signed contract and have paid current dues before reporting for rehearsal. As an equity member you cannot waive minimum requirements of the contract. The duties of the actors: pay strict regards to make-up and dress, perform services as reasonably directed to one's best ability, and abide by all reasonable rules and regulations of the manager not to conflict with equity rules.\n\nQUINN: . . . with Tennessee Williams, because he is. I consider him the greatest American playwright of, oh, maybe all times, certainly this century. That, as I say, he's breaking new grounds, and it's very exciting to be in on breaking new grounds and breaking new trails.\n\nWILLIAMS: New Orleans was the first place I went to in America when I really felt free. There was more of an old Greenwich Village quality about the Quarter in those days. I lived, uh, right around the corner from Royal Street, which the streetcar named Desire ran down. Yes, there was an actual streetcar by that name. There was a great deal of fermentation about the theater in the period just after World War II. I was young, and that had a great deal to do with the outburst of plays at that time. I had all of these plays pent up inside of me . . . \"Streetcar,\" \"The Glass Menagerie,\" \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.\" Now a lot of that has been spent, of course, but there's been a period of accumulation. I think most writers prefer a non-urban background for writing because it's less distracting. New Orleans isn't exactly rural, but as you see, I have a very quiet surrounding here. A play evolves slowly. The first draft is just--just fumbling around, exploring the territory, you know. And then the second draft you've got a pretty good idea of where you're going. It's only into the third draft that you're--that you're beginning to fit it all together, get it together, properly in proportion and you know, going into the polishing business. Sometimes there's a fourth and fifth draft.\n\nSo I'm going back to New York to watch a new play evolve, \"The Red Devil Battery Sign.\" I expect that I will be making many changes in \"Red Devil\" as it's rehearsed and even after it's been performed. The action of \"The Red Devil Battery Sign\" takes place in Dallas, Texas, just after the John Kennedy assassination. Anthony Quinn plays King, the leader of a mariachi band, and he becomes involved in a love affair with Claire Bloom, a woman, he meets her downtown hotel. She's simply identified in the play as the Woman Downtown, there being circumstances making it impossible for her to reveal her true name. There's another love story, a young one, going on between Quinn's daughter La Nina, played by Annette Cordona, and a man from Chicago, Terry McCabe. He's played by a fabulous young actor, Steven McHattie.\n\nMCHATTIE: \"What more do you want to know? I went out nights alone, sat alone at bars, then once, in this room, where La Nina . . .\"\n\nSHERIN: \"Then once . . .\"\n\nMC: \"Then once, the room,\" oh, \"I went out nights alone, sat alone at bars, then once, the room where La Nina, I never heard of her before--before the idea existed, but then she performed there . . .\"\n\nSHERIN: See, one of the problems is that they've got to believe that you have the power to take over the joint. The actors are just beginning to contact the work in a personal and nonverbal way. By that I mean they're beginning to experience a set of Tennessee's feelings and are beginning to behave in ways that even surprise them, in nonintellectual ways.\n\nBLOOM: \"King, King . . .\"\n\nQUINN: \"No, love, I tried, I'm trying to speak.\"\n\nB: \"Can you still breathe?\"\n\nQ: \"Yes, still breathing. I started to come downtown, but only got to the drugstore on the corner.\"\n\nB: \"That's alright. I'll come there in a cab. Barman, call me a cab, quick!\" Now cut here. \"Call the cab.\" I want a 9 to 5 cut.\n\nSHERIN: That's right, right!\n\nB: \"Now give me the address. The address! I'll come and get you.\"\n\nQ: \"Now just listen. I've called to tell you good-bye.\"\n\nB: \"I'm going to miss . . .\"\n\nSHERIN: Not at all . . . You've got to use that. Don't take all those--those--those are memories that are wonderful. Give him the shock treatment. Pull him back into reality!\n\nQ: \"A woman like you falls out of decency down so deep that she's finally just an unidentified body.\"\n\nB: \"My body was never identified by anyone but you, and without you will never be identified again.\"\n\nSHERIN: There we go . . .\n\nWILLIAMS: It was Elia Kazan who said to me once, \"You must never speak to actors.\" I once said something to an actress that made her cry, and she cried for so long that he said, \"Oh Tennessee, you must never again speak to an actor,\" and I never do, directly. I always speak just to the director and hope that he will convey my impression, if it is a very strong one, to the actors.\n\nSometimes you'll find a director who manages to intimidate the playwright. It's very easy to do that. But fortunately I have one that wants me to participate.\n\nSHERIN: You can take off your coat, it's awful hot. The--the, see, one of the--can we have quiet in the room, please? One of the problems has been to make \"The Red Devil Battery\" a palpable force--a meaningful force people--that people could connect to the possible conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy, that they could connect to international cartels.\n\nB: Yes, why not?\n\nSHERIN: Alright?\n\nB: Go ahead.\n\nWILLIAMS: I think I'm more of a social writer than Mr. Miller, which would surprise him a great deal. He's more of a polemicist. But I think I have more deeply rooted social beliefs than most directors I know.\n\nB: \"I thought he made some disgustingly common remarks that were a betrayal of porkchop intelligence; pigs and porkers overrun the world. They're all programmed for killing, equipped for it, not for life giving.\"\n\nSHERIN: Right, but the--the speech that begins, \"Something in me.\"\n\nB: Yes.\n\nSHERIN: Now the whole notion of \"Something in me is dead\" is really where I think Tennessee feels is--is--is the--the moral tenor of the world.\n\nWILLIAMS: I think I do have a tendency to pursue basic themes, the position of the sensitive, contraposed to the--the brutal, you know, in life. Southern people are much more emotional and therefore more useful to a playwright who writes emotionally. That's one of the reasons why I use Mexican characters in the play.\n\nJURADO: \"I worked, didn't I work?\"\n\nCORDONA: \"Yeah, never till he fell!\"\n\nJ: \"Oh, you see what was work for me, too! The travel, the packing, and I have no applause for it. Nobody shouts at me bravo, no one calls me ole.\"\n\nC: \"Now you're admitting it, now you're confessing it!\"\n\nJ: \"I tell you like it was!\"\n\nC: \"Not facing me with your eyes.\"\n\nJ: Excuse me. This could happen on the, in the stage. I'll be alright. Okay.\n\nSHERIN: Do you want to start again?\n\nJ: Do you want to pick it up right here?\n\nC: Yes. \"Now you're confessing it, you're admitting it now!\"\n\nJ: \"I tell you like it was!\"\n\nC: \"Not facing me with your eyes.\"\n\nJ: \"Now with eyes I face you. Signs, there were signs. While I worked he worked a crossword puzzle. And at the supper he's still working the puzzle.\" Ai! Eso me fue. Que error!\n\nC: We're only doing it.\n\nJ: Excuse me!\n\nSHERIN: Do you want to start from the beginning? Yeah, let's start from the beginning. Well, I can understand it. I don't like it, but I understand it.\n\nC: Ready?\n\nSHERIN: Action.\n\nC: \"Mama, you are lying to me. Puras mentiras. There had to be signs, something you noticed!\"\n\nJ: \"I worked, didn't I work?\"\n\nC: \"Yeah, never till he fell.\"\n\nJ: \"I tell you like it was.\"\n\nC: \"Not facing me with your eyes.\"\n\nJ: \"Now with eyes I face you. Signs, there were signs. While I worked, he worked a crossword puzzle. And when I come to make supper, he's still working the puzzle. And after dinner, the fork would slip from his fingers.\"\n\nC: \"Then it's too late to fight over what's left of him, now. At least you've admitted the truth.\"\n\nSHERIN: That's very nice.\n\nJ: Gracias.\n\nSHERIN: . . . one of the good things . . . But it is good . . . it's improved immensely--immensely, your passion was always there.\n\nWILLIAMS: The director, Ed Sherin, went to California to find a suitable actress for the part of King's daughter.\n\nCORDONA: One of the reasons I agreed to do this show and come from Los Angeles, not only because of the opportunity of working on--on a Broadway stage eventually, was because I had never done an acting role that was so demanding, and I thought, \"What an opportunity to be directed,\" meaning someone will find things in me that no one's been able to find before and that I surely can't do by myself. You know? Coming from a lot of musicals, I knew the potential was there. I just wanted someone to help me bring it out. I come from 15 years of dancing and have performed for many audiences and many types of audiences, different cultures, so right there I'm able to express a lot of love and communication, which I use in this part. And I use that because if I had just come out to do a dance, let's say, it wouldn't of made any sense in this show. I could have danced 50 turns and fabulous but it wouldn't make any sense to the story, and no one would appreciate it.\n\nWOMAN: Great! Great!\n\n[Music in]\n\nWILLIAMS: One of the coproducers of the play, Robert Colby, is also the musical director. He works for Sidney Lippman, the composer.\n\nMAN: This is Anthony Quinn's theme that's used in \"The Red Devil Battery Sign\" [music out]. When I was very young, I lived in the French Quarter in New Orleans for a bit, and I met Tennessee Williams, just to say hello. But I didn't realize that at that moment he was writing \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" And just last year, I was in London producing a play, and I was asked to help with the music to, for the production that Claire Bloom, who's in our play, was doing \"A Streetcar.\" And I told Claire Bloom that and Claire Bloom said \"my goodness, move over a little closer, it's like knowing somebody was there when Shakespeare wrote something.\"\n\nQUINN: Williams has a fantastic ear. He has--he has rhythms, I mean, he has the modern rhythm . . . for instance, the last one that had that kind of rhythm was Clifford Odets, when he was writing back in 1936, 1937. He had the American rhythm at--at that time. And then, for a while, I think that Arthur Miller had the modern rhythm of the 40s and early 50s. I think Williams has gone on. I've known Tennessee Williams since 1945, and I find that he's kept up. And the magnificent thing to deal with Williams and the thing that you have to find is the rhythm of his language and to be true to it. Once you drop away from the rhythm of Tennessee, you're in trouble. And I notice that when one tries to ad lib, because you feel that a piece of mucilage is missing, your language is never as good as Tennessee's.\n\nB: \"King, King . . .\"\n\nQ: \"Love, I'm--I'm--I'm trying to speak . . .\"\n\nB: \"Why I hear your breath? Tonight I won't say one word that isn't right for a lady to say, I swear. We have to go, but we have to go together.\"\n\nQ: \"Love, I--I--I can't make it downtown.\"\n\nB: \"Oh, but you can, and you will.\"\n\nQ: \"The drugstore man has called the ambulance. They're coming to take me away. To drill through my skull, to cut at the flower, to prune it. And what will be left? An imbecile.\"\n\nB: \"Don't you hang up on me. Don't you dare hang up on me. I'll take you to my room at the Yellow Rose. I'll be an unidentified female body mutilated beyond recognition back of a truck in an alley if you don't tell me where . . .\"\n\nQ: \"Good-bye love, much--much love.\"\n\nSHERIN: I'm really pleased. I think we're ready to go on with the play.\n\nWILLIAMS: This is the Boston try out, the first public performance of \"Red Devil Battery Sign.\" An opening on the road enables the writer to measure the pace of the play, and it gives the actors a chance to feel the reactions of a live audience. It's a time of testing for everyone.\n\n[Music, chatter]\n\nWILLIAMS: I think if they're good actors, they rise above the ego, you know, when they're on stage. They're--they're conscious of a--a concerted effort to hold that audience out there.\n\nQ: Well, this is the old bullfighter . . .\n\nMAN: Okay.\n\nQ: Bullfighters do this. A bullfighter, when he comes out into the ring, if he can spit, he's not going to be good that day. Because bullfighters are only good when they're scared. My expression of scared means that I have a sense of responsibility. Not that I'm--not that I'm frightened, I'm not frightened of success or failure. I think that the fear will transfer itself into a feeling of being concerned.\n\n\". . . armed. I'm armed. You're armed. Come on, come on, talk!\"\n\nMC: \"Look, can't we all just sit down without a knife pointed at me. Can't we all just sit down?\"\n\nQ: \"There's no room. No room in the room. Just standing room only, with La Nina singing. Presenting the star!\"\n\n[Music]\n\nJ: \"You think it was no work for me, too? The trouble, the packing. And I have no applause for it. Nobody shouts at me bravo, no one calls me ole.\"\n\nC: \"Now you're confessing. Now you're admitting it now!\"\n\nJ: \"I tell you like it was!\"\n\nC: \"Not facing me with your eyes.\"\n\nJ: \"Now with eyes I face you. Signs, there were signs. While I worked, he worked at the crossword puzzle. And when I come home to make supper, he's still working the puzzle.\"\n\nB: \"He's hung up! He took so long to call me. He's hung up! King! King!\"\n\nQ: \"I'm trying, I'm--I'm trying.\"\n\n[Applause]\n\nWOMAN: Like anyone who loves theater, thank God Tennessee Williams wrote another play--one of our few living dramatic geniuses. And \"The Red Devil Battery Sign,\" playing at the Shubert--like most of his plays--is too dense, too complex to explain in simple terms, especially when it still needs pruning and internal deciphering of its own circles and symbols. But after so much dramatic dribble, I'll take premature impressions to substance anytime. He takes on two fabrics of Texas through a woman called \"Downtown Woman\" who mumbles on and on and on and on about the Kennedy assassination, surveillance plots and hence of her own involvement with industrial and political maniacal powers. But with Claire Bloom in the role, she is too much the poet when she needs to be the predator. Bloom, a fine actress, is trapped by too many words, too much melodrama. Her human object is King, a band leader dying of a brain tumor. Anthony Quinn is brilliant, and Broadway has a new star in Annette Cordona, who plays his daughter [music]. For the rest of the cast, Katy Jurado, the nagging wife, and Steven McHattie as McCabe, the daughter's lover, are just like sketches, mouthpieces for various sociological tirades. And the play does talk too much about everything. But it's beautifully dramatic in places. It's always interesting. It may be difficult but it is definitely the work of a great playwright. But it is a work in progress that needs more resolution.\n\nJ: And there's a lack in this play of a real atmosphere of what Mr. Tennessee Williams wants in this play. The audience they don't know how much we suffered tonight, suffered in a way. Tonight we're here, not celebrating, no, to come here just to relax a little. Because we have month and a half without one day of a free day, Sunday or Saturday. Even the Bible says you have to have one day. Actors have no one day free.\n\nSHERIN: We have just opened Wednesday night. This is Sunday of our first half week. To be a little humane to ourselves and realize that. And I have to remind myself of that because I'm under a lot of pressure from different quarters to make it work. It's a time of--of a need for patience and understanding, even compassion. It's important, not only on the part of the director for the actors, but on the part of each actor for each other. We have to examine openly and without fear and without defensiveness everything we are doing in the play and every direction that you've been given by me. And, if--if the period is moved through successfully, it's a time when great love can be established between the actors, the directors . . .\n\nMC: Da-da-da-da-dum! Yes! The microcosmos!\n\nSHERIN: I know, this is heavy and it's true and that's what it is. It is a microcosmos.\n\nMC: It's not the idea I'm objecting. It's the word. It's saying \"microcosmos.\"\n\nSHERIN: The microcosmos is the small world.\n\nMC: I'm--I'm familiar with the word . . .\n\nSHERIN: I understand that.\n\nMC: I mean, idea.\n\nSHERIN: But, I mean, how else? But do you feel that Terry McCabe would say \"microcosmos\"? If he understands the issue?\n\nMC: Not without people in the audience laughing, it's . . .\n\nSHERIN: I haven't heard any laughter . . .\n\nMC: Well, I have.\n\nSHERIN: . . . and I've been in the middle of the audience, or maybe it's because you're backing off from it. Maybe you're saying, well here it comes. Da-da-da-da-da-dum. Microcosmos. Now, Mac, you've got to give yourself a chance to get to that because that word has been a harbinger of bad feelings in you since the first time you spoke it. It takes a long time. Give it a chance. When the part deepens for you, the word will deepen for you. This is for Monday night's performance. Everything that goes down here is going to be played on Monday night.\n\nQ: \"Alright, stay. Man needed, not dead, but living in Crestview. Dump heap, world!\"\n\nMC: \"Yes, a microcosmos.\"\n\nWILLIAMS: If you believe in the play, you just keep working. Even as the performance continues, you keep rewriting and the actors keep rehearsing what you've re-written. I think you discover things that seem to work on the printed page are not working in the presence of an audience, even the very best audience that you want--that you could hope for. And then you adjust, you know, because you have to. When the writer makes adjustments on a play, he works closely with the director. The final scene, a death scene between Quinn and Bloom, is particularly important.\n\nSHERIN: How does that sound?\n\nWILLIAMS: Good. I think I got a good speech for her, there.\n\nB: \"A red devil jiggling a pitchfork to assert his dominion over the dignified silence of God.\"\n\nQ: That's wonderful.\n\nB: \"Yes, I did say God, in whom my heart still so helplessly believes.\"\n\nSHERIN: Alright, let's try it now.\n\nB: \"No, hold it. What is it now but a tacky neon sign stuck on top of the tallest building, a red devil jiggling a pitchfork to assert his dominion, which . . . no, it doesn't exist. That's just his cry of conquest. Accident: malign. Enemy flag elevated over the well-kept secrets of God. Yes, I did say God, in whom my heart still fervently believes. Did I ever tell him that? Tried. But tongue fails language. Only the eyes unhooded can still speak a little. When he looked in my eyes, objected to drunkenness of self-destruction and pity of self. So, obligation, responsibility to him, man, more than man, is for me to endure. Comforted by his King's Men, playing still.\"\n\nSHERIN: It is possible for her, still keeping an emotional touch with his dead body, to move into the summary images that can end the play, to lift him up into a processional and to create her intense needs is to create two objects . . .\n\nWILLIAMS: . . . they're fighting each other.\n\nSHERIN: They're killing each other. There is no way. So what happened yesterday? She played the whole scene on her knees, so that the two objects were merged. And then what I perceived as possible is that the mariachi come over and just straighten the body out, and La Nina ends it with a savage flamenco dance, and then we bring the curtain down.\n\n[Music in]\n\nB: \"Come! Come! No!\"\n\nMAN: \"Lady, please.\"\n\n[Applause]\n\nC: I knew the potential was there, I just wanted someone to help me bring it out.\n\nJ: This play is great enough to do it again, and I hope to do it in my Mexico.\n\nB: I feel exactly the same. I just pray that there's a chance for this play to be heard properly because it has some magnificent things to say.\n\nQ: I think that Tennessee Williams has at his age and his state of his development given us a summation of his life in this play.\n\nWILLIAMS: There's a certain magic in what happens in the immediate presence of the actor and the immediate presence of the audience. Things on screen can be edited out, but you can't edit a live performance. That gives it a certain unpredictable quality. And that sense of the spontaneous is to me the very essence of the experience we call theater.\n\n[Music out]"
