        "text": "Anthony Quinn was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, in 1915, during the Mexican revolution, in which his father was allegedly a soldier in the army of Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa. After the revolution, the family moved to Los Angeles, California, where Quinn's father eventually secured a job as a cameraman at Selig Film Studios. Quinn often accompanied his father to work, and became acquainted with such stars as Tom Mix and John Barrymore, with whom he kept up the friendship into adulthood. Quinn's first job in Hollywood was tending animals at the Selig Studio. Quinn's father died when Anthony was 9 years old. He grew up in East Los Angeles, shining shoes and selling newspapers. For extra cash, he entered dance contests and sold the statues he won.\n\nHad five children, Christopher Quinn (born October 27, 1938 - died March 15, 1941), Christina Quinn (born December 1, 1941), Catalina Quinn (born November 21, 1942), Duncan Quinn (born August 4, 1945) and Valentina Quinn (born December 26, 1952), with Katherine DeMille. Had three children, Francesco Quinn (born March 22, 1963 - died August 5, 2011), Danny Quinn (born April 16, 1964) and Lorenzo Quinn (born May 7, 1966), with Jolanda Addolori. Had two children, Sean Quinn (born February 7, 1973) and Alex A. Quinn (born December 30, 1976), with Friedel Dunbar and had two children, Antonia Quinn (born July 23, 1993) and Ryan Quinn (born July 5, 1996), with Kathy Benvin.\n\nBecame a naturalized United States citizen in 1947, just before he was \"gray-listed\" for his association with Communists such as screenwriter John Howard Lawson and what were termed \"fellow travelers\", though he himself was never called before the House Un-American Activities Committee. When warned of his gray-listing by 20th Century-Fox boss Darryl F. Zanuck (a liberal), Quinn decided to go on the Broadway stage where there was no blacklist rather than go through the process of refuting the suspicions.\n\nHe was one of the few actors to move easily and successfully between starring and supporting roles throughout his career. In both categories, the Irish-Mexican Quinn played a vast array of characters and ethnicities, including American, Arab, Basque, Chinese, English, French, Greek, Hawaiian, Hebrew, Hun, Irish, Italian, Mexican, Mongol, Native American, Filipino, Portuguese, Spaniard and Ukrainian.\n\nAccording to Joseph McBride's Searching for John Ford (St. Martin's Press, 2001 - ISBN 0312242328), director John Ford was urged to cast Richard Boone and Quinn as the Little Wolf and Dull Knife characters in Cheyenne (1964), as both allegedly had Native American blood. Ricardo Montalban and Gilbert Roland, who were of Mexican ancestry, were cast instead.\n\nMaintained a friendship with Pancho Villa's widow, Doña María Luz Corral, with whom Quinn frequently visited at her home in Chihuahua City, La Casa de Villa (later the Historical Museum of the Revolution) and provided economic support through the years. A photo of Quinn and Corral hangs in the museum.\n\nIn later years, he would recount how, while growing up in Echo Park, young Chicano toughs would come over to his house to enlist his help in brawling with the Irish gangs, and that later in the same day, young Irish bruisers would visit him to enlist his services in fighting the Mexicans. He would always beg off choosing sides by having his mother chase the young delinquents out of her house, after which he would resume one of his favorite pastimes, drafting and drawing.\n\nUsed to be friends with Jackie Onassis but since making the film \"Greek Tycoon\" she hasn't spoken to him despite the fact that when Onassis was alive he said for Quinn to do the film.\n\nLike Charlie Chaplin and Steve Martin, Quinn was one of very few celebrities to have children very late in life. He was 78 years old when a son was born in 1993, and 81 years old when his youngest son was born in 1996."
