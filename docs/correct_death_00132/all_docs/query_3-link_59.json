But some may not know that Anthony was also a gifted and prolific artist and art collector. His art was not limited to any specific medium, he loved oil painting, woodworking, sculptures and more.\nIn this episode of Your History Your Story, our guest is Anthony Quinn’s widow, Kathy Quinn. Kathy will share stories from the life of her husband that will include his humble beginnings in Chihuahua, Mexico, his move to the United States as a young boy and his fascinating acting career with highlights from some of his key movie roles. Kathy will also talk about her late husband’s deep passion for art, learning and observing people and things in his environment.\nIn 2007, Kathy began the Anthony Quinn Foundation to honor her husband’s memory and his love for the arts by providing scholarships for high school students who wish to attend a recognized, pre-college or summer intensive art education program.\n\nMusic: \"With Loved Ones\" Jay Man \nPhoto(s): Credit to James Udell\nSupport Your History Your Story: \nPlease consider becoming a Patron or making a one time donation via PayPal. - THANK YOU!!! \nYHYS Patreon: ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠CLICK HERE⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ \nYHYS PayPal: ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠CLICK HERE⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ \nYHYS: Social Links: ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠CLICK HERE⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ \nYHYS: Join our mailing list: ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠CLICK HERE⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ \n#yhys #yourhistoryyourstory #history #storytelling #podcast #njpodcast #youhaveastorytoo #jamesgardner \n\nTo learn more about this episode, check the links below:\nwww.AnthonyQuinnFoundation.org \nwww.AQFoundation.org\n⁠⁠⁠\nSimilar stories of interest or time period:\nS5 Ep10 Primo Carnera, Boxing Champion and Gentle Giant\nhttps://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/yourhistoryyourstory/episodes/S5-Ep10-Primo-Carnera--Boxing-Champion-and-Gentle-Giant-e1j7voj\n\nS7 Ep 06 A Passion for Presidential History\nhttps://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/yourhistoryyourstory/episodes/S7-Ep06-Presidential-Friendships-How-They-Changed-History-e1vs52b",

But, have you ever thought about the different types of food of the Gilded Age, and how it was prepared and presented?\n\nIn this episode of Your History Your Story, we will be speaking with Becky Diamond, food writer, research historian and author of the book, “The Gilded Age Cookbook: Recipes and Stories from America’s Golden Era”.

In 1780 Arnold, who was then the commander of West Point, a strategic American fort on the Hudson River during the Revolutionary War, handed over military secrets to a British spy named Major Andre.\n\nHowever, Andre was captured and Arnold’s treasonous act was discovered. While Andre was tried and hanged by the Americans, Arnold was able to escape and eventually fight for the British against his former comrades.\n\nAlthough, widely known as a traitor, many people don’t know that prior to defecting to the British, Arnold, who had risen to the rank of Major General, had fought bravely and with great distinction for the American Continental Army and had been one of General George Washington’s most valued officers.\n\nIn this episode of Your History Your Story, we will be speaking with award winning author and historian, Jack Kelly about his new book, “God Save Benedict Arnold: The True Story of America’s Most Hated Man”.

At just two and a half months old, Jake suddenly stopped breathing and was rushed to the hospital. The following day, Holly and her husband were told the devastating news that their baby was not going to survive. In their grief, they wanted to give their son a legacy and help others, so the selfless decision to donate Jake’s heart was made.\n\nDuring this same time period and nearly 1,000 miles away, Kim Scadlock gave birth to her son, Beckham. Beckham seemed healthy at birth, but soon medical staff discovered he was struggling to breathe. After tests were done, Kim and her husband were told Beckham’s only chance to survive was to receive a heart transplant.\n\nThankfully, Jake’s heart was a match for Beckham and the transplant took place. Afterward, while both families were in the process of grieving and healing, they thought of each other often, although they did not know each other’s identity. Through the organ donor networks, the families were eventually able to contact each other and in 2010, Holly, Kim and their families met for the very first time at the Transplant Games in Wisconsin.\n\nThirteen years later in 2023, Holly and Kim were invited to performed the song “For Good” from the musical, “Wicked” on the popular television show, America’s Got Talent. “For Good” has a special meaning for Holly as it was the last song she was able to sing to Jake before he passed and also special for Kim, as it was the first song she sang to Beckham after he received his new heart.\n\nIn this episode of Your History Your Story, Holly and Kim will share their story of love, friendship and the importance of life saving organ donation.\n\nMusic: \"With Loved Ones\" Jay Man\n\nPhoto(s) and songs: Courtesy of Holly Campbell and Kim Scadlock\n\n⁠Click here to learn more about organ donation\n\nSupport Your History Your Story:\n\nPlease consider becoming a Patron or making a one time donation via PayPal. - THANK YOU!!!\n\nYHYS Patreon: CLICK HERE\n\nYHYS PayPal: CLICK HERE\n\nYHYS: Social Links: CLICK HERE\n\nYHYS: Join our mailing list: CLICK HERE\n\n#yhys #yourhistoryyourstory #history #storytelling #podcast #njpodcast #youhaveastorytoo #jamesgardner\n\nThomas Smallwood was born into slavery in Maryland in 1801. Smallwood, a shoemaker, later moved to Washington DC where, at age 30, he was able to purchase his freedom. While living in Washington, he witnessed the day to day activities of slave traders who were involved in selling enslaved blacks into the Deep South, where they would work on cotton and sugar plantations. The domestic slave trade often permanently separated wives from husbands and children from parents.\n\nIn this environment in which both enslaved and free blacks were fearful of being sold south, Smallwood became determined to take action to help people to escape north to Canada, where they would be safe from slave hunters seeking to return them to their enslavers.\n\nSmallwood, who was self educated, eventually teamed up with a much younger, Yale educated, white abolitionist from Massachusetts named Charles Torrey. Together, the two men created what may have been the first Underground Railroad that ran through Washington DC, helping many to escape being sold south. In addition to facilitating escapes,Smallwood became a prolific writer and taunted slave traders through articles he wrote that were published in northern newspapers.\n\nIn this episode of Your History Your Story, we will be speaking with author and Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, Scott Shane. Scott will share exciting stories from his recently released book, “Flee North: A Forgotten Hero and the Fight for Freedom in Slavery’s Borderland”.\n\n“Flee North” tells the story of Smallwood, Torrey and their fight against the domestic slave trade in the 1840’s.\n\nMusic: \"With Loved Ones\" Jay Man\n\nPhoto(s) and songs: Courtesy of Scott Shane\n\nScott Shane website\n\nSupport Your History Your Story:\n\nPlease consider becoming a Patron or making a one time donation via PayPal. - THANK YOU!!!\n\nYHYS Patreon: CLICK HERE\n\nYHYS PayPal: CLICK HERE\n\nYHYS: Social Links: CLICK HERE\n\nYHYS: Join our mailing list: CLICK HERE\n\n#yhys #yourhistoryyourstory #history #storytelling #podcast #njpodcast #youhaveastorytoo #jamesgardner\n\nDuring the first months of World War II, in anticipation of bombing raids and a possible invasion by Hitler’s Germany, the British government ordered the evacuation of children from London and other cities that might become potential targets. The effort was dubbed “Operation Pied Piper” resulting in hundreds of thousands of children being evacuated to rural areas of the country.\n\nTwo such children were Jack Frisby, age 11 and his brother Terry, age 7. One day in 1940, Jack and Terry were placed on a train in London by their mother, along with many of their classmates and other neighborhood children, bound for a small village in Cornwall, England. Once in Cornwall, they were to be placed with an unknown host family.\n\nJack and Terry’s mother, who clearly desired to keep her boys safe from the bombings in London, was also concerned about their well-being in a household of strangers. Therefore, she came up with a special code for her boys to use once they arrived at their destination. The code was in the form of kisses on a postcard that they would send home. The number of kisses would let her know if they were happy and safe, just okay or sad and maybe in danger. Thankfully, the boys loved their temporary home and smothered their postcard with many kisses.\n\nTerry Frisby survived the war and went on to become a famous playwright and actor who wrote a book and an award winning BBC radio play telling the story of his four year experience as an evacuee during WWII.\n\nIn this episode of Your History Your Story, we will be speaking with author, comedian and financial commentator, Dominic Frisby.

Since passable roads were scarce at that time, it became necessary to develop a transportation system that would enable the movement of goods across inland routes.\n\nThe canal system was a man-made waterway, where boats and barges powered by mules would transport freight to various markets along a specific route. One of those canals, called the Morris Canal, stretched 102 miles across the rugged landscape of Northern New Jersey from Phillipsburg on the Delaware River to Newark & later to the New York Harbor at Jersey City.\n\nConstruction of the Morris Canal began in 1825 and first opened for business in 1831. The canal was used to carry large quantities of coal from eastern Pennsylvania and also iron, lumber, agricultural and home goods to the east coast cities and points in between. Bloomfield, in Essex County New Jersey was one the communities through which the Morris Canal passed. For many years that town experienced benefits including, commercial and population growth, until the railroads brought about the closure of the canal in the early 20th century.\n\nIn this episode of Your History Your Story, we will be speaking with Bloomfield Councilman, Rich Rockwell. Rich, who is a council liaison to both the Morris Canal Greenway Committee and the Historic Preservation Commission, is also a trustee of the Historical Society of Bloomfield and author of the book, “Bloomfield Through Time”. He will talk about the history of the Morris Canal, including its engineering features, its affect on day to day life and its ultimate abandonment in 1924 after nearly 100 years of operation.\n\nRich will also tell of the efforts made in his community and the state of New Jersey to preserve the rich history of the Morris Canal.

The expedition’s mission was to conduct geographical and scientific exploration in an area lying between Alaska and the North Pole.\n\nThe leader of the expedition was Vilhjalmur Stefansson, a Canadian born anthropologist, who had already spent several years studying the Inuit people (Eskimos) in arctic Canada. Stefansson had selected experienced arctic mariner, Robert Bartlett as Captain of the Karluk. Sadly, shortly into its’ journey, the Karluk became trapped in ice on its way to a rendezvous point with the other two ships.\n\nMonths later, the ship was crushed by the surrounding ice and the small crew and passengers struggled to survive for months in the punishing arctic weather. Nearly half of the people onboard would not survive.\n\nIn this episode of Your History Your Story, we will be speaking with Buddy Levy, journalist and author of eight books, the most recent one being, “Empire of Ice and Stone: The disastrous and Heroic Voyage of the Karluk”.\n\nBuddy was also the co-star for twenty five episodes on History Channel’s hit docuseries, “Brad Meltzer’s Decoded”.\n\nBuddy will tell stories of the ill-fated Karluk and of the bravery and determination of its’ passengers and crew.

Thorpe who was predominantly of Native American descent, was a member of the Sac & Fox Nation. However, his father who had some European blood, felt that it was important for his son to attend school and assimilate into the English speaking culture.\n\nAfter a series of tragic personal losses, including the death of his twin brother and his mother, Thorpe was eventually sent away to school by his father who wished for him to get an education. Despite his hopes of staying home and his general dislike for school, Thorpe eventually traveled to Pennsylvania, where he attended the Carlisle Indian School. It was there that his extraordinary athletic ability was first noticed.\n\nThorpe went on to excel in many different sports, including baseball, football and track & field. He attended the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden where he won two gold medals for the pentathlon and the decathlon, becoming the first Native American to win a gold medal for the United States. Sadly, those medals were later rescinded when it was discovered that Thorpe had briefly played for a minor league baseball team for a small amount of money. In 1982, almost thirty years after his death, his gold medals were restored to his family. However, Thorpe remained listed in the record books as co-winner of those events.\n\nIn this episode of Your History Your Story, we will be speaking with Jim Kossakowski, the great grandson of Jim Thorpe. Jim will share stories from the life of one of America’s most iconic athletes and will also share what it is like to be descended from the legendary Jim Thorpe.\n\nAfter the interview….\n\nPlease note that in July of 2022, shortly after the recording of this interview, The International Olympic Committee restored Jim Thorpe’s name as the sole gold medal winner of pentathlon and decathlon events at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm.\n\nMusic: \"With Loved Ones\" Jay Man\n\nPhoto(s): Courtesy of Jim Kossakowski\n\n#yhys #yourhistoryyourstory #history #JimThorpe #athlete #olympic #stockholm #1912 #jamesgardner #youhaveastorytoo #podcast #njpodcast\n\nAs we enter the 2022 Christmas season, many of us will be decorating our homes, purchasing gifts, listening to our favorite holiday music and settling our plans to visit and celebrate with friends and loved ones.\n\nHowever, as we busy ourselves with many activities of the season, we should pause to remember Christmas’ from long ago and reflect upon how those memories and traditions from our childhood remain in our hearts and still bring us comfort and joy today.\n\nIn this episode of Your History Your Story, we will be speaking with friends from around the world who will share their special childhood memories and Christmas traditions from their home countries.

Little did they know that just prior to Desiree’s thirty first birthday, while she was studying to become a doctor, she would be diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. Robert walked hand in hand with her throughout her journey and their love for each other continued to grow. They had an action plan that compelled them to make the most out of every day they had together. Sadly, despite her strong will to live and immeasurable courage, Desiree lost her battle with cancer and Robert was devastated.\n\nTrying to find his way again, he leaned into some of the coping skills he developed as a child and the experiences he had during his wife’s illness to transform his life.
