        "text": "Read\n\nJune 14, 2022\n\nAnthony Quinn’s The Original Sin is an absorbing memoir that covers the period of his childhood to his breakthrough into movies in the ‘30s. The book is excellent, but makes one thing clear: we need an exhaustive biography about this complex, fascinating Mexican-American actor who made nearly 200 films throughout his 70-year career. That there are few resources available on him is a shame. What a loss for film buffs.\n\nThe memoir uses a narrative device of psychiatric visits to explore his personal life and career. The first third of the book details the story of his parents who were Mexican Revolutionaries that fought with Pancho Villa’s army. Quinn himself was conceived on a train ride toward one of the war’s many battles. After being pursued by political enemies, the Quinns eventually fled to the United States and ended up in California.\n\nThe second section of the book concerns Quinn‘s poverty-stricken childhood and his struggles to support his family after his father’s sudden death. Quinn had a variety of jobs, such as newspaper boy, shoeshine boy, boxer, painter, foreman, when he discovered his passion for architecture. It was during one of his meetings with mentor Frank Lloyd Wright where he was given the advice to take vocal lessons to improve his diction and speech patterns.\n\n“You have to be able to enunciate your ideas and philosophy,” said Wright. “[Your future employees] are not going to listen to you if you don’t sound clipped and decisive.”\n\nQuinn took acting lessons and discovered he had a talent for this profession. He easily impressed his teachers. And despite his ethnicity, opportunities and auditions started pouring in.\n\nMae West happened to see the 21-year-old Quinn accompanying a friend at an audition and, was so taken with his presence, suggested him for a lead role in a stage play.\n\nThe notices and reviews for that play led to big opportunities, particularly playing small gangster roles in movies.\n\nOne humorous anecdote involves Quinn passing himself off as a fluent Cheyenne Native American in an audition for the unsuspecting Cecil B. DeMille (his future father-in-law) with the help of Gary Cooper who was in on the ruse.\n\nAnd another story of how Quinn once failed to show up on a date with Carole Lombard because, as a struggling actor, he had no money. After being subjected to “a blast of obscene language” by “the worst tongue in the world,” Quinn explained the situation and got both a second date and a close friend.\n\nThe memoir’s device of the psychiatrist allows Quinn to unpack his struggles reconciling his professional success with his disastrous personal life. Having been in several failed relationships and struggling to express his affection toward his children, the book’s title The Original Sin refers to Quinn’s inability to receive and give love to those closest to him.\n\nThe revealing nature of the book is surprising in its frankness and openness regarding the messier parts of his life, including the death of his first-born son. When Quinn wrote the memoir in 1972, he was in a position to paint a simpler picture of his journey into acting, but he isn’t afraid to lay bare the emotional turmoil that haunted and prevented him from developing intimate relationships.\n\nIt’s a rare look into the life of a Mexican-American actor building his career and the emotional toll that career had later in his life. He would soon win two Oscars and have many peaks in his life; those future events aren’t covered here, just an older actor looking back at his youth.\n\nBut perhaps one day we will have a fuller text to explore all the areas of this extraordinary life. One can hope.\n\nJune 2, 2017\n\nAfter reading an ARC of Glenn Harte's book The Prophetic Imagery of Anthony Quinn: A Study of Surrealism and Precognitive Art, I was curious about Mr. Quinn's metaphysical experiences, and acquired this 1972 memoir to read. Well, I'm afraid all the physical experiences of Mr. Quinn, along with all the profanity, made this book a stop-read. Really, I couldn't go on. It's as self-indulgent as a memoir can be, and is apparently one long account of the actor's therapy sessions, where he's trying to figure out why he's not happy. A third of the way through, I reached the point of not being able to care less why he was unhappy. The ghost boy in the story, which is what I was so interested in at first, is mostly a snarling, mocking lad. He appears to be Anthony Quinn himself, constantly taunting himself. Of course. What can we expect from such a self-indulgent book? Everything in the world is about Anthony Quinn and his unhappiness about his seemingly successful life."
