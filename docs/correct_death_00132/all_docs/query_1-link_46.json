Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.\n\nüö® Headlines\n\n‚öæÔ∏è Blockbuster trade: The Orioles acquired 2021 NL Cy Young winner Corbin Burnes from the Brewers in exchange for infield prospect Joey Ortiz and lefty flamethrower D.L. Hall. What a week to be an O's fan!\n\nüèéÔ∏è Hamilton to Ferrari: In a stunning move, Ferrari announced Thursday that Lewis Hamilton will leave Mercedes and join the team in 2025. Hamilton, 39, has the most wins in F1 history and is tied with Michael Schumacher for the most championships.\n\nüèÄ Embiid injury: Joel Embiid has a meniscus injury in his left knee. Barring a quick return, he's likely out of the running for MVP because he won't play the required 65 games. In happier Sixers news, Tyrese Maxey dropped 51 in a win over the Jazz.\n\nüèà Quinn to Washington: The Commanders have hired Cowboys DC Dan Quinn as their next head coach, filling the NFL's last vacancy.\n\nüèà Father and son: In other coaching news, the Browns are allowing offensive line coach Bill Callahan out of his contract so that he can join his son, Brian, in Tennessee, where he was recently named head coach.\n\nüèí NHL at the break\n\nNHL All-Star Weekend has arrived, providing an opportunity to take stock of the season's first half, Jeff writes.\n\nPlayoff picture: If the postseason began today, the division-leading Bruins (Atlantic), Rangers (Metropolitan), Canucks (Pacific) and Avalanche (Central) would headline the following first-round matchups.\n\nEast: Bruins vs. Red Wings, Rangers vs. Maple Leafs, Panthers vs. Lightning, Hurricanes vs. Flyers\n\nWest: Canucks vs. Blues, Avalanche vs. Kings, Stars vs. Jets, Golden Knights vs. Oilers\n\nThree up:\n\nBruins: Boston won't match its historic output from last season, when it won a record 65 games, but the B's 71 points are still tied for the league lead as they seek to become the first team since the Capitals in 2016-17 to win consecutive Presidents' Trophies.\n\nCanucks: After missing three straight postseasons, and seven of the last eight, Vancouver is tied with Boston for the league's best record and leads all teams in goal differential (+59). And Wednesday's trade for All-Star center Elias Lindholm made it clear they're going all in.\n\nOilers: Since beginning the year an abysmal 5-12-1, Edmonton has won an astonishing 24 of its last 27 games and is currently on a 16-game winning streak, one shy of tying the longest in NHL history (1992-93 Penguins).\n\nThree down:\n\nBlackhawks: Chicago has lost a franchise-record 20 consecutive road games, the longest such streak by any team in 31 years. And their lone bright spot, rookie sensation Connor Bedard, is out at least another month with a broken jaw.\n\nSharks: San Jose is on pace for a -148 goal differential, which would be the worst mark in the last 30 years and the 11th-worst ever. And they'll likely only get worse after selling off parts at the deadline.\n\nIslanders: They banked enough wins early to still be alive in the playoff race, but the past six weeks have been brutal. They've won just six of their last 21 games and parted ways with second-year head coach Lane Lambert.\n\nMVP race: Five guys lead the way as clear betting favorites for the Hart Memorial Trophy (odds via BetMGM).\n\nNathan MacKinnon, COL (-135): Will he finally get his hardware after five top-6 finishes since 2018? His 84 points (31 G, 53 A) rank second this season.\n\nNikita Kucherov, TB (+300): The 2019 MVP leads the league with 85 points (32 G, 53 A).\n\nConnor McDavid, EDM (+400): The reigning (and three-time) MVP has 67 points (20 G, 47 A), tied for fourth in the league.\n\nAuston Matthews, TOR (+1300): The 2022 MVP is on pace for the first 70-goal season since 1993.\n\nDavid Pastr≈à√°k, BOS (+1600): Last year's runner-up trails only Kucherov and MacKinnon with 72 points (33 G, 39 A).\n\nICYMI: Captains picked their teams in Thursday's All-Star player draft\n\nüèÄ NBA All-Star reserves announced\n\nThe NBA unveiled the East and West All-Star reserves on Thursday ahead of the All-Star Game on Feb. 18 in Indianapolis.\n\nHow it works: The game is returning to its original East vs. West format, meaning for the first time since 2017 there won't be a draft. LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo are still captains after receiving the most fan votes for their respective conferences, but their teams are already set.\n\nEast starters:\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo (Bucks)\n\nJoel Embiid (76ers)\n\nJayson Tatum (Celtics)\n\nDamian Lillard (Bucks)\n\nTyrese Haliburton (Pacers)\n\nReserves: Jaylen Brown (Celtics), Donovan Mitchell (Cavaliers), Jalen Brunson (Knicks), Bam Adebayo (Heat), Julius Randle (Knicks), Tyrese Maxey (76ers), Paolo Banchero (Magic)\n\nWest starters:\n\nLeBron James (Lakers)\n\nKevin Durant (Suns)\n\nLuke Donƒáic (Mavericks)\n\nNikola Jokiƒá (Nuggets)\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander (Thunder)\n\nReserves: Stephen Curry (Warriors), Devin Booker (Suns), Anthony Edwards (Timberwolves), Anthony Davis (Lakers), Kawhi Leonard (Clippers), Paul George (Clippers), Karl-Anthony Towns (Timberwolves)\n\nWorth a watch‚Ä¶ Brunson got emotional during his postgame interview when asked what it felt like to make his first All-Star Game. The Knicks superstar dropped 40 points in a 109-105 win over the Pacers ‚Äî New York's ninth straight victory.\n\nFurther reading: Biggest snubs\n\nüèà NFL mock draft: Drake over Caleb\n\nDrake Maye headlines the latest mock draft from Yahoo Sports' Nate Tice, with fellow QBs Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels right behind him.\n\nFun fact: If those are the first three players selected in April's draft, it would mark the fourth time in NFL history that the top three picks were all QBs.\n\n2021: Trevor Lawrence (Jaguars), Zach Wilson (Jets), Trey Lance (49ers)\n\n1999: Tim Couch (Browns), Donovan McNabb (Eagles), Akili Smith (Bengals)\n\n1971: Jim Plunkett (Patriots), Archie Manning (Saints), Dan Pastorini (Oilers)\n\nWhy Maye over Williams? Here's Nate‚Ä¶\n\nMaye is the Lex Luger-esque total package at QB. He's a blend of size, athleticism and arm talent, paired with an aggressive mindset. He has a clean path to elitedom. As a thrower, Maye already shows a deep toolbox. He can drive or layer throws over the middle, win over the top and place the ball consistently on underneath routes. He constantly creates and extends plays with his athleticism as a scrambler or ad libber, and generates positive or at least neutral outcomes when the play was set up for something negative.\n\nThere are still a few months of the draft process to go and Maye can still work on aspects to his game, like more consistently stepping up in the pocket and cooling down some of his heat-check moments. He has already improved upon both of those things. As just a redshirt sophomore, Maye has me currently stacking him as one of the best QB prospects I've recently scouted.\n\nBig board: Top 40 prospects\n\n‚öæÔ∏è Is this the dumbest person on the planet?\n\nFormer Alabama baseball coach Brad Bohannon received a 15-year show-cause penalty from the NCAA on Thursday for violating wagering and ethical conduct rules.\n\nIt's essentially a lifetime ban for Bohannon, who had been Alabama's coach since 2018.\n\nAny school that hires him would have to suspend him for the first five regular seasons of his employment.\n\nCatch up quick: Bohannon was fired last May when it was discovered that he had passed along inside information (Alabama's scheduled starter wouldn't be able to pitch) to his friend, Eugene Neff Jr., who he knew would be placing a bet on the Tide's game.\n\nThis is unbelievable‚Ä¶ Here's an excerpt from the NCAA's findings. Is Neff the dumbest person on the planet? I mean, come on man!\n\nShortly after receiving the electronic messages from Bohannon, the bettor attempted to place a $100,000 wager on the LSU baseball team at the BetMGM sportsbook at the Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati but the sportsbook staff limited the bettor to a $15,000 wager.\n\nThe bettor then attempted to place additional wagers involving the April 28 Alabama vs. LSU baseball game, but the sportsbook staff declined the wagers due to suspicious activity. This suspicious activity included the bettor's insistent demeanor to get the bet placed and statements to sportsbook staff that the bet was \"for sure going to win\" and \"if only you guys knew what I knew.\"\n\nThe suspicious activity also included the bettor showing sportsbook staff messages from Bohannon and explaining that the messages were Bohannon informing the bettor that Alabama was scratching its starting pitcher before the game and before Bohannon alerted LSU.\n\nüåé The world in photos\n\nBoston ‚Äî The Lakers pulled off one of the most unlikely upsets of the season on Thursday, beating the NBA-best Celtics, 114-105, without LeBron James or Anthony Davis. Austin Reaves led the way with a season-high 32 points.\n\nPebble Beach, California ‚Äî Tom Brady and Josh Allen were in the same group during the first round of the Pebble Beach Pro-Am. Brady was paired with Keegan Bradley, while Allen teamed up with Keith Mitchell.\n\nPark City, Utah ‚Äî Noe Roth of Team Switzerland takes a run during aerials training ahead of this week's Freestyle International Ski World Cup at Deer Valley.\n\nRiyadh, Saudi Arabia ‚Äî Al-Nassr handed Inter Miami an embarrassing 6-0 defeat in a friendly between the Saudi Arabian and American clubs.
