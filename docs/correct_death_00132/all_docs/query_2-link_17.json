The ouzo-drinking and bouzouki-dancing Zorba was Quinn's favorite role as well, so much so that he returned to the stage in 1983 in a revival of the 1965 film role.\n\nAs a child, he shined shoes, sold papers and preached with Aimee Semple McPherson. After working as an movie extra, he met and married the adopted daughter of Cecil B. De Mille, Katherine.\n\nA real-life artist, sculptor and author, his role as painter Paul Gauguin in the 1956 film \"Lust for Life\" earned him his second Oscar.\n\nQuinn said in a 1987 interview that he reached most of the goals he set for himself as a young boy.\n\n\"I never satisfied that kid but I think he and I have made a deal now,\" he said, referring to his younger self. \"It's like climbing a mountain: I didn't take him up Mount Everest, but I took him up Mount Whitney.\n\n\"And I think that's not bad.\""
