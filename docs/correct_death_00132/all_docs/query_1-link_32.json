        "text": "We’re doing something no one else has done—we’ve radically re-conceived the PhD degree based on the premise that creative thinking lies at the heart of innovation in all fields.\n\nThe PhD in Creativity is a low-residency degree for advanced interdisciplinary research in the arts, humanities, sciences and social sciences. This first-of-its-kind PhD offers unique features not found elsewhere: intensive immersion in creative thinking, cross-disciplinary workshops for dissertation development, and professionally accomplished advisors from outside the university whose selection is tailored to best serve each unique dissertation.\n\nThis program can teach a practitioner in any field—science, medicine, business, engineering, healthcare, the social sciences, the nonprofit world and even the arts—to think more creatively.\n\nThe Program's Philosophy\n\nAll PhD programs require a dissertation that makes “an original contribution to knowledge.” Yet after steeping the candidate in the existing literature and methods, they offer no guidance on how to move beyond them. At University of the Arts, our PhD is about fundamentally changing the way our students think. We seek students who have already achieved a professional mastery in some discipline, and we prepare them to go to another level. We show them how to be open to finding that moment when ideas that didn’t seem to have anything to do with one another suddenly come together to ask or answer a question, create a solution to a problem, produce a new invention. This immersion in the arts can teach a practitioner in any field—science, medicine, business, engineering, healthcare, the social sciences, the nonprofit world and even the arts—to think more creatively.\n\nA Three-Year PhD\n\nThe PhD in Creativity is a three-year, dissertation-only program.\n\nMost PhD programs require six or seven years to complete. Such programs begin with a thorough training in a field’s methods and base knowledge and administer a qualifying examination after this training is complete. The PhD in Creativity’s application serves as that qualifying examination; we examine an applicant’s MA or other training, professional experience and dissertation proposal to determine their readiness to enter our PhD and begin their dissertation.\n\nThe Two-Week Creativity Immersion\n\nAll transformative work—even in technology, science and social science—depends upon intuition and nonlinear thought. Yes, we need the rigors of the scientific method and the data base of knowledge. Yet to take innovation to another level, we also need to transcend the hierarchies of conventional training. And the arts offer the most consciously developed disciplines of nonlinear and integrative thinking.\n\nThe PhD in Creativity begins with creativity itself: Creative thinking is in the DNA of our faculty, and no university is better equipped to teach it. The PhD commences in mid-June with the Creativity Immersion. During this two-week residency, students are immersed in a curated sequence of arts experiences for an intense course in creativity. Each cohort presents their proposal for a group critique by their fellow students and faculty. They then reframe that proposal every day, through a wide variety of creative lenses. Since each cohort draws from a range of disciplines, candidates are forced to jettison disciplinary jargon and hone in on their ideas.\n\nInformed by daily experiences in different creative practices, students revise their proposals into working drafts. After the Creativity Immersion, students use these revised proposals to build their dissertation committees, in consultation with the program director.\n\nAdmission\n\nApplications to the PhD in Creativity for the 2022–2023 academic year are closed.\n\nThe PhD in Creativity is known for providing a tailored, personalized experience for each of its students and their unique, interdisciplinary dissertations. In service of this goal, the PhD in Creativity operates via a single-cohort model, accepting a new cohort every three years as the previous cohort graduates.\n\nRead more about our application process below.\n\nIf you have questions about the application process, email phdprogram@uarts.edu.\n\nApplication Timeline, 2021-2022\n\nAugust 25, 2021: Applications open for the PhD in Creativity.\n\nNovember 15, 2021: Application materials are due.\n\nJanuary 2022: Finalists are invited to interview with the Director.\n\nMid-February 2022: Final decisions are issued.\n\nApplication Requirements\n\nWe seek students who have already achieved proficiency in an intellectual pursuit—it could be in any field—such that the candidate is prepared for the dissertation stage of a rigorous but out-of-the-box PhD. Our students will typically have found themselves wanting to transcend the disciplinary limits of their training with an interdisciplinary project. We will be looking for projects that may not easily fit into programs elsewhere. We actively encourage students currently enrolled in PhD programs elsewhere to enroll in the two-week Creativity Immersion to frame or re-frame their dissertations; leaving their current program is not required.\n\nThe application materials are as follows:\n\nA Research Proposal of about 1,000 words, outlining the dissertation you wish to pursue in the PhD of Creativity. This document should state the central question your research proposes to address. It should also discuss the need for your project, both personal and on the broader scale of scholarship; your project's relationship to previous scholarship in the field; the methods you propose to use; and a selection of works you consider central to your project.\n\nA Personal Statement of about 1,000 words, telling us why you’re interested in the PhD in Creativity. Topics you may wish to consider when writing this document: What led to your interest in pursuing a PhD of this kind? How has your prior training or work experience prepared you to undertake the writing of your dissertation? What other works or paths – books, articles, bodies of work, or other influences – do you want to explore during your time in the program? With what kinds of advisors would you ideally like to work? What do you envision yourself doing with this degree? Please note that these are only suggestions, and the personal statement is not intended to be a comprehensive document. Overall, it should give us a sense of your interests and who you are.\n\nYour Resume or CV.\n\nApplication Form: The nonrefundable application fee of $60.00 can be paid by credit card, check, or money order. The fee must be payable in U.S. currency and all checks must be drawn on U.S. banks. University of the Arts graduates are exempt from the fee.\n\nTranscripts: From each graduate and undergraduate school from which you have earned a degree. Unofficial transcripts may be uploaded at the application stage. After a candidate is accepted, their official transcripts should be sent directly from the Registrar’s Office at the college(s) or school(s) previously attended.
