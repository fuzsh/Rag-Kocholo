        "text": "ANTHONY QUINN, the actor who has died aged 86, had bulk and sinew of such scale that his acting in films could seem too clumsy for the medium to contain.\n\nDark-haired, dark-eyed, strong-chinned, long-faced, tall and swarthy, he possessed such a menacing smile, intimidating scowl and overpowering masculinity that his art, tending to the uncouth, often looked as if it came from some heroic stage tradition.\n\nHe did indeed play, occasionally, on stage and once appeared opposite Laurence Olivier: \"I took him on in Becket and I got slapped down. It was good for me. I grew.\" But Quinn, who made around 130 films in a career spanning half a century, was overwhelmingly an actor of the screen.\n\nBeing of mixed Irish, Mexican and Aztec descent, he could, he believed, play anyone of any nationality, especially, as the producer Cecil B De Mille once harshly put it, half-breeds. He did so with indiscriminate energy, sincerity and muscle. He knew how to dispense danger as well as dignity, how to carry an audience along with any character he happened to be playing. Those characters ranged from bandits and dim desperadoes to legendary figures from world history.\n\nIf neither the films nor his acting touched greatness, his passion and his beefy style gave some of them an engaging verve. Such honesty of spirit won him wide affection, and in films such as Viva Zapata! (1952) La Strada (1954), Lust For Life (1956), The Guns of Navarone (1961), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), A High Wind In Jamaica (1965), The Greek Tycoon (1978) and his most famous star vehicle, Zorba the Greek (1964), he won the critical respect which otherwise largely eluded him.\n\nAttempts in more recent films to modify the effect on screen of his swaggeringly exuberant temperament (European directors were generally more successful at trimming his instinct to over-act) met with little success.\n\nQuinn nevertheless stayed a star to the end, much larger than life both on and off the screen, and a force to reckon with on the stage - even, in his seventies, as the lustiest of his heroes, Zorba, on Broadway. When, in his eighties, he fathered two children by his secretary (later his third wife), a New York newspaper greeted the announcement with the exultant headline \"The Mighty Quinn\".\n\nAnthony Rudolph Oaxaca Quinn was born at Chihuahua, Mexico, on April 21 1915, the son of Frank Quinn, whose father was from Cork, and his 17-year-old Mexican wife, Manuela, who was of Aztec ancestry. He fled with his parents from Pancho Villa's revolution across the border to El Paso, Texas, and then to California.\n\nWhen he was four the family moved to east Los Angeles where his father worked as an odd-job man at the Selig studio, and the boy played a juvenile Tarzan in a jungle film. When he was nine, his father died in a motoring accident. Quinn then turned his hand to all kinds of work, and at 14 was supervising 150 workers on an apricot ranch.\n\nHe longed to be an architect and wangled his way into the presence of Frank Lloyd Wright. Perceiving that the boy had a speech impediment, Wright recommended an operation. Quinn had it on an instalment plan, and took acting lessons to train his voice. With his new-found speech skill, he began preaching at Aimee Semple McPherson's temple and at her street corner rallies where he played the saxophone. The experience instilled a degree of religious faith.\n\nAt 16 he took up boxing and had some sparring sessions with Primo Carnera. At 17 he went to the Polytechnic High School, Los Angeles, where he organised a school orchestra. After a spell with the Federal Theatre Project, he drifted round the West coast as cement mixer, ditch digger, boxer, fruit picker and as a foreman in a mattress factory. His first acting job was in a local production of Mae West's play Clean Beds in 1936. Quinn's role was a take-off of John Barrymore, who saw the show several times, befriended the youth and urged him to try Broadway.\n\nQuinn stuck to Hollywood and, looking genuinely haggard in his unemployment, got his first bit part in Parole (1936). Then he played a Cheyenne Indian in Cecil B De Mille's The Plainsman (1936), a dancer in Swing High, Swing Low (1937), a military official with a few tickets for The Last Train from Madrid (1937), Chief Crazy Horse in They Died With Their Boots On (1941), a Rudolph Valentino role in Blood and Sand (1941), a North African sheikh in The Road To Morocco (1942), an illiterate Mexican mistakenly lynched in The Ox-Bow Incident (1943), a lone marine survivor in Guadalcanal Diary (1943), a Chinese warrior in China Sky (1945), a Filipino guerrilla in Back to Bataan (1945), and an American-Indian millionaire who provokes racial resentment by entering his horse in the Kentucky Derby in Black Gold (1947).\n\nThat was the year he made his Broadway debut in the short-lived The Gentleman from Athens as an aggressive Greek-American who gets himself elected to Congress. The play failed but his acting, described in Newsweek as \"tough and ingratiating\", persuaded Elia Kazan to send him on a two-year tour of A Streetcar Named Desire.\n\nHe also played in repertory on the East coast in 1950, in the touring company of Garson Kanin's Born Yesterday and in S N Behrman's Let Me Hear the Melody in 1951; and in 1962 he played the Italian in New York in Tchin-Tchin, the French comedy, but he confessed he had no idea what the play was about, still less his role.\n\nIn the 1950s his film career took a leap forward in Kazan's Viva Zapata! This brought him his first Oscar as best supporting actor, playing Marlon Brando's grumpy brother. After a few more unimportant Hollywood films, he moved with his family to Italy. The move brought him, in 1954, one of his best roles, in Fellini's Oscar-winning La Strada, where he played a brutish carnival showman who does not realise, until she is dead, how much he loved the woman he has treated so badly.\n\nBack in Hollywood in 1956 he played Gauguin to Kirk Douglas's Vincent van Gogh in Vincente Minnelli's Lust For Life. Although his role occupied only six minutes of screen time, he won an Oscar for what the New York Times called: \"a splendid concept of a disordered, creative man\".\n\nA couple of accomplished westerns followed. In Last Train From Gun Hill (1959), he was the father of a rapist-killer. In Warlock (1959) he was a crippled homosexual somewhat nebulously in love with Henry Fonda. It took a couple of relatively inferior films, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1956) and Wild Is the Wind (1957), for which he won an Oscar nomination, to make him into anything like a star.\n\nIn George Cukor's Heller In Pink Tights (1960), he starred with Sophia Loren in a tale about a troupe of strolling players in the old West, and in Nicholas Ray's The Savage Innocents (1960) he reverted, somewhat disconcertingly, to ethnic type as Inuk the Eskimo.\n\nWith three epics in the early 1960s, J Lee Thompson's The Guns of Navarone, Richard Fleischer's Barabbas (1962), and David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia (in which he played the rascally Sheikh Auda with the aid of a large, hawk-like nose) Quinn's reputation rose considerably.\n\nIn Ralph Nelson's Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962) he was characteristically powerful and sweaty as a punch-drunk boxer who was knocked about by Cassius Clay (as Muhammad Ali then was). In 1964 he starred with Ingrid Bergman in The Visit; and in 1965 made a memorably endearing pirate captain for the children to betray in Alexander Mackendrick's A High Wind In Jamaica (1965).\n\nBut the film which caught the essence of Quinn's earthy exuberance was Michael Cacoyannis's Zorba the Greek. This provided several outlets for Quinn's passion and gusto including the chance to teach Alan Bates to dance. It brought Quinn another Oscar and confirmed his international stardom.\n\nThen came a series of undistinguished vehicles in which he was accused of over-playing more than ever. It was as if the recognition for which he had worked for so long (nearly 30 years) had gone to his head. But his unrivalled gallery of ethnic eminences continued with Kiril in The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968), drawn from Morris West's prophetic novel, and provoking the derisive nickname Zorba the Pope. The following year, he appeared in Stanley Kramer's The Secret of Santa Vittoria.\n\nIn the 1970s he appeared in the television film Jesus of Nazareth. In the title role of J Lee Thompson's The Greek Tycoon (1978) his acting carried amusing echoes of Onassis, though the film was little more than a good laugh; but in The Children of Sanchez (1978) he suddenly shed the self-conscious, preening grandeur which had characterised so much of his playing and as the wretched Mexican father produced a truly touching portrayal.\n\nHis autobiography The Original Sin (1972) dealt largely with his psycho-analysis in the 1950s, and of his abiding fears of penury since childhood. When asked by Marlon Brando why he always worked so hard, he replied: \"When you buy shoes, you buy one pair. When I buy shoes I buy eighteen.\" Quinn produced a second volume of memoirs, Suddenly Sunset, and was also an accomplished painter and sculptor.\n\nHe married, first, the actress Katherine De Mille, Cecil B De Mille's adoptive daughter, in 1937 (dissolved 1965), by whom he had one son and three daughters. He married, secondly, in 1966, Iolanda Addolari, by whom he had three sons. They divorced in 1997, after Quinn fathered a son and a daughter by his secretary, Kathy Bevin, whom he married in 1997."
