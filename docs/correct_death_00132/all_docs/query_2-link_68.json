He was 86.\n\nQuinn won two Academy Awards for best supporting actor, one for his 1952 role as a Mexican revolutionary in ``Viva Zapata!'' and another four years later for his portrayal of the French painter Paul Gauguin in the film ``Lust for Life.''\n\nQuinn was best known for his memorable portrayal of the title character in ``Zorba the Greek''. For Quinn, Zorba was more than just a film role.\n\n``I am Zorba,'' Quinn once said of the hero of the movie, a worldly wise Greek who lived life to the fullest."
