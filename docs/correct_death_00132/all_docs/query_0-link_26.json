        "text": "(1915–2001). Mexican-born American actor, producer, and director Anthony Quinn enjoyed an extraordinarily long and wide-ranging career in motion pictures, beginning with a bit part as a Cheyenne warrior in the 1936 western The Plainsman. Although he played a varied assortment of ethnic characters, he is perhaps best known for portraying the main character in Zorba the Greek (1964).\n\nAnthony Rudolph Oaxaca Quinn was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, on April 21, 1915, and grew up in the United States. He became a United States citizen in 1947. During his youth Quinn had a variety of jobs—prizefighter, painter, and musician and preacher for an evangelist among them. He also studied for the priesthood and considered becoming an architect. To aid him in the latter, he began taking acting lessons after Frank Lloyd Wright suggested that he improve his speech, and before long he had been cast in the play Clean Beds. In 1936 Quinn appeared in a small part in the movie Parole, and he thereafter won a number of roles of various ethnic and/or outlaw characters in the films They Died with Their Boots On (1941), The Ox-Bow Incident (1943), Guadalcanal Diary (1943), and Back to Bataan (1945).\n\nQuinn’s first lead role came in 1947 in Black Gold. That same year he went to New York, New York, and made his Broadway debut in The Gentleman from Athens. He followed that with touring as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire, returning to New York in 1950 to replace Marlon Brando in that role, and then touring in Born Yesterday and Let Me Hear the Melody. He also appeared in a number of live television programs.\n\nReturning to Hollywood, Quinn had roles in The Brave Bulls (1951) and Viva Zapata! (1952), for which he won the first of his two Academy Awards for best supporting actor. He then made a few films in Italy, the most notable of which was Federico Fellini’s La Strada (1954). Quinn won his second Oscar for Lust for Life (1956) and went on to roles in the memorable motion pictures Wild Is the Wind (1957), The Savage Innocents (1959), The Guns of Navarone (1961), Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962), and Lawrence of Arabia (1962). He returned to the stage in 1982 to tour with and appear on Broadway in a revival of the musical version of Zorba, and he also became a successful artist and sculptor. His final movie role was in Avenging Angelo (2002).\n\nQuinn published two memoirs, The Original Sin (1972) and One Man Tango (1995). He died in Boston, Massachusetts, on June 3, 2001."
