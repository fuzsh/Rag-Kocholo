        "text": "Having missed out on getting his ass shot off on Omaha Beach because he had to direct THE SEVENTH VICTIM (a positive result all round), Mark Robson then traversed the globe, expiating his absenteeism by celebrating every war available to him — Korea in THE BRIDGES AT TOKO-RI, WWII in VON RYAN’S EXPRESS, and in LOST COMMAND he follows some French paratroopers from Indo-China to Algiers, Admittedly, none of Robson’s war movies are wholeheartedly gung ho, perhaps gung hey or gung huh? at most. But they never quite commit themselves to a definite anti-war view either.\n\nThe result is choppy. His source novel by ex-army, ex-journalist Jean Lartéguy doesn’t supply him with a clear central character or a clear line of action, we jump forward in time and from place to place, and a story that could have been about an honorable soldier’s slow corruption by political pressures is muddied and diluted by mixing it with other stories, and by presumably commercial fears about character sympathy and overt political statements.\n\nShot in Spain — Al Mulock, the first face we see in THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY, appears — the film also suffers from not having any real Arabs. We get George Segal in shoe polish instead, and the brown shine never seems to get far enough down his neck to suggest an all-over tan. Claudia Cardinale, appearing briefly, IS actually Tunisian, but sounds Italian. We can ignore that, though, if we can get past Anthony Quinn as a Basque peasant with an American accent, surrounded by French characters played by actual French people. It’ll be fine.\n\nStealing most of the glory from Quinn is Alain Delon, as the film’s conscience, which may seem ironic now in the light of his later politics. Delon sounds like Charles Boyer when he speaks English, and should have been a major Hollywood star, but his attempts at it were mainly this and a Ralph Nelson film. And in TEXAS ACROSS THE RIVER he supports Dean Martin. None of these were the right vehicles, and American cinema was turning inwards — exotic locales and cosmopolitan characters were no longer the staples. The New Hollywood, in essence a more realist cinema, naturally (it seemed) focussed on what was happening locally. And the collapsing studios couldn’t force a new star on the public by power of publicity and consistent casting — the result ever since has been that when an outsider does make a breakthrough impression in a Hollywood film, they have a hell of a time following up on it with an equally effective role.\n\nThe film’s messiness is evident immediately, as we begin in a battle and Robson ruins his big action scene by pasting enormous credits over it, which stick around over the edits, sloppily, forcing us to read them twice.\n\nThe film is notable for its cast — Maurice Ronet makes a strong impression — you won’t see Quinn getting yelled at by Burt Kwouk anywhere else — AQ has an age-appropriate fling with Michele Morgan — we pause to inspect the ruins of Jean Servais, moving his lips to someone else’s line readings.\n\nGeneral Melies, complete with moon rocket.\n\nPolitically, it’s mostly interested in being fair to the oppressed colonial peoples while blowing them up in exciting ways — Delon says it’s understandable that “the coolies” want a change — the illegal searches and use of torture are touched upon in “the battle of Algiers” sequence — but it’s all soft-pedaled. Comparing it to Pontecorvo’s hard-hitting, unmealymouthed movie of that name, is not only instructive but positively shaming. We can attribute most of the abuse to “a few bad apples” — in fact, viewers could reasonably conclude that Maurice Ronet and his blackjack were responsible for the whole dirty business, solo.\n\nLOST COMMAND stars Zorba; Jeff Costello; Quiller; Joséphine de Beauharnais; Philippe Greenleaf; Jill McBain; King Brob; Tony le Stéphanois; Insp. Edouard Grandpierre; Cato Fong; One-Armed Bounty Hunter; and Cuchillio.\n\nErrol Flynn movies are highly intertitular. After enjoying THE DAWN PATROL so much, and particularly the Flynn-Niven byplay in biplanes, we ran THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD (Fiona wasn’t sure she’d ever seen the whole thing, shock horror), THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON and THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE. Nothing came up to the satisfaction of Goulding’s flying saga, but ROBIN HOOD is of course huge fun.\n\nScattered impressions: Eugene Pallette really can’t swordfight. He just waves his longsword about, but struggles to do that at anything like an impressive speed. I think his problem is he’s trying to mimic the anachronistic rapier-work displayed by Flynn et al. The film is full of undercranking but he’s the one who needs it. Also: Flynn and Rathbone had a fight arranger for their fantastic duel. Pallette just seems to have been shovelled into a cassock and left to fend for himself.\n\nThe music! The sets! The film is only half Curtiz (William Keighley had it taken away from him for being too slow and not dramatic enough — Curtiz came on and was even slower but much more dramatic). The closeup of Rathbone dead! The Curtiz sadism always finds an outlet.\n\nCHARGE is described in an opening title as “fictionized” and the same curious word is used by Hal Wallis in memos (Inside Warner Bros. (1935-1951), Rudy Behlmer) so I guess maybe he coined it. It actual makes more sense than “fictionalised” maybe. Anyway what he means is it’s a ludicrous farrago, but Curtiz is still prowl-tracking through sets with lots of intervening props and characters that glide past between us and the action, a 3D filmmaker avant la lettre.\n\nThe “British fort” is wonderfully hilarious. Utter phallocracy. It was clearly felt that a British fort in India should have an Indian aspect, a sense of minaret to it, despite the fact that colonialism is rendered visual in the way the coloniser builds in his own style structures in the land of the colonised. So this Flash Gordon fairytale palace is based on nothing, it’s as unreal as the light sources from below designed only to cast dramatic shadows on walls, a real Curtiz trope visible in both these Flynn movies he directed.\n\nThe fictionized end battle is unbelievably massive. Lots of horses, both full and empty. In some wide shots they seem to be tripping the horses with pits (the Italian method, more humane) but mostly they’re using the crueller Running W tripwire approach and lots of horses were maimed and killed. Niven and other cast members complained. It’s all right up there on the screen. The BBFC has a history of censoring such scenes but if they started on this one I don’t know what’d be left, the Valley of Death as a shredded string of blipverts and ellisions.\n\nIncredible decision to cast Flynn and De Havilland and have her in love with his brother, the nonexistent Patric Knowles. And with Niven standing around with nothing to do! There’s a memo about casting proper posh Brits in the posh roles, and beware because naturally Curtiz can’t tell cockney from Received Pronunciation, and then we have E.E. Clive (“‘E’s invisibule, that’s wot’s the matter with ‘im!”) as a diplomat. He’s talking respectably, but diplomats are about nine shades posher than mere respectable, they’re so posh you can barely understand them.\n\nI wish I’d seen this and BOOTS when I was younger and more into silly fun. But BOOTS would probably still have outraged me because its mangling of history is more pernicious (though one wonders at Hollywood’s man-crush on the British Empire. I guess we were an important market). Yet, despite its glorifying Custer, not a good man, the movie is quite sympathetic to the Indians for a work of that time.\n\nAnthony Quinn as Crazy Horse!\n\nPlenty of forthright rambunctiousness for director Raoul Walsh to get his teeth into. The crazy disregard for fact resolves into a much more coherent story than CHARGE, even though they’re stringing things out across Custer’s entire career from West Point to Little Bighorn. As with CHARGE, the trick is to disguise a strategic blunder as a cunning plan, and remould horrific defeat as stunning victory. Using Tennyson but altering the entire significance of the battle is a striking bit of Hollywood chicanery, besides which BOOTS’ repurposing of Custer’s Last Stand as a diversionary move to save another unit pales, seems almost respectable.\n\nThis one has a proper and really good romantic relationship (marriage!) for Errol and Olivia. And really good use of Arthur Kennedy, the Anti-Flynn.\n\nFlynn’s historical, or historized, films, are crowded with intertitles. It’s as if Warners felt the use of this old-timey narrative technique would bestow a suitably archaic feeling to the action.\n\nTHE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD stars George Armstrong Custer; Melanie Hamilton – Their Cousin; Sherlock Holmes; Dr. Jack Griffin; Dr. Frank Mannering; Alexander Bullock; Mr. Pike; Gerald; Theseus – Duke of Athens; Minnie; Albert Miggles; Colonel Weed; Mr. LeBrand; Greystoke’s Nephew; King Charles II; Man in 1780 Sequence (uncredited); The Burgomaster; Crunch; Dr. John Lanyon; Loana; Old Tramp; Louise Finch; and Trigger.\n\nTHE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE stars Robin Hood; Maid Marian; Will Scarlett; Lord Willoughby; Dr. Watson; Battling Burrows; Sir Charles Lytton the notorious Phantom; Dr. Cream; Lt. ‘Queen’s Own’ Butler; Chingachgook; Bertha Van Cleve; Constable Jaffers; Chief Sitting Bull; Princess Baba; Monsieur Taffy; and Dr. John Lanyon.\n\nTHEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON stars Robin Hood; Maid Marian; Jackson Bentley; Grandpa Joad; Sheriff Hartwell; Paul Gauguin; Professor Siletsky; Carson Drew; Oliver Larrabee; Kasper Gurman; Arvide Abernathy; Queenie; Augustus Brandon; Alan Winters in Photo (uncredited); Babe Dooley; Wolf Larsen; Mrs Stark – Jim’s Grandmother; Mr. Cope in Fantasy Sequence; Porthos; Detective Dickens; Inez Laranetta; Duffy; and Cueball.\n\nWatched two Vincente Minnellis this week, without having planned it. BELLS ARE RINGING (top) was a rewatch. The combination of the timeless and simple source material — Cinderella — clever-clever screenwriter/songwriters (Comden & Green) — a crazed aesthete for a director — and the comedy powerhouse that is Judy Holliday — make this one that shouldn’t be missed if you like any of those kind of things.\n\nWe’d never seen LUST FOR LIFE. We didn’t initially take to Kirk Douglas as Vincent Van Gogh, although he certainly looks the part. He rants a lot, and it feels like the usual Kirk schtick amped up to eleven, rather than anything new or insightful. We admitted the thing was extremely beautiful. We pondered at the fact that Vincent’s letters to Theo (James Donald) were read on the soundtrack by Donald, not Douglas.\n\nSlowly, the film gets better, or its better qualities come to dominate. Donald is the emotional centre, the one who can enlist our sympathies most strongly, so that’s why he gets the VO. And there’s more going on with the imagery than “just” beauty or even an attempt to mimic the look of specific Van Gogh paintings.\n\nWhen VVG, close to his first crack-up, sits in a gloomy bar, Minnelli shows us his tormented face and then his POV.\n\nWe don’t know yet that Minnelli plans to use the image of the lamp as a symbol for when VVG’s mind overheats. It returns later, precipitating the ear-lopping.\n\nWhat it does here, instead, is suggests the artist’s ability to find beauty in unexpected circumstances. Combined with Kirk’s glowering features, it suggests that he’s oppressed by this ability.\n\nAnd then the ravishing landscapes, the film’s incessant picturesqueness, start to take on an added value. They go by too fast for us to really study them, seize them with our minds. We feel like the artist, struggling to capture fleeting beauty before it vanishes forever. (No replay function for real life.)\n\nThe lantern having assumed a prominent role, Minnelli can simply pan away onto it when VVG is about to make with the straight razor. Exactly as Tarantino does in RESERVOIR DOGS.\n\nLacking the ability to make Kirk’s ear disappear, Minnelli has to simply avoid shooting him on one side after the bandages come off.\n\nFiona remembers her art teacher inveighing against Don McLean’s song Vincent and its bogus sentimentality. I remember my art teacher answering a question about why VVG cut his ear off with the line, “He wanted to see what it looked like.” Quite a logical answer. He was an artist, he painted self-portraits… Not true though.\n\nKirk quietens down in some scenes. James Donald continues to quietly engage. Anthony Quinn brings the entertainment, and doesn’t overact. And he makes things a bit less formal.\n\nThe ending had an unexpected emotional impact, especially for Fiona, bringing back her feelings at her own brother’s death. “My poor brother,” says Theo, which is simple and absolutely right. What else can you say?\n\nWe’re inclined to look at some more cinematic Vincents. There are lots! The Richard Curtis Dr. Who episode is the worst thing ever, though — way beyond Don McLean."
