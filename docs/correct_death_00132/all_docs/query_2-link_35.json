(1952), and another as the painter Gauguin, the friend of Vincent Van Gogh in Lust for Life (1956, with Kirk Douglas as Van Gogh).\n\nIn the 1960s Quinn became permanently associated with the title role of the earthy, life-embracing peasant in Zorba the Greek.\n\nWhile managing a successful screen career, Quinn also made a name for himself as a sculptor and painter. In later years he became notorious for his marital peccadilloes; in all he had five wives and fathered 13 children.\n\nQuinn died of respiratory failure in June 2001, aged 86."
