        "text": "If there was any doubt at all about whether Anthony Quinn was a true star, just take a look look at his track record. A film career that lasted 66 (!) years. Appearances in 151 films. Winner of two Academy Awards (for “Viva Zapata!’ and ‘Lust for Life’). Nominated for two more. Two BAFTA nominations. Five Golden Globe nominations. Nominated for a Primetime Emmy. And even a 382-performance run on Broadway as the star of the stage musical “Zorba,” based on his own hit film. That, my friend, is a star.\n\nBorn in Mexico but raised in Texas, Quinn began his career as a professional boxer but soon segued to acting. Blessed with looks that defied pigeonholing, Quinn played characters who were Latino, Greek, Italian, Arab and Native American (among many others), allowing him to explore a range of characterizations that few actors would be able to pull off so skillfully. Quinn’s talent, as well as his ethnic versatility, soon brought him to the attention of many of the world’s finest filmmakers — from such legendary directors as David Lean and George Cukor to Elia Kazan and Vincente Minnelli, and maestro Frederico Fellini and the great Spike Lee.\n\nSo let’s raise a glass and offer a toast to the screen legend Quinn by ranking and counting down, from worst to best, his 12 top screen performances!"
