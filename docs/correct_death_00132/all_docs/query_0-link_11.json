        "text": "Anthony Quinn, whose six-decade acting career established the enduring image of a joyful primitive with a fierce passion for life, died yesterday at a Boston hospital. He was 86 and lived in Bristol, R.I., near Providence.\n\nThe cause was respiratory failure, said a hospital spokeswoman.\n\nAlthough he appeared in perhaps 130 movies, Mr. Quinn was probably best known for the title role in Michael Cacoyannis's 1964 film, ''Zorba the Greek.'' Mr. Quinn's Zorba is an earthy peasant of indeterminate age and occupation whose philosophy is that ''a man needs a little madness'' or else ''he never dares cut the rope and be free.'' Zorba charms an elderly former prostitute, giving her the tenderness she craves before her death. He defends a young widow attacked by her neighbors for having an affair. And he shows an overly intellectual Englishman (Alan Bates) how to dance and to live.\n\nIf some critics accused Mr. Quinn of playing the same character under different names for decades, even of coming to believe that he was Zorba, the life force personified, he did it convincingly. When a musical version of ''Zorba'' opened on Broadway in 1968 with Herschel Bernardi in the title role, it quickly closed. In 1982, at age 67, Mr. Quinn revived the musical and took it on a triumphant national tour for four years, with a stop on Broadway in 1983.\n\nBenedict Nightingale, reviewing Mr. Quinn's performance for The New York Times, noted that he really could neither sing nor dance, but ''he has his moments, plenty of them,'' and ''that lordly, grizzled charisma is undiminished throughout.''\n\nIn the decade before ''Zorba,'' Mr. Quinn, who had been acting in films since the 1930's, twice won the Academy Award as best supporting actor. He was given the 1952 Oscar for Elia Kazan's ''Viva Zapata!,'' in which he played the dissolute brother of the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, played by Marlon Brando. Four years later he received the award again for his performance as an intense Paul Gauguin in Vincente Minnelli's ''Lust for Life,'' opposite Kirk Douglas's wan Vincent van Gogh. Mr. Quinn was nominated for the best-actor Oscar for ''Zorba,'' but lost that year to Rex Harrison in ''My Fair Lady.''\n\nMr. Quinn achieved another memorable success in 1954 when he agreed to appear in a young Italian director's third film. The director was Federico Fellini, and the film was ''La Strada,'' in which Mr. Quinn played a sideshow strongman. Mr. Quinn received an acting award at the Venice Film Festival, and when ''La Strada'' was released in the United States, it won the Academy Award for best foreign film.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
