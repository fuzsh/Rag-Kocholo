        "text": "There is no shortage of talent in the contemporary British literary scene. One such example is renowned British author Anthony Quinn. His book Curtain Call was a bestseller, and the film critic turned writer from Liverpool has made a respectable body of work in recent years. The books by Anthony Quinn are a must-read for any lover of today’s fiction (and sometimes, non-fiction).\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn about the best books by Anthony Quinn and why you should read them.\n\nAbout the author\n\nThe British writer Anthony Quinn is a novelist, journalist, and film critic. He was born on October 22,1964, in Liverpool, England, and educated at the Catholic grammar school, St. Francis Xavier’s College, and at Pembroke College, Oxford.\n\nQuinn first started working at a bookshop in London before becoming a journalist, writing book reviews and movie critiques for the Independent. He’s also written for some other journals, such as The New York Times.\n\nThis ushered in the next phase of his career, which he spent dedicating himself to writing for magazines and papers. He also interviewed other writers, including some of his literary influences such as John Updike. Throughout his whole life, he was written short stories, as well.\n\nAfter he spent a year as a judge for the Man Booker Prize in 2006, he started his first literary work. His debut novel, The Rescue Man, was published in 2009 and won the Authors’ Club Best First Novel award.\n\nThe charm in Anthony Quinn’s works lies in his ability to create stories that are unpredictable, suspenseful, and yet effortless to read. His prose is clear and captures the spirit of an age he writes about, such as 18th-century Britain or the 1930s.\n\nSome other novels include:\n\nHalf of the Human Race\n\nCurtain Call\n\nEureka\n\nBorder Angels\n\nThe Celcius Daly series\n\nFreya\n\nHe also wrote a nonfiction book Klopp: My Liverpool Romance.\n\nCurrently, Anthony Quinn lives in Islington.\n\nBest Anthony Quinn books\n\nCurtain Call\n\nCurtain Call is a murder mystery novel that juxtaposes dramatic elements in a unique way. Nina Land joins artist Stephan Wyley at The Imperial Hotel to engage in an affair. However, she hears a scream outside of the room. After inspecting the source of the horrible sounds, she accidentally saves the victim from the killer. It seems like the perfect set-up for a crime novel.\n\nThis launches the plot along, weaving together the stories of seemingly disparate characters at a complicated point in history. The novel is set in the 1930s, and threatening political developments take place, such as the rise of Oswald Mosley and the looming approach of World War II.\n\nHowever, the characters pay no attention to that as they’re much more immersed in their own affairs. It also explores the secrets of the theater critic Jimmy Erskine as he meets the escaped victim of the killer and his life becomes linked with hers as well.\n\nCurtain Call captures a distinct time in history, including the realities of that time in the backdrop. The characters are engrossed in a struggle that is surprisingly funny yet sometimes tragic as they weave their way through the dangers and drama of the era.\n\nFreya\n\nFreya follows the pursuit of autonomy through the character Freya Wyley. As Freya leaves the military service, she meets Nancy Holdaway. The two are both aspiring writers and have become best friends. However, the two women face threatening challenges that put their friendship to the test.\n\nFreya doesn’t just tell the story of two friends, it explores cultural and dire themes centering around the post-war era and Freya’s ambitions to become a journalist. Freya has a unique drive, and after serving in the navy, her struggle continues until that drive is fulfilled.\n\nIt also explores the relationship between Nancy and Freya and the female connection. The pair of friends live like bohemians, and Freya finds herself in certain sexual scandals and adventures in a world dominated by men. Her relationship with Nancy may be what has saved her all along.\n\nFreya is filled with interesting plot twists and themes to explore. It’ll definitely be a book you’ll spend hours talking about at a book club.\n\nThe Rescue Man\n\nBy now, you’ve probably noticed that Antony Quinn does an amazing job of recreating the past and capturing it as the backdrop to explore the relationships of compelling characters. His historical fiction is frequently set in the World War II era. The Rescue Man is one such book.\n\nTom Baines lives in Liverpool during World War II. The Luftwaffe is attacking, and Baines puts his knowledge of buildings to the test by becoming a rescue man. He aims to save the victims of Liverpool by digging through the rubble of destroyed buildings.\n\nAt the same time, he desires deeply to preserve the buildings of Liverpool. As he goes about his mission, he begins to understand the spirit that makes up his city. Baines isn’t exactly a “people person” and seems to be enamored with buildings more than anything else. But that doesn’t stop him from developing a relationship with the photographer Bella.\n\nBaines learns about the vulnerability of human life throughout the war. It’s precisely this that opens him up to people and society as a whole. He becomes caring of others instead of only focusing on buildings and his architecture books.\n\nAt the same time, the novel explores the diaries of Peter Eames, an architect Baines is researching. The diary format is juxtaposed against the story, and the two bounce back and forth.\n\nListen to modern British authors with Speechify Audiobooks\n\nDo you want to read other renowned and modern British authors like Anthony Quinn?
