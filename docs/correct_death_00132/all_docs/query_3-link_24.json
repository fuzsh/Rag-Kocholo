He was 86.\n\nQuinn's death was reported by Providence, R.I., Mayor Vincent \"Buddy\" Cianci, a friend of the actor. He said Quinn died of respiratory failure at a Boston hospital.\n\n\"He was larger than life,\" Cianci said. \"I was proud to call him a friend.\"\n\nQuinn was living in Bristol, near Providence.\n\nQuinn, who appeared in more than 100 feature films, won Academy Awards for best supporting actor in \"Viva Zapata!\" and \"Lust for Life.\"\n\nBorn in Mexico and raised in poverty in East Los Angeles, Quinn went from stage and B-movie roles to become an international leading man renowned for his big-man sensitivity and honest acting style.\n\nIn a film career that spanned almost 30 years, Quinn portrayed characters ranging from kings to Indians, including a pope, a boxer and an artist.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
