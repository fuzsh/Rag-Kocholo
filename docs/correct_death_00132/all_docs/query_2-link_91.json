PEOPLE cites a report by the Malibu Patch, a local web site.\n\nQuinn had a role in Oliver Stone's 1986 \"Platoon\" as the drug dealer Rhah. He later appeared on such TV series as \"The Young and the Restless,\" \"NCIS,\" \"ER\" and \"24,\"according to PEOPLE.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Valentina Castellani-Quinn and three children."
