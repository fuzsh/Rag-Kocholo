        "text": "Topline\n\nMore than 140 women have signed onto a lawsuit in Boston as of Wednesday claiming a rheumatologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital sexually assaulted them by performing medically unnecessary pelvic, breast and rectal exams “for his own sexual gratification,” multiple outlets reported—though he has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nKey Facts\n\nContra\n\nDr. Charles Morris, the chief medical officer at Brigham and Women's, said in a statement that “providing high quality care in a safe environment is (the hospital’s) top priority. We deeply regret the harm this has caused to our patients and their families.” Charles River Medical Associates said in a statement to Forbes that the group was never made aware of \"any complaints from patients, staff, or any other physicians\" against Todd and that it is reaching out to patients who may have been impacted. \"We are disappointed and saddened by these disturbing allegations and recognize the courage it takes for these patients to come forward,\" the statement read. Ingrid Martin, the attorney representing Todd in connection with the Board of Registration in Medicine, said in an email to the Boston Globe that Todd “believes that he has done nothing wrong and will defend against it vigorously.”\n\nKey Background\n\nThe most recent lawsuit claims that Todd claimed to be providing primary care to his rheumatology patients when he performed \"inappropriate bodily examinations, practiced gynecological medicine in an unauthorized manner, and sexually assaulted patients.” One attorney told the Globe the exams sometimes occurred outside of normal business hours. A representative for Brigham and Women’s said two physicians raised concerns about Todd’s practice in April, which launched an internal investigation amid which the hospital ordered him not to perform sensitive exams without a chaperone. Todd was placed on administrative leave in July and then has his employment terminated. In August, the hospital began reaching out to patients \"whose care did not meet our standards\" and referred those with concerns to law enforcement. The hospital then reached out to all of Todd's active and former patients dating back to 2015. No criminal charges have been filed. Todd is also facing a civil malpractice lawsuit in Middlesex Superior Court in Massachusetts.\n\nBig Number\n\n862. That's how many physicians—less than 0.1% of all licensed in the U.S.—were disciplined by state medical boards for sexual misconduct between January of 2003 through September 2013, a study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found. The study found many cases of physician sexual abuse of patients go unreported, and \"hospitals and health care organizations regularly ignore or circumvent reporting requirements.\" A 2006 report found that two-thirds of all complaints against doctors have been closed by state medical boards because of inadequate evidence or lack of witnesses, the study said.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\"Astounding and inexcusable,\" More than 130 women now claim Dr. Derrick Todd sexually assaulted themFormer Brigham and Women's doctor faces allegations of inappropriate pelvic and breast exams - The Boston Globe ForbesOver 300 Alleged Sexual Abuse Victims Sue Columbia University-Claim Ex-Gynecologist Robert Hadden Is 'Most Prolific' Predator In N.Y.
