        "text": "Worcester native Benjamin Bergenholtz is the executive director of the Anthony Quinn Foundation and the curator of a world class art collection that Quinn amassed during his lifetime. Quinn, who died in 2000, was an acclaimed actor who won two Oscars. He also was a sculptor and a painter, and those who knew him say his first love was art.\n\nQuinn’s widow, Katherine Quinn, asked Bergenholtz to put together a traveling exhibition of some of the finest pieces in the collection. The exhibit, “Monumental Works,” consists of 18 sculptures, bronze bas reliefs and lithographs, as well as a series of sketches created by Quinn. It opened at the InterContinental Boston on Boston Harbor at the end of last month and will be on display through June. A brochure listing where all of the pieces are located in the hotel is available at the concierge desk.\n\nBergenholtz is a graduate of Worcester Academy and served for several years as the curator of the Worcester Historical Museum’s Salisbury Mansion.\n\n— Pamela H. Sacks"
