He said he tries to be conservative with the figures, because the goal isn’t to scare people but simply to use some type of data for a yearly comparison: “What I’m trying to do is create a number.”\n\nIn his report, Fogelman noted the e-scrap industry faces some unique challenges when it comes to fire danger. The level of worker training and worker safety measures can vary widely, and e-scrap companies face a constantly changing device stream, where they have to create custom processes for handling each new device. Fogelman contrasted this system with merchandise return systems, which “allow a specific manufacturer to control how they disassemble and reuse or dispose of their products’ components, specifically batteries.”\n\n“Regardless of the operators’ experience, recycling general electronics comes with many different processes, such as disassembly and removal of lithium-ion batteries in products, which exposes them to fire risks,” the report stated. “Unfortunately, operators performing this necessary function for society are often left to hold the bag with most of the risk and cost of fire dangers.”\n\nThe e-scrap facility fire increase ran counter to the overall trend of fewer recycling fires last year. Across all recycling facility types – including e-scrap, scrap metal, C&D debris, rubber and organics – 373 fires were reported by news media, down 4% year over year. And in materials recovery facilities and transfer stations, the trend was even more pronounced: 2023 brought 187 reported fires in these sites, down from 205 the prior year.\n\nThe general scrap metal sector saw a slight rise, reporting 116 fires, up from 112 the prior year.\n\nSo, the 2023 numbers are in, and the good news is that we had fewer reported fires in 2023 than in our prior high watermark hit in 2022. In 2023, it finally feels like the tide is turning. This is excellent because it seems to result from the steady adoption of Fire Rover solutions across North America at waste and recycling facilities. It feels like we have finally proven that the Fire Rover solution works!\n\nUnfortunately, the overall decrease in reported facility fires includes some…\n\nSo, the 2023 numbers are in, and the good news is that we had fewer reported fires in 2023 than in our prior high watermark hit in 2022. In 2023, it finally feels like the tide is turning. This is excellent because it seems to result from the steady adoption of Fire Rover solutions across North America at waste and recycling facilities. It feels like we have finally proven that the Fire Rover solution works!\n\nUnfortunately, the overall decrease in reported facility fires includes some increases within specific categories, and we cannot ignore the fact that the past three years have seen our highest numbers of reported fires at US and Canadian waste and recycling facilities since I began consolidating and reporting the data in 2016. But I hope that these reported fires will continue to decrease (even with the increasing threat of lithium-ion batteries in our waste and recycling streams) as the industry continues to improve operational performance, educate the public, and we see an increase in the investment in and utilization of solutions like Fire Rover.\n\nHere is to a better 2024. I hope we reach our goal of fewer \"major\" and \"catastrophic\" fires at our waste and recycling facilities.

When this was released, I was contacted by several of my waste and recycling industry colleagues, asking if I understood what the 600-page document was attempting to achieve. I reached out to one of my colleagues, fire engineer James “Andy” Lynch, and asked him if he was up to the challenge of reading the document and providing his opinion. Together, we used our expertise to share our thoughts around how this updated standard will affect the waste and recycling industry. Below, we highlight some of our feedback and insights on the proposed changes to this regulation.\n\nSummertime is nearly here.

By Duncan J. White\n\nRyan Fogelman is a man with a distinctive expertise in guiding inventors through the process of bringing their products to market. Despite not having a background in the fire industry, he has successfully collaborated with inventors to launch an array of safety products and consumer goods, including the Stick Grip, which has achieved extraordinary popularity, amassing approximately a billion views on the TikTok platform and COhatch, community-oriented coworking spaces that helps entrepreneurs bring their inventions to market.\n\nFogelman’s educational background includes a law degree and an MBA, which, coupled with his extensive focus on data analysis, reflects his dedication to rigorous analysis and strategic decision-making. While he possesses a wealth of knowledge in these areas, Fogelman primarily identifies as a business development professional.\n\nIt was through this professional network that Fogelman was approached in 2015 by a childhood friend, Brad Gladstone, who sought his assistance with their innovation known as Fire Rover, a remotely operated fire detection and suppression solution. Intrigued by the opportunity to work on ground-breaking technology, he joined the endeavour as part of Fire Rover’s first official employee.\n\n(NewsNation) — A recent fire at an Indiana recycling plant isn’t the only one of its kind — 2022 was the worst year for publicly reported fires at waste and recycling facilities in the U.S. and Canada, according to a new report.\n\nThe waste and recycling industry saw 390 fires last year, surpassing the average 326 annually since the report’s author Ryan Fogelman began collecting data in 2016.

Those 390 fires only represent the incidents that were publicly reported, which isn’t required in the U.S. Fogelman estimates the real number is closer to 2,000.\n\nFogelman is a partner at the fire suppression company Fire Rover, which sells a product that helps waste and recycling facilities detect and put out fires. The company publishes Fogelman’s research, which he said he conducts independently.\n\nFire Rover, a West Bloomfield, Michigan-based fire safety and suppression company, has reported that more facility fires occurred in 2022 than in previous years. The company reports there were about 390 fire incidents at material recovery facilities (MRFs) in 2022 compared with 367 in 2021.\n\nDuring a March 14 presentation hosted by the Arlington, Virginia-based National Waste & Recycling Association, Ryan Fogelman, vice president of strategic partnerships at Fire Rover, discussed data…\n\nFire Rover, a West Bloomfield, Michigan-based fire safety and suppression company, has reported that more facility fires occurred in 2022 than in previous years. The company reports there were about 390 fire incidents at material recovery facilities (MRFs) in 2022 compared with 367 in 2021.\n\nDuring a March 14 presentation hosted by the Arlington, Virginia-based National Waste & Recycling Association, Ryan Fogelman, vice president of strategic partnerships at Fire Rover, discussed data compiled in the company's sixth annual \"Reported Waste & Recycling Facility Fires US/CAN.\" He also discussed what businesses can do to mitigate the risk of fires.\n\n“In 2022, we had more fires than we’ve ever had [since we began putting this report together],” Fogelman said. “The data we’re tracking is based on reported incidents ... That’s a very, very conservative number.”\n\nLithium-ion batteries are causing fires everywhere. The New York City Fire Department reported “191 fires, 140 injuries, and six deaths from lithium-ion fires in the city.”\n\nAccording to a survey released by Material Focus in the UK1 in December 2022, “The results suggest batteries that have not been removed from unwanted electrical products cause more than 700 fires annually in refuse collection vehicles and at household waste recycling centers, while nearly 90% of the 60 local…\n\nLithium-ion batteries are causing fires everywhere. The New York City Fire Department reported “191 fires, 140 injuries, and six deaths from lithium-ion fires in the city.”\n\nAccording to a survey released by Material Focus in the UK1 in December 2022, “The results suggest batteries that have not been removed from unwanted electrical products cause more than 700 fires annually in refuse collection vehicles and at household waste recycling centers, while nearly 90% of the 60 local authorities surveyed said fires caused by batteries are ‘an increasing problem.’” The equivalent number of fires would be 4,200 fire incidents in the U.S., almost double the number of fire incidents I have been reporting based on my assumptions since 2016.\n\nSo, what took them so long? In 2017, based on my research, analysis, and unique position on the frontlines with Fire Rover, I was forecasting a wave of lithium-ion battery fires in waste streams due to several factors. In 2018, we saw that bump on a global scale. From 2019 until today, the leadership of the waste and recycling industry heard the call and took action to deal with these fires. These industrywide efforts included campaigns to educate the public on the dangers of lithium-ion batteries in the waste stream, operational best practices, and adopting innovative technologies like the Fire Rover.\n\nWith all the excitement surrounding lithium-ion batteries as the main culprit of fires, we cannot overlook that fire hazards stem from several factors in the waste and recycling industry. Most data show that batteries are responsible for about half of the fires in the waste and recycling streams managed at processing facilities. Other factors like accelerants, pressurized tanks, explosives, and more have long been causing fires at waste and recycling operations and cannot be overlooked.\n\nTHERE IS AN INHERENT RISK OF FIRES IN THE WASTE AND RECYCLING INDUSTRY!\n\nYou cannot read the news without hearing a story about a lithium-ion battery fire incident that occurred in a high-rise building, electronic vehicle (EV), laptop on an airplane, vape in someone's pocket, a fulfillment warehouse and, of course, in a waste and recycling facility.

So, how do we get a better grip on this problem? How do we continue to address the issues we are facing? How do we put solutions in place to prevent these incidents from getting out of hand?\n\nOur existing knowledge of fighting battery fires is not keeping pace with the hazards we are seeing. And that is just the firefighters.

What I mean by that specifically is that as lithium-ion batteries have become commonplace in our operations, the focus on fire prevention is now in full effect. The question is, are these strategies enough to turn the trends we are seeing in the other direction?\n\nAs the pandemic drags on, Central Ohio coworking companies are capitalizing on the realization that productivity comes in all shapes and sizes.\n\n“People want to stay close to home but also need to get to gather with others,” said Ryan Fogelman, co-founder of COhatch, the area’s largest coworking company.\n\nFogelman said employers need to figure out how best to meet the needs of employees and customers, whether that is traditional offices or coworking spaces.\n\n“Covid forced…\n\nAs the pandemic drags on, Central Ohio coworking companies are capitalizing on the realization that productivity comes in all shapes and sizes.\n\n“People want to stay close to home but also need to get to gather with others,” said Ryan Fogelman, co-founder of COhatch, the area’s largest coworking company.\n\nFogelman said employers need to figure out how best to meet the needs of employees and customers, whether that is traditional offices or coworking spaces.\n\n“Covid forced large companies to look at flex space,” he said.\n\n2021 is in the books, and I am putting the finishing touches on the “5th Annual Waste & Recycling Facility Fires Annual Report for the US and Canada.” This year’s report promises to be one for the ages as we officially experienced more reported fire incidents this year than we have since I began consolidating the data in 2016.\n\n2021 is in the books, and I am putting the finishing touches on the “5th Annual Waste & Recycling Facility Fires Annual Report for the US and Canada.” This year’s…\n\n2021 is in the books, and I am putting the finishing touches on the “5th Annual Waste & Recycling Facility Fires Annual Report for the US and Canada.” This year’s report promises to be one for the ages as we officially experienced more reported fire incidents this year than we have since I began consolidating the data in 2016.\n\n2021 is in the books, and I am putting the finishing touches on the “5th Annual Waste & Recycling Facility Fires Annual Report for the US and Canada.” This year’s report promises to be one for the ages as we officially experienced more reported fire incidents this year than we have since I began consolidating the data in 2016.

From March 2020 to March 2021, the waste and recycling industry has experienced 302 reported facility fires in the U.S. and Canada. Considering the amount of combustibles involved and the spark-producing equipment being used, today’s recyclers must be serious about fire safety and provide safety training so that their employees can identify hazards and prevent catastrophic outcomes that can result from facility fires.\n\nEvery industry faces fire risks, but in the waste and recycling industry, fires occur almost daily. These fires can spark from hazards such as pressurized tanks, chemicals, hot-work activities, fertilizers, cigarette butts and, an emerging culprit, lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries.

Ryan Fogelman, vice president of strategic partnerships for Fire Rover, keeps the most detailed public data on these incidents and said he's seen the clear start of a trend.\n\n\"Waste fires are up,\" said Fogelman in mid-July, pointing specifically to an uptick at waste and recycling facilities from March through June. In addition to the mounting issue of lithium-ion batteries the industry has been grappling with in recent years, Fogelman said this recent trend is likely due in part to a shift from commercial to residential volumes that may have a more varied stream of materials.\n\n\"We did the biggest spring cleaning we've ever done in our lives,\" he said, adding this was coupled with a significant uptick in volumes due to the initial wave of quarantine purchases, akin to levels normally only seen at the height of winter holiday season. \"Basically it was Christmas in April.\"\n\nJune is always a busy month for fires in waste and recycling facilities. June officially begins the “summertime spike” that we have been experiencing since I began tracking fire incidents in 2016.\n\nThis year is unique because June is not only the beginning of the summertime spike, but it is also the end to some stay-at-home orders initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic.

June officially begins the “summertime spike” that we have been experiencing since I began tracking fire incidents in 2016.\n\nThis year is unique because June is not only the beginning of the summertime spike, but it is also the end to some stay-at-home orders initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic. In June, the industry incurred 34 reported fire incidents at our waste and recycling facilities. Similar to years past, scrap metal fire incidents have stayed at 35% of the total number of fire incidents for the month. But also in keeping with the trends we have been seeing due to the pandemic, solid waste fire incidents are up as a percent of the total number.\n\nMay started with doom and gloom that we were never going to get out of this pandemic. But as the weeks went on, we started to see a light at the end of the tunnel. In May, many “non-essential” businesses started reopening, joining their waste and recycling industry brethren back to the daily grind. During the month, we experienced 28 reported fire incidents at waste and recycling facilities.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the art and science of thermography for early fire detection…\n\nMay started with doom and gloom that we were never going to get out of this pandemic.

In May, many “non-essential” businesses started reopening, joining their waste and recycling industry brethren back to the daily grind. During the month, we experienced 28 reported fire incidents at waste and recycling facilities.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the art and science of thermography for early fire detection of waste and recycling operations, I had a conversation with Andy Starnes, a level II electrical thermography certified instructor at Insight Fire Training.\n\nStarnes has been an instructor and a captain for almost 22 years, with special experience and education involving the use of infrared and thermal technologies and fire applications. He is a thermal imaging subject matter expert who assists fire departments, industry and thermal imaging manufacturers with thermal education and training.\n\nIn our latest episode of NothingWasted!, we chat with Ryan Fogelman, VP of Strategic Partnerships at Fire Rover.

I think we all can agree that this April dragged out for obvious reasons.\n\nWe experienced 25 reported fire incidents at waste and recycling facilities during the month.

I think we all can agree that this April dragged out for obvious reasons.\n\nWe experienced 25 reported fire incidents at waste and recycling facilities during the month. We experienced an unusual phenomenon that we have not seen in the past – specifically that the first week of April had only one reported fire incident. The final remaining 24 incidents occurred in the final 21 days of the month. This was more than one reported fire incident per day.\n\nThe main cause of these fires is lithium-ion batteries, which we delve into deeply with my special guest this month, Ronald Butler.\n\nWhat a month it has been. History tells us that March is supposed to be in like a lion and out like a lamb. The complete inverse has been true for March 2020. This month will go down in the history books as the beginning of the U.S. and Canadian fight against COVID-19.\n\nWe began the month with our employment rate low, our economy churning and the stock market at all-time highs.

History tells us that March is supposed to be in like a lion and out like a lamb. The complete inverse has been true for March 2020. This month will go down in the history books as the beginning of the U.S. and Canadian fight against COVID-19.\n\nWe began the month with our employment rate low, our economy churning and the stock market at all-time highs. Contrast that to April, as we walk into more than 4 million-plus unemployment applications, the market down 30 to 40 percent and the economy facing its worst recession threat since the financial crisis. The most concerning part is that experts are at each other’s throats as they debate and philosophize where they believe we are headed as we walk into the heart of the election year.\n\nIn March, we saw 18 fire incidents at waste and recycling facilities. That is not a bad number on its face, but my belief is that there are some unique issues caused by the effects of the COVID-19 fight, especially on the waste side of the industry. In this article, I will thoroughly address those specifics.\n\nFires are not a new threat for the recycling industry, says Ryan Fogelman, vice president for strategic partnerships at Fire Rover, a company that makes fire prevention systems for industrial sites, including waste and recycling facilities. What’s changing is the frequency, he says. The number of fires at waste facilities across the United States and Canada increased by 26 percent from 2016 to 2019 — from 272 reported fires to 343, respectively — Fogelman finds in his 2019 annual waste and…\n\nFires are not a new threat for the recycling industry, says Ryan Fogelman, vice president for strategic partnerships at Fire Rover, a company that makes fire prevention systems for industrial sites, including waste and recycling facilities. What’s changing is the frequency, he says. The number of fires at waste facilities across the United States and Canada increased by 26 percent from 2016 to 2019 — from 272 reported fires to 343, respectively — Fogelman finds in his 2019 annual waste and recycling facility fires report, which was published on February 25th. Fires are largely underreported, however, and Fogelman estimates that there were actually around 1,800 fires at waste facilities in 2019.\n\nIn 2019, fires in waste facilities were up 13 percent over 2018 and 12 percent over the three-year average from 2016 to 2018. We also saw large percentage increases in paper—17 percent over 2018 numbers and 30 percent above the 2016 to 2018 numbers. Rubber, which had fallen in 2018, was back to typical levels. And electronics recycling, which has seen an increasing footprint due to the need for these series, was up from years prior.

And electronics recycling, which has seen an increasing footprint due to the need for these series, was up from years prior. My guess is that we are going to see these fires increase as the capacity for these services continue to grow. These fire increases are due heavily to the continued influx of lithium-ion batteries into our waste and recycling streams.\n\nFortunately, metals fires, which still account for almost a third of total fire incidents over the past four years, were down 45 percent from 2018 and down 2 percent over the average of 2016 to 2018. We hope that 2018 was an aberration for the metal recyclers, but only time will tell. Chemicals were down in 2019, which is good news as their fires tend to be major.\n\nIf you had time to read last month’s article, I focused on a core tenant that “Safety should not know competition.” There are certain partners that I have worked with over the years, but no one lives by this tenant better than Michael Csapo, the general manager of the Resource Recovery and Recycling Authority of Southwest Oakland County (RRRASOC), Mich.\n\nFire hazards\n\nLocal news reports from 2019 are rife with stories of MRF fires, ranging from merely disruptive to highly destructive, and operators are increasingly concerned.\n\nAccording to Fire Rover, which tracks detailed data on U.S. waste and recycling facility fires, there have been an estimated 1,800 industry fires within the past year. MRFs are a sizable part of that, given the frequency with which they’re seeing lithium-ion batteries, propane tanks and other hazardous items.

MRFs are a sizable part of that, given the frequency with which they’re seeing lithium-ion batteries, propane tanks and other hazardous items. For Ryan Fogelman, Fire Rover’s vice president of strategic partnerships, this emphasizes the importance of having detection and prevention equipment.\n\n“There’s an inherent risk to fires in our business. We have to be prepared to put them out before the fire department arrives,” he said, noting the value of enabling workers to use heavier duty solutions beyond standard extinguishers that require close contact.\n\nWhile the majority of these fires don’t lead to serious injury, Fogelman did note one worker who died following an explosion at a waste-related ethanol site in Georgia this year.\n\nDuring the past 12 months, the waste and recycling industry has experienced 337 reported facility fires in the U.S. and Canada. Based on reasonable assumptions, we can extrapolate that 1,800-plus facility ﬁres have occurred during that time, which, based on the number of facilities reported by Environmental Research & Education Foundation (EREF), is more than 40 percent of the industry.

I define “reported facility fires” as any fire that has been reported by the media that occurs at a waste or recycling facility in the U.S. and Canada. Typically, the fires that are reported by the media are larger fires that require fire professionals to arrive on scene and where there are affects that the public can witness.\n\nLast year saw a spike in fires at waste and recycling plants across the United States and Canada. One expert tracking them, Fire Rover’s Ryan Fogelman, found a 93% increase in the number of blazes compared with the same time period in 2017.\n\nRecycling Plant Fires Continue to Surge\n\nThis month alone, the FDNY responded to a fire on the first floor of a paper recycling plant on Staten Island, crews battled a stubborn blaze at a recycling plant in Calgary that lacked a nearby hydrant, and…\n\nLast year saw a spike in fires at waste and recycling plants across the United States and Canada.

Pete Keller, vice president of recycling and sustainability at Republic Services, told the magazine that the loose, dry material in a recycling setting is dangerous. “We’ve seen an increase in incidents where we have a fire and the cause of origin is lithium-ion batteries,” he added.\n\nFogelman also called the rising use of lithium-ion batteries a large challenge for the waste and recycling industry in an annual report on fires published this year.\n\n“These batteries are small enough to get into cracks and screens and cause issues from drop-off to finished product, and at this point, they’re not only causing increased fire incidents at material recycling facilities, but also at construction and demolition, scrap metal, paper, and plastic recycling operations,” he wrote.\n\nAfter coming off a January high of 27 facility fires, we experienced only 13 reported fire incidents in February. Last February, we experienced 23 reported fire incidents, so this is a significant decline anyway you look at it. We haven’t seen a month with fire incidents this low since we experienced the same number in April 2017.

We haven’t seen a month with fire incidents this low since we experienced the same number in April 2017. Although this is great news, and we are all hopeful this is a trend that will continue, it is an interesting time to reflect on the positive changes the waste and recycling industry has implemented since the focus on fires in the industry has grown. The good news is that waste and recycling companies, both large and small, are developing fire plans, educating their employees and investing in the newest technology to combat the increase in fire risks we face as an industry.\n\nEvery insurance company has different ways of assessing risk. They look at both the risk of the industry as a whole as well as your company’s specific risk. From an industry perspective there is not much an insured can do to change the insurance company’s view of the industry’s risk, but there are several ways to increase the insurance company’s faith in the risk mitigation of your operations which can lead to more favorable premiums.

Even sources like Statista, a large online data consolidator, show no results when searching for “recycling” or “waste” fires.\n\nSo, since the beginning of 2016, I have been consolidating the Reported Waste & Recycling Facility Fires In The US & CAN. (Source: https://www.linkedin.com/post/edit/how-many-recycling-fireshave-occurred-us-canada-within-ryan-fogelman) My initial goal was to develop a solid understanding of the problem as it relates to the rest of the industry. Based on my research, it has become clear that running a Waste & Recycling Facility has a number of hazards that cannot be 100% mitigated through operational procedures alone.\n\nFires have been a dangerous hazard in waste and recycling facilities for decades, but new research from Fire Rover Vice President of Business Development Ryan Fogelman allows us to learn more about the extent of the problem in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nWaste and recycling facility fires can be caused for a variety of reasons, some of them more preventable than others.

Other than being dangerous to the workers at these facilities, they can cause unwanted shutdowns and greatly decrease the efficiency with which the facilities can process material.\n\nFor the last two years, Fogelman has been collecting data on these incidents, presenting his findings in the 2017 edition of “Reported Waste & Recycling Facility Fires in the U.S. & Canada.” The report is an attempt to provide the waste and recycling industry with a baseline of information to assist in the understanding of what Fogelman calls an epidemic of fires.\n\nThere were 289 reported facility fires in the United States and Canada in 2017, according to a report from Fire Rover VP of business development Ryan Fogelman. He points out, though, that the number of unreported fires in facilities across the U.S. and Canada is likely \"significant.\"\n\nAt least three fatalities and eight direct injuries resulted from facility fires.

By comparison, Fire Rover reported \"at least\" 282 fires in 2016. 40% of the fires occurred at solid waste facilities, with the second most (31%) coming from metals facilities.\n\nFogelman's two biggest recommendations, according to the report and an interview with Waste Dive, are investing in proper technology and advancing consumer education. The technology should be able to prevent, mitigate or respond to active fires and \"incidents.\" Education helps make incoming loads cleaner and easier to sort, so as to be less likely to create \"a bulge in the backend\" that can be a fire risk.\n\n“If there’s little activity in a building, it’s easy to detect smoke and heat. However, when there’s a lot of activity, such as what occurs in a waste and recycling facility, detecting smoke and heat becomes a really complex problem,” he explains. “Fire Rover is a solution to that problem, as it’s capable of detecting a fire early via its thermal technology and video surveillance system and then having a Fire Rover agent verify if it’s a false positive or if it’s a threat and action needs to be…\n\n“If there’s little activity in a building, it’s easy to detect smoke and heat. However, when there’s a lot of activity, such as what occurs in a waste and recycling facility, detecting smoke and heat becomes a really complex problem,” he explains. “Fire Rover is a solution to that problem, as it’s capable of detecting a fire early via its thermal technology and video surveillance system and then having a Fire Rover agent verify if it’s a false positive or if it’s a threat and action needs to be taken.”\n\nIf action needs to be taken, the Fire Rover agent alerts the facility, the fire department and authorities and then shoots an environmentally friendly cooling agent from the Fire Rover’s nozzles onto the hot spot to eliminate a fire before or after it starts. The Fire Rover can shoot for 8 to 10 minutes (and has options to increase the time when needed), allowing time for fire professionals to arrive on scene and assist with putting out the fire if needed.\n\n“To date, our solution has eliminated more than 500 fires in waste and recycling facilities across the U.S. and Canada,” says Fogelman. “It can be used both indoors and outdoors and just needs internet and electricity for installation.”"
