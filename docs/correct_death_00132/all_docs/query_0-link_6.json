        "text": "BOSTON -- Actor Anthony Quinn, the two-time Academy Award winning movie star known for his portrayal of earthy characters with a zest for life, died on Sunday in a Boston hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said. He was 86.\n\nThe spokeswoman at Brigham and Women's hospital told reporters he died at 9:29 a.m. but declined to give further information.\n\nBorn in Mexico in 1915, Quinn won two Academy Awards for best supporting actor, one for his 1952 role as a Mexican revolutionary in \"Viva Zapata!\" and another four years later for his portrayal of the French painter Paul Gauguin in the film \"Lust for Life.\"\n\nQuinn was best known for his memorable portrayal of the title character in Zorba the Greek (1964). For Quinn, Zorba was far more than just a film role.\n\n\"I am Zorba,\" Quinn once said of the hero of the movie, a worldly wise Greek who lived life to the fullest.\n\nLike Zorba, Quinn's life was painted on a broad canvas, ranging from an impoverished childhood in Mexico and Los Angeles to the pampered luxury of a Hollywood star.\n\nAnthony Rudolph Oaxaca Quinn was born on April 21, 1915, in Chihuahua, Mexico, where his half-Irish father Francisco (Frank) Quinn had married a Mexican girl of Aztec Indian ancestry, Manuela, while fighting for revolutionary leader Pancho Villa.\n\nThe family moved to El Paso, Texas, and three years later to Los Angeles in search of work. Quinn was raised in a poor district of Los Angeles and never forgot his past.\n\nAs a teen-ager, he underwent minor tongue surgery to improve his speech and afterwards took voice lessons at a Los Angeles drama school, paying the fee by cleaning windows and floors. He began appearing in stage productions at 18.\n\nMae West gave Quinn his first big chance on stage in the play Clean Beds which she financed and produced. His part was a take-off of John Barrymore, then an aging actor fading from the limelight.\n\nQuinn's first screen role -- a 45-second appearance -- came in the film Parole in 1936.\n\nHe later went on to appear in such movies as Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Guns of Navarone (1961) and La Strada (1954).\n\n\"To me, acting ... (is) living,\" he once said. \"I love to live, so I live. I love to act, so I act. I gotta have vitality.\"\n\nThe 39 Best Shows on Max (aka HBO Max) Right Now\n\nHouse of the Dragon, The Sopranos, and Fantasmas are just a few of the shows you need to be watching on Max this month.\n\nThe 46 Best Movies on Netflix Right Now\n\nHit Man, Under Paris, and Godzilla Minus One are just a few of the movies you should watch on Netflix this month.\n\nThe 21 Best Movies on Apple TV+ Right Now\n\nFancy Dance, Argylle, Mad Max: Fury Road, and Blade Runner 2049 are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Apple TV+ this month.\n\nThe 29 Best Movies on Hulu This Week\n\nOrigin, Anchorman, and Fight Club are just a few of the movies you need to watch on Hulu right now.\n\nThe 28 Best Movies on Max (aka HBO Max) Right Now\n\nMad Max, Stop Making Sense, and Dune are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Max this month.\n\nThe 29 Best Shows on Apple TV+ Right Now\n\nConstellation, Presumed Innocent, and a Steve Martin documentary are among the best shows on Apple TV+ this month.\n\nThe 35 Best Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nThe Boys, My Lady Jane, and Fallout are just a few of the shows you should be watching on Amazon Prime Video this week.\n\nThe 19 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nThe Idea of You, Road House, and American Fiction are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Amazon Prime Video this week."
