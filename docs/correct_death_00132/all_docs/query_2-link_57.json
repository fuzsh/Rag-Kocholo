        "text": "Katherine Quinn is the widow of legendary actor and artist, Anthony Quinn. From 1985 until his death in 2001, she worked very closely with Quinn in his creative life as a painter, sculptor, and writer. They had two children together – Antonia (29) and Ryan (26) and moved to Bristol, Rhode Island in 1994.\n\nTo carry on his legacy, Katherine established the Anthony Quinn Foundation in 2007, dedicated to promoting the importance of the arts in all areas of education. To date, the Foundation has awarded scholarships to 129 high school students from across the U.S. and abroad. With the Foundation, Katherine organizes exhibitions and private tours of Anthony Quinn’s creative body of work as a way to inspire others to explore their creative potential.\n\nKatherine was born and raised in Long Island, New York, and graduated from SUNY Stony Brook with a B.A. in Political Science. She currently resides in Bristol, Rhode Island where she curates and manages Anthony’s extensive art collection as well as the day-to-day operations of the Anthony Quinn Foundation."
