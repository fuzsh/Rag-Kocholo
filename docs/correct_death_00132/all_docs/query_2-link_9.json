        "text": "Francesco Quinn, son of legendary Oscar winner Anthony Quinn, died Friday night near his Malibu home. The actor, 48, was reportedly running in the street with his son Max when he collapsed, according to a neighbor who attempted to revive him.\n\n“There was a moment where we thought that we were making progress, that we started to sense that this could work,” neighbor Tim Lawrence told Malibu Patch. “We were working feverishly at it. But at a certain point it turned, and there was no response.”\n\nParamedics came to the scene, but Quinn was pronounced dead at the hospital, the local Patch site reports.\n\nFrancesco was born in Rome on March 22, 1963, to Anthony Quinn and his second wife, Iolanda. He had a role in Oliver Stone’s 1986 Oscar-winning film Platoon, as drug dealer Rhah. He later appeared in several TV shows, including The Young and the Restless, NCIS, ER and 24."
