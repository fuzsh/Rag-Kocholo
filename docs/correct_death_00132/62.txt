Multi-faceted actor Anthony Quinn has died. CNN says that Quinn died over the weekend at a hospital in Boston. He had been in Brigham and Women's Hospital for more than two weeks, suffering from pneumonia and respiratory failure. In addition to a full acting career on both the stage and in Hollywood, he fathered 13 children. He was an actor of great range whose personal appearance made it possible for him to play a variety of ethnic characters. He was born in Mexico. As a boy his family moved to Los Angeles. He worked hard at odd jobs as a butcher, a street corner preacher and as a boxer. He won a scholarship to study architecture under Frank Lloyd Wright, with whom he maintained a long friendship until Wright's death. His best-remembered films of the 100 he made include "The Guns of Navarone," "Viva Zapata" and "The Shoes of the Fisherman." It's tough to think of him without whistling the theme from "Zorba the Greek."

BROADWAY'S 'PRODUCERS' SWEEPS TONY AWARDS

Mel Brooks' "The Producers" took home a record 12 American Theatre Wing Tony Awards Sunday night. Early predications that the show would break the 1964 "Hello Dolly" record of 10 proved to be correct. "The Producers" took eight of the first 10 awards handed out. The Broadway smash hit -- based on the Mel Brooks' 1968 movie -- had a record 15 nominations. Brooks was nearly choked with emotion in accepting the major award for Best Musical. Both Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick were up for Best Actor in a Musical. Lane won, but brought his co-star to the podium for his acceptance speech. The awards were broadcast on CBS.

RICK SCHRODER LEAVES NYPD BLUE

After weeks of speculation, word comes that Rick Schroder is leaving "NYPD Blue." People magazine says the former "Silver Spoons" star, who was not in the police drama's season finale, wants to spend more time with family. Schroder said in a statement: "The long hours required to shoot 'NYPD Blue' would prevent me from being where I really want to be at this time -- which is with my family." He and his wife are reportedly expecting their fourth child. The publication says that Mark-Paul Gosselaar is scheduled to join the cast next fall and help fill the void left by Schroder's character, Det. Danny Sorenson.

'SURVIVOR' COLLEEN SPEAKS ON HOLLYWOOD

Colleen Haskell, the former member of the "Survivor" cast featured in the new Rob Schneider release "The Animal", isn't completely comfortable with Hollywood just yet. The former University of Georgia student was doing promotion in her home state recently and told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: "I've met so many people and I don't know where they are coming from and why they are the way they are. It's bizarre. People get in Hollywood and act different than how they've been raised. There are just weird people out there. They think life revolves around movies." Colleen, who now lives in Los Angeles, told the publication that she enjoys making movies, but would like to someday publish some work she's been doing on children's literature.

UPI DAILY SURVEY QUESTION NO. 96

This question is inspired by an experience I had last night. I recently received a box of tapes of classic radio dramas. Among them was a RADIO version of the movie "It's A Wonderful Life," with most of the original cast. It was done on the Lux Radio Theatre. For decades that program did one-hour radio versions of movies, with as much of the original cast as possible. At the end I found myself sobbing, just as I do every time I see the movie. So, in the light of that, here is today's question: "Are you able to sob during movies? Are you the kind of person easily moved by drama, music or theater?" Put EMOTION in the subject line and send to [email protected]:[email protected] the Internet.

RESULTS OF UPI DAILY SURVEY QUESTION NO. 91 (MEMORIAL)

A week ago we asked our readers to share some of their memories of Memorial Days past. Here are some of the replies: Debbie wrote to say that she likes Memorial Day for a reason most of us would not think of -- it's her birthday. When it fell on a weekday "I got the day off from school." Peggy was in her high school band and remembers taking part in the annual memorial service at the town cemetery ... flags waving, guns going off, politicians making speeches. She says that some of her band members would then volunteer to play songs at smaller cemeteries. LouBabe says: "My mother is our "tour guide" (at cemeteries) and points out every great-great uncle and aunt's grave. I don't think there's an ancestor clear back to the 1800s that my mother doesn't know a lot about his (or her) personal life." Ray remembers people selling red commemorative poppies in front of a grocery store. "My mother would always buy some of the flowers and give them to me. Sometimes I got lucky and the person selling the flowers gave me a small American flag. BINGO! That made it a wonderful day." Great thought, Ray. I remember visiting the cemetery in Loogootee, Ind., and seeing aging veterans in odd-looking uniforms. They were a few of the living veterans from the Spanish-American War.
