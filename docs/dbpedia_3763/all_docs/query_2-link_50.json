Since that book appeared I have been privileged to take part in many events organized to discuss issues related to Arab media, in Abu Dhabi, Alexandria, Amman, Beirut, Cairo, Doha, Ramallah, Sharjah, Tangiers and Washington, not to mention a large number in London and other European cities. Again, I owe a debt to the organizers and other participants in these gatherings, who cannot all be mentioned by name. The magnitude of my debt will be apparent in the endnotes to this volume. Reference is also made in the endnotes to those who kindly agreed to be interviewed. I wish here to acknowledge and thank everyone who shared information and opinions with me, whether with me individually or with a larger audience, and whether they did so on or off the record. This book was written in rather different circumstances from its predecessor, for which I am very pleased to thank senior colleagues in the School of Media, Arts and Design at the University of Westminster. I have been inspired, encouraged and supported in various ways by Sally Feldman, Peter Goodwin, Annette Hill, Jean Seaton, Colin Sparks and Daya Thussu. Philippa Brewster, Commissioning Editor for Film and Visual Culture at I.B.Tauris, played a big part in making the book happen and in its taking the shape it has. I value her wise input tremendously.

To try to resolve this, I have followed my previous practice of distinguishing between primary and secondary sources. Thus interviews, internal reports, newspaper and magazine articles, press releases, speeches and talks count as primary sources, which are cited in full in the endnotes but are not repeated in the bibliography – even in the case of some particularly insightful and weighty pieces by journalists, the rationale being that these provide data at more or less first hand. Books, monographs, conference papers, journal articles, academic theses and published reports are cited in both the endnotes and the bibliography. In this way full-length printed conference papers, dated by month and year, are distinguished from remarks made at conferences. The latter appear only in the endnotes, but with the day, month and year. Increasing availability of online sources raises other issues, both particular and general, regarding source citation. Transnational Broadcasting Studies is an indispensable source for research on Arab television. It existed exclusively online until 2005, when a hard-copy version was also produced. Citations reflect this, with the online journal referred to simply as tbsjournal.com and the printed journal by its full name and new numbering system. Journalistic reports and interviews from the online journal are fully referenced in the endnotes only. To avoid the technical problems caused by including the http://www prefix in online addresses, these are replaced with the words ‘Online at’. Although I consider it redundant to give the date of access for sources that are part of a recognized archive, I have given this date for ix\n\nx\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\ncontent that may be taken down or moved. There is little to say about transliteration, because it follows a very simplified and occasionally irregular system that mostly respects existing styles adopted by people and companies for transliterating their own names. This means that, for example, the apostrophe is sometimes used to indicate a hamza but may also occasionally represent the letter ain.\n\n1\n\nPublicity Machine or Complex Industry? For a phenomenon characterized by ever increasing diversity and contradictions, the epithet ‘Arab television’ may imply an undue sense of coherence. It is a favourite refrain of many commentators that the number of Arab television channels now runs into hundreds. It only runs into hundreds for television viewers with satellite access, but today in many parts of the Arab region such access is the norm. In countries like Algeria, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, 90 per cent or more of television households are able to receive satellite channels. The same applies to more than half of television households in Syria and Jordan, and in Morocco and Egypt the level of penetration is approaching half.1 That is to say: at any given moment, a member of those households can zap through dozens of channels showing a seemingly endless array of drama, music, feature films, game shows, talk shows, documentaries, cartoons, sports, religious guidance, all types of news and all manner of current affairs. To someone watching so many varieties of ‘Arab television’ it may seem reductive to apply this single heading to a landscape crowded with national and pan-Arab players, involved in public and private companies, producing and transmitting information and entertainment. Too often, casual comment on the state of ‘Arab television’ is prone to sweeping generalizations driven by value judgements about taste and decency, relevance or political bias. This book, far from underestimating the range of content now on offer or the strong reactions it provokes, starts from a recognition that this range has major significance in terms of representation and social interaction in a group of countries where multiple injustices and grievances, felt deeply over generations, have given rise to intractable current-day policy dilemmas. As part of acknowledging this 1\n\n2\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\ncomplexity, the book seeks to draw out strands of development in Arab terrestrial and satellite broadcasting that can be examined on the basis of evidence, to see what they reveal about struggles for control. With that aim, it is plausible to take a broad view of Arab television as an interconnected set of cultural industries, where production and exchange takes place across a market circumscribed not by tariffs or jurisdiction but by language. To take such an approach is to lay open the possibility that development of more complex and differentiated social and economic relations in the industry might entail shifts in power over public communication and cultural expression. Raymond Williams has charted the ‘long period of overlap between patronal and market social relations’ in cultural production in parts of Europe, noting that there is ‘great practical complexity in the various stages of transition between these essentially alternative relationships’ and that modern forms of patronage are ‘common in advanced capitalist societies’.2 There is some agreement among Arab analysts that the arrival of satellite channels did not in itself rupture the relations of patronage that had previously dominated the region’s television output. A changing system of ownership, in which some owners were nominally private, did not immediately hand market power to consumers or to cultural producers and other professionals. It has been said of the socalled ‘new’ Arab media in recent years that they are ‘still effectively dealing with one consumer’, namely the head of state,3 and that they are ‘appendages of the ruling political and economic order in the Arab world, not challenges to it’.4 There is a view that the satellite stations ‘are detached from any broader history’, having been created as an ‘instant weapon’ at the time of the 1991 Gulf War without any accompanying legislation to oversee their independence.5 These observations are in line with the finding that governments in the region still had the upper hand in the evolution of Arab satellite television a decade after it took off.6 But the story continues. A further phase of expansion, which started in 2000–01 and gathered momentum in 2004, raised questions as to whether new paymasters or intermediaries were emerging, whose dealings would introduce new forms of patronage or stimulate market relations on a scale sufficient to erode the ruler-dependent patronage of the status quo. Such questions can be addressed in various ways. One is to consider whether any new institutions and interest groups, which may have\n\nP U BL IC I T Y M AC H I N E OR C OM PL E X I N DU S T RY ?\n\n3\n\nformed in parallel with television ownership diversification, served to reinforce a process of de-linking or differentiation between the television industry and the state.7 To uncover such a process requires scrutiny on several levels. Studies have shown that the challenge of promoting media content that is independent of governments, political forces and business is not best served by drawing simplistic distinctions between market and state.8 The meaning of the state’s role in television ownership and regulation differs between situations where electorates can change governments at regular intervals and those where they cannot. Yet a tendency towards ownership concentration in all television markets means that even systems of democratic accountability do not always succeed in protecting the broadcast media against de-differentiation or refeudalization, in the form of encroaching domination and incorporation by a single force. The strength of safeguards may depend on political visions of the audiovisual market, as demonstrated by contrasting British and French routes to marketization during the 1980s–90s.9 It may, as demonstrated by Silvio Berlusconi’s dual roles as Italian prime minister and television magnate, be put to the test by personal ambition.10 For Arab television, the subject of enquiry at this point is not whether the grip of powerful political or economic forces is tightening, but the reverse. It is tempting, for example, to regard the rise of new kinds of broadcaster, new satellite platforms, licensing commissions, independent production houses, professional alliances, audience research agencies, advertisers’ trade associations, training bodies, media watch groups, and organizations advocating media freedom as evidence of formal and informal institutions putting down separate roots and establishing autonomous platforms for articulating shared or conflicting interests. Where such interests impinge on ownership patterns or controls on content, interesting possibilities would seem to exist for developments in the television industry to contribute to a process of differentiation between media and ruling elites. Later chapters of this book explore big changes and small adjustments taking place in various parts of the television industry. Chapter 2 tracks the new paymasters who have benefited from a changing licensing regime and considers whether a more liberal approach to licences has been matched by a relaxation of censorship. Chapter 3 highlights divergent trends in television journalism and evaluates the\n\n4\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\nsupport mechanisms available to journalists facing unfamiliar types of pressure. Chapter 4 probes the stimuli that have propelled women to prominent positions on screen and assesses how far the medium of television has lent itself to constructive public discussion of gender equality. Chapter 5 compares advantages and disadvantages of developments in entertainment programming in terms of the medium-term outlook for indigenous production, and Chapter 6 does likewise for other programme categories, especially news, sport and various genres of television talk. Issues of sustainability, thrown up by these chapters, are carried over into Chapter 7, where leading television companies’ strategies on expansion, branding, revenue diversification and location are discussed. Chapter 7’s conclusion pulls together strands from preceding chapters to answer the question posed in this introduction, as to whether the growing complexity of institutions and interest groups who play a part in Arab television has opened the way to increasing independence from forces that were traditionally dominant. Before proceeding to these elements of the investigation, the next step in this introductory chapter is to analyse the nature of the industry’s recent expansion. It is proposed to look first at the proliferation of channels and then at the potential for devolution of power in terms of the players and resources involved. Changes in the landscape, 2000–06 From a distance, it might seem reasonable to categorize new entrants to the Arab television landscape according to three pre-defined contrasting approaches to the business of broadcasting. In a dual-product model, in which advertising revenue finances content, television owners supply programmes to viewers as a means of supplying viewers to advertisers, in the sense that audiences form a potential market for items to be advertised in programme breaks.11 Advertisers’ interests can then influence programme development and scheduling on the basis of demographic calculations about viewers’ ages, purchasing power and daily leisure time, with programmes responding to some themes of public interest but not others.12 In television globally, there are two obvious alternatives to this model. On the one hand, based on a distinction in status between consumer and citizen, is the possibility of addressing television audiences not as a market but as a public with an exhaustive range of information needs.13 On the other is the\n\nP U BL IC I T Y M AC H I N E OR C OM PL E X I N DU S T RY ?\n\n5\n\ndistinction between satisfying market demand and satisfying demand for favourable publicity on the part of prominent political figures. As the broadcast equivalent of vanity publishing, loss-making television that caters neither to citizen nor to consumer but to the perceived self-interest of those with deep enough pockets is primarily concerned with organizing information so as to suppress or disseminate particular messages. Arab television channels launched during the first phase of expansion in the 1990s seemed to fit at least the first and third of these categories in some respects. Lebanon’s privately owned LBC is often cited in comparisons of leading channels as the most market-oriented and intent on making profit. Sebouh Alavanthian, its head of programming, implied strong conformity to the dual-product model at a conference in 2002. Describing LBC’s expansion into satellite transmission as a leap into the unknown, Alavanthian stressed the need to know ‘viewers’ expectations’, to receive ‘daily feedback’, and to establish a ‘direct, clear, daily rating system’.14 The Middle East Broadcasting Centre (MBC), on the other hand, followed the favourable publicity model closely enough for some observers to joke that its initials stood for ‘My Broadcasting Company’.15 ‘My’ in this case referred to Saudi Arabia’s late King Fahd, who is believed to have helped his brother-inlaw launch MBC in a private capacity to further the political aims of certain members of the kingdom’s ruling elite.16 At the same time, however, other channels displayed the potential for overlap between the three models. It was clear, for example, from the high price of its subscriptions and from statements in its promotional literature that the Saudi-owned pay-TV network Orbit aimed, from its launch in 1994, to meet the needs of what its management saw as a niche market of affluent professionals. Samir Abdulhadi, the network’s chief executive, confirmed in 2002 that this was still the case, when he described Orbit as a ‘commercial business and not a public service enterprise’.17 Yet Orbit was the first to experiment, in 1994– 96, with Arabic-language news programming commissioned from a public-service source, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Al-Jazeera was created in 1996 with a mission to become self-financing within five years, through advertising sales based on expectations of healthy viewing figures. When its failure on this count exposed the politicized nature of advertising sales in Arab television, Qatar’s ruler,\n\n6\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\nSheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, continued to finance it anyway, portraying this decision as a public service consistent with Qatar’s project of turning itself into a parliamentary democracy.18 Al-Jazeera’s managing director at the time acknowledged that ‘Al-Jazeera brings the government non-financial benefits’.19 But these benefits appeared compatible with a model of state-funded broadcasting that Qatari officials regularly likened to the BBC. Meanwhile, early expansion into satellite broadcasting by the Egyptian Radio and Television Union (ERTU) lacked the attributes of being either a commercial enterprise or a public service, creating a situation at odds with its public funding. With its cumulative deficit of £E4 billion ($690 million) in 2004, increasing at a rate of £E800 million ($138 million) per year20 despite preferential access to advertising revenue, the ERTU was slow to seek financial recovery by enhancing its appeal or usefulness to viewers. Hassan Hamed, who was later to become the organization’s chief executive, said as head of the ERTU’s Nile News: ‘Ours is still official news. We have to weigh things very carefully.’ 21 The practice of weighing things very carefully appeared to explain subsequent delays and omissions in ERTU channels’ coverage of local events that might reflect negatively on the Egyptian government. An ERTU official rationalized the use of public funds to pay for pro-government publicity when she told two Egyptian reporters, ‘TV is state-owned and thus represents the views and policies of the government.’ 22 The proliferation of television stations that took place from 2000 onwards brought with it a further blurring of missions along with more intricate permutations of patronal and market relationships underlying sources of finance. In part, the expansion and diversification was facilitated by Egyptian state investment in Nilesat, the company created to give Egypt its own platform for transmission as an alternative to the pan-Arab but Saudi-dominated Arabsat fleet. Nilesat, presented from the outset as a public–private partnership that would more than cover its costs, had a commercial incentive to lease its satellite transponder slots to the largest possible number of newcomers to regional broadcasting. For small broadcasters, this option was attractive not only for its low cost but also because shared space on a transponder reduced the likelihood of a single operator’s uplinks being cut for censorship reasons, because of potential harm to other leaseholders on the same\n\nP U BL IC I T Y M AC H I N E OR C OM PL E X I N DU S T RY ?\n\n7\n\ntransponder. Nilesat accounts showed a sharp rise in revenue during the first four years after Nilesat 101 was launched in 1998. With the addition of Nilesat 102 in August 2000, the two satellites’ total capacity was nearly 230 digital channels. The change in Egyptian broadcasting regulations announced in January 2000 thus provided a timely government boost to Nilesat’s business. It allowed private broadcasters, both Egyptian and foreign, to operate exclusively by satellite from a designated free zone next to Media Production City and the Nilesat earth station. Among the Egyptian-owned channels created to take advantage of this opening, Dream TV and Al-Mehwar illustrated how crossover between commercialism and elements of public service is apt to occur in an environment marked by tight government controls and a general absence of state provision for pluralist public-service content. Whereas Al-Mehwar presented itself as the ‘voice of civil society’, Dream was quintessentially a ‘business project’ – a vehicle for advertising goods produced by the business empire of Ahmad Bahgat. Nevertheless, both found themselves juggling between governmentimposed constraints on their output and the imperatives of corporate survival in ways that produced examples of market-led programming on Al-Mehwar and public-service-style talk shows on Dream 2. While Dream’s widely watched Al-Aasher Masa’an (10pm) questioned public figures about current Egyptian affairs on viewers’ behalf, Al-Mehwar sought to boost ratings in Ramadan 2006 through a series on sexual health and personal relationships called Kalam Kabeer (Serious Talk). Both played safe in the 2005 presidential election, allocating 69 per cent and 41 per cent of election coverage respectively to the incumbent, Hosni Mubarak, who was one of ten candidates.23 Various forms of overlap between diverse broadcasting objectives can be found across the spectrum of Arab television start-ups, in line with the mix of stimuli and operating conditions from place to place. Later chapters consider these in more detail, showing how changing regulations in several countries opened the way to newcomers and how the established players behind companies like MBC, Al-Jazeera, Dubai TV and Rotana expanded their operations into groups of channels covering a range of programming types. In a region where religious guidance is highly prized, it was not incongruous for religious channels, from Al-Majd to Al-Resalah, to frame their efforts in busi-\n\n8\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\nness terms, not as spreading a message but as meeting a market need. Nor was it unusual for business or real-estate channels to tailor their coverage to avoid offending advertisers, even though the logic of maximizing viewership for advertisements might, if broadcasters and advertisers were less closely related, dictate the opposite approach. Perhaps the most noteworthy feature of the proliferation of channels, however, is the extent to which it appeared to contradict the usual tendency in media business towards mergers and acquisitions. Horizontal integration is common in the media industry because it helps towards maximizing profits through the economies of scale that are such a salient feature of media economics. Because the cost of producing a television show remains the same irrespective of the size of audience that actually watches it, financial benefits from increasing the number of viewers come at no extra cost. Since one way of increasing audiences is through taking over another company, there is an unusual degree of economic pressure towards ownership concentration in television.24 Resistance to such economic pressure was evident among the channels emerging in Dubai, Lebanon, Iraq, London and elsewhere after 2000. The forces behind these projects displayed a wide range of ambitions and a disinclination to collaborate or pool resources. The US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 prompted several private Arab entrepreneurs to found television projects based on early hopes that advertising would take off as part of a wider economic recovery. Not surprisingly perhaps, those responsible would sometimes hide their pecuniary ambitions behind a commitment to screening positive images of Iraq, implicitly acknowledging advertisers’ preference for feel-good content. Yet signs of other objectives underlying the financial ones could be seen in the sheer number of separate projects with funding from different sources outside Iraq. In Lebanon, despite its much smaller population, the growth of channels was clearly driven by their owners’ desire to disseminate their own choice of content. Al-Manar TV, owned by the Shia resistance movement Hizbollah, predated the country’s other Shia station, NBN, but NBN obtained its licence first. Once licensed, Al-Manar expanded from terrestrial into satellite transmission in 2000. Although linked to one sect and specifically intended to mobilize support for resistance to Israeli occupation, Al-Manar was seen in some quarters as transcending Lebanon’s sectarian television system, displaying ‘civic commitment’ through its interest in the concerns of\n\nP U BL IC I T Y M AC H I N E OR C OM PL E X I N DU S T RY ?\n\n9\n\nordinary people rather than a political elite.25 It achieved a big increase in viewers during the war in Lebanon in 2006. In light of this, the Free Patriotic Movement of Michel Aoun, having forged an alliance with Hizbollah in early 2006, might have been expected to take advantage of the latter’s access to the airwaves. Instead, it announced soon afterwards that it would set up its own television channel under the name Orange TV to counteract alleged misrepresentation of its policies on other channels.26 Indeed, after a period of intense activity throughout the region over several years, the rate of new channel formation showed no sign of let-up in 2006. One of the most prominent new arrivals, launched in March, was Al-Resalah (The Message), an ‘Islamic channel’ owned by Saudi Arabia’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. July saw the launch of AlHiwar (Dialogue) TV from London, aimed primarily at Arabs living in Europe. As with many other projects of its kind, Al-Hiwar was framed in terms of its message rather than its business prospects. Supported by figures based in Europe, including Azzam Tamimi, Palestinian-born director of the Institute of Islamic Political Thought in London and author of Hamas: Unwritten Chapters, the channel described its aims as connecting people and cultures and promoting tolerance, democracy and respect for freedom and human rights. According to its business manager, Adnan Faour, there would be no rush to try to measure audiences for at least the first year.27 In August another expatriate, this time from Saudi Arabia, announced his intention to start a Europe-based satellite channel ‘within three months’. Talal Mohammed al-Rashid, who has lived in exile in France since 1980, said his Saudi Democratic Opposition Front would broadcast calls to ordinary Saudis to ‘rise up against the tyrants and usurpers plundering public funds’.28 September 2006 saw the official launch of an altogether different project, designed to bring what Zoya Saker, its head of corporate communications, described as original ‘infotainment’ (food, fashion, family and news) to Arab women. Called Al-Aan (Now) TV and based in Dubai under the ownership of a holding group called Tower Media, the new channel allocated US$2 million to its initial marketing campaign and hired an in-house team of five people to bring in advertising. Even so, AlAan’s programme director, Ihab Hammoud, did not seem optimistic about imminent profits when questioned in November in Beirut.29 Projects like these indicated a continued pre-eminence of patro-\n\n10\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\nnal relations over market relations in Arab television. But a few also showed that patronal relations, far from restricting the aims of television output, could potentially sustain forms of broadcasting activity that would simulate the public-service model so conspicuously under-represented hitherto. The Ma’an (Together) network of local Palestinian television stations demonstrated this when, in November 2006, it announced a plan to establish its own satellite news channel. The network was formed in 2002 with the aims of encouraging Palestinian democracy through increased transparency and enabling direct contact between Palestinian representatives and their electorate.30 It could not depend on the market to meet these aims. Danish and Dutch financial support helped to create the Ma’an News Agency in 2004, to gather and distribute news in Arabic, English and Hebrew free of charge.31 Ma’an then met the costs of training reporters to deliver live television news by means of a grant from Search for Common Ground, a non-governmental conflict resolution organization based in Brussels and New York. While non-market operations might seek to increase transparency for its own sake, there were signs in 2006 that other projects might yet have an opportunity to do likewise for reasons of profit. ATV, Jordan’s first privately owned terrestrial channel with a licence to broadcast news, was set to launch in 2007, backed by investment from within the publishing venture that produced the Jordanian daily newspaper Al-Ghad. Al-Ghad made its name, contemporaneously with Al-Masri al-Youm in Egypt and Al-Wasat in Bahrain, as one of a new breed of business-backed Arabic newspapers to strive for financial viability by meeting the information needs of readers in their role as members of a national public. The terms of ATV’s terrestrial licence, and the investment ploughed into its brand-new custom-built studios in Amman, made it virtually unique in Arab television, at least in the run-up to its launch. Having secured Arabic rights to popular Western entertainment formats such as The Price is Right and Boss Swap, while also preparing news leads on Jordan ranked in terms of their relevance to Jordanian citizens, the station seemed to encapsulate possibilities for symbiosis between market-led entertainment and public-oriented coverage of national current affairs. Paul Hijazin, one of its first senior appointees, hinted at the combination when explaining how he handled the perennial question in Arab television about political\n\nP U BL IC I T Y M AC H I N E OR C OM PL E X I N DU S T RY ?\n\n11\n\nagendas. He said, ‘I tell them my agenda is a modern Jordan.’ 32 Resources and forms of control Aspects of the landscape described so far seem to offer more openings for change and development than some accounts of the contemporary Arab media scene would suggest. For example, Abdel-Bari Atwan, editor-in-chief of the London-based daily Al-Quds al-Arabi, painted an unpromising picture of Arab television on the occasion of Press Freedom Day in May 2006. Only ten channels out of 250 are political news channels, he wrote, and ‘the rest specialize in immorality, superficiality and exposing nudity’. He went on to say that music, sport and religious channels ‘reproduce like rabbits’ and noted the irony that ‘immoral channels’ and ‘so-called Islamic channels’ had the same financiers.33 In this remark, Atwan was assumed to be referring to Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, owner of both the Rotana music channels and Al-Resalah. What Atwan did not seem to allow for was the possibility that, in the process of breeding ‘like rabbits’, television channels would spawn new layers of management, new programmecommissioning processes, new ancillary businesses in the fields of advertising and public relations, and new sets of contacts in the form of sources and suppliers. Since the Arab television industry became increasingly complex in all these dimensions during the period of expansion under review, any attempt to understand the significance of this expansion should examine whether complexity brought with it any devolution of power. That task in turn calls for closer scrutiny of the nature of the resources on which the industry depends and where control over these resources really lies. Graham Murdock, drawing on research by others to explore organizing concepts behind corporate power in Western media industries, distinguished between allocative and operational control and between legal and economic ownership. The first distinction differentiates between the power to allocate resources in terms of purpose and volume, and the lesser power to decide how to use resources that have already been allocated according to purposes already set. The second differentiates between nominal and real access to decision-making – the latter requiring effective representation on the board of directors or any subgroup responsible for allocative decisions.34 To make a preliminary excursion here into questions of control\n\n12\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\nand decision-making that underlie the remainder of this book, one obvious example of a possible reconfiguration of power is to be found in the sphere of satellite capacity. Expansion of capacity, driven in part by the launch of Nilesat 102, was a key factor in the proliferation of channels after 2000. But this is also an area, like some others, where fluctuations in the balance between demand and supply have combined to disturb the status quo. Satellite launches can fail, as happened to Arabsat 4A in February 2006, when a Russian-made rocket booster malfunctioned, leaving Arabsat as an organization dependent on emergency spare capacity leased from the Paris-based body Eutelsat, pending the November 2006 launch of Arabsat 4B. In the interim, Arabsat found itself competing for Eutelsat’s services with Noorsat, a newcomer to the Middle East satellite scene. Noorsat, the first satellite company to be wholly owned by private Arab interests, had announced its arrival in 2005 with plans to rent spare bandwidth from Eutelsat and elsewhere so as to lease it on to Arab broadcasters at regionally competitive rates. Given its prior commitment to Noorsat, which was due to take effect from July 2006, Eutelsat was limited in the number of transponders it could turn over to Arabsat.35 In other words, Noorsat made an impact on the satellite market without actually owning a satellite, while circumstances turned Eutelsat into an arbiter of transponder availability for Arab channels. It is relevant in this context that the Mawarid Group, which is behind the privately owned Saudi pay-TV network Orbit, took a 30 per cent stake in Noorsat. Omar Shoter, Noorsat’s chief executive officer, was previously director-general of Arabsat. Moreover, Noorsat said it would sell up to 30 per cent of its equity, probably to broadcasters that would become its customers. Its presence in the market for satellite capacity coincided with growing awareness that a move to high-definition television (HDTV) in the region would increase demand for bandwidth. Alongside questions of allocative versus operational control over physical infrastructure, there are others about control over an intangible resource such as information. Information about television audiences may be especially valuable to companies interested in buying advertising space. Here again, it is possible to tell the story as one of shifts and growing uncertainty, caused by new sources of data emerging at a time when the increase in channel numbers was already causing audiences to fragment. When Arab Advisors Group, a telecoms consul-\n\nP U BL IC I T Y M AC H I N E OR C OM PL E X I N DU S T RY ?\n\n13\n\ntancy, turned its attention to television research in 2003 it entered a field previously dominated by two main players. The allocative control exercised by the consultancy over its own operations had implications for allocations of advertising revenue and thus, potentially, for the resources available to television companies. Its emergence coincided with the dissemination of findings from an unprecedented number of public opinion polls, some of which also probed audience preferences. The hostile reception accorded to a Zogby poll of six Arab countries in 2005 revealed the extent to which such data was feared to threaten the status quo. Zogby International reported Al-Jazeera to be the most popular news channel in the countries studied, provoking criticism of its methodology from Dubai TV, MBC, Saudi TV and Lebanon’s Future TV.36 The struggle for control over information about public media preferences was similarly evident when researchers, conducting face-to-face interviews with over 1,000 urban Egyptians in March 2006, were obliged to omit a question that was being asked of respondents in other countries for the same poll. The study, carried out for the BBC, Reuters and The Media Centre, found that 72 per cent of Egyptians relied on television as their first source of news in a typical week, 59 per cent spontaneously mentioned Al-Jazeera as being trustworthy and 43 per cent trusted international media more than their own national media. However, when it came to comparing trust in media and trust in government, the question about trust in government was not asked.37 Credibility and legitimacy are a form of cultural capital, and thus a resource, which the makers of television programmes can grant or deny to the sources they draw on from day to day. In a changing television landscape this is another area where shifts may take place. It has been argued that non-official or resource-poor organizations, by becoming ‘reliable, authoritative and routine suppliers [of information] for journalists’, can overcome institutional and economic disadvantages to gain positive media access; by the same token, official and corporate sources have sometimes been shown to ‘lose authority and legitimacy by proving unreliable and/or divided’.38 It is possible, as Philip Schlesinger has shown, to accept this apparently pluralist view of competition for media access without thereby rejecting a theory of dominance, which sees the playing field for achieving such access as far from level.39 For decades there was no perceptible competition\n\n14\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\nfor access to Arab television channels that were controlled by, or on behalf of, governments. Today, if that control has been eroded, it would be seen in news sources’ changing relations with editors and journalists. Although no doubt limited to operational control within their own organizations, these people have the potential to influence the allocation of airtime to outside groups. If, for example, by virtue of the sheer expansion and diversification of television capacity, Arab television presenters came to treat human rights, environmental or other advocacy groups as regular interlocutors, the industry would have effectively shifted resources in this direction. Arab leaders have already shown they fear a loss of televisual legitimacy as more of the limelight shifts elsewhere. Thus Egypt’s president, Hosni Mubarak, arranged unprecedented recourse to media advisors for his part in the 2005 presidential election campaign, which there was never any chance he would lose. Of the many questions to be asked about possible shifts in power and resources, a further set arises with regard to the balance of supply and demand between broadcasters and production companies. One outcome of growing demand for drama and other entertainment programming was a steep rise in the number of production houses and intensifying pressure to produce material that would, as Marlin Dick puts it, ‘take chances rather than play it safe’.40 Dick concludes from his research on Syrian television drama that the pan-Arab television industry ‘finds itself obliged to be controversial while remaining uncertain about what constitutes controversy’.41 The present study delves into some of the controversies and uncertainties surrounding the workings of Arab television, in an effort to weigh whether its increasing complexity reflects a redistribution of power and resources or masks successful resistance to such a change.\n\n2\n\nLaw and Policy on Ownership and Content In the first decade or so of Arab satellite television, excitement that it would challenge the regional status quo often took precedence over the more sober realization that it actually served a useful purpose for ruling elites. Ruling elites were the ones with enough resources to make use of satellite technology and, by doing so, they ensured that its radical potential was contained.1 Conveniently, although satellite channels appeared to pose a threat to regimes by circumventing strict controls on national media, the channels’ existence left those controls in place. By opening safety valves for the expression of dissent that national media controls kept closed, transnational television could even be said to have weakened the build-up of pressure for the removal of bans on private terrestrial television ownership.2 However, such pressure could not be held back indefinitely. Although Arab government monopolies on terrestrial broadcasting survived the first waves of proliferating satellite channels and were still overwhelmingly the norm by 2006, the wall of resistance had by then begun to crack. Apart from Lebanon, which ended its state broadcaster’s monopoly back in 1994, and the dozens of private broadcasters who mushroomed on the West Bank after the 1993 Israeli–Palestinian Oslo Accords, the first purposeful steps towards opening Arab terrestrial television to private ownership took place in Morocco and Jordan in 2002. Allowing private competition in the national television sector poses challenges of law and policy that Arab governments did not face when such competition was limited to the printed press. Independent or opposition newspapers can be subject to prior censorship, unlike live broadcasts. Printing and distribution of newspapers can be physically disrupted in much more subtle and persistent ways than are available 15\n\n16\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\nfor interrupting or blocking television transmission. For those reasons, licensing a private television channel is more of a risk for incumbent elites and the potential transfer of power is that much greater. To explore the television licensing choices made in different countries is thus to get a sense of where political power resides and whether it is concentrated centrally or becomes more diffused. For example, early verdicts on the allocation of licences in Lebanon were not optimistic about devolution of power. Nabih Berri, speaker of the Lebanese parliament and himself the holder of a broadcasting licence, acknowledged on live television that broadcasting in Lebanon had been ‘monopolized by members of the regime’, prompting one scholar to talk of an ‘oligarchy where political power and media ownership converge’.3 Yet expectations were raised in Morocco that new licensing arrangements there would mark a new stage in democratizing the country. Noting that real competition for audiences and advertising budgets would undermine cosy relationships between the well-connected in media and political circles, a Moroccan commentator declared: ‘Le temps de copinages est fini.’ 4 Changes in broadcast regulation have been studied in some nonArab contexts against a backdrop of conventional wisdom about the role of elites in political transitions. Robert Horwitz, writing on South Africa, identifies two ‘axioms’ underlying analysis of transitions from authoritarianism. A political axiom holds that elites make pacts with each other that enable them to limit concessions to pro-democracy forces. An economic axiom holds that economic reform is imposed top-down, in the interests of global capital, in ways that ‘insulat[e] economic reform from the chaos of distributional claims’.5 Horwitz finds neither axiom adequate to account for the role of trade unions, political parties and civil society organizations in broadcast reform in South Africa, where the struggle against apartheid had set in train an internal mass movement and practices of participatory politics that set the agenda for transition. In contrast, studies of political contestation in a number of Arab countries suggest that incumbent and opposition elites do indeed reach accommodations with each other to marginalize more radical contenders. Such accommodations may even give a false impression that a transition from authoritarianism is under way. Based on her work in Egypt, Jordan and Morocco, Ellen Lust-Okar argues that, in some cases, political concessions are deliberate manoeuvres to\n\nL AW A N D P OL IC Y O N OW N E R S H I P A N D C O N T E N T\n\n17\n\npreserve the regime. That is to say, ‘authoritarianism need not sustain itself primarily through repression’,6 but through the structuring of government–opposition relations in ways that give privileged opposition elites incentives to join with incumbent elites in excluding other groups by denying them the power to mobilize. In some countries, at certain points, opposition groups may fear each other; in others, or at other times, they may not. In Egypt and Morocco, for example, powers of patronage are said to determine the rules of the political opposition game and who may play. Raymond Hinnebusch describes a phenomenon of ‘political liberalization without democratization’, whereby the rule of law is advanced for property owners, party pluralism is increased for the middle class and barriers are erected against Islamist use of the party system to speak for ‘those below’.7 Joshua Stacher, exploring the rationale for Egypt’s National Human Rights Council, concludes that ‘an authoritarian regime adapts to adversity by expanding its power base and redistributing political power among its opponents’. He finds that the council’s purpose is primarily to redefine the field of opposition into ‘moderate’ and ‘rejectionist’ camps.8 Meanwhile Morocco’s rules of opposition distinguish between two Islamist groups, including one and excluding the other. According to one account, the Parti de Justice et Développement was allowed into the political system only after it accepted the ‘basic rules, … especially the king’s role as ultimate political arbiter and supreme religious authority’.9 The Justice and Charity Group (Al-Adl wa’l-Ihsan), which advocates a new constitution, was meanwhile placed in the rejectionist camp. Changes in television licensing, as in media regulation more generally, can help to reveal the authenticity of transitions from authoritarianism. Arrangements for television ownership and content could be said to affect the ability of political forces to ‘gain a voice or some measure of influence on political processes’, even if only from the periphery of the three concentric circles of power and influence that, in Volker Perthes’s model, make up the politically relevant elite.10 The rest of this chapter draws on insights about included and excluded oppositions to examine new rules and policies in a range of countries from Morocco to Oman. Its underlying question is whether the forces who gain a voice through liberalization of the broadcast sector are competitors who play by the rules of the game – a game in which\n\n18\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\n‘rulers or parts of the ruling elite try to accommodate or integrate dissenters’11 – or whether they are challengers who see representation via television as one step towards changing the rules. Who regulates? Basic to any national development plan for television are decisions about how to handle regulation. Governments everywhere are notorious for allowing a preoccupation with survival to influence their dealings with the media and this in turn provides a strong rationale for broadcast regulation that is independent of government. Broadcasters cannot be relied upon to act as a watchdog on government if the way they are regulated makes them subject to government control. Outwardly, the spectrum of arrangements adopted in Arab countries ranges from a system of regulation by royal or ministerial decree to one where a council or commission is specially created for the purpose, as in Lebanon, Jordan and Morocco. The regulatory bodies of these three countries, along with procedures adopted under the Palestinian Authority and a three-year restructuring plan proposed in Egypt in early 2006, offer some clues as to whether the apparent bureaucratization of television regulation in these contexts reflects the beginnings of a shift from personalized control by political leaders to one embedded in independent procedures and the rule of law. Since such a shift depends on internal power dynamics, this section does not examine Iraq’s National Communications and Media Commission (NCMC), established under the US-led occupation. Having been imposed by external forces and quickly downgraded by the Interim Government of Iraq in 2004, the NCMC did not owe its existence to any organic regionwide trend.12 In Lebanon, on the other hand, the first steps to regulate television after the 15-year civil war did set a precedent for the rest of the Arab world. Rafiq Hariri’s post-war government formally revoked the state broadcaster’s monopoly and authorized privately owned terrestrial broadcasting under the Audiovisual Media Law, Law 382, it issued in 1994. To a degree the law recognized the emergence of private media during the civil war, while at the same time attempting to end a situation in which such media could perpetuate the power of militias. A clause in the Taif agreement of 1989, which ended the war, provided for reorganization of ‘information media’, ‘within the framework of\n\nL AW A N D P OL IC Y O N OW N E R S H I P A N D C O N T E N T\n\n19\n\nresponsible liberties that serve the efforts of reconciliation’. The postwar information minister, Ahmad Mansour, echoed this when he urged action to ensure that ‘the communication channels are not militia instruments which fire words instead of bullets’.13 With a French model of broadcast regulation openly preferred for reasons of history and the political value of emulating a European democracy, Michel Samaha, who followed Mansour as information minister, attended meetings of France’s Conseil Supérieur de l’Audiovisuel (CSA) to understand how it worked.14 Nevertheless, the first bill he drafted concentrated most key regulatory functions in the hands of the information minister. It was only after lobbying by media representatives that a compromise agreement accorded a greater role to an independent National Audiovisual Council (NAC), purportedly inspired by the CSA.15 The NAC eventually created was a ten-member body, half appointed by the cabinet and half by parliament, drawn from the ranks of artists, scientists and other professionals. Local critics at the time complained that as many as eight of its ten members were pro-Hariri.16 Yet it is questionable whether manipulation of NAC membership was strictly necessary given the limitations already imposed on NAC powers. Ultimately its role was as an advisory body, producing non-binding guidance for the council of ministers. Its remit was to advise on the allocation of broadcasting licences and the drafting of the Guidebook of Operating Conditions. If the minister of information decided to suspend a station’s licence for infringing the law, the NAC would be called upon to give an opinion but not to intervene. Ten years after its creation, pressure persisted for the NAC’s powers and independence to be strengthened. Nabil Dajani, a professor specializing in Lebanese media at the American University of Beirut, told a conference in November 2005, ‘what we need is an independent regulator’. His point was that existing provisions of the Audiovisual Law could overcome many problems, but first they had to be properly applied.17 Indeed, far from the NAC getting stronger, it had become apparent that neither the NAC – nor even the NAC and ministry of information together – were the only bodies regulating the media in Lebanon. The ministry of interior’s General Directorate of General Security (Sûreté Générale) was also heavily involved, with the Sûreté’s website declaring ‘media censorship’ to be its second most important function. It listed\n\n20\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\nthree censorship responsibilities: controlling radio, television and movie cassettes; organizing media censorship and preparing related studies; and ‘ensuring the right implementation’ of censorship ‘laws and rules’.18 Nor was the NAC ever given control over the licensing of satellite channels based in Lebanon. While Law 382 dealt with terrestrial broadcasting, Law 531 gave the cabinet powers to grant or revoke licences for satellite channels. In Morocco, as in Lebanon, the creation of a body to regulate broadcasting came several years after the country’s first experience of private channels. The radio station Médi 1 started in 1980 under French and Moroccan ownership and this was followed in 1989 by the introduction of 2M as a private pay-TV service. The state saved 2M from collapse by buying a 68 per cent share in 1997 and taking over its management, after which it became free-to-air. But it was in 1998, under a new government headed by former opposition leader Abderrahman Youssefi, with former journalist and unionist Larbi Messari as communication minister, that efforts to liberalize broadcasting gathered momentum. Youssefi and Messari set up a taskforce to devise a reform plan but ran into resistance from the palace, which another communication minister, Nabil Benabdellah, later blamed on a lack of tact and diplomacy on Messari’s part.19 Mohamed Achaari, appointed by Youssefi to replace Messari, tried again in 2001–02, helped by the accession of a new king and a change of personnel at the ministry of the interior. But the new king then snatched the initiative. Three weeks before elections due for September 2002, Mohamed VI created the Haute Autorité de la Communication Audiovisuelle (HACA), comprising on the one hand a Conseil Supérieur de la Communication Audiovisuelle (CSCA, comparable to the CSA in France) and, on the other, a Direction Générale de la Communication Audiovisuelle to provide administrative and technical services. The HACA was instituted by a royal decree based on Article 19 of the Moroccan Constitution, whereby the king is the country’s prime legislator. Strewn with verbs like ‘advise’, ‘suggest’ and ‘monitor’, the decree left no doubt that the HACA exists to advise the king and the king holds its purse strings. Appointments to the nine-member CSCA are dominated by the king, who chooses five of its members, including its head (who is responsible for convening CSCA meetings), leaving two to be named by the prime minister and one by each chamber of\n\nL AW A N D P OL IC Y O N OW N E R S H I P A N D C O N T E N T\n\n21\n\nthe bicameral parliament. No time limit was placed on the tenure of royal appointees, whereas those chosen by the prime minister were to serve a five-year term renewable once.20 A change of monarch also helps to explain liberalization manoeuvres in broadcasting in Jordan after 1999. Plans to end the government’s monopoly had been discussed several years earlier as part of reforms triggered by unrest in 1989, only to be set aside in clampdowns accompanying Jordan’s peace treaty with Israel in 1994. King Abdullah came to the throne in 1999 with a reformist agenda, which encompassed the television sector. A government plan for media reform, announced in July 2000, envisaged dissolving the information ministry and part-privatizing the wholly government-owned monopoly broadcaster, JRTVC. But things did not proceed smoothly between the decision to abolish the information ministry, which was taken in October 2001, and its eventual abolition, which took effect with the appointment of a new, smaller cabinet in October 2003. In order for the reforms to go ahead, the cabinet agreed to amend the law governing JRTVC so as to allow private domestic and foreign companies to invest in broadcasting, subject to cabinet approval in each case. But the information ministry’s responsibilities, which included operating the JRTVC, the national news agency Petra and the Press and Publications Department, still had to be assigned to a successor body while legislative changes were being made. In December 2001 the king appointed a Higher Media Council (HMC), led by academic and former foreign minister Kamal Abu Jaber, to replace the ministry. The council’s 11 members, drawn from the ranks of former ministers, army officers, editors and academics, were allotted three-year terms. Their brief was to draft media policy and oversee the drafting of related laws. One of their first steps was to set up two subsidiary committees, one for the press and the other for broadcasting.21 Progress was unsteady, blocked, according to some observers, by resistance on the part of the ‘old guard’. The HMC submitted draft laws to the cabinet for endorsement and these were duly passed by the prime minister’s office. But external events were souring the climate inside Jordan. The early part of 2002 saw Israeli incursions into Palestinian towns and refugee camps, triggering outbursts by Arab citizens against their governments’ inertia and prompting the Jordanian government to tighten its grip on media content. JRTVC’s own nine-\n\n22\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\nmember board was reshuffled to put at its head the very information minister whose department was supposedly being phased out.22 In July 2002, Kamel Abu Jaber and another HMC board member resigned in frustration. Mohammad al-Adwan, minister of information at the time, expressed no regrets. ‘I didn’t notice any support from the government to implement any of the Council’s goals,’ he said.23 Finally, at the end of 2002, the king issued another royal decree reviving the HMC and instructing its head and the prime minister to work together to encourage independent media institutions. Nabil Sharif, an editor and HMC member, attributed the failure of the first HMC to its ‘executive role’, which, he said, had placed ‘the government and the council on a collision course’.24 Not surprisingly, when Jordan’s Audiovisual Commission was established under Provisional Law No. 71 of 2002, it was set up as a ‘governmental body’ under the prime minister.25 A further royal decree, issued in November 2003, authorized the prime minister to delegate responsibility for the commission to another minister. After the culture ministry was also abolished but then revived, a new prime minister decided in April 2005 to delegate the media portfolio to the culture minister, Asma Khader. Meanwhile Jordan’s Audiovisual Commission, under its director, Hussein Bani Hani, set about accepting applications for broadcasting licences. Its remit included studying applications and making recommendations to the appropriate minister, who was given 30 days in which to accept or reject the recommendation. Any eventual agreement with a licensee would, as originally envisaged, depend on cabinet approval. More than six years after Egypt used a prime ministerial decree (No. 411 of 2000) to put in place a licensing system for private satellite broadcasters operating exclusively in the country’s so-called media free zone, the increasingly dire financial losses and uncompetitiveness of the state-owned Egyptian Radio and Television Union (ERTU) prompted further moves towards liberalization, this time in terrestrial broadcasting. But no one was left in any doubt that the Egyptian ministry of information would retain control over any future body charged with media regulation. In February 2006, a year after his appointment as minister of information, Anas el-Fiqi presented a plan to the Culture, Information and Tourism Committee of the People’s Assembly, setting out a three-year timetable for changes to\n\nL AW A N D P OL IC Y O N OW N E R S H I P A N D C O N T E N T\n\n23\n\nthe running of state-owned media. He spoke of a new national regulatory authority for media that would operate along similar lines to the established National Telecommunication Regulatory Authority, which issues licences to new telecoms providers. According to Fiqi, any such National Media Authority would come under his ministry.26 That statement did not fundamentally contradict reform proposals being drawn up behind the scenes, either through the Research and Development Committee of the state broadcaster’s Board of Trustees or the local office of the international law firm Baker & McKenzie. In these consultations the focus was not so much on independence for the regulator as on achieving greater separation between the functions of regulation and state broadcasting. It was suggested, for example, that the state monopoly broadcaster, the ERTU, should have an adjustment period of two or three years ahead of the creation of a new regulatory body and that the government could retain control over the latter body by giving itself a majority of the votes. For the Palestinian Authority (PA), technically speaking, sovereign powers to regulate the use of multiple broadcasting frequencies did not exist. The Palestinian–Israeli Declaration of Principles (DoP) of 1993 opened only the smallest chink in the Israeli occupation, in the air as well as on land. Annex 1 of the Declaration specified that arrangements were to be agreed for the ‘possibility’ of licensing one radio and one TV station, with a further protocol obliging Palestinians to coordinate with Israel regarding communication and media. Having taken the only frequencies allotted under the DoP for use by the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation, the PA had nothing to distribute. Instead, for reasons explained in the next section of this chapter, it informed the very large number of private Palestinian terrestrial broadcasters that it had no objection to their activities. But settling policy on structural regulation in this fashion did not resolve the matter of regulating television content. Daoud Kuttab recounts how his Al-Quds Educational TV (AETV), which grew out of an experimental Palestinian television news broadcast in 1993, helped to trigger a decision by the PA chairman, Yasser Arafat, to establish an embryonic regulator in June 1997. Kuttab was detained for a week by Palestinian security forces after AETV broadcast sessions of the Palestinian Legislative Council.27 Arafat, realizing the incongruity of this situation, was persuaded to establish a 13-member committee\n\n24\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\nto regulate private television and radio stations and ‘guarantee’ their ‘commitment to the rules, especially the Press Law [of 1995]’.28 The committee was headed by the minister of information, Yasser Abed Rabbo, and included the information ministry’s director of publications, Hani al-Masri, along with representatives of the ministries of interior, telecommunications, culture, finance and economy and trade, plus legal and technical experts, including the technical director of AETV. Hani al-Masri was named as the person to whom applications for a ‘temporary licence’ should be submitted. He was given the final say, after consulting with the ministry of the interior on security and the minister of telecommunications about the use of frequencies.29 All three ministries were involved in regulation thereafter. A January 2005 fax to private broadcasters notifying them of an increase in licence fees originated from the ministry of telecommunications and IT. In January 2006, when the Islamist resistance movement Hamas launched Al-Aqsa TV in Gaza ahead of elections to the Palestinian legislature, the Palestinian public prosecutor, Ahmad Maghni, threatened to close it because it did not have the necessary permission. Maghni said it would be up to the interior ministry and police to enforce the closure. As for the information ministry’s role in the process, Rael Abu Deir, head of Al-Aqsa TV, said his station had been trying to obtain a licence for the past year but had been told by the minister of information that he was not taking applications.30 The minister, Nabil Shaath, who was also deputy prime minister, had an excuse for this delay. In April 2005 he initiated steps to revamp broadcast legislation and create an independent National Council for the Media. The draft law, prepared by local jurists with reference to existing models in France and elsewhere, included provisions to protect the proposed council’s independence by means of the appointments process and the qualifications and tenure of council members.31 In the crisis that followed the January 2006 elections, including Israel’s arrest of elected government ministers and MPs, the proposals remained in draft form. Licensing and licensees Resistance to the launching of Al-Aqsa TV contrasted with the licensing policy adopted by the Palestinian information ministry in previ-\n\nL AW A N D P OL IC Y O N OW N E R S H I P A N D C O N T E N T\n\n25\n\nous years, during which it had freely issued ‘no objection’ notices or ‘temporary licences’ to dozens of applicants without regard to fragmentation of audiences and advertising revenue. Walid Batrawi, a Palestinian journalist and researcher, recorded the PA’s rationale for this policy in 2002. Hani al-Masri, the man responsible for implementing it, gave Batrawi three reasons. First, he said, the PA had ‘wanted to create facts on the ground for future negotiations with Israel’, in terms of occupying as many frequencies as possible. Secondly, it was afraid that Israel might, at some point, ‘close down or attack the government-owned broadcasting corporation’. This had already happened when Israeli forces destroyed PBC transmission towers and other facilities in October 2000. Thirdly, ‘the people at the Ministry of Information, especially the minister, believe in freedom of expression’.32 In other words, just as Israel was seen to be creating ‘facts on the ground’ through occupation and settlement, the PA’s policy, as summarized by Daoud Kuttab, was to create ‘facts in the air’.33 The result, according to a survey in 2004, was a total of some 40 radio and television stations, with private television channels numbering around 27 and most of these covering only their immediate surrounding area; only a few, such as AETV, Amwaj, Watan TV and Al-Mahd, could be received beyond the towns where they were based and no private channel was based in Gaza.34 Eleven stations, including AETV and others, took their own initiative to overcome some negative effects of fragmentation by grouping together in the Ma’an Network. Self-regulation within Ma’an covered such issues as paid election advertising. The profusion of private Palestinian broadcasters, representing different political currents and interest groups, continued to offer a stark contrast with the rest of the Arab world, notwithstanding a sudden upturn in the number of Arab countries granting licences to private television stations over the period 2003–05. Lebanon, Morocco and Jordan were relatively unusual in creating regulatory commissions before they licensed private operators, but they were not alone. Oman’s ruler, Sultan Qaboos, decreed in 2004 that private broadcasting should be allowed in Oman and, accordingly, a Commission for Private Radio and TV Companies was created under the responsibility of the Omani ministry of information. Yet an increase in the number of countries issuing licences did not mean that many licences were issued in each one. Across the region, the overwhelming impression\n\n26\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\nwas of governments clinging to control of television by licensing only trusted associates and, even then, taking almost no chances with terrestrial stations carrying political content. The Kuwaiti information ministry announced in July 2003 that it was lifting its ban on private broadcasting and simultaneously awarded licences to three private stations to broadcast by satellite from Kuwait. The ministry said it reserved the right to monitor these stations’ output and to halt any content that contradicted government objectives or endangered relations with friendly states.35 Following that decision, two Kuwaiti channels launched in 2004 but only one of these offered political content as well as drama, film and religious programming. This was Al-Rai TV, owned by Jassem Boodai, who had recently acquired a licence to publish the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Rai al-Aam. A long-established Kuwaiti conglomerate with interests in trading, construction and transport, the Boodai Corporation had no previous experience of broadcasting before it set up the Boodai Media Group. Its entry into the media sector paralleled its near simultaneous entry into Kuwait’s aviation sector, also newly liberalized, since Jazeera Airways, also launched by the Boodai group, became the country’s first private airline in mid-2004. With a breakthrough to private ownership of television operations having occurred in Kuwait and Oman, pressure increased on neighbouring governments to follow suit. Saudi Arabia’s culture and information minister, Iyad Madani, said in 2006 that 20 applications had been received for private radio stations and would be looked on favourably once a regulatory structure and licensing system had been devised and put in place.36 Campaigners in Yemen lobbied for a project called the Democracy Channel, backed by Sheikh AbdelQawi Ali al-Showai. But Yemen’s ministry of information refused a request to licence the channel, saying there was no law to regulate it. Tunisia’s government made its first move to liberalize broadcasting in November 2003, apparently after coming under pressure from representatives of the advertising industry, dismayed at plummeting audiences for state TV.37 The privately owned Radio Mosaic, run by associates of President Ben Ali, was first on the scene; it started on the same day that Ben Ali announced his liberalization decision. It was followed in early 2005 by Hannibal TV, owned by the Tunisian businessman Larbi Nasra and aimed at a youth market interested in music, films and sport. The channel’s unimpressive ratings a year later\n\nL AW A N D P OL IC Y O N OW N E R S H I P A N D C O N T E N T\n\n27\n\nwere blamed on its unmistakable deference to Tunisia’s political leadership. In Oman, the first private broadcasting licences were issued in October 2005 to two established local businesses. One stuck to radio. The other, Oman Holding International (OHI), was authorized to set up a radio and television station. OHI’s head, Maqbool Hameed alSaleh, indicated that he had no intention of competing with the state broadcaster, which the information minister, Hamad bin Mohammed al-Rashidi, had pledged to preserve and boost. Instead al-Saleh described the OHI broadcasting project as ‘non-political’. ‘We have to watch our steps and do it the right way,’ he said.38 Syria also went with the trend, albeit slowly. The government in Damascus allowed the official news agency to report in January 2002 that private radio stations would be permitted, provided they restricted their output to music, entertainment and advertisements. Four licences were issued in 2003, but it took until March 2005 for the first two, Al-Madina and Al-Arabiya, to begin broadcasts. Sham TV, a private channel owned by one of the country’s biggest television production houses, started test broadcasts in June 2005, running programmes from state television archives and elsewhere. The man behind Sham TV, Mohammed Akram Jundi, brother of a Syrian MP and head of Arab Art Production and Distribution, obtained a provisional licence from the Syrian government according to which the right to broadcast news bulletins was initially left unconfirmed. Significantly, however, he decided to operate the channel on a test basis from Dubai, pending new legislation in Syria that would clarify the status of private media. In January 2006 an announcement in Libya suggested that private media, including television, would also be allowed there. The first proposal for a new television channel came from a company created by Seif al-Islam Qadhafi, son of the Libyan leader, Muammar Qadhafi.39 Television licences issued in Kuwait, Tunisia, Syria and Oman point to governments favouring trusted business associates as licensees. A decade earlier this is more or less what happened in Lebanon, when the first round of licences issued under the Audiovisual Media Law was seen to demonstrate what Druze MP Walid Jumblatt described as the ‘octopus of money and power’.40 Dima Dabbous-Sensenig’s painstaking research has shown that licences were issued to applicants who must have been pre-selected on grounds other than the strength\n\n28\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\nof their application, because the process selectively overlooked the fact that some had failed to meet basic stated requirements in terms of company registration, paid-up capital, or distribution of shares. Evidence of disregard for the rules gives credence to allegations that Lebanese broadcasting had been ‘seized’ by a power elite of confessional and business leaders with a web of interlocking interests in banking, investment, construction and ties to other regional powers.41 It was only with the replacement of one Lebanese government by another that rejected applications would be reviewed, as happened in the case of New TV. New TV, owned by a Lebanese businessman, Tahsin Khayat, predated the 1994 Audiovisual Law and was closed down after being denied a licence in the first round. At the time it was considered no coincidence that Khayat and New TV had criticized the Hariri government. But the original decision was reversed in June 1999, under a government headed by Selim al-Hoss, and the station reopened in October 2001. Egyptian business leaders with close relations to President Hosni Mubarak were the ones to benefit from the Egyptian government’s decision in 2000 to allow private Egyptian-owned satellite broadcasters to start transmitting – with certain restrictions – from a designated media ‘free zone’ in Media Production City. A number of prominent families and their conglomerates had gained ground in Egypt during the 1990s, becoming increasingly linked to the government through the circulation of subsidized funds and the protection of monopolies or oligopolies holding exclusive agency agreements with major foreign companies. Far from questioning the legitimacy of personal day-to-day dealings between cabinet ministers and company owners, the government appeared to encourage such dealings in 2006 by appointing six cabinet ministers with active business interests in the same sectors as their ministerial portfolios.42 One study of ways in which the state allegedly became ‘increasingly beholden to the interests of a narrow class of financiers and entrepreneurs’ notes that Ahmad Bahgat, head of the Bahgat group and the man behind its Dreamland leisure and residential complex near Cairo, was ‘reputed to be a front-man for members of the presidential family, which may explain why the express roads out to Dreamland were built in such rapid time’.43 Another author writes of Bahgat’s ‘ties with the military for contracts and patronage’ and the benefits that he and other ‘elite businessmen’ derived from\n\nL AW A N D P OL IC Y O N OW N E R S H I P A N D C O N T E N T\n\n29\n\nmaking themselves ‘politically relevant to the regime’ so as to fend off competition from outside their ranks.44 Bahgat was the first person to respond to the government’s limited opening to satellite channels when he launched Dream TV in 2001. Naguib Sawiris of the Orascom group initially spurned the chance to broadcast by satellite only. Indignant at the implication that a group with ‘more investments in Egypt than any other’ would seek to harm the country if given the opportunity to transmit terrestrially, Sawiris pointed out that, if the only option was to broadcast by satellite, he could ‘do that anywhere’.45 But the burgeoning phenomenon of music television seems to have induced a change of heart, along with signs from the government that media reforms would eventually bring an opening to private terrestrial channels. As chief executive of Orascom Telecom Holdings (OTH), part owner of the Egyptian mobile phone company MobiNil, Sawiris was no doubt encouraged by the revenue spin-offs of text messaging to music television channels and technological developments in television transmission to mobile phones. After entering a partnership with Gamal Marwan, grandson of former president Gamal Abdel-Nasser, in Melody Entertainment (a media free zone licensee), he declared in 2006 that he would be launching a new station, called OTV, by the end of the year.46 Sawiris had previously joined with other local commercial music interests to open the first Virgin Megastore in Cairo in September 2003. Partners in this project, besides Melody TV, MobiNil and two new FM radio stations, were said to include Ashraf al-Sherif, son of Safwat al-Sherif, then Egypt’s information minister.47 In 2005, after OTH appointed a former Egyptian foreign minister, Ahmed Maher, to its board, Sawiris proclaimed himself fully confident that Egypt offered a transparent business environment where it was not necessary to pull political strings to get on. Asked by CNN’s financial editor, Todd Benjamin, what he thought was the biggest misconception held in the West about doing business in the Middle East, Sawiris answered: I think they think you need some relations, some corruption, stuff like that, and it’s not true. Where you need to have a partner that is politically linked and (sic) I will never do that again; I’m out of these countries now. But if you come to Egypt, you don’t need anybody, you can start any kind of business and the investment environment is friendly and open.48\n\nThe two new FM radio stations involved with Melody and others in\n\n30\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\nthe Virgin Megastore were Nogoum FM and Nile FM. These were launched in June 2003 by the Good News Group, founded and headed by Egyptian media magnate, Emadeddin Adeeb. Their status as licensees was not entirely clear, since ERTU officials maintained that the state’s terrestrial broadcasting monopoly (stipulated by Law 13 of 1979) prevented the Good News Group from doing anything more than managing the frequencies on the state’s behalf.49 Nevertheless, the status of Good News itself was clearly that of an expanding and well-connected operation, with six publications and interests in filmmaking and links to the Saudi-owned pay-TV network, Orbit. Emad’s brother, Amr Adeeb, said the government had licensed the Nogoum and Nile radio stations because they had ‘nothing to do with politics, religion or news’ and the Good News Group had shown it could be trusted to abide by the country’s ‘media code of ethics’.50 The group honoured this trust in 2005 when one of its newspapers, AlAlam al-Youm, gave favourable coverage to promises made by President Mubarak in Egypt’s first multi-candidate election campaign. Lamis Hadidi, editor of Al-Alam al-Youm and wife of Amr Adeeb, was also media officer for the Mubarak campaign. Meanwhile Amr Adeeb’s election coverage on Orbit was highly critical of Mubarak’s opponents.51 In light of this, Emad Adeeb was widely seen as a likely candidate for eventual ownership of a private terrestrial television licence. In considering how far Egypt’s television licensing process in 2001– 06 reflected a particular configuration of government–business ties, it should also be noted that arrangements put in place by Decree 411 of 2000 did not give licensees carte blanche to broadcast the content of their choice. Companies such as Dream and Mehwar, which were the first to register, accepted to be part owned by the ERTU. The ERTU meanwhile, as shareholder in the companies behind Media Production City and Nilesat – both essential to private broadcasters’ operations – is also understood to have been represented in stakes held by these two bodies in newly formed private broadcasting ventures.52 The ERTU’s stake in Dream restricted Dream’s scope for producing independent news output, since the ERTU’s own news departments had no interest in promoting competition.53 Moreover, companies operating in the Media Production City free zone are subject to intervention by the Public Authority for Investment and Free Zones, which is authorized to suspend licences.\n\nL AW A N D P OL IC Y O N OW N E R S H I P A N D C O N T E N T\n\n31\n\nAs noted in the introduction to this chapter, liberalization of broadcasting in Morocco raised expectations that competition for audiences, combined with a lively advertising market, would create pressure for transparency and thereby undermine controls exerted through unseen webs of money and power. Anticipation heightened as April 2006 approached, since this was the date on which the CSCA, after some delay, had said it would announce the names of successful licensees. By late 2005 the CSCA had reportedly received 49 applications for radio licences and seven for television channels. It then shortlisted 31 radio proposals, including one from the son of the prime minister, Driss Jettou, and another from Younes Mehdi, son of an army general of the same name.54 Four of the television bids also went through to the next round. One, with Italian backing, aimed to create a music channel called Ritmo TV. Another, backed by a French investor called Pierre Lambert, proposed regional coverage of Casablanca and Marrakesh. A third, envisaging national coverage and general programming, was the project of a former Al-Bayane journalist, Abdelkader Jamal, together with Italian financiers. The fourth, submitted by the group behind Morocco’s long-established private radio station Médi 1, was said to have ambitions to transmit news in French and Arabic to an audience in Morocco and beyond, developing a television version of its existing formula for radio output. The fact that this formula had so far avoided breaking editorial taboos led one knowledgeable blogger to suggest that a prospective Médi 1 TV would compare more closely to the Saudi-owned pan-Arab channel AlArabiya than to its more probing rival, Al-Jazeera. In the event, when the CSCA finally came out with its decision on 10 May 2006, Médi 1 was the only successful applicant for a television licence, obtaining permission to transmit nationally and internationally. A CSCA press release said that other projects would be considered in due course. Jordan, which is often compared to Morocco as an outward-looking monarchy under a relatively young, reform-minded king, was similarly cautious in issuing licences for private terrestrial TV. Applications were not in short supply. Total applications for radio and television networks were reported at 17 in early 2004; two years later, according to Hussein Bani Hani of the Audiovisual Commission, this had risen to 50.55 Of these the commission approved 14 FM radio stations, with fees fixed in accordance with each station’s geographical coverage and\n\n32\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\ntype of output, depending on whether or not this included political content. Applications for 13 satellite channels were also said to be under active consideration in early 2006. But the ten-year terrestrial television licence awarded to the Jordan United Company for TV Broadcasting (ATV) in May 2005, following cabinet approval in late 2004, remained the only one granted by late 2006. This in turn gave ATV time to enter a television market where its only competitor would be JRTVC. The man behind ATV was Mohammed Alayan, owner of Jordan’s second-highest-selling daily newspaper, Al-Ghad, and licence holder for a radio station called Fun FM. Alayan’s family, originally from Hebron, succeeded in agro-industrial trade with Gulf countries, endowing Mohammed with the finance and business acumen to launch the highly profitable Al-Waseet, a vehicle for small classified advertisements, and a ticketing scheme for sports events that offered lottery prizes. Married to a relative of Jordan’s king, Alayan did the government a favour in 2005 by paying JD2 million ($2.83 million) to lease JRTV’s Channel 2 for use by ATV. He was also given a satellite licence and decided to use it, since the extra expense of satellite transmission was minimal compared to the cost of the television venture as a whole. Nevertheless, ATV’s purpose was to fill the gap in television coverage of Jordanian affairs. Although Alayan said his channel would air a mixture of entertainment and political content, he stressed that the latter would aim to ‘shed light’ on local issues.56 The status of state broadcasters Covering local issues was a strong point of neither satellite channels nor state broadcasters in the era before regulatory reform. Television viewers in Morocco complained of being treated like aliens by Gulf-based pan-Arab channels, while people in countries like Syria or Bahrain could not look to pan-Arab channels to deal with their local issues because hindrances placed on local reporters affected correspondents for satellite television too. State broadcasters were meanwhile notorious for neglecting key domestic questions and concentrating instead on the doings of heads of state. In a fairly typical example, Daoud Kuttab recalls how, on the day that news agencies around the world were reporting the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Bethlehem, the Palestine Broadcasting Corporation led its television news bulletins with a package about Yasser Arafat visiting a hospital in Gaza.57 Even\n\nL AW A N D P OL IC Y O N OW N E R S H I P A N D C O N T E N T\n\n33\n\nas late as August 2006, after various attempts to upgrade news reporting within Egypt’s ERTU, Nile News coverage of a train crash north of Cairo gave airtime to officials who promised future safety improvements but shied away from comment or analysis of previous safety lapses and why they had occurred. Examples like these illustrate the potential of competition among terrestrial stations as a means to keep national audiences informed about national or local issues. In those countries without any history of competition at this level, state broadcasters were shielded from pressure to provide the very content that they should have been the first to provide. As competition intensified, either through changes in national regulation or through the impact of the region’s increasingly crowded satellite television landscape, governments finally faced the challenge of deciding their state broadcasters’ value and purpose. Ayman Safadi put his finger on the unmet demand for investigating domestic issues when he was director of Jordan’s state-owned JRTVC. He said in 2003 that JRTVC could stand up to competition if it addressed citizens’ concerns with ‘professionalism and credibility’.58 Safadi repeated this recipe for achieving competitive edge in 2006, only this time he was talking about ATV from his new standpoint as editor of Al-Ghad.59 By giving prominence to a local pollution story neglected by other media, Al-Ghad had just succeeded in triggering remedial action by Jordanian MPs and ministers. In doing so it had demonstrated that covering local stories serves the dual purpose of boosting readership and reminding politicians to represent their constituents. It remained to be seen at that point whether JRTVC would fulfil its promise to use the JD2 million paid for its Channel 2 frequency to improve the quality of programmes on Channel 1. A new JRTVC board, with overall responsibility for quality, was appointed in March 2006. The cabinet put the minister of public sector reform in charge of the corporation and, along with five civilian board members, it named a brigadier general and the head of the Armed Forces Moral Guidance Directorate. Given the risk of private commercial interests silencing coverage of local business controversies, privatization of publicly owned broadcasters is rightly contentious. Despite this, successive Lebanese governments tried hard between 1996 and 2006 to offload the financial burden of maintaining the state’s publicly owned and only non-\n\n34\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\nconfessional television station, Télé-Liban. Its monopoly having been removed without warning under the 1994 Audiovisual Media Law, Télé-Liban had been plunged into competition with more terrestrial channels than Lebanon’s small population and relatively limited pool of local advertising could readily support. An attempt at restructuring Télé-Liban in 2001 started with the government laying off 500 staff, cancelling collective bargaining for the remaining workforce and suspending broadcasts for three months. Then, despite concerns about the national broadcaster falling into non-Lebanese hands, talks took place that appeared to envisage a sale to Saleh Kamel, the Saudi owner of the private pay-TV network, ART.60 By the spring of 2002 negotiations had switched to a ten-year management contract, whereby ART would rent Télé-Liban studios and undertake to upgrade them.61 Ministerial differences of opinion caused that deal to be dropped and, in June 2003, a new information minister put forward a new vision for Télé-Liban. Noting that Lebanon’s economic, legal, political and environmental concerns were not well covered in existing television programming, Michel Samaha said Télé-Liban should deal with these issues in a way that served everyone and not just ‘the privileged’.62 But 2005 saw yet another policy switch, with Télé-Liban’s cumulative losses approaching $100 million and another new information minister urging the cabinet to agree to merge the state television and radio stations as a first step to selling off part of the government’s stake. The minister, Charles Rizk, was quoted as saying that, after privatization, Télé-Liban’s remit would be to serve Lebanese emigrant communities around the world.63 While ERTU losses greatly surpassed those of Télé-Liban, official statements about how to deal with them were equally contradictory. Overstaffing was a contributory factor, but on an altogether different scale; in the absence of precise data about the ERTU workforce the consensus estimate in 2006 was 40,000. According to Mamdouh Beltagi, who held the information portfolio in 2004–05, the ERTU’s cumulative deficit had then reached £E4 billion ($700 million) and was increasing at a rate of £E800 million per year.64 Two years later this looked to have been an underestimate, as most insiders were quoting figures closer to £E7 billion ($1.2 billion). Any plan to tackle the deficit would inevitably involve major redundancies, which in turn would involve costs. One option, carried over from the late 1990s, was\n\nL AW A N D P OL IC Y O N OW N E R S H I P A N D C O N T E N T\n\n35\n\nto sell off one or more of the ERTU’s dozen Nile Thematic Channels. Indeed, Beltagi was rumoured to have promised to sell a channel to Sawiris, in a deal that was scuppered when Fiqi arrived. Fiqi hired Hassan Aboul-Ela, a former BBC journalist and director of Sawiris’s Nahrain channel for Iraq, to serve as deputy information minister with special responsibility for reforming the ERTU. Answering a question about possible privatization, Aboul-Ela said, ‘I can assure you that the family silver is not for sale.’ 65 Yet Fiqi, addressing a parliamentary committee, did raise the possibility of private interests being invited to take strategic stakes in Nile Thematic Channels. His main reservations were that the government should retain control of Nile News and the stake of any private sector partner should not exceed 49 per cent.66 Meanwhile, parliamentary elections in November 2005 provided a chance for the ERTU to try competing with other channels by boosting its credibility. Abdel-Latif al-Manawy, hired from the London-based daily Asharq al-Awsat to become head of ERTU News, increased exposure for viewpoints of candidates not affiliated to the ruling National Democratic Party. However, without formal guarantees of ERTU independence from government, backed by independence for the broadcasting regulator, there was nothing to stop Manawy’s changes from being reversed. Control over Morocco’s broadcast regulator by the Royal Court dampened hopes for the future independence of that country’s state broadcaster. Article 53 of the audiovisual law adopted by parliament in December 2004 said that RTM should become a publicly owned company, the Société Nationale de Radio Télévision (SRNT) du Maroc. SRNT would in turn incorporate the previously separate Service Autonome de Publicité (SAP) as its advertising sales arm, to ensure financial security. Collaboration between RTM and 2M led to higher rates being charged for television advertising in 2004–05, but no sense of a clear broadcasting strategy or mission beyond supporting government policies. As for the publicly funded Palestinian broadcaster established in 1993, it also caused disappointment for those who had imagined that Palestinian television could break with the precedent of government censorship set almost everywhere else in the Arab world. During the first year after the 1993 Oslo Accords, the newly created Palestinian public broadcaster operated from an East Jerusalem office belonging to its self-appointed head, Radwan Abu Ayyash. Abu Ayyash\n\n36\n\nA R A B T E L E V I S IO N T ODAY\n\nand his colleagues rejected the title Palestinian Broadcasting Authority in favour of ‘Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation’ (PBC), inspired by the BBC. However, once Arafat was installed in Gaza as head of the PA, and with access to transmission facilities in Ramallah affected by continuing Israeli occupation, Palestinian television’s West Bank headquarters became subordinate to its Gaza control room, housed inside Arafat’s Gaza base and headed by Hisham Mekki.67 Mekki was assassinated in 2001 in a killing claimed by the ‘anti-corruption unit’ of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. After Arafat’s death in 2004, the PA’s new president, Mahmoud Abbas, initiated changes in oversight of the PBC and the Palestinian Satellite Channel. Whereas these had previously come under the PLO Executive Committee and PA presidency, they were transferred in April 2005 to the ministry of information. The information minister, Nabil Shaath, merged them into a single corporation, in a move that was said to make the PBC publicly accountable for the first time, for both its budget and appointments. But, pending further restructuring, it also put the corporation firmly under the executive branch of government. When the Islamic resistance movement, Hamas, was elected to form a Palestinian government in January 2006, Abbas moved all official media outlets, including PBC, away from the ministry of information and affiliated them to his own presidential office. Moves to separate the state broadcaster from the government made slow headway in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Saudi Radio and Television and the Saudi Press Agency, formerly part of the ministry of information, were turned into public corporations in 2002, but under a board of directors chaired by the minister of culture and information.68 The transition was followed by expansion of the state television network to include a sports channel and a 24-hour satellite news channel. According to Iyad Madani, the information minister, speaking in 2005, the network needed to be strengthened and its regulations revised before the private sector could ‘take part’ in its activities.69 In Kuwait, the state broadcaster’s eventual sale to the private sector was raised as a possibility in May 2006. But the information minister, Mohammed al-Sanousi, said that both Kuwait TV and Kuwait Radio would remain affiliated to the government for the time being.70 For the UAE, with seven constituent emirates, questions about the future of state broadcasting applied to more than one organization,\n\nL AW A N D P OL IC Y O N OW N E R S H I P A N D C O N T E N T\n\n37\n\nas recognized in the presence of representatives of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah television on the National Media Authority that replaced the ministry of information in 2006. Abu Dhabi’s Emirates Media Incorporated agreed in March 2006 to let Al Nisr Publishing take over the running of two of its radio channels in a deal that covered both advertising sales and editorial. As producer of the long-established daily Gulf News and numerous other publications, Al Nisr’s Obaid Humaid al-Tayer had proved himself to the UAE leadership as a safe pair of hands.

Sayegh said that people who used the airwaves to complain about life in the UAE should ask themselves whether they should be in the country. ‘If we want our government to open up we have to show them we have to be loyal,’ he said.71 Content regulation If structural regulation of Arab television ownership and licensing is designed to minimize government critics’ access to the airwaves, the density of additional regulations controlling the content of television programmes shows that senior government figures are not prepared to leave anything to chance. Private channel licensees risk going out of business if they upset the licensor. MTV in Lebanon, one of the first four terrestrial channels to be licensed under Lebanon’s Audiovisual Media Law of 1994, found to its cost in 2002 that certain types of content could lead to long-term closure, as will be discussed below. But private channels also risk going out of business if non-government advertisers suspect that they are failing to attract viewers. Repeated warnings issued to Egypt’s Dream TV about its political content72 demonstrate the fine line between, on the one hand, attracting audiences by showing programmes that are relevant and different from other channels and, on the other, abiding by vaguely worded prohibitions on criticizing people in power.
