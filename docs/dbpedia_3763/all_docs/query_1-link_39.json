        "text": "1: Ryan Higgins: We had a great experience. Our son studied with Ms Hall, Ms Akram, Mr Chapman and Ms Reham, all of whom are naturally gifted teachers and down to earth/kindhearted people. Students study music, computers, drama and a variety of sports, and the kids have lots of opportunities for socialising and public speaking practice. The school sends daily updates through Class Dojo, so you never feel out of the loop. Plus, the parents that make up the community are very supportive and regularly organise get togethers and other extra curricular activities. 2: Reza Langeroodi: The most important is my daughter love her school and feel happy there. They consider and care about her special case ( didnâ€™t know language properly at the beginning and didnâ€™t attend to school before as worldwide situation last 2 years). Professional with great personality, friendly teachers ( Mr. Chapman, Miss Mona, Miss Grace,â€¦), management( Mr. Dickson,â€¦) and all staff. She surprised us when speaking about Mindfulness, art ,â€¦â€¦ 3: Nathalie Payet: My son absolutely loves his school â€“ from the teachers to the students. The curriculum is engaging and the teachers are absolutely amazing. A big shout out to Mrs McKenna and Ms Alice who integrates compassion and empathy into their teaching standards, emphasizes the importance of values, cares for the childrenâ€™s well-being and this is highly displayed through each of their classes and lessons. Highly recommend:-) 3: Awaii Awa: I have a good experience with this school I am so happy with my kids progress and when I call Ms. Hanan she is always cheerful and helpful at most of the time she is great person to deal with. Ms.Huda as well she is great and so cooperative with us and respond in timly manner. 2: Farhat Riffat: My children LOVE this school â€“ from the teachers to the students to the challenging curriculum. School integrates compassion into their teaching standards, emphasizes the importance of values, and builds leaders through each of their classes and lessons. Very safe, very caring staff. Everyone, from the administration to the teachers and staff, everyone really care about the students. 3: Hareem: As a student here, Iâ€™d say that this school is absolutely amazing and safe! Everyone here is super friendly, the teachers are great, and the fact that they look after the non-native students makes me happy as a non-native student. This school, in my opinion is definitely the best! ðŸ˜€ 2: Adithri Poonghat Sajeesh: Great school! IHS is all about good relations with your teachers and schoolmates! The way of teaching here is exceptionally good! I am really proud to have been a part of the IHS family since LKG! 3: alin mariya: This is the best school ever. I think this school is not about studies itâ€™s the best for memories. I love indian school ras al khaimah and Iâ€™m very proud for been a part of it. The school is just a bang of memories apart from its academic records it actually allows students to have a healthy relationship with teachers and friends. 1: Flora 2022: One of the best schools in Ras Al Khaimah, I am so happy I changed from Rak Academy, the environment is very friendly, the whole community is like a family, everyone is valued and appreciated. Highly recommended. 2: khaledledledledled the first: wellspring is the best school i have ever been to and this is my 4th school yet, they strive in learning and helping the students improve in all ways including social skills, learning and just overall helps people become better and add to your memories! this is after 6 months of learning at the best rak school."
