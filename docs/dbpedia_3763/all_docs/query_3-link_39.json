        "text": "JO\n\nJonathan 30 January 2006 8:57pm\n\nthemagicmonkey posted:\n\nThe depressingly high number of people who spew out nonsense about things they don't understand. On this board it was specifically Jonathan (and all new Phil's dad!).\n\nI think everyone is entitled to what they believe in, otherwise isn't that a suspension of free speech? Have you ever spoken to those Muslim viewers who find the channel biased towards Israel? Have you noted down the various staff in the past who have stirred up controversy such as Taysir Allouini and Akram Khuzam? I know every channel will have its problems, just look at the BBC and the whole Gilligan affair. I hope the new international channel will be a good rival to CNN. And finally, don't assume I don't understand anything about this matter, because I do. I think the only problem you have with what I've said is that it was mostly my opinion, so sorry.\n\nPermalink\n\nZO\n\nzola25 31 January 2006 8:32pm\n\nwondered where she had gone. Good luck to her i say she was the only reason i watched ITV news. She seems smart enough to know the problems working for them may cause. Will it be a free to air channel or will you have to subscribe to it\n\nPermalink"
