Alhurra is funded by the U.S. government[1] and is barred from broadcasting within the United States itself under the 1948 Smith-Mundt Act.\n\nQuick Facts Type, Country ...\n\nClose\n\nIts stated mission is to provide \"objective, accurate and relevant news and information\" to its audience while seeking to \"support democratic values\" and \"expand the spectrum of ideas, opinions, and perspectives\" available in the region's media.[2] The network has also tried to distinguish itself from its numerous regional competitors by providing access to more in-depth coverage of U.S. issues and policies and coverage of a broader range of opinions and perspectives than normally heard on other Arab television networks.[2]\n\nAlhurra began broadcasting on 14 February 2004 to 22 countries across the Middle East and North Africa. It has established itself as the third highest-rated pan-Arab news channel, surpassing viewership ratings for the BBC (English and Arabic), France 24 Arabic, RT Arabic, CCTV, CNNi, and Sky Arabia."
