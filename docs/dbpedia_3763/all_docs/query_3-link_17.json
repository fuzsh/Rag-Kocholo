        "text": "There are currently three major 24-hour satellite-television news channels in the Arab world: Qatar's Al-Jazeera, the Dubai-based Al-Arabiyah, and the U.S.-funded Alhurra. In addition, more than 10 percent of the more than 200 free channels available via satellite are devoted to news, according to the \"International Herald Tribune\" on June 20.\n\nThose channels will soon be joined by new, state-funded satellite television entries from France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and now, Russia.\n\nFinancial Support\n\nIn an interview with the \"Financial Times\" of 15 June, a RIA Novosti source said that the news outlet's new Arabic-language service will be an independent project comparable in expenditure to Russia Today, the international English-language news network RIA Novosti launched last year. \"The Arabic service will cost $35 million, while whole Russia Today costs $30 million,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the pro-Kremlin website km.ru, the goal of the new channel is \"to reassert Russia's political influence in the Middle East and to confront international mass media that have a critical position toward the Russian Federation.\"\n\nRIA Novosti's project will be headed by the former Moscow bureau chief of Al-Jazeera, Akram Khuzam. Khuzam, who had headed the bureau since it was launched in 1996, was fired in September -- reportedly after running afoul of Russia's Muslim community.\n\nAl-Jazeera Director Wadah Khanfar, whose station's policies have often been criticized by the United States, said that his station welcomes the appearance of a Russian channel, \"Izvestia\" reported on June 20. \"Russia can present her opinion on the air,\" Khanfar said, \"and viewers will only gain from that.\"\n\nNikolai Shepelev, the chief of the international department of Rossia television's news program \"Vesti,\" told km.ru that the main task of Russia's Arabic-language television channel will be to provide not only news, but a window into the mentality of the Russian people.\n\nThe topics will be addressed through a prism of traditional Islam so that \"ordinary citizens of a Muslim state can understand nuances of life in the Russian Federation,\" Shepelev said.\n\nCounter To U.S."
