Abderrahmane Mssassi had also been at Easter Road

Dundee United have ended their interest in trialists Abderrahmane Mssassi and Franck Matingou but have given Marcel Licka the chance to impress.

Czech midfielder Licka, 29, still under contract to Groclin in Poland, scored a goal for Viktoria Zizkov that knocked Rangers out the Uefa Cup in 2002.

While Licka is on trial, United have ended interest in midfielder Matingou after Bastia demanded a transfer fee.

Midfielder Mssassi, previously of Maghreb Fes, failed to win a contract.

The 21-year-old midfielder, who also had a trial with Hibernian, was on target in the 2-1 win against Falkirk reserves.

United manager Craig Brewster told the Evening Telegraph: "To be fair to the boy, he did okay in the two games he played for us, but he is not the type of player we need right now, so I won't be adding him to the squad."

Meanwhile, defender Paul Ritchie and forward David Fernandez, both of whom are surplus to requirements at Tannadice, remain at the club.

"The players have agreed deals to go, it's now just a matter of how the payments will be made to them," said Brewster. Brewster himself injured a shoulder against Falkirk reserves, against whom he scored the winner.

However, he hopes to be fit for the visit of Dunfermline Athletic on Saturday.
