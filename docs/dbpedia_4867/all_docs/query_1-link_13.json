        "text": "Franck Matingou is still with Bastia\n\nDundee United have cut short midfielder Franck Matingou's trial claiming that Bastia reneged on a promise to give the Congo international a free transfer.\n\nUnited manager Craig Brewster said: \"Bastia told Franck he could go for nothing in the summer.\n\n\"But, when we asked for clearance to play him in the reserves, they started talking about a fee.\n\n\"I have sent him home to sort things out because it is really not an issue we want to get involved in.\"\n\nFrance-born 26-year-old Matingou is a former team-mate of ex-Rangers defender Gregory Vignal and has returned to his homeland in attempt to win a release.\n\n\"\"A fee was never part of the deal because his agent assured us it would be a free transfer. It is between him and his club,\" said Brewster.\n\n\"If he gets it resolved, he will come back to complete the trial, but we are not interested if the terms of the thing have changed.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Moroccan midfielder Abderrahmane Mssassi, who recently spent a few weeks at Hibernian, has agreed to stay on next week in an attempt to win a contract.\n\nMssassi was previously with MAS Fez."
