        "text": "Five titles are currently announced for a home video release this April from Arrow, although one of them looks to be UK only so you may have to import that one.\n\nOne of their most anticipated releases to the 4K format this month is Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys - 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray starring Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, and Brad Pitt arriving on April 26th (U.S./Canada/UK).\n\nTHE FUTURE IS HISTORY\n\nFollowing the commercial and critical success of The Fisher King, Terry Gilliam next feature would turn to science fiction and a screenplay by Janet and David Peoples (Blade Runner, Unforgiven) inspired by Chris Marker’s classic short film La Jetée.\n\nIn 1996, a deadly virus is unleashed by a group calling themselves the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, destroying much of the world’s population and forcing survivors underground. In 2035, prisoner James Cole (Bruce Willis, Die Hard) is chosen to go back in time and help scientists in their search for a cure.\n\nFeaturing an Oscar-nominated turn by Brad Pitt (Fight Club) as mental patient Jeffrey Goines, Twelve Monkeys would become Gilliam’s most successful film and is now widely regarded as a sci-fi classic. Arrow Films are proud to present the film in a stunning new restoration.\n\n4K UHD BLU-RAY SPECIAL EDITION FEATURES\n\nBrand new restoration from a 4K scan of the original negative by Arrow Films, approved by director Terry Gilliam\n\n4K (2160p) UHD Blu-ray presentation in Dolby Vision (HDR10 compatible)\n\nLossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and 2.0 stereo soundtracks\n\nOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing\n\nAudio commentary by Terry Gilliam and producer Charles Roven\n\nThe Hamster Factor and Other Tales of Twelve Monkeys, feature-length making-of documentary by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe (Lost in La Mancha)\n\nThe Film Exchange with Terry Gilliam, a 1996 interview with Gilliam and critic Jonathan Romney, recorded at the London Film Festival\n\nAppreciation by Ian Christie, author of Gilliam on Gilliam\n\nThe Twelve Monkeys Archives\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Gary Pullin\n\nGUARANTEED THROUGH PREORDERS ONLY FIRST PRESSING ONLY: Illustrated collector’s booklet featuring writing on the film by Nathan Rabin and Ian Christie\n\nNext on Blu-ray, we have Chia-Liang Liu's action-drama The 8 Diagram Pole Fighter on April 5th (U.S./Canada) at that.\n\nAfter one of its lead actors (cherub-faced action icon Alexander Fu Sheng) unexpectedly died midway through production, master director Lau Kar-leung (The 36th Chamber of Shaolin) retooled his latest martial arts epic, The 8 Diagram Pole Fighter, as the ultimate action spectacular in tribute to the fallen star.\n\nLoosely based upon the legendary Yang dynasty chronicled in Chinese folklore, the film starts as the family patriarch and all but two of his sons are brutally wiped out in a bloody battle. One surviving son (Fu Sheng) returns to his mother and two sisters, deeply traumatized; the other (Gordon Liu) escapes and joins a nearby monastery while in hiding. Once he learns his sister (Kara Hui) has been captured by their enemies, however, the warrior-turned-monk realizes he must renounce his peaceful ideals in order to mount a rescue mission and avenge his family.\n\nMade during the legendary Shaw Brothers studio’s twilight years as a filmmaking powerhouse, The 8 Diagram Pole Fighter is often regarded as director Lau’s masterpiece, as elegiac and suffused with anguish as it is thrillingly violent (not least in its bone-crunching, teeth-smashing climax).\n\nBLU-RAY SPECIAL EDITION FEATURES\n\nBrand new 2K restoration from the original camera negative by Arrow Films\n\nHigh Definition (1080p) Blu-ray presentation\n\nOriginal lossless Cantonese, Mandarin and English mono audio\n\nOptional English subtitles, plus hard-of-hearing subtitles for the English dub\n\nBrand new commentary by Jonathan Clements, author of A Brief History of China\n\nNewly filmed appreciation by film critic and historian Tony Rayns\n\nInterviews with stars Gordon Liu, Lily Li and Yeung Ching-ching, filmed by Frédéric Ambroisine in 2004\n\nA Tribute to Fu Sheng, a short film commemorating the late actor that played before early screenings of The 8 Diagram Pole Fighter, presented via a German-dubbed telecine (the best available copy) with English subtitles\n\nAlternate opening credits, as The Invincible Pole Fighters\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nImage gallery\n\nReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Marc Aspinall\n\nOn the 19th comes the two film set Rogue Cops and Racketeers: Two Crime Thrillers from Enzo G. Castellari .(U.S./Canada/UK).\n\nOver a long and wide-ranging career, director Enzo G. Castellari (Keoma, The Inglorious Bastards) helmed some of the most infamous of all the poliziotteschi – the gritty, action-packed crime films that proliferated in Italy throughout the 70s. Buckle up for a heart-stopping thrill ride through the seedy underbelly of Italian society in two of his most celebrated thrillers!\n\nIn 1976’s The Big Racket, Inspector Nico Palmieri (Fabio Testi, What Have You Done to Solange?) is hot on the heels of a gang of ruthless racketeers. Realizing he’s not going to get anywhere within the confines of the law, Nico recruits a crack squad of civilians to dole out their own brand of justice. Then, in 1977’s The Heroin Busters, rule-flouting cop Fabio (Testi) goes deep undercover, chasing a globe-trotting ring of drug-smugglers suspected to be operating out of Rome. But can he and Mike Hamilton (David Hemmings, Deep Red), an Interpol agent with a hair-trigger temper, stay one step ahead of the criminals long enough to bring them down from the inside?\n\nFeaturing death-defying stunts, explosive shoot-outs and a pair of addictive, toe-tapping soundtracks courtesy of the De Angelis brothers (Torso) and legendary prog rock group Goblin (Suspiria), these two films represent the crème de la crème of the Italian crime thriller, both making their high definition debuts with stunning new restorations in this feature-packed box set from Arrow!\n\n2-DISC LIMITED EDITION CONTENTS\n\nBrand new 2K restorations of both films from the original 35mm camera negatives by Arrow Films\n\nHigh Definition Blu-ray™ (1080p) presentations\n\nOriginal Italian and English front and end titles\n\nRestored original lossless mono Italian and English soundtracks\n\nNewly translated English subtitles for the Italian soundtracks\n\nOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for the English soundtracks\n\nNew audio commentaries on both films by critics Adrian J.

Sardonic, provocative, unsettling, Chabrol’s films cut to the quick with a clarity and honesty honed to razor sharpness.\n\nThe Swindle (Rien Ne Va Plus) sees Chabrol at perhaps his most playful as a pair of scam artists, Isabelle Huppert and Michel Serrault, get in over their heads. But who is scamming who and who do you trust in a life built on so many lies? The murder of a 10 year old girl sparks rumours and gossip in The Color of Lies (Au Coeur Du Mensonge), as suspicion falls on René (Jacques Gamblin) the dour once famous painter, now art teacher, who was the last person to see her alive. Enigmatic, perverse, seductive, Isabelle Huppert encapsulates everything that makes Nightcap (Merci Pour Le Chocolat) a film John Waters calls “Cinematic Perfection” in this tale of suppressed family secrets. Finally, in The Flower of Evil (La Fleur Du Mal), incest, old money and intergenerational guilt come under the scalpel as an outwardly perfect bourgeois family begins to unravel when the wife involves herself in politics.\n\nThough influenced by Fritz Lang, Alfred Hitchcock and Jean Renoir, Chabrol’s voice was entirely and assuredly his own, influencing in turn filmmakers like Bong Joon-ho, James Gray and Dominik Moll. His amused, unblinkered view of life and refusal to judge his characters makes his films timelessly relevant and accessible to all. Arrow Video is proud to present this second collection of films by Claude Chabrol with a wealth of new and archival extras.\n\nBLU-RAY LIMITED EDITION FEATURES\n\nHigh definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentations of all four films\n\nNew 4K restorations of The Swindle (Rien Ne Va Plus), Nightcap (Merci Pour Le Chocolat) and The Flower of Evil (La Fleur Du Mal)\n\nOriginal lossless PCM French stereo audio on all films plus DTS-HD 5.1 on Nightcap (Merci Pour Le Chocolat) and The Flower of Evil (La Fleur Du Mal)\n\nOptional English subtitles\n\n80-page collector’s booklet of new writing by Sean Hogan, Brad Stevens, Catherine Dousteyessier-Khoze, Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, and Pamela Hutchinson\n\nLimited edition packaging featuring newly commissioned artwork by Tony Stella\n\nDISC ONE – THE SWINDLE (RIEN NE VA PLUS)\n\nBrand new audio commentary by film critic Barry Forshaw and author Sean Hogan\n\nChabrol’s “Soap Bubble”, a brand new visual essay by Catherine Dousteyssier-Khoze, author of Claude Chabrol: The Aesthetics of Opacity exploring the games Chabrol plays with his characters and audience\n\nFilm as a Family Affair, Cécile Maistre-Chabrol, the stepdaughter of Claude Chabrol and his Assistant Director on fourteen features discusses his life, work and wisdom in this exclusive new hour plus interview\n\nBehind the scenes featurette\n\nArchive interview with Isabelle Huppert\n\nArchive introduction by film scholar Joël Magny\n\nSelect scene commentaries by director Claude Chabrol\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nImage gallery\n\nDISC TWO – THE COLOR OF LIES (AU COEUR DU MENSONGE)\n\nBrand new audio commentary by critic Barry Forshaw and author Sean Hogan\n\nNothing is Sacred, a brand new visual essay by film critic Scout Tafoya examining the ideas of art and legacy in Chabrol’s The Color of Lies (Au Coeur Du Mensonge)\n\nWhat’s Eating Claude Chabrol? a brand new appreciation by film critic David Kalat examining the ways in which Chabrol’s films relate, reflect and refract each other\n\nBehind the scenes featurette\n\nArchive introduction by film scholar Joël Magny\n\nSelect scene commentaries by director Claude Chabrol\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nImage gallery\n\nDISC THREE – NIGHTCAP (MERCI POUR LE CHOCOLAT)\n\nBrand new audio commentary by film critic Justine Smith\n\nWhen I pervert good…, a brand new visual essay by film critic Scout Tafoya which takes a closer look at late period Chabrol through the lens of his masterful thriller Nightcap (Merci Pour Le Chocolat)\n\nArchive interview with Isabelle Huppert\n\nArchive interview with Jacques Dutronc\n\nBehind the scenes featurette\n\nScreen test for Anna Mouglalis\n\nArchive introduction by film scholar Joël Magny\n\nSelect scene commentaries by director Claude Chabrol\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nImage gallery\n\nDISC FOUR – THE FLOWER OF EVIL (LA FLEUR DU MAL)\n\nBrand new audio commentary by film critic Farran Smith Nehme\n\nBehind the Masks: Remembering Claude Chabrol, a brand new appreciation by Agnès C.

The 4K disc itself will be all regions but the bonus features are Region B.\n\nWidely heralded as one of the greatest serial killer movies of all time, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer presents a bleak and unflinching dive into the mind of a mass murderer.\n\nRecently released from prison, the nomadic Henry (Michael Rooker, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Walking Dead) finds temporary abode in the rundown Chicago lodgings of a former jail acquaintance and small-time drug dealer, Otis (Tom Towles). Hiding behind his unremarkable employment as a pest exterminator, Henry leads a double life, prowling the streets by night on a brutal and apparently motiveless killing spree. As the bodies mount up, Otis finds himself inducted into Henry’s dark secret world, but when Otis’ sister Becky (Tracy Arnold) moves in, herself fleeing from an uncomfortable domestic situation, it quickly becomes apparent that two’s company, but three’s a crowd.\n\nBased on the horrific true-life crimes of Henry Lee Lucas, the harrowing controversial debut feature from John McNaughton (Mad Dog and Glory, Wild Things) returns to the UK in its best-looking release ever, in a new 4K restoration supervised by the director himself.\n\n4K UHD BLU-RAY LIMITED EDITION FEATURES\n\nBrand new 4K restoration from the original camera negatives, approved by John McNaughton\n\n4K (2160p) UHD Blu-ray presentation in HDR10\n\nOriginal 2.0 stereo mix and 5.1 DTS-HD Master audio\n\nEnglish subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing\n\nReversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Eric Adrian Lee\n\nLimited edition 60-page booklet featuring new writing by Shaun Kimber, Peter Vronsky, Alexandra Heller-Nicholas and Julian Petley\n\nBooklet containing the original storyboards for Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\n\nDouble-sided fold-out poster\n\nSix collector’s postcards (Limited Edition exclusive)\n\nDISC ONE – FEATURE & EXTRAS (4K ULTRA HD BLU-RAY)\n\nBrand new 4K restoration from the original camera negatives\n\n4K (2160p) UHD Blu-ray presentation in Dolby Vision (HDR10 compatible)\n\nBrand new audio commentary by John McNaughton & Steven A.
