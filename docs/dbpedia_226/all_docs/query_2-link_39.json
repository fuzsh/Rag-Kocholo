As night envelops the sprawling estate, a chilling murder shatters the silence, and an enigmatic game of survival begins. Among the guests is the sharp-eyed Victoria Writer, an antique dealer with a knack for uncovering hidden truths. The eerie mansion, with its ghostly whispers and hidden passageways, becomes the stage for a harrowing quest to unveil the killer. But the deceased are not silent; the spirits of the mansion's tumultuous past, including the legendary detectives Sherlock Holmes and Watson, materialize to guide Victoria. These spectral sleuths wield their famed deductive skills from beyond the grave. With each thunderous heartbeat, secrets unravel, alliances form, and the line between the living and the dead blurs. As the storm rages on, someof the guest meet a grim fate, it becomes clear: the killer is among them, and no one is safe. Will Victoria, aided by the ghostly echoes of deduction, unmask the murderer before the night is out? Or will the mansion claim them all, swallowing secrets as dark and vast as its shadowed halls? #UNIVERSAL #FOCUSFEATURES #PARAMOUNT #DREAMWORKS #MTV #WARNERBROS #NEWLINE #MIRAMAX #20thCenturyFOX #FOX2000 #SONY #MGM\n\nTrailer Reaction - KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON A New Hobby - An Attempt at Understanding Classical Cinema #killersoftheflowermoon #scorsese #martinscorsese #osagemurders #moviereview Directed by the auteur filmmaker Martin Scorsese, based on David Grann’s best-selling book, KOTFM will be a stunning political thriller about the serial murders of the Osage Tribe members between 1921-1926, a phase now known as, \"The Osage Reign of Terror\". The philosophical core of the Movie will be about how human greed won't stop at anything - even if that requires wiping out an entire tribe! After the US Government allocated lands to the Osage Tribe, they initially struggled to survive on those lands, since they were all barren, wasted lands capable of producing nothing. The entire plotline will revolve around the Osages' discovery of oil on their lands and how that turns them from the oppressed to being the ones in power, and then how suddenly a chain of murders begin - an investigation committee was set up finally, the Bureau of Investigation, the organisation we today know as the FBI. **Characters:** *William Hale* Robert De Niro - an apparent benefactor of the Osage Tribe. *SPOILER TIP: Keep an eye on him!* *Ernest Burkhart* Leonardo DiCaprio - the brother-in-law of the Osage girl who'll be murdered first - Anna Brown. *Mollie Burkhart* Lily Gladstone, sister of Anna Brown. P.S. Connecting the Dots #1 The scene where The Osages discover Oil will be epic - be ready for serious goosebumps! The BGM matches fantastically. #2 The scene where we see a burning house will be Anna's another sister - whose house would be set on fire by the culprits. #3 The scene where we see a funeral, and Mollie Burkhart grieving, will represent the very first murder within the tribe - the one of Anna Brown. #4 The complex layered relationship between William Hale (Robert De Niro) and Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) will be a treat to watch.\n\nNew Post: ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ ending: where does it leave Wade and Logan? - https://lnkd.in/gyphiS5j - Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman form a dynamic duo in Deadpool &amp; Wolverine. Set six years after events in Deadpool 2, the film sees Wade Wilson (Reynolds) pulled out of retirement by the Time Variance Authority for a new mission to save the universe with Wolverine (Jackman). READ MORE: ‘Deadpool &amp; Wolverine’ review: a sarky, time-skipping superhero send-up Directed by Shawn Levy (Free Guy), the superhero sequel is the first Deadpool film set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe after 20th Century Fox was acquired by Disney. Other cast members include Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova and Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Paradox, while Morena Baccarin, Rob Delaney, Leslie Uggams, and Karan Soni reprise their roles from previous Deadpool outings. What happens at the end of Deadpool &amp; Wolverine? Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds in ‘Deadpool &amp; Wolverine’. Credit: Disney/Marvel Studios As Cassandra Nova threatens to destroy the multiverse using the Time Ripper, Deadpool and Wolverine manage to successfully shut it down by working together to divert the energy blasts. As the Time Ripper explodes, Cassandra Nova is destroyed. Despite it being billed as a joint sacrifice to save the multiverse, the duo are, in fact, perfectly alive. As Dr. Paradox is imprisoned for his crimes against the Time Variance Authority, Wade and Logan get some shawarma, only to be greeted by Dogpool, who has made it out of the Void and is now residing in Earth-10005. As Logan tells Wade he won’t be sticking around, we later see the opposite is true, as Wade introduces him to his roommate Blind Al. Logan and the rest of Wade’s friends are all then seen hanging out together in his apartment, showing he’s now part of his inner circle. While the pair’s future role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is unclear, they end the film, at least, seeing eye-to-eye as friends. Is there a post-credits scene? After the credits have rolled, there’s one small scene where Deadpool, in the offices of the Time Variance Authority, sets out to prove he’s not the one responsible for Johnny Storm’s (Chris Evans) death after being accused of putting words in his mouth. Deadpool plays back the footage from when him, Wolverine, Johnny are locked in a cage earlier in the film, only with previously unseen dialogue where Johnny insults Cassandra Nova in very graphic detail – proving that Deadpool was telling the truth all along.

Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the sequel to 2021’s Dune picks up as Paul Atreides unites with the Fremen people on Arrakis to wage war against House Harkonnen. READ MORE: ‘Dune: Part Two’ review: sandworm-sized sequel should blow a hole in the box office Along with Timothée Chalamet, Dune: Part Two stars Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Zendaya, Charlotte Rampling, Austin Butler and Florence Pugh. The sequel adapts the second half of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel, which has been adapted for the screen several times over the years. Has a sequel to Dune: Part Two been announced? Zendaya plays Fremen warrior Chani. CREDIT: Warner Bros. At the time of writing (March 2024), a sequel has not been officially announced. Judging by how successful both entries have been at the box office, however, it’s certainly likely that Warner Bros. is considering a follow-up. There is plenty of material left to adapt too. Frank Herbert wrote six Dune novels in total, with the second being 1969’s Dune Messiah which continues the story of Paul Atreides. What has been said about a third Dune movie? Director Denis Villeneuve has confirmed a screenplay exists for a third film, although it sounds like there might be a significant wait before it comes to fruition. Speaking to The Times, Villeneuve said: “There is absolutely a desire to have a third one, but I don’t want to rush it. The danger in Hollywood is that people get excited and only think about release dates, not quality.” During a press conference with Korean media in December last year (via Variety), Villeneuve said a screenplay for a third movie is “almost finished” but that he might “do something in between” for his “mental sanity”. As such, it sounds like production on any sequel could be a few years down the line. A long gap between Dune: Part Two and a sequel would make narrative sense too. Dune Messiah picks up 12 years after the original novel, so unless they rely on makeup to accomodate the time jump, it might be logical to return when the cast is older.

L. Blankenship) If you've been reading my reviews then you know that WESLEY DODDS SANDMAN #1-6 (now available in Trade Paperback) completely sold me on an old character that I knew nothing about, causing me to buy this book. I've now read the 2nd & third arcs & it pulls no punches. Thus far we've went from women being chained in basements, tortured, & gutted, to the wholesale slaughter of Asians in Chinatown with a hatchet, to underground fights, drug use, child molesters, rich pious woman-hating rapists, racial slurs & epithets amid the melting pot that is 1930s New York City. Besides that we also venture into Wesley Dodds dark dreams. Specifically, in \"The Brute\" saga he envisions himself – yet not himself – on a desolate plain as what would become the character DREAM/MORPHIUS/THE SANDMAN. If you know who that is – yes, like the one that Neil Gaiman writes – he's wearing the mask & cloak that you're imagining right now. I will tell you this book via the storytelling alone is nothing short of outstanding. It's dark & maybe too disturbing for some – but then I've watched horror movies that people say the general public can't handle & written horror novels & stories so extreme that they've been compared to Jack Ketchum's stuff. Honestly, they're vastly more vile & violent. I could name far better comparative authors, but they're far less famous. Stories as violent as I've penned in literature are considerably within the kinda/sorta niche world of Splatterpunk. According to one author, my great virtue is that I can write an array of styles and not just like that – whereas he claimed that was the only way that many of the Splatterpunk writers could write, but I digress. I like depth, dark crime dramas, horror, noir, nostalgia, and the like. Ergo, WESLEY DODDS (later a card carrying member of the JSA in his chronology) is really a dream come true. The next arcs & the original issues that they covered within this TP are: THE VAMP (13-16) • THE SCORPION (17-20) • ANNUAL #1 • DR. DEATH (21-24) • NIGHT OF THE BUTCHER (25-28) • THE HOURMAN (29-32) • THE PYTHON (33-36) By the time that I finish this compendium, I hope that the 2nd one is out reaching to issue 70 of the series (which was where the internet says that it ended). Outstanding stuff, y'all.\n\nWhy the Raiders of the Lost Ark Soundtrack is In My Top 10 Greatest Film Scores Ever Made Since the Dawn of Humankind👇 (Part 1 of a God-Knows-How-Long series, because apparently I’ve given this subject way too much thought.) The first two reasons: 1. A John Williams film score tells a story—even if you remove the movie. I LOVE stories, including musical ones. The Raiders tracks lift me up and move me from one chapter to the next and keep me listening intensely, the way a good book keeps me reading, and the only reason I’ll pause is if one of my children is hungry or bleeding. How many film scores all by themselves can boast the same? 2. The INDIVIDUAL THEMES. Good gracious. In this single movie the man has created a sumptuous multitude of distinctive, evocative signatures for specific characters (Indy, Marion, the Nazis), creatures (the spiders, the snakes), locations (Peru, Marshall College—and note that musically we’re taken from Peru TO Marshall College in the same movement!—Nepal, Egypt) and even OBJECTS (the Ark, the Medallion that sits atop the Staff of Ra, the poisoned dates). I like a lot of film composers, but even the best of them don’t come close to producing the sheer output of themes like John Williams, and Raiders positively crackles with them. So much more to gush about. Part 2 on the way!\n\nIs 'Maxxxine' a Slasher or a Satirical Horror Noir? https://ift.tt/E7caCOG Ti West and Mia Goth's X trilogy as a whole is somewhat tricky to define. What started as a subversive slasher depicting the \"Texas Porn Star Massacre\" in X jumped back in time to reveal the star-driven origins of its murderous, elderly villains with Pearl, only to then jump back to the 80s for the newly released Maxxxine, tying together the central threads of Mia Goth's titular final girl and how she copes with the trauma of survival. Horror genre fans are no stranger to untraditional sequels (boy do they love to defy tradition), but taking that a step further, Ti West made a name for himself with his trademark slow burn pastiche executed to perfection in House of the Devil and The Inkeepers. Working within his first set of sequels, its no surprise he upped the ante to take Maxxxine a step further and subvert on another layer. Maxxxine isn't with out its slasher influences, nods, and winks of course. That being said, if we examine it through a strictly analytical level would it still be considered a traditional \"slasher\" film, structurally or otherwise? I personally think not, and its all the better for it. Where X is more in conversation with Tobe Hooper, Maxxxine is more in conversation with Brian De Palma and Roman Polanksi (Pearl is a different ball game, but that's for another article). Let's break down Maxxxine from a structural perspective and explore its genius use of genre pastiche. Beware, spoilers for Maxxxine follow! Reliance on Off-Screen Kills Don't get me wrong, Maxxxine isn't without it's visceral on-screen violence. But something that stuck out to me was that most of the kills from the central \"slasher\" villain happened off screen, and we only see the investigation of the murders afterward. There is one exception in Maxine's super cool, video store clerk friend Leon (Moses Sumney, R.I.P. king), but otherwise most of the carnage is lightly scattered throughout in other ways. We have Maxine and co. creatively taking care of Kevin Bacon's John Labat, some gnarly visuals and atmospheric scares from Maxine's traumatic past, some cultish fun, and then of course that wild climactic shootout. But, as far as tradition slasher villain-victim kills? Very light to near absent. Atmospherically the slasher essence is extremely present with the constant reminder of The Night Stalker haunting 1980's Los Angeles, but his actually presence is predominately abstract outside of some, well, general night stalking and close-ups of clenched leather gloves. Which leads us to... The Misdirection of Richard Ramirez In perhaps the biggest twist West layers into Maxxxine, the killer at large haunting Maxine isn't Richard Ramirez at all, but the preacher heavily featured on Pearl and Howard's TV screen in X—also revealed at the end of X to be her dear old dad. While it could be argued this is a bit of a stretch, I personally love this choice as a to...\n\nIt is April 1st, also known as April Fools' Day, and this makes me think of how much cinema and films sometimes trick us into believing certain events actually happened, especially when some films are \"based on true events.\" This expression is indeed catchy and allows spectators to trust the film on screen. However, this might not be the case in certain movies. One example that comes to mind is the film \"The Revenant\" by Alejandro Iñárritu, as it was part of my doctoral research. For those who may not be familiar with the film, it follows the story of Hugh Glass, who is attacked by a bear and left for dead by his group. He survives and embarks on a journey through the wilderness to find the men who betrayed him. In the storyline of the film, a character named Fitzgerald kills Glass's son to silence him and persuade others to leave Glass behind. However, based on research, this idea isn't true because there's no proof that Glass had a son, let alone one killed by his companions. The film is a masterpiece, in my opinion, but not all the events depicted in it are true. The dramatization of the story of the real person did indeed captivate the audience. This reflection highlights how cinema, like real life, can deceive us with tales of truth. Despite its cinematic brilliance, \"The Revenant\" reminds us of the fine line between fact and fiction in storytelling. (In the picture, to the left is Leonardo DiCaprio playing Hugh Glass, and to the right is the real Hugh Glass himself.)"
