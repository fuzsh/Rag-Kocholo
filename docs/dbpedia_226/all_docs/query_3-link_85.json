        "text": "Preface\n\nUnder the patronage of the University of Florence and organized with the support of the Department of Industrial Engineering, Florence Heri-Tech gathered researchers and experts in the field of \"heritage science and related technologies\" to disseminate their recent research at an international level as well as to draw new inspiration.\n\nThe Conference was part of the Florence International Biennal for Art and Restoration, an international event attracting prestigious institutions and companies and creating a unique opportunity to bring together the academic world with industry.\n\nWe applied a new methodology, namely the motion magnification (MM), to the dynamic identification of historic constructions. MM acts like a microscope amplifying small motions in video sequences, therefore tiny motion patterns are made visible with the naked eye. This technique provides advantages of particular interest to the dynamic identification: no wires, no physical contact, simplicity and low costs. In this paper, we investigated the ambient vibration monitoring of historic structures in urban environments, which is a relevant issue for the health surveying and early damage detection, particularly for ancient buildings. We give an introduction to the MM methodology and describe its practical application to the frequency domain through two case-studies: the so-called Temple of Minerva Medica of Rome and the Ponte delle Torri of Spoleto. Since in the outdoor environment the MM is much more prone to noise because of the wind, shadows, atmospheric refraction, light reflection, distance from the object, weak vibration sources, the case study of the Ponte delle Torri represents a hard test-bed for MM. However, the MM estimates of the first modes showed a good agreement with the experimental data of contact velocimeters.\n\nHistoric tapestries are very important and complex artworks. Their heterogeneous structure composed with different materials is weaved in warp and weft threads with the objective of render an image to be displayed. Often on open display these objects are exposed to forces caused by their own weight as well as by the strain experience due to moisture adsorption and desorption cycles when temperature and relative humidity of the surrounding environment fluctuate. Since physical damage is usually supported by conservation stitching techniques there is a need to understand how certain decisions would influence future mechanical behaviour of a tapestry. This requires the need of establishing a methodology that helps to understand how different sections of these heterogeneous objects respond when forces are applied to them.\n\nPast research considered tensile testing of primarily new woven aged sections which are not representative of the historic tapestries [1]. Digital image correlation (DIC) was also successfully used in order to characterize the strain states of woven tapestries [2]. However, information on how wool and silk behaves as well as the influence of damage and stitching in some areas is still scarce and there is the lack of a methodology for a full strain analysis.\n\nIn this research, tensile mechanical behaviour is being studied in order to inform on how different fragments of historic tapestries behave when a certain tensile force is applied on them. For this, a new methodology of analysis is proposed. Force strain curves collected from tensile tests are analysed together with complementary DIC data to understand the strain states that were present in different stages of the mechanical tests. Results proved that a holistic methodology, using both techniques required for successful interpretation of data. Furthermore, this experimental work demonstrated that tapestry areas behave differently when a tensile force is applied.\n\nThe dynamic identification by ambient vibration data is widely used to supply information on the global health of structures through the investigation of changes in their modal parameters. It can be used even for verification of the state of damage of structures after hazardous threats, for example seismic activity. Therefore, it can play a crucial role to integrate and support conservation strategies for historic architectural assets. Sometimes, in historic constructions only a limited number of positions are accessible or usable to install sensors, and so modal analysis must be based on data from few measurement points. Moreover, they might not be the optimal positions for the studied structure, so the obtained results would need further verification. In such circumstances, the mutual validation between different modal analysis techniques can be useful to assess the reliability of results. In the present paper a case study of application to the so-called Temple of Minerva Medica, Rome, is described. Ambient vibration data were acquired in four rowing acquisition sessions carried out from July 2016 to July 2017, which is a timespan usable to assess the impact of the recent Central Italy seismic sequence. For problems related to the installation of the scaffolding only few points were available for instruments positioning. A variety of techniques were applied, including FRF, FDD, EFDD, SSI, HVSR and complex modal models. The variance of the modal parameters obtained by each different technique was utilized to provide indications on the reliability of the average values.\n\nFinite Elements Analysis (FEA) is widely used for modelling stress behaviour in any mechanical system. The processing workflow starts from CAD 3D models representing the ideal shape of the object to be simulated. Such models are typically made of mathematical elements defining its geometrical components. Those are pre-processed before the simulation for creating a volumetric mesh out of the CAD model. Recently the use of FEA has also been extended to the simulation of ancient structures and artefacts, revealing significant potentialities for the conservation of Cultural Heritage. Unlike modern mechanical systems, heritage objects are usually altered by the time passed since their original creation, and the representation with a schematic CAD model may introduce an excessive level of approximation leading to wrong simulation results. In the last two decades, 3D documentation of CH has been developed through reality-based approaches. However, the related mesh models of the exterior surfaces are not proper for direct use in FEA. Such high-resolution surface meshes has to be converted to volumetric meshes made of tetrahedral or hexahedral elementary volumes and a limited number of external and internal nodes. The focus of this paper is on a new method aiming at generating the best possible 3D solid representation of a real artefact from its accurate reality-based surface model by reducing its number of nodes of several orders of magnitude while maintaining a geometrical coherence in the order of the measurement uncertainty of the 3D capturing technique used. The approach proposed is based on wise use of retopology procedures and a transformation of this retopologized model to a mathematical one made by NURBS surfaces, suitable for being processed by a volumetric mesh generator typically embedded in any standard FEM package. The resulting volumetric mesh allows obtaining FEA of ancient structures, providing a far better accurate simulation than those attainable by a rough CAD redrawing of the heritage asset of interest.\n\nThe main purpose of this research was to estimate the seismic response of the historical masonry arch viaduct located in Krakow (Southern Poland) subjected to the representative strong seismic event. For the numerical evaluation a 3D finite element model (FEM) of the masonry viaduct was assembling with the ABAQUS/Standard software program. To represent nonlinear behaviour of the masonry structural elements of the viaduct under the strong seismic event, a Barcelona Model (BM) was assumed as a constitutive material model. Three components of the registered strong seismic shock were applied as kinematic excitation acting in three directions. The results of the numerical simulation showed that evident nonlinear behaviour of the masonry structural elements of the viaduct was observed under the earthquake. The plastic strains as well as the tensile damage (cracking) were obtained in some zones of the walls of the structure after seismic shock. On the basis of the obtained results authors also discussed the methodology for structural health monitoring (SHM) as well as seismic retrofitting which could be dedicated for historical masonry arch viaducts and bridges.\n\nMany literature studies demonstrated that technologies belonging to cognitive neuroscience can be used in museums. Physics, optics, thermodynamics and neurosciences applications can provide an important support to applied and practical research for lighting our Cultural Heritage. In our research we provided a multidisciplinary integrated approach for the study of the luminous climate inside a historical building: Villa La Quiete in Florence is the case study. The quantitative measurements of the relationship between observer and artworks were performed, with eye-tracking technique application. The Information Theory, read on a thermodynamic basis, the ergonomy of the multi-perceptive learning and optical physics, were the fundamental tools for the assessment of the correct light sources in terms of spectral emission and colour light temperature. The eye-tracking technique combined with the results of lighting parameter quantification, allowed checking how the colour of light changes the observer's perception, and from the information theory point of view, the communication and interpretation process of the signals due to different lighting. At the same time, it was also possible to measure by assessing the perceptive data of the visual path, and thus the neg-entropy, the informative content of the interaction of light with works of art.\n\nIn museums, artworks preservation is hampered by several factors, in particular temperature and relative humidity as inappropriate values of these parameters can cause biological, mechanical, and chemical degradation. Thus, HVAC systems must be able to maintain specific suitable indoor microclimate also in critical conditions, such as variation of external climate and huge presence of visitors. In this paper, we first present the results of a monitoring campaign conducted in some rooms of an Italian museum in the 2015-2016 winter exhibition. The current HVAC system was able to maintain the required microclimate. A dynamic model (using TRNSYS for the envelope modeling and an in-house developed tool for the HVAC system) has been validated through the measured data. The dynamic model allows performing additional simulations characterized by critical boundary conditions (e.g., low external temperature and/or high relative humidity, and high number of visitors). In current conditions, these conditions would have caused unacceptable microclimate in the exhibition rooms, meaning higher risks for artworks. Through a rational rearrangement of the current HVAC system (both generators and terminal units), the microclimate was found to be suitable also in critical situations. This outcome is particularly important in exhibition rooms with temporarily borrowed artworks, since climatic conditions are basically unpredictable for the season of exhibition and so a robust HVAC system is needed.\n\nInterior thermal insulation systems are an integral part of retrofitting works, especially when historical buildings are taken into account. In this paper, three different insulation materials (mineral wool, calcium silicate, and sheep wool) were investigated in order to assess their suitability for the application in historical buildings. First, the basic physical, hygric and thermal properties of those materials were measured in laboratory conditions and then a series of computational simulations was carried out. Finally, based on the simulation results, the hygrothermal response was analyzed and several conclusions were drawn. The presented results proved all materials suitable for application in interior thermal insulation systems but some differences in the hygrothermal response of individual materials were observed.\n\nThe paper addresses the issue of virtual museums' space personalization. Personalization techniques are poorly integrated in virtual museums implementations and when applied little attention is given in the abilities, requirements and needs of their visitors. In this paper, the concept of adaptive exhibition topologies is introduced. Adaptive exhibition topologies are patterns of space structure that are specifically designed in order to provide unlimited exhibition space for personalized exhibitions based on users' interests and visiting preferences. Adaptive exhibition topologies focus on the time that visitors are willing to spend for their visit. In contrast to conventional implementations, adaptive exhibition topologies instances are created according to their visitors' interests and their available time while taking into consideration certain curatorial guidelines. A number of topologies is introduced as well as appropriate metrics for their study and comparison reasons. The effect of different exhibition topologies on users' navigation and interaction with the exhibits is studied through the conducted usability and evaluation tests.\n\nModern life is changing ever more complex and technologically. The technology is utilized in many ways in the life of humans, and even in many of them, human is used as supportive devices inside and outside of the human body. The greatest change in our lives is that human beings can produce more humanoid robots that can learn, plan, reasoning, problem solve, comment, feel, have intelligence. Because of this situation, many things will change in this life which is designed according to human beings. Cultural heritage and art will have an important place in these subjects. Nowadays, there is still discuss on the issues and limitations of cultural heritage and art subjects. Humanoid robots will add problems that await many solutions. When humanoid robots become so productive and become acceptable in society, there is no doubt that many complicated ethical issues will arise. These issues should be determined, discussed and solutions should be given as detailed as possible. The biggest problem of human being is that the solutions will not only be observed by human rights, but also the humanoid robots' rights to be taken into consideration at this time.\n\nAncient bronze statues mainly require material integrity assessment and restoration. Restoration may include also the update of the museum exhibition, defining new structural frames and fragment re-composition to preserve the statue and improve the interpretation of the original aspect. This paper proves how engineering methods (such as Finite Element Analysis, Computer Aided Design modelling, Reverse Engineering) may assist cultural heritage experts and restorers in these tasks. It presents the activities made together with the Museo Nazionale Romano and the Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione e il Restauro, on the so-called \"Principe Ellenistico\" (Hellenistic Prince). This bronze was found in pieces (body, left arm and right leg), at the end of 19th century during an excavation made in Rome. No visual or reference sources can say its origin and its final posture was defined by restorers at the end of the 19th century according to their hypothesis and studies. In the 20th century, a further restoration was made on the critical areas of the surface, together with some structural improvement of the inner frame. Nowadays, after a review of its position inside the Museum, new experimental and numerical analyses have been carried out to better understand surface weakness and correct left arm positioning.\n\nThis paper describes a methodology for efficient massive 3D digitization of ancient sculptures under the scope of IU-Uffizi project. The project is sponsored by Indiana University (USA) with the technical support of Politecnico di Milano and the advice of a scientific committee of experts in the fields of art history and archaeology. The project aims at digitizing 1250 ancient sculptures in the \"Uffizi museum\", Pitti Palace\", \"Boboli Gardens\" and a storage facility inside Villa Corsini in Castello near Florence. The authors have experienced a variety of different issues in the museum, including working with different lighting conditions, the placements of sculptures at difficult places for shooting images, inaccessible height and different ways for posing camera on the scene in an environment where the use of drones is prohibited. To solve such issues, specific technical choices were needed to reduce the digitization time and costs while maintaining a high coherence between the physical artefact and its digital counterpart. These technical solutions are being discussed, in a context where the purpose is to massively digitize complex objects in their original setting by minimizing the impact on the museum. Furthermore, several methodologies are being discussed to improve the efficiency of digitization regarding image capturing, 3D model creation, scaling and mesh editing.\n\nThe Bronze Age crossbar wheel found in the XIX century in Mercurago (Italy) is an amazing example of the technical innovations stimulated by the diffusion of horse draught war chariots in Europe across the third and second millennium b.C. In this paper the tools of modern engineering were used to study the structural issues concerning the wheel and the chariot it should be attached to. In particular, the laser-scanner technology and finite element analysis were used for investigating the dimensional, shape and assembly issues of the wheel, as well as for assessing its structural integrity under operating conditions. The role of the inserted nave, which could be similar to modern bushings, was particularly emphasised, as it is a very innovative solution for that time. The performance of a war chariot equipped by this wheel was studied by means of a vehicle dynamics simulation software, hypothesizing two different chariot structures on the basis of Armenian and Egyptian evidences respectively. The former is probably more similar to the chariot to whom the Mercurago wheel was attached; the latter is technically much more advanced. The results of the analysis allowed obtaining important information about the chariot stability, reliability and structural integrity.\n\nThe manual drafting of lithics artefacts could be a very time-consuming work, and it could be cumbersome on the archaeological site. In this case, a 3D digital model of the object could be very useful. Nowadays, several digitizing technologies are available to easily acquire information about the shape of an object. Virtual models could be used to create a digital museum or to share information between researchers. On the other hand, the manual drafting of a lithic object contains information about the technologies used to realize it. Information about the core setup, types of chipping surfaces, detach sequence of supports, and much more. In this work a method to easily obtain a hand-made-like draft of lithic artefacts is proposed. The method is based on the 3D acquisition of the object with a structured-light based scanner and a sequence of digital processing of the acquired data.\n\nThis paper proposes the integration of photogrammetric reconstruction, 3D modelling and augmented reality application in order to achieve the complete visualization of a stone sculpture even if highly damaged or fragmentary. The first part of the research aims to the reconstruction of the original aspect of an incomplete sculpture, by using photogrammetry techniques based on standard resolution photos and free software in order to obtain a first model; then, we integrate this model with other 3D digital data (from other sculptures of the same period) or with 3D modelling based on historical sources and views from historians, aiming to achieve the original aspect of the sculpture. The second part of the research consists of the embedding of the obtained model in a custom application able to render in real-time the 3D reconstruction of the lion. Then, the rendering is overlaid to the video stream of the real scene and, as a result, a complete 3D digital model of the sculpture is achieved and could be visualized through a VR viewer. As a case study, we focus on a Roman stone sculpture of a male lion conserved in the Museo Estense of Modena (Italy), which lacks of its head and its four legs. The original aspect of the lion may be achieved by integrating the damaged sculpture with other photogrammetric reconstructions of lions sculptures of the same period and with 3D model based on historical sources. Finally, the lion is visualized through an augmented reality application which digitally overlays the reconstructed models on the original one.\n\nIn our study, we proposed a prototype of \"Piazza dei Miracoli\" (Pisa, Italy) as an intelligent 3D interface system aimed at improving the accessibility and usability of cultural sites for all, including people with vision impairment. We combine tactile information with audio tracks in order to enable potential users to explore the artifact autonomously. Low-cost and partially open-source technologies are two important features leading our approach, creating a system easily replicable. First, we designed some 3D source-based models to be printed with an additive manufacturing technology. Next, the 3D prototype has been linked to a Raspberry for handling a set of detailed audio tracks to enrich the tactile exploration with an interactive audio guide. A preliminary evaluation was conducted to test the proposed system in order to better refine its design.\n\nThe work describes a cost-effective methodology for the creation of 3D virtual models with both metric and photo-realistic content developed for archaeologists who need to rapidly map new findings during their field prospections. The potential of modern photogrammetry approach, based on Structure from Motion (SfM) and dense image matching algorithms, coupled with the use of low-cost cameras is evaluated for the creation of 3D models and orthophotos of rock paintings. The case study is located in Brealito valley, in the Calchaqui basin of the Province of Salta, Argentina. In these wide areas, actually known for the naturalistic value, a huge amount of archeological remains was found and surveyed for the first time in August 2013 within a research project funded by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A methodological approach to record the findings in a cost-effective and reliable way is defined, acquisitions are performed with common use instruments such as digital cameras (off-the-shelf and single lens reflex - SLR) and measuring tapes. The novelty of the work lies in defining, experiencing and transferring to operators a simple methodology for digitizing and mapping the archeological heritage in order to provide 2D orthophotos and 3D models. Such methodology allows anyone, archaeologists or unprofessional personnel, to be trained and easily perform a survey in order to document, survey and study the investigated site.\n\nThis paper focuses on new models to enjoy music that will be implementable in a near future thanks to 5G technology. In the last two decades, our research mainly focused on the comprehensive description of music information, where multiple aspects are integrated to provide the user with an advanced multi-layer environment to experience music content. In recent times, the advancements in network technologies allowed a web implementation of this approach through W3C-compliant languages. The last obstacle to the use of personal devices is currently posed by the characteristics of mobile networks, concerning bandwidth, reliability, and the density of devices in an area. Designed to meet the requirements of future technological challenges, such as the Internet of Things and self-driving vehicles, the advent of 5G networks will solve these problems, thus paving the way also for new music-oriented applications. The possibilities described in this work range from bringing archive materials and music cultural heritage to a new life to the implementation of immersive environments for live-show remote experience.\n\nThe Italian handicraft tradition in the construction of bowed string instruments is a very important element of the Italian cultural heritage, that has nothing to envy to other well-known traditions, such as painting and sculpture. The preservation of a handicraft musical instrument is fully incorporated in the preservation of the artworks of Italian heritage. In order to ensure suitable preservation, the systematic studies for the determination of the technical and acoustic characteristics of handicraft musical instruments are of particular interest. This study deals with the characterization of the bowed string instruments, with a particular attention to their acoustic behaviour. The idea of conducting such a research arises from the need to describe a systematic process aimed at the characterization of handicraft instruments and to collect in a single survey a description of different pieces from the Italian lutherie.\n\nThe University of Florence has equipped one of the most representative Florentine historical Museum, \"La Specola\", of a specific microclimatic monitoring system installed in some rooms. The paper presents the results of one-year record of temperature and relative humidity, regarding a room and its showcases. The elaboration and analysis of the microclimatic data have been carried out according to the Italian Standard UNI 10829 and the Performance Index of the most important thermo-hygrometric parameters has been calculated and assessed. Moreover, a dynamic thermal simulation to assess the effectiveness of some passive refurbishment strategies has been carried out in terms of annual and monthly Performance Index and dry bulb temperature variations. The results can be extended to several historical buildings, where poor envelope performances and large windows or skylights imply not acceptable indoor environmental conditions that can even cause damage to the artefacts.\n\nRecently, in the field of preventive conservation, the use of accurate whole-building dynamic simulation models is becoming an effective approach for preventing degradation phenomena due to changes in indoor historic climate. Among microclimate parameters, the moisture plays a key role in the degradation of organic-hygroscopic artworks as well as in the durability of building components. Some simulation codes combine both heat and moisture transfer calculations, however their capability to accurately model the moisture transport is limited. The HMWall model coupled with IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (IDA ICE) software is one of those models.\n\nThis study aims at comparing the performance of the HMWall model with respect to WUFI Plus, developed by Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics (IBP). Temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) provided by both codes in the case of a building envelope with no infiltration, windows and incoming solar radiation, are compared. This allows to assess whether both models calculate the moisture transport throughout walls in the same way. Dynamic simulations have been run over a year by using different T-RH outdoor conditions. Even if both models are based on the same heat and moisture transport equations, RH behaviour simulated by HMWall is significantly different from that by WUFI Plus. This mainly depends on the calculation of saturated vapour pressure (psat) inside the material. Then, the Common Exercise 3 has been applied to test if HMWall were capable to affect indoor RH when cladding materials with different sorption behaviour are used.\n\nThe new HMWall implemented model is resulted more effective than the previous one, and in the case of simplified building, RHs modelled by both programs are highly correlated.\n\nWe describe the design and realization of a novel multispectral light dome system and the associated software control and calibration tools used to process the acquired data, in a specialized pipeline geared towards the analysis of shape and appearance properties of cultural heritage items. The current prototype dome, built using easily available electronic and lighting components, can illuminate a target of size 20cm x 20cm from 52 directions uniformly distributed in a hemisphere. From each illumination direction, 3 LED lights cover the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as long ultraviolet and near infrared. A dedicated control system implemented on Arduino boards connected to a controlling PC fully manages all lighting and a camera to support automated acquisition. The controlling software also allows real-time adjustment of the LED settings, and provides a live-view of the to-be-captured scene. We approach per-pixel light calibration by placing dedicated targets in the focal plane: four black reflective spheres for back-tracing the position of the LED lamps and a planar full-frame white paper to correct for the non-uniformity of radiance. Once the light calibration is safeguarded, the multispectral acquisition of an artwork can be completed in a matter of minutes, resulting in a spot-wise appearance profile, that stores at pixel level the per-frequency intensity value together with the light direction vector. By performing calibrated acquisition of multispectral Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI), with our analysis system it is possible to recover surface normals, to characterize matte and specular behavior of materials, and to explore different surface layers thanks to UV-VIS-IR LED light separation. To demonstrate the system features we present the outcomes of the on-site capture of metallic artwork at the National Archaeological Museum of Cagliari, Sardinia.\n\nIn this contribution a new methodology of climate control, specifically designed for Cultural Heritage artifacts storage microenvironments, is presented. Standard conditioning systems work using the subtraction of vapor in the air by means of condensation on cold surfaces as a drying strategy and the addition of water vapor, obtained in different ways, to humidify the air. Temperature (T) and Relative Humidity (RH) are controlled by two different control loops.\n\nUsing this new system, currently in patent pending status, it is possible to obtain a wide range of T and RH values circulating the air flow (via a common air circulation pump) through a water gurgling device and a heating device, using the ΔT between the water temperature in the gurgling device and the set temperature of the heating section.\n\nThe system is very robust and straightforward: the sensible-latent transformation of the air flow in each one of the 4 possible directions (heating-drying, heating-humidification, cooling-drying, cooling-humidification) is obtained by two passages operated by only two devices (bubbler device + heating device) controlled by two temperature probes, one in the bubbler and one in the heating section.\n\nThe system has been successfully implemented in some different case-studies in Italy and in the United States.\n\nOver the last century, housing has been one of the major concerns of government intervention in the Netherlands. Especially after World War II, housing supply for a fast growing population came in the first place. Natural demographic growth, immigration from the former colonies and from the Mediterranean called for a response in the production of dwellings - for the major part in the public sector. In the 21th Century there has been an effective shift in policy. Nowadays, financial engagement of Government in Housing is reduced, which does not mean that all problems have been resolved. Present challenges for the Dutch historic cities are: the effects of climate change and increasing vacancy of properties which could be used for housing. Recently, various methods have been developed and implemented to diagnose and monitor the situation in these fields. The results of these analyses are applied in operational policies for Urban Renewal. This review of policies and instruments is structured in two sections, each of which focused on the diagnostics and monitoring of foundation problems and the vacancy of old buildings:\n\n- The period since the 1970s, in which Urban Renewal shifted from physical interventions (mainly demolition and substitution) towards reuse and changes of use;\n\n- The upcoming decades, until a planning horizon of 2050, when consequences of climate change (raising water level, draught) and the growing vacancy of utility buildings have to be tackled.\n\nThis paper highlights the importance of monitoring as a preparation for public interventions in historic cities over time [1].1\n\nHistoric sites are threatened by diverse weather patterns, mainly due to global climate change, such as sea-level rise and increasing frequency of storms and other extreme precipitation events. As climate change is becoming an increasing urban problem, heritage located in this context is considered as a sensitive and vulnerable element of the city. Adaptation should be oriented to a sustainable transformation of the historic city, leading to more resilient and safe environments. Risk-based approaches should incorporate an assessment of sensitiveness and capacity to adapt to these hazards. Vulnerability is often assessed on a large scale (e.g. regional, local) and buildings are not considered as part of the urban environment, while conservation is often developed on the operational scale of a monument or site. Management of cultural heritage requires therefore for an urban approach, which considers all the elements and buildings as part of the urban environment. Research presented in this paper describes a methodological approach (MIVES - Integrated Value Model for Sustainability Assessment) for vulnerability assessment of historic sites, supported by multilevel indicators (urban, building, element), in order to provide an informed decision-making. The solution proposed in based on an organised and structures decision tree, which provides a comparable and unique vulnerability index on the building level.\n\n3D printing technologies have been definitively introduced in conservation treatments. Despite the advantage of not requiring direct contact with the artwork, allowing the preservation of fragile objects, the printed item is located in direct contact with the object and the characterization of the filament used for the printing is not often taken into consideration. The following study was undertaken as an evaluation of filaments possibly employed for conservation treatments. The characterisation of the components was carried out through infrared spectroscopy, thermal and chromatographic analyses. Moreover, it was investigated whether such materials release volatile organic compounds (VOC) during their degradation process. Indeed, all of them released styrenic and alkyl compounds, all solvents for materials that can be found on artworks, employed by both, artist and conservator.\n\nRestoration and maintenance of cultural heritage concrete and reinforced objects always require accounting for the torsional stress in the elements, as well as the tensile, compressive and shearing stress. It should be considered, that torsion always develops in the elements of spatial structures, including cross-ribbed systems, bridges and overlaps, elements of shells and domes, stairs, etc. This paper briefly systematizes substantive results of the last studies of an urgent problem of torsional stiffness of reinforced concrete elements, including theoretical investigations, experimental studies and numerical research. Stress redistribution in the statically indeterminate reinforced concrete structures' elements depends on both torsional and bending stiffness. However, while bending stiffness is considered in the design practice, the torsional stiffness is not aknowledged by engineers, nor used in building standards and software packages. This paper aims to substantiate the necessity of considering the torsional stiffness of reinforced concrete elements in design practice. This article is the result of numerous investigations conducted in the scientific school of professor Taliat Azizov. They certify that reduction of the torsional stiffness must be considered along with the bending stiffness in different stages of behaviour of concrete structures. Moreover, the research conducted for this paper proved that a change in the shear modulus of concrete also affects the deflected mode of structures and should be accounted for as the component of torsional stiffness. In order to provide engineers with specialized design techniques, they have been developed for the calculation of torsional stiffness of reinforced concrete elements with normal cracks of rectangular, triangular, t-sections, box-sections, and other cross-sections. The engineering bilinear shear stress-strain curve for concrete has also been proposed on the basis of experimental studies.\n\nA focused re-analysis of knitted items in museum storage suggests a range of new approaches to researching the cultural biographies of objects and writing new chapters for them. The Knitting in Early Modern Europe (KEME) project examined more than 100 knitted caps held in European and North American museums. The project aims to bring a new scientific approach to the under-researched history of knitting as a textile craft and technology and to provide a protocol through which knitted objects which have been silent for too long can tell their stories. New chapters in these knitted objects' biographies are also being written using innovative research methodologies. Scientific analyses more usually applied to archaeological material (such as scanning electron microscopy) have revealed the sophistication of the raw materials required to make them. Attempts at reconstruction using methodologies drawn from experimental archaeology have provided clear evidence of the complexity of the processes required to turn fleece into aspirational faux fur or mock velvet. A range of audiences was invited to engage with the knitted caps as investigators in a Citizen Science project and as commentators on the evidence via an interactive online database. A tribe has gathered around the material and has an ongoing dialogue with it. Social media have created the opportunity for the knitted caps to continue their lives into the future as dynamic cultural objects as new and different people engage with them reconstruct them and reinterpret them for their own purposes. The KEME project has generated the possibility for mute objects lying in the dark drawers of museum storage to have multiple vibrant new lives among diverse tribes well beyond their geographical and traditional cultural communities. This paper explores how cultural biographies can be set free to change and grow without the need for physical examination or public presentation of the objects.\n\nThe development and the prospect of future cultural heritage should certainly be confronted with the development of new technologies applied to the arts which, from a legal point of view, implies mainly three important aspects.\n\n1. Copyrights for software: this seems to be the least interesting for the jurists as many aspects have already been addressed and solved, and therefore on will just quickly list some of them. In fact the copyright explicitely protects the software as work of wit and consequently it is clear that the author is the dominus of his creation in the sense that he is the only person who can decide how to allow other people use his software. So f.e. the relationship between the copyright legislation and open source is actually less difficult than it maybe thought. In addition open source use is fully regulated by Law no. 633/1941 (so called \"legge sul diritto d'autore\") which guarantees its proper use.\n\n2. Legal issues related to the so-called BIM technology: Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a software for plannig and implementing building projects based on 3D modeling of buildings or structures models. The BIM has already been adopted internationally for the realization of major project and one of the most exciting challenges for a lawyer is to develop a specific BIM contract for the particular field of art and cultural heritage.\n\n3. Legal issues related to artificial intelligence: this certainly represents a field yet to be discovered by jurists and here I will present a series of legal concerns that will engage jurists in the coming years. Such as responsibility and ethics of artificial intelligence. For the above-mentioned considerations, the European Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee approved a report calling on the European Commission to introduce a set of regulations on robotics.\n\nDa Vinci's masterpiece can be understand in a totally new way by digitally exploring the painting and examining details that have been lost for centuries. A Virtual Reality set is able to bring us back like a \"time machine\" to interactively explore the Last supper room as never seen before. The research, the work and the exposition is actually on show in Leonardo3 Museum, Piazza Scala Milan. (www.leonardo3.net)\n\nToday, The Last Supper is faded and cracked. Thus, these brilliant, saturated colors may appear shocking, but this reconstruction is the closest representation of how the fresco must have looked like when Leonardo painted it, with all the missing parts reconstructed. It is a sort of virtual archaeological reconstruction. The high-definition pictures allowed us to localize the original pigments, \"Pixel by pixel, we cloned da Vinci's original pigments, using virtual palette to restore areas where the color is irreparably lost.\n\nIn order to complete the fresco's missing parts we turned to contemporary copies of The Last Supper, such as the one by Giampietrino and others.\n\nThe reconstruction has indeed revealed some unknown details, such as an ideal city sketched in fragments to the left of Jesus' face, and a salt shaker that appears to have been knocked over by Judas. Multimedia software, and virtual reality has been realized to spread, history, science and heritage in the \"edutainment\" way, we believe is the future of knowledge.\n\nThe work will show the complete digital restoration of the entire arts, including parts that have never been seen before, and an interactive simulation will make everyone \"paint\" step by step the masterpiece. Virtual Reality as a time machine tool, to explore and understand history and heritage.\n\nThis contribution highlights the potential contribution that modern technologies offer for virtual reconstruction and immersive navigation of monuments that are unavailable due to catastrophic events or other causes. We propose a design and implementation methodology for the enjoyment of the Cultural Heritage sites through three-dimensional and photorealistic modeling, visualization and rendering in a immersive virtual world enriched with extra content. The project of virtual reconstruction of monuments damaged by catastrophic events arises from the need to continue to enjoy the architectural asset during the stages of safety-laying, reconstruction and finishing, large-scale interventions that usually take a long time, especially for buildings belonging to the Cultural Heritage. The experience of the earthquake in L'Aquila of 2009 has reflected on the importance of Heritage and collective identity that changes whenever a cultural asset is not used anymore. Santa Maria Paganica in Virtual Reality Project implements a freely navigable virtual model able to let discover and rediscover one of the monuments of L'Aquila, damaged by the 2009 earthquake, which during the past had a most important role for the social, economic and cultural life of L'Aquila people, and that stays still today, 2018, not reconstructed. Here we present the results and the methodology of the process which allowed us to get a model available in a immersive virtual reality environment. The chosen VR engine is the Unity software, which allows to implements models compatible with the two most common adopted VR headsets: HTC VIVE and OCULUS RIFT. The final VR artifact is an executable software like a videogame, playable on a PC; virtual lighting systems have been projected in order to get a better graphic performance avoiding to alter the mesh model, and the navigation system in VR has been implemented with specific C# scripts.\n\nPreventive archaeology aims at assessing the archaeological interest of a given area, as well as discovering, interpreting, documenting, and protecting archaeological remains that might otherwise be destroyed by land development works. On request of private stakeholders or institutional bodies, archaeologists intervene on a given construction yard (of infrastructure or urbanisation works) in order to investigate the possible archaeological significance of zones subjected to excavation works. In many cases archaeological assays are carried out, which are associated with thorough stratigraphic documentations and definition of the final preservation conditions. The latter can involve suitable re-burying or musealization of some of the archaeological remains recovered. During these activities, the construction works are slowed down or completely interrupted up until the conclusion of the mentioned archaeological research, which can generate possible delays with respect to the planned time schedule and increase of the costs. Improvements are needed in order to minimise the duration of the archaeological assessment and, simultaneously, to guarantee quality standards even higher than tose stated by the competent superintendences. Within this framework, the project ARCHEO 3.0 \"Integration of Key Enabling Technologies for rising the efficiency and quality of preventive archaeological excavations\" (co-funded by Tuscany Region, POR-CReO 2014-2020) aims at speeding up the archaeological excavation and at improving its documentation. It foresees the development of a set of characterisation tools, their integration and validation in archaeological yards. Thanks to ICT solution such a multidisciplinary integration will be made possible by a dedicated web-based platform that will allow to manage 2D and 3D photogrammetry along with the data provided by electromagnetic, and acoustic sensors. The project aim at promoting a substantial step ahead of the preventive archaeology in order to overcome the traditional empiric approach. In this respect, data exchange and the ICT solutions for direct collection of information on archaeological evidences represent the major challenge. Here, we preliminarily focus on the general features of management protocols of the archaeometrical data, as well as on their suitable integration within the operative phases of the archaeological excavation.\n\nThe ever increasing availability of digital data from the Arts and cultural heritage calls for efficient methods to organise, categorise, and retrieve such information in an effective and reliable way. In this context, painting classification has attracted significant research interest in recent years. In this work we address the problem of style classification, which involves determining the school, period and art movement to which a painting belongs. Notably, this job is peculiarly different from other machine vision applications – such as material, object and scene recognition – since the concept of 'similarity' is much more difficult to define in this case. For this specific task we evaluate, in this study, the effectiveness of an array of hand-designed visual descriptors against a set of feature extractors based on last-generation convolutional neural networks. We also investigate the effect of pre-processing methods such as image split and pyramidal decomposition. The experiments are based on the open-access Pandora dataset. The results show that pre-trained models can significantly outperform hand-designed descriptors with overall accuracy surpassing 67%. This represents an improvement on the state-of-the-art by ≈12 percentage points.\n\nThe present paper deals with aspects of information communication and interaction in virtual museums. The information communication methods deployed in virtual museums partially take advantage of virtual environments' capabilities while interaction with the exhibits and the exhibition space remains a challenging task for non experienced users. A demonstrative virtual museum is implemented, in which: (i) interactive information communication methods based on conventional information communication methods; and (ii) interaction and navigation assistance methods are developed, tested and proposed. The proposed navigation assistance method is examined further by the conduction of a set of user tests designed to evaluate its effectiveness and test results show its positive effect. In conclusion, guidelines for future work regarding the effectiveness of the interactive information communication methods, especially as the virtual reality technologies and natural interaction interfaces emerge, are drawn.\n\nIn the last years, several museums and exhibits have adopted new kinds of interactive installations that present artworks in more attractive ways, especially for young visitors. At the same time, new communication technologies have been introduced to allow vision and motion impaired people to visit arts centers. In this work, we present the multi-sensory solutions we have implemented for the \"Battle of Pavia\" Exhibition, a collateral event of Milan Expo 2015. The installation combined different interaction methods to achieve two main goals: providing visitors with engaging experiences and allowing blind and partially sighted people to appreciate the exposed artworks. The used technologies include gesture communication, gaze-based interaction, 3D character reconstruction, virtual avatars, and 3D tactile images. This work can be also viewed in the context of digital humanities for cultural heritage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exhibit to gather such a high number of interactive technologies in a single installation. The positive response from visitors is a great spur to continue our research in this direction.\n\nWithin the European policies and strategies for a sustainable development, the role of cultural heritage as an economic, environmental and social driver has become increasingly significant. As an asset in people's lives, it's necessary to assure anyone the opportunity to access it, regardless of the physical abilities or cultural background of a person. In this sense, ICT could represent an important instrument in enhancing the level of inclusion in cultural heritage sites. This paper develops the discussion around interactive maps as a feasible solution to ensure a fully inclusive experience of a cultural heritage site. Thanks to the analysis of similar existing instruments, this operative tool has been conceived to perform two fundamental functions. First, provide an information system thanks to which everyone, particularly users with special needs, could be able to organize their movements and be aware of the proposed services (that also could be new ICT, like Virtual and Augmented Reality, implemented directly in the map) and opportunities to access cultural heritage. Second, offer a tool for the management of the projects related to the development of inclusion, therefore it is addressed to municipal administrators and other key actors involved in the governance of cultural heritage.\n\nIn INCEPTION, a European collaborative research project, a Heritage BIM (H-BIM) ontology is being developed to store all relevant semantic data concerning cultural heritage objects. Similar to other projects dealing with storing semantics, one of the major questions is whether, and if yes, how should geometry be stored using semantic web technology. The INCEPTION cross-disciplinary research consortium chose to allow the storage of all relevant geometric information using semantic web technology. The alternative is to store geometry in a different way, or storing only the aggregated parts of geometry, for example through bounding box representations.\n\nThe geometry is originally generated by a CAD/BIM system and, as we are dealing with Cultural Heritage, in many cases it is derived from 3D point clouds. These result in a large amount of 3D data to be stored using semantic web technology. A well-known issue is that the performance of databases and inferencing engines for semantic web data drops considerably when the data grows to very large sizes. This paper explains how the performance issues on these large sets of geometric data can be solved while still being able to use the databases, inferencing engines, and the geometric data effectively.\n\nThe most time-honoured tool for understanding the processes of the human past is represented by archaeological excavation. By examining an area at discrete temporal periods, archaeologists are literally able to look backwards in time: they can analyse incomplete material records in order to understand and reconstruct the cultural history of an area at particular moments in time. Since the digging process destroys the site forever, great care must be paid during both the excavation and the documentation. In general, after a stratum has been completely excavated, both the floors and walls are cleaned and made ready for documentation. Photos of both the sides and bedrock of a given excavation are collected, and several sketches of what the archaeologists have seen in the trenches are made. In these drawings are delineated the features and shapes of artefacts on the horizontal plane. In addition, depending on the colours and similarities of the textures, drawing are also made of the archaeological layers. This approach is time-consuming, is affected by human ability, and does not make possible a prompt digitization of the results. Within this context, the automatized identification of archaeological stratigraphy during excavation work is welcomed by archaeologists. Here, a k-means unsupervised machine learning algorithm has been used for colour clustering digital images of excavation sites. The algorithm that we have developed attempts to enhance the colour similarity while keeping the colours separate one from another as much as possible. The main idea is that pixels belonging to the same colour cluster are a part of the same layer. Once the layer has been identified, a statistical approach based on Haralick features is used to characterize each strata in terms of texture. Unsupervised machine learning combined with texture analysis could become a good practice in speeding up the documentation work of archaeologists and paving the way towards the creation of an \"automated archaeologist\".\n\nThe ancient city centers often contain traces of monuments almost completely disappeared, whose few remains are hidden by modern buildings. This is the case for many monumental buildings of the Roman period in Italian cities, that have almost disappeared over time being gradually dismantled for the reusing their construction materials, leaving space to a dense urbanization. Knowledge of such monuments is often approximate and based on historical memories of various kinds. In such situations, three-dimensional surveys and digital 3D modelling reconstructions can be of great support for scientific-archaeological research and for providing a scientifically supported image of cultural heritage sites.\n\nThis paper shows the work on the emblematic example of the late Roman Circus of Milan, an impressive monument of about 450x85 meters, built when Mediolanum used to be capital of the Western Roman Empire (286-402 A.D). This fact is nowadays almost unknown to most citizens of Milan. The diachronic reconstruction approach is used in order to show the monument in his current state and in his presumed past aspect. The reconstruction is based on a proper mix of quantitative data originated by 3D surveys at present time, and historical sources like ancient maps, drawings, archaeological reports, archaeological restrictions decrees and old photographs. In this panorama, the georeferenced acquired data of the remains play a key role in order to validate the previous reconstruction of the building and to define some fixed points to hypothesize a reliable reconstruction of the area in different historical periods. The experimental activity is defined by the project Cultural Heritage Through Time - CHT2 (http://cht2-project.eu), funded in the framework of the Joint Programming Initiative on Cultural Heritage (JPI-CH) of the European Commission.\n\nThe analysis of early photographic sources is fundamental for documenting and understanding the evolution of a city so rich in history and art as Florence. Indeed, by the 1860s several photographers used to work in town, and their images (often obtained through stereoscopic set-ups) can help us to reconstruct Florence in 3D as it was by the time of the Italian unification. The first and most delicate part of such reconstruction process is the computation of disparity maps from the historical stereo pairs. This is a very challenging task for fully-automatic computer vision algorithms, since XIX century photographs are affected by several problems—ranging from superficial damages to asynchronous acquisition—that are usually absent in modern images. In this paper we describe a semi-automatic method that, through minimal user input, allows the creation of coherent and realistic 3D maps of florentine scenes.\n\nThe exposure of cultural heritage to the environment has a significant impact on its degradation process and degradation rate. Consequently, managing the indoor air quality is vital to minimize further damage to historical artefacts and works of art. Despite its potential impact, the traditional assessment of the indoor air quality still represents a challenge for most collection guardians. This approach typically relays on the comparison of measured environmental parameters and corresponding acceptable values. However, determining the acceptable values and relative importance of the different environmental parameters turns out to be quite complex since it depends on the material types present in the collection and their preservation state. Furthermore, the significant amount of data generated during the measurements hampers the application of traditional methods of analysis.\n\nConsidering all these, we propose the use of data mining as an alternative method for the indoor air quality assessment in cultural heritage studies. Data mining can provide knowledge from vast volumes of heterogeneous data, through high-speed processing, detection, and analysis. Here we present its application to identify dynamics and patterns affecting the indoor air quality in a realistic case. Using data from a measuring campaign held at a late Gothic church in Belgium, we show that inappropriate periods can be identified without using standards. In addition, different types of periods can be identified by studying the relation between multiple parameters. For that we use the k-means clustering method, interpreting the results with both visual and statistical tools.\n\nRecently, professionals in conservation have recognized the need to reach out to the public, or layperson, to communicate the contents and modalities of their work in order to create a more accessible culture.\n\nAt present, different forms of communication are used, and blogs have been identified as a very powerful tool, especially abroad. Furthermore, blogs offer a great opportunity to attract a broad audience of readers, and to invite commentary along with question and answer.\n\nWith the goal of forwarding shared knowledge across the conservation community and enhancing communication within the field we have created AbC, a conservation blog open to the public. AbC aims to be a web platform written in Italian, Spanish and English, with a multidisciplinary approach to the themes of conservation, restoration, and diagnostic investigation of artworks. It has been conceived as a popular and up-to-date heritage conservation blog that will to bring these themes into the center of public attention through the presentation of restorations with an understandable language and a captivating style through articles, photos, videos and other illustrations. The platform provides a section to inform readers on restoration and conservation works especially through the perspective of the work in progress which includes interviews and contributions by conservation professionals and a training section for keeping restorers technically up-to-date - beyond teaching to the common public on topics related to restoration, diagnostic and conservation of heritage.\n\nIn order to be one of the principal web platforms dedicated to conservation, restoration and diagnostic world of cultural heritage, AbC Blog takes advantage of collaboration with one of the most important magazines in conservation, Kermes. On the home of web-site of Kermes, AbC will be linked by a banner for an immediate and favourite connection. The blog themes will be complementary to web-site contents, proposing to have future links to other magazine web journals.\n\n\"Social stories\" are used in educational interventions for subjects with Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD) to help them gain an accurate understanding of social situations, develop autonomy and learn appropriate behavior. Traditionally, a social story is a short narrative that uses paper sheets, animations, or videos to describe a social situation of everyday life, e.g., \"going to school\", \"visiting a museum\", \"shopping at the supermarket\". In our research, we exploit Wearable Immersive Virtual Reality (WIVR) technology to create a novel form of social story called Wearable Immersive Social Story (WISS). The paper describes the idea of transforming paper-based social stories, written for the project \"Museo per tutti\" (Museum for All), into WISS to better support persons with NDD in visiting museums and thus increasing their accessibility.\n\nIn this paper a mixed reality application is introduced; this application runs on Microsoft Hololens and has been designed to provide information on a city scale. The application was developed to provide information about historical buildings, thus supporting cultural outdoor tourism. The huge amount of multimedia data stored in the archives of the Italian public broadcaster RAI, is used to enrich the user experience.\n\nA remote application of image and video analysis receives an image flow by the user and identifies known objects framed in the images. The user can select the object (monument/building/artwork) for which augmented contents have to be displayed (video, text audio); the user can interact with these contents by a set of defined gestures. Moreover, if the object of interest is detected and tracked by the mixed reality application, also 3D contents can be overlapped and aligned with the real world.\n\nThe paper offers analysis of digitized copy of the first printed school book to teach Romanian language for Bulgarians published in Bolgrad, Romania in 1865. The related study uses a digital copy of the book which was recently available on-line as a part of the initiative of the Central Library of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences for digitizing old and rare printed books of its large collections. the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences for digitizing old and rare printed books of its large collections. The overview of the approach used for the digitization and the teaching methodology with related approaches are presented by analyzing the book's content including its bilingual Romanian-Bulgarian thematic dictionary. The book can be considered also as the first comparative grammar of Romanian and Bulgarian language, since it contains grammar and lexical examples of related parallel bilingual linguistic phenomena. The analysis, focused on the interpretation of both grammar and lexical phenomena of both languages given in the book is presented together with the related pedagogical implementations.\n\nA large number of cultural heritage archives are freely available on the web: they can be in Linked Open data format, or in any other format, such as databases, collections or archives, with some information for each object. To be really enjoyed and enjoyable by the users on the web, a set of scored keywords need to be associated with each item, manually or automatically. The overall problem here addressed is the automatic, unsupervised extraction of keywords/keyphrases from the items of cultural heritage archives, in different languages (English and Italian). The problem is very actual and in literature many papers are devoted to this topic and several approaches have been defined: we present here a work-in-progress, an experimentation done with the aim of automatically associating scored keywords/keyphrases to a painting archive. We have therefore tested five different methods present in literature, such as tf-idf, RAKE, TextRank, ..., on two datasets, in English and in Italian, and evaluated the results - using recall and precision@n as the evaluation metrics.\n\nThe importance of Vesuvian archaeological sites goes back to the moment of their discovery in the eighteenth century, which since then has promoted a new perception of the antiquity that led to a systematic and scientific study of the cities. The continuity of the excavation work, as well as the interest which they have raised for more than three centuries, makes it possible to trace the evolution of the different initiatives through which technology has been exhibited to the service of archaeology. With the advent of digital technology, new means of study, diffusion, tutelage and accessibility are emerging which will certainly adopt this unique heritage as a subject of study. This paper analyses the different initiatives that have advocated the application of technologies that aspire to improve the visitor experience and to generate a greater understanding of the archeological sites and their global relevance. It therefore highlights the activities carried out in the last decade, both in situ involving the MAV (Museo Archeologico virtuale, Ercolano. 2008), The Grande Progetto Pompei (from 2011), as well as those carried out at the international level, such as the exhibition Carlos III y la Difusión de la Antigüedad (Naples, Madrid, Mexico, 2016-2017). The limitless possibilities that technology and interdisciplinary collaboration offer to Heritage, as well as a critical, estimable analysis for future proposals, will also be highlighted.\n\nThe Internet of Things (Iot) field has been expanding in various domains with cultural heritage being no exception. Nevertheless, cultural heritage sites are still often managed in traditional ways and a prominent gap remains between tour managers and visitors in correctly identifying visitors interest to specific sites and monuments. Previous related works focused on tackling mood detection separately from particular touristic locations which lead to overly generalized assumptions. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive platform named CHEOPS to enhance the touristic experience by detecting the tourists interest in the sites. The proposed platform provides a customized tour through touristic sites by using indoor localization techniques coupled with information about smartphone activity. Accordingly, the visitor is directed to a more interesting location. In addition to interest detection, CHEOPS implements several techniques for interaction with the touristic site such as gaze detection, gesture recognition, and augmented reality. A prototype of the proposed platform is implemented and tested in real scenarios to detect the usability of the system. The output accurately detects the interest of the users, which can then be used to fill the gap between the site manages and the tourists.\n\nThis paper traces how the design of a new media cultural heritage project was inspired by the transformative qualities found in many specimens of Islamic calligraphy. As certain scholars have pointed out, Islamic art is filled with examples of letters and words that appear to transform into things other than text. Indeed, such transformative qualities can be seen across the Islamic world and on a diverse range of artefacts, including the epigraphs on the walls of the Alhambra palace and the religious texts on Ottoman Turkish scrolls written in ghubār (which literary means \"dust\" in Arabic) script. In this paper, the author outlines two broad types of transformative qualities that can be distinguished in many specimens of Islamic calligraphic art, namely, the metamorphosis of the form and the transformation of the function of the letters and words. The paper then demonstrates how, inspired by such transformative qualities, the designers of a cultural heritage project created a calligraphic installation for museums and galleries in which letters are transformed from text to image and vice versa. Using a projection mapping system, words are transformed into images devoid of any semantic meaning, and then revert back into readable text again. Finally, the paper investigates how the transformation of the function of calligraphy renders readability a transitory process in this artwork, and how the technique used in the creation of this artwork can be applied to cultural heritage sites as an educational and entertainment tool.\n\nLab4Dive project aims to design, develop, and validate an innovative, marketable and competitive product for supporting underwater archaeologists in surveying, documenting and preserving the underwater cultural heritage. These activities could be improved considerably with the introduction of new technological devices and tools, helping underwater archaeologists to collect data from the marine environment. The project will provide a solution by equipping divers with portable, low cost and relatively small sized data-gathering systems (i.e. environmental sensors, acoustic localization system, HD cameras, etc.), so they can significantly improve both the amount of data collected in a single mission and the management of time and human resources at disposal. In this paper, the preliminary developments and the tests of the Lab4Dive system will be presented, which is mainly based on two modules: Cloud Server Module and the Underwater Module. The latter is based on two systems: an underwater tablet, that supports the diver during the immersion providing an augmented navigation interface that guides the diver along the selected targets; and a Docking Station, to acquire and exchange data coming from different environmental sensors, a high-resolution camera and an acoustic localization system, physically connected to it.\n\nThe recent conclusion of a challenging project on surveying and monitoring the conservation status of the archaeological site of Pompeii was an opportunity to build a database of information about the city buried by the Vesuvius eruption in 79 A.D. The use of the most modern detection technologies (laser scanners, drones, etc.) has allowed to reach such degrees of accuracy as to open new perspectives of research on urban history.\n\nThe survey, in fact, has returned in detail for the first time the compositional geometries and the weaving of the blocks of the ancient roadmap of the site. In this perspective it seems interesting to systematise the new data and those from the archaeological excavations, also recent, on one of the most fascinating themes of the history of Pompeii: the forma urbis of the city, the chronology of the roads and the great work of monumentalisation consisting in their realization in stone blocks.\n\nTherefore, on the basis of the study on the streets of Pompeii from a usage continuity perspective in the two phases of their life (the ancient, pre-eruption, and the modern, post-excavation), the research project that is illustrated aims to increase the levels of knowledge of the site, through the analysis of the techniques and the constituent materials, the definition of the relative chronology about the realization of the various stretches, the assessment of the conservation status. This also in order to identify appropriate management tools and appropriate strategies for the protection of such assets.\n\nThe project, for its implementation, will use: study of the construction typologies, surveys aimed to acquire knowledge of the constituent materials, observation of the stratigraphic relations between the different road sections, pre-eruption and post-excavation historical analysis.\n\nThe data that emerge will be integrated with excavation surveys, aimed at verifying chronologies and stratigraphic layers; they will be complemented by the results of the excavation of the alley between the Insulae 2 and 3 of the Regio V of Pompeii, to be executed, to return an undisturbed sample for study, both from the point of view of the geometries and of the techniques and the constituent materials.\n\nEnvironmental parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, visible light, UV radiation and pollution influence the deterioration rate of heritage items. To judge on the environmental appropriateness for heritage conservation, it is therefore important to monitor the environment. Often, an incomplete set of environmental parameters is measured, or sporadic or time-averaged measurements are performed. As a result, a wide range of undesirable situations and hazards remain unnoticed. This might lead to an underestimation of environmental dangers (i.e., inaccurate judgement) or to inappropriate mitigation measures (i.e., inaccurate decision making).\n\nWe present an innovative and user-friendly monitoring device that simultaneously and continuously measures (1) environmental parameters and (2) material behavior. An extended combination of off-the-shelf sensors for temperature, relative humidity, air speed, CO2, NO2, O3 and particulate matter are connected to a multipurpose datalogger. In-house developed sensors for the shrinkage and expansion behavior of wood, as well as sensors for metal corrosion rates are connected to the same datalogger. Such extended monitoring shows the identification of a wider range of undesirable situations, and it facilitates the search for correlations between such situations and the sources that cause them, i.e., the hazards.\n\nEarthquakes represent huge risks for cultural heritage. Although there is a large literature about prevention on historical buildings, the seismic assessment on collections and exhibition designs is usually underestimated. \"RESIMUS\" long running project involves different knowledge and fields; its goal is to prevent seismic damages to museum collections and artefacts, combining both museographical solutions and anti-seismic methods. This contribution focuses on the \"Fontana di Giunone\", designed in 1555 by Bartolomeo Ammannati and currently kept at the Museo Nazionale del Bargello. The museographical and historical researches have been combined with the seismic performance of the reconstructed Fountain. In this paper the first results provided by the seismic analysis of this artefact are shown. A 3D structural model has been set, based on the three dimensional digital model provided by an detailed laser scanner survey. An elastic dynamic analysis has been performed, by representing the seismic input through an ensemble of seven ground motions expressing the seismic hazard of the area. The analysis has provided the seismic response of the sculptures, evidencing its sensitivity to the dynamic properties of the considered ground motions.\n\nFeatures of Old Master paintings hidden under the upper layer of a painting are often studied using NIR reflectograms; however their interpretability can be reduced due to the visible content. In our previous work [3] we described the possibility of increasing the visibility of concealed features in NIR reflectograms from the painting surface. The method output, enhanced NIR reflectogram, is produced by extrapolating the VIS data to a NIR range reflectogram and subtracting it from the acquired data in the NIR spectral subband. As a result, separated information from the NIR domain is obtiained. This method has a severe limitation, because it requires precise image registration of the VIS and NIR spectral bands. This is often hard to achieve, because DSLR cameras or multiple devices with various optical systems are used for data collection, and the mutual spatial relation of the images is often unknown. Thus, in the original form, the algorithm was applicable only for data acquired using special scanners producing spatially registered images (as in [4]). In this work, we present an extension of the previous algorithm inspired by deep learning. The new concept allows processing of images only partially registered with pixel precision; subpixel accuracy is no longer needed. We suggest an extension of neural network input with neighboring pixels and allocation of extra ANN layers for translation compensation. The results are demonstrated on misregistered images captured by DSLR camera in VIS and NIR.\n\nThe protection of silver artifacts with a coating of organic material isolating the surface from oxygen and S-bearing gases is still one of the most used techniques for the preservation of silver surfaces. A variety of materials suitable to this purpose are being used in the conservation practice. Among them there are acrylic polymers, nitrocellulose lacquer, microcrystalline wax and combination of them in superimposing layers. They are applied either by brush or, in some cases, by spraying. The first stage in a conservation project is often the cleaning of residuals of old protectives, aimed at making the silver surface free from remnants of yellowish materials and enabling the application of new coatings. Unfortunately, removing aged coatings and applying new ones are \"blind\" processes, since the techniques available for not invasively monitoring the surface of silver artifacts are punctual and do not allow an overall overview of the surface. This is the case of reflectance FTIR and thickness measurement with the Eddy Current technique, which, apart from being punctual, are tricky to apply to uneven surfaces. In this paper, we aim to show the benefits of using an imaging technique, UV induced VIS luminescence, for monitoring the presence and the distribution of protective coatings on silver surfaces and of combining it with reflectance FTIR and thickness gauge. At first, our study was focused on specimens treated with nitrocellulose, acrylic emulsion and microcrystalline wax. The application of the treatments was studied with UV-induced VIS luminescence as well as with the abovementioned punctual techniques to cross-validate the outcome of each method and to assess their suitability for application on organic protective layers on silver artifacts. In a further stage, UV induced VIS luminescence was applied to a real case, a silver chalice that was treated with nitrocellulose lacquer after cleaning.\n\nReflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) has already been used for about twenty years in the field of Conservation and Restoration of Cultural Heritage for non-invasive condition assessment and documentation. However, its potential can be expanded. This paper will discuss the benefits of applying this readily available and low-tech technique to evaluate and monitor conservation treatments. Since the RTI software calculates the exact angle of the light for each RTI image taken, lighting conditions can be reproduced, leading to a standardisation of oblique light imaging. As a result, images produced before and after a conservation treatment can be compared. This allows for an objective evaluation of the treatment carried out and enables monitoring the condition of the painting over time.\n\nThe study of pigments is of fundamental importance for authentication and restoration purposes of painted artworks. To this aim reflectance spectroscopy has been widely studied on samples and in a number of real cases. A number of valuable efforts have been dedicated to this quest; however, the identification of a pigment on a painting surface by means of reflectance spectroscopy appears to be possible only in very few cases also due to the fact that artist materials are often mixed. In this paper we review a number of relevant works and present results on a new set of test samples especially produced for exploring the possibilities of reflectance spectroscopy on pigment mixtures. We also include a case study of a real painting.\n\nWall paintings are complex, heterogeneous structures open to the environment and composed of multiple layers. Additionally, they are frequently located in remote areas, where basic infrastructure is not available. The causes and mechanisms involved in the complex deterioration phenomena, which wall paintings are often subjected to, are therefore difficult to identify and address. Developments have been made to target conservation issues in situ with non-invasive and portable investigative techniques, however standard practice to investigate stratigraphic information still involves analysing samples in a laboratory setting. In remote sites this approach is inefficient, as in many cases decisions on treatment cannot wait for the results of the laboratory examinations. This may have serious consequences on the integrity of the painting. This paper describes adaptation of classical methods for the in-situ preparation of cross-sections, thin-sections and dispersions utilising custom-made equipment. The methodology allows for a direct examination of samples in-situ, using a portable polarizing microscope (field microscopy). The system was adapted and developed to not only capture incident and transmitted light, but also to capture multispectral images (infrared-, ultraviolet-reflected and ultraviolet- and visible-induced luminescence), using external radiation sources. Comparisons with benchtop equipment are made to demonstrate the efficacy and usefulness of the process.\n\nHolographic nondestructive techniques already showed their effectiveness in detecting structural defects on or beneath the surface of historical artifacts, not emerging from conventional visual inspections. Unfortunately, such tools are difficult to be operated out of the stability conditions guaranteed by an optics laboratory. The peculiar features of many works of art, however, make often impracticable their transport to dedicated facilities. In this work, a compact, stable, portable holographic system was designed and implemented: the resulting apparatus allows in-situ acquisitions, even in non-laboratory conditions, and provides rapid and clearly interpretable diagnostic information by the completely non-invasive procedure of speckle pattern photography (SPP). Complementary data are furnished by an integrated infrared thermography system. A map of the artifact surface can be obtained, representing the distribution of defects and their extension. The technique will hopefully help or replace conventional methods, more invasive or less systematic (visual inspections, surface tapping), still largely used for the same purposes.\n\nUV Fluorescence microscopy is a powerful mean for visualizing and identifying structures in a specimen, and it has long been used in many applications, including pigment identification in artworks. Typical painting cross section samples are the result of multiple layers and especially for paintings produced from the thirteen to sixteen centuries, it is possible that for different pigments a different binder has been used, resulting in a complex stratification of materials. In this paper we propose a novel multispectral microscopy imaging system, which is specially designed for cultural heritage application, capable of acquiring both reflectance and fluorescence images in different wavebands, so to be able to document UV fluorescence emission and reflectance spectra.\n\nThis paper presents a research on materials and techniques used in two paintings dating from October 1952, signed by Igor Vasiljev. The aim of the research was to provide important answers from the art history standpoint and explain the existence of two almost identical self-portraits. Standard non-destructive diagnostic methods for painting examination were applied. First, a qualitative analysis of recorded visible reflectance spectra in 350-1100 nm domain was performed, and then its results were regarded along with the information obtained applying imaging techniques such as UV induced fluorescence, VIS-NIR-IR reflectography and radiography. Since the paintings do not have a varnish layer, the UV fluorescence gave especially interesting results, showing difference in used paints. Although the comparative colorimetric spectra indicated the use of same pigments but different mixtures in most points, the infrared reflectography showed very clearly the existence of underdrawing and significant changes in composition (pentimenti) on only one painting. In addition, the details of that painting observed under the great enlargement indicated great spontaneity of paint application. While a visual inspection of these two self-portraits suggested the same author - a very talented and creative Igor Vasiljev, a comparative analysis of the results obtained by spectroscopic and imaging techniques showed that there is a significant difference between them.\n\nAt the reconstruction works on historical buildings, considerable financial means are spent. Therefore, it is desirable to assess the durability of applied materials in the particular conditions of a specific building. This cannot be done effectively without the knowledge of their hygric and thermal properties which can be used as input parameters of computational models. In this paper, hygric and thermal properties of several types of materials which can be used as interior thermal insulation layers in reconstructions of historical buildings on Czech territory, among them calcium silicate, hydrophilic mineral wool, and sheep wool, are investigated. Experimental results show that all analyzed materials can be considered as suitable for interior thermal insulation systems of historical building envelopes, in general. Their hygrothermal performance in specific applications should though be verified using computational simulations, taking into account the complex character of some historical construction systems.\n\nThe San Giovanni Baptistery in Florence (Italy) is an outstanding worldwide monument, representative of Romanesque architecture, dating back at least to the XII century. The whole edifice is externally revetted by white marble of different provenance and, subordinately, of serpentinite, commercially known as \"green marble\". This latter is a rock formed from the transformation of ultramafic rocks during low-grade metamorphism or hydrothermal processes; it has been used for building and ornamental purposes since ancient times. In the San Giovanni Baptistery, in addition to the facade, the \"green marble\" was used on the floor, which consists of white and green tarsias forming an oriental motif. In this work, we studied, through a multi-analytical approach, the green tarsias to compositionally characterise the Baptistery's floor. At the same time, serpentinite samples from different ancient Tuscany quarries were collected and studied to compare their characteristics with those of the \"green marble\" from Baptistery floor.\n\nThe development of nanocomposites combining photocatalytic, antifouling and protective features has provided interesting and promising results in the last years. However, few data about the behaviour of the nanomaterials applied on stone surfaces are available in the literature. In the framework of the EU-Horizon 2020 project \"Nano-Cathedral\", nanostructured protective treatments have been designed with different nanoparticles (TiO2, Ag, ZnO), solvents and silane/siloxane-based polymeric matrices. The innovative formulations have been applied on 6 lithotypes, selected among the stones used in five medieval cathedrals (Vitoria-Gasteiz, Ghent, Cologne, Vienna and Pisa) and a contemporary theatre (Oslo Opera House), which are emblematic of different European geological and environmental areas. The treated stone specimens have been fully characterized to evaluate the surface optical and morphological compatibility, the reduction of water absorption by capillarity, the change in wettability and water vapour permeability properties. The selected treatments fulfil all these requirements and exhibit good photocatalytic and antifouling properties once applied on stone specimens. Different accelerated ageing procedures have also been performed in order to evaluate the stability of the polymeric matrices in the presence of photoactive TiO2.\n\nBiocleaning procedure has been tested successfully on many materials and has proved to be more selective than mechanical and chemical cleaning techniques. Despite its success in treatment, biocleaning is not well-established method for the reduction of salt crystals. Therefore, the innovative approach combines biocleaning with the traditional (poultices) cleaning procedure. It is a new technology for salts reduction, starting from the design of clay poultices and joining their effects with targeted microorganisms. The chosen bacterial cultures increase the desalination capacity of the designed clay poultices, as a consequence of their metabolic activity, providing the mobilization of salts and salt reduction by the advection mechanism. Cleaned with this technology, architectural historic materials are properly prepared for long-term protection with photocatalytic coating based on TiO2 and LDH suitable for fragile heritage materials. This protective material, designed under the FP7 HEROMAT project, has been already proved in laboratory and in-situ to be effective in maintaining aesthetic and functional properties of the mineral substrates and ensuring their long-term resistance to environmental conditions. This promising two-stage treatment presents a method which is both environmental friendly and cost/time effective for the reduction of nitrate salts and continuous self-cleaning protection of the surfaces of historic buildings.\n\nAs part of the ongoing study of Brunelleschi's great dome in Florence, the Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore has approved a proposal to solve the age-old problem of the possible presence of hoops or iron stirrups within the dome's inner wall by exploiting the flux of natural muons traversing the dome. Ascertaining presence of a metal hoop in the dome would obviously be relevant to assess the static and seismic safety of the monument. The project, proposed by Dr. Elena Guardincerri from LANL and by Prof. Carlo Blasi, began in 2016 at LANL with the construction of special prototype-panels for the tracking of muons, and has expanded this year to include researchers from the Department of Physics of the University of Florence and INFN-Florence.\n\nSoiling of external surfaces is an increasing issue for conservation of architectural heritage. Providing architectural surfaces with self-cleaning ability is one of the most promising routes of preventive conservation. To this aim, several methods have been proposed in the literature, based on the use of photocatalytic TiO2 nanoparticles, either directly applied onto the surfaces or incorporated in protective coatings. However, when nano-TiO2 is directly applied onto architectural surfaces, the particles are easily removed by rain. When TiO2 is incorporated in polymeric coatings, durability issues arise as well, because the photoactivity of TiO2 nanoparticles can promote degradation of the polymer. Here, we present an innovative alternative method, based on combination of TiO2 nanoparticles and hydroxyapatite (HAP). The incorporation of nano-TiO2 into an HAP coating protects the nanoparticles from leaching by rain, thanks to the chemical bonding between TiO2 and HAP, without diminishing their photoactivity. As a result, marble treated with HAP-TiO2 composites exhibits high self-cleaning ability and high durability, with results superior to those achieve by direct application of nano-TiO2 onto the surface, as frequently performed on site.\n\nMicroorganisms can colonize any known environment and modify it due to their extremely wide and versatile metabolism. From the microorganisms point of view, cultural heritage (CH) objects represent a series of very heterogeneous habitats (from historical stones to paints or archaeological wood) where they can grow as well as in natural habitats. Aesthetical and/or structural modifications of CH materials due to microbial growth and activities are referred as biodeterioration. In most cases biodeterioration is not due to a single species of microorganisms, but is the results of the activities of a composite microbial community at some stage of its development on the artwork. The knowledge of microbial community composition and its metabolic potential is essential to individuate the microorganisms mainly responsible for deterioration and take the appropriate measures to control their growth. Microbial communities can be investigated by two different methods: culture-dependent (based on the cultivation of microorganisms) and culture-independent (based on the analysis of diagnostic molecules, mainly nucleic acids). Even if culture-dependent methods allow to study the physiology and metabolism of the isolated microorganisms, they provide limited information on the diversity of complex microbial communities since the vast majority of microorganisms (approximately 99% for environmental samples) are not yet culturable. Microbiology applied to Conservation is a relatively young branch of environmental microbiology. For many years methods used to detect microorganisms inhabiting CH objects have been culture-dependent while molecular techniques developed from microbial ecology have been adopting only in recent years. Here we discuss the potential application of innovative metagenomics approaches, to investigate microbial communities on CH. Metagenomics approaches can be divided in targeted and untargeted methods. The targeted methods amplify and sequence marker regions of the ribosomal DNA to obtain a genus level picture of the microorganisms present in different substrates. The untargeted approaches can provide strain level information of the genes and the biochemical functions present in a microbial community. This review emphasizes the importance of applying metagenomics based, culture-independent techniques, in combination with the culture-dependent ones, to assess the biodiversity of microorganisms colonizing CH objects and take proper actions for their conservation.\n\nThe objective of this paper is the presentation of the research strategies adopted and results of the ongoing BIONANOSCULP research project that is aiming to develop solutions in the area of sustainable nanomaterials, which are non-invasive and high-performance in their preventive conservation approach.\n\nAn integrated methodology was designed as a holistic strategy to the characterisation of the microbiota present on the surface of public outdoor sculptures. Gathering objective data in the characterization of the surface microbiota of public outdoor sculptures is important, in order to design strategies for the preventive conservation of these objects that make use of biotechnology innovative coatings. Such is one of the objectives of the project BIONANOSCULP. Methodologies applied include conservation reports, surface sampling methodologies using gels, 3D modeling, SEM, flow cytometry and metagenomics.\n\nThe project is already significantly contributing to create a bridge between the experts from different areas: the skills of biotechnologists, microbiologists, materials scientists, art historians and conservators-restorers to assess the state of conservation, biodeterioration and biocontamination of a selected number of sculptures, and to design the appropriate materials to pursue preventive conservation through coatings with anti-microbial activities.\n\nSoluble salts content and their crystallization play an important role in the deterioration of porous substrates; the common approach to solve this conservative problem is focused on the identification of a proper thickener and application protocol able to reach a good level of desalination. Here we report the results of a systematic study on a late Renaissance plaster aimed at reducing the content of gypsum and sodium nitrates comparing five different type of thickeners. The extractive process has been monitored by Evanescent Field Dielectrometry (EFD) by means of the evaluation of salinity index (SI) and humidity content (HC), whereas the quantification of the salinity level, before and after desalination, has been performed with ionic chromatography (IC). Data coming from the field, have been integrated with laboratory measurements aimed at evaluating the water release trend, according to the micro-structural features and the pore size distribution of both the thickeners and the substrate. This step has the purpose to identify an effective correlation among the characteristics of the desalination systems and the porosity in order to estimate a proper trend of effectiveness, suitable for the procedure of conservators.\n\nPossible applications of plasma technology on wooden surfaces have been investigated by new research projects. There are different initial situation: The residuals of several timber preservatives, based on organo-chlorine compounds, are a high challenge for human protection, storage and wood restoration. Among the most common organo-chlorine substances that have been used as pesticides in the past are Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), Lindane and Pentachlorphenol (PCP). Lindane and PCP are toxic and/or carcinogenic and all are considered to constitute several environmental hazards. The pesticides were widely used for the treatment of trusses in private homes, churches, castles as well as of furniture or wooden artefacts. This creates the necessity to develop efficient and economically viable methods for removing the harmful biocides from the contaminated timbers without damaging the original materials. For the gentle removal of biocide residuals (so-called blooming of mainly DDT crystalline forms) atmospheric pressure plasma was used as a cleaning tool for the first time. For selected working conditions the removal of up to 75% DDT contamination could be achieved on plain timber surfaces.\n\nUsing atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJ) it is also possible to create thin films (~ 50 – 200 nm) with different functionalities such as hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity or antimicrobial properties. To create antimicrobial effects active agents were embedded into silicon dioxide films matrices. Antimicrobial tests showed high effects of these films towards bacteria strains such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. An effect towards mold fungi was low using films containing only one active agent. However, significant improvements in activity were achieved"
