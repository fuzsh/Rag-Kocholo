        "text": "Research\n\nWorking in research\n\nDiscover all the other opportunities of international recruitment at Ca’ Foscari: our University is highly committed in achieving excellence in research, developing international partnerships and funding new talents.\n\nResearch projects\n\nThe Department periodically highlights in this page some of the main ongoing research projects, at a national or international level.\n\nCensorship and communication in modern Age (XVI-XIX Centuries)\n\nResearcher: Marco Cavarzere, Lenght: 24 months (11/12/2025), Grant: € 38.705 (PRIN2022)\n\nThis research aims to investigate models, behaviours and features of violence against women in Rome (VIII century BC–V century AD) through an analysis of the ancient sources, and to identify the historical and cultural superstructures that may have produced or justified the phenomenon of violence against women in Western society from ancient times to present. The female body has been a cultural and symbolic place for the construction of gender identity and relations between sexes, and an entity from which models, norms and behaviours arise. Therefore, this research aims to verify the validity of these premises by looking at the history of Rome which, for Western culture, is the main historical, ideological and symbolic reference from the post-classical age to today. The focus allows us to trace the cultural and anthropological origins of gender asymmetry, to reconstruct long-lasting historical dimensions, to read correctly the cultural superstructures that still persist in today’s Western society.\n\nDizionario dell'italiano accademico: forme e funzioni testuali (DIA)\n\nResearcher: Davide Mastrantonio, Lenght: 24 months (29/11/2025), Grant: € 127.831 (PRIN2022 PNRR)\n\nAcademic Italian can be identified as the set of forms and functions that typically occur in formal texts (handbooks, research articles, etc.) transversally to disciplinary fields. In spite of its relevance, academic Italian is still an understudied variety, unlike e.g. academic English. From this perspective, the DIA project (\"Dizionario dell'italiano accademico: forme e funzioni testuali\") aims to fill a double gap: to start a systematic formal and functional inquiry of the academic variety of Italian based on the analysis of a wide corpus; and to create an open-access digital dictionary that allows the query of academic expressions by forms and functions. The potential recipients of the DIA are first and foremost students and teachers involved in formal writing learning/teaching processes, but the DIA would also be usable by writers outside the school or university settings who are nevertheless increasingly confronted with the need to write clear and fluent formal texts.\n\nReturning Foreign Fighters (ReFF). The Demobilisation of Italian Transnational War Volunteers, 1860s-1970s\n\nResearcher: Elena Bacchin, Lenght: 24 months (29/11/2025), Grant: € 54.650 (PRIN2022 PNRR)\n\nReFF aims to conduct the first comprehensive study of Italian foreign fighters’ return to the peninsula during the period 1860-1970. Despite military mobilization being primarily driven by national conscription and the nation-state during these decades, transnational war mobilization persisted. Focusing on Liberal Italy, the research unit discusses the trajectories, fates, and legacies of Italian foreign fighters who relocated to a state other than their own with the intention of perpetrating, planning, or participating in acts of war, or receiving military training. In particular, it investigates the actions of Italian foreign fighters who returned to their home country during the period 1861-1914 to understand whether they demobilized or chose new forms of political mobilization. It also analyzes the measures taken by Italian and international authorities to monitor, and possibly contain and repress, their actions.\n\nINTEGRATION_INTEllectual miGRATION: circulation of philosophical books and ideas around the ancient Mediterranean through the evidence of Graeco-Roman papyri\n\nResearcher: Holger Marc Essler, Lenght: 24 months (16/10/2025), Grant: € 42.132 (PRIN2022)\n\nINTEGRATION aims at enriching our knowledge of Ancient Greek and Roman philosophical thought through the evidence provided by Greek and Latin papyri. It exploits and fosters the work produced over the last century on philosophical papyri, by joining the efforts of two different leading research groups, promoted respectively by the Corpus dei Papiri Filosofici (CPF) and the Centro Internazionale per lo Studio dei Papiri Ercolanesi (CISPE). By investigating Greek and Latin philosophical papyri which are still unpublished or worthy of an updated study, INTEGRATION aims not only to advance edition and digitization of texts but also to contextualize them in a wider frame and highlight their relationship with other texts. This task will be accomplished through (a) new editions of (published and unpublished) philosophical papyri and their digitization; (b) related studies; (c) a database that will provide texts, translations, metadata, cross-references and dynamic maps, which will help to put in context the single pieces of evidence and shed light on their mutual relationship.\n\nTradition Processing (TRA.PRO). Forms and patterns in the transmission and tradition of the Book of the Dead\n\nResearcher: Emanuele Marcello Ciampini, Lenght: 24 months (27/9/2025), Grant: € 106.672 (PRIN2022)\n\nDespite the rich bibliography and the projects planned on the Book of the Dead, we must stress the lack of studies concerning a historical approach to the corpus: the deconstruction of the chapters in units of sense with the variants due to the historical evolution of the tradition, a complete lexicographical study, a study on the tradition(s), and a historical approach to the language of the corpus. The project intends to deal with the manuscripts in their entirety, making use of a group of sources from the Turin Egyptian Museum (from the Middle Kingdom until the Greco-Roman period), which for the breadth, scripts, typologies and richness of the sources makes it possible to have a representative and optimal sample of the corpus. This approach on sources, text and philological aspects, is a fundamental step towards a more organic profile of the text in all its parts (philological, linguistic, graphic, material). The joint developments of the project will be framed in a wide program of regular integration between the two project units. With the study of the selected sources, we can achieve the following results: - Edition of the manuscripts with the deconstruction of the single chapters in units of sense. - Digital platform for lexicographical and grammatical studies, with a specific historical approach to the language of the corpus. (historical dictionary). This platform is conceived to become a reference tool suitable to further text input thanks to his evolutive nature. Beside the scientific profile of the project, the proposal aims to stress the importance of the results for the approach of a wide audience to the textual tradition: the presence of several Book of the Dead manuscripts in Italian Museums will ensure a fundamental support for the ‘post-project’ creation of a visitor’s path to the Egyptian manuscripts as part of a “public archaeology”.\n\nCorpus of the Medieval and Renaissance Scribes in Italy (ScribIt)\n\nResearcher: Paolo Eleuteri, Lenght: 24 months (27/9/2025), Grant: € 73.609 (PRIN 2022)"
