Messrs. G. Leonard and R. Leonard opened the door with their remarks in your Spring/Summer CCT [\"Sha Na Na and the Woodstock gener¬ ation\"]. I have no regrets about the 1950's (and no nostalgia, either). But then, to say that they are \"still accu¬ rately remembered for the Bomb-fear¬ ing, Commie-hunting, money- grubbing era that they were: the Eighties without the glamor\" is either stupid or disingenuous. On January 1,1950,1 had just turned 21 and was finishing my first semester. The previous May I had been dis¬ charged from the Army after a three- year hitch, which included two years in Germany. I was attending Columbia on the G.I. Bill, which was the reason I enlisted. I was a native New Yorker (City Island, in the Bronx), a commuter, and the first member of my family to go to college. I remember: Fifty-Second Street, Bop City, Bird- land, the Metropole, the Five-Spot, the Glen Island Casino, and the Hickory House. Dizzy Gillespie, Henry \"Red\" Allen, and Louis Armstrong. Lee Konitz, Bud Freeman, and Cannonball Adderley. Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday (in a local Long Island lounge on a Sunday afternoon). Roberts. Lynd, C. Wright Mills, Norman Mailer, and Dissent. Jackie Gleason, Sid Caesar, Imogene Coca, and Leonard Bernstein. The Yankees, Dodgers, and Giants. Satchel Paige and 70,000 people at Yankee Stadium. No Time for Sergeants, Waiting for Godot, and off-Broadway theater. Marlon Brando and Karl Malden in On the Waterfront. Frank Sinatra and Ernest Borgnine in From Here to Eternity. Janis Paige, Chita Rivera, and Gwen Verdon. The New York Post, Murray Kempton, Jimmy Cannon, and Max Lerner. The Investigator, a parody of Joe McCarthy on LP. Lenny Bruce's satires. 'Nuff said. Ernest J. Leupp '53 Hialeah, Fla. Drugs and rock 'n' roll George and Rob Leonard's article about Sha Na Na was delightful. It is fair to say that Sha Na Na was wholly a prod¬ uct of George's demented genius. As for Rob, he was one of the nicest fellows I've ever known. My own one-time membership in Sha Na Na has followed me throughout my academic career. For 20 years now, I've been living down my Warholian moment of \"fame\" (about 50 seconds, actually—the length of my immortal performance of \"At the Hop\" in the Woodstock movie). The last time I saw any of the other members of Sha Na Na was in 1976, when I testified in an acri¬ monious lawsuit that had divided the group into two opposing factions. A correction about my present whereabouts: Since 1986,1 have been Professor of Bible at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. For the record, I never wanted to be a cantor, as your article states. During my undergradu¬ ate years, I made some money by serv¬ ing as a cantor during the Jewish high holidays. What I wanted to be, in fact, was a rabbi, but I thought the better of it and went to Yale for a Ph.D., and now I help to train rabbis instead. There are lots of little details in the article that I remember differently than George and Rob, but that's what memo¬ ries are for. For example, Janis Joplin never saw us play at Steve Paul's Scene, where we played shows at midnight and 2 a.m., mostly for the benefit of Broadway performers who were wind¬ ing down from their exertions; she came to see us at San Francisco's Fill¬ more West, and she was reeking of Southern Comfort. The name Sha Na Na was not George's invention, but came from a crooked agent whom I will not name. The man even threatened to sue us over the name, claiming that it was his property! (Actually, the best thing about the name is that the real lyrics to \"Get a Job\" are either \"sha-da- da\" or \"sha-la-la\"—certainly not \"sha- na-na.\") There should have been some men- Columbia College Today 3 tion of Dave Garrett's father, whom we knew affectionately as \"Fast Eddie\"—a wonderful man and a great friend. He bought our equipment for us, and used his personal connections to get us out of the clutches of the above-mentioned crooked agent and into the good hands of William Morris. And one more thing: The guy who really got us the Wood- stock booking was one of the stars of Hair (his name is lost in the ether), then a big Broadway hit, who schlepped Michael Lang over to see us. This same fellow invited us to participate in the notorious nude scene in Hair (how benign it seems now), and a few of us took him up on it. My favorite Sha Na Na story con¬ cerns Rob Leonard. When we were per¬ forming at Fillmore West, a dazed- looking young woman came up to him and asked him if he had any dope. He didn't (he never did), but he did have a small bottle of aspirin, which he carried constantly because of a chronic bad back. He gave the girl an aspirin to get rid of her. The next night, there she was again, waiting for Rob, and begging him for \"another one of those groovy whites.\" I guess even the 60's drug cul¬ ture seems benign nowadays. Alan Cooper '71 Cincinnati, Ohio Forgotten authors Your correspondent Bill Costanzo '67 says that one of the features that he turns to in CCT is normally the \"Book¬ shelf.\" He enjoys seeing what Colum¬ bia graduates have made of their education and their intellectual lives. Sadly, not all books by Columbia authors have been recorded in \"Book¬ shelf.\" None of my books have. I stopped bothering to send you notices after you ignored the notice I sent you of my first book in 1978. That book was entitled The Impact of American Law on English and Commonwealth Law: A Book of Essays published by West Publishing Co. I decided that if you could not be bothered to publish the notice, I was not going to put myself out sending you notices. The other books I have written are Interim Protection: A Func¬ tional Approach (1981) and Non-Appear¬ ance Before the International Court of Justice: Functional and Comparative Anal¬ ysis (1984). Both of these books are pub¬ lished by Martinus Nijhoff in the Netherlands. The latter book was awarded the Prix Francis Lieber by the Institut de Droit International. My last book, published in 1984 by Oxford University Press (New Zea¬ land), is entitled A Standard for Justice. It is about the fundamental Bill of Rights that the New Zealand Government was proposing at the time. The fundamen¬ tal bill of rights was never passed, but the government has introduced a non¬ fundamental bill of rights, so the book will go into a second edition. I wonder how many other books by Columbia authors were never recorded in \"Bookshelf?\" J.B. Elkind '61 Auckland, New Zealand The pursuit of profit I was outraged and appalled to discover in the Spring/Summer issue that the Alumni Association had chosen to pre¬ sent a John Jay Award for Distin¬ guished Professional Achievement to ... Frank Lorenzo! Lorenzo sets a disgraceful example for employers nationwide with his despicable callousness, cruelty, greed and dishonesty. Insatiable in his desire to expand his empire, he is neverthe¬ less unwilling to extend basic dignity to his employees (let alone the decent eco¬ nomic benefits that likely would aid his business to prosper), and has moved ruthlessly and unstintingly to crush the unions who dare to seek to represent and protect those workers. In 1983, Lorenzo took Continental Airlines into bankruptcy for the pur¬ pose of breaking his labor agreements, and ousting the unions representing Continental employees. Fie has not signed a contract with any union since, and now employs the lowest-paid air¬ line workers in the industry. In turn. Continental's workers suffer from low morale, and the company's reputation for service is deplorable. Far from dem¬ onstrating business acumen, Lorenzo has proven more interested in punish¬ ing workers exercising their organiza¬ tional rights than in making a profit. Hence, he is dismantling and ruining Eastern Airlines rather than bargaining in good faith with employee representatives. How can the College honor such a man with a professional achievement award? By doing so, it endorses, indeed even celebrates, the misconduct of a man whose only \"profession\" is venality, and whose only \"achieve¬ ment\" is debasing the humanity of those who work for him, hence ulti- \"The 1990s will be a decade of solid growth ... in an increasingly interdependent world and the U.S. will continue to Ibe the most influential nation in technology, trade and political leadership. Austin Kiplinger and Knight Kiplinger -America in the Global '90s \"These two respected observers of the American economy weigh in here with a refreshing and persua¬ sive antedote to the doomsayers.\" -Publishers Weekly \"Provocative, even contrarian conclusions.\" -Kirkus Reviews KIPLINGER BOOKS $12.95 at bookstores or send check to: Kiplinger Books, Editors Park, MD 20782-1967 mately corrupting himself as well. Small wonder that the awards cere¬ mony was to be met with massive protests. I have worked over seven years as a lawyer in the labor movement, where I have witnessed and fought against some of the extreme examples of employer mistreatment of workers, Lorenzo's included. That experience encom¬ passes four years battling corporate agri-business' heartless exploitation of farm workers, who are commonly thought of as the most mistreated workers toiling in this country. But I have yet to encounter a single em¬ ployer in any industry more incapable of reconciling human values with eco¬ nomic imperatives than Lorenzo. It is astonishing in any circumstance that the Association would choose to attempt to ennoble a man whose deeds have been so consistently and grossly mean-spirited and barren; to do so at the height of his infamy demonstrates an exquisite Lorenzoesque insen¬ sitivity to boot. The item in CCT says nonchalantly that the Association \"has made no plans\" to rescind Lorenzo's award. Until the Association changes those plans, and does rescind the award, I have no plans to contribute another dime to the College, and I do plan to encourage my fellow alumni to do likewise. IraL. Gottlieb'77 Burbank, Calif. Editor's note: CCT was incorrect in reporting that the John Jay Award is given by the College Alumni Association. The awardees are selected by a committee of alumni leaders; the award itself is presented by the Dean of the College and the Univer¬ sity President. At press time, the 1989 awards—to Professor Wm. Theodore de Bary '41, Nobel physics laureate Melvin Schwartz '58, film director Brian De Palma '62, advertising executive Allen Rosenshine '59, and former American Bar Association president Lawrence E. Walsh '32, in addi¬ tion to Mr. Lorenzo—were scheduled to be given in late spring. CCT welcomes letters from readers. All letters are subject to editing for space and clarity. Please direct letters for publication \"to the editor.\" Appeasement I read with interest both Dean Pollack's letter to graduates (and students) and the discussion in the May issue of Alma Matters with Richard Friedlander. My initial reaction to the cancellation of a major College event, the John Jay Din¬ ner, because of the possibility of picket¬ ing and demonstrations against Frank Lorenzo, is, \"There goes Columbia again!\" I remember very well an incident in the late 1960's in which a previous Col¬ lege dean refused to take any action when the SDS disrupted the annual meeting of the alumni held in conjunc¬ tion with Dean's Day. His Uriah Heep imitation soured me on the school's administration and its ability to act from principle in a way that remains with me to this day. I believe Dean Pollack has set a disas¬ trous precedent for Columbia. I can't help but think that Columbia will be deterred in future from inviting and honoring controversial figures, and that the many anti-something groups will see the school as vulnerable to the type of threat to which he has surren¬ dered. Giving in to the bullies of the world has never led to peace. Dean Pol¬ lack (and his successor) will never be able to \"receive complete assurances that the [event] could be held without incident.\" He has taken the easy way out, and the College will in future pay the price. S.E. Reuter '60 Washington, D.C. Upholding principles Having read the exchange of letters in the May 1989 Alma Matters about Dean Pollack's cancellation of the John Jay Awards dinner at which Frank Lorenzo was to be honored, I have the following comments to offer to my fellow alumni and alumnae. I appreciate that Dean Pollack is sin¬ cerely dedicated to the welfare of the College. Moreover, it is easy to be a Monday morning quarterback when passing judgment on a difficult deci¬ sion such as the one he made. Never¬ theless, one has the eerie sense when reading his apologia that a well-mean¬ ing official of a distinguished German university could as well have written it when describing his actions in response to the potential disruption of a university function caused by Nazi demonstrators who objected to the presence of a particular person. Then, as now, it is sometimes necessary for the university and its community to take major risks to uphold the basic principles for which they exist and to avoid what Dean Pollack concedes is a \"terrible precedent.\" The other thought that occurred to me is the University's (and the press's) relatively muted reaction to the threat to disrupt the dinner because Mr. Lorenzo was to be honored as con¬ trasted to what one can reasonably assume would have been the case had, say, thousands of supporters of Oliver North threatened to do the same thing because of the presence at the dinner of Lawrence Walsh. In such a case, or if the protestors had been members of the Aryan Nation, is it not likely that the entire faculty and administration would have been up in arms and the event described in detail and repeat¬ edly by television anchorpersons? I consider this incident to be another sad example of the failure of great insti¬ tutions of learning and the press to live up to their responsibilities to the larger society. Leonard M. Trosten '53 Bethesda, Md. Editorial fallacy I was appalled at some of the practices and attitudes described in \"Parent, Stayed on Rock Etqjnal\" [Spring/Sum¬ mer 1989]. On the topic of eliminating generic masculine pronouns, Professor Sandra Prior is quoted as saying: \"There is no reasonable argument against avoiding giving offense.\" Yet when it comes to those who might be offended by her dogmatic stance, she is reported to have said: \"Those are peo¬ ple who think blacks shouldn't have equal opportunity.\" By what contorted reasoning is the second quotation sup¬ posed to follow from the first? A person who disagrees about a point of English usage is not automatically a racist. What's worse is that the non sequitur comes not from a college freshman but from the director of the College's Logic and Rhetoric program. The same article quotes Ria Coyne, an instructor in the Logic and Rhetoric program, as saying: \"The generic mas¬ culine is not accepted in this class. I just say it's a rule. It avoids long discussions and arguments... If we accept the generic masculine we accept the impli¬ cations. But if someone can believe (continued) Columbia College Today 5 Within the Family Overshadowed by real events F or a time, it seemed the year 1989 would be dominated by the anni¬ versaries of historical events—the French Revolution, the start of World War II, the Moon Landing— public remembrances which all but blotted out this magazine's own 35th anniver¬ sary gala in November. As I recall, we ourselves marked the occasion with a container of mu shu chicken and a gin¬ ger ale from Ollie's, the new restau¬ rant at 116th and Broadway. As it turned out, the staged news of 1989 was completely overshadowed by real news, especially the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the tyranny it symbolized. Next to this, some of our more local passions—arguments over oat bran muffins, gender-neutral pro¬ nouns, or the secession movement in Staten Island—do begin to appear trivial. B lessedly drowned out by the thunder of change was the debate about—remember this?—the pro¬ posed flag-burning amendment to the Constitution. President Bush's truculence on the subject occasioned a memorable blast from Lewis Lapham, the editor of Harper's Magazine. \"By preferring idolatry to argu¬ ment, Mr. Bush denies the principle, implicit in the First Amendment, that a republic always stands in need of as much disagreement and as many doubts as its citizens have the courage to muster,\" Mr. Lapham wrote. \"Free¬ dom of thought brings societies the unwelcome news that they are in trouble, but because all societies, like all individuals, are almost always in trouble, the news doesn't cause them to perish. They die instead from the fear of thought and from the paralysis that accompanies the silencing of opinions that contradict the official wisdom.\" Fine thoughts for a republic, or, for that matter, a business corporation, religious hierarchy, military com¬ mand or any other organization of high integrity and purpose, including a college or university—or an alumni magazine in the middle of its journey. W e had long assumed, erroneously, that the founding of CCT in 1954 had something to do with the University's own bicenten¬ nial celebrations of the same year. Recent conversations with the maga¬ zine's founding father, Joseph D. Cof¬ fee '41, helped to set us straight. Joe Coffee joined the Columbia staff in 1946 and directed the College's alumni effort through most of the 50's. He was later president of Eisenhower College and a Columbia trustee. Many of the enduring fea¬ tures of College alumni life—Dean's Day, the Alexander Hamilton Dinner, the John Jay Associates, Columbia Col¬ lege Today, the Columbia College Fund itself—originated in his thoughtful leadership. Mr. Coffee persuaded his col¬ leagues that alumni interest and involvement could not be taken for granted and that a College alumni publication would be a smart long¬ term investment. The name Columbia College Today was suggested by the late Robert C. Harron, Columbia's very respected public information director. Putting out the early CCT was fun, but harder work than Mr. Coffee had anticipated. He was assisted by Jerry Miller, an alumni office staffer, for a year or two, and then by editor Ira Silverman '57. \"Ira and I slaved on it together,\" Mr. Coffee recalls. \"I remember working nights until three in the morning in the print shop, sweating out the layout, writing head¬ lines, writing stories—my blood was in it.\" O ne of the small delights of this issue is Associate Editor Thomas Vinciguerra's piece on the Columbia lineage of Eustace Tilley, the top-hat¬ ted symbol of The New Yorker maga¬ zine [page 35]. Tom wrote the piece for us partly as a valentine to that great magazine after it had shown the good taste to publish an article of his con¬ cerning the crumbling Long Island mansion of the late King Zog I of Albania—a typical Vinciguerrian obsession. Columbia College Zoday College Broadens Its Requirements for Degree Jacqueline Dutton, our other Asso¬ ciate Editor, left the staff last August to enter business school at NYU. We already miss her ideas, her range, her leadership, her skilled reporting, her easy rapport with students and her friendly presence. Because of budget pressures felt throughout the College, Ms. Dutton has not been replaced—the magazine has now lost two key people in the last year and has seen its operating budget cut by 26 percent. As reported in the latest issue of Alma Matters, the Alumni Association newsletter we have produced since 1987, Columbia College Today has now joined the Ivy League Advertising Network, which should help on the revenue side. Meanwhile, the University has dou¬ bled the press run of Columbia Maga¬ zine to include all 140,000 University alumni, while cutting its frequency from six to four issues a year. All Col¬ lege alumni should therefore receive seven magazines a year between the two publications. CCT has undergone many changes of fortune and format over its proud 35 years, and we are now contemplat¬ ing serious alterations which should improve our ability to publish regu¬ larly and more often, within our cur¬ rent budget and staff constraints. The leaner product now on the drawing board will not, we hope, be unrecog¬ nizable to our remarkably loyal audience^**- something but they're not allowed to say it, the underlying belief is less legit¬ imated.\" I see that George Orwell's novel 1984, in which words like free were systematically distorted or removed from the language entirely so that people couldn't discuss freedom, has once again become disturbingly prophetic. I also see that this latest member of the thought police demands unquestioning obedience from every¬ one; the dictates of Big Brother are sim¬ ply to be replaced by those of Big Sister. It's easy to demonstrate the fallacy of the belief that eliminating the generic masculine will somehow bring about equality of the sexes. Cebuano and Tag- alog, like the other languages of the Philippines, do not make a he/she dis¬ tinction; neither does Chinese, spoken by one-fifth of the world's people—and yet I hardly think Instructor Coyne would be happy living as a woman in traditionally male-dominated Philip¬ pine or Chinese society. It is clear that ideological wishful thinking has taken precedence over the facts. I am disturbed that a university, which is supposed to promote discus¬ sion and tolerate dissent, has become so authoritarian that students in one of its programs are not allowed to dis¬ agree about how to use their own lan¬ guage. I am sorry that once again a gang of \"true believers\" is forcibly try¬ ing to impose its doctrines on everyone else. I regret that somebody like Prior is permitted to manage a writing pro¬ gram at Columbia. And as for anyone like the dictatorial Coyne—who should take, not teach, a course in logic, but who appears to be teaching a course in newspeak—let him or her keep his or her hands to him- or herself, and off my language. Steven Schwartzman '67 Austin, Texas Offending anthems It was interesting to learn, in passing in \"Parent, Stayed on Rock Eternal,\" that Columbia too has a Germanic anthem. The Yale Alma Mater, \"Bright College Years,\" is to the tune of \"Die Wacht am Rhein.\" (It's the song the Krauts are sing¬ ing in Casablanca when the freedom fighters take up the \"Marseillaise.\") Just after World War II, the Yale Glee Club toured Europe, and found they were getting booed and hissed in France and Holland for singing the old college song. Must have sounded like bilingual Nazism to the audiences. In fact, the tune is early 19th-century, and was bequeathed to Yale by the first leader of the Glee Club, who was one of those German refugees from 1848. Richard Brookhiser New York, N.Y. Caveat lector Applause for gender-neutral writing, but how to keep it elegant? All the solu¬ tions you document are anything but, as you show. I propose the simplest approach of all: Where gender is irrele¬ vant we leave a blank space and the reader can interpose the pronoun wishes. I call this \"participatory reading.\" Norbert Hirschhorn '58 Boston, Mass. Newspeak Perhaps I am a Neanderthal, but I find the subject of \"gender-neutral\" lan¬ guage largely an exaltation of form over substance. What really caught my eye was the quote attributed, if I follow the pronouns accurately, to instructor Ria Coyne: \"But if someone can believe something but they're not allowed to say it, the underlying belief is less legit¬ imated.\" Think about that statement. If it is not familiar, it should be: It is the basis for every totalitarian government that has ever existed, and that has ever been imagined. Whether it is called \"thought control\" or \"mind control\" or \"revolutionary thinking,\" it represents the very antithesis of the Columbia College education and environment. I thought, at least when I was a stu¬ dent at Columbia, that the idea was to change minds and persuade by \"the arts of reasoned argument, dispassion, open-mindedness and tolerance that all totalitarian regimes, of whatever religion or ideology, ruthlessly crush as soon as they take power,\" in the very eloquent words of Dean Robert E. Pol¬ lack only two pages later in the same issue of CCT. I am astonished that any faculty member at Columbia could so express the notion of deliberately de- legitimating beliefs by prohibiting their expression. Perhaps instructor Coyne would be more comfortable teaching at the Uni¬ versity of Beijing, or at North Korea State. As far as I am concerned, the attitude she expresses has no place at Columbia. Edward C. Steinberg '64 White Plains, N.Y. Consciousness-raising I am writing in response to your article concerning usage of nonsexist English, which is becoming mandatory in cer¬ tain limited areas of our university. It took me some time, but as soon as I ascertained the article's topic, my mind immediately jumped to the suspicion that my former Logic and Rhetoric teacher would be mentioned some¬ where therein. And sure enough, she was. Ria Coyne's mandate of nonsexist usage was met with considerable resis¬ tance by my class, the women, strangely, joining the sexist pigs you'd only expect to be opposed to it. Actu¬ ally, none of the students, I believe, were sexist, and I think that their reluc¬ tance to comply with Ms. Coyne's instruction has less to do with a sexist ideology than with a simple, lazy, \"Is it really that important?\" type of attitude. But through the course, and later on, I began to become aware of blatant uses of the generic masculine everywhere— even cringing at the sight of it on occa¬ sion. Soon, I was writing business let¬ ters to \"Sir or Madam,\" patting myself on the back for being an egalitarian. Parts of your article confirmed my new view that anyone who uses \"he\" and \"men\" in the generic and claims that \"everybody knows I mean the whole of mankind, the human race,\" is mis¬ taken. I refer specifically to the test some L&R teachers use, where a pas¬ sage full of generic masculines is read, and the class is asked to give the subject a name. Invariably the names are male. I don't see how this can be refuted. Was I indoctrinated? Have I been irreparably corrupted by a militant feminist who infringed on my rights by \"forcing\" me to do things her way? I really don't think so. If what the class did was to make me aware of some¬ thing I did unconsciously, then I can only be better for it. If I then decide that I don't like what I used to do without thinking, and change it, that's my choice, and the choice of every one of Ms. Coyne's students after completing the course. Thank you for a provocative article. Michael Johngren '92 Wien Hall Behavior vs. speech In his moving valedictory, which appeared in your Spring/Summer issue, my classmate Dean Robert E. Pollack declares that at a liberal arts col- Columbia College Today 7 lege, no idea should be unthinkable or unutterable. I hope that your readers noticed the dichotomy between this high sentiment and the antics of some of the College's Logic and Rhetoric instructors, as described in an article by Jessica Raimi, in the same issue. Defending instructors who forbid their students to use the generic \"he,\" program director Sandra Prior explains, \"There is no reasonable argu¬ ment against avoiding giving offense.\" As a longtime teacher and practitioner of First Amendment law, I have always supposed that the free speech clause protects the right to give offense. (Inoffensive speech, after all, seldom stands in need of protection.) And fed¬ eral courts have vindicated this princi¬ ple from Selma to Skokie. In the same vein, instructor Ria Coyne informs her students from the beginning of her course that the generic masculine is unacceptable. She says to your reporter that while we can't change \"attitudes,\" we can at least change \"behavior.\" But student writing is not \"behavior.\" It is speech. Let me suggest an espe¬ cially apposite example of the differ¬ ence between behavior and speech. When Professor Coyne expresses her views about sexism and language, whether in class or out, this is speech. When she uses her authority to force her views upon non-assenting stu¬ dents, this is behavior. If Columbia were a state university, there would be a judicial remedy against such behav¬ ior. Since Columbia is private, the courts are probably powerless to inter¬ vene, but I hope that Columbia's faculty and administrators, and—if need be— its tenure committee, will have the courage to act in their place. Martin B. Margulies '61 University of Bridgeport Bridgeport, Conn. P.S. I note that Ms. Prior dismisses the views of those who oppose nonsexist language by opining that these are people who think blacks shouldn't have equal opportunity. I'm so glad that Ms. Prior teaches Logic. CCT invited replies from Sandra Pierson Prior and Ria M. Coyne. First, Professor Prior: To begin with, I would like to set the record straight in regard to the follow¬ ing passage in Jessica Raimi's article: Cruise the fjords of Norway under the midnight sun. Sail past the mountains of Bergen, the waterfalls of Hellesylt, the island towns of Kristiansund and Svolvear, to the capitals of Oslo and Copenhagen, from June 14 to July 2 aboard the luxury liner Seabourn.

As for those who are offend¬ ed by non-sexist language, \"Those are people who think blacks shouldn't have equal opportunity.\" The first statement I did make, although in the restricted context of writing for¬ mal expository prose, a context in which authors may argue all kinds of opposing positions, but should avoid offensive language. The second statement I never thought, let alone said. I am not sure if Ms. Raimi erred in her understanding as well as in her writing (the phrasing is awkward and ambiguous), but the fact that not all of the statement is in quota¬ tion marks is one clue that something is wrong. I was making an analogy, not an identification, an analogy between, on the one hand, people who not only oppose methods of giving equal em¬ ployment opportunity (such as affir¬ mative action) but the goal itself and, on the other hand, people who object not only to \"she or he\" or some other form of gender-inclusive pronoun but to the very idea that women should be fully included in our language. The analogy may not be apt (though I still think it is), and it apparently was not sufficiently articulated for Ms. Raimi to follow it, but it is not absurd and illogical, as the statement she attrib¬ uted to me most certainly is. Logic and Rhetoric is a course in expository writing that, as the name suggests, concentrates on logic and rhetoric, not on grammar, although it does review some grammatical points. There is a specific syllabus, which all the instructors are required to follow. At first the assignments concentrate, on various logical developments used for structuring essays, such as \"Identifica¬ tion and Description,\" \"Division and Classification,\" and \"Comparison and Contrast.\" Later the syllabus moves on to rhetorical issues, such as \"Metaphor and Analogy,\" \"Tone and Attitude\" and \"Bias and Usage.\" The topics for the assigned papers are specific and de¬ tailed. Students do not have the free¬ dom to write on any topics they choose or to write in idiosyncratic discourse, not because there is something inher¬ ently wrong with their own topics or their own discourse, but because those are not what this course teaches. Both students and instructors must adhere to the prescribed syllabus. Yet, while instructors must cover a topic like \"Bias and Usage,\" how they cover it is up to them. I and others involved in the program make sugges¬ tions about these matters, but we do not prescribe. Furthermore, we do not prescribe what instructors should mark right and wrong. Within the limits of the prescribed syllabus, I like to allow the instructors as much freedom as (continued on page 76) Around the Quads Greenberg ushers in a new era for the College Since taking office as Dean of Columbia College on September 1, Jack Greenberg '45, the renowned civil rights lawyer, has moved with all deliberate speed to coun¬ teract what he calls \"the centrifugal forces of a large college in a larger uni¬ versity in a big city.\" \"The College is in great shape. It is the crown jewel of the University,\" Dean Greenberg declared to alumni at the Alexander Hamilton Dinner in Novem¬ ber, adding modestly, \"My job is just not to get in the way, and to keep it as good as it has been and maybe make it a little bit better.\" The new dean was Professor of Law and Vice Dean of Columbia Law School for five years prior to his appointment. He succeeds Professor of Biological Sci¬ ences Robert E. Pollack '61, the College's dean since 1982, who stepped down last June 30. During the summer. Dean of Students Roger Lehecka '67 was Acting Dean of the College, with Associate Dean of Students Karen Blank serving as Acting Dean of Students, a role she con¬ tinues to play while Dean Lehecka helps guide the transition. Dean Lehecka and Associate College Dean Kathryn Yatrakis have led the way in pursuing Mr. Greenberg's most dra¬ matic proposal for reorganizing student life at Columbia College: the creation of a house or college system along the lines of Princeton, Yale and Harvard. Although the proposal is still under study. College administrators envision new units of perhaps 500 members each, administered by a house master, a chief resident tutor, and a number of senior tutors. Both faculty and deans would be attached to each house, where they would conduct academic and social pro¬ grams. Each house would have a cere¬ monial dining room-library where such events could take place. The new units would embrace existing residential groupings under new names, such as Van Doren House, or Trilling College, and students would normally remain within the same house for most of their College years. The cur¬ rent Hartley-Wallach complex, with about 460 students, is the right size for one such house, Mr. Lehecka notes, as is Schapiro-River, with 500, or John Jay, with 470. Dean Lehecka believes the proposed system offers many advantages for un¬ dergraduate life—a more manageable scale, a greater sense of attachment, and, especially, the further integration of fac¬ ulty into College life. \"Columbia has a reputation of having a distant faculty, more interested in research and gradu¬ ate students than College work and undergraduate instruction,\" Dean Lehecka said. \"I understand that it feels that way to most students, but I don't think most faculty members come here with that inclination. I think they learn it, because that's the way Columbia is structured.\" Creating a house system in the Col¬ lege will be expensive—one estimate calls for five such units at $2 million each, including renovation costs, faculty chairs and program funding. Such a project competes with other needs Dean Green¬ berg has acknowledged, such as main¬ taining competitive faculty salaries and renovating both the student activities building, Ferris Booth Hall, and the main College building, Hamilton Hall. The sorting out of priorities is given urgency by the imminence of a new Uni¬ versity-wide capital campaign, expected to exceed $1 billion. The house system is part of Dean Greenberg's vision of a more cohesive and intimate College community. He has undertaken other initiatives in this regard, for example, urging core curricu¬ lum and senior seminar teachers to in- Columbia College Today 9 A proven coolness under fire I n 1949, a young Navy veteran joined Thurgood Marshall's staff at the NAACP Legal Defense and Edu¬ cational Fund in Manhattan. Jack Greenberg, not yet 25 years old, had been recommended by Columbia law professor Walter Gellhorn, who ad¬ mired his former student's legal craftsmanship and social ideals. Before long, Mr. Greenberg had established himself as a member of the team that successfully litigated the five cases known collectively as Brown v. Board of Education: On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation in public schools violated the 14th amendment of the Constitution. When President Kennedy appoint¬ ed Mr. Marshall to the Federal bench in 1961, Mr. Greenberg succeeded him Above: Nine attorneys from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund gathered on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court during the historic Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954. From left: John Scott, James M. Nabrit, Jr., Spottswood W. Robinson III, Frank D. Reeves, Jack Greenberg, Thurgood Marshall, Louis L. Redding, U. Simp¬ son Tate and George Hayes. as director-counsel of the Legal Defense Fund, and he built it into the largest civil rights law office in the nation. He represented and advised Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., founded the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, and became active in human rights causes internationally. He won honorary doctorates from Morgan State, Lincoln and other universities, including Columbia, where he returned in 1984 as Vice Dean and Professor of Law. In Simple Justice, the monumental study of the Brown decision and American race relations published in 1975, Richard Kluger wrote: \"Those who have worked closely with him over the years in which Greenberg has risen to become per¬ haps the most knowledgeable and successful civil-rights lawyer in America are agreed on several of his qualities: a supple and uncluttered mind, great intellectual energy eagerly exercised and methodically disciplined, the courage to take a position on a complex legal question and the stamina to stick to it, and the manipulative skills to keep a large organization of professionals working with dedication toward a goal beyond their own enshrinement.\" Another quality—coolness under fire—has served Mr. Greenberg well over the years, and may prove useful to him as Dean of the College. He showed it during World War II as a naval officer in the first assault wave to hit the beach at I wo Jima, and on the night in 1952 when white-hooded Klan members menaced him with an all-night torchlight parade around his hotel in Orlando, Florida. It was the same coolness Mr. Greenberg needed as a lawyer arguing 40 cases before the Supreme Court over the years. \"He doesn't get into a flap when the going gets rough,\" Walter Gellhorn observes in Simple Justice, \"and he can stand controversy without develop¬ ing animosity.\" Or, in the apothegm Mr. Greenberg learned from his mentor, Justice Thurgood Marshall, and often re¬ peats: \"Lose your head, lose your case.\" J.C.K. 10 vite students to their homes (and allocating funds from the dean's discre¬ tionary budget to help fund their hospi¬ tality). Mr. Greenberg has also hosted a series of faculty dinners in his Hamilton Hall office. The first one featured his own celebrated gumbo, which Spectator delightedly dubbed \"Dean Cuisine.\" When the Spec reporter entered the dean's inner office— which is deco¬ rated with artworks from Bali, West Africa and Mexico—he inquired about the scary-looking papier-mache skele¬ ton hanging near a window bay. Dean Greenberg deadpanned: \"That's the last Columbia College student who made a racist, sexist or homophobic remark.\" It was another reminder of Dean Greenberg's lifelong commitment to fighting discrimination in its many forms. The College's 12th Dean was born in New York City on December 22,1924 and grew up in the Bensonhurst sec¬ tion of Brooklyn and on Decatur Ave¬ nue in the Bronx. His parents came to theU.S. shortly before World War I, his mother from Rumania, and his father—a certified public accountant described admiringly by Dean Green¬ berg as a \"hard-headed idealist\"—from Poland. The future dean attended DeWitt Clinton High School (at the same time as the revolutionary modern jazz pianist. Bud Powell) and entered Columbia College in 1941. Among his favorite professors were the philoso¬ pher Irwin Edman '16, and Raymond Weaver, in English. Two of Mr. Greenberg's core curricu¬ lum teachers—Sherman Hayden in C.C and Burdette Kinney in Humani¬ ties—also made a deep impression. The dean remains a strong adherent of Columbia's required general education curriculum, and of the current move¬ ment to develop the Extended Core. \"Our answer to objections leveled at the core curriculum is not to dilute it, but to add to it sections dealing with other cultures and contemporary prob¬ lems,\" he says. In 1943, Mr. Greenberg entered the U.S. Navy's V-12 program, which soon led to midshipman's school at Cornell and active duty in the South Pacific. His first assignment was to command a landing ship from Kentucky down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to New Orleans—a Mark Twain-like interlude that contrasted sharply with the car¬ nage he later witnessed at Iwo Jima and Gumbo diplomacy: \"Dean Cuisine\" is part of Jack Greenberg's recipe for a more cohesive College Faculty. Okinawa. Mr. Greenberg entered Columbia Law School after the war, graduating in 1947 as a Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar, and he joined the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund (LDF) in 1949. Soon, he was litigating major civil rights cases, including one that led to the desegregation of the University of Delaware, and then Brown v. Board of Education, which culminated in the his¬ toric 1954 ruling of the Supreme Court [see sidebar, page 9]. After succeeding Thurgood Marshall as director-counsel of the LDF in 1961, Mr. Greenberg led the organization to an impressive string of Supreme Court victories, including Alexander v. Holmes, a landmark school desegregation case in Virginia; Furman v. Georgia, which outlawed capital punishment (on nar¬ row grounds); and Griggs v. Duke Power Co., an employment discrimination case which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of new jobs for minorities, Mr. Greenberg estimates. The LDF also represented hundreds of civil rights protesters and leaders, among them Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. By 1984, when Mr. Greenberg stepped down as director-counsel—he remains a mem¬ ber of the LDF's executive committee— the organization had 25 lawyers and an annual budget of $6 million. It was about 30 years ago that he first met Michael I. Sovern '53, then a Co¬ lumbia law professor researching a book on employment discrimination. Before long, Mr. Sovern was directing lawyers' training institutes for the LDF, and the two men developed a close per¬ sonal and professional relationship. \"Among Jack's many contributions to the advancement of human welfare,\" President Sovern has noted, \"was the fact the he and his wife first introduced me to my wife.\" Joan Sovern's old friend, Deborah Greenberg, also a Columbia Law grad¬ uate, is Clinical Professor of Law at Columbia, working with the AIDS Law Clinic. The Greenbergs havg six grown children, two of whom (Josiah '80 and William Cole '84) are College alumni. Soon after Mr. Greenberg returned to the Law School in 1984, he founded the school's Summer Human Rights In¬ ternship Program, which places up to 70 law students each year in human rights offices around the world. He hopes to encourage similar programs for Columbia College. In 1989, he chaired a University-wide task force on minorities that recom¬ mended a stronger commitment to affirmative action policies in faculty hir¬ ing and other areas. He also founded a program to bring Third World human rights leaders to Columbia as visiting scholars. Dean Greenberg himself is chairman of the Asia Watch Committee and an executive committee member of Human Rights Watch. He has partici¬ pated in human rights missions to Korea, Nepal, the Philippines, Poland, Guyana, and South Africa. \"I would like to affect the direction of the College so that students will be more conscious of the needs of their community and the rest of the world and be more interested in devoting themselves to helping others,\" he said in a recent New York Newsday interview. Mr. Greenberg's published works include Race Relations and American Imw (1959), Judicial Process and Social Change (1976) and numerous articles; he is now working on a history of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educa¬ tional Fund. With former Harvard Law School dean James Vorenberg he has just published The Liberated Man's Guide to Fine Cooking —\"a title which was perhaps more timely when they started it 13 years ago,\" needles Deborah Greenberg. In addition to enjoying his foie gras cookery, an active social life, and the company of his infant granddaughter, Jessica, Dean Greenberg likes to spend Joe Pineiro Columbia College Today 11 • Inquiries: Are Columbia and other Ivy schools \"part of a price-fixing system that OPEC might envy/' as one Wall Street Journal reporter sug¬ gested last May? More than 50 colleges and univer¬ sities are currently involved in a Jus¬ tice Department antitrust investiga¬ tion to determine whether they are illegally setting tuition, financial aid, and salary levels. The probe began last summer when the Justice Department asked certain schools to turn over financial records and other information. Columbia did not initially receive a notice, but as the investigation wid¬ ened, all of the Ivy schools and doz¬ ens of others were asked to furnish records. \"Some documents have al¬ ready been produced and produc¬ tion will continue as expeditiously as possible until completed,\" Eliz¬ abeth Head, Columbia's General Counsel, informed CCT in November. Although the University has not commented officially on the investi¬ gation, a statement issued by Har¬ vard, which is also under investiga¬ tion, noted, \"There are of course some common standards among in¬ stitutions. For example, Ivy League universities base scholarships on need and do not give athletic schol¬ arships. We believe that we are com¬ plying with the law.\" • Civility Committee: \"Race, eth¬ nicity, religion, gender, sexual ori¬ entation—all have occasioned attacks by the ignorant, the foolish, the sick, the evil.... We have not been exempt from these problems at Columbia,\" said President Michael Sovern '53 in his announcement of the formation of a Committee for the Promotion of Mutual Understand¬ ing and Civility. The 15-member committee comprises faculty, administrators and students and is chaired by Provost Jonathan Cole '64. Its charge, in President Sovern's words, is \"to ensure that all our deal¬ ings with each other are marked by decency'and characterized by civil¬ ity,\" and \"to develop sensitivity to the concerns of those among us most vulnerable to discrimination and harassment.\" • Bridging the Two Cultures: In re¬ sponse to concerns about scientific illiteracy, the College faculty voted in November to require a minimum of two years' study of the natural sciences, mathematics or computer science for the bachelor's degree, in¬ stead of the one year currently re¬ quired. The rule will not take effect until a new standing College Sci¬ ence Committee of faculty is satis¬ fied that enough courses for non¬ science majors have been created, a process expected to take a year or two. These were among the measures proposed by a committee chaired by Professor of Chemistry George Flynn. The committee's report in¬ cluded proposals for augmenting the \"vanishingly small\" number of undergraduates majoring in science and enhancing the status of science in the College's general education curriculum. • Bellwether: College tuition for the fiscal year 1990-91 will increase by 5.7 percent, the lowest increase in more than 20 years. Low Library announced on November 17. Tui¬ tion increases are usually stated in the spring, but according to Provost Jonathan Cole '64, the early an¬ nouncement is part of an effort to improve long-range fiscal planning. \"The College in some sense is the bellwether of the school,\" he told the University Senate. \"In terms of tuition patterns, it is the one [divi¬ sion] that people look to, outside of the University, when they think about tuition increases. It is also the single largest source of tuition in the University.\" College tuition for the academic year 1989-90 is $13,686. • Great Teachers: Carol Gluck, the George Sansom Professor of His¬ tory, and Atle Gjelsvik, Professor of Civil Engineering, received the 41st annual Great Teacher Awards at the Society of Columbia Graduates' annual dinner at the Princeton Club on September 21. Professor Gluck, a specialist in modern Japanese intellectual his¬ tory, is the head of the undergradu¬ ate program in East Asian studies and co-director of Columbia's NEH project on Asia in the Core Curricu¬ lum. She won the Mark Van Doren Award in 1982 and the Lionel Trilling Award in 1987. Professor Gjelsvik is well known for his designs for off¬ shore drilling platforms and sub¬ mersible oil rigs. • The Art of Math: The renowned mathematician Samuel Eilenberg, University Professor Emeritus, has endowed a chair in mathematics at Columbia by donating his collection of South Asian art to the Metropoli¬ tan Museum of Art in New York. The collection is valued at more than $5 million; in return, the museum is raising the $1.5 million needed to create the Samuel Eilenberg Visiting Professorship of Mathematics. Pro¬ fessor Eilenberg's collection, amassed over three decades, com¬ prises more than 400 pieces and in¬ cludes the world's finest private holding of Javanese bronzes. Profes¬ sor Eilenberg, who joined the fac¬ ulty in 1947, won the 1986 Wolf Prize in Mathematics for his work in alge¬ braic topology and homological algebra. 12 his off-hours reading historical works, such as Eric Foner's Reconstruction, or magazines—he subscribes to The Econ¬ omist, Far'Eastern Economic Review, Dis¬ sent and Time. He is also an opera and music lover, favoring Bach, Mozart, Mahler and Verdi. Mr. Greenberg has upheld one Col¬ lege tradition, the \"open-door policy,\" perhaps as strictly as any dean since Herbert E. Hawkes, who was near the end of his tenure when Mr. Greenberg entered Columbia. A sign posted in Hamilton lobby invites students in to see the dean any time after 10 a.m., without an appointment, unless he is already busy with a visitor or a phone call. In other matters, he clearly differs from his predecessors. \"We had a bunch of John Jay Scholars come to my house for dinner last week with Allen Ginsberg,\" Dean Greenberg related to alumni at the Hamilton Din¬ ner. \"And he told of the night when Security found him in bed with Jack Kerouac, and he was summoned to the Dean's Office. This was another in a long list of wrongs he had committed, so he was sentenced to a year's suspen¬ sion and charged $2.40 for having an overnight guest. \"Ginsberg asked what I would have done,\" the dean continued. \"I said that I would not have suspended him, but I would have made him pay the $2.40.\" Dean Greenberg can only be pleased by some of the changes he has seen. In October he was invited to speak informally to the Charles Hamilton Houston Pre-Law Society, in Ferris Booth Hall. He began by remembering some of his earliest colleagues in the civil rights cases leading up to Brown v. Board of Education, men and women he called \"the really great heroes of the movement.\" One such man is Louis L. Redding, a Harvard Law School gradu¬ ate who opened his Delaware law prac¬ tice in 1929 and in the 1950's was still the only black lawyer in the state. \"At that time,\" Dean Greenberg explained, \"Delaware was as racially segregated as Mississippi. Even the courtrooms were segregated— blacks on the left, whites on the right.\" Glancing at the faces of 40 Columbia College students, he said, \"As I look around this room, I see virtually as many black pre-law students as there were black lawyers in the entire South in 1949 and 1950, when I began working in this field.\" J.C.K. The University Senate: Advice and dissent At the height of the '68 student upris¬ ing, on the day after The Bust, shocked members of the University's senior fac¬ ulty met in St. Paul's Chapel. Ten of them, including Lionel Trilling, Poly- karp Kusch, Ernest Nagel, Alan Westin, Daniel Bell, and a young law professor named Michael Sovern, formed themselves into an executive committee charged with finding a way for faculty and students to have more say in the governance of their Univer¬ sity so that such a crisis would never recur. The product of their labors was the University Senate, self-described as \"a policy-making body which may con¬ sider all matters of University-wide concern [and] all matters affecting more than one faculty or school.\" In September, at a reception that offered the opportunity to reflect on past suc¬ cesses and work yet to be done, sen¬ ators gathered to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their body politic. As finally approved in 1969, the 101- member Senate was seen as a compro¬ mise between the old University Coun¬ cil, composed only of administrators and senior faculty, and radical plans for joint student-faculty control of Colum¬ bia. Made up of administrators, junior and senior faculty, students, staff, and alumni, the Senate is not unique in its broad representation—other univer¬ sities developed similar senates at the time—but 20 years later, Columbia's version is distinguished by the fact that it still exists. \"That is noteworthy,\" said Karen Markoe, president of the SUNY Faculty Senate, who helped organize a national symposium on university senates last April. \"One of the problems that a lot of the all-inclusive senates had is that when the sparks stopped flying in the early 70's, the students stopped coming.\" In its first years, the Columbia Senate worked aggressively, drafting codes of academic freedom and tenure, resolv¬ ing to prohibit acceptance of grants for classified research, and assuring equal access to the campus for all recruiters, including the military. These days, there is less activism; more typical are the open hearings that have been con¬ ducted on subjects like changes in the Rules of University Conduct and the \"Strategies of Renewal\" report on the future of the University. The Senate now serves primarily as a forum where the different parts of the University community can talk with each other, air grievances, and bring themselves up to date. At a typical meeting, senators will question Presi¬ dent Sovern, who chairs the Senate, about matters ranging from the elim¬ ination of academic programs to cam¬ pus security. \"The Columbia of today is a far cry from those dark days of 1968,\" said Mr. Sovern, explaining the shift in the Sen¬ ate's focus. \"So much work has been done. The current Senate will deal with them [issues] on the margins, whereas the old Senate worked on the core problems.\" When the Senate was formed, no one had any illusions about who was still in charge of Columbia. All Senate deci¬ sions must be approved by the Trust¬ ees, who were the ones who had the power to ultimately vote the Senate into existence. The two groups have been known to disagree, especially when the Trustees rejected the Senate's unan¬ imous 1983 resolution calling for the University to divest its holdings in cor¬ porations doing business in South Africa. (More recently, selected sen¬ ators have been permitted to sit in on certain Trustee committee meetings, and abstracts of the Trustees' meetings are now available at the Senate office for review.) \"The only important thing the Senate can do without the Trustees' approval is to make the academic calendar and approve changes in degrees,\" said William Phipps, Secretary of the Sen¬ ate, who heads a full-time staff that keeps the minutes and records of the body in order, and helps set the agenda for the Senate's monthly meetings. \"It is not legislative in the sense that it provides for matters of University pol¬ icy on investments and acquisition of property and all that,\" said Frank Grad, Chamberlain Professor of Law and one of the Senate's founders. \"It does pro¬ vide an avenue for committees relating to degree programs, community rela¬ tions, and student affairs.\" But Tom Kamber '89, one of the most reform-minded student senators of recent years, does not believe that the mission of the Senate ends with discus¬ sion. \"If that was the only mandate of the Senate, then the Senate is not a governing body and they shouldn't call it a senate.\" Columbia College Today 13 He also believes that many of the conditions that gave rise to the Senate still exist. \"The nerve to say that those issues were all resolved!\" During his time in office, Mr. Kamber led some of his more progressive col¬ leagues in issuing proposals recom¬ mending the use of gender-neutral language in University discourse, the coeducation of fraternities, and the option of substituting community serv¬ ice for the physical education require¬ ment. He also organized, under Senate auspices, a series of discussion panels on community affairs. \"We had a very broad view of what the Senate should do.\" It is not a view shared by many sen¬ ators who are senior faculty and admin¬ istrators. The obstacles that Mr. Kamber and others have met—resolutions killed in committee or on the floor— may reflect not only disagreement, but the Senate's conservative estimate of its own function. \"I found that on the big issues, my colleagues were a craven lot and didn't go to the wall with me,\" said one for¬ mer member of the Executive Commit¬ tee, a tenured professor who asked not to be identified. He recalled that he could barely raise a cry of protest among his fellow members in 1987 when the name of the Architecture School was changed without Senate counsel. Criticizing the Senate, in fact, is as old as the Senate itself. In 1970, when it did not endorse a resolution by Faris Bouhafa '70 for Columbia to help raise bail for 21 Black Panthers held on con¬ spiracy charges, Mr. Bouhafa resigned from the Senate, calling it \"a magnifi¬ cent hoax.\" More recently, at a meeting last spring, senators Warigia Bowman '90 and Veena Sud (Barnard '89) pre¬ sented President Sovern with a white rat they called \"Michael\" and left the room without explanation. Like Mr. Bouhafa, Ms. Bowman later resigned her seat. \"The entire student body has been duped,\" she said, charging the Senate with ineffectiveness. Professor Grad's reaction to such charges is philosophical: \"People say the Senate hasn't taken care of this, that, and the other thing. Well, neither has God.\" On occasion, the Senate will speak for the University on matters of national import—as in 1970, when it denounced President Nixon's sending of troops into Cambodia—but such In Lumine Tuo: Research and honors • Honored: Centennial Professor of Chemistry Koji Nakanishi has won the American Chemical Society's 1990 Arthur C.

Dr. Nakanishi is a leader in the development of techniques to iso¬ late biochemicals that are difficult to study because they are produced in minute quantities. His methods have been used to investigate more than 160 products found in plants and animals, including red-tide toxins, natural insecticides, and antibiotics. • Honored: Larry Dais, Columbia's Assistant Vice President for Govern¬ ment Relations and Director of Community Relations, was recently named Man of Year by the YMC A of Greater New York for his work as a volunteer with the Harlem YMCA. Mr. Dais, the former head of Project Double Discovery, has been a Columbia administrator for 19 years, the last eight in Low Library. • Packard Fellowship: Yasutomo J. Uemura, Associate Professor of Physics, has received $500,000 from the David and Lucile Packard Foun¬ dation to support his research into superconductivity for the next five years. Professor Uemura, who received his doctorate from the Uni¬ versity of Tokyo in 1982, is studying high-temperature superconductors —a class of materials, discovered in 1986, which lose their resistance to electrical currents at relatively high temperatures. Superconductivity had previously been observed only in materials a little warmer than absolute zero (- 273 Celsius). • Slivers of Light: Columbia math¬ ematicians Gregory and David Chudnovsky reported last August that they had calculated pi—the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter—to more than one billion places. Working on computers at IBM's Watson Research Center and the Minnesota Supercomputer Cen¬ ter, the Chudnovsky brothers applied a new algorithm to the ancient problem and achieved a smashing success. Pi has fascinated mathematicians for thousands of years. It was known to the Babylonians and was roughly calculated in the Bible. The ratio comprises an inifinite sequence beginning with 3.141592653_According to the Columbia University Record, the Chudnovkys' billion-digit approx¬ imation would extend more than 1,200 miles, if written out. \"Calculat¬ ing pi to such extreme lengths requires trillions of complex mathe¬ matical operations and thus it looms as a rigorous test of the speed and accuracy of a mathematician's com¬ puters, computer programs and arithmetic strategies,\" the news¬ paper commented. Earlier last year, when they had computed pi to 480 million decimal places, Stewart Wills wrote in The New York Times, \"The Chudnovskys' achievement was not a work of prac¬ tical science but of poetry. They have coaxed from the darkness 480 million slivers of light.\" 14 • Named Chairs: Four distin¬ guished teachers were recently appointed to endowed profes¬ sorships, one of the highest faculty honors. Edward W. Said, the noted liter¬ ary and critical theorist, has been named Old Dominion Foundation Professor. The author of numerous works, including Orientalism, The World, the Text and the Critic, and the forthcoming Culture and Imperialism, he also serves as music critic for The Nation and writes a monthly column for the Arabic weekly al-Majalla, published in London. Born in Jeru¬ salem, Professor Said is a member of the Palestinian National Council and appears widely as a spokesman and commentator on the Palestinan cause. He has taught in Columbia College since 1963. Robert A. Ferguson, a scholar of American law and literature, has joined the faculty as George Edward Woodberry Professor in Literature and Criticism. He also serves as a professor in the Law School. Professor Ferguson is the author of the award-winning Law and Letters in American Culture and other works. His books in progress include The Trial in American Life and The Ameri¬ can Enlightenment, 1750-1820. In 1984, he received the Quantrell Award as Teacher of the Year in the Humanities Division of the Univer¬ sity of Chicago, where he taught for 14 years. Robert L. Jervis, an authority on international relations and national security, has been named Adlai E. Stevenson Professor in the School of International and Public Affairs. A former faculty member at Harvard and UCLA, Professor Jervis joined Columbia's political science depart¬ ment in 1980. He is the author of numerous studies, including Psy¬ chology and Deterrence (with Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Stein). His course in nuclear strategy and national security is offered jointly to graduate students and undergraduates. Mario Davidovsky, the composer and director of Columbia's Elec¬ tronic Music Center, has been named MacDowell Professor of Music. Professor Davidovsky, a native of Argentina, has earned many honors for his work, including the 1971 Pulitzer Prize in Music. He has taught at CCNY, Yale, the Univer¬ sities of Michigan and Pennsylva¬ nia, and the Manhattan School of Music. Since 1975, he has also directed the Composers' Confer¬ ence, at Wellesley College (formerly at Johnson College in Vermont). Pro¬ fessor Davidovsky has received commissions from numerous orchestras and institutions, includ¬ ing The Juilliard School, the San Francisco Symphony and the Phila¬ delphia Orchestra. • Appointed: The College named two new Assistant Deans of Stu¬ dents this year, Kathryn Balmer and Matt White '89. Mrs. Balmer, whose responsibili¬ ties include first-year students and orientation programs, is a former dean of student affairs at Trinity Col¬ lege in Illinois, her undergraduate alma mater. She is married to Ran¬ dall Balmer, the Hartley Hall profes¬ sor-in-residence. Mr. White, a former varsity swimmer and resi¬ dence advisor in Plimpton Hall, is now responsible for transfer stu¬ dents, advanced placement credit, and the Urban New York program. Leora Neter-Brovman, a widely respected administrator who departed on maternity leave last year after seven years as Assistant Dean, has elected not to return. Another former Assistant Dean of Students, the popular, savvy Peter Johnson, has been named Assistant Director of College Admissions, replacing Erika Hageman, who now teaches English at Red Bank Regional High School in New Jersey. Mr. Johnson's admissions territories include Massachusetts, New York City, and Puerto Rico; he also coordinates the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Committee. • Named: Patricia L. Francy, a Columbia administrator since 1969, has been appointed Treasurer of the University, while continuing to serve as University Controller. She now supervises Columbia's finan¬ cial accounting and the disburse¬ ment of $750 million to the University's 16 schools, as well as overseeing risk management, trust administration, short-term cash managment, long-term debt issu¬ ance, and government accounting and reporting. A graduate of Lewis and Clark College, Ms. Francy is chairman of the Women's Economic Roundtable and is active in a number of profes¬ sional organizations. • Named: Robert E. Pollack '61, Pro¬ fessor of Biological Sciences, was appointed in October to a five-year term on the board of trustees of Brandeis University, in Waltham, Mass. Founded in 1948, Brandeis is a research university with an under¬ graduate enrollment of 3,000. Professor Pollack, the Dean of Columbia College from 1982 to 1989, interrupted his one-year sabbatical leave in November to accept the Col¬ lege Alumni Association's Alex¬ ander Hamilton Medal. Columbia College Today 15 instances are rare. They occur. Presi¬ dent Sovern said, when \"there is a direct impact on Columbia. The Senate is not a political organization that speaks for Columbia on political issues.\" Last spring, Veena Sud tried to urge the Senate to draft letters to President Bush and the Supreme Court Justices, requesting them to uphold the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The resolution did not make it to the floor—not only because it was deemed not of central concern to Columbia, but because it was felt that there was enough disagreement about the issue to preclude the University from speaking with one voice. But at the end of the meeting, a majority of senators, including Presi¬ dent Sovern, remained for over half an hour to discuss the reasons for the Sen¬ ate's decision. It was an impromptu and frank forum, unprecedented in its spontaneity, and one that may have represented the original purpose of the Senate at its best. T.V. Not carved in stone The names of Homer, Herodotus, Sophocles, Plato, Aristotle, Demos¬ thenes, Cicero and Vergil are inscribed on the facade of Butler Library, as any visitor to Columbia knows.* This standing committee was appointed 55 years ago by President Nicholas Mur¬ ray Butler to represent the forefathers of Western poetry, history, drama, phi¬ losophy and oratory, and they were all men, which is what got Laura Hotch¬ kiss Brown so mad. During her years in the School of General Studies, from which she grad¬ uated last spring, as she daily viewed the Butler Eight, \"I grew angrier and angrier about it because I had come to *The east and west sides of the building bear the names of Cervantes, Shakespeare, Milton, Voltaire, Goethe, Horace, Tacitus, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas and Dante; panels under the front windows list great Americans: George Washington, Ben¬ jamin Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jeffer¬ son, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, James Madison, John Marshall, John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, Abra¬ ham Lincoln, Jonathan Edwards, Washing¬ ton Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, William Cullen Bryant, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Edgar Allan Poe, Henry David Thoreau, Herman Melville, Walt Whitman and Mark Twain. school as a writer and found I wasn't being taught about my tradition but was being taught a tradition very West¬ ern and male,\" Ms. Brown told CCT. \"Rather than get involved in the curric¬ ulum debates, which are all mired in bureaucracy, I wanted to make a state¬ ment.\" That statement took the form of a banner, inscribed with the names of seven female writers, to hang on the facade above the inscription on Com¬ mencement Day—\"my graduation present to the University.\" She spent several years, she says, choosing the names, confining herself to the six languages she knew. She set¬ tled on Sappho (the Greek poet of the 6th century B.C.); Marie de France (a writer of short fiction, believed to have been French, active 1160-1215); Chris¬ tine de Pizan (a Venetian-born Parisian poet of the late 14th century); Sor Juana In£s de la Cruz (the 17th-century Mex¬ ican poet and scholar); Bronte (the 19th- century English novelists Charlotte, Emily and Anne); Dickinson (Emily, the 19th-century American poet); and Woolf (Virginia, the 20th-century Eng¬ lish novelist). From the original plans for Butler, which Ms. Brown found in Avery Library, she copied the type face and dimensions of the inscription. With a friend's help she sewed the 130-foot banner out of nylon canvas, and painted it with the seven names—she had hoped to include Jane Austen and George Eliot, but ran out of space. Finally came the task of smuggling the banner, ropes and other equipment into Butler and concealing them in machine rooms on the roof, and plan¬ ning entry into the library, which is closed on Commencement Day— \"rather like a bank robbery,\" she says. During the ceremonies on May 17, as she and four accomplices began to hang their rebel flag from the roof of Butler, they were arrested by security guards, charged with trespassing, and told they would never see the banner again. Undaunted, Ms. Brown wrote to Ward Dennis, Dean of the School of General Studies, asking official ap¬ proval for the banner. Reminding him that she had graduated summa cum laude and won the John Angus Burrell Memorial Prize and the Arthur E. Ford Poetry Award, she wrote, \"I am a woman. I am also one of Columbia's finest graduates. This is not a new phe¬ nomenon; women have always been extremely intelligent and articulate. Sappho was writing poetry at nearly the same time as Homer.... Her work was revered and copied by many male poets whose work we still read today.\" Yet, argued Ms. Brown, women have been \"constantly thwarted in their attempts to assemble and maintain their half of the Western tradition.... In spite of all the honors I have re¬ ceived, none could mean as much to me as seeing the names of these women, even briefly, on the facade of Butler.\" Dean Dennis was persuaded. He suggested that she appeal to Elaine Sloan, the University librarian, and with their support, and that of Colum¬ bia's Institute for Research on Women and Gender, the banner was finally installed on September 25. This time, the event was garnished with a press release, a series of faculty lectures about the authors, and an exhibit on the third floor of Butler. Scheduled to hang for a week, the banner actually stayed up for a month, due to the illness of a maintenance man. The trespassing charges were dropped. \"And so a project that began as an act of protest by a student became an insti¬ tutionally sponsored event,\" said Ms. Brown, addressing several dozen cele¬ brants at the reception following the banner's second unfurling. \"This is America,\" said Ms. Brown. \"For the first time in the history of humanity men and women of all races and religions are living together in one place, and, in theory, all of them are free. The challenge to Americans is to come to accept diversity, to find joy in it, and to pass this understanding on, in a positive way, to our children.\" Yet, she said, \"Those who give up their cul¬ ture for ours find that America offers them little more than the ability to buy a washing machine on credit... We have no coherent American culture of anything like the depth of culture of the peoples who come here... We must all fight the lie inherent in the concept that the works of Western European male society are the finest works available to us as Americans... We must say with one voice: We will have no education without representation.\" One balmy evening in October, the steps of Low Beach were crowded with people looking across the campus at the library, the banner, and the fading sky. \"I'm glad they finally did it,\" said one student. \"It took a while. But it's 16 cicno ? vj 7 1 ** ^ ■ !

Sappho's more emotional. Now, if it was The Princess ofCleves [the 17th-century novel by Madame de La Fayette]—but that's like a concession— they ended up with an empty period so they stuck her in.\" Although she likes Plato, she is no fan of Aristotle: \"He writes outlines—it's like reading a car manual.\" \"I think it's great but I would have chosen Austen over Bronte,\" said Nic¬ ole Adaniya '90. \"Women's work in the past hasn't been represented very well, though I know a lot of professors make a great effort to talk about women as writers. Western culture, however, was built on the words of many men, so you can't help but concentrate on the works of men.\" Her classmate Eric Strumingher was less enthusiastic: \"If they're trying to show these are equivalents I don't think that's accurate. I don't know any women authors who've contributed to philosophy or oratory—maybe some did but none of the work has survived. History's not on their side, so to speak. We've had hundreds of years to con¬ sider [the men's] work, but not the women, except Sappho. I like Homer better.\" Nor were all the women pleased. Alysoun Hurst, a Barnard freshman, wrote to the Federalist Paper, a student weekly: \"I don't want to look up to the best men or the best minority authors, but the best. That is why I am at school. ... By placing a banner of 'women' authors over Butler's facade of 'men' authors we are drawing a dangerous comparison and limiting one's accom¬ plishments to their sex, not promoting anyone's greatness.\" And three other Barnard students, Colette Brown, Risha Henry and Ken- yatta Monroe, wrote to the Barnard Bul¬ letin: \"In this male-oriented and male- dominated university that requires us to deny our sex (if we are not male), our ethnicity (if we are not white), and our class (if we are not affluent), how can we effectively protest the constant assault on our non-elitist sensibilities? ... The fact that Brown's protest took the same form as what she was protest¬ ing—a canon—rendered her intended statement weak and ineffectual.... We suggest another protest. And it too includes a banner. But our banner is blank and covers all the names on But¬ ler Library.\" J-R- In Memoriam The campus recently mourned the deaths of three College faculty members. Harold Barger, Professor Emeritus of Economics, died August 9 at his home in Kinderhook, N. Y. He was 82. Professor Barger taught at Columbia from 1937 to 1975 and was chairman of the economics department from 1961 to 1964, when he was named the first director of Columbia's programs at Reid Hall in Paris. Born in London, he attended Cam¬ bridge University and the London School of Economics and became a spe¬ cialist in monetary theory and income and employment theory. He was a researcher and consultant for a number of U.S. government agencies, includ¬ ing the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Mines. During World II and its aftermath he served in the Office of Strategic Services and as an assistant division chief for the State Department. Professor Barger was especially devoted to Columbia College students and served as an assistant to the dean from 1954 to 1959. He published many papers and books in his field, including the textook Money, Banking and Public Policy (1962) and College on Credit (1981), co-authored with his wife, Gwyneth. Edgar Kaufmann, Jr., Adjunct Profes¬ sor Emeritus of Architecture, died of Columbia College Today 17 leukemia last July 31. He was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan. A teacher, scholar, curator and phi¬ lanthropist, Mr. Kaufmann inherited Fallingwater, the famous Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house near Pitts¬ burgh, in 1955; he later arranged for the structure and surrounding lands to be preserved as a public museum. A member of both the art history and architecture departments at Columbia from 1962 to 1981, Mr. Kaufman was also curator of the department of indus¬ trial design at the Museum of Modern Art. In 1970, he organized \"The Rise of an American Architecture 1815-1915,\" a large-scale exhibition at the Metropoli¬ tan Museum of Art. He was a founding director of the Architectural History Foundation and the author of numer¬ ous essays and books, including a vol¬ ume on Fallingwater and a forthcoming book of commentaries on Frank Lloyd Wright. Allan M. Sachs, Professor of Physics and a faculty member for more than 40 years, died of a heart attack near his home in Dobbs Ferry, N. Y. on Septem¬ ber 20. He was 68. Professor Sachs, who was awarded Columbia's 1977 Great Teacher Award, chaired the physics department from 1967 to 1971 and was associate director of the University's Nevis Laboratories from 1972 until his death. He had directed Columbia's Science Honors Program for gifted high school stu¬ dents since 1968. A native New Yorker, Professor Sachs earned the B. A., M. A. and Ph.D. from Harvard, with time out for wartime service in Burma as a glider pilot for the U.S. Army Air Force. He joined the Columbia faculty in 1949. In the early 1950's, he collaborated with Jack Steinberger, a co-winner of last year's Nobel Prize, on early experi¬ ments to measure the fundamental properties of subatomic pi-mesons. Later, working with John Peoples, then Professor Sachs's student and now director of the Fermi National Acceler¬ ator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., Profes¬ sor Sachs helped produce precise measurements of the decay of muons, particles that exist for two-millionths of a second before decaying into an elec¬ tron and two neutrinos. The research provided evidence to support theories of weak interactions between sub¬ atomic particles. Columbia College Yesterday 10 Years Ago—Fall 1979 October: California Gov.

In his new book, Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory (Oxford University Press, 1989), from which this article is excerpted, Assistant Professor of Religion Randall Balmer takes readers into the con¬ servative Protestant world of born-again fundamen¬ talism. Mr. Balmer is less interested in mass-market televangelists like Jerry Falwell, Billy Graham or Jimmy Swaggart than in the individuals and insti¬ tutions whose daily lives are filled with Biblical fear and love. The author's journey took him to eleven way- illustrations by Denise Donnell stations of American evangelicalism. His stops included a summer Bible camp in the Adirondacks, the anti-abortion political organizations of the Iowa Republicans, an Episcopal mission to a bleak Sioux Indian Reservation in North Dakota, a black minis¬ try that blends religious and social activism in Mis¬ sissippi, and a post-hippie revivalist movement in Southern California. \"I have tried as much as possible in this eth¬ nographic study,\" Professor Balmer says, \"to allow people to tell their own stories and thereby render a portrait—or at least a collage—of evangelicalism, America's folk religion, in all its variation and diver¬ sity. \"—Editor Columbia College Today 19 F or some months I had been looking for a Southern camp meeting to get a flavor of old-time religion. There are plenty to choose from in America today, from Alabama to Oregon, Florida to California; one directory, published by Asbury College in Kentucky, listed 114 camp meetings for 1987, but even this list was by no means exhaustive. Then one day a brochure arrived in the mail. \"Enjoy a South¬ ern Vacation in a Spiritual Atmosphere,\" it said, sounding more like an invitation to a cruise than a revival. The theme of this year's conference was \"Free Indeed,\" which could mean almost any¬ thing from a kind of right-wing, patriotic free¬ dom to freedom from sin—or a combination of the two. Camp Freedom advertised itself as \"wholesomely interdenominational,\" but I had little else to go on before my arrival in St. Petersburg, Florida. The rising bell at Camp Freedom chimes at six-thirty. When I pulled into the campground shortly thereafter, it was still dark. By seven o'clock the faithful had gathered in the chapel (known here as a tabernacle) for Morning Prayer. Brother Bedsaul Agee, a large, portly man with a booming voice, took charge of the meeting and introduced Brother Rissinger, frail and infirm, to deliver the morning medita¬ tion. Rissinger's Bible shook noticeably as he spoke about his concern for the \"falling away from holiness principles\" among the people of God. Holiness. A large sign over the platform behind Rissinger read holiness unto the lord. The people who run Camp Freedom come out of the holiness tradition, a movement emanating from John Wesley's conviction that the biblical injunction \"Be ye perfect\" should be taken literally and that complete freedom from sin was possible in this life. Wesley's belief in \"entire sanctification\" became popular in the nineteenth century, especially in Methodist circles. The holiness movement emphasized the centrality of sanctification or the \"second blessing\" of the Holy Spirit, which followed the experience of conversion. The second blessing eradicated \"inbred sin,\" perfected the will, and thereby rendered the believer free from sin. By the close of the nineteenth cen¬ tury, however, the Methodist hierarchy had grown chary about the enthusiasm and emo¬ tion that attended holiness gatherings, so many of the people drawn to holiness beliefs broke away from Methodism (and other denominations) to form holiness churches, such as the Church of the Nazarene and the Pilgrim Holiness Church. Other denomina¬ tions also retain strong ties to the holiness movement, including the Wesleyan Church, the Bible Methodists, the Brethren in Christ, the Salvation Army, and the Church of God (Anderson, Indiana), among others. Those in the holiness tradition emphasize the gifts of the Spirit, including divine healing, and their worship tends to be lively and enthusiastic. Brother Rissinger, I am certain, was once a lively and enthusiastic preacher, and even now there are flashes of his former fire when he inveighs against the holiness people who dare to attend church only on Sunday mornings and not on Sunday evenings and during the week. \"Time is getting short,\" he warned, \"there is not much time anymore.\" As evangelical preachers are wont to do, Rissinger talked about his own religious experiences. \"The Lord sanctified me in 1945,\" he said. \"The feeling was wonderful. I've never had the same feeling since.\" He compared the Christian life to a pond and said that if there is no overflow to the pond, it becomes stagnant and covered with scum. \"I truly don't like to see all that scum on top,\" he said. \"We need to get rid of the scum. The world is looking to us for spiritual refresh¬ ment. That life of yours should be continually flowing. Let your life overflow.\" When Rissinger sat down, Bedsaul Agee took charge once again and thanked \"the dear brother\" for his meditation. He then invited the congregation forward for prayer, where¬ upon everyone gathered near the platform, knelt, and began praying aloud—simulta¬ neously. The effect was a cacophonous mur¬ mur accented by an excited emphasis from time to time that punctuated the din. \"Amen!\" \"Oh, Father!\" \"Praise the Lord!\" \"Burn within our hearts and stir us. Lord!\" \"Praise Jesus!\" \"Hallelujah!\" \"Father, we want a blessing. We want to feel it. Give it to us, God. Glo -ry to Jesus!\" T he overall effect was a long, plaintive wail. At various moments, a head rose and a handkerchief wiped a tear before the head bowed again to resume praying. \"Burn within our hearts and stir us. Lord!\" \"Amen!\" \"Praise Jesus!\" \"Heal the sick.\" \"Help us Lord, in a special way to get the victory done!\" \"Heal the sick.\" \"Oh, Jesus, Jesus!\" \"Help us. Lord!\" \"We love thy truth. We love this book,\" one man said, raising his Bible. \"Fill us today!\" \"May our souls be blessed. May we be comforted.\" \"Amen!\" After about fifteen minutes, the collective murmur rose to a crescendo, full of noise and excitation, like a long-distance runner expend¬ ing a final burst of energy in a chug toward the finish line. The praying continued for another ten minutes, but one by one members of the congregation rose from their knees, adjusted eyeglasses, and waited in silence for the eight o'clock breakfast bell. The gathering was all white and quite elderly—I didn't see anyone who looked under fifty—but I was still puzzled about the group's denominational ties. Nearly all of the “The Lord sanctified me in 1945,\" he said. “The feeling was wonderful. I've never had the same feeling since.\" 20 The Second Great Awakening—a 19th- century revival that convulsed New England, western New York, and the Cumberland Valley —tamed some of the rowdiness of frontier life. women wore white bonnets on their heads, the sort of covering that most of us associate with the Amish. A few of the men had long beards. Some of them wore suits and neckties, others wore suits and dress shirts buttoned to the neck, but no ties. At the close of the prayer meeting, a man who introduced himself as Larry Strouse came up to me and said, \"I don't believe I've seen you here before. Are you a Christian?\" By now, toward the end of my travels, I should have been prepared for the question, because I had faced it so often. It was, I had decided long ago, just another way of asking, \"Who are you? Can I trust you?\" As we stood in line at the dining hall, Strouse began to address some of my questions about Camp Freedom. Most of the people there came from the Great Lakes region: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Ontario. Many were Wesleyan Methodists or Brethren in Christ. A lot of the folks at Camp Freedom, Strouse told me, had grown up as Mennonites or Amish but had abandoned those churches after their experience of sanctification. Strouse, dressed in a sportcoat and tie, leaned toward me and lowered his voice. \"There's no salvation in them there customs and traditions,\" he said in a conspiratorial tone. \"Most of them Amish people aren't even saved.\" Many of those who had been born again, like the ones at Camp Freedom, maintained their traditional dress, even though they had been excommunicated by their fellow Mennonites and Amish. A t breakfast, I sat across the table from Jacob and Ada Sollenberger, beekeepers from Franklin County, Pennsylvania. With only the slightest prompting, they told me their life stories. Both grew up in the Old Order River Brethren, a religious group begun in the eighteenth century by Jacob Engle and so named because most of his followers lived along the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania and because of their insistence on baptism by trine (threefold) immersion in a flowing river. Ada Sollenberger, a warm, lovely woman of seventy-five, and Jacob, her bearded husband, seventy-one years old and a bit quieter than his wife but no less genial, were dressed as though they had just stepped off the set of Witness, Hollywood's 1985 motion picture about the Amish. \"The Bible teaches modesty and sim¬ plicity,\" Mrs. Sollenberger explained. \"Romans 8 tells us to present our bodies as a living sacri¬ fice to the Lord, and First Corinthians instructs the women to keep their heads covered.\" Despite her upbringing, Ada Sollenberger said, \"I didn't start to serve the Lord until I was twenty-six years old. I had a real experience with God,\" she said. \"Before that I dressed quite fashionable. I could show you pictures.\" A couple of years after her conversion, she met Jacob at a River Brethren love feast in Jacob's parents' home. They were married after a short courtship; forty-seven years later they clearly remain devoted to one another and openly affectionate. \"God did not get me a husband until I got my life turned around,\" Ada said, placing her arm around Jacob's shoulders. E ven though they were both born-again Christians when they married, their sec¬ ond blessing didn't come until later. \"When the Lord took our second child,\" Ada said, \"I was just broken. But then the Lord touched me and I was filled with the Holy Spirit. This was in 1944.\" Shortly thereafter, she continued, \"Jacob had his big experience with the Lord.\" \"I had church pride,\" Jacob interjected, meaning a kind of religious arrogance. \"But then I was filled with the Holy Ghost.\" \"It happened at home in bed,\" Mrs. Sollen¬ berger added, without a trace of guile or irony. \"The Lord filled him up with glory.
