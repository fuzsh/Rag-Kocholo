However, the increasing production and use of 2D materials necessitate a thorough evaluation of the potential impact on human health and the environment. Furthermore, harmonized test protocols are needed with which to assess the safety of 2D materials. The Graphene Flagship project (2013–2023), funded by the European Commission, addressed the identification of the possible hazard of graphene-based materials as well as emerging 2D materials including transition metal dichalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitride, and others. Additionally, so-called green chemistry approaches were explored to achieve the goal of a safe and sustainable production and use of this fascinating family of nanomaterials. The present review provides a compact survey of the findings and the lessons learned in the Graphene Flagship.\n\nKeywords: 2D nanomaterials, carbon materials, exposure, environment, toxicity, hazard, safe-by-design, biodegradability, test guidelines\n\nIntroduction\n\nTwo-dimensional (2D) materials have grown in importance ever since they were discovered to have properties different from their bulk form.1 The world of 2D materials spans from the well-known graphene-based materials (GBMs) to the up-and-coming 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes), and 2D monoelemental materials (Xenes), as well as 2D clays (i.e., layered double hydroxides and layered silicates), metals and alloys. In a very recent assessment on the health and environmental impact of 2D materials, commissioned by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA),2 the features of graphene and other 2D materials and specific toxicity effects of various 2D materials were reported, highlighting some gaps and a need for long-term/chronic studies, particularly for in vivo studies using repeated dose administrations. The latter report, which is complementary to the present review, contains an appendix in which the conclusions from each article (more than 650 articles) are summarized in tabular form, along with the physicochemical properties of the tested materials, and the model systems used (i.e., in vitro, in vivo, and/or environmental model systems).2\n\nThe European Commission’s Future and Emerging Technology (FET) Flagship Project, the Graphene Flagship (www.graphene-flagship.eu), is one of the biggest ever European research initiatives. The rapid development of the field of graphene and emerging 2D materials (i.e., molybdenum disulfide, tungsten disulfide and hexagonal boron nitride, hBN), as investigated in the Flagship (2013–2023), has culminated in the need for a comprehensive review of the findings, especially those related to exposure and hazard. The aim of the present review is thus to provide an update of our previous review published in 2018,3 where we focused mainly on graphene family materials. Here, we address GBMs as well as other 2D materials such as TMDs and hBN, both with respect to their (sustainable) synthesis, and their potential impact on the environment and human health, including a detailed survey of the literature published during the past 5 years concerning effects on the main target organs, and the principal environmental compartments. We also address some of the concerns that many researchers face when conducting safety assessments of existing and emerging 2D materials and provide a perspective on future developments in the field.\n\nToward “Green” 2D Materials\n\nIn order to evaluate the human health and environmental impact of 2D materials and to correlate the effects with their physicochemical properties, it is of paramount importance to perform and provide a thorough characterization. An early description of the electrical characteristics of atomically thin carbon layers (named graphene) prepared by micromechanical exfoliation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite was published 20 years ago (2004).4 Graphene consists of a single layer of monocrystalline graphite with sp2-hybridized carbon atoms organized in a honeycomb structure. This specific carbon nanostructure is heavily entering various industrial markets covering numerous applications in the field of materials science and biomedicine. Its properties are surpassing those of other materials making graphene an alternative choice in the development of advanced batteries, fuel cells, reinforced composites, electronic and optoelectronic devices, (bio) sensors, and many others.5 Following the seminal discovery of graphene, a myriad of research articles has exploited the advantages of GBMs. In 2014, the Graphene Flagship proposed a framework to eliminate naming inconsistency (e.g., inappropriate use of the term graphene) by classifying all GBMs depending on C/O ratio, lateral dimension, and thickness.6 Other 2D materials derived from many different elements were postulated to benefit from similar classification, with in silico studies identifying more than 5000 layered bulk compounds, 1825 of which are potentially exfoliable.7 In this context, the Graphene Flagship brought onboard the most promising 2D candidates such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and the work package dedicated to the impact on health and environment focused on the assessment of the potential hazards and risks of such materials. In the following sections we highlight the latest advances in 2D materials synthesis that have been evaluated by the Health and Environment work package of the Graphene Flagship. We focus, in particular, on so-called “green” chemistry approaches, a key element of sustainable development of 2D materials, in line with the EU’s Chemical Strategy for Sustainability (2020).\n\nGraphene-Based Materials\n\nIt is challenging to select a synthesis method for GBMs that works in all scenarios, mainly due to the wide variety of potential applications. For example, the same graphene properties will not be required in field-effect transistor to detect coronaviruses (e.g., single/few use(s), low amount, protected from the external environment, reduced exposure to individuals),8 or in cementitious composites (e.g., large scale production, long-term use, long exposure to environmental conditions and individuals).9 A growing interest in 2D materials for wearable electronics and implantable sensors also requires in-depth consideration,10,11 as it is envisaged that these devices may interact with numerous organs and tissues (e.g., skin, brain, mouth, arteries, etc.). Strongly connected to the development and applications of 2D materials, the “safe and sustainable-by-design” (SSbD) concept plays an important role to encourage avoiding the use of hazardous chemicals for their synthesis (e.g., use of gallons of toxic organic solvents or strong acids to prepare graphene or graphene oxide from graphite). This concept goes hand in hand with the overall life cycle assessment (LCA) of GBMs, where the green chemistry principles are fundamental to reduce the environmental impact (and see section Life Cycle Perspective on 2D Materials).12\n\nWe have previously described the production methods with the focus on aqueous suspensions of GBMs, since they are usually preferred for in vitro and in vivo studies.3 However, there is a need to improve and develop up-to-date routes for GBM synthesis for even nondispersible forms. For example, we recently developed a synthesis of 13C-rich few-layer graphene (FLG) to facilitate the detection and quantification of the material by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) in different biological compartments ( ).13\n\nThe field is also looking for sustainable production alternatives. In this context, a scalable method for producing large quantities of high-quality graphene flakes using a sugar-based edible wax via three roll millings was proposed.14 Co-crystals of graphene and sugar can be also prepared by ball milling of graphite in the presence of carbohydrates, which enables the formation of graphene dispersions in water with lower toxicity in skin cells than pure FLG.15 Ball-milling was combined with a viscous glucose syrup to prepare ultrathin (few layers) graphene, hBN, and TMD flake suspensions in water.16 These examples highlight the possibility of avoiding the use of organic solvent in the production of 2D materials. It is, however, important to underline that the final materials contain the exfoliating agents necessary to stabilize the suspensions that might not be desirable for a wide range of applications (e.g., in electronics). Many toxicological assessments conducted by the Graphene Flagship partners have also included additional controls to ascertain the impact of the additives present in the dispersions.\n\nIn fact, substantial research efforts are devoted to the sustainable production of graphene in powder form by chemical vapor deposition,17 which was initially conceived to produce graphene deposited onto a substrate. These approaches rely on the deposition of graphene on easily removable support such as soluble crystals (e.g., cubic NaCl).18 This methodology has also been exploited to prepare other 2D materials.19 The materials mentioned above will be addressed in the subsequent sections devoted to environmental and human health risks.\n\nGraphene oxide (GO) is the single-layer oxidized form of graphene, where the carbon lattice of graphene is doped with oxygen-containing groups such as hydroxyls, epoxides, and carboxylates. GO is among the most studied GBMs due to its high dispersibility, particularly in water, and its easy access in large quantities obtained from graphite. The most widely used method for GO synthesis is based on the protocol described by Hummers in 1958,20 which has been significantly improved in the last 15 years21,22 However, this method uses harsh conditions (e.g., high temperature, strong acids, and oxidants). Toward a “greener” and more sustainable production of GO, in the last years, electrochemical conditions have been investigated to achieve GO with tunable properties (e.g., different oxidation levels) in an aqueous environment.23 We will not focus on the different methods for the synthesis of GO here as they were described in our previous review,3 and they have been recently reviewed by others.24,25 Interestingly, we demonstrated that the biodegradability of GO depends on the molecules grafted to its surface.26 This knowledge allowed us to prepare for example a biodegradable GO-based conjugate for targeted cancer therapy.27 The “degradation-by-design” concept developed in these studies is instrumental for future application of GO and other GBMs in different domains, as the biodegradability of such material is a key aspect to consider and implement in LCA.28\n\nWhen the oxygenated groups on GO are partially removed, one can achieve so-called reduced GO (rGO), endowed with properties similar to graphene. The reduction of GO is obtained by many different physical or chemical methods, either in laboratory conditions or directly in the environment.29,30 Many of these methods are “green” as they exploit light irradiation, high temperatures, or natural reductants. The photothermal reduction of GO by laser irradiation was recently reviewed,31 but photoreduction occurs also in the environment under sunlight or using different UV wavelengths.32,33 Alternatively, the thermal reduction of GO is one of the most used approaches to prepare rGO because it is relatively easy and leads to high-purity material as no chemical reductants are involved.34 Microwave reduction is also another sustainable alternative.35 The chemical reduction of GO is mainly performed using classical, often toxic, reduction agents (e.g., hydrazine, sodium borohydride, sodium hydrosulfite). Electrochemical conditions have been investigated to achieve GO with tunable properties (e.g., different oxidation levels) in an aqueous environment.23 However, it has been shown that chemical transformations of GO may also occur using molecules from the environment. While reduction of GO by phytoextracts has been reported back in 2012,36 this has re-emerged in the recent years.37 The level of reduction and the purity of the obtained rGO strongly depend on the reducing effect of the plant extracts and on the experimental conditions (e.g., high temperature), as we mentioned above that temperature affects the reduction of GO. There is still a strong push to develop more hydrophilic graphene derivatives with selective functionalization capabilities. Graphene acid and cyanographene are two emerging GBMs that could be very beneficial for nanotherapeutics.38\n\nMany challenges remain regarding the preparation of stable water dispersions of graphene using “green” procedures. One of the most exploited methods is the use of ultrasound-triggered mechanical exfoliation in the presence of surfactants that are able to intercalate between graphite layers. However, for biological applications and toxicological evaluations of graphene, it is compulsory to use nontoxic molecules. A derivative of vitamin B2, namely the sodium salt of riboflavin-5′-phosphate, resulted in a very effective means of exfoliating graphite in water leading to the formation of concentrated aqueous dispersions of FLG stable for months.39\n\nTransition Metal Dichalcogenides\n\nThe family of TMDs comprises a set of materials composed of a layer of metal atoms (e.g., Mo, W, or Re) sandwiched between two layers of chalcogenide atoms (e.g., S, Se, or Te). Similar to most 2D materials, TMDs can be obtained by bottom-up or top-down approaches. In general, the exfoliation approaches work similarly for the different members of the family. For example, MoS2, MoSe2, WSe2, and WTeS2 can be prepared by several methods including CVD, sonochemical reaction, micromechanical exfoliation, liquid phase exfoliation, etc.40−42 The selected method will define final material properties. For instance, liquid exfoliated MoS2 (e.g., ultrasonicated in water and/or organic solvents) is a semiconductor, while chemically exfoliated MoS2 (e.g., prepared via intercalation of organolithium compounds) is metallic. The inversion of the electronic properties is due to a phase transition from hexagonal (2H, semiconducting) to trigonal (1T, metallic) MoS2 crystal lattice. In silico calculations suggested that sulfur vacancies help to break the kinetic barrier for the 2H-1T transition, which would not take place on a perfect 2H phase.43 Besides, experimental studies consistently showed that this transition is attributed to the thermal activation and charge injection that occurs as a consequence of metal doping.44 An early protocol for the synthesis of 1T-MoS2 was reported in 1986.45 First, organolithium compounds were intercalated within the layered structure. Then, the intercalated MoS2 was ultrasonicated in water resulting in aqueous dispersions of 1T-MoS2. Most research articles reported in recent years still apply this protocol. Functionalized 1T-MoS2 was either used to selectively bind enzymes,46 or loaded with drugs to combine chemo- and photothermal therapies.47 However, the short-term stability is one of the major disadvantage of 1T-MoS2. The aging of 1T-MoS2 dispersions evidenced that the material oxidizes from Mo(IV) to Mo(VI) in the form of molybdate ions. Light, alkaline pH, and water dissolved oxygen accelerate the degradation of 1T-MoS2.48 This work is instrumental as it guides proper storage of 1T-MoS2 dispersions. This evanescent characteristic of 1T-MoS2 might be problematic for long-term applications in electronic devices, but it can be a desirable property to prevent its accumulation in the organisms and the environment. On the other hand, 2H-MoS2 sheets are far more stable over time. The production of high quality and large flakes of single-layer 2H-MoS2 generally relies on synthetic routes starting from precursors (e.g., bottom-up approach) or on micromechanical exfoliation of MoS2 crystals, which are very expensive, difficult to scale up, and have a very low yield. Therefore, the typical method for generating 2H-MoS2 dispersions involves liquid phase exfoliation.49 The process starts with the addition of bulk material to a solvent. The mixture is then ultrasonicated to break the structure into smaller flakes, then purified by centrifugation. Producing single-layer flakes using these methods results in significantly lower yields. In most studies, a trade-off is made between flake quality and yield, often at the expense of flake quality.\n\nWith the aim of improving exfoliation methods, alternative approaches have been developed. Analogously to graphene, MoS2 and WS2 were successfully exfoliated using ball milling.50,51 This process involves the intercalation of a compound within the layers of the materials, aiming to absorb the energy upon ball collision. These collisions result in normal and shear forces that break and exfoliate the bulk materials. Exploiting this methodology, glycine was used as exfoliating agent to prepare aqueous dispersions of MoS2 and WS2 endowed with long stability.50 Notably, the obtained nanosheets can be freeze-dried and stored as powders, which are easily redispersed upon a brief ultrasonication. These ball milled MoS2 nanosheets were tested on primary human basophils showing low inflammatory responses.52 The results were analogous for MoS2 nanosheets produced by the wet-jet milling technique.53 The latter work exploits the shear forces produced when a material dispersion passes through a nozzle of adjustable size. This procedure significantly reduces the production times. The production of 2H-MoS2 nanosheets was performed using less conventional approaches such as microwave irradiation.54,55 Exfoliation of TMDs can be also achieved by combining more than one approach. Ball milling of bulk MoS2 in the presence of bile salts was associated with the ultrasonication-assisted exfoliation in water at 0 °C.56 This avoids the use of toxic chemicals and solvents. Alternatively, electrochemical methods are commonly combined with ultrasonication-assisted exfoliation. Moreover, large 2H-MoS2 crystals (ca. 50 μm) were prepared by electrochemical exfoliation.57\n\nHexagonal Boron Nitride\n\nIn hBN, three atoms of boron are covalently bonded to three atoms of nitrogen forming a honeycomb lattice similar to graphene; indeed, hBN is sometimes referred to as “white graphene”. hBN has excellent thermal conductivity and stability, it is transparent in the UV and visible regions, it is hard and is considered an insulator since it has a band gap around 5.97 eV,58 modifiable by various techniques (e.g., doping or functionalization).59 All these properties make single-layer hBN a promising material in (opto) electronics, composites, drug delivery, biosensing, gas separation and storage. Like other 2D materials, large-scale production of high-quality hBN flakes is a major challenge. The bottom-up approaches by chemical60 or physical61 vapor deposition have been used to obtain films of single- to few-layer hBN with applications in electronics. However, biological applications and toxicological studies usually require aqueous dispersions of hBN. Pyrolysis of compounds containing B and N atoms (e.g., boron oxide and urea) has successfully resulted in nontoxic aqueous dispersions of hBN.62,63 Exfoliation of bulk hBN applying methods inspired by the Hummers’ method,64 using reactions with long-chain amines,65 fluorinated molecules,66 among others, have been explored. However, these approaches lead to hBN with low yields and quality. Exfoliated hBN was also obtained chemically in the form of ribbons using BN nanotubes as starting material, although the method requires harsh chemicals (e.g., K metal) to obtain mono- and few-layer hBN nanoribbons dispersible in isopropanol.67,68\n\nOn one hand, the methods mentioned above are specific for BN since they rely on its chemical reactivity. On the other hand, thanks to the structural similarity with graphene, most exfoliation methods developed to exfoliate graphene work also for hBN.62 hBN suspensions were successfully prepared by liquid exfoliation assisted by ultrasonication,49 microfluidization,69 ball-milling,50 electrochemical production,70 and wet-jet milling.53 All these methods can be optimized to achieve 2D hBN suspensions in aqueous media for biological and toxicological studies.71\n\nThis overview of “green” synthesis approaches provides a basis to better understand the health and environmental impacts of 2D materials, discussed in the following sections.\n\nEnvironmental Impact of 2D Materials\n\nEnvironmental impact assessment is a process starting from scoping to monitoring followed by analysis and reporting. It includes both human health risk assessment and ecological risk assessment (ERA). In this section we will focus on the latter, referring to the evaluation of potential risks arising from 2D materials released by human activities into the environment, with emphasis on studies published during the past 5 years. displays the different types of 2D materials (i.e., GO, rGO, FLG, graphene, MoS2, hBN, MXene, and black phosphorus) and the invertebrate and vertebrate aquatic and organisms, fungi, and plants that they can encounter in the different ecosystems, described in this section, together with their possible effects. The assessment aims to identify the impact of these substances on all living organisms within the diverse range of ecosystems. One way to address the challenge of obtaining toxicity data for all organisms in an ecosystem is to select representative species from major taxonomic groups and use them as substitutes for the entire system. The ERA process requires not only a good understanding of the exposome, but also the use of biological tools to assess the hazards posed to organisms by chemical pollution or malfunctions that disturb normal functioning of natural ecosystems. Fish have traditionally been used as indicators to evaluate water quality in aquatic environments, but other groups of organisms such as invertebrates, worms, molluscs, and insect larvae have been shown to be equally or more relevant than fish due to their crucial role in ecosystems. Among vertebrates, amphibians are of particular interest for ecological and physiological reasons, as discussed below.\n\n2D Material Impact on Invertebrates\n\nThe invertebrates are important organisms in ecotoxicological studies. They are valued for their relatively short life cycle, rapid reproduction, high reproductive rates, and high sensitivity toward pollutants. Moreover, their central position in the food chain, and the fact that they are intermediate consumers (feeding on primary producers such as algae and bacteria and thereafter consumed by larger organisms such as fish and amphibian) puts them in a key position.\n\nOne of the most studied invertebrates to evaluate ecotoxicity is the crustacean Daphnia, which is widely distributed in freshwater ecosystems and is easy to culture, making it convenient to use in controlled environments. The daphnia species Daphnia magna and D. pulex as well as Ceriodaphnia dubia, are largely used in standardized toxicity tests regulated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and International Standardization Organization (ISO). Daphnia spp. is used in test guidelines OECD TG 202 and ISO 6341 to determine acute toxicity following 48 h exposure to young daphnids (aged <24 h). The test end point is usually immobilization (loss of ability to move within 15 s under soft agitation) or mortality.72−74 Calculated effective concentration EC50 values at 48 h refer to concentration levels that result in immobilization (or mortality) of 50% of daphnids at the end of the exposure period. A recent review75 reported acute effects after short-term exposure (48 and 72 h) of GBMs in daphnia under standardized OECD TG 202, ISO 6341 and under modified tests. Chronic assays focused on reproductive capacity of D. magna(72) and C. dubia(73) and involves exposure to various concentrations of the test substance over a 7- or 21-day period. The test is performed in a static but renewable water system. Mortality rate of parents, time to produce initial brood, number of live offspring produced by exposed organisms (parents) are compared to those of control organisms to determine potential impact on reproduction. Less conventional end points are also considered, including physiological and oxidative stress parameters and sublethal end points such as heartbeat rate, feeding activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS)73,76 accumulation, oxidative stress and enzyme activities.74 Recent daphnid studies have included functionalized GO (0 to 50 mg/L, and some >140 mg/L) as extensively described in recent reviews75 with immobilization and mortality seen after 48 or 72 h of GO. GO from various suppliers exhibited EC50 48 h values that ranged from 21 mg/L using GO (0.5–3.0 μm)77 to 44.3 mg/L with GO (200–300 nm).74 Similar values of EC20 of 50 mg/L GO were established for mortality, while for physiological and behavioral end points, values ranged from 8.1 mg/L (feeding activity) to 14.8 mg/L (immobilization) ( ).76 Interestingly, functionalization of GO with carboxyl, imidazole, or poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) reduced acute toxicity.78 The authors used a GO modified by linking chloroacetic acid to the hydroxyl groups, imidazole to the carboxylic groups, or diaminotriethylene glycol to the epoxides.78 These moieties changed the chemical structure of GO and likely reduced the cytotoxic effects of the abundant oxygenated groups as GO contains a basal level of stabilized radicals responsible for triggering cellular toxicity; indeed, it is notable that GO may cause the depletion of glutathione (GSH), the main antioxidant molecule in the cell, thus evoking oxidative stress in cells.79,80 Moreover, if further functionalities are able accelerate the catalytic activity of the enzymes involved in the degradation of GO, then the degradation could also consequently be enhanced.26\n\nChanges in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) of Daphnia suggested elevated GO-mediated oxidative stress and damages.74 In a 21-day study, the mortality rate of Daphnia parents (F0 generation) increased,72 but another similar study reported no effect on daphnid survival with 1 mg/L of GO for F0 and F1 generations, with no effect on F0 reproduction.78\n\nOther invertebrates have been used, but to a lesser extent than daphnids. Oysters are also valued due to being filter feeders.81 They are particularly sensitive to changes in water quality and pollution levels. Moreover, they are easily cultured in laboratory settings. Among them, Crassostrea virginica (Eastern oysters) is valuable for nanotoxicity assessment thanks to their filtering capacities.82 As a bivalve, oysters have mechanisms for internalizing both nano- and microscale particles, such as endocytosis and phagocytosis, respectively.83 Few-layer GO (FLGO) can affect oyster health.84,85 After 72 h,85 oysters exposed to 10 mg/L of FLGO showed increased lipid peroxidation, indicating oxidative stress. Oysters exposed to 1 and 10 mg/L showed reduced total protein levels in digestive gland tissues. Epithelial inflammation was observed in gills as loss of mucous cells, hemocytic infiltration, and vacuolation. In a similar 14-day study on C. virginica, elevated lipid peroxidation, ROS induction and changes in glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in tissues of gills and digestive gland were reported with 2.5 and 5 mg/L of FLGO. A recent 24 h study on C. gigas (pacific oysters) demonstrated the paradoxical effects of various types of GO. GO (e.g., 0.2–8 μm and 30% oxygen content) at 0.1 mg/L was found to worsen copper-mediated embryo-larval toxicity while rGO (with similar dimensions to GO but with 16.8% oxygen content) comparatively mitigated the effects by way of decreasing copper bioavailability.86\n\nGSTThamnocephalus platyurus is also used as described in the standardized protocol ISO 14380 to determine lethal effects of toxicants after 24 h exposure. Heterocypris incongruens can also be used according to ISO 14371 for the determination of lethal and sublethal effects of contaminated sediments after 6 days of exposure.87 The results showed that the benthic crustacean H. incongruens was more resilient than the planktonic Thamnocephalus in the case of GO under different oxidation states from 0.39 mg/L to 25 mg/L as measured from viability tests. This difference in sensitivity was due to contrasting shell composition (robust calcified carapace for Heterocypris possesses versus outer shell of poly saccharide chitin for Thamnocephalus). Notably, acute toxicity was more pronounced with highly hydrophobic GO, allowing direct interaction with crustacean filtration apparatus and mechanical damage resulting in higher mortality.87\n\nThe common shrimp Palaemon pandaliformis has also been used in the 96 h acute toxicity assay to determine lethal concentrations of GO.88 Even if 5 mg/mL GO did not present acute ecotoxicity, interaction of GO with trace elements increased toxicity as seen from decreased lethal concentration LC50. It was suggested that coexposure of GO with trace elements impaired routine metabolism of P. pandaliformis. Hydra attenuate, Artemia salina, Chironomus sancticaroli, and Caenorhabditis elegans, primary or lower-level consumers, which are also used in ecotoxicology studies. Another study showed that GO induced no toxicity after 96 h at concentrations up to 100 mg/L in H. attenuate (mortality as end point), A. salina (body growth as end point), and C. elegans (recovery, fertility, reproduction, and growth).89 Similarly, weak toxic effects induced by GO up to 72 h exposure were noticed also in Artemia franciscana nauplii and adults. Mortality and activation of the xenobiotic detoxifying and antioxidant enzyme GST were observed only for the latter at the highest dose (100 mg/L).90 In addition, Chironomus larvae exposed to GO for 7 days did not exhibit any mortality or teratogenic effects despite reduction in final larvae length (from 4.4 to 10.1%), even at low concentrations of EC50 38.74 mg/L.91\n\nRegardless of invertebrate model organism, natural organic matter (NOM) can increase the toxicity of graphene-based nanoparticles to organisms by enhancing nanomaterial stability.72 Toxicity of GO was, however, lower with NOM, using mortality as the end point, decreasing from 111.4 mg/L to 84.3 mg/L in acute investigations and from 3.3 mg/L to 9.7 mg/L in the chronic one.72 Reproductive capacity end point as well as oxidative status followed the same pattern.72 Functional attachments such as carboxyl, imidazole, and PEG were also found to alleviate 48 h daphnid toxicity (immobilization) of GO in daphnid survival, growth, and reproduction.78\n\nWith regard to nongraphene 2D materials, results are similarly variable. Molybdate was found to have no effects on Daphnia acetylcholinesterase inhibition in vitro, but effects were observed in vivo at concentrations under the 48 h LC50 value of 2847.5 mg/L, also inhibiting reproduction and growth.92 Molybdenum toxicity in aquatic systems is highly dependent on the form of molybdenum salts and is also influenced by background water quality. The toxicity of common molybdate ions was reported as ammonium molybdate being the most toxic, followed by molybdenum trioxide, then hexavalent molybdate.93 Sodium tungstate was found to exhibit low toxicity in Daphnia and is not considered an aquatic toxicant94 although long-term exposure of tungsten carbide resulted in increased time to initial reproduction and, resuspended particles found to impact survival and reproduction.95 No data exist for hBN, to our knowledge, but boron alone was found to be the least toxic among 36 metals and metalloids in an ostracod Cypris subglobosa aquatic system.96 A recent study in Italy showed no ecological hazard effects of boron at concentrations detected in groundwaters, using Daphnia as an ecotoxicology readout.97 In contrast, a three-year study conducted in a Canadian oil end pit lake predicted that boron posed very high toxicological risk to aquatic organisms.98\n\n2D Material Impact on Vertebrates\n\nAmphibian models are important in ecotoxicology in the study of emerging contaminants such as nanomaterials. Toads, frogs, newts, and salamanders are of interest because of their potential to investigate the mechanisms of toxicity of pollutants on global health. In particular, due to their ability to easily breed and develop in captivity, measurement sensitivity and reproducibility as well as ease with which to conduct genomic analysis, Xenopus laevis, and the salamanders Pleurodeles waltl and Ambystoma mexicanum, have been used in ecotoxicology studies. Regardless of amphibian organism, intestinal absorption of carbon-based nanomaterials appears to be limited after oral administration, and the materials are quickly excreted. It has been demonstrated that growth inhibition observed in amphibians is due to physical blockage of the gills and/or digestive tract, limiting exchange surfaces between the gills and/or gut lumen and the internal wall, leading to a decrease in absorption of nutrients and/or gas, resulting in anoxia. The role of oxidation degree and surface functions of GO in toxicity was demonstrated in X. laevis by subjecting GO to thermal reduction at 200 and 1000 °C to produce rGO with different chemical surface functions.99−101 Using the standard ISO 21427-1 exposure of 12 days to 0.1 to 50 mg/L of GO and rGO, GO caused disruptions in the erythrocyte cell cycle, leading to cell accumulation in the G0/G1 phase. Low concentrations of GO (0.1 mg/L) induced genotoxicity in exposed larvae through oxidative stress. However, the reduction of GO eliminated genotoxicity at low concentrations. Some genes involved in oxidative stress response and inflammation were significantly overexpressed. However, some detoxification processes also occurred as supported by the induction of cyp1a1. On the contrary, no significant modulation of gene expression was noted with rGO. Surface analysis suggested that epoxide groups may be responsible for genotoxic effects of highly oxidized GO. The result obtained using the Xenopus model proposes that thermal reduction of GO could be a safer alternative for developing environmentally friendly materials.\n\nEndocrine disruption of the same GO and rGO using a triiodothyronine (T3)-induced Xenopus metamorphosis (adapted) assay was also investigated.102 Previously observed effects described in X. laevis tadpoles were associated with toxicity rather than to thyroid endocrine disruption. The results indicated that GO and rGO (after 96 h of exposure to increasing concentrations) potentiated the effects of exogenous T3 with a more marked effect of GO compared to rGO. T3 quantifications in the exposure media indicated adsorption of this hormone on GBMs, increasing its bioavailability because GO and rGO accumulated in the gut and the gills. GO and rGO did not disrupt the thyroid pathway in amphibians but that adsorption properties of these nanomaterials may increase the bioavailability and toxicity of other pollutants.103 The potential link between gut microbial communities and host physiological alterations induced by GO at low concentrations of up to 10 mg/L was also investigated ( ).101\n\nLarvae did not exhibit significant differences in intestinal weight compared to unexposed larvae after 2 days. However, after 12 days with GO at 10 mg/L, significant decrease in intestinal weight was observed, indicating impairment of intestinal development. No developmental stage delay was observed, but GO exposure led to a dose-dependent growth inhibition. Genotoxic effects observed at 0.1 mg/L were associated with gut microbiota remodelling characterized by an increase in the relative abundance of Bacteroides fragilis. Growth inhibitory effects was associated with a shift in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, while metagenome inference suggested changes in metabolic pathways and upregulation of detoxification processes. These findings implicate gut microbiota as an important biological compartment that should be considered in ecotoxicological studies, as structural or functional impairments could lead to host fitness loss. To date, very few studies focused on other 2D materials such as MoS2, WS2, or hBN. However, it has been reported that free boron present in tested boron-containing nanomaterials is beneficial for Xenopus tadpole metabolism.104\n\n2D Material Impact on Fish\n\nWith a projected increase in production volumes and uses of 2D materials, the risk of exposure of fish to these materials becomes a reality. The most studied material in this respect is GO,105,106 while limited studies on fish following exposure to TMDs (e.g., MoS2) are available ( ).107−109 According to the literature, no dose-dependent acute toxicity of GBMs in adult fish was reported.106 However, this must be interpreted with caution as standardized test guidelines for fish acute toxicity assessment (e.g., OECD TG 203) are not always followed.75\n\nTaking into consideration only the studies that have measured the actual exposure concentration maintained in the water column throughout the exposure period, the highest concentration of GBMs (in this case GO) tested using fish (zebrafish, Danio rerio) was 6.4 mg/L,111 which did not result in any fish mortalities, even following 14-day exposures. Due to instability of the tested material, testing of higher concentrations will likely require addition of appropriate protocols (e.g., agitation, use of dispersants, or renewals), which are currently under evaluation for their use in the applicability of OECD TG 203 for acute toxicity testing in fish for GO-based materials within the Graphene Flagship. This is likely to enable the generation of more reliable data on the acute toxicity of GBMs to fish and can be used also in testing other emerging 2D materials.\n\nInvestigations on a direct intraperitoneal injection, which is not representative of a natural exposure route, have provided LD50 values of 175.39 μg/g for males and 2,901.2 μg/g for females for GO in adult fish (e.g., Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes).112 The maximum body burden reported in fish (zebrafish, Danio rerio) following aqueous exposure to 50 μg/L GO for 2 days was 8 μg/g.113 However, it is likely that lethal concentrations were not reached explaining the lack of mortality. A similar zebrafish study on FLG showed maximum body burdens of 48 μg/g after 2 days with no acute toxicity (at 250 μg/L).114 Zebrafish can excrete materials during a depuration phase, albeit with different efficiencies according to material sizes (e.g., 30% and 95% for small and large sized FLG, respectively).114 However, more studies are needed to fully understand the toxicokinetics due to specific material properties that are not well understood due to a lack of quantitative techniques in fish tissues. With regards to the potential trophic transfer of GO, a body burden of 16 μg/g was reported in Daphnia fed with zebrafish-exposed GO. Much higher levels of GO accumulation were evidenced in lower trophic level aquatic organisms with low potential for biomagnification.113 Despite a lack of evidence of acute toxicity in fish to date, clear sublethal effects associated with GBM exposure in multiple species including zebrafish, Danio rerio,115−118 climbing perch, Anabas testudineus,119 common carp, Cyprinus carpio,110 geophagus, Geophagus iporangensis,120 and tilapia121 were reported, including pathological damage in tissues (e.g., liver, gills, intestine), metabolic disturbances, changes in oxidative stress parameters at enzymatic and genetic levels, inflammatory responses, effects on neurotransmission, as well as alterations in predator avoidance behavior. In addition, changes in the gut microbiota leading to a decrease in the abundance of beneficial bacteria and dysbiosis of bacterial community, was evidenced122 following chronic exposure (25 days) to GO at relatively high concentrations (0.05, 0.5, and 5 mg/L), and following a 7-day exposure to GO both at low and high doses (50 or 500 μg/L).123 The latter study also revealed that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) plays a significant role in modulating the gut microbiota composition in adult zebrafish.\n\nFish embryos, at a sensitive life stage, have also been used to assess developmental effects following GBM exposure.75 In particular, the zebrafish model bridges the gap between in vitro models and mammalian models.124 In fact, significant embryo mortality was evidenced following exposure to distinct GOs even at low concentrations of 0.001 mg/L125 with LC50 values of 63 mg/L reported for other tested GO materials.77 These models have also provided information on behavioral abnormalities and effects on neurotransmission caused by GBM exposure117,118 that require further investigation. Such fish embryo models have also been used to test MoS2 with hatching delays, malformations and oxidative stress evidenced at 5 mg/L,109 and mortalities in embryos exposed to aged materials (40 mg/L).108 This was attributed to the release of Mo ions during the oxidative-dissolution process of MoS2. Thus, attention must be drawn to potential transformation processes particularly for 2D materials such as MoS2 that may be susceptible to dissolution and O2 generation. Considering the increasing production volumes of 2D materials, more information is needed on the potential effects on aquatic organisms.126\n\nMore recently, the utility of fish cells in vitro as test systems has been promoted as a predictive tool in fish acute toxicity assessment as per the OECD TG 249 RTgill-W1 fish cell line assay,127 and their use is likely to expand in the future for testing GO.128 To date, fish cell lines such as the hepatoma cell line from the topminnow fish, PLHC-1,129 as well as the carp leukocyte cell line, CLC128 and bluegill sun fish Lepomis macrochirus BF-2 cell line130 have been used for testing GBMs with cytotoxicity reported at concentrations ≥40 mg/L and IC50 values of 122 mg/L for GO. Early studies provided evidence of uptake of GO in PLHC-1 and mechanistic information on the effects at the cellular level.129 A recent publication has evidenced a strong stimulation of the AhR-dependent cytochrome P4501A (Cyp1A) in rainbow trout liver cells (RTL-W1 cell line) after exposure to GO, providing clear evidence of a role of the AhR and Cyp1A system in the cellular metabolism of GO and that GO could modulate the toxicity of environmental pollutants.131 Subsequent studies have expanded the use of cells in vitro to primary cultures (e.g., hepatocytes isolated from rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss); however, GO was not taken up.132 The authors attributed this to differences in culture conditions, highlighting the requirement for harmonized test protocols. Indeed, efforts are needed to develop or adapt standardized test protocols for nanomaterials including 2D materials, and this issue is addressed in further detail in the section Regulatory Perspectives on 2D Materials.\n\nImpact on Cyanobacteria and Algae\n\nPhotoautotrophic organisms are at the base of trophic webs, being a major source of oxygen and organic matter in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, and for this reason, particular attention was paid to verify the potential adverse effects of 2D nanomaterials. Freshwater cyanobacteria, unicellular green algae, and diatoms have received most attention because they are the target organisms of standard guidelines (e.g., OECD), used to test the potential effects of chemicals on the aquatic environment. From the initial work addressing the environmental hazards of GBMs,133 attention was gradually narrowed down to GO as it is considered the most toxic GBM due to its reactivity and (relative) stability in aqueous suspensions. To predict the effects of GBMs under conditions more similar to those in the natural environment, the copresence of GBMs and other natural or anthropogenic substances and contaminants was verified and tested. 2D nanomaterials alternative to GBMs have also been considered. Recent literature on cyanobacteria and freshwater microalgae confirms previous findings133,75 on the effects of GBMs, particularly GO at concentrations of 5 to >50 mg/L. The effects include induction of oxidative stress due to internalization of the flakes into the cell,134 physical damage to cell membranes due to the extreme hardness and low thickness of flakes,135,87 and shading due to agglomeration of 2D nanomaterial particles with the cells,136,137 although agglomeration is not a toxicity mechanism. Despite the large consensus on these effects, they were not always confirmed even when similar GO concentrations were applied.138,139 These differences could be due to different exposure modalities or physiological characteristics of the target organisms. Because of the latter factor, effects may vary. For example, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Microcystis aeruginosa, and Cyclotella sp. were less susceptible to exposure to GO at 10 mg/L than Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus.136 The authors suggested that the lower susceptibility depended on the ability of the species to move in the water column conferred by flagella (C. reinhardtii) or buoyancy organelles (M. aeruginosa and Cyclotella sp.), which attenuate the shading effect due to GO agglomeration. In addition, cell wall composition136,140 and cell wall thickness138 can significantly affect the chances of direct physical damage as well as internalization of small flakes. Trophic lifestyle can also influence GBM toxicity. Some unicellular green algae can pass from an autotrophic to a heterotrophic lifestyle depending on the environmental conditions. It was shown that the green alga Euglena gracilis was more susceptible to GO-induced oxidative stress when it grew under photoautotrophic conditions than when it grew under heterotrophic conditions.135 The authors also found size-dependent effects insofar as nanosized GO was internalized by cells via endocytic activity/piercing, whereas micron-sized GO attached to the cell surface but did not enter the cells ( ).\n\nThe conditions in nature are much more complex than those adopted in the laboratory using test guidelines or well-established protocols. Freshwater environments can be potentially rich in dissolved and suspended NOM. The use of these substances is rarely considered, or even discouraged, in test guidelines for testing the toxicity of substances to algae. However, studies using standard humic acids (HA) to simulate the presence of NOM in water found that HA consistently mitigated the toxic effects of GO,72,141,142 amine- and carboxy-functionalized GO,142 rGO,141 and graphene141 on various species of freshwater green algae, such as Chlorella pyrenoidosa,141 and S. obliquus.72 These studies revealed that the mechanism underlying the mitigation effect involves decreased ROS production and mechanical damage by GBM flakes, which is due to a decreased interaction between the organisms and the materials. HA can be adsorbed on the surface of GBMs, which could alter the surface charge of the material. Moreover, HA significantly increased micronutrients availability, particularly Mg and P, with promoted algal growth.141 In addition to natural substances, freshwater environments can be also contaminated by substances or nanoparticles of anthropogenic origin. Mitigation of the toxic effects was observed when C. reinhardtii algae were simultaneously exposed to GO and wastewater containing antibiotics, derived metabolites, and sweeteners143 in the concentration range of ng/L or μg/L. Compared with exposure to GO or wastewater, the production of ROS and membrane peroxidation were significantly decreased. In this case, adsorption of contaminants on the surface of GO as well as enhanced aggregation of GO were considered to be the main factors causing an antagonistic effect leading to toxicity mitigation.144 Mixture effects (coexposure to more than one toxicant) should also be considered. Chlorella pyrenoidosa and S. obliquus were exposed to mixtures of nano-ZrO2 particles and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) or rGO,145 or Zn-NPs and GO,77 respectively. The mixtures almost always had a stronger toxic effect than the individual particles, which was mainly due to increased oxidative stress via the accumulation of ROS. Only rGO was more toxic than the mixture with nano-ZrO2.145\n\nThe interaction of 2D materials with multiple organisms simultaneously (e.g., reconstructed fractions of trophic webs) has been rarely investigated but could be useful in predicting the consequences of the effects observed in individual species at a larger organization scale. With respect to freshwater algae, a biofilm of the diatom Nitzschia palea and a bacterial community were exposed to suspensions of GO and rGO.102 Interestingly, the materials had a different effect on the alga in respect to the bacterial community, and algal growth was not negatively affected by the materials. The bacterial community suffered from strong growth inhibition by GO, and to a lesser extent, by rGO. Furthermore, the bacterial community structure was altered only by GO at a concentration of 10 mg/L, with a significant decrease in Protobacteria and increase in Bacteroidota, which constituted more than 99% of the bacterial community. The authors suggested that extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by the diatom and forming the biofilms could change the interaction modalities of the materials with the organisms. Another study in Nostoc flagelliforme found that GO, graphene and two types of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) altered monosaccharide compositions and functional groups of exosaccharides, and improved cellular superoxide dismutase and catalase activities.146\n\nThe study of the potential impacts of 2D materials on freshwater algae has also been extended to TMDs. MoS2 tested on C. vulgaris at 1 mg/L resulted as toxic, as it inhibited its growth by causing a decrease in chlorophyll a content and an increase in oxidative stress and membrane damage.147 However, in a more recent study, the same authors showed that the two phases of MoS2 (i.e., 1T-MoS2 and 2H-MoS2) had different toxicities to the algae, with the former being more toxic than the latter.148 Similar results were obtained for WS2.149,150 The metallic phase is characterized by a higher electron conductivity and a higher electron separation efficiency leading to a higher ability to generate oxygen radicals when irradiated with visible light.149 Similar to GBMs, the size of MoS2 also matters: single-layer MoS2 with maximum dimensions in the range of nanometres were less toxic than those in the micrometres because they degraded more rapidly in the growth medium with algae.148 Another factor affecting the toxicity of MoS2 was the presence of S vacancies in the lattice, which can be engineered or result from dissolution and biodegradation processes.151 It has been demonstrated that the presence of S vacancies in single-layer 2H-MoS2 increases the toxicity of the material to algae, as it could harvest proteins with a high content of thiol groups, such as those involved in the antioxidant machinery, the photosynthetic apparatus, and the cytoskeleton.152 Again, toxicity of MoS2 may be influenced by compounds naturally present in the environment. Similar to GBMs, HA could mitigate the toxic effects of MoS2, while natural nanocolloids and EPS could enhance its toxicity, although all natural compounds increase photodegradation of the material upon irradiation with visible light.153,154 Importantly, there was no toxicity of the degradation byproducts of MoS2, such as MoO42–.154 These results show that these emerging 2D materials can have similar toxic effects on algae as carbon-based materials, but they also reveal different mechanisms resulting from their different chemical composition and consequent behavior in the environment. Importantly, they also show that the potential effects of 2D materials in freshwater environments could be very different from those reported using standard test guidelines such as OECD TG 201, for ecotoxicity testing on algae.\n\n2D Material Impact on Plant Reproduction\n\nThe effects of 2D materials on photoautotrophs have also been studied in seed plants, mainly using GO, although a few studies have explored TMDs. The results are largely consistent with those of previous studies3,133 although different life stages, exposure modalities, and concentration ranges were used. The effects of 2D materials on seed germination and seedling development have often been tested using simple standard protocols. At the highest GO concentrations tested, (i.e., 2000 mg/L and 10 mg/L) reduced germination rate and increased frequency of mitotic events and DNA aberrations in seedling meristems were observed in wheat (Triticum aestivum)155 and rice (Oryza sativa).156 Root development also appeared to be negatively affected by certain GBMs. GO (10 mg/L) negatively affected root growth of O. sativa,156 and resulted in ion loss and oxidative imbalance, possibly due to an endocytosis process of GO, in roots of pea seedlings (Pisum sativum) treated with 13C-labeled GO up to 2000 mg/L.157 The interaction between GO and plant roots was also studied158 by growing wheat seedlings over sponges impregnated with GO dispersions (10 to 800 mg/L). GO flakes were observed in the vacuoles of the cells of the root tip, meristem, and elongation zone. Notably, GO was associated with a decrease in nitrate content in shoots and especially in roots. These results are consistent with apple (Malus domestica) plants in GO-enriched medium, where GO at the highest concentration of 10 mg/L inhibited lateral root formation and reduced adventitious root elongation. Expression of genes related to lateral root and root hair formation and auxin response were stimulated at 0.1 mg/L and inhibited at 10 mg/L.159 It is difficult to envision that the root system of a plant is exposed only to 2D materials without being coexposed to other organic and inorganic xenobiotics. Several studies have investigated the adverse effects on plants of GO in combination with cadmium, a known phytotoxic element. One study highlighted an increased cellular oxidative imbalance due to higher influx of Cd2+ into the roots, whereas GO alone showed very low toxicity at concentrations higher than 10 mg/L.160 The GO-enhanced influx of Cd2+ into the plant has also been observed in other studies with different species (e.g., rice seeds and duckweed Lemna turionifera), GO types, and concentrations.160−162 Interestingly, all these studies showed increased membrane permeability at the root level when GO and Cd2+ were present simultaneously. In contrast, another study163 showed that GO at concentrations up to 200 mg/L did not increase Cd2+ influx at the root level in rice seedlings, whereas at 400 mg/L it could inhibit influx, likely depending on downregulation of genes encoding Cd2+ plasma membrane transporters.158,163 The different results seem to depend on the GO, which was at least three times thicker than that used in previous studies.\n\nPassive translocation from roots to leaves through the vascular tissue (xylem) of seed plants is a known process.164 Recently, translocation of rGO to leaves was observed in seedlings of P. sativum where gradual inhibition of photosynthesis occurred with increasing rGO concentration.157 A decrease in chlorophyll a content of wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves was also observed in plants cultured with GO suspensions at 2000 mg/L.155 Simultaneous exposure to 2D materials and other potentially toxic elements may lead to enhanced adverse effects. For instance, decreased efficiency of photosystem II and decreased levels of chlorophylls, carotenoids, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, with a subsequent decrease of net photosynthesis, was observed in wheat seedlings exposed to GO at 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/L enriched with Cd2+.160 TMDs were also tested for their potential effects on plants. Six-day-old seeds were nebulized with MoS2.165 Seed germination was not affected by MoS2, while seedlings showed a concentration-dependent increase in root and shoot growth, chlorophyll content in leaves, and overexpression of a gene encoding an aquaporin in roots. MoS2 was also found in leaves. Potential effects of WS2 were tested on rice seedlings by exposing them to soil enriched with nanomaterial at different concentrations (10 and 100 mg/kg).150 The highest affected root development and induced an oxidative imbalance that caused membrane peroxidation and reduced overall antioxidant capacity of the seedlings. WS2 also altered the chemical and bacterial microflora of the soil, lowering soil pH and increasing the bioavailability of extractable phosphorus and micronutrients such as Cu, Fe, and Zn.\n\nThe study on potential effects of 2D materials has been extended to sexual reproduction. This biological process is of central importance to most terrestrial ecosystems, but also to human society, as the yield of crops, largely consisting of fruits, seeds, and their derivatives, is fully dependent on it. This process takes place in flowers and is controlled by the interaction between the pollen and the pistil. The effects of FLG, GO, and rGO on pollen of hazel (Corylus avellana, anemophilous) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum, entomophilous) plants were studied.166 Pollen was exposed to increasing GBM dispersions and pollen germination and pollen tube elongation were evaluated. GO had a dose-dependent negative effect on pollen performance, mainly due to its acidic properties. GO also adsorbed Ca2+ from the germination medium, which further affected pollen performance. FLG caused only reduced pollen germination, while rGO had no effect, possibly due to the very limited dispersibility of this GBM in aqueous media.\n\nThe success of sexual plant reproduction relies on several key events. One of them is the correct interaction between pollen and stigma (i.e., the surface at the tip of the pistil that provides optimal conditions for pollen germination). The potential effects of GBMs deposited on the stigma surface was verified by treating the stigma of female flowers of squash marrow (Cucurbita pepo) with FLG, GO, and pGO (a GO purified from production process residues), and muscovite (MICA), a naturally occurring nanoparticle.167,168 All GBMs and MICA reduced pollen adhesion to the stigma and pollen germination without significantly affecting stigma integrity,167 suggesting that GBMs are as hazardous to the pollen-stigma system as nanoparticles commonly found in soil dust. However, both GO and pGO also affected fruits developed from treated flowers,167 although the concentrations tested were too high to be realistic. This negative effect was therefore further verified on C. pepo flowers using an exposure method that allowed obtaining dry air depositions of GO and pGO in the same range as daily depositions of particulate matter in highly polluted environments (5.5–22 ng/mm2) ( ).169\n\nNeither material affected the pollen-stigma system nor fruit development. However, deposition of GO significantly reduced the density and germination of seeds developed from treated flowers. Elemental analysis of GO and pGO dispersions revealed that GO contained high levels of residues from the production process that are potentially phytotoxic, especially Mn. This suggests that the impairment of seed formation may be due to the GO-enhanced influx of production residues, with subsequent damage at the cellular level, as discussed previously.\n\nBased on the assumption that GBMs can be dispersed in the air due to their low weight and geometry, wind-pollinated plants would be most affected by airborne GBMs. This is because female flowers are morphologically adapted to intercept airborne pollen and, indirectly, other particles. Moreover, wind-pollinated flowers can remain exposed to the air for days or even weeks without losing their full receptivity. For these reasons, the uptake of GO and pGO from the air by flowers of wind-pollinated plants and if it could affect their sexual reproduction.170 The authors exposed female flowers of hazel, holm oak (Quercus ilex), walnut (Juglans regia), and maize (Zea mais) to air with a GBM concentration of 3.7 ng/m3 in a simulated gravity deposition. The stigma surfaces of all species were able to capture and retain the flakes. The presence of GO or pGO reduced pollen adhesion only in the flowers of Q. ilex and J. regia. In all cases, no damage to the stigma surface or reduction in pollen germination was observed, even when stigmas were wetted.\n\nThe aforementioned work on the potential effects of GBMs on seed plant sexual reproduction highlights an unexplored area of environmental impact of nanomaterials and demonstrates that GO could have adverse effects at environmentally relevant concentrations. Considering that these impacts are most likely from GO production residues, mitigation strategies could be adopted, such as applying a safe by design approach that includes increased efforts to produce cleaner materials. Regarding the more general effects of 2D materials on plants, it should be noted that most of the adverse effects stem from exposure to GBMs at very high concentrations. These are unlikely to occur under real-world conditions when predictive models171 and recent results on GBM biodegradability are considered (see next section). Therefore, GBMs will be safe for plants at expected emission levels, although more data need to be collected on the process of sexual reproduction and on testing 2D materials alternative to GBMs.\n\nFungal and Bacterial Degradation of 2D Materials\n\nThe biodegradability of engineered (nano) materials is central to predict environmental fate, regardless of voluntary release172 during their life cycle. Some 2D materials are indeed resistant and reactive and could be harmful to biota, as in the case of some GOs and rGOs.133 Thus, understanding the extent of biodegradability, and how 2D materials and their byproducts interact with biota can help predict short- and long-term impacts and propose mitigation strategies. Biodegradation of 2D materials in mammalian systems is discussed under “Biotransformation of 2D Materials”.\n\nPrimary decomposers such as fungi and bacteria break down organic material releasing complex mixtures of oxidizing enzymes and molecules. The mixtures released by wood-degrading fungi, such as white rot fungi, are even capable of degrading lignin, one of nature’s most complex and recalcitrant molecules, as well as persistent pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and dioxins.173 Fungi are considered the most effective decomposers because their mycelia can penetrate substrates and degrade them from the inside out.174 The biodegradability of 2D materials has been studied in vivo, using fungal cultures. rGO was incubated in cultures of the white rot fungus P. chrysosporium for up to 28 days.175 The authors used a culture medium that stimulated the production of Mn-peroxidase (MnP) but not lignin peroxidase (LiP), and characterized enzyme activity. After incubation, rGO was enriched in oxygen and the flakes had a statistically significant higher amounts of defects as well as holes in the graphene lattice. Both MnP and laccase were active during the incubation period, suggesting that the fungus was able to oxidize graphene by enzyme-generated radicals. More recently, FLG was incubated for four months in liquid cultures of two white-rot fungi, basidiomycetes P. chrysosporium and Bjerkandera adusta, and one saprotrophic fungus, the ascomycete Morchella esculenta.176 The two white rot fungi produce LiP, laccase and other enzymes, while the ascomycete does not produce LiP. FLG was found to be oxidized to a GO-like material. The results were fully compatible with environmental conditions created by the fungi during incubation: fungi acidified the medium to levels optimal for activity of the degradative enzymes and released H2O2, the main substrate of the degradative enzymes. Importantly, this work showed that the ascomycete was also capable of oxidizing FLG, albeit to a lesser extent than the other two fungi. The authors concluded that laccases, which are released by bacteria, fungi, and plants, may play an important role in FLG oxidation. In a recent study, the same authors exposed GO to liquid cultures of P. chrysosporium. Raman spectroscopy characterization of GO flakes after 1, 2, and 4 months of incubation showed a consistent increase of oxidation of the graphene lattice. Interestingly, LiP (but not laccases) was inactive during incubation in all cultures enriched with GO. This result was verified by incubating GO with LiP according to a previously developed in vitro approach.177 Both the lack of accumulation of byproducts and the absence of graphene lattice oxidation alluded to possible inactivation of LiP by GO by nonspecific adsorption. Conversely, there was evident GO-degradative activity and signs of GO oxidation with laccase.178\n\nThe role of bacteria in biodegradation processes of 2D materials has also been investigated. GO was incubated for 20 days in liquid cultures of a bacterial strain of Labrys sp., selected for its ability to use graphitic materials as its sole carbon source for nutrition.179 GO gradually lost oxygen functional groups, and holes were observed in the graphene lattice. The authors concluded that degradation was due to reductive processes caused by the bacteria. Importantly, the degradation products were characterized as aromatic compounds with the structure of benzoic acids and phenols. Gene expression analysis revealed that 644 genes were up- or down-regulated in the bacterial culture incubated with GO. Most of these genes coded for proteins that were components of specific pathways for benzoate, naphthalene, caprolactam, and xylene degradation, as well as pathways leading to oxidative reactions and carbon ring cleavage. In addition, bacteria from the gut microbiome of detritivores have been implicated in the biodegradation of 2D materials. Larvae of the insect Tenebrio molitor (mealworm) were put in contact with a 1.5 × 1.5 mm GO film deposited on the bottom of the growth vessels.180 After 15 days, the larvae had consumed the GO film, and residues of GO with holes, defects and higher oxygen content were found in their feces. Remnants of GO were still present in the larval gut. The main cause of GO degradation was the gut microbiome, as shown by incubating GO with larval homogenates. The authors demonstrated the presence of degradation products such as 5-formyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and 2-(naphthalene-1-ylmethylene)-succinic acid.\n\nThus, evidence to date suggests that GBMs, regardless of their physicochemical properties such as C/O ratio and shape, can slowly be degraded by different microorganisms sharing similar degradative mechanisms/pathways, as well as by detritivores (indirectly via the microbiome). This likely precludes long-term accumulation of GBMs in the environment by accidental or direct release of graphene-containing compounds at least at the amounts predicted so far.171 However, nothing is known about the effects and fate of the degradation products of GBMs in the environment.133,3 GBMs could also interact with organic matter (e.g., humic substances) to form a so-called eco-corona, which can alter surface reactivity of the materials toward organisms. In this context, a recent study on the 2D material MoS2 showed that EPS released by algae promoted the formation of sulfur vacancies and pores in the MoS2 lattice under simulated visible-light irradiation.154 Compared to pristine MoS2, MoS2 with a “corona” of EPS exhibited stronger developmental inhibition and photosynthetic toxicity on the microalgae, Chlorella vulgaris.\n\nHuman Health Impact of 2D Materials\n\nGiven the potentially wide-range effects of 2D materials on human health,3,181 a detailed assessment of the impact on key target organs in the body following oral, dermal, inhalation, or parenteral exposure is required. displays the different types of 2D materials (i.e., GO, rGO, FLG, graphene, MoS2, hBN, MXene, and black phosphorus) and the organs and the biological barriers that they can target or encounter in a living body, described in this section, together with their possible effects. Here, we discuss the findings related to the skin, the lungs, the immune system, the gastro-intestinal tract, the liver, spleen, and kidneys, the cardiovascular system, the reproductive and developmental systems, and the central nervous system. Our previous review3 focused on GBMs, while the present discussion provides an update on GBMs as well as other 2D materials, including TMDs and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), with emphasis on results published during the past 5 years.\n\nImpact on the Skin\n\nSafety issues of 2D materials for human health are mainly associated with occupational exposure during manufacturing, and cutaneous contact is certainly one of the most important exposure routes.182 In addition, technological applications implying skin contact are already available for some GBMs, e.g., skin-mountable biosensors and for skin regeneration purposes.183 Beyond GBMs, several other 2D materials are currently being explored such as TMDs (MoS2 and WS2), MXenes, and black phosphorus. These materials can be incorporated into skin-mountable devices, such as tactile and touch sensors, electrophysiological and/or electrochemical sensors, implantable biosensors, and advanced displays to improve their performance.184 Moreover, the application of 2D materials in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine has been gradually developed, including at the skin level.185 Overall, cutaneous contact is probably the most underestimated exposure route, both with respect to occupational and/or voluntary (wearable and implantable devices) scenarios.183 For GBMs, a good knowledge has been gained regarding their safety at the skin level.3 However, there is currently a paucity of data for other 2D materials, limited to hBN, MoS2, and black phosphorus.\n\nGraphene-Based Materials\n\nGBMs have been extensively studied with respect to skin effects in the frame of the Graphene Flagship using mainly in vitro model systems of the human skin.3 However, few in vivo data on skin adverse outcomes induced by GBMs are currently available. Recently, two independent studies investigated the skin sensitization potential of GNPs,186 as well as FLG and GO,187 following the OECD TG 442B. The initial study applied a protocol using female BALB/C mice exposed to GNPs for three consecutive days. The stimulation index (SI) value, below the threshold predicting skin sensitization, suggested GNPs as a nonsensitizer material.186 The second study adopted a protocol using female CBA/JN mice exposed to FLG (average size: 171 nm) or GO (average size: 15 μm) for three consecutive days. SI values for FLG and GO were also below the skin sensitization threshold. In addition, both FLG and GO induced no signs of skin irritation and inflammation, despite their capability to slightly penetrate epidermis or dermis.187 The lack of skin irritation and sensitization properties was corroborated also by in vitro studies. In particular, the irritation potential of a panel of GBMs [FLG exfoliated with melamine, FLG exfoliated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), FLG exfoliated with sodium dodecyl-benzenesulfonate (SDBS), chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-graphene films, GO, and rGO] was assessed following the OECD TG 439, using SkinEthicTM (reconstructed human epidermis) as a fully differentiated three-dimensional epidermal tissue constituted of normal keratinocytes. Among the tested GBMs, only FLG exfoliated with SDS (average size: 917 nm) or SDBS (average size: 1097 nm) resulted as irritants. However, the effects were ascribed to the high amounts of residual surfactants in the final materials rather than to the materials themselves. Indeed, after removal of the residues by repeated washings, the same materials resulted as nonirritant, similar to FLG exfoliated with melamine. On the whole, these results demonstrated that GBMs exfoliated with nontoxic agents, or those from which toxic agents had been fully removed, can be viewed as nonirritant. Notwithstanding, for FLG, GO, and rGO, histological analysis revealed the presence of small depots within the epidermis, especially in the stratum corneum, suggesting the possibility of GBMs to penetrate the outer skin layers ( ).188\n\nThis observation was confirmed using human skin samples (thickness: 0.8 mm, from one healthy donor) and Franz diffusion cells: GO (average size: 197.6 nm; concentration range: 300–1000 μg/mL) permeated the skin in a time-dependent manner, with about 55% of the total GO permeating within 6 h exposure.189 Regarding skin sensitization, GNPs (<2 μm) were tested following the OECD TG 442D.186 The procedure evaluates the ability to activate keratinocytes in vitro as the second key phase of skin sensitization adverse outcome pathway (AOP). Using the KeratinoSensTM model of human skin and measuring the induction of a stably transfected luciferase gene under the control of the antioxidant response element, no sensitization potential was recorded for GNPs.186 These results confirmed the conclusions obtained in the in vivo studies demonstrating that GNPs are not skin sensitizers. In support of this, a recent study using an in vitro 3D reconstructed human epidermis model based on OECD TG 439 attributed skin irritation to added surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and not GBMs such as rGO and GNPs.190 The same study also excluded skin corrosive properties for a wide range of GBMs (including FLG, GO, rGO, and GNPs) by applying the OECD TG 431.190\n\nBeyond the evaluation of skin irritation, corrosion and sensitization properties of GBMs, the majority of the in vitro studies to define the mechanisms of acute toxicity in the Graphene Flagship were carried out on keratinocytes or fibroblasts. Studies on HaCaT skin keratinocytes revealed that the highest oxidized materials, as GO, were the most cytotoxic ones. However, cytotoxicity only manifested after long exposure (48–72 h) and with high concentrations of GBMs (>10 μg/mL).191 GBM internalized by cells could continuously trigger adverse effects that were partially reversible, even if with low potency.192 Both FLG (average size: 391 nm) and GO (average size: 979 nm) induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and ROS production in multiple studies, and evidence was provided for a selective activation of NADH dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase193−195 and free cytosolic calcium in skin keratinocytes, with a consequent rearrangement of their metabolome of the cells.194 Effects were higher for GO as compared to FLG, probably because of relatively high amounts of oxygen-containing functional groups.193,194 As a possible consequence of oxidative stress induction, further evidence demonstrated that GBMs can trigger a pro-inflammatory response in keratinocytes. Indeed, HaCaT cells exposed to subcytotoxic concentrations (0.01–1.0 μg/mL) of FLG (average size: 413.8 nm) or thermally dehydrated GO (average size: 979 nm) released significant amounts of IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α. However, conditioned media collected from GBM-treated keratinocytes failed to influence monocyte differentiation and migration, supporting the lack of sensitization potential.196 Other recent studies have evaluated the long-term effects of some GBMs. Remodeling of the metabolome was evidenced in keratinocytes exposed for 1 week to subcytotoxic concentrations (5 μg/mL) of FLG (average size: 40 nm), showing alterations in cellular energetic metabolism along with alterations in Ca2+ ions and redox homeostasis.197 Furthermore, metabolic remodeling was also observed after 30-day exposure to FLG (average size: 0.3 μm) or GO (average size: 2.17 μm) in epithelial cells, with increased levels of tricarboxylic acids.198 In addition, the oxidation degree of graphene was found to determine genotoxic effects following subchronic exposure. Genotoxic effects in HaCaT cells were reversible up to 30 days with induction of DNA repair that was implicated in tumor transformation, but the effects were irreversible following a 3-month exposure.199 Thus, subchronic exposure is a less studied but important exposure scenario that should be considered in genotoxicity studies.\n\nOn the whole, robust data obtained in different studies carried out applying specific OECD TGs (see section Regulatory Perspectives on 2D Materials) confirm that GBMs do not display skin irritation, corrosion and sensitization properties, at least when they are prepared using nontoxic exfoliating agents or when toxic agents are fully removed from the final material. Additionally, in vitro data confirmed low cytotoxic potential for the majority of GBMs, but the ability of FLG and GO to induce mitochondrial damage, ROS production, metabolic alterations and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines raises some concern regarding their (long-term) safety at the skin level.\n\nHexagonal Boron Nitride\n\nToxicity studies on the effects of hBN at the skin level are still scanty. In particular, no in vivo studies evaluating the cutaneous effects of this material have been reported so far. However, in 2015 the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel published a safety assessment of boron nitrides used in cosmetics as a slip modifier,200 hBN was reported not to be an irritant (using 50% hBN in olive oil on 20 participants). Similarly, two eye shadow formulations and a face powder formulation containing 13–18% of hBN were nonirritant and nonsensitizing for the skin. However, all these results were supported only by unpublished data given by the Personal Care Products Council, without any detailed experimental information, including physicochemical properties of the tested materials.200 Early in vitro work on hBN, carried out on human skin fibroblasts (CCD-1094Sk) exposed to hBN (lateral size: 50–190 nm), showed no cytotoxic effects up to 100 μg/mL, with a slight cytotoxic effect observed only at the highest concentration tested (400 μg/mL).201 This observation was subsequently confirmed on human dermal fibroblasts, which showed a concentration-dependent reduction of cell viability by a similar hBN (50–70 nm).202 The results suggested a weak cytotoxic potential, in line with the effects observed in keratinocytes. Indeed, hBN induced only a slight cytotoxicity in HaCaT cells after exposure up to a concentration of about 85 μg/mL. Unfortunately, no quantitative data about hBN size and thickness were provided.203 Overall, the few available in vitro studies suggest a weak cytotoxic potential of hBN. However, further studies are needed.\n\nMolybdenum Disulfide\n\nConcerning TMDs, only a few studies aimed to assess the toxic effects of MoS2 at the skin level are available. The only in vivo study evaluated the cutaneous effects of a MoS2 thin film (prepared via direct sulfurization of deposited Mo film on quartz plates) and MoS2 microparticles (not characterized) on female guinea pigs using a patch covering shaved skin up to 48 h exposure. No clinical sign of erythema, edema or ulcers were observed, suggesting very low skin toxicity for these forms of MoS2.204 However, a previous study on human dermal fibroblasts showed that 72 h exposure to chitosan-functionalized MoS2 nanosheets reduced cell viability, inducing cell membrane damage, ROS generation, DNA alteration, apoptosis, inflammation and altered cell metabolism.205 Similar alterations (loss of cell membrane integrity, oxidative stress, damages of nuclei) were seen in HaCaT keratinocytes exposed to MoS2 (hydrodynamic diameter: 602 nm) and its derivative counterpart that contained surface defects (hydrodynamic diameter: 713 nm). Cells were exposed to each material (0.2, 1.0, 5.0, and 25.0 μg/mL) under different conditions, i.e., short-term exposure for 24 h, and long-term exposure mimicking an occupational scenario (daily cell exposure for 5 days, 8 h per day, followed by 16 h culture in fresh media, followed by 2 days’ recovery without MoS2 materials). Structural defects in MoS2 were found to enhance cellular internalization and augment oxidative stress after 5 days. In addition, the 2-day recovery following the long-term exposure allowed only slight improvement of cell viability.206 Despite the test on guinea pigs not showing signs of skin toxicity, the data remain insufficient to draw conclusions on cutaneous hazards of MoS2.\n\nBlack Phosphorus\n\nOther postgraphene materials such as black phosphorus (BP) have also been considered for biomedical applications implying skin contact. For instance, washable skin-touch-actuated BP-based “nanogenerators” embedded in textiles were developed for harvesting mechanical energy from body movements.207 Additionally, silver-laden BP nanosheets were prepared for antibacterial applications.208 In a recent study, BP nanosheets functionalized with antibacterial peptides (lateral dimension estimated to be about 575 and 512 nm for BP alone and BP modified with antibacterial peptides, respectively) displayed in vivo antibacterial activity with >99% antibacterial effectivity in a mouse model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin infection, accompanied by negligible toxicity.209 However, specific evaluation of potential skin effects of BP sheets is lacking.\n\nIn sum, whereas GBMs do not show skin irritation, corrosion and sensitization, skin toxicity data on other 2D materials has been insufficient to draw firm conclusions as physicochemical properties such as oxidation state can vary, which may greatly influence the toxicity. Given that the skin is the most underestimated exposure route, caution should be taken, especially in the occupational setting. In addition, subchronic exposure has been highlighted as an often-neglected time-point.\n\nImpact on the Immune System\n\nThe immune system is commonly divided into the innate and adaptive arm.210 Innate immune cells comprise monocytes and macrophages, as well as mast cells, and granulocytes such as basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils. Dendritic cells (DCs) serve as a bridge between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Adaptive immune cells comprise lymphocytes that are classified as T and B cells, which themselves are subdivided into multiple phenotypes based on surface receptors and functions ( ). Professional phagocytic innate immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and DCs are what foreign materials initially encounter upon contact with a physiological barrier such as the skin, or the gut or lung epithelium, depending on the route of exposure. These innate immune cells are also important in tackling pathogens or apoptotic debris.211 We have previously reviewed the interactions between GBMs and the immune system.3 We also emphasized the importance of addressing potential endotoxin contamination as endotoxins, derived from Gram-negative bacteria, can have unexpected impacts on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-responsive pathways such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and downstream inflammatory cytokine production.212 It is therefore crucial to ensure that nanomaterials are free from endotoxin contamination to avoid the possibility of experimental results attributed to contamination and not to the test material.213\n\nIn this chapter, we discuss interactions between GBMs and other 2D materials and the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system, addressing various immune cell types. The in vivo impact of 2D materials (in rodent models) is covered in the subsequent organ-specific sections.\n\n2D Materials and Innate Immunity\n\nGraphene-Based Materials\n\nThe bulk of experimental studies of GBMs published in recent years have focused on GO, which is a hydrophilic material, while some studies have also addressed graphene. Graphene was found to increase ROS production in unpolarized macrophages and increased oxygen consumption rate in unpolarized and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, with macrophages that take up graphene remaining viable.214 Moreover, graphene physical structure can affect macrophage responses.214 GNPs triggered expression of anti-inflammatory genes such as ARG1, PTGS2, and CYBB in anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages.214 FLG was found to increase autophagic flux and expression of the lysosomal genes ATG5, CTSB, and CTSL in primary human macrophages, but were not cytotoxic despite cellular uptake. FLG also increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines and ROS in M1 macrophages.215 However, another study in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages showed no inflammatory effect of graphene despite cell internalization.216 FLG was found to trigger so-called trained immunity of bone marrow-derived macrophages with increased IL-6 and TNF-α production, but this effect was negated by incorporation of graphene within a collagen matrix.217 Trained immunity is a phenomenon where innate cells such as monocytes or macrophages are programmed to produce an augmented nonspecific response upon subsequent challenge with microbial products.218 These in vitro data thus suggest that GBMs could exert long-term immune-modulatory effects in the absence of cytotoxicity.\n\nRecent transcriptomics studies in the Graphene Flagship showed that GNPs mainly upregulated inflammatory and apoptotic genes in human macrophages whereas GO showed only limited inflammatory impact. The authors also highlighted that primary macrophages are more sensitive to GBMs when compared to the macrophage-like THP-1 cell line ( ).219\n\nGO and rGO were found to have no toxicity or effect on the inflammatory cytokine IL-8 in THP-1 macrophages.220 Cytokine arrays performed on human whole blood showed that GO caused overexpression of mainly monocyte and macrophage-related cytokines such as IL-6, CXCL1, CCL20, TNF-α, and CCL3, while graphene produced similar results except for IL-6.221 Single-cell mass cytometry performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) confirmed the complex interaction of GO with many types of immune cells, and identified monocytes, a precursor of macrophages, as the main population impacted by GO, with amino functionalization dampening immune activation.222 GO can impact various cell response pathways. For example, GO was found to decrease antioxidant levels and increase expression of pro-apoptotic and DNA damage genes in THP-1 cells.223 Proteomics analysis of GO-treated RAW264.7 macrophages showed upregulation of lipoprotein lipase and lysozyme in particular, as well as increased ROS-induced autophagy. A dose-dependent increase in membrane rafts and phagosome production was observed.224 Furthermore, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release was observed in C57BL/6 mice and in RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to various carbonaceous nanomaterials (C60 fullerenes, SWCNTs, GO).225 Lipidomics analysis of macrophage-like THP-1 cells showed that GO reduced mRNA and proteins of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway, which is related to lipid droplet biogenesis, with larger GO (500–5000 nm) having greater effects than smaller GO (<500 nm), accompanied by decreases in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1).226 Graphene nanosheets have also been found to cause plasma membrane damage, ROS production and apoptosis in a rat basophilic cell line.227 It is important to note that the functionalization and/or reduction of GO can affect immune responses. For example, GO reduction decreased both oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines in RAW264.7 macrophages.228 Metabolomics of RAW264.7 macrophages confirmed that PEG-GO had minimal inflammatory potential based on decreased levels of the inflammatory metabolite succinate. PEG-GO also expressed low TNF, CD80, and CD206. These results were in contrast to flavin mononucleotide-stabilized graphene, demonstrating the different immunomodulatory abilities of various GBMs.229\n\nNeutrophils are innate immune cells that respond swiftly upon encountering foreign bodies and play key roles in inflammation and host defense. Previous work in the Graphene Flagship showed that GO triggers neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in a size-dependent manner in primary human neutrophils ( )230 and this was confirmed in a recent study, in which PEG-GO was found to provoke a milder response than its unmodified counterpart.231 NETs are believed to be important for antimicrobial defense, but excessive formation of NETs may also contribute to tissue damage in various diseases.232 In another recent study conducted in the Graphene Flagship, mice were subjected to repeated chronic pulmonary exposure to GO suspensions. The authors noted a transient influx of alveolar neutrophils and eosinophils with replacement of alveolar macrophages by interstitial macrophages, for GO of different lateral dimensions, without induction of lung remodeling or adaptive immune responses. Importantly, the latter study showed that lung recovery was faster for nanosized GO as compared to micron-sized GO.233\n\nGraphdiyne is an artificially produced sp2 and sp-hybridized carbon allotrope consisting of benzene rings and butadiyne linkages, which makes it structurally and characteristically different from conventional GBMs. No toxicity was seen in primary human M1 and M2 macrophages exposed to graphdiyne oxide.234 Importantly, biodegradation of graphdiyne oxide was demonstrated in M1 macrophages, which express inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), but not in M2 macrophages, which lack the ability to produce nitric oxide (NO).234 Moreover, pro-inflammatory cytokines were produced in a biodegradation-dependent manner. Furthermore, another recent study supported the proclivity of graphdiyne oxide to polarize macrophages to pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages.235 Subsequent studies by other investigators have shown that graphdiyne oxide has better biocompatibility and is more susceptible to degradative oxidation than GO, following subcutaneous or intraperitoneal administration in mice.236 The authors also addressed biodegradation in an acellular system using hypochlorous acid, and they implied that previous work234 demonstrated that macrophages engulfed “carbon nanosheets” (graphdiyne oxide) into lysosomes for biodegradation, but the biodegradation of graphdiyne oxide in macrophages was shown to occur in a peroxynitrite-dependent manner.234\n\nTransition Metal Dichalcogenides and hBN\n\nRecent studies performed in the Graphene Flagship have revealed that 2D MoS2 and WS2237 showed no cytotoxicity toward primary human monocyte-derived macrophages despite being readily internalized.238 The authors found that TMDs triggered so-called trained immunity as shown also for graphene (see above). Thus, pre-exposure to TMDs (“training”) followed by a resting period caused marked changes in immune-specific gene expression after challenging the cells with bacteria"
