First, it stresses Freda’s speed: he could indeed knock out a movie in two weeks, if he wanted to. And he did. there are several well-known anecdotes, and the director himself often delighted in touting his ability to wrap up a picture in a short shooting period, while at the same time underlining his technical skills. Freda would halt at nothing to make a ﬁlm—going so far as replacing his leading actor with a double, if necessity called. “the ideal would be to put the reel of ﬁlm in the camera, call ‘Action’ and never stop!”3 second, the Antonioni reference. the aforementioned interview dated from 1963, at a time where Antonioni was at his commercial and critical peak, after such works as L’avventura (1960) and L’eclisse (a.k.a. Eclipse, 1962). dismissing his work so sharply was gutsy. Freda’s tastes were quite clear from his own works, and he was usually very vocal about them. he was also adamant when it came to mentioning what directors and ﬁlms he did not like. his gargantuan self-esteem was paired with a scarce consideration toward many of his peers, both behind and in front of the camera. it was part of his temper, so notoriously choleric that his attitude during ﬁlming sometimes led to heated arguments and his walking off the set. third, the bet. Freda loved to bet, in cinema and in life. he liked gambling, expensive houses, fancy cars and works of art, and courting beautiful women. he was very rich at a certain point in his life. to paraphrase a famous george best quote, he spent a lot of money on gambling, ladies and fast cars—the rest, he just squandered. he was very selfconscious and cynical about such an attitude: “it’s my worst ﬁlms that bring me the most of my royalties,” he said.4 For these and other reasons, Riccardo Freda was a paradox. or, to quote his friend, colleague and collaborator yves boisset, he was “one of the great mysteries in cinema history.”5 As technically proﬁcient as anyone, he made a number of quite good ﬁlms and 1\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nsome extraordinary ones, with several box-oﬃce hits and very few ﬂops. but he was never considered an auteur in his home country until his later years. italian critics barely recognized the spectacular and technical values of his works, and dismissed them as mere entertainment for the masses. needless to say, the lack of feeling was reciprocated. As he put it himself, he was too American for the italians, and too italian to make movies in America.6 Freda’s collaborators and those who worked in the business had quite a different opinion of him as a director. Freda made beautiful period ﬁlms which, among other things, were appreciated in the right measure in France whereas not so much over here. i have been a good friend of his and held him in esteem. i can just say that Freda’s fault was not to have visconti’s luck. he was very intelligent, and very good, with an enormous sensibility; unfortunately he lacked that bit of luck you always need in life. the fact that he did not reach visconti’s level depends only from this speciﬁc deﬁciency.7\n\nthese words came from goffredo lombardo, the head of titanus, one of italy’s greatest ﬁlm companies, and the producer of visconti’s Rocco e i suoi fratelli (a.k.a. Rocco and His Brothers, 1960) and Il gattopardo (a.k.a. The Leopard, 1963). French ﬁlm critic Jacques lourcelles synthesized Freda’s nature by pointing out the director’s “duplicitous tendency toward enthusiasm on one hand, and his cynicism and disenchanted sneer on the other.”8 An unlikely balance of opposites that allowed him on the one hand to dream and make movies based on adventure and spectacle that would give italian cinema that sense of greatness it lacked, and on the other brought him not only to darker territories such as the horror ﬁlm, but also characterized his time-saving methods, work-for-hire choices and ultimately his downward spiral in the italian ﬁlm industry. so, if Riccardo Freda was born to be a ﬁlmmaker, chances are that he was not born in the right country—which might seem a contradiction since he was actually born in egypt, to a wealthy italian family. And his egyptian childhood years were actually more formative for his vision of cinema than his apprenticeship in the italian ﬁlm business. in egypt, as a child, he learned to love movies, watching them in theaters packed full with people of all social classes, and witnessing the absolute enthusiasm and participation of the ﬁlmgoers, who lived each ﬁlm as a cathartic physical experience, as if the story was really happening before their eyes. that shaped his will to make movies that would thrill the audience. “i don’t care about cold ﬁlms, literary ﬁlms, ﬁlms that lack participation, ﬁlms that do not take the audience into account. those i wanted to make are ﬁlms that the crowd takes part in, ﬁlms that are able to arouse it.”9 Which he did.\n\n“Righteous characters are sad” 10 When he wrote the ﬁrst complete retrospective essay on the director, in the spring 1963 issue of the magazine Présence du cinéma, Jacques lourcelles chose the title “un homme seul.” A man alone. that’s what Freda was, indeed. he was alone in waving the ﬂag of a spectacle-based, artistically self-conﬁdent popular cinema (which is something very different from the low-budget genre ﬂicks that caught on by the late ’50s), and he was alone in the later phases of his career, when his approach to the genres and filmmaking became more sparse and idiosyncratic. he was alone compared to the majority\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nof his colleagues, as he bluntly refused the italian way of being everybody’s friend, and on the contrary consistently spat acid on those ﬁlmmakers whose work and attitude he just could not stand. in italy, Freda had to ﬁght to shape a vision which no one else seemed to share, the idea of a cinema which would rival hollywood’s. A man with “an anticonformist vocation of researcher, of pioneer, of conqueror,” as Jeanmarie sabatier put it,11 who made swashbucklers at a time when ﬁlmmakers explored the misery of post-war italy through the lens of neorealism, and who rediscovered the epicness of the sword-andsandal genre while his peers were busy making harmless comedies about “bread, love and dreams,” to quote the title of luigi Comencini’s Pane, amore e fantasia (1953). last but not least, he invented the italRiccardo Freda on the set of I Vampiri. ian horror ﬁlm out of the blue with I vampiri (1957), paving the way to the works of bava, Ferroni, margheriti, Argento and unleashing the darker, hidden side of italian cinema. had he been born in the united states, Freda would have found a proper environment for his ﬁlms. the French critics, the ﬁrst to praise his work, labeled him “the european Raoul Walsh,”12 and he was adamant in stating that, to him, there would be no competition between Walsh and ingmar bergman: the former breathed cinema, the latter did not.13 still, and herein lies yet another paradox, for all its limitations, working in the italian ﬁlm industry allowed Freda a freedom that he would not have had overseas, where his unbridled creativity and brilliancy at troubleshooting would be crushed by the suffocating gears of the u.s. studio system. the director himself was well aware of it, and he was just as sharp-tongued about the American ﬁlmmakers he had worked with, underlining their shortcomings and incapability of “seeing” a scene. Presumptuous? Certainly. harsh? no doubt about it. sincere? Absolutely. As italian ﬁlm historian stefano della Casa pointed out, “such an uneasy character, a genius so deeply convinced of his own idea of ﬁlmmaking and so unwilling to maintain good neighborly relations could only be seen as an foreign object, if not even as an enemy, by critics who were deeply conditioned by the neorealist experience.”14 Freda was a man alone in life as well, from what we can gather. not a lonely man, but a loner: his friendships, selected and cultivated, were usually outside the shallow and hypocritical ﬁlm business. of all the producers he worked with, he had kind words for Riccardo gualino and ermanno donati: with the latter, he used to pal around outside\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthe set as well, despite the many arguments they had during their collaboration, whereas gualino—the head of the powerful lux Film—was another rare bird, one of the few cultured ﬁgures in the ﬁlm industry, an intellectual with whom he could discuss literature and art. For the rest, rather than waste time with his peers, he would more gladly spend it in the company of his beloved dogs and horses. even more signiﬁcant are Freda’s longtime friendships with two outsiders such as Panﬁlo gentile (1889–1971) and leo longanesi (1905–1957). gentile, a philosopher, journalist and politician, was always a fervent opponent of mass regimes, starting with Fascism. his book Democrazie mafiose argued that all democracies are basically maﬁa, since they are ruled by demagogic élites that captivate the masses only to tenaciously preserve the power for their own proﬁt. A loner as well, indeed. longanesi, on the other hand, was a born contrarian: a brilliant journalist, painter and drawing artist whose nonconformity had gained him hatred from each and every political faction. despite being a Fascist sympathizer, he used to poke fun at mussolini and his dictatorship in the satirical magazine L’italiano. “totalitarian regimes do not allow jokes but they have the involuntary merit of arousing them. during the big liberal black-outs, the spirit, the taste of comedy, the irony languish. satire is much more effective when it is directed against intolerant regimes,”15 he wrote. After the fall of Fascism, longanesi was recruited by the Allied troops to make Anti-fascist propaganda on the radio program Stella bianca, together with Freda, scriptwriter stefano vanzina (better known as steno) and writer-cum-director mario soldati, but his disillusionment was soon evident: “italy is a democracy in which a third of the citizens regret the past dictatorship, the other third await the soviet era and the remaining ones are willing to adapt to the next democratic Christian regime,” he quipped. his criticism toward the ﬂooding conformism culminated in the creation of the controversial magazine Il Borghese, in 1950, whose habit of criticizing both the left and the right soon had longanesi surrounded by enemies, even—or rather, especially—among friends. in many ways, Freda was just like longanesi. he could be so sharp with words as to destroy somebody with a one-line epigram, and would pay no special favors to anyone. And, like longanesi, he would eventually ﬁnd himself isolated, within a ﬁlm industry where his character, work, opinions, and skills as a ﬁlmmaker had been barely tolerated when he was commercially successful, then were merely exploited and eventually ignored, in the declining part of his career … and of italian genre cinema as well. Above all, Riccardo Freda was an individualist, like the heroes in his favorite ﬁlms. he looked at politics and organized religion, the foundation of organized societies, with barely dissimulated annoyance. Rather than give himself up into the arms of a political leader or a deity, he’d rather give a chance to the unpredictable, and therefore more respectable, unknown forces of magic. this reﬂected in his vision of movie heroes. “the banal man, the everyday man, i’m not the least bit interested in them. i’m cynical about that. i don’t care about them in real life either. i’m interested in heroes…. i’m interested in the space explorer, not in the guy who built the starship on which the former travels.”16 Freda’s love for heroics on screen can as well be seen as the counterpart of his disillusionment, if not utter disdain, toward human nature in real life. even though his view on the Fascist regime is debatable at times, as he lived through it from a privileged position, it contains sharp-as-nails observations. one of his favorite targets was nicola de Pirro, the general manager of Cinematography in the post–World War ii years, who had\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nbeen a Fascist hierarch during the regime—the kind of obtuse-minded, grey bureaucrat who represented the qualities Freda despised so much. the tragicomic traits of Fascism, the intellectuals’ submission to the dictatorship and their opportunism in shedding skin and changing sides whenever the wind blew in one direction or another, all but heightened his basic contempt toward society as opposed to the single man’s will. this is patent in his ﬁlms, centered on solitary ﬁgures who ﬁght social order and the authority with all their will, or take on heroic challenges, counting solely on their will: take Prince dubrovsky (Aquila nera, 1946; La vendetta di Aquila Nera, 1951), Casanova (Il cavaliere misterioso, 1948), Count ugolino della gherardesca (Il conte Ugolino, 1949), d’Artagnan’s son Raoul (Il figlio di d’Artagnan, 1950), spartacus the gladiator (Spartaco, 1953), Jason (I giganti della Tessaglia, 1960), maciste (Maciste alla corte del Gran Khan, 1961; Maciste all’inferno, 1962), benvenuto Cellini (Il magnifico avventuriero, 1963). even characters that belong to a different context, such as Jean valjean (I miserabili, 1948) and Roger laroque (Roger la Honte, 1966), are reshaped accordingly. but in Freda’s cinema there is also room for unforgettable female portraits, such as the eponymous heroines in Teodora (1954) and Beatrice Cenci (1956), two of his very best efforts. Freda loved women very much and had a troubled personal life. “Women took my fortune and my illusions,” he once admitted. A bitterly ironic passage in his memoir recounts when the director came back to Rome after the end of the war, in 1945, only to ﬁnd his house at trinità dei monti occupied by yugoslavian soldiers, and discovering that his wife Angiola dondina had become the lover of the platoon’s commander. they never divorced, though, and after dondina’s untimely death Freda was oﬃcially a widower. the great love of his life was actress gianna maria Canale, much younger than him and possibly the most beautiful woman in italian cinema of the 1950s. they were a couple for a decade, and worked together in 12 ﬁlms, from Il cavaliere misterioso to I vampiri. the split with Canale was quite painful, according to those who knew the director. 17 later on Freda met a younger woman, silvana merli (1939–2000), with whom he moved to France in 1963. she gave him two daughters: Jacqueline, born in 1963, and guislaine, born in 1965. silvana—whom he eventually married in 1996—was a key presence in his life, albeit an often overlooked one, and had a signiﬁcant impact on his profession. Freda himself never talked about it, and it is thanks to the recollections of Jacqueline and guislaine Freda that the curtain on an obscure period in the director’s career, between the gory gothic horror Estratto dagli archivi segreti della polizia di una capitale europea (1972) and the swan song Murder Obsession (1981) can be ﬁnally raised. more on that later. Divoratori di celluloide opens with an enigmatic, tragic and ultimately unforgettable episode which blends in equal parts cynicism, romanticism, and an inner core of fatalism—plus a taste for the detail that only a real aesthete could have. the director notices a beautiful young girl buying a rose, only one single scarlet rose, in Rome’s via veneto. she turns to him; their eyes meet. not a word is spoken. irresistibly attracted to the woman, but at the same time too timid to attempt an approach, Freda begins to follow her. she turns back again and smiles at him “with the same smile, a bit leonardo-like,” before crossing the road and disappearing behind the door of a boardinghouse. he is baﬄed: was that smile an erotic invitation? An act of coquetry? A self-pleased statement? the next day, Freda reads in the newspaper that the girl committed suicide, throwing herself from her room’s window with the rose in her hands. she had been promised a role in exchange for sexual favors by a ﬁlm director who then went back on his word. Freda concludes: “had i addressed to her, had i distracted her, had i promised\n\n6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ntoo a role, keeping my word as i have always done, maybe that beautiful girl would not have died in that dark courtyard, with a rose not so boldly red amid so much blood.”18 Whether the result of memory or invention, the anecdote conveys perfectly Freda’s world view, and at the same time it has all the traits of his best work. it functions at a purely visual level, with its colorful details (the red rose, like the one Klaus Kinski squeezes in his hands in A doppia faccia, 1969), the reference to Renaissance art (the smile that recalls leonardo da vinci’s paintings), the element of mystery, the grand-guignol, and the fatal twist ending. And it also conveys a vision of woman as a mysterious, everchanging universe, impossible to decipher and yet irresistible—and at the same time doomed to abuse and desecration on the part of the stronger sex.\n\n“Cinema is action, emotion, tension, velocity” 19 Jacques lourcelles labeled Freda “one of the great aesthetes in the history of cinema,”20 and fellow director vittorio Cottafavi called him “a master of the image, a remarkable painter.”21 it would take just a passing look at the opening of Beatrice Cenci or the climactic scenes in Teodora to second those statements. his artistic sensibility and his apprenticeship as a sculptor were vital in forming his style as a ﬁlmmaker. he used to reiterate that there is only one camera angle, one set-up for each scene, and a natural born director has to know it. leonardo knew it when he painted The Last Supper, as did John Ford when he shot My Darling Clementine (1946). therefore, to Freda, ﬁlm is essentially a visual art. “the picture is mute and visual. sound, which in fact was stitched to it much later, must be a complement, albeit at times an extraordinary one, yet always secondary to the power of the image.”22 Which partly explains why he never cared much about the dialogue, even when he was making a ﬁlm based on a shakespeare play, and preferred to use sound and music as a nuance to best highlight the visual canvas. such a vision is also inherently coherent with Freda’s view of the world. like his heroes, a ﬁlmmaker is ultimately a man alone, in victory and in defeat. to him, the only thing that prevented cinema from being a complete art form was collaboration, whereas a sculptor, or a painter, is alone throughout all the creation phases: in his ideal view, the director alone would have to take up all the artistic duties, including scriptwriting, lighting, editing. What art there can be when a movie is the product of more brains—when there are brains—and it is a strange mixture of ideas, musical notes, lights and shadows, and therefore the work of many individuals, sometimes very different in culture, taste, artistic sensibility, social background?23\n\none of the most beautiful scenes in Freda’s oeuvre is the ending of Il magnifico avventuriero, where benvenuto Cellini is in the throes of a creative bout while making his most famous statue, the Perseus with the head of medusa. here, the identiﬁcation between the director and the protagonist is complete: Cellini’s artistic feat is equated in all respects to a heroic act, and his creative fury is the same that most likely pervaded Freda while piling up shot after shot, in a feverish trance. if in Pierrot le Fou (1965) godard had samuel Fuller say that ﬁlm is like a battleground, to Freda it was like a rough block of marble waiting to be shaped into form—as fast as possible. “the faster you go, the closer you follow inspiration. Cinema is action for a ﬁlmmaker as well.”24 to Freda, cinema was all about challenge and discovery. Challenge, as seen earlier,\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nwas ﬁrst and foremost in the act of making a motion picture itself. he considered cinema as the most challenging form of spectacle, because it had the means to portray what others could not. “the ideal would be … to ﬁlm the bible, for instance the Creation. the world takes shape, life appears, the huge prehistoric animals. All that you can’t express with another form of spectacle,” he explained. “because you can paint the Creation, but the result will be a motionless canvas. stravinsky did something similar with music, with The Rite of Spring, which is an extraordinary musical piece, but lacks the image. With literature, it is the same. so, all this, all you can’t express with another art form, to me is the ideal cinema.”25 What is more, his favorite stories were centered on a challenge that Freda’s heroes would face—against a sworn enemy, a collective plot, or even a supernatural menace. his ﬁlms were themselves an act of challenge, a gauntlet to the dominant neorealist vision he so utterly despised. And he maintained such a vision throughout his life.26 discovery, in Freda’s ﬁlms, similarly pertains to the visuals and the narrative alike. the director’s favorite stylistic device, the sideways tracking shot, is essential to understand such a notion. to him, such a movement is “the instrument to discover, one after another, things, objects or people, placed in a way as to surprise, affect or move the viewer.”27 visual discovery was the basic means to convey a sense of wonder in the audience and create a compelling, dynamic spectacle: the secret of movies is the progressive disclosure of the décor, of the world surrounding the characters. the image must be a continuous surprise for the eyes. the camera must never reveal a scene all of a sudden in its entirety, but have the viewers ﬁnd out about it slowly, and progressively uncover its beauty.28\n\ndiscovery is also a vital element to the story itself, as the cinematic narrative must follow a linear process of discovering. Will dubrovsky beat his enemy? Will valjean escape his sworn enemy Javert? Will Casanova defeat the conspiracy against his country and save his brother? Will maciste rescue the poor girl who is about to be burnt at the stake as a witch? Will Cynthia escape her diabolical husband, dr. hichcock? to put it shortly, Freda’s cinema is, as lourcelles put it, “naturally spectacular,” since “every human relationship in it is solved in spatial terms.”29 At ﬁrst, such a process is charged with a positive meaning. Challenge and discovery take the form of journeys in space and time (I miserabili’s spawning narrative arc encompasses more than two decades) and culminate in a satisfactory denouement: order is reestablished and life can start again on a new beginning, in a circular process that often ﬁnds its visual representation in a symmetrical camera movement: take the opening and ending of the neapolitan melodrama Vedi Napoli e poi muori (1952). the narratives are a recurring pattern, like a still life or Christ’s deposition from the cross for a painter. Psychologies are minimal, and must be so, because, in the director’s own words, “the audience does not give a damn about the villain’s childhood negative experiences. they simply want ﬁlm characters to be clearly divided, with the hero on one side and the scoundrel on the other.”30 still, such a faith in the classical rules of narration is continually undermined by Freda’s own pessimism: Casanova succeeds, but we see him leave alone, mournful after the death of his beloved (Il cavaliere misterioso); valjean saves his daughter’s reputation, but is treacherously killed in the process (I miserabili); Count ugolino’s name is cleared too late, after he has succumbed to a horrible and fatal punishment (Il conte Ugolino)…\n\n8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nsimilarly, Freda’s own challenge was doomed to defeat. even though Aquila nera topped the box-oﬃce in 1946 and the director’s following works were produced by the prestigious lux Film, he never managed to fully achieved what he hoped for. the everchanging texture and landscape of popular cinema proved too unstable: a few years after the period adventure drama craze, audiences were crowding to see tearjerking melodramas set in the present day. Freda obliged with variable results, the best being the film noir-tinged Il tradimento (Passato che uccide) (1951), and again in the early 1950s he seemed to ﬁnd his ideal environment in the peplum, with such ambitious productions as Spartaco and Teodora. but the undercurrents of the national ﬁlm industry were in turmoil, and by the end of the 1950s he had adapted once and for good to genre ﬁlmmaking—this time without any hope of topping the box-oﬃce, but struggling in the realm of the ever-growing ﬂood of b-pictures that were being churned out in Cinecittà at breakneck pace.\n\n“I keep trying to make … very imaginative films, and nothing else” 31 From the mid–1950s onwards, Freda’s ﬁlmography became bleaker and bleaker. the stories were more intimate, and touched such scabrous topics as incest (Beatrice Cenci), vampirism (I vampiri), and necrophilia (L’orribile segreto del Dr. Hichcock). the “very human sadism” which, according to his colleague vittorio Cottafavi,32 imbued his ﬁlms, came to the fore. the dark side of the human condition took center stage, more prominently in his outstanding gothic diptych formed by L’orribile segreto del Dr. Hichcock (1962) and Lo spettro (1963), but it crept under the surface of apparently more amiable works such as Caccia all’uomo (1961). Partly, it was the logical consequence of the changing nature of genre cinema, which was accommodating a more complex spectrum of elements, with an emphasis on violence, morbidity, eroticism. but there was more. Freda’s attitude toward ﬁlmmaking grew more and more disillusioned. the turning point is perhaps Beatrice Cenci, his most ambitious ﬁlm to date and possibly his masterpiece, whose disappointing box-oﬃce performance resulted in the director descending into the realm of b-cinema and trying his hand at various genres: sword-and-sandal, horror, Western, crime ﬁlms and gialli. signiﬁcantly, after Beatrice Cenci Freda helmed two low-budget ﬁlms under tight if not diﬃcult production circumstances. And it matters little that I vampiri was one of his most impressive efforts while his next movie Agguato a Tangeri (1957) was one of the least interesting: the feeling that both pictures exude is that, while the italian ﬁlm industry was experiencing the ﬁrst taste of the commercially fruitful genre production which would characterize the following decade, Freda—who had paved the way with his work in popular cinema—hardly managed to grasp the bandwagon. even though I vampiri did start the gothic horror thread, its nondescript box-oﬃce gross proved another disappointment, while Freda’s take on science ﬁction with Caltiki il mostro immortale (1959) led to one of his walk-offs, with mario bava taking over the directorial duties. the director returned to horror a few years later, this time when the gothic was an established commercial reality, and found it a fertile terrain to explore themes that were closer to his world view compared to the sunnier peplum and adventure ﬁlms—so much so that in the mid–1960s he often declared horror to be his favorite genre,\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nafter the fading of the old-school swashbucklers. if L’orribile segreto del Dr. Hichcock is perhaps his more striking-looking gothic ﬁlm, Lo spettro is the most personal and fully coherent, a huis clos drama which proves that, if he wanted, Freda could indeed make an intimate ﬁlm of sorts—if not the kind one would expect from Antonioni or bergman. Lo spettro contains the core of Freda’s vision—one would call it nihilistic. As a character says at the end, “the devil is a very real person,” a line that ﬁts perfectly the human monsters the director had portrayed over the years and would continue to feature in his later ﬁlms. still, the growing slapdashness, the increasingly low budgets, the ﬂood of cookiecutter sub-products that, in his view, were just badly made copies of the kind of ﬁlms he always strived for, made him more and more disinterested and lazy. once, he was the only one. now, he was one of the many. it mattered little that he was better than most. by this time, Freda had realized that he could put his skills to better use and make more money by directing one single scene than a whole movie. such a presumptuous detachment concealed another challenge: to rub shoulders with the American ﬁlmmakers who had created the kind of ﬁlms he loved, and show them he could make them even better—and relish in the type of scenes he loved most: battles, rides on horseback, arena ﬁghts. Freda’s work as second unit or action director on peplum and period adventure ﬁlms between 1958 and 1963 shows not only his growing disinterest in the so-called human factor, but also the radicalization of his view of motion picture as spectacle. signiﬁcantly, one of the works in which he took more pride, among those he made in the 1960s, was Romeo e Giulietta (1964), shakespeare’s tragedy reread as a swashbuckler/Western crossover of sorts, with little regard for the precision of the acting (a sacrilege for scholars of the bard’s oeuvre) but an amazing capacity to reinvent the original material, and turn it into something else—not necessarily better, but more cinematically engrossing, at least in the way Freda intended movies. it was the kind of products he used to make for Riccardo gualino’s lux Films, when he was italian cinema’s top grossing director, whereas now he was drifting among italy, spain and France, docking his boat whenever he would ﬁnd a project in line with his style, even if this meant having to deal with all sorts of compromises—bad scripts, lousy actors, laughable budgets. meanwhile, the French critics discovered his work and greeted him as an auteur. France, to Freda, was an illusory buen retiro, where he attempted to revive the type of cinema he mastered, the period drama and adventure stories, with such ﬁlms as Les deux orphelines (1965) or the excellent Roger La Honte, before giving up to the ﬂood: such is the case of the two James bond–type ﬁlms that he directed for producer Robert de nesle, Coplan FX 18 casse tout (1965) and Coplan ouvre le feu à Mexico (1967), the latter marking the end of his French period. the last part of Freda’s career can be summarized under the heading of disenchantment and disinterest. After his return to italy he helmed six ﬁlms in ﬁfteen years, which were far from his best efforts, such as the unpleasant giallo L’iguana dalla lingua di fuoco (1971) and the gothic horror pics Estratto dagli archivi segreti della polizia di una capitale europea and Murder Obsession. And yet, today these are among his best known works, due to their adhering to genres that are more popular among the younger generations of cinephiles, their overreliance on blood and gore and their distribution on home video. in this sense, Freda’s critical evaluation has been somewhat unbalanced and leads to the umpteenth paradox. italian critics started praising his movies in the early to mid–1970s, and ﬁlm festivals hosted retrospectives on his work in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nmeanwhile, abroad, many horror cinema scholars who did not know (or bother to search) his work outside the genre attempted to sum up his career based on a handful of ﬁlms alone, and nurtured the misleading concept of Freda being basically a horror ﬁlm director, a sort of mentor to mario bava—which, in a career spanning ﬁve decades and with only a handful of titles that fall into the realm of the horror ﬁlm, is quite limiting and shortsighted.33 What is more, the director’s later ﬁlms were mostly far from his best work. in no small part, this might be due to the director’s trenchant vision of post–1968 cinema: today, everything is easier and settled. the photography, even in color, is not an issue anymore, and as for the story itself, the more it is messed up and ungrammatical, the more chances it has to be praised by the critics. i am certain that if the slow-motion, the zoom, the ﬂashback, the light-incamera were prohibited, we would witness a real hecatomb of ﬁlmmakers!34\n\nhe obliged to the ongoing trends, but his heart was far from it, and even if he hadn’t expressed it explicitly, it would have been evident just the same. Compare L’iguana dalla lingua di fuoco with, say, mario bava’s 5 bambole per la luna d’agosto (a.k.a. Five Dolls for an August Moon, 1970). two movies made in the same period, and which their makers did not care the least bit about: bava used to maintain that his ﬁlm, a Ten Little Indians ripoff, was his very worst effort, whereas Freda adopted yet another pseudonym for the occasion, the una tantum Willy Pareto. nevertheless, even at a ﬁrst glance, these two ﬁlms couldn’t be more different from one another. Whereas Freda openly treated the material with contempt, resorting to gleefully ugly shock effects and putting aside any attempt at style, bava dealt with the bad screenplay he had been given in the same way benvenuto Cellini would have done with a rough block of argyle, resorting to zooms, weird angles, psychedelic focus/out-of-focus passages and an array of assorted visual tricks to squeeze life out of it, if only for a brief sequence. this sums up two different ways of moviemaking even more than a thousand words. As sabatier noted, Freda does not care about the “second degree,” the detachment and the irony. Contrarily to the major part of his colleagues … he deeply believes in what he does and—whether it be peplum, melodrama or horror—he keeps a total sincerity, playing the game up to the very end.35\n\ntherefore, when such conviction cracks, so does the ﬁnal result. it would be tempting, and foolishly romantic, to depict Freda’s detachment from cinema in his later years as an act of aristocratic self-imposed exile like that of I vampiri’s duchess du grand in her castle, surrounded by the memories of a past glorious age— or, perhaps even more ﬁttingly, like the characters in Lo spettro and Murder Obsession, who end their days in a darkened, solitary tomb, similar to dying animals. such a reading could even be used for the disastrous attempt at returning behind the camera with the ill-fated La fille de d’Artagnan (a.k.a. Revenge of the Musketeers, 1994) and in the octagenarian director’s uncompromising refusal to mend fences with his leading actress, sophie marceau—the last bout of suicidal arrogance on the part of a ﬁlmmaker who, even when he had to accept his oncoming fate, chose to do it his own way. but it did not go like that. even though partly imposed by the economic and productive contingencies that gradually drained the national ﬁlm industry of its blood with even more precision than dr. du grand’s transfusions, Freda’s protracted absence from the set was mainly due to harsh family issues. Cinema, with which he had been growing increasingly disenchanted anyway, eventually became a collateral damage—especially after the failure to mount the one project he truly cared about, the World War i epic Francesco Baracca. Freda never\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nmentioned such issues, and no trace of it can be found either in his memoir, interviews or books on his career. he never asked for comprehension, let alone compassion. his daughter Jacqueline called him a stoic, and that is the most appropriate word. “instead, here i am, ‘derelict and abandoned,’ like the title of a bad 19th century novel or a good ﬁlm based on it.” to dissipate the gloomy air that hung over the last pages of Divoratori di celluloide, the director chose to end his memoir with a humorous quip which nevertheless contained a painful truth. At 72, he portrayed himself as “a modest retired man, ignored by all, who is sitting like that Chinese on a river’s edge, looking at his enemies’ bodies carried away by the swirling waters of death. one by one, everyone goes…. shivering, i think: when will my turn be?”36 An eerie image, indeed, and one destined to remain ﬁxed in time for almost two decades, until his death in 1999. but one that somehow concealed the truth: it sounded as if Riccardo Freda had cut himself away from the world, whereas in fact, as Jacqueline puts it, “it was life that cut him away from it.”37\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 A Portrait of the Filmmaker as a Young Man An Italian in Egypt The most powerful, populous and inﬂuential of Arabic nations, Egypt had a key economic position in the Mediterranean basin. The opening of the Suez canal in 1869, which granted a direct access to the Indian Ocean, with the understandable advantages for commercial shipments to and from the Orient, had proven a gargantuan effort on the part of the ambitious Khedive Isma’il Pasha, whose dreams of modernizing and reforming the country left Egypt in deep debt to the European nations. This led to the Khedive selling the canal to the British in 1875, and to the subsequent intervention of foreign powers to restore credit: the so-called “Caisse de la Dette.” Foreign control resulted in a period of political turmoil, with the Urabi Revolt and the deposition of Isma’il on the part of the Ottoman Sultan (under pressure from the French and the British), and led to the installment of the “veiled protectorate” in 1882. Under the military control of the British, the Egyptian territory developed a strong multicultural presence, which included Italians as well. One such was Vittorio Freda, formerly a modest bank clerk of Campanian roots (he was born in Acerno, near Salerno) who, despite his humble origins, had managed to become a bank president and gathered a remarkable fortune. Vittorio had married Emma, a good-looking young woman whose dreams to become an opera singer had collapsed against her parents’ prejudices: in a male-oriented society such as late 1800s Italy, singers were considered little better than prostitutes. Eventually Emma had to give up her aspirations, and dedicated herself to raising a family. The Fredas moved to Egypt in 1905: an agency of Banco di Roma opened in Alexandria, to support the interests of the Italian cotton importers, and Vittorio was called on to be its president. Riccardo was born there, in Alexandria—whose modern part was built by Italian architects in early 1900, and looked very much like Italian cities such as Torino—on February 24, 1909, one of ten siblings—seven males and three females. Freda’s recollections of his early childhood in Egypt, in a huge villa complete with servants and a chauffeur, were nothing short of fairytale-like. And the ﬁgure of Vittorio stood out as nothing short of heroic, so much so that one has the impression that, even more than on those heroes he had read about in books or admired on the silver screen, Freda’s ﬁlm characters were modeled ﬁrst and foremost upon him. Riccardo spoke of his father with open admiration, calling him a revolutionary, a free thinker, and a man ahead of his time, and praising his stern moral ﬁber. Vittorio was a self-made man, who climbed 13\n\n14\n\nRICCARD O FREDA\n\nthe social ladder via his capabilities and force of will, and yet being part of the bourgeoisie did not prevent him from remaining faithful to his ideas. He was a severe man—the director liked to recall how no one in the family could stand Vittorio’s stare—who just could not tolerate injustice. He utterly despised the British’ racist attitude toward the Egyptians, who were treated as inferiors, and believed in the indigenous population’s right to regain their independence. As Freda would point out, “He fought for a principle against contempt, segregation and colonialism,” by donating large sums to the insurrectional movement and becoming a covert ﬁnancer of the 1915 Arab revolution. Actually, it is more likely that Vittorio Freda ﬁnanced the revolutionaries not out of personal convictions, but on behalf of Italian interests in the country. The anecdotes Freda told about his father are surrounded by a literary aura that makes them look suspiciously like excerpts from the adventure books that Riccardo devoured as a kid. Such as, for instance, the image of the two wooden chests ﬁlled with gifts that the Arabs delivered to the Freda mansion every Christmas, out of gratitude … making Vittorio angry since he did not want any gifts. Another episode had him hide in the house and cure a wounded fugitive Australian, chased by the Arabs, even though the injured man had taken sides with the English enemy … only to ask him to leave, to avoid having his daughter fall in love with him. Last but not least, Vittorio Freda used to give great parties for his Arab friends to celebrate the end of the ramadan, the Arab month of purifying fasting: “For us children, it was a real dream. Incense, dances, silver tableware and ﬁres in the night … the Arabs chanted and danced amid Gargantuan plates.”1 An image that predates the many fascinating and luxurious feast scenes in the director’s ﬁlmography, from Aquila nera to Spartaco, from Beatrice Cenci to Agi Murad—Il diavolo bianco (1959). If his father instilled in Riccardo the admiration for strong-willed, antagonistic and heroic ﬁgures, his mother was responsible for the child’s lifelong passion. Emma’s frustrated artistic velleities and romantic sensibility resulted in an insatiable love for cinema. Each day, she got in the car and told the chauffeur to take her to the movies: she would watch two or three ﬁlms in a row. And she dragged little Riccardo—who did not attend school, but studied at home with a preceptor, as did the members of the city’s wealthiest families—with her. “We went to a theater, watched a movie, got out, and went to another one. Certainly, according to the dictates of psychoanalysis, this caused in me the wish to reproduce the ﬁlms I was watching, without a precise idea on how to do it.”2 Freda’s childhood memories were populated by fragments of early silent ﬁlms, seen in crowded Egyptian theaters. “The movie houses … were divided in three parts. The lucky Europeans were sitting in the ﬁrst rows, the Europeans of a more modest social class occupied the second rows, and ﬁnally, behind a wooden balustrade, there were the Arabs. And they were the show within the show….” 3 Serials were in vogue, and audiences followed with astonishing involvement the adventures of such heroines as Pearl White, who at the end of each installment was about to be submitted to all sorts of horrible tortures by bandits, in typical cliffhanger style. For the Egyptians and the Europeans, Pearl White was almost a goddess. When the lights turned on, the Egyptians were like mad. They gesticulated, shouted and cursed the brigands, shaking their ﬁsts in the air. For a kid, it was an incredible sight. I very quickly realized the magical impact of cinema on the audience.4\n\nBesides his parents and siblings, two more individuals were part of Riccardo’s enlarged family: his father’s brothers were staying at the villa, and were quite peculiar\n\n1. A Portrait of the Filmmaker as a Young Man\n\n15\n\ntypes too. One, Federico, was a doctor, who perfected a collyrium that made him rich, but wasted all his money gambling at the local casinos. The other uncle was the family’s black sheep, an idler with an acute aversion to any activity vaguely resembling a job: when Emma asked him to watch one of the kids, as soon as he was alone he would just drop the child and go out the window. Again, as with other episodes of his childhood, the director’s recollections look more like footage from an imaginary movie, this time a Mack Sennett one-reel, with even more unlikely developments: the black sheep uncle moved to Sicily, became a priest, seduced all the most beautiful women in his parish and eventually had to marry one whom he got pregnant. According to Freda, after shedding his cassock to the winds, he relocated in Philadelphia and became a millionaire. Riccardo’s early life in Egypt shaped his temper, his beliefs and his worldview as well. He grew up in a state of enviable freedom of mind, untouched by the Italian mores and way of life, including Catholicism; he claimed he was not baptized, and was given total freedom of choice once he became of age—unlike his siblings, he never obliged. Living in a wealthy family allowed him to savor a lifestyle that was closer to that of the 19th century aristocracy, and was gradually getting lost in the Western world. However, the time eventually came for little Riccardo to return to the land of his ancestors. The exact date of Freda’s arrival in Italy varies according to the different sources: in early interviews, he mentioned that his family moved from Egypt at the outbreak of World War I, and speaking with Éric Poindron, he said that his departure, aboard a boat named Esperia, took place in 1914, when he was ﬁve.5 On the other hand, Freda’s youngest daughter Guislaine, basing on her aunt’s recollection, dates her father’s arrival in Italy to the time when he was about fourteen years old, that is 1923. Whatever the date, the reason for the Fredas moving to Italy was strictly family business. Among other qualities that his son envied him, Vittorio Freda was, in Riccardo’s words, “an incorrigible seducer.” Even though he was the father of ten children, he fell in love with Emma’s sister, Paolina, which led to a fatal decision. He took his family to Milan, bought a huge villa for his wife and children in Viale Monterosa, and left to the United States (namely, Cincinnati) with Paolina, who gave him ten more children. Vittorio showed up in Milan only once, a few years later, to pay a visit to Emma and the kids. His appearance before the mansion was so unexpected that a couple of children, Riccardo included, locked themselves in the bathroom out of fright. However, since it was the day of the races, eventually all the family went to the San Siro racetrack: horses were a common passion which would become very important in Riccardo’s life as well. Vittorio Freda died at the age of 52. He had ultimately become a stranger, an almost mythical and distant ﬁgure, not unlike those heroes that his son used to read about in books.\n\nDaydreaming in Milan Once in Italy, young Riccardo was forced to conform to the rules—starting with enrolling in school, which he hated. Still, Egypt was something he could not forget, so much so that he claimed that he and his brothers sometimes still talked in Arab just for the fun of it. And he maintained his steady diet from the Egyptian days: books and movies.\n\n16\n\nRICCARD O FREDA\n\nReading was an absorbing activity: Riccardo used to isolate himself under a tree in some quiet spot of the villa’s park, and get lost in the adventures of Dumas’ musketeers or Emilio Salgari’s corsairs. He also loved Hugo’s Les Misérables and Notre Dame de Paris and the great Russian novelists such as Tolstoy and Pushkin, but above all he had a passion for the works of Alexandre Dumas, père, from The Three Musketeers to The Count of Monte Cristo, from The Tower of Nesle to Ascanio. Moviegoing was an equally strong habit, as Riccardo regularly accompanied his mother—or, as she was known among her acquaintances, “Madame Pellicola” (Madame Film). “My mom and I went to the movies like others go to church,”6 he commented, speaking of which, “given Italians’ illiteracy, whenever a caption appeared on screen, the whole audience read it out loud, in unison. It seemed like being in church, or at the oratory….”7 Emma Freda liked sentimental ﬁlms, those starring Lillian Gish, Mary Pickford, Pola Negri or Italian divas such as Lyda Borelli and Francesca Bertini, whereas Riccardo’s favorites were the adventure ﬁlms—Douglas Fairbanks’ The Mark of Zorro and Robin Hood, Valentino’s The Eagle, as well as early Westerns. At a young age he discovered the greats: Lang, Murnau, Griﬃth (“To me, Griﬃth was like Dumas in literature”), Vidor, and Von Stroheim—whom he later met and befriended in Marrakech, during the making of Alerte au sud (a.k.a. Alert in the South, 1953, Jean-Devaivre, co-starring Gianna Maria Canale). He was also remarkably impressed by Giovanni Pastrone’s Cabiria (1914), with its technical innovations and its inventive special effects and maquettes. Riccardo’s favorite theater was the Cinema Silenzioso in Milan, where all the motion pictures starring popular comedians such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton were screened. A pianist was there to accompany the ﬁlms, but each time he hit a note or two, the roars from the audience forced him to stop. Some time later he would give it another try, with the same result. The episode taught Riccardo that “music shall never supplant the image nor “fabricate” the emotion. Emotion is what’s on the screen, music isn’t but a dynamic complement to the show.”8 Freda witnessed another ill-fated experimentation involving sound effects at another theater, the Dal Verme. The owner attempted to achieve a kind of sonorization ante litteram, by installing huge naphta engines beneath the screen which were ignited during the famous scene of the parting of the troops in King Vidor’s The Big Parade (1925): soon the place was ﬁlled with smelly gas, making the air unbreathable and causing an uproar in the room. Another episode which Freda claimed to have witnessed as a kid, and which left a vivid memory in him, was when he had the chance to watch the shooting of a motion picture right in the park of the family villa. A coach with a woman on it would drive past the gate, a solitary man would then sneak in and approach the house of his beloved; then he would lean against a tree and press a hand against his chest, as if his heart could not stand the pain. From behind his bedroom’s window, Riccardo could see the scene in its making: despite the actor’s none-too-subtle mimicry, the director was not satisﬁed, and take after take he kept asking him for more, yelling and yelling like mad to achieve the desired effect from the unfortunate thespian. Even though, as other ﬂashes from Freda’s past, the scene sounds like a fabrication of sorts, it functions as a key to read some of the director’s peculiar views on cinema, such as his disdain for actors and his view (and embodiment) of the director as an absolute monarch, with the power of life and death over his cast and crew. More than anything else, the experience served as an early advice: movies are made of illusion and simulation, nothing else. “And I thought to myself: what bullshit cinema is!”9\n\n1. A Portrait of the Filmmaker as a Young Man\n\n17\n\nArs Gratia Artis Riccardo’s elder brother had become an important engineer; another was one of Milan’s most distinguished lawyers. He was expected to take an equally prestigious path. “Like all those students who don’t want to study, I chose law school,” he quipped. It took him just one lesson to decide he wasn’t made to become a barrister. Instead, he wanted to be an artist. For one year, he was an apprentice at the workshop of Attilio Prendoni, a renowned sculptor who specialized in modeling horse ﬁgures, and who would eventually lose all his money in gambling, in San Remo. After learning the rudiments of drawing and modeling with Prendoni, Freda entered the workshop of the illustrious Adolfo Wildt, to learn marble sculpting. He loved to recall that his ﬁrst work as a sculptor was a marble egg, an image of simplicity that hid a tremendous effort behind it; then came reproductions of famous works, including Michelangelo’s Pietà. Freda’s apprenticeship with Wildt would not last long, though. At the age of 23, he married a girl by the name of Angiola Dondina, and the couple moved into a small apartment in via Monforte, in the palace owned by the Visconti family. The descendant of a wealthy Milanese lineage, and the sister of an eminent lawyer, Dondina had aspirations to be a painter and convinced Riccardo to pursue an artistic career, renouncing a job as an archivist at the Milan township. It was Angiola who introduced him to the renowned Barbaroux Gallery. Starting in the 1920s, alongside public spaces that hosted exhibitions and performances, Milan saw the birth of several private galleries that played a vital role in the orientation, taste, and formation of many artists, and pushed forward the evolution of the key Italian artistic movements of the era. Vittorio Barbaroux was possibly the country’s most important patron, who gave work, nourishment and accommodation to a number of young painters and sculptors, including soon-to-be-famous names such as Aligi Sassu and Giacomo Manzù. Riccardo and Angiola did not live the bohemian life, though. Unlike many of his peers he had a day job, giving Latin and art lessons, which allowed him to have his daily bread on his table, even though the butter was often missing. The renowned Silvio Vigezzi, director of Milan’s contemporary art gallery, organized Freda’s ﬁrst exhibition, but none of his early works seem to have survived, not even in photographs. Freda claimed they all got lost during the war. The only testimony to his skills are the sculptures he would create for his own movies, such as the colossus on I giganti della Tessaglia and the Buddhas in Maciste alla corte del Gran Khan. Even though his position in the art world was to remain marginal, during his days as a sculptor Freda got to meet a number of important personalities, and became close friends with the great sculptor Arturo Martini. In the meantime, he also moonlighted as art critic for the Fascist journal L’Ardito d’Italia, “The Magazine of the Italian Assault Troops,” edited by the prince Valerio Pignatelli. “I did not care about the mag’s opinions,” Freda would later comment: “I took advantage to stick up for the young artists and notably Modigliani, for whom I had the greatest admiration.”10 As it would happen often in his career, he seemed to thoroughly enjoy his status as a contrarian, going so far as recounting with visible satisfaction the effects of his counter-current criticism on the artistic status quo, which resulted in heated phone calls at the magazine’s headquarters. Even though he never was a left-wing person, Freda did not enroll in the Fascist Party. Like many artists and intellectuals during the regime, he tried to cope with Fascism\n\n18\n\nRICCARD O FREDA\n\nby carefully moving within its bureaucratic mesh while dealing with the inner obtuseness of many hierarchs, and sneering at his peers’ awe, concealed under a façade of moral pride. He often recalled sarcastically when, in Milan, he had been part of the group of artists who founded the “Accademia di Sant’Ambrogio” (Academy of St. Ambrogio). The Academy was a movement that comprised many of the period’s most celebrated names in the artistic milieu—Achille Funi, Mario Sironi, Felice Casorati, Giò Ponti …—and its statute was ﬁrmly critical of the regime’s attitude toward art. Its manifesto was published in the newspaper L’Ambrosiano. The next day a telegram from Rome was delivered to the Academy’s headquarters, consisting of three words: “Sciogliere immediatamente Accademia” (“Disband Academy immediately”). Its members duly obliged with their tail between their legs. Their artistic rebellion against the regime had lasted only one day.\n\nOn the Way to Cinecittà In 1933, the 24-year-old Riccardo Freda left Milan for Rome, following the advice of his friend, the well-known painter Esodo Pratelli, who had been summoned to the Capital to work at the Under-Secretariat for Press and Propaganda, headed by Mussolini’s son-in-law, Galeazzo Ciano. Perhaps Freda’s inner pragmatism had convinced him that there was no artistic future for him in sight. After all, his friendship with Arturo Martini made him realize that great artists are destined not to be recognized, and that talent alone does not pay: Martini, perhaps the greatest sculptor of his era, had become so disillusioned that in 1945, two years before his untimely death, he published an essay against his own métier, Scultura, lingua morta (Sculpture, a dead language). Freda always believed in predestination, and was a self-professed fatalist. Therefore, one could say that cinema was written in his future even before he knew it, and the circumstances that led him to take his ﬁrst steps in the movie business are odd to say the least: the director himself labeled them as “resembling a complicated chess match.”11 Founded in 1934 on behalf of Galeazzo Ciano, the “Direzione Generale per la Cinematograﬁa” (General Direction of Cinematography) constituted an attempt on the part of Fascism to install a thorough control over the national ﬁlm industry, and shape its output according to the propaganda needs of the regime. Ciano appointed Luigi Freddi, a former Futurist, then the editor and special correspondent of the newspaper founded by Mussolini himself, Il Popolo d’Italia, as General Director. “This young man had all the qualities that the Duce lacked: he was a womanizer, drank only champagne and always won at poker. I am certain that Mussolini secretly admired him,” Freda recalled.12 On his part, he obviously did, as Freddi’s lifestyle would become his own for the best part of his life. During the highs and lows of his ﬁlm career, Freda always treated himself to the very best—women, cars, houses, the good life—, to the point of accepting a white Rolls Royce as payment for making a Western he did not care the least bit about, as Yves Boisset recalled.13 When Ciano entrusted Freddi as General Director, the latter gathered a small group of people to write down the organization’s statute. He asked his friend Esodo Pratelli to give him a hand, and the artist called aboard two more friends: another painter, Guglielmo Usellini, and Riccardo Freda. The gathering of two painters and a sculptor—admittedly quite an unusual aggregation for such a job—to write down the statute resulted in a linguistic misunderstanding that plagued Freda for a lifetime: many journalists, historians and even his own biographers wrote that he had sculpted the statues at the General Direction of Cinematography.14\n\n1. A Portrait of the Filmmaker as a Young Man\n\n19\n\nIn writing the statute, Freddi (who had met D. W. Griﬃth during a trip to the States, where he became interested in the production aspects of moviemaking) and his acolytes took inspiration from the Russian ﬁlm industry. “Our production does not bother to deﬁne and create an Italian type of ﬁlm, to look for a peculiar originality, a seal of nobleness, a sure warrancy of success,” the journalist wrote to Mussolini, thus listing the basic idea that Italian ﬁlms would have to convey: the aesthetic and ethical education of the masses, the conveyance of the ideas and principles of the Italian nation, the demonstration of its people’s intellectual, moral, artistic, and political potential.15 Therefore, through the General Direction of Cinematography, the Fascist State would intervene directly in national ﬁlm production, focusing on its regulation on all fronts, from the economic facilities to a strict censorial activity that contemplated the prior reading of the scripts and demanded that each completed motion picture be submitted to a board of censors. The rule book to which the board conformed its actions (instituted in 1923) would remain operative until 1962, when the new law on censorship was passed—which speaks volumes about the way censorship operated long after the fall of the regime in the post–World War II years.16 In Freda’s opinion, however, Mussolini basically just wanted Italian cinema to be a showcase for the regime, an idea best embodied by Scipione l’Africano (a.k.a. Scipio Africanus: The Defeat of Hannibal, 1937, Carmine Gallone), the big-budget peplum on the Ancient Roman general who defeated Hannibal’s army, which portrayed Rome’s ancient glory with patent references to the present. Similarly, Freddi’s idea was to develop the Italian ﬁlm industry without turning it into a propaganda machine the way Goebbels had done in Germany, as proven by an ill-fated project that should have involved the director of the legendary Cabiria, Giovanni Pastrone. Before the shooting of Scipione l’Africano, which had to be the glory of Fascism, Freddi had thought of Pastrone to make a ﬁlm. It was a symbolic enterprise, because Pastrone has made Italian cinema shine before the whole world. We had proposed him to adapt a baroque Polish novel [possibly The Manuscript Found in Saragossa by Jan Potocki]…. No one has heard of this project because it aborted. Pastrone was old and disillusioned. After one month, Freddi gave up to this project of prestige. And me, without ever having to decide anything, I seconded and followed Freddi in my new career.17\n\nIn Rome, for a while, Freda immersed himself in the realm of bureaucracy. Despite not being enrolled in the Fascist party, he had a vantage position at the Oﬃce of Tourism, where he took care of propaganda and advertising until 1937, a year that marked a turning point for Italian cinema and for his own career in it. The regime’s reshaping and boosting of the national ﬁlm industry—under the slogan “Il cinema è l’arma più forte” (“Cinema is the strongest weapon”)—also included the opening of Rome’s Centro Sperimentale di Cinematograﬁa (Experimental Film Center, the State’s oﬃcial ﬁlm school which, despite what some sources claim, Freda never attended18); the Venice Festival becoming an annual event, with the Coppa Mussolini (Mussolini Cup) being awarded to the best Italian ﬁlm as well as to the best foreign one; the incorporation of the educational Istituto Luce (founded in 1924) under the Ministry for Popular Culture and Propaganda (MinCulPop); and the creation of Enic—Ente Nazionale per le Industrie Cinematograﬁche (National Entity for Film Industries). Then, in April 1937, came the opening of Cinecittà—the largest ﬁlm studio in the country, a real “city of cinema” risen just outside Rome. That same year, Riccardo Freda had his ﬁrst experience in ﬁlmmaking. Perhaps it was indeed written in destiny.\n\n2 Learning the Craft Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here: The Early Comedies Freda’s ﬁrst steps in the movie business were the result of his acquaintance with Raffaele Colamonici, one of those larger-than-life characters who were often to be found within the Italian ﬁlm industry. A former actor under the alias Guido Di San Giusto (later Guido Saint-Just), Colamonici had eventually become a production manager: according to Freda, he was a real guappo, that is aﬃliated with the Camorra.1 Which, considering that most Italian producers acted as ﬁlibusters when it came to collecting money for a movie (or not paying creditors their due), could even be true after all. Colamonici entrusted Freda with his ﬁrst scriptwriting job, the adaptation of a 1936 play by Athos Setti: also known as La fortuna si diverte (Luck Has Fun), it would become a pièce de résistance in Eduardo De Filippo’s repertory, under the title Sogno di una notte di mezza sbornia (A Middrunkenness Night’s Dream, turned into a ﬁlm in 1959). The result was a very simple and unpretentious ﬂick, Lasciate ogni speranza (Abandon All Hope, 1937), directed by Gennaro Righelli, the ﬁrst in a series of “small comedies without any importance,”2 as Freda would later dismiss them, on which he worked, that nevertheless were very popular back then. He and Colamonici would team up together again in the late 1940s on Il conte Ugolino—curiously, a ﬁlm based on Dante’s Inferno, which the title of Righelli’s comedy evokes (“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!” is the inscription at the entrance of Hell in Dante’s poem), the swashbuckler Il ﬁglio di d’Artagnan and the World War I drama La leggenda del Piave (1952). Freda claimed to have scripted Lasciate ogni speranza with his friend Edoardo Antonelli (1910–1986), whose name is not mentioned in the credits. Antonelli, who regularly employed the alias Edoardo Anton, had been Freda’s classmate at the lyceum, and one of the causes of the latter’s growing interest in magic and the supernatural, which can be detected in this ﬁlm as well. Starring the popular stage actor Antonio Gandusio (1873–1951) and the Italian-Argentinian beauty María Denis (1916–2004),3 Lasciate ogni speranza centers on destiny and predestination, a recurring theme in Freda’s subsequent work. When the numbers he played at a lottery following a nightmare (which depicted the exact time of his death) prove to be winning, the protagonist starts fearing that the dreamed events will become real, giving way to a series of mildly comical events and misunderstandings. Interestingly, Freda reprised the idea of the opening nightmare in his third feature ﬁlm, Tutta la città canta (1945). As for the director, the Neapolitan Gennaro Righelli (1886–1949), a veteran ﬁlmmaker who had been making movies since the early days of silent cinema, Freda recalled 20\n\n2. Learning the Craft\n\n21\n\nthat he lived alone at the Hotel Majestic in Rome, in a room literally clouded with cigarette smoke, where the scriptwriting meetings took place. Righelli belonged to that group of directors who became popular after World War I (Genina, Gallone, Camerini…), and he had very precise and somewhat dated ideas on ﬁlmmaking. For instance, he rejected American-style screenplays and required the so-called “dicing.” What does it mean? Simple. A man and a woman are talking, then there is a cut and we see him taking the train to Paris, and the dialogue will later explain this fact: that’s an American-style script. The dicing consists in depicting their encounter, their goodbye and then the man leaving to the train station. According to Righelli, the audience could understand only this second solution, otherwise they would be lost. These directors had an analytical mentality and refused modern editing (for instance, Godard would have caused them an apoplectic ﬁt).4\n\nThe second of the six ﬁlms Freda wrote for the proliﬁc Righelli (who directed no less than 20 ﬂicks over a six year period in the mid–1930s) was again a comedy of errors. Fuochi d’artiﬁcio (Fireworks, 1938) was based on a stage play centered around an old-hat premise which Freda reprised in Tutta la città canta. He despised this kind of fatuous, vapid comedy, and his contribution was, as in other similar occurrences, a mere workfor-hire job. Critics were not kind either, and compared unfavorably the result with its source: “Too bad that the ﬁlm is not enough ﬁreworks, that is it somewhat lacks those sparkling, crackling, brilliant qualities … the acting is resolute and rickety, which (strangely) in movies is often the result of haste.”5 L’allegro cantante (The Merry Singer, 1938)—not to be confused with the movie of the same name directed in Germany the following year by Carmine Gallone—was also based on a play (by Luigi Chiarelli, who co-write the script with Freda and Righelli) and featured the recurring elements of the comedies made in Italy during that period, the so-called “Telefoni bianchi,”6 such as the high society setting, and the overly optimistic feeling that makes the story more similar to a modern fairytale, as any attempt at realism is carefully bypassed. Nevertheless, the result lacks the qualities of others and livelier telefoni bianchi ﬁlms, such as those directed by Mario Camerini. The young protagonist (Giovanni Manurita) was a singer, allowing for the inclusion of a couple of song numbers (Canta che ti passa and Presentimento), while the comic relief was provided by the De Rege brothers, who also played supporting roles in Lasciate ogni speranza. Guido and Giorgio De Rege were the typical vaudeville comic duo, with the elder (Guido) playing the stooge and the younger (Giorgio) acting as the funny man. Their comedy leaned on verbal wordplay that often veered on the absurd, with Giorgio specializing as a stuttering type. Their popularity came to an abrupt halt during the war: Guido de Rege died in early 1945, near the end of the conﬂict, and Giorgio replaced him with Carlo Dapporto; however, the second De Rege brother also met an untimely death a few years later, in 1948, while performing on stage. Their repertoire was picked up in the 1950s on television by Carlo Campanini and Walter Chiari, who reprised the De Rege’s comic leitmotif, the phrase “Vieni avanti, cretino!” (“Come forward, you idiot!”).7 Righelli’s assistant director was Filippo Walter Ratti, who would then embark on a nondescript directorial career on his own and whose path again crossed Freda’s over thirty years later, on the ill-fated Estratto dagli archivi segreti della polizia di una capitale europea. Freda recalled an anecdote about the ﬁlm which spoke volumes about the amateurishness with which the Cinecittà crews and technicians were moving their early steps. For a scene which borrowed from a classic moment in Charlie Chaplin’s The Circus (1928), Giorgio De Rege had to perform a gag that required him to be locked inside a cage with\n\n22\n\nRICCARD O FREDA\n\na lion: the animal would be kept separated from the actor by an invisible glass panel in the middle of the cage. The crystal was, according to the special effects technician, “bulletproof.” However, De Rege was not at all convinced about the trick, and demanded that a rehearsal be made with the lion alone. Righelli obliged. As soon as the animal entered the cage, he approached the glass, sniffed it … and broke it into pieces by simply leaning its paw on it.8 Next came La voce senza volto (The Faceless Voice, 1939), yet another telefoni bianchi comedy focused on a poor but very talented young singer (a character that Freda would recycle in his second ﬁlm as a director, Non canto più, 1945) which took place in the movie business, just like a number of other works of the era—La signora di tutti (1934, Max Ophüls), Inventiamo l’amore (1938, Camillo Mastrocinque), Due milioni per un sorriso (1939, Carlo Borghesio, Mario Soldati), Dora Nelson (1940, Mario Soldati). A reviewer of the period commented that “the story, which looks like so many others, becomes interesting because of the environment in which it takes place, the ﬁlm world ﬁlled with hysterical divas, big-bellied superstars and neurasthenic directors….” 9 There are curious similarities with Singin’ in the Rain (1952), starting with the idea of the unknown singer’s voice replacing the titular one; however, the self-reﬂexive scenery here seems mostly an excuse to display the modernity and eﬃciency of the Cinecittà studios, inaugurated in April 1937. Righelli’s camera explores the sets, corridors and cafeteria, all swarming with extras, with plenty of serpentine long takes and tracking shots, exuding a visible relish in showing off the marvels of a seemingly top-notch ﬁlm industry intent on fabricating lavish musicals for the masses (as opposed to period ﬁlms: “We don’t like that type of movies,” one character says—a line perhaps coming from Freda’s sharp pen). As customary with Italian ﬁlms of the era, La voce senza volto paints an optimistic picture of Italy as an ideal country where everybody is happy and smiling: “Everyone here sings,” comments the caretaker in the shipyard where Gino works, and a scene shows the workers leaving the site on their bikes, all singing in unison with the protagonist. Despite Righelli’s pride in showing the wonders of Cinecittà, the scene is ﬁlmed via a crude back projection. The script was co-written by Freda and Corrado D’Errico (1902–1941), a former critic and correspondent for the LUCE newsreels, who also directed a dozen movies before his untimely death, including a couple of posthumous swashbucklers adapted from Emilio Salgari novels, Capitan Tempesta (1942, completed by Umberto Scarpelli) and Il leone di Damasco (1942, completed by Enrico Guazzoni), which displayed all the shortcomings of Italian adventure ﬁlms of the period, such as the blatant Fascist propaganda applied to genre cinema and the slapdash dueling scenes, only slightly camouﬂaged by Massimo Terzano’s expert cinematography. As in L’allegro cantante, the lead is played by Giovanni Manurita (1895–1984), a very popular tenor who embarked on a brief movie career: La voce senza volto (in which he sings the number Ultimo bolero) was his third and last ﬁlm. He is surrounded by a number of very good voice actors (such as Carlo Romano and Romolo Costa) in supporting roles. Due to soundtrack damage, the circulating Italian print is a hodgepodge, as the original dubbing is often replaced with recently redubbed scenes that feature debatably modernized dialogue: it is very unlikely that in 1939 a German character would be heard uttering the word “Scheisse” (shit) on ﬁlm, let alone an Italian one. Freda’s ﬁfth stint as a scriptwriter for Gennaro Righelli, Il barone di Corbò (The Baron of Corbò, 1939), was a forgettable farce, based on the 1929 stage play of the same\n\n2. Learning the Craft\n\n23\n\nname by Luigi Antonelli, Edoardo’s father. The starting point—in a villa in the countryside, a man and his family are terrorized by the news of lunatics escaped from a nearby hospital, and start suspecting that one of their guests, the alleged “Baron of Corbò,” is one of them—draws from the typical “old dark house” comedy-horror ﬁlms and stage plays, and the idea of the lunatics passing themselves off as doctors was likely inspired by Edgar Allan Poe’s The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Feather, to spice up the predictable game of misunderstandings, fake identities and unfunny gags. Righelli’s direction does not do much to overcome the overall staginess, and the characters are hopelessly dull, with the exception of Armando Migliari, as a would-be unfaithful husband oppressed by his wife and three daughters, whose secret rendezvous with his mistress is ruined by a series of unfortunate circumstances. Around the same period, Freda did uncredited work as ﬁlm doctor on Fascino (Fascination, 1939), the only movie role of Italian soprano singer Iva Pacetti, a monumentallooking lady who was very popular in Italy and abroad at that time. He told Giuseppe Tornatore: The ﬁlm had been ﬁnanced by … the owner of a big hotel in Rome and the lover of this elephantine woman…. This ﬁlm was horrendous and at a certain point they asked me if I could [sort it out]? “The only way to sort it out is to throw it down the toilet,” I said, “but seeing that you insist, I could give you some advice, but I’m not ﬁlming anything.” There’s only one scene worthy of this name and that’s the ﬁre scene, that’s come out pretty well. I said: “Use the ﬁre scene at least three times during the ﬁlm.” “And how on earth are we going to do that?” “Well, I mean, let’s say the ﬁlm starts with the ﬁre scene, the public’s curiosity is already aroused. Then, later on one of the characters remembers … the ﬁre! And at the end, again … the ﬁre!” … It was still a load of shit, but in the end it managed to get released because of the ﬁre scene.”10\n\nYoung Adventurers Freda’s ﬁrst important scriptwriting credit, Piccoli naufraghi (Shipwrecked Boys, 1939) was one of the ten motion pictures announced right after the proclamation of the Fascist colonial empire, on March 9, 1936, following the end of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. In spite of the blatant propaganda undertones, and a view of adolescence in tune with Fascism’s emphasis on team spirit and physical ﬁtness, director Flavio Calzavara’s ﬁlm debut was a peculiar work in the national production of the period, being one of the ﬁrst movies centered almost exclusively on children—although not the very ﬁrst as Freda claimed, since in 1935 an adaptation of Ferenc Molnar’s classic novel The Boys of via Paal had been helmed by Alberto Mondadori and Mario Monicelli. However, due to its exotic setting and unusual story—a group of kids embark clandestinely on a boat and shipwreck on a desert island, which turns out to be the lair of a gang of arms smugglers—Piccoli naufraghi has the feel of Freda’s beloved popular adventure novels for children. “I like the company of kids very much,” enthused the notoriously misanthropic ﬁlmmaker, and I used to follow their adventures through Mark Twain or Dickens, Stevenson, as well as Collodi and Pinocchio … furthermore, American cinema loved to put kids on scene…. I have always loved smart kids and those who had the taste of adventure as well as of danger: Huckleberry Finn, the intrepid Oliver Twist … but I could not transpose them into Italian cinema.11\n\nOne wonders what an Italian version of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn or an adaptation of Dickens’ masterpiece might have been in Freda’s hands.\n\n24\n\nRICCARD O FREDA\n\nAs opposed to his often poor opinion of grown-up actors, Freda always claimed that he was much more at ease directing children, whose frankness and spontaneity allowed him to achieve convincing results with minimal advice on his part. However, the dozen of teens co-starring in Piccoli naufraghi are all rather clumsy-looking, actingwise, and despite several amusing bits the ﬁlm itself suffers from a rather schematic script. At one point, when conﬂict ensues between the two factions of the young shipwrecked, it almost seems that Piccoli naufraghi is turning into something predating Lord of the Flies, but the impression is soon to be contradicted. The appearance of the arms smugglers pushes the story closer to Robert Luis Stevenson’s Treasure Island, while keeping in with the regime’s need for propaganda: the villains deal with the Negus, Ethiopia’s monarch. The ﬁlm’s best qualities pertain to its fascinating exteriors, ﬁlmed at the Isola of Giglio, off the coast of Tuscany. Whether Freda actually had a hand in the direction is unclear, as he contradicted himself on several occasions: he claimed he did collaborate with Calzavara when interviewed by Stefano Della Casa,12 and mentioned the fact in passing in his memoir as well, 13 but vehemently denied this (and even his participation as co-scriptwriter) with Éric Poindron.14 However, he temporarily acted as cameraman and had a vital role in allowing Aldo Tonti (the still photographer on the set) to make his ﬁlm debut after the director of photography Arturo Gallea fell ill. As Tonti recalled, “My debut scene as operator-inchief was quite a complex take: a very long dolly shot…. I rehearsed the camera movement, placed the lights and mirrors, then shot the scene without hesitation. The director looked as he was about to boggle. After the ﬁrst take, he asked me how the scene had turned out. “Excellent!” I said. Since he was used at shooting ﬁve or six takes for each scene, my “Excellent” sounded to him like a true challenge … seeing that I showed no sign of wanting to do other takes…. Calzavara curtly ordered to stop shooting…. The footage I shot left toward Rome. Forty-eight hours later the developed ﬁlm was back on the island together with a projector, so that the result of that job that I prematurely labeled as excellent would be screened to the director. And excellent it was indeed.”15 On Piccoli naufraghi, Freda even made one of his rare appearances as an actor, under the a.k.a. Riccardo Santelmi, and for once without his inseparable glasses, in a small supporting role. Amusingly, for a man who claimed that he “always hated every kind of school, under any form,”16 he played the boys’ benevolent and inspirational Latin professor, Giannini, who embarks on a liner to Oceania to meet a sad destiny. “I was asked to play other acting roles,” he proudly boasted, “and even in a ﬁlm alongside Doris Duranti!17 It was in this period that I thought it would be better to leave administration aside and move on to ﬁlmmaking practice.” Freda’s claims seem to be the product of his imperishable self-esteem, though, as he has very little screen time in the movie: almost all his lines are declaimed off-screen, and even his death scene takes place accordingly, suggesting that perhaps Calzavara was not too convinced of his acting chops. Freda also took care of the editing, together with Ferdinando Maria Poggioli, one of the most brilliant and underrated directors in Italian cinema, and the author of such minor masterpieces as Gelosia (1942) and Il cappello da prete (1944). The Italian title was changed to Piccoli Avventurieri (Little Adventurers) from the original Piccoli naufraghi (Shipwrecked Boys) for the ﬁlm’s ethnic language-house release in the United States. A copy is kept at the Library of Congress Film Study Center in Culpeper, Virginia.\n\n2. Learning the Craft\n\n25\n\nOf Knights, Duchesses and Fallen Stars… Coming after a string of nondescript comedies and farces, Il cavaliere di San Marco (a.k.a. The Knight of San Marco, 1939) was a change of pace for Gennaro Righelli: a period drama which was certainly more in tune with Freda’s sensibility and taste, since the plot had all the typical staples of the swashbuckling ﬁlms he admired so much. Its rereading of the Italian Risorgimento (Resurgence), the period that led to the uniﬁcation of the country in 1861, is an attempt at portraying Italian history in an interesting light, more akin to popular novels than to Alessandro Blasetti’s exemplary 1860 (1934). Freda—who co-scripted it with Alessandro De Stefani, Gherardo Gherardi, Edoardo Anton and future ﬁlm director Renato Castellani—would recycle several plot points in his later ﬁlms: the inn scene, with the encounter between the protagonist and the woman who turns out to be in cahoots with the enemy, predates Don Cesare di Bazan (1942), whereas the theme of hero’s brother being unjustly imprisoned will return in Il cavaliere misterioso; last but not least, the elusive “Knight of San Marco,” the mysterious head of the patriots, hints at such legendary popular heroes as Black Eagle. However, the results are so stagey and talky that they perfectly sum up the dusty approach to the adventure genre from which Freda would sweep away with his debut. Reviewers were not kind either: “What a haughtiness and pomposity in this adventure ﬁlm, and what stuffed characters, what silly puppets! … When Italian cinema attempts to be magniﬁcent, serious trouble ensues. Behind those fake golden frames one can feel the phoniness and the ostentatious from a mile away.”18 Freda’s next assignment as a scriptwriter, In campagna è caduta una stella (a.k.a. In the Country Fell a Star, 1939), marked the directorial debut of the renowned Neapolitan stage actor Eduardo (here credited as “Edoardo”) De Filippo. Eduardo was also the producer, together with his brother Peppino, who had written the 1932 play on which the ﬁlm was based. Besides helping him adapt the play for the screen, Freda would also have to act as a technical supervisor to the direction, since De Filippo had no ﬁlmmaking experience whatsoever: in fact, Freda is credited as “collaborator to the director.” However, after some time spent working together on the screenplay, his relationship with Eduardo deteriorated during the shooting, since the egocentric De Filippo stubbornly refused each and every word of advice his collaborator would give him. Eduardo also had a tormented working relationship with his brother Peppino, who co-starred in the ﬁlm, and often treated him in a rough manner—so much so that Peppino often broke out in tears while conﬁding Freda his frustration for his brother’s attitude, as they drove back home together from the set. Over the years the De Filippo brothers went separate ways. Eduardo would be celebrated as one of Italy’s greatest stage actors and playwrights, and often appeared in ﬁlms, most memorably in Vittorio De Sica’s L’oro di Napoli (The Gold of Naples, 1954). He also directed a number of critically acclaimed pictures (such as 1950s Napoli milionaria and 1954’s Questi fantasmi). On the other hand, Peppino would become one of Totò’s recurrent partners on screen. In addition to the De Filippo brothers, the female lead was played by the Canadianborn Rosina Lawrence—best known for her role as Mary Roberts in the Laurel & Hardy vehicle Way Out West (1937)—who had been sent to Italy by producer Hal Roach, for a movie adaptation of Rigoletto that did not materialize. Shooting took place at Tirrenia Studios, during a troubled period: news came that the war was about to start, which sent Lawrence into panic. She often burst into ﬁts of crying for fear of being stuck in Italy\n\n26\n\nRICCARD O FREDA\n\nbecause of the ongoing conﬂict. Filming was brieﬂy interrupted in August 1939 and resumed a few weeks later, with makeshift means; meanwhile the actress had returned overseas. In campagna è caduta una stella was released in Naples, De Filippo’s hometown, in November 1939, whereas it was distributed in the rest of Italy in the spring of 1940, to tepid reviews: “The De Filippo brothers have never been employed cinematically as they deserved: however, after this ﬁrst sample, I think they will better put themselves in the hands of people of the movie business,” one critic wrote.19 The ﬁlm was not released in the United States until 1950. By then, Lawrence had long retired acting: De Filippo’s had been her ﬁnal ﬁlm. Freda returned to scripting comedies with La granduchessa si diverte (The Grand Duchess Has Fun, 1940). A tale in the vein of Viennese operettas and Lubitsch’s ﬁlms, and with nods to the Billy Wilder-scripted Ihre Hoheit beﬁehit (a.k.a. Her Grace Commands, 1931, Hanns Schwarz), it was set in an imaginary Mitteleuropean state and based on an identity swap that owed to Mark Twain’s The Prince and the Pauper and Anthony Hope’s The Prisoner of Zenda. It was Giacomo Gentilomo’s third feature ﬁlm. Gentilomo (1909–2001) went on to a respected career within the realm of popular cinema, from melodrama (La cieca di Sorrento, a.k.a. The Blind Woman of Sorrento, 1952) to peplum (Maciste contro il vampiro, a.k.a. Goliath and the Vampires, 1961). After giving up directing, he focused on painting, with remarkable results. Besides the typical game of misunderstandings, La granduchessa si diverte features a number of humorous sideswipes to the regime—such as the caricatured bureaucrats or the grand duchess’ habit of addressing her interlocutors with “voi” (a rule imposed by the regime to ﬁght “bourgeois servilism”20)—which may well be the result of the uncredited contribution to the script on the part of the young Mario Monicelli, who was also the assistant director.21 He and Freda would team up again several years later, for some of the director’s most interesting ﬁlms. Compared to Gentilomo’s sprightly effort, Cento lettere d’amore (One Hundred Love Letters, 1940, Max Neufeld) marked for Freda a return to the routine, nondescript comedies he had been involved in so far. In the hands of a director like Max Ophüls, the story—one hundred compromising love letters sent by a married woman to her lover are found by her husband’s secretary, whose wife in turn believes the missives were addressed to her spouse, leading to a series of misunderstandings—would have sparkled, whereas Neufeld turned it into the umpteenth light farce, populated with vapid characters. Freda’s comment on the Austrian-born director—70 ﬁlms directed between 1919 and 1957—was curt: “Neufeld was an unpleasant man and he didn’t understand a thing about cinema.”22 Notte di fortuna (Lucky Night, 1941, Raffaello Matarazzo) was, after Quei due (1935, Gennaro Righelli), Peppino De Filippo’s attempt at a comic career of his own, detached from his brother Eduardo’s overwhelming shadow. The story was far from original, and openly drew from French and American models, but for the ﬁrst time it allowed Peppino to let his comic skills loose. In the ﬁlm, he plays a pharmacist’s clerk who wins a huge sum of money at the San Remo casino with the help of a mysterious woman, but then loses all at the very last gamble. Back in his village, however, everyone thinks he has become a billionaire…. The theme of the man gambling all his money in San Remo was not new to Freda, whose early sculptor master Attilio Prendoni had lost all his fortune at the green table. He himself would be a passionate gambler throughout his life. The ﬁlm marked Freda’s ﬁrst collaboration with Raffaello Matarazzo, one of the unsung masters of Italian popular cinema, who literally started a new trend after the\n\n2. Learning the Craft\n\n27\n\nsuccess of his melodrama Catene (1949) paved the way for a whole season of tearjerking dramas. Freda was good friends with Matarazzo, and often praised his merits as a ﬁlmmaker, even at a time where the latter’s work had been long reviled by the critics, and forgotten by the public. Matarazzo’s death in 1966 came after the director had fallen into a commercial oblivion, as his later ﬁlms were badly distributed and turned out as boxoﬃce ﬂops: it was only a decade later that the critics started a critical reappraisal of his work. In many ways, and despite having set out a commercially fruitful trend such as the melodrama, Matarazzo was a man alone in post-war Italian cinema, just like Freda. However, even though he was quite at ease with comedies as well, Notte di fortuna was not one of the director’s more memorable efforts. The story had been tampered by censors (originally, it was to be set in Montecarlo, where the protagonist would take his employer’s wife), and according to Peppino De Filippo, Matarazzo even walked off the set at one point: the movie was ﬁnished by the director of photography Ugo Lombardi, who in turn was replaced as d.o.p. by the great Václav Vích. Despite its amiable quality, Notte di fortuna was rather tepidly received by the critics. A little farce, rather naively conceived…. Peppino De Filippo does his best and is often funny, but he would have been much more than that, had he put aside certain ill-fated Charlot-like references, and stuck to that homely, countrylike realism which, at least in the movies, is his true path. Matarazzo directs haphazardly, making do within the limits of a rushed production.23\n\nIn the meantime, Italy had entered World War II on Germany’s side against the “plutocratic and reactionary democracies of the West.” On June 10, 1940, on the balcony of Piazza Venezia in Rome, Mussolini announced the news to the population, in a short and emotional speech. “The hour, marked by fate, has come,” the Duce declared, wrongly believing that the conﬂict would end soon, allowing him to take part in the peace negotiations as a winner. This did not seem to affect the movie industry: Cinecittà was still churning out ﬁlms that mostly seemed blissfully detached from their time.\n\nThe Elica Film Years A vital moment in Freda’s career came when the 31-year-old scriptwriter got in touch with two Southern gentlemen, Francesco Curato and a partner of his by the name of Carbone, who had been convinced to try their hand at producing a ﬁlm on the great Italian painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1578–1610) by a certain Renato Angiolillo. Needless to say, the inexperienced beginners had seen the expense account rise higher and higher, as the budget kept swelling like a souﬄé. When he met the pair of aspiring producers, Freda asked them carte blanche: he was well aware of the way the ﬁlm’s executive producer was inﬂating the costs for his own personal advantage, and his remedies were drastic. “I took the helm of that boat that was leaking from all sides, and applied a strict administrative supervision: the effect was that all, and I mean all the people in the production crew, from Angiolillo to the last production secretary, left on the spot since they found it unbearable that someone would question their honesty.”24 Shot in 1940 and released early the following year, Caravaggio, il pittore maledetto was the ﬁrst fruit of the production company Elica Film, and perhaps the closest to Freda’s idea of ﬁlmmaking, as it told the troubled life of Caravaggio as a lurid adventure drama. It was one of several pictures made in those years about famous painters of the past,\n\n28\n\nRICCARD O FREDA\n\nwhose lives were the basis for dramatic or adventurous stories: examples were Un’avventura di Salvator Rosa (a.k.a. An Adventure of Salvator Rosa, 1939, Alessandro Blasetti) and La fornarina (1944, Enrico Guazzoni), as well as Il bravo di Venezia (1941, Carlo Campogalliani), which featured scenes in the workshop of Paolo Veronese. Freda and his fellow scriptwriters were not shy when it came to ﬂeshing out Caravaggio’s life with a little bit of historical fabrication: for one thing, the painter was never appointed a Knight of Malta as the ﬁlm shows. Caravaggio was played by Amedeo Nazzari, who later starred in the director’s 1951 melodrama Il tradimento (Passato che uccide). Freda had a taste of the actor’s vain and spoiled behavior on set. Nazzari, then Italy’s most popular thespian, was ﬂabbergasted by the fact that in the ﬁlm Caravaggio did not embrace and kiss any woman—something which, he feared, would put his career at risk. The female lead was Clara Calamai, one of the great divas of the Fascist regime: the next year she would cause a controversy by brieﬂy exposing her breast—the ﬁrst nude scene in an Italian ﬁlm—in Alessandro Blasetti’s La cena delle beffe (a.k.a. The Jester’s Supper, 1942), and then would play alongside Massimo Girotti in Luchino Visconti’s masterpiece Ossessione (a.k.a. Obsession, 1943). Over thirty years later she would turn up again in yet another unforgettable role, in Dario Argento’s Profondo rosso (a.k.a. Deep Red, 1975). In the opening titles of Caravaggio, il pittore maledetto, Freda receives a special credit, which states that he “has collaborated to the making of the ﬁlm.” Indeed, his involvement was on various fronts. Besides acting as executive producer, he worked on the art direction, and created a maquette of the port of Ostia, replete with docks, galleons and goods. Freda later claimed: “I gave Alessandrini a very precise outline of work and he, despite such authoritarism, was always a good friend.”25 Goffredo Alessandrini (1904– 1978), then Anna Magnani’s partner, was an offbeat character. Born in Egypt, like Freda, after working with Alessandro Blasetti he became a popular director of telefoni bianchi comedies and then of propaganda war dramas such as Cavalleria (1936), Luciano Serra Pilota (1938, starring Nazzari) and Abuna Messias (1942). His post–World War II output was equally interesting, with such works as L’ebreo errante (1947, based on Eugène Sue’s novel and starring Vittorio Gassman) and Camicie rosse (1952), on Italian Resurgence. Freda’s efforts were such that not only Caravaggio, il pittore maledetto was completed on schedule, but it was also a good commercial success and saved Elica Films from bankruptcy. The critics were also unusually kind for a ﬁlm of this type: Scriptwriters and writers haven’t always seen the true dramatic line of this character, and here and there have impoverished him with useless or scarcely signiﬁcant episodes; however, the ﬁlm is staged with great wealth of resources, and it is exquisitely made, especially in the indoor scenes. Alessandrini has framed these scenes … with results that one would often be tempted to call Caravaggiolike.26\n\nAfter Caravaggio, Freda took part (uncredited) as production supervisor on other titles ﬁnanced by Elica Film: Dove andiamo signora? (1942, Gian Maria Cominetti), Musica proibita (1942, Carlo Campogalliani) and possibly the Italian-Spanish co-production Buongiorno, Madrid! a.k.a. Madrid de mis sueños (1942, Gian Maria Cominetti, Max Neufeld), although he later denied having taken part in the latter.27 However, the best ﬁlm he collaborated to during this period was "
