        "text": "This is one odd duck of a banger for me. It has all the qualities of your standard boilerplate giallo, yet somehow manages to stand apart from the pack and see eye to eye with the greats of Argento and Martino and the like.\n\nThe black gloved killer, the shadowy phone calls, the hypersexualized murders (have knives ever seemed more phallic?), the excessive nudity, the Morricone score—it’s all been, quite literally, done to death. But the plotlines of most gialli eventually hit a fork in the road where they must choose between being either serious or ridiculous, and the vast majority of the classics we know usually veer towards the latter; however, instead of offering the reveal of some…\n\nA catholic schoolgirl is murdered. The prime suspect is the girl's Italian / gym coach. Case closed, right? Naw, what fun would that be? The teacher, has an alibi. His alibi? Another schoolgirl he's trying to shag. So starts the mystery, and when it's all said and done, will justice be served?\n\nNow, this was fun! Fabio Testi plays the suave Italian teacher. He's like Ben Affleck in Gone Girl, but wears a pimp tracksuit and sports a sporty beard. The seriousness in his eyes, ain't no joke. I always enjoy Fabio, but this might be my new favorite role from him.\n\nI love giallo. The unknown killer. The black glove. The black outfit. The hand on the phone. The…\n\nHedonistic coed sex gangs, Fabio Testi’s beard, and back-alley abortions are front and center in this sleazy, disturbing, and quite frankly essential giallo that takes a right hand turn down perversion street.\n\nWhat Have You Done to Solange features Fabio Testi as the “hero” phys-ed teacher, Enrico, who's romantically involved with a student, who attends the school he’s employed at. As the film begins we see Enrico and said student, Elizabeth, beingvery affectionate to each while boating on a lake, when all of the sudden she spots someone clad in black with a knife hunting down a woman. He brushes it off and the following morning He soon learns that s murder did in fact take place, as a coed from the…\n\n#Giallo\n\nAnother genius giallo title. At this point, I'm not even surprised. The eponymous Solange only gets mentioned halfway in; and instantly gains central significance. It's a tricky business. Bringing an entirely new character into the film's already tangled web and establishing her as the key to the mystery is the kind of subversion that can easily backfire. But we're talking 70s and we're talking giallo: the transition is as slick as the sweaty elegance of the decade or the 1st person POV bathtub drowning scene that twists the trademark giallo knife kill into a cozy splash in the bathtub.\n\nThe film resembles Sergio Martino's gialli in its final plot twist. The killer is more than a randomly stalking sex…\n\nAfter watching and enjoying What Have They Done to Your Daughters?, I had to go and watch this one again. Watched the Arrow Video Blu-ray.\n\n- Brand new 2K restoration of the film from the original camera negative\n\n- Original Italian and English soundtracks in DTS-HD MA Mono 1.0\n\n- Newly translated English subtitles for the Italian soundtrack\n\n- Brand new audio commentary with critics Alan Jones and Kim Newman\n\n- What Have You Done to Decency? A conversation with Karin Baal – the actress shares her thoughts on Dallamano’s classic giallo in this brand new interview\n\n- First Action Hero – a newly-edited 2006 interview with actor and former stuntman Fabio Testi, including a look at his role in…\n\nThere are obviously better movies to pick when one wants to celebrate Ennio Morricone's life, but I had been wanting to revisit this for quite some time, so why not today?\n\nI believe this is the first rewatch since my initial viewing, and the only thing I really remembered was that it had Fabio Testi and Christina Galbó in it. At one point when I was watching this, I thought I was sure of where it all was heading, but I was wrong.\n\nWHYDTS? does introduce some key elements fairly late in the game. For the most part, the movie isn't even about Solange (or is it?) It is still a solid enough Giallo though. It does get a bit…\n\nContinuing into the giallo vortex this was another film high on my watchlist. And it definitely did not disappoint. A sleazy and violent giallo with a top notch score, likeable characters and a mystery that keeps you guessing.\n\nWhat I loved about this film was the overall intensity. This is one nasty giallo. Perverse and depraved the killer does some pretehhh gross things with his knife let me tells ya... And the POV shots of the killer make you feel like you are along for the whole despicable ride!\n\nAll the female leads kill it with their performances and really portray the terror they experience. I usually don't get too attached to the lead male roles in these films but…\n\nGiallovember 2021\n\n\"There's always something that stops you from being a normal girl!\"\n\nSolange is a young female Catholic school student who isn't introduced into the story-proper until the last twenty minutes of the film, but her presence casts a shadow over the whole picture, shading it in the portentous wake of her foreboding nonexistence. Her name is a floating signifier, a name that stands collectively for all these young schoolgirls in their vulnerability and corruption, and thus the question of the film's title, What Have You Done to Solange, isn't a question merely of what one person has does to one other, but what society at large has done to girls like Solange, to the next generation of Italian…\n\nIn director Massimo Dallamano's 1974 film, What Have They Done to Your Daughters?, girls are victims twice over. First, they are commodified, bought and sold with no control over either their bodies or their sexuality. Those who buy and sell them are so rich that they bear no consequences for their actions; the only negative result is suffering on the part of their unwilling victims. And, second, girls are objectified by men they barely know who, in their heads, reshape the girls into the beings they want them to be, and then kill them the flesh and blood versions when they cannot possess them. In the film, girls are adrift, used, abused and controlled by everyone but themselves.\n\nIn 1972's What…"
