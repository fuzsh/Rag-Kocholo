        "text": "The Emplaced SelfLaura Candiotto (Italy) ParticipantsCandiotto Laura, Ghilardi Marcello, Gallagher Shaun, Malpas Jeff, Hashimoto Noriko, O'Donnell Katherine AbstractThis roundtable aims to discuss the reciprocal constitution of self and place from the perspectives of situated affectivity, phenomenology, environmental ethics and aesthetics. By challenging the dualistic assumptions of already established subjects and places, the panel contributors will explore (1) the different dimensions in which self and place co-institute each other, (2) the aesthetic practices that can enable processes of self and place co-creation, and (3) their ethical significance, in particular regarding how they reply to the “displacement” of the self at the time of the climate crisis. Origin is the goal Anthropogenesis and the Crisis of Neolithic CivilizationVincenzo Cuomo (Italy) ParticipantsDe Conciliis Eleonora, Caignard Gael, Pacilio Annamaria AbstractIl tema della crisi della civiltà comincia a inquietare la filosofia europea già nell’Ottocento, a partire dalle diagnosi di Schopenhauer e Nietzsche, fino a diventare una verità “scontata”, per quanto amara, con Spengler, Freud, Huizinga e Heidegger, per ricordare solo alcuni suoi interpreti. Nella seconda metà del Novecento, e durante i primi vent’anni del nuovo millennio, tutta la questione della crisi della civiltà si è trasformata, progressivamente, secondo due direttrici. La prima è stata, ed è ancora, quella transculturale che tende a derubricarla a crisi della civiltà “occidentale” e a esaltare le differenze culturali degli altri “mondi” extraeuropei; la seconda direttrice è quella che, all’opposto, la slarga trasformandola in crisi della civilizzazione neolitica. All'interno di questa seconda linea di ricerca si situa la questione dell'antropogenesi, che sarà oggetto del panel. Hermeneutics and Memory: Why there is no future without a pastBusacchi Vinicio (Italy) ParticipantsMura Gaspare, Agís Villaverde Marcelino, Delacroix Christian, Magni Filippo, Piazza Tommaso AbstractHuman identity is constitutively ‘historical’, as well as cultural and a narrative. History is the quintessence of us, as human beings that live in a certain epoch and within a certain culture. At the same time, different kind of scientific research reveal that the realisation of a human life is, on one hand, in a dialectical connection with the past and tradition, and is, on the other hand, a form of action under a horizon of expectation (Koselleck) and a present full of new possibilities. Referring to Koselleck’s research, Ricoeur, for example, develops the theme of historical consciousness, interpreting it as the ceaseless dialectics of counterposition between the ‘space of experience’, which is inevitably rooted into the past, and the ‘horizon of expectation’, which always addresses the future. A living present culture constitutes the point of convergence between past and future, because in the human being there is this perpetual connection between ‘space of experience’ and ‘horizont'. The Trascendental and its Metamorphoses: a Mimesis Publisher book series.Gaetano Rametta (Italy) ParticipantsRadrizzani Ives, Tamborini Marco, Seron Denis AbstractThe meeting is centred on the notion of “The Transcendental and its Metamorphoses”. Reference is made to Kant and Fichte, but particular importance is also given to the various meanings that the idea of “Transcendental” has taken in Contemporary philosophy. Attention will be given to the following traditions: 1) Neo-Kantianism and Transcendental phenomenology, from Lask and Husserl to the recent theories about consciousness, subjectivity and philosophical epistemology; 2) “Transcendental” in 20th Century French philosophy, from the young Sartre to the late writings of Deleuze; 3) possible developments of the notion of “Transcendental” with regard to Artificial Intelligence and the contemporary Philosophy of Technology. 'Sol libertà può farci forti, sagaci e lieti'. Germana Ernst e la filosofia del RinascimentoAntonella Del Prete (Italy) ParticipantsBertolini Manuel, Couzinet Dominique, De Lucca Jean-Paul, Giglioni Guido, Plastina Sandra, Ponzio Paolo, Ricci Saverio AbstractGermana Ernst ha lasciato un'impronta profonda negli studi filosofici italiani. Il suo magistero ha saputo coniugare un'inesauribile curiosità filosofica; il fiuto di un detective per la scoperta di documenti rari e preziosi; una grande abilità nell'organizzare il lavoro proprio ed altrui; una stupefacente generosità intellettuale verso gli studenti e i colleghi più giovani; la capacità di costruire e nutrire nel tempo rapporti umani e intellettuali che si trasformavano non di rado in imprese culturali, come nel caso della splendida rivista Bruniana & Campanelliana, fondata e diretta insieme a Eugenio Canone. A distanza di otto anni dalla sua scomparsa, il panel si propone di sondare la fecondità di un pensiero che ha cambiato il volto degli studi sul Rinascimento. Tradiciones aristotélicas en la clasificación de los animales de América (principado novohispano, siglo XVI)Virginia Aspe Armella (Messico) ParticipantsGraciela Zamudio, Salvador Reyes Equiguas, Virginia Aspe Armella, María Elena García Peláez, Luis Xavier López-Farjeat, María Idoya Zorroza AbstractLa mesa abordaría la tematización de los animales en Aristóteles y sus intérpretes árabes, así como la clasificación zoológica que a partir de esto se dio más tarde en la Nueva España (especialmente en el siglo XVI). Se hablará de la descripción de las distintas especies y sus operaciones. El objetivo de la mesa es comparar las distintas tradiciones aristotélicas (clásica, árabe, latina, renacentista, novohispana) y los horizontes de comprensión que cada una abrió, en este caso, en el contexto de las investigaciones zoológicas. The Universality and Specificity of Hanese* PhilosophyShuifa Han (China) ParticipantsBeaney Michael, Sunday Grève Sebastian, Yang Haifeng, Han Linhe, Chen Jidong, Wang Jun, He Huanhuan, Sun Xiangchen, Cheng Lesong, Zhou Cheng, Bai Tongdong, Dong Ping, Chen Jianhong, Bing Wen, Li Qilin, Cao Jieyi AbstractThe strong rise and rapid development of Hanese philosophy in the twenty-first century mark a new era in philosophy, characterized by universality and specificity. Philosophy, like science, is grounded in human reason and rationality, investigating general subjects. It is a universal endeavor realized through various languages, not confined to any specific one. Therefore, universal philosophical thought requires validation across languages. Hanese philosophy, an integral part of this pursuit, shares a universal mission, engaging in diverse philosophical thinking and research within the limits of human reason. EVERYDAY AESTHETICS: STATE OF ART AND FUTURE CHALLENGESElisabetta Di Stefano (Italy) ParticipantsGiombini Lisa, Kvokacka Adrian, Ratiu Dan Eugen AbstractThis panel explores the field of everyday aesthetics, examining its theoretical foundations, current trends, and future challenges. Representing the Everyday Aesthetics Network (EVAnet), the speakers present diverse research interests and interdisciplinary perspectives within the network. The first section of the panel will analyze the current state of the field of study, focusing on the start of the network and showing the activities already promoted and organized. The second section will explore emerging themes and trends in everyday aesthetics, providing insights into interdisciplinary perspectives employed by the EVAnet community and emphasizing the collaborative nature of everyday aesthetics research. In the third and last section, the panel will showcase the diverse research interests within EVAnet. Aesthetics of Thought: a transdisciplinary perspective on philosophy from the CaribbeanDialitza Colón-Pérez (Puerto Rico) ParticipantsRamos-Riera Alejandra, Leyra-Soriano Ana María, Costa-Santos Rui, Rábanos Miguel Florián, de Pablos-Escalante Raúl, Ramos Francisco José AbstractThis workshop aims to present the philosophical trilogy Aesthetics of Thought, by the Puerto Rican philosopher Francisco José Ramos. The work focuses mostly on Aesthetics, Ancient Philosophy, Eastern and 20th-Century Philosophy, Neuroscience, Psychoanalysis, and Buddhist thought, in which philosophy is presented as a literary experiment, an artistic experience, and an exploration into the nature of aesthetics. For Ramos, aesthetics is not a branch of philosophy, but philosophy itself. This can explain that the central focus of his project is to reflect upon thought as a subject and the art of thinking with words. In this sense, writing is the scenography of thought and the laboratory of philosophical conceptualization. From there, sensitivity and intellect, the mind and the body, can come to a recognition of their mutual implications. Therefore, Aesthetics of Thought is not only an aesthetic but an ethical, political and ontological project. Bad persons: if only moral virtue was built from its antipodesRicardo Gutiérrez Aguilar (Spain) ParticipantsR. Aramayo Roberto, Kienstra Natascha, Velema Floris, Pfister Jonas AbstractSince dawn of moral reflection inquiries on behaviors were weighed in a good/right/correct/lawful fashion. Moral performances added up in value tipping the scale, constructing what is called a character. Virtues, characters, should be coherent and consistent. This is part of the well-known argument of the 1981’s Philosophy hit After Virtue, by Alasdair MacIntyre. Heroes, saints and geniuses are contradictory these very days though, even when we ignore the fact. Why is it that the focus of moral action has been always set in these and not in avoiding their counterparts? The aim of the Round Table could be summarized as the intent to answer questions such as if can wrong-doers offer a better resemblance of a solid character than their more good-natured versions? Is it this the secret of their popularity in nowadays fictions and philosophical arguments? Lastly, should we turn our theoretical-eye towards vices in Education instead of virtues to boost the present philosophical debate? International Round Table on Contributions of Chinese Philosophy to World PhilosophyAnn Pang-White (USA) ParticipantsForster Michael, Yao Xinzhong, Rošker Jana, Heurtebise Jean-Yves, Cheng Chung-Ying AbstractThe purpose of this roundtable is to continue and further inquiries and reflections on the actual and potential impact and influence of Chinese philosophy on the formation and transformation of a world philosophy in fields of logic, dialectics, metaphysics, epistemology, hermeneutics, ethics, aesthetics, and political/social philosophy. Authors have appealed to the use of methods of harmonization such as embodied in the philosophical hermeneutics and onto-hermeneutics and possibly other ways of thinking. Women in Legal Philosophy - Perspectives on Legitimacy and JusticeGiulia Battistoni (Italy) ParticipantsAlbrecht Kristin Y., Zucca-Soest Sabrina, Magni Chiara, Battistoni Giulia, Uygur Gulriz, Condello Angela AbstractThis panel responds to the congress’ mission and topic in two senses: 1. it brings together researchers from all around the world (in this case: Presidents and Ambassadors of the Society); 2. it presents philosophy as providing conceptual tools useful and even necessary to other disciplines, in this case law. Consequently, the talks will address issues like environmental justice, criminal justice, responsibility, constitutional theory, issues related to artificial intelligence, using a philosophical, critical approach. The questions of Legitimacy and Justice provide a common basis to all talks, developed from the perspectives of women doing research in legal philosophy. Note: The Panel will have 6 presentations, so I would like to ask for two slots of each 2 hours, in order to have time to present and discuss the papers, and to present SAFI - Societas Aperta Feminarum in Iuris Theoria, whose Presidents and Ambassadors are the speakers in the Panel. Philosophy Across Boundaries – A Mexican ExperienceFanny del Rio (Mexico) ParticipantsMaria de los Angeles Eraña, Erika Torres, Cintia Martínez, Lourdes Velázquez, Virginia Aspe, Fanny del Río AbstractThe Mexican Network of Women Philosophers / Red Mexicana de Mujeres Filósofas (or ReMMuF) was created in February 2020, amidst the worst pandemic the world has ever known. With lockdown measures implemented around the globe, the ReMMuF was faced with the challenge to go across boundaries: physically as well as geographically, because our mission, as well as our survival, depends on reaching out to women philosophers, including Trans and Indigenous philosophers, across the Latin American community, but also within our own country, which has always been heavily centralistic. ReMMuF has successfully reached out to women philosophers across the country, expanding the network to reach a national level, and with that in mind we also created a data base that spotlights the area of expertise and research of ReMMuF members, and started a weekly Seminar of Women Philosophers, where women from different academic backgrounds have the chance to speak about their current research topics and receive. Hegel und die Herausforderungen unserer Zeit - Facing the challenges of our time with HegelFrancesca Iannelli (Italy) ParticipantsVieweg Klaus, Ralf Beuthan, Haas Bruno AbstractWith this panel we will address the growing presence of Hegelian philosophy in our time, so much so that we can talk about a real \"Hegelian Turn in the 21st century,\" also encouraged by the discovery of un-published sources by Klaus Vieweg in the summer of 2022 in the German Library of the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising, documenting Hegelian philosophical reflection in the Heidelberg period. This discovery has brought Hegel's philosophy and its theoretical richness back to the center of debate, not only of specialists, in order to address the challenges of our time in the most diverse fields, from aesthetics to ecology, from logic to philosophy of right, to combat political extremism and cultural one-sidedness, thanks to a universalistic concept of freedom, Bildung and recognition, and thanks to a notion of care and prevention as philosophical foundation of the idea of sustainability. Social Religious EpistemologyJohn Greco (USA) ParticipantsLaura Callahan, Domingos Faria, René van Woudenberg, AbstractThe proposal is to hold a session on \"social religious epistemology,\" i.e., religious epistemology that engages recent developments in social epistemology more broadly, and especially the theme of epistemic dependence on other persons and on one's epistemic community, for example through authority and teaching structures, the transmission of knowledge via testimony, the role of trust in testimony, and the division of intellectual labor more generally. Other themes in social epistemology include the nature and role of interpersonal trust in the epistemic realm, the nature and role of social norms, and the nature and role of institutions. Seneca in Seven WordsFrancesca Romana Berno (Italy) ParticipantsMalaspina Ermanno, Pià Comella Jordi, Gazzarri Tommaso, Courtil Jean-Christophe, Edwards Catherine, Torre Chiara AbstractThe aim of the roundtable is to discuss seven key concepts in Seneca's philosophy, to show his personal interpretation of Stoic thought: voluntas - free will, deus - god, sapiens - wise person, proficiens - person in progress, vitium - passion, vita beata - happy life, animus - soul. Each concept will be illustrated starting from the reading of a significant passage. Other transversal ideas, such as fate and its correlative, i.e. (accepting) death, will emerge from the discussion. Each participant will have a 20 minutes slot, plus 15 minutes of Q/A; there will also be a final discussion. THE GLOBAL PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION PROJECT AND THE RESPONSE OF SOUTHEAST ASIAJeremiah Joven Joaquin (The Philippines) ParticipantsNagasawa Yujin, Hongladarom Soraj, Biana Hazel AbstractThe Global Philosophy of Religion Project is a major initiative that aims to make the philosophy of religion a truly global field. The philosophy of religion addresses the most fundamental issues concerning religious concepts, beliefs and practice. Among these are the existence and nature of deities, evil and suffering in the world, religious and mystical experiences, and death and the possibility of immortality. However, the scale and diversity of the current discussions of these issues have been limited, even though they are relevant to a variety of religious traditions and geographical locations. Thus, there is a need to diversify the field by looking into philosophers of religion from underrepresented regions and religious traditions in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. In this roundtable discussion, we discuss how the perspectives from Southeast Asia, particularly those from what we call “appropriated religions,” may help in this endeavour. Philosophy and Contemporary Art. Values, technologies, innovationsElisa Caldarola (Italy) ParticipantsEarley Chris, Fisher Saul, Vidmar Jovanović Iris, Tavinor Grant, Terrone Enrico, Barbero Carola, Anscomb Claire AbstractIn this panel, we highlight some values of contemporary art, in terms of topicality and innovation in expressive forms, media, and creative practices. We discuss the notion and value of contemporary art, and look at relevant contemporary art forms: socially engaged art, nonrepresentational art, VR art, and AI art. Progressive ConfucianismAnn Pang-White (USA) ParticipantsAngle Stepehn, Norden Bryan Van, Huang Yong, Cheng Cheng-Yi, Sung Hiu Chuk Winnie AbstractWhat is “Progressive Confucianism”? Is “Progressive Confucianism” a legitimate branch of Confucianism or is it simply “western ideas” dressed in Confucian clothing? In the past two decades, “Progressive Confucianism,” as opposed to “Conservative Confucianism,” has played a key role in bringing Confucianism up to date in creative and critical dialogue with contemporary concerns and movements. Confucian scholars have actively engaged with issues of gender, feminism, liberalism, democracy, social welfare, education, ritual, and morality, among others. The purpose of this panel is to continue further inquiries and reflections on new possibilities of Confucianism in the modern world and its potential in providing guidance to living a flourishing life. Epistemic injustice within and across borders: mathematics and philosophyBrendan Larvor (United Kingdom) ParticipantsPimentel Elaine, Gutiérrez Rochelle, Karsli-Calamak Elif, Tanswell Fenner, Chemla Karine AbstractWhat kind of injustice is caused by the concentration of knowledge (especially but not only mathematics) in the hands of privileged scholars and scientists at elite institutions in the global north? Most obviously this includes lack of access by scholars and disadvantaged citizens of developed countries. It might also include inequalities within such countries since some academics and peoples have more access than others to the so-called centres of excellence – perhaps scholars in privileged positions are epistemically impoverished too. Another possibility is the neglect and erasure of knowledge-cultures and traditions considered as “others” by the privileged ones. Within and across borders, who is disadvantaged by the waymathematics is taught and researched, by the way it is positioned as ethnically and politically neutral? How does reflection on epistemic justice modify our very concept of knowledge? Filosofía andina en el contexto globalMario Mejia Huamán (Perú) ParticipantsHirotaka Nakano, Mario Mejía Huamán, Fabio Sánchez, Saby Lazarte, David Esteban Espinoza, Ángela Maria Santur Arreluce, Valentinne Serpa, Kasumi Ichinose, Mg. Jorge Luis Carrera Honores AbstractEn esta mesa redonda discutiremos la posibilidad de la filosofía andina, sobre todo, su contenido y metodología. Esta reflexión es motivada por demandas extrínsecas e intrínsecas para explorar la filosofía andina como un área de investigación académica. La demanda extrínseca atiende a la reconsideración mundial del concepto de filosofía. La concepción tradicional de filosofía, basada en la producción intelectual de universidades modernas y occidentales, está puesta en duda ante nuevos problemas críticos globales. La región andina propone importantes recursos intelectuales para ampliar la “filosofía”. Atendiendo a la demanda intrínseca de territorios colonizados, filósofos y pensadores andinos buscan liberar tanto la dimensión política-económica como la mental. Así, examinaremos la propuesta de la filosofía andina como una posible respuesta a dichas demandas. Charles S. Peirce. People, Problems and Scientific Disciplines in his Time and BeyondElize Bisanz (USA) ParticipantsElize Bisanz, Susan Petrilli, Alisa Bokulich, Ernest Hess-Lüttich, Augusto Ponzio, Toni Jappy, Stephanie Schneider, Titus Lates, João Queiroz, Tullio Viola, Giovanni Maddalena AbstractPeirce’s initial formation was in the sciences, with a strong education in chemistry, physics and mathematics. His encounter with philosophy came later. He worked as a geodetic engineer for thirty years (1859-1891) and also taught logic at various universities (including Harvard and Johns Hopkins) for twenty years (1864-1884). As reflected in his life’s work and writings (published and unpublished) interdisciplinarity for Peirce was a modus vivendi, a research perspective and theoretical priority. His pragmatism evolved from his vocation for dialogue across boundaries through theory and practice, implicating the sciences, philosophy and life under different aspects. The complexity of his work emerges from a polymorphic context, with foundations in dialogue between the hard sciences, the life sciences and the human sciences. Democracy and Populism in the Digital AgeGabriele Münnix (Germany) ParticipantsBringeland Hans, Feldmann Klaus, Karageorgieva Aneta, Pozzo Riccardo, Boteva-Richter Bianca AbstractSince the emergence of the populist movement in the United States of America in the second half of the 19th century, the worldwide phenomenon of populism has been researched and assessed. Given the increasing mediatization of politics and the tendency toward \"politainment,\" media and communication studies also analyze phenomena of populism. The frame of reference, however, in this descriptive and prescriptive discourse is philosophical. Philosophers of five countries will presewnt aspects of populism and discuss consequences for educational institutions. On the one hand, it seems to be confirmed that low educational attainment increases the probability of voting for populist parties. On the other hand, it is argued that the \"half-education\" promoted in the school system, in Adorno's sense, even favors populism. It is undisputed that philosophical education, with its focus on value formation (as opposed to value teaching), has a key significance in dealing with populist phenomena. Empirical EpistemologyJack Lyons ParticipantsHilary Kornblith, Silvia De Toffoli, Madelaine Angelova-Elchinova AbstractThis round table brings together researchers from USA, Sweden, and Italy to discuss epistemology in a way that is informed and constrained by empirical research. The panel is not only interesting in its own right but it part of a larger effort to promote a nascent Empirical Epistemology Network, the point of which is to get methodologically like-minded people together, to know about each other, to elevate the visibility of empirically informed epistemology, and to provide support and inspiration to the younger generation of emerging philosophers. Late Medieval VoluntarismMonika Michałowska (Poland) ParticipantsDunne Michael W., Nannini Andrea AbstractMedieval voluntarism has already been recognized as a philosophical theory that “helped pave the way for empiricism, Cartesian doubt about the senses, legal positivism and Reformation theology” (Leftow, 1998), yet it is still regarded as a uniform movement. Recent studies have shown, however, that it was of multifarious and complex nature with various tendencies and trends. Our round table will focus on some of its themes with a special attention on those medieval authors whose voluntarism have not been so far widely studied, yet their approaches and mutual interconnections show they all contributed to the newly developed trend of the fourteenth-century Oxonian philosophy, namely Richard FitzRalph, Richard Kilvington, Robert Holcot, and John Ripa, as well as their predecessors and followers. Cross-Cultural Conceptions of 'Self' and Persistence for Global-Critical Philosophy of ReligionNathan Loewen (USA) ParticipantsHerbert Moyo, Maki Sato, Agnieszka Rostalska, Abrahim Khan, Nathan Loewen AbstractHow might philosophical studies of religion enter the globalized, 21st century? This roundtable dis-cusses how a “global-critical” approach to the philosophy of religion informs cross-cultural studies of “self.” Such an approach generates useful problems and categories to expand the scope and relevance of the field. The participants are contributors to a forthcoming volume, which is based on results from a 2022 project (see globalcritical.as.ua.edu): Herbert Moyo of South Africa, Nathan Loewen and Tim Knepper of U.S.A, Maki Sato of Japan, and Abrahim Khan of Canada. By focusing exclusively on Enlightenment concepts of the self, the field has largely avoided basic issues of incommensurable ter-minology, access to texts, and anachronistic engagements across widely divergent social-historical peri-ods. The roundtable demonstrates how dialogue based on sources from Africa, Asia, and South Asia produces novel issues by which philosophers of religion might revise their methods for reflection. Eleatism: redefining the boundaries of a Historiographical CategoryMassimo Pulpito (Italy) ParticipantsBernabé Alberto, Berruecos Frank Bernardo, Brémond Mathilde AbstractThe panel aims to investigate and reflect on a crucial passage in the history of ancient philosophy, i.e., the conceptual and historiographical definition of those thinkers who can, prima facie, be grouped under the heading of the “Eleatic School”. A. Bernabé will focus on Parmenides’ poem, examining the sets of concepts that Parmenides associates with the two paths (the path of truth and the path of opinions) and their connections. B. Berruecos will deal with the reception of Parmenides’ thought outside the traditionally recognized members of the Eleatic school, with the aim of revising the very boundaries of Eleatism beyond Presocratic philosophy in a narrow sense. M. Brémond will consider the affinities between Melissus’ philosophical approach and the sophistic method. M. Pulpito will evaluate the hypothesis that Zeno proposed a philosophical point of convergence between Parmenides and Melissus, which could serve as the foundation for an Eleatic school. Leopardi as a Philosopher - Contaminations between Literature, Science, and PhilosophyGaspare Polizzi (Italy) ParticipantsCosta Luca, Crivelli Tatiana, Landi Patrizia, Abbrugiati Perle AbstractRecent interpretations of Giacomo Leopardi's work increasingly recognize the intricate unity of his writings, paying careful attention to the evolution of his production, from his earliest childhood creations through to his later Canti. Within this complex framework, the intersections of poetic practice, philological and literary research, as well as philosophical and scientific contemplation become increasingly evident, necessitating a multi-disciplinary approach. A comprehensive understanding of Leopardi's oeuvre cannot be achieved without scrutinizing the interplay of his personal and literary relationships, and extending our perspective to the influences from and interactions with the (literary, scientific, philosophical) culture of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Roundtable on European Perspectives on Teaching Chinese PhilosophyAmbrogio Selusi (Italy) ParticipantsGeir Sigurðsson, Jana S. Rošker, Fabian Heubel, Dimitra Amarantidou, Dawid Rogacz, Carine Defoort AbstractChinese philosophy is different in Europe than in China. What it is and can be emerges in an open and multi-layered dynamic of interpretation and discussion. Historically, approaches to Chinese philosophy in European languages have varied considerably. The EACP has set up an “Educational Network” for teaching Chinese philosophy in Europe, both to connect European scholars who teach Chinese philosophy and to reflect on the question of how traditions and perspectives of engaging with Chinese philosophy differ among various European scholars. The participants of the round table will reflect upon this variety of approaches and their possible connection to their native language(s) or home place(s). The purpose of the roundtable is therefore to explore how European philosophical and intellectual traditions influence the perspectives and methods of teaching Chinese philosophy and thus shape our very understanding of what Chinese philosophy is and can be. Wissenschaft der Freyheit – Heidelberger Hegel-Nachschriften von F. W. CarovéKlaus Vieweg (Germany) ParticipantsKlaus Vieweg, Christian Illies, Francesca Iannelli, Bruno Haas, Marko Fuchs, Federica Pitillo, Gabriele Schimmenti. AbstractIn 2022 Klaus Vieweg found 5000 pages of transcripts of Hegel's lectures in Heidelberg, written by Hegel's first assistant F. W. Carové. This sensational find is to be presented by the intended German-Italian team of editors. The papers contain significant news on Hegel's Encyclopedia, on his philosophy of nature, on the philosophy of mind, and on the aesthetics and history of philosophy. Examples of the content of this very first Hegel interpretation are three new passages on the topic of recognition (master-slave) and on the theory of signs and language, as well as the first comprehensive conception ofaesthetics. The Vienna Circle at 100: The Legacy of Logical EmpiricismErnie Lepore (USA) ParticipantsSamet Bağçe, Bohang Chen, Stella Fillmore-Patrick, Silke Koerber, Sahotra Sarkar, Adam Tamas Tuboly, Thomas Uebel Abstract2024 marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Vienna Circle, a group of thinkers that launched logical empiricism, a movement which set the agenda for the philosophy of science throughout the 20th century and beyond. Members of the Vienna Circle included such well-known philosophers as Rudolf Carnap, Hans Hahn, Otto Neurath, and Moritz Schlick. The Circle had a progressive social agenda that was also a focus of resistance to the rise of fascism and Nazism, and in the late 1930s, many members were forced into exile. This panel will examine the work and legacy of the Vienna Circle from its earliest days to the present. It will reassess major and ignored figures, and explore how the political context of being left-wing immigrant exiles in the United States during the McCarthy Inquisition affected the work of Circle members and led to a loss of its focus on progressive social involvement. Naturalizzare la fenomenologia: nuove prospettiveAlberto Peruzzi (Italy) ParticipantsJocelyn Benoist; Andrea Pace Giannotta; Francesco Pisano AbstractAl crocevia fra scienze naturali e filosofia, l'impegno ventennale nella naturalizzazione della fenomenologia è ancora oggi decisivo, nel momento in cui il riconoscimento del profondo intreccio della coscienza umana con il mondo naturale si trova di fronte a domande urgenti sul significato esistenziale, epistemico ed ontologico della coscienza. Cercare di svelare questo confronto attraverso una valutazione della possibilità e dei limiti di una naturalizzazione della fenomenologia significa ottenere un accesso rigoroso e metodico a questioni quali la relazione tra coscienza e corpo, conoscenza razionale ed esperienza, ricerca trascendentale, scienza e metafisica. Il nostro panel si concentrerà sulla ricerca filosofica attuale su questi temi e suggerirà alcune direzioni per sviluppi futuri. Perception, Action and Cognition at the interfaceAlberto Peruzzi (Italy) ParticipantsAnna Borghi; Albert Neuwen; Gabriele Ferretti; Silvano Zipoli Caiani AbstractThanks to 4E cognition (embodied, embedded, enactive, extended), we came to understand that the boundaries of the mind are much more blurred than previously thought. In this picture, sensory processing, motor processing, and cognitive processing are deeply interconnected in our internal representations of the external environment. The purpose of this symposium is to put together philosophy and cognitive science in order to outline a reliable description of the universe of the mind by exploring the different crossroads where perception, action and cognition meet. Humanoid Robots as inter-religious dialogue partners: Across Lessing’s ditch?Abrahim H. Khan (Canada) ParticipantsBojan Žalec, Veronica Cibotaru, Anna Puzio, Wilhelm Danca AbstractAre humanoid robots (AI) a replacement as a conversation partner for the human relationship associated with inter-religious dialogue? Will its cognitive ability or self-learning algorithm enable it to leap across Lessing’s ditch, to move from philosophical options to theological choice? They are likely to have, write sermons, and may pave the way for spiritual counselling conversations, and possibly preaching an administering sacrament. They are hardly unimaginable, given the rapid upgrading of physical and cognitive abilities through human movement technologies of a biomedical kind. Hence, are they replacements for the human relations interaction in a spiritual counselling setting? Can empathy or grieving be digitally uploaded? These and similar questions are to be considered in the leap to become human. Kierkegaard on and across boundaries: existential, politico-social, cultural, and civilizationalAbrahim H. Khan (Canada) ParticipantsVasiliki Tsakiri, Igor Tavilla, Jizhang Yi, Paula Arizpe, Malwina A. Tkacz, András Nagy, Trans Laszlo Toth, Mirjana Medojević, Primož Repar, Andrzej Slowikowski, Bojan Žalec, Peter Kondrla, Jasna Koteska, Amber Bowen, Laura Llevolot, Cassandra Swick, Martina Pavlokava. AbstractPresentations focus on Kierkegaard relative to boundaries or thresholds crossing and tension points in contemporary life. His writings are across disciplinary boundaries: theology, philosophy, psychology, literary and cultural criticism, fiction, and drama-performance. They are communicative of existential transitioning from the aesthetic sphere towards ethico-religious subjectivity and identity formation to becoming a genuinely existing person. His thinking is also reflectively insightful for addressing contemporary cultural, political-social, and global-AI challenges. The rapid increase in knowledge and technological advances to have humanoid robots- human interactions a live option are opening new doors to revisit questions of human consciousness, personhood, and existing as a single individual for which Kierkegaard’s writings are a resource. FOUR SESSIONS The Hegelian constellations of the feminine: a chance for an inclusive BildungFrancesca Iannelli (Italy) ParticipantsStefania Achella; Eleonora Caramelli, Jean-BaptisteVuillerod; Erzsébet Rózsa; Gabriele Schimmenti; Silvia Pieroni; Chiara Magni; Mohaddeseh Rabbaninia, Rachele Lo Piano AbstractWith this panel discussion, we intend to explore with experts from the international Hegel-Forschung the Hegelian constellation of the feminine and focus on the contemporary resonances of the Hegelian conception of the role of women in the family and society; Likewise, we wish to shed light on the Hegelian demand for the emancipation of the feminine, bringing out the idea of a difference-respecting and non-sexist “Bildung”, which is the basis of the tradition of classical German Idealism. It will similarly be our intent to present the research goals we have set with the Relevant National Interest Research Project (2023-2025) funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research, which intends to realize by 2025 a hyper-archive of the Hegelian constellations of the feminine. Aesthetic theory and/in Translation practice: Challenges, intentions, outcomes of the international network Hegel Art NetFrancesca Iannelli (Italy) ParticipantsEleonora Caramelli, Jean-BaptisteVuillerod; Federica Pitillo, Gabriele Schimmenti; Giampiero Moretti, Klaus Vieweg AbstractWith this panel discussion, we intend to present the goals and first results of the International Hegel Art Net Network, as well as discuss some issues related to translation choices, political value, direct and indirect resonances, and the topicality of translating the manuscripts of Hegel's Lectures on Aesthetics. The Varieties of Justified BeliefMiguel Ángel Fernández-Vargas (Mexico) ParticipantsZalabardo José, Echeverri Santiago AbstractThis round table brings together epistemologists José Zalabardo, Santiago Echeverri and Miguel Ángel Fernández. The notion of epistemic justification, as it applies to the evaluation of belief states, figures center stage in many epistemological discussions, which appear to be very different from each other. For example, the notion is used to formulate the paradox of the radical sceptic, who argues that we lack justification for most of our ordinary empirical beliefs; it is also used to ask whether being justified in believing something is explainable in genuine deontological terms or rather in purely consequentialist ones; it appears also in formulating the question of how our experiences provide us with basic justification to believe things about the world. The papers in this round table will discuss the different pressures and desiderata that are exerted upon a theory of epistemic justification depending on the theme the notion is used to theorize about. Outside identity. The feminine in philosophy, science, art and lifeZoe Hurley (UAE) ParticipantsAugusto Ponzio, Laura Marchetti, Genevieve Vaughan, Peter Flynn, Gillian Dooley, Margaretha Hendrickx, Devon Schiller, Zoe Hurley, Elisabetta Ostuni, Iuliia Nikitenko, Orsola Lermano, Nataša Lacković, Dario Dellino, Alin Olteanu, Zhao Sikong, Susan Petrilli, Anand Raja AbstractMost unfortunately the world is built on identities that are juxtaposed to each other, opposed to each other. This is identity concerning gender, nation, culture, religion, language, “ethnic” group, etc. A world build on identity, “closed identity” is inevitably a world of war where peace is no more than the peace of a truce in preparation for war. This panel considers how the sensibility of the feminine, the maternal, as we are describing it here, fosters dialogue, responsive understanding, participative involvement, cooperation, rigorous investigation, creativity. The panel will discuss how problems and ideals of the feminine that concern us are relevant to scientific research, philosophy and art as much as to life in its everyday expressions. Transforming philosophical canonsRiccardo Chiaradonna (Italy) ParticipantsFreschi Elisa, Michael Beaney, Pirrotta Serena AbstractThe papers presented in this panel address methodological aspects related to the study of the history of philosophy in an inter- and cross-cultural perspective above and beyond canons, as well as the challenges presented by dealing with non-canonical corpora. Michael Beaney will offer a general introduction to the topic, while Riccardo Chiaradonna and Elisa Freschi will present some case studies respectively from Greek and Roman Philosophy and Sanskrit Philosophy. Furthermore, Michael Beaney and Riccardo Chiaradonna, in their role as General Editors, will give a short presentation of Works of Philosophy and Their Reception, a new online research platform pub-lishing collaborative volumes on works of philosophy from antiquity to the present, published by De Gruyter (https://www.degruyter.com/database/WPR/html#overview ). Southeast Asian Philosophy in the Second Quarter of the 21st CenturySoraj Hongladarom (Thailand) ParticipantsSatha-anand Suwanna, Joven Joaquin Jeremiah, Blumson Ben AbstractThis panel will be a function of the Philosophy and Religion Society of Thailand, a member of the FISP. We will consider the outlook of philosophy in Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia in the second quarter of the twenty-first century, which starts in 2026. Countries in Southeast Asia have progressed steadily in many fronts and have integrated themselves coherently with the global community. These fronts, nonetheless, are mostly in the form of economic and, to a certain extent, scientific and technological capabilities. What has been rather neglected is a close and critical look on the prospect for progress and development of philosophy in the region. What can be done, or what needs to be done, in order for philosophy in Southeast Asia to become more developed? There are many points that we can discuss in this question. For example, what is exactly meant by saying that philosophy “can be developed”? Another important question is: What lies ahead for philosophy in Southeast. Translating Philosophy: The Jewish and Arabic Roots of “Western” ThoughtGiovanni Licata (Italy) ParticipantsYehuda Halper, Giovanni Licata, Chiara Adorisio, Francesca Gorgoni AbstractThe ethnocentric prejudice that only Christianity “saved Greek thought” continues to resurface in contemporary philosophical historiography. At the same time, there is a growing awareness that the roots of philosophy from the Middle Ages to the early modern period were Jewish and Arabic as much as Greek and Latin. The originality and importance of medieval Hebrew and Arabic philosophical sources was gradually rediscovered beginning in the first half of the nineteenth century. Moreover, the recent concept of translatio studiorum has led many researchers to reconsider the traditional narrative shared by most handbooks, in which the histories of Arabic, Jewish and Latin medieval philosophy are artificially separated as non-communicating fields of studies. Our round table aims to discuss the possibility of a Mediterranean history of philosophy which overcomes the ideological barriers that have impeded a genuine understanding of our philosophical tradition. The Moral Epistemology of the Wartime Quartet: Anscombe, Foot, Midgley and MurdochCathy Mason (Austria) ParticipantsBagnoli Carla, MacCumhaill Clare, Mylonaki Evgenia, Wiseman Rachael AbstractAlmost every recognized school of philosophical thought is wholly male, and philosophy in the twenty-first century continues to be a largely male-dominated discipline. However, in recent years there has been growing interest in the ‘Wartime Quartet’: Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, Mary Midgley and Iris Murdoch, who are unique among (recognized) philosophical schools of thought as an all-female school of philosophers. It has been suggested, both by Midgley herself and other commentators, that in ethics the Quartet were unified by a joint ‘no’ to the anti-realism and expressivism popular in their era. But what did this ‘no’ amount to? What was their own conception of moral knowledge? And how did they think that such knowledge might be gained? The participants will discuss the nature, sources and significance of moral knowledge in the work of the Quartet, as well as convergences and divergences in their thinking. Philosophy and the Comic: A New FieldLydia Amir (Israel) ParticipantsLuca Grillo, Steven Harvey, David Bartosch, Sheila Lintott, Robert Clewis, Francesco Campana, Russell Ford, Abraham Olivier, Lauren Olin AbstractPhilosophy entertain with the comical a close relationship, which is understudied both in philosophy and in humor studies.This roundtable breaks ground in exploring the various ways this relationship expresses itself in the history of philosophy and in contemporary contributions through a in careful differentiation between various cognates of the comical. In seeking to undertand both humor and philosophy, it addresses ethics, epistemology, ontology, and draws on analytic philosophy, phenomenology and the cognitive sciences. A re-evaulation of philosophy’s relationshipwith the comic not only illuminates humor in unprecedented ways, but it also amounts to a study in meta-philosophy. Transformative PhilosophyLydia Amir (Israel) ParticipantsDavid Bartosch, Lou Marinoff, Andrea Hurst, Finn Thorbjørn Hansen, Jose Barrientos-Rastrojo, Anders Lindseth, G. John Abbarno AbstractThat Western philosophy is a transformative discipline is a well-kept secret. The roundtable breaks ground in putting the topic of transformative philosophy on the agenda. By presenting philosophic theories and practices of transformation, both historical and contemporary, this roundtable offers viable ways of ensuring the thriving of philosophy in the academe. A meta-philosophical enterprise, it helps unraveling what philosophy was, clarifying what it is, and pointing to what it can be. All the participants of the roundtable are contributors to the Transformative Philosophy Handbook (Springer), a first of its kind, systematic and comprehensive companion, which defines a new field in philosophy. The Human Condition: Rekindling the Philosophic DialogueLydia Amir (Israel) ParticipantsLuca Maria Scarantino, Giorgio Baruchello, G. John Abbarno, Lou Marinoff, Mor Segev AbstractThe philosophic dialogue on the human condition has been rekindled in the 21st century. Without being called so, this topic has generated various studies which merit to be brought together in view of a fruiful encounter with our reality and its perspectives. This roundtable attempts to put the perennial topic of the Philosophy of the Human Condition on the agenda again through updated discussions of our current reality in view of a Companion to this new or renewed field. Nietzsche and the Crisis of the AnthropoceneYunus Tuncel (USA) ParticipantsSorgner Stefan Lorenz, Lemm Vanessa AbstractOver the last half-century many voices identify our disconnection from the earth with the centrality of technological progress, capitalist production, industrialization and globalization that are essential to our modern self-understanding and way of life. What was supposed to be the mark of human distinction has ended up uprooting us from the earth. Is this because we have a distorted view of what it means to be human in the first place, and our dependency on the earth and all life and beings on this planet? Our planet has entered into a critical phase in its long life, as humanity in its short span on the planet brought about insurmountable problems that impact all life and all beings of the planet. Philosophers have for a long time reflected on the question of the human responsibility to and care for the earth. In this round table panellists will focus on Nietzsche's critique and response to 19th century culture, ultra-rationalism, religion, and anthropocentricity. Revering the Sacred Creation – Spiritual Ecology and the Akṣara-Puruṣottama DarśanaMahāmahopādhyāya Bhadreshdas Swami (India) ParticipantsBhatt Siddheshwar Rameshwar, Devarakonda Balaganapathi, Swami Paramtattvadas, Swami Aksharananddas, Parekh Tilak AbstractThe proposed roundtable brings together two emerging fields of inquiry: spiritual ecology—the integrated study of ecology, science and religion—and the South Asian philosophical school known as the Akṣara-Puruṣottama Darśana—a thriving Vedic tradition with a distinct body of philosophical literature, a characteristic ethical position, established practices and diverse worldwide humanitarian initiatives. There are five aims of this roundtable: 1) to analyze the relationships between religious faith, practice and ecological studies; 2) to address gaps in research on Hindu belief systems and ecology; 3) to consider the relevance of Hindu traditions to environmental issues; 4) to investigate the ecological impacts of the Akṣara-Puruṣottama Darśana; and 5) to model focused, faith-based research methodologies in spiritual ecology. This discussion will promote intercultural and interdisciplinary perspectives while elucidating the contributions of a major Hindu tradition to an emerging field. Nietzsche and MusicAysegul Durakoglu (USA) ParticipantsSorgner Stefan Lorenz, Prange Martine AbstractNietzsche (1844-1900) is one of the few philosophers who have an intimate connection to music. His musical ambition urged him to compose music, although he had no training in this area. Most of his compositions are from his late teens; his earliest inspirations come from Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, Schubert, Schumann and Wagner. However, Nietzsche did not follow a musical path and decided to become a philologist and dedicated his life to writing and philosophy. Nietzsche’s background in music, on the other hand, influenced his way of thinking and writing. An Anthology on Nietzsche and Music: Philosophical Thoughts and Musical Experiments, edited by Durakoglu, Steinmann and Tuncel, will be presented at this round table. Editors and several contributors will present their findings and explain the significance of Nietzsche’s experimentation in thought and music. Posthuman StudiesStefan Lorenz Sorgner (Germany) ParticipantsVanessa Lemm, Yunus Tuncel, Stefan Lorenz Sorgner, Nicolás Rojas, Natasha Vita-More, Andrei Nutas, Tamara Kamatovic, Francesca Ferrando AbstractThe presentations of the posthuman studies round table analyze what it is to be human in an age of rapid technological, scientific, cultural, and social evolution. As the boundaries between human and \"the other,\" technological, biological and environmental, are eroded and perceptions of normalcy are challenged, they have generated a range of ethical, philosophical, cultural, and artistic questions that this round table seeks to address. Drawing on theory from critical posthumanism and the normative reflections of transhumanism, it encourages constructive but rigorously critical dialogue between the various philosophical movements which think beyond a dualist version of humanism. Revisiting Gödel's Incompleteness TheoremYu LI (France) ParticipantsPaola Cattabriga, Patrik Eklund, Paul Jorion, Mo Luo, Yu Li AbstractTo promote academic and public reflection on Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem, we propose to revisit Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem from different perspectives, such as philosophy, epistemology, psychology, logic, mathematics, algorithm theory and artificial intelligence, and penetrate into Gödel's original proof in his 1931 paper « On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I », to go beyond the limits of our thinking, and to confront the malaise involved in Gödel's proof together. We believe that the aspiration for truth and the seeking of truth is the most fundamental way to dissolve malaise, a quality indispensable when caring for the future of our world, … Enactive AestheticsCarlos Vara Sánchez (Spain) ParticipantsCarlos Vara Sánchez, Roberta Dreon, Joerg Fingerhut, Shaun Gallagher, Harry Drummond, Efrosini Charalambous, Zakary Djebbara, Guido Bittosi AbstractIn this panel, we will present and discuss new approaches to different dimensions of aesthetic experiences from an enactive perspective. Nowadays, many philosophers have left behind the classic understanding of aesthetic experiences as perceptual experiences afforded by art products focused on beauty, and regard aesthetic experiences as a heterogeneous set of dynamic engagements between human beings and the environment that afford us the possibility of exploring an object, practice or event as well as our being affected by them leaving behind dichotomies between internalist and externalist perspectives. Russian Philosophy of Art: Romanticism, Leo Tolstoy, and Philosophy of the IconVladimir Marchenkov (USA) ParticipantsOppo Andrea, Steiner Lina AbstractThe panel will address several aspects of Russian philosophy of art, looking at it through the lens of overarching movements, individual thinkers, and particular themes. The papers will encompass the role of Romanticism in the history of Russian aesthetic thought, Leo Tolstoy’s classic treatise What Is Art?, and Russian religious philosophers’ ground-breaking encounter with the icon. In these explorations the panellists will bring forth both the characteristic and typical moments in Russian aesthetic thought, and its ramified connections with the European philosophical tradition. Filling gaps, as in Tolstoy’s indebtedness to German thought, and drawing out unexpected implications of differences, as in the case of Florensky’s and Trubetskoi’s approaches, the panel will evoke the richness, dynamism, and continuing relevance of the Russian contribution to world philosophy of art. The Russian thinkers’ dialogue with their counterparts across national boundaries will be a particular thread. Habits, Rituals and Human LifeRaffaela Giovagnoli (Italy) ParticipantsRaffaela Giovagnoli, Renate Querenberger, Irena Mostowicz AbstractThis event is inspired by interesting discussions that took place at the IS4SI Summit 2017 (Gothenburg), IS4SI Summit 2019 (Berkeley), IS4SI 2021 (online Japan), GSIS workshop 2023 (online Vienna) .Habits and rituals play a fundamental role in human individual and social life. We discuss important aspects of habits and rituals and their relevance for human life. Cruelty and HumorLydia Amir (Israel) ParticipantsJacob Dahl Rendtorf, Mirella Pasini, Giorgio Baruchello, Ársæll Már Arnarsson AbstractGiven the enormous extent and variety of extant usages and expert interpretations of \"humor\" and \"cruelty\" in the Western humanities and social sciences, the roudtable systematizes the topic through a discussion of Cruelty and Humor, the four volumes published by philosopher Giorgio Baruchello and psychologist Ársæll Már Arnarsson, which inaugutes de Gruyter Series in Philosophy of Humor, Humor and Cruelty. It evaluates their research, which led them into pursuing a somewhat puzzling yet extremely rich conceptual history and into presenting two sets of family resemblances capturing some of the recurring connotations of these two terms and corresponding concepts. Philosophy: Between Theory and PracticeLydia Amir (Israel) ParticipantsGiancarlo Marinelli, David Sumiacher, Michael Picard, Anders Lindseth, Ora Gruengard AbstractThe roundtable will put on the philosophers' agenda the relation between theory and practice in philosophy. It will concentrate on the question of the relevance of academic philosophical theories and the academic discourse about them, on the one hand, and the philosophizing activities of “lay” participants in the various frameworks of philosophical practice, in particular in philosophical counseling, on the other hand. A special attention will be given to the question of the relevance of the academic knowledge and expertise of philosophical practitioners, as teachers, facilitators or counselors. Who Is a Philosopher? Thinking Philosophical Praxis with its Founder, Gerd B. AchenbachLydia Amir (Israel) ParticipantsGerd B. Achenbach, Laura V. Adrian, Michael Picard, Soung-Suk Nho, Anders Lindseth, Ora Gruengard AbstractPhilosophical Praxis was founded in 1981 by the German philosopher Gerd Achenbach, and has meanwhile taken root all around the world. On the occasion of his first book-length publication in English, Philosophical Praxis (2024), and in response to evaluations of this work, Achenbach will share some of his thoughts on and experiences in Philosophical Praxis, as they have grown through over 40 years of counselling. Most importantly, Achenbach explains why a theory and method of Philosophical Practice would necessarily be a misunderstanding. Philosophy and Methodologies in Media & Digital StudiesSophia Tikhonova (Russia) ParticipantsVarkhotov Taras, Tikhonova Sofia AbstractThe nature of the current development of new media is systematically questioned by researchers and is associated with a range of problems. The key aim of the round table is to bring together philosophers who are interested in the philosophy and methodology of Media & Digital Studies. Nowadays, there are several thematic and methodological approaches: 1. Movement from media theory (M. McLuhan, H. Innis, N. Postman) to the concept of mediatization (A. Hepp, N. Couldry, S. Hjarvard); 2. Understanding the Internet as a simulative, hyperreal space (J. Baudrillard) and at the same time as a new space of meritocracy (M. Castells), where actors are able to make socio-organizing decisions outside the social hierarchy (B. Noveck); 3. The development of new ontologies (M. DeLanda, B. Latour, J. Law, G. Harman); 4. The spread of the posthuman approach (D. Haraway, R. Braidotti, K. Barad), which puts human beings on a par with nature and technology. Heidegger Circle in Asia: Comparative Studies between Heidegger’s philosophy and Asian thoughtsChoong-Su HAN (South Corea) ParticipantsDing Deng, Qinghua Zhu, Rajabi Ahmad, Suehisa Asuka, Saito Motoki, Kageyama Yohei, Ha Peter, Lagdameo Federico Jose T., Loquias Victor John M., Barbaza Remmon E., Luh Jing-Jong, Tsai Wei-ding AbstractHeidegger Circle in Asia (HCIA) is an international academic network founded on the 24th WCP in 2018 (Beijing). The HCIA aims to promote intercultural dialogues between Heidegger’s philosophy and Asian thoughts. The 1st conference was organized in 2019 (Taipei). Because of the pandemic, the 2nd conference was held online in 2022 (Seoul). After the 3rd conference in 2023 (Taipei), the HCIA prepares to open itself to the globe and is going to hold its 4th conference in the form of a round table on the 25th WCP in 2024 (Rome). This round table will be hosted by Prof. Choong-Su Han and Prof. Wei-Ding Tsai and have 13 speakers from 6 regions (China, Iran, Japan, Korea, Philippines, and Taiwan). They will pre-sent the results of their comparative research from different cultural perspectives and welcome everyone to join the discussion across boundaries. After the round table, the HCIA will announce its next conferences: 2025 (Seoul), 2026 (Manila), 2027 (Tokyo). Genealogical and Functional Reconstructions in Machiavelli’s Forms of StatesClaudio Corradetti (Italy) ParticipantsVatter Miguel, Dymond Jeff AbstractIn the opening lines of The Prince, Machiavelli put forth the general classification of the states: “All states and all dominions […] have been and still are either republics or principalities” (Chap. I 1-2). However, it is the case that ‘republican moments’ can be found in the civil principality of Chap. IX of The Prince as well as, reversibly, principalities or even dictatorial shifts are found in the critical periods of the Roman Republic. In order to make sense of these complexities, the panel welcomes a broad array of contributions targeting Machiavelli’s definition and classification of states as well as the notion of their constituting powers. What is the notion of state (stato)? Where does it come from? What is it meant by “change of state”? Papers can adopt either an analytic or an historical/genealogical approach. The panel will seek advancing substantive understanding in the reconstruction of the overall picture of Machiavelli's conception of states. Pratiche filosofiche e pratiche femministeGiulia Gentile ParticipantsGiovanna Borrello, David Sumiacher D'Angelo, Teresa Lucente, Virginia Sanchez Rivera, Luisa de Paula, Patricia Solis Galindez, Giulia Gentile Abstract\"Counseling filosofico, consulenza filosofica, autobiografia, dialogo socratico e praxis sono pratiche che si radicano nel discorso filosofico, usano una certa filosofia, ma quale filosofia? Una filosofia essenzialmente pratica come quella greco-latina, socratica, stoica o epicurea, ma anche correnti più attuali come il Pensiero della differenza sessuale: L. Irigaray, M. Zambrano, S. Weil. Queste maitres à penser contemporanee si rifanno alla filosofia orientale che si fonda su esercizi e meditazioni. Per Weil la filosofia è “esercizio” ed è difficile da spiegare, come un trattato di tennis. L’esercizio filosofico è un allenamento alla vita: tra esistenza e pensiero c’é una correlazione d’intensità che esclude ogni iato. Ma correlazioni con le pratiche filosofiche le possiamo ritrovare anche nella pratiche del femminismo tout court, come il partire da sé, la relazione con l’altro/a, e soprattutto l’autocoscienza che è una pratica di autoconsapevolezza affine al training di gruppo.\" Interpretations of SocratesFrancesca Pentassuglio (Italy) ParticipantsAlessandro Stavru, Chloe Balla, Emidio Spinelli, Francesca Pentassuglio, Carolina Araujo, Nicholas Smith AbstractThe history of interpretations of Socrates covers the entire span of the history of philosophy, ranging from the earliest followers of Socrates – each of whom provided their own view of Socratic philosophy – to the historiographical trends that emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries. The proposed round table aims to discuss crucial highlights of this history: notably, the speakers will address the following key moments: (1) the (often conflicting) interpretations of the 5th-4th century (Aristophanes, Xenophon, Plato), as well as the\n\nscholarly trends that stress the ‘interaction’ among the first-generation Socratics and take into account the constraints of the literary genres they employ; (2) the interpretation of Socratic literature provided by major German and French scholars in 19th and 20th century (Schleiermacher, Gigon, Foucault, and Hadot among others); (3) the image of Socrates as reconstructed by the philosophical historiography of the late 20th century in Italy, with special regard to the studies of the so-called ‘Roman school’ by Guido Calogero and Gabriele Giannantoni; (4) the major interpretive trends of the mid- to late 20th and early 21st centuries\n\nin the Anglophone world and their application to the study of (Plato’s) Socrates (e.g. analytic method, constructivist and anti-constructivist approaches, the Straussian movement, literary interpretative methods); (5) the recent Socratic literature in Portuguese and Spanish. An Intercultural Philosophical Dialogue on Technology and the Making of Transhumanist Rights and ValuesOjochogu Abdul (Nigeria) ParticipantsNatasha Vita-More, Stefan Lorenz Sorgner, Doreen Sesiro, Sarah Ahamed, Avinash Singh, Ojochogu Abdul, Osinakachi Akuma Kalu, Amara Esther Chimakonam, Leo Igwe AbstractTechnology is reshaping our world, and transhumanism as a philosophy at the intersection of technological and scientific revolutions, cultural changes and postmodern politics keeps growing. Transhumanist values advocate the desirability of transforming the human condition through ethical use of technology, science, reason, equity, humaneness and wellbeing, while transhumanist rights comprise principles of morphological freedom, cognitive liberty and life extension. Close examination of these concepts however reveal their background in the Enlightenment project of Western philosophy, thus provoking suspicion among non-Western thinkers of a mental neo-colonial agenda disguised as promotion of “universal principles”. This roundtable aims to present a diversity of Western, African and Asian perspectives in an intercultural philosophical dialogue on technological implications and towards cross-cultural engagements for the making of a truly inclusive set of transhumanist rights and values. Can Religious Experience Bridge the Interreligious Gap?Klaus Viertbauer (Germany) ParticipantsMarkus Riedenauer, Christian Jung, Maureen Junker-Kenny, Ludwig Nagl, Enrico Peroli, Genia Schönbaumsfeld, Klaus Viertbauer AbstractSince we live in a globalized world, we are more and more confronted with a plurality of cul-tural and religious traditions. At least in western democracies, people with different religious convictions live peacefully side by side. On the one hand the state considers itself as secular and on the other side grants the different religious traditions much autonomy. But within such a postsecular context the question what religious traditions have in common becomes more and more apparent. In the search for a common ground for such an interreligious dia-logue, the recourse to religious experiences seems to be a promising candidate. Specifically, it is important to explore how the phenomena of self-transcendence and resonance can be re-lated to each other as a relation between individual experience on the one hand and religious articulation and interpretation on the other. In light of this, the round table takes up this issue and asks whether religious experience can be recognized as a bridge. Pensare la nascita.\n\nPercorsi fra fenomenologia, etica e ontologiaGiovanna Costanzo ParticipantsSilvano Zucal, Mario Vergani, Paola Ricci, Alessandra Papa, Alison Frances Scott-Baumann, Manuela Moretti, Giovanna Costanzo AbstractCogliere la vita non sub specie mortis ma sub specie nativitatis consente al pensiero quella torsione all’indietro verso quel punto da cui tutto ha inizio. Un inizio inteso come novità e irruzione, come capacità di rivoluzionare il dato e il consolidato, eppure al contempo come un inizio che non può mai assurgere alla pretesa di cominciamento assoluto. Del resto, se pensiamo al nascituro, la nascita è un evento che è suo ma che non gli appartiene completamente: nascere significa non essere la propria origine ma venire a sé da una origine data secondo le modalità della passività, della consegna, del dono e del “ritardo costitutivo”. Pensare la condizione umana sub specie nativitatis stimola inoltre una riflessione etica sul legame e sui tanti legami che vincolano gli uomini fra di loro: l’impegno, l’amore, la promessa, la libertà, la responsabilità, la fiducia, il perdono, il rispetto. Philosophy of the experience of noiseBasil Vassilicos (Ireland) ParticipantsDi Bona Elvira, De Warren Nicolas AbstractThis panel’s aim is to stimulate philosophical interest in experiences of noise. There are at least three important open questions about noise. First, how should the relationship between noise as a scientific phenomenon and as a type of experience be understood? Second, are experiences of noise strictly limited to perceptual states or to one type of perceptual state – for instance, to auditory experiences? Third, can philosophy make sense of noise in the first place? Should noise simply be relegated to the hither side of the explananda of philosophy, as the mere leftover of whatever philosophy sets out to account for; meaning, being, totality, etc.? This panel will contribute to the burgeoning philosophy of noise by highlighting how contemporary philosophy of mind and phenomenology – the latter under both broad and narrow construals – can make inroads to these questions about a fascinating yet little understood quarter of human experience. Perception and HallucinationAlessandro Salice (Ireland) ParticipantsOvergaard Søren, Schellenberg Susanna AbstractMain aim of this panel is to contribute to a recent trend of studies that put in dialogue contemporary debates on philosophy of mind with classical phenomenology. The panel is devoted to the nature of perception and, in particular, to the question of whether hallucination and perception are mental states that share the same nature. Current philosophy of perception is divided into two main camps: positive answers to that question are usually grouped together under the name of ‘conjunctivism,’ whereas negative answers are generally labelled as ‘disjunctivism.’ At the beginning of the past century, a similar debate was conducted, although with a different terminology, by classical phenomenologists like Husserl, Linke, Reinach, Scheler, and others. The panel will discuss virtues and vices of—phenomenological and contemporary—conjuctivism and disjunctivism. Phenomenon of Generations in Contemporary Research of the 20th Century PhilosophyOndrej Marchevsky (Slovak Republic) ParticipantsYulia V. Sineokaya, Ondrej Marchevský, Marina F. Bykova, Boris Podoroga, Alexey Zhavoronkov, Sergei Shevchenko, Anna Vinkelman (Winckelmann) AbstractThis roundtable is devoted to a new methodological approach in the study of the history of 20th century philosophy in different philosophical environments. These contemporary considerations problematise the phenomenon of philosophical generations. Based on the definitions of the term “generation” given by K. Mannheim, H. Ortega-i-Gasset, N. Howe and on the notion of “philosophical generation” launched by Y. Sineokaya, the ideological nature of the generation as a phenomenon will be examined is the first key objective of this round table. The Perceivability of Higher-Level PropertiesAlberto Voltolini (Italy) ParticipantsDi Bona Elvira, Papineau David, Sacchi Elisabetta, Zeimbekis John AbstractIn philosophy of mind, notably in philosophy of perception, a very intense debate has started after Siegel (2010) as to whether there is a criterion for selecting, among higher-level properties (i.e., properties whose instantiation depend on the instantiation of lower-level properties such as colors, sounds and shapes; e.g, properties like being a pine tree (or any other natural kind), having a certain meaning (for a linguistic expression), looking sad (or any other expressive property)), those which can be specifically addressed by perceptual states or experiences from those which can only be grasped by other cognitive means. Up to now, none of the extant proposals (e.g., the method of phenomenal contrast, the method of introspection, the method of specific neural instantiation) has turned out to be completely satisfying. By involving some of the worldly experts on this theme, the round table wants to discuss whether it is possible to find necessary and sufficient conditions in order. New Perspectives on Leo Strauss's Philosophy and its SourcesChiara Adorisio (Italy) ParticipantsZank Michael, Kerber Hannes, Licata Giovanni, Minkov Svetozar, Green Kenneth Hart, Adorisio Chiara, Zank Michael, Kerber Hannes, Licata Giovanni, Minkov Svetozar, Green Kenneth Hart AbstractThe scholarly interpreters of the German-Jewish philosopher, Leo Strauss (Kirchhain 1899– Annapolis 1973), have resisted defining his philosophy, which is based on a deep critique of philosophical modernity and is often expressed in ambiguous propositions. Many of them have stated that Strauss’s most famous writings – such as Die Religions Kritik Spinozas (1930), Philosophie und Gesetz (1935), Hobbes’ politische Wissenschaft (1936) and Persecution and the Art of Writing (1952) – contain no original thoughts but are merely useful tools for reading the philosophers of the past, who had a more direct access to the “eternal” problems of philosophy and could show us the path toward an authentic philosophical rationalism. Recent studies have shown the limits of this kind of reception and have opened the path to stimulating perspectives on Strauss’s philosophy.The panel aims to bring into a dialogue new intepretations of Strauss. New approaches in the historiography of philosophy: The status of oral traditionsAnke Graness (Germany) ParticipantsVété-Congolo-Leibnitz Hanétha, Etieyibo Edwin, López Molina Amalia Xochitl, Burkhart Brian AbstractToday, there is a growing consensus among philosophers in Africa, the Americas and other regions of the world that the history of philosophy has to consider both existing written and oral sources in the reconstruction of the history of philosophy. Even though it is usually not denied that philosophy also and above all expresses itself in oral practices, such as conversation or instruction, the question remains as to how orally handed down philosophical traditions can become part of a history of philosophy. This is subject to a number of methodological questions: What are oral philosophical traditions? How do they differ from other kinds of oral knowledge? How and where are oral philosophical traditions manifested? How can philosophical traditions in an oral culture be documented and analysed – without altering them by using academic language and concepts to describe them? What are appropriate methods? Filosofía Experiencial en Prisión y en otros medios de vulnerabilidadJosé Barrientos Rastrojo (Spain) ParticipantsJosé Barrientos Rastrojo, Victoria Sarmiento Aponte, Angel Alonso Salas, Víctor A. Rojas, Luis Triana Llano, Félix García Moriyón AbstractA lo largo de la historia, Filosofía y prisión han sellado alianzas. En la Apología de Sócrates, el maestro de Platón pasó sus últimos días entre rejas al igual que Boecio; Hobbes sufriría reclusión en Inglaterra, Gramsci en Italia, Foucault en Francia y Angela Davis en Estados Unidos. La realidad penitenciaria ha sido central en las investigaciones de pensadores como Concepción Arenal en España o Michel Foucault en Francia. Quizás, por ello, no sea insólito encontrar a licenciados y doctores de filosofía realizando talleres y clases en estos medios: Vaughana Feary, Gregory Sadler y el matrimonio da Venza Tillmanns en Estados Unidos, Eduardo Vergara, Delia Manzanero y Alejandro Moreno en España, Szifris o Andy West en Inglaterra, Angel Alonso en México o Gronke en Alemania. Philosophy of Physics Across Methodological BoundariesSamuel Fletcher (USA) ParticipantsArdoline Michael, Castellani Elena, Halvorson Hans, Plotnitsky Arkady, Wiltsche Harald AbstractThere are multiple ways to investigate the interactions between philosophy and physics. First, one may draw implications for metaphysics, epistemology, or even aesthetics directly from the concepts and findings of contemporary physics. Second, one may use specific cases from the history of physics to learn lessons about the methodology of science, the social structure and epistemological practices of scientific institutions, and the history of philosophy, science, and ideas more broadly. Third, one may focus on articulating and resolving conceptual issues within physical theories and the practices of physicists by applying philosophical methods. Fourth, one may take inspiration from physics to generate new philosophical ideas in areas not directly related to physics. This roundtable brings together philosophers of physics working in analytic, phenomenological, and poststructuralist traditions to discuss how these traditions approach the philosophy of physics. Michel Foucault: His Philosophy between the Questions of the Enlightenment, Critique of Psychoanalysis, and Contemporary LifeEva D. Bahovec (Slovenia) ParticipantsThomas Diesner, Koteska Jasna AbstractPresentations offer a new perspective on one of the most influential scholars of philosophy and the humanities of our time, Michel Foucault, with a particular focus on the unity of his work, and his new approaches to philosophy, history, theoretical psychoanalysis and the contemporary life. His multidisciplinary writings include critique of traditional psychology, psychiatry, medicine, legal practices, literary, fiction, and in-depth analysis of modern and post-modern phenomena. His conceptualization of the modern living in the 20th and the 21st century also reflects on the contemporary cultural, social, and global challenges, and provide new possibilities of resistance to power and domination. Identity, Community, Legality and Goodness according to John Duns Scotus and the Scotist TraditionFrancesco Fiorentino (Italy) ParticipantsAndersen Claus A., Chen Ziang, Serafini Marcella AbstractThe formal identity and distinction, human and Trinitarian persons, natural and positive laws and essential and moral order are analyzed from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, in the Scotist tradition: John Duns Scotus, Peter Thomae, Gerald Odonis, Francis of Meyronnes, and the “treatises on the formalities”, on many aspects of ethics and politics, as well as their metaphysical foundations. The first paper shows how the highly differentiated Scotist identity metaphysics may be relevant for the modern discussions of identity politics. The second paper points out Scotus’s important theory of correlated, yet independent, divine persons for the coexistence of human persons. The third paper investigates the Franciscan debates, in the wake of Scotus, about the relationship between natural, revoked law and positive law, where the prudence can correct the obsolete natural law. The fourth paper discusses, in Scotus, essential and moral order, justice, goodness and selfless love. Philosophical encounter between the West and China in Ming and Qing dynastiesThierry Meynard ParticipantsGe WANG, Ping ZELLER, Jin QIAN AbstractIn this panel, the three presenters will present in Chinese language their own research based on their analysis of Confucian texts and concepts being reinterpreted (1) by a Late Ming Chinese literatus, Yang Tingyun, (2) by a Jesuit missionary under Kangxi, François Noël, and (3) by a French orientalist under Louis XIV, François Bernier. Space Ethics: Philosophy of Space Exploration and the Future of Human SocietyKoji Tachibana (Japan) ParticipantsGarasic Mirko, Milligan Anthony AbstractSpace ethics is a growing research area in philosophy. The recent development of space science and technology raises various philosophical and applied ethical questions: whether living in space can change the existing conception of human beings, or earthling--being on Earth--is an essential factor of being human; whether it is morally permissible to abandon the polluted Earth once humans have sufficient technology to survive as a species in space, or the Earth has an absolute value that we must respect in any case; whether humans are allowed to colonize other planets, or they have a moral duty to preserve the natural environment of space; whether it is morally permissible to use aerospace technologies for geo/earth-engineering, or air and space have natural values that we must not manipulate for the sake of humans. This roundtable will consider these and other questions of space ethics from philosophical and applied ethical perspectives. Transcending Boundaries: Humans and Ultimate RealityKatia Lenehan (Taiwan, China) ParticipantsLi Bernard, Tran Van Doan, Selvamani Maria John P., Chan Tak Kwong, Chen Wen Hsiang, Su Ying-Fen AbstractN today's multicultural world, crossing boundaries is an important topic. Dialogue is an essen-tial method for crossing boundaries. Religious and cultural traditions can enrich and learn from each other through dialogue. In addition to a horizontal crossover of multiple traditions, there is also a vertical one, or a continuous upward crossover which is transcending boundaries, a crossover towards ultimate reality. The transcendental dimension in human nature serves as the basis of “boundary breakthrough” in life and leads humans to ultimate reality. In this forum, we will consider this upward transboundary issue from the perspective of different cultures and religious traditions, and reveal various possible relationships between human beings and ultimate reality. Presented topics involve Christian traditions, Confucianism, philosophical counseling, technology, anthropology, cultural conversations...etc. Political Philosophy and Its Relationship with Moral PhilosophyChang Jiang ParticipantsCora Toralba, Lydia Amir, Thomas Menamparampil, Cuéllar Pérez Hortensia, Jialian Li, Hongyan Zhou, Jingyun Long, Fubiao Xiong, Shipeng Wang, Suxiang Ni, Yanhong Qi, Jia Wang, Wanzhi Li, Juhua Peng, Xiulian Wu, Jinping Zhou, Huabing Mao AbstractWhen philosophy was born,philosophers noticed the two basic characteristics of human nature,namely, self-action and sociality,and took them as the focus of thinking and exploration.So there was moral philosophy that focused on the self-acting potential of human nature and its realization, and po-litical philosophy that focused on the social potential of human nature and its realization. The study of politics in political philosophy mainly belongs to the field of values, therefore it belongs to the subject of value and it has a cross relationship with axiology. The common purpose of political philosophy and moral philosophy is to study how to live a good life according to the requirements of human nature, but there are differences between the two in the research object,mission,and main issues of concern. However, the difference between the two is relative.Both of them may cover all aspects of the good life of social members in a comprehensive way, but the focus of the study is different. On the Future of Global Histories of PhilosophyRolf Elberfeld ParticipantsNadja Germann, Anke Graness, Ricardo Pozzo, Bret Davis Abstract\"World History of Philosophy,\" \"Global History of Philosophy,\" \"World Philosophy,\" \"World Philosophies,\" or \"Histoire mondiale de la philosophie\" are book titles under which attempts have been made from 1945 to the recent past to systematically expand the historiography of philosophy - more or less - to the global context. The number of attempts has increased significantly in the last 20 years. The discussion will begin with a critical look back at previous attempts at a global history of philosophy. In a second step, the desiderata should be asked and the question whether a truly global history of philosophy is possible. The topic will be observed not only from the field of philosophy, but also from the field of literature, since the concept of world literature can provide important clues for the conception of a global history of philosophy. Post-Kantian Perfectionism: Political, Ethical, and Aesthetic ChallengesGabriele Schimmenti (Italy) ParticipantsDouglas Moggach, Koula Mellos, Heikki Ikäheimo, Maximiliano Hernandez Marcos, Gabriele Schimmenti AbstractThis round table intends to present and to explore the tradition of Post-Kantian Perfectionism in political philosophy, ethics and aesthetics through a dialogue among international scholars. Post-Kantian perfectionism is intended to refer to that current of ethical and political thought that emerges in the wake of Kant’s critique of his precursors and that, echoing elements of Leibniz’s philosophy, understands modern freedom as autonomy and spontaneity while reflecting on the legal and the institutional relations that support such freedom. The aim of the proposed dialogue is to discuss and investigate the development from a Pre-Kantian Perfectionism, based on the concept of happiness, to a Post-Kantian Perfectionism based on the concepts of freedom and autonomy. The discussion will comprise a presentation of the ethical, political and aesthetic challenges of Post-Kantian Perfectionism and an exploration of such Perfectionism in eminent figures and currents in the history of philosophy. New Research Avenues in PhenomenologyHamid Taieb (Switzerland) ParticipantsArnaud Dewalque, Hamid Taieb, Guillaume Fréchette Abstract\"Phenomenology has ushered in numerous novel research avenues, putting this vibrant discipline at the core of many philosophical debates. This panel aims to showcase three major research projects, each with the potential to amplify this ongoing trend. The first project, run by Arnaud Dewalque at the University of Liege and entitled “MIND - The British Sources of Philosophy of Mind 1888-1949,” (2023-2027) is an investigation into the common historical roots shared by phenomenology and analytic philosophy. Alba Montes Sánchez is the PI of “Belonging Reconfigured: A Phenomenological Study of Migrant Emotions in a Sample of Spanish Expats” (University Carlos III Madrid, 2023-2028), which aims at developing the first phenomenological account of migratory grief. “A Sensible World. The Problem of Secondary Qualities in and around the School of Brentano” is a research project led by Hamid Taieb (2020-2026), which explores the phenomenology of secondary qualities. Humanity Revisited: Navigating a World Shaped by AIYoichi Iwasaki (Japan) ParticipantsTachibana Koji, Izumi Yu, Verdicchio Mario, Zhang Sonia Yuhui AbstractThis roundtable primarily discusses the ethical issues stemming from human-AI interactions. Koji Tachibana (Greek philosophy) delves into the unique attributes of humans in contrast with AI, highlighting the 'relationship', especially the notion of 'love', between humans and AI. Yu Izumi (philosophy of language) addresses the abusive treatment of AI by humans, examining the concept of 'dehumanization' and evaluating the potentially harmful aspects of human-AI interactions. Yoichi Iwasaki (Indian philosophy) explores how AI presents itself as an intelligent being from the viewpoint of Buddhist semantics. Mario Verdicchio (philosophy of technology) sheds light on the risks of AI use, interpreting AI as an outcome of the coproduction of technology and society. Lastly, Sonia Zhan, possessing an STS (Science, Technology, and Society) background, offers insights from case studies in robot development, prompting a reevaluation of the nexus between philosophy and technology. Susanne K. Langer's Philosophy and LegacyLona Gaikis (Austria) ParticipantsGrüny Christian, Bergonzo Carolyn, Priest Eldritch, Felappi Giulia, Nocek Adam, Hadravová Tereza, Dryden Donald, Gaikis Lona, Sauer Martina AbstractLogician and philosopher of art Susanne K. Langer (1895–1985) is a remarkable figure of twentieth-century thought. She devoted her philosophical engagement to mathematical and linguistic questions, and had a deeply ingrained curiosity for the meaning of the forms of art. In this, Langer continued Ernst Cassirer and Alfred North Whitehead’s attempts towards a broader symbolistic turn. In review of twentieth century philosophy, and the female voices that shaped it, her work is currently experiencing a renaissance. This round table collects international scholars from various fields (philosophy, arts, aesthetics, psychology and theoretical biology) engaged in Langer’s work and its generative ideas. Langer is considered an early and formative figure of the analytic movement in the US, bridging the continental divide. Her philosophy centres on the idea of the arts having “epistemological import.” We will touch upon the interdisciplinarity in Langer’s philosophy, reaching from logic, across the study of perception to a biologically grounded theory of the embodied and embedded mind. Which aspects, brought into the present day, have visionary potential, offering, e.g., an organic theory of feeling as a new avenue in biology? Can her concept of mind aid in navigating an age of Human-like artificial systems? Critical Political Epistemology RoundtableSolmu Anttila (Netherlands) ParticipantsDeig Stephanie, Agra Kelly, Altanian Melanie, Kusch Martin, Löffelmann Flora, Riegler Sonja, Veigl Sophie AbstractCritical Political Epistemology (CPE) is a recently formed interdisciplinary, critical, feminist research program for investigating socially pressing issues arising from the intersections of current political and epistemic structures, systems, and institutions, such as social identity, governance, activism, expertise, ideology, and labor. The aim of this roundtable is to introduce CPE to philosophers interested in critical approaches to political epistemology. In the first part of the roundtable (~1 hr), scholars associated with the Critical Political Epistemology Network (CPEN) discuss what CPE is and its central topic areas; why it’s “critical”; how it differs from received Analytic Political Epistemology; examples of (experimental, collaborative) research in CPE. The second part of the roundtable is a discussion with the audience about the aims of CPE, critical issues for CPE, and how to interpret and practice the “political” in “political epistemology The World is Enough: Varieties of Monism at the Turn of the 20th CenturyGuillaume Fréchette (Portugal) ParticipantsRusso Krauss Chiara, Dewalque Arnaud AbstractIn recent years, monism as a philosophical position has gained in popularity and is defended in different forms under various labels, be it priority monism (Schaffer, 2009, 2010), panpsychism (Chalmers 2013), or realistic monism (Strawson 2006). Interestingly, these positions very often refer to earlier monistic accounts as their predecessors, such as Mach’s theory of elements, Avenarius’ critical empiricism, Lotze’s and Ward’s mentalistic monism, James’ radical empiricism or, Russell’s neutral monism, most of the time without distinguishing the motivations of these accounts. The objective of this round table is to shed some more light on the varieties of monistic positions and their differences at the turn of the 20th century in order to get a better grip of their specificity and to gain a better assessment of their influence, with a particular focus on the perspectives and traditions that have been most influential in the contemporary debates on monism. Dark Aesthetics: War, Destructions and Massacres in Art and Everyday CultureZoltán Somhegyi (Hungary) ParticipantsBianchi Enea, Giombini Lisa, Kvokacka Adrián, Moraitis Konstantinos, Muthuma Lydia, Yang Zhen AbstractDark narratives and depictions have been prevalent in literary, performing, and visual arts across a wide range of cultures throughout history. Today, the uncanny, unsettling aspects of reality continue to persist. These elements find their reflection in the enduring fascination of contemporary mass art and culture with dark narratives, depictions, and references, driven by the haunting legacy of the 20th century and the ongoing, terrifying conflicts of the present day. The rationale for this panel lies in the belief that an exploration of art production and aesthetic thought can significantly contribute to our understanding of the nature and consequences of devastation, as well as to the discovery of strategies for its potential management and recovery. Panel participants, representing seven countries across three continents, will explore a multitude of facets pertaining to dark aesthetic narratives in both historical and contemporary contexts. The Ethics of LoveCamil Golub (USA) ParticipantsCathy Mason, Sophie Goddard, Camil Golub AbstractThis panel will explore a cluster of ethical questions about love and personal relationships. Cathy Mason will discuss the ways in which deception undermines intimate relationships. She will suggest that deception robs the victims of valuable relational goods as well as important self-knowledge. Sophie Goddard will defend relationship anarchy as a form of non-monogamy that rejects prescriptive labels, hierarchies, and exclusivity agreements in relationships. This ethical approach to relationships, she will argue, challenges three problematic norms which affect our romantic relationships: amatonormativity, heteronormativity, and mononormativity. Camil Golub will examine a puzzle about love and grief: how can grief in response to losing a loved one rationally diminish over time, given that the significance of the loss remains the same? He will propose an answer grounded in the idea that we can find meaning in the loss of a loved one, by understanding how that loss is tied to our narrative identity or to a broader story about the world, without attributing value in any substantive sense to the loss. Thus, making sense of a loss through narratives can rationally support the diminution of grief even if the evaluative facts about that loss remain the same.\n\nGender and Posthuman PhilosophiesJoanna Pascoe (New Zealand) ParticipantsBalzano Angela, Kilbourn Russell, Saha Debika, Bauman Emily AbstractGender and Posthuman Philosophies offers an exploration across boundaries, with the aim of recuperating the voices of the silenced. Amidst the disruption of war, climate emergency, species decline and AI flourishing, can we turn to hopepunk horizons? Drawing on multiple ecologies, posthuman feminism invites us to re-world our world. Cyborgs and goddesses care for our companion species and the beauty of Earth as it spins in the cosmos. In light of the scholarship of Braidotti, Haraway, Spivak, Barad and Alaimo, the panel explores the generative possibilities of Posthuman Feminism. Engaging with lived experience and the social imaginary of science fiction cinema and literature may bring forth new knowledge(s) to think about the human beyond boundaries. Our panelists discuss themes of gender, of sexuality and reproduction, monster and machine, of transformations and possibilities, of trans-corporeal encounters. Posthuman feminism offers an affirmative philosophy of love for the world. Nietzsche and MusicBen Abelson (USA) ParticipantsTuncel Yunus, Prange Martine, Sorgner Stefan Lorenz, Babich Babette, Steinmann Michael, Durakoglu Ayesegul, Conway Daniel AbstractNietzsche (1844-1900) is one of the few philosophers who have an intimate connection to music. This connection has much to do with his early music education. His musical ambition urged him to compose music, although he had no training in this area. However, Nietzsche did not follow a musical path and decided to become a philologist and dedicated his life to writing and philosophy. The relations between music, literature, and philosophy and Nietzsche's relationship to music have been explored by many Nietzsche scholars including Georges Liébert, Graham Parkes, Francois Noudelmann, Stefan Lorenz Sorgner and others and in An Anthology on Nietzsche and Music: Philosophical Thoughts and Musical Experiments, edited by Aysegul Durakoglu, Michael Steinmann and Yunus Tuncel. In this round table editors and several contributors to this anthology will present their findings and explain the significance of Nietzsche’s experimentation in thought and music and his attempt to cross boundaries. “Philosophy Steamer” 2022: the new wave of emigration after 24/02Ekaterina Rozova (Russia) ParticipantsBerdnikova Aleksandra, Ebanoidze Igor, Nemtsev Mikhail, Podoroga Ioulia, Akopov Sergei, Sineokaya Yulia, Biriukov Dmitry AbstractRussia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24/02 2022 led to a new wave of emigration: many people from Ukraine had to flee their homes, saving their lives and becoming refugees. Many Russians and Belarusians, expressing disagreement with the criminal actions of their governments, often under the threat of prosecution, also left their countries. Such questions as belonging to an aggressor state, internal divide of Russian culture, cancellation of Russian language pose new moral, cultural and intellectual challenges for the new wave of emigrants. It can lead to crisis of self-identification, experiences of trauma and loneliness, rethinking of their national belonging, original goals and meaning of emigration. Philosophy. Globalization. Education and peaceAlexander N. Chumakov (Russia) ParticipantsEdward Demenchonok, Ayazhan Sagikyzy, Nigina Shermuhamedova, Thomas Daffern, Zhang Baichun, Lu Feng,Endre Kiss,Vincenzo Rizzo, Joseph Garske,William L. McBride, Glen T. Martin,Marek Hrubec, Anatoliy Kosichenko,Werner Busch, Mihail Weller, Anatoliy Lazarevich,Mikhail Schelkunov, Ilya Ilyin, Ivan Aleshkovsky, Tatiana Shestova AbstractThe round table is supposed to discuss philosophical aspects and trends of world development in the context of modern globalization. Special attention will be paid to the causes of the serious aggravation of international relations in the XXI century, as well as the prospects for social development in a multipolar world. The participants of the round table will analyze the real and potential possibilities of stopping the escalation of the global confrontation and on this basis will try to formulate the most optimal conditions for ensuring the security of various countries and peoples. It is quite obvious that peaceful coexistence and effective international cooperation cannot be achieved without an appropriate philosophical outlook, humanitarian education and enlightenment. Posthumanism, Art and PhilosophyOrsola Rignani (Italy) ParticipantsYunus Tuncel, Thomas Steinbuch, Stefan Lorenz Sorgner, Chiarina Chen, Karin Andersen AbstractThe contingencies of global crisis can serve as catalysts for a non-dualistic understanding of the world and the human. Posthumanism, art and philosophy are likely to constitute a virtuous circularity/intertwining/force field/epiphenomenon of this process/twist. From this perspective, the panel intends to propose a discussion around themes deemed crucial, such as hybridization, agency, response-ability. The aesthetics of the monstrous and hybridity will be themed in their expressions of artworks in connection with their philosophical underpinnings of Posthumanism. As well as discussing zoomorphic hybrid iconographies and the rediscovery of the animality of the human. Philosophy of Peace Against War and ViolenceRui Li (China) ParticipantsRui Li, Athanasia Leontsini, Paulos Huang, Weilin Fang, Fan Lu, Yongkui Xiao, Erjia De AbstractThis session discusses the philosophy of peace, war, and violence, their relationship, and how philosophical thinking can promote peace and respect human rights. It explores how violence violates fundamental human rights such as the right to life, liberty, security of person, freedom from torture or cruel treatment. War is the most severe forms of violence that violates fundamental human rights on a massive scale. This panel discussion will also explore how to develop ethical frameworks that promote peaceful coexistence among individuals and societies, and respect for human rights. It introduces the social framework of Anoixist Optimality, which respects freedom to the maximum degree while holding reservations on violence to respect the value of human rights. Reiner Schürmann’s Radical Phenomenology of AnarchéJohn Krummel (USA/Japan) ParticipantsIan Moore, Francesco Guercio, Marcia Cavalcante, Nicolas Schneider AbstractReiner Schürmann, known more, preceding his death, for his provocative readings of Heidegger, Eckhart, and Plotinus, among others, was also known within limited circles for his philosophy of ontological anarché. Schürmann’s attempt to overcome metaphysics as founded upon epochal principles led him to an understanding of being as polymorphic and a-principial, that is, anarchic. The workshop will present Schürmann’s radical phenomenology of ontological anarchy as well as what he called the “double bind” of the human condition from a variety of angles, through his readings of Kant, Eckhart, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and from his early to posthumous works. Post-Kantian Productive Imagination Across CulturesJohn Krummel (USA/Japan) ParticipantsSuzi Adams, Saulius Geniusas, Jodie Heap, Qinjie James Wang, Raquel Bouso AbstractThe workshop will consist of presentations on the concept of the productive imagination stemming from Kant’s work and as developed by post-Kantian thinkers in the centuries following Kant. We find the imagination’s formative function as world-constitutive in a variety of ways, as shown through analyses provided by a variety of thinkers - from Kant to Fichte, Husserl, Heidegger, Cassirer, Miki, Nishitani, Castoriadis, Corbin, and Bachelard - taking the concept in phenomenological, hermeneutical, ontological, and structuralist directions. Moreover, by juxtaposing its productivity or creativity across cultures with Buddhist, Daoist, and Legalist thought in China and Japan, we also gain new insight into the ontology of imagination. From Perception to Virtual Projection: A Philosophical Inquiry into Emerging TechnologyAdma Gama-Krummel (Brazil) ParticipantsRobert Doran, Yoko Arisaka AbstractThe rapid advancement of cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR) has brought about a profound transformation in our society. As these technologies reshape our perception—and even our concept—of reality, it has become increasingly important to engage in deep philosophical reflection. This panel proposes to explore the philosophical presuppositions and implications of these technological transformations. Drawing inspiration from postmodernist and phenomenological as well as other possible approaches, we delve into the chang"
