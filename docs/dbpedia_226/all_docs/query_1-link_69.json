As one of the pioneering fully open access publishers, we firmly believe that unrestricted access to research findings forms the foundation for better transparency, efficiency, and quality control across all scientific disciplines.\n\nIn December 2022, we reached a significant milestone by surpassing one million articles published. That is one million articles freely available to all, to circulate and build upon!\n\nOffering free and immediate access to scientific papers empowers scientists to examine, validate, replicate, and expand upon existing results. This not only helps prevent redundancy and optimizes how resources are used but also paves the way for innovative new approaches.\n\nThe International Open Access Week takes place from 23 to 29 October 2023, providing a unique opportunity to connect the global movement towards open sharing and open science with the progress of policy transformations at the local level.\n\nOur goal, during Open Access Week as well as throughout the year, is to offer resources for educating people about the benefits of open access publishing. The MDPI Blog offers a wealth of information around open access and open science.\n\nPromoting the values of accessibility, transparency, and collaboration\n\nOpen access publishing embodies the fundamental values of democratizing knowledge and fostering global accessibility. It aims to break down barriers that have traditionally limited access to scholarly work, ensuring that knowledge is available to all, regardless of their financial or institutional affiliations.\n\nDiscounts are part of our commitment to ensuring there are diverse pathways to Open Access publishing for researchers worldwide. MDPI supports scientific communities in several different ways.\n\nOne of the key strengths of open access publishing lies in its ability to facilitate interdisciplinary research. By removing paywalls and promoting the sharing of knowledge across disciplines, OA encourages collaboration and innovation. Researchers from diverse fields can access and build upon each other's work, fostering a holistic approach to addressing complex global challenges.\n\nFunders' policies are getting aligned with open science\n\nGovernments, institutions, and funding agencies have recognized the transformative potential of open access and have implemented policies to promote it. These policies often mandate that publicly funded research should be made openly accessible. Such initiatives have accelerated the growth of open access repositories and journals, reinforcing the commitment to open access principles. Check our spotlights on OA policies in the US, EU and China.\n\nOpen access publishing is continually evolving, with innovative and community-driven models and technologies shaping its future. Initiatives like \"Plan S\" and \"cOAlition S\" promote the adoption of OA publishing from the national funders’ perspective by requiring grantees to publish their research openly. A new policy announced by the US administration last year requires that, as of January 2026, all US federally funded research be made freely and immediately available after publication.\n\nAdditionally, preprint servers such as MDPI's Preprints.org, which allow researchers to share their findings before formal peer review, have gained popularity, enhancing the speed at which new knowledge is disseminated. The rise of blockchain technology is also being explored to ensure transparency and authenticity in scholarly publishing.\n\nFor more than twenty years, open access scholarly publishing has been revolutionizing academia by promoting the values of accessibility, transparency, and collaboration. Its support for interdisciplinary research, evolving policies, and innovative practices all contribute to its growing influence in the global research community. As open access continues to expand, it holds the potential to democratize knowledge, advance science, and drive positive societal change.\n\nMDPI is proud to be a leader in the transition to open access.\n\nThe \"Materials Physics\" Section provides a forum for the rapid publication of original works that will significantly advance our current understanding of materials or unveil novel aspects of material physical properties with respect to target applications.\n\nThe Section will comprise, but will be not limited to, contributions on materials growth and processing techniques, microstructural and mechanical engineering, advanced characterization methods, surface and interface engineering of nanostructured and functional materials including metals and alloys, ceramics and coatings, optical and photonic materials, low-dimensional materials, metal oxides and semiconductors for energy and environmental applications, plasmonics and metamaterials, magnetic materials, superconducting and quantum materials, ferroelectrics, multiferroics and magnetoelectrics, thermoelectric materials, polymers, metal-organic materials, and amorphous solids.\n\nWe are pleased to present the 2023 Editor’s Choice Articles, a carefully curated list of high-quality articles from the “Materials Physics” Section listed below:\n\n“Characterization of Filigree Additively Manufactured NiTi Structures Using Micro Tomography and Micromechanical Testing for Metamaterial Material Models”\n\nby Thomas Straub, Jonas Fell, Simon Zabler, Tobias Gustmann, Hannes Korn and Sarah C.

In 2013, he began his current position as a Research Associate Professor at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the same institution. With a deep interest in spin-related phenomena in quantum materials and devices, Prof. Dr. Liu's research focuses on molecular beam epitaxy techniques and the development of integrated nanomaterials and devices based on traditional and magnetic semiconductors, superconductors, quantum and topological materials, and ferromagnetic materials. His groundbreaking contributions have significantly impacted areas such as ferromagnetic semiconductors, Majorana fermions, topological insulators, semiconductor/superconductor heterojunctions, and more. Throughout his career, Prof. Dr. Liu has been actively involved in numerous NSF and DOE-funded projects in condensed matter physics. He has authored over 400 research publications indexed in the Web of Science with an impressive h-index of 46 and has gathered more than 10,000 citations, according to Google Scholar.\n\nThe following is a Q&A with Prof. Dr. Xinyu Liu, who shared his vision for the Section, in addition to his views on the research area and open access publishing:\n\n1. What appealed to you about the journal that made you want to become its Section Editor-in-Chief?\n\nI have always admired the journal for its breadth in covering diverse topics, showcasing the dynamic landscape of materials science. Its commitment to publishing cutting-edge research and maintaining a rigorous yet swift peer-review process has always stood out. As Section Editor-in-Chief, I see an opportunity to influence the direction of discussions within the materials community. Given the journal's global reach and significant impact, it presents the ideal platform for such a role.\n\n2. What is your vision for the Section “Quantum Materials”?\n\nMy vision for “Quantum Materials” is to stand at the forefront of innovation and exploration in the following fields. First and foremost, the Section aims to dive deeper into the realm of quantum simulation. By closely emulating complex quantum systems, we can pave the way for insights that traditional computational methods might overlook, pushing the boundaries of what is scientifically possible. In the field of microelectronics, as devices become progressively smaller and more efficient, quantum materials promise to revolutionize the way we store and process data, not just the miniaturization of components, but a paradigm shift in how they function. In this regard, the Section aims to explore and develop materials that can act as qubits, process quantum information, and maintain quantum coherence, all while reducing the vulnerability to external perturbations. Thus, machine learning and AI are essential to my vision. I believe these tools can significantly expedite the discovery of new quantum materials and optimize their properties. One of the groundbreaking areas I am interested in is the development of room-temperature superconductors. The discovery of such materials can revolutionize power transmission, transportation, and countless technological applications, making them more efficient and sustainable. In essence, “Quantum Materials” seeks to be a beacon of cutting-edge research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and innovative thinking, all directed towards harnessing the quantum realm for a better tomorrow.\n\n3. As an expert in the field of quantum materials, which research topics do you think are popular at present, and what does the future of this field of research look like?\n\nI would like to discuss this with my specific perspective and expertise on spintronics and topological materials.\n\nThe current research in spintronics focuses on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) devices, which are becoming increasingly important for memory storage and magnetic random-access memories (MRAM). In these devices, spin-orbit torques (SOTs) that can harness spin–orbit coupling to manipulate magnetic states offer the potential for faster and more energy-efficient data storage solutions. Furthermore, exploring utilizing spin waves (and their quanta, magnons) for data transfer and processing is gaining attraction.\n\nIn the field of topological materials, observing the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) at higher temperatures in thin films of magnetic topological materials has become a thrilling motivation in the field. There is much interest in hunting for Majorana fermions in topological superconductors, which could be game-changers for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Exploring other 2D topological materials exhibiting exotic topological states are aspect of the future. The confluence of materials science, condensed matter physics, electrical engineering, and even AI for material discovery will shape the evolution of quantum materials research.\n\n4. You have reviewed many articles as a reviewer. What do you think are the most important points of an article?\n\nThe article should offer a fresh perspective, novel findings, or innovative methodologies. It should fill a knowledge gap or provide a unique viewpoint that can stimulate further research or discussion. The article should contribute clearly to its field by introducing a new concept and insight, validating or refuting an existing theory, or providing new empirical evidence that advances understanding.\n\nThe methods used should be relevant to the research questions and the most suitable ones. The choice of methodologies can greatly influence the outcomes, so their justification and appropriateness are vital. An article must demonstrate a thorough and meticulous approach to the research. Central to the credibility of any research is the ability of other researchers to reproduce the experiments and obtain similar results. Clear, detailed experimental procedures, including any controls, must be provided to ensure the reliability of the findings.\n\nAn article should be well-organized, with a logical flow of ideas, making it easy for readers to follow and understand the research narrative.\n\n5. What do you think of the development of open access in the publishing field?\n\nOpen access (OA) has transformed scientific publishing, making research, especially publicly funded studies, accessible worldwide. At its core, science is about the pursuit and distribution of knowledge. Open access embodies this philosophy by ensuring that knowledge is freely accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world. This can significantly accelerate advancements, foster collaborations, and ensure that discoveries are built upon previous findings without impediments. However, OA's rise has led to predatory journals that compromise quality for profit. Despite challenges like the 'author-pays' model, OA's future is promising with growing support and mandates. Ensuring rigorous peer review is essential for the success of OA. Open access should not mean a compromise on quality. While some publishers might prioritize profits, the focus should always be on the integrity and quality of research. Overall, when executed with integrity, OA's benefits surpass its challenges.\n\nWe warmly welcome Prof. Dr. Xinyu Liu as the new Section Editor-in-Chief, and we look forward to him leading Materials to many more milestones.\n\nThe following paper was published in Materials (ISSN: 1996-1944), providing possible breakthroughs regarding Tc calculations for 11-type and 111-type iron-based superconductors:\n\n“Preliminary Tc Calculations for Iron-Based Superconductivity in NaFeAs, LiFeAs, FeSe and Nanostructured FeSe/SrTiO3 Superconductors”\n\nby Chi Ho Wong and Rolf Lortz\n\nMaterials 2023, 16(13), 4674; https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16134674\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/13/4674\n\nOur model has successfully shown that when all relevant conduction electrons interact with local Fe moments in iron-based superconductors, the coexistence of superconductivity with local fluctuating antiferromagnetism together with the induced xy potential can lead to an enormous increase in the electron–phonon coupling, which is sufficient to predict the high Tc values in the studied iron-based superconductors. By applying the model to monolayered FeSe on a SrTiO3 substrate, we have concluded that the interfacial phonons are of major importance to explain the high-temperature superconductivity.\n\nFigure 1. The theoretical and experimental Tc values of (a) NaFeAs, (b) LiFeAs and (c) FeSe are consistent. (d) A FeSe monolayered film is deposited on a SrTiO3 monolayer to form a composite. The offset in theoretical and experimental Tc is 100-91=9K only.\n\nHigh-temperature superconductors are important because they allow for the development of more efficient and powerful technologies. They can be used to create devices with zero electrical resistance, enabling them to conduct electricity without any loss of energy. This makes them ideal for applications such as power transmission lines, magnetic levitation trains, and high-speed computing systems. High-temperature superconductors also have potential applications in medical imaging and quantum computing. One of the families of high-temperature superconductors, iron-based superconductors, has been an area of intense research since its discovery in 2008. The superconducting transition temperature observed in FeSe/SrTiO3 films has been found to be up to 100K. Despite significant advances in understanding the physical properties of these materials, no theoretical calculation of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of iron-based superconductors has been successful so far. This is mainly due to the complexity of the electronic structure and strong electron–electron correlations that are present in these materials. Nevertheless, a team of researchers (Prof. Chi Ho Wong1,2 and Prof. Rolf Lortz1) from the 1Department of Physics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the 2Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University have developed a new model that can calculate the Tc of several iron-based superconductors (bulk FeSe, LiFeAs, NaFeAs and FeSe/SrTiO3 film) with good accuracy; the model was published in Materials. The model may make a significant contribution to the comprehension of superconductivity in iron-based materials.\n\nProf. Wong and Prof. Lortz have recently announced a major breakthrough in the Tc calculation of iron-based superconductors (IBSC) for bulk LiFeAs, NaFeAs, FeSe and FeSe/SrTiO3 film. Although antiferromagnetic-enhanced electron–phonon coupling on the Fermi surface cannot produce such high Tc values, they have created the two-channel model to call out the hidden induced xy potential originating from the out-of-plane phonon under antiferromagnetic fluctuations (abbreviated as the Coh factor), in order to refine the calculation of electron–phonon coupling. Furthermore, they have based their model on ARPES data to consider all relevant electrons participating in iron-based superconductivity (abbreviated as the ARPES factor) instead of solely focusing on the interactions at the Fermi level. In the experimental proof of ARPES, all the relevant electrons in the studied superconductors located in the energy range between EF-EDebye and EF are taken into consideration, with EF being the Fermi energy and EDebye being the Debye Energy. The ARPES factor and Coh factor have made a big step to reduce the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental Tc values of the aforementioned materials. This approach allows their model to reasonably predict the superconducting transition temperatures of bulk LiFeAs, NaFeAs, FeSe as a function of pressure in Figure 1a–c. However, the team was able to calculate the highest-Tc IBSC material, FeSe/SrTiO3 (~100K), only if the effect of interfacial phonon between FeSe and SrTiO3 is considered in Figure 1d, which connects phonons to iron-based superconductivity indirectly. The team is now upgrading the model by considering momentum dependence on the superconducting gap and spin-orbital coupling, etc., and checking whether the model is one of the missing puzzles in a unified theory of iron-based superconductors or not.\n\nWe are pleased to announce the winner of the Materials 2023 Young Investigator Award—Dr. Bharat Gwalani.\n\nName: Dr. Bharat Gwalani\n\nAffiliation: Department of Materials Science and Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA\n\nResearch Interests: alloy design; material processing; corrosion; high entropy alloy; solid phase processing\n\nWe would like to thank the award committee for selecting one winner from many exceptional candidates, Dr. Bharat Gwalani. We will continue to reward scholars with the Young Investigator Award to express our acknowledgment of their support for the Materials (ISSN: 1996-1944). We wish them every success in their careers.\n\nThe following is a short interview with Dr. Bharat Gwalani:\n\n1. Could you briefly introduce yourself to our readers?\n\nSince August 2022, I have served as an Assistant Professor at North Carolina State University, USA. Before that, I worked as a research scientist at the Pacific Northwest International Lab for approximately four years. My primary research revolves around applying solid-phase processing techniques to create innovative multifunctional materials suitable for challenging extreme environments. At present, my team and I are dedicated to advancing our understanding of deformation-based processing methods at the atomic level. We aim to utilize this knowledge for sustainable manufacturing practices, emphasizing energy conservation and using recycled materials, as opposed to traditional melting technologies. Before joining the Pacific Northwest International Lab, I completed my Ph.D. in materials science and engineering at the University of North Texas, USA. During my doctoral studies, my focus was on developing high entropy alloys strengthened by precipitation. In 2010, I earned my bachelor's degree in materials science and engineering from India, my country of origin. Additionally, prior to commencing my Ph.D. program in the United States, I gained three years of experience in the steel manufacturing sector.\n\n2. What is your current research, and why did you choose this research field?\n\nThe focus right now is trying to reduce energy input because natural resources are limited, and there is an energy crisis, so we need to recycle materials that have already been extracted from ore, so the solid phase processing route seems to be a very practical one. Developing new alloys for advanced processing techniques was very exciting to me, so that was my main motivation.\n\n3. Have you encountered any difficulties in your research? How did you overcome them?\n\nWorking at a national laboratory, we are not involved with teaching, but we are involved with multiple projects simultaneously. Switching between each project can be a challenge, particularly in today's competitive environment. It is important to keep learning every day and develop beyond your Ph.D. to continue improving and publishing. The initial phase following a Ph.D. is more difficult, but the different problems inspired me to work hard, and it gave me good exposure and experience. In academia, much time is dedicated to teaching, creating course materials, and helping students while also needing to set up a lab and purchase equipment and pursue funding. Finding funding in areas you want to work in can be a challenge for all new researchers. However, teaching helps you go back to fundamentals which reaffirms your knowledge, so it is a good thing.\n\n4. What qualities do young scholars need to possess?\n\nI think it is very important not to give up easily. Things can be very challenging and can easily seem as if they will not work out, but persistence and drive to keep trying, and also to not feel embarrassed about failing, really helps. Just because it did not work today does not mean the approach you are taking is bad. It just was not your day. Keep going and take baby steps, and it will eventually happen. It is also important to manage your time effectively, to make the most of your time at work and still have a life outside of work. It is different from studying for a Ph.D. because, as a researcher, you work during your stipulated hours, so it is much more important to become efficient at an early stage of your research career.\n\n5. Can you briefly describe the key to a happy laboratory life?\n\nA lab is made up of different members, from the PI to the students, and they work as a cohesive unit. The ‘team’ feeling is very important, and if members are happy to do work rather than feel pushed, then that has long-term benefits. It is important to have fun when you work, so creating that environment in the lab is my focus. I used to enjoy my Ph.D. because I was doing research for myself rather than for somebody else, which helped me a lot.\n\n6. As the winner of this award, is there something you want to express or someone to thank?\n\nThroughout my career, I have been fortunate to encounter influential individuals who have played pivotal roles in shaping my professional journey. In my initial job at Jindal Stainless Ltd., Dr. L.K. Singhal, the Director of R&D, served as a catalyst, encouraging and inspiring me to explore my curiosity and think outside the box. This guidance ultimately motivated me to pursue a Ph.D., as I realized the significance of nurturing that inner drive. During my Ph.D., I was fortunate to have Dr. Raj Banerjee as my advisor, who struck a perfect balance between providing guidance and fostering independence. His mentorship empowered me to push boundaries and develop my own unique path of research. Similarly, in my previous position at PNNL, the support from leaders such as Dr. Cindy Powell, the Chief Science and Technology Officer, was exceptional. Their dedication to nurturing younger scientists and providing valuable guidance greatly influenced my professional development.\n\nAs a recent addition to the NC State community, I have already experienced tremendous support from Dr. Don Brenner, the department head. His unwavering support has been invaluable since joining the university. Personally, I have been fortunate to receive support from numerous individuals who have propelled me forward in life. This support is crucial for anyone striving to make progress, as the trust and belief others have in you serve as powerful motivators.\n\nThe Section “Materials Simulation and Design” focuses on all aspects of inorganic and organic material properties, advances in the synthesis, processing, characterization, testing and design of materials and engineering systems, applications in technology, and the modeling and simulation of a broad range of materials, including ceramics, metals, glasses, semiconductors, polymers, biological materials, composites, etc. Papers on solid materials, interfaces, and material issues associated with surfaces, defects, and the microstructure are of particular interest.\n\nWe are pleased to present the 2023 Editor’s Choice Articles, a carefully curated list of high-quality articles from the Section “Materials Simulation and Design”:\n\n“Modeling Cyclic Crack Propagation in Concrete Using the Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method Coupled with the Cumulative Damage-Plasticity Constitutive Law”\n\nby Omar Alrayes, Carsten Könke, Ean Tat Ooi and Khader M.

Thin film materials are widespread for technological applications, spanning from electronics through medicine. Thin film materials can exhibit a greater number of vastly different structural, chemical, electrical, optical, and mechanical properties compared to their corresponding bulk counterparts due to the choice of substrate or underlying material, the material deposition and fabrication process, and the resulting variations in the crystal phase, disorder and defects within poly-/nano-crystalline and amorphous materials, strain, and composition. The very nature of thin films involves the formation of interfaces, including that with the substrate, underlying or overlying layers, and/or the ambient. These interfaces and interfacial regions may exhibit additional variations due to confinement, bonding configurations, chemical composition, exposure to ambient, physical mixing, and the morphology present.\n\nWe are pleased to present the 2023 Editor’s Choice Articles, a carefully curated list of high-quality articles from the Section “Thin Films and Interfaces” listed below.\n\n“Analyzing the Bolometric Performance of Vanadium Oxide Thin Films Modified by Carbon Nanotube Dispersions”\n\nby Usha Philipose, Chris Littler, Yan Jiang, Alia Naciri, Michael Harcrow and A.

Papers may be submitted via the following link: https://susy.mdpi.com/user/manuscripts/upload?journal=materials.\n\nLaunching a Special Issue:\n\nYou have the opportunity to propose hot topics and edit a Special Issue together with experts in the field.\n\nJoining the Editorial Board:\n\nIf you are an active researcher in the field of optics and photonics, and are interested in joining the Editorial Board, please do not hesitate to get in touch ([email protected]).\n\nMaterials Editorial Office\n\nAs the Editors-in-Chief of Materials (ISSN: 1996-1944), we are pleased to announce the winners of the Materials 2023 Travel Award—Dr. Barbara Tomadoni and Ms. Farah Daou.\n\nWith so many high-quality applicants, the evaluation process and the final decision were challenging. We want to thank all applicants for submitting their diverse and fascinating range of research topics.\n\nThe following is an interview with Dr. Barbara Tomadoni:\n\n1. Can you briefly introduce yourself to our readers and tell us a little bit about your fields of interest?\n\nMy name is Barbara Tomadoni. I have focused my research on bio-based materials. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher as part of the Group of Technology and Design of Multicomponent Products, at the University of Sevilla, Spain, where I work developing bio-based superabsorbent materials.\n\n2. Which research topics do you think will be of particular interest to the research community in the coming years?\n\nThere are many trending topics in different areas that are of interest to the community in general. For example, data science and artificial intelligence have progressed rapidly in recent years. In medicine, genomics is an interesting and fast-growing research topic. In every scientific area, research is focusing on sustainability, aiming to achieve a circular economy and the replacement of petroleum-derived products and water treatments, among many others. Some trending topics particularly interesting in the materials field include nanotechnology, 3D printing, the replacement of lithium batteries, and the development of tailor-made functional materials.\n\n3. Can you briefly describe the key to a happy laboratory life?\n\nFor me, one of the key elements to a happy lab life is to have the freedom and independence to work and to express your ideas. Collaboration with your peers is an essential part as well since teamwork is key to conducting successful research. The head of the lab is also an important factor in the life of the researchers, as this person will have a tremendous impact on their scientific and academic careers: a good leader is key to a happy lab life. Last but not least, it is very important to have a proper work–life balance, to avoid burnout and to reach your full potential, which is easier said than done.\n\n4. What is your opinion of the Open Access model of publishing?\n\nI believe that making research widely available to everyone contributes to higher quality research and will boost innovation. It is also important to have a proper research data management plan. For example, depositing research data within the university or institution repository. Making sure that data are available also guarantees the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and contributes to open science.\n\n5. As the winner of this award, is there something you would like to express?\n\nI would like to thank the Materials journal and MDPI for this award that will allow me to attend the Seventh International Symposium Frontiers in Polymer Science in Gothenburg, Sweden. This will give me the opportunity to connect with the materials community, share our latest findings on superabsorbent materials based on protein, and expand my network and learn about the latest research in the polymer field.\n\nThe following is an interview with Ms. Farah Daou:\n\n1. Can you briefly introduce yourself to our readers and tell us a little bit about your fields of interest?\n\nI am originally from Lebanon and moved to Italy as a research fellow. I am currently studying for my Ph.D. and my experiments are aimed at applications in real-life bone healing. I was interested in a European project, where I was introduced to Prof. Montini and began my journey in this field.\n\n2. Which research topics do you think will be of particular interest to the research community in the coming years?\n\nOne of the most important challenges for the future is the global aging population, with the number of people aged 65 and over increasing significantly compared to younger age groups. It is researchers' responsibility to maintain the older population's physical and cognitive health, and therefore work on cartilage and bone regeneration is essential due to a high proportion of older people being significantly impacted by these issues, not only physically, but also through harm to their mental health.\n\n3. Can you briefly describe the key to a happy laboratory life?\n\nFirst of all, my group is very international and this is amazing. It adds the benefit of getting to know other people's cultures, but also adds different approaches to science and lab work, which gives the chance to improve your own knowledge and learn from others. It is important to accept an old saying from the Greek philosopher Socrates, 'I know that I know nothing'. Having intellectual humility helps in science, as it improves communication between researchers of all experiences and fields. Being able to ask about a topic that you do not know about creates an empowering environment, so it is important for research quality and morale. Science is interdisciplinary, so collaboration is necessary. This is the key to a happy lab life: collaboration and cooperation.\n\n4. What is your opinion of the Open Access model of publishing?\n\nI could not do experiments, research and write my thesis without access to articles. Therefore, I am an advocate for an Open Access model. I commented that both the publisher and authors should get their rights to the paper, which is a very important consideration. Publishing is becoming unaffordable, which drives the gap between smaller groups with limited resources that cannot pay for publishing and bigger groups who can afford to carry on and grow. Therefore, some further balance is needed, because allowing access to all is essential for having a proper scientific dialogue.\n\n5. As the winner of this award, is there something you would like to express?\n\nFirst of all, I want to thank Prof. Montini as the lab director for giving me the chance to come to Italy despite my limited experience; she opened the door of knowledge for me. When I moved to Italy, I came to understand how big research groups work and how research in developed countries is on another level. I would also like to thank all the people she works with, in the center for autoimmune and allergic diseases. Finally, I would like to thank all of my family members who have supported me, which I cannot go without.\n\nOn behalf of the assessment committee, we wish to congratulate the winners on their accomplishments.\n\nThe Section “Biomaterials” of Materials (ISSN: 1996-1944) covers all aspects of the biomaterials field with a highly interdisciplinary scope, from the synthesis, processing, characterization, and testing to the biomedical applications of biomaterials. Topics of interest for this Section include but are not limited to materials for implants and prosthetic devices (orthopedic, cardiovascular, and other applications), bioactive and cell instructive materials, nanostructured biomaterials and nanoparticles, scaffolds for tissue engineering, biomedical coatings and antibacterial surfaces, materials for drug delivery carriers, tissue/biomaterial interfaces, and studies on clinical applications of biomaterials. Of special interest are papers that present the interaction of biomaterials and the biological environment, e.g., cell biology (in vitro) studies on biomaterials, microbiology interactions with materials (e.g., antibacterial materials), as well as in vivo studies that take the field closer to translation to clinical applications. Papers can present experimental or theoretical studies and should focus both on the “material” and on the “bio” component of biomaterials.\n\nWe are pleased to present the 2023 Editor’s Choice Articles, a carefully curated list of high-quality articles from the Section “Biomaterials” listed below:\n\n“The Spray-Dried Alginate/Gelatin Microparticles with Luliconazole as Mucoadhesive Drug Delivery System”\n\nby Marta Szekalska, Magdalena Wróblewska, Anna Czajkowska-Kośnik, Katarzyna Sosnowska, Paweł Misiak, Agnieszka Zofia Wilczewska and Katarzyna Winnicka\n\nMaterials 2023, 16(1), 403; https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16010403\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/1/403\n\n“A Novel Chitosan Composite Biomaterial with Drug Eluting Capacity for Maxillary Bone Regeneration”\n\nby Barbara Giordano-Kelhoffer, Raquel Rodríguez-Gonzalez, Marina Perpiñan-Blasco, Jenifer O.

Thin film materials are widespread for technological applications, spanning from electronics through medicine. Thin film materials can exhibit a greater number of vastly different structural, chemical, electrical, optical, and mechanical properties compared to their corresponding bulk counterparts due to the choice of substrate or underlying material, the material deposition and fabrication process, and the resulting variations in crystal phase, disorder and defects within poly-/nano-crystalline and amorphous materials, strain, and composition. The very nature of thin films involves the formation of interfaces, including that with the substrate, underlying or overlying layers, and/or the ambient. These interfaces and interfacial regions may exhibit additional variations due to confinement, bonding configurations, chemical composition, exposure to ambient, physical mixing, and the morphology present.\n\nWe are pleased to present the 2022 Editor’s Choice Articles, a carefully curated list of high-quality articles from the Section “Thin Films and Interfaces” listed below:\n\n“Tuning of the Titanium Oxide Surface to Control Magnetic Properties of Thin Iron Films”\n\nby Juliusz Chojenka, Arkadiusz Zarzycki, Marcin Perzanowski, Michał Krupiński, Tamás Fodor, Kálmán Vad and Marta Marszałek\n\nMaterials 2023, 16(1), 289; https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16010289\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/1/289\n\n“Deposition of Sol–Gel ZnO:Mg Films and Investigation of Their Structural and Optical Properties”\n\nby Tatyana Ivanova, Antoaneta Harizanova, Tatyana Koutzarova, Benedicte Vertruyen and Raphael Closset\n\nMaterials 2022, 15(24), 8883; https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15248883\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/24/8883\n\n“Hybrid Dispersion Model Characterization of PAZO Azopolymer Thin Films over the Entire Transmittance Spectrum Measured in the UV/VIS/NIR Spectral Region”\n\nby Dorian Minkov, Lian Nedelchev, George Angelov, Emilio Marquez, Blaga Blagoeva, Georgi Mateev and Dimana Nazarova\n\nMaterials 2022, 15(23), 8617; https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15238617\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/23/8617\n\n“Effects of Cold Rolling Reduction on Microstructure, Thickness, Adhesive Force of Al-Si Coating and on Bending Toughness of Al-Si Coated Press-Hardened Steel”\n\nby Xue Feng, Xianlei Hu and Xianghua Liu\n\nMaterials 2023, 16(1), 4; https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16010004\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/1/4\n\n“Polycrystalline PbTe:In Films on Amorphous Substrate: Structure and Physical Properties”\n\nby Vadim Kovalyuk, Evgeniia Sheveleva, Mark Auslender, Gregory Goltsman, Roni Shneck and Zinovi Dashevsky\n\nMaterials 2022, 15(23), 8383; https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15238383\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/23/8383\n\n“Effect of Substrate Temperature on the Structural, Optical and Electrical Properties of DC Magnetron Sputtered VO2 Thin Films”\n\nby Chunzi Zhang, Ozan Gunes, Shi-Jie Wen, Qiaoqin Yang and Safa Kasap\n\nMaterials 2022, 15(21), 7849; https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15217849\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/21/7849\n\n“Characterization of Porous CuO Films for H2S Gas Sensors”\n\nby Dawoon Jung, Sehoon Hwang, Hyun-Jong Kim, Jae-Hee Han and Ho-Nyun Lee\n\nMaterials 2022, 15(20), 7270; https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15207270\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/20/7270\n\nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank all the research groups that submitted to Materials.

My research has led to very significant contributions in the development of new biomaterials for hard tissues substitution, dental implants, superelastic and shape memory alloys applied in biomedical applications, bioactive and osseoinductive materials, bacteriostatic and bactericide surfaces, biofunctionalized strategies, and the study of the mechanisms that control the interactions between biomaterials and cells or tissues. This has been possible thanks to having a team with a marked interdisciplinary character.\n\nI have participated in numerous projects funded by national and international entities with very active international involvement, especially through European projects such as Reborne (2010‒2015) and Innovabone (2011‒2015), both in the field of biomaterials for bone regeneration. I have authored 370 research publications indexed in the Web of Science (h-index 57) and more than 11.150 citations (Google Academic) and have contributed to more than 275 international congresses. I have edited 10 books and authored 47 book chapters. At several foreign universities, I have been a visiting lecturer, such as the University of Southampton (UK), University of Michigan (US), University of Minnesota (US), UTSA-Health Campus (University of Texas, San Antonio, US), Universidade do Coimbra and Porto (P), and Universidad Nacional Autonoma de México (UNAM), and I have delivered more than 70 invited lectures at international conferences. Mentoring young researchers has been a central part of my activities, with the supervision of 36 Ph.D. theses (36 presented and 6 more ongoing) and 12 Postdoctoral fellows, as well as 62 master theses and final engineering projects. I have been actively involved in translating research into clinical practice and the industrial sector, being the author of 6 patents licensed to companies and in operation. The Klockner ContacTi dental implant, which is used internationally and one of the best-selling dental implants in Spain, is the result of a patent. In 2013, I participated as a founding partner in the creation of the Spin-Off Company Mimetis Biomaterials, (https://www.mimetis.com/en/). In 2021, the company employed 15 employees.\n\nI was President of the Iberian Society of Biomechanics and Biomaterials and, in 2014, I organized, as vice-president, the International Congress of Ceramics in Medicine, Bioceramics 26, in Barcelona and the 17th European Conference on Biomaterials. Additionally, I participated in the European Society for Biomaterials in Barcelona 2002 as the vice-president.\n\nIn 2020, I received the Prize for the Best Scientific Career in the Field of Materials Science and Technology (Materials Science Society). Since 2018, I have been the International Research Advisor to the MDRCBB-Minnesota Dental Research Center for Biomaterials and Biomechanics of the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry. I received the Award of Honour Sociedad Española de Implantes in 2021. I am a numerary member of the Royal European Academy of Doctors and Royal Academy of Dentistry, which I became in 2013, and became, on 14 March 2018, Doctor Honoris Causa for the Universidad de La Habana (Cuba), which was actually proposed by the Universidad de Sevilla.\n\nThe following is a short Q&A with Prof. Dr. Javier Gil, who shared his vision for the Section with us as well as his views on the research area and Open Access publishing:\n\n1. What appealed to you about the journal that made you want to become its Section Editor-in-Chief?\n\nOver the last few years, I have been able to publish several contributions of my research in biomaterials in Materials and I have been an editor of several Special Issues. The scientific rigor, the good work of the reviewers, and the agility of the journal have been reasons for Materials to be a publication channel for our research group. I am proud and very excited to contribute to the growth of the journal.\n\n2. What is your vision for the Section?\n\nThe number of research projects in biomaterials is steadily increasing and publication in this field is growing exponentially. Materials for health are key for people who are living longer and longer. Biomaterials aim to improve the quality of life and health of all human beings. In my opinion, this Section is one of the most important in Materials.\n\n3. What does the future of this field of research look like?\n\nNew biomaterials, biofunctionalization of implantable materials with specific missions, new methods of shaping biomaterials such as 3D printing and laser, advances in materials for regenerative medicine, bioactive materials, and bio-instructive materials are aspects of the future. It should be noted that biomaterial"
