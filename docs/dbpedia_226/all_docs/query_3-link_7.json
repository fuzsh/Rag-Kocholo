We gratefully acknowledge and thank Bruno Di Marino, Adriano Aprà and Sandra Lischi, for their kind correspondence. We wish to pay tribute to and acknowledge the entrepreneurship and career of Silvano Cavatorta – co-founder with Pedote of Filmmaker Coop – as well as those of Americo Sbardella and Enzo Ungari – who were among the founders of the Filmstudio. The composition and compilation of the various chapters in this anthology have greatly benefitted from the number of artists, cineastes, institutions and foundations who have kindly assisted us in various ways, particularly with the collection of still photographs that appear in several chapters. We therefore acknowledge and thank all of them, including Luca Maria Patella, Andrea Piccardo, Massimo Bacigalupo, Silvano Agosti, Giovanna Brebbia, Paolo Gioli and the critic Roberta Valporta, as well as the Ugo La Pietra Foundation, Marinella Pirelli Foundation, the Cineteca Nazionale – Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome, and the several centres, institutions, professionals, curators and individuals, who have in various ways made the work on this volume possible and, if not effortless, at least easier to bring to fruition and complete. We thank the various scholars who contributed to the anthology, and who have undertaken to conduct research in this burgeoning field of study as well as, in several cases, carry out interviews with the artists and filmmakers whose work is herein discussed, and which constitutes a sample of a larger and rich tableau of Italian visual, documentary, and moving image arts. May we also remember our dear colleague Sara Iommi, who passed away prematurely, before she could bring to fruition her proposal for this anthology. We finally extend our appreciation and thanks to the various people at Edinburgh University Press and their associates, Gillian Leslie, Richard Strachan, Rebecca Mackenzie, Eliza Wright, Helena Heald and George MacBeth, for the kind assistance, sensitivity and professionalism they have shown throughout the publication process, which brings this very first anthology, in the English language on the topic, to the world.\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd xii\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\nI NT RO DUCTION Anthony Cristiano and Carlo Coen\n\nForms of experimentalism and independence in the panorama of Italian cinema date back to the birth of cinema, and have continued to emerge and develop, with varying intensity, throughout the history of Italian filmmaking. Overall, the same cinematic, artistic and anthropological merits have been largely overlooked by the official academies of human and social sciences, both within and beyond the nation’s borders. The historical avant-garde phenomenon of the Italian Futurists, with their excursions into various forms of art, are an exception, probably due to their provocative nature, systematic propositions and revolutionary intentions. Italian fringe-like work in the cinema has received institutional ‘adoption’, and subsequent attention by mainstream venues, only when its narrative has complied with marketable agendas – such is the case from the silent period to Rossellini’s postwar films.1 Forms of independence or experimentalism, which were deemed extravagant, idiosyncratic, or marginal, remained largely unnoticed and unappreciated, even by experts in the field of visual-arts. In recent decades, however, a number of Italian scholars, and scholars of Italian descent, have questioned the lack of attention, study and analysis, given to unconventional forms of Italian cinema, its peculiar character and practices. Other national histories have exhibited a similar pattern, as supported by cases such as that of P. Adams Sitney – one of the rare historians of neglected forms of American experimental cinema – who happened to also write in the 1990s about the crisis within Italian cinema. In Italy, an increasing number of film historians and scholars are picking up on the wealth and body of work of experimental and independent Italian cinema. The ‘discovery’ via cinema d’essai and cineclub festivals, as well as gallery and media-lab exhibits, of alternative forms of art and modes of dissemination, has led to systematic studies into and penetrating criticism of the significance and import of art expressions, and forms of independence, that mirror novel socio-cultural trends as well as alternative, innovative, or revolutionary worldviews. Italian cinema has been at the forefront of international film practices throughout several\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 1\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\n2\n\nANTHONY CRISTIANO AND CARLO COEN\n\nperiods of cinematic history, for its originality and independence, as well as its ground-breaking styles, techniques and thematic concerns. Such has been the case since Giovanni Pastrone (1883–1959), through the lost films of the Futurists, to Roberto Rossellini (1906–77), Ermanno Olmi, Cesare Zavattini (1902–89),2 Pier Paolo Pasolini (1922–75), Nanni Moretti3 and Silvio Soldini4 – to mention only a few names associated with a distinctive legacy of certain forms of experimentalism or independent praxis and attitudes within their respective milieus. Though scholars have acknowledged the interdisciplinarity of Italian cinematic tradition and of individual cineastes, the further cinematic legacy of ‘underground’ practices of experimental and independent cinema has been neglected. Furthermore, the subject matter is scarcely known in the English-speaking world, and thus has received little to no attention in English language literature and anthologies – even when these are devoted to socio-cultural histories and art criticism. No introductory monograph or systematic study on Italian experimental and independent cinema has been released in book format to the English-speaking world to this day. This volume therefore constitutes an initial attempt to supplant the lack of academic treatises in the English language and, thus, to provide a first and introductory study and collection of essays on the topic. A look at the terminology adopted helps to place the experimental and independent cinema phenomena into a historical context and distinguish the characteristics which are peculiar to the Italian panorama. Scholars have regularly found forms of continuation between different cinematic epochs, for instance Antonio Costa, Bruno Di Marino and others who have identified a continuation of Futurist approaches in film practices of the 1930s and beyond.5 Throughout the last century, a host of terms have been deployed to describe unconventional practices of filmmaking. They may refer to the procedures adopted and/or the peculiar nature and general aim of a single work, or body of work, in opposition to standards of mainstream practices. In Italy, as well as in European and North American contexts, scholars have referred to unconventional cinema as experimental, alternative, expanded, different, subversive, abstract, underground and so forth. For the purposes of this volume, we opted for the general designation of ‘experimental and independent cinema’. The expression is meant to include a variety of practices and forms: art film, avant-garde, experimental, expanded, artisanal, political, low-budget, as well as unknown or neglected directors and artists – deserving of greater attention – controversial or otherwise extreme in their treatments and approaches. While the multiplicity of categorisations may underscore the need to indicate a given study’s purpose or perspective, whether historical, anthropological, or aesthetic, there also appears to\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 2\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n3\n\nbe an underlying common denominator in terms of atypical or pioneering procedures, their formal approaches and their content. The appropriateness of the words ‘experimental’ and ‘independent’ lies in the critical use of the terms, that is, the application of the historical, artistic and socio-cultural, notions summoned. Scholars have repeatedly detected, and enunciated on, forms of experimentation and independence regardless of categorisations, in both unconventional and mainstream film practices. Some have employed the term ‘independent’ and ‘experimental’ to refer to the Italian cinematic renaissance during the late twentieth century – as in Zagarrio.6 The same terms7 have been applied to several epochs and trends by Paolo Bertetto, Paolo D’Agostini, Bruno Di Marino, Sandra Lischi and several others. Though useful, ‘independent cinema’, and ‘experimental cinema’, are very fluid and continuously debated notions – particularly by filmmakers themselves. Scholars and filmmakers adapt them to peculiar critiques and visions, at times antithetical to each other. To the new poetics involving the relationship between filmmaker and reader/spectator, is added the explorative relationship between filmmaker and art form. Maverick filmmakers (Gianfranco Brebbia, and Silvano Agosti, among several others) have come to hold idealistic views and have referred to independent filmmaking as a ‘total devotion’ to the art form, or ‘total freedom’ in matter of practices, or have sought ‘purity’ of form, concerns and style. It must be acknowledged that whilst the individual approach of independent artists to filmmaking practices may be quite different (especially in terms of concerns and style), several of them nonetheless share a totalising view of cinema as a creative process, from production, to distribution, to exhibition. Scholars interested in socio-cultural readings, have historicised or critiqued experimental and independent film as politically subversive or nonconforming, at other times they have been attracted by the self-reflexive and expanded nature and use of the medium. The field is immensely varied, and any attempt to encompass it into a single and constraining theoretical template is destined to fail. Experimental and independent cinema has been particularly and frequently used to designate the work and practices of nuovi autori (new auteurs), to refer to low budget productions, to denote the movements such as the Cooperativa del Cinema Indipendente (CCI, Co-operative of Independent Cinema), the officina di ricerca (experimentation labs) such as those of animation practices, as well as unconventional production, distribution and exhibition methods, and new technological developments within moving images, such as videoarte and poetronica (video-art and poetronics), and the like. What is more important is that the expression ‘experimental and independent cinema’ meets both the denotative and connotative requirements of a\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 3\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\n4\n\nANTHONY CRISTIANO AND CARLO COEN\n\nversatile lexis. Forms of experimentation, avant-gardism, unconventional approaches and techniques, innovative modus operandi or styles, all denote one or more forms of self-determining practices. All refer to the ability to identify irregular patterns, novel expressions, revolutionary methods and styles, whether they expand, challenge, or alter, one’s expectations or preconceived notions of the nature and aims of art, and in the case in point of moving-image-arts, they are understood as a way of locating innovation and originality in artists and forms that stray from ‘the given path’ of traditional canons. For the artists it may amount to a claim of individuality and independence, or to the exploration of new aesthetic potentials and technical processes; the marking of uncharted territories, rather than conformity to, or the perpetuation of, habitual and ‘safer’ conventional practices.\n\nFrom Legacies to Transformations The transformations of Italian independent and experimental cinema are informed by the same cultural, socio-political and technological shifts and yearnings, informing the milieu of the periods in which they emerged. Within the ‘western cinematic canon’ – transposing a literary term to the art of moving-image – the underground and experimental scene of the late 1960s and onward, may have gained renown for its political and stylistic ‘revolutionary’ propositions, however its approaches and concerns are not entirely new, but are rather informed by preceding legacies and histories. Italian independent and experimental practices and cinema emerged very early within the history of world cinema, and have been much emulated eversince. They begin with the early film pioneers, gain explosive impulse with the Futurists and re-emerge, metamorphosed into new forms of artistry and craftsmanship, during the mid to late twentieth century. The artistic, performative and anthropological quality, of its approach and vision, are among the chief characteristic of Italian experimental and independent cinema. The field is offset by artists deemed impegnati (socially engaged) and politici (politicised), on one hand, and by those deemed ‘lyrical’ and ‘abstract’, on the other. The poetic and metacinematic function is counterbalanced by its antithesis, the storytelling and narrative thrust. The peculiar stock of the centenary-old Italian artistic tradition has informed the literary and visual art initiatives and movements throughout history as well as individual Italian artists’ practices, in various fields. This includes the advent of moving-image arts, in a country renowned for its contribution to the screen-arts – along with counterparts such as French, German and Swedish, cinemas – since the birth of film.\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 4\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n5\n\nWhether we look at tematiche (themes, motifs) or qualità formali (formal qualities), at historical avant-garde movements or at contemporary experimental practices, independent forms of Italian cinema have set the tone, modus operandi and concerns for many unconventional approaches since the dawn of the new medium, their attractive qualities and character. This is not only the case for the cinematic excursions of the Futuristi (Futurists) but also with many classic and neo-classic directors and movements as well. The inventiveness and openness to new ways of seeing and perceiving is found in different ‘eras’, or periods, within the development of Italian cinema and the history of the country. As Bernardi put it, speaking of the second wave of early Italian auteurs: [T]he 1930s group of auteurs and films referred to as formalism or calligraphism is an important episode in the history of cinema because, regardless of the aesthetic results that may be sometimes questionable, it presupposes or, even better, opens up a different way of watching the film, intending it as visual art and not as mere entertainment, and sets times and modes of vision very different from the classic ones.8\n\nEarly experimentation with the new art of cinema is detectable in emblematic figures such as the directors Giovanni Pastrone and Enrico Guazzoni (1876–1949), among other influential pioneers. Italian cinema is also known for its lavish scenography, and early use of colour. The results achieved by the Società Italiana Cines, in Rome, as seen in the 1906 Le farfalle (Butterflies), surpassed the stencil colouring of the renowned Pathé company in Vincennes, France. The Museo Nazionale del Cinema (National Museum of Cinema) in Turin prides itself for the preservation of pioneering works and artefacts. The Italian tradition in matters of screen arts enjoyed much verve and inventiveness since the début of the new art form. From the late 1960s onwards, Italian experimental and independent filmmakers did not merely emulate their American counterparts, but rather drew inspiration from their own tradition of the arts and art movements: painting, theatre, music history, vanguardism and so forth. We are reminded that in the 1910s, and for several decades afterward, the Futurists’ totalising vision incorporated the ‘renovation’ of film as an art, with provocative and exhilarating works. Among them the artists and directors, Anton Giulio Bragaglia (1890–1960), Arnaldo Ginna (1890–1982) and Bruno Corra (1892–1976), headed up some of the most innovative productions. The silent film Thaïs, directed by Bragaglia in 1917, and jealously conserved at the Cinémathèque Française in Paris, is a chief example of choreographic explorations. The painter Enrico Prampolini (1894–1956),\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 5\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\n6\n\nANTHONY CRISTIANO AND CARLO COEN\n\ndevised for the film a series of geometric figures and patterns in a singular spatial-landscape construction of the set, which mirrors the turbulent cycles of the narrative along with the momentous quality of its characters. The achievement – culminating with the exhilarating symbolism in the concluding moments of the film – may be seen as the start of the imaginative flux of much anti-naturalistic cinema afterwards (beginning with German expressionism).9 Millicent Marcus referred to it as the beginning of Futurist cinema, and noted its prototypic ‘scenoplasticity’. Speaking of its innovation and legacy the scholar wrote that, among other things, the end of Thaïs can be seen as the culmination of the project to develop the filmic arts medium-specific powers of transcendence.10 Brothers Ginna and Corra, whose Futurist films are unfortunately lost, are also recognised for their atypical and innovative work in the visual arts – preceding and influencing subsequent filmmakers such as Hans Richter and Walter Rittmann. Ginna, in particular, was an abstract painter, who as a Futurist sought in the ideal form of cinema – its composition, mechanism, dynamism, movement, musicality – the ‘purest’ expression of one’s deepest sense, akin to chromaticism in music. Inspired by classical music, in his cinepitture (cine-paintings) shorts he applied unconventional techniques to ‘translate’ musical pieces into hand-coloured filmic symphonies – emulating his own canvas work, his 1908 Nevrastenia, the 1911 La musica della danza and other paintings. The undiluted ‘transposition’ of raw human emotions and moods into colour tonalities was seen as a primary function of the new medium of film. The multiform, polyvalent and plurally expressive, impetus of the Futurists, are a pivotal and provocative expression of revolutionary experimentation and independence. Their nonconforming and ‘rebellious’ rapport for various forms of media pave the way and set the tone for, several other artists and auteurs of subsequent periods, including the wave of much experimental and independent practices. In fact, such early characteristics recur in subsequent decades, including the late 1960s and early 1970s – the neo-futurism found in art, design and architecture, is well known and, among the work referred to in this anthology, Mario Schifano’s own Futurismo Rivisitato (Futurism Revisited, 1965) represents a tribute to this historical movement. The independent studios and co-ops, as well as the practices of several individual Italian artists and filmmakers, throughout the mid to late twentieth century, are characterised by a propulsive movement forward and by an openness to the stimuli of the cultural and socio-political milieu of the counterculture – including their most paradoxical and superficial interpretations. It is the aesthetic quality and texture, the inventiveness, the performative nature, the musicality, along with the personal dimension, informed by a long and rich tradition\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 6\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n7\n\nof Italic arts in general that distinguishes experimental and independent Italian cinematic practices from their foreign counterparts – including in neighbouring France and, long-time followers of the development of the Italian scene, Germany and Britain. During the ‘underground’ period, one London writer, on a visit to Italy, eulogised the abilities and visual achievements of Italian filmmakers who worked on 8mm – an ‘inferior’ film gauge – compared to their English counterparts, who could afford 16mm. Though he noted the political inefficiency in regard to the organisation and running of collective initiatives, he lauded its aesthetic prowess.11 Perhaps suprisingly such ‘anarchist’ traits only appear to have contributed to the radical beauty and nature of much experimental and independent cinema. It may be that the very ‘exhaustion’ of such countercultural trends – among other dynamics – was one of the factors contributing to the demise of the self-run labs and co-ops of independent visual artists and filmmakers. Within the history of Italian cinema, scholars have recognised a nontraditional tendency in style and language: the reference to periodic formal experimentations, in several Italian auteurs throughout the twentieth century, not only as an anti-realist vein running vis-à-vis the (controversial) ‘realist cinematic tradition’ of Italy, but moreover as an interpretative framework through which one may look at the world anew. If such a proposition proves true for narrative and generic forms of cinema, as expounded upon by Bertetto and Minuz in ‘Le forme antirappresentative nel cinema italiano’ (‘The Anti-Representation Approaches/Forms of Italian Cinema’), how much more it ought to do so for counterintuitive, unconventional, or radical forms of moving-image making. Italian visual artists, storytellers and a number of artisanal-like minds, have veered towards filmmaking to explore new expressive avenues, mechanisms and forms. From a purely aesthetic standpoint, this has been the case with the classic vanguard movements such as the surrealists. The European and Italian cultural and political climate of 1968 intensified the trend in purely aesthetic terms rather than interrupting its forward movement – though no claims of continuity are made. A systematic attempt to initiate collectives of Italian independent and underground cinema began in the late 1960s. One seminal event that contributed to paving the way towards the creation of co-ops was the exhibition of the New American Cinema in 1961, in Spoleto, followed by a number of other film festivals throughout the decade, in various cities, including Rapallo, Pesaro, Rome and Turin. Some of these saw several North American counterparts, such as Jonas Mekas, Gregory Markopoulos, Taylor Mead and Jack Smith, attend the screenings. They met with\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 7\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\n8\n\nANTHONY CRISTIANO AND CARLO COEN\n\na number of Italian artists, some of whom found further inspiration in the American’s radical, if not adamantly politicised, use of film equipment and cameras. Italian filmmakers, however, had background experience in theatre arts – though to different degrees. As Sergio Toffetti, writer of ‘Before and After the Revolution: Experimental Cinema in Italy’, recounts, the Living Theatre group also played an important role in shaping the vision of the Italian artist working in film: The impact of the Living Theatre – who later would be featured in an excellent film by Alfredo Leonardi (Living and Glorious 1965) – reinforces on the one hand the sense of the group, of the militant collective, and on the other the perception that the body is a medium, a fundamental intermediary for the encounter/clash between the inner self and outer reality, and thus for the political transformation of the world.12\n\nSuch trends in the arts are comparable to the ongoing search for new modes of expression; a new lens through which to look at the outer and inner realities of one’s world. This is done via a melange of forms and modes, which encompass and borrow from a variety of other art forms, including performance, music and poetry. Unconventional, even popularising, practices of alternative cinema were nurtured in the co-ops, the cineclubs, officine artistiche (art labs) and film studio (film and exhibition centres). Some of which are discussed extensively in this volume. Within such centres the excitement, the debates and the ‘labour of love’ that went into producing the films were fostered, as well as promotion, distribution and exhibition initiatives and programmes. Scholars keen to explore the international film scene, also became the major researchers of Italian experimental and independent film practices. They emerge from the Italian collective phenomena of the late 1960s and beginning of 1970s; a new wave of art, performance and innovation, forms of unconventional and alternative film practices and works. A number of film scholars and exegetes, including Paolo Bertetto, Adriano Aprà, Antonio Costa, Vito Zagarrio, Flavio De Bernardinis, Bruno Di Marino, Enzo Ungari, Marco Meneguzzo, Vittorio Fagone, Patrick Rumble, Sandra Lischi, Marco Senaldi and Andrea La Porta, have offered their analyses of this unconventional and alternative, experimental and independent cinema. The artists and auteurs, who have received critical attention, include Luigi Veronesi, Bruno Munari, Paolo Gioli, Piero Bargellini, Gianfranco Baruchello, Anna Lajolo, Alfredo Leonardi, Guido Lombardi, Massimo Bacigalupo, Tornino De Bernardi, Pia Epremian De Silvestris, Pino Pascali, Franco Angeli, Ugo Nespolo, Mario Schifano, Ugo La Pietra, among several others. For study purposes two categories that have proven useful are those of narrative and abstract/ lyrical forms of cinema.\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 8\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n9\n\nIn certain respects, forms of alternative cinema, that is, unconventional approaches to the functionality and consumption of the aesthetics peculiar to the new medium, along with different usages of moving-images’ representative or anti-representative potentials, have been invested regularly within all phases of film-work, from inception to exhibition during the last century and into the new. Independence, whether economic or formalistic, is not necessarily regarded an artistic ‘identity card’ but rather a modus operandi, a style, a philosophical and political statement made against complacency and, especially, intended to reaffirm a sense of artistic/cultural liberation. The underlying philosophy of much low budget, unconventional and experimental and independent cinema may be understood through examining the techniques as well as the language and style adopted. On the 2005 occasion of the ‘Giornate del cinema privato’ (Days of Private Cinema), in Siena, Aprà spoke of low-budget narrative cinema in relation to the outcome of the technological transformations and seminal events of the latter part of the twentieth century, yet the notion equally applies to forms of experimentation. Whether it has to do with the high-cost movie [or the] low cost one, we are not confronted with different problems. . . .The cinema [has changed] with the mutation of recording equipment . . . The artist, though, is not conditioned by these things. [It’s not that] the low-cost or high-cost production are [one less beautiful than the other] there are some ugly experimental films as there are some ugly narrative films. . . .Narrative cinema is in the third-person, but this represents a limit . . . whereas the narrative film in first-person has expanded the possibilities of ‘storytelling’, it opened broad fields so-to-speak. From the 1980s onwards this thing has spread rapidly. . . .The ‘I’ is more subconscious of the ‘they’ mode of speech.13\n\nWhat transpires from such an understanding is a vision of the art of moving image as a vehicle of aesthetic, intellectual and socio-cultural, inquiry and pursuits. From the point of view of craftsmanship, of the nature of communicative iconic clues, the intent is more important than the wealth at the means at one’s disposal. According to scholarly positions, such as quoted above, the change in perspective is not necessarily given by the independently produced work, the low-budget film, but rather afforded by a perceptual and cognitive ‘metamorphosis’. It is a change of address, a change within linguistic paradigms. It amounts to a self-reflexive shift: from outward to inward, from the collective to the personal, from the public to the private and thus from the voice conveyed as ‘objective’ by the use of the third-person-plural, to that of the affirmative and ‘subjective’ mode of the first-person-singular regime. Although in anthropological and aesthetic terms the scholar must shift gears, the\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 9\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\n10\n\nANTHONY CRISTIANO AND CARLO COEN\n\nnature of independent and experimental cinema has continued to convey similar claims. What Aprà and others have observed is a levelling out of the field of artistic goals and endeavours and, in the case in point, one taking place within the transforming field of visual arts. In regard to the euphoric climate of the Sixties, the socio-cultural transformations of that period, along with the gradual adoption of new technologies, have not merely informed, but also ‘unlocked’, the individual artists’ vision and simultaneously given the instruments to operate with increased degrees of freedom. While there is no denying that the visits of American independent filmmakers and the screenings of their films have spawned analogous works and co-op centres in Italy, categorising the Italian independent and experimental phenomena of the late 1960s onwards as mere emulations omits and misrepresents the autochthonous nature and peculiar aesthetic of the Italian tradition. As discussed herein, such an analysis fails to differentiate from foreign ethnographies the socio-cultural traits which are typical of, and indigenous and endogenous to, the Italian peninsula. It overlooks the peculiar quality of a renowned aesthetic tradition, its painterly, performative, aesthetic, lyrical and even folkloristic character. When looking at the available independent work produced during the different periods, the conspicuous influence of such a tradition – on its intellectuals, poets, architects, painters, visual artists and now new auteurs of alternative cinema – is discerned. The indigenous, and unexplored, microcosmic histories, of a vast array of Italian independent and experimental work, is gradually emerging. The legacy of cinema forms, even the most shortlived, is being watched, researched and is gradually becoming the object of systematic study on different fronts and within diverse academic disciplines. Indeed, the fact that some periods and related activities have not received critical attention does not erase the traces of its history.14 Established and specialised festivals have devoted entire programmes to the screening of these films as well as retrospectives to the body of work of individual artists and filmmakers. Beginning in the late 1960s, several and frequent screenings of experimental films – works from both local and foreign artists – have been programmed at the well-known Filmstudio art centre in Rome (founded in 1967 by Americo Sbardella and Annabella Miscuglio), and some were then re-screened at the Montesacro Alto Cineclub in the mid 1970s. In 1980 the Roman Filmstudio ran a long season of screenings devoted to the Italian underground cinema that lasted fifteen days, from the 15 to the 28 of August, at the Massenzio Rassegna Cinematografica (Massenzio Film Festival) in Rome. During the same decade, other centres and festivals saw the programming of similar initiatives, such as the\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 10\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n11\n\nMilanese Filmmaker group and, under the artistic direction of Aprà, the Salsomaggiore Film Festival, in the province of Parma. In 2003 Filmstudio organised an even greater event with the programming of 144 independent Italian films, dating from 1964 to 1984, and screening at the historic Roman location, on via degli Orti d’Alibert, from 17 November to 1 December. The same Filmstudio hosted the exhibition of (politically inspiring) foreign works, such as films by Robert Kramer, Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet – though the latter two made several of their films in Italy. More recently the Lucca Film Festival Europacinema, in Tuscany, offered a screening of independent films in its programme. The city of Pesaro has also set up programmes devoted to the Italian experimental and independent film scene for decades, since the mid to late twentieth century and into the first and second decades of the twenty-first century. Several short and longer films, mentioned in this volume, can be accessed and viewed online on the webpages of Italian and European galleries, museums, and film archives, and moreover with the rise of the ‘collaborative’ culture of the Internet, on video-sharing platforms such as YouTube and Vimeo. The online prestigious sites hosting Italian works include the Museo Nazionale del Cinema, in Turin, the Austrian Film Museum, in Vienna, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMa), in New York, the Centre Pompidou, in Paris, the Deutsche Kinemathek, in Berlin, and others. Some of these host a selection of works on their eponymous YouTube and Vimeo channels. It is worth noting that Internet technologies may have played, and still play, an important role – in an era of bygone cineclub and cinema d’essai traditional circles – in increasing the exposure to and appreciation for experimental and independent cinema, in both the viewing public and the budding scholarly interest. Special, or late-hours, TV programmes have also showcased rare works or behind-the-scenes documentaries of some Italian independent and experimental filmmakers, including works by Alfredo Leonardi, Anna Lajolo, Guido Lombardi and Fortunato Frascà, among others. At its peak, and for a brief period, Italian experimental and underground cinema had its own literary magazine with the evocative title Ombre elettriche, which was founded and directed by Mario Ferrero in Turin.15\n\nThe Different Protagonists and Forms If we were to identify two major trends of alternative Italian film artists and practices, two useful groupings could be: the painter/sculpture/architect/ storyteller turned screen artist and the intellectually and socially impegnato (socially engaged) filmmaker who makes film di denuncia (exposé films).\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 11\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\n12\n\nANTHONY CRISTIANO AND CARLO COEN\n\nWithin the ranks of a shared battle against sterile forms of mainstream cinema, and the dominant forms of consumeristic mass-media, Italian independent filmmakers, similarly to their European and International counterparts – from Jean Cocteau and Hans Richter, to Peter Kubelka, Stan Brakhage, Michael Snow, Stephen Dwoskin, William Raban, Jonas Mekas, James Broughton, Gregory Markopoulos, Kenneth Anger, and Curtis Harrington, among several others – are likewise characterised by a wide variety of concerns, techniques, individual approaches and personal visions of ‘art’. Some have channelled their oneiric and visionary sensibilities into an anti-narrative and pictorial tableau of images – at times even obsessively so. One of the early Italian pioneers who ‘imprinted’ movement into painterly work is the Italian visual artist Luigi Veronesi, who kept working till the late 1980s, and experimented with time and rhythm in his varied cinematic productions, such as in his 1941 work Fantasia. He mixed a very rigorous visual approach with an artisanal ‘painterly film’ practice. Artist Ugo Nespolo is a relatively more recent example of painterly approach and plurality of forms, with works such as Le gote in fiamme (Cheeks on Fire, 1967), Le porte girevoli (Revolving Doors, 1982) and Film/a/TO (2001). Roberto Capanna and Giorgio Turi made use of preexisting material and added to it footage they filmed through documentary techniques. They looked at the decadere delle cose (the natural degeneration and decadence of things), the passage from childhood to adulthood and old age and the entropic nature of the material world, such as in the case of Vo-yage (1964). They also made political films, works of impegno sociale (social engagement) such as Non-permetterò (I Will Not Permit It, 1967): a depiction of tanks, and sounds, harmonised, or in a dialectical exchange with images such as flowers, instead of tensions and conflicts. The retrieval of archival footage, along with collage, montage, juxtaposition and other techniques, became very popular among artists and documentarians in multiple cinematic traditions the world over. In Italy, the couple Yervant Gianikian and Angela Ricci Lucchi, dig up little known, or wholly forgotten, archival footage and create contemporary ‘narrative forms’ with important historical echoes and relevance. They move their anthropological perspective to the spectator’s gaze, one that involves a minute analysis of the texture of film along with ‘re-constructed’ documentation of histories therein portrayed, including denarrativised records of oppression and enslavement. Their films have been screened at several international festivals and museums including MoMA, Centre Pompidou and Pirelli Hunger Bicocca, and include Dal Polo all’Equatore (From the North Pole to the Equator, 1986), Prisoners of War (1995), Oh! Uomo (Oh! Man, 2005) and Pays barbare (Barbarous Lands, 2013).\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 12\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n13\n\nThe phenomenon of the film co-op-centres served various purposes, chief among which is the function of offering access to alternative means of production and distribution. The Cooperativa del Cinema Indipendente (CCI) founded originally in Naples in 1967 – the same year of the retrospective of the New American Cinema at the Mostra di Pesaro – and later transferred to the capital city, is only one of several artist-run centres in Italy, which opened the doors to new creative expressions – though members’ talents, approaches and philosophies varied. Neapolitan brothers Adamo, Antonio and Aldo Vergine are the original founders, to whom were later added the Roman founders, such as Gianfranco Baruchello, Alfredo Leonardi, Guido Lombardi and Massimo Bacigalupo, among others. Engravers and painters such as Luca Maria Patella, Ugo Nespolo, Silvio Loffredo, Franco Angeli and Mario Schifano, enamoured by the kinetic nature of the medium of film, were persuaded by the possibilities of independently creating films of their own, transitioning their talents to the art of moving images. The works produced display the chiefly nonstructuralist concerns of their visions, such as Bacigalupo’s 60 metri per il 31 marzo (200 Feet for March 31st, 1968), Schifano’s Souvenir (1967) and Leonardi’s Se l’inconscio si ribella (If the Subconscious Were to Rebel, 1967), among numerous others. Bacigalupo met up with friends that reject traditional film modes and language, to explore new lyrical paths, without the constraining requirement to convey ‘a message’. They broke with such criteria and made lyrical films, which were meant to render or re-render the ‘figurative idea’ via the cinema, without human intervention or by reducing the intervening process to the minimum. It recalls the stance in opposition to films that required postproduction stages – such as elaborate editing – and in favour of self-making processes, the realisation of things that develop on their own: happenings (within and without the camera). In spite of the general disdain for structuralism, however, there are several exceptions to the rule. Films which are structuralist in tone or have an overall structuralist appeal include: Patella’s SKMP2 (1968), Angeli’s Schermi (Screens, 1968) and even Baruchello and Alberto Grifi’s antiestablishment and provocative piece La verifica incerta (Disperse Exclamatory Phase, 1964) made with the loose ends of several American feature films, which was meant to attack and deconstruct – if not outright ridicule – the ‘language’ and ‘structure’ of the Hollywood brand of dominant narrative cinema. Gianfranco Baruchello also created his Tutto, tutto nello stesso istante (All, All at Once, 1968) at the Roman cooperative – a painter with a penchant for assemblage and superimposition, among other techniques. Umberto Bignardi and Alfredo Leonardi are the makers of Motion Vision (1966–7), which is also considered structuralist in nature and style.\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 13\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\n14\n\nANTHONY CRISTIANO AND CARLO COEN\n\nBignardi is an artist who claims to have had a vision beyond the Pop Art movement, and to have been an imitator of Eadweard Muybridge insofar as he made films of verifica (verification), which were meant as investigations of spatio-temporal dimensions. Often the artist carried over the system, or systematised approach, from one medium to the next. Patella transferred the techniques and ‘proclivities’ peculiar to his profession to his film work, its genre, instruments and modes, through an innovative first-person approach. The ‘science’ of the new tools’ mixes with the representational potential of new media to yield a picture of the subconscious nature of the world, that is, in sub-materialistic forms. Several other self-run centres, officine and/or laboratori, have been created in other parts of the country. The Studio di Monte Olimpino (Mount Olimpino Studio Lab), in the province of Como, is a research and production laboratory, founded by the animation artists Bruno Munari and Marcello Piccardo in 1962. The activities lasted over ten years and the artists made films commissioned by various industries and, later on, animation projects aired on RAI, Italian national television. In the latter part of its existence the centre took on a pedagogical role with the initiative ‘Il cinema fatto dai bambini’ (‘Cinema Fashioned by Children’). Their extraordinary talents brought a mastery of techniques and artistic-artisanal style to their work. Zavattini’s vision was credited for their youth-project initiative made for television. Munari and Piccardo were also among the curators of Andy Warhol’s film work at the Museo d’arte moderna di Torino (Turin’s Museum of Modern Art). In his memoir La collina del cinema (The Cinema Hilltop), released by Nodo Libri in 1992, Piccardo recalls how research projects mixed with those meant, and made, for commercial purposes. I colori della luce (The Colours of Light, 1963), and Tempo nel tempo (Time within Time, 1964) and Fiat ricerca No 1 (Fiat Research Project No. 1, 1964), are early examples of industrial and research films – following the precursor Ermanno Olmi.16 Experimental animation films were also created by artists who did not belong to any particular group or coop. Guido Lombardi is the co-founder, with Alfredo Leonardi, of the 1971 Videobase co-op.; Lombardi’s early work is concerned with experimentation and conceptual films. In later years, in collaboration with Anna Lajolo they began a series titled ‘L’alfabeto’ (‘The Alphabet’): a somewhat utopian project the aim of which was to re-think not only the cinema but the world entire. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, in addition to the Super8, videotape formats of 1-inch and 1/2-inch became available. Lombardi and others from the Videobase were attracted to the bursting and bristling social issues of their time. They began to film nelle fabbriche (in the factories) where the contestazione ribolliva (forms of protest erupted) and engaged with a militant or political activist ambience, whose performances and events they\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 14\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n15\n\nfilmed. Lombardi speaks of realtà cruda entrava nello schermo (crude reality entering the screen) – as commented upon in Bruno Di Marino and Claudio Del Signore’s documentary Lo sguardo espanso: cinema d’artista italiano (The Expanded Gaze: Italian Art Cinema, 2000–2013)17 – but acknowledges the difficulty of editing the enormous amount of footage the videotape equipment made it possible to accumulate. The revealing legacy of documentary titles of the time, produced in collaboration with a number of other independent filmmakers, include among several others: La casa è un diritto non un privilegio (Housing Is a Right and Not a Privilege, 1970, co-authored with Alfredo Leonardi e Paola Scarnati), E nua ca simu a forza du mundu (And We Who Are the Strength of the World, 1971, co-authored with Alfredo Leonardi), Il fitto dei padroni non lo paghiamo più (We Will No Longer Pay the Masters’ Rent, 1972), Sotto le stelle, sotto il tendone (Under the Stars, Under the Tent, 1972, co-authored with Alfredo Leonardi), Quartieri popolari di Roma (Community Housing Quarters in Rome, 1973), Policlinico in lotta (Policlinico Hospital’s Struggle, 1973), Lotta di classe alla Fiat (Class Struggle at Fiat, 1974). In Florence the long-running Scuola di Firenze centre (Lab of the Florence School) gathers a number of artists/cineastes, some of whom continued working at the centre throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The Florentine artists include Andrea Granchi and Arcangelo Mazzoleni, some of whose works received foreign recognition. Granchi’s La mano nell’occhio (A Hand in the Eye, 1978), and Mazzoleni’s Aurélia (1980), were screened at art centres and museums. Several other groups and co-ops remain to be investigated. This anthology includes an extended discussion of the Milanese Filmmaker co-op. The Milanese co-ops Filmmaker and Studio Azzurro came about in 1980 and in 1982 respectively, and were likewise fashioned with an alternative productive and distributive model that became the formative vehicle for a number of future directors, including Silvio Soldini and the younger Michelangelo Frammartino. The breaking point for the historical cooperatives may be due to the tug between aesthetical and ethical concerns: while authentic artists/auteurs wanted to devote themselves to forms of ‘pure art-cinema’, other members turned to political films, the so-called film of impegno. It must be noted that several artists and filmmakers kept coalescing the two fronts, so-to-speak, to acquiesce the differing political and private nature of their inspiration and work – the odd mixture of forms, style and concerns, found in Alberto Grifi and Paolo Brunatto, among others, being exemplary cases. In the aftermath of the 1968 uprisings – the demands for social change, the optimistic expectations and the turbulent years that followed – many began to make politically oriented films. For the same very reason, others began to feel disenfranchised and they turned to a freer and ‘purer’ form\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 15\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\n16\n\nANTHONY CRISTIANO AND CARLO COEN\n\nof cinema, free from any type of agenda, including experimental agendas, and the agendas of the official independent co-ops. Some of them were mere utopian films, films about doing and creating intuitively and/ or lyrically, with a preference towards aesthetic enjoyment. The fact that the cooperatives’ filmmakers were required to accompany their films, and give indicazioni di lettura (interpretative suggestions), in order to attract cineclubs or other festival venues’ audiences to the screenings, contributed to the sense of alienation felt by some of them: poems are not ‘explained’ to one’s readership, so why should the more immediate works of moving-images require explanation to one’s viewership? The screening programmes of such experimental and independent cinema was seen by very few spectators. They were notoriously not a mainstream event, but the ‘erudite’ experience of cineclubs and co-op gatherings: the coming together of different minds and views, agreeably or as part of an intellectual confrontation. The public exhibition programmes of such works remained underground in nature, till most of their original activity disappeared altogether. In the present day it has re-emerged ‘immigrated’ online, thanks to the digital revolution, through screenings and other exhibition events in Italy and elsewhere continue thanks to the indefatigable work of artists such as Bacigalupo and scholars such as Di Marino, among others. In many respects, the Sixties and the Seventies set the tone for years to come. It was indeed an ebullient period, with art-house and experimental and independent forms of cinema that were interdisciplinary in nature. Like other trends and movements of the time, however, the same countercultural context and technological innovations, which contributed to the creation of the centres and co-ops, led to the obsolescence and demise of the original forms. One important characteristic of the independent and experimental Italian film scene is the very interdisciplinary nature of its approach, enriched by talent, which funnelled into practices of moving image making. The number of Italian artists turned to moving images to explore new territory and experiment with alternative visual ‘languages’ and novel forms is testimony to the versatility of the various talent involved as much as the degree of pliability or plasticity found in the new medium. As it has been pointed out since its origins, artists who turned to filmmaking sought new ways of relating to the world and, thus, they often made the new ‘language’ of the cinema the focus of their inquiry.18 It is hardly a coincidence that the Italian artists – particularly painters – turned filmmakers, are chiefly the ones who continue the independent practice into filmmaking even after the crisis, and demise, of the co-op centres. For them it also amounted to a departure from the confined, if not stifling, space of the gallery and studio/lab. The artist Cioni\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 16\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n17\n\nCarpi worked in Canada and later in Italy, making films that coupled the investigation of the visual realm with that of one’s inner cognitive processes; examples include Un giorno un aereo (A Day an Airplane, 1963), 55cm above Sea Level (1972), Egg One Egg Zero (1974), and Nero più bianco fa legge (Black Plus White Equals Law, 1977). However, not all Italian artists who took up the practices of cinema joined a co-op. The aforementioned, painter Mario Schifano, did not relate to the independent co-ops initiatives. His turn to filmmaking was that of a painter’s soulful approach. He broadened his perspective, travelled to America, befriended the director Marco Ferreri and sought to inject a broader socially oriented vision into his film work, referencing the relevant issues of the time. The 1967 films Vietnam, Made in USA, and Voce della foresta di plastica (The Plastic Forest’s Voice), along with Umano, non umano (Human, Non-Human, 1969), constitute examples of such thematic and aesthetic concerns. Fortunato Frascà, a painter who worked as a professional scenographer with major Italian directors, including Luchino Visconti and Michelangelo Antonioni, was the co-founder with other Roman artists of the ‘Gruppo Uno’ (‘Group One’) in 1962. He turned to experimental and independent cinema to demystify canonical standards of filmmaking and overcome taboos which are typical within the industry. He was guided by a rational interest in the analisi geometrica delle forme (geometric analysis of forms), and made films that include forbidden items and practices, such as smoking cigarettes, and exposing production and narrative procedures that in regular productions are edited out as errors. His Informazione Leitmotiv: L’informazione è ciò che conta (Information Leitmotif: Information Is What Matters, 1968–9) with its cacophony of sounds and juxtaposition of signs is an early example of visual and auditory media saturation. Mario Masini – who later became the cinematographer of independent maverick Carmelo Bene – and Paolo Brunatto left the cooperative and made independent films of their own in 8mm or Super8, such as Vieni, dolce morte (Come Sweet Death, 1968). Other independent auteurs, such as Romano Scavolini, appear to have had no interest in the experimental vanguardist agenda or filmmaking. They were instead oriented towards a form of ‘absolute cinema’. In Di Marino’s documentary, Scavolini speaks of the fluire spontaneo delle cose (the spontaneous flow of things), which could not be interrupted, as if a sacred event had taken place. An example of such a perspective and approach is his 1970s experimental documentary l.s.d.. Other works, which attracted much attention from Italian censors, are La prova generale (The Dress Rehearsal, 1968), and A mosca cieca (Blindman’s Bluff, 1966). Scavolini’s further claim is that the cinema of the time was an addomesticamento della coscienza (taming of one’s conscience), and in his view cinema had to head in the opposite direction, and ‘wake up’ and surprise the spectator. In his view, being unable to\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 17\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\n18\n\nANTHONY CRISTIANO AND CARLO COEN\n\nrelate to what one was looking at on the screen amounted to a victory over the complacent attitude of standard, mainstream and commercial, cinema. Several Italian independent filmmakers are artists who seek simplicity of transposition, purity of expression and spontaneity of presentation. Tonino De Bernardi is among the Italian independent filmmakers who finds inspiration in the self-made and self-determining approach of the American model. De Bernardi readily acknowledges his indebtedness to American independent cinema. He met his American counterparts in Italy, such as Jonas Mekas – and shared the vision that an artist need not rely on the industry. In De Bernardi’s case, ‘independent vision’ meant a position countering the notorious industry formula originating from the capital city of Rome. The access to hand-held cameras, and the urge to tell stories from a personal point-of-view, led him to an idiosyncratic use of a sort of ‘caméra-stylo’ approach. Armed with a movie camera, he made atypical films, including ‘family films’, with friends, family members and actors willing to volunteer their talents. His notion of what is meant by independent cinema is very different from directors who sought public or private sponsorship and funds – some of whom made films during the late twentieth century when funding was secured through national and private TV networks and governmental aid and sponsorship programmes. De Bernardi openly admits of never having had a producer or production company sponsoring and funding him – though he was open to a possibility of such sort. He never concerned himself with distribution; but is proud of his friendship with Enrico Ghezzi, the producer of RAI’s ‘Fuori Orario’ programme – a late hours show the National Broadcaster devoted to non-mainstream films and cinema d’essai. Lischi speaks of De Bernardi’s work as simultaneously lyrical, classical and primitive.19 De Bernardi is a low-key, often times overly long, but unassuming, and gentle auteur of ‘marginal’ cinema, whose suggestion to not let the lack of sponsorship hinder one’s personal vision and career, is a statement to the free-spirit and subjectivity informing indigenous and undertone forms of independent Italian filmmaking. His films include Vaso Etrusco (Etruscan Vase, 1967), Piccoli orrori (Little Horrors, 1994) and the more recent Accoltellati (Stabbed, 2006). In other rare cases, forms of experimentation and independence within the Italian panorama led to documentary works elicited by a guttural response to the climate of the times. Massimo Sarchielli and Alberto Grifi are the creators of the film Anna (1972–5), a real and tragic story about a young and homeless single mother, Anna, and filmed in part on videotape and later transferred on 16mm film for exhibition. It was shown at the 1975 Venice International Film Festival, the Mostra Internazionale d’Arte Cinematografica, and thereafter at top film festivals internationally. This particular work appealed to the dire, disturbing and\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 18\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n19\n\nsensational climate of the times, a time of general unrest, public demonstrations, political resistance, militancy, and labour strikes. The documentary by Di Marino and Del Signore offers the following comment: ‘it is a victory from a formal and technical standpoint . . . but it is a defeat from the purely social viewpoint; Anna, the authentic protagonist at the centre of the film, dies a year later, in a psychiatric hospital, forgotten by all’.20 The second half of the twentieth century seemed to have brought a heightened sense of awareness to the Italian art scene. Far from merely emulating their western peers, Italian filmmakers added a personal artistic vision and uniquely Italian imprint to their practices of visual arts. Champions of ‘made in Italy’ film and art, such as Paolo Gioli, Marinella Pirelli, Annabella Miscuglio, Piero Bargellini, Massimo Bacigalupo, Alfredo Leonardi, among others, pursue their vision apparently unhindered by any type of constraint – be it aesthetic, technical, or financial, in nature – and rather see in their peculiar contexts and conditions ‘a call’ to the exploration of new territories and fresher approaches. It must be noted that several artists began their journeys into practices of filmmaking before being exposed to the tour of American independent cinema; including Leonardi, Bagicalupo and others, some of the work of whom is discussed further in this anthology. A discussion of Pirelli’s contribution to the experimental cinema scene is also included in the present volume. Included are also extraordinary examples of ‘urban art’ films, such as works by architect and experimental filmmaker Ugo La Pietra. Examples of his inner- and outer-city films, with commentary on the sociopolitical significance of the geographical (if not ideological) excursion include La riappropriazione della città (The Re-Appropriation of the City, 1977), Recupero e reinvenzione (Restoration and Reinvention, 1976), Interventi pubblici per la città di Milano (Public Works for the City of Milan, 1979), and La casa telematica (The Telematic House, 1981). His manifesto films are well calibrated and enlightening. They speak to issues of habitat and home, the need to create a space conducive to psychological and physical well-being. Sensitive matters of environmental adaptability and sustainability are tackled with professionalism, and moreover with a clever dose of irony. Of a different timbre, there are also meta-cinematic experimentalists, who question the processes in a minimalist fashion. Paolo Gioli is among the first of the vanguard artists and filmmakers to explore the camera’s field-of-vision ‘beyond the visible’, so-to-speak. He is a man of multiple talents, a painter, a photographer, a filmmaker and a spontaneous inventor. One of his strategies is the use of self-made pinhole cameras, which may consist of boxes and tubes, used as camera chambers, in which the light is let in via pinholes in objects such as shirt\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 19\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\n20\n\nANTHONY CRISTIANO AND CARLO COEN\n\nbuttons, pieces of metal, and other ordinary materials. Recently, David Bordwell wrote the following about him: When he needs a shutter, his fingers, or perhaps some leaves from trees, will suffice. He has embedded images within images without benefit of optical printers, and he has brought photos to frenetic life without animation stands. . . . Impresario of clamps and masking tape, he creates extraordinary films with equipment that looks distinctly knocked-together.21\n\nExamples of Gioli’s ingenious work include the ‘cubic vision’ of Secondo il mio occhio di vetro (According to My Glass Eye, 1971), the superimposed man to machine and viceversa in Traumatografo (Thaumatrope, 1973), and the more recent ‘study’ of vision and the physicality of the medium of film in Quando l’occhio trema (When the Eye Flutters, 1991). Gioli is indeed a unique case in the Italian panorama of independent film artists/creators/inventors, who brings a personal use of body-art and technique to his vision of experimental filmmaking and craftsmanship. A long time scholar of his work, Patrick Rumble, speaks of Gioli’s cinema, as taking the viewer back to a time preceding ‘the creation myth of protocinema’.22 Gioli’s approach, shared with friends such as Leonardi and Bargellini from the CCI, advocates a return to the origins, a reinvention of the cinematic experience altogether. The creative and ideological vision of such filmmakers was such that they opted for total independence. Their independence centred on their artistic approach and creativity. They exercised total control over every stage of production: the filming, development, editing, and release of the final prints of their work. Their artistic personalities emerge in their individual approaches and work, Gioli in his rather ‘cold’ approach and Bargellini in his ‘warmer’, domestic participations. The singularity of such experiences is evinced from their penchant for what could be thought of as a reverse chronohistory of vision. Like other independent Italian filmmakers, they are interested in the painterly and indigenous nature of their surroundings but with an eye to the past, to the history of ‘sight and shadows’. In the 2013 documentary Lo sguardo espanso: cinema d’artista italiano, Aprà maintains that during the 1930s no Italian experimental film movement existed, and that neither did such a tradition exist during the silent period. For this scholar, the experimental and underground phenomena of the mid to late twentieth century represents a ‘break’ within the (preceding) ‘break’ with traditional mainstream canons – including notions of historical avant-gardes, realism, neorealism, nouvelle vague, cinéma vérité and so-forth. Aprà’s position on Italian experimental and independent cinema is that: ‘it was not emulating its\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 20\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n21\n\nAmerican counterpart, but rather it exhibited originality without complexes, that is, it was not merely relaying somebody else’s cinematic experience, it represented a spontaneous impulse, one that saw the world as if for the very first time’.23 If the aesthetics of painting and that of film converged in the practices of several of the Italian independent and experimental artists mentioned above, the unique character of the Italian aesthetic tradition is also carried over in filmmakers who sought to attract a wider and mainstream audience while defending the peculiar ‘freedom of expression’ that characterises independent practice. Silvano Agosti and Franco Piavoli, are examples of filmmakers who conceive of independent cinema as a solitary endeavour, a single man’s work, and yet the lyrical nature of their vision, coupled with the documentary content of their films, has nonetheless proven to make their work suited to broader audiences. Agosti’s exemplary career as an independent Italian filmmaker stands out for its avowed total autonomy, impegno (social engagement), creativity, lyricism and overall anti-establishment narrative approach. He is the author of several narrative and documentary works that bear his signature lyrical style. They include Il giardino delle delizie (Garden of Delights, 1967), Altri seguiranno (More Will Follow, 1973), D’amore si vive (Living on Love, 1984) and L’uomo proiettile (The Rocket Man, 1995), among others. Though he laments a lack of appreciation in his native country of Italy, he has scored successes in several foreign lands, including Japan. From the point of view of cineastes such as Agosti and Piavoli, independent cinema does not, by definition, necessarily involve either the employment of a crew or other artists. The mainstream-industry model is not only frowned upon, it is pointed at as the source of much ‘sterility’. Agosti maintains that ‘the cinema which depends on the industry, has remained stagnant for seventy-eight years; it has nothing new to say . . . Independent cinema amounts to being free, not to depend on anyone, and on anything’.24 Piavoli is, likewise, the author of much admired ‘naturalist’ documentaries and narrative features such as Il pianeta azzurro (The Blue Planet, 1982), Voci nel tempo (Voices in Time, 1996) and Al primo soffio di vento (At the First Breath of Wind, 2002). Such achievements belie the claim that independent filmmaking is merely restricted to niche audiences, and confirm the positions held by such cineastes: the insistence that independent filmmakers, though challenged by limited resources, reclaim ‘unadulterated’ forms of cinematic art with enlivened work, which has been denied to genuine spectators of cinema. Experimentation and independence are not the phenomena of a single period or the prerogative of abstract or radical practices. Cineastes who aspired to break into the mainstream channels and thereby reach a broader audience while holding on to their independent approach\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 21\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\n22\n\nANTHONY CRISTIANO AND CARLO COEN\n\nand creative freedom, include Davide Ferrario, Giorgio Diritti, Vincenzo Marra, Gianfranco Rosi, Pietro Marcello and Giuseppe Gaudino, among many others discussed in several chapters herein. They have had greater success in having their films picked-up by standard distribution channels, and they have been viewed more widely. Theirs is a ‘type’ of cinema which is markedly of the narrative genre, but not in the modes and practices typical of mainstream productions. These filmmakers speak of independence in terms which are different from their experimental and one-man-crew Italian counterparts. They recognise the difference between the Hollywood machinery, and overall regimented modes of production peculiar to the United States, versus the irregular and anomalous production mechanisms in European countries. Whether or not Italy has an ‘official film industry’, its production system does constitute a network of entities, and a peculiar Italian production style, which for decades centred its artistic and ideological locus of operations on the geographical and political capital of Rome. Italian production firms have increasingly relied on public funding. Such institutionalised mechanisms and state of affairs has increasingly informed production initiatives elsewhere in the country, ideologically and logistically distant from the capital. The initiatives relied on public funds, and on collaborations and sponsorship with State TV and other Television networks, including foreign ones. Ferrario’s independent work, if we are to apply the ‘label’ at all, falls into the category of filmmakers who began their careers thanks to such alternative production or procedural approach. The definition of independent films here refers to works by first time directors, so-called début films, which began to be conceived as original ideas, written and storyboarded independently, while seeking support for a possible production. While this category of independent filmmakers may appear to seek conventional legitimisation with some works of ‘standard fare’, it is not hard to detect a socio-political commitment rather than mere commercial glitter in their oeuvres. Ferrario is the maker of La fine della notte (The End of the Night, 1989), Lontano da Roma (Far from Rome, 1991), Tutti giù per terra (We All Fall Down, 1997), Dopo mezzanotte (After Midnight, 2004), set in Turin’s ‘Museo del Cinema’, Piazza Garibaldi (2011) and the documentary La strada di Levi (Primo Levi’s Journey, 2006) – among othe works – where Ferrario retraces the journey home of the writer after his liberation from Auschwitz. Diritti likewise directed works in which are mirrored peculiar socio-cultural milieux; his work includes Il vento fa il suo giro (The Wind Blows Round, 2005), and L’uomo che verrà (The Man Who Will Come, 2009) and the more recent Volevo nascondermi (I Wanted to Hide, 2020) a biopic of the\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 22\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n23\n\nnaïf painter Antonio Ligabue. Marra directed Vento di Terra (Earthbound Wind, 2004), Il grande progetto (The Big Project, 2008), Il gemello (The Twin, 2012) and the award-winning documentary L’amministratore (The Administrator, 2013). Gaudino graduated from the Accademia di Belle Arti (Academy of Fine Arts) in Naples, a hotbed of talents, and his films include Giro di lune tra terra e mare (Moons Spins between Land and Sea, 1997), and the more recent Per amor Vostro (For Your Love, 2015). Pietro Marcello shares the same background as Gaudino (though he is younger). Marcello’s films have been presented at several Film Festivals; the documentary La bocca del lupo (The Mouth of the Wolf, 2009) revealed his original approach to filmmaking, and Bella e perduta (Lost and Beautiful, 2015) gained several awards and nominations. His latest work, Martin Eden (2019), an original adaptation of Jack London’s novel, has gained highly complimentary reviews both in Europe and North America. Gianfranco Rosi is the director of three multi awarded documentaries, Below Sea Level (2008), set in California, Sacro GRA (2013), exploring the daily routine of ordinary people in Rome’s outskirts, and the much acclaimed and Oscar nominated Fuocoammare (Fire at Sea, 2013), capturing life on the small island of Lampedusa, at the frontline of the European immigrant crisis. Several independent filmmakers mirror in starker terms the psychological and political climate of Italy at the turn of the century – for which they have received the notable acclaim that launched their careers. Unlike the experimental filmmakers considered earlier, this ‘variety’ of independent cineastes/auteurs does not find dominant appeal in the painterly, abstract – or in rare cases ‘pretentiously’ structuralist – films of their ‘purely’ artistic compatriots. These are storytellers, chroniclers of topical subject matter, who see in the history of the country and its socio-political milieu a number of untold tales and larger stories in need of a narrative voice.\n\nSummary of Key Points Rather than being limited to the late 1960s and early 1970s, practices of independence and experimentation are detectable at different times and in different contexts, according to the varied definitions attributed to given filmmakers by critics and/or artists and cineastes themselves. What appears to be a common denominator, however, is the spontaneous need to detach oneself from routine practices and conventional approaches, and seek artistic and ideological freedom, political and economic contentment, in forms of independent filmmaking; an urge to exploit the potential of, and access to, new ideas and new means of production, to give voice to\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 23\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\n24\n\nANTHONY CRISTIANO AND CARLO COEN\n\none’s artistic and ethnographic identity and vocation. Independent practices are likewise a statement as to the ‘pliability’ of the medium of moving images, its swerving developments, its self-critique and study. Artistically and, thus, in aesthetic and philosophical terms, independent filmmaking may ultimately amount to: 1) interdisciplinary forms of artistic practice the multiplicity of which, in turn, translate praxis of individual (or collective) forms of cultural liberation, even if only metaphysical, 2) the unhindered exploration or investigation of one’s own identity, history, tools of communication and environmental surroundings, and 3) an alternative form of self-determination and human connection, even if in resistance or rebellion to dominant political, social, or artistic, regimes. From the legacies of the early pioneers and avant-garde movements to the transformations of the mid to late twentieth century, Italian cinema practices have reaffirmed their peculiar brand of aesthetic sensibilities and unique Italic identity. If in philosophical terms independent and experimental filmmaking amounts to an instantiation of political and cultural forms of autonomy, in the case of Italy it is further nurtured by its uniquely boisterous civilisation and superlative tradition of art, classic and modern. The collection of this volume attests to the same plurality of voices, talents and variety of approaches that define Italian independent and experimental cinema: its productive modes and practices along with the philosophical and ideological substratum that has nurtured and propelles it forward, with new impetus, to this day. It locates, and re-frames, an Italian brand of experimental and independent cinema at the intersection of European and international craftsmanship of innovative forms of art practices, and pivotal socio-cultural narrative trends.\n\nChapters in this Anthology In the chapter ‘Filmmaker and the Milanese independent cinema of the 1980s and 1990s’, Donatella Maraschin and Paola Nasini provide a detailed historical analysis of the Milanese co-ops centres, and in particular the activities of the 1980s and 1990s collectives Filmmaker and Studio Azzurro. They begin by looking at the history of the independent groups in juxtaposition to the centralised film industry originating in the capital city of Rome and, in opposition to it, outline the peculiar traits of the independent Milanese scene. These include the prominent features of its embeddedness in the urban fabric and the interdisciplinary nature and links which marked the impegno (social engagement) and cultural output of the group. One precious feature of this chapter is the recent interviews conducted by the authors, and which in retrospect offer a nuanced historical recollection of the collectives through the eyes of its principal protagonists, such\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 24\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n25\n\nas the Filmmaker’s founders Gianfilippo Pedote and Silvano Cavatorta. The chapter reviews the centres’ activities and experimentalism, and how they advanced the significance and social function of the arts of moving images. Notable outcomes include a catalogue of indigenous perspectives and works and the engendering of a variety of film talent, some of whom have gone on to pursue international careers, such as directors Davide Ferrario and Marco Tullio Giordana. Maraschin and Nasini’s chapter offers a ‘documentary’ window into the socio-political and cultural dynamics of the city’s art hubs, and how these affected independent film productions; how the local, provincial and indeed national climate bore, reflected, and refracted, the incandescent events of the preceding decades – the 1970s in particular. A further important feature of this chapter is the discussion of the self-mandated festival role of the independent film and video centres, a role that served to popularise the seminal and relevant nature of the groups with an increasingly wider audience. The interviews conducted by Maraschin and Nasini are an invaluable resource for understanding the unique periods and protagonists, and the import of the urban setting. This is a singular study that sets the template for any subsequent research. The films considered in the chapter include Giulia in ottobre (Giulia in October, Silvio Soldini, 1985), L’osservatorio nucleare del signor Nanof (The Nuclear Observatory of Mister Nanof, Paolo Rosa, 1985), Fame chimica (Chemical Hunger, Antonio Boccola, 2003) and La casa delle belle addormentate (The Home of the Sleeping Beauties, Michelangelo Frammartino, 1997), among others. Maraschin and Nasini draw some important conclusions from the history of the Milanese independent film centres, and ones that bear enlightening observations into the political, artistic and even metaphysical, dimensions and dynamics, of moving-images’ arts, and which continue to inform much contemporary international practices. In ‘Light and Liminal: Marinella Pirelli’s Cinema’, Matilde Nardelli offers an absorbing study of Pirelli’s cinema – which is overdue, particularly in the English language. While a number of Italian males working as independent filmmakers have been the subject of attention and critical study, the same can hardly be claimed for female protagonists in the moving-image arts. Nardelli’s study includes an investigation of the gender gap via the aesthetic and operative strategies deployed by Pirelli as mirrored projections and liminal ‘positions’, to the filmmaker’s advantage. Pirelli’s career spans the pivotal years of the ‘official’ experimental and independent phenomenon of the 1960s and 1970s. It gave birth to a body of work, and it bestowed a legacy, which await the study and recognition they deserve. The three-dimensionality and ideological implications of Pirelli’s experimentalism are both engrossing and ground-breaking.\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 25\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\n26\n\nANTHONY CRISTIANO AND CARLO COEN\n\nThe installations summon the ‘spectator’ into the process and onto the screened image, confronting its enduring perception and significance. The panorama of Italian experimental practices, owes part of its important artistic advancements to such daring visions. Pirelli’s inventive, artisanal and diaristic approaches to experimentation belong to the seminal and paradigmatic strand of ground-breaking artistic practices. Her sculptural installations become precursors of ‘participatory’ forms of moving images: the ‘sculpting’ of time through space, onto light rays and patterns, which summon a haptic experience with the ‘screen’. Nardelli probes the aesthetic and technical facets of Pirelli’s legacy with painstaking accuracy and offers an illuminating examination of the performative dimensions of her cinema, in relation to the physical environment and metaphysical space for which the mythic surface of the screen stands. Greater attention is devoted to the key work of Film Ambiente (Environmental Screen, 1968), its critical reception and overall socio-cultural significance; other works include Luce e movimento (Light and Movement, 1969), Il tempo dell’uomo (The Times of Man, 1970), and Sole in mano (The Sun in One’s Hand, 1973). The chapter positions Pirelli’s legacy at the axial point of Italy’s innovative art practices, its art history, and of the broader international discourse on the ontological significance of moving-images. The chapter ‘From Vertov to Cine Journals: Cesare Zavattini’s Experimental Journey’ by Carlo Coen, on one of the ‘fathers’ of Italian Cinema, stems from the exigency to identify an experimental and independent stream in the socio-cultural and theoretical history of Italian cinema – which is generally considered ‘classic’. Zavattini, the writer of the greatest masterpieces of Italian Neorealism, was however – and above all – an inexhaustible promoter and organiser of radical and long-sighted projects; a forerunner who conceived of an organic and harmonious multimedia system, in which cinema, television, written language and other forms of media, would all contribute to a deeper understanding of the political, social and moral, challenges of contemporary life. Zavattini’s world is one of commitment and humanism, and one that can be explored deeply through the audiovisual medium. The chapter identifies some ascendants of Zavattini’s thought: Dziga Vertov primarily, but also the documentary waves of Flaherty and Grierson, together with certain suggestions of the post-war French and Canadian cinemas (Astruc and his camerá-stylo theory and the Canadian filmmakers of the National Film Board). The core of the discussion, however, is found in the analysis of the main themes of Zavattini’s ‘grand’, chaotic, yet coherent, project: relying entirely on the very nature of the cinematographic medium, its ‘eye’, capable of exploring the world of people and of penetrating below the surface of reality, in\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 26\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n27\n\norder to eventually participate actively in the civil, social and political life of the times. Coen takes into consideration those films that best exemplify the sense of Zavattini’s thought in relation to the notion of independent cinema: his ‘collective’ films, those for which he played the role of coordinator and organiser, from L’amore in città (Love in the City, 1953), to I misteri di Roma (The Mysteries of Rome, 1963), and up to the series of political newsreels realised in the years of the student struggles and the so-called ‘Hot Autumn’ of 1968–9. The understanding is that the vast corpus of works created by Cesare Zavattini constitutes a single large-scale project, supported by a theoretical effort of equally great breadth. As pointed out by historian Lino Micciché, Zavattini’s work is acknowledged as the most important and advanced theoretical contribution ever developed in Italy on the function and sense of cinema. At the centre of the chapter ‘Gianfranco Brebbia: The “Absurd” and Expanded Quality of Experimental Cinema (1962–73)’, by Donatella Valente, are Brebbia’s practices of experimentalism in juxtaposition to the analysis of the filmmaker’s relationships with the artistic avant-gardes of his time. Influenced by the New American Cinema and by the Italian experimental trends of the post-war period (the ‘Spatialist Movement’, the ‘Concrete Art Movement’ and ‘Arte Povera’), Brebbia actively participated in the most significant and advanced experiences of the times. The initiatives he took part in include the ‘Cooperative of Independent Italian Cinema’. Brebbia’s cinematic dream amounted to conceiving a medium with which it is possible to express the most complex and daring vision. The chapter dwells on important details in this regard, especially when beginning to describe and comment on the main elements of Brebbia’s poetics. Valente examines numerous works by Brebbia – though they constitute only part of his vast filmography of over 100 films. It is through this probing description that the reader comes to appreciate the techniques used by Brebbia; through which he delved into forms of experimentalism that enlarged one’s horizon beyond habitual/familiar surroundings and practices and into uncharted territories. The proximity, and commonality of intent, between Brebbia and the initiators of the ‘Arte Povera’ movement, for example, led him to the targeted use of recycled materials in the composition of his films. The recycling of pre-existing audiovisual materials, was followed by Brebbia’s technical strategies characterised by experiments he carried out directly on film (the ‘film-scratch’ approach), which connects him to the experiences and work of Stan Brakhage, among others. These constitute the cameraless films. The conceptual notions characteristic of Brebbia’s art are ‘expansion’, centred on the use of several and different techniques combined with each other, and the ‘absurd’,\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 27\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\n28\n\nANTHONY CRISTIANO AND CARLO COEN\n\na word that recurs repeatedly in the titles of many of his filmic works, and which indicates the juxtaposition of real and oneiric elements. The author has met the daughter of Gianfranco Brebbia, and as a result the chapter is also accompanied and complemented by numerous stills, authorised by her, and by documents and testimonies that further illuminate the eclectic figure and work of Brebbia. The chapter on ‘Italian Family Films: The Case of the Archivio Nazionale di Bologna’ by Laura Ceccarelli constitutes an exclusive inclusion to this anthology offering a survey and study on a topic in need of critical attention. Ceccarelli introduces the topic by outlining its theoretical underpinnings and, thus, the socio-cultural relevance pertaining to discourses of identity and nationhood. Subsequently, she explores the Archivio Nazionale di Bologna (National Archive of Bologna), and gives an absorbing ‘tour’ of the curatorial and institutional practices along with the varied type of documentary material stored in its collections. Particular attention is given to the contextualisation of the significance, value and use, of ‘family films’ (also known as ‘home movies’). Sourcing such material has increasingly become a major concern for historians and archivists. Whereas the ‘badly’, or imperfectly recorded and stored family-event (or reunion) film may initially have been guided by personal memory and enjoyment purposes, it soon became evident that such audiovisual material is invested with greater historical and ethnographic significance and value. The category of ‘family films’ represents a record of endogenous culture, communities and the visual history of an entire nation’s nucleic textures. The author gives invaluable information on the curatorial efforts aimed at sourcing, gathering and classifying such material, along with the types of centres and institutions that are equipping themselves for the delicate procedures involved in such tasks. The review of the Archivio Nazionale dei Film di Famiglia (National Archive of Family Films) includes a consideration of the archivi femminili (women archives). Moreover, the Fondi (Collections) of the City of Bologna includes a number of diverse women amateur cineastes. Such material has enormous importance. For research purposes, they may be studied in a multiplicity of disciplines and fields, including departments of Gender Studies, Sociology and Anthropology. Though the biographies may be quite different, the women’s activities underscore the shared desire to narrate their life stories through film and video recordings, and thus voice their personal situatedness and sentiment. Ceccarelli’s study is of particular interest due to its scoio-cultural and national (if not international) appeal with a variety of people and professionals. The chapter ends by examining the varied use to which ‘family films’ have been put,\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 28\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n29\n\nand the necessity to acquire the proper sensibility and skills required to handle such delicate material. Gloria Dagnino is the author of the chapter ‘Independence as Opposition? Redefining Political Cinema Through the Case of Mirko Locatelli’. The chapter is particularly relevant for the epistemic contribution it makes to the definition and understanding of theories of Italian independent cinema, which have been long debated but are often misconstrued. The chapter begins by tracing the historical roots of the problematic construct, to the theoretical and socio-cultural discourse on the anti-fascist movement of La Resistenza (anti-German and anti-Fascist Resistance Fighters’ Movement of the Second World War). The chief trait of the Italian talent is supposedly evinced through the theoretical notion of ‘Italian difference’, which posits a conflictual, or oppositional, stance as the key characteristic of much Italian canon and thought, including the development of forms of independent cinema. Dagnino counteracts this recurring motif by seeking and offering an alternative perspective in one important practitioner’s viewpoint, that of filmmaker Mirko Locatelli and scriptwriter and producer Giuditta Tarantelli. The chapter is intelligently organised into sections, which aid and lead forward the discussion and understanding of the notion of ‘independence’, in the cinema, as a statement to creative, personal and expressive freedom. Dagnino delves deeper into the issues with the first-person testimony of filmmakers Locatelli and Tarantelli, whom she interviewed for this particular study. The chapter offers valuable insights into contemporary independent filmmaking procedures in Italy, its legalistic, economic, technical and logistic facets, making important references to Italy’s national cinema, as well as those of other European national cinemas, movements and trends. The unconventional paths pursued by individual Italian filmmakers and producers are exemplified in the careers of Locatelli and Tarantelli and, particularly, through an admirable defence of their authorial, aesthetic and ethical commitments and visions. The filmography under consideration includes the feature films, Il primo giorno d’inverno (The First Day of Winter, 2008), I corpi estranei (Foreign Bodies, 2013) and Isabelle (2018). Donatella Valente’s chapter ‘Travelling the World: The Essay Films of Massimo Bacigalupo (1968–77)’ is a study of the work of one of the central figures of the experimental and independent wave of filmmakers of the late Sixties and onward. Bacigalupo is one of the founders of the Cooperativa del Cinema Independente (Cooperative of Independent Cinema), and a spearheading figure of those pivotal events and years. He is the author of the introductory premise or ‘unofficial manifesto’ of the movement – if we are\n\n6380_Cristiano & Coen.indd 29\n\n06/06/20 4:02 PM\n\n30\n\nANTHONY CRISTIANO AND CARLO COEN\n\nallowed to retroactively refer to the events of the collective initiative in such terms – which appeared on the pages of the Italian cinema journal Bianco e Nero: ‘Il film sperimentale’ (The experimental film). Valente reviews Bacigalupo’s formative years and travel periods and offers a composite picture of the rich tableau of referents alluded t"
