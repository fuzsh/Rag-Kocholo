        "text": "It is widely acknowledged that continuity through change and coherence through experimentation constitute the defining attributes of Athenian Comedy. A number of major trends and patterns (e.g. politics, obscenity, personal satire) sustain this continuity throughout. At the same time there are certain minor trends, which further corroborate this continuity. Within particularly Middle Comedy we can often detect early traces of distinctive features that reappear in Menander and whose antecedents reach as far back as Old Comedy; e.g. the structure and content of argumentation bordering with fake philosophy, the speech patterns of parasites, as well as a number of other topoi. These characteristics complement our perception of comic continuity by drawing attention to the details. The present paper analyses these details, or “sub-trends”, in an attempt to increase our awareness of the internal mechanisms of the comic genre.\n\nThe early fourth century was a period of determinative transformations for Greek comedy. Aristophanes’ last extant plays (Ecclesiazusae, Wealth) seem old-fashioned, still clinging to the modes of Old Comedy while contemporary comic drama was moving towards new directions (mythological burlesque, domestic comedy of stock characters and recurring plots). In his two final plays, Kokalos and Aiolosikon, Aristophanes acceded to the new tendencies, taking up myth burlesque and introducing love-affairs and recognitions. The most influential factor conditioning the form of comic drama in the fourth century was the diffusion of Athenian comedy in the entire Hellenic world (“pan-Hellenization”). This is attested by archaeological finds (South-Italian vases illustrating Attic comedies, widely diffused terracottas of stock comic personages, festival inscriptions of various cities), as well as by literary authors referring to theatrical events in the Macedonian court and elsewhere. The huge productivity of the major fourth-century comic poets is explained as a response to an equally great demand for plays posed by cities and festivals all around Greece. The comic poets became professionals that earned their living from the theatre. The decline of political mockery in fourth-century comedy was largely a result of this new reality. Full-scale political plays became extremely rare: the last specimens are concentrated in the time of the Macedonian expansion, which sparked off a serious political crisis in Athens and reinvigorated to some extent political playwriting. Otherwise, the references to political figures and affairs are only incidental jokes inserted in comedies with entirely different plot (e.g. myth burlesques or domestic plays), in order to give topicality to the script. The comic playwrights knew that their plays had to appeal to broader, pan-Hellenic audiences; a comedy concentrating on Athenian political affairs would have no chance of such broader success. Similarly, the decline of choral parts is connected with the new conditions of travelling troupes performing their repertoire in various cities. These troupes usually did not carry along their own chorus but expected to collaborate with a chorus locally provided by each festival. The time available for rehearsal of these choruses with the actors would have been very limited. This led to a drastic restriction of choral parts, eventually reducing them to mere interludes.\n\nThere was nothing monotonous about Middle Comedy and its theatrical productions. Their remains, even though fragmented and mutilated, reveal a panorama of great variety in form and composition, at all levels of dramatic writing. The dramatists cultivated many different types of play, developed a rich repertoire of plot patterns and motifs, employed an extensive range of comic strategies. In the beginning of this essay, the students of Middle Comedy are compared to the poor Lazarus of the Biblical parable, feeding on crumbs that fall down from the rich tables of the other scholarly magnates. However, as we recall, there are two characters named Lazarus in the Bible. One of them is this pauper; the other one is a man that was raised from the dead. Perhaps Middle Comedy may also resemble this second Lazarus and become alive again, resurrected from the realm of oblivion, if we read its texts with proper care. It can be Lazarus, come from the dead, come back to tell us all, if only we prick up our ears to listen. (From the epilogue of the essay.) This much expected volume, which contains the proceedings of a memorable conference at the University of Freiburg, is now in print. A detailed Greek summary of my essay is attached here in PDF. An English summary will follow soon.\n\nMachon’s plays, staged in Ptolemaic Alexandria, seem to have employed the stock plots and characters of New Comedy. A few of their elements, however, are hardly typical of that genre. The mageiros in fr. 2 introduces himself as a lover of good food, intent on tasting his own dishes. This trait is not attested in cooks of extant Middle and New Comedy, but recalls figures of the earlier comic tradition: the Megarian Maison; some cooking personages in Epicharmus’ Sirens; the gourmand Cyclops of Cratinus’ Odyssês; Aristophanic protagonists preparing food for their own enjoyment; and the greedy Heracles of the Birds. The philological study of earlier comic texts flourished in Alexandria during that period, and Machon also seems to have been a scholar. His familiarity with older comic forms perhaps inspired him to borrow ideas from them and combine those borrowings with the standard materials of his contemporary comedy for innovative purposes. Dioscorides’ funerary epigram for Machon implies similar practices, stating that this poet revived the pungent spirit of ancient comic art.\n\nThe Paestan vase-painting of Zeus on a see-saw (from an unidentified mythological comedy) represents a type of comic scene known in ancient Greek theatre: erotic flirtation between two personages (an aspiring lover and his ladylove) is theatrically rendered through an actual game played by those two characters on stage. Parallels include Platon Comicus fr. 46 and 47 (Heracles playing kottabos with a prostitute), Antiphanes fr. 57 (possibly an enamoured god teaching the kottabos to young Aphrodite), Diphilos fr. 74 and Plautus, Asinaria 904ff. (hetaira and lovers playing dice). The Paestan picture parodies the traditional mythical image of Zeus weighing the fates or souls of opposed warriors in his divine scales, to determine the outcome of a fight (see e.g. Iliad 8.69–74, 22.209–213, Aeschylus' Psychostasia). In comic reversal, Zeus himself is now put \"in the balance\", rising and falling on the see-saw like the heroes placed in the scales. Such laughable inversion of traditional mythical roles was a staple technique in ancient mythological comedies."
