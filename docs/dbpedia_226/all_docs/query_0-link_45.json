        "text": "Action! - Spaghetti alla Sergio: Le grandi avventure di Sollima\n\nI must admit that I am proud with myself. As I watched this movie, I had the following thought: \"Man! This appears to be Sollima making a poliziottesco\" and indeed this is the case. And, given his background in film, it should come as no surprise that the director skillfully and with minimal hiccups works it into the story. As I mentioned in my review of \"Violent City,\" which was a cross between his Westerns and the thriller genre, this film feels even more so.\n\nTesti and Reed are superb on their respective roles, one a prison guard whose wife has been kidnapped and will only be released if they…\n\nSuperior Poliziotteschi from Sergio Sollima. At once a film about an unlikely partnership between a lawman and a criminal; and a seering condemnation of the corruption rotting society from its very core. Revolver is bolstered by the chemistry between Oliver Reed's prison warden and Fabio Testi's petty crook: the two thrown together as Reed's wife is kidnapped, with the demand being that he breaks Testi out of jail. It's this relationship that really gives grounding to the plot, which sees the pair find themselves subservient to a grand conspiracy far bigger than either of them can imagine. The theme of power really runs through everything. Sollima's direction is often unsubtle - plenty of high camera angles showing who is charge.…\n\nOliver Reed delivers a committed performance as Italian official Vito Cipriani as he's propelled into action when his wife is kidnapped by some vicious criminals as leverage to get incarcerated prisoner Milo Ruiz, played by Fabio Testi, released and delivered to them. He obtains the prisoner's freedom, abducts him to take it upon himself to mediate the transaction, and this slowly brings a begrudging friendship to develop between them both.\n\nThe character interactions between Vito and Milo consumes a large portion of the films overall runtime, and they have good chemistry together as they follow leads on the kidnappers which discerns them journeying across the border of Italy and into the French Alps. The direction from Sergio Sollima progresses the…\n\nContinuing with my recent trend of unwittingly picking out crime movies that were released in 1973... this time a brief dip into the Poliziotteschi sub-genre—a world of crummy cars, musty interiors, fur-lined jackets, ropey dubbing, and thick, bushy moustaches.\n\nOliver Reed’s protagonist, Vito Cipriani, flaunts the finest set of bristles. He’s a hardline cop willing to push the limits of the law in his hunt to find the thugs who kidnapped his wife. Instructed by said kidnappers to release a convicted felon named Milo Ruiz if he is ever to see her again, Vito complies, but subsequently holds the man hostage as collateral to ensure that his wife isn’t harmed by her captors.\n\nIt’s a familiar setup—two mismatched protagonists thrown…\n\nHave you ever seen a film and realized you apparently been watching a whole genre of its own that you had no idea it existed? Well, apparently this falls into a popular category of movies known as poliziottesco, which blends crime procedurals with action. In that sense, the first positive has to be that this one does a great job blending both genres to perfection. I would even add this feature toys with \"Road movie\" and \"Buddy cops,\" which gives a nice and often much fun and entertaining vibe to the picture.\n\nAnother thing that helps the film is the lead acting. Oliver Reed sass and Fabio Testi brute and somewhat clever persona. As they are on the different (thin)…\n\n“I don’t take the word of criminals.”\n\nI could not decide for the life of me if I wanted to get back on my giallo grind or attack my eurocrime watchlist so... I ultimately decided on crime...not only did I get my eurocrime fix but Fabio Testi also starred in it and I’ve been meaning to watch more of his stuff.\n\nA slower paced, character driven crime thriller that could have done with more action sequences but when there were shootouts and car chases it was well worth it!\n\nEveryone just smacks eachother in this.\n\nFucking damn.\n\nOliver Reed was so good when he was constantly kicking something, yelling into a phone or hitting Fabio Testi that I couldn’t help…"
