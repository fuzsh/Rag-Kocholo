I’ve seen New York ripper which was great. Very brutal, violent and quite bizarre too but still very thrilling.\n\nI’m not so much interested of 80’s horror anymore but I have the Zombie Flesh Eaters on dvd, haven’t watched it for nearly seven years. I liked it a lot back then though.\n\nContraband is strange film since people seem to regard it as one of the best of the crime genre or one of the worst. I don’t think it’s bad film but it’s not great either. Confusing plot and lots of violence and gore which is totally out of place.\n\nAnyone seen his early drama Beatrice Cenci with Tomas Milian? I’ve heard it’s supposed to be very good.\n\n[quote=“Bill san Antonio, post:8, topic:517”]I’ve seen only few non-westerns by Fulci, I’m interested of his giallos, Don’t Torture a Duckling and Lizard in woman’s skin.

There is and old U.K. pre-cert tape on the Fletcher label but it is extremely hard to find and it normally sells for well over £100!\n\n[quote=“ENNIOO, post:18, topic:517”]I have not seen this one, but I feel a purchase may be necessary.\n\nI never found the pre-cert of this tape.[/quote][quote=“ENNIOO, post:18, topic:517”]I have not seen this one, but I feel a purchase may be necessary.\n\nI never found the pre-cert of this tape.[/quote]\n\nI remember seeing the old “ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER” at a film fair at Watford many years ago but is was too expensive for me so i left it."
