        "text": "I'm going to transfer on this thread the three photos of the three Italian actors you sent to the previous thread.\n\nLet's start with your beloved Valentino.\n\nNone of the above. For me it is unequivocally Massimo Girotti.\n\nFrom the beautiful martyr St. Sebastian in \"Fabiola\" to the sexy, hairy shouldered rich daddy in \"Teorama\" this man was HAF at any age.\n\nI'm so fucking clumsy, R5. Lol.\n\nI put sexy Massimo Girotti on the previous poll, but i forgot to include him on this one. I won't start a new thread on the same topic again, because i guess they are going to kick me out and that would be justifiable! Damn.\n\nR1, i like Giancarlo Giannini more as an actor, but his son is sexier, in my opinion...\n\nR6, yes, why not...\n\nBecause Urbano Barberini is sexy as hell, R16 and this thread is about sex appeal and not acting skills.\n\nI guess you haven't seen 'Opera' by Dario Argento, or Otello by Franco Zeffirelli, R16.\n\nR24, i have heard about the gay rumors before. That's extra hot, if it is true.\n\nYou mentioned some very sexy Italian actors, guys. You have made this a very yummy thread. However, i still feel guilty about the Massimo Girotti omission.\n\nAnyway, i guess that you can make your poll and put the Italian hunks that you like. Just change the title and i don't think that you will meet any problem. I'm not the administration, though. There is no guarantee.\n\nYes, R36., they were both hot in their prime, i agree. Renato Salvatori had an animal magnetism in 'Rocco and His Brothers'. But, Renato didn't age well.\n\nR37, i don't want to sound like a bitch, but i wonder what Franco Nero found in Vanessa Redgrave. I guess he was attracted to her personality. I cannot explain it, otherwise. Great actress and an eloquent human being, but she was never hot, or beautiful.\n\nR38, you could ask the same question about Renato Salvatori: his biggest love was with Annie Girardot (i think they met during Rocco). She was a wonderful actress and had an interesting look, but she was not a bombshell. It was an unusual coupling...\n\nR38 Italian guys English girls. No VR was never a great beauty but Italian women can be bitchy, cunty and crazy. Franco and Vanessa definitely had chemistry because they got together much later in life again and got married. VR speaks pretty decent Italian too.\n\nR38, Frano himself didn't see much in Vanessa the first time they met. The director of the movie they were making wanted the actors to go out on a date, in order to build chemistry. Franco's first impression was that Redgrave was \"very ugly\" and that nobody'd believe he was attracted to her.\n\nsome tidbits I didn't know about Renato Salvatori: he retired from acting in the early 80s to work as PR person for an Italian Ministry. Sadly he died a couple years later (only 55yo) from cirrhosis. He was an alcoholic.\n\nR60 Not like in Italy! It is more magnified there. Especially with the fight for their husband's affection with their mother-in-law. In Southern Europe, Italy has the worst mother-in-law culture by far. That's why Italian guys can't wait to fins a foreign girl who thinks they are the ultimate romantic man until they meet mama. That's when The Greeks, Spanish and The French take over because the mother love is not as strong.\n\nTerence Hill was incredibly handsome in his youth, with those gorgeous blue eyes of his, and he remains a handsome older man He gets my vote, but lots of these guys are sexy.\n\nI had a big crush on Nino Castelnuovo after seeing \"Umbrellas of Cherbourg\". I would give an honorable mention to the French actor Jean Sorel, just because he made so many Italian films , a real heartthrob.\n\nAmerican films and French films. Thats pretty much it. Never german films either. Or very very rarely. La Grande Bellezza maybe in one of the cities, I dunno, but I missed it.\n\nIn NYC in the 80's we still had all sorts of global cinema but I guess its petering off quite a bit in this new world of how people consume cinema.\n\nRaf Vallone was so fucking sexy in \"Two Women\" when he seduced a \"reluctant\" Sophia in his shop before she set off on her trip with her daughter. He was dirty and scruffy and crude but Mama Mia, he was one spicy meatball.\n\nI don't know... never hear anything about that, R80. I wouldn't be surprised, tho... she sure loved to have fun!\n\nShelley didn't swing both ways. She would have said so in her autobiographies - and she said A LOT.\n\nShe did indeed get about a mile of choice dick in her time.\n\nWe should have a thread about her.\n\nI always had a thing for italian actor and chansonnier Duilio Del Prete (he was in two Bogdanovich films too). That GIF is superhot...what a chest!"
