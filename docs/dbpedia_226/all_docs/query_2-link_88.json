This article explores the use of dubbing among Italian and Mexican audiences of The Big Bang Theory and The Walking Dead. Fieldwork consisted of twenty-two semi-structured interviews, preceded by the textual analysis of the two series. Participants showed awareness that dubbing plays a role in the viewing moment and is clearly connected to the expected fidelity of translation, furthermore, it could be also a factor with wider social significance. In Mexico, watching dubbed programming was connected to issues of distinction and cultural capital, while in Italy dubbing is still pervasive but younger generations are using it less. In the current television landscape of wider availability of content and linguistic versions, interdisciplinary work with Audiovisual Translation scholars could be productive to account for the practices of international audiences.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLanguage is one of the main barriers for the international trade of television, therefore, it is also one of the first things to be adapted in order to make the content more palatable for audiences in importing markets (Chalaby 2002, 193; Sinclair 1999, 154). Traditionally, the most common methods for Audiovisual Translation (AVT) are: “(a) dubbing, (b) subtitling, and (c) the various forms of voice-over, commentary and narration” (Kilborn 1993, 642), although in most recent years several other methods have emerged, fostered by technological developments and the wish to improve accesibility (Chaume 2013, 106).\n\nEven if a large percentage of international television viewers watch translated programs, little attention has been paid to the practices they put at play when consuming these adapted texts (Tuominen 2019). Instead, there has been a tendency to treat translated programs as equivalent to the original ones, assuming that interpretations by domestic and foreign audiences arise from the same texts. This assumption carries implications for research dealing with international reception of television. It creates a blind spot, which obscures the work of the agents that adapt programming to increase its “cultural proximity” (Straubhaar 2007). In fact, dubbing and subtitling should be understood as transformative practices because “Not only do they significantly contribute to determining the meaning of the target text, but they problematize notions of a fixed, stable of textual identity” (Adamou and Knox 2011, 17). As a result, television programs that international audiences usually watch are not translated word for word but, depending on genre and the tradition of the importing country, they can be heavily adapted to better align with national taste (Barra 2009; Ferrari 2010; Kuipers 2015).\n\nLinguistic adaptation is applied routinely to content produced in all the main exporting markets, from Japanese anime to Turkish soap operas. Still, in the current scenario, American programming is particularly suited for analysis due to its wide availability for several popular genres.\n\nIn the era of “TV plenty” (Ellis 2000), American television reaches international audiences through new digital outlets that weaken the gatekeeping abilities that national networks traditionally had. Even if we put aside concerns of cultural imperialism and recognize that contemporary cultures are eminently hybrid (García Canclini 1989), it is still pertinent to study how members of local audiences are making sense of foreign television programs. This is especially true for those narratives that attain a high level of popularity around the world, to the point that they become shared points of reference—and identity—for large sections of the viewing public. The attitudes toward AVT methods, as well as the practices surrounding their use, should be considered when we conduct fieldwork with international audiences, but this has seldom been the case.\n\nTranslation in Media Audience Research\n\nIn the past, only a few scholars studying the reception of American television have reflected on the fact that most foreign viewers watch programs either dubbed or subtitled. For example, Liebes and Katz (1990), in their classic study on the cross-cultural reception of Dallas (1978–1991), found that the participants in their focus groups watched different versions of the soap opera: Japanese groups viewed a dubbed version, while Israeli groups saw a version subtitled in Hebrew and Arabic. These researchers considered the variety of language versions as a “methodological problem” and wondered, “if the immediacy of the viewing experience is not compromised by the intermediacy of subtitling and dubbing” (Liebes and Katz 1990, 25, 26). However, they eased their concerns by citing an audiovisual translation scholar, who had explored the understandability of subtitles used in Israeli television.1 Additionally, Liebes and Katz asserted that their own work confirmed that audiences of different cultural backgrounds achieved a “basic understanding” (1990, 26) of the dubbed and subtitled versions of the program they were studying.\n\nSuch observations were a rarity other scholars at the time overlooked the fact that their participants were watching translated versions of the programs case study. In Ang’s work on Dallas (1985), for instance, the method of translation used by Dutch audiences is not even mentioned, although it can be assumed that the program was subtitled.\n\nTuominen (2019, 6) noticed this general lack of attention by media scholars regarding translation, both in classic and recent research with audiences. She argues that authors like Ang conceive translation as “invisible,” while authors like Liebes and Katz see it as “visible but transparent,” because they “largely dismiss the potential of translations to influence the viewing process.” Tuominen explains that such positions seem to pervade even in the present moment in the field of media studies, where translation is either ignored, or acknowledged yet treated superficially.\n\nThe literature review conducted for this article confirms this claim. Several recent works dealing with the consumption of American television do not even mention whether audiences watched a translated version of the programs (see, e.g., Chicharro Merayo 2017; Grandío 2009; Pertierra 2012). Other works acknowledge that the content was dubbed or subtitled but the authors do not take time to reflect on the effects that translation could have on the viewing moment, nor do they recognize that viewers were watching an adapted text (see, e.g., Inzunza-Acedo 2012; McMillin and Fisherkeller 2009; Tan 2011).\n\nInterestingly, a few studies have found links between AVT methods and access to American TV. For instance, Andò and Gianturco (2011) noticed that viewers of Lost (2004–2010) would watch the series online with subtitles as a way to keep up with the most recent episodes, instead of waiting until they were available dubbed on Italian television. Articles focusing on Chinese audiences have also shown that young and educated elites rely on fansubbing to access programming trough online sites, thus, evading the official control over television content (see, e.g., Gao 2016; Peng 2016). Even when such studies have identified practices connected to AVT methods, they have not devoted a lot of attention to discuss the role that subtitling might play in the viewing moment, or how the subtitled program—translated by fans—could differ from the original. Once again, translation is assumed as somehow transparent.2\n\nIn the field of audiovisual translation there is an emerging interest for audiences (see, Di Giovanni and Gambier 2018). One of the main objectives of AVT reception studies is to seek “answers to fundamental questions about how audiovisual translations are processed” (Tuominen 2019, 8). Scholars in this field aim to measure the linguistic comprehension displayed by users of dubbing, subtitling, and other translation methods (e.g., voice-over, same-language captions, and surtitles). As a result, they have already examined extensively the advantages and disadvantages that dubbing and subtitling have for viewers (see, e.g., Chaume 2013; Jankowska and Kuipers 2012; Koolstra et al. 2002; Perego et al. 2018), but they are often more focused “on the specifics of interpreting and processing the translation than on the audience’s relationship with the entire media text and related questions of identity and culture” (Tuominen 2019, 10).\n\nIt would seem that, when studying audiences of foreign programming, reception scholars focus on issues of identity, culture, and on viewing practices. In the process, they devote very little attention to processes of linguistic and intercultural adaptation. AVT scholars, on the other hand, focus on the linguistic adaptation and, when they look at viewers, they see them mostly as decoders of visual and aural information, often disregarding the fact that they are individuals immersed in social contexts who approach specific media texts as part of interpretive communities. The divergent focuses of these two disciplines create a blind spot, artificially dislocating the process of watching translated television that is a daily experience for millions around the world.\n\nThe study reported here was designed to look not only at the differences that dubbing creates in the text but also at viewers’ reactions to them. The research question was, precisely, how dubbing fits into the viewing moment for audiences in two different countries where this AVT method is commonly found in most television systems. Specifically, I wanted to observe how viewers made sense of dubbed foreign shows, and discuss with them their perceptions on audiovisual translation, and on cultural differences between American culture and their own.\n\nThe theoretical background combined the traditional cultural studies approach for the study of audiences (e.g., Ang 1985; Jenkins 1992; Liebes and Katz 1990; Livingstone 1998) with ideas from the interpretive semiotics of Eco ([1979] 2013), literature on translation in general (e.g., Eco 2003; Torop 2010), and on AVT in particular (e.g., Delabastita 1989). For reasons of space and clarity, this article discusses only the results concerning the participants’ attitudes and observations about dubbing, not those on perceived intercultural difference.\n\nThis work contributes by offering empirical evidence to start delineating how international viewers deal with the pervasive presence of AVT in the reception of foreign television.\n\nMethods\n\nThis article builds mainly on findings from a 2015 research project that gathered the opinions of viewers from Italy and Mexico regarding dubbed television. Specific research objectives included the analysis of how dubbing works to adapt American programming for foreign audiences, as well as the exploration of viewing practices, and attitudes surrounding translated television shows in general.\n\nDubbing was selected because it is the most common AVT method in Italy and Mexico—two countries that have a long tradition in its production. American television was the obvious choice to ensure that audiences were familiar with the programs selected as case studies.\n\nAt the time of the fieldwork, The Big Bang Theory (2007–2019) and The Walking Dead (2010–) were at the peak of their popularity, and available in dubbed version in Open-to-Air and Pay-Tv in both countries. The programs come from different genres—a comedy and an action drama—in order to look for possible differences in adaptation and reception.\n\nPrior to the audience study, I conducted an analysis of three episodes for each show, as a way to observe how dubbing into Italian and Latin Spanish was adapting the culture-specific references contained in the visual and sound tracks, as well as those directly embedded into the story. The six episodes of the corpus were selected because they contain many culture-specific references to the American way of life.3\n\nFor each episode I created a database listing all culture-specific references in the original-language version, and then I compared them with their translations. Each instance was cataloged following Delabastita’s (1989) classification of five translation operations (i.e., repetition, deletion, addition, substitution, and permutation). Data obtained this way allowed determining whether the episodes of the corpus were being “domesticated” or “foreignized” (Ferrari 2010).\n\nThe comparative analysis revealed that the dubbed versions of The Walking Dead (TWD) kept most of the original culture-specific American references, while the dubbed versions of The Big Bang Theory (TBBT) included some Italian/Mexican references and humor. This was taken as an indication that genre could be a factor in the decision to domesticate or foreignize a program for international audiences.\n\nThis observation highlights the fact that original programming diverges from translated programming, depending on the level of domestication/foreignization that AVT specialists decide to apply. Foreign audiences are aware of this and may expect different dubbing conventions for different genres.\n\nThe reception study consisted of twenty-two semi-structured interviews conducted in six cities: Chetumal, Mexico City and Villahermosa, in Mexico, Naples, Rome and Verona, in Italy. The participants were twelve Italian and thirteen Mexican viewers in the age range of fifteen to forty years old. I took care to recruit roughly the same number of female and male participants for each show.\n\nThe respondents were asked to watch one of the previously analyzed episodes—“The Vegas Renormalization” for TBBT (2009), and “Walk with Me” for TWD (2012)—and then answer open-ended questions concerning their points of view on dubbing, audiovisual translation, and American culture as it was portrayed in the shows.\n\nDuring the textual analysis I identified the presence of culture-specific elements in each episode, as well as the operations that dubbing was performing on specific lines of dialog and visual elements. Therefore, during fieldwork it was easier to detect those moments where the participants should have noticed the divergences between the original and dubbed versions.\n\nDuration of the interviews ranged from forty-five to ninety minutes. The participants were informed about the objectives of the study and signed a consent form. For underage participants, signed consent was obtained from their parents and informed assent from them. Pseudonyms are used to ensure anonymity.\n\nAll the interviews were audio recorded and transcribed in full. The transcripts were codified qualitatively using NVivo 10 to identity those categories that emerged from the conversations. The two main categories (i.e., language adaptation and cultural specificity) had been already established in the guide, but the interviews yielded very rich information on many other aspects of television viewing, such as the reasons to prefer one TV system over another, the different paces to watch, the emotional connection with television series, as well as opinions on American television.\n\nSince the project is qualitative, the opinions expressed by the participants and the routines they reported are clearly not generalizable to all viewers in their home countries. However, they offer insights regarding the experience of audiences watching dubbed television in two distinct national contexts.\n\nResults\n\nThis section presents the main results concerning linguistic adaptation. It is divided in three subsections, each of them focusing on one aspect: firstly, the role of AVT in the viewing moment, secondly, the attitudes toward dubbing in terms of its perceived fidelity to the original text, and finally, the social connotations linked to the use of dubbing in Italy and Mexico.\n\nAVT in the Context of TV Watching\n\nThe current scenario of television offers a wealth of linguistic options that was unthought-of a few years ago. Global Subscription Video-On-Demand (SVOD) services, like Netflix and Amazon Prime, have accustomed viewers to the possibility of watching many foreign shows in the linguistic settings of their choosing. Therefore, viewers can develop a preference for a particular linguistic version, although this preference is far from being permanent or automatic, and it does not always align with the most popular AVT method in their country (Chaume 2013).\n\nThe analysis of the interviews revealed that, when selecting the linguistic version to watch an American program, participants in this study took into consideration several interrelated factors: (1) literacy, (2) disability, (3) the company they are watching with, (4) the desire to learn English, (5) their overall attitude toward television, (6) their level of engagement with the series, and (7) the textual characteristics of the program (e.g., genre, serial/episodic nature, complexity).\n\nThe four initial factors are self-evident. For instance, it is obvious that small children and people with dyslexia prefer dubbing, while the desire to learn English is a documented reason to watch subtitled programs (Koolstra et al. 2002). The rest of the factors, however, respond to the specificities that TV watching can take for individual viewers, or for communities.\n\nThe fieldwork indicated that influencing the choice between dubbing or subtitling was the conception of television either as a medium worthy of focused attention or as a distraction in the background. Among the participants, dubbing was perceived as easier to use than subtitling, therefore, dubbed versions of the series lend themselves to relaxed and distracted viewing, while subtitling demands more effort because it implies dividing the attention between the visual component of the program, the subtitles, and the audio channel. Alessio (thirty-nine-year-old Italian soldier) explained that he watches television for relaxation, so, he prefers listening “in Italian”. Alvin (twenty-two-year-old Mexican student) said that dubbing allows monitoring a TV program in a distracted way: for instance, it was more comfortable for the times when he would rewatch episodes of TWD while working on architectural models for his degree (this is a feature of dubbing that makes it preferable for the practice of second-screening).\n\nAnother factor that the participants connected to the preference for a language version was the level of engagement with a series. The most impatient fans seem not to care if the program is dubbed, subtitled, or even in a foreign language. For instance, Irma (twenty-seven-year-old Mexican employee at a telecom company), an avid follower of TWD, explained that the translation method became secondary, because she was so eager to watch the next episode that she could not wait for the cable premiere. So, the night TWD would air in the United States, usually one day earlier than in Mexico, she would stay up late to wait for the fans to subtitle the new episode. If she became too impatient, she would go to a pirate-streaming site and watch in English (even when she had very little grasp of the language), and then rewatch the next day on the cable channel with the official translation. Similarly, Virginia (twenty-four-year-old Italian university student) mentioned that when she was hooked in a show, she could easily overlook language. She confessed that during her three-day binge-watching of five seasons of TBBT, she was so entranced that she even watched episodes dubbed into Spanish with Italian subtitles.\n\nConversely, there were participants that conditioned viewing to the availability of their preferred language version. Ennio (forty-year-old Italian publishing manager) would also binge-watch whole seasons of TBBT. However, he would wait for the dubbing in Italian to be available on torrents and then slowly download all the episodes throughout the season. Spoilers became a problem because of the long wait, but, nevertheless, he showed very strong preference for the dubbed version and stated his admiration for the Italian voice actors. As the cases above seem to indicate, the preferred pace to watch a series, either at the moment of broadcast or delayed in time, was also a predictor of the preference for dubbing, which might in turn be related to the episodic or serial nature of programming. For instance, TWD is highly serialized and ends mostly in cliff-hangers that would urge viewers to watch the next episode, while TBBT is much more episodic in nature, creating a less urgent need to watch all episodes in order.\n\nOther textual characteristics of the programs, such as genre, emerged as reasons to define if viewers would watch them dubbed or not. Renzo (thirty-one-year-old Italian archivist), who during the interview demonstrated a vast knowledge of American popular culture and a good command of English, said that he preferred to watch TBBT subtitled or directly in original language, because it is a sitcom filled with American cultural references that could be difficult to translate. However, he clarified that for some other shows, like the procedural Bones (2005–2017), the Italian dubbed version was even better than the original because the voice of the protagonist sounded more feminine.\n\nBones is also a show filled with scientific jargon and plenty of exposition, which connects to the last textual trait that the interviewees mentioned. Serena (thirty-three-year-old Italian PhD student) pointed out that for her it was convenient to watch TWD or Lost with subtitles because these were action shows and also because subtitled episodes were available earlier than the dubbed ones. Yet, dubbing would be her choice for some other series like the spy thriller The Americans (2013–2018), which contain many dialogs and where the narrative situations are more complex: “Quelle [serie] in cui c’è tanto parlato, tanti dialoghi, e la situazione è un po’ più complessa, allora, preferisco in italiano.” (Those [series] in which there is a lot of talking, so many dialogues, and the situation is a little bit more complex, then, I prefer in Italian.) This last assertion seems to confirm findings in the field of Audiovisual Translation that indicate that dubbing grants an overall better comprehension of complex audiovisual texts (Perego et al. 2018).\n\nIn summary, the fieldwork revealed that for these viewers the selection of a linguistic version is fully integrated into the practice of watching television, and it seldom derives from a single condition. When both dubbing and subtitling are available, viewers weigh several factors in order to decide how to best watch a particular show. For example, if the program is highly serialized, like TWD, the most engaged fans would do everything in their power to watch it as soon as possible in the version that is fastest to put together. However, casual viewers of the same program may wait and watch it dubbed, if their conception of television is that of a medium for relaxation. If the show is episodic, like TBBT, there is no rush to watch the next installment but there are other conditions that could lead audiences to avoid dubbing, such as the perceived unfaithfulness of the translation. This is an aspect that will be discussed in the next section.\n\nDubbing and Expected Fidelity\n\nParticipants considered dubbing as less faithful than subtitling because it substitutes the dialog in the source language, making it impossible to monitor the original actors’ voices. But even if the original dialog cannot be compared with its translation, viewers have plenty of opportunities to detect the constructed nature of a dubbed program.\n\nThe interview sessions included the viewing of an episode this provided an opportunity to record several “reflexive moments of slippage” (Adamou and Knox 2011, 15) when viewers became aware of translation.\n\nIn Italy, followers of TBBT noted that the dubbed voice of the protagonist Sheldon Cooper was not the same that they were used to hear. This was caused by a temporary change in casting for a few episodes, which were later redubbed. I inadvertently showed the interviewees the version of the episode with the temporary dubbing actor, a change that was immediately noticed by all of them. Some even mentioned that they know well the voice of “Italian Sheldon” because the same actor dubs Naruto: Shippuden (2007–2017). This confirms the strength of the identification between dubbing voice and character on screen, and it is also an example of the dissonance that can arise when this unity is broken.\n\nThe example illustrates also the intertextuality that arises when viewers detect the voices of popular dubbing actors, a situation that occurred in Mexico as well, where some participants recognized the dubbed voice of Sheldon as belonging to a character from Dragon Ball Z (1989–1996). This led Hector (thirty-six-year-old Uber driver) to explain that when such a coincidence happens, it is difficult for him to assign this voice to a new character, instead, he would continue under the illusion of listening to someone from Dragon Ball and not from TBBT: “Escuchas la voz de algunos de ellos y dices: “bueno, creo que esta es la voz de uno de los de Dragon Ball.” Y estoy viendo a uno de los de Dragon Ball, ¡en vez de ver al de Big Bang!” (You hear the voice of some of them and you say: “Well, I think this is the voice of one of those from Dragon Ball.” And I am watching someone from Dragon Ball, instead of watching the one from Big Bang!)\n\nAnother common complaint about dubbed programs is that they sound artificial in accent and choice of vocabulary. In Mexico, this comes from the fact that Latin Spanish is a made-up variant of the language, used by dubbing studios in Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico to create a single version for the whole region (Sinclair 1999). Therefore, local viewers from different Latin American countries recognize that artificiality and reluctantly accept it.\n\nIn Italy, some participants also regarded dubbing as somehow artificial because it is done in neutral Italian. As a result, it sounds very different to the variety spoken in their regions, which usually contains dialectal elements. Dubbing in Italian sounds, to use the participants’ expressions: “perfect.” Alessio, from Naples, summarized this point of view: “The Walking Dead è perfetto, però. In italiano pulito, in italiano perfetto. Non c’è inflessione dialettale, parlano tutti un italiano perfetto.” (The Walking Dead is perfect, tough. In clean Italian, in perfect Italian. There is not dialectal inflection, they all speak a perfect Italian.) This was seen as a loss of the regional inflections in Italian but also of the American ones.\n\nIn spite of its availability on Open-to-Air TV, in Mexico it was very difficult to recruit participants that would watch TBBT only in dubbed version. So, it became necessary to interview fans of the series that would follow it mostly subtitled. When these participants watched the dubbed episode, they reacted with aversion and even shock. This reaction can be explained in part by the adjustment to the new voices but also by perceived infidelity in the translation. Particularly telling was the case of a couple that was interviewed together. Lizbeth (thirty-five-year-old illustrator) was a fan of the sitcom, having watched it mostly in original language, while Hector was a casual follower, watching usually with subtitles. They suffered through the viewing of the dubbed version, pausing at several moments to note the changes in meaning that they were detecting. The climax of complaining was the scene when Penny sings the lullaby “Soft Kitty” in Spanish. It is hard to convey their indignation at the rendering of the song, a feeling that was also shared by Brenda (twenty-one-year-old university student), Jessica (twenty-eight-year-old lawyer), and to a lesser degree by Victor (twenty-nine-year-old engineer). In contrast, viewers in Italy even knew the Italian version of the lullaby by heart and some of them sung it along Penny when they were watching the scene. The comparative textual analysis of the dubbing for this scene showed that the Mexican version was significantly less sophisticated than the Italian one. In Latin Spanish, the lyrics did not match the rhythm of the original song, nor did they respect the rhyme. The result was an adaptation that viewers considered disloyal.\n\nRegardless of their familiarity with English, Mexican viewers of TBBT noted that the dubbing in Latin Spanish was somehow betraying the meaning of several jokes and even the personality of their beloved characters. This was voiced very clearly by Hector and Victor, who separately arrived to the conclusion that the Latin Spanish dubbing of Sheldon Cooper made him sound gay, even when he is not.\n\nThe reactions of these participants remind the fact that people who watch a translated foreign show enter into a tacit agreement: they put their trust in the adaptors and expect that the program will be adapted for them and that they will get some help in understanding, but that there will be fidelity to the characterization of the protagonists and to the main ideas conveyed in the dialogs. Perceived infidelity creates somehow a breach of that contract.\n\nDubbing seems to serve a couple of conflicting goals: adapting a program to a different language while remaining as faithful as possible to the source culture. This a balancing act that it shares with all kinds of translation. For action-based dramas, like TWD, dubbing can be quite straightforward, focusing on a precise adaptation of generally short and simple dialog. Even the adaptation of culture-specific references for this show tends to the foreignization. However, dubbing of comedies like TBBT imply several extra layers of difficulty: first, there is the canned laughter in the soundtrack that marks the presence of every single joke, second, voice characterization is paramount, because voice actors should sound similar to the original ones, third, there is the wordplay, so common in humorous material, and, on occasion, there are songs as well. In addition to these common complications, for hit shows like TBBT there is also the pressure of fans, who are ready to shame dubbing professionals in online forums if they dare to change too much, as Emanuela D’Amico—the Italian dialog adaptor for TWD—pointed out to me in an interview back in 2016. In this regard, it is not surprising that the dubbing for the comedy TBBT, filled with wordplay and American culture-specific references, had come under heavy scrutiny by those Mexican and Italian participants with a higher command of English.\n\nOf course, a research interview is an artificial situation, in which participants feel inclined to discuss those aspects that the researcher has declared as the main focus of his/her interest. So, during the fieldwork for this project all the interviewees were eager to point what they considered translation errors in the dubbed episode they were watching. More research is necessary with audiences in natural viewing situations, in order to ascertain whether the identification of translation errors in dubbed programming is a common practice. Despite the elicitation that the interview provoked, it was still remarkable to witness how some of the participants literally dissected the episodes scene by scene. This happened with several fans of TBBT both in Italy and Mexico, while not a single participant criticized dubbing for TWD. In Mexico, a few viewers of this series would criticize dubbing in general, but not this specific case, which was actually produced in Argentina. In Italy, dubbing for TWD was generally praised.\n\nThe nature of the programs seems to have made a difference, since the translation of dialogs in comedy calls for more frequent and sophisticated negotiation than the translation of dialogs in action-based narratives. Thus, viewers with a higher command of English could pinpoint and criticize the negotiations made for dubbing and, if they considered that the fidelity to the original show was at stake, they could decide to avoid this dubbed version altogether.\n\nAn instance of such outright rejection took place in Latin America, when the Pay-Tv network Warner Channel attempted to offer all of its popular comedies, like Friends and TBBT, dubbed into Latin Spanish. The backlash from the audiences in the region was immediate on social networks sites and it made the headlines (El Financiero 2015). As a response, Warner Channel had to resort to the very uncomfortable solution of offering both English and Spanish language versions in Secondary Audio Programming (SAP) but leaving Spanish subtitles always on. Simply put, Warner Channel misread the social significance that watching in English with subtitles has for its middle- and upper-class Latin American audiences, an aspect that also emerged during the fieldwork.\n\nThe Social Significance of Watching Dubbed Programming\n\nAs we have seen, AVT is part of the daily practice of TV watching for audiences in countries like Italy and Mexico. Besides, it is a technological trait of the television medium that until recently was dependent on the configuration of the national media markets, but that in the post-network era (Lotz 2014) is slowly becoming more and more customizable. Beyond the individual preferences for dubbing, voice-over or subtitling, there are social connotations ascribed to the use of these methods, which vary between countries.\n\nIn the comparative study with Italian and Mexican viewers of TBBT and TWD, it rapidly became apparent that, at the time of the fieldwork, dubbing was conceived very differently. While in Italy, dubbing was the default AVT method for television, in Mexico it was connected mostly to Open-to-Air TV. All the Italian participants—regardless of age, profession, level of education, or familiarity with English—would accept dubbing willingly, four of them freely stating how proud they were of their national dubbing industry. For instance, Mario (twenty-seven-year-old physiotherapist) said that Italian dubbing is one of the best in the world (“È uno dei migliori al mondo, credo. . .”). Instead, Mexican participants—especially, but not only, those with higher level of English—, gladly listed the many faults of dubbing, praising instead the virtues of watching in original language with subtitles. For them, dubbing was the best method for watching animation, but not much else.\n\nThe attitudes of Italian participants attest to the power of tradition to explain the prevalence of some AVT methods in particular countries, as Jankowska and Kuipers (2012) observed for voice-over in Poland. However, it was still possible to find at least five Italian participants—among them the very young Aldo and Leonardo (fifteen-year-old high school students)—that were in the process of rejecting dubbing and becoming acquainted with watching in original language, as a way to improve their command of English. As Chaume (2013) has noticed, national preference for particular AVT methods might be changing rapidly in the new TV environment.\n\nIn Mexico, dubbing was not so entrenched, at least not for sitcoms and trendy action programs. The fact that most American shows on Pay-Tv have been subtitled for decades seemed to have created a division in terms of taste, so that watching television in original language with subtitles is a mark of distinction. Therefore, to use an example at hand, the audiences of Warner Channel in the country might not have the command of English to watch Friends without subtitles, but they are not ready to let go of the English soundtrack. In other words, they might not have the linguistic ability but they certainly want to retain the cultural capital (Bourdieu 1984) that comes from watching American shows in its original language.\n\nDuring the interviews, Victor noted that the target of TBBT in the country is the educated higher class, since the show had its larger following in Pay-Tv. When I objected to him that the show was also available in Open-to-air TV, he retorted that it was broadcasted after a very long delay “and dubbed.” When it arrives to “the people,” he said, it is because the broadcasters have already taken all of the profits they had to take: “Sí, ya cuando llega al pueblo es porque ya le sacaron toda la ganancia que le tenían que sacar.” (Yes, when it arrives to the people is because they have taken all of the profit they had to take.) In Victor’s opinion, shared by several Mexican participants in this study, dubbing has the connotation of being for the less educated and affluent audiences. As a result, more educated viewers would refuse it, especially if it is used to adapt a comedy like TBBT, targeted at people who would enjoy jokes about science and American popular culture.\n\nStraubhaar (2007) has argued that cultural capital influences the kind of programming that international audiences decide to watch. He found that elites in countries like Brazil are much more familiar with American popular culture than other segments of the national audience. It would seem that cultural capital has also a weight in the practices surrounding the use of audiovisual translation. In Mexico at least, preferring American shows to local ones is a matter of distinction, so it is watching subtitled programs instead of dubbed ones.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe mere presence of AVT in a TV program highlights the cultural distance that might exist between the audience in the importing country and the target audience in the country of origin. This target audience is the one that would ideally understand both the language and the culture-specific references in the series, so, it would align closer with the Model Reader of the text (Eco [1979] 2013). Building on Eco’s ideas, linguistic adaptation of television programs could be creating a new Model Reader closer to the importing culture. This is especially true for dubbing, which presents the foreign viewer with a reenactment of the dialogs in local voices, sometimes even with local accents as well. However, contemporary audiences with different characteristics have their own agendas regarding the level of cultural proximity (Straubhaar 2007) they would find desirable in TV shows. If adaptors decide to localize too much, or to change the traits of characters, as it happened with “gay Sheldon” in the Mexican dubbing or with the “Italian Nanny” reported by Ferrari (2010), some sectors of the local audience can sense that there was a betrayal to the original text and, thus, reject that specific adaptation. The desire for authenticity demanded by some participants in this study indicates that those viewers intend to appreciate the original American text in the fullest way possible. Since some audiovisual translation methods are seen as more faithful than others, then the selection of the linguistic version stands at the center of discussions about what foreign audiences might consider the best ways to watch—and truly understand—an American television show.\n\nIt became apparent from the interviews that some of these viewers show the implicit desire to become more like the original target audiences.4 Thus, they behave like Empirical Readers that want to become more like the Model Reader inscribed in the text. To do so, they aspire to climb a metaphorical ladder of linguistic versions, which would start in voice-over and dubbing, pass through subtitling and go all the way up to original language. This aspiration was manifested both by Italian and Mexican participants in the study reported here. Arriving to the top seems to offer the possibility to access the full meaning of the text, thus, becoming closer to the original Model Reader, who in the case of TBBT and TWD was clearly American. This is an intuition that needs to be observed further, because it might help contextualizing AVT within the study of international audiences of television, not as a secondary element but as a variable that by itself carries connotations of cultural hierarchy.\n\nIn the post-network era of television (Lotz 2014), alongside the wealth of content, there is an unprecedented availability of linguistic versions. It is possible that the link between the use of AVT methods to notions of taste and social standing observed in this study could become more relevant in some regions (see, e.g., Straubhaar et al. 2019). This is already true in countries like Mexico, where only social and academic elites acquire the command of English language necessary to watch American shows in original language, while the majority of the population watches translated into Spanish. For traditional dubbing countries like Italy, this form of translation is so pervasive in film and television that it keeps a hegemonic role. Therefore, Italian audiences’ preference for dubbing does not seem to respond so visibly to a class variable, as it does in Mexico. Nevertheless, there seems to be connection to generation, with some young and educated viewers combining subtitling and dubbing according to factors such as their engagement with the trendiest American programs, or their desire to learn English as a tool for professional advance.\n\nAVT deserves attention in audience studies because nowadays also traditionally exporting countries, like the United States, have more access to foreign programming from SVOD services. For example, streaming hits of global reach like Narcos (2015–2017), Money Heist (2017–), and Dark (2017–2020) are finding their way to American mainstream audiences in dubbed and subtitled versions. Since culture is intertwined with language, taking into consideration the linguistic adaptation of television is an aspect that might shed light on notions of local and global identity.\n\nFor viewers, dealing with translation is an intrinsic part of watching foreign programming. This article shows that viewers are aware that AVT methods change the text, demand a more or less attentive kind of viewing, may create moments of dissonance or unwanted intertextuality, and even carry social connotations regarding the best ways to enjoy particular shows or genres. It argues, finally, that interdisciplinary work with Audiovisual Translation scholars could be productive to account for the practices of international audiences in the current television landscape.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI am grateful to Dr. Romana Andò and Dr. Isabella Pezzini, who supervised the PhD Dissertation from which this article originates.
