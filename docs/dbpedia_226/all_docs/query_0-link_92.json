        "text": "A leading lady and supporting actress for five decades now, British actress Charlotte Rampling (b. 1946), also a Best Actress Oscar nominee for her performance in “45 Years” (2015), has quite a bit of interesting film projects coming up. On March 2, her next film, “Red Sparrow” with Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Irons, will be released in the U.S.; her other films, which will be out later this year, are directed by Lian Lunson, Lenny Abrahamson, and Lech Majewski. Maybe those filmmakers don’t ring a bell, but they were able to cast Ms. Rampling, one of the most memorable actresses of her generation who won the Best Actress Award at the 74th International Venice Film Festival last summer for her work in the Italian-French-Belgian co-production “Hannah,” directed by Andrea Pallaoro.\n\nShot on location in Italy and Belgium, this continental art house film was the main reason for Ms. Rampling to come over to Rotterdam’s International Film Festival this month, where she took the time to talk about her career during a highly interesting masterclass which I edited here to some extend.\n\nMs. Rampling, can you tell what “Hannah” is about?\n\n“Hannah” is a film about a state of being, about how consciousness works in a way, and how you get through a phase of being which shocks you so much that you almost become unable to function. Through the shock, you emerge into denial that you carry on. When watching “Hannah” in the beginning, you don’t know what is happening, but the point of the film is to try and get into the head of a woman—or a human being—who is going through a particular state. I think it’s a very fascinating way of making films, and very few have perhaps been done in this very rigorous way. I think [film director] Andrea Pallaoro did it in a very profound, artistic, and creative way—almost like an art stylist. There’s a lot of natural sounds and very little dialogue. So everything is about the shock of how you are feeling and about how you will feel as you go along with the character of Hannah on this journey.\n\nWhy did you want to make this film?\n\nThis kind of cinema has fascinated me ever since I met [Italian film director] Luchino Visconti. I had made a film with him called “The Damned” [1969], and I couldn’t believe that there could be such extraordinary, magical beauty in other ways of making films. His was a very operatic way, a very grandiose way, but it still didn’t feel to me about entertainment; it felt about states of being. The way he was able to bring these extraordinary creatures alive in films—I had never seen films like that. I was in my early twenties then, and I didn’t have a great culture of cinema back then. But I realized that this was the kind of cinema I wanted to make part of my life, rather than just adventures in storytelling time. Little by little, I found I was able to go into the human soul through different directors along the way—up until now with Andrea. We were able to do it almost like an art piece; we were able to condense all that I actually wanted to do in terms of getting into the head of a woman. To me, there’s a kind of perfection about this film for that. You may not like it, you may not like the genre, you may not like the way we made it, but for me, there is a kind of perfection about the genre, about what we wanted to do, which was to become Hannah in a sense.\n\nYou never play your parts; you always become your characters. How does that work?\n\nWe actors are like vehicles of who we are, and all human beings feel more or less the same way. If we are injured or lose a loved one, we all feel the same kind of pain. We all feel joy and pain the same: the basic human emotions are the same. Actors are able to just channel those feelings and make them interesting so that they actually are believable. Then people will say, ‘Oh, that’s the way I also felt about that.’ And it is the way you feel about that because we’re feeling it as you were feeling it. So that’s the technique, and that’s the way we make films.\n\nWhen did you first realize that this was something you could do?\n\nIt grows on you. I very quickly knew that a lot of acting was fake. I didn’t like it at all, and I thought, ‘I don’t want to be doing something fake.’ It didn’t reflect anything about who I thought I was and who I thought I could become. That’s why I spent quite a long time in Italy, because there they were able to make me feel that I was never fake. Somehow in Hollywood, I got very worried because I didn’t like the way I was representing life. I felt a great responsibility to what it is to be a human because I was acting them. I got worried because if I was playing a character I thought wasn’t real, it simply wouldn’t work. It was wrong, so it sort of came about like that. But don’t get me wrong, this doesn’t mean that the characters in Hollywood are fake—not at all. There’s just this mechanism that didn’t suit me. And of course, you can’t always have to believe that you are true to the character you play in those big adventurous films that the Americans do. You have to find a way, a sort of mode d’emploi, that make it possible to film these kinds of stories. But my universe was getting smaller and smaller because of all the art films I did in Italy—after Visconti. Some of those films were very small, working with a small crew—a family of people—which possibly made it easier for me to be on the same wavelength with. I could imagine that, I could also imagine that I was safe within something that was making sense to me, and therefore possibly would make sense to new spectators when they saw my work.\n\nDo you also get a lot of freedom to portray your characters the way you wanted?\n\nDirectors usually give you that freedom: mainly they choose their actors, and then they want their actors to become, just watching them, things that they even perhaps couldn’t have imagined. They thought it could have been done this or that way, and then this actor comes along and does it in his own special way. That’s usually what a director loves.\n\nDo you watch your films once they’re finished?\n\nI really want to watch them once after they’re finished, maybe twice if it’s a film that really interests me, because I probably don’t get as far as I want to get or see what the director wants by seeing it once. Then I really want to know the story, know the plot, and get into it quietly. I’ve done that with “Hannah.” I had seen it, and then again in Venice on a very big screen. And there, I knew it was a really fine piece of work on all levels. I don’t know if people will like it, but I knew what I had seen. I saw the quality.\n\nWhat attracted you to do “’45 Years” [2015]?\n\nFor the same reasons: I need to be able to study characters through film. That’s what I do for a living. And when I’m doing it, that’s when I’m happy. With subjects like “45 Years,” “Hannah” or other films that I’ve done, they allow me to do that, and that’s when at my happiest. I’m almost like a trained horse: I know I can jump higher than anybody [laughs]. I think it’s important and interesting that authentic people are shown on the screen as they are. I always feel what I feel, and with the characters I have been playing in recent years, I want to see my face really really old and wrinkly—and it is getting old and wrinkly [laughs]. That’s the truth I want to live with.\n\nYou have been in the spotlight now for so many years. Is it hard to be judged all the time for the roles you choose or for the things you do?\n\nYes and no. You know, you have to make a choice, so that means that someone is going to be able to criticize you or say something about you. If you put yourself out by making a choice, then you have to accept the consequences. So you have to work your way around it so that it’s not uncomfortable. You can’t live hating yourself for what you do or hate people for what you might think they’re doing to you. Then hate hate hate comes in, and you’re in a hate world. If you just analyze quietly over the years the things you did, the consequences are on you. It’s an intelligent way of trying to become a moderately normal human being, probably—thinking about what you’re doing and about the consequences of what you’re doing. Accept the consequences of what you’ve chosen to do.\n\nThere was a period in your life when you took some time off, and then French filmmaker François Ozon brought you back to the screen with “Sous le sable” [2000, a.k.a. “Under the Sand”]. Is that correct?\n\nI did take some time off to do other things, and because I wasn’t strong enough to be the person who you’re talking to now. I wasn’t strong enough to accept all the consequences; they were getting at me. So I went into silence and into myself, into contemplation. And when I came back, someone came out of the blue and met me. And that was François Ozon. When you know you’re not coping with things as they are, you take other ways, and you start to do what you feel you should do to keep structuring your life. And so he came in. He offered me a role where I was allowed—without actually knowing it—to go into grief. A lot of the reasons why we become stuck in life is because of grief. We have no idea how to grieve, we lose people, we don’t give it enough time, we keep on moving—and then it gets you. That’s what happened to me in that period. So François Ozon came with this story, I didn’t actually think about it, he just knocked on my door, but I was so amazed by his story—the idea of this man disappearing in the sea who has never been found. When someone disappears, you don’t have anything to hold on to. No body, nothing. So the woman I played [his wife] had to come to terms with something completely unacceptable. Later on, I realized it helped me with the grieving process of my sister, who died when she was in her twenties. And when we’re not healing and when our feelings are in such distress, the best thing to do is to be creative. We all have huge creative talent; we must remember that—so be creative whether it’s acting, painting, writing,… That’s what saves us. You don’t do it consciously, but things happen as you are doing it. I never think, ‘Oh, this is a film about grief, and now I can grieve over my sister.’ It works in very mysterious ways, we just have to be open to the potential of creativity and make something of it in our life.\n\nIn December 2015, Ms. Rampling was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the European Film Awards in Berlin. French filmmaker François Ozon, one of her favorite directors, was a surprise guest to honor her. That very same evening, she received the Best Actress Award for her performance in “45 Years.”\n\nWhat about François Ozon’s “Swimming Pool” [2003], I guess this film is also close to your heart, isn’t it?\n\nYes. François wrote “Swimming Pool” for me, and I called my character Sarah, after my sister. This film was also a huge success in America; they really liked it. I haven’t made many films the Americans liked [laughs], but this one, they really did.\n\nIn both films, you play women with complicated feelings. You like this kind of character, don’t you?\n\nYes, because I like to be contre courant—against the current—that’s my nature. That’s why I do the things I do. We do the things we do for a reason; we may not know what the reasons are, we don’t have to care about them. But they are there, and that’s what guides us. ‘I know that I’m gonna do another film that is contre courant.’ But I understand that people sometimes want to see films that are easier, where the emotions are gentle, you don’t have to try too hard. You can sit there, and the music will sort of just go along with you. You don’t need to be challenged all the time, and that’s fine. But there’s a place for all types of movies, so hopefully, cinema will always be around for films that aren’t the big ones that have the money. They’ve been making those for many years now, and they’re still making them. For me, it’s an inner challenge. I always work completely by instinct, and I think I have a very good instinct, a sound instinct about things. It has always done me well. So I give over to it. If I analyze the situation too much, I have too many possibilities, and I go crazy, you know.\n\nWhat about “The Night Porter” [1974]? When you first read the script, you must have realized it would become a very controversial film?\n\nI wondered when that was coming [laughs]. Well, I don’t know what ‘must have known’ means actually. I mean, realize what? I had read the screenplay, and I thought it was amazing. I also had worked with Dirk Bogarde in “The Damned” [1969], and he had asked [film director] Liliana Cavani to send the script to me because they hadn’t found the girl yet. And so after I had read it, I just knew I wanted to do it. For me, it was a kind of illumination. I wanted to make this into a love story with Dirk Bogarde; that’s what we wanted. The story is also an analysis about the Nazi guilt—it all takes place after the concentration camps when they meet again and he imprisons her in this apartment. It’s a decadent love story, but then again, it was life, it was reality. People said, ‘Oh, this could never happen.’ But believe me, it did. The girl was real; she lived this with her Nazi torturer. And then, when the film came out, they did a lot of promotion—something I had never been involved in before—so this was big time, and I was the ‘kinky queen’ [laughs]. Newsweek did a whole page about it. But this film is very close to my heart: it’s like my initiation. So much happened in the movie too. It’s so raw, and the film became what it became—very, very provocative, and it brought out all sorts of reactions.\n\nWhat happens to all your characters once you have played them?\n\nHa! I keep them all locked up in a black box, and only I have the key. And they’re probably all fighting to be number one [laughs].\n\nInternational Film Festival Rotterdam (Netherlands)\n\nJanuary 25, 2018\n\n“Hannah” (2017, trailer)\n\n“Red Sparrow” (2018, trailer)\n\nFILMS\n\nA HARD DAY’S NIGHT (1964) DIR Richard Lester PROD Walter Shenson SCR Alun Owen CAM Gilbert Taylor ED John Jympson MUS The Beatles CAST John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Wilfrid Brambell, Norman Rossington, John Junkin, Victor Spinetti, Anna Quayle, Phil Collins, Brian Epstein, Susan Hampshire, Richard Lester, Charlotte Rampling (Girl at Disco [uncredited])\n\nTHE KNACK… AND HOW TO GET IT (1965) DIR Richard Lester PROD Oscar Lewenstein SCR Charles Wood (play ‘The Knack’ [1962] by Ann Jellicoe) CAST Rita Tushingham, Ray Brooks, Michael Crawford, Donal Donnelly, William Dexter, Jane Birkin, Richard Lester, Charlotte Rampling (Extra [uncredited], Jacqueline Bisset\n\nROTTEN TO THE CORE (1965) DIR John Boulting PROD Roy Boulting SCR Roy Boulting, Jeffrey Dell, Len Heath (story by Roy Boulting, Jeffrey Dell, Len Heath) CAM Freddie Young ED Teddy Darvas MUS Michael Dress CAST Anton Rogers, Charlotte Rampling (Sara Capell), Eric Sykes, Ian Bannen, Thorley Walters, Peter Vaughan, John Boulting\n\nGEORGY GIRL (1966) DIR Silvio Narizzano PROD Robert A.
