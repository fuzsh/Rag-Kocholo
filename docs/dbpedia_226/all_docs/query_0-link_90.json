        "text": "Friends, I’m writing this post on my phone throughout the day as I travel from Chennai, Tamil Nadu to Seminyak, Bali. This being the case, it is far more bare bones than usual, but I am stubbornly continuing this annual tradition in whatever form I can manage. Every year, a few people watch some very good movies that they otherwise wouldn’t have because of this post, and that’s important to me. I will be the only one providing comments this year (Angela has to work, Josh and Isabel are busy with their daughter’s birthday) but you’ll certainly be curious about one movie in particular that Josh and Isabel cited as a favorite. It is almost universally despised, so I asked them if they could briefly explain why it appeals to them so much. If you’re curious (after reading the lists), Josh pointed to Collin Brinkmann’s letterboxd review as the piece of writing about this film that most closely reflects their stance: https://boxd.it/5yVext\n\nRegarding the slate of Oscar movies, I feel typically grouchy this year. I didn’t especially care for any of the ones I’ve seen. I haven’t gotten to Zone of Interest yet and I intend to give it a shot when I get home to my surround sound setup, but as of now, the only one that interests me at all is Killers of the Flower Moon. I’m ambivalent towards it: I do think that it reckons in interesting ways with America’s dark history and the difficulty of representing it in popular media, but I was disappointed by the way it handles the core marriage relationship. What’s most intriguing to me is the implication that the Gladstone and DiCaprio characters really do love each other (which makes this the second consecutive movie from Scorsese about a guy who kills everything he loves because his boss told him to). However, the movie doesn’t actually convince me that they love each other, nor does it give us an adequate view of their relationship. It’s a huge movie, and I kept wishing we could spend more of it in intimate spaces with just these two characters. While Gladstone’s performance has obvious merits, it doesn’t help much on this front, nor does DiCaprio’s.\n\nI thought Anatomy of a Fall was okay, but a significant step down from Triet’s earlier work. I didn’t mind The Holdovers and I’m willing to give Oppenheimer another spin, but I strongly disliked Past Lives, Barbie, and Poor Things. I don’t begrudge anyone their pleasures, but these are just not at all for me.\n\nThere were, however, a few movies this year that I loved with my whole heart, and I’m glad to take this opportunity to celebrate them. I wish I had gotten to see the Wiseman in time for this post, but otherwise I did reasonably well. I very much enjoyed reading the lists included below from my wife Angela, my brother Josh, and my sister-in-law Isabel. Angela and I disagree as often as we agree, which always keeps things lively around the house.\n\nMatt Strohl\n\nClose Your Eyes (Erice): A very engrossing mystery that gives way to haunted poetry. How much this affects you will depend a lot on your relationship with the medium, as it is at its core a movie about movies, but it made me weep like few other 21st century titles have. It has an immensity that barely seems possible anymore (and I don’t mean the kind of immensity that costs 250 million dollars to bring to the screen).\n\n2. Ferrari (Mann): First of all, I am sick to death of hearing people complain about the accents. I don’t want to argue about it except to say that nothing could possibly matter less to me than whether accents in movies are realistic and I have trouble imaging what it would be like to watch THIS incredible film and have THAT be your takeaway. Far from a conventional biopic (thank god), this is Michael Mann’s Red Line 7000. It studies the masculine-coded drive to live in the constant company of death, the feminine-coded civilizing influence, and the tragedy that follows from their synthesis. At the same time, it is an uneasy self-portrait of Mann as the commendatore. It’s a rich and complex film that I expect will continue to unfold for me through repeated viewings across many years, and it deserves a much more thoughtful reception than it’s generally gotten.\n\n3. The Plains (Easteal): It is essentially three hours of commuting in Melbourne rush hour traffic, but it contains almost no dead time. There is always a phone call being made or a conversation happening with a younger colleague who’s along for the ride, and through these conversations the film develops a harrowing rumination on mortality and the transience of human life. Eventualities that seem like they’re on an impossibly distant horizon come and pass with disarming speed as our lives slip through our fingers. I walked away from this utterly devastated.\n\n4. Diary of a Fleeting Affair (Mouret): Watch this! It’s a treat, like every Mouret movie. It does what it says on the tin: it gives us a distilled retelling of a fleeting affair. It’s mostly just two great actors walking and talking, with the camera always placed somewhere interesting. It builds more impact than you might expect, and the final moments took my breath away.\n\n5. Afire (Petzold): It’s a wonder how this manages at once to be so light on its feet and so apocalyptic. It’s a sly film that plays as a very funny comedy of embarrassment while developing something far more disconcerting beneath its surface through the centering of an unreliable perspective.\n\n6. Trenque Lauquen (Citarella): Laura Citarella returns to her interest in storytelling as a form of investigation. Multiple genres flow together into a single narrative that spirals into a seductively elusive abyss while retaining a legible emotional arc. I really enjoyed spending a long afternoon lost in this film’s strange world.\n\n7. May December (Haynes): I slapped my forehead many times over the way the discourse about this movie devolved into platitudes about who has the right to tell whose story and what artists owe to their subjects. It seemed like a lot of people would have preferred to see the movie that is being made by the characters in May December. Haynes’ film is not primarily the story of a teacher who had sex with her underage student and then had children with him and married him. It’s first and foremost a method acting procedural, and the way it implicates us in the actress’ point of view and invites us to partake of its many sleazy pleasures exposes the prurient underbelly of our obsession with such stories (and their authentic representation).\n\n8. Padre Pio (Ferrara): Not a friendly or easy to like film, but I admire its jagged provocations. It is less a work of hagiography and more of an indictment of the church’s role in the rise of fascism in Italy. It also has a self-reflexive dimension that I find at once troubling and compelling with the casting of Shia LaBeouf as a penitent reckoning with his own transparent hypocrisy.\n\n9. Human Flowers of Flesh (Wittmann): On the surface, it’s a sensory immersion in the Mediterranean, but it examines the way its images and sounds are inflected by the history of the zone and the tradition of storytelling that stretches from The Odyssey to Beau Travail. For me, intoxicating and fascinating.\n\n10. The Covenant (Ritchie): Centered on two great performances from Dar Salim and Jake Gyllenhaal, this is one hell of a movie about honor and courage and living by a code, but it’s also a vigorous indictment of America’s refusal to cash the checks it’s written in the Middle East. Ritchie’s heavy use of drone photography really makes the terrain come alive.\n\nHM – The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial (Friedkin), Fallen Leaves (Kaurismäki), Copenhagen Cowboy (Refn), Shin Kamen Rider (Anno), The White Storm 3: Heaven or Hell (Yau).\n\nAngela Shope\n\nNapoleon (Scott)\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon (Scorsese)\n\nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Wrench)\n\nClose Your Eyes (Erice)\n\nAfire (Petzold)\n\nFallen Leaves (Kaurismäki)\n\nAnatomy of a Fall (Triet)\n\nOppenheimer (Nolan)\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4 (Stahelski)\n\nTrenque Lauquen (Citarella)\n\nJosh Strohl\n\nAfire (Petzold)\n\nFerrari (Mann)\n\nClose Your Eyes (Erice)\n\nThe Caine Mutiny Court-Martial (Friedkin)\n\nThe Boy and the Heron (Miyazaki)\n\nAsteroid City (Anderson)\n\nFallen Leaves (Kaurismäki)\n\nMay December (Haynes)\n\nPriscilla (Coppola)\n\nMenus Plaisirs – Les Troisgros (Wiseman)\n\nHM – Pacifiction (Serra), Beau is Afraid (Aster), Napoleon (Scott), Killers of the Flower Moon (Scorsese), R.M.N.

Angela is a painter with a background in art history, and I am something of a food enthusiast. She had never been to Italy at all and I had only been to Venice. She hates sun and heat and I hate crowds, so we decided to go in January. Overall, I think this was the right call.\n\nThe cons: a number of restaurants and gelato places in Bologna were closed for a post-holiday break (coming in February instead would have made a difference here), and a large number of gelato places were closed in Florence. Pretty much everything in Rome and Napoli was open. Two of the hotels we stayed at were undergoing renovations, which was loud during the day but brought the price down and didn’t affect us very much. Some museums had partial closures, but generally nothing we cared about seeing. It was cold in Bologna, but mostly the weather was comfortable.\n\nThe pros: way, way, way fewer people. In Napoli and Bologna there were almost no other tourists around. Florence still managed to be annoyingly crowded in the touristy areas but I can only imagine how hellish it must be in the summer. Rome was fine aside from the Vatican Museum (which is apparently always at full capacity) and the Colosseum (which is ok as long as you prebook and go early in the day). The Trevi Fountain and the surrounding area were generally crowded and totally packed on weekends, but I didn’t enjoy that part of the city much anyways (full of instagrammers, luxury boutiques, bad food).\n\nPeople will tell you that it’s hard to find a bad meal in Italy, but this was not my experience at all. Overall, I would say the food was hit or miss (and of course I did a lot of research in advance). Like most places, you can’t take recommendations from random people and expect them to reliably pan out. In Bologna, for instance, a trusted friend relayed a recommendation for Trattoria di Via Serra. I asked the hotel manager to call them and make a reservation for us and he flew into a rant:\n\n“NO VIA SERRA. It is booked for two months. I know Via Serra. Is popular only because of TripAdvisor. On this street alone there are five restaurants that are just the same. Via Serra is far from city center. You should go to Biassanot. It’s very good. Biassanot!”\n\nThis sounded plausible to me in as far as I do believe that TripAdvisor and other online rating aggregators can tend to be reverse predictors, so I let him book us for Biassanot instead. But we also decided to walk over to Via Serra just before they opened and try to walk in for lunch. He was right about one thing (and only one thing): they were indeed booked out for weeks. But they keep four bar seats open for walk-ins and we were able to have lunch. Reader, it was tremendous. They served us some of the best food we had on the whole trip, and the rest of the menu was impressive (lots of snail symbols indicating the use of high-quality products certified by the Slow Food Alliance). Biassanot, on the other hand, was abjectly terrible (think lamb chops cut to very unevenly and served grey and well done, low quality charcuterie for premium prices, etc.). Biassanot was one of the most expensive meals we had the whole trip and easily the worst. To add insult to injury, we were seated next to a table of posh Brits who spent the meal pretending to know a lot about wine and repeatedly thanking each other for coming along on holiday.\n\nThe overall culinary winner was Napoli by a long shot (I’ll Anglicize the other cities but calling Napoli “Naples” just feels wrong). The abundance of extraordinary (and inexpensive) pizza and sfogliatelle is hard to compete with. Every city/region had notable highlights, however. I’m not going to do a complete recap, but will instead make some overall comments for each area and highlight the places that I’d recommend without qualification.\n\nBologna\n\nLots of closures in Bologna so I didn’t get to try a few promising places (like Grassilli). Contrary to what your hotelier may tell you, I would be highly suspicious of crowded places in the center of town.\n\nTrattoria di Via Serra\n\nBook far in advance (you have to call, but they speak English) or show up early to walk in. Totally worth it. The menu is representative regional food done extremely well with high quality ingredients. It’s a little bit of a walk from the city center but very doable.\n\nMò Mortadella Lab\n\nInexpensive lunch place with two locations. Made me moan with pleasure in the middle of a crowded sidewalk, embarrassing Angela. With mortadella this good, I think it’s more embarrassing to not moan. This is a can’t miss in my book.\n\nFlorence\n\nI was the least impressed overall by the food in Florence. It’s very meat-heavy, and I’m sure if you shelled out big bucks for a thick dry-aged steak you could get a pretty good one, but that’s not really something I’m interested in. The problem I have is that the secondi are generally just piles of sliced meat or offal in sauce with nothing whatsoever to balance them. There are side dishes (“contorni”) on the menu but little effort is made to coordinate them with the mains and they are generally just potatoes or greens. The greens are usually watery and unsalted. It’s just not what I want with a big pile of offal. I want some damn pickles— something bright to cut through the richness. It wasn’t till Rome (see below) that I was actually offered something desirable as a side dish.\n\nMy favorite sit-down place in Tuscany was not in Florence, but rather in Siena (an excellent day trip):\n\nEnzo e Sonia\n\nWe walked by this place and my spider sense went wild. I announced to Angela: “Good food here! I am having an intuition!”\n\nIndeed it was so good (and the couple running it was so charming) that after having a terrific lunch I insisted at the end of the day that we hang out in the coffee shop across the street until they opened for dinner and then take the late train back. Beautiful food, warm hospitality. It’s the kind of fantasy dining experience you hope for when you plan a trip to Italy.\n\nBy far my favorite meals in Florence proper were inexpensive street food:\n\nPanini at Semel\n\nCan’t miss. This place is amazing. The paninis are five bucks and I ate three of them in ten minutes (venison with mushroom, cacio with truffle and pear, and anchovy with fennel). The guy slinging them is an old school icon, and when he asked me what I thought I gave him a big, enthusiastic chef’s kiss and blurted out every Italian superlative I could come up with, which pleased him greatly.\n\nSergio Pollini Lampredotto (aka Tripperia Pollini)\n\nAround lunchtime in Florence you’ll see many of the tradesmen working in town head over to the lampredotto stands for a sloppy sandwich or a cardboard tray of stew with bread on the side. Lampredotto is part of the cow’s stomach, braised and served either in a tomato broth or with a salsa verde. Most stands also have stewed tripe. Pollini is the most famous stand and I liked it very much. Tender lampredotto with bright, spicy accompaniments. Angela isn’t the world’s biggest offal eater and even she was happy to wolf down a large portion. The guys who run the stand were a lot of fun as well, and very friendly. They gave me some stickers to advertise them in Montana. This was a five dollar lunch that I liked better than any of the more expensive restaurants we ate at in Florence.\n\nRome\n\nOverall, we ate very well in Rome. It was still hit or miss, but there were some very solid hits.\n\nYou can throw a baseball and hit a good gelato joint, but I would recommend going out of your way to hit Gelateria Fassi, which was probably the best gelato we had the whole trip and is in a lovely building with very high ceilings (thanks to Sara Protasi for this rec). For a cheap bite, the ubiquitous pizza al taglio is generally very good (our favorites were hot slices at the crowded Roscioli bakery and the cold burrata-broccoli at the comparably crowded Il Forno Campo de’ Fiori). Suppli are consistently good, but heavily dependent on freshness. My favorite by far were at Suppli Roma, but they were much better piping hot on a busy Saturday than they were midweek, when they have a chance to sit around and cool down. Lots of places do a carbonara suppli, but here they actually put an entire yolk in the middle. And they offer a variation of cacio e pepe with candied lemon peel, which I much preferred to the unadorned version. Also would highly recommend Testaccio Market, where you’ll find clustered together a very nice cheese counter, a couple pizza al taglio places and the famous, unmissable panini place Mordi e Vai.\n\nAnother major highlight, which you absolutely should not miss, Is Love – Specialty Croissants. They are (believe it or not) very close to the Vatican Museum, and it would be sheer folly not to stop on the way there. They have exquisite Italian and French pastries—as good as I’ve had anywhere—and also world class espresso. Try the single origin espressos. They are so well-prepared that I stayed and ordered every single one of them (pleasing the barista greatly). Most of the espresso you’ll find across Italy is low quality and burnt, but along with this standout spot I also had terrific espresso at Marigold (thanks, Autumn) in Rome and a very good pourover at Ditta Artiginale in Florence (thanks again, Autumn).\n\nWe had a bunch of sit-down meals in Rome, and I would recommend two places highly:\n\nSantoPalato\n\nI almost skipped this because I was skeptical of the “updated classics” concept. Very glad I didn’t because this was some of the most thoughtful food I’ve had in a long time. I loved everything we were served except my rigatoni with goat ragu. The ragu was boring and the rigatoni was considerably more al dente than I prefer. Angela’s pasta e fagioli, on the other hand, was exquisite— easily the best version of this dish I’ve ever had, with a rich, complex broth and perfectly cooked pasta and beans. The pigeon dish was a masterpiece, and the only time in Italy I was served a pickle as an accompaniment to a main course. The breast was served rare with hazelnuts, jus, and pickled pumpkin, while the leg was served on a purée of sweet pumpkin and topped with a purée of the organs. There was also a strange and delicious breaded meatball of braised oxtail with a sauce of peanuts and lovage. I realized too late that they are famous for their carbonara, but it’s made with the same rigatoni that I found undercooked and the woman at the table next to us seemed disinclined to finish hers. It’s a great restaurant overall, and you should certainly make a reservation if you visit Rome.\n\nLa Tavernaccia Da Bruno\n\nThis place is a little off the beaten path and not cheap, but it’s reachable by bus and it’s great. It’s more as traditional than SantoPalato, and everything they served us was excellent. The menu was thoughtful and I overheard the servers steering other tables towards bright, acidic contorni to balance the meaty secondi. We had a beautiful orange and fennel salad alongside a juicy hunk of suckling pig. The pasta alla gricia was stunning, and probably my favorite pasta of the whole trip.\n\nNapoli\n\nSweet, sweet Napoli. This is clearly one of the greatest food cities in the world. The pizza is so good and inexpensive and there are so many world-class pizzerias that we didn’t eat much else for dinner (I tried some fritto misto but wasn’t as enamored), though I would certainly recommend hitting a trattoria in the bustling Spanish quarter on a busy Friday or Saturday night for the cultural experience. We ate at Trattoria da Concetta. The scialatielli ai fruiti di mare was exceptional, but otherwise the food was just OK. The vibe, however, was magnificent. The waiters all learned my name and yelled “Matthew! Welcome! This way!” when I got up to look for the restroom. The place was packed with loud Italian families who clapped and sang along with the several street musicians who came in and performed. It was a whole scene.\n\nBefore discussing pizza, I want to report on the other god-tier category in Napoli: sfogliatelle. You’ll find great pastry all over Italy, but Napoli is at another level. There are a large number of variations available but for my money you can’t beat the basics: sfogliatelle riccia and sfogliatelle frolla, served hot. Look for a sign that says “sfogliatelle calda” and ask if you aren’t sure. The hot ones are held in a warm oven so it’s not always clear whether they’re available. Right by the train station you can get top notch versions of both at Sfogliatelle Attanasio. Note that Google maps is very wrong about where this place is located. It’s on a narrow slant street around the corner from McDonalds with a red and white “SFOGLIATELLE CALDA” sign. You’re going to be tempted by the decorated sfogliatelle. Trust me, they are not as good. The custard topping is too sweet and the cherries aren’t sour enough to balance it out. You lose a lot by letting them cool down. Stick to the basic hot variety. Both riccia and frolla are filled with a mixture of ricotta, semolina, sugar, cinammon, and citrus peel (usually orange, sometimes lemon). Frolla has a firm shortcrust, while riccia is like a laminated triangle with brittle, crispy layers. I wouldn’t want to part with either. The cinammon can be a little aggressive but usually it’s nicely balanced. I can’t remember which was which, but Mary’s Sfogliatelle did one with orange and very agressive cinnamon and one with milder spice and lemon.\n\nThe other pastry that blew me away in Napoli is called fiocchi di neve. You’ll find it here and there, but the original and by far the best version I tried is from Pasticceria Poppella. It’s an airy, soft yeast-risen bun filled with a light whipped ricotta cream. They do get soggy if you let them sit, so I would suggest just housing them right there in the street outside the bakery. There are also delicious pistachio and chocolate varieties, but the slightly savory original ricotta version is perfection.\n\nIt’s also very worth trying baba, which is pretty similar at most places. It’s a cake that’s been soaked with a rum syrup. I was hesitant to try it, as I do not consume alcohol, but I saw little kids eating it and decided to order a mini one to sample. The rum syrup is boiled thoroughly enough that I didn’t detect any hint of ethyl alcohol. Take care if this is something you’re sensitive to, but I found them very delicious.\n\nSo… about that pizza. I kind of went nuts on pizza. You may be familiar with this ranking: https://www.50toppizza.it/\n\nI generally don’t put much stock in this kind of thing and actively avoid Michelin recommendations unless corroborated by a more trusted source, but this ranking is extremely legit. The good news is that you don’t have to go to Europe to try some of the best pizza in the world. I can confirm first hand that Una Pizza Napoletana in NYC is right up there. It’s a slightly different style than anything I had in Italy; the dough is softer and fluffier, more of a steamed texture, and it has more of a sourdough tang. But hot damn it is excellent. The downsides are that it is extremely hard to get in and you have to share space with some of the worst people in the world. This is the pizza place repeatedly featured on Billions, and it is indeed popular with hedge fund types who have their assistants secure reservations for them or stand on line for a walk in table. I found it impossible to get a four-top reservation (believe me, I tried), and the only way to get a two-top was to spam refresh and book a table within seconds of it becoming available (7am eastern time, I think a month out but I don’t recall exactly). It is possible to walk in but you have to be early. Still, it’s worth it.\n\nIn Italy I ate at: I Masanielli di Francesco Martucci, I Masanielli di Sasà Martucci, Diego Vitagliano (Bagnoli), Diego Vitagliano (Santa Lucia), Seu Pizza Illuminati (Rome), 50 Kalò (Napoli), Pizzeria Salvo, and Starita. They were all very good or better. One thing that I found interesting is that every menu has a range of very crispy deep fried options (sometimes stuffed, sometimes sparsely topped—“montanara”-style) that seemed quite popular with locals. Setting aside the fried category, most margherita and marinara pizzas are soupy in the middle (as one expects) but at the very high end places a noticeable effort has been made to protect the light crispness of the crust all the way to the center. (Note that even at these “high end” places a margherita pizza is still around 8 bucks).\n\nI thought about ordering margherita pizzas everywhere to enable an apples-to-apples comparison, but in the end I decided to just order what I wanted to eat, because it seemed silly to limit myself to such a narrow perspective on the category for the sake of comparison. So, I can’t exactly rank these pizzerias, but I can divide them into tiers. I mostly agree with the pizza ranking above, though I did find Seu Pizza Illuminati a bit less impressive than they did. One note, however is that all of these places serve deep fried pasta as an appetizer, and Seu Pizza Illuminati had by far my favorite fried pasta: squid ink lasagna with squid meat. There was actually a pretty clear inverse relationship between the fried pasta and the pizza. My favorite pizza places had my least favorite fried pastas, for the most part.\n\nTop tier: I Masanielli di Francesco Martucci, Diego Vitagliano (especially the Bagnoli location).\n\nMost of the high-end places offer a tasting menu, which is generally a bad value, but it lets you try a larger array of pizzas. The only place I went for it was I Masanielli di Francesco Martucci, where you also get a few slices that are not on the regular menu. It was truly great, and the service was handled very well. They sat the two tables having the tasting menu directly next to the kitchen, so pies could be divided and immediately served at the correct temperature.\n\nI would also include NYC’s Una Pizza Napoletana in this tier, with the caveat that the vibe is much worse. The other Diego Vitagliano location was comparable to Bagnoli food-wise, but the vibe was not as good.\n\nNot far behind, I’d put 50 Kalò. I have no idea about the London or Rome locations, but the one in Napoli had a really nice sourdough tang (more so than any of the other places in Italy) and was overall delightful. It’s a bit annoying to get in and the service is impersonal and rushed (as one expects from places mentioned in recent Michelin guides), but I wouldn’t miss it.\n\nI’m the lower tier, still very good but not quite as exceptional, I would include Sasà Martucci – Pizzeria I Masanielli (which lacked the thoughtful balance and textural contrast of the pies at his brother’s nearby restaurant and had a much less appealing vibe, but did have similarly great crust), Pizzeria Salvo (with nine margherita pizzas on the menu, it’s a little precious for me… the pizza is good but extra soupy and the vibe is pretty bad—in a huge, mostly empty restaurant on a Tuesday evening they sat us two feet from two salesmen having a business dinner and we had to endure every word of their conversation), Starita (more of an old school place—go on the weekend for an incredible vibe but prepare to wait up to an hour to get in), and Seu Pizza Illuminati (crust a little boring, margherita too soupy, fancier options have too many elements not quite singing in perfect harmony).\n\nAs a final note, I would mention the local gelato chain Mennella in Napoli. It competes with Fassi in Rome for my favorite of the trip. The texture is at the ideal level of softness and the rich dark chocolate flavor was especially mind-blowing.\n\nI’ve lapsed on updating Strohltopia this year, because I’ve had too much on my plate and I haven’t had much spare time that I felt like spending in front of a computer. A request came in for streaming recommendations, however, and of course I am at your service. As usual, I’ll try to highlight some better known options that I think are due another look alongside more obscure titles.\n\nAmazon Prime\n\nTough Guys Don’t Dance (Norman Mailer, 1987)\n\nFor me this is one of the greatest neo-noirs, an extravagantly lurid, riotously funny hothouse fable of fallen machismo that Mailer shot in and around his own beach house in Provincetown. It’s best known for an unfortunate meme that takes an exaggerated bit of dialogue out of context (“oh god oh man oh god oh man….), but reducing the movie to an object of mockery in this way is sheer philistinism. The meme bit doesn’t even rank as one of the top 10 most remarkable scenes. NB, this features an all-timer Wings Hauser performance (the featured image for this post). Tough Guys Don’t Dance is one of my favorite American films of the 80’s.\n\nAvanti! (Billy Wilder, 1972)\n\nUnderseen late Billy Wilder. Nice and long, packed with incredible location work, alternately brash and romantic, full of life but never sentimental: it’s something you should absolutely see if you have a liking for Wilder or late style in general. It has screwball energy that reminds me of Chaplin’s A Countess from Hong Kong (high praise). Jack Lemmon is at his best as he walks the tightrope of playing a very unlikable character who one is happy to see find love.\n\nRunaway Train ( Andrei Konchalovsky, 1985)\n\nThe most undeniable Cannon group action film, featuring peak performances from John Voight and Eric Roberts and based on an unproduced Akira Kurosawa screenplay. It cooks, and I recommend it without qualification to anyone who hasn’t seen it. Even if you don’t think of yourself as someone who likes 80’s action movies, this one deserves a chance.\n\nThe Covenant (Guy Ritchie, 2023)\n\nIt’s been a minute since we’ve gotten a movie this good about courage and honor and men who live by a code. Guy Ritchie has gone drone happy, and it really makes the terrain come alive. Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim both give performances I can feel in my bones. One of my favorite movies of the current year.\n\nEye of the Beholder (Steven Elliot, 1999)\n\nA maligned and neglected thriller that deserves to be rediscovered and cherished. It’s one of a kind: a nearly pure psychoanalytic abstraction, where we learn almost nothing about the main characters for the first hour. They are like embodied drives, ricocheting around every corner of the US through insane snow globe transitions. Nothing ever seems quite real, as though we are trapped in McGregor’s liminal consciousness and Eros and Thanatos have control of the wheel.\n\nNetflix\n\nHow Do You Know (James L. Brooks, 2010)\n\nAn underappreciated masterpiece about the joy of shedding an old identity to make way for a new one. It includes Jack Nicholson’s final screen performance, which goes out on the absolutely perfect note.\n\nDil Se.. (Mani Ratnam, 1998)\n\nThe best thing about Netflix is that it has a large and well-curated selection of Indian films, which until the recent wave of interest provoked by RRR were among the most consistently neglected by American cinephiles. I include myself in that statement. Indian cinema is such a massive constellation that I’ve found it intimidating to approach. This last year I’ve tried to just dive in and explore a good mix of received classics and more outré selections. This is a well-regarded 90’s classic, and it’s something that people without much context in Indian cinema should have an easy time getting into. It’s a big, bold movie with delirious style, romance, mystery, and violence seeping out of every pore.\n\nEega (S.S. Rajamouli, 2012)\n\nSpeaking of RRR, this is one of Rajamouli’s earlier films and an easy slam dunk recommendation. Basically everyone would like this. You might think that a 2 hour 15 minute movie about a guy getting reincarnated as a fly and then seeking revenge would wear out its welcome, but you’d be wrong. Rarely has a movie been so committed to a bonkers high concept premise.\n\nBulbbul (Anvita Dutt, 2020)\n\nAnother title from India, but this time a smaller art horror film. West Bengal Gothic. A rape revenge movie that harkens back to Female Prisoner 701: Scorpion in that it treats the genre as an origin story for the spirit of feminine revenge. Gorgeous, haunted images throughout.\n\nHulu\n\nDamsels in Distress (Whit Stillman, 2011)\n\nOne of the funniest movies of the last 15 years and my favorite Greta Gerwig performance by a country mile. It has been absent from streaming for a long time, so get it while the getting’s good.\n\nPunisher: War Zone (Lexi Alexander, 2008)\n\nMy favorite 21st century superhero movie. It’s the anti-Disney Marvel movie, and it shows us what the genre can do when someone steps in and makes an action movie for adults that shirks the excruciating imperative to do preliminary marketing for 20 forthcoming franchise movies. Lexi Alexander’s direction is exuberantly brutal.\n\nSister of the Groom (Amy Miller Gross, 2020)\n\nLatter day Alicia Silverstone is a new frontier for me, but so far it’s been highly rewarding to explore. This is not for everyone! It’s baggy and abrasive, and doesn’t even try to reign in its narrative chaos. But it’s also the kind of fully sincere low budget production that viewers with a taste for unconventional genre fare need to see. Someone really cared about this, you can tell, and Silverstone lays it all out there. Her performance is over the top, but also vulnerable. I’m hooked, and I’ll watch anything she does in this zone.\n\nSex Appeal (Talia Osteen, 2022)\n\nDTV romcom/sex movie about a neurotic, over-achieving STEM student who discovers sexual pleasure and falls in love, but not with the guy she expected. Lots of imagination: female pleaure is repeatedly rendered through Esther Williams homage, which is a fun surprise in a 2022 DTV romcom. This is also not for everyone, but I consider it ideal late night viewing.\n\nMAX\n\nBrigadoon (Vincente Minnelli, 1954)\n\nGene Kelly and Cyd Charisse: you can’t go wrong. A very beautiful picture about wanting to stay and live in the world of the movies. One of my favorite Minnellis.\n\nThe Rage: Carrie 2 (Katt Shea, 1999)\n\nI neglected this for a long time because I assumed it would be infuriating. I couldn’t have been more wrong. It’s about as good as a Carrie sequel could possibly be, and I regret that I haven’t been watching it every couple of years this whole time. It is very much a highschool movie of its own era, just as Carrie was, and it even makes contact with the 90’s slasher revival cycle. It’s also recognizably a Carrie movie, but the key is that it’s not simply another movie about a girl with telekinesis who gets bullied. It does have plenty of mean kid venom, and it’s wicked and lurid in a De Palma-esque way, but it’s doing its own thing. This is one of the few legacy sequels to go out of its way not to rehash the original beyond some judicious callbacks and a broader thematic relationship. It really feels more like Carrie in its formal dimension than anywhere else. Shea’s use of rack focus is particularly fitting, and very impressive.\n\nSpecies 2 (Peter Medak, 1998)\n\nMuch, much sleazier than the very sleazy original. If you want kinky alien stuff, this is your movie.\n\nWe continue our family tradition of Academy Awards counter-programming. Josh and Izzy are busy this weekend celebrating my niece’s 5th birthday, but they still managed to send me lists, and I even got comments from Josh for his top ten. I went with a top 15 for myself, and Angela and Izzy both wanted to stick with ten. It wasn’t the best year in film for me, but the high points were high.\n\nMatt Strohl\n\n15) Benediction (Davies)\n\nThe flipside of A Quiet Passion, swapping one sort of gendered quiet desperation for another. It’s a melancholy late film that uses biographical form to reflect more generally on the way our lives only become legible to us in retrospect.\n\n14) Pacifiction (Serra)\n\nI find this more interesting as a Serra text than a post-colonial inquiry. Magimel was fed dialogue through an earpiece, so that he had to think on his feet within a scene, and extraneous cameras were set up so that the actors wouldn’t know which one to play to. The story is indeterminate all the way down: even Serra didn’t know who is ultimately on which side and who is or isn’t a spy. His chaotic artistic methodology is mirrored by Magimel’s character, who struts around intervening in inscrutable ways in an inscrutable situation.\n\n13) Il Buco (Frammartino)\n\nAnother work of lyrical minimalism from Frammartino. It’s a mostly wordless depiction of the 1961 expedition that reached the bottom of a 700-meter deep cave in Calabria. The magnificent soundscape surrounds the viewer with drips and sloshes that become hypnotic as we venture deeper and deeper into the abyss.\n\n12) The Munsters (Zombie)\n\nIn an era when commercial films have become synonymous with soulless recycled IP, Rob Zombie took studio money and corporate IP and used it to make a vibrant, goofy love letter to his wife. You won’t find a contemporary studio release with a purer heart.\n\n11) Down with the King (Ongaro)\n\nA standout American indie. It may be the first hip hop pastoral, and it shows remarkable restraint in the way it allows Gibbs’ internal conflicts to structure the film and doesn’t pack in unnecessary incident.\n\n10) Introduction (Hong)\n\nLike The Woman Who Ran, this is a brisk triptych that might look slight at first glance, but once you start digging, you find such a dense structure that it demands a second viewing. Notice, for instance, the way each segment features a prominent embrace, but each has a notably different posture. Taken together, these three embraces summarize the film as a whole.\n\n9) Fabian: Going to the Dogs (Graf)\n\nThe film of a free man. Comparisons to early Von Trier are inevitable, but my preferred point of reference is the first half of Vincere. Gorgeous digital textures give Fabian a pervasively modern feel, which plays well with the parallels it finds between the Weimar period and the present.\n\n8) Thirteen Lives (Howard)\n\nAn outstanding procedural about professionals doing a difficult job. I also thought Rush was very good, so between these two movies I’m coming around to an idea of a late Ron Howard cycle about the best in the world tackling the most severe challenges. I expected this to be sappy and sensationalistic, and I couldn’t have been more wrong. Mortensen and Farrell are terrific as tired middle-aged guys who have been doing this too long but accept there’s no one better to take the lead. The movie takes its time and studies their patient, systematic resolve. Its moral and emotional center runs deep, but it sticks with the nuts and bolts of the job. The digital photography is beautiful and effectively claustrophobic. All the lens flares and splashes don’t disrupt the film’s immersive quality but rather enhance it, as we feel like the camera is in the fray of the action. Thanks in part to its vivid physicality, it towers above the weightless CGI spectacles clogging up theaters.\n\n7) Both Sides of the Blade (Denis)\n\nCharacteristically, Claire Denis’s films omit most of the connective tissue of their narratives. This does the opposite: it isolates the middle third of a narrative and stuffs it to the gills with detail. It’s very thorny (how many movies that are primarily about a love triangle between three white people remind you to think about Fanon?), and doesn’t give itself over readily. I’m struck by the way Juliette Binoche portrays the kind of deception that doesn’t feel deceptive to the person perpetrating it, because the emotions behind it are honest. She conveys a divided self without the usual sort of histrionic pathology. Lindon gets to really sink his teeth into this one, and of course he delivers. It’s great to see Bulle Ogier, who holds down a delicate role.\n\n6) The Novelist’s Film (Hong)\n\nA wonderful Hongian ourobouros, where the subject of an artist retreating to a more personal form of expression becomes the occasion for a film that does the very same thing.\n\n5) Dark Glasses (Argento)\n\nIf Argento’s received classics are grand operas of fear, this is a late-career piano sonata. It’s essentially a series of digital giallo abstractions in different sensory modalities, but it also reprises his career-spanning affection for outcasts and is in the running for his most warm-hearted movie.\n\n4) Crimes of the Future (Cronenberg)\n\nThis is unmistakably part of what we might call Cronenberg’s technology cycle. Arguably, the central theme of this cycle is the blurring of the line between self and technology. Someone who uses a tool every day may start to feel as though the tool is an extension of their body. Ubiquitous smartphones and search engines are in some sense an extension of our cognitive faculties. It’s just an ordinary, entirely routine stage of thinking to do searches on one’s phone. The possibility of not being able to remember or find out some fact is largely gone from the world, because we can always just look it up.\n\nIn the case of a prosthetic limb, the integration of a technological device into the self is very intuitive. Cronenberg is interested in finding the same kind of literal and direct representations of a broader range of ways that technology and the self interrelate. So much of the imagery he developed in Videodrome, eXistenZ, and other films recurs here, but now as a kind of summative statement at the end of the world (or, the leap into the transhuman). But this is also a widower film, and as such it is nowhere near as cold as its subject matter might lead one to expect. It’s the year’s greatest love story.\n\n3) Dead for a Dollar (Hill)\n\nThe closest thing we’ve seen to the great B westerns of the 50’s in a very long time. Hill dedicated it to Budd Boetticher, but Filipe Furtado is right to point out that it’s closer to the cycle of films that Randolph Scott made with André De Toth. Its greatness is bound up with Hill’s insight into the ways that old forms both can and cannot be resurrected. It slips between the Scylla of nostalgia and the Charybdis of topical revisionism, delivering something that is authentic to the present in a way that parallels the relationship between the films of artists like Boetticher and De Toth and their own era.\n\n2) Limbo (Cheang)\n\nLimbo has the most intricate mise-en-scène of any new film I saw this year, and it is built almost entirely out of garbage. A post-handover Hong Kong death rattle, the likes of which we have never seen before and may never seen again.\n\n1) Stars at Noon (Denis)\n\nLike Both Sides of the Blade, Stars at Noon gives us the intact core of a narrative and leaves ellipses around the edges. It’s all about following Margaret Qualley through liminal spaces (which even include the “home” space of her hotel room, always positioned as a place she’s trying to leave). It’s important that the film stays with her, just as stuck as she is. She’s the feminine noir figure made protagonist, mystique replaced with sticky, sweaty tangibility. She reminds me strongly of Juliet Berto in Out 1, prowling like a cat through alleys and hotel lobbies. Here, the malaise of the post-May ‘68 counterculture is swapped for Latin American political purgatory, which takes on a surreal character as events resembling the 20th century Nicaraguan Revolution are set in the present (covid masks and all). I like the casting of Joe Alwyn. I know Denis wanted Pattinson, but he would have been too much of a presence. Alwyn is a mannequin for Qualley to play off of, and that’s what the movie needs. He’s far more pathetic than Pattinson could have managed, and it works. It’s her movie, and she turns in the performance of the year.\n\nAngela Shope\n\n10) Elvis (Luhrmann)\n\nI don’t care for the musical biopic in general, but the combination of Luhrmann’s propulsive style and Butler’s charismatic energy is thrilling.\n\n9) The Whale (Aronofsky)\n\nThis movie offers such a strange cocktail of cruelty and empathy. It’s not an element that many people are talking about, but I was deeply moved by the thorny father-daughter relationship, and watching this was cathartic for me.\n\n8) Three Thousand Years of Longing (Miller)\n\nStories about stories. Every movie that made me cry this year made my list, and this was one of them. The chemistry between Elba and Swinton is magical and I was excited by the way Miller moves through history.\n\n7) Thirteen Lives (Howard)\n\nThe emphasis on community organization and massive coordination of effort warms the heart without becoming overly sentimental. It’s an absolute nail-biter and I could have kept watching it for hours.\n\n6) Aftersun (Wells)\n\nAnother vexed father-daughter movie that moved me. I watched it twice. The intimacy between the two actors is something rare and special. The first time, I naturally connected with Sophie, who reminds me very much of myself at that age, but the second time I connected more closely with her dad, which speaks to the emotional richness of the film as a whole.\n\n5) Eo (Skolimowski)\n\nI love Eo, because he’s just a sweet little donkey going through the world alone. He’s an uncorrupted little angel donkey and I love him.\n\n4) Blonde (Dominik)\n\nI avoided reading anything about this before watching it, and I was surprised when Matt told me that internet feminists hate it. I found that it very effectively crystalizes my experiences as a woman living in a world full of disgusting men. Ana de Armas is great and the way Dominik films her is often beautiful.\n\n3) Dark Glasses (Argento)\n\nI was so happy to see a new one from the maestro, and I’m not at all surprised that it’s fantastic. It’s a gift.\n\n2) Deep Water (Lyne)\n\nSexy! I love Ana de Armas’ treacherously seductive outfits in this and would wear every single one of them.\n\n1) The Northman (Eggers)\n\nMatt somehow got me into viking metal, and this is the cinematic equivalent. A bloody fairy tale that creates a strange world I keep wanting to return to.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Menu, Prey, Ambulance.\n\nJosh Strohl\n\n25) Kimi (Soderbergh)\n\n24) In Front of Your Face (Hong)\n\n23) Nope (Peele)\n\n22) Confess, Fletch (Mottola)\n\n21) Three Thousand Years of Longing (Miller)\n\n20) Halloween Ends (Green)\n\n19) Moonfall (Emmerich)\n\n18) RRR (Rajamouli)\n\n17) The Munsters (Zombie)\n\n16) Elvis (Luhrmann)\n\n15) Top Gun: Maverick (Kosinski)\n\n14) Both Sides of the Blade (Denis)\n\n13) Armageddon Time (Grey)\n\n12) Benediction (Davies)\n\n11) Apollo 10 1/2 (Linklater)\n\n10) Ambulance (Bay)\n\nIt was hard to get my ass to the theater this year with two little kids at home, but you better believe I made it to this. It’s finally a Michael Bay movie that people feel like they’re allowed to like, but I’ve always been a true believer. It rips.\n\n9) Decision to Leave (Park)\n\nA truly modern noir. Intricate plot mechanics function to deconstruct familiar tropes, but in a way that adds rather than subtracts emotional weight.\n\n8) Deep Water (Lyne)\n\nAdrian Lyne is underappreciated as a master of the erotic thriller. This is in freaky-deaky Ben Affleck cuck territory, with Ana de Armas absolutely tearing up the screen. This story has been told before, but this version is wildly unpredictably in its details.\n\n7) Dark Glasses (Argento)\n\nThe maestro revisits familiar ideas from across his career, but flips them on their head by taking the perspective of the victim more fully than he ever has before.\n\n6) Limbo (Cheang)\n\nThere’s nothing else like it. People use the word “visionary” too lightly, but this movie demands it. Nightmarish images in stark black and white that feel completely alien, like they’re from another universe.\n\n5) Stars at Noon (Denis)\n\nAlmost impossible to blurb, because the emotions it evoked in me are difficult to articulate. I felt lost in it, like I was drifting along in a sad romantic song.\n\n4) Thirteen Lives (Howard)\n\nI didn’t know Ron Howard had this in him, but he reveals himself here as a true picture maker. Immediate, immersive, and intense.\n\n3) Dead for a Dollar (Hill)\n\nLike The Outlaw Josey Wales, it unites a band of outsiders who are deprived of agency by the dominant power structures of the time and connects their story with contemporary political concerns. Stripped down, unpretentious, and made on the cheap, but with the chops of an all-time master.\n\n2) The Fabelmans (Spielberg)\n\nOur greatest pop filmmaker rips open a psychic gash and spills out his mommy issues for all to see.\n\n1) Crimes of the Future (Cronenberg)\n\nNot just my favorite of the year, but the best new release I’ve seen in a decade. After waiting so long for a new Cronenberg film, it arrived as a glorious summation of the career of a great master. It’s a surprisingly tender movie that scrambles the audience’s responses to body horror by rendering it as an act of connection and creation.\n\nIsabel Strohl\n\n10) The Whale (Aronofsky)\n\n9) RRR (Rajamouli)\n\n8) Thirteen Lives (Howard)\n\n7) Ambulance (Bay)\n\n6) Crimes of the Future (Cronenberg)\n\n5) Kimi (Soderbergh)\n\n4) Elvis (Luhrmann)\n\n3) Dark Glasses (Argento)\n\n2) Top Gun: Maverick (Kosinksi)\n\n1) The Fabelmans (Spielberg)\n\nFeatured image from City of the Dead.\n\nIt is upon us. I’ve tried to include something for everyone: deep cuts for horror fans and entry-level selections for people who aren’t as keen on the genre. The gruel is getting thinner every year on the generalist services, so I highly recommend getting Shudder at least for the month. Their selection far outpaces all of the other pay services combined. The other option is Tubi, which is free and stacked with options, but plays movies with commercial breaks. I love Tubi but do not normally include it for this reason, and because half the fun of Tubi is browsing through their vast library and trying out stuff you’ve never heard of. This time I did pick out a couple Tubi selections. Criterion Channel also has a terrific horror feature, but there’s no reason to make recommendations, since it’s all worth watching and the curators have already supplied context to help you decide what you’re interested in.\n\nShudder\n\nThe Whip and the Body\n\nThere’s a trove of Mario Bava on Shudder and all of it is eminently worthwhile, but if I had to pick one title, it would be this. Gothic kink, with Christopher Lee, trap doors, secret passages, perverse secrets.\n\nEyes of Fire\n\nA singular film that belongs in the highest pantheon of American horror. It was finally restored and released on blu-ray last year, which was its first home video release since a 1987 VHS. It’s set in 1750 and tells the story of an adulterous preacher and a small group of followers who are banished from their settlement and try to found a new one in Shawnee territory, where they encounter ancient magic. Strange and oneiric, it’s stylistically unique and full of images that have haunted that back of my mind since I first saw it last year.\n\nCity of the Dead\n\nAlso known as Hotel Horror, starring Christopher Lee, this is one of the finest horror films of the 60’s and absolutely essential viewing. A college student visits a New England town to research its history of witchcraft. It does not go well.\n\nAlison’s Birthday\n\nAnother excellent example of folk horror, this has a fairly typical narrative about an unsuspecting young girl and a secret occult group who have devious plans for her birthday, but it is elevated above the pack by its briskly inexorable pacing, unnerving imagination, and unusual Australian setting.\n\nBlood Beat\n\nOne of a kind bonkers Wisconsin regional horror from French director Fabrice A. Zaphiratos, centered around a family gathering and a set of haunted samurai armor. When you put this on you may feel like, “what the hell am I watching right now? why the hell would he recommend this?” but stick with it and you’ll see.\n\nWhat Have You Done to Solange?\n\nNot for everyone! This is an exceptionally sleazy giallo! All content warnings apply! Fabio Testi plays a teacher who is sleeping with one of his students and becomes a suspect in a series of campus murders. If you have an appetite for ’70s Italian sleaze, this is a delicacy.\n\nKriya\n\nUnique and mesmerizing art horror from New Dehli, directed by Sidharth Srinivasan. It’s dense and disorienting, borrowing tropes from the possession horror subgenre to examine a collision between modernity and tradition.\n\nIntruder\n\nSupermarket slasher, it just plain rules.\n\nDark August\n\nExceptional Vermont regional horror, a prime example of slow burn autumnal dread.\n\nHack-O-Lantern\n\nOften taken under the “so bad it’s good” heading, do with it what you will. It’s a wild ride, full of satanic panic .\n\nFangs\n\nThis is a hoot and I highly recommend it to anyone with a taste for regional horror. Set in Texas, it’s about an old snake-loving coot named Snakey Bender who likes to come into town on Wednesdays and carry out his routine… until a group of uptight conservatives conspire against him.\n\nEvilspeak\n\nArguably the peak of the “evil computer” cycle, it’s basically a male Carrie with an evil computer.\n\nMalatesta’s Carnival of Blood\n\nAnother great example of regional horror (Pennsylvania), it’s about a family searching for a son who’s gone missing at an amusement park and uncovering more than they bargained for. It’s only 75 minutes long but dense with memorable images. There’s really nothing else like this, and genre fans shouldn’t miss it.\n\nThe Corruption of Chris Miller\n\nSleazy Spanish giallo with Jean Seberg, it’s a great place to take your genre exploration once you’ve made your way through its more famous Italian counterparts.\n\nPledge Night\n\nI am genuinely amazed by how many divergent 80’s tropes come together in this movie. The practical effects are great.\n\nTubi\n\nBeyond the Darkness\n\nOne of the wildest and most enjoyable films from world-historic sicko Joe D’Amato. It is one crazy psychosexual stew, and I’m only recommending it to people who set no limit on depravity. (Edit: I think this is also on shudder)\n\nHellhole\n\nI’ve explored the women in prison exploitation subgenre pretty thoroughly, and at a certain point they all start blending together. This one, however, stands out. It’s really one of the only under the radar examples of the category that I’d go out of my way to recommend, and probably the one that does the best job integrating horror elements. It’s certainly not for everyone, though. It is, after all, a women in prison movie called “Hellhole.”\n\nAmazon Prime\n\nGrave of the Vampire\n\nJohn Hayes is the king of the “bad dad” low budget horror movie. It’s an atmospheric slow burn, nasty and depressing, and a far, far bleaker and more affecting take on family than any of the trendy recent examples with a more discursive approach.\n\nDeranged\n\nThis preceded Texas Chainsaw as an Ed Gein movie. I’m not a fan of the true crime framing, but this is a must-see for Roberts Blossom’s extraordinary performance.\n\nEvil Dead Trap\n\nKitchen sink 80’s Japanese slasher mayhem from Ikeda.\n\nThe Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism\n\nA 1967 German Christopher Lee vehicle, the sets alone make it worth seeing for anyone with a taste for this sort of Hammer-esque production.\n\nNetflix\n\nHubie Halloween-The Munsters\n\nNetflix may not have much in the way of horror, but they DO have the best feel-good Halloween double feature in the business. I love both of these movies with my whole heart. Hubie is one of Sandler’s very best, full of the warmth and sense of fun that make his movies such enduring comfort classics. The Munsters is the rarest of all contemporary movie sightings: a studio IP picture with personality and a unique stylistic sensibility. It’s Rob Zombie’s own love story with Sheri Moon, very thinly veiled, and it’s silly and hilarious and overflowing with affection. It’s only for people who like fun, though!\n\nPiranha\n\nAja’s remake of Joe Dante’s classic is a trashy good time.\n\nVampires\n\nBy far John Carpenter’s meanest, nastiest movie, it’s not for everyone, but amidst the marshmallow Netflix slate it certainly stands out.\n\nHulu\n\nUrban Legend trilogy\n\nJamie Blanks’ original is great, and I enjoy the whole trilogy (although many people view the third one a lot less favorably than I do). Outside of Scream, Urban Legend is arguably the highlight of the slasher revival. I watched these last year and I’m already feeling like I might dive back in.\n\nHBO Max\n\nEmpty Man\n\nUnusual amidst the contemporary horror landscape, this 2020 film is 138 minutes long and uses its duration to develop an overwhelming sense of dread. It’s a deliberately paced procedural that effectively coaxes us to imagine what’s out of sight.\n\nThe Fly II\n\nThis is a lot of fun and has surprising pathos given how much slime is involved.\n\nAmityville 2: The Possession\n\nThe first one is not my favorite, so I never actually watched this until recently, but it’s far, far better (it’s directed by an Italian, which of course helps). The first hour is fun and depraved family horror. It then loses steam and becomes an Exorcist knock off, but it’s still worth seeing overall.\n\nExorcist II: The Heretic\n\nSpeaking of The Exorcist, Boorman’s sequel has a terrible reputation and frequently makes “worst of all time” lists, but that’s to be expected for something this defiant of the banalities of convention. It’s actually closer to Friedkin’s Sorcerer than The Exorcist in many ways, and doesn’t do anything like what fans of the original wanted it to do, much to its credit. If you’ve avoided it on account of its reputation but can manage an open mind, I’d suggest giving it a try.\n\nFeatured image from Shadow in the Cloud\n\nNetflix\n\nThis is the best Netflix crop in a while.\n\nBahubali: The Beginning and Bahubali: The Conclusion (Tamil language versions)\n\nI’m no expert here, but this was filmed in both Telegu and Tamil and my understanding is that while the Telegu version may be preferable (but not currently on Netflix), there’s nothing wrong with the Tamil version. I looked at a lower quality stream of the Telegu version online and it seemed to me that some actors are dubbed worse in that version, while other actors are dubbed worse in this version, and so there are trade-offs either way. In any case: these movies SLAP. You might describe them as Cecil B. DeMille meets Zack Snyder by way of Rajamouli’s very distinct imagination (with the outstanding music of M. M. Keeravani). The two films follow one continuous story, 5.5 hours long in total (and there’s apparently still a third one coming), and when we had to break it up over a couple days because of Angela’s work schedule, every minute we weren’t watching it I was dying to get back to it. It’s hard to think of a more entertaining movie. If you aren’t convinced by the first hour or so, stick with it (I can imagine the waterfall climbing musical number maybe losing some people– not me– but after that it’s hard to imagine anyone not getting into this). Peak action, and a clinic on how to use CGI to expand cinematic possibilities rather than to substitute for doing things the hard way .\n\nThe Professionals\n\nTerrific 1966 Richard Brooks men-on-a-mission western. The cast is hard to beat. Four mercenaries (Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan, Woody Strode, and Burt Lancaster!!!!) are sent to Mexico to retrieve Claudia Cardinale, the wife of oil tycoon Ralph Bellamy, who he claims has been taken against her will by Mexican revolutionary Jack Palance.\n\nCliffhanger\n\nOne of the last great action blockbusters shot without extensive use of green screens and CGI: this is Stallone and company up in the Dolomites for real, doing wild stunts in a hybrid Die Hard-scenario/sports movie. I went on Cinematic Underdogs podcast to talk about it not so long ago.\n\nBeast Stalker\n\nIt’s very cool that this showed up on Netflix. It’s a Dante Lam crime movie from 2008 and I think this is the first time it’s been available to stream in North America. If you are averse to children-in-peril movies, be warned: rarely have children been in more peril. It’s about a cop (Nicholas Tse) racked with guilt about a tragic accident who puts everything on the line to save a young girl who’s been kidnapped. His double/nemesis is Nick Cheung, also bearing scars and carrying a heavy burden. This is a great example of full tilt Hong Kong male melodrama: the emotions in this movie are enormous.\n\nDouble Team\n\nAbsolutely wild Tsui Hark/Van Damme/Dennis Rodman collaboration. Not for everyone, but certainly one of the most distinctive things you’re likely to find on Netflix.\n\nThe One\n\nBefore the current multiverse craze (which I am not at all a part of), there was The One. Jet Li plays a double role, first as a rogue agent who travels between dimensions to kill his counterparts to gain their power, and then also as LAPD cop who teams up with two Multiverse special agents (Delroy Lindo and Jason Statham) to stop him from becoming the One. It’s like a martial arts Highlander.\n\nThe Guns of Navarone\n\nOne of the great afternoon movies (and also one of the great dad movies): feast upon 158 minutes of men on a mission. Directed by J. Lee Thompson.\n\nHulu\n\nGhosts of Mars\n\nI won’t even say this is unfairly maligned, because that’s too generous: it’s inexplicably maligned. A John Carpenter Hawksian sci-fi horror western should not have been a tough sell, and yet… Anyways, it’s a great film, and one you should definitely see if you let its poor reception scare you off, or see again if you missed the boat the first time around. It’s dense with cinematic ideas and multiple viewings help.\n\nHunter Hunter\n\nI recommend going into this knowing as little as possible, but you should know that it is a very intense slow burn horror movie that many would find upsetting. The setup is that a family living off the grid starts to suspect that there’s a predator preying on human beings in the region.\n\nWe Own the Night\n\nI haven’t seen this in a long time myself and I plan to revisit it. James Gray is one of our greatest contemporary filmmakers and someone we should be doing everything we can to support in a time when movies for adults are in shorter and shorter supply. I recall this having a strong sense of setting (something Gray always excels at) and a successful balance between affecting drama and rich political context.\n\nOne Shot\n\nI’m not really a fan of the single-take gimmick genre, but this is a good version. It’s a straightforward Call of Duty run-and-shoot siege movie, but effectively immersive and with a typically exciting Scott Adkins performance at the center. Not to be missed for action fans.\n\nSense and Sensibility\n\nYou know, as literary adaptation period pieces go, Ang Lee’s Sense and Sensibility is really good, thanks in no small part to Alan Rickman.\n\nThat’s My Boy\n\nNot for everyone. One of the more extreme Sandler films and it’s probably over the limit for a lot of people, but I fully agree with B.A. Radetski’s contentious letterboxd review: a better film about class than Parasite.\n\nShadow in the Cloud\n\nPaul from Cinematic Underdogs podcast was reading my book in a hotel lobby and ended up explaining the main ideas to the receptionist, who recommended this movie in response. He passed the recommendation on to me, and that’s of course a recommendation I’m going to take! Glad I did. This thing is bonkers! There’s no irony here and no winking self-awareness. It’s like five movies at once, and it’s fully committed to being all of them. The mystery luggage bit is amazing.\n\nThe Requin\n\nThis is probably a bridge too far for most people, but for the boldest bad movie adventurers, this is some avant-garde shit. I mean, the premise is that Alicia Silverstone and her husband end up on a floating hotel room lost at sea. The CGI is extremely cheap, and the combination of ambitious high concept premise and painfully limited means is thrilling for me. You can absolutely tell at all times that she is standing on a soundstage, not a floating hotel room, and this just adds to the complete madness of her performance. If you have an upper-limit on Alicia Silverstone, this movie will exceed that limit. Despite the shark on the poster, there is not much shark. This is not a movie for shark horror fans so much as it is for the small niche of people who share the thought, “I want to see Alicia Silverstone go absolutely berserk for the full duration of a feature film.”\n\nAmazon Prime\n\nThe Train\n\nThis is not the first time I’ve recommended John Frankenheimer’s The Train, and it won’t be the last. A great action movie about French resistance fighters (including Burt Lancaster and Michel Simon) trying to stop a Nazi train carrying off the great masterpieces of French art at the end of the war. It powerfully engages the question of whether the preservation of culture can justify a loss of life.\n\nA Quiet Passion\n\nTerence Davies’ exquisite Emily Dickinson film is not a biopic of the usual (terrible) sort. It takes a creative approach and it’s funny and beautiful and thoroughly devastating.\n\nBliss\n\nI’ve recommended this before, but it was only on Shudder at the time. Not for everyone, but I love this. Don’t even think about watching it while the sun is out. You want to watch this late at night and as loud as possible. This is a drug-addled LA vampire fever dream in grimy 16mm. The sound design is out of control. The music is great across the board but the use of sludgy doom metal during the most intense scenes is especially inspired. People who didn’t watch the later seasons of Friday Night Lights are missing out, as one of the many joys this has to offer is that the edgy protagonist is played by the actress who played Becky Sproles. She just rules in this. And the practical effects!\n\nTurbulence\n\nIn honor of the late, great Ray Liotta, this is one of his many wonderful villain performances. It came out during the glut of 90’s airplane hijack movies, and the plot is pretty stripped down, but the Liotta performance is plenty to carry this. I thought while rewatching it recently that he understood as well as any actor how charisma and vileness can be two sides of the same coin. His performance is disturbing precisely because he’s so charismatic that you want to like him.\n\nThe Siege of Firebase Gloria\n\nPremium ‘Namsploitation from cult hero Brian Trenchard-Smith. I had this on my list as one of the most significant Wings Hauser movies I hadn’t seen, but thanks to Daniel Gorman for spreading the word that it showed up on streaming. It’s terrific for what it is. Wings and R. Lee Ermy are a supreme war movie duo, with Ermy playing it about like you’d expect (that is, a lot like Full Metal Jacket— though I like this movie better) and Wings at an intense dramatic pitch.\n\nEvil Dead Trap\n\nHappy to see this movie readily availabile in good quality in North America. Jam-packed 1988 Japanese industrial-complex-of-horrors slasher mayhem from Ikeda.\n\nHBO Max\n\nRevolver\n\nMy favorite Guy Ritchie movie (alongside Wrath of Man) and a truly gonzo genre experiment. I’m bringing it up because it contains one of my favorite Ray Liotta performances.\n\nPygmalion\n\nAt a trim 96 minutes, with Leslie Howard as Henry Higgins and Wendy Hiller as Eliza Doolittle, this is an incisive adaptation of Shaw’s play. It’s better than My Fair Lady, in my opinion.\n\nSweet Bird of Youth\n\nRichard Brooks does Tennessee Williams. A neglected movie that I’m very fond of. The hysterical desperation is overwhelming. The character of Heavenly gets almost no dialogue, but her series of self-contradictions and reversals is the emotional core that plays out quietly while Page and Newman burn up the screen with their tragic fallen egos.\n\nFeatured image from France.\n\nMatt Strohl\n\nWe are changing the format a little this year. My first year on Twitter has cured me of any urge to be negative, so instead of summing up everything I watched from 2021, I’m just going to focus on what I liked. I did pretty well seeing everything that I really wanted to see, although I didn’t get a chance to see either of the Hong movies (the rips circulating online are beneath my standards!), so those will be pushed to next year. The Woman Who Ran and Tsai’s Days I included last year. Anything that was released internationally during the last few years that I had no reasonable way to watch until this year was eligible.\n\n25) The Voyeurs (Michael Mohan)\n\nA glorious return to both the spirit and substance of the 90’s direct-to-video erotic thriller. The plotting is delectably ridiculous, and (unlike Netflix’s attempts at the genre) it doesn’t pull its punches.\n\n24) The Last Duel (Ridley Scott)\n\nConfidently paced and very engaging. The cast is great and everyone is at their best. Damon playing against type is potent, but the tastiest bit is Ben Affleck doing Guy Pearce (circa The Count of Monte Cristo). In an era when most studio pictures are shot in front of green screens and weighed down with dramatic bloat and marketing for future franchise entries, it’s a pleasure to see a big budget movie with actual production design and brisk dramatic efficiency. This goes hard.\n\n23) All Eyes Off Me (Hadas Ben Aroya)\n\nAn elusive tryptic, structured almost like a ronde, but instead of the pairings of lovers coming full circle, we return to the existential restlessness we began with. As Mike Thorn put it, this is “cinema of questioning rather than declaration.” It doesn’t leave us with a pat commentary on millennial relationships, but rather an unsettling collection of moments that are likely to resonate differently for each of us.\n\n22) Kriya (Sidharth Srinivasan)\n\nDense and disorienting. Ancient magic, mysterious rituals, innovative sequencing of light and dark. It’s very refreshing to see a horror movie that both engages with the genre and does something challenging that I haven’t seen before. It’s the real deal.\n\n21) New York Ninja (John Liu)\n\nAs a connoisseur of the ninja subgenre, I have to say bravo to Vinegar Syndrome for rescuing this. John Liu filmed it in 1984, but the production was abandoned and the film was not edited or released. Vinegar Syndrome saw the value of the materials and assembled it into a pretty darn coherent movie (the lingering incoherencies work just fine with the B movie trappings). All original audio was lost, so they had to record an entirely new audio track. This could have been a disaster, as it’s so easy for dubbing to come across as self-parody, but they did an *incredible* job casting beloved B movie actors. Don “The Dragon” Wilson is delightful in the lead, but it’s the great Michael Berryman who steals the show.\n\n20) The French Dispatch (Wes Anderson)\n\nThe further Wes Anderson pushes his idiosyncrasies, the more I like him. I don’t even really care about the subject matter here; this appeals to me plenty just taken as a gloriously uncompromised display of a singular point of view. My least favorite take is that only the first segment is good. It’s certainly the easiest to like, but it’s just an appetizer. The unapologetic density of the rest of the film is even more exciting.\n\n19) The Swordsman (Jae-Hoon Choi)\n\nOne of two movies I loved this year that combine aspects of Zatoichi and Taken. This is an eminently satisfying Korean swordplay movie with superb action.\n\n18) Don’t Breathe 2 (Rodo Sayagues)\n\nThe other Zatoichi-Taken movie on my list. This lacks the graceful martial arts of The Swordsman, but it delivers buckets of unflinching nastiness. I am very excited by (producer and writer) Fede Álvarez’s work in recent years. The way you can tell that he makes real exploitation movies is that they genuinely piss people off. I would especially highlight Fiona O’Shaughnessy’s character acting. She turns in one of my favorite performances of the year (it’s certainly my favorite that I have not seen a single other person mention).\n\n17) Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy (Ryusuke Hamaguchi)\n\nA riff on Rohmer’s Rendez-vous in Paris, this tryptic from Hamaguchi has an appealing balance between pointed oddness and searing poignancy. The three entries don’t neatly come together, and the tension between their affinity and incongruity makes the film more interesting than the sum of its parts.\n\n16) Drive My Car (Ryusuke Hamaguchi)\n\nI have only seen it once, but I expect that future viewings (in tandem with a rereading of Uncle Vanya) will reveal further riches. I greatly admire the unflinching sincerity of this film, and also the way it lets so much depend on connections with Chekhov that require a patient literary sensibility to unravel. This is arguably the least hip movie to achieve widespread critical success in recent memory, and I’ll count that as a win for film culture.\n\n15) French Exit (Azazel Jacobs)\n\nWhat can I say, I love French Exit. It’s bone dry and morbid. It appeals *immensely* to my own sense of humor, but I can imagine that it’s not for everyone. Michelle Pfieffer is god-tier. No one else could come close to doing this as well as she can. She’s approaching late Joan Crawford status here.\n\n14) Parallel Mothers (Pedro Almodóvar)\n\nFinished this with tears on my face. Almodóvar riles up our emotions with highly engaging melodrama and then seamlessly escalates to national identity and historical memory. The melodrama prompts us to ask questions about why lineage matters, and lets us dwell with a deception for a long time before revealing the broader implications of what the film is doing. Almodóvar’s courage in letting the tremendous images at the end stand on their own is incredibly refreshing in 2022. Great acting, smart writing, terrific score.\n\n13) Wife of a Spy (Kiyoshi Kurosawa)\n\nI don’t know if anyone else is capable of making something this elegant that slaps this hard. The way Kurosawa deploys horror tropes in far flung genres is fascinating as ever.\n\n12) All Hands on Deck! (Guillaume Brac)\n\nI saved this for the dead of Montana winter, and it was a delicious treat to be transported to summertime in France. This is such a readily lovable movie, with an endearing sense of romance and spontaneity. Truly a joy.\n\n11) Annette (Leos Carax)\n\nLeos Carax making an English-language movie for Amazon was a little concerning, but wow, what a result. It is certainly not artistically compromised. Indeed, what I most admire about this its sense of artistic liberty. The drama doesn’t quite grip me the way it grips many others, but I don’t even care about that, as I am just utterly exhilarated by its formal boldness and unfettered creativity.\n\n10) Malignant (James Wan)\n\nIf you’ve heard grumpy horror fans like me complaining about the direction the genre has gone in the last 5-10 years and you’re wondering what we would prefer instead, this is the answer. I will probably watch this movie once a year for the next 20 years. Bravo!\n\n9) France (Bruno Dumont)\n\nThis movie is widely referred to as a media satire, but I think that sells it far short. It’s doing something much more interesting than satirizing the media; it’s exploring the question of what “authenticity” even means at this stage of history, and examining the way that “real life” already involves elements of performance and performance is in turn a part of “real life.” Dumont’s absurdist humor is still here, albeit in a subtler form.\n\n8) Hold Me Back (Akiko Ohku)\n\nI had not seen any of Ohku’s films before this one, so credit to Filipe Furtado for pointing me to it by putting it high on his 2021 list (which I recommend taking a look at if you enjoy year end lists). I realized as I watched this that there are very, very few films that address (let alone take as their primary subject matter) the anxiety that can be present at the beginning of a relationship even when things are going as well as could be hoped for. The core conflict here emerges from the Proustian idea that transformational life changes constitute a sort of death, and that often we head into them with profound dread even when they are changes that we do in fact want for ourselves. Superb acting.\n\n7) Wrath of Man (Guy Ritchie)\n\nFirst let me say that I fully understand disliking Guy Ritchie. I have mildly disliked Guy Ritchie for most of my life. But I have to say, this one turned it around for me, and a second viewing confirmed my impression: I really love this. Since I first saw it, I went back and rewatched his entire filmography, and liked most of it a lot better. This is one of my favorite moments in cinephilia: changing my mind!\n\nWhat I realized about Ritchie is that his primary genre is not crime, it’s screwball comedy of masculine embarrassment. Wrath of Man comes full circle and stretches what could have been such a comedy out into a pitch black slow burn revenge movie. Some complain that the plotting is strained, but that doesn’t bother me a bit: the lineage here is not Heat so much as Den of Thieves, Armored, and Julien Leclercq, and I appreciate the way this wears its B movie heart on its sleeve. The real interest of the script is the way it captures the absolute garbage that men (and women) say to each other in unrestrained macho contexts. Tough guy posturing and inevitable humiliation, this time played as tragedy.\n\nTwo other highlights I would emphasize are Christopher Benstead’s score, which is easily my favorite of the year, and Scott Eastwood, who is remarkably well-deployed. Scott just looks so much like his dad in this, and his repeated stare-downs with Statham are extremely effective at evoking the Eastwood iconography.\n\n6) Zeros and Ones (Abel Ferrara)\n\nI highly doubt there will be a better movie about the pandemic (which is not to say that that’s all this is about). Let me be clear that this is a challenging film and I don’t think it’s something that most people would like (so proceed at your own risk and don’t blame me if you hate it!), but its dark, underexposed visual style and elliptical narrative are (for me at least) perfectly suited to the subject matter.\n\n5) Old (M. Night Shyamalan)\n\nSo many things are happening at once in this movie. First, there is the sci-fi horror story that primarily functions as a critique of the-ends-justify-the-means ruthless utilitarianism. But, as is typical for Shyamalan, this blunt thematic framework is the beginning rather than the end of his ambitions. For most of the movie, we have no idea what’s really going on and the wild events of the narrative play as surrealism. Once all hell starts to break loose, he doesn’t narrowly orient the movie towards its thematic goalpost, but rather dives headfirst into the prismatic range of possibilities that the situation opens up. Shyamalan never wastes anything. He puts the full weight of life into every subplot and blasts every emotion at once at full volume. I watched this twice, and it excited me even more the second time.\n\nI am trying to be careful about spoilers but see my letterboxd review for more thoughts on this fantastic movie.\n\n4) Memoria (Apichatpong Weerasethakul)\n\nAn extraordinary example of experiential cinema, inviting us to share not just in the sensory experiences of Swinton’s character, but also the liminal state of consciousness that she sinks into over the course of the film.\n\n3) Cry Macho (Clint Eastwood)\n\nMore similar to Memoria than anything else from 2021, this is another starkly unconventional study of a gringo in Latin America. It’s certainly not for everyone, but for lovers of late style in general and Clint Eastwood in particular, it’s hard to beat. It’s not so much a swan song as the epilogue to a series of swan songs. The narrative is largely tossed aside in favor of languid scenes of Clint caressing horses and slow dancing with a widow he meets along the way. The way this movie is so happy to be imperfect only adds to its shaggy beauty.\n\n2) Siberia (Abel Ferrara)\n\nI suspect that my own life history as a recovering alcoholic with more than 14 years of sobriety gives me a different vantage point on this one. It’s a bit of an oversimplification, but I find it helpful to think of Siberia as the psychic substrate of the more literal Tommaso. Both films are best understood as not merely being about recovery, but rather as part of Ferrara’s own recovery project. When one is sober for years on end, the threat of relapse slips into the background and the more immediate struggle becomes coping with the crushing weight of all the fears, desires, and urges that one used to suppress by drinking. What Ferrara is doing in these films is not merely portraying this subject matter, but actively working through his own struggles. I can say from experience that it is very common for people to get into stuff like Jung at this stage and try to use it to make sense of their own psychic landscape, and that’s exactly what we find Ferrara doing here. I could understand the complaint that the Jung material is too on the nose, but again from my particular vantage point it’s perfect. Making a movie about his own most fucked up dreams using an explicitly Jungian framework is EXACTLY what I would expect from Abel Ferrara as he eases into long-term sobriety. The images he finds along the way are simply spectacular. Thrilling, vital cinema.\n\n1) Titane (Julia Ducournau)\n\nJulia Ducournau said in an interview that she put everything into Raw, and that after finishing her festival tour with that film she had the very common experience of creative block in approaching her second major work. Eventually, she explained, she stopped struggling and wrote freely from a place of unfettered rage, and Titane is the result. Many have complained about a perceived lack of thematic coherence and legibility. I have seen countless people ask: what the hell is it about? Reductive answers to this question do the film a disservice. If there’s anything that’s true of Titane, it’s that it is pitched at a level of abstraction that cannot be readily translated into some kind of message or commentary. It’s understandable that this makes us uncomfortable, especially given the thorny terrain of violence, gender, and sexuality, but the more time I spend thinking about this film the more confident I am that the best way to approach it is not to try to reconstruct it as a totalizing allegory, but rather to think about the complex, evolving ways it reacts to its own vicissitudes, and to the conventions of the serial killer and melodrama genres. It asks us to imagine Alexia’s surreal way of being, where traditional objects of affection (first parents, then lovers) are replaced by metal, engines, and automobiles. It then asks us to inhabit her sense of overwhelming rage at a world that holds open some possibilities but closes off others. The status of Alexia’s sexuality as absurd is itself a fountain of rage in the movie. She isn’t interested in people, she’s into metal and this just isn’t a path the world allows. As she navigates the consequences of her revolt, she stumbles into a loving relationship that is so utterly unconditional as to be surreal, but even this turns out to be limiting in a way that enrages her: she has to be son or lover, male or female. Even if she gets to choose her role, it’s still a role, and every possibility that it opens closes off many others. And it’s this–the qualified nature of human freedom, built into the very structure of human agency–that is the primary target of the movie’s rage. I’m still planning to write a longer piece arguing that it has at least as much in common with All that Heaven Allows as the range of movies it is more often compared to.\n\nOther stuff I liked:\n\nLicorice Pizza, Red Rocket, The Power of the Dog, West Side Story, No Sudden Move, Godzilla vs. Kong, Zack Snyder’s Justice League, The Many Saints of Newark, Shiva Baby, Benedetta, Wrong Turn, The Forever Purge, One Shot, Halloween Kills, In the Earth, Shock Wave 2, Me You Madness, Raging Fire, Hell Hath No Fury, Spencer, Escape Room: Tournament of Champions, Venom: Let there be Carnage, Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar, Resident Evil: Welcome to Racoon City, Copshop, Rifkin’s Festival.\n\nSpecial bargain bin awards:\n\nAbove Suspicion, Jolt, Voyagers, Chaos Walking, Ice Road, Karen, The Woman in the Window, Zone 414.\n\nAngela Shope\n\n10) Dune\n\nI appreciate the way this version’s dramatic focus is the relationship between Jessica and Paul. That’s a riskier direction to take the movie than it gets credit for, and I like it. I also found it visually striking. Not many big blockbusters of recent years have captivated me like this.\n\n9) The Green Knight\n\nI love Arthurian lore and this scratched that itch for me. There’s a seriousness and a darkness to this movie that Matt totally rejected when we watched it together, but it really works for me.\n\n8) House of Gucci\n\nLoud, colorful, and super fun. No apologies, I love it.\n\n7) Memoria\n\nMesmerizing and dreamlike. By the end I felt like I was sharing the state of mind of Swinton’s character.\n\n6) Old\n\nThis has a fantastical quality to it, like a dark fairy tale, and I am drawn to that. It’s very moving, but it also has its wicked pleasures. The horror elements are exactly in the zone that I like: terrifying, but not disgusting.\n\n5) Parallel Mothers\n\nExtremely affecting. The way this movie combines melodrama and politics is something I’ve never seen done quite this way before. As usual for Almodóvar, the use of color is fantastic and wonderfully evocative of Spain.\n\n4) Spencer\n\nI found the depiction of anxiety and an eating disorder in the style of a horror movie to be haunting. Kristen Stewart is excellent.\n\n3) Wrath of Man\n\nI was gripped for every second of this. The way the plot and the musical score both build to a violent eruption is extremely satisfying. Great cast.\n\n2) France\n\nLéa Seydoux is one of my favorite actresses, and this is her best role. Her makeup and costuming is *so amazing*, but it’s not just for show, it’s closely connected with the themes of the movie. I’m thrilled to see such a complex and ambivalent female character take center stage. The score is incredible.\n\n1) The Last Duel\n\nThere have been a lot of explicitly feminist movies in recent years that reinforce the rallying cry of #metoo. The Last Duel is the one that most fully captures my own sense of rage as a woman. I love period pieces, and I am extremely impressed that this movie manages to simultaneously satisfy my historical craving while also so perfectly capturing the present.\n\nHonorable mention: The Power of the Dog, Lamb, The Tragedy of Macbeth\n\nJosh Strohl\n\nThis year Josh and Isabel have been very busy moving to Rochester and starting new jobs, but they still managed to put lists together. They didn’t have time to write commentary, but will be happy to discuss their picks on Facebook.\n\nThe Last Duel (Ridley Scott)\n\nFrance (Bruno Dumont)\n\nLicorice Pizza (Paul Thomas Anderson)\n\nThe French Dispatch (Wes Anderson)\n\nSiberia/Zeros and Ones (Abel Ferrara)\n\nWest Side Story (Steven Spielberg)\n\nHouse of Gucci (Ridley Scott)\n\nCry Macho (Clint Eastwood)\n\nDrive My Car (Ryusuke Hamaguchi)\n\nMemoria (Apichatpong Weerasethakul)\n\nOld (M. Night Shyamalan)\n\nParallel Mothers (Pedro Almodovar)\n\nZola (Janicza Bravo)\n\nThe Beatles: Get Back (Peter Jackson)\n\nWrath of Man (Guy Ritchie)\n\nBenedetta (Paul Verhoeven)\n\nTitane (Julia Ducournau)\n\nWheel of Fortune and Fantasy (Ryusuke Hamaguchi)\n\nZack Snyder’s Justice League (Zack Snyder)\n\nSwan Song (Todd Stephens)\n\nIn the Earth (Ben Wheatley)\n\nRed Rocket (Sean Baker)\n\nMalignant (James Wan)\n\nDon’t Breathe 2 (Rodo Sayagues)\n\nThe Forever Purge (Eduardo Gout)\n\nActing performances\n\nLea Seydoux – France\n\nUdo Kier- Swan Song\n\nBen Affleck/Jodie Comer/Matt Damon/Adam Driver -The Last Duel\n\nLady Gaga/Jared Leto/Al Pacino/Jeremy Irons- House of Gucci\n\nSimon Rex – Red Rocket\n\nAlana Haim/Cooper Hoffman- Licorice Pizza\n\nVincent Lindon – Titane\n\nClint Eastwood – Cry Macho\n\nCharlotte Rampling – Benedetta\n\nMatt Damon – Stillwater\n\n4K UHD Blu-ray releases\n\nI continue to be an avid physical media collector, and these were my favorite UHD releases.\n\nThe Ten Commandments\n\nThe Red Shoes/Criterion 4K\n\nArgento on 4K\n\nManiac Cop 2/Blue Underground 4K\n\nIn the Line of Fire/Last Action Hero\n\nMy Fair Lady\n\nAwaken\n\nDjango\n\nTremors\n\nSpeed\n\nIsabel Strohl\n\nThe Last Duel\n\nFrance\n\nTitane\n\nParallel Mothers\n\nWest Side Story\n\nMalignant\n\nOld\n\nThe Night House\n\nZack Snyder’s Justice League\n\nZola\n\nAmazon Prime\n\nDay of the Outlaw (André De Toth, 1959)\n\nAn exceptional western, stark and relentless, with an unforgettable Burl Ives performance. You’ll recognize it as the primary blueprint for The Hateful Eight.\n\nPosse (Mario Van Peebles, 1993)\n\nIt’s annoying that the Netflix western The Harder They Fall prompted so many articles about how finally a movie is straightening out the truth about the west and showing us that there were black cowboys. There are so many black westerns! This is not a new thing! Posse is a terrific example, and I greatly enjoyed revisiting it recently. Psychedelic style, Big Daddy Kane, and let’s not overlook the single best Stephen Baldwin performance.\n\nPhantasm: Remastered (Don Coscarelli, 1979)\n\nAn all-time banger, restored for your viewing pleasure in all its oddball glory.\n\nToo Late for Tears (Byron Haskin, 1949)\n\nWhat might have been a minor noir is juiced up by Lizabeth Scott’s incredible femme fatale performance opposite Dan Duryea. I really love this one.\n\nThe Brain (Ed Hunt, 1988)\n\nAvoid the RiffTrax version like the plague (and let me take another opportunity to say: fuck RiffTrax). This is sort of a Videodrome/They Live/Bodysnatchers mashup with effects out of Invaders From Mars. So, it’s highly derivative, but of some terrific stuff.\n\nThe Butcher (Jesse V. Johnson, 2009)\n\nLow budget crime movie, not for everyone. The question you’ve gotta ask yourself is, “how interested am I in watching Eric Roberts drive around LA doing errands?” Because that’s what most of this movie is. I’m a fan.\n\nAlien Intruder (Ricardo Jacques Gale, 1993)\n\nAlso not for everyone. I’ve been very pleased to see on Twitter that the younger generation of cinephiles have found their way to PM Entertainment– some of the finest trash this country has ever produced. Don’t be deterred by the advertised PG-13 rating. Amazon has it wrong: this is definitely a hard R. Bargain basement Lifeforce meets Nightmare on Elm Street, starring Billy Dee Williams.\n\nLondon (Hunter Richards, 2005)\n\nAlso not for everyone. This features one of the most outside-the-box Jason Statham performances. It’s in the highly unfashionable zone of probing the most pathetic depths of the injured male psyche, but it’s a very good version of this (the 14% tomato score shows you that it’s doing something right). Most of the movie is Statham and Chris Evans doing cocaine and talking about an involuntary breakup and other pathetic bro shit. Works for me.\n\nHulu\n\nTitane (Julia Ducournau, 2021)\n\nJust letting you know that Titane is on Hulu! It’s a highly divisive movie which you may very well hate, but I vote that you watch it. I am writing an essay on it still, I swear, though it’s slow going and I’ve had a lot of distractions. I absolutely vehemently reject the main criticisms that have been circulated and it’s one of my favorite movies in recent memory.\n\nDevil in a Blue Dress (Carl Franklin, 1995)\n\nSuperior neo noir with an outstanding cast. This is something everyone should see.\n\nThe Edge (Lee Tamahori, 1997)\n\nI’ve seen this movie so many times. I like Lee Tamahori in general, and this was written by Mamet. It’s a terrifically fun and engaging “lost in the wilderness” story, with a killer bear, Anthony Hopkins as a survival manual expert with no practical experience, and Alec Baldwin as his sleazeball frenemy.\n\nLove and Monsters (Michael Matthews, 2020)\n\nNot exactly a masterpiece, but I recommend it because it stands out amidst contemporary mainstream cinema. It succeeds because it fully commits to being what it is and because the monsters are really cool and someone put loving attention into designing them. Infinitely better than something like A Quiet Place.\n\nHBO Max\n\nMy Brother’s Wedding (Charles Burnett, 1983)\n\nUnderseen Charles Burnett family drama, rough in certain ways (arguably more of a feature than a bug) but full of rich detail and withering observation of class dynamics.\n\nNews from Home (Chantal Akerman, 1976)\n\nChantal Akerman reads her mother’s letters over long takes of mundane city scenes. One of the greatest NYC movies in the way it conveys so much about the immigrant’s experience without ever breaking away from its rigorous concept.\n\nOpening Night (John Cassavetes, 1977)\n\nOne of the more underseen titles among Cassavetes’ essential masterpieces. Absolutely see it if you haven’t.\n\nPump Up the Volume (Allan Moyle, 1990)\n\nOne of the key movies for my generation. I saw it so many times in the 90’s, and it absolutely holds up. Christian Slater gloriously conveys the ecstasy of transgressive performance.\n\nNetflix\n\nNetfix is still mostly bad (I’ve already recommended most of the good stuff several times over), so I’m lining up some safe favorites for anyone who may not have noticed them.\n\nMichael Mann trifecta: Ali (2001), Public Enemies (2009), Blackhat (2015)\n\nI rewatch most of Michael Mann’s movies regularly, and these are all just getting better and better with age. Ali is a rare attempt to do something creative and bold with a terrible genre (the biopic). The digital textures of Public Enemy are more bracing now than ever. Miami Vice gets more attention at this point, but while Public Enemies might not have quite the same level of shaggy evanescence, it is fascinating in its integration of aspects of classic Hollywood style. And, of course, you know how I feel about Blackhat.\n\nBram Stoker’s Dracula (Coppola, 2001)\n\nI’m blow away every time I watch it (and it’s my wife’s favorite movie, so I watch it a lot). One of the greatest modern examples of the Méliès/Cocteau lineage of cinema. Would take this opportunity to note that “Keanu Reeves is a detriment here” is one of my least favorite opinions.\n\nAnaconda (Luis Llosa, 1997)\n\nI’m well known for my enduring love of Anaconda. My siblings still tell the story about the time when they had a party in my parents’ cellar and I got stoned and passed out watching Anaconda in the other room. When the revelers emerged and woke me up, I saw the credits rolling on the TV and lamented, “Aw, man, Anaconda’s over?!!!” Seriously though, what a cast: Jon Voight (the MVP), J-Lo, Owen Wilson, Ice Cube, Eric Stoltz, Danny Trejo.\n\nWild Things (John McNaughton, 1998)\n\nI remember finding this unremarkable when it was released, but that was a different time. We were absolutely glutted with erotic thrillers and it was easy to take them for granted. Now, in the new era of cultural puritanism, this looks a lot better. Fun and trashy, with a great Matt Dillon performance. It looks like there are some even trashier sequels (three of them!), which I intend to check out.\n\nI’m writing out of a lingering sense of dismay over a recent cyberbullying episode on Film Twitter. I am relatively new to Twitter (I joined last April), but I’ve already seen a lot of highs and lows. It is a great way to connect with people and get the word out about one’s own writings, but it’s also a cesspool of fragile egos emboldened by their relative anonymity. My favorite type of Film Twitter user is the person with unconventional taste who just wants to interact with other people who like weird stuff. In my day-to-day life, my film taste stands out as eccentric. A lot of the people I interact with STILL consider it controversial to love Tony Scott. I have been defending Tony Scott against unfair comments from skeptical acquaintances for more than 20 years! But within the first year of joining Twitter I have already constructed a fairly expansive bubble where it’s just taken for granted that Tony Scott is one of the great auteurs. This makes me feel so much less alienated in my aesthetic life!\n\nMy least favorite type of Film Twitter user is the person who likes to constantly reinforce their sense of superiority with a running stream of snide comments and lazy takedowns. This person feels an unjustified sense of pride because they dislike lots of things that their perceived inferiors are fond of. The thing is, it’s extremely easy to tear down literally any movie. Just give me a movie and I will compose a condescending tweet about it in less than a minute. Often, this category of Twitter user is just talking complete bullshit and at the same time feeling embarrassingly smug about it, but they have also likely surrounded themselves with lots of people who will shower them with enough back-pats and gold stars to give them the validation they crave.\n\nThis is all pretty sad, but mostly innocuous– except when it isn’t. This sort of circle jerk really crosses the line when it starts singling out particular people for ridicule on the basis of their taste. Recently, this happened to one of the most prominent users of the Letterboxd app: Allison M., of vegan alerts fame. Allison was one of the first people to follow me when I joined Letterboxd, and her enormous log (more than 21,000 movies) is one of the most expansive on the site.\n\nLetterboxd is a terrific app. As someone who watches a lot of movies and then writes about them, it would be hard to overstate how convenient is to have an easy way to keep searchable, sortable, exportable records of my viewing activities. But even more importantly, it gives me access to the writings of a huge number of non-professional and semi-professional critics, who (surprise, surprise) are often far more interesting to read than the people trying to make a living off the enterprise. The majority of professional criticism (of new releases) is written in a rush after only seeing a movie once. Letterboxd removes the market demand for timeliness and gives people a venue to share more considered perspectives at their own pace. When people ask me who my favorite critics are on a given movie, the answer is almost certainly not the people who work at the New York Times or Indiewire. It’s more like “well, there’s this guy in Brazil who’s really interesting, and this college student from Vermont, oh, and that one Swedish woman who works at a guitar store– her take is really good.”\n\nA well-curated Letterboxd feed is, in my experience, far more useful than something like Rotten Tomatoes, which I really only pay attention to in order to make sure I see anything that scores below 10%. It’s easy to introduce a division of labor: there are people I follow for their eccentric horror views, people I follow for their expertise in Hong Kong cinema, people I follow because they have seen more precode films than I have, and so on. Some people I follow not because I share their views, but rather because I consistently disagree with them and find their perspective engaging and challenging. Others I follow because their sensibility is so radically different from my own that I find it aesthetically interesting, and Allison is in this category.\n\nShe is best known for the “vegan alerts” and (sometimes) “vegan points” that she adds to the end of her reviews. Vegan alerts might include “cheese is shown,” or “Isabelle Huppert wears a leather jacket,” while vegan points might include “Julia Roberts eats a salad” or “Tim Roth pets a goat.” She is also known for"
