        "meta_description": "Singer-filmmaker Barbra Streisand will be directing historical drama \"Catherine the Great\".\n\tThe film will mark Streisand's fourth following \"Yentl,\" \"The Prince of Tides\" and \"The Mirror Has Two Faces\".\n\tGil Netter is on board to produce the project, reported Variety.\n\tStreisand, 73,  will direct from a Black List script by Kristina Lauren Anderson.\n\tThe story revolves around Catherine, who was trapped in an abusive marriage with the heir to the Russian throne. When her inept husband proved incapable of ruling, she utilised her intelligence, fortitude and passion to rise to power, becoming Catherine the Great.\n\tCasting of the project is underway.\n\tStreisand's three directing efforts earned 14 Oscar nominations, including seven for 1991's \"The Prince Of Tides\".\n\tHer directorial debut \"Yentl,\" was the first major studio film to be directed, written, produced and star a woman. The movie won her the Golden Globe for best director.",
