        "text": "CAN A SINGER IN A nonmusical role actually ''belt'' a performance? Judging from the intensity Barbra Streisand brings to her starring role in her new film, ''The Mirror Has Two Faces,'' which begins as a screwball romantic comedy and reaches a crescendo of impassioned self-adoration, the answer is yes. Bing Crosby crooned his nonsinging roles, Frank Sinatra swung them, and Elvis Presley rocked his. But the difference between singing and acting is the difference between an ethereal dream and a workout at the gym.\n\nIn ''The Mirror Has Two Faces,'' a film that is intended as a barbed comic fable about the commodification of female beauty, Ms. Streisand plays a self-effacing ugly duckling named Rose Morgan who is fixed up with a good-looking math professor, Gregory Larkin (Jeff Bridges). He longs for a chaste relationship based on intellectual kinship and marries her with the understanding that they will have a union of minds unspoiled by sex, unless she asks for it. When she does, Gregory flees in confusion, disappearing to Europe long enough for Rose to tone herself in a gym, lighten her hair and go on a mammoth shopping spree.\n\nShe is transformed into a superannuated Cosmo girl with frizzy blond hair and provocative cleavage. From this moment, every man in sight drools over Rose, including Gregory, her male students and her sister's dashing husband (Pierce Brosnan), whom Rose has always coveted. Eventually Gregory comes baying like a dog under Rose's apartment window.\n\nThe subtext of ''The Mirror Has Two Faces'' is by now familiar from any number of Streisand films, in which she plays a gawky, not conventionally pretty woman pining for a dreamboat whom she usually snags.\n\nWhat hasn't been apparent, however, is that the same emotional subtext informs almost everything she sings. You can hear it in the movie's closing song, ''I Finally Found Someone,'' a duet with Bryan Adams. In this song a teen-ager's sobbing pleas for attention, approval and a fairy-tale prince coincide with an adult's imperious declaration of intent to conquer. On Ms. Streisand's most powerful recordings, the chemistry between the song and her magnificent voice work alchemy, transmuting neurotic obsession into a universal cry for happiness, true love and even God. Straw is spun into gold.\n\nBut in her new movie, as well as in the recent round of talk-show interviews in which the star has repeatedly complained that her mother told her she wasn't pretty when she was growing up, there is more straw than gold to be gathered. The voice that can take neediness and sing it into something spiritually transcendent can't act the same feelings, or even discuss them in a manner that doesn't seem overbearing and humorless.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
