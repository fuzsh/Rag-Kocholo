        "text": "For those of who read my blogs, it is obvious that I am a movie fan.\n\nI love movies and have been going to movies for so long. I can remember Saturday afternoons when my best friend and I would go to the Troy Theatre and pay $.75 to get in, see two movies, and eat ourselves numb on NECCO wafers, Bit-O-Honey and Root Beer Barrels.\n\nThere will be a nexus here, but bear with me.\n\nIn an earlier post, I mentioned New Year Resolutions including mine, which is to be relevant. I received a lot of e-mails from readers asking, “What does that mean?”\n\nIs it a secret, buried in some aisle of Barnes & Noble under “personal growth?” Nope. It is looking in the mirror each morning and thinking, ‘what am I going to do with the day, TODAY?’\n\nAm I meeting with clients? Am I going to write? Am I going to study something? Which online newspapers will I read? What news will I watch? Who could possibly benefit from something I can do today?\n\nThink of the movie The Mirror Has Two Faces with Barbara Streisand. We can look at the mirror and see someone who is aging, who may lose his pep – and even step – as the day presses on. Maybe even someone who has some sagging skin.\n\nOr, we can look in the mirror and get excited that we can DO something today.\n\nThe first step to being relevant is knowing that you have the day to do something. We can fritter the day away, or we can act.\n\nMaybe, our role is to volunteer. Perhaps we are to help young guys coming back from war who need someone to talk to. Or, help a young kid read a book.\n\nHow about just finding out who needs help – and helping them? The world is a big place and there is no shortage of a need to help.\n\nI mentioned before that maybe our generation could be the second greatest generation ever.\n\nOur fathers went to war and became heroes. Maybe our role is to provide the greatest volunteer help this world has ever seen.\n\nWe have the greatest amount of experience any generation has ever accumulated. Let’s offer this experience, this knowledge and this interest.\n\nThere’s a ton of people out there who want what we’ve got!\n\nHow about checking out the mirror again in the morning— and see who’s looking back!?\n\nTake my advice for what it is…It’s just as I see it."
