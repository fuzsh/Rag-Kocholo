Gregory, who teaches at Rose's school, is frustrated with the complexity of sexual relationships and becomes intrigued by the idea of having a relationship that is only based on intellectual love. When he passes by Roses classroom and hears her lecturing on the role of chaste love in literature, he becomes interested and asks her out on a date. Gregory is even more attracted to Rose and proposes marriage on the condition that it be void of sexuality. Rose considers the offer in light of her desire to not remain alone."
