        "text": "Born Betty Perske, the child of Jewish immigrants to the US, Bacall changed her surname to her mother’s maiden name before embarking on a career as stage actor and fashion model. Spotted on the cover of Harper’s Bazaar in 1943 by Howard Hawks’ wife Nancy, she was persuaded to test for his Hemingway adaptation, To Have and Have Not.\n\nThe 19-year-old Bacall got the role, and the on-set romance that developed between her and co-star Humphrey Bogart not only ensured the chemistry between the pair was perfect for the story, but also sealed her place among the Hollywood immortals. She also got to deliver one of the great movie double entendres: “You know how to whistle, don’t you, Steve? You just put your lips together and... blow.”\n\nHollywood wasn’t slow at exploiting Bacall’s sudden sex-kitten status. She was quickly cast opposite silver-tongued smoothie Charles Boyer in another literary thriller, Graham Greene’s Confidential Agent, about a Spanish republican trying to secure coal supplies during the civil war. Tagged as “the Look meets the Lover”, it uneasily mixed wartime politics with smouldering romance, and was a massive flop.\n\nBack with Bogart, and Hawks behind the camera, Bacall swiftly returned to favour with an unarguable classic, and her third adaptation in a row. The Big Sleep, from Raymond Chandler’s novel, had Bacall reprise her dangerous-sexuality act from To Have and Have Not, and it cemented the Bogie-Bacall phenomenon that gripped American audiences in the late 1940s.\n\nIt was clear that acting opposite Bogart was box-office and gossip-column catnip; Bacall went for it again in yet another noir adaptation: this time, David Goodis’ Dark Passage. Shot by Delmer Davies with a then-modish POV camera, this had Bacall as the lone believer in Bogart’s character’s innocence of a murder charge.\n\nBacall’s fourth and final film opposite her husband was the John Huston thriller Key Largo – where both were arguably overshadowed by fellow lead Edward G Robinson; he’s a gangster whose goons take ex-soldier Bogart and hotel-keeper’s daughter Bacall hostage down in Florida as a hurricane is moving in.\n\nThe 1950s brought a change of pace. Bacall still played complicated and sexy, but in Young Man With a Horn she was cast alongside Kirk Douglas in a thinly disguised biopic of jazz tooter Bix Beiderbecke. With Hoagy Carmichael and Harry James shouldering most of the musical duties (together with the film’s third co-star, and other corner in the plot’s love triangle, Doris Day), there’s a finger-snapping authenticity to the proceedings.\n\nAfter starting a family with Bogart, and spending months with him in Africa as he made The African Queen, Bacall loosened up, acting wise, to take her place alongside two other bona fide sex kittens, Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable, in How to Marry a Millionaire. A widescreen colour sex comedy par excellence, it anticipated the mood of the decade; not the least Bacall’s status as “Den Mother” of the hard-partying Rat Pack.\n\nAs Bogart’s health worsened, Bacall let her acting career take a back seat: her most prominent credit during this traumatic period was the Douglas Sirk saga Written on the Wind. Bacall played put-upon secretary Lucy Moore, unhappily married to alcoholic playboy Robert Stack, in Sirk’s soapy Texan melodrama, undeniably a forerunner of TV series such as Dallas and Dynasty. Bacall also found herself doing another sex comedy, Designing Woman, opposite Gregory Peck, as Bogart breathed his last in 1957.\n\nWithout much appetite for film-making, and no longer the box office draw she was, Bacall’s acting career became peripatetic and increasingly sparse. She made the British film North West Frontier, which necessitated a month in India and an extended stay in England, playing an American caught up in intercomunal violence in the turn-of-the-century Raj.\n\nAfter small roles in films like Shock Treatment and Sex and the Single Girl, Bacall staged something of a comeback in 1966 in Harper, alongside Paul Newman. Private-dick movies were very much her home territory (this one adapted from Ross MacDonald), and Harper was itself a tribute to classic noir, so Bacall herself had now taken on retro status, even if she had aged up a generation, playing a Californian matriarch who hires Harper to track down her husband.\n\nBacall spent much of the late 60s and early 70s acting on stage, but returned to cinema in 1974 for the star-stuffed Agatha Christie potboiler Murder on the Orient Express. Albert Finney played Poirot, and Bacall one of the principal suspects, alongside Sean Connery, Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony Perkins and Ingrid Bergman.\n\nBacall then agreed to take a place alongside other Hollywood icons for The Shootist, John Wayne’s final film. Made some three years before Wayne’s own death, its clear parallels with Bacall’s own experience of looking after Bogart gave the film unquestionable power. She played widow Bond Rogers, with whom the dying JB Books forms an unlikely romantic attachment.\n\nWhile winning more awards on Broadway (for Applause and Woman of the Year), Bacall squeezed in an unlikely lead role in 1981 – an early stalk-and-slash film called The Fan. (Not to be confused with the Robert de Niro/Wesley Snipes number from 1996.) Again capitalising on her Hollywood-icon status, she played the target of an obsessive record salesman, played by a fantastically young-looking Michael Biehn, only a couple of years before The Terminator. Although topical – released just after John Lennon’s murder – it was not a hit.\n\nBacall concentrated on theatre for the rest of the 1980s, with only another Agatha Christie ensemble piece Appointment With Death making any waves. The start of the next decade saw her make a more sustained movie comeback. Another obsessed-fan yarn, Misery, saw her cast as James Caan’s agent, and initiate the search for him when the novelist goes missing.\n\nAs the standard bearer of old-style Hollywood glamour, she was a natural for an cameo in Robert Altman’s sprawling fashion-world satire Pret a Porter, but Bacall sealed her comeback by receiving an Oscar nomination for a supporting role in The Mirror Has Two Faces. Otherwise a much-ridiculed vehicle for Barbra Streisand (who directed, and cast herself opposite Jeff Bridges), Bacall kept her dignity (just about) intact as Streisand’s yenta of a mother. But it was The English Patient’s year, and she lost the Oscar to Juliette Binoche.\n\nHer status secure, Bacall could relax into retirement. Instead, the early 2000s saw a late flowering, after Lars von Trier cast her alongside Nicole Kidman in his extraordinary Brechtian drama Dogville (as well as its 2005 follow-up, Manderlay). In Dogville, she plays Ma Ginger, the town storekeeper; in Manderlay she is Mam, the plantation owner with a book of slave rules, “Mam’s Law”\n\nBacall’s newfound art-film credibility led her to another “mother-of” role, in Jonathan Glazer’s indefinably strange Birth. The story of a woman who may or may not have encountered the reincarnation of her dead husband in a 10-year-old boy, Birth remains a haunting film; Bacall is part of the gallery of relatives questioning the kid’s credibility as he undermines Kidman’s new relationship.\n\nBacall was then subject to the tender mercies of Paul Schrader, America’s veteran art film auteur, for his 2007 film The Walker. A semi-sequel to Schrader’s American Gigolo, it has male escort Woody Harrelson squiring a number of regular clients around Washington DC – of which Bacall is one, along with Kristin Scott Thomas and Lily Tomlin. Together, they represent the cream of female film acting across several generations; Bacall was at home their company."
