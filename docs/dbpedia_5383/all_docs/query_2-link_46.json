        "text": "Barbra Streisand has released her first song in six years, titled “Love Will Survive” — and it’s her first work for an onscreen project in 12 years, since she herself last appeared in a movie, 2012’s “The Guilt Trip.”\n\n“Love Will Survive,” composed by Hans Zimmer and Kara Talve, will be Streisand’s end title anthem for the credits of Peacock and Sky limited series “The Tattooist of Auschwitz,” based on the WWII-set novel of the same name. Melanie Lynskey portrays real-life author Heather Morris, who interviewed Holocaust survivor Lali Sokolov (Harvey Keitel) about meeting his future wife Gina (Anna Próchniak) in a concentration camp. The novel is inspired by the real-life love story of Lali and Gita Sokolov, who met while prisoners in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp during the Holocaust. He had been ordered to tattoo serial numbers on prisoners’ arms.\n\nThis is Streisand’s first recording for a TV series. The EGOT winner said in a press statement that she felt compelled to record the original song due to the horrific resurgence of antisemitism in the modern world.\n\n“Because of the rise in antisemitism around the world today, I wanted to sing ‘Love Will Survive’ in the context of this series, as a way of remembering the six-million souls who were lost less than 80 years ago,” Streisand said. “And also to say that even in the darkest of times, the power of love can triumph and endure.”\n\nThe lyrics to “Love Will Survive” were written by Charlie Midnight. Walter Afanasieff and Peter Asher produced the track, with Streisand, Jay Landers, and Russell Emanuel executive producing. The song will be released on April 25, ahead of the limited series premiering on May 2.\n\nStreisand previously recorded songs for her own films such as “The Way We Were”, “The Main Event,” “Yentl,” “A Star Is Born,” and “The Mirror Has Two Faces” — as well as the extraordinary end-title anthem for a film she did not otherwise appear in, 1978’s “The Eyes of Laura Mars.” Her last studio album was 2018’s “Walls.” Streisand released two anniversary albums, “Evergreens: Celebrating Six Decades on Columbia Records” and “Yentl: 40th Anniversary Deluxe Edition,” in 2023.\n\nStreisand received the SAG Life Achievement Award in 2024.\n\n“Ever since I was a young girl sitting in the Loew’s Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, I dreamed of being one of those actresses I saw on the screen. The movies were a portal to a world I could only imagine,” she said of the honor. “Even though I was an unlikely candidate, somehow my dream came true. This award is especially meaningful to me because it comes from my fellow actors, whom I so admire.”"
