        "text": "I'm R12 who probably repeats this every time anything related to this subject comes up. Thats not how studio movies work. THE NORMAL HEART is a great example of how studios operated in the 90s to the Marvel era. They'd pay to devlop stuff like THE NORMAL HEART but they didn't want to finance movies like that. They wanted to finance movies like THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES--big stars, a soundtrack album they could sell millions of copies of, good reviews, maybe some oscar nominations if it worked out, if not, they were still making money off it.\n\nI'm the Sabbath and this vile family has no respect for me whatsoever. Firstly one of the daughters, the one who wasn't so needy, decides to get married on me. And then I find out the old, vain mother was just as contemptuous of me when the daughter reminds the old crone that the only thing she ever taught them about me was that Bergdorf's wouldn't be as crowded.\n\nThis family might as well be Gentiles. Fie on them!\n\nI watched it for the first time about a month ago. I’d agree with most of the posters here. But Barbra is passable and her sometimes annoying schtick actual works here. Lauren is quite good here I thought and believable has a former beauty and difficult mother. But in the end, the message is simply that if a woman loses weight and wears make up and slimming, stylish clothing, men will fall in love with her and her life will finally be complete. No matter that she is already successful on her own. That message hasn’t aged well.\n\nBut a pleasant movie nonetheless\n\nWasn't Dudley Moore supposed to play Austin Pendelton's part?\n\nIt's not a bad movie. The problem with Streisand's movies is that she should have just directed them (with the possible exception of perhaps Yentl). The one thing you can say is that she gets great performances out of actors. The problem is when she inserts herself into her movies, her vanity takes over.\n\nI could pictures someone like Goldie Hawn doing this role justice.\n\nI´m the reference in Queer as folk.\n\nEmmett : - It’s like The Mirror has Two Faces. Because Barbra plays an unattractive professor who marries Jeff Bridges because neither one of them can handle sex. But of course Barbra gets horny, because, hello, Jeff's such a dreamboat, so she hops on a Stairmaster for like two minutes, eats a carrot stick, and then poof! She's gorgeous. Then she comes in dressed like the hooker in Nuts, and of course, Jeff's willing to fuck her, and, um... they dance in the street.\n\nTed : - And she still wasn’t nominated !\n\nR8 The review can be found in Best American Movie Writing 1998. Here are some choice bits:\n\n\"The film dares to ask the largest philsophical question possible, something even more profound than Is there a God?, Why is there evil? or Why is this film shot in such soft-focus that sometimes the actors don't seem to have eyes? That question is, of course, Is Barbra Pretty?\n\nBarbra confronts Lauren Bacall (playing Barbra's mother) asking her what it's like to be pretty. She forces Lauren to confess that she's always been secretly been jealous of of Barbra. Watching a fity-four-year old movie star haranguing her mother onscreen is a very special moment; it is like seeing the perfect therapy payoff, where your mom writes a formal note of apology for your childhood and has it printed as a full-page ad in the Times. When Lauren breaks down, Barbra smiles a knowing half smile and nods sagely, and I\"m sure that in Europe the subtitle will read SEE, I'M PRETTY. TOLD YOU.\"\n\nRudnick goes on in a similar vein, but there's one last gorgeous bit I'll quote, describing the reaction to Barbra's character after her Big Makeover:\n\n\"Everywhere Barbra goes, she is lusted after, as if no one in New York had ever seen a grizzled mafia wife with a Sassoon cut before.\"\n\nFind the essay -- it puts the whole movie in perspective.\n\nRudnick wrote Sister Act, Addams Family Values, Jeffrey, and In & Out. Rudnick has worked as an uncredited script doctor on films including The Addams Family and The First Wives Club. He was credited as the pseudonym \"Joseph Howard\" for his work on Sister Act, which was originally intended as a vehicle for Bette Midler; the screenplay went through many changes, and by the time it became re-fashioned for Whoopi Goldberg he refused to have his real name associated with it. Rudnick's later screenwriting forays included Isn't She Great and the 2004 remake of The Stepford Wives. His script Coastal Elites––a socially-distanced film about the COVID-19 pandemic––was directed by Jay Roach and stars Bette Midler, Dan Levy, Issa Rae, Sarah Paulson, and Kaitlyn Dever. It began airing on HBO on September 12, 2020.\n\nWe are Diana and Roslyn Kind. We want to categorically state that the mother and the sister in the movie are not based upon us. We have always been nothing but nice to Barbara (and cashing our checks).\n\nHannah and Claire do not resemble us in any way, shape or form. We'll, except maybe in looks. Barbara did want the look of the film to be authentic, so she chose a photo of her own dad for a scene and cast our doppelgangers (Miss Bacall and Ms Rogers) to play the characters who are NOT based on us.\n\nWhy didn't Babs make a sequel to this? She could have had Rose (Barbra) find out that Geoffrey (Jeff) was a boring lay and then pine for Alex (Pierce) once again. Back to Mama (Bacall) to get insulted once more before eventually finding unexpected love and lust with the George Segal character.\n\nIn the final scene Babs and George Segal are seen role playing and the film ends with them pretending to be other people and introducing themselves to each other.\n\n\"Hello, I am Fred. Fred Sherman.\"\n\n\"Hello, Mr Sherman. I am Doris. Doris Wilgus.\"\n\n\"Pleased to meet you, Doris. Would you like to join me outdoors as we watch the sun spit morning?\"\n\n.... [italic] Fades to black[/italic]\n\n[quote] She was even upstaged by Clare Trevor in Key Largo, and almost by Martha Vickers (whose scenes were cut down) in The Big Sleep.\n\n\"Even upstaged\"?? Claire was a much better actress than Bacall. LB was a sensation in \"To Have and Have Not\" but not because of her acting ability. Both Hawks and Bogart gave her a pass and her talent even then was minimal.\n\nIn Key Largo, LB was a nonentity. Even Bogart didn't have a lot there, but he did have the final confrontation with Robinson. Barrymore and Robinson were terrific in Key Largo. As was Trevor, of course, Oscar winning performance. But LB - barely there.\n\nAs for Martha Vickers - her character was much more interesting than LB's.\n\nIn fact, LB got a pass on much of her early career because of her connection first to Hawks and then Bogart. Without those 2 making it easy for her, she would have disappeared fairly quickly. She did OK in the 1950s with Designing Woman, How to Marry a Millionaire and some others.\n\nRead the New York Times review (below) of 1945's \"Confidential Agent\", Bacall's 2nd film. Ouch. No Hawks or Bogart help on this one. And Boyer was not giving her the preferential treatment that she had gotten on her first picture.\n\nBut by and large, she's simply not particularly good.\n\nThat's why it's particularly ridiculous for her to have had such an attitude since her career is mainly due to her long dead husband.\n\nI am Barbra Streisand. I love to play the sexism card any time a mediocre performance or directing attempt doesn't get nominated for Oscars. I expect you to believe that Nuts, Prince of Tides and Mirror Has Two Faces were all Oscar-worthy cinematic masterpieces.\n\nDid I mention (for the seventh time in the last 3 minutes) that Spielberg saw my finished cut of Yentl and told me, \"Don't change a frame\"? But the cruel media reported that he gave me advice to make it appear as though I could not have done it without a man. Step aside, Viola. I have suffered too and far more than you have!\n\n[quote]Nick Nolte was also favored to win for a Streisand film and didn't. They must have really hated Streisand.\n\nMaybe they didn't like in and out of it drink/druggie Nolte. Nolte had an excellent scene or two, but his performance in Price of Tides is sooo hammy and overplayed imho. Of course that wouldn't disqualify any actor from winning an Oscar, but -\n\nA large part of being popular with the Establishment - ANY Establishment - is your relationship with them off screen/off sets/outside of work. That means going to parties and events, knowing people's names, schmoozing, pretending you like them, sucking up. If one shuns this side of it, one is not going to be popular most of the time. Most, not all, of the time.\n\n[quote]LB was a sensation in \"To Have and Have Not\" but not because of her acting ability.\n\nWhat's wrong with you? You don't have to be an acting genius to have acting ability. There were greater actresses than Bacall, but that doesn't mean she wasn't talented. She was great in To Have And Have not. No one could have done what she did (and she was 18 years old). I have never thought she was some kind of brilliant actress but why can't we give credit where it's due? She starred in several hit shows, she wasn't some untalented mannequin.\n\nWell he just announced he's autistic for one r185.\n\nHe also just was never one you saw attending premieres and doing publicity seeking stuff.\n\nHe didn't even attend the ceremonies for his last like 3 nominations. This year he didn't even want to travel to London from Wales where they had a remote acceptance site set up. (granted he probably though Chadwick Boseman would win so why bother at his age.)\n\nLet's clear up a few things before we go on, shall we?\n\n1.) Lauren Bacall WAS Hollywood A list royalty. Don't EVEN try and pretend otherwise. That woman became a legend when she married Bogart until the day she passed. There was a time when if you wanted to know what class and elegance meant, you looked at Lauren Bacall. And Diahann Carroll, but that's another story.\n\n2.) The oscar snub was deliberate and mean spirited. But Bacall got hers in the end. Meanwhile, what happened to the one who won the oscar over Bacall? Faded into obscurity. A second rate actress who got lucky by winning an oscar over a bonafide legend.\n\n3.) Spielberg told Barbra that Yentl was the best directed picture since Citizen Kane. That's a high honor. The fact that she wasn't nominated for anything for that movie is nothing short of pure and unadulterated sexism.\n\n4.) Barbra is good looking. You don't snag the list of hot men she has if you're not attractive. Barbra is a beautiful woman who was lusted after by many in the industry.\n\n[quote]Barbra is good looking. You don't snag the list of hot men she has if you're not attractive\n\nGood looking and attractive are not the same thing, R202. Babs used to be attractive under certain circumstances, but she was NEVER good looking. One can \"snag\" (are you my grandmother?) any man with enough cash, and Miss S had plenty of that. If she was merely Barbara from Brooklyn, those men wouldn't have spent the time of day with her. And they were around her and her money very briefly, she never had a long term relationship with any of these handsome heartthrobs, it was slam-bam thank you ma'am.\n\nIs James Brolin's first wife still alive? If so I wonder how she feels about Babs calling the kids her grandchildren.\n\nI remember her talking about adopting a kid and making sure it would be a girl. She seemed to never get around to it, just like directing more movies.\n\nHad she done it when she first met Brolin like she planned the kid would be grown by now (and could play Gypsy Rose Lee in Gypsy.)\n\nStreisand seems to have procrastination issues. I wonder what she does all day? Walks around pointing out weeds to the gardener?"
