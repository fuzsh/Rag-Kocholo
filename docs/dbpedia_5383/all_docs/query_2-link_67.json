        "text": "An undated publicity photo of Lauren Bacall, born September 16, 1924 in New York City.\n\nWith her instantly recognizable, alluring visage (dubbed “The Look”) and a smokey voice that both seduced and abandoned, Lauren Bacall was a screen star of the highest order, whose slow-burn of a career first lit up Hollywood film noirs in the 1940s (such as “The Big Sleep” and “To Have and Have Not”), before taking Broadway by storm. A two-time Tony Award winner, and a National Book Award winner for her 1980 autobiography “By Myself,” Bacall also received a lifetime achievement Oscar for her incomparable gallery of timeless work.\n\nBacall died on Tuesday, August 12, 2014, at age 89.\n\nBy CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan\n\nHarper's Bazaar\n\nBorn Betty Joan Perske, Lauren Bacall was a student of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (appearing off-Broadway as Betty Bacall) and was only 19 when, having been spotted on the cover of Harper's Bazaar, she obtained a screen test from director Howard Hawks.\n\n\"To Have and Have Not\"\n\nHoward Hawks cast Bacall opposite Humphrey Bogart in \"To Have and Have Not\" (1944).\n\nIn her autobiography, \"By Myself,\" Bacall wrote that Hawks said he wanted to put her in a film with Cary Grant or Humphrey Bogart. \"I thought, 'Cary Grant - terrific! Humphrey Bogart - yucch.'\"\n\nBacall's teaming with Bogart was the beginning of a beautiful friendship (the two were married the following year), and the launch of a timeless screen duo.\n\n\"To Have and Have Not\"\n\nLauren Bacall with Hoagy Carmichael in \"To Have and Have Not.\"\n\n\"Confidential Agent\"\n\nIn \"Confidential Agent\" (1945), Charles Boyer played a member of the anti-fascist column in the Spanish Civil War who encounters Lauren Bacall amid a tangle of espionage and diplomatic wrangling.\n\n\"The Big Sleep\"\n\nBacall starred as Vivian Sternwood Rutledge opposite Humphrey Bogart's Philip Marlowe in the Raymond Chandler mystery, \"The Big Sleep\" (1946), directed by Howard Hawks.\n\nBacall wrote, \"Howard's idea was always that a woman should play a scene with a masculine approach - insolent. Give as good as she got, no capitulation, no helplessness. Oh, he had something in mind, definitely, but it would be a long time before I knew what it was.\"\n\n\"The Big Sleep\"\n\nFilmed in 1945, the stateside release of \"The Big Sleep\" was delayed as Warner Brothers pushed to distribute several war-themed films in the closing months of World War II.
