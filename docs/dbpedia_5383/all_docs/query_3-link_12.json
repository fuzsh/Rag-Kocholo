        "text": "Barbra Streisand’s new film “The Mirror Has Two Faces”\n\napproaches the subject of marriage warily and with wit, like a George Bernard\n\nShaw play; two articulate people talk circles around love for two acts before\n\nfalling exhausted before the biological imperative in the third. Streisand\n\nplays Rose, a professor of literature who has more or less given up on her\n\nmarriage prospects, when she meets Gregory (Jeff Bridges), a man she really\n\nlikes. He really likes her, too. The key words here are “really likes,” which\n\nare not the same as “really loves.” Rose, 40ish in the movie, is in the dumps\n\nbecause of the marriage of her sister (Mimi Rogers) to a handsome new husband\n\n(Pierce Brosnan). Rose’s own dating circle seems to be limited to a nerd with\n\nan infectious grin (Austin Pendleton). Her sister, in desperation, answers a lonely-hearts\n\nad, and Rose and Gregory find themselves out on a date together.\n\nGregory\n\nis the kind of man who believes he cannot function well if he’s in love. In an\n\nawkward and unconvincing early scene, he is giving a talk on mathematical\n\ntheory when he spots his ex-wife in the audience, falters, blathers, and flees\n\nfrom the stage. Desperate, he calls a phone sex line (for advice, not sex) and\n\nthat leads to his lonely-hearts ad and the big first date with Rose, at which\n\nhe exclaims “beautiful!” as he looks at the sound waves on an oscilloscope\n\nwhile attending a concert.\n\nLater,\n\nthey discuss prime numbers. He is amazed by how smart she is. She is amazed by\n\nhow much she is attracted to him. So attracted that when he proposes marriage\n\nshe agrees to his terms: No sex, no physical affection, just “a meeting of two\n\nminds”–respect and friendship and none of that messy stuff to get in the way.\n\nThis works for a while, until she gets carried away and puts on a sexy\n\nnightgown, and he locks himself in the bathroom.\n\nThe\n\nscreenplay, by Richard LaGravenese, based on an earlier French film, is like a\n\nShaw play–”Pygmalion,” in fact, except that this Higgins has nothing to teach\n\nhis Eliza, and she has everything to teach him. It’s rare to find a film that\n\ndeals intelligently with issues of sex and love, instead of just assuming that\n\neveryone on the screen and in the audience shares the same popular culture\n\nassumptions.\n\nIt’s\n\nrare, too, to find such verbal characters in a movie, and listening to them\n\ntalk is one of the pleasures of “The Mirror Has Two Faces.” There is a\n\nwonderful scene in which Rose and her mother (Lauren Bacall) discuss beauty. We\n\nsee a photograph of Bacall at about the age of 20, and we see Bacall now,\n\nbeautiful in a different way, but old, and the daughter asks, “How did it feel?\n\nBeing beautiful?” “It was wonderful,” her mother says, and we get the eerie and\n\nmagical sense that we are hearing Streisand and Bacall discussing this. The\n\nmother then produces a photo of a cute baby, which Streisand assumes is of her\n\nsister. But it’s a picture of herself. “You were such a beautiful baby,” the\n\nmother says, and Rose says, “Thanks for showing me this picture, mom.” It is a\n\ngreat scene.\n\nIt\n\nleads to a dependable movie cliché, in which Rose transforms herself through\n\nexercise, wardrobe and makeup, into a beauty. Gregory has left after the\n\nawkward sex showdown, but now he wants to come back, and she thinks maybe she\n\ncan seduce him. Transformation scenes are standard in the movies, but this one\n\npays off in an unexpected way, leading to a payoff the movie works hard for,\n\nand earns.\n\nSome\n\nquibbles. Where is Streisand’s family from? Streisand speaks with her usual New\n\nYork accent, Bacall sounds mid-Atlantic, and Mimi Rogers sounds WASP as the\n\nsister. And although the Streisand character is articulate and intelligent in\n\nmost scenes, her intelligence level falters in the key scene intended to\n\nestablish it, as she lectures her Columbia lit students. She comes across more\n\nlike an inspirational after-dinner speaker with a standup comic’s style than\n\nlike a literature professor; in today’s better schools, the students would\n\nquickly pass the word that she was a lightweight showboat."
