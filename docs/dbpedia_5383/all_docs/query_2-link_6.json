        "text": "Home Movies\n\nMay 16, 1997\n\nWeb posted at: 10:40 p.m. EDT (0240 GMT)\n\nBy SCOTT HETTRICK\n\nIf all's well that ends well, then \"The Mirror Has Two Faces\" can be considered a well-made movie.\n\nThe problem is that it takes more than a good ending to make a good movie, and the ending is about all this latest Barbra Streisand movie has going for it.\n\nActually, the very beginning is OK, too. It's primarily the preposterous two hours in the middle that are the problem.\n\nStar/director/producer Streisand tries to give her character as much depth as her real-life self. It doesn't work. The viewer is asked to believe that this popular, self-confident literature professor, Rose Morgan, is, outside the lecture hall, a frumpy, unattractive woman who hides fattening snacks in her drawer, attracts only ultra-nerds and lives with her belittling, nagging mother (Lauren Bacall).\n\nWe're also supposed to believe that she is the sister of Mimi Rogers, a knockout who is so selective that she quickly tires of the attention heaped on her by her new husband Alex (Pierce Brosnan), a man Rose had a crush on before her cyclone of a sister snapped him up.\n\nJeff Bridges plays, again, a likable dufus of a mathematics professor at said university, who possesses none of Rose's teaching skills but shares her traditional interest in romance.\n\nThe difference is, Gregory Larkin has been burned many times by women interested only in sex, caring nothing about his excessive devotion to logic and detail.\n\nTo make a long set-up short, Greg and Rose get together on the pretext that sex is the cause of the failure of most good relationships.\n\nNow we are asked to buy into the most ridiculous premise of all: that these two would marry and go happily along for months, still believing that a sexless marriage is both practical and workable.\n\nOf course it isn't. And of course, ugly-duckling Rose transforms herself into a beautiful swan in a hokey and dated \"Rocky\"-like sequence. A couple of plot twists later, we finally get to the inevitable conclusion that is nonetheless sweet and romantic.\n\nIf only the middle could have captured the kind of Cary Grant-Katharine Hepburn romantic, comedic charm that it seems to so desperately be trying to pull off.\n\nLASER TIP: As a curiosity, the 1978 movie \"Capricorn One\" (Pioneer Special Edition, $49.98) offered O.J. Simpson one of his biggest co-starring roles in a legitimate movie.\n\nThere are many reasons why this movie should work, beginning with the compelling premise of faking a mission to Mars that would feature the first astronaut walking on the planet.\n\nHal Holbrook is convincing as the space-program administrator who concocts the idea at the last minute, when a mission has to be scrubbed, which will almost certainly lead to a cutoff in funding for the program that already is losing popular and political appeal.\n\nBrenda Vaccaro is quite good as the suffering wife of the primary astronaut, played by James Brolin, who adds little.\n\nAnd following a successful ruse, the idea of having the real spacecraft burn up on re-entry is clever, as it suddenly throws a curve ball on plans and leaves the reluctant trio of studio astronauts running for their lives.\n\nBut writer-director Peter Hyams loses his way too often and gets bogged down in silly characterizations, particularly with the characters of the suspicious investigative reporter and his friend (Elliott Gould and Karen Black). And Sam Waterston's only contribution as one of the astronauts is to constantly make jokes, which he verbalizes to himself as he climbs to certain death during the drawn-out astronauts' escape scene.\n\nA poorly staged car-chase sequence involving the reporter and unseen government agents features preposterous stunts and eye-rolling fast-motion scenes that completely push the viewer out of the movie.\n\n\"Capricorn One\" is such a blown opportunity, it seems inconceivable that the concept hasn't been broached again in the last 20 years.\n\nVID TIP: This year, home video will add to its collections a handful of movies made especially for the VCR. Expected to be released next is a 65-minute episode of the \"Batman\" animated TV series called \"Batman & Mr. Freeze,\" featuring three-dimensional computer-animation effects and a plot that ties into this summer's live-action theatrical release of \"Batman & Robin,\" which stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze.\n\nA special episode of Nickelodeon's animated \"Rugrats,\" titled \"A Rugrats Vacation,\" will premiere on home video July 8.\n\nThe second and third made-for-video features from Disney this year (after the recently released live-action \"Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves\") will premiere August 5 and September 30. \"Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin\" is the first full-length animated Winnie the Pooh movie. \"Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas\" reunites the actors who voiced the characters of the original theatrical release.\n\nVID TIP 2: This summer, some of last year's most critically acclaimed and biggest theatrical releases will compete with this year's video releases. Among them:\n\nJohn Travolta's angelic box-office hit \"Michael\" descends June 10, along with a polar opposite, \"Beavis and Butt-head Do America.\"\n\nJust after the Independence Day weekend, on July 8, the political thriller \"Absolute Power\" and the latest Chevy Chase family-travel comedy, \"Vegas Vacation,\" arrive, along with the Academy Award-winning documentary on the Muhammad Ali-George Foreman championship upset \"When We Were Kings.\"\n\nTwo other award winners premiere on video in July; \"Shine\" on July 15 and \"Sling Blade\" on July 22. The biggest Academy Award winner this year, \"The English Patient,\" isn't expected until fall.\n\nCopyright 1997 Los Angeles Times Syndicate\n\nRelated site:\n\nNote: Pages will open in a new browser window\n\nThe Mirror Has Two Faces\n\nExternal sites are not endorsed by CNN Interactive."
