        "text": "Like most people of a sane and well-adjusted disposition, I find the prospect of a couple of hours stuck in a car with Barbra Streisand to be terrifying, even if her company is adulterated by the presence of likably shouty leading man Seth Rogen. That's an hour-and-a-half for me, the viewer, eight days of narrative time for Rogen and la Bar as nervous son and interfering mother, and three months of real time on set for both of them. Sounds like I got off lightly.\n\nStreisand has been taking it easy the last decade or so. Since 2004 she has only appeared in two Fockers sequels (in which she was perfectly cast), and in the 1990s she only made two movies, both of which she directed and both of which were dismissed – quite rightly – as fraudulent ego-trip movies for their maker. You wonder why she bothered to return for this worn-out little road movie, just as you wondered why Jane Fonda ever got off the couch to make Peace, Love & Misunderstanding.\n\nFor me, the most memorable appearance of hers was on the public access TV show Driveways Of The Rich And Famous, in which it was vouchsafed to us that BS actively mans her own driveway intercom – and querulously (\"Whadya want from me?\"). As the show's presenter, John Cunningham, asked me, \"Good God, doesn't she have people?\"\n\nEven 20 years into semi-retirement, Mz S crowds any room she's in, and here in The Guilt Trip, as the mother of a harried inventor in a cross-country rush to sell his latest patent, she certainly sucks the air out of co-star Rogen. I suspect that for Streisand the control issues were all providentially aligned: a malleable director of women's projects (Anne Fletcher of 27 Dresses and The Proposal), and nothing in the script to stretch the comedic talents of the star of What's Up, Doc? and For Pete's Sake.\n\nPoor Barbra: the night she shows up to belt out some Marvin Hamlisch at the Oscars, she's just lost out at the Razzie Awards for worst actress in The Guilt Trip, and to Kristen Stewart, which must sting. Me, I wish she'd get back to serious directing, because nothing tickles me like one of those aforementioned fraudulent ego-trip movies from the 90s.\n\nJust look at them. Barbara's decidedly odd-duck characters are implausibly paired up with the primo hunks du jour. Thus, in The Prince Of Tides we have Barbra's Dr Susan Lowenstein bedding down with her patient, boff-tastic childhood sexual abuse victim Nick Nolte, a liaison which once, incidentally, provoked a rush of carnal feelings for his own psychiatrist in one Tony Soprano. In The Mirror Has Two Faces, her love action is Jeff Bridges; better yet, her ex is Pierce Brosnan.\n\nI need more of this, much more, and the older and kvetchier that Barb gets, the better I know I'll like it."
