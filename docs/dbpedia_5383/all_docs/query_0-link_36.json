Therefore, she is among the few to have achieved an EGOT (Emmy – 5, Grammy -10, Oscar – 2 and Tony – 1). It is considered the highest honor in the entertainment industry. And to think of her story as a “rag to riches”, Barbra Streisand has come a long way and her story serves as an inspiration to many.\n\nBarbra Streisand Bio (age and other general information)\n\nBarbara Joan Streisand was born on April 24, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York. She described her early childhood as painful. Barbra’s father died when she was just 15 months old, leaving her mother who had a meager paid job to support the family which included her brother.\n\nBarbra never let hardships at home affect her academics. From elementary school, she was an outstanding student. She attended Erasmus Hall High School in 1959 as the 4th in her class.\n\nDespite her academic excellence, Barbra sought to pursue a career in entertainment. She had developed a passion for singing as a child and nurtured it growing up. She also became interested in acting and often traveled to New York to learn more about the craft.\n\nA year after graduating from high school, Barbra1960 left her mother who was not so supportive of her career choice and rented an apartment in Manhattan. To make ends meet, she worked a series of odd jobs while remaining focused on a career in music and acting.\n\nAfter winning a talent contest at a gay Manhattanclub, Barbra scored a $125-a-week singing gig at the Blue Angel nightclub. Two years later, in 1962, Barbra’s dreams came true. She scored a role in the musical “I Can Get It for You Wholesale” that would change her life forever.\n\nThe musical was a hit, propelling Barbra to national recognition and earning her a recording contract with Columbia Records. Her debut album was a commercial success, winning her two Grammy Awards.\n\nBarbra built on her fame and gradually increased her star power over the years.\n\nNet value\n\nWith at least 35 studio albums released, 11 of these have reached number 1 on the Billboard 200, making Barbra Streisand the female artist with the most number 1 albums. She ranks third overall, behind Jay Z , 13 and The Beatles, 19.\n\nHer records have sold around 200 million worldwide, making her one of the best-selling artists of all time. Along with breaking chart records, Barbra has also toured millions. Her first full ‘Barbra Streisand in Concert’ tour (1993 – 1994) grossed $55 million ($89 million in 2017) from 26 shows.\n\nHere’s a look at his raw next tour\n\n“Timeless” (1999/2000) 26 shows – $70 million ($97.3 million in 2017 dollars)\n\n“Streisand” 2006/2007 29 shows – $119.5 million ( most successful )\n\nBarbra Live (2012/2013) – $66 million\n\nBarbra: The Music, The Mem’ries, The Magic (2016 – 2017) – $53 million\n\nIn 2017, Barbra Streisand’s tours grossed at least $350 million.\n\nBarbra also made her fortune acting. Her best acting days were between 1968 and 1980. During this period, she was a frequent participant in the Top Ten Money Making Stars poll which ranked the highest earning entertainers.\n\nShe started a production company Barwood Films in 1972. Under the company, she writes, produces and directs her own films. Some of them include; Yentl (1983), The mirror has two faces (1996). She reportedly earned $20 million from the latter and $3 million form the former. Streisand earned 8 figures from a number of acting gigs.\n\nHer net worth is estimated at $390 million easily making her one of the richest women in the entertainment industry. She lives on luxury. According to sources, Streisand has a personal shopping arcade at his luxurious beachfront mansion in Malibu. She bought the property for $20 million and today it would be valued at $200 million.\n\nhusband and children\n\nBarbra Streisand has dated equally illustrious people in her life, including Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and tennis champion André Agassi. However, she had only been married twice, first to actor Elliott Gould.\n\nAlso Read: Annie D’Angelo Biography, Married, Husband, Children, Family, Facts\n\nTheir union lasted from 1963 to 1971 and produced one child, a son named Jason Gould. Jason Gould, born on December 29, 1966, has since followed in his parents’ footsteps to become an artist. In 1988, at age 21, Jason came out as gay.\n\nAfter a number of failed relationships, Streisand married actor James Brolin on July 1, 1998. They have no children together, so Jason Gould remains Streisand’s only child. However, Brolin has three children including actor Josh Brolin from two past marriages."
