        "text": "In January 1966 Barbra Streisand started working on her second television show, to be taped in color and titled, appropriately, Color Me Barbra .\n\nCLIMBING INTO THE PAINTINGS\n\nThe first stop for taping was Philadelphia’s Museum of Art with three brand new Marconi color cameras. (New York’s Metropolitan Museum denied permission to tape Color Me Barbra in their facility, but Philadelphia’s Museum of Art allowed the television crew to tape the show in their space provided it was finished by Monday morning.)\n\nStreisand pre-recorded the songs for the museum segment on January 20, 1966 at Columbia Studios East 30th Street location. Barbra and music director Peter Matz picked the takes she thought were best, all in preparation for the on-location shooting in Philadelphia.\n\nStreisand and crew captured the video they needed on January 22-23, 1966 at the museum. Barbra wrote about the taping: “As soon as the museum taping began, two of our new Marconi cameras gave out. There were no replacements. That left us with only one for the whole opening section.”\n\n“It's a great museum,” Streisand said about Philadelphia Museum of Art in March 1966. “The rooms are beautifully laid out and I go from exhibit to exhibit with my costume changing to match the period on display. It's not easy to do a musical show in a museum but I got a kick out of asking them to move a million dollars worth of paintings simply to provide an appropriate backdrop for a song. It was fun, but it took so much time technicians were falling asleep at the cameras.”\n\nPat McBride—who in 1966 was CBS's longest working cameraman—told The Herald Mail : “I never knew anyone like Barbra. She reminds me of those pioneer women you see in the movies, always heading west in a covered wagon. She's physically strong and is always pleasant without being depressingly cheerful, if you know what I mean. She never gets ruffled and can work longer at a stretch than almost anyone I ever saw. If she lived in the old days, you just know she's a girl who wouldn't be afraid of an Indian attack.”\n\nJane Abrams described the studio audience in the New York Daily News. She wrote: “We were amazed at the warm enthusiasm yet good control of the audience, which included members of the star's fan club. What particularly interested us was the intensity of their reaction to the performer, both in her live appearance in which she sang the concert portion of the showing and in her taped sequence previously done at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The audience was peppered with people dually watching Miss Streisand in front of them and as she appeared on the small monitors in the studio.”\n\nEric, a Streisand fan club member at the time, recalled attending the taping:\n\nWhen she made her only appearance at the audience taping for Color Me Barbra, the audience went a little nuts. We were told by the announcer that she would not be performing, so people were shouting out ‘We love you!’ and the like. I shouted out ‘Recite a poem!’ (don’t ask me why, but that’s what I shouted out), and she just said, in her inimitable style (of the time), ‘Mary had a little lamb...’ and that was all for the poem. We all went crazy!”\n\nA highlight of the concert segment was the closing song — “Starting Here, Starting Now.” Written by David Shire, it's an instant Streisand classic. “Everyone wanted Barbra to record their songs,” Shire said. Although he worked with Barbra in the pit on Funny Girl, she had only sung one of his songs (“Autumn” on thePeople album). Shire continued to explain that “one day she saw a new piece on the top of my piano and asked ‘What is that?’ to which I replied ‘That's a bossa nova intended for Robert Goulet.’ ‘Well, let me hear it, anyway,’ she said. I played ‘Starting Here, Starting Now,’ and that's the song she wanted.\n\n“I think it's a better show than [ My Name is Barbra ],” Dwight Hemion said. “But that's hard for me to tell, because I've been so close to both of them. I know we all worked a lot harder on Color Me Barbra. The fact that this show is in color and My Name is Barbra wasn't accounts in part for the extra effort, but only in part. I think we worked much harder on this show because the first one turned out so well. We were on the spot. We really had something to shoot at.”\n\nIn late March, right before the special aired, Streisand told journalist Harvey Pack: “The TV show was a lot of work and now I have to finish the album of the show. In between there's fittings for the London opening ofFunny Girl and preparing to go to England for the run takes a lot of time. A lot of [critics] said last year's [TV special] was overproduced. Wow! Wait until they get a peak at this one. Even I think it's overproduced ... but I love it. One thing I love about doing a TV show is that with a few snips of the tape we can do tricks and on screen it looks like magic.”"
