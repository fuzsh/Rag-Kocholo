You're not good enough for me.\"\n\nI LOVE FEMINISM!\n\nThis has one of the funniest goofs I've ever seen. The scene in which Babs is leaving Pierce Brosnan you can see a crew guy in the mirror. Goofs happen all the time, who cares, but this one is so wonderful because not only is he standing there but he starts chugging a HUGE drink. Cinema, honestly.\n\nA movie about a weird guy who is afraid of sex. Watching this I was like \"what is this, my TWENTIES??\" Three and a half stars!\n\nStar ratings are kinda dumb right? I just love shouting them at the end, I'm torn though. Should I discontinue them? Should we all and just revert to cryptic reviews sans ratings or perhaps the binary like/lack of like system? Why do YOU use or not use star ratings?? Sound off in the comments boxheads!!\n\ndirector Barbra Streisand: So Jeff, this is the last scene of the movie. Remember how in the script we kiss and the film abruptly ends?\n\nJeff Bridges: um-hum\n\nB: Well I think maybe would be best if we extended it a little.\n\nJ: Uh ok\n\nB: We could kiss..\n\nJ: yeah\n\nB: and then maybe.. kiss.. some more?\n\nJ: Sure, if that's wh..\n\nB: Heck let's just make out 'till the end of the credits! There's Bryan Adams, there's Puccini. A couple of 15min takes should do\n\nJ: 15 MINUTE TAKES??!\n\nB: Yeah, you're so fiiinnneeesssuch a phenomenal actor I really want to make the most of it. F-for the audience, that is. Then maybe we can just grab a cab to my place? Don't mind the crew, DP'll know when to cut!\n\n*grabs him*\n\nJ: Wait a min-\n\nB: LIGHTS!"
