        "text": "In this ugly-duckling comedy directed by Streisand and scripted by Richard LaGravenese (The Fisher King), Columbia professor Jeff Bridges is tired of sex and goes in search of a platonic relationship based on mutual respect and intelligence, setting his sights on marrying homely colleague Streisand. But romance without sex proves difficult in practice, not least when Streisandâ€™s catty mother Lauren Bacall subjects her to a makeover."
