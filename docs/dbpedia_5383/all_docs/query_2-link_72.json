        "text": "Academy Award, Emmy Award, Grammy Award, Golden Globe Award, Tony Award. At 28, Barbra Streisand had already won them all, the first female artist ever to do so. She is also the only winner ever to have won an Oscar in both a music and an acting category. Nearly half a century, she continues to be successful. Wow!\n\nAt the start of the 60s, Barbra Streisand had brief appearances in a pair of unsuccessful soundtracks / cast recordings. It is in 1963, when her proper debut LP was released, that she broke the main audience. The success never really left her. Through movies and albums, she was inevitable among the American entertainment industry for decades to come.\n\nHer trajectory followed the one of the music industry. Her early albums were issued only in English-speaking countries. Each of the soundtracks Funny Girl (1968), The Way We Were (1974) and A Star Is Born (1976) opened new markets to her. In 1980, the Barry Gibb-powered Guilty transformed Barbra Streisand into a global superstar.\n\nAs she started her career two decades before Madonna, Whitney Houston, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey, she is rarely mentioned into female rankings. It doesn’t mean she has not sell enough to be featured on them!\n\nChartMasters’ method: the CSPC\n\nAs usual, I’ll be using the Commensurate Sales to Popularity Concept (CSPC) in order to relevantly gauge the act’s results. It will not only bring you sales information for all albums, physical and download singles, as well as audio and video streaming. In fact, it will really determine the act’s popularity.\n\nIf you are not yet familiar with the CSPC method, below is a nice and short video of explaining the concept. I recommend watching it before reading on and to the sales figures. You’ll get the idea in just two minutes.\n\nAnd if you want to know the full method as well as formulas, you can read the full introduction article.\n\nNow let’s get into the artist’s detailed sales figures!\n\nBarbra Streisand’s original albums sales\n\nThe Barbra Streisand Album (1963)\n\nThe Second Barbra Streisand Album (1963)\n\nThe Third Album (1964)\n\nPeople (1964)\n\nMy Name Is Barbra (1965)\n\nMy Name Is Barbra, Two… (1965)\n\nColor Me Barbra (1966)\n\nJe m’appelle Barbra (1966)\n\nSimply Streisand (1967)\n\nAmerica\n\nUS – 525,000\n\nCanada – 40,000\n\nArgentina – N/A\n\nBrazil – N/A\n\nMexico – N/A\n\nAsia – N/A\n\nJapan – N/A\n\nOceania\n\nAustralia – N/A\n\nNew Zealand – N/A\n\nEurope – N/A\n\nUK – N/A\n\nFrance – N/A\n\nGermany – N/A\n\nItaly – N/A\n\nSpain – N/A\n\nSweden – N/A\n\nNetherlands – N/A\n\nSwitzerland – N/A\n\nAustria – N/A\n\nFinland – N/A\n\nWorld – 640,000\n\nA Christmas Album (1967)\n\nFunny Girl (Soundtrack) (1968)\n\nWhat About Today?

She started very strong, selling a million with all her LPs during a singles-axed era.\n\nShe had difficult years in 1969-1970, but she quickly recovered and then remained relevant ever since. Expectedly, Guilty emerges as the top seller with more than 13 million units sold. A Star Is Born, A Christmas Album, The Broadway Album and Higher Ground are all over 5 million units.\n\nA few more albums perform better than average. They include Soundtracks like Funny Girl, The Way We Were but also the likes Superman, Wet and Back to Broadway.\n\nAs for flops, there is hardly any. Out of 44 albums, only 4 sold under half a million units which in itself is incredible considering how extensive Streisand‘s catalog is.\n\nOne may say her sales aren’t that much global. It is true that the US is far and away her biggest market, accounting for 61,4 million of these sales, some 67% of the total. It is the way the industry was though, the same was true for most artists. Her debut album wasn’t even released in Asia, in Latin America or in continental Europe so obviously the US were going to represent the largest share of its sales! Once overseas markets started to be developed in mid-70s, Streisand did very well there. Guilty is the prime example since it sold only 43% of its units in the US.\n\n1963 The Barbra Streisand Album – 1,080,000\n\n1963 The Second Barbra Streisand Album – 1,130,000\n\n1964 The Third Album – 1,070,000\n\n1964 People – 1,260,000\n\n1965 My Name Is Barbra – 1,130,000\n\n1965 My Name Is Barbra, Two… – 1,470,000\n\n1966 Color Me Barbra – 860,000\n\n1966 Je m’appelle Barbra – 780,000\n\n1967 Simply Streisand – 640,000\n\n1967 A Christmas Album – 6,580,000\n\n1968 Funny Girl (Soundtrack) – 2,960,000\n\n1969 What About Today? – 430,000\n\n1969 Hello, Dolly! – 760,000\n\n1970 On a Clear Day You Can See Forever – 260,000\n\n1970 The Owl and the Pussycat – 120,000\n\n1971 Stoney End – 1,380,000\n\n1971 Barbra Joan Streisand – 1,120,000\n\n1971 Barbra Streisand…and Other Musical Instruments – 330,000\n\n1974 The Way We Were – 3,260,000\n\n1974 The Way We Were: Original Soundtrack Recording – 770,000\n\n1974 ButterFly – 1,240,000\n\n1975 Funny Lady – 1,260,000\n\n1975 Lazy Afternoon – 940,000\n\n1976 Classical Barbra – 730,000\n\n1976 A Star Is Born – 8,190,000\n\n1977 Superman – 2,720,000\n\n1978 Songbird – 1,790,000\n\n1979 The Main Event – 840,000\n\n1979 Wet – 2,770,000\n\n1980 Guilty – 13,140,000\n\n1983 Yentl – 3,500,000\n\n1984 Emotion – 1,960,000\n\n1985 The Broadway Album – 5,350,000\n\n1988 Till I Loved You – 2,550,000\n\n1993 Back to Broadway – 2,850,000\n\n1996 The Mirror Has Two Faces – 1,490,000\n\n1997 Higher Ground – 5,090,000\n\n1999 A Love Like Ours – 1,750,000\n\n2001 Christmas Memories – 1,370,000\n\n2003 The Movie Album – 1,150,000\n\n2005 Guilty Pleasures – 1,460,000\n\n2009 Love Is the Answer – 950,000\n\n2011 What Matters Most – 370,000\n\n2016 Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway – 520,000\n\nBarbra Streisand’s physical singles sales\n\nAs a reminder, the weighting is done with a 10 to 3 ratio between one album and one physical single.\n\n1963-69\n\nIronically, during the singles golden age, Streisand has sold mostly albums. Her only hit as a single was People from 1964, it sold over a million units. This was her only Top 30 hit in the US of the decade, it went as high as #5. At half a million sales comes Second Hand Rose, a hit in the UK and in the Netherlands. The remaining songs are all very moderate sellers.\n\nThe Barbra Streisand Album (1963) – 15,000 equivalent albums\n\nHappy Days Are Here Again – 30,000\n\nWho’s Afraid Of The Big Bad Wolf – 20,000\n\nThe Second Barbra Streisand Album (1963) – 12,000 equivalent albums\n\nMy Coloring Book – 30,000\n\nLove, Come Back to Me – 10,000\n\nThe Third Album (1964) – 3,000 equivalent albums\n\nBarbra Streisand – 10,000\n\nPeople (1964) – 375,000 equivalent albums\n\nPeople – 1,250,000\n\nMy Name Is Barbra (1965) – 114,000 equivalent albums\n\nWhy Did I Choose You? – 180,000\n\nMy Man – 200,000\n\nMy Name Is Barbra, Two… (1965) – 222,000 equivalent albums\n\nHe Touched Me – 240,000\n\nSecond Hand Rose – 500,000\n\nColor Me Barbra (1966) – 42,000 equivalent albums\n\nThe Minute Waltz – 10,000\n\nNon C’est Rien – 10,000\n\nWhere Am I Going? – 120,000\n\nJe m’appelle Barbra (1966) – 60,000 equivalent albums\n\nFree Again – 200,000\n\nSimply Streisand (1967) – ,000 equivalent albums\n\nLover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?) – 120,000\n\nStout-Hearted Men – 30,000\n\nA Christmas Album (1967) – 126,000 equivalent albums\n\nSilent Night / Ave Maria – 240,000\n\nMy Favorite Things / The Christmas Song – 30,000\n\nWhite Christmas / Jingle Bells – 140,000\n\nThe Lord’s Prayer / I Wonder As I Wander – 10,000\n\nFunny Girl (Soundtrack) (1968) – 120,000 equivalent albums\n\nMy Man / Don’t Rain On My Parade – 50,000\n\nFunny Girl – 350,000\n\nWhat About Today?

Streisand still achieved 2 million-sellers. The first one is Stoney End from 1971, a #6 hit in the US. Then The Way We Were sold a huge 1,85 million copies.

She wasn’t a consistent singles seller at all, but someway she managed to get at least one million seller in every era from 1976 to 1980.\n\nEvergreen sold nearly 3 million units. It was #1 for 3 weeks in the US, #1 too in Canada and Top 5 in Australia and the UK. You Don’t Bring Me Flowers, a duet with Neil Diamond, was #1 in the US too. It sold over 2 million units, just like the duet with Donna Summer, No More Tears (Enough Is Enough).\n\nThese impressive figures fall short of equaling the success of the Guilty era. The title track, a duet with Barry Gibb, sold 1,5 million units. Its blockbuster though is the cult single Woman In Love. The song was #1 in every relevant market, selling a whopping 6,26 million units in the process.\n\nA Star Is Born (1976) – 879,000 equivalent albums\n\nEvergreen – 2,930,000\n\nSuperman (1977) – 318,000 equivalent albums\n\nSuperman – 50,000\n\nMy Heart Belongs to Me – 1,010,000\n\nSongbird (1978) – 816,000 equivalent albums\n\nYou Don’t Bring Me Flowers – 2,270,000\n\nSongbird – 450,000\n\nThe Main Event (1979) – 336,000 equivalent albums\n\nThe Main Event/Fight – 1,120,000\n\nWet (1979) – 861,000 equivalent albums\n\nNo More Tears (Enough Is Enough) – 2,570,000\n\nKiss Me in the Rain – 280,000\n\nAin’t Gonna Cry Tonight – 10,000\n\nSplish Splash – 10,000\n\nGuilty (1980) – 2,559,000 equivalent albums\n\nGuilty – 1,550,000\n\nWoman in Love – 6,260,000\n\nPromises – 180,000\n\nWhat Kind of Fool – 520,000\n\nLife Story – 10,000\n\nThe Love Inside – 10,000\n\n1983-99\n\nFollowing Guilty, Streisand went back to more adult contemporary material. She hasn’t got a proper hit again until 1996’s single I Finally Found Someone which became her first Top 10 hit in 15 years.\n\nTell Him on its side became her first million seller in more than 15 years too. It did so in spite of not being physically released in the US, selling most of its units in the UK and in France.\n\nYentl (1983) – 135,000 equivalent albums\n\nPapa, Can You Hear Me? – 10,000\n\nThe Way He Makes Me Feel – 430,000\n\nNo Matter What Happens – 10,000\n\nEmotion (1984) – 177,000 equivalent albums\n\nEmotion – 90,000\n\nMake No Mistake, He’s Mine – 230,000\n\nLeft in the Dark – 270,000\n\nThe Broadway Album (1985) – 84,000 equivalent albums\n\nSend In the Clowns – 30,000\n\nSomewhere – 250,000\n\nTill I Loved You (1988) – 219,000 equivalent albums\n\nTill I Loved You – 660,000\n\nAll I Ask of You – 60,000\n\nWhat Were We Thinking Of – 10,000\n\nBack to Broadway (1993) – 33,000 equivalent albums\n\nThe Music of the Night – 20,000\n\nAs If We Never Said Goodbye – 50,000\n\nWith One Look – 40,000\n\nThe Mirror Has Two Faces (1996) – 255,000 equivalent albums\n\nI Finally Found Someone – 850,000\n\nHigher Ground (1997) – 342,000 equivalent albums\n\nTell Him – 1,140,000\n\nA Love Like Ours (1999) – 57,000 equivalent albums\n\nI’ve Dreamed of You – 140,000\n\nIf You Ever Leave Me – 50,000\n\n2001 onwards and orphan songs\n\nFrom 2001, Streisand barely released physical singles. Since the format was abandoned in the US by then it isn’t surprising.\n\nThrough the years, there has been several hits coming out from different compilations or live albums. The biggest seller of all is Memory at nearly 1,2 million, mostly thanks to its 700,000 sales in France.\n\nAll in all, the diva sold 35,25 million physical singles during her career.\n\nChristmas Memories (2001) – 0 equivalent albums\n\nNo single released\n\nThe Movie Album (2003) – 0 equivalent albums\n\nNo single released\n\nGuilty Pleasures (2005) – 6,000 equivalent albums\n\nStranger in a Strange Land – 10,000\n\nNight of My Life – 5,000\n\nCome Tomorrow – 5,000\n\nLove Is the Answer (2009) – 0 equivalent albums\n\nNo single released\n\nWhat Matters Most (2011) – 0 equivalent albums\n\nNo single released\n\nEncore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway (2016) – 0 equivalent albums\n\nNo single released\n\nOrphan – 1,063,000 equivalent albums\n\nSam, You Made The Pants Too Long – 90,000\n\nOur Corner of the Night – 150,000\n\nSweet Inspiration / Where You Lead – 320,000\n\nSing / Make Your Own Kind of Music – 130,000\n\nDidn’t We – 210,000\n\nPrisoner – 510,000\n\nComin’ In and Out of Your Life – 850,000\n\nMemory – 1,180,000\n\nWe’re Not Makin’ Love Anymore – 40,000\n\nSomeone That I Used to Love – 3,000\n\nPlaces That Belong to You – 60,000\n\nBarbra Streisand’s digital singles sales\n\nAs a reminder, the weighting is done with a 10 to 1,5 ratio between one album and one digital single.\n\nWith a dreadful total of 3,68 million digital sales, Barbra Streisand performs incredibly poorly there. While it comes to no surprise, the magnitude of these horrible results is still an issue. Even her stand-out classics like The Way We Were and Woman In Love fail to reach 1 million sales combined!\n\nThe Barbra Streisand Album (1963) – 5,000 equivalent albums\n\nAll tracks – 30,000\n\nThe Second Barbra Streisand Album (1963) – 3,000 equivalent albums\n\nAll tracks – 20,000\n\nThe Third Album (1964) – 12,000 equivalent albums\n\nIt Had to Be You – 80,000\n\nPeople (1964) – 10,000 equivalent albums\n\nPeople – 60,000\n\nRemaining tracks – 5,000\n\nMy Name Is Barbra (1965) – 6,000 equivalent albums\n\nAll tracks – 40,000\n\nMy Name Is Barbra, Two… (1965) – 3,000 equivalent albums\n\nAll tracks – 20,000\n\nColor Me Barbra (1966) – 1,000 equivalent albums\n\nAll tracks – under 10,000\n\nJe m’appelle Barbra (1966) – 1,000 equivalent albums\n\nAll tracks – under 10,000\n\nSimply Streisand (1967) – 1,000 equivalent albums\n\nAll tracks – under 10,000\n\nA Christmas Album (1967) – 10,000 equivalent albums\n\nAll tracks – 65,000\n\nFunny Girl (Soundtrack) (1968) – 20,000 equivalent albums\n\nDon’t Rain On My Parade – 100,000\n\nRemaining tracks – 30,000\n\nWhat About Today?

Our CSPC methodology now includes both to better reflect the real popularity of each track. The main source of data for each avenue is respectively Spotify and YouTube. As detailed in the Fixing Log article, Spotify represents 132 million of the 212 million users of streaming platforms, while YouTube is pretty much the only video platform generating some revenue for the industry. Below is the equivalence set on the aforementioned article:\n\nAudio Stream – 1500 plays equal 1 album unit\n\nVideo Stream – 11,750 views equal 1 album unit\n\nEquivalent Albums Sales (EAS) = 212/132 * Spotify streams / 1500 + YouTube views / 11750\n\nStreaming Part 1\n\nStreaming Part 2\n\nStreaming Part 3\n\nStreaming Part 4\n\nStreaming Part 5\n\nStreaming Part 6\n\nStreaming Part 7\n\nStreaming Part 8\n\nStreaming Part 9\n\nStreaming Part 10\n\nStreaming – Summary\n\nPlease note that all Spotify and YouTube numbers are expressed in millions. I added this summary table since numbers overall are so low that it was useless to go into in-depth comments for each era. This table lists her Top 20 streaming songs in Stream Equivalent Album (SEA).\n\nAt nearly 40,000 units is Woman In Love. The song is well supported by YouTube were it stands at 222 million views as per YouTube Insights. This tool was used since Barbra Streisand‘s fans-uploaded videos were recently removed to make space for her new official Vevo channel. On Spotify, the song is just under 20 million streams, a fairly weak figure for a ground breaking #1 single that remained her signature song.\n\nNumbers get worse and worse as we continue checking her songs. The only interesting part of this format is to know which songs remain the most popular. After Woman In Love, Tell Him is the runner up, no doubt helped by the presence of Celine Dion. Close behind are The Way We Were, I Finally Found Someone, Guilty and Memory.\n\nStreisand‘s trio of huge US #1 hits from late 70s all fail to get into her current Top 6. Evergreen, No More Tears and You Don’t Bring Me Flowers chart at #7, #8 and #9, respectively.\n\nBarbra Streisand’s full length related record sales\n\nIt sounds fairly logical to add together weighted sales of one era – studio album, physical singles, downloads, streams – to get the full picture of an album’s popularity. For older releases though, they also generate sales of various live, music videos and compilation albums.\n\nAll those packaging-only records do not create value, they exploit the value originating from the parent studio album of each of its tracks instead. Inevitably, when such compilations are issued, this downgrades catalog sales of the original LP. Thus, to perfectly gauge the worth of these releases, we need to re-assign sales proportionally to its contribution of all the compilations which feature its songs. The following table explains this method.\n\nHow to understand this table? If you check this example of Greatest Hits, those figures mean it sold 3,700,000 units worldwide. The second statistics column means all versions of all the songs included on this package add for 16,275 equivalent album sales from streams of all types.\n\nThe second part at the right of the table shows how many streams are coming from each original album plus the share it represents on the overall package streams. Thus, streaming figures tell us Funny Girl songs are responsible for 43% of the Greatest Hits tracklist attractiveness, which means it generated 1,595,000 of its 3,700,000 album sales. We will now apply this concept to all her compilations, live albums, music videos and EPs.\n\nMajor Compilations – without Woman In Love\n\nThe discography of Streisand is atypical for one reason: her top selling compilations do not include her biggest hit. Her Top 2 sellers are Greatest Hits Vol 2 which pre-dates the era Guilty, thus excluding Woman In Love, and Memories, a compilation released just after Guilty as a complementary item rather than a replacement item, thus also excluding the 1980 global #1 song.\n\nIt raises one big question, which songs, and by extension which studio albums, provided their appeal?\n\nPackages which cover her 60s songs (Greatest Hits and Live at the Forum) are by both People and Funny Girl. Greatest Hits Vol 2, Memories and its UK-version Love Songs cover her 70s material. They are powered by songs from most 1974-1979 albums since almost all of them included million selling singles. The strongest of them is The Way We Were which was indeed a huge catalog seller until 1977, before being cannibalized by the best of set from 1978.\n\nMajor Compilations post-82 – without Woman In Love still!\n\nHere comes a big surprise! Although Woman In Love was already released, most of her major selling compilation-like albums excluded it. How is this possible?\n\nThe singer made no secret that she didn’t liked the song as she disagrees with its lyrics. This pushed her to avoid singing it live. That’s why the song isn’t part of live packages One Voice and The Concert. Her duets-themed compilations also excluded it since the song is a solo track.\n\nThe album Guilty still provides a nice help to these albums thanks to its title track. Then, The Way We Were appears to be always strongest among the discography of the artist. We are starting to wonder what’s her real big era!\n\nMajor Compilations – with Woman In Love\n\nWhile major compilations without Woman In Love managed to sell 33 million units collectively, the ones with this song stand at less than 8 million. They are A Collection…, a best of from 1989 which can almost be regarded as a reissue of Guilty since it exploits mostly its songs. The second one is The Essential, the first true career-spanning compilation, the first one which puts together songs like The Way We Were, Evergreen and Woman In Love, although it excludes Guilty.\n\nThe following pages will include sales of all her full length records which haven’t been posted so far, although with no comments as these packages follow the same patterns as the ones presented here.\n\nCompilations – Part 4\n\nCompilations – Part 5\n\nCompilations – Part 6\n\nCompilations – Part 7\n\nCompilations – Part 8\n\nCompilations – Part 9\n\nCompilations – Part 10\n\nCompilations – Part 11\n\nCompilations – Part 12\n\nCompilations – Part 13\n\nFull Length related records Sales – Summary\n\nHere is the most underestimated indicator of an album’s success – the amount of compilation sales of all kinds it generated. Due to the dependency of sales of the original studio albums on these releases, they are a key piece of the jigsaw.\n\nThe Way We Were isn’t among Barbra Streisand‘s Top 5 selling studio albums. Its run was stopped too early with the competitive compilation Greatest Hits Vol 2. The album is huge though as it is responsible for sales of more than 10 million best of and live records!\n\nNaturally, Guilty, A Star Is Born, Songbird, People and Funny Girl all boosted sales of plenty of compilations too. While some of them aren’t strong sellers in pure album sales, they are highly valuable additions to Streisand‘s catalog.\n\nBONUS: Compilation Albums Sales\n\nGreatest Hits (1970)\n\nAmerica\n\nUS – 2,600,000\n\nCanada – 300,000\n\nArgentina – N/A\n\nBrazil – N/A\n\nMexico – N/A\n\nAsia – N/A\n\nJapan – N/A\n\nOceania\n\nAustralia – 60,000\n\nNew Zealand – N/A\n\nEurope – N/A\n\nUK – 200,000\n\nFrance – N/A\n\nGermany – N/A\n\nItaly – N/A\n\nSpain – N/A\n\nSweden – N/A\n\nNetherlands – N/A\n\nSwitzerland – N/A\n\nAustria – N/A\n\nFinland – N/A\n\nWorld – 3,700,000\n\nGreatest Hits Vol 2 (1978)\n\nMemories (1981)\n\nOne Voice (1987)\n\nAmerica\n\nUS – 1,900,000\n\nCanada – 150,000\n\nArgentina – N/A\n\nBrazil – N/A\n\nMexico – N/A\n\nAsia – 50,000\n\nJapan – 25,000\n\nOceania\n\nAustralia – 65,000\n\nNew Zealand – 20,000\n\nEurope – 620,000\n\nUK – 125,000\n\nFrance – N/A\n\nGermany – 100,000\n\nItaly – N/A\n\nSpain – 30,000\n\nSweden – 20,000\n\nNetherlands – 140,000\n\nSwitzerland – N/A\n\nAustria – N/A\n\nFinland – N/A\n\nWorld – 2,860,000\n\nA Collection – Greatest Hits And More (1989)\n\nThe Concert (1994)\n\nThe Essential (2002)\n\nPartners (2014)\n\nAmerica\n\nUS – 1,025,000\n\nCanada – 80,000\n\nArgentina – N/A\n\nBrazil – 7,000\n\nMexico – N/A\n\nAsia – N/A\n\nJapan – N/A\n\nOceania\n\nAustralia – 75,000\n\nNew Zealand – 12,500\n\nEurope – 550,000\n\nUK – 385,000\n\nFrance – 7,500\n\nGermany – 60,000\n\nItaly – 4,000\n\nSpain – 6,000\n\nSweden – N/A\n\nNetherlands – 25,000\n\nSwitzerland – 2,500\n\nAustria – 5,000\n\nFinland – N/A\n\nWorld – 1,800,000\n\nBONUS: Total Album (all types) Sales per Country\n\nAmerica\n\nUS – 88,850,000\n\nCanada – 7,240,000\n\nArgentina – N/A\n\nBrazil – N/A\n\nMexico – N/A\n\nAsia – 2,910,00\n\nJapan – 1,155,000\n\nOceania\n\nAustralia – 3,380,000\n\nNew Zealand – 670,000\n\nEurope – 27,300,000\n\nUK – 10,460,000\n\nFrance – 3,460,000\n\nGermany – 2,405,000\n\nItaly – 1,250,000\n\nSpain – 1,480,000\n\nSweden – 780,000\n\nNetherlands – 2,205,000\n\nSwitzerland – 405,000\n\nAustria – 315,000\n\nFinland – 275,000\n\nWorld – 138,610,000\n\nPlease note that some of the countries totals may be slightly incomplete when the figure is N/A for minor releases.

Well, at this point we hardly need to add up all of the figures defined in this article!\n\nIn the following results table, all categories display figures in equivalent album sales. If different, pure sales are listed between parentheses.\n\n'Av.' stands for Average, 'LD' for Last Day.\n\nAs a reminder:\n\nStudio Album: sales of the original album\n\nOther Releases: sales of compilations generated thanks to the album\n\nPhysical Singles: sales of physical singles from the album (ratio 3/10)\n\nDownload Singles: sales of digital singles from the album (ratio 1,5/10)\n\nStreaming: equivalent album sales of all the album tracks (ratio 1/1500 for Audio stream and 1/6750 for Video stream)\n\nArtist career totals\n\nSee where the artist ranks among remaining singers\n\nGuilty is Streisand’s most successful era to date with 23 million equivalent album sales generated in total. This result was expected, but what follows it wasn’t.\n\nBoth A Star Is Born and The Way We Were are around 15 million units, both stunning totals. It is especially impressive for the latter which sold a relatively low 3,26 million pure album units.\n\nThis strong podium is followed by 7 albums with a popularity very similar. In descending order albums ranking from #4 to #10 among the artist’s catalog are The Broadway Album, Songbird, A Christmas Album, Funny Girl, Higher Ground, Wet and People. They all moved from 5 to 7 million equivalent album sales. With 10, Barbra Streisand is the second female singer with the most 5 million-plus units eras, topped only by Madonna at 13. These eras span a record-breaking 33 years.\n\nIn total, Streisand has 30 albums with 1 million equivalent album sales or more and 9 additional ones between 500,000 and 1 million units. A remarkable career.\n\nOverall, she is up to 152,5 million equivalent albums sales, a superb figure that puts her undoubtedly among the Top 5 most successful female vocalists of all-time.\n\nThe following sections list her most successful songs as well as her records and achievements.\n\nAs usual, feel free to comment and / or ask a question!\n\nSources: IFPI, Spotify, YouTube, Chartmasters.org.\n\nBIGGEST TRACKS – Barbra Streisand\n\nThe list of most successful songs is compiled in album equivalent sales generated by each of them.
