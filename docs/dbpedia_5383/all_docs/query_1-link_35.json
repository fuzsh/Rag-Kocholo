        "text": "Inciting Event: Traumatized by a bad romance, Professor Gregory Larkin posts a personal ad stating that “physical appearance” is “not important.” Rose’s sister (who is already dissatisfied with her handsome new husband) answers the phone in response to the ad and passes the contact info on to her.\n\nFirst Plot Point: Rose marries Gregory, despite her mounting fears at his revelation that he wants sex either rarely or not at all, so that it won’t ruin their blooming connection and friendship.\n\nFirst Pinch Point: At the park, Rose sees happy couples everywhere, romancing each other, while Gregory works on his book. Her ex, whomt she was avoiding at the beginning of the movie, runs into her and introduces her to his blushing fiancée, “who doesn’t cancel” on him as Rose consistently did.\n\nMidpoint: Rose initiates sex, as cautiously as she can, and Gregory almost goes for it, but then his trauma from the past overtakes him and he feels betrayed she would put their relationship at risk. Rose leaves to stay the night with her mother, who has always demeaned her. An argument between them leads to her mother’s soul-searching. The next morning, her mother reveals she always knew Rose was the most beautiful of her two daughters, but the little things she’d told her growing up had made her believe—and look—otherwise.\n\nSecond Pinch Point: Gregory goes to Europe on a book tour. Rose hatches a plan to set things straight. She works out, diets, and gets a makeover while Gregory is gone, ignoring all his phone calls and messages. When he returns, she surprises him with the new sexier version of herself, but again he feels betrayed. Rose sees she’s been lying to herself and leaves him.\n\nThird Plot Point: Gregory’s heart begins to ache for Rose, and he finds the pain of losing her rivals the pain of being used by his ex.\n\nRose’s brother-in-law separates from his wife (Rose’s sister) and strikes up a fling with Rose, where she soon learns that while she always wished she had been good enough for him, the truth is that Rose is too good for Alex.\n\nClimax: Rose now has no romantic prospects, but she has self-respect, and Gregory in desperation comes back to her apartment in the middle of the night, waking the residents with his insistence upon seeing her, which leads to a scuffle with the doorman.\n\nClimactic Moment: Gregory has finally come around to falling in love with his best friend, Rose. She meets him out in the street, they kiss as the sun rises, and they dance while an awakened resident makes the best of the situation and serenades them from an unseen window with a surprisingly good solo of “Nessun Dorma.”\n\nResolution: And they lived happily ever after.\n\n(Submitted by Aaron McCausland.)"
