        "text": "After the passing of Lauren Bacall on Tuesday, Barbra Streisand remembered her on-screen partner and friend. The two entertainment icons co-starred in the 1996 romantic comedy “The Mirror Has Two Faces,” for which Bacall earned her only Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress.\n\n“What a terrible loss for us all,” Streisand said in a statement. “First Robin [Williams], who was a genius, and now Lauren. It was my privilege to have known her, to have acted with her and to have directed her. And, most of all, to have had her as a wise and loving friend.”\n\nSee video: Lauren Bacall’s Movie Legacy: 5 Performances You Might Have Missed\n\nComedian and Oscar-winning actor Robin Williams died Monday (Aug. 11) of an apparent suicide. Bacall died today (Aug. 12) from a stroke. She was 89.\n\nBacall portrayed the overbearing mother of Barbra Streisand‘s English lit professor who struggled to find love with the emotionless Jeff Bridges in “The Mirror Has Two Faces.” The two powerhouse actresses clashed perfectly in the winning comedy, with Bacall coming out on top for the pure entertainment value of her scathing and narcissistic performance.\n\nSee photos: 11 Lauren Bacall Movies That Shaped Hollywood’s Golden Age\n\n“She was an original,” Streisand said of Bacall. “Even with all those great films we can visit again and again, she will be missed.”"
