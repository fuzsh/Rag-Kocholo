        "text": "With an acceptance rate of 5.9%, you might be fooled into thinking that Duke is in the Ivy League. It’s not—it’s just a really good school.\n\nOf the nearly 50,000 Duke hopefuls who apply each year, 94% are denied admission. To avoid being one of them, you’ll need more than good grades and a few extracurricular accolades.\n\nYou’ll need a smart application strategy.\n\nIn this post, I’ll guide you through finding an application narrative that will increase your chances of admission. Our team of former admissions officers and professional writers has helped students just like you get into Duke, and these are some of our best-kept secrets.\n\nAre you ready to get started? Let’s get to it.\n\nHow to Apply to Duke University\n\nAs with most colleges, you can apply to Duke directly through the Common Application. If the Coalition Application is more your style, you can apply that way, too.\n\nEither way, you’ll need those application essentials: background information, extracurricular activities list, personal statement, high school transcript, school report, and letters of recommendation.\n\nYou’ll also need to complete the Duke supplement. And if you want, you can submit your standardized test scores and apply for an alumni admissions interview.\n\nDuke Application Options\n\nYou’ve got two options when applying to Duke: Early Decision or Regular Decision. No Early Action—sorry!\n\nEarly Decision is, of course, binding. That means if you get in, you’re going—no backing out (with a few exceptions, like financial aid). But as we know from our Duke Common Data Set post, applying ED may just increase your chances of admission by about 10%.\n\nIf you’re not ready to commit, then you should apply Regular Decision.\n\nDuke Application Deadlines\n\nEarly Decision: November 1\n\nRegular Decision: January 3*\n\n*The Duke website does note that December 20th is the priority deadline for the student portion of your application if you want to have a better chance of scoring an alumni interview.\n\nHow hard is it to get into Duke?\n\nAt a 5.9% admit rate, this should go without saying. Getting into Duke is hard. That’s just the cold, hard, North Carolinian truth.\n\nTo put things in perspective, Duke’s acceptance rate is lower than that of UChicago, Dartmouth, and Johns Hopkins. It’s only 0.6% higher than Yale’s and right on par with UPenn’s. Especially if you’re applying to a more popular major, your application will need to be on its A-game.\n\nWhat does Duke University look for in applicants?\n\nSadly, you can’t just make your Common App account, write your essays, and hit submit. You need to think strategically about what your application is communicating to your Duke admissions officer.\n\nWe call this approach your “application narrative.” Think of it like your own personal brand. When Duke admissions members read your application, what do you want them to come away thinking of you? (Hint: It should probably be something related to Duke’s institutional values.)\n\nAnd therein lies the key. Your application narrative should be authentic, but it should also send an underlying message to Duke admissions officers that Duke is exactly where you belong.\n\nSo how do you do that? You communicate that message through your essays and activities. And to do that well, you need to look at Duke’s values.\n\nThankfully, the Duke admissions office has made your life easier. They have a whole page that breaks down what they’re looking for in applicants.\n\nHere are some of the adjectives they use to describe successful applicants:\n\nIntelligent\n\nCreative\n\nEnthusiastic\n\nAmbitious\n\nCurious\n\nTalented\n\nPersistent\n\nEnergetic\n\nHuman\n\nThink of these adjectives as values. How can your application show that you’re an intelligent, creative, enthusiastic, ambitious, curious, talented, persistent, energetic, and straight-up human person? That’s where you begin.\n\nDuke GPA requirement\n\nDuke doesn’t have a GPA requirement, per se. But your GPA can help you determine whether you’ll be a competitive applicant in Duke’s pool.\n\nWhile the Duke Common Data Set doesn’t give us specifics about applicant GPAs, we do learn that of the enrolled first-year students who reported class rank, 80% ranked in the top 10th. That means that they had perfect or near-perfect GPAs.\n\nSo if your unweighted GPA is less than about a 3.75, you’ll probably be a less competitive applicant to Duke. Of course, GPA isn’t the only factor that Duke’s admissions officers consider, but it is one of the most important.\n\nDuke SAT Scores\n\nAs of the 2022-2023 admissions cycle, Duke is still test-optional, so you’re not required to submit any scores at all.\n\nThat said, we know from the Duke Common Data Set that Duke highly values test scores in the admissions evaluation process, so you should probably submit them if you can.\n\nSo what’s a good test score for Duke? To answer that question, we’ll need to look at Duke’s middle 50% score range. Here it is, taken from their Common Data Set:\n\nSAT Composite: 1490-1560\n\nACT Composite: 33-35\n\nSince these are the scores within which 50% of Duke’s enrolling first-year class fell, you’ll want to aim for a score within these ranges to be competitive.\n\nDoes Duke superscore?\n\nYep—Duke superscores. Your composite SAT or ACT score will come from your highest scores in each individual section, even if you got those scores on different dates. Nobody’s perfect all the time, so superscoring can make a huge difference in your test scores and let you relax a little come test day.\n\nWhat high school course work do I need to get into Duke University?\n\nDuke comes right out and says it: “Enroll in the best available and most challenging courses.”\n\nHere’s what they recommend your coursework look like:\n\nEnglish: 4 years\n\nMath: 3+ years\n\nSciences: 3+ years\n\nForeign language: 3+ years\n\nSocial studies: 3+ years\n\nIf you’re planning on applying to engineering, you should probably take calculus and physics. And when you opt to take three years in a subject instead of four, be sure that the course you’re taking instead is still an academic solid—that is, it still falls into one of the major categories of English, math, sciences, language, or social studies.\n\nIn all cases, you should be taking the most rigorous courses you can. Rigor looks different at different schools. Some schools have tons of AP or IB options, and some only have a few. Others have dual-enrollment classes with a local community college, and others yet have their own honors programs.\n\nWhatever your school looks like, your Duke admissions officer will evaluate how much you’ve challenged yourself given what your school offers. So make the most of what’s available to you.\n\nWhat extracurriculars do I need to get into Duke University?\n\nTo answer this question, let’s return again to Duke’s admissions website because I like their wording. They say that they value “well-rounded” as well as “well-lopsided” applicants who have impacted their communities and will continue to impact the Duke community.\n\nSo what do “well-rounded” and “well-lopsided” mean?\n\nIn short, these are two ways you can approach your extracurriculars.\n\nLet’s start with “well-rounded.” You’ve probably heard the term before. It means that you haven’t pigeonholed yourself into one thing. Instead, you’ve spread yourself out across different areas of interest, and you’ve given them all your best effort. That might mean that you’re a varsity athlete but also in your school’s chamber orchestra. Or maybe you’re a watercolor artist and a robotics champion. Well-rounded means that you have some narrative diversity.\n\n“Well-lopsided,” on the other hand, is almost the opposite. I like Duke’s phrase because it validates that some students have one main passion that they go all-in on. For some students, doing one thing really well works out a lot better than trying to do everything all at once. Well-lopsided might look like a drama student who participates in their school's productions, does community theatre on the side, and teaches at a theatre camp for kids in the summers. Or maybe you’re an award-winning classical pianist who dedicates six hours a day to practicing. If you’re well-lopsided, your narrative is deep rather than diverse.\n\nNo matter your extracurricular approach, be sure to write about the impact, reach, and magnitude of each of your activities. (For more details on what that means, check out our extracurricular activities strategy post.)\n\nFinal Takeaways\n\nAnd with all that, you’re ready to formulate your Duke application strategy. Remember that at the heart of any good application strategy is the ability to balance your weaknesses with your strengths. Finding your alignment with Duke’s values as you create your application narrative can make all the difference."
