        "text": "Duke Admissions Information\n\nDuke University\n\nDurham, North Carolina (map)\n\nJust a few hours from both the beach and the Appalachian Mountains, Duke University provides students with a stimulating and challenging academic environment. Since it was founded in 1924, Duke has become world-renowned as a top research university with multi-talented students. The school is proud of its diverse community and commitment to real-world learning experiences designed to enhance each student's education. Through DukeEngage, for example, select students are given funding to volunteer for a summer of service, immersed in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nUndergraduate students apply to one of two colleges, the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences, or the Pratt School of Engineering. Between the two colleges, more than 40 majors are offered, including the option for students to self-design a new major. Approximately 90% of undergraduate classes have fewer than 35 students, just another way in which Duke offers a personalized education that emphasizes student participation. Set on 8,600 beautiful acres, Duke is divided into West, East and Central campuses, all of which are connected by a free bus service and each of which has its own distinct architecture.\n\nBasic Info\n\nMain Address: 2138 Campus Drive\n\nBox 90586\n\nDurham, NC 27708-0586 Phone Number: (919) 684-3214 Website: https://www.duke.edu/\n\nCharacteristics\n\nType of school: Private, Coed Type of school: United Methodist Church affiliation Setting: Suburban Athletics: NCAA Division I, Intercollegiate, Intramural, Club, Scholarship Degrees offered: Bachelor's, Master's, Doctoral Size of undergraduate student body: 6,578 Percent out-of-state: 85% Percent international: 4% Female to Male ratio: 49:51\n\nAcademic Life\n\nStudent to Professor ratio: 11:1 Most popular majors: Social Sciences\n\nEngineering\n\nPsychology\n\nBiology\n\nPublic Administration and Social Services Special study programs: Cross-Registration\n\nDistance Learning\n\nHonors Program\n\nIndependent Study\n\nInternships\n\nNew York Semester\n\nROTC (Air Force, Army, Navy)\n\nSemester At Sea\n\nStudent-Designed Major\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nTeacher Certification\n\nVisiting/Exchange Student Program\n\nWashington Semester\n\nCampus Life\n\nHousing options:\n\nCoed housing\n\nWomen's housing\n\nSpecial housing for disabled students Men's housing\n\nApartments for single students\n\nWellness housing (alcohol/drug/smoke-free)\n\nActivities:\n\nCampus Ministries\n\nConcert Band\n\nDrama\n\nFraternities\n\nJazz Band\n\nMarching Band\n\nMusical Theater\n\nPep Band\n\nSororities\n\nStudent Newspaper\n\nTelevision Station Choral Groups\n\nDance\n\nFilm Societies\n\nInternational Students\n\nLiterary Magazine\n\nMusic Ensembles\n\nOpera\n\nRadio Station\n\nStudent Government\n\nSymphony Orchestra\n\nYearbook\n\nFun Facts\n\nAdmissions Information\n\nAs a highly competitive and prestigious university, Duke attracts a competitive pool of applicants, who are often in the top 10 percent of their high school class. The admissions committee recommends completing four years of English and at least three years of math, science, a foreign language and social studies. In addition, admissions officials highly encourage students to take advanced courses while in high school, whenever possible, and to participate in extracurricular commitments that make a real difference in some way.\n\nDespite a focus on a rigorous curriculum, test scores and recommendations, Duke is not looking for perfection in its students. The admissions office is searching for applicants that make intelligent and interesting decisions, but who are not afraid to err occasionally. In particular, students who understand the value of failure and are able to learn from their mistakes are encouraged to express this in their personal statements.\n\nAdmissions address: 2138 Campus Drive\n\nBox 90586\n\nDurham, NC 27708-0586\n\nUnited States Phone number: (919) 684-3214 Fax number: (919) 681-8941 Admissions Website: https://admissions.duke.edu/ Email: undergrad-admissions@duke.edu Contact Person: Christoph Guttentag, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Number of first-year applications received: 18,774 Percent of applicants admitted: 19%\n\nApplication Information\n\nRegular application deadline: January 2 Early decision/action deadline: Early Decision, November 1 Accepts the Common Application?
