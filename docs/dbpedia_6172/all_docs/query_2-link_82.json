        "text": "On a mission to bring students the best possible experience on campus, Duke University is at the forefront of integrating cutting-edge technology to its schoolwide services. And by leveraging the strength, security, and ubiquity of Apple devices, Duke is delivering a modern experience to its community.\n\nEvery day, the university receives about 100,000 people — students, faculty, staff, and visitors — who live and work in more than 250 buildings that span over 8,600 acres. In fact, Duke’s bustling campus in Durham, North Carolina, can seem almost like a microcosm of a small city. Only in this city, everything must work together seamlessly and securely.\n\nNow, Duke has updated one of its most important services — its physical student ID card, the DukeCard — by adding it to Student ID in Apple Wallet on iPhone. With Student ID, Duke students can access services across campus using the devices they already know, use, love, and carry with them at all times.\n\nWith a simple tap of iPhone or Apple Watch, students can securely access dorm rooms, buy food, wash clothing, attend sports events, and more. With this added convenience, students can focus on what’s really important: learning and preparing for the leadership roles of tomorrow."
