        "text": "When Monsters Speak: A Susan Stryker Reader\n\nby Susan Stryker. Edited by McKenzie Wark\n\n“Whenever Susan Stryker speaks, I listen. Stryker’s career is one of those that has altered the way that those of us who came after her think—and live our lives. We are so lucky to now have a collection that allows us to trace her thoughts over her own life.”—Torrey Peters\n\nShadow of My Shadow\n\nJennifer Doyle\n\n“Jennifer Doyle’s Shadow of My Shadow rigorously inhabits and analyzes places that many of us feel averse to but that structure and shape our institutions and sometimes our greater lives. The result is a probing, risk-taking, distinctive study that aids its readers in better understanding ‘complaint pathology and the paranoid character of nearly all discourse about harassment’ and helps us fathom ‘what we lose when harassment ecologies consume us’—and what we might gain by living elsewise.” - Maggie Nelson, author of Like Love: Essays and Conversations\n\nOpen Admissions\n\nDanica Savonick\n\n“Danica Savonick outlines how the open admissions period at City University of New York made an important impact on university education and provided a crucial template for the next moves in educational liberation. She models how to reactivate Toni Cade Bambara, June Jordan, Audre Lorde, and Adrienne Rich as our teachers in a moment where an in-depth understanding of their pedagogical choices can impact how we teach today.” - Alexis Pauline Gumbs, author of Survival Is a Promise: The Eternal Life of Audre Lorde\n\nHow We Write Now\n\nJennifer C. Nash\n\n“Jennifer C. Nash's brilliant monograph embraces what Christina Sharpe described as ‘beauty as a method,’ through which she delivers with stunning erudition and heart-rending intimacy what it means to theorize Black life in the twenty-first century. Nash provides an essential Black feminist rejoinder to the orthodoxy of Afropessism by insisting that Black women refuse to be defined and dehumanized by Black death. Rather, their long history of cultivating beauty, intimacy, care, and affection is a fierce and rigorous practice of Black survival and enduring humanity.” - Tina M. Campt, author of A Black Gaze: Artists Changing How We See\n\nSelected Writings on Visual Arts and Culture\n\nStuart Hall\n\n“This collection corrects the widespread misperception that Stuart Hall’s late-career art writings were a mere add-on to the heavy lifting accomplished by his 1970s work on Marxism and sociology. Gilane Tawadros’s panoramic selection reveals how extensively Hall turned his attention to art, photography, film, museums, and architecture to examine questions of diaspora, identity, and globalization. This volume is of enormous significance.” - Kobena Mercer, author of Travel & See: Black Diaspora Art Practices since the 1980s\n\nSovereignty and Extortion\n\nClaudio Lomnitz\n\n“Composing a historical, economic, political, and judicial panorama of the forms of violence in Mexico today, Claudio Lomnitz reformulates a theory of the state that takes on a special relevance. Contrary to the idea of loss of state sovereignty in the face of neoliberalism, Lomnitz shows how state sovereignty is reinforced through militarization and the concentration of power in the presidency.” - Verónica Gago, author of Feminist International: How to Change Everything\n\nThe Gospel of John Marrant\n\nAlphonso F. Saville IV\n\n“Offering new perspectives on eighteenth-century Black religious sensibilities in worlds of encounter and transformation, this exciting book reframes understandings of early Black Atlantic religion. Alphonso F. Saville IV uses John Marrant’s life to demonstrate a much more complex religious world of Black Christianity, leaving readers with new ways of understanding the results for Black people of religious encounter and the emergence of New World Africana religious ways of being. This approach is among the most exciting in the field.” - Judith Weisenfeld, author of New World A-Coming: Black Religion and Racial Identity during the Great Migration\n\nMarx for Cats\n\nLeigh Claire La Berge\n\n“Marx for Cats is an undomesticated and indefinable meow de coeur. You can open this book anywhere---it's a Marxist Choose Your Own Adventure---and come away as unsettled, possessed, and reflective as any transportative encounter with a cat might leave you.” - Jordy Rosenberg, author of Confessions of the Fox\n\nIn the Wake\n\nChristina Sharpe\n\n\"Christina Sharpe brings everything she has to bear on her consideration of the violation and commodification of Black life and the aesthetic responses to this ongoing state of emergency. Through her curatorial practice, Sharpe marshals the collective intellectual heft and aesthetic inheritance of the African diaspora to show us the world as it appears from her distinctive line of sight. A searing and brilliant work.\" - Saidiya Hartman, author of Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route\n\nBlack Disability Politics\n\nSami Schalk\n\n“Black disabled genius is crucial to the work of creating a free present and future. In Black Disability Politics, Sami Schalk does so much absolutely brilliant Black queer disabled femme labor of surfacing buried Black disabled activist histories and organizing lessons. Her book is a Black queer disabled love offering, and reading it made me shout for joy and learn so much. I’m so grateful this book is in the world. Read it and give thanks that we get to share the world with the brilliance of Schalk and the organizers she writes about—then get to work putting into practice the lessons you’ve learned, so we can win.” - Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, author of Care Work: Dreaming Disability Justice\n\nRaving\n\nMcKenzie Wark\n\n“Passionately exploring queer rave culture, Raving is the fantasy and the moment. There are drugs and sex, tangled love affairs, rejection, the highs and lows of the dance floors, and all the messiness that makes up a rave evening. A potent book.” - madison moore, author of Fabulous: The Rise of the Beautiful Eccentric\n\nLiving a Feminist Life\n\nSara Ahmed\n\n“From the moment I received Sara Ahmed’s new work, Living a Feminist Life, I couldn’t put it down. It’s such a brilliant, witty, visionary new way to think about feminist theory. Everyone should read this book. It offers amazing new ways of knowing and talking about feminist theory and practice. And, it is also delightful, funny, and as the song says, ‘your love has lifted me higher.’ Ahmed lifts us higher.” - bell hooks\n\nliquid blackness\n\nAlessandra Raengo, Lauren McLeod Cramer\n\nliquid blackness seeks to carve out a place for aesthetic theory and the most radical agenda of Black studies to come together in productive ways, with the goal of attending to the aesthetic work of blackness and the political work of form."
