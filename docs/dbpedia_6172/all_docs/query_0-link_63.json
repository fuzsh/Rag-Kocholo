Duke established The Duke Endowment to fund hospitals, orphanages, the Methodist Church, three colleges, and a university built around Trinity College. The college was renamed Duke University in honor of the Duke family.\n\nToday, Duke spends more than $1 billion per year on research, making it one of the ten largest research universities in the United States.\n\nThe Lodge at Duke Medical Center welcomes thousands of guests each year visiting Duke for business or pleasure. Our hotel is less than a mile away from Duke University, Duke Medical Center, Duke Chapel, Cameron Indoor Stadium and Wallace Wade Stadium."
