        "text": "Duke School believes economic diversity enriches the educational opportunity for all families and participation of a wide range of families is critical to the health of the school.\n\nBecause the school is determined to make a Duke School education accessible to families from a wide range of economic backgrounds, the school charges a range of tuitions based on family need.\n\nIndexed Tuition\n\nEvery family is expected to contribute to the cost of tuition and fees, thereby supporting the community to the extent family circumstances permit. Among our families are those who can afford tuition at the top of the index and whose philanthropic generosity provides a vital component of annual operating expenses.\n\nThere are also families who manage to pay tuition at the highest level only by making a substantial sacrifice, those who are able to afford only minimal tuition, and those across the spectrum in between.\n\nTo help us objectively assess what a family is able to contribute to education expenses, Duke School uses figures from Clarity a trusted third party, as the baseline for our Indexed Tuition determinations. We also take into consideration our school's policies and the resources available for returning students as well as applicant families.\n\nNotification of tuition determinations will be released on the same schedule as admission decision letters. Although decisions about admission and indexed tuition are made at the same time, the two processes are separate. All financial information you provide will be held in strict confidence.\n\nApplications for Indexed Tuition are currently open. For more information about tuition terms and conditions, click here.\n\nDuke School follows best practices in financial aid policies as determined by the National Association of Independent Schools. As such, all guardians of the applicant must fill out an application, either as one application or separate applications.\n\nWe appreciate your interest in Duke School and Indexed Tuition. Please contact Admissions (919) 416-9420, if you have any questions."
