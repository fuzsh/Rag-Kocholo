        "text": "Hidden players in climate change: How microscopic proteins could shape our future\n\nIn the narrative about climate change, we often focus on the big and visible—like shrinking glaciers and churning hurricanes. But there's another world, microscopic and hidden, that's just as crucial and the focus of a ...\n\nA camera trap for the invisible—a solution to difficult pattern recognition problem in experimental particle physics\n\nIt sounds fantastical, but it's a reality for the scientists who work at the world's largest particle collider.\n\nA mixed approach to reforestation is better than planting or regeneration alone, study finds\n\nReforestation in low- and middle-income countries can remove up to 10 times more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a lower cost than previously estimated, making this a potentially more important option to fight climate ...\n\nDiscovery of Piezo1's new signaling mechanism may aid search for better pain and itch treatments\n\nThe human body's sense of touch is so important it can be found throughout the body, not just on the skin. Two tiny sensors of touch, Piezo1 and Piezo2, signal the lightest pressures and can be found monitoring the circulatory ...\n\nBlack Americans develop mental resilience to discrimination early\n\nNo one likes to feel like they're not getting the respect or courtesy they deserve. Think about the last time you felt patronized, or treated as inferior, or received worse customer service than another person in line.\n\nBuilding a prototype of the cosmos\n\nHow would it feel to peer into the night sky and behold millions of galaxies across a vast swath of space? What would it be like to hunt for worlds beyond our solar system, or spot the fiery deaths of stars?\n\nFor many urban residents, it's even hotter than their weather app says\n\nThere's a strong chance that last week's scorching temperatures were even hotter than reported for those living in underserved urban areas.\n\nProtected areas can boost biodiversity and local economies\n\nProtected areas, like nature reserves, can conserve biodiversity without harming local economic growth, countering a common belief that conservation restricts development. A new study outlines what is needed for conservation ...\n\nHarnessing ecological theory for successful ecosystem restoration\n\nScientists have created a research framework to incorporate ecological theory—mathematical models and concepts to understand interactions and dynamics of ecosystems—into ecosystem management and planning to more effectively ...\n\nSilkworms help grow better organ-like tissues in labs\n\nBiomedical engineers at Duke University have developed a silk-based, ultrathin membrane that can be used in organ-on-a-chip models to better mimic the natural environment of cells and tissues within the body. When used in ..."
