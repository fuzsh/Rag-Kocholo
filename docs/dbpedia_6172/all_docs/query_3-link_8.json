The education is vigorous, so you'll get out whatever you put in. There are hundreds of student groups, academic opportunities and living environments to choose from, so once you've found your niche you'll have discovered that Duke is more than just a university, it's an entire college experience.\n\nElisabeth from Durham, NC\n\nDuke is the located on the most beautiful campus in America, right in the great state of North Carolina. Duke students are the ones who coined the term work hard, play hard, as you will never find a place as challenging but rewarding as you will find in Duke University. If you love basketball, you have to come to Duke- we are the school that most recently won that thing.\n\nKZ\n\nDuke's campus is absolutely beautiful. The professors are great and the academics are very rigorous. Also, school spirit is huge.\n\nAriana from Fort Myers, FL\n\nDuke is a top-notch research university with a massive amount of school spirit. There is no typical Duke experience - each student makes it his or her own. However, the most successful students are entrepreneurial types who are not afraid to take advantage of all Duke has to offer.\n\nBlueDevil\n\nSimilar Colleges\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\nProvidence, RI\n\nNashville, TN\n\nStanford, CA\n\nNew Haven, CT\n\nBaltimore, MD\n\nCambridge, MA\n\nPrinceton, NJ\n\nNew York, NY\n\nIthaca, NY\n\nNew York, NY\n\nChapel Hill, NC\n\nSee All"
