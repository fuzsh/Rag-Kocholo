        "text": "Duke University at a Glance\n\nYounger than most other prestigious U.S. research universities, Duke University consistently ranks among the very best in the U.S. and around the world. Duke is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award baccalaureate, masters, doctorate, and professional degrees. Duke’s graduate and professional schools – in business, divinity, engineering, the environment, law, medicine, nursing, and public policy – are among the leaders in their fields. Duke’s home campus is situated on nearly 9,000 acres in Durham, North Carolina, a city of more than 200,000 people. More than 75 percent of Duke students pursue service-learning opportunities in Durham and around the world through the Duke-Durham Neighborhood Partnership, DukeEngage, the Community Service Center, and other programs that advance the university’s mission of “knowledge in service to society.”\n\nA number of unique aspects of the university are noted below.\n\nDuke Chapel was constructed in the mid-1930s and is dominated by a 210-foot tower housing a 50-bell carillon, which is played at the end of each workday. Duke Chapel is open to visitors from 8:00 a.m.-10:00 p.m. during the academic year and 8:00 a.m.-8:00 p.m. during the summer. Ecumenical worship services are held every Sunday at 11:00 a.m.\n\nDuke Medicine integrates patient care with the clinical, training, and research programs of the Duke University Health System, Duke University School of Medicine, and Duke University School of Nursing. Duke University Hospital is the flagship of the broader Health System, which also includes two community hospitals (Durham Regional Hospital and Duke Raleigh Hospital) and more than 200 ambulatory care clinics.\n\nDuke Libraries, one of the nation’s top 10 private research library systems, includes the William R. Perkins and the David M. Rubenstein Libraries on West Campus, four branches, and the separately administered libraries serving the schools of business, divinity, law, and medicine.\n\nDuke Athletics, part of the Atlantic Coast Conference, fields teams in 26 NCAA Division I varsity sports. The Blue Devils have won national championships in men’s basketball, lacrosse, and soccer, and women’s golf and tennis. The Duke Sports Hall of Fame, in the Schwartz-Butters Athletic Center next to Cameron Indoor Stadium, is open to the public.\n\nSarah P. Duke Gardens is 55 acres of landscaped and woodland gardens in the heart of Duke’s West Campus. Each year more than 30,000 visitors enjoy the gardens’ five miles of walkways and more than 8,000 species and varieties of plants. Duke Gardens is open to the public daily from 8:00 a.m. to dusk. There is no admission charge.\n\nThe Nasher Museum of Art offers traveling exhibitions and educational programs, and creates exhibitions to travel to major venues around the country. The museum features a café and a shop and is open Tuesday-Saturday, 10:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. (extending to 9:00 p.m. on Thursdays), and Sunday, noon-5:00 p.m. Current and future exhibitions include the Odili Donald Odita Murals (through October 1, 2017); “Nina Chanel Abney: Royal Flush\" (February 16-July 16, 2017), and \"All Matterings of Mind: Transcendent Imagery from the Contemporary Collection\" (March 2-August 27, 2017).\n\nThe Marine Laboratory at coastal Beaufort, North Carolina, is a campus of Duke University and a unit within the Nicholas School of the Environment. Research is conducted in basic ocean processes, coastal environment management, marine biotechnology, and marine biomedicine.\n\nDuke Forest covers 7,200 acres in separate areas of Durham and nearby counties and serves as a natural outdoor laboratory for Duke and neighboring universities. The forest is used for research, protecting wildlife and rare plant species, and studying timber management practices. It is also a popular place to walk and run.\n\nThe Duke Lemur Center is home to the world’s largest colony of endangered primates – including more than 200 lemurs, bush babies, and lorises – and is dedicated to conservation, research, and education. More than 85 percent of the center’s inhabitants were born on site. Visits are by appointment only; call 919/489-3364, ext. 0 or 919/401-7240..\n\n(compiled by the Duke Office of News and Communications)"
