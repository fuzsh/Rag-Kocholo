The only Ivy League school to have the most appearances in the NCAA Tournament is Penn.\n\nThe following question is required for Engineering applicants.\n\n• If you are applying to the Pratt School of Engineering as either a first-year or transfer applicant, please discuss why you want to study engineering and why you would like to study at Duke.
