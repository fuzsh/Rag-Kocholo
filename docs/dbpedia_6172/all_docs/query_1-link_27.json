        "text": "Academics\n\nDuke University is “all about academic excellence complemented by highly competitive Division I sports and an enriching array of extracurricular activities,” making the university “an exciting, challenging, and enjoyable place to be.” Undergraduates choose Duke because they “are passionate about a wide range of things, including academics, sports, community service, research, and fun.” And because the school seems equally committed to accommodating all of those pursuits, as one student puts it, “Duke is for the Ivy League candidate who is a little bit more laid-back about school and overachieving (but just a bit).” There’s an “across-the-board excellence in all departments from humanities to engineering.” In all areas, there’s a “supportive environment in which the faculty, staff, and students are willing to look out for the other person and help them succeed.” It’s the norm to have large study groups, and “the review sessions, peer tutoring system, writing center, and academic support center are always helpful when students are struggling with anything from math homework to creating a résumé.” Professors’ “numberone priority is teaching undergraduates,” and their love of discussion means they “would rather that the students lead the class as opposed to them leading the class.” “There are a few who make me want to stay at Duke forever,” says a student. Because “the school has a lot of confidence in its students,” it offers them “seemingly limitless opportunities.”\n\nStudent Body\n\nThe student body “is surprisingly ethnically diverse, with a number of students of Asian, African, and Hispanic descent,” and “every type of person finds a welcoming group where he or she fits in.” The typical Duke student “is someone who cares a lot about his or her education but at the same time won’t sacrifice a social life for it.” Life involves “getting a ton of work done first and then finding time to play and have fun.” The typical student here is studious but social, athletic but can never be seen in the gym, job hunting but not worrying, and so on and so forth.” Everyone is “incredibly focused,” but “that includes social success as well.” Students tend to be “focused on graduating and obtaining a lucrative and prosperous career,” and although they “go out two to three times a week,” they’re “always looking polished.” An “overwhelming number” are athletes, “not just varsity athletes...but athletes in high school or generally active people. Duke’s athletic pride attracts this kind of person.”\n\nCampus Life\n\nLife at Duke “is very relaxed,” and “you can either be a part of nothing, or you can be so over-committed that it’s not even funny.” Because “the student union and other organizations provide entertainment all the time, from movies to shows to campus-wide parties,” there’s “a wealth of on-campus opportunities to get involved.” Indeed, weekends are for relaxing, and “people usually stay on campus for fun,” because hometown Durham “has a few quirky streets and squares with restaurants, shops, clubs, etc.” Undergrads’ fervor for Blue Devils sports, on the other hand, can be boundless; sports, “especially basketball, are a huge deal here,” and undergrads “will paint themselves completely blue and wait in line on the sidewalk in K-ville for three days to jump up and down in Cameron Indoor Stadium.” Greek life “plays a big role in the social scene here,” but “almost all the parties are open, so it definitely isn’t hard to get into a party.” A lot of people “just do their own thing—have a movie night, go exploring, go skiing or to the beach for a weekend.” Still, the social scene can be “a little too intense” at times."
