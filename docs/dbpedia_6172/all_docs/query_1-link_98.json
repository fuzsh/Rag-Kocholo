        "text": "DURHAM, N.C. – Duke University School of Medicine ranked No. 6 for research among 124 medical schools nationally and the School of Nursing ranked No. 2 overall, according to the annual graduate programs rankings by U.S. News & World Report.\n\nIn addition to the research rating, seven specialty programs in the School of Medicine placed in the top 10: Anesthesiology (third); Surgery (third); Internal Medicine (fifth); Radiology (sixth); Obstetrics and Gynecology (eighth); Pediatrics (eighth, tied); Psychiatry (ninth, tied). Family medicine tied for 13th.\n\nThe magazine’s medical school research rankings are based on numerous indicators, including assessment by deans and residency directors (reputation), as well as the faculty-to-student ratio, student admissions statistics such as MCAT, GPA and acceptance rates, and total federal research activity.\n\n“Year after year, Duke is recognized as a national leader in patient care, discovery, and training and education,” said Mary E. Klotman, M.D., dean of Duke University School of Medicine.\n\n“This accomplishment must be attributed to the seminal achievements of our outstanding faculty and physicians, staff and students,” Klotman said. “At Duke, we are stronger because we share a commitment to excellence in all of our missions and a vision to transform the future of academic medicine together.”\n\nDuke tied for 16th nationally among medical schools for the diversity of its graduates. The ranking was based on two indicators from fall 2021 data: the number of underrepresented minority students enrolled in the school and the ratio of the school’s underrepresented students to state and national numbers. Public institutions’ underrepresented minority enrollments were compared with their respective state percentages, and private institutions’ enrollments were compared with national figures.\n\nIn addition to the No. 2 overall ranking for Duke School of Nursing, the Master of Science program and Doctor of Nursing Practice programs were both ranked No. 2.\n\n“The U.S. News rankings are an external measure of Duke School of Nursing’s leadership and contribution to nursing and nursing education,” said Vincent Guilamo-Ramos, Ph.D., dean of Duke University School of Nursing and vice chancellor of nursing affairs at Duke University. “They’re a key indicator that our peers in the nursing community acknowledge the ways our students, faculty, staff, and alumni are transforming the future of health care.”\n\nAll of Duke’s master’s nursing programs identified by the magazine were either No. 1 or No. 2. MSN Nursing Practitioner programs earning No. 1 include Nurse Practitioner – Administration; Nurse Practitioner-Adult Gerontology – Primary Care; Nurse Practitioner – Family; and Nurse Practitioner – Psychiatric/Mental Health Across the Life Span. The MSN – Adult Gerontology – Acute Care earned No. 2.\n\nThe Duke Doctor of Nursing (DNP) program ranks No. 2, with the DNP Executive Leadership Specialty earning No. 1.\n\n\"Our rankings reflect the extraordinary work of the Duke School of Nursing community in advancing the role of nurses in health leadership,” Ramos said. “At Duke, we are leading the way in preparing the next generation of nurses who bring clinical, scientific and relational expertise to health care -- and we are preparing community health and policy leaders committed to the reduction of health inequities.”\n\nU.S. News annually ranks graduate schools in six disciplines, including business, law, medicine, nursing, engineering, and education. The magazine’s ranking criteria includes grade-point averages of incoming students, acceptance rates and employment outcomes for students. For medical school research rankings, the criteria include two measures of research productivity.\n\n“These rankings are attributed to the remarkable achievements and significant contributions of our exceptional people in the School of Medicine and School of Nursing,” said A. Eugene Washington, M.D., chancellor for health affairs and president/CEO of the Duke University Health System. “We are proud of all their efforts to accelerate discovery and its translation and to create education that is transforming. It is because of them that Duke Health is nationally and internationally renowned.”"
