        "text": "Alan Rudolph wants to know who I am. This is two weeks before we are to sit down in New York to discuss his latest picture, Trixie. He is still in Germany, wrapping up shooting on another picture, but after hearing that The Globe and Mail was interested in a talk, he asked a publicist to make some inquiries.\n\nIt seems he was hoping I was someone else, was hoping I would turn out to be the Globe critic who savaged his previous film -- a bewildering adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions -- at the 1999 Toronto Film Festival. \"I major in bad reviews so I can handle them,\" the 56-year-old director explains, \"but this was a particularly nasty review. And in a way it killed the film.\" The way Rudolph sees it, the folks at Disney, which distributed the film, took that one bad review as a warning to suffocate the film in its cradle. Apparently, leading man Bruce Willis came off too bizarrely for their comfort. The company's investment in him -- with films including The Sixth Sense and The Kid -- was so great that they couldn't afford the potential adverse effect to his public image that might arise from Rudolph's wonky work. Sniffing the wind via that one bad review, they dropped the film into a chaotic fall season with as little promotion as possible.\n\n\"There's the first review out, and it's a scathing review, and those shitheads at Disney -- they took that as [proof of its lack of commercial appeal]\" Rudolph says, sitting in a New York hotel suite before heading to his home in the Pacific Northwest. At that point, \"it was over, it was gone.\"\n\nThat's the way Rudolph remembers it, though the truth of the matter strays from the story on a couple of key points. First, though it wasn't favourable, the Globe review wasn't nearly as bad as he recollects. Second, and perhaps more important, there were already plenty of other poor notices from the Seattle and Berlin festivals before Breakfast was delivered in Toronto. Still, it is vintage Rudolph, this desire of his to sit for an interview with me as a way of resolving his disappointment with a critique by someone else at the same newspaper. The characters in his films forever latch onto something, anything, as a way of resolving their oblique dissatisfactions. They hook up with the wrong person, follow the wrong path of logic to solve a mystery they don't even understand. If it's not Tom Berenger's private dick accidentally tracking the wrong man in Love at Large or the odd trio of lovelorn crazies in Choose Me latching onto one another in misplaced hopes of finding love and redemption, it's Julie Christie and Nick Nolte as the long-married couple in Afterglow sleeping with others as a way of keeping their marriage alive.\n\nNow we have Trixie Zurbo (Emily Watson -- Angela's Ashes, Hilary and Jackie), the endearingly bumbling eponymous heroine of Rudolph's newest effort, which opens today. Trixie is a lonely soul, working as a security guard at a low-end casino and looking for a real detective case. She stumbles upon what appears to be the murder of a lounge singer who had apparently been blackmailing a powerful senator (Nick Nolte) with proof of sexual misdemeanours.\n\nFixing on the suspicious death as a chance to prove herself, Trixie's gumshoe imitation is hampered by a couple of problems. The primary obstacle is that Rudolph's heroine has a unique way with words. \"Trixie Zurbo, Private Defective,\" she says, giving an introduction which unintentionally sums up her special qualities. Trixie's an involuntary master of the malapropism, offering up such lines as: \"I don't want you drinking yourself into Bolivia!\" Consoling a friend, she says soothingly, \"Hey, nobody is human.\"\n\nThis being a Rudolph film, there's also an odd romance at its core, a ham-fisted courtship between Trixie and a small-time Don Juan named Dex (Dermot Mulroney).\n\nRudolph was inspired to write the script after listening to the bafflegab of politicians during a recent U.S. presidential election cycle. \"All politicians are guilty of something,\" Nolte's character admits smoothly, \"but I swore by my oath never to go beyond the bounds of reasonable dishonesty.\"\n\nRudolph says the person who contributed the most to Nolte's dialogue -- albeit unintentionally -- was former U.S. vice-president Dan Quayle -- with help from George Bush père, Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole. \"The Republicans are great at mangling everything, especially the language,\" Rudolph says. \"When there's no verbal truth any more, who do you listen to except yourself? It seems to me perfect sense: A woman whose tongue is fairly removed from her brain speaks the only truth in the movie.\"\n\nNo matter how hip the idea of \"indie film\" becomes, some of its practitioners simply will never be easily commercialized. Rudolph, after all, was one of the original indie directors, an early and continuing protégé of Indie King Robert Altman. His passion continues to attract top talent for few bucks.\n\n\"If a studio had been in charge of casting this film, there's no way they'd let me come anywhere near it,\" Watson says. \"Alan makes you feel like you're fighting a guerrilla war. There's no money, there's no time, but he won't compromise, he doesn't pander to the establishment in any way, but you're there, you're this band of actors, linking arms trying to do something very fragile and odd and strange and offbeat.\" That's what indie filmmaking used to be about, even if the label has been co-opted and corrupted by commercial forces. Rudolph barely has any use for the term anymore. \"I feel like the road I paved, I can't even hitchhike a ride on. The most independent filmmaker was Stanley Kubrick, and he only made films for major studios. And what's the biggest independent distributor? Miramax. Well, there isn't a film that Miramax has made that they haven't recut, so who's kidding who?\"\n\nIt's all enough to make an indie vet despair. Still, he keeps getting his movies green-lit, despite the lukewarm reaction of audiences and the vitriolic attacks of some critics. On occasion in conversation, he does give off the sense that he'd like a commercial hit. He's just not built like that. \"I don't know how to pursue being a success,\" he says. Novelist Tom Robbins, a good friend of Rudolph's, once told him: \"I have a career. You have a careen.\""
