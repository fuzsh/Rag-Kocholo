        "text": "A Farewell to Arfs\n\nby Spencer Quinn\n\nDETAILS: Series: Chet and Bernie, #15 Publisher: Forge Publication Date: August 6, 2024 Format: eARC Length: 288 pg. Read Date: July 24-27, 2024\n\nWhat’s A Farewell to Arfs About?\n\nWe start off this book with Bernie and Chet finishing a case for the Sonoran Museum of Art (an institution we learned about a couple of books ago), and with things looking up—and money in Bernie’s pocket—this is a pretty happy way to start things.\n\nBut soon after that, Chet overhears a phone call that their neighbor, Mr. Parsons, is having—and the reader knows things are going bad for him. Bernie learns the next day that Mr. Parsons has been the victim of a phone scam and is wiped out. Bernie starts looking into it—and into the Parsons’ ex-con of a son. It looks like he may have turned his life around, and is helping other former inmates adjust to the outside world and to stay on the right path. But is that what’s really going on?\n\nIf Billy Parsons isn’t involved—who is? And is there any chance that Bernie can get back any of the Parsons’ money?\n\nCharlie and Esmé\n\nBernie’s son, Charlie, has been a consistent pleasure in the series—particularly because of Chet’s devotion to him. But adding his best friend, Esmé, in the last couple of books has made the character much more enjoyable for me.\n\nI really enjoy their dynamic, for those familiar with Syfy’s Resident Alien show, it’s similar to the dynamic of Sahar and Max, only Esmé has a little more patience with Charlie than Sahar does with Max.\n\nEven better, we get to meet Esmé’s father in this book—who seems like a good guy for Bernie to talk to in general—he has no knowledge of Bernie’s past, he’s not involved with policing, investigations, or anything like that. Just a friendly guy—who happens to be smart and (coincidentally) involved in an area that Bernie needs help understanding for the case. I enjoyed their conversation and hope we get more in the future.\n\n(still, I do like the way that Charlier got to shine a little brighter this time than he usually does)\n\nBernie’s Past\n\nWhoa. I did not expect any of what we learned about Bernie’s father in this book. Frankly, I didn’t think we’d ever learn anything about him—we barely know anything about his mother (and I’m okay with that based on Chet’s descriptions). But all of a sudden, there’s a lot about Harry Little being talked about.\n\nIt works—don’t get me wrong—and now I want to know more about Harry, his relationship with Bernie, and what was going on with him in general. We don’t get that (now?), but we get a glimpse of the man that was a presence in Bernie’s life until his early death. And that’s not nothing.\n\nFeelings, Nothing More than Feelings\n\nSo, all the stuff about Harry Little added some emotional weight to the novel. But we didn’t need any of it—I’m not objecting, don’t get me wrong—but the last thing this book needed was more going on emotionally.\n\nThere’s some drama between Bernie and Weatherly. Bernie’s found a new way to botch things up with a woman—no real surprise there. The only plus is that it is a new way—he’s not repeating mistakes he made with Leda or Suzie. Maybe there’s some growth there—but it’s not Bernie at his best.\n\nRelated to that are some real dark moments for Bernie—we’ve seen hints of things like this from him before. But I don’t think it was ever this pronounced. Bernie is not always a good guy, he’s not only a white knight—there’s a noir character in him, battling to come out. And Bernie’s control slips early on in the novel and he has to reckon with the fallout.\n\nBut that’s not all. The Parsons have been aging and declining in health for a few books now, and for them to get wiped out like this—and then whatever that may or may not say about their son? There’s just no way to read this without your heartstrings being tugged. Scratch that—they’re yanked.\n\nI don’t want to be unclear here (he says after probably giving the wrong impression). This is still a Chet and Bernie book like fourteen that have come before. Chet’s still irrepressible, he’s still an unreliable narrator obsessed with Bernie, food, smells, putting his teeth on perps, and snacks. He will make you laugh, and you will enjoy Bernie tracking down clues and the rest. But, like the better installments of this series, there’s a lot more going on than Chet’s antics—and Quinn makes sure that the depth is there.\n\nSo, what did I think about A Farewell to Arfs?\n\nI admit that I was hoping for a criminal named Mike Craven to show up—to get back at Craven’s accidental use of Quinn’s name in last year’s Fearless. But it’s probably too soon for that—maybe in the next couple of years?\n\nOnce I saw what Mr. Parsons was doing on the phone, I muttered to myself (and texted a friend) that “Quinn’s getting all the mileage he can out of the research he did for Mrs. Plansky’s Revenge.” More power to him, obviously, but it did feel a little like a re-run. Thankfully, the story went in a very different direction—as I assumed it would, but still. In fact, while this might have been the result of the same research, the nature of the phone scam was different enough to shut me up.\n\nI’m not sure that Weatherly handled things as well as she could’ve, but I’m not bothered by an imperfect character—she can be as flawed as Bernie. But that was the only hitch I found in this book or the events in it.\n\nI really appreciated the depth we see of Bernie’s character, an angle or two that we haven’t spent that much time looking at before—we get to focus on. There’s more to him than being a decent PI with a lousy approach to finances. And if how he treats the Parsons doesn’t make your heart melt a little, you weren’t paying attention.\n\nWe get the usual chuckles (including Chet giving the reader a good idea about what he thinks about legalized marijuana), a good story, all the feels I described above (and more), and some good action scenes. What more is there to ask for?\n\nNothing that I can think of.\n\nDisclaimer: I received a copy of this book from Tor Publishing Group via NetGalley—thanks to both for this.\n\nThis post contains an affiliate link. If you purchase from it, I will get a small commission at no additional cost to you. As always, the opinions expressed are my own.\n\nA Farewell to Arfs\n\nby Spencer Quinn\n\nDETAILS: Series: Chet and Bernie, #15 Publisher: Forge Publication Date: August 6, 2024 Format: eARC Length: 288 pg.

Read Date: November 15-17, 2023\n\nWhat’s Up on the Woof Top About?\n\nBernie accompanies his elderly neighbors to a book signing for Dame Ariadne Carlisle, the author of a series of Christmas-themed mysteries. This, as one has to assume, is interrupted by some canine-induced chaos. However, it wasn’t Chet that got out of hand this time. Nevertheless, Chet and his human partner do grab the attention of Carlisle.\n\nShe ends up offering the duo a job they can’t turn down. She owns quite the little compound up in the mountains. It’s called Kringle Ranch and has buildings with names like Cratchit House. Carlisle knows her brand and has fully embraced it. As part of this brand, she owns a group of nine reindeer—her favorite, Rudy, has gone missing. For a sizeable payday, successful or not, she wants Bernie (or probably his friend with the superior sense of smell) to find Rudy and bring him back home.\n\nOnce they get to the Ranch, Bernie learns that Carlisle is suffering a career-risking case of writer’s block—which is ascribed to Rudy’s absence, but it could be the pressure that book 100 is too much for her. Or a combination of things. But it’s this block that Bernie really focuses on.\n\nOr he tries to, anyway. Shortly after they arrive, the duo finds Carlisle’s personal assistant at the bottom of a gorge, barely alive. It turns out that Carlisle’s one, true love was also found at the bottom of that gorge, murdered, before she started writing. Bernie assumes that there’s a link between the two and plunges into the unsolved murder case as a way of finding the attempted murderer.\n\nA Holiday Sampler\n\nAlong the way, we get the occasional excerpt from Carlisle’s Trudi Termaine series—which is interesting enough and does help you understand the character. But…I’ve gotta say, I hope Quinn doesn’t go the Seanan McGuire/A. Deborah Baker route and put out books under her name, I don’t know that I could deal with an entire novel’s worth of it.\n\n(of course I would inevitably try it)\n\nThe Holiday Content\n\nUnlike the previous holiday-themed installment, It’s a Wonderful Woof, where I said that it “would be very easy to forget that this is a Christmas/Holiday Themed novel,” it is impossible to forget that about this book. I mean, for crying out loud, Bernie is hired to search for a reindeer named Rudolph.\n\nChristmas just flat-out permeates Up on the Woof Top. Thankfully, not in a cheesy way, or one that should offend anyone, or put off Scrooges. It’s part of the setting, it’s part of every plotline*, and the holiday is discussed frequently.\n\n* I should probably qualify that with a “nearly,” but I can’t think of an exception off the top of my head.\n\nNone of this makes this one of those novels/stories that you can only read during the holiday season—like The Nutcracker or A Christmas Carol. Whenever you get to it during the year, it’ll be fine—but you won’t forget for a second what time of year it takes place in. (which makes it different from almost every single other book in the series, which could take place anytime)\n\nContinuing Arcs\n\nSure, it wasn’t the biggest series-changing moment, but Chet getting out to…ahem…become a father was so subtle that you could be forgiven for missing it. And many of the series’ bigger moments (both for individual novels or overall) are underplayed—thanks in part to Chet not understanding them at the time or his unreliable narration.\n\nThat is not the case in this book. Not even close. Bernie does some things here that are going to change the books, his work, Chet’s life, and more in ways that readers can only guess at for now. (Quinn might only be guessing at for now, too)—and they make up the B-story, frequently distracting Bernie and the reader from murders, attempted murders, sleigh-pulling mammals, aging friends (new and old), and so on.\n\nHere’s a fairly non-spoilery way to talk about how big and unusual Bernie’s actions in this novel are—he goes to his regular pawn shop not to hock or buy-back the watch. He goes there to just buy something. It threw me almost as much as it did the owners of the pawn shop.\n\nSo, what did I think about Up on the Woof Top?\n\n“You did us proud. You’re the brains of the outfit, no doubt about it.”\n\nMe the brains? That had to be one of Bernie’s jokes. He can be very funny at times. If I were the brains how could the Little Detective Agency be so successful, except for the finances part? Still, it was nice to hear. If only I knew exactly what I’d done I could do it again, and then hear Bernie say “You did us proud,” once more. Or even more than once! But you can’t have everything, which kind of makes sense, because who could possibly carry everything? You could have it, but you couldn’t go anywhere. What would be the point of that?”\n\nI had a blast with this—there’s a subplot or scene or two that I wondered about. But they were either eventually justified or were fun enough that I didn’t care. The rest was just a ball of holiday-flavored Chet-goodness.\n\nI never understood Bernie’s approach to the search for Rudy, I will admit. It really felt like he was just taking a vacation and occasionally remembered he had a chore to do. But that job was just an excuse to put him in this setting so he could look into this murder/attempted murder and associated shenanigans—that was clear from the jump (well, not what he was really going to be doing there, but that a case other-than the Rudy-hunt was in the wings)—so I didn’t worry about it too much. Also, the payoff to that particular gig was dealt with well enough by Quinn, that any quibbles just didn’t matter.\n\nThe novel is largely Bernie and Chet getting to play in the snow while doing what they do best while encountering a few characters that the reader will want to get to know better (a former Sheriff and a current deputy for starters). There’s a child that will steal your heart as he does Chet’s. And then there’s the setup for the series change that I mentioned above. Up on the Woof Top delivers plenty of fun from page 1 to 307.\n\nNaturally, we get some healthy doses of what a friend calls Chet the Jet wisdom and other real heartwarming moments (see above quotation) that will flip in a moment to welcome silliness. There’s also a conversation about the lifespan of dogs that hit me right in “all the feels” after my dog’s recent death (it would’ve done it anyway, but the hit landed a bit harder). To be clear: I absolutely loved that moment and would’ve given the book 3 stars just because of it had I been annoyed by the rest of it.\n\nFans of this series will be very happy to unwrap this gift—and it should win a new reader over as well. If either of those two labels applies to you, I heartily recommend this novel to you.\n\nThis post contains an affiliate link.

Read Date: July 25-28, 2022\n\nChet the Narrator\n\nFor roughly a decade now, Chet has been my favorite first-person narrator (at least among those being currently published). This K-9 school dropout is an engaging and personable narrator who will get the reader emotionally invested and charm you within the first few pages after you meet him. He’s optimistic, generally positive, and his unique perspective will make you chuckle frequently while you read a solid P.I. story.\n\nAt the same time, there’s an extra level of attention that needs to be paid to what he says so you can pick up what’s actually going on—Chet’s the best kind of unreliable narrator, he’s not being deceptive, he just doesn’t (and can’t) understand what he’s seeing and hearing. But he’s honest and thorough.\n\nSo, what I’m saying is, there’s little chance I’m not going to thoroughly enjoy a new Chet and Bernie novel. So going in, expect me to say nice things.\n\nWhat’s Bark to the Future About?\n\nBernie’s approached by a panhandler while stopped at a light on a freeway off-ramp, who recognizes Bernie from high school and refuses to take his money. Life’s been harder on him than Bernie, who can’t recognize him at all. Bernie takes him for a burger, and tries to help him out a little—by this time, he’s identified himself. He’s an old baseball teammate, and the two shared a highlight or two of their careers. After their meal, Rocket Saluka has Bernie drop him off on the off-ramp.\n\nBut he’d said a thing or two that Bernie can’t stop thinking about, so he goes back the next morning to follow up. Rocket’s nowhere to be found, but someone else directs Bernie to a camp Rocket was staying at. He’s not there, either—and there’s almost no trace of him. Chet does find his distinctive switchblade buried under Rocket’s tent, however—and now Bernie’s even more curious, and he sets out to find his old teammate.\n\nIt turns out that there’s quite the history attached to this switchblade, and most of it was shared by other people who were associated with their high school (including one person Bernie knows but didn’t realize was from the same school). What starts off as a way to deal with some unnecessary guilt becomes a hunt for someone responsible for at least one murder—and hopefully, Rocket.\n\nWeatherly and Trixie\n\nI was a fan of Suzie Sanchez and didn’t like it at all when that relationship fell apart, and I wished for more time with the doctor Bernie dated. But now that Quinn has brought Weatherly into the series, I’m glad that things between them and Bernie ended.\n\nWeatherly’s a great addition to the series period—someone in law enforcement that Bernie can talk shop with (who isn’t a former colleague) and who can pitch in when Bernie needs backup. And their romantic relationship is better than Bernie’s had before—there’s a trust, an honesty that was missing with Suzie. Bernie’s learned from his past mistakes and is making sure that he doesn’t make them again. It’s great to see.\n\nI do feel back for Weatherly’s dog Trixie, Chet’s a jealous boy (we are learning), and he’s not doing well with a female counterpart with similar strengths (maybe stronger in a couple of ways than Chet). Yes, she scores a few wins over our narrator, but his feelings toward her color what we’re told about her, and she doesn’t come out looking so good.\n\nWe’ve seen something like this with Shooter, Chet’s son. But it’s a little different with Shooter because there’s a somewhat paternal aspect to Chet’s description of him.\n\nWe know that Chet can get along with other dogs—but the extended time with Trixie is showing us another side of his personality. You wouldn’t think you’d get that in a dog character, but it’s good to see that Quinn can give us that.\n\nBernie’s Notoriety\n\nAs he’s visiting fellow alumni and other people associated with the case, several people mention how they’d read/seen something about him because of the events of Of Mutts and Men (although one harkened back to Heart of Barkness. I’m glad that there are people out there who know that Bernie Little is out there, doing good work. Most of the time in PI fiction, you get the idea that outside of those close to a case, no one notices that the PI we’re so heavily invested in does anything of note.\n\nBut what’s better to me is that Bernie’s getting recognition for this case—one of the first things we learn about him 12 books ago is that he has very definite opinions about water usage and the local aquifer. From Chet, we get some ideas about other things that Bernie cares about, but from his own mouth, we know that he cares about Charlie, Chet, and water (and now, Weatherly). Of all the cases for him to get good PR for, this is the one that’s going to mean something to Bernie.\n\nSo, what did I think about Bark to the Future?\n\nNot surprisingly, I liked it. I really did. We get a little character backstory here, we see Bernie as a good father (and a fumbling one), we see development in his relationship with Weatherly, we see the potential for a (small) income stream for Bernie outside the PI business, and there’s an intriguing mystery or two for our heroes to dig their teeth into (literally, for Chet).\n\nStarting with Of Mutts and Men that Quinn’s found another gear. I can’t put my finger on it—I wish I could—but there’s something about the novels that have stepped up a notch or two. The series is always reliable, but these last few have been better than some of the previous. Bark to the Future continues that streak.\n\nI heartily recommend this to you—if you haven’t tried one from this series before, don’t worry—they’re all good entry points. Jump in now, you’ll be glad you did.\n\nMuch like Chet and a Slim Jim, I’ve gulped this one down and am ready for my next one.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this eARC from Macmillan-Tor/Forge via NetGalley in exchange for this post—thanks to both for this.\n\nThis post contains an affiliate link.

Read Date: July 7, 2022\n\nI grabbed him by the pant leg, which was how we closed our cases, me and Bernie.\n\n“Aieee! Aieee!”\n\nOh, come on, Chuckie! Suck it up. My teeth were barely engaged at all. But the funny thing is that when that Aieee sound is in the air, they—meaning my teeth—get this sort of…urge.\n\n“AIEEE! AIEEE!”\n\nWhat’s Short Tails About?\n\nThis is a collection of short stories from the Chet & Bernie series. I don’t normally do this for short story collections, but the collection is brief enough that I can get away with it, let’s take a quick look at each.\n\nUpper Story\n\nI want to say that this takes place during Scents and Sensibility, but I can’t swear to it (if it didn’t, I might as well have). Bernie’s in the hospital, so Chet’s staying–and working with–their friend, Rick Torres. This story is heavy on Chet’s actions and his contrasting appraisal of working with Bernie vs. Rick. As you’d expect, the comparison does not go in Rick’s favor (no matter that he’s freer with the Slim Jims).\n\nIt’s a very short story with a great emotional punch and some good chuckle-inducing lines. I’d have honestly expected this to be last in the collection because of that–but what do I know?\n\nThe Iggy Papers\n\nThis is probably the most satisfying story in the bunch. Like with The Iggy Chronicles, this focuses on something to do with Mrs. Parson’s medical care. Bernie gets to flex his investigative muscles here a bit more than in the other stories from the book, and Chet’s major contributions come from his commentary and interaction with Iggy.\n\nThis is everything that a Chet and Bernie short story should be.\n\nThe Numbers After Two\n\nIt’s been a bit since we got to see Bernie’s head for finances on display (more accurately, total lack of one), this story gives us a tale about an interrupted vacation for the detectives and a chance to see Bernie’s gullibility on display.\n\nI know that it’s good to see Bernie’s fallibility–Chet tends toward hagiography when he describes Bernie. We need to see him stumble outside of his romantic relationships–but I have such trouble buying that he can be as gullible as he so often is when it comes to financial schemes and yet be such a good detective. Still, this is who he’s been since Day 1 of the series, so we need to see it every now and then.\n\nThe story isn’t all about watching the train wreck of Bernie making a bad investment*, but it’s the heart of it–the rest of the story makes up for that part of it, and it ends on a good note (as it started).\n\n* That feels like a spoiler, but if you don’t know what’s going to happen the instant that Bernie gets a wad of cash, you haven’t been paying attention.\n\nSo, what did I think about Short Tails?\n\nThese were cute stories, but there were too few of them. If this collection was 2 or 3-times as long? I’d have been as happy as a dog with a new Kong. I had fun with this, but it was just enough to satisfy me. But not much more than that.\n\nStill, I’ll take any excuse to read a Chet & Bernie story, and I figure most of Quinn’s readers will, too. So yeah, I recommend it.\n\nThe point of these quick takes posts is to catch up on my “To Write About” stack—emphasizing pithiness, not thoroughness.\n\nThe Sentence is Death\n\nby Anthony Horowitz, Rory Kinnear (Narrator)\n\nDETAILS: Series: A Hawthorne and Horowitz Mystery, #2 Publisher: HarperAudio Publication Date: May 27, 2019 Format: Unabridged Audiobook Length: 8 hrs., 36 min. Read Date: December 22-23, 2021\n\n(the official blurb)\n\nA notorious divorce lawyer is bludgeoned with an expensive bottle of wine and Horowitz finds himself dragged away from his day job by Hawthorne to chronicle the investigation.\n\nHawthorne seems to be more disagreeable this time out—almost like he was trying to be off-putting. Horowitz (the character) is a decent source of comic relief as he struggles to prove himself.\n\nThe mystery was pretty compelling—and while I think I got it before the duo (well, before Horowitz, anyway), it was a bit trickier than the first. All in all, it’s a fun listen.\n\nThe Iggy Chronicles, Volume One\n\nby Spencer Quinn\n\nDETAILS: Series: Chet and Bernie Publisher: Atria Books Publication Date: August 13, 2013 Format: Kindle Edition Length: 49 pg. Read Date: December 30, 2021\n\n(the official blurb)\n\nI’ve had this short Chet & Bernie story on my Kindle for ages, I think I started it a few times but got distracted quickly. Which makes no sense, because it’s not like it took too long to read.\n\nIt’s a fast read featuring Chet’s buddy, Iggy, and Bernie’s neighbor, Mr. Parsons. Bernie’s sharper than ever and he makes quick work of the mystery the duo literally stumbles into. It’s not a must-read, but it’s a fun one.\n\nZoth-Avarex’s Escape Plan: A Pick-Your-Own-Path Experience\n\nby K.R.R. Lockhaven\n\nDETAILS: Series: Zoth-Avarex, #2 Publication Date: June 13, 2021 Format: Kindle Edition Length: 43 pg. Read Date: December 31, 2021\n\n(the official blurb)\n\nNot surprisingly, Zoth-Avarex, was not happy being thwarted The Conjuring of Zoth-Avarex, and he wants revenge. Lockhaven presents this quest in a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style. Without, it should be stressed, being so close to the style as to infringe on any trademarks or anything.\n\nI laughed at this, it was truly ridiculous. I don’t know that this is the sequel I wanted/expected, but I’m glad we got it.\n\nDogtology: Live. Bark. Believe.\n\nby Jeff Lazarus\n\nDETAILS: Publisher: Greenleaf Book Group Press Publication Date: June 2, 2015 Format: Hardcover Length: 189 pg. Read Date: December 30-31, 2021\n\n(the official blurb)\n\nThe central conceit here is that humans are so obsessed with their dogs, have devoted so much time, energy, and work that it’s become a religion, with humans worshipping canines. This book is a look at that devotion and the rituals and beliefs that accompany it.\n\nWhen this book sticks to poking fun at the obsessive nature of dog owners, and having fun with the nature of dogs, it’s pretty amusing. But it treads a little too close to mocking actual religion for me to get excited about it.\n\nI’m not sure I laughed at all, but it’s frequently funny.\n\nGone Missing\n\nby Linda Castillo, Kathleen McInerney (Narrator)\n\nDETAILS: Series: Kate Burkholder, #4 Publisher: Macmillan Audio Publication Date: June 18, 2012 Format: Unabridged Audiobook Length:10 hrs., 8 min. Read Date: January 3-5, 2022\n\n(the official blurb)\n\nHey, Castillo found a way to get Kate out of town to investigate a crime involving the Amish. This has been my biggest (or one of my biggest) concerns with the series, that at the rate things were going, the Amish in her community would all die before we got to book 10.\n\nThere is a string of Amish youth going missing—enough that it’s got the attention of the state to assemble a Task Force—Kate Burkholder and John Tomasetti are recruited to be part of it.\n\nWhat they end up finding is pretty disturbing, but a little less disturbing than the last couple. I like where the series is finding itself and can see me sticking around for a little longer than I feared I might have.\n\nTwo Witches and a Whiskey\n\nby Annette Marie, Cris Dukehart (Narrator)\n\nDETAILS: Series: The Guild Codex: Spellbound Series, #3 Publisher: Tantor Audio Publication Date: February 27, 2019 Format: Unabridged Audiobook Length: 8 hrs., 9 min. Read Date: January 11-12, 2022\n\n(the official blurb)\n\nOkay, this is more like it, a very good way to bounce back from the last book which was a bit of a disappointment to me. I wasn’t terribly worried about the series—I have a friend who’s further ahead of me (I think she’s done), and I assume she wouldn’t have recommended it if there was a problem.\n\nTori and her friends get themselves tied up in a big ol’ mess that will result in Tori dying unless they can pull off the impossible, or at least the incredibly unlikely.\n\nThe police (both real and supernatural) are lurking around the edges, the druid she met last time is back, and we learn a bit about Kai’s past and background. A fun story and some good character growth.\n\nThis post contains affiliate links. If you purchase from any of them, I will get a small commission at no additional cost to you.

The two had recently run into each other on different cases, and Bernie’s been reminded that Victor isn’t cut out for the more, shall we say, physically demanding cases—but he’s great at the stuff you can do behind a desk, which is what this case calls for.\n\nAlso, I think Bernie feels sorry for the guy and thinks he can do him a favor by sending work his way to make up for the way things went during that recent encounter.\n\nYou know what they say about roads and best intentions, though. It’s not long before Victor has gone missing—a very concerned mother (who has less confidence in his abilities than Bernie does) hires Chet and Bernie to find him. It turns out that not only Victor is missing, but his client is, too.\n\nThere’s nothing about this case that suggests a cushy desk job anymore—a strong sense of violence surrounds the disappearances—and other elements of the case as it develops. Can Chet and Bernie sniff out what happened to them, and what the relationship is between these disappearances, Mary and Joseph fleeing to Egypt, Caravaggio, and an old Spanish mission?\n\nRelationship Issues\n\nThis is news to no one that has read one book in this series, but Bernie’s not good at relationships. Expressing himself to a woman he cares about is not a skill he possesses (I’m sure Chet would differ with me here, but I stand by it).\n\nHis current relationship is still pretty new—and seems to be going pretty well. But that’s all stuff that happened since Tender is the Bite. It doesn’t take him too long to mess things up with Weatherly. Both his reaction to this throughout the novel and the way it started felt different than the way he’d put his foot into it with Suzi (but not completely). The relationships between Bernie and the two women are notably different—which is a relief, too often in situations like this it feels like a duplicate of a previous romance.\n\nA Very Bernie Christmas?\n\nIt would be very easy to forget that this is a Christmas/Holiday Themed novel—I did more than once, and I was expressly looking to see how Quinn dealt with it.\n\nHowever, when the holidays do come up? It’s great. There’s a Hannukah scene that I just loved, and…well there are a couple of great other scenes about the holidays, but my no-spoiler policy stops me from getting into those.\n\nLanguage Choice\n\nThis isn’t a big deal—I don’t want to make a proverbial mountain out of anything. But it struck me that Bernie’s language is a bit stronger than usual. I don’t want to take the time and do word counts or anything—I’m lazy and I’m not going to buy e-copies just to document this point. This book is still PG-13, but it jumped out at me and struck me as different—and I’m curious about it.\n\nSo, what did I think about It’s a Wonderful Woof?\n\nI had a blast with this—there was a time 5 or 6 books ago, that my interest in the series waned a bit—I still enjoyed the books, but they didn’t grab me the way the initial novels did. That’s gone, and I have to wonder what was wrong with me—Quinn and Chet are as fresh and entertaining now as they were in Dog Gone It.\n\nThere’s heart, there’s excitement, there’s humor, there’s the devotion that only a dog can have for their human, and you even can even learn a little bit about art history. Throw in a little holiday magic and you’ve got yourself another winner in this series.\n\nGo read this—which readers of this series probably don’t need me to say. But if you haven’t read any before, this functions well enough as a jumping-on point, just be prepared to make some time for the previous 11 novels. You’re going to want to read them all.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this eARC from Macmillan-Tor/Forge via NetGalley in exchange for this post—thanks to both for this.\n\nThis post contains an affiliate link.

This book is still PG-13, but it jumped out at me and struck me as different—and I’m curious about it.\n\nSo, what did I think about It’s a Wonderful Woof?\n\nI had a blast with this—there was a time 5 or 6 books ago, that my interest in the series waned a bit—I still enjoyed the books, but they didn’t grab me the way the initial novels did. That’s gone, and I have to wonder what was wrong with me—Quinn and Chet are as fresh and entertaining now as they were in Dog Gone It.\n\nThere’s heart, there’s excitement, there’s humor, there’s the devotion that only a dog can have for their human, and you even can even learn a little bit about art history. Throw in a little holiday magic and you’ve got yourself another winner in this series.\n\nGo read this—which readers of this series probably don’t need me to say. But if you haven’t read any before, this functions well enough as a jumping-on point, just be prepared to make some time for the previous 11 novels. You’re going to want to read them all.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this eARC from Macmillan-Tor/Forge via NetGalley in exchange for this post—thanks to both for this.\n\nThis post contains an affiliate link.

But before she explains herself, something spooks her and she leaves.\n\nCurious, Bernie starts looking for her—and stumbles into the middle of a situation involving stalking, murder, dog-napping, and all sorts of other things. There’s an international aspect of this—but it’s a very local story. There’s a lot to chew on, a lot to talk about—but all of it is in spoiler territory, so I’m going to leave it at that.\n\nApproaching the Political\n\nThis is the second time in a week that I’ve said something along those lines, and it’s a bit strange. Chet and Bernie keep finding themselves in the neighborhood of a senate election. The case brings the two of them across the path of both candidates (one of them repeatedly). But it’s closer to home than that—Bernie’s neighbors on either side are very invested in this campaign and their enthusiasm spills over onto the a-political P. I. (or so he tries to be)—at least at one point, one neighbor’s has a considerable blow-back on Bernie’s investigation. This is a new thing for Quinn to dabble in and he does it well.\n\nIf you don’t catch the parallel between this campaign and the way people are behaving during it and…well, all of American politics right now. Quinn gives us some pretty good commentary to chew on.\n\nNon-Chet Animal Characters\n\nSure, we’ve got Chet’s friend, Iggy doing his thing. But we have more animal guest stars. There’s a dog—who could be Chet’s sister (or niece), and I really hope we get to see more of her.\n\nBut the big guest star is a ferret. A ferret named Griffie—without Griffie it’s hard to say if Bernie’d been able to very far with things. Chet can’t stand ferrets, or so he repeatedly says…I’m not sure about Griffie, though.\n\nChet talking about adults, criminals or otherwise, is a lot of fun. Chet talking about kids is simply fantastic. But Chet talking about other animals is a different kind of fun.\n\nA Little Light Gets Shed on Certain Events\n\nFor ages now—possibly since the first book, definitely since the second or third—Chet’s been alluding to a case that didn’t end well. He’s given us a little more information here and there about it, but never much. That ends now. Chet tells us some about it. Bernie tells someone else about it. We even get some hints from other characters about it.\n\nI don’t know why Quinn’s decided now is the time to start clueing us in, but I’m so glad he did. We didn’t get the whole story—I don’t know if we will (and I’m not sure I care)—but we got a lot of it, and that’s enough for now.\n\nThe Trick to These Books\n\nThis is tied to the above point. The trickiest part about reading Chet as a narrator is that he doesn’t understand what he’s telling you, and because of that he leaves a lot out. He’s the best kind of unreliable narrator—he’s well-intentioned and honest, he believes what he’s telling us and he thinks he’s giving us all the information.\n\nWhat that means for the reader is that we have to think a little more about what he’s saying, we have to do almost as much detective work as Bernie to understand what’s really going on. Which is just so much fun, really. Sure, you might spend a couple of chapters with the wrong idea, but Quinn doesn’t let you keep the wrong idea for long.\n\nI need to spend time writing about this every time I talk about a Chet and Bernie book—I need to do better at this, but it’s hard. If I could describe it better, I’d probably get paid to do this stuff.\n\nSo, what did I think about Tender is the Bite?\n\nYes, Quinn gave us a great pair of characters that we love in Chet and Bernie. He gives us a good story. He plays with the unreliable narrator to reveal what he really wants to say. Put it all together and he gives us another great read in one of the most reliably satisfying series in print.\n\nRead this one. If this is your first time with Chet and Bernie, go back and read the rest after it. You’ll be glad you did.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this eARC from Macmillan-Tor/Forge via NetGalley in exchange for this post—thanks to both for this.\n\nThis post contains an affiliate link.
