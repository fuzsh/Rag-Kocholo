Elsewhere, at a trailer park, new parents Coop and Georgia admire their infant son, Spike, and Georgia suggests they move to RainCity to find employment. Claiming that big cities are “trouble,” Coop goes to a construction site, but he is turned down for work. Discouraged, Coop steals money from the company’s cash box and returns home to tell Georgia they are going to RainCity, after all. Meanwhile, Hawk arrives in the city and visits his past lover, Wanda, at her café. When Wanda shows Hawk an apartment for rent, he unsuccessfully attempts to rekindle their affair. At the RainCity police station, Lieutenant Gunther refuses Hawk’s request for a job, but Hawk suggests that he can be an asset to the force because of his association with “the other side.” Handing over his badge, Hawk warns that he can also cause trouble for the police. Some time later, at Wanda’s Café, Hawk meets a local thug named Rambo who reports that his boss, Hilly Blue, wants to hire Hawk. Coop and Georgia hitch their camper in the café parking lot, and as Wanda befriends Georgia, Coop joins forces with a poet named Solo, who offers $50 for assistance with a robbery that evening. Later, Wanda thanks Hawk for killing a criminal named Fat Adolph to protect her and for going to prison as a consequence. Despite her protests, they make love. The next morning, Wanda tells Hawk he can stay in the apartment for free under the condition that he does not force her into sex again and, later, she offers Georgia a job as a waitress. That night, Solo and Coop sell their stolen box of watches to a middleman named Leo, who is pleased they are undercutting Hilly Blue’s prices for black market jewelry. Afterwards, Solo and Coop rob a wealthy couple and use the cash to hire prostitutes. When Coop returns to the camper in the middle of the night, with new clothes and a haircut, Georgia throws him out. Watching the interaction from his apartment window, Hawk goes to the motor home and invites Georgia to dinner, but Coop returns and threatens him. As Hawk knocks Coop out, Georgia runs away with Spike and Hawk follows them through RainCity in Wanda’s car. Later, Solo and Coop meet with Leo to make another deal, but Leo has been intimidated by Hilly and is unwilling to conduct business. Sometime later, Georgia leaves Spike in a family’s convertible as they shop, and, when she regrets her decision, she finds the family has already disappeared with her son. Meanwhile, Solo and Coop meet Rambo at a Chinese restaurant. Although Rambo refuses to buy the stolen jewelry for their asking price, Hilly negotiates a deal with Solo and Coop for the proceeds of their next heist. Back at Wanda’s Café, Georgia returns and promises Hawk she will do anything to get her baby back. After waking Lieutenant Gunther and demanding his assistance, Hawk brings Spike back to the café. Dressed in a bathrobe, Georgia offers Hawk a cake, but he sends her away, explaining that he once killed a man. However, Hawk makes Georgia promise to have dinner with him the following evening. The next day, Coop’s camper is towed away and Wanda invites Georgia to stay with her. That night at dinner, Hawk gives Georgia a pin and although she enjoys their date, she is unwilling to kiss him goodnight. Meanwhile Solo and Coop rob jewelry from criminal kingpin Nate Nathanson and his young bride, Sonja, but as the robbers get away, Nathanson shoots at them and vows revenge. At Wanda’s Café the following morning, when Georgia asks Wanda about Hawk’s past, the café owner explains that he saved her life by killing Fat Adolph. Coop returns to the café and presents Georgia with a diamond necklace. Although Coop asks Georgia to go away with him, she refuses and Hawk comes to her aid, provoking a fight. As Georgia defends Coop, Hawk leaves the café, where he encounters Rambo and Hilly. Rambo invites Hawk to a party at Hilly’s mansion that evening because Hilly needs protection from Nate Nathanson. The gangster blames Hilly for the robbery of his wife’s jewels and wants revenge. Hawk refuses and is later discovered on the street by police officers, unconscious and intoxicated. Returning to Wanda’s Café, Hawk learns that Georgia has reunited with Coop, but when Georgia arrives at Coop’s hotel room, she discovers him partying with prostitutes. As Georgia runs into the street, Hawk saves her from oncoming traffic. Back at Hawk’s apartment, Georgia begs him to rescue Coop from a life of crime. Hawk agrees under the condition that Georgia devotes herself to him. Later, Hawk calls Coop, but the outlaw hangs up. When Coop’s phone rings again, Solo reports that Hilly wants to arrange a deal for Nathanson’s jewels. After the men agree to meet at Solo’s apartment, Solo prepares a trap. Meanwhile, Hawk follows Coop to Solo’s home. While Coop finds one of Hilly’s henchmen impaled on Solo’s trap, Hawk discovers Solo dead in a car filled with water. Back at his apartment, Hawk is met by Gunther, who demands to know Hawk’s involvement with Hilly and warns him to stay away from Coop. Gunther storms out of the apartment past Georgia, who has arrived home with groceries. Georgia explains to Hawk that Wanda is looking after Spike and the couple makes love. Later, Hawk goes to Hilly’s mansion for the party and Coop sneaks through the gates behind him. Hilly, who is cavorting with Nathanson despite their dispute, takes Hawk to his study. There, Hawk orders Hilly to spare Coop’s life, but Hilly retorts that Nathanson still suspects him of betrayal, even though he returned the jewels. Hilly claims that he must kill Coop to renew Nathanson’s trust. Just then, Coop breaks into the study with his gun drawn and demands money from Hilly. As Hilly takes out his wallet, Hawk grabs Coop’s gun and Hilly shoots at them. Returning fire, Hawk kills Hilly with a shot through the forehead and mayhem ensues at the party, leaving Rambo dead. When Hawk tells Coop to escape, the young criminal assumes that Hawk and Georgia are lovers. Coop walks through the party disheartened and unaffected by the gunshots surrounding him. Although Nathanson attempts to kill Coop, he is shot by one of Hilly’s henchmen. Wounded, Hawk returns home to find Georgia asleep, but leaves before waking her. Soon after, Coop arrives at Hawk’s apartment to beg Georgia for forgiveness. When she turns him away, Coop asks Georgia to thank Hawk for him and meets up with two soldiers to enlist in the military. Leaving RainCity, Hawk drives along a mountain pass and Georgia leans over to kiss him."
