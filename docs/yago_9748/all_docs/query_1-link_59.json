I thought that \"Rushmore\"\n\nwas an improvement on \"Bottle Rocket,\" and \"Tenenbaums\" was an improvement on\n\n\"Rushmore\"; at least up until \"The Life Aquatic\" (which I haven't seen, but\n\nwhich I hope will continue this trend), it's true that his formal sensibilities\n\nhave gotten more and more articulate and refined. Nevertheless,\n\n\"Tenenbaums,\" like the other films, is full of misguided or confused characters and raw,\n\ncomplicated emotions. This contrast, if you will, is a big subject in Jones'\n\nessay.\n\nI am thrilled to hear \"Hatari!\" (one of my top 10 movies) as a reference\n\npoint for the new film!\n\nPeter\n\n18602\n\nFrom: David Ehrenstein\n\nDate: Tue Dec 7, 2004 7:30pm\n\nSubject: Re: Re: Aviator\n\n--- thebradstevens"
