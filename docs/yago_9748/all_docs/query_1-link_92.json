        "text": "As I wrote last year, there’s nothing like a magic system in Southern Discomfort. There’s no explanation for how things works, which drives the newbies discovering magic nuts. Why does turning your clothes inside out counter the spell of the stray sod (a fae trick that works like a D&D Lose the Path spell)? Why does chopping off a hanged murderer’s hand create a magical talisman? Olwen McAlister, though she’s magical herself, has no idea. It works; that’s what matters right? She honestly doesn’t understand human curiosity — things work, why are the children of men so obsessed with the why?\n\nThat doesn’t mean “anything can happen,” the standard critique of fantasy from SF fans (those fantasy authors, they don’t write as rigorously and logically as science fiction, no sirree bob!). There are rules and I use them consistently. As one character says, healing magic can cure an ear infection or a pulled muscle, it can’t get rid of cancer.\n\n(As I don’t have any relevant illustrations, here’s Trixie at her absolute fluffiest. You’re welcome).\n\nI started figuring out the magic by leafing through Katharine Briggs’ Encyclopedia of Fairies, an exhaustive and fascinating guide to British fairies. From that I got ideas such as the stray sod, elf-shot, elven glamor that lets them deceive the eyes — Olwen looks to most people like an attractive woman in her forties, not the inhumanly beautiful daoine sidhe she really is — and their vulnerability to cold iron.\n\nThen I started to work out the details. Is cold iron the same as industrial steel alloys? Nope: steel is a non-starter and doesn’t burn them the way iron does. Does making the hand of glory require the hand of someone hung for murder or would someone who’s taken a life but isn’t a murderer qualify? What exactly are elves?\n\nThen I began to add stuff. Healing magic, which isn’t a sidhe gift, because it helped the plot a lot. Influenced by a character in the Mabinogion (a collection of Welsh legends, though Christianized) who can race along the tops of grass blades so swiftly and lightly the grass doesn’t bend, I made elves uncannily swift, though not (I think) feeling like conventional Flash-style super-speed.\n\nIn the Mabinogion, King Math, old and wise, can listen to the winds to learn secrets. I added that to Olwen’s repertoire too. Beyond that there’s an element of “the ruler and the land are one” — after 300 years in Pharisee, Olwen and her late husband Aubric are deeply plugged into the forces of nature. Which raises the question how Gwalchmai managed to reach their mansion and murder Aubric before the start of the book. It will be answered.\n\nAnd then I had to write it and (I hope) make it feel believable. That impossible things have intruded into Pharisee Georgia and growing increasingly impossible as the story progresses.\n\nIf all goes well (getting the cover done, for instance), you’ll be able to see what you think in a couple of months.\n\n#SFWApro. Flash cover by Carmine Infantino, all rights to images remain with current holders.\n\nLate last year I read a couple of books collecting Lester Dent’s early pulp series heroes, Lynn Lash, Lee Nace and Foster Fade. As I found that useful for working on Savage Adventures I thought I’d read some more …\n\nTERROR, INC.: The Weird Mysteries of Lester Dent is a collection of “menace” thrillers featuring various one-shot PIs tackling bizarre deaths — men turning into to skeletons, men bleeding to death through their pores, beheaded by a ray weapon and attacks by “The Invisible Horde” which uses an X-ray like beam to turn things and people transparent. Entertaining in their own right, and it’s easy to see elements Dent may have recycled into the Doc Savage series — invisibility in The Spook Legion, the skeleton death in Land of Fear, the beheading ray in The Headless Men (ghost-written by Alan Hathway).\n\nIn 1936, Dent stopped submitting (and presumably writing) Doc Savage stories for several months. Doc Savage expert Will Murray says there’s no clue to whether Dent wanted to take a break, hoped to walk away for good or what. During the sabbatical he submitted several detective stories to the critically acclaimed Black Mask magazine and also wrote GENIUS JONES. a screwball comedy that imagines Doc Savage a little differently.\n\nThe protagonist (who may have inspired a similar DC comics character a few years later) is the son of “Polar” Jones, an explorer who died in the Arctic leaving his son behind. With the help of the one surviving explorer and a ton of books, Jones educated himself in just about everything. However his lack of human contact gives him an almost Vulcan level of cluelessness about human behavior — and why does he get these strange feelings when he meets attractive women?\n\nThe plot involves a hardnosed millionaire who realizes Jones is that rarity, an honest man, and sets him a challenge: if he can find worthy recipients for a million dollars within one month, Jones will take charge of distributing the millionaire’s entire fortune. That’s very bad news for Lyman Lee, a scheming business associate (“Lyman Lee had gotten waiters fired for spilling soup on his jacket.”) who has his own plans for the money.\n\nWhile the handsome, brawny, brilliant Jones has a lot in common with Doc Savage, the screwball take is completely different in tone. This one was thoroughly engaging; while the book includes the outline for a sequel, regrettably we never got one. It works better for me than the similarly humorous Gadget Man stories do.\n\n#SFWApro. Top cover artist unknown; Genius Jones cover by Rudolph Belarski, all rights remain with current holder.\n\nAs I blogged about a couple of years ago, Republican vice-presidential candidate J.D. Vance claims parents of children should get more votes as childless people don’t have as much stake in the future. Which as I note at the link is nonsense: someone childless my niece’s age (around 30) has a lot of stake in the future as she’s (hopefully) going to spend 50 years living in it. More than say, someone Trump’s age or Rupert Murdoch’s — they’ll be dead of something long before the consequences of their policies kill them.\n\nAfter Biden stepped down in favor of Kamala Harris, Vance’s response was to dismiss her and all women without kids as “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives” and don’t have a stake in America a parent like himself does. Blake Masters — another protege of billionaire Peter Thiel — immediately agreed, as does vapid right-wing talking head Michael Knowles. Vance has since asserted that Of Course he’s not criticizing women without children, he’s attacking Democrats for being “anti-family and anti-child.” Nah, he’s going after the childless.\n\nThis is a sibling undead sexist cliche to “feminists are irrationally angry” Rather than feminists being pissed off because they’re too unfeminine to find a man, feminists are miserable because they can’t find a man. Sure, they have college degrees and cool jobs but then they go home and cry while they feed their cats in their sad, lonely apartment. Where they’re alone. With no man. Did I mention they’re pathetic and lonely?\n\nThis cliche goes back even before modern feminism got going. In the 1959 film Best of Everything, Hope Lange’s boss (Joan Crawford) is a cautionary tale: she’s spend so long doing unfeminine things like climbing the career ladder, she’s killed her womanly feelings and is incapable of love. After the feminist movement got going, it would be a standard right-wing trope — ignoring that many feminists were happily married and had kids (I know several). Harris, for instance, does have kids, albeit step-kids (worth noting, even though there’s no reason a childless cat lady wouldn’t be better fit for federal office than, say, JD Vance).\n\nIt also ties in with the right-wing conviction that women are babymakers first and foremost; if they aren’t willing to assume that role, by golly they should be pushed into it anyway! They are simply means to an end, whether that end is their husband’s wishes or society’s (hence Vance also supporting higher tax rates on the childless — as if parents don’t already get a number of tax breaks).\n\nNo surprise that Republicans such as Rep. Glen Grothman want us back in 1960 — before the landmark civil rights legislation of the 1960s, before women got the crazy idea they were ends in themselves and should be treated accordingly.\n\nIn other misogynist news:\n\nIn discussing the need for the feds to ban interstate travel by women who want abortions, Vance suggests George Soros will help black women get abortions!\n\nAnti-vax, anti-gay attorney Mat Staver says Kamala Harris has a Jezebel spirit. In religious circles, that’s another undead sexist cliche.\n\nOne Republican makes it clear that the Republican platform not calling for a national abortion ban won’t stop them banning it.\n\nNo, Roe v. Wade did not give women the right to abort any time for any reason. Republicans lie about this.\n\nA woman in Georgia went to a health center with a miscarriage, then left the fetus in the trash (which is legal in that state). Authorities say they’re looking for laws they can use to prosecute her.\n\nIn Oklahoma, some prosecutors say a pregnant woman licensed for medical marijuana needs a separate license for the fetus. One woman’s pushing back.\n\nFrom the perspective of the men running the Southern Baptist Conference, dominating women is more important than defending them from harassment. Former SBC leader Paige Patterson saw shielding churches from harassment lawsuits as perfectly compatible with good Christian behavior.\n\nIndependent investigations into sexual abuse cases are good …unless they’re part of the coverup.\n\nChristian-dictator wannabe Joel Webbon says women having influence in society is bad because “it’s going to be really hard for us to get friends hired, enemies fired, those kinds of things because those are things that men do.” This seems like a good argument for Kamala Harris, frankly because Webbon’s idea of a good society sounds horrible.\n\nThe Doc Savage novels Spook Hole and Colors for Murder both use ambergris, an essential ingredient in perfume making at the time, as a McGuffin. That got me interested enough to read Floating Gold: A Natural (and Unnatural) History of Ambergris by Christopher Kemp.\n\nContrary to some accounts, ambergris isn’t sperm whale puke but some sort of whale excrement, forming around the indigestible beaks of squid (something sperm whale love to eat) and either popping out the back end or floating free when the whale dies and the carcass decays (there’s a lot still unknown about the process). After year of drifting on the sea, it forms a hard substance that can enhance the smell and duration of perfume. Once essential to all perfumiers it’s used much less now due to concern over cetacean rights, though some of the dealers Kemp talks to claim it’s as in-demand now as ever.\n\nThe ambergris stuff is fascinating but Kemp spends more time talking about his personal odyssey hunting for ambergris on various beaches and Kemp is not fascinating. It was still worth reading but if you can’t put up with the personal stuff (or you like writers putting themselves in the story more than I do), skip it.\n\nTOM PAINE’S IRON BRIDGE: Building a United States by Edward D. Gray argues that Paine, author of the anti-monarchy, pro-independence Common Sense was less the wild-eyed radical ready to tear down established institutions and equally concerned with building the new country up. One of the challenges for creating a country in North America was that the English colonial footprint was huge and split up by countless rivers. Nor did were bridge designs in the late 18th century able to withstand flooding or ice without being bulky enough to block river traffic.\n\nPaine’s solution was to build bridges with large arches out of iron. The title refers to a sample bridge he made in England, showing he’d gotten around the technical challenges of iron bridges; however in a colonial era where forested land was everywhere, laminated wood proved a more popular choice in Paine’s lifetime. The book makes for an interesting look at American infrastructure and bridge-building methods in Paine’s day.\n\nBURN IT DOWN: Power, Complicity and a Call for Change in Hollywood by Maureen Ryan is a blistering look at toxic workplaces (including Lost and Saturday Night Live), psycho bosses, sexual harassers, the many myths that excuse them — comedy should offend people! Being a jerk is the director’s creative process! — bosses who turn a blind eye as long as the money keeps coming in and rapists who get redemption without earning it. A depressingly familiar picture (a lot of the details were new to me) and the chapter on how to change things was weak — but in fairness, that’s a very big and difficult question. Definitely worth reading.\n\n#SFWApro. Cover by Emery Clarke, all rights to image remain with current holder.\n\nAfter several mediocre Howard Hawks films, my watching gets to a classic with his BRINGING UP BABY (1938). Cary Grant plays super-serious, head-centered paleontologist David Huxley, about to enter a largely passionate marriage (“There will be no entanglements.”). Then he meets heiress Susan Vance (Katherine Hepburn) who generates chaos in everything she does. She also drags him out of his dry-as-dust comfort zone and gives him one hell of a good time (a good bad girl in terms of a taxonomy I once coined).\n\nThe film is delightfully daffy and funny; Hepburn plays against her usual type (just as confident, a lot less tough) as does Grant and they’re backed up by a variety of colorful supporting characters, not to mention a pet leopard. Despite all of which, the movie bombed, ending Hawks’ relationship with RKO and killing Hepburn’s career (she bounced back a couple of years later with The Philadelphia Story). Hawks himself blamed it on having too many eccentrics and no normal people to serve as an anchor. Perhaps that’s it — but what’s more important is, 1938 audiences were wrong. The film is marvelous (and the inspiration for one of my personal favorites, What’s Up Doc?). “If one more person mentions that she’s got an aunt I’ll put you on bread and water for 20 days!”\n\nHE’S ALL THAT (2021) is a teen rom-com built around a premise I’ve seen before, a Makeover Bet where a teenage influencer sets out to turn a dour outsider into the school’s prom king. Only it turns out there’s more to him than being surly and he finds she’s not as shallow as he thought — but will their love survive learning about the bet? Nothing I needed to see, but pleasant enough to fill 90 minutes. “Smelling my hand is the horse’s equivalent of saying hello.”\n\nZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO (2008) when lifelong Dioscuri and current roommates Emily Banks and Seth Rogan decide that’s the quickest way to resolve their ongoing cash crunch. Fortunately their feelings for each other are completely platonic so having sex on camera with other people won’t bother either of them … right? Kevin Smith’s film has a rom-com heart under its raunch, though as usual I’m irked by the assumption straight opposite-sex friends can’t be really platonic. Brandon Routh and Deb Mazar play former classmates; Traci Lords plays a professional porn actor. “I call that look ‘Nickelodeon chic.’”\n\nFIERCE CREATURES (1997) reuses the Fish Called Wanda cast in an unrelated story. When Rupert Murdoch-clone Kevin Kline appoints John Cleese to takeover a small British zoo, Cleese is under orders to weed out every non-fierce creature (I feel this is a parody of When Animals Attack videos). Can the zookeepers (including Michael Palin) change his mind? Kevin Kline plays a second role as the CEO’s marketing-expert son (“We have eliminated the non-event interest deficit!”) and Jamie Lee Curtis is a sexy career woman. A fun absurdity. “Contrary to all available evidence, you actually think people like you.”\n\n#SFWApro. All rights to images remain with current holders.\n\nNot really that bad, just me being melodramatic. Rereading Silver Age comics en masse can have that effect.\n\nNot as bad as Sgt. Rock on the Joe Kubert cover above, either, though earlier in the week I did feel that exhausted.\n\nFirst, Sunday night: TYG came home from a social event in the early morning. I would probably have gone back to sleep except she dragged me to see Wisp, thinking something was wrong. It probably was: she was reluctant to be touched, reluctant to move … but after 20 minutes examining her I couldn’t get back to sleep. Fortunately by Monday she’d recovered from whatever it was so we didn’t have to take her to the vet.\n\nThen Monday night Plushie had a freakout over a thunderstorm and climbed on top of me. We’d doped him up earlier and it kicked in after around an hour of trying to comfort him. Wide-awake again, couldn’t get back to sleep. Same thing happened Tuesday night.\n\nOh, and I’d noticed some sensitivity to pressure on my upper-right molars so Tuesday I took time out to go to the dentist. Tooth under my filling had cracked so I came home with a temporary crown. Added to lack of sleep my productivity went down.\n\nAnd to top it off, Snowdrop has some odd sores on his ears. We moved up his annual vet appointment to yesterday. He came in for breakfast, TYG shut the door and then it was three hours of repeated pleading to go out. After that he went in the cage and TYG took him to the vet. Good news: the sores are just mosquito bites and he’s otherwise healthy. And I did get some cute photos of him in the morning.\n\nNeedless to say, three hours of plaintive meows put me off my game the rest of the day, which I’d anticipated. But that didn’t make me like it any better.\n\nAnd I took Plushie in today for a “just in case” checkup — looks like it’s nothing but TYG suspects a problem (not a major one, thank goodness) and her instincts are good.\n\nLike last week, my output was sub-par. A Local Reporter article on a candidate for Carrboro city council. Atomic Junk Shop articles on some Marvel stories from ’68 and why the next couple of years are a blank spot in my comics-reading history. Various odds and ends, contractor appointments and so on.\n\nOn the plus side, I got some good work done on Southern Discomfort. First I went over the book and made sure all the streets I used made sense. A couple of times they didn’t — the Peachtree/Douglass intersection in one scene is the King Street intersection in another — but that’s now fixed. I did the same with the layout of Gwalchmai’s home. That was more complicated as I have to have Joan and Maria steal something from one of the rooms. The original location of the room didn’t work for that so I moved things around.\n\nAnd then I ran it through Draft2Digital‘s bookmaking process, then took the PDF and ran it through Amazon’s hard-copy printing process. I don’t have a cover yet but as with past books, I simply snatched one off Amazon’s covers on offer. What I want is to have the finished book so I can give it one final edit.\n\nAlso I read a couple of key scenes from the book to the writing group Tuesday night. They gave them big thumbs up, which is good. I also got an invite for a final beta-reading which I accepted — I think I have time to make any last-minute changes if need be.\n\nSo that was good but between our pets’ issues, the dentist and exhaustion, I’ve underperformed as a writer this month. Better than a year ago when we were caring for Wisp after she tore her tendon.\n\nLet’s hope August gets back in the swing of things.\n\n#SFWApro. All rights to images remain with current holders.\n\nIn rereading The Essential Jekyll and Hyde, I came across a great quote by Robert Louis Stevenson in the footnotes. He’s explaining that no, Jekyll’s problem is hypocrisy, not sex and that being “a voluptuary” is not inherently bad. However, “the sexual field and the business field are perhaps the two best fitted for the display of cruelty and cowardice and selfishness.”\n\nOne of the standard rationales given by Puritans and religious conservatives (not all puritans are religious) for being so restrictive about sex is that it’s a powerful, destabilizing force that has to be controlled. As Christian feminist Samantha Field points out, this is one of those “every accusation is a confession” things — they believe humans have no natural restraints so society has to restrain them (which leads to conservatives declaring sexual consent is unimportant). Though in practice, of course, that usually means restraining women, not men.\n\nIt’s certainly true that sex is a powerful force that leads to us making bad decisions — especially when it’s mixed with ideas like “the woman’s consent doesn’t matter.” But the same is true of business, as Stevenson says. Believing slavery was Christian was an immoral decision but it makes great sense as a business position. Slaves were good business. Slave labor was good for business.\n\nYet a lot of the same conservatives who want to bottle up and control sex are dedicated to shielding and deregulating business as much as possible. And pretending this could not possibly have any bad side effects.\n\nFree-market crusader Alan Greenspan, for instance, pushed for liberalizing regulations on banks and on companies giving investment advice from which they stood to profit. That was a major factor in the 2008 financial crisis. In hindsight, Greenspan said later, he “made a mistake in presuming that the self-interests of organizations, specifically banks and others, were such that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firms.”\n\nSee also Purdue Pharma and Elizabeth Holmes.\n\nUnfortunately we’re only worse off than in 2008. Conservatives are still committed to bringing back the laissez-faire no-regulation economy of the 19th century. Many liberals want to go soft on prosecuting business criminals. The Supreme Court is doing its best to gut the government’s regulatory power completely.\n\nWant some examples? Amazon’s One Medical switched its helpline to a call center that often gives bad advice.\n\nIn the same vein a former Cigna Medical Director says the company pressured her to review cases too fast.\n\n“We’ve generally come to accept that when a product is free to use, we are not simply the users: We become the product, monetized over and over.”\n\nVenture capitalist Marc Andressen says he’s grateful the opioid epidemic keeps white trash complacent.\n\nIn the unregulated world of home health tests, “incremental scientific innovations can be quickly funded, brought to market and peddled to consumers online before their health benefit has been proved.”\n\nSometimes bad business and bad sex go hand in hand.\n\nFlorida’s meat industry doesn’t fancy competition from lab-grown meat. So they’ve gotten DeSantis to ban it.\n\nA man worth $16 billion is still allegedly willing to break the law to make an extra $400,000.\n\nThen there’s Boeing and its defective airplanes.\n\nAs John Keynes once said, looking to a better future “The love of money as a possession – as distinguished from the love of money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of life – will be recognised for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semicriminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease.” We are, alas, a long way from that future.\n\nFollowing John Byrne’s departure from Wonder Woman, we got three issues written by James Owsley that have completedly vanished from memory. Which may be a good thing — outside of Owsley’s Black Panther run, I can’t remember liking any of his work, including his last Wonder Woman script. Fortunately Eric Luke took over after that.\n\nI don’t recall what I thought of Luke’s work back in 1999. I didn’t pick it up but that may reflect money was tight or that after dropping the book during the Byrne years, I saw no need to start again. My completist tendencies were long dead by 1999.\n\nReading Luke first year, from 139 to 150, it’s a mixed bag — more interesting than I thought, though flawed. The main arc involves the return of Cronus, father of Zeus, lord of the Titans. He’s decided he wants to resume his standing as god-king of the world and he’s spawned a new crop of Titans to help him do it. Most notable of his allies is Devastation, Wonder Woman’s evil quasi-twin. Taking the same clay that Hippolyta shaped into Diana, Cronus has created Devastation as his own warrior champion, the Amazon’s nemesis.\n\nNot only is Devastation a nasty, cunning piece of work and a vicious fighter, she leaves Diana questioning her actions. If Cronus can create Devastation as an instrument of his evil does Diana have any greater agency? Is she just a puppet for Olympus. This gets resolved at the end when Zeus explains that in George Perez’ reboot origin, Diana has a clay body but a mortal soul, with agency.\n\nThe downside is that Luke draws on Byrne’s dreadful Godwave idea. Byrne decided it would be awesome if Jack Kirby, creator of so much comic-book mythology, literally created mythology. The Godwave, the energy from the final clash of Jack Kirby’s Old Gods, echoed out and turned ordinary humans into the deities of Greek and other mythology. Cronus’ plan is to kill pantheons, vacuum up all that Godwave energy, then attack Heaven itself.\n\nMuch as I have grown to respect Kirby’s New Gods work, I rate the Olympians much higher than the gods of New Genesis. Kirby creating them (and the Asgardians, the Aztec pantheon, etc.) didn’t work for me (Perez retconned the idea out during his run. Byrne wrote it back in, of course). The assumption that it’s power enough to take down God in heaven doesn’t work for me either.\n\nI have mixed thoughts about bringing in the Hindu pantheon too (with Prince Rama as a possible romance for Wonder Woman). Comic-books invariably treat the Hindu gods as roughly at the same level as the Olympians or the Asgardians, rather than a religion like Christianity or Judaism. Even given that Cronus takes on the Christian deity, Luke still seems to set Kali, Shiva and the rest as more myth than religion (my thoughts at Atomic Junk Shop on the theology of DC and Marvel might be relevant).\n\nOverall, I did enjoy Luke’s first year. I’ll get to his subsequent run soon enough.\n\n#SFWApro. Wonder Woman covers by Adam Hughes, New Gods by Jack Kirby."
