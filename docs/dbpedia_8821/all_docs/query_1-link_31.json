        "text": "We just photographed Jennifer and Ben’s beautiful Upper Shirley Vineyard wedding just outside of Richmond.\n\nIt is one of my favorite wedding venues. We don’t shoot there enough. The staff there is wonderful. Their property is gorgeous. There’s a beautiful getting ready room for the bride and the groom. The ceremony space is absolutely perfect. As is the back up location because they have beautiful porches surrounding their building. It’s right on the James River and it’s got to be the closest vineyard to Richmond.\n\nWhen you have an Upper Shirley Vineyard wedding, it’s typically a little later because they do have a vineyard and restaurant that’s open. So on wedding days they close a little early and the full property of Upper Shirley is available of the wedding.\n\nI could talk about so many things. I loved about this wedding, but let’s just touch on a few. The first is that they worked with the Wedding Company of Williamsburg. Laura was there planner and she just did in an absolutely amazing job with this Upper Shirley Vineyard wedding. She was so fantastic to work with.\n\nAnother thing I loved about this wedding day was that Ben has three daughters. And I just think they did such a good job including them throughout the wedding day. They had matching dresses to all of the bridesmaids and actually walked down the aisle with Ben for the ceremony.\n\nThe four of them walking down the aisle was my favorite part. They four of them walked to the end of the aisle then stopped and broke out sunglasses and danced down the aisle. It was so fun and hysterical. I loved it so much.\n\nThen another was that after Jennifer and Ben shared their vows to each other – Jennifer had also written vows to the three daughters. It was just such a sweet moment and such a nice way to honor them during the wedding. I just loved it.\n\nThe weather was so perfect – and we were able to have photo time with them right on the water with the gorgeous light. Then celebrated the rest of the night with a huge party.\n\nEnjoy a few of our many favorites from this Upper Shirley Vineyard wedding.\n\nCongrats you guys!"
