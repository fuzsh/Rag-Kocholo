        "text": "In 2019, I worked at lots of Virginia wedding venues, and it was so fun once again celebrating my sweet couples and designing for them! The 2017 and the 2018 Where to Wed blogs were both such a hit that I decided to highlight my favorite Virginia wedding venues again from this past year! I have been to many different venues throughout the years, and I thought it would be helpful for any of my engaged readers to share my favorites (it was SO hard to choose), and features I love of each!! That way, you can use this as a guide if YOU are still searching for that perfect wedding venue for your big day! So, in no particular order, here are 10 wedding venues that you are sure to love!\n\n1. Veritas Vineyard\n\nIf you are a bride who loves vineyard weddings with an organic, natural outside feel, and an upscale and romantic indoor look, then Veritas Vineyard in Afton, Virginia, (outside of Charlottesville) might be place for you! My favorite feature is how the reception space is entirely draped from floor to ceiling- it creates such a bright and airy backdrop for the reception! The large back deck is also the perfect spot for sipping wine and taking in the sunset over the Virginia mountains! Photography from Early Mountain Vineyard wedding by Corrin Jasinski Photography. See this romantic early spring wedding HERE!\n\n2. Upper Shirley Vineyard\n\nIf you love vineyard weddings, with a variety of photo spots (in the vines, down by the water, on the back deck, and more), and a beautiful reception room, than check out Upper Shirley Vineyard, in Charles City, Virginia! With its sprawling back lawn, and water views, couples can opt to get married right down by the water, and then have guests head back up the oversized porch for cocktails and treats. Photography of the Upper Shirley wedding is by Shannon Moffit Photography. See this lovely wedding featured on our portfolio HERE!\n\n3. Army Navy Country Club\n\nArmy Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia is such a classic, modern, and elegant ballroom, with the outdoor patio hosting wedding ceremonies! My favorite feature here is that the ceremony patio directly overlooks downtown DC and specifically the Washington Monument, so you can have that in the backdrop of your ceremony photos! Photography from Early Mountain Vineyard wedding by Corrin Jasinski Photography. See this romantic fall wedding HERE!\n\n4. Middleburg Barn\n\nMiddleburg Barn is situated on rolling hills right and is in the middle of Virginia horse country! If you love romantic, cozy barn weddings, this could be the place for you! With its gorgeous wooden beams inside juxtaposed by the elegant crystal chandeliers, this is the perfect spot for an elegant but still down to earth wedding! Photography from Middleburg Barn wedding by Katie Nesbitt Photography. This gorgeous fall wedding is coming to the blog soon!\n\n5. Early Mountain Vineyards, Madison, Virginia\n\nFor the third time, EMV makes the list! If you are a bride who loves vineyard weddings with an organic, natural and cozy look, with the option for a beautiful indoor OR outdoor ceremony, then Early Mountain Vineyards in Madison, Virginia might be for you! My favorite feature is it its romantic roaring fireplaces on either side of its large reception space! Photography from Early Mountain Vineyard wedding by Bethany Snyder Photography. See this romantic early spring wedding HERE!\n\n7. Westover Plantation\n\nWestover Plantation is an absolutely stunning southern venue, located about 40 minutes outside of Richmond in Charles City, Virginia! It overlooks the James River, and there are many options for the ceremony location throughout the property, including the waterfront. Tented receptions are so beautiful here, and with so many tent options available through vendor partners, Westover Plantation really does offer so much versatility and the ability to design your wedding from the “ground up” – literally! Photography of the Westover Plantation wedding is by Kristine Pringle Photography. This lovely fall wedding is coming to the blog soon!\n\n8. The Historic Post Office\n\nIf you are a bride who loves a modern, blank-slate venue in which you can design your wedding, and the most beautiful bridal suite, then you would love the Historic Post Office, in Hampton, Virginia! The HPO has gorgeous indoor and outdoor details, with lovely hardwood floors, a grand staircase, and the getting ready areas are top-notch! Photography from Historic Post Office wedding from Dear Lovers Photography. See this beautiful wedding featured on our blog HERE!!\n\n9. Chrysler Museum\n\nIf you love clean, modern backdrops, with elegant details and unique artwork for your guests to enjoy, then you would love the Chrysler Museum, located in Downtown Norfolk. Its grand staircase makes for an amazing entrance into your wedding reception, and with the vast ceilings and bright backdrop, tall centerpieces and uplighting always look amazing! This gorgeous September wedding is coming to the blog soon!!\n\n10. Mount Ida Vineyard"
