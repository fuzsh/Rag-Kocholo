        "text": "General Information - West Virginia University\n\nWest Virginia University (WVU) was founded in 1867 as a result of the 1862 Land-Grant Act, otherwise known as the Morrill Act. As the state’s flagship, land-grant university, WVU’s mission reflects its dedication to serving the state and citizens of West Virginia through access to higher education, research and scholarship, and comprehensive health sciences. The WVU system includes the flagship campus in Morgantown, WVU Institute of Technology in Beckley, WVU Potomac State in Keyser, and several other locations across the stat serving health science programs. The West Virginia University Rocert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center has five schools serving undergraduate, graduate, and professional students at four locations in Morgantown, Charleston, Bridgeport and Martinsburg.\n\nWest Virginia University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Many WVU programs hold specialized accreditation.\n\nWVU Morgantown provides programs of instruction through 11 colleges and schools and offers over 300 majors at the baccalaureate, master’s, doctoral, and professional levels, as well as numerous certificate programs, both in-person and online.\n\nWVU Morgantown facilities are built on more than 1,000 acres and include several buildings on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nWVU Potomac State College, situated in West Virginia’s Eastern Panhandle in Keyser, offers associate and baccalaureate degree programs and serves both residential and commuting students. WVU Institute of Technology is located in Beckley, and serves the region and the state by offering technology-intensive baccalaureate degree programs.\n\nThe WVU Extension Service has offices in all of West Virginia’s 55 counties, staffed by county agents. WVU operates experimental farms and forests throughout the state, as well as WVU Jackson's Mill, near Weston, WV, home of West Virginia 4-H camping and the West Virginia Fire Academy.\n\nVisit About WVU for updated WVU facts and achievements.\n\nIn this section:\n\nWVU Mission\n\nWVU Vision\n\nWVU Values\n\nCommitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nWest Virginia University Center for Excellence in Disabilities\n\nOffice of Accessibility Services\n\nWVU Mission\n\nAs a land-grant institution, the faculty, staff and students at West Virginia University commit to creating a diverse and inclusive culture that advances education, healthcare and prosperity for all by providing access and opportunity; by advancing high-impact research; and by leading transformation in West Virginia and the world through local, state and global engagement.\n\nWVU Vision\n\nAs One West Virginia University, we are purposeful in our studies and our work so that we can partner with our communities-both near and far-to bring needed and valued solutions to real-life problems within the pillars of education, healthcare and prosperity.\n\nWVU Values\n\nService: We seek opportunities to serve others and are committed to providing the highest quality of service.\n\nCuriosity: We ask questions, seek new opportunities, and change through innovation.\n\nRespect: We are respectful, transparent and inclusive with each other.\n\nAccountability: We perform at our very best every day to create a University that is responsive, efficient and effective.\n\nAppreciation: We support and value each other’s contributions as we build a community that is One WVU.\n\nResearch and Scholarship\n\nAs West Virginia’s flagship research institution, WVU undertakes scholarly activity to improve the lives of West Virginians and others across the globe. WVU is classified as a Doctoral University-Highest Research Activity (R1) in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.\n\nService\n\nWest Virginia University’s land-grant mission underscores its obligation to serve the public and the state of West Virginia by promoting economic development, enhancing the well-being and the quality of life of the people of West Virginia, and increasing opportunities for the citizens of the state through workforce education, lifelong learning, and outreach to every county.\n\nWest Virginia University is the only institution in West Virginia to earn the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching “Community Engagement Classification.”\n\nWVU’s dedication to its service mission is manifested through its instructional programs, educational outreach, and initiatives and centers that engage external constituencies and support public service.\n\nWVU Extension Service\n\nThe Smith-Lever Act of 1914 created a Cooperative Extension Service for each land-grant institution. The purpose of the Extension Service was to disseminate the findings of the universities’ agricultural stations and provide training and programs on home economics and other practical subjects. WVU has sustained its commitment to the state by supporting an Extension Service office with a presence in all of West Virginia’s 55 counties, staffed by county agents.\n\nThe educational programs and initiatives of the WVU Extension Service focus on service to the state and exemplify West Virginia University’s commitment to the public good by connecting the knowledge and research of WVU with citizen and community needs. The Extension Service’s programs are driven by four major initiatives: (1) 4-H youth development; (2) family and health; (3) agriculture and natural resource education; and (4) community, workforce, and economic development.\n\nBack to Top\n\nCommitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nWest Virginia University is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive culture by promoting diversity, inclusion, equality, and intercultural and intercommunity outreach. Accordingly, the University does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, age, physical or mental disability, marital or family status, pregnancy, veteran status, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity, or gender expression in the administration of any of its educational programs, activities, or with respect to admission or employment.\n\nIn keeping with this commitment, members of the academic community are expected to demonstrate civility and mutual respect for all persons as well as understanding and appreciation for all persons, to express that perspective in every dimension of the institution’s life and mission, and to work cooperatively, representing not only the interests of their own groups but also those of the wider community.\n\nIndividuals believing they may have been illegally discriminated against by any member of the university community at West Virginia University may file a complaint with the Division of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.\n\nBack to Top\n\nCenter for Excellence in Disabilities\n\nThe WVU CED is available for students, staff, and faculty.
