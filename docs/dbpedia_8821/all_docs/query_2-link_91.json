While you should definitely visit all 17 state parks, this road trip through Southern Delaware will show you the best of Delaware’s coastal region!\n\nStop 1: Cape Henlopen State Park Start your trip at Cape Henlopen State Park in Lewes, Delaware. The park is situated at the point where the Delaware Bay meets the Atlantic Ocean, creating a unique combination of natural wonders and cultural history. The bay and ocean ecosystems allow for a wide array of wildlife. During WWII, the park’s strategic location at the mouth of the Delaware Bay led to the creation of a military base called Fort Miles. There is so much to do at Cape Henlopen, but during your stop make sure you don’t miss the Seaside Nature Center, the Point overlook, and the Gordon’s Pond Trail.\n\nStop 2: Delaware Seashore State Park From Cape Henlopen, continue south on Route 1 – Delaware’s Coastal Highway – to Delaware Seashore State Park, located just south of Rehoboth and Dewey.

It’s also my home state. I try not to write too much about it – but it is understandably challenging at times!

The West Branch Susquehanna Byway is home to a number of adventures that awaits you at every turn. The West Branch Susquehanna Byway is a scenic and natural beauty that is a must see. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Susquehanna River was a lifeline of historic Clearfield County. The River served as the lumber transport system that fueled the once-booming economy.\n\nThe byway was primarily named after the river because of its historical significance. However, they also share the name because the byway provides access to the abundance of recreational opportunities that the Susquehanna River offers, both on its banks and in its waters.\n\nThe West Branch Susquehanna Byway offers seventy-two miles of winding roads showcasing historic, archeological, cultural, recreational, natural and scenic rarities that are inherent of Clearfield County. This byway is a great outlet for the outdoorsman, civil war buff, foodie, photographer, and the explorer.\n\nByway Attractions\n\nMcGees Mills Covered Bridge\n\nThis Bridge is the only covered bridge crossing the mighty Susquehanna River and the only one still being used in Clearfield County. The 122 ft. single span Burr arch truss bridge was built in 1873 by Thomas A. McGee. Thomas built the bridge using hand hewed white pine timbers from the area and at a cost of $175. It was the last covered bridge built in Clearfield County. Thousands of rafts floated under the bridge including the last raft in 1938. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and renovated in 1994 after a collapse caused by record-breaking ice and snow. This scenic spot remains one of the most popular photographic attractions in Clearfield County and is also located at the very beginning or end of the West Branch Susquehanna Byway.\n\nBilger’s Rocks\n\nOver 300 million years ago, before the settlers, before the Indians, way back when the earth was taking its shape; a city was built just outside of Grampian in Clearfield County. This prehistoric city was like none other, for it was made of massive rocks. Twenty acres of massive rocks to be exact. Some of the rocks tower of five stories high and most of them are over 20 feet thick. The geological phenomenon responsible for this masterpiece is known as frost wedging. Frost wedging causes boulders to break away from the mountainside and helped create this magnificent vision full of numinous caverns and narrow passageways that has withstood eons of vagaries. There are 170 acres of park land where the Bilger’s Rocks Association offers campsites, pavilions, picnic area, a concert arena, recreational activities and even a concession stand that is open every weekend. www.bilgersrock.net\n\nCurwensville Lake\n\nCurwensville Lake is a reservoir located just to the south of the town of Curwensville. The lake was formed due to the construction of the Curwensville Dam to the north of the lake. Before the dam was built, there were several floods occurring along the West Branch Susquehanna River, affecting the towns of Curwensville, and Clearfield to the north. On September 3, 1954 a Flood Control Act was passed due to the flooding along the West Branch river basin. The dam cost $20,400,000 to construct. Curwensville Lake offers many opportunities to entertain the whole family. Biking, hiking, boating, camping and fishing are just a few of the activities available at Curwensville Lake. And with no horse power regulations on the lake, visitors can enjoy the open waters with their boat and spend some relaxing time catching some of the freshwater fish.\n\nDenny’s Beer Barrel Pub\n\nDenny’s was founded by Denny and Jean Liegey in September 1977. Denny’s started making giant hamburgers to attract attention and to create a fun atmosphere for all. Denny’s is known nationally as the home of the “World’s Largest Hamburger Challenges.” It all started with a 2 lb. hamburger challenge with homemade buns baked in a coffee can and the rest is history. Denny’s became famous in 1998 for “The Ye Olde 96er” and have been featured on tv shows like Rachel Ray, The Food Network, Travel Channel, Good Morning America and many more. Guests have dined from all 50 states and many from countries around the world.\n\nThe West Branch Susquehanna Byway is a beautiful scenic back road and fun byway.
