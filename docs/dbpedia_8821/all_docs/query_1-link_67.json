        "text": "My Favorite Virginia Wineries\n\nThere are so many reasons that lead me to the wineries and vineyards of Virginia. The first may be obvious: the wine. I’m a regular wine drinker and at some point I realized I could get to know my wines a lot better by going right to the source. The second reason is the view. Virginia wineries always rest in magical nooks of forests, hills, ponds, and groves. I experience a distinct feeling when I drive up to a tasting room past rows and rows of vines. It’s as if I’ve left the real world and entered one more in touch with nature, the terroir. The third reason is people. When you take a trip to a winery with friends and loved ones, you’ve already made a commitment to put your phones away (except for a few epic pics) and truly pay attention to one another, to relax, and to unwind. Every trip to a winery has resulted in a deeper relationship with my companions. I usually meet a few interesting people along the way, too. I’m not saying the wine doesn’t help, either.\n\nVirginia wine pro tip: While I’m a big red wine fan, I’ve learned to always ask to try the Viognier if I’m visiting a Virginia winery. That’s the grape we’re known best for growing. It’s great way to measure different Virginia wineries up against each other. But, as always you should drink what you want. Don’t worry about feeling like you have to drink something to impress anyone. At the end of the day, if you want chocolate cake, don’t order the gelato.\n\nVeritas\n\n151 Veritas Ln, Afton, VA 22920\n\nI’ve visited Veritas a few times. I wrote about it years ago when I visited for a friend’s bachelorette winery trip. See a bunch of other Charlottesville area wineries in this post. I returned for the winery’s regular Starry Nights events. I’ve tried pretty much everything on the wine list here. Not one has disappointed. I especially like the Scintilla for a sparkling wine option. I took it home to Lake Anna and shared it with a close friend. It was light, crisp, and not too sweet. I’d make a point to visit this spot during the fall. You’ll have a hard time finding a better view.\n\nBlenheim Vineyards\n\n31 Blenheim Farm, Charlottesville, VA 22902\n\nMy favorite red wine comes from Blenheim Vineyards. The Painted Red has always gone down smoothly and boy does it go down even smoother with the views of this slice of heaven. This winery has a loyal following not only for its wines and views but also for its current owner Dave Matthews. It was famous long ago for other famous dwellers: Thomas and Martha Jefferson are said to have “rested and warmed themselves” here at “Blenheim Hosue” after their coach stalled nearby during a snowstorm.\n\nMount Ida Reserve\n\nI spent an incredible day at Mount Ida Reserve. You can read more about it in this blog post. Set on a 5,000-acre working farm, the vineyards span 27 acres. The tasting room offers a full menu of food options, some created with beef straight from the Mount Ida Reserve farm to pair with their hand-picked wines. They offer regular rotating wine flights and beers, as well. The epic views offer up an enchanting painting to enjoy with friends and family for hours on end.\n\nBreaux Vineyards\n\n36888 Breaux Vineyards Ln, Purcellville, VA 20132\n\nHeading to Loudon County, another one of our signature Virginia wine regions, Breaux Vineyards is a standout. It offers another sprawling tasting room with several sitting options and far-reaching views. The Grab & Geaux area was loaded with gourmet snacks and they had gourmet chocolates, which made me very happy. The 104-acre vineyard is nestled between the foothills of the Blue Ridge and Short Hill Mountains. Watch my recap reel here.\n\nDoukenie Winery\n\n14727 Mountain Rd, Hillsboro, VA 20132\n\nEvery year for my birthday, my dad and his wife take me on a winery adventure. It is always the most meaningful quality time we get to spend together all year. We deliberately sit, sip, drink, talk, appreciate the views and hug a lot. These two live in Loudon County and get around Northern Virginia quite often. They spend all year scoping out new places to take me to. Doukenie remains one of their favorites, and therefore it is mine. There’s lots of room to go for a long saunter around the pond. The staff is light-hearted and friendly. I don’t think I’ve ever visited when live music wasn’t playing, which is a favorite for me.\n\nStone Tower Winery\n\n19925 Hogback Mountain Rd, Leesburg, VA 20175\n\nThis gem has it all: views, fresh barbecue, small plates, and multiple hangout areas. It’s rare that a winery nails the food situation, but we always come with room for food here. As for wine, most recently, I ordered up a white and rosé tasting flight, which was perfect for a warmer summer day. For reds, I really love the Hogback Mountain for something everyone will love. It was a universal favorite in our crew especially paired with some barbecue. If I lived closer, I’d become a member. Membership grants you access to some of the more picturesque spots and premier access to reservations. As large as this spot is, it’s usually full. It’s best to come early or be a member. This winery is definitely a must for my regular birthday winery crawls.\n\nTarara Winery\n\nJolene Family Winery\n\n2750 Pocahontas Trail, Quinton, VA 23141\n\nOfficially the closest winery to my Arts District apartment in Richmond, Jolene Family Winery was a welcome addition to the Virginia winery lineup. Next to a calming, lush lake, the winery features a sprawling stone patio, chic tasting room, covered “green house” and plenty of space on the grass by the water to drop up your own chairs. You can also splurge and rent a Lakeside Lounge tent that fit up to 8 people–perfect for a birthday or baby shower. The winery regularly welcomes food trucks and other local food vendors like RVA Cheese Girl. We really loved the Lakeview White wine for a light, mid-summer refresher.\n\nGood Luck Cellars\n\n1025 Goodluck Rd, Kilmarnock, VA 22482\n\nThis is located on the coastal region of Virginia, yet tucked away in quiet rolling hills. There is something laid back and quirky about Good Luck Cellars. Fridays always turn into a party for Wine Down Fridays with live music. You can enjoy local seafood served up by food trucks like Byrd’s Seafood. They are a fun and creative winery, offering unique specials all the time like wine popsicles in the summer! We had a rosé and watermelon margarita blend and it cooled us down on a hot day. The vineyard’s wrap-around porch always has ample seating. Follow them on Instagram for event announcements before you plan your trip!\n\nKing Family Vineyards\n\n6550 Roseland Farm, Crozet, VA\n\nI’ve spent more than a few days and nights at King Family. It all started with a Saturday at a Polo match for a friend’s birthday years ago. I recently returned for a tasting with Lexus of Richmond. I got to watch the sunset here with my best friend and some of my peers. I was reminded of the gorgeous, rolling hills on property. I also discovered the vineyard’s cute little cans of “Crosé.” When I reached out for recommendations to visit the Charlottesville area again, King Family was offered up several times by my followers. You have spoken!\n\nThatch Winery\n\n1650 Harris Creek Road, Charlottesville, VA\n\nFormerly First Colony, this new winery is not new at all. It has a new name, new roof and a few new wines. I visited First Coloney years ago for a friend’s bachelorette party. Read the blog post here. I then wrote about Thatch Winery after its relaunch this year. A favorite characteristic of the vineyard is the layout. The large tasting building is nestled in the woods with a cozy downstairs with two bars for tasting and an even cozier upstairs for more tastings, relaxing, and private events. The large windows open up to views in almost every direction. It feels kind of like a fancy treehouse. If the weather suits, head out to the large back porch, also nestled in the woods.\n\nUpper Shirley Vineyards\n\nI’ve long awaited a winery to come a little closer to Richmond. When Upper Shirley announced its opening, I made a point to make it out there. The winery overlooks the James River. You can enjoy wine inside or outdoors on the sprawling patio and field. Bring a blanket and you can plop down in your own private area. I personally love the 2015 Zachariah.The food here is divine. Specifically, the brussels sprouts are a MUST. I finally biked out here with my Dad from downtown Richmond on the Capital Trail. It was a big ride for me at 22 miles, and the wine, snacks, and music were the perfect reward!\n\nPippin Hill Farm & Vineyards\n\n5022 Plank Rd, North Garden, VA 22959\n\nI have to thank my friend Amy for introducing me to Pippin Hill. She visits the winery every year for her birthday and orders cupcakes along with her favorite wines. I’ve been back several times for a variety of reasons. Nothing quite calms and lights up my southern soul like seeing the walkway that leads to the tasting room lined with white and blue hydrangeas. Not only does this spot boast one of the most epic, untouched views of the Blue Ridge, but the food program here is also worth the drive. I’ve been wanting to sign up for a cooking class.\n\nDelaplane Cellars\n\n2187 Winchester Road, Delaplane, VA 20144\n\nWhat a lovely experience we had at Delaplane! Set on Lost Mountain and overlooking Crooked Run Valley, the tasting room has views on views. Grab a picnic table outside, a window seat indoors, or an Igloo on the terrace set up for cooler days. We started with an initial tasting of four signature wines and our server set us each up with more tastings based on our preferences. The elevated charcuterie spread was well done with a delicious honey lavender goat cheese, spicy plum jam, warm bread, and more. The staff was all so helpful and sweet. I’d love to return with a girl gang or repeat the romantic date day with my man.\n\nWhite Oak Lavender Farm Purple WOLF Vineyard\n\n2644 Cross Keys Road, Harrisonburg, VA 22801\n\nIf you’re looking for a bit of calm paired with creativity, you have to visit the truly special Virginia winery. Located on White Oak Lavender Farm, the Purple WOLF. The vineyard carries several wines infused with lavender grown right there in front of you. You can also enjoy wine slushies, ice cream, and other seasonal specialties. Make sure to save time to explore the Lavender Shop full of anything and everything lavender. You can also enjoy the Discovery Area for a small fee. Here, you can walk through interactive gardens, say hi to some farm animals, play a life-size checkerboard, get lost in the labyrinth, visit the distillery and drying barns, and relax at the beautiful pond. There are a few secret picnic tables that are offered on a first-come basis in this area! See more of my Harrisonburg favorites.\n\nMerrie Mill Farm & Vineyard\n\n594 Merrie Mill Farm, Keswick, VA 22947\n\nThis Charlottesville area winery has become a go-to spot for meeting up with my friends from the area. The stunning two-story tasting room is loaded with whimsical and eclectic decor that makes you feel like you’ve escaped reality into an elevated mad hatter’s tea party. The patio downstairs opens to a sprawling lawn dotted with umbrellas, tables and chairs that overlook the vineyard. Lawn games and open fields make it perfect for young children to join in on the fun. As for the wine, I now order up a bottle of the Rose every time I walk in. I’ve tried the full list, but this remains highly drinkable for those long sunny afternoons.\n\nCelebrate Virginia Wine\n\nI have so much love for Virginia wine. This hardly represents it all. I get a lot of questions, so please don’t be shy. If I haven’t been to the winery you have in mind, then I know someone who has. I’d love to offer you any advice you need!
