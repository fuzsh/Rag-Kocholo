"Great hotel. Stay here.2023-12-04"

"Nice-looking hotel. The room was clean enough, though it did have an odor. I had a pet-friendly room so my small dog could stay with me. My only complaint was that he got into something under the bed, and I wasn't able to see what it was. The front desk clerks were nice, especially the cheerful morning clerk.2016-11-06"

"Large room with nice bedding, though the mattress was too soft for me. Nice towels, and we got plenty of them.Had in-room coffee, but no creamer or sweetener. Pets were only permitted on the 3rd floor, which was inconvenient. Hotel only had one luggage cart. No breakfast provided, and there weren't many restaurants in the area. Don't recommend.2015-05-03"

"This hotel is a good place to stay. The room was clean and quiet, and the bed was comfortable.2022-07-10"

"Not worth the price. The hotel was undergoing major renovations during our stay. It was messy, and the room was damp and smelled horrible. It was raining, and there was slippery plastic on the floors throughout to protect the carpet. The AC barely worked. The temporary breakfast area was chaotic. Don't stay here until renovations are complete.2019-08-19"

"The motel only had smoking rooms available when I arrived. The room was smoky, so I didn't stay.2023-03-27"

"The area around the hotel seemed safe. There were gaps around the room door that let in sunlight in the morning. The beds were clean. There was lettuce in the microwave, and the dresser was small and had missing handles. There was hair in the bathtub. Check-in was easy. Adequate parking and good exterior lighting. I wouldn't recommend staying here more than one night.2019-09-23"

Hotel Booking Tips

Beware of non-refundable reservations that could cost you a lot of money if you change or cancel them. +Non-refundable reservations are a gamble that will usually save you less than $10. If you make a $90 non-refundable reservation instead of a $100 refundable booking, you are betting $90 to win $10. Would you do that in Las Vegas? -

Don't assume you can cancel a non-refundable reservation without penalty if you notify the hotel weeks or even months in advance. +Often you cannot  because some hotels' profit strategy is to get paid more than once for the same room for the same night. -

Always read cancellation policies carefully before you make a reservation. + When is the latest date and time you can cancel without penalty? -

More >

When you make a reservation, you will receive a confirmation email. Take a copy with you to the hotel.

The earlier in the afternoon you check into a hotel, the more likely you will get a room or suite that matches your preferences.
