Historic Shirley

Nine Generations of Captivity

In 1613 Lord Thomas West received a 4,000-acre grant of land from the King of England to establish a settlement on the upper James River. The land on the north side of the river was settled in 1615 creating the earliest English-speaking settlement in what we know today as Charles City County. The settlement was named West and Sherley Hundred after West’s own family and that of his wife Lady Cessalye Shirley. A Roll of the Living made in 1623 counted 45 men, women and children alive at West and Shirley Hundred. The Roll of the Dead made at the same time, counted 11 dead, including two Indians, living within the settlement and one “negar,” likely a captive African arriving in 1619 on the White Lion or the Treasurer. Thus, Shirley is one of the earliest sites of the county’s African American history. Johannes Vingboons, “Caert Vande Riuier Powhatan Geleg in Niew Nederlandt” (Ca. 1639).

About 40 years after this first settlement Edward Hill purchased land in Shirley Hundred that would become Historic Shirley. Twelve generations of Edward Hill’s descendants have lived at Shirley, while from 1656 to 1864 at least nine generations of enslaved laborers lived there too. Shirley welcomes all visitors, especially those who descend from its remarkable enslaved community. Historic Shirley is open for house and grounds tours daily, on a seasonal basis, and at no charge to members of Shirley’s enslaved descendant community. Shirley encourages descendants to connect with its enslaved descendant community group.

Nine Generations of Captivity

Following his initial purchase of land Edward Hill was granted 2,060 acres in Shirley Hundred in 1660. At the same time, he claimed headrights – benefits attached to bringing settlers to Virginia — for the importation of two family members, 14 indentured servants (including two already dead), and three “negroes” named Joseph, Richard and John. In so doing, Edward Hill I established one of America’s oldest enslaved communities. Shirley’s workforce remained a mix of indentured Europeans, enslaved Africans and a few Indians until the death of Edward Hill III in 1726, by which time the work force had become mostly, if not entirely, enslaved Africans, and their often-mixed-race children enslaved at birth. While the Hill and Carter families up to the time of the Civil War benefited from nine generations of enslavement, Shirley’s enslaved families survived nine generations of captivity.

This enslaver-enslaved relationship is depicted in an historically valuable portrait that hangs in Shirley. Recent scholarship has established that the allegorical style painting depicts a juvenile Edward Hill III, and was painted in England in the 1680s when he is thought to have been attending school. The child points to a mansion in the distance and figure standing between the child and the house. The figure—so darkened by time that it is difficult to see—is an African groom also in allegorical Roman costume, holding the reigns of a horse. It is the earliest known example of an African groom in colonial portraiture, and a possible figurative representation of Joseph, Richard or John, or their progeny.

Stolen From African Shores

A decade after Edward Hill I established Historic Shirley and passed it to Edward Hill II, the Royal African Trading Company was established in 1672 and given a monopoly over trade between Africa and the Colonies, including the importation of captive Africans. Only a small number of Africans were imported until the last two decades of the 1600s when the Black population of Virginia rose from 3,000 to 16,390. By 1720 the total was 26,559. According to one historian, a small number of Virginia gentry, men like Edward Hill II located in the section of Virginia where sweet-smelling tobacco was grown, were able to use their relations with British tobacco merchants to contract directly for the purchase and importation of Africans during those last twenty years. Thus, they were able to move to an all-enslaved workforce before Virginia planters with less wealth and influence were able to do the same. John C.

Edward Hill III was at the center of the trade in captive Africans as one of only seven Virginians selected by the Royal African Trading Company to be its agents. The men who served were not just owners of large estates, but they also were knowledgeable of Virginia’s affairs, held political favor in the colony, and maintained close business and family ties with England. Hill was appointed in 1701 as the agent for the Upper James. His appointment came after the Trading Company had lost its monopoly, but the roll of agent was still a powerful and lucrative one. The agent earned a commission by arranging for the sale of all company captives, extended credit by granting Bills of Exchange to would-be buyers and collecting from creditors. In addition, the agent monitored all traffic by separate traders who paid tariffs to the Trading Company to support maintenance of the company’s African facilities. Hill was complimented by the company for diligently reporting on the arrivals of ships and the duties they paid. Charles L.

Most Africans brought to the colonies came from the West Coast of Africa from Senegal in the north to Angola in the south. The Royal African Company built several forts—termed “factories”—where captives purchased from African traders were held for shipment. Fort James on the Gambia River was the source of the Senegambians, the most numerous imports in the late 17th century. Robert “King” Carter, the wealthiest man in the colony and enslaver of more than 700 souls, spoke highly of “Gambians” because he thought them “more used to work” than other Africans and he was prepared to pay two pounds more per head for them than for “bites,” meaning captives from Bight of Biafra and Bight of Benin.

While Virginia planters may have had preferences for Africans from certain regions, their choice was dictated by supply. During the 1700s, a majority came from the Bight of Biafra and Bight of Benin. The International Slave trade data base presently lists 72 voyages known to have disembarked on the Upper James River during the 1700s. African origins are listed for 38 of those vessels. Of the 38, 20 carried “bites,” 10 carried “Gambians,” and 4 carried Angolans. Transport des negres dans les colonies courtesy www.slaveryimages.org.

During the time period when Africans were being imported to Virginia in large numbers, John Carter married Elizabeth Hill, daughter of Edward Hill III, in 1723. He was Secretary of the Colony and eldest son of Robert ‘King” Carter. When Edward Hill III died three years later Elizabeth inherited Shirley, making their combined wealth even more substantial. The enslaved individuals on Carter plantations, however, were “entailed”—meaning tied to the land. As a result, Shirley’s enslaved community was one primarily created by the Hills, rather than the Carters. John Carter and Elizabeth Hill portraits courtesy Historic Shirley.

Like Edward Hill III, John Carter was involved in the trade in captive Africans. He acted as agent for two British traders, meeting the vessels on arrival, advertising the sale, and collecting the proceeds for which he received a commission. Surviving letters document the sale of captives from at least two vessels at Shirley in 1738 and 1739. One of those vessels carried Senegambians who sold well. The other carried Angolans who were in such dreadful condition a number died on arrival or shortly thereafter. Carter did not purchase captives from either vessel for his own account. However, Carter likely was purchasing slaves from other traders because he brought 12 children into court in April 1738 to have their ages determined for purposes of taxation. The group included one girl and eleven boys between the ages of two and ten (Sally, Dick, Tom, John, Sam, Oliver, Dawber, Frederick, Newman, Primus, Walker and Banger).

A 2004 archeological investigation in the north yard at Shirley of an earthen cellar, later used as a fill pit, produced many artifacts dated between 1670 and 1720. The artifacts provide precious traces of Shirley’s earliest Africans. One collection of artifacts pictured on the left is a possible spiritual cache. This unusual collection of artifacts was found concentrated near the southeast corner of the pit at the floor level. The collection included a chunk of intentionally fractured crystalline quartz, a flake of European flint distinctly pointed at one end, the bones of a raptor, possibly a red-tailed hawk, and large pig canines. Spiritual caches reflected African religious beliefs that were a part of the Kongo culture of Central Africa. The contents provide a glimpse into beliefs about spirit power, transcendent connections, and the importance of protection in a fearful and uncertain world. The cowrie shell pictured on the right has been pierced on the back, indicating it was worn by its owner. Cowrie shells had several uses in African cultures and were brought to Virginia by captives either from Africa or from the Caribbean. The artifacts are on display in the Shirley kitchen.

A Lineage Preserved in Names

During the 1600s Virginia planters had no customary practices regarding the naming of imported Africans. By the 1700s, however, it became customary to rename Africans with English names. Robert “King” Carter directed that each new arrival be given an English name and the name be repeated over and over until the captive responded to the name. While the act of renaming was designed to erase an African identity, it was used by the enslaved themselves to create a family lineage. English forenames passed on by enslaved women to their own children documented their parentage. While the surnames mothers gave to their children preserved a family lineage for generations to come. Several decades after the Civil War, Mary Patterson, who had been enslaved on a plantation adjoining Shirley, testified in a Civil War pension application stating that “[i]t was the custom that all the enslaved persons were called after their master, although they often called themselves after what they believed to be their true family names.” Music and Dance in Beaufort County, attributed to John Rose, Beaufort County, South Carolina, circa1785, watercolor on laid paper, 1935.301.3, image #Tl 995-001.

In addition to the three Africans imported by Edward Hill I, Edward Hill II claimed headrights for the importation of seven Africans in 1694 and three more in 1696. Two years later the Royal African Trading Company lost its monopoly on the African slave trade and independent British traders jumped into the trade, significantly increasing the number of vessels reaching Virginia. As noted above, the Africans they imported in large numbers were women and children. In 1696 Hill also claimed headrights for the importation of 98 English men and women. Of the 98 white servants only 17 were female. Living and working side by side, the English men and African women, formed unions which produced mixed race offspring. Because the status of the mother determined the status of the child, the children were born into hereditary enslavement. Sidney E. King painting from a postcard.

A striking pattern emerges when the 1696 list of immigrants is compared to the 1806 inventory of those enslaved on the Hill plantations inherited by Charles Carter, son of John Carter and Elizabeth Hill. Many of the enslaved were listed without their surnames, however, among the surnames that are listed there are five “matches” with the 1696 list. The logical conclusion is that these matches reflect an English indentured ancestor. The matches include Jo: Barber and John Barber (at Harden’s), Wm Rogers and Charles Rogers (at Shirley), Wm. Cooper and Betty Cooper (North Wales), John Green and Lucy Green (at South Wales), Tho. Bottomly and Harry Bottom (at Shirley). The sixth match is missing from the inventory because he was the condemned slave Jack Fells from North Wales (described in the next section) and the Henry Fells on the 1696 list. Another surname may date to earlier indentured servants. Tho. Moore was among the servants imported in 1660. Another Thomas Moore was imported in 1663, and two more Thomas Moores (possibly the same man claimed twice) were listed as headrights in 1711. The 1806 inventory includes a Tom Moore at Shirley and a John Moore at North Wales. Cultivating Tobacco, Virginia, 1798 courtesy www.slaveryimages.org.

Other surnames emerge from Charles Carter’s 1783 Personal Property Tax list—Hall, Gill, Scott, Bates, Parrish, Russell, Tin, Tucker, Burwell, and Griffin, many of them names shared by Charles City families who likely descended from indentured servants. Several of the surnames may have come from overseers. John Bates was Edward Hill III’s overseer at the time of his death and Thomas Hall was Charles Carter’s overseer listed in this tax list.

Forenames passed down among Shirley enslaved hint at other family histories. Three African names appear in the 1782 personal property tax list. Cuffee—meaning “born on a Friday,” and Mingo—meaning “Chief”—are common names for Senegambians and suggest ancestors imported from Gambia. Congo is a name of geographic origin appearing at Shirley as a Surname. Philander and Bibbianna are archaic English names of Greek origin that were passed down at Shirley until the Civil War. The most common male forename in the 1783 tax list, Tom, of which there are 8, suggests a connection to the “negro Tom” whose ownership by purchase Edward Hill II proved in court in 1695. The family lineages Shirley’s enslaved community sought to preserve by calling themselves by “what they believed to be their true family names” deserve—and await—scholarly examination.

One additional confirmation that surnames utilized by Shirley’s enslaved community originated with white indentured servants is provided by this curious writing which appears at the back of a manuscript known as the Charles City Militia book. The book is a muster roll of troops enlisted at Charles City Courthouse 21 NOV 1776. The writing which is titled Roach explains that an English man named Roach (also spelled Roc in county records) indentured to Col. Edward Hill III cohabited with a free Black woman during the period of his servitude and had several children by her who took the name of their natural father. At the end of his servitude, he married an English woman named Royster, who likewise had been indentured to Col. Hill, and had children by her. What this manuscript fails to mention is that John Roach also appears to have had at least one child by a woman enslaved at Shirley. The evidence comes from Charles City Baptist Church records which show John Roc, who was enslaved at Shirley, enrolled as a member between 1791 and 1810, more than a century after the indentured John Roach labored there.

The only surviving Shirley Runaway Slave Advertisement from the 18th century conveys an image of the enslaved population consistent with this history. Nancy Lymus was a light-skinned, Virginia-born house servant who first escaped in 1775 and then escaped a second time in 1780 after she had been recaptured and sold to a second enslaver. She was dressed consistent with the status of one employed in the household. She was capable of evading recapture for some time by hiding among Charles City’s free Black community and then in the larger free Black community of Hampton. She was wed to an enslaved “fiddler” from New Kent County whom she likely met when he played for dances at Shirley or at the home of her second enslaver. And, she aided an African-born slave in his escape. In short, Nancy was probably a second or third generation Virginian using a surname who was skilled at navigating the disparate worlds of the immigrant enslaved and the free. The 1783 tax list includes six Nancys, and the total would have been seven had Nancy Lymus been counted. Virginia Gazette 28 JUL 1775; Virginia Gazette (Dixon & Nicholson), Richmond, 18 NOV 1780.

Robin Clark Walker is a member of the Shirley enslaved descendant community whose DNA results and family surnames reflect Shirley’s enslaved community history. Robin’s African ethnicity shows the predominance of captives from the Nigeria—Congo region that was the Bight of Biafra. A smaller percentage of her African ancestry comes from the Benin and Togo region that was the Bight of Benin. While the significant percentage of English and Irish ancestry reflects those indentured servants who labored beside and bore children with her captive African foremothers.

The names in Robin’s family also suggest a—yet to be fully understood—family lineage. Robin’s great grandmother Lucy Moore was born in 1862 at the outset of the Civil war. Her father was George Moore and her mother was Julia Howard Moore, a daughter of Tom and Bessie Howard. Robin’s 2nd great grandfather’s forename, George, is uncommon in the Shirley community and may reflect descent from one of the few enslaved individuals named in Charles Carter’s will. Carter gave his wife a life interest in his “Postillion George.” The Moore surname may have originated with the Thomas Moore who arrived in 1660, the man of the same name who arrived in 1663, or the two Thomas Moores who supposedly arrived in 1711 or it may come from Charles Carter’s second wife who was Anne Butler Moore.

A Long Memory for Insurrection

Communities enslaved for generations and tied by complex webs of kinship develop a community character and institutional memory. Historian Philip J. Schwarz has suggested that “long memory” may have connected some Virginia slave insurrections. Schwartz uses the example of individuals enslaved by Charles Carter at South Wales, his plantation on the Pamunkey River in Hanover County, where a spontaneous uprising took place in 1769 and the involvement of individuals enslaved by Carter at North Wales across the river in Caroline County in Gabriel’s planned insurrection in 1800. A spontaneous revolt took place around Christmas 1769 in Hanover. An informant to the Virginia Gazette reported that the enslaved had “long been treated with too much lenity and indulgence, were grown insolent and unruly.” A new overseer was brought in to regain control. When his young steward attempted to strike an enslaved man who had failed to do an assigned task, the enslaved man swung at him with an axe. Forty to 50 enslaved laborers fought white men armed with guns. The leader of the rebellion and some of his allies were killed on the spot. If the whites had not been armed with firearms, they would not have regained control. Philip J.

A Long Memory for Insurrection

Thirty years later in 1800, an enslaved man named Gabriel began plotting a wide-scale insurrection, recruiting men in Richmond, Petersburg and neighboring counties. Gabriel made a decision to recruit men for his planned insurrection along the Hanover- Caroline border where he knew few if any enslaved individuals, perhaps suspecting the presence of a revolutionary tradition among Carter’s enslaved people. He quickly recruited Jack Gabriel and it was agreed Gabriel would be Captain of the Caroline men and bring them to the rendezvous. Should he be unable to travel “he would send his men by John Fells,” a boatman, “who was to be a Colonel upon that occasion.” When the plan was uncovered four of Carter’s men were arrested and charged with conspiracy- One-eyed Ben, Jack Fells, Jack Gabriel and John a Boatman. John was acquitted, but the other three were condemned to death. To limit the cost of reimbursing enslavers, the Virginia General Assembly quickly passed a law allowing condemned slaves to be sold to traders who would convey them to places from whence they could not return to Virginia. The three Carter men were among those transported in lieu of hanging, and Carter was paid $934 for the men who were transported to New Orleans.

Jack Fells may have inherited a long memory from an English forefather as Henry Fells was charged in 1693 along with William Cater, another indentured servant and Lewis, an enslaved man, with carrying away and eating a hog from Hill’s Old Town plantation.

Spontaneous uprisings and planned insurrections were not confined to Charles Carter’s North Wales property. Shirley or Hardens saw its own uprising in 1792. “[S]everal negroes were discovered on a neck of land near the river, belonging to Col. Carter, stealing sheep.” An overseer armed himself and went in pursuit “entering a thicket of wood.” One of the enslaved men shot and killed the overseer. Neighbors sent for a “Negro hunter” from Chesterfield County and his dogs “who were famous for negro hunting.” The dogs found an encampment “filled with wheat and other plunder,” and captured several of the men, among them the man who had killed the overseer. The hunters then crossed the river, pursuing others and on the south side of the river, likely on Carter’s Old Town plantation. More than ten altogether were captured. The report of the uprising reveals the “alternative geographies” of enslaved people whose superior knowledge of the land, woods and waterways allowed them to create private places for meetings known as “hush harbors” or for butchering the enslavers’ livestock.

Robert Carter, son of Charles, was destined to inherit Shirley, but died before his father. Consequently, Shirley passed to Robert’s son Hill Carter, who was 10 at the time of his grandfather’s death in 1806. Robert had been a reluctant enslaver. He once wrote to his children, “[f]rom the earliest point in time when I could distinguish right from wrong, I conceived a great distaste for the slave trade and all its barbarous consequences.” Shirley was managed for a decade by uncles until Hill came of age and took over management in 1816.

When Hill Carter became Shirley’s manager many Tidewater planters were selling their farms and moving south because soils in the Tidewater had been depleted by tobacco and farms employing enslaved labor had become unprofitable. Other planters who remained in Virginia began selling enslaved workers from their farms to slave traders who conveyed them to the deep south. The rise of “King Cotton” created what historians call the “second middle passage,” during which approximately one million enslaved laborers were “stolen” from their parents, spouses, children and grandparents in the upper south and sold to labor on cotton plantations in the deep south.

Shirley’s precarious condition was evident even before Charles Carter’s death. In 1802 Carter Berkeley, whom Carter had placed in charge of his North and South Wales Plantations, argued forcefully against Carter’s request to send lambs to Shirley fearing that it might incite depredations by the North & South Wales enslaved laborers who “are apt to conclude from this, that your negroes every where else fare better than themselves & whenever they have an opportunity, they help themselves.” Berkeley observed that Carter might sell all of his laborers in Charles City and Henrico, and invest the proceeds to earn a greater profit than he was experiencing by keeping them.

Agricultural Reform and the Second Middle Passage

Upon taking the reins of his inheritance in 1816, young Hill Carter was determined to make reforms. He lobbied other planters to remain in the Tidewater, claiming “Virginia Negroes [constitute] a most desirable class,” and that “it only requires system and some little management to make them valuable as a class of laborers.” Slavery itself was not the problem in Carter’s view, it was the failure to employ good agricultural practices. Carter began his reforms, however, by selling 25 enslaved laborers in 1818 for $4,500 and 23 for the same amount in 1821, nearly half of the 106 he had inherited. While he sold them in family groups, that did not stop traders from separating husbands and wives and mothers and children. These sales likely accounted for the disappearance of certain surnames, like Cane (Cain) and Chern, from among Shirley’s enslaved families.

Carter believed that proper allotments of food, clothing and shelter were fundamental to maintaining a productive labor force, and so he used some of the proceeds from the sales to invest in clothing, blankets, shoes and improved medical care for those who remained. Food was distributed to family groups on a weekly basis and consisted of meat, corn meal and molasses. Rations provided only a portion of enslaved family diets. For the remainder Shirley’s enslaved families tended their own gardens and fruit trees, and raised chickens and occasionally hogs, as well. An archeological excavation of one of the cabins in the Great Quarter conducted in 1979-80 revealed that Shirley’s enslaved also consumed wild animals, most especially opossums which are nocturnal creatures that could be hunted at night.

As Carter greatly reduced the labor force at Shirley, he also reduced the amount of acreage under cultivation. However, his reforms increased the amount and difficulty of labor required, and its complexity as well. Carter experimented with a five-field system finally settling on a four-field rotation. His laborers reclaimed swamp land and spread marl and manures. They also learned new skills and assumed responsibility for laboring independently.

That freedom was a precious commodity as it may have allowed the men time to hunt, meet secretly with enslaved workers from other farms or with free persons of color, or simply the opportunity to converse without fear of being overheard.

Some of Shirley’s Africans brought spiritual practices with them from Africa, others may have been Muslims or Christians before they were enslaved, and some may have become converts to Christianity within a short time after their arrival in Virginia. The Rector of Westover Parish from 1721 to 1757, Rev. Peter Fontaine, was committed to providing religious instruction to the enslaved, a commitment that distinguished him from most Episcopal priests of the time. Rev. Fontaine reported to Commissary Blair in 1724 that he took “all opportunities both public and private to exhort masters and mistresses to instruct their slaves in the principles of Christianity at home and to send them to church to be examined and instructed by me during the time of the catechetical exercises which I begin in April and continue every Lord’s Day to the later end of June.” Whether or not Shirley enslaved were converted by Rev. Fontaine, by the time of the Revolutionary War evangelical Baptist and Methodist preachers were seeking converts among the county’s enslaved population. On Dec. 1, 1776 the Virginia Gazette published a Charles City Petition Concerning Dissenters signed by 260 residents which among its grievances contained the statement: “We have seen meetings in the night with our slaves without our consent to receive the instructions of these teachers, which we apprehend could produce nothing but deeds of darkness, and which have already produced their proper fruits of disobedience and insolence to masters, and glorying in what they are taught to believe to be persecution for conscience’ sake.” Virginia Gazette (Purdie), 06 DEC 1776.

Charles City Baptist Church, organized the same year (1776), was led by Rev. James Bradley, a white minister. The church’s membership included whites and free blacks, but most of the members were enslaved. Records of the church beginning when it was reconstituted 1791 list almost 50 members from Shirley Plantation who joined before 1810. A church meeting house was constructed near the intersection of Old Union and Barnetts Roads, and Shirley’s church members apparently were allowed to travel the 10½ miles to church on Sundays.

In an advertisement for six runaways in April 1829 (Joe Lyons, John Sampson, Wm. Sampson, Billy Tanner, Sam & Charles Smith) Hill Carter described the clothing of some as “old blue jackets, coats and pantaloons, white cotton or linen shirts, and other Sunday clothes, as they call them.” While most of the men were quickly apprehended, William Sampson still had not been apprehended nine months later when Carter offered a $100 reward for his return.

Agricultural Reform and the Second Middle Passage

The reforms that Carter instituted—and his enslaved laborers carried out—succeeded in making Shirley profitable again. Carter was widely regarded as one of the best farmers in the state. For their labor, Shirley’s captive workforce earned improved living conditions, but more importantly they saved themselves from the second middle passage. The enslaved community that Carter had reduced to 58 had grown to 139, more than doubling by the dawn of the Civil War. The wealth Shirley’s enslaved laborers had created in their children and grandchildren was not sold away from them. Staunton Spectator and General Advertiser, 14 SEP 1843.

After the Union took control of the lower peninsula and Union gun boats began forays into the James River, Siah Hulett, a 23-year-old carpenter, was the first to claim his freedom and the first known to have broken the chain of nine generations of servitude. He made his escape to freedom in dramatic fashion rowing out to the US Navy’s first ironclad the USS Monitor on May 18, 1862. Siah Hulett Carter photo detail courtesy Shirley Plantation.

According to a William F. Keeler, Paymaster for the Monitor, “the poor trembling contraband rowed a boat from the plantation’s river bank out to the anchored USS Monitor by cover of night.” Thinking the approaching boat could be a Confederate boarding party, Monitor crew members grabbed their small arms and lined the deck. One of them even shot a warning at the approaching vessel. “[He] cried, “O’ Lor’ Massa, oh don’t shoot, I’se a black man Massa, I’se a black man.” He told the crew that “his master was a colonel in the rebel army… & told [all his slaves] that if any of them went on board of the Yankee ships, the Yankees would carry them out to sea, tie a piece of iron about their necks & throw them overboard”. Siah Hulett was enlisted in the U.S. Navy as Siah Carter, a name given to him by the U.S. Navy. Wiliam F.

Shortly after his discharge from service Siah married Eliza Tarrow (Tarrer) another member of the Shirley community. The marriage was performed by Rev. Zachariah Evans, first pastor of the newly built First Baptist Church in Hampton. A number of Shirley family and acquaintances were in attendance, and later gave affidavits in Eliza’s Widow’s Pension application. Eliza is shown in this Freedmen’s Bureau Record as a dependent on a government farm near Fort Monroe. The couple lived in Bermuda Hundred, Chesterfield County, for five years while Siah worked as a carpenter before moving to Philadelphia, PA in 1870 and his new job as a longshoreman.

Throughout their married life, Siah used the surname Carter while his wife used the surname Hulett. When he could no longer work Siah applied for, and received a pension. He died April 12, 1892 at age 52. Eliza buried him as Siah Hulett. Then to receive a Widow’s Pension she had to prove that Siah Carter and Siah Hulett were the same man. A Bureau of Pensions examiner travelled to Charles City and interviewed a member of the Carter family who said that Siah was the first to “desert” them and one of their “most valuable slaves.” He was buried in Olive Cemetery in west Philadelphia. The cemetery was condemned and disinterred in 1923. The burials were reinterred at historic Eden Cemetery in Collingdale, PA. One hundred twenty-nine years after his passing, in 2021, Siah Hulett Carter received a government issued headstone through the efforts of Camp #124, New York Dept.

Siah was not the only member of the Shirley community to claim freedom aboard a US. Navy vessel. Acting on instructions to “threaten Richmond” eight Union gunboats—the USS Sangamon, Lehigh, Mahaska, Morse, Commodore Barney, Commodore Jones, Shokokon, and Seymour —ventured up the James River in mid-July 1863. On the 14th they captured Fort Powhatan across the James River from Charles City. On July 18th the Navy recorded the enlistment “in the James River and at Harrison’s Landing” of 20 men, including at least 10 from Shirley Plantation. One of the sailors would later refer to the men as “the 18 of July 18, 1863.” The men from Shirley whose Naval service has been documented are William Bates, Joseph Burrill, Edward Christian, Daniel Christian, John Christian, Martin Hewlett, Thomas J. Howard, John Morris, Phillip Pride, and Henry Washington.

Nine months later in May 1864, when Brig. Gen. Benjamin Butler moved his forces to Bermuda Hundred, several of the men returned to Shirley to help their wives and children claim the freedom that had been granted to them by the Emancipation Proclamation. A member of the Carter family penned a letter dated May 14th in which she wrote “[w]e are in great straits every day. Betsy Buck’s family and the girls who waited in the dining room, Phyllis daughter are missing today. We hear their husbands came ashore and took them off.” Julia Moore attested in Phoebe Ann Harris’s Widow’s Pension application that she knew William Harris had served on a gunboat because “I see him while he was in service when they all come in their uniforms.” Fanny Nelson Carter to Sister Lucy, May 8, 1864, reprinted in Charles City County Historical Society Newsletter, March 1995; William Harris, widow’s pension application 17389; Ships at City Point courtesy Library of Congress.

With Gen. Butler in residence across the river Shirley came under the watchful eyes of Union soldiers and experienced frequent visits from landing parties. As Hill Carter’s wife Mary lay dying of pneumonia in May 1864, her youngest son Beverly Randolph Carter, a sharpshooter on leave from the 12th Virginia Infantry, came secretly to Shirley to visit his mother. While he was asleep in the house Union officers came to search out rumors of a Confederate spy. Beverly’s sister-in-law, Louise Humphreys Carter hid his boots and pistols in her bed while Beverley climbed up to the attic and hid in the shadow of one of the massive chimneys where he escaped detection.

After the officers left Beverley quickly departed. On his departure, Lydia Buck Washington or “Old Liddy” as she was called by the Carter family, 6th great grandmother of Syncere Smith (pictured here), said to Beverly, “Mass Beverley you ought to love Miss Lou and do for her as long as you live, for she has saved your life from these Yankees.” Beverley commanded Lydia to “get right out or he would blow her brains out for she was at the bottom of the whole thing.” The next day a company of Union soldiers marched to the house and presented an order from Gen. Butler to arrest Hill Carter and everyone else, male and female, white and Black to be taken to headquarters to answer for harboring a rebel spy. Louise Humphreys Carter insisted that the white women would have to be taken in chains and told them the truth about Beverley’s visit, insisting that no information had been exchanged on any matter related to the war. The officers relented, but took Carter and others, including Lydia, to Bermuda Hundred for three days while they all were examined, and all reportedly gave the same testimony. According to Louise Humphreys Carter, Butler had put out the word that he would pay $20 in gold and more for information and Lydia thought she was going to get a “pile of money” for her courageous act of defiance.

Louise Humphries Carter recalled other events of May 1864. “Those were most trying days the soldiers all about and sitting in the servants houses, who could with difficulty be made to stay at their work and all with buttons pinned on their breasts with Butler’s picture pinned on them.” It is unclear from her recollection whether it was the soldiers or the enslaved who were wearing the buttons, and which buttons they were wearing. The well-known medal of the James River which Butler issued to U.S. Colored Troops depicted U.S.C.T. and not the Brig. General himself, and it was issued to honor the bravery of U.S.C.T. in the Battle of New Market Heights four months later in September 1864. If Shirley’s enslaved were wearing any sort of Union or Butler buttons that would have been an open act of defiance. Gen. Benjamin Butler was despised by the Carter women for many reasons, but especially because they felt insulted when he sent U.S. Colored Troops to guard the house.

In the May 8th, 1864 letter described in the last section, the writer further described the scene when an elderly dining room servant was taken away from Shirley. A small boat from one of ships in the river had landed at Shirley with a Union officer who said he had been ordered to take away any male servants who might know the river. Carter said that all had run away to the woods, but reluctantly called up 77-year-old Anthony Pride. The letter described him as “in the last stages of consumption though he is a most excellent dining room servant and a great loss to us.” According to the letter writer “Nat begged hard” not to go, and the officer “gave his word of honor” that he would be returned though he was not.

During the course of the war 70,000 enslaved men, women and children claimed freedom behind the Union lines. At the war’s end conditions in the Freedmen’s Bureau camps of the lower peninsula were horrific. To depopulate the peninsula the Bureau began returning freedmen to the counties where they previously had been enslaved. Anthony, his wife Sarah, daughter-in-law Betsy and grandson Nat, age 8 were shipped to Bermuda Hundred across the river from Shirley as shown in the first Freedmen’s Bureau record. In the second record a Bureau agent sought to get rations supplied to them from time to time because they were very aged and their son had consumption. The final record indicates their son had died and Mr. Carter would call for provisions at the storehouse when notified, suggesting that Anthony and Sarah had come back to Shirley where they would live out their final days.

Tidewater farmers faced an enormous labor shortage after the war and welcomed back freedmen who returned. Hill Carter was instrumental in obtaining agreement among local farmers to fix wages and expectations for farm laborers. Farmers agreed to pay the fixed wages and to refrain from employing any laborer who had been discharged elsewhere for misconduct. The $10.00 per month wage for a first-class field hand was higher than the state average for farm wages. Farmers also agreed on the amount of food to be supplied and the deductions that would be made from wages for fuel (wood) supplied during the winter months. Virginia Pilot, 11 JAN 1866.

These lists for January and March 1866 show the first laborers who were paid wages at Shirley, the sum of wages they were paid and the provisions they were supplied. All of the employees were Shirley freedmen with the exception of Napoleon Bates whose wife and children had been enslaved at Shirley. All of the laborers signed with an “X” to document their receipt of wages and rations. Looking at the list one might rightly ask, “What did freedom bring?” While not evident at first sight, freedom brought important changes both for the former enslavers and the former enslaved.

Robert Randolph Carter, Hill Carter’s second son pictured left, took over management of Shirley in 1866. During the war he had served as Captain of the Confederate blockade runner Coquette and as a member of the Confederate Secret Service. He applied for amnesty and was granted a pardon by President Andrew Johnson. Among the laborers employed at Shirley were five Union seamen (Ned Christian, John Christian, William Harris, Charles Lewis and Andrew Sampson), four of whom had served on vessels enforcing the blockade and chasing the runners. That these former enemy combatants managed to work side by side after the war is a testament both to necessity and reconciliation. Robert Carter shared the risks attendant to farm labor and died as a result of injuries sustained in a farming accident in 1888. His widowed daughter Alice Bransford took over management of Shirley which she ran until 1917 when she wrote in the Farm Journal that her cousin Charles Hill Carter, Sr. would be taking over the farm “I am down and out and can no longer do it…have had no cook and no housemaid for a year.” Robert Randolph Carter and Alice Bransford photos courtesy Historic Shirley.

Five years after the end of Reconstruction in 1876 Robert Carter calculated all of Shirley’s income and expenditures over the 10 years after the end of the Civil War, showing a net loss of $10,000. Farming itself was profitable in all but one year. It was the household expenses that produced the loss. The only reforms that could save Shirley a second time were increased mechanization and a reduced standard of living for the Hill-Carter family.

The most significant hallmark of freedom experienced by families who returned to live and work at Shirley was the right to vote which was extended to Black men by the 15th Amendment.

When they registered to vote or gave information to census takers a few Shirley families provided surnames different from the ones Hill Carter used to identify them in countless Shirley Plantation records. The family of Jim and Lydia Buck in Shirley records became James and Lydia Washington in public documents. Harry and Nancy Tin became Henry and Nancy Washington (shown here). Charles and Iris Buck became Charles and Iris Morris and Daniel and Charity Sampson became Daniel and Charity Christian. This is yet one more example of unexplored history in the names. One possible explanation is that Carter favored mothers’ surnames over fathers. Another possibility is that Carter simply did not know the surnames his enslaved families believed to be their true names. 1870 U.S. Census listing for Henry Washington in Charles City County, VA, Ancestry.

Freedom changed the role of women. Under Hill Carter’s agricultural reforms much of the farm labor, including many of the tedious tasks, were performed by women and children. When free to choose Shirley women left the fields—except for harvest times—and either became homemakers or worked as domestics. While no women worked as farm laborers at Shirley during Reconstruction, later in the 19th century four women were employed regularly, but they were the only ones. One of those women was Nancy Bates Carter, wife of William Claiborne Carter. Her mother, Phyllis Grassly Bates had worked in the house and her brothers William and Stephen had been dining room waiters, and so her choice reflected a reversal of family tradition.

Property ownership was another hallmark of freedom. Major Drewry, pictured left, bought Westover in 1862. He had no children by either of his wives, and that may be the reason that he and his second wife were willing to sell more than 50 small parcels of land to buyers, most of whom were freedmen. The parcels were carved out of properties known as Mill Quarter, Turkey Trot and Little Berkeley. Land ownership was something freedmen might not easily acquire if they moved north, and so it may have been the Drewrys who accounted for the significant number of formerly enslaved who remained in Charles City after the end of Reconstruction to work the fields of Shirley, Berkeley and Westover. Shirley families who purchased land included Julia Moore (20 acres 1893), James Washington (10 acres 1894), John Christian (10 acres 1895), Charity Christian (6 acres 1895), Jerry Jones & Lucy Christian (5 acres 1896), Mary Washington (12 acres 1897), Pompey Cox (6 acres 1898), Phoebe A. Harris (15 acres 1905), Richard Crump (5 acres 1899), Sam & Stephen Whirley (2¼ acres 1899 and 6 acres 1901). Their community came to be known as Kimages. By 1900 one-third of the property in Charles City was owned by persons of color. Pictured first “Major Drewry and Friends at Westover”.

Richard Crump was one of the freedmen who bought land from Maj. Drewry. He was born into slavery on Weyanoke Plantation, but married Lizzie Washington, a granddaughter of James and Lydia (Buck) Washington. In doing so, Richard joined the ranks of men like Charles Lewis and William Harris before him who seem to have been attracted to work at Shirley by the women they married. Richard and Lizzie lived in the quarters at Shirley where they raised 11 children, earning at the end of the century the same $10 a month that had been paid to laborers at the beginning of Reconstruction. They also received rations consisting of a peck and half of meal and blackstrap molasses. Their eldest child Henry, pictured here, was born 8 NOV 1889, and dropped out of school after the 3rd grade to work with his parents. Henry left the county to serve in WWI and moved to New Jersey after the war. In 1934 he returned to the county where he worked at Shirley and other places and served as a Deacon of New Vine Baptist until he died at the age of 103. Henry may have inherited his longevity from an enslaved man, called “Old Buck” who was born in 1749 and died in 1849 at the age of 100. Photo courtesy Byron Adkins.

One time the mule pulling the cart accidentally stepped off the wharf and fell pulling the cart into the James River. His father jumped in, trying to cut the traces to save the mule, but the mule pulled him under. Richard might have drowned if a fellow laborer hadn’t grabbed him by the collar and pulled him out.

Pompey Cox, Sr. was another freedman who bought land from Maj. Drewry and whose first wife was a woman from Shirley. He was born in Powhatan County, but began employment at Shirley in the 1880s. Mr. Cox provided an affidavit in support of the Widow’s application of Phoebe Ann Harris, describing how he and other men including William Harris worked in the fields at Shirley and neighboring farms. One local resident remembers Pompey’s son as the county’s first “engineer” because of his extraordinary ability to read the terrain of a field and to determine where ditches should be dug to ensure proper irrigation and drainage.

One of the most remarkably successful migrants was Stephen Bates, a dining room waiter, who left Shirley with McClellan’s Army in the summer of 1862, as documented by this Auditor’s Report. Stephen was a son of Phyllis Bates, who worked in the house, and Napoleon Bates, a carpenter enslaved on a neighboring farm.

Richmond photographer Huestis Cook captured an unnamed Shirley gardener near the turn of the century. The unsmiling photo was published in Shadows in Silver in 1954 with a caption that read, “When the photographer chanced upon this young gardener at Shirley, he was in his state of ‘seekin’ religion.’ He had pledged to live a sober and serious life and, as he explained to the cameraman, this meant that he was not permitted to smile or even look pleasant, He allowed that if he were to smile, he would be ‘turned back’ and would have to start his ‘seekin’ all over again.” Mrs. James Harrison Oliver of Shirley is credited in the Acknowledgments and undoubtedly was the source of the caption for the staged photograph. While the published photo and its caption are somewhat satirical, the handsome unnamed Shirley gardener pictured in both photographs speaks beyond the prejudices of the times and tells us two things. Shirley’s enslaved families bequeathed a heritage of devout Christian faith to their children, many of whom filled the pews at New Vine Baptist Church. They also taught them to “put on a face” as needed to get by. Heustis Cook photos courtesy Cook Collection, The Valentine; New Vine photo courtesy New Vine Baptist Church.
