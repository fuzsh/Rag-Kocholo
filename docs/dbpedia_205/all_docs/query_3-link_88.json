The American Society of Cinematographers has announced outstanding achievement award nominees in feature film, documentary and television categories ahead of the 37th annual ASC Awards ceremony on 5 March. Before that, France hosts its César Awards on 24 February. Of course, there wouldnât be any awards ceremonies without the studios that keep the industry ticking. We talk to the brains behind Shinfield Studios, an exciting development located just south of Reading, Berkshire. Our production features couldnât be in starker contrast: one goes behind the scenes with Pope Francis; another concerns the dramatisation of Alexander Litvinenkoâs tragic death. The third, House Red , had to feature real-life mob wives to get made!

FEBRUARY 2023\n\nTHE LAST OF US ON THE COVER.\n\nSPREAD THE NEWS HBOâs latest big-ticket Sunday night series depicts a fungal zombie apocalypse\n\nTHE LAST OF US Game changer ADAPTATIONS FINALLY CRACKED? M aking a video game adaptation for the big or small screen is always a risk, as many producers can attest. Even a heavyweight cast including when it debuted on Sunday 15 January. HBOâs adaptation of the hit Playstation game drew the channelâs second-biggest debut of the last 13 years â 4.7 million US viewers across the linear HBO channel and streamer HBO Max â behind only House of the Dragon . The drama, starring Pedro Pascal\n\nthe late Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo and Dennis Hopper couldnât save Super Mario Bros (1993) from being slated by critics and audiences alike. A similar fate awaited Mortal Kombat: Conquest when the fighting game franchise became a series. More recent examples of, shall we say, disappointing efforts include the science-fiction thriller Assassinâs Creed and Netflixâs Resident Evil . Although Sonic the Hedgehog went some way to reclaiming respectability for the video game adaptation, the eagerly awaited The Last of Us took things to a new level\n\nand Bella Ramsey and set in a zombie- ravaged US, was adapted by the gameâs creator Neil Druckmann and Chernobyl writer Craig Mazin. Itâs been described in some quarters as âthe best video game adaptation everâ, with five-star reviews aplenty. Sky Atlantic and Now are airing the series in the UK\n\n07. FEBRUARY 2023\n\nPRODUCTION. HOUSE RED\n\nThe Italian job\n\nA movie of its own could be made about the filming of House Red. This horror, set in a Tuscan vineyard, was hexed from the start\n\nWORDS. Robert Shepherd IMAGES. Candida Storey\n\n08. DEFINITIONMAGAZINE.COM\n\nHOUSE RED PRODUCTION.\n\nSEEING THE LIGHT The embattled production faced difficulties from all angles, from funding and equipment going missing to threats of Mafia retribution\n\nI f it wasnât for bad luck, the team behind recent horror film House Red wouldnât have had any luck at all. Initially, it was set to be a breeze. A beautiful Tuscan castello and vineyard; Tamer Hassan ( Layer Cake, The Business ), Clara Paget ( Fast & Furious 6 ) and Natasha Henstridge ( The Whole Nine Yards ); legendary DOP Douglas Milsome, with the late Darius Campbell Danesh as executive producer â the film, on the surface at least, couldnât have looked much better. But things started to take a turn for the worse when the truck carrying all the crewâs equipment got stuck in Switzerland â the result of poor decision making by the driver. The situation was compounded just four days into what was supposed to be a 20-day shoot (later cut down to 16), when a call from producer Camilla Storey to Hassan almost brought House Red down.\n\nâCamilla called and asked if I was sitting down,â recalls Hassan. âThat can mean good or bad news. She then told me that a key investor had pulled out.â The British actor had asked several friends and contacts to work on the film, so he desperately wanted to make sure he didnât let any of them down. Instead of panicking, Hassan was pragmatic. âThese things happen, people let you down all the time,â he rationalises. âThe problem was that we didnât have a backup. So, I called in some favours from actors and people in the industry I have known for years and handed Camilla my credit card. Something had to be done, because we had a hardcore landlady who had said: âIf you donât pay me, Iâm calling my Sardinian friends to come and sort you out!ââ Hassan invested £200k of his own money, and the figure was matched\n\nâWe had a hardcore landlady who had said: âIf you donât pay me, Iâm calling my Sardinian friends to come and sort you outââ\n\n09.

HOUSE RED\n\nHOLY TERROIR This slow-burning horror was filmed on location at a beautiful Tuscan vineyard and castello\n\nlike The Shining â a psychological film in which you donât know whatâs going on until right at the very end.â He settled on a vineyard in Seggiano â a Tuscan commune located about 100km south of Florence â as the setting for the movie. âMy family had been there for a summer holiday, so my dad told me I had to check it out because it would make the perfect setting for a creepy horror film,â Greenop says. âI couldnât afford to go, so I just looked it up and realised it would be a great place to shoot a\n\nby Storeyâs friend and property investor George Michael Georgiou. It was a far cry from Bitter Harvest , the Storey-produced film Hassan had just finished shooting with Terence Stamp. âThat was a £30m film,â he says. âWe had no runners on House Red , our line producer had to go on another job. I was delivering dialogue in character, then after a scene Iâd run off and clean the car for the next scene. It was a labour of love.â PICTURE PERFECT House Red centres on a couple going on a summer vacation to Italy to rekindle their relationship. They travel to a remote vineyard to spend the summer grape- picking, but soon discover there is more to the terroir than meets the eye, as their time descends to a hellish spiral. Director Coz Greenop says he got the idea for House Red from his previous film, Dark Beacon . âI knew one of the things that had going for it was its location [La Corbière Lighthouse in Jersey],â he says. âI then had this idea to film a Sweeney Todd-style film on a vineyard. I started writing it and researching all the wines from the region, while looking back at Hammer Horrors and other slow-burning films, rather than the shock to your face or jump scare type. I wanted something\n\nâI was delivering dialogue in character, then after a scene Iâd run off and clean the car for the next scene.

HOUSE RED\n\nchance meeting with one of Hollywoodâs finest living cinematographers. âWe were looking for DOPs at the time and I went to a screening of Bitter Harvest ,â explains Greenop. âI recognised the DOP as Douglas Milsome ( Full Metal Jacket , Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves ) â he worked on Stanley Kubrickâs films. I wanted to just walk over and sniff him or rub some Kubrick off him. Iâd had a few glasses of wine by this point and I told him he was a hero of mine. I asked if I could give him my script so he could give me some notes on it, because any feedback would be amazing.â The next thing he knew, Greenop had unwittingly â and via Storey â secured Milsomeâs services. âThe next morning, he called me asking when I was looking to shoot the film,â says Greenop. âI told him August or September and he said, âDebbie wants me out of the house so Iâll do it, as long as you have a glass of wine with me at every dinner.ââ AN OFFER THEY COULDNâT REFUSE Having scrabbled together the funds to finance the shoot, there was another major hurdle to clear. When filming began, Storey approached Greenop and Hassan after a visit from some locals. âOne morning, Camilla approached me and Tamer and told us the Mafia\n\nfilm. Whenever Iâm doing things like this, I always think about my passions. Iâm a massive oenophile, so it got me thinking about what I could do with the vineyard and wine that wasnât vampire-esque. Red wine has these eerie, old-school, theological connotations.â When youâre working with a tight budget, itâs ambitious to expect big names to join the party. However, Greenop had a\n\nâCamilla approached me and said the Mafia had shown up asking for â¬200k for us to shoot in this villageâ\n\nAS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT A chance encounter with Doug Milsome resulted in him working as director of photography\n\n12. DEFINITIONMAGAZINE.COM\n\nHOUSE RED PRODUCTION.\n\nhad shown up asking for â¬200k for us to shoot in this village,â Greenop says. âBeing a low-budget film, we of course didnât have that kind of money to pay them off, so I said we should just find another place to shoot. Then, two men in suits approached us and began staring at Tamer. Pointing at him, they asked: âYou are the playboy?â Tamer looked at me and then it clicked. They were referring to his iconic role in the movie The Business . Tamer replied, âYeah thatâs me.â All of a sudden the two men were all smiles and shook everyoneâs hands. âFilm as much as you want,â they said. We even put their wives in the movie.â TECH TALK With one of the industryâs most esteemed cinematographers on the team, Greenop expected Milsome to insist on shooting on 35mm. âFrom the start, I made it clear that we are very independent, with a budget of under £500,000, and that we certainly canât afford it,â insists the director. âHe said: âThatâs no problem, I get great deals at Provision and they all know me down there.â I sent him a lot of references and movies that I loved â old horrors, as\n\nTHE COOKE LOOK An Arri Alexa was selected for the film, along with a set of Cooke S4/i Prime lenses\n\n13. FEBRUARY 2023\n\nHOUSE RED PRODUCTION.\n\nwell as Korean and Japanese ones. I had many conversations with Doug on how we could achieve those shots with the limited resources we had.â Greenop and Milsome chose an Arri Alexa along with Cooke S4/i Prime lenses, which he says were more than ideal for the job at hand. âIâve never been a camera snob and it used to frustrate me when filmmakers would say we have to use certain lenses and this or that camera to shoot a movie,â he explains. âI certainly know from film school that some students will say they need a specific camera to tell the story. For me this is so ridiculous â if youâre a real storyteller, you can tell it on an iPhone. I shot my first film, Wandering Rose , on a Lumix GH2 stills camera. I had the firmware to up the bit rate and used a super-old Voigtlander World War II-era lens I acquired on eBay.â Every piece of kit used in House Red had to be shipped from the UK, which added to the delay. âWe were in the middle of Tuscany and the closest place for camera hire was Milan,â says Greenop. âWe had no cranes, no giant jibs. We had a Steadicam operator and what was then an 80-year-old Doug running around with a camera and a rig.â THE GREATEST FILM SCHOOL Greenop describes how working with the best people in the industry teaches a lot more than any formal education could. âGoing to film school is like getting a degree in finger painting â it doesnât help you become a filmmaker,â he says. âFor\n\nfor Full Metal Jacket.â That was just one of Milsomeâs several collaborations with the legendary Stanley Kubrick, first as camera operator for most of the seventies and eighties â and then cinematographer. âBut I told Doug that weâll be getting these aerial shots sitting by the pool, drinking a glass of wine. He likes to be behind the lens â watching on a monitor isnât really his thing.â\n\nme, working with Doug is the greatest film school. We were there with Tamer Hassan and Natasha Henstridge in this castle in Tuscany. Doug says, âSo what are we doing?â I said weâll set up here, do 50mm there etc. He asked why 50mm, as opposed to 25mm or 75mm? Immediately he was questioning me and my shot list. With Doug, every day it was about why I wanted to use certain lenses.â However, when the idea of drones was raised, Milsome was adamant. No. âHe asked, âWhy canât we have a helicopter?ââ recalls Greenop. ââI want to be up there shooting it.â He told us a story on day one about shooting in a helicopter\n\nSECURING ACCESS The crew had to tell the castelloâs management they were shooting a love film in order to get permission to use the property\n\nâDoug likes to be behind the lens â watching on a monitor isnât really his thingâ\n\nMASTER OF PAIRINGS Director Coz Greenop had his lens selection repeatedly quizzed by veteran DOP Doug Milsome\n\n15. FEBRUARY 2023\n\nPRODUCTION. HOUSE RED\n\nGRAPES OF WRATH The horror draws on the ecclesiastical associations of red wine\n\nBAD FOR BUSINESS Due to the fact House Red is a small film, Storey was in dialogue with many different agents as well as a large studio to secure backing. âThe studio wanted to make a TV show out of it,â she says. âJust as that was happening, the global pandemic started. We were messed around by several Hollywood big dogs and sales agents, which slowed the process down. At the start of 2022, we were approached by a distributor, but it all came to nothing. There are a lot of empty promises in this business.â However, Storey does single out Final Frame, a New York-based boutique post-production company, for special praise. âThe company is very supportive of independent filmmakers, was hugely supportive of us, this project and me as an independent producer,â she beams. While independent filmmaking will always introduce challenges, it also affords a lot more autonomy. Even then, Hassan explains he and the crew âdid tell a few white lies to the castelloâ in order to get the film over the line. âThey said, âWe donât want any horror films made here,â so I told them, âItâs not a horror film, itâs a love story,ââ recalls Hassan. âWe gave them a completely different script, which meant we had to shoot specific scenes really early in the âItâs why I always want to shoot on location â once youâre there, it doesnât matterâ\n\nmorning, before the management had woken up. This shoot couldnât have been more guerrilla.â As Greenop declares: âItâs all part and parcel of being an indie filmmaker. Roll with the punches and make the best film you can with nothing. âItâs why I always want to shoot on location â once youâre there, it doesnât matter. Tuscany is such a beautiful place, youâre just happy to be there. I was happy to be trapped on a vineyard, drinking red wine at lunch. If I was shooting in Croydon, Iâd have taken the Tube home.â Storey is used to dealing with the trials and tribulations that come with independent filmmaking, but she doesnât recall ever being so indebted to the team both in front of and behind the camera before. âTamer and George rescued the film and my career with it,â she insists. âAnd I know that Darius was smiling down on us.â Watch House Red via Amazon Prime Video, Sky Store in the UK and Vudu in the US\n\nA FINE VINTAGE Milsome lent an immense degree of experience and esteem to the production\n\n16.

BRIEFINGS\n\nFrench film awards bans sex crime suspects The César Awards â Franceâs national film awards â has banned any nominee being investigated in connection with sex offences from this yearâs ceremony, âout of respect for possible victimsâ. Announced 2 January, the ban also impacts people who have been convicted of acts of violence. The César Academyâs decision does not preclude actors, directors or producers subject to the ban from being nominated for or receiving awards. However, they wonât be invited to the ceremony and no speech will be given on their behalf if they win a gong. This means French actor Sofiane Bennacer will be barred from the ceremony, due to be held on 24 February in Paris. The 25-year-old, who had been shortlisted in the best newcomer category for his role in Forever Young , was dropped from the list of nominees in November 2022. The same day, he took to Instagram to deny the accusations against him. In 2020, the César Awards ceremony was thrown into turmoil after French-Polish director Roman Polanski won top awards, prompting walkouts from actors and protests outside the Salle Pleyel. Polanskiâs film, An Officer and a Spy , won awards for best director, best costume and best adapted screenplay â controversial choices for the French film industry in the #MeToo era. Polanski, who did not attend the ceremony, pleaded guilty in the US to the statutory rape of Samantha Geimer when she was 13 years old in 1977. He fled the country before sentencing and has been a fugitive ever since.\n\nECOFLIX APPOINTS MIA AS CIO\n\nEcological streaming platform Ecoflix has named industry veteran Ray Mia as its chief innovation officer.

FEBRUARY 2023\n\nADVERTISEMENT FEATURE. MPB\n\nItâs always tempting to buy the latest, shiniest kit, but newer does not necessarily mean better. Matt Barker, CEO of MPB, explains why RING OUT THE NEW, BRING IN THE USED\n\nTHE FILM AND TV industry is acutely aware that the delivery and general availability of some brand-new camera models has been seriously affected by ongoing issues with the global supply chain. As frustrating as this is for all concerned, itâs certainly led to more people buying more used cameras and lenses instead. However, while youâd be forgiven for thinking that the problems emanating from the South China Sea were the sole driver for acquiring pre-loved kit, Matt Barker â CEO and founder of MPB, the largest global platform for buying, selling and trading used photography and videography kit â says consumersâ eyes have simply opened to what was already a growing trend. âWeâre proud to champion circularity,â he says. âA circular business model will always\n\nbe more sustainable than a linear model of manufacture, consumption and waste.â SUSTAINABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY When a camera operator â be that a videographer or photographer â is building their set-up, budget may well be the first consideration. Often, theyâre able to afford a better camera or add a few more lenses, which improves the overall set-up while staying within an original budget. For those that canât â or who decide against spending beyond what they can afford â Barker says itâs important to remember the durability of modern kit. âCamera equipment, in particular, is built to last for many years,â he explains. âIncreasing numbers of people are realising that buying and selling used just makes sense. If properly checked, used camera kit offers the same performance as brand new â just at a fraction of the price.â It isnât just about cost; sustainability is increasingly important to users. Buying, selling and trading used equipment is an easy way for photographers and videographers to make a greener choice â with MPB making that choice even easier, says Barker. âOur business model is 100% circular,â he adds. âToday, more than half of the electricity we use is renewable, and we aim to reach 100% by 2025. Weâre targeting net zero carbon for our buildings by 2025, for our data centres by 2030 and for our courier services by 2035.â However, Barker says sustainability isnât just about circularity. MPB takes inclusivity and diversity seriously, by supporting the training and development of its employees and promoting inclusive visual storytelling. âEthics and trust are equally important â we provide excellent customer experience\n\nand accurate pricing, and we make sure our data security is robust,â he says. âItâs important to be transparent about our sustainability performance, which is why weâre publishing all of our sustainability data at mpb.com/impact.â SAVINGS Interested consumers will want to see examples of potential savings. On average, used cameras and lenses from MPB cost a third less than new. âMany people also choose to trade in their existing set-ups, which helps reduce the cost even further,â continues Barker. âSome trade in their existing DSLR lenses, for example, to fund the purchase of a mirrorless camera without having to spend a single penny. The process is simple and completely free of charge, as MPB covers the cost of fully insured collection and delivery.â While MPB might not be the only company in this space, itâs certainly the most competitively priced. Its team of experts make sure of that by monitoring the wider camera market. âThis is to make sure we offer accurate pricing for buyers\n\nTRUST THE PROS All items on the MPB website have been approved by product specialists\n\n24. DEFINITIONMAGAZINE.COM\n\nMPB ADVERTISEMENT FEATURE.\n\nâIf properly checked, used camera kit offers the same performance as brand new â just at a fraction of the priceâ\n\nexplains how the company gets plenty of positive feedback from the 400,000+ people using the platform. âMany say they prefer going with MPB instead of listing sites, for example, because weâre quicker, easier and more secure,â he continues. âTrust is also really important to us. Our award-winning support teams, based in Brighton, Brooklyn and Berlin, are available to ensure every user is happy with their experience at MPB. Our team of developers work hard to upgrade the platform, and we always welcome suggestions of ways we can improve the experience.â MPB is endeavouring to make it as quick and easy as possible for people to make the move from new to used.\n\nand sellers. Whether youâre buying used, trading in or selling to MPB, youâre always getting a fair priceâ, asserts Barker. Although MPB is not a marketplace, it does buy directly from visual storytellers, and its product specialists will evaluate all items before reselling them. Every single one gets approved, so you need never question the quality. âOur dynamic pricing engine is data driven, providing the right price upfront,â Barker explains. âThe value of kit is determined by its age, popularity, brand and condition.â\n\nFor even more peace of mind, thereâs zero risk involved. MPBâs specialists check, grade and verify every camera and lens to make sure theyâre all in good working order. âFor each individual item, we include photos taken from every angle â we donât use stock imagery â so you can see exactly what youâre getting,â says Barker. âOur five condition ratings make it easy to find the best-value camera for you, based on your cosmetic preferences. Then, your item will arrive in 100% plastic-free packaging.â Every used item also includes a free warranty, for extra peace of mind. BEST SELLERS Photographers tend to have a few lenses to fit a camera body, so optics often outsell bodies, according to Barker. âThe Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM is usually popular, itâs regularly one of the first lenses people buy when theyâre building a Canon DSLR set-up,â he adds. âBut as youâd expect, weâre seeing increasing popularity in mirrorless cameras and lenses.â Barker says itâs not just about the benefits offered by the MPB platform.

BSC EXPO\n\nPARKLIFE This yearâs expo will be hosted at Evolution London in Battersea Park\n\nBSC Expo returns to Battersea Park this month â and itâs going to be bigger than ever WORDS. Robert Shepherd IMAGES. Richard Blanshard Walk the floor T he British Society of Cinematographers Expo has established itself as a key fixture in the film industry calendar. Having\n\nstarted out on the sound stages of Elstree, the two-day show is now one of the most recognised events for the sector, drawing in a global audience. After moving to Pinewood Studios, then Warner Bros Studios Leavesden, then back to Pinewood in 2015, the event was a victim of its own success. Like anything that gains in popularity or harbours ambition, there came a point where it started to outgrow its surroundings. In 2016, the organisers decided to move the expo to its current home. âThe studios were always popular, as they produced a very close environment where professionals could gather,â explains Rob Saunders, director at event organiser SCS Exhibitions. âHowever, as the studiosâ schedules became busier, it became impossible to ensure that these\n\nindustry can meet and learn from some of the top cinematographers and masters of their professions.â For those unfamiliar with Evolution London, itâs a purpose-built events\n\nspaces would be available each year. Therefore, an equally unique location was found in Battersea at Evolution London,â explains Saunders. âItâs a place where students and those that are new to the\n\n26. DEFINITIONMAGAZINE.COM\n\nBSC EXPO INDUSTRY.\n\nMIX AND MINGLE As a huge industry get-together, BSC Expo is a key opportunity for networking\n\nKey exhibitors Exhibitors at the expo include: Arri Rental, Panavision, Aputure, Leitz, AC Entertainment Technologies, LCA, Zeiss, Kodak, Fujifilm, Canon, Red, Grip Factory Munich, Prolight Direct, Lightbridge, Power Gems, Sony, Cooke, Blackmagic Design and Cirro Lite. A full list of companies is available at bscexpo.com/exhibitors-2023 Like most in-person events, BSC Expo experienced a bit of a hiatus â there was no 2021 edition thanks to the pandemic. In fact, Saunders says the BSC Expo was the last major event within the sector to take place before the global lockdowns â and also the first to physically return post-lockdown. He explains that the industry is a very social- and network-orientated venue in the heart of Battersea Park. Easily accessible by rail and road, itâs a convenient location to bring every level of the industry together. What will be familiar is an audience made up of all parts of the production process â camera, lighting, grips, DIT and post-production, together with manufacturers and rental houses. âPost-pandemic, we had around 6000 people attend the event in 2022 (there were 8500 attendees pre-pandemic) and we expect an increase on this number â although itâs always difficult to predict,â maintains Saunders. âWhat we certainly anticipate this year is to see many of our international visitors return.â\n\nLISTEN AND LEARN An array of seminars and panels with industry leaders will be taking place throughout the event\n\nHANDS-ON EXPERIENCE The event is also a chance to get to grips with the very latest in cinema equipment\n\n27.

BSC EXPO\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION Demonstrations and exhibits from all areas of the production process will be on show\n\nEach year, BSC is blessed with exhibitors showcasing a wide range of products for visitors to try out and test. In this iteration, the event will introduce a larger selection of outdoor exhibits for the visitors to enjoy. âOur exhibitor list will once again represent an international array of manufacturers and suppliers,â says Saunders. âIn addition to these, we have the highly anticipated BSC panels and seminars, where we will be hosting some of the most internationally renowned cinematographers. Every stand will offer exciting opportunities for visitors.â Unlike many other expos, BSC doesnât have a specific theme each year. Instead, it prides itself as a celebration of all things cinematography, film and TV. âWe know that certain subjects will be represented through the products and seminar sessions, such as green energy, sustainability, virtual production as well as inclusion and diversity within the industry,â confirms Saunders. âItâs a technology event where the latest kit can be seen and tested, and itâs a creative event where â through panel discussions and presentations â the challenges that affect the industry are discussed â and solutions shared.â Whether you want to try out the newest tech, see some seminars or simply get networking, Evolution London is the place to be, from 24-25 February. BSC Expo 2023 pre-registration is available at bscexpo.com\n\nâThe panels and seminars will be hosting some of the most globally renowned cinematographersâ\n\none, and that the expo has always been very hands-on, offering the best of the best in equipment and services as well as the opportunity to meet associates, colleagues and peers in a social and relaxed environment. So, it works best as a physical rather than a hybrid event, unlike other shows which have transitioned to a fully hybrid setting.\n\nâThat said, there are certain elements â such as the BSC panel discussions â which will be broadcast online and through social media platforms, so that a wider audience can tune in and experience them,â he adds. âThe seminars and technical content are always really popular, so this helps to share knowledge from the speakers to a global audience.â\n\nBLEEDING EDGE Leading manufacturers, rental companies and service providers will be among the exhibitors\n\n28.

A specialist in professional cinematography and photography filters, it prides itself on all of its equipment being made and hand- finished in the UK. The companyâs forensic approach to the research and development of its filters was originally established by Reginald Morris â grandfather to the company founder â who for many years was chief physicist at Kodak. He helped develop whatâs now known as the Kodak Wratten standard. Now, in 2023, this remains the worldwide standard in technical colour correction â a benchmark in all Formatt-Hitech filter production to this day. âDOPs can come to us to test filters and even request unique effectsâ\n\nâWe follow this tradition in making the most advanced photographic and cinematic filters on the market, with an excellent reputation for colour reproduction and build quality,â explains David Lutwyche, chief marketing officer at Formatt-Hitech. Unlike many manufacturers, Formatt- Hitech involves the end user when it comes to research and design. âWe pride ourselves on working closely with industry partners, and often directly with cinematographers,â Lutwyche explains. âDOPs can come to Formatt-Hitech to test filters and even request unique effects.â This year, the company is looking to expand this service, with rental houses using the companyâs âspecial combination kitsâ â starting in Los Angeles and then eventually in the UK, too.

Although the company has a number of filters to its name, itâs perhaps best known for Firecrest ND â which is available in a variety of sizes and densities. This allows the user to match diffusion across a range of cameras without calibration. âFirecrest was the first bonded ND filter, so the coating is contained within the glass before undergoing extensive polishing, giving it unrivalled optical flatness and resolution,â Lutwyche says. âWe can also offer a service of filter matching for commercial clients, so you know that even if you have an accident, you can get a replacement which will match your previous filter exactly.â\n\nprojects, including Rogue One: A Star Wars Story , Solo: A Star Wars Story , Dune (for which cinematographer Greig Fraser won an Oscar), The Batman SPOILT FOR CHOICE The popular Firecrest Ultra Cine Superslim filters come in a range of densities for easy diffusion matching\n\nformatt-hitech.com\n\n33.
