The client, accused of…er, loving a rich older man to death, is played by Madonna, who doesn’t sing but does take on the femme fatale role with near-Method dedication, throwing herself into some athletic sex scenes with a no-less committed Dafoe. With Joe Mantegna, Anne Archer, Jürgen Prochnow, and Frank Langella."
