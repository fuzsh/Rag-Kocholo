        "text": "Policy Implication\n\nGovernments should use HIAs as a valuable tool that captures the potential impacts of the CPTPP and other trade agreements across the wider determinants of health, well-being and equity. These can be actioned at different stages of the negotiation and implementation process to inform and enable inclusive discussion and decision-making.\n\nSustainable procurement and legislation across the UK should not be undermined by free trade agreement provisions.\n\nContinued efforts to improve awareness and understanding of the ways trade policy and agreements can affect health and healthy public policies and legislation is needed. Public Health Institutes, agencies such as WHO, civil society and academia have a key role to play in this.\n\nFurther research into the issues identified as part of this work and the impact of trade agreements in general would improve understanding of the potential health and equity impacts and what action may be needed to mitigate risks and maximise opportunities. This includes capturing the longer-term impacts of trade agreements on health and well-being.\n\n1 TRADE, HEALTH, AND HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n\nTrade is a key commercial and social determinant of health and well-being (Gilmore et al., 2023; Green et al., 2020; World Health Organization, 2021a) and has implications for health and health equity (Department for International Trade, 2021; Green et al., 2021). It is also essential for the functioning of a healthy economy and society (The World Bank, 2021; World Economic Forum, 2016). In June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) voted to exit the European Union (EU) in a process known as ‘Brexit’, which is surrounded by political and social uncertainty (Green et al., 2020). This led to the United Kingdom having the ability to negotiate its own trade agreements for the first time in over 40 years.\n\nTrade agreements are not routinely assessed for their wider health impacts (McNamara et al., 2023). Wider determinants are social, economic and environmental factors which have an impact on people's health and well-being (Dahlgren & Whitehead, 1991). Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a practical process through which to assess potential and observed health impacts of plans and policies in all sectors (Birley, 2011; Green et al., 2020; Winkler et al., 2021). The national Public Health Institute for Wales (Public Health Wales) has a stream of work focused on health and trade post Brexit due to the importance of trade as a determinant of health (Green et al., 2020; Public Health Wales, 2022) and carried out a HIA on the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (CPTPP). In the United Kingdom, trade negotiation is a reserved matter and not within the powers of the devolved governments of Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland (House of Commons, 2022). Reserved powers can be described as ‘decisions that are made by the UK parliament and government’ (Centre on Constitutional Change, 2023). Reserved powers relate mainly to the UK's external affairs such as defence, foreign policy, the constitution, immigration, and many aspects of economic policy, for example, trade negotiations. Therefore, in these policy spaces, Wales and other devolved nations of the United Kingdom must represent their interests to the UK government including advocating for economic growth, investment and protecting public health and well-being. HIA can be a beneficial tool to raise awareness of the impact on devolved nations and inform their policy positions.\n\nThe HIA assessed the potential impacts on health, well-being and inequalities in Wales of the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (Box 1), the first major trade bloc agreement to be signed post UK withdrawal from the EU. This HIA is only the second ever carried out on a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) globally, with one previously carried out in Australia on the CPTPP's predecessor the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (Hirono et al., 2016). Analysis of the TPP to date has largely focused on Australia and New Zealand and has identified many health and well-being impacts. Evidence highlights potential negative impact on pharmaceuticals cost and access to medicines, intellectual property rights, policies including public health, environmental regulations and standards, healthcare services, diet, nutrition and alcohol (Correa, 2017; Friel et al., 2013; Gleeson et al., 2013, 2018; Gleeson & Labonté, 2020; Labonté et al., 2016a, 2016b; Pusceddu, 2018; Ruckert et al., 2015; Schram et al., 2018; Thow & Gleeson, 2017). Its provisions would have had an impact on a range of population groups such as those on low incomes, those with long-term conditions and equity (Gleeson et al., 2013; McNamara, 2015). The impact of FTAs or trade liberalisation more generally has been also been scrutinised and highlighted similar issues (Feng et al., 2021; McNamara, 2015; Missoni, 2013). These contributions have used various methodologies and their scope has ranged from a focused analysis on particular commodities (processed food and medicines) or aspects (biodiversity, patents and data protection) and certain countries or FTAs to analysis regrading free trade or globalisation effects for public health, the environment or sustainability more broadly. These take the form of peer-reviewed articles, viewpoints, reports or position papers of stakeholders (Cote, 2014; Hirono et al., 2016; McNamara & Labonté, 2019; Milsom et al., 2021; PETRA, 2022).\n\nBOX 1. The comprehensive and progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (CPTPP): key points for health and well-being\n\nThe CPTPP is a free trade agreement (FTA) between, now, 12 countries: Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile, New Zealand, Australia, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Japan and the United Kingdom (Institute for Government, 2023). It builds on its forerunner which is the TPP.\n\nPositively, the TPP provisions include commitments to social and wider determinants of health such as to recognise labour rights (elimination of child labour, forced labour and respect for minimum wages) (chapter 19 of the TPP), the environment including toxic chemicals, protection of the ozone layer and marine environment (ch. 20) and the participation of women in labour markets and business (ch. 23). Similarly, CPTPP provisions could have several potential positive economic impacts for some population groups in Wales through expanded market access and employment opportunities. Other potential positive impacts include an expanded health and social care workforce due to mobility provisions, increased collaborative working and international recruitment; and access to new medicines and treatments due to increased research and development.\n\nA range of potential negative impacts are more likely to be experienced among those in Wales on low incomes, suffering from long-term chronic conditions, or working in the agricultural sector. Potential negative impacts include poorer diet and nutrition through reduced food standards or lower tariffs on unhealthy food stuffs; challenges to enacting and implementing environmentally friendly and net zero policies as well as increased air pollution and packaging requirements for shipping; increased risk of alcohol and tobacco use; decreased access to healthcare services and medicines, and the increased cost of these. In addition, labour market disruptions, lower pricing and production costs in member states could lead to loss of employment and may have potential negative impacts on working conditions, both of which have impacts on health and well-being. All of these were also identified in relation to the TPP.\n\nOf particular concern for public health are the potential long-term policy impacts of the CPTPP's Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) procedures, which offer some of the strongest protections for investors. It allows an investor from one member country to legally challenge the government of another member country in which it has made an investment if it believes a new policy is unfair, discriminatory, is a form of expropriation, or negatively impacts on capital flow based on the provisions of the agreement (European Parliament, 2015). ISDS presents several potential risks to public health policy and practice. While the CPTPP states that members can introduce new regulations without the risk of legal challenge if they are ‘in the public interest’ (i.e., ‘legitimate public welfare objectives’), there is ambiguity over what constitutes ‘legitimate’ and who makes this decision. Therefore, this right to regulate may be contested such as Philip Morris vs. Uruguay or Australia or as Eli Lilly vs. Canada. In addition, while legal challenges are not always successful, they are expensive.\n\nThis a strong deterrent to governments considering new public health policies and can result in ‘regulatory chill’ (i.e., restraint of state to enact certain regulatory or public policy measures as a result of arbitration, or a fear thereof, thereby constraining the states' right to regulate) (Petchey & Cresswell, 2021; Shekhar, 2016). For example, Milsom et al (Milsom et al., 2021) have found a chilling effect for nutrition and alcohol policy in South Africa under WTO rules and Boru (Boru, 2021) showed that regulatory chill should be still a concern for countries that are party to the TPP regarding access to health technologies/medicines.\n\nCPTPP members can bilaterally exchange ‘side letters’ to form a special arrangement to derogate from some of their obligations, including ISDS (UK Trade Policy Observatory, 2021). For example, in 2018, New Zealand signed side letters to exclude them from compulsory ISDS with five members of the CPTPP (Green et al., 2023). The United Kingdom has agreed to side letters with Australia and New Zealand that exclude ISDS between them. However, ISDS can still be used by investors from many of the other member states to make claims against the UK Government (UK Parliament, 2024).\n\nPublished HIAs can make potential health and well-being impacts a matter of public debate, with the goal of increasing transparency and scrutiny of the trade negotiation process (McNamara et al., 2023). This HIA aimed to highlight to public health and trade policymakers and practitioners the likely effects of trade agreements such as the CPTPP to health and equity. Particularly, it aimed to better understand the potential impacts on the health and well-being of the people of Wales arising from the CPTPP to demonstrate how HIA as a process could be used in the negotiation, drafting and implementation of FTAs.\n\nThe purpose of this paper was to present the findings of the HIA on the CPTPP in Wales, to discuss and capture the learning from carrying it out and provide evidence and insight to a range of policy and decision-makers and researchers on the health and equity impacts of trade agreements. It discusses the benefits of using HIA and the challenges identified as part of the process. It provides transferable insights to scholars and policymakers in the realms of public health, economics, health services, and trade and suggests some ways HIA could be further be utilised by trade and health advocates and policymakers.\n\n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nHIA as practised in Wales is based on the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of health and well-being (Birley, 2011; World Health Organization, 2021b). It is a flexible and pragmatic process that considers potential impacts on the wider determinants of health, such as conditions in which we vote, work, live, grow and take leisure, as well as our health behaviours such as smoking or exercise (Dahlgren & Whitehead, 1991). HIA follows a systematic process and uses mixed methods to consider both the potential positive and the negative impacts across a range of determinants and population groups (Wales Health Impact Assessment Support Unit, 2012). The assessment includes appraising existing evidence, and engaging with stakeholders who could, or will be, impacted.\n\nBased on the Welsh HIA guidance, this HIA followed a standard five-step evidence-based HIA process to assess the likely impacts of the CPTPP on health, well-being and inequalities in Wales (Wales Health Impact Assessment Support Unit, 2012). The HIA process is evidence based and includes the following stages; screening, scoping, appraisal, reporting and recommendations, and review and reflection including monitoring and evaluation (Table 1). It is recommended as a key public health tool to support a consideration of ‘Health in All Policies’ (World Health Organization, 2010, 2021b). The HIA was comprehensive, participatory, and prospective in its nature. A Steering Group oversaw the work, which was completed over a six-month period in 2022–23. The Steering Group comprised public health specialists across health, health policy, the economy, HIA and an academic with expertise in both public health and trade policy.\n\nHIA step Action taken Steps 1 and 2: Screening and Scoping\n\nThe population and determinants of health likely to be affected by CPTTP were identified using HIA checklist\n\nEstablishment of the Steering Group\n\nScope of the HIA was defined, including methods, timeframes, stakeholders to be interviewed and resources\n\nStep 3: Appraisal\n\nLiterature review of peer-reviewed and grey literature undertaken\n\nQuantitative community health profile completed\n\nQualitative interviews with key stakeholders carried out\n\nEvidence assessed and characterised to identify the potential positive and negative impacts\n\nStep 4: Recommendations and Reporting\n\nThe HIA steering group agreed the recommendations\n\nThe final HIA report was published and disseminated to local, national and global networks\n\nA webinar was also held to disseminate findings\n\nStep 5: Monitoring and Evaluation, including Reflection and Review\n\nReview and reflection meeting held\n\nA review and evaluation of the HIA is planned\n\nFuture validation of findings\n\n2.1 Steps 1 and 2: Screening and scoping\n\nAs part of the screening process, checklists of populations and determinants were used (Wales Health Impact Assessment Support Unit, 2020a) in a participatory group exercise involving steering group members to identify the potential populations and priority heath determinants that could be affected by the CPTPP. Developed by the Wales Health Impact Assessment Support Unit (WHIASU), one checklist focuses on population groups, for example, older people and different professional groups. The other focuses on the wider determinants of health, for example, food, healthcare services and air quality (Wales Health Impact Assessment Support Unit, 2020a). The contents of the CPTPP were known at this time but there was still uncertainty about the final terms of the UK accession protocol being negotiated and so the impacts identified were potential anticipated impacts, as is common in prospective HIAs (Douglas et al., 2020; Green et al., 2020; Hirono et al., 2016).\n\nThe HIA roles and responsibilities and methods for evidence collection were scoped out using a Scoping Checklist (Wales Health Impact Assessment Support Unit, 2020b). This identified the aim and purpose of the HIA, resources and boundaries, who would carry out which tasks, the mixed methodology (interviews with key stakeholders, literature review and policy analysis) to be followed and the governance process.\n\n2.2 Step 3: Appraisal\n\nThe literature review aimed to identify evidence of the impact of the CPTPP on health and inequalities in the existing member countries and of potential impacts highlighted by stakeholders in existing and proposed member countries. We searched for evidence on the potential impact of the CPTPP on specific population groups, health determinants and inequalities as identified by the HIA team in the screening and scoping stages, in both the peer-reviewed literature and grey literature.\n\nThe search for peer-reviewed evidence was undertaken using MEDLINE, Embase, Proquest and Google Scholar using terms such as ‘NHS’, ‘healthcare workers’, ‘medicine’, ‘food standards’ and ‘mental health’. The inclusion criteria included international evidence on trade and the determinants of health, publication in English only, publication between January 2010 and June 2023. We also identified further literature by searching the reference lists of included papers, through the team's contacts and from a weekly trade policy tracker. The search engine Google was used to capture policy and grey literature, and other targeted searches were carried out on websites of key stakeholders and trade/health experts including Trade Justice Movement/Wales, Department for International Trade, UK and Welsh Government and Wales Trades Union Congress. All results were screened and reviewed for relevance by two independent members of the HIA team.\n\nBecause the scope of the HIA focused on the health, well-being and equity impacts of the CPTPP on populations in Wales, the peer-reviewed and grey literature search sought to identify evidence specifically on the UK's accession to the CPTPP in its current form. It was recognised that many of the CPTPP's provisions aligned with its precursor, the TPP and evidence assessing the potential impacts of the TPP were analysed and included in the HIA (Barlow et al., 2022; Correa, 2017; Green et al., 2023; Schram et al., 2018; Thow & Gleeson, 2017). Evidence from countries that were already members of the CPTPP and TPP was used to inform the Welsh HIA analysis, for example, Australia and New Zealand (Friel et al., 2013; Gleeson et al., 2015). However, these have different regulatory and health systems contexts, for example, the United Kingdom has the National Health Service while Australia and New Zealand have mixed public–private health insurance systems. This was taken into account when analysing the data and evidence on the impacts of the TPP on other members was incorporated into the HIA where broadly applicable in Wales.\n\nA community health profile was constructed using routine quantitative data sources such as the Office of National Statistics (Office for National Statistics, 2022), Welsh Government (Welsh Government, 2020) and the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (Stats Wales, 2020) to enable understanding of the relevant population groups. This included demographic statistics on population groups identified through the scoping, such as those with long-term conditions, those on low incomes, small business owners and local area deprivation statistics.\n\nAdditionally, semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 11) were carried out with key informants. Interviewees were purposively selected to represent different interests including trade policymakers, environmental and public health specialists, civil society groups and businesses from the public and private sector. In total, 15 individuals were approached. The interviews aimed to identify how key informants believed the CPTPP would affect health and well-being and the people of Wales, or the subject area they represented and how and what could be done to address this. All interviews were carried out virtually or via telephone. Respondents were asked a set of open-ended questions, providing the opportunity to probe on themes when necessary. All responses were transcribed and anonymised. The interviewees reviewed the transcripts to check they accurately reflected their views.\n\nThe qualitative and quantitative data and evidence identified were analysed and triangulated by members of the HIA team who had been responsible for collating the evidence. Peer-reviewed academic publications and official health intelligence data were weighted with a higher level of significance than other data sources. Findings were compared against the two checklists used at the scoping stage (Wales Health Impact Assessment Support Unit, 2020a), and each impact was characterised as positive or negative and by strength of evidence and affected populations. Sections from the report were sent to Public Health Wales internal topic leads, who are policy specialists in areas relating to the environment, food and obesity. These specialists provided feedback and additional evidence or information of note.\n\n2.3 Step 4. Recommendations and reporting\n\nThe Steering Group oversaw all the work, debated the findings from each of the sources and agreed the recommendations of the HIA. Findings were written up and compiled into a report and accompanying infographic (Green et al., 2023). These were both disseminated via a wide range of networks including globally, and throughout the United Kingdom and Wales (Health Impact Assessment: The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, n.d.) The report was subject to internal quality assurance processes including a HIA appraisal tool (Green et al., 2017) and sign off by the Public Health Wales Executive Team.\n\n2.4 Step 5. Monitoring and evaluation, including review and reflection\n\nFinally, a review and reflection session was held with the Steering Group 1 month after the final report was published. This involved discussing what worked well throughout the HIA process, what could be improved, challenges, whether the HIA process met its objectives and any impact reported to date.\n\nMonitoring of impacts is ongoing. The team will track the impacts of the CPTPP once it is implemented, to understand whether the predictions identified in the HIA are observed in future, using methods we have demonstrated in another study (Green et al., 2022).\n\n3 RESULTS\n\nThe evidence appraisal included a total of 43 peer-reviewed papers and 34 pieces of evidence from the grey literature, findings from the population profile and themes identified through the interviews. This total included several additional articles and additional sources that were not found through the literature review but through stakeholders and reference lists of included papers. This included policy documents and consultation responses from organisations such as National Farmers' Association in Wales and websites such as the Centre for Inclusive Trade Policy. An important document was also the Conclusions of the Negotiations document (UK Government, 2023) published at the reporting stage in March 2023.\n\nThe HIA identified significant potential impacts across multiple determinants of health, including economic and mental well-being impacts, and also identified vulnerable population groups, for example, those on low incomes and some Welsh sectors (Tables 2 and 3). Key themes identified from the interviews included concerns about the ability of Wales to introduce enhanced policies in the future due to ‘regulatory chill’ or legal action through ISDS. These concerns related, for example, to the regulation of unhealthy commodities such food products high in fat, sugar or salt. Other concerns related to impacts on agriculture and economic opportunities or constraints.\n\nDeterminants of health Potential impacts of CPTPP Potential positive impacts Potential negative impacts Economic determinants\n\nExpanded market access\n\nIncreased employment opportunities\n\n✓ Labour market disruption, lower pricing and production costs elsewhere leading to loss of employment and potential impacts on working conditions ✓ Health and social care determinants Increased collaborative working and International recruitment ✓\n\nIncreased cost of medicines and equipment\n\nLoss of NHS workforce to other CPTPP countries\n\n✓ Reduced governmental budgets and regulatory chill. ✓ Behavioural determinants Reduced ability to regulate unhealthy commodities, for example, food labelling and illicit trade of alcohol, tobacco and drugs\n\n✓\n\nSocial determinants Reduced data protection and privacy which could have an impact on mental well-being ✓ Environmental determinants\n\nAir pollution due to transport distances for goods and increased packaging requirements\n\nReduced ability to regulate for environmental protection\n\n✓ Macro-Economic Reduced governmental budgets and regulatory chill. ✓\n\nThe HIA team developed an impacts matrix to show the potential impacts, with the sources of evidence and potentially impacted populations for each. See, for example, Table 4 which shows the impact matrix for the food and safety standards area of impact. The full impact matrix for each area of impact is available in the published report (Green et al., 2023).\n\nThe HIA also identified key pathways to potential health impacts including: economic uncertainty, changing relationships, loss of regulatory alignment and the impact of ISDS on public health regulations.\n\nSome impacts were nuanced or could impact either positively or negatively. For example, evidence highlighted that the CPTPP could increase access to a variety of foods, but also increase imports of cheaper, more highly processed, and unhealthy foods. It was also found that the CPTPP may have positive economic benefits in certain sectors, while at the same time increasing economic insecurity in others. Evidence shows clearly that better health is linked to wealth and economic status – which employment and economic development can harness (Marmot et al., 2020; The Health Foundation, 2018, 2022) but commentators have been keen to stress that the economic impact of the CPTPP must not be overstated, and led to debate on the actual size of any benefits (Rogers, 2023; Schneider-Petsinger, 2023). Predicted benefits of the CPTPP are low and range from 0.04% to 0.08% of GDP after 15 years of membership (Centre for Policy Studies, 2022; International Agreements Committee, 2021; McNamara et al., 2023; Office for Budget Responsibility, 2023; Trade Justice Movement, 2021). Economic benefits are also likely to be smaller in Wales as it has the lowest proportion of exports destined for CPTPP countries (6.2%) when compared to England, Scotland and Northern Ireland (Centre for Policy Studies, 2022).Two important areas of uncertainty identified by the HIA include the question of how Investor State Dispute Settlements (ISDS; Practical Law UK, 2023) provisions could interact with public health policy; and the potential negotiation of side letters on specific areas or with specific CPTPP members. The ISDS mechanism may allow commercial actors to challenge government legislation and regulations deemed detrimental to their trade interests, even if these are designed to protect or improve health. The fear of expensive legal challenge could also inhibit devolved and UK governments from developing some health regulations (termed ‘regulatory chill’). This may have both immediate and long-term impacts on health, well-being and equity policy and outcomes. Current evidence for regulatory chill is sparse (Barlow et al., 2022; Barlow & Allen, 2023) owing in part to the difficulty in identifying when nothing has been legislated for when a country would like to do so. For example, Cote indicates that three may not be an effect from the threat of ISDS. However, there are papers which highlight the cost of ISDS and that these costs may be a deterrent to developing regulations (Practical Law UK, 2023; UNCTAD, n.d.).\n\nSide letters can be used to address key public health issues related to, for example, tobacco control, food labelling, infectious disease control cooperation or exemption from the ISDS mechanism. A clear example of this is the public health side letter agreed as part of the UK–Australia agreement concluded in 2021 (UK Government, n.d.) focused on the regulation of medical devices. The United Kingdom has agreed to a range of side letters (UK Government, 2023) with several member countries across different areas. Some are specific to the UK's accession to the CPTPP while others include the United Kingdom in pre-existing arrangements, which were originally agreed in the TPP and CPTPP. However, side letters have not been agreed to with all members of the CPTPP and many key areas that impact on public health are not included in side letters. In addition, the United Kingdom has only agreed to side letters around ISDS with Australia and New Zealand, leaving the mechanism in place with other member countries.\n\nThe HIA also identified potential actions to protect and promote population health, well-being and equity. Undertaking a HIA could enable policymakers to take action at different stages of the negotiation and implementation process and can be a scrutiny tool to increase accountability. This HIA suggested actions to improve the health and well-being impacts relating to: ISDS exemption; tobacco and alcohol labelling and control; food labelling and standards; infectious disease control cooperation; workers' protection and rights; cooperation agreements on the flow of health workforce professions; and action on the environment, climate and nature emergencies.\n\nThe HIA was published and has been well received (Green, 2023). It has been disseminated widely via PHW internal and external channels, social media and via policy sites targeting politicians and policymakers (Morning Trade UK, 2023). The work was presented at a number of events and conferences (American Public Health Association, 2023). We found the HIA process enabled public health policy leads to effectively engage policy-relevant stakeholders. For example, connections were made with other inclusive trade academics, Welsh Government departments including for EU Exit and trade policy and the UK Government department for Business and Trade. It also raised the importance of trade in relation to health to PHW internal specialists working on environment, obesity, food and fair work.\n\nThe Review and Reflection session identified that the HIA did meet its objectives in raising awareness of health and HIA and trade as noted above. It provides a tangible product in the form of a HIA report, a vehicle through which to discuss and advocate for public health, and a rationale to show why it is important for public health to be involved and treated as a key stakeholder. The team worked well together, and the different skills and knowledge and contexts allowed for a holistic assessment. However, the team also identified as limitations the lack of peer-reviewed impact studies and the uncertainty about the terms of the accession package being negotiated.\n\n4 DISCUSSION\n\nThis paper set out to explore the findings of the HIA along with the value of the approach in engaging with stakeholders and informing policymakers. Overall, this HIA has demonstrated that although the consideration of health within a trade agreement is challenging, it can be achieved.\n\nThe findings of the HIA of the CPTPP highlight a wide range of predominantly negative potential impacts on the Welsh population, which aligns with existing literature on the impact of trade policy on health and the CPTPP predecessor, the TPP, specifically (Correa, 2017; Gleeson & Labonté, 2020; Gleeson et al., 2015; Kelsey, 2013; Labonté et al., 2016a, 2016b; Milsom et al., 2021; Pusceddu, 2018; Ruckert et al., 2015; Thow & Gleeson, 2017). These include potential impacts on the environment, food and health behaviours, access to medicines and health services and economic security. The most affected population groups include people on low incomes, those working in the agricultural sector and healthcare sector and those with long-term health conditions. A smaller number of potential positive impacts were identified related to economic opportunities, including growth in some economic sectors. As noted, only one other HIA has been undertake of a trade agreement (Hirono et al., 2016). On comparison, while the two HIAs identified some similar impacts, there are also differences. Both HIAs identified impacts for the whole population and on people with chronic conditions. They also both highlighted potential negative impacts on the ability of governments to develop regulations that would limit consumption of unhealthy foods due to regulatory chill, and both identified the potential increased cost of medicines. However, the scope of the TPP HIA was restricted to determinants related to the cost of medicines, tobacco and alcohol control policies and food labelling. The current HIA also included a wider set of determinants. It identified some potential positive impacts, for example, economic development, growth and employment opportunities and a wider set of potential negative impacts, for example, worsening of global air pollution due to transport distances for goods, the potential for regulatory chill to affect environmental regulations, and impacts on mental well-being.\n\nThe work reinforced the importance of ISDS and side letters, as also highlighted in existing literature (Labonté et al., 2020; McNamara et al., 2023). The ISDS mechanism may enable new government policy to be legally challenged if it is seen as negatively impacting trade (Petchey & Cresswell, 2021). This can include, but is not limited to, new public health or net zero policies such as Minimum Unit Pricing or restrictions on marketing of high fat, high salt and sugar foods (Barlow et al., 2022; Labonté et al., 2020; McNamara, 2021). Side letters can be used to opt out of ISDS or to protect areas such as tobacco control (Buchanan, 2018).\n\nStrengths of this HIA include the systematic and structured process, clear governance including steering group oversight and tangible products in the form of the published HIA report (Green et al., 2023) and a follow on workshop (Public Health Network Cymru, 2023). The broad ranging literature, statistical and qualitative evidence was triangulated and debated by the whole steering group to form a holistic picture of impact. Finally, it engaged a wide range of stakeholders and provided an opportunity and platform to inform government departments and negotiators. Although the HIA team had no direct link into the UK Government decision-making process on the CPTPP, it was able to raise the findings through trade and health networks (PETRA, 2022), and stakeholder engagement. The paper was informally reviewed by the team who provided constructive feedback, for example, details on extension of patents.\n\nLimitations of the HIA include a lack of published empirical research on the health, social and community impacts of trade agreements. The grey literature was often speculative or ideologically based and sometimes presented ways to maintain the status quo as a positive, not just neutral, impact. At the time the HIA was completed in June 2023, the government's position and data informing this were not openly available. This HIA was restricted by lack of transparency during the negotiation and conclusion of trade agreements and the technical language and procedures involved. Neither the team nor contributors had sight of the UK accession protocol or negotiating positions until after signing. The HIA indicates a direction of travel of impact, that is, potential positive or negative but the evidence limitations precluded detailed categorisation of impact for most of the determinants assessed. The full implications of joining the agreement and its implementation will take time to emerge and may change under different governments.\n\nThe HIA highlighted priority areas where future research is needed and supports the urgent need for more research on the health and health equity impacts of trade policy and trade agreements (Hirono et al., 2016; Labonté et al., 2020; PETRA, 2022). This research could focus on the impacts identified here, as well as the impact of trade agreements in general, including longer-term impacts and impacts on specific at-risk populations. It should also evaluate ways to mitigate adverse effects and enhance positive effects of trade agreements. In addition, due to the high level of uncertainty around the potential impacts, it would be beneficial to monitor health impacts following implementation of CPTPP, to see if predicted impacts have occurred. This can be challenging but predictive accuracy of HIA has been evaluated in a previous study (Green et al., 2022).\n\nAlthough undertaken in a limited timeframe, the findings have been beneficial in informing policy and decision-makers of the importance of trade and trade agreements to health and well-being in Wales, the benefits of using an evidence-informed approach such as HIA, and to advocate for Welsh interests and public health (Box 2). The HIA has been welcomed by civil society, public health specialists and trade and health advocates not only in the United Kingdom but the European Union and Oceania and can provide a baseline for scrutinising the CPTPP and the health impacts which may arise from it. As discussions continue about opportunities to improve the scrutiny process for trade agreements, the CPTPP HIA has been highlighted as an example of how HIA can be used to inform this process and discussions (McNamara et al., 2023; Trade Justice Movement, 2018).\n\nBOX 2. Implications and recommendations for policy\n\nThis HIA:\n\nHighlights the importance of evaluating trade policies through a health and well-being economy lens, to develop healthy trade policy.\n\nIndicates that greater transparency of trade agreement negotiations is needed.\n\nSuggests that HIA should be used routinely in the trade policy arena.\n\nProvides a focal point for discussion with policymakers.\n\nCould provide a platform for other HIAs, that is, of the RCEP or specific topics such as ISDS or TRIPS.\n\nIn terms of global policy and practice, the CPTPP HIA has led to further work both internal and external to Wales. For example, it has been used by Welsh Government to inform its own impact assessment on the CPTPP and its response to the UK government, and it was submitted to the UK Parliamentary Committee call for evidence on the impacts of the CPTPP by them and Public Health Wales (Public Health Wales, 2023; UK Parliamentary Committee on Trade, 2023; Welsh Government, 2023). The HIA has also been used to advocate for more HIAs on trade agreements and has been presented at a number of international conferences and fora (American Public Health Association, 2023; Ashton, 2024; Ashton & Green, 2023; Silva et al., 2023), and the authors were asked to present the work at the World Health Organisation global New Economic Expert Group at the end of 2023 (World Health Organization, 2021c).\n\nIn addition, the HIA has contributed to wider Public Health Wales and World Health Organization work on trade and in particular its role in supporting or inhibiting the creation of well-being economies (EuroHealthNet, 2022). Wales is a member of the Wellbeing Alliance and has a focus on sustainable development and well-being in its unique legislation the Wellbeing of the Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 (Welsh Government, 2015). The well-being economy approach is underpinned by the principle that public and private investment, spending and resources should be guided by the extent to which a policy, service or organisation can improve population and societal well-being for all (EuroHealthNet, 2022). In other words, trade agreements should consider health and well-being before, or alongside, economic growth.\n\nThis aligns with recent research from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) linking health and wealth(Thomas et al., 2022). However, UK Government estimates of economic growth are quite small and are only likely to be realised in the long term. The IPPR report argues that correcting failures on population health could help alleviate key economic challenges facing the United Kingdom, including low growth, low productivity, labour market losses and wide inequality. Therefore, given the inextricable links between trade, health and wealth, HIA of trade agreements should play an even more important role in trade policy discussions and scrutiny processes by building in a consideration of health prospectively to maximise health improvement opportunities and mitigate the negative impact. HIAs could prove valuable for other nations too, for example, those party to, or wanting to join, some of the recent mega regional trade agreements recently agreed such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) or the new iteration of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (Inama & Hoekman, 2022; World Economic Forum, 2021). Furthermore, a wide ranging HIA of the World Trade Organization (WTO) multilateral platform or on a specific topic such as Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) or ISDS in relation to access to medicines may also be interesting avenues to pursue.\n\n5 CONCLUSION\n\nThis work has demonstrated the value of a HIA approach to highlight holistic health and equity considerations relevant to trade policy and trade negotiations. It mobilised a wide range of evidence through a transparent and systematic process. The findings of this HIA should be used to inform the implementation of the CPTPP to maximise potential benefits and mitigate any potential risks. The HIA has demonstrated the value of triangulating mixed methods to develop policy recommendations even in situations of uncertainty, but more research is urgently needed. The HIA has highlighted the links between trade, health, well-being and equity and the importance of further work to explore these links and apply this understanding to future trade policy.\n\nBiographies\n\nLiz Green is a Consultant in Public Health and Programme Director for Health Impact Assessment at Public Health Wales.
