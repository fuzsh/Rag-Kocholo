District attorney Robert Garrett (Joe Mantegna) decides to prosecute Rebecca, arguing that she deliberately engaged in wild sex with the old man to overexcite him and lead to his premature death. Defense attorney Frank Dulaney (Willem Dafoe) defends Rebecca in court while getting sucked into a dangerous affair with her.",
