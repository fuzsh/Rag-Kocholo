        "meta_description": "The authors aimed to quantify (a) the periodization of physical loading and daily carbohydrate (CHO) intake across an in-season weekly microcycle of Australian Football and (b) the quantity and source of CHO consumed during game play and training. Physical loading (via global positioning system technology) and daily CHO intake (via a combination of 24-hr recall, food diaries, and remote food photographic method) were assessed in 42 professional male players during two weekly microcycles comprising a home and away fixture. The players also reported the source and quantity of CHO consumed during all games (n = 22 games) and on the training session completed 4 days before each game (n = 22 sessions). The total distance was greater (p < .05) on game day (GD; 13 km) versus all training days. The total distance differed between training days, where GD-2 (8 km) was higher than GD-1, GD-3, and GD-4 (3.5, 0, and 7 km, respectively). The daily CHO intake was also different between training days, with reported intakes of 1.8, 1.4, 2.5, and 4.5 g/kg body mass on GD-4, GD-3, GD-2, and GD-1, respectively. The CHO intake was greater (p < .05) during games (59 ± 19 g) compared with training (1 ± 1 g), where in the former, 75% of the CHO consumed was from fluids as opposed to gels. Although the data suggest that Australian Football players practice elements of CHO periodization, the low absolute CHO intakes likely represent considerable underreporting in this population. Even when accounting for potential underreporting, the data also suggest Australian Football players underconsume CHO in relation to the physical demands of training and competition.",

        "text": "Discussion\n\nUsing a seasonal long analysis, we report for the first time that (a) “in-season” AF training sessions exhibit marked reductions in physical load compared with game play, (b) players’ reported daily CHO intake varies during the weekly microcycle, and (c) players consume greater amounts of CHO (predominantly from fluid sources) during game play versus training. Altogether, these data suggest that players adjust their daily CHO intake in accordance with periodization of the weekly loading patterns. However, an evaluation of reported daily CHO intake suggests that players are likely underconsuming CHO, especially when considered in the context of CHO loading for match play.\n\nTo the authors’ knowledge, we are the first group to quantify physical loading of multiple training sessions as opposed to weekly accumulative loads (Ritchie et al., 2016). We report that physical loads of training sessions were significantly less than game play, as quantified according to the total distance in both the home and away fixture weeks. The training session data are in conjunction with previous authors (Bartlett et al., 2017) who highlighted training session distance to be 6,389 ± 3,315 m. Total running, high-speed running, and sprinting metrics were all lower during training compared with games. Nonetheless, the distances covered during running (1,400 m) and high-speed running (550 m) in AF training are greater than the absolute distances observed in soccer (Anderson et al., 2016), where values of 500 and 100 m were reported, respectively. Such differences between codes are perhaps a reflection of the greater duration of training sessions in AF versus the training sessions observed by Anderson et al. (2016) (i.e., approximately 20 min longer), although we acknowledge this hypothesis is limited to the data provided for only two professional clubs. However, the present data clearly illustrate the periodization of training load across a weekly training microcycle.\n\nIn accordance with the evidence of training load periodization, our data also highlight practices of nutritional periodization, whereby a greater amount of CHO (5 g/kg) was consumed on the day prior to game play compared with lower relative CHO intakes (i.e., <3 g/kg) on training days. The CHO intake reported here on GD-1 agree with previous data, where AF players reported consuming an average of 4.1 g ± 1.6 g/kg CHO per day, as estimated from a 24-hr dietary recall (Bilsborough et al., 2016). However, the low CHO intakes reported on the remainder of the training days do not seem conducive to supporting the daily energetic requirement of male athletes (ranging from 80 to 90 kg), even when considering rest days. As such, we acknowledge the potential of underreporting as a limitation of the present study. Support for the hypothesis of specifically underreporting CHO is provided by the observation that similar periodization patterns of daily energy and CHO intake were observed (see Table 1), whereas daily fat and protein intake did not follow similar patterns. When considering that daily protein and fat intakes were also within the recommended ranges for elite athletes, our data therefore suggest that players may be specifically underreporting CHO intakes.\n\nIn an attempt to account for the magnitude of potential underreporting (e.g., 10–45%) previously observed in athletic populations (Magkos & Yannakoulia, 2003), the range of players’ self-reported CHO intakes on GD-1 can be recalculated to 5.3–6.9 g/kg, a range that is somewhat closer to the CHO loading guidelines (i.e., 7–12 g/kg) advised for the 24 hr prior to competition. Nonetheless, even when accounting for such magnitudes of underreporting of daily CHO intake on the remaining training days (i.e., GD-4, GD-3, and GD-2), recalculation of players’ CHO intake is still <3.6 g/kg. Such intakes may be considered suboptimal when compared with the CHO guidelines (i.e., 5–7 g/kg) for athletes performing moderate-intensity training for 1–2 hr per day (Thomas et al., 2016). When considered this way, our data therefore suggest that the current cohort of AF players is likely underconsuming CHO in relation to contemporary guidelines, even when accounting for underreporting.\n\nIn relation to the quantity of CHO consumed during exercise, we observed marked differences between training (1 ± 1 g/hr) and match play (34 ± 11 g/hr). This apparent difference between CHO intake during each activity is similar to that reported by professional soccer players of the English Premier League, where values of 3 ± 4 and 32 ± 22 g/hr were reported in training and match play, respectively (Anderson et al., 2017). In a case study account, we reported that consumption of 54 g/hr of CHO during AF match play reduced muscle glycogen utilization compared with consumption of 0 g/hr (Routledge et al., 2019). Of the athletes studied here, 53% achieved CHO intakes in the recommended range of 30–60 g/hr. This finding contrasts with soccer players, where only 33% of the players consumed >30 g/hr (Anderson et al., 2017). Furthermore, although we reported that 63% of the CHO consumed by soccer players was from gel sources (Anderson et al., 2017), the athletes studied here consumed 75% of the CHO from fluid sources and only 25% from gel sources. Such differences between studies may be related to regular access to fluids and CHO gels during rotations in AF match play, as well as higher ambient temperatures observed during AF game play (as opposed to that typically observed during the annual English Premier League), potentially suggesting that players consciously practice a CHO feeding strategy that simultaneously intends to promote hydration. In contrast, the choice of gels may offer a superior strategy to English Premier League soccer players, as opposed to fluids per se (usually 6–8% CHO solutions), owing to the flexibility for achieving CHO targets regardless of individual differences in body mass, hydration requirements, and differences in interchange number inherent to AF.\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain if the low absolute CHO intake reported here and the apparent CHO periodization practices were a deliberate choice of the player or alternatively, an unconscious decision. All players had access to the same array of CHO foods and fluids during games and training, and they were not following any coach-led nutritional program, with the exception of receiving prior dietary education on increasing CHO portion sizes on the day before a game. Nonetheless, the CHO periodization practices reported here appear in accordance with the principle of “fuel for the work required” that suggests that athletes should adjust their daily CHO intake in accordance with the workload (Impey et al., 2018). When considered with our previous observations of professional rugby league (Morehen et al., 2016), rugby union (Bradley et al., 2015), and soccer players (Anderson et al., 2017), the present data contribute to the emerging evidence that team sport athletes habitually adjust both the total daily CHO intake and CHO intake during exercise in accordance with the upcoming workload. Nonetheless, even when accounting for potential underreporting of CHO, the low CHO intakes reported here (considered indicative of underfueling) suggest that the current cohort of AF players would benefit from specific education on the CHO requirements of training and GDs. This is especially relevant when considering the training loads completed on GD-4 and GD-2, where total distances >7 km were completed.\n\nIn summary, we simultaneously quantified for the first time the daily physical loading and habitual daily CHO intakes during two weekly in-season microcycles of elite-level AF players. When such data are considered in conjunction with the seasonal quantification of CHO intake during training and matches, our data demonstrate that AF players appear to practice elements of CHO periodization. Furthermore, although we acknowledge that the low absolute CHO intakes likely represent considerable underreporting in this population, the data also suggest that the current cohort of AF players underconsume CHO in relation to the physical demands of training and competition."
