        "text": "Some have suggested that menopause was much easier for Asian women than for Westerners—at least while women followed traditional, mostly plant-based diets. Hot flashes have been reported by only about 10 percent of women in China,1 17.6 percent of women in Singapore,2 and 22.1 percent of women in Japan.3 In contrast, it is estimated that hot flashes are experienced by 75 percent of women over the age of 50 in the United States.4 Whether these differences might be partly due to reluctance in reporting symptoms among Asians is not entirely clear. And as Asia’s diets gradually westernize, these differences are likely to disappear anyway.\n\nBut we do know that, throughout their lives, Western women consume much more meat, and about four times as much fat, as women on traditional Asian rice-based diets, and only one-quarter to one-half the fiber. For reasons that have never been completely clear, a high-fat, low-fiber diet causes a rise in estrogen levels. Women on higher-fat diets have measurably more estrogen activity than do those on low-fat diets. At menopause, the ovaries’ production of estrogen comes to a halt. Those women who have been on high-fat diets then have a dramatic drop in estrogen levels. The drop appears to be less dramatic for Asian women who have lower levels of estrogen both before and after menopause. The resulting symptoms are much milder or even nonexistent.\n\nMore evidence of the diet link comes from a fascinating study by a medical anthropologist from the University of California who interviewed Greek and Mayan women about their experiences of menopause.5\n\nThe Greek women were subsistence farmers. Menopause occurred at an average age of 47, compared with an average age of more than 50 in the United States. About three-quarters of the Greek women had hot flashes, but they were considered normal events and did not cause the women to seek medical treatment.\n\nThe Mayan women lived in the southeastern part of Yucatan, Mexico. Menopause occurred earlier than in Greece or North America, at an average age of 42. Unlike the experience of Greeks and Americans, hot flashes were totally unknown among Mayans, and, like the Japanese, they have no word for them. Midwives, medical personnel, and the women themselves reported that hot flashes simply do not occur, nor are they mentioned in books on Mayan botanical medicine.\n\nThe difference between Americans and Greeks and other Europeans on the one hand, for whom hot flashes are common, and the Mayans and Japanese on the other, for whom hot flashes are rare or unknown, appears to be diet. The Mayan diet consists of corn and corn tortillas, beans, tomatoes, squash, sweet potatoes, radishes, and other vegetables, with very little meat and no dairy products. Like the traditional Japanese diet, it is extremely low in animal products and low in fat in general. The Greek diet, while rich in vegetables and legumes, also contains meat, fish, cheese, and milk, as does the cuisine of other countries in Europe and North America. Animal-based meals affect hormone levels rapidly and strongly, and undoubtedly contribute to the menopausal problems that are common in Western countries.\n\nIn addition to a low-fat, vegetarian diet which is strongly recommended for women who are experiencing hot flashes, regular aerobic exercise helps.6 A vigorous walk every day or so, or any equivalent physical activity, seems to ease hot flashes.\n\nA number of herbal and dietary supplements claim to alleviate menopausal symptoms. Some studies have shown that black cohosh6,7,8 and soy6,7 to a lesser extent, may help. Trials of vitamin E, dong quai, and other such treatments have shown little evidence that they alleviate symptoms, however, this topic still needs much research.9 Dietary supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and it is important to talk to your doctor before taking any kind of supplement.\n\nFor those women who are considering hormone supplements, some preparations may be safer than others. Estrogens commonly prescribed by physicians contain significant amounts of estradiol, which is one of the forms of estrogen that has scientists and many postmenopausal women concerned about cancer risk. A different estrogen, estriol, appears to be safer. The best evidence indicates that estriol does not increase cancer risk.10,11,12,13 Plant-derived transdermal creams containing estriol and smaller amounts of other estrogens are available without a prescription. The estrogens pass through the skin and enter the blood stream, reducing menopausal symptoms. Creams containing pure estriol must be ordered by doctors, not because they are more dangerous (they are not), but because the process of concentrating them qualifies them as drugs, rather than natural preparations. If these creams are used, they should be accompanied by progesterone to reduce the risk of uterine cancer and use should be monitored by a physician. Regrettably, less research has been done on the use of estriol than estradiol.\n\nHormone shifts can affect moods. It can be disturbing to find yourself feeling uncharacteristically nervous or depressed or having memory lapses. Sometimes these feelings can even strain your relationships with others. It helps to know that the psychological effects of menopause are temporary. In all likelihood, you’ll soon get back on an even keel. Here are the most common psychological accompaniments of menopause.\n\nAnxiety. Women who have never had a problem with anxiety before may become more self-conscious and worried about minor events. In some cases, panic attacks occur. Mental health professionals have a variety of effective treatments. Many people feel much better just knowing what the condition is. The most important piece of advice is not to let anxiety restrict your activities. When anxiety or panic disorders cause people to avoid stressful situations, the result can be an ever-tightening leash that keeps them from enjoying life. Anxiety can lead to avoidance of many aspects of normal life. Prompt treatment prevents this.\n\nDepression and Irritability. Depression can be a problem for menopausal women.14,15 Irritability is also common.16 When considering treatment for depression, irritability, or anxiety, it is important to explore the full range of available options. The first step is to get your diet in order and to get regular exercise to help stabilize hormone shifts and reduce physical symptoms that can aggravate mood problems. Psychotherapy can be very useful, and new short-term techniques have demonstrated their effectiveness at considerably less investment than is demanded by traditional therapies. New antidepressants and antianxiety drugs have fewer side effects than older medications.\n\nPoor Memory and Concentration. Some women find that menopause brings occasional memory lapses, often related to reduced ability to concentrate. This can be upsetting and annoying, but fortunately it seems to go away on its own with time.\n\nWhen you eliminate these calcium-wasters, you need less calcium in your diet. However, you will always need some calcium. The World Health Organization recommends 800 mg per day for postmenopausal women on a diet low in animal protein.28\n\nAlthough many people try to get their calcium from milk, only about 30 percent of calcium in dairy products is absorbed.29 The remaining 70 percent never makes it past the intestinal wall and is simply excreted with the feces. Milk products also contain lactose sugar, animal proteins, and frequent traces of antibiotics and other contaminants.\n\nThe most healthful calcium sources are greens and beans. Green leafy vegetables are loaded with calcium. One cup of collard greens has 226 milligrams of calcium. What’s more, the calcium in most green leafy vegetables is more absorbable than the calcium in milk. An exception is spinach, which tends to keep its calcium to itself. Beans, lentils, and other legumes are also loaded with calcium. If you make green vegetables and beans regular parts of your diet, you’ll get two excellent sources of calcium. Calcium-fortified orange juice contains more calcium than milk, and it is in the form of calcium citrate, which is much more readily absorbed than that in milk or in calcium carbonate supplements.\n\nYou don’t need to eat six cups of greens or huge servings of beans to get enough calcium. A varied menu of vegetables and legumes can easily give you all you need, and the amount your body needs is far less when you steer clear of meats and the other calcium depleters.\n\nHealthful Calcium Sources\n\nBlack turtle beans (1 cup, boiled): 102 milligrams\n\nBroccoli (1 cup, boiled from frozen): 94\n\nBrussels sprouts (1 cup, boiled): 56\n\nButternut squash (1 cup, boiled): 84\n\nCelery (1 cup, boiled): 63\n\nChickpeas (1 cup, canned): 80\n\nCollards (1 cup, boiled): 226\n\nFigs, dried (10 medium): 270\n\nGreat northern beans (1 cup, boiled): 120\n\nGreen beans (1 cup, boiled): 58\n\nKale (1 cup, boiled): 94\n\nKidney beans (1 cup, boiled): 50\n\nLentils (1 cup, boiled): 38\n\nLima beans (1 cup, boiled): 54\n\nMustard greens (1 cup, boiled): 104\n\nNavel orange (1 medium): 56\n\nNavy beans (1 cup, boiled): 127\n\nNondairy milk (1 cup, fortified soy or rice): 300\n\nOatmeal (1 cup, prepared instant): 215\n\nOnions (1 cup, boiled): 46\n\nOrange juice, calcium-fortified (1 cup): 350\n\nPinto beans (1 cup, boiled): 82\n\nRaisins (1/2 cup): 40\n\nSoybeans (1 cup, boiled): 175\n\nSweet potato (1 cup, boiled): 69\n\nTofu (1/2 cup): 204\n\nTurnip greens (1 cup, boiled): 148\n\nVegetarian baked beans (1 cup): 127\n\nWhite beans (1 cup, boiled): 161\n\nSource: Pennington JA, Douglas JS.
