        "text": "The Bottom Line\n\nI don't think its totally necessary to dredge up the dissatisfaction with \"The Shining\" by both the fans and author Stephen King. It's my contention that years later as we now reflect on this, that \"The Shining\" and Kubrick more than hold their own, in fact if it were a cat-fight between Stephen and Stanley... Stanley wins it hands down.\n\nWhy?\n\nKing produced his own TV version of \"The Shining\" afterward, which was by many people standards quite good, but extended beyond its necessity to suit the length of a \"mini-series\" ( final toll almost 5 hours ). In rating points it actually bombed and King states this was due to the popularity of the film. Kubrick had to cut corners somewhere from the book, and although I agree that the characterizations were weaker than they could have been ( and the addition of more of Dick Halloran would have been a benefit ), the film ran over 140 minutes ( and could easily have gone 3 hours ) but for logistics, the full story had to be trimmed. It should also be stated that Stephen King is an immensely talented writer, with the ability to have some of his novels, like \"The Stand\" and \"The Dead Zone\", called masterpieces. He takes his craft very seriously, but by no means is \"The Shining\" a perfect story. In Kings biography he does state that \"The Shining\" is one of his favorite films of all time. So what does that imply ?\n\nThe general consensus of marketing Horror films is through the exploitive element. They bill the film as \"better\" in a more gory and gruesome sense than had ever been previously seen. Although Kubrick burned some rather disturbing images in the viewers head with \"The Shining\", it was going no where near the cheap thrill level of a teen-slasher ( Friday the 13th, Halloween etc. ) type film. On the contrary, Kubrick films are of a slow with deliberate pacing, setting the crux of the film extremely subtly.\n\nStanley Kubrick is said to be an obsessive perfectionist in his field. This film holds the Guinness Book of World Records for requiring Shelley Duvall to do 127 takes for one scene. On another occasion he required Jack Nicholson to do over 100 takes, stating \"the longer we do it, the better he gets\". The score ( changed again by Kubrick ) was originally supposed to have been done by John Williams. It was replaced by Kubricks own collection with music by Béla Bartók (from \"Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta\")\n\nHector Berlioz, György Ligeti and Krzysztof Penderecki. This is how Kubrick crafts his films... he must conquer/control the idea/project/novel completely to transmogrify them into his own masterpiece. He has done so again with startling brilliance. Like almost all Kubrick works, this is a film that one appreciates more the more one sees it. It's a shame more horror films are not all this good.\n\nREGARDING THE EDIT - NOTE: (sent in email by Francois) \"To sum it up, Shelley Duvall mentioned the deleted scene in an interview to French movie magazine \"Positif\" (which had a strong Kubrick coverage due to Kubrick expert Michel Ciment). It took place in a hospital where hotel manager Stuart Ullman visited Wendy and Danny, recovering, a few days after the events. Ullman told Wendy that Jack's body hadn't been found so far. He spoke with her about her plans for the future and showed concern for Danny and her. Then, he moved to Danny and threw a rubber ball at him. The rubber ball bounced exactly like the one Danny had found earlier in the lobby, suggesting that Ullman had been an accomplice with all the things evil from the very beginning. Cut to the final scene in the hall with the picture.\n\nDuvall spoke of it as an \"Hitchcockian ending\", which was no surprise given Kubrick's love for Hitchcock. She had a clear recollection of the whole scene as it was a tracking shot requiring dozens of takes before getting one with the very same bounces.\n\nPeter didn't mention in his recollection the bouncing ball. Maybe this part of the shot was already cut in the theatrical version, maybe it wasn't very effective to the audiences, which would explain why Kubrick removed it. In the event, he made way for one of the most powerful edits in all his work, going in a few shots from Jack's frozen body to the group photograph of 1921.\" (Thanks Francois!)\n\nout of\n\nThe DVD\n\nI found many of the complaints of this DVD to be unfounded, but also a few to be accurate. Firstly, complaints of it not being Widescreen; the major benefit to having a film be WS is that it is kept in the directors intended original aspect ratio. For Kubrick and \"The Shining\", this was the case. He intended to shoot the movie in \"Full Frame\" or \"Academy Ratio\" of 1.33:1 . Having had a distasteful experience with his masterpiece \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" being cropped by British television, Kubrick vowed never to let that happen again. His solution was to shoot ALL his films from that point onward in Full Frame. It would have been nice to have an improved picture with an anamorphic squeeze, but rest assured regardless of comments regarding the blank spaces in the upper and bottom portion of the screen, we are seeing the film the way Mr. Kubrick wanted us to. This also includes the sound, a Dolby Digital 2.0 track. Probably the best additional feature I have seen on any DVD yet is the inclusion on \"The Shining\" of a short film ( 35 minutes ) by Vivian Kubrick ( youngest daughter ) as an ad-hock documentary on \"the making of\". It is the only known film showing Kubrick at the actual task of directing. For Kubrick devotees, this is a must have, even if for first hand witnessing of his exasperation with Shelley Duvall and the frankness of Jack Nicholson as he gets into character.\n\nUnfortunately, the film has not been restored for DVD. A new version of this DVD is coming out in June, 2001, and it is restored Some of the colors may seen washed out at times, but nothing of an extravagant nature in this version. In the new DVD, the Vivian Kubrick short, will be there and they have actually upgraded the sound to Dolby Digital 5.1... so in essence, in the new DVD you are NOT hearing \"The Shining\" in the way that Mr. Kubrick intended. ???\n\nThe DVD gets out of"
