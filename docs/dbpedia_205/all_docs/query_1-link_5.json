        "text": "Douglas Milsome is a veteran English cinematographer best-known for his camera work under pioneering director Stanley Kubrick. After earning his first film credits as an assistant cameraman on the American adventure drama \"Visit to a Chief's Son\" in 1974, Milsome worked as the focus puller--a lens-oriented gig--under cinematographer and fellow Englishman David Alcott, for Kubrick's 1975 Oscar-winning war drama, \"Barry Lyndon.\" Milsome's other contributions to the Kubrick pantheon include a role as focus puller again for the '80 horror classic \"The Shining,\" lighting cameraman for \"Full Metal Jacket\"--Kubrick's psychology-heavy meditation on the Vietnam War--and in 1999, a spot as a consultant for Kubrick's final film, the mysterious thriller \"Eyes Wide Shut.\" Milsome made his debut as a cinematographer in his own right with the 1983 New Zealand drama \"Wild Horses,\" and the films he's photographed away from Kubrick have generally garnered little fanfare. An exception was the 1991 action-adventure romp \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,\" a box-office smash which starred Kevin Costner and Morgan Freeman. Less reputable projects have included the 2000 screen geek-fest \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and two straight-to-video \"Dracula\" movies from the mid-2000s. On television, Milsome shot movie biopics devoted to the lives of two legendary women--1993's \"Diana: Her True Story\" and 1995's \"Liz:The Elizabeth Taylor Story,\" but his most critically-acclaimed project was the four-episode, epic mini-series \"Lonesome Dove\" (1989), for which he earned an Outstanding Cinematography Emmy nomination."
