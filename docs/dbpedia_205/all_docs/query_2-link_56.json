        "text": "Really don't get why this film got such bad reviews. It's an okay thriller, nothing mind blowing but decent enough for a watch. And Madonna is hot af in it!\n\nRemember this coming on late one night when I was flicking through the channels as a teenage boy, was like striking gold. So it gets an extra star for that ? Personally I prefer it over Basic Instinct which it's often compared to. Just found it more interesting for some reason , and Madonna was a better seductress. Which is what the movies are mainly about really.\n\nAnd the cast was actually better too. Frank Langella and Julian Moore in supporting roles!\n\nA dated rip-off of BASIC INSTINCT, riding the wave of the psycho thriller genre's popularity in the early 1990s. I remember this one being mildly controversial back in the day due to the explicitness of the sex scenes, but it simply isn't a very good movie. Madonna gives a wooden turn as a Hitchcockian femme fatale who may or may not be responsible for the murder of an aged lover; Willem Dafoe's her lawyer. The near-the-knuckle sex scenes stand out to better or worse effect, but the courtroom drama is rather turgid and good supporting cast members are wasted."
