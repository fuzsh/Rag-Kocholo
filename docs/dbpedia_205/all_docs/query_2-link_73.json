        "text": ".\n\nEvidence revolves around jealousy, friendship, love, lust and murders. Director Praveen CP, who makes debut as an independent director in Sandalwood with this movie, has succeeded in keeping the audiences on the edge of their seats.\n\nAppropriate introduction of evidence at regular intervals to make the process of interrogation interesting is his USP and what is more, he has ensured there is much-needed relief to the audiences at intervals.\n\nThe introduction of Robo Ganesh in a new avatar indicates the director is all set to come up with a sequel – Ravana arrives - to this movie.\n\nThe movie begins with Shashi (Karthik Varnekar) visiting an isolated place by mistake. He finds a bag, consisting of a stethoscope and a camera, in his car. At this juncture, the director narrates how the government appointed police officer Priya Ramakrishnan (Manasa Joshi) to investigate the deaths of Swaroop (Akarsh Aditya) and Sanvy (Rachita) that were assumed to be suicides.\n\nPriya summons Dr Kevin (Robo Ganesh) to the police station. The process of interrogation begins and the latter denies his involvement in the murder that is closed by the police as a suicide case. What happens to Dr Kevin and whether or not the police officer produces the evidence to prove Dr Kevin guilty is what the movie is all about.\n\nRobo Ganesh is convincing as the villain. His body language and gestures are good. Manasa Joshi, as a tough cop, has acted well. Rachita has tried her best to prove her dance skills. Manmohan Rai and Shivakumar Aradhya provide good support. Well-known Telugu actor Chamak Chandra, who plays still photographer Pushpa, fails to impress. His dialogue delivery is not up to the mark. It is not clear why the director selected Chamak Chandra for this movie.\n\n.\n\nThe song – Ayyayyo Aremanake Rekke Bandanthaagide – sung by Chetan Naik is melodious.\n\nIt is worth a watch for those who crave suspense thrillers."
