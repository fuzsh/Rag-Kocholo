        "text": "Sorry - I didn't ask Willem Dafoe about the size of his dong. It wasn't a failure of nerve exactly, more a failure of will. I couldn't bring myself to care enough. Also, I thought he was waiting for me to ask so that he could deliver some prepared putdown, and I wanted to deny him that moment of triumph. Anyway, there is plenty of independent evidence of its grandeur. When he appeared naked in a play in New York, a reviewer noted that, 'As one, the women in the audience let out a gasp of delighted astonishment.' Then Madonna chose him as her leading man for Body of Evidence and I'm sure she wouldn't want to waste her time dropping candlewax on just an average-sized willy.\n\nEnough already. We know Dafoe is King Dong - what else has he got going for him? Well, obviously he is a good actor - two Oscar nominations (for Platoon and last year's Shadow of the Vampire), plus an unforgettable cameo as the worm-swallowing paraplegic in Born on the Fourth of July, another as the morphine-shooting spy in The English Patient, and yet another as the motel creeper in David Lynch's Wild at Heart. He is always good at scene-stealing weirdos, but he was also good as Christ in Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ and as TS Eliot in Tom & Viv. In fact, his filmography is altogether impressive, largely because he chooses to work with interesting directors. He can afford to pick his films because the rest of the time he is fully engaged as a stage actor at the Wooster Group in New York, a company he co-founded with his partner, Elizabeth LeCompte, 24 years ago.\n\nMost women find him gorgeous. He has a very striking face - big mouth, big teeth, big eyes, triangular flat 'medieval' cheeks. He can do a sudden teeth-baring grin like Jack Nicholson's, which can be either terrifying or seductive. And he moves well, like a dancer, with a natural grace and rippling pantherish muscles. But I have to say that meeting him in the flesh in London, I was terribly disappointed. First - like so many film actors - he is shorter than you expect, about five six or seven. Second, he was wearing a dull grey suit and what looked like a polyester eau de nil shirt. His thick wavy hair was dyed purply-black (he explained he is currently playing a Mexican in a film), but his skimpy moustache was a Robin Cook ginger. Plus, he kept running away and giggling with Ralph Fiennes.\n\nThis was at a party given by Sally Greene in her Cheyne Walk home, where the guests included not only fabulous me, but also Jerry Hall, Peter Mandelson, Chris Smith, Salman Rushdie, Fiona Shaw, plus an awful lot of middle-aged men in suits. It was a strange atmosphere, because no one seemed to know why they were invited - Peter Mandelson actually asked me (moi!) 'Who are all these people?' but I couldn't tell him. Many of the women cast yearning glances at Ralph Fiennes, but he was locked in conversation with Willem Dafoe. (They have been friends since The English Patient, Dafoe told me later, 'We meet somewhere in our heads.') Then Sally Greene summoned us all indoors, and stood on the stairs and made a brisk speech explaining what it was all about. She and Old Vic Productions (which she runs) and Lift, the London International Festival of Theatre, are bringing Dafoe's Wooster Group company over from New York for a season in London at the Riverside Studios next May, and this party was by way of a fund-raising launch. She summoned Dafoe to explain the work of the Wooster Group, but he made one of those awful oh-how-I-hate-public-speaking speeches, which just sort of petered out before he scampered away to gossip with Ralph Fiennes again. It was Fiona Shaw, a very bright cookie indeed, who saved the day. She leapt up the stairs, made lots of good jokes, then said, 'We need money, so dig deep in your pockets. What am I bid for 10 tickets for the Wooster Group season?' Jerry Hall gamely opened the bidding with £2,000, but there was a lot of shuffling after that. Fiona Shaw appealed to Ralph Fiennes, but he seemed to have gone deaf, Mandelson disappeared in a puff of smoke, and everyone was busy staring at their shoes. But then an American lady called Rhona Beck shouted £5,000 and her husband Graham immediately bellowed 'Make that £10,000!' (truly, the rich are different) and honour was satisfied.\n\nNext day I went to interview Dafoe in his hotel bedroom at One Aldwych. (Maybe it was the looming presence of the double bed that made me disinclined to ask the willy question.) He was perfectly friendly, and willing to talk about the Wooster Group seemingly for ever. This was the problem, though. I have only ever met one person who talks more slowly than Dafoe and that's John Malkovich, who sometimes seems to go into a coma between commas. But at least with Malkovich the words are usually quite interesting when they eventually emerge - not so with Dafoe. A fairly simple question like 'Do you prefer rehearsing or performing?' elicits the following, which I promise you is a masterpiece of concision compared to some of his answers:\n\n'You know, I can't decide. I think I like performing. But in the making of a piece, we treat every rehearsal like a performance. I mean we enter the room and we try to put a text or an architecture or a piece of music or a dance on its feet, and the only way we know whether it appeals to us is to do it as if it were a performance. But at the same time I like the ritual of performing and reinvesting a score every night in a new way. It's a way that I feel very engaged. It's a good game, it's like being an athlete, it's like a great meditation. So I think I actually prefer performing to rehearsing. I love the idea of approaching the score. I love the doing . I don't like the planning, I don't like the ruminating, as much as I love the doing. I have a pure pleasure in the athleticism of that and the place where it puts me - everything drops away and I get a deep pleasure and I feel unified in a way doing simple actions that sometimes you don't have in life. There's a clarity there. I thrill to have that. Whereas often in rehearsal, particularly when we're making the pieces, there's a huge part of me that's always standing outside of it, watching to see how we're making it.'\n\nPhew - glad we've got that clear. He likes rehearsing, but he prefers performing. What can you do with answers like this, except wish profoundly you had never asked the question? But it's part of the quid pro quo of interviewing that you have to ask about 'the work' - the trouble is, the ice cap could have melted by the time he finishes. So let's leave him droning on about the space he's coming from, while I fill you in with some basic biog.\n\nHe was born in Appleton, Wisconsin, a polluted papermill town, in 1955. His father was a surgeon, his mother a nurse, both very hard-working, and they had eight children of whom he was the seventh. He says his parents weren't Catholics, they used contraception, but they just must have been incredibly fertile because they kept producing babies. In theory, they were strict, even puritanical, but in practice, by the time he was born the rules had all broken down and 'It was chaos. It would hurt my mother if she read that but... it was.' Sometimes his older sisters looked after him, but mainly he looked after himself - being in a large family, he says, makes you self-sufficient. But, 'there are always identity questions. The picture is of a bunch of little piggies reaching for the teats, you know? And you've got to find your way in. And my way probably was to act up, and be a practical joker, a mimic, so I think that's really what made me a performer. Just to get attention.'\n\nHis brothers and sisters all went through university and became doctors and lawyers. But he dropped out of the University of Wisconsin and joined a Milwaukee theatre group, Theatre X, and toured Europe for two years. It was a big change from Appleton. 'I saw people, and ways of living, that I didn't know existed. You fall about two economic classes immediately. You live in a bad neighbourhood, with the kind of people you've never lived with before, you start to try and educate yourself and adopt different views. You leave behind the Republican notions of your family and become a little radicalised, in every way. It's really starting over. But, you know, I was interested in losing myself - and I still am, in some ways. One of the pleasures of pretending, and telling other people's stories, is to get a different take on your own.'\n\nHe landed in New York at 22, and gravitated to the Performance Group theatre. When he arrived he overheard Elizabeth LeCompte, the director, having a great row with Richard Schechner, the founder, shouting: 'Get him out of my house!' He remembers thinking, 'Hmm. Tough broad... It was only later that I found out she was sexy as well.' LeCompte flounced out of the Performance Group to start the Wooster Theatre Group - and took Dafoe with her, as her leading man and lover. He was 22, she 33. They have never married but they have a son, Jack, now 19.\n\nFor a few years Dafoe devoted himself entirely to the Wooster Group, but in 1982 he made his film debut in The Loveless, and then soared through the next decade - Streets of Fire, To Live and Die in LA, Platoon, The Last Temptation of Christ, Mississippi Burning, Born on the Fourth of July, Wild at Heart. But then came the disaster that was Body of Evidence in 1993. He gave a curiously feeble performance as Madonna's lawyer and bedmate, not helped by a pompadour hairdo of almost Melvyn Braggian proportions. When Madonna dropped hot wax on his penis he winced as daintily as a manicurist encountering a broken nail. The film was not so much panned as excoriated by the critics; audiences laughed through the sex scenes and cheered at Madonna's murder. It is still a sore subject for Dafoe.\n\nWhat did he think of his own performance? 'You know, I do have thoughts, but on principle I prefer not to say. Not publicly. Because then they harden into opinions and then that kind of straps me. Why label yourself? Why take away people's imagination? What I may think is horrible, someone else might find great value in, so if I'm disappointed in a performance why spoil it for someone else? The more you make public certain opinions, the more inflexible your ability to transform is. What guides me are instincts. I think you learn your lessons intuitively, and the only reason why you would want to make a judgement on something once done, is to learn a lesson to avoid it. And I think you learn your lessons deeply! Do you understand?'\n\nI understand he knows he gave a bad performance, but we're not allowed to say so because it might harden into an opinion and we don't want that, do we? Goodness, we might be guilty of judgementalism. Anyway, after Body of Evidence, his Hollywood stock plummeted, and since then he has mainly worked in 'international' films - ie the films you only come across years later in some foreign hotel room. He is currently playing a Mexican in Robert Rodriguez's Once Upon a Time in Mexico - hence his dyed hair - and will be seen later this year in Paul McGuigan's The Reckoning, in which he plays the head of a medieval theatre company. His next proper Hollywood film is Spiderman, in which he plays the Green Goblin - a part originally offered to John Malkovich - but we'll have to wait till next summer to see it. Between films, he goes back home to work with the Wooster Group in New York.\n\nHe says being with the group is like being in a big family, but there's always an odd moment of readjustment. 'You'll come home and they'll listen to your stories, but after a bit it's \"Let's get on with it and do what we're here to do\", and you're just another dope trying to get this show on its legs.' But it must be an odd relationship with LeCompte when she is both the 'mother' of the group, and his partner. He says they often have rows in rehearsals - just the other day she called him 'psychotic for attention' - but that's fine. 'I think in a lot of relationships there tends to be a support person and a headliner, but for us it goes flip flop flip flop all the time. So it's not like I can go home and complain about my horrible boss - there's no place to run to.' But at least he can go away and do a film when things get bad? 'It's true. God bless her. I owe her. I go out and I have these adventures and I think I bring back something with me, hopefully, in very real ways...' Such as money? 'Yes, and other ways as well. But for me personally that does create hiccups in the process. Much to my frustration, because I feel that some of the other people who are there all the time have a dynamism that I go in and out of. But it's my choice - and they are ridiculously supportive of my efforts outside.'\n\nBut Hollywood doesn't always smile sweetly at actors who say they prefer doing theatre - does he think that's why he's never won an Oscar? 'People may put that kind of spin on it. I feel very easy about it. You know, when Hollywood works for me I love it, when it doesn't work for me, I don't love it, you know? But there are certain things that are just plain true: I prefer living in New York. That doesn't mean I hate LA. When I'm in LA I try to be happy there. The only thing about Hollywood is that whoever's doing the best business is celebrated, and people that aren't even respected in their art are exalted because of their commercial clout. That's understandable. You can cry about it, but that's just the reality of it. But if I was in those shoes, I would probably think it was a wonderful set-up. But since I seldom am, I can rail against it.'\n\nI told him, 'You do have a youthful street cred because people see you as a wild and wacky character...' and he interrupted, 'That's nice! I appreciate that.' But, I went on remorselessly, that it is only because people, very stupidly, confuse actors with the parts they play. He plays weirdos but, in fact, I would suggest, he is actually a very straight solid citizen - he has lived with the same woman for 20 odd years, stayed in the same theatre group, raised a son, never done anything too outrageous, never been druggy, as far as I know, never been drunk, never misbehaved. His face falls at this diagnosis, and he seems disposed to argue. OK, perhaps I'm wrong - was he ever druggy? 'None of your business!' he laughs. 'You want to leave that open?' 'Sure. On principle. Not to preach and not to repent.' 'What about booze?' 'What do you think? Look at my face. You know they say you get the face you deserve. What would it matter? Look. When I read profiles of actors, I love to read the personal stuff as much as the next person. And also when I'm in a room with you, I want to co-operate, you can seduce me with attention and I'll tell you anything. [In retrospect this is the moment when I should have asked the willy question, but I was numb with boredom.] However, there are certain things I don't want people to know about me, good and bad. I want to be a blank slate. So, you know, I want it both ways: I want people to be interested in me and come to see me in movies, but at the same time I don't want them to know much about me because I want to be revealed through the characters. I am an actor. I want to reveal myself, but in this context. I hear those questions and I get self-conscious immediately - not because I don't know the truth, but because I don't know how to package it, because I don't want to turn myself into a package. There's pleasure when I walk down the street and someone doesn't know my name, that they say \"You're the actor! I love what you do.\" It's preferable to someone saying \"Oh Willem Dafoe\" and having a certain projection of who I am. Maybe I'm being unrealistic about this, but those are my impulses when I hear those questions. I love what you're doing. But do you understand what I'm saying? I wish I could lie. I admire liars. I wish I could just make shit up, like when you asked me about a druggy life, I wish I could make you up a whole story, and then in a different interview, another story.' God, so do I! I'm sure he'll be brilliant in the Wooster Group season, and all you eager theatregoers should be rushing now to book your tickets. But as an interviewee I'd rather have the talking clock."
