        "text": "As the UK’s leading film service, FilmFixer handles approximately 8,000 film shoots a year and works with every major production filming in London and South East England. We help local authorities and landowners to generate revenue from location filming, and make film permitting simple.\n\nRecognising the need for stronger links between local authorities, stakeholders and filmmakers, company directors Andrew Pavord and Karen Everett founded FilmFixer in 2007. Their experience working in locations departments gave them invaluable insight into how local authorities could better meet the needs of the film industry, whilst maximising income and protecting local communities.\n\nOur clients and their objectives are at the heart of the service we provide. We proudly manage filming on behalf of 13 London boroughs – more than any other provider – as well as a diverse array of private landowners, including Lee Valley Regional Park Authority and The Peabody Group. We also deliver Screen Suffolk on behalf of all district, county, and borough councils.\n\nFrom its inception, FilmFixer’s purpose has been to realise the potential of locations. Using our bespoke suite of products and services, we smooth the application process for film crews, providing dedicated support – from scouting to wrap.\n\nTo ensure location filming is sustainable, we work with local communities and key stakeholders to secure charitable donations and provide employability training. We know a well-managed film shoot can have far-reaching benefits not only for the film industry and landowners but, crucially, for the areas that host filming.\n\nOur wraparound service makes location filming simple and straightforward, building relationships and securing return custom. FilmFixer’s expertise and capability achieve the best results for local communities, landowners, local authorities, and filmmakers alike.\n\nApply4 provides a flexible online permitting service for local authorities, government agencies and private landowners. Our clients are worldwide from Miami, Seattle and Honolulu in the US to Auckland and Wellington in New Zealand.\n\nOur dedicated location management software, FilmApp, enables our clients to offer online applications and to administer the permitting process in the most effective way. Applicants supply their information using a simple interface and the resulting data is stored safely in the cloud, allowing the administrator to generate invoices, stakeholder notifications, reports, and filming permits.\n\nMade by filmmakers, for filmmakers, FilmApp is the global industry standard in online film permitting and is used by 23 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation to process their filming applications.\n\nSet Ready is our non-profit training and employment programme. In order to connect our local communities to the productions we support, we offer essential training for people wishing to start a career in the film and TV industry.\n\nThrough a series of masterclasses, seminars, and session-based Q&As, Set Ready training is specially designed to teach participants crucial skills for working on set. Upon completion of the course, trainees are offered entry-level, paid work experience on major productions to practise their new skills and start their career on set.\n\nWe are proud to support the crews of the future.\n\nFilmFixer is committed to reducing air pollution caused by location filming. Working alongside film and TV crews, production companies, fellow film offices and equipment suppliers, The Generator Project is a collaborative effort to speed up our industry’s transition to greener methods of power supply.\n\nWe understand the impact traditional generators have on the environment and public health, and our unique position in the industry affords us the opportunity to play a pivotal role in supporting cleaner methods of temporary power supply in public spaces.\n\nThe Generator Project’s aim is to promote emerging Battery Technology, to increase the availability of Stage V generators, and to advocate for the use of Green HVO, Hydrogen & LPG fuels. Via an easy-to-use app, we collect data about generator usage on sets and use this to demonstrate the scale of the issue and incentivise the increased production of greener alternatives."
