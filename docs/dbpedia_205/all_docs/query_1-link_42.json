        "text": "To maximize energy savings, entry into torpor should involve a fast reduction of metabolic rate and body temperature (Tb); that is, animals should thermoconform. However, animals often defend against the decrease in Tb via a temporary increase in thermoregulatory heat production, slowing the cooling process. We investigated how thermoregulating or thermoconforming during torpor entry affects temporal and thermoenergetic aspects in relation to body mass and age in juvenile and adult fat-tailed dunnarts (Sminthopsis crassicaudata; Marsupialia: Dasyuridae). During torpor entry, juvenile thermoconformers cooled twice as fast as and used less energy during cooling than juvenile thermoregulators. While both juvenile and adult thermoconformers had a lower minimum Tb, a lower torpor metabolic rate, and longer torpor bouts than thermoregulators, these differences were more pronounced in the juveniles. Rewarming from torpor took approximately twice as long for juvenile thermoconformers, and the costs of rewarming were greater. To determine the difference in average daily metabolic rate between thermoconformers and thermoregulators independent of body mass, we compared juveniles of a similar size (∼13 g) and similarly sized adults (∼17 g). The average daily metabolic rate was 7% (juveniles) and 17% (adults) less in thermoconformers than in thermoregulators, even though thermoconformers were active for longer. Our data suggest that thermoconforming during torpor entry provides an energetic advantage for both juvenile and adult dunnarts and may aid growth for juveniles. While thermoregulation during torpor entry is more costly, it still saves energy, and the higher Tb permits greater alertness and mobility and reduces the energetic cost of endogenous rewarming.\n\nHow do large and small reptiles defend against infections, given the consequences of body mass for physiology and disease transmission? Functionally equivalent mammalian and avian granulocytes increased disproportionately with body mass (i.e., scaled hypermetrically), such that large organisms had higher concentrations than expected by a prediction of proportional protection across sizes. However, as these scaling relationships were derived from endothermic animals, they do not necessarily inform the scaling of leukocyte concentration for ectothermic reptiles that have a different physiology and evolutionary history. Here, we asked whether and how lymphocyte and heterophil concentrations relate to body mass among more than 120 reptile species. We compared these relationships to those found in birds and mammals and to existing scaling frameworks (i.e., protecton, complexity, rate of metabolism, or safety factor hypotheses). Both lymphocyte and heterophil concentrations scaled almost isometrically among reptiles. In contrast, functionally equivalent granulocytes scaled hypermetrically and lymphocytes scaled isometrically in birds and mammals. Life history traits were also poor predictors of variation in reptilian heterophil and lymphocyte concentrations. Our results provide insight into differences in immune protection in birds and mammals relative to that in reptiles through a comparative lens. The shape of scaling relationships differs, which should be considered when modeling disease dynamics among these groups.\n\nBy allowing for increased absorption or reflectance of solar radiation, changes in pigmentation may assist ectotherms in responding to immune challenges by enabling a more precise regulation of behavioral fever or hypothermia. Variation in epigenetic characteristics may also assist in regulating immune-induced pigmentation changes and managing the body’s energetic reserves following infection. Here, we explore how dorsal pigmentation, metabolic rate, and DNA methylation in the Florida scrub lizard (Sceloporus woodi) respond to two levels of immune challenge across two habitat types. We found changes in pigmentation that are suggestive of efforts to assist in behavioral fever and hypothermia depending on the intensity of immune challenge. We also found correlations between DNA methylation in liver tissue and pigmentation change along the dorsum, indicating that color transitions may be part of a multifaceted immune response across tissue types. The relationship between immune response and metabolic rate supports the idea that energetic reserves may be conserved for the costs associated with behavioral fever when immune challenge is low and the immune functions when immune challenge is high. While immune response appeared to be unaffected by habitat type, we found differences in metabolic activity between habitats, suggesting differences in the energetic costs associated with each. To our knowledge, these results present the first potential evidence of pigmentation change in ectotherms in association with immune response. The relationship between immune response, DNA methylation, and pigmentation change also highlights the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in organism physiology.\n\nTrade-offs between life history traits are context dependent; they vary depending on environment and life stage. Negative associations between development and growth often characterize larval life stages. Both growth and development consume large parts of the energy budget of young animals. The metabolic rate of animals should reflect differences in growth and developmental rates. Growth and development can also have negative associations with immune function because of their costs. We investigated how intraspecific variation in growth and development affected the metabolism of larval amphibians and whether intraspecific variation in growth, development, and metabolic rate could predict mortality and viral load in larvae infected with ranavirus. We also compared the relationship between growth and development before and after infection with ranavirus. We hypothesized that growth and development would affect metabolism and predicted that each would have a positive correlation with metabolic rate. We further hypothesized that allocation toward growth and development would increase ranavirus susceptibility and therefore predicted that larvae with faster growth, faster development, and higher metabolic rates would be more likely to die from ranavirus and have higher viral loads. Finally, we predicted that growth rate and developmental rate would have a negative association. Intraspecific variation in growth rate and developmental rate did not affect metabolism. Growth rate, developmental rate, and metabolism did not predict mortality from ranavirus or viral load. Larvae infected with ranavirus exhibited a trade-off between developmental rate and growth rate that was absent in uninfected larvae. Our results indicate a cost of ranavirus infection that is potentially due to both the infection-induced anorexia and the cost of infection altering priority rules for resource allocation.\n\nMorphological variation is sometimes used as an indicator of environmental stress in animals. Here, we assessed how multiple morphological traits covaried in Daphnia pulex exposed to five common forms of environmental stress (high temperature, presence of predator cues, high salinity, low food abundance, and low Ca). We measured animal body length, body width, head width, eyespot diameter, and tail spine length along with mass in animals of five different ages (3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 d). There were strong allometric relationships among all morphological traits in reference animals and strong univariate effects of environmental stress on body mass and body length. We found that environmental stressors altered bivariate relationships between select pairwise combinations of morphological traits, with effects being dependent on animal age. Multivariate analyses further revealed high connectivity among body size–related traits but that eyespot diameter and tail spine length were less tightly associated with body size. Animals exposed to natural lake water with and without supplemental food also varied in morphology, with body size differences being suggestive of starvation and other unknown nutritional deficiencies. Yet our results demonstrate that the scaling of body morphological traits of Daphnia pulex is largely invariant with possible context-dependent plasticity in eye size and tail spine lengths. The strong coordination of traits indicates tight molecular coordination of body size during development despite strong and varied environmental stress.\n\nInsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is positively linked with growth and reproduction but negatively linked with survival, so a potential role of IGF-1 in modulating life history trade-offs has been proposed. However, the underlying mechanisms of the negative link between IGF-1 and survival are not yet clear, and oxidative stress has been proposed as a candidate. Immune activation is one important source of oxidative stress, and both immune activation and oxidative stress are known to reduce survival. We experimentally administrated an immune or oxidative insult to Japanese quails to evaluate whether oxidative stress is a proximate cost of holding elevated IGF-1 levels during a life challenge (e.g., infection, intoxication). IGF-1 levels increased in the presence of the immune insult, but they were not affected by the oxidative insult. Hence, IGF-1 may be linked to the survival costs of activating an immune response, but oxidative stress might not be directly involved as an underlying mechanism."
