The film is based on Hasford's 1979 novel The Short-Timers. The film stars Matthew Modine, Lee Ermey, Vincent D'Onofrio and Adam Baldwin.\n\nThe storyline follows a platoon of U.S. Marines through their boot camp training in Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina, primarily focusing on two privates, Joker and Pyle, who struggle under their abusive drill instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman; the second half of the film portrays the experiences of two of the platoon's Marines in Vietnamese cities of Da Nang and Huế during the Tet Offensive of the Vietnam War.[6] The film's title refers to the full metal jacket bullet used by military servicemen.\n\nFull Metal Jacket was theatrically released in the United States on June 26, 1987, by Warner Bros., and in the United Kingdom on September 11, 1987, by Columbia Pictures through Columbia-Cannon-Warner Distributors. The film received critical acclaim, grossed $46.4 million against a budget of $16 million, and earned an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for Kubrick, Herr, and Hasford.[7] In 2001, the American Film Institute placed it at number 95 in their \"AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills\" poll.[8]\n\nPlot[]\n\nDuring the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War, a group of recruits arrive at Parris Island. The ruthless drill instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, employs harsh methods to turn the recruits into combat-ready Marines. Among the recruits is the overweight and dim-witted Leonard Lawrence, whom Hartman nicknames \"Gomer Pyle\", as well as the wisecracking J.T. Davis, who receives the name \"Joker\" after interrupting Hartman's speech with an impression of John Wayne.\n\nWhen Pyle shows ineptitude in basic training, Hartman pairs him with Joker. Under Joker's supervision, Pyle starts to improve, but one day Hartman discovers a jelly doughnut taken from the mess hall in Pyle's footlocker. Blaming the platoon for Pyle's infractions, Hartman adopts a collective punishment policy: he will punish the entire platoon, except for Pyle, for every mistake he makes. One night, the recruits haze Pyle with a blanket party, in which Joker reluctantly participates. Following this, Pyle seems to reinvent himself as a model recruit, showing particular expertise in marksmanship. This pleases Hartman but worries Joker, who believes Pyle may be suffering a mental breakdown after catching Pyle talking to his rifle.\n\nThe recruits graduate and receive their Military Occupational Specialty assignments. Joker is assigned to military journalism, while most of the others—including Pyle—are assigned to Infantry. During the platoon's final night on Parris Island, Joker discovers Pyle in the toilets,[lower-alpha 1] loading his rifle and executing drill commands as he loudly recites the Rifleman's Creed. This awakens the platoon and Hartman, who confronts Pyle and orders him to surrender the rifle. Pyle shoots Hartman dead and appears to be ready to turn on Joker. Joker then calls Pyle by his real name, Leonard, upon which Pyle sits down and commits suicide, while Joker watches in horror.\n\nIn January 1968, Joker—now a sergeant—is a war correspondent in Da Nang for Stars and Stripes alongside Private First Class Rafterman, a combat photographer. Rafterman wants to go into combat, as Joker claims he has. At the Marine base, Joker is mocked for his lack of the thousand-yard stare, indicating his lack of war experience. They are interrupted by the start of the Tet Offensive as the North Vietnamese Army unsuccessfully attempts to overrun the base.\n\nThe following day, the journalism staff is briefed about enemy attacks throughout South Vietnam. Joker is sent to Phu Bai, accompanied by Rafterman. They meet the Lusthog Squad, where Joker is reunited with Sergeant \"Cowboy\", with whom he had gone through boot camp. Joker accompanies the squad during the Battle of Huế,[9] where platoon commander \"Touchdown\" is killed by the enemy. After the Marines declare the area secure, a team of American news journalists and reporters enters Huế to interview various Marines about their experiences in Vietnam and their opinions about the war.\n\nWhile patrolling Huế, Crazy Earl, the squad leader, is killed by a booby trap, leaving Cowboy in command. The squad becomes lost, and Cowboy orders Eightball to scout the area. A Viet Cong sniper wounds Eightball and Doc Jay, the squad Corpsman. Believing that the sniper is drawing the squad into an ambush, Cowboy attempts to radio in tank support to no avail. The squad's machine gunner, Animal Mother, disobeys Cowboy's orders to retreat and attempts to save his comrades. He discovers there is only one sniper, but Doc Jay and Eightball are killed when Doc Jay attempts to indicate the sniper's location. Cowboy then moves the rest of the squad up to an abandoned building for cover. While radioing for support, Cowboy is shot and killed by the sniper.\n\nAnimal Mother assumes command of the squad and leads an attack on the sniper. Joker discovers the sniper, a teenage girl, and attempts to shoot her, but his rifle jams. Rafterman shoots the sniper, mortally wounding her. As the squad converges, the sniper begs the squad to shoot her, prompting an argument about whether to kill her or leave her to suffer. Animal Mother decides to allow a mercy killing only if Joker performs it. After some hesitation, Joker executes her. The Marines congratulate him on his kill as Joker displays the thousand-yard stare. The Marines march toward their camp, singing the \"Mickey Mouse March\". Joker states via narration that despite being \"in a world of shit\", he is glad to be alive and is no longer afraid.\n\nCast[]\n\nMatthew Modine as Private/Sergeant J. T. \"Joker\" Davis, a wise-cracking young recruit. Modine kept a diary on set, which was later adapted into a book in 2005 and eventually an interactive app in 2013.[10]\n\nVincent D'Onofrio as Private Leonard \"Gomer Pyle\" Lawrence, an overweight and slow-minded recruit, who is the subject of Hartman's mockery. D'Onofrio heard of the auditions for the film from Modine. Using a rented video camera and dressed in army fatigues, D'Onofrio recorded his audition. Despite Kubrick saying that Pyle was \"the hardest part to cast in the whole movie\", he quickly responded to D'Onofrio, telling the actor that he had won the part.[11] D'Onofrio was required to gain 70 pounds (32 kg).[12][13]\n\nLee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, the senior drill instructor. Ermey served as a U.S. Marine drill instructor during the Vietnam War and used this experience to ad lib much of his dialogue.[14][15]\n\nAdam Baldwin as Animal Mother, a combat-hungry machine gunner who takes pride in killing enemy soldiers. Arnold Schwarzenegger was first considered for the role, but he turned it down in favor of The Running Man.[16]\n\nArliss Howard as Private/Sergeant \"Cowboy\" Evans, member of the Lusthog Squad and friend of Joker.\n\nKevyn Major Howard as Rafterman, combat photographer.\n\nDorian Harewood as Eightball, a member of the squad.\n\nTim Colceri as Doorgunner, a ruthless helicopter door gunner, who suggests that Joker and Rafterman write a story about him.[17] Colceri, a former Marine, was originally slated to play Hartman, a role which ultimately went to Ermey. Kubrick instead gave Colceri this smaller part as a consolation.[18]\n\nAdditional characters include Ed O'Ross as Lieutenant Walter J. \"Touchdown\" Schinoski, the first platoon leader of the Lusthog Squad; John Terry as Lieutenant Lockhart, the editor of Stars and Stripes; Bruce Boa as POG Colonel, who dresses Joker down for wearing a peace symbol on his lapel. Director Stanley Kubrick and his daughter Vivian make uncredited appearances as two photographers at a Vietnam massacre site.\n\nProduction[]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nKubrick contacted Michael Herr, author of the Vietnam War memoir Dispatches (1977), in the spring of 1980 to discuss working on a film about the Holocaust, but he eventually discarded that in favor of a film about the Vietnam War.[19] They met in England, and the director told Herr that he wanted to do a war film but had yet to find a story to adapt.[11] Kubrick discovered Gustav Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979) while reading the Virginia Kirkus Review.[20] Herr received it in bound galleys and thought that it was a masterpiece.[11] In 1982, Kubrick read the novel twice, concluding that it \"was a unique, absolutely wonderful book\", and decided to adapt it for his next film.[20] According to Kubrick, he was drawn to the book's dialogue, finding it \"almost poetic in its carved-out, stark quality\".[20] In 1983, Kubrick began conducting research for the film, watching archival footage and documentaries, reading Vietnamese newspapers on microfilm from the Library of Congress, and studying hundreds of photographs from the era.[21] Initially, Herr was not interested in revisiting his Vietnam War experiences, and Kubrick spent three years persuading him to participate in what the author describes as \"a single phone call lasting three years, with interruptions\".[19]\n\nIn 1985, Kubrick contacted Hasford and invited him to join the team;[11] he would talk to Hasford on the phone three to four times a week, for hours at a time.[22] Kubrick had already written a detailed treatment,[11] and Kubrick and Herr got together at Kubrick's home every day, breaking down the treatment into scenes. From that, Herr wrote the first draft.[11] The filmmaker was worried that the book's title might be misread by audiences as referring to people who only did half a day's work and changed it to Full Metal Jacket after coming across the phrase in a gun catalogue.[11] After the first draft was completed, Kubrick phoned his orders to Hasford and Herr, and Hasford and Herr mailed their submissions to him.[23] Kubrick read and edited them, and then the team repeated the process. Neither Hasford nor Herr knew how much each had contributed to the screenplay, which ultimately led to a dispute over the final credits.[23] Hasford remembers, \"We were like guys on an assembly line in the car factory. I was putting on one widget and Michael was putting on another widget and Stanley was the only one who knew that this was going to end up being a car.\"[23] Herr says the director was not interested in making an anti-war film, but \"he wanted to show what war is like\".[19]\n\nAt some point, Kubrick wanted to meet Hasford in person, but Herr advised against this, describing The Short-Timers author as a \"scary man\" and believing he and Kubrick would not \"get on\".[19] Nonetheless, Kubrick insisted, and they all met at Kubrick's house in England for dinner. It did not go well, and Hasford did not meet with Kubrick again.[19]\n\nCasting[]\n\nThrough Warner Bros., Kubrick advertised a national casting search in the United States and Canada. The director used videotape to audition actors and received over 3,000 submissions. His staff screened all of the tapes, leaving 800 of them for Kubrick to review personally.[11]:461\n\nFormer U.S. Marine drill instructor Ermey, originally hired as a technical advisor, asked Kubrick if he could audition for the role of Hartman. Kubrick had seen Ermey's portrayal of drill instructor Staff Sergeant Loyce in The Boys in Company C (1978) and told the Marine that he was not vicious enough to play the character. Ermey improvised insulting dialogue against a group of Royal Marines who were being considered for the part of background Marines, to demonstrate his ability to play the character, as well as to show how a drill instructor goes about breaking down the individuality of new recruits.[11]:462 Upon viewing the videotape of these sessions, Kubrick gave Ermey the role, realizing he \"was a genius for this part\".[21] Kubrick also incorporated the 250-page transcript of Ermey's rants into the script.[11]:462–463 Ermey's experience as a drill instructor during the Vietnam era proved invaluable. Kubrick estimated that Ermey wrote 50% of his own dialogue, especially the insults.[24]\n\nWhile Ermey practiced his lines in a rehearsal room, Kubrick's assistant Leon Vitali would throw tennis balls and oranges at him, which Ermey had to catch and throw back as quickly as possible while saying his lines as fast as he could. Any hesitation, slip, or missed line would necessitate starting over. Twenty error-free runs were required. \"[He] was my drill instructor\", Ermey said of Vitali.[11]:463\n\nAfter eight months of negotiations to cast Anthony Michael Hall as Private Joker, a deal between Kubrick and Hall fell through.[25] Kubrick offered Bruce Willis a role which the actor turned down due to filming commitments to his TV series Moonlighting.[26]\n\nFilming[]\n\nKubrick shot the film in England from 1985 to 1986: In Cambridgeshire, on the Norfolk Broads, and at the former Millennium Mills, Beckton Gas Works, Newham (east London) and the Isle of Dogs.[27] A former Royal Air Force station and then British Army base, Bassingbourn Barracks, doubled as the Parris Island Marine boot camp.[21] A British Army rifle range near Barton, outside Cambridge, was used in the scene where Hartman congratulates Private Pyle for his shooting skills. Kubrick worked from still photographs of Huế taken in 1968, and found an area owned by British Gas that closely resembled it and was scheduled to be demolished. The disused Beckton Gas Works, a few miles from central London, were filmed to represent Huế after attacks.[24] Kubrick had buildings blown up, and the film's art director used a wrecking ball to knock specific holes in certain buildings over the course of two months.[24] Originally, Kubrick had a plastic replica jungle flown in from California, but once he looked at it he reportedly said, \"I don't like it. Get rid of it\".[28] The open country was filmed in the Cliffe marshes,[29] and along the River Thames, supplemented with 200 imported Spanish palm trees[20] and 100,000 plastic tropical plants from Hong Kong.[24]\n\nKubrick acquired four M41 tanks from a Belgian army colonel, who was an admirer of the director's work,[30] and Westland Wessex helicopters painted Marine green to represent Marine Corps Sikorsky H-34 Choctaw helicopters. Although the Wessex was a licensed derivative of the Sikorsky H-34, the Wessex substituted two gas turbine engines for the H-34's radial (piston) engine. This resulted in a much longer and less rounded nose than that of the Vietnam era H-34. Kubrick obtained a selection of rifles, M79 grenade launchers, and M60 machine guns from a licensed weapons dealer.[21]\n\nModine described the shoot as difficult: Beckton Gas Works was a toxic and environmental nightmare for the entire film crew. Asbestos and hundreds of other chemicals poisoned the ground and air. Modine documents details of shooting at Beckton in his book, Full Metal Jacket Diary (2005). During the boot camp sequence of the film, Modine and the other recruits had to endure the rigors of Marine Corps training, including having Ermey yell at them for 10 hours a day during the shooting of the Parris Island scenes. To ensure the actors' reactions to Ermey' lines were as authentic and fresh as possible, Ermey and the recruits did not rehearse together.[11]:468 For film continuity, each recruit had to have his head shaved once a week.[31]\n\nAt one point during filming, Ermey had a car accident, in which he broke all of his ribs on one side, and was out for four and a half months.[24]\n\nCowboy's death scene shows a building in the background that resembles the famous alien monolith in Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Kubrick described the resemblance as an \"extraordinary accident\".[24]\n\nDuring filming, Hasford contemplated taking legal action over the writing credits. Originally, the filmmakers intended for Hasford to receive an \"additional dialogue\" credit, but he fought for and eventually received full credit.[23] The writer took two friends and visited the set dressed as extras, only to be mistaken by a crew member for Herr, when Hasford identified himself as the writer whose work the film was based on.[22]\n\nKubrick's daughter Vivian—who appears uncredited as a news-camera operator at the mass grave—shadowed the filming of Full Metal Jacket. She shot 18 hours of behind-the-scenes footage for a potential \"making-of\" documentary similar to her earlier film documentary on Kubrick's The Shining (1980), but in this case did not make the film. Snippets of her work can be seen in the documentary Stanley Kubrick's Boxes (2008).\n\nThemes[]\n\nCompared to Kubrick's other works, the themes of Full Metal Jacket have received little attention from critics and reviewers.[citation needed] Michael Pursell's essay \"Full Metal Jacket: The Unravelling of Patriarchy\" (1988) was an early, in-depth consideration of the film's two-part structure and its criticism of masculinity, arguing that the film shows \"war and pornography as facets of the same system\".[32]\n\nMost reviews have focused on military brainwashing themes in the boot camp section of the film, while seeing the latter half of the film as more confusing and disjointed in content. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote, \"it's as if they borrowed bits of every war movie to make this eclectic finale.\"[33] Roger Ebert saw in the film an attempt to tell a story of individual characters and how the war affected them, but the result was a shapeless film, which feels \"more like a book of short stories than a novel\".[34] Julian Rice, in his book Kubrick's Hope (2008), saw the second part of the film as continuing the psychic journey of Joker in trying to come to grips with human evil.[35]\n\nTony Lucia, in his 1987 review of Full Metal Jacket for the Reading Eagle, looked at the themes of Kubrick's career, suggesting \"the unifying element may be the ordinary man dwarfed by situations too vast and imposing to handle\". Lucia specifically refers to the \"military mentality\" in this film. He said further that the theme covered \"a man testing himself against his own limitations\", and concluded: \"Full Metal Jacket is the latest chapter in an ongoing movie which is not merely a comment on our time or a time past, but on something that reaches beyond.\"[36]\n\nBritish critic Gilbert Adair wrote: \"Kubrick's approach to language has always been reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic in nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all the whims, shades and modulations of personal expression\".\n\nMichael Herr wrote of his work on the screenplay: \"The substance was single-minded, the old and always serious problem of how you put into a film or a book the living, behaving presence of what Jung called The Shadow, the most accessible of archetypes, and the easiest to experience ... War is the ultimate field of Shadow-activity, where all of its other activities lead you. As they expressed it in Vietnam, 'Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil, for I am the Evil'.\"\n\nMusic[]\n\nKubrick's daughter Vivian Kubrick, under the alias \"Abigail Mead\", wrote the film's score. According to an interview in the January 1988 issue of Keyboard, the film was scored mostly with a Fairlight CMI synthesizer (the then-current Series III edition) and a Synclavier. For the period music, Kubrick went through Billboard's list of Top 100 Hits for each year from 1962 to 1968 and tried many songs, but \"sometimes the dynamic range of the music was too great, and we couldn't work in dialogue\".[24]\n\nJohnnie Wright – \"Hello Vietnam\"\n\nThe Dixie Cups – \"Chapel of Love\"\n\nSam the Sham & The Pharaohs – \"Wooly Bully\"\n\nChris Kenner – \"I Like It Like That\"\n\nNancy Sinatra – \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\"\n\nThe Trashmen – \"Surfin' Bird\"\n\nGoldman Band – \"Marines' Hymn\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones – \"Paint It Black\"\n\nA single \"Full Metal Jacket (I Wanna Be Your Drill Instructor)\", credited to Mead and Nigel Goulding, was released to promote the film. It incorporates Ermey's drill cadences from the film. The single reached number two in the UK singles chart.[39]\n\nRelease[]\n\nBox office[]\n\nFull Metal Jacket received a limited release on June 26, 1987, in 215 theaters.[4] Its opening weekend saw it accrue $2,217,307, an average of $10,313 per theater, ranking it the number 10 film for the June 26–28 weekend.[4] It took a further $2,002,890 for a total of $5,655,225 before entering wide release on July 10, 1987, at 881 theaters—an increase of 666.[4] The July 10–12 weekend saw the film gross $6,079,963, an average of $6,901 per theater, and rank as the number 2 grossing film. Over the next four weeks the film opened in a further 194 theaters to its widest release of 1,075 theaters before closing two weeks later with a total gross of $46,357,676, making it the number 23 highest-grossing film of 1987.[4][40] As of 1998 , the film had grossed $120 million worldwide.[5]\n\nHome media[]\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray on October 23, 2007.[41] Warner Home Video released the 25th anniversary edition on Blu-ray on August 7, 2012.[42]\n\nWarners released the film on 4K Ultra HD on September 21, 2020 in the UK, and September 22 in the US.[43] Other regions are slated for an October release. The 4K UHD release uses a new HDR remastered native 2160p transfer from the original 35mm negative, which was supervised by Kubrick's personal assistant Leon Vitali. It contains the remixed audio and, for the first time since the original DVD release, the theatrical mono mix. It was a critical success with publications praising image and audio quality, calling the former exceptionally good and faithful to the original theatrical release and Kubrick's vision, while noting the lack of new extras and bonus content.[44][45][46] A special collector's edition box set of this 4K UHD version was released with different cover art, a replica theatrical poster of the film, a letter from director Stanley Kubrick, and a booklet about the film's production among other extras.[47]\n\nCritical reception[]\n\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected reviews to give the film a score of 92% based on reviews from 83 critics and an average rating of 8.30/10. The summary states, \"Intense, tightly constructed, and darkly comic at times, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket may not boast the most original of themes, but it is exceedingly effective at communicating them.\"[48][49] Another aggregator Metacritic gave it a score of 76 out of 100, which indicates a \"generally favorable\" response, based on 19 reviews.[50] Reviewers generally reacted favorably to the cast, Ermey in particular,[51][52] and the film's first act in recruit training,[53][54] but several reviews were critical of the latter part of the film set in Vietnam and what was considered a \"muddled\" moral message in the finale.[55][34]\n\nRichard Corliss of Time called the film a \"technical knockout\", praising \"the dialogue's wild, desperate wit; the daring in choosing a desultory skirmish to make a point about war's pointlessness\", and \"the fine, large performances of almost every actor\", believing, at the time, that Ermey and D'Onofrio would receive Oscar nominations. Corliss appreciated \"the Olympian elegance and precision of Kubrick's filmmaking\".[51] Empire's Ian Nathan awarded the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying it is \"inconsistent\" and describing it as \"both powerful and frustratingly unengaged\". Nathan felt that after the opening act, which focuses on the recruit training, the film becomes \"bereft of purpose\"; nevertheless, he summarized his review by calling it a \"hardy Kubrickian effort that warms on you with repeated viewings\" and praised Ermey's \"staggering performance\".[54] Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film \"harrowing, beautiful and characteristically eccentric\". Canby echoed praise for Ermey, calling him \"the film's stunning surprise ... he's so good—so obsessed—that you might think he wrote his own lines\". Canby said D'Onofrio's performance should be admired and described Modine as \"one of the best, most adaptable young film actors of his generation\". Canby concluded that Full Metal Jacket was \"a film of immense and very rare imagination\".[56]\n\nJim Hall, writing for Film4 in 2010, awarded the film 5 out of 5 stars and added to the praise for Ermey, saying his \"performance as the foul-mouthed Hartman is justly celebrated and it's difficult to imagine the film working anything like as effectively without him\". The review preferred the opening training to the later Vietnam sequence, calling it \"far more striking than the second and longer section\". Film4 commented that the film ends abruptly but felt \"it demonstrates just how clear and precise the director's vision could be when he resisted a fatal tendency for indulgence\". Film4 concluded: \"Full Metal Jacket ranks with Dr. Strangelove as one of Kubrick's very best.\"[53] Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader called it \"Elliptical, full of subtle inner rhymes … and profoundly moving, this is the most tightly crafted Kubrick film since Dr. Strangelove, as well as the most horrific.\"[57] Variety called the film an \"intense, schematic, superbly made\" drama \"loaded with vivid, outrageously vulgar military vernacular that contributes heavily to the film's power\", but felt that it never develops \"a particularly strong narrative.\" The cast performances were all labeled \"exceptional\" with Modine being singled out as \"embodying both what it takes to survive in the war and a certain omniscience.\"[52] Gilbert Adair, writing in a review for Full Metal Jacket, commented that \"Kubrick's approach to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression\".\n\nNot all reviews were positive. Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert held a dissenting view, calling the film \"strangely shapeless\" and awarding it 2.5 stars out of 4. Ebert called it \"one of the best-looking war movies ever made on sets and stage\", but felt this was not enough to compete with the \"awesome reality of Platoon, Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter.\" Ebert criticized the film's second act set in Vietnam, saying the \"movie disintegrates into a series of self-contained set pieces, none of them quite satisfying\" and concluded that the film's message was \"too little and too late\", having been done by other Vietnam War films. Ebert gave praise to Ermey and D'Onofrio, saying \"these are the two best performances in the movie, which never recovers after they leave the scene.\"[34] This review angered Gene Siskel on their television show At The Movies; he criticized Ebert for liking Benji the Hunted (which came out the same week) more than Full Metal Jacket.[59] Their difference in opinion was parodied on the television show The Critic, where Siskel taunts Ebert with \"coming from the guy who liked Benji the Hunted!\"[60] Time Out London disliked the film saying \"Kubrick's direction is as steely cold and manipulative as the régime it depicts\", and felt that the characters were underdeveloped, adding \"we never really get to know, let alone care about, the hapless recruits on view.\"[55]\n\nBritish television channel Channel 4 voted Full Metal Jacket number 5 on its list of the greatest war films ever made.[61] In 2008, Empire placed the film at number 457 on its list of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.[62] The film ranked 95 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years... 100 Thrills list, published in 2001.[63]\n\nAccolades[]\n\nFull Metal Jacket was nominated for 11 awards worldwide between 1987 and 1989 including an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay,[64][65] two BAFTA Awards for Best Sound and Best Special Effects,[66] and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for Ermey.[67] It won five awards, three of which were from outside of the United States (Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom): Best Foreign Language Film from the Japanese Academy, Best Producer from the Academy of Italian Cinema,[68] Director of the Year at the London Critics Circle Film Awards, and Best Director and Best Supporting Actor at the Boston Society of Film Critics Awards, for Kubrick and Ermey respectively.[69] Of the five awards won, four were awarded to Kubrick.\n\nYear Award Category Recipient Result Ref. 1987 BAFTA Awards Best Sound Nigel Galt, Edward Tise and Andy Nelson Nominated [66] Best Special Effects John Evans Nominated [66] 1988 60th Academy Awards Best Adapted Screenplay Stanley Kubrick, Michael Herr and Gustav Hasford Nominated [64][65] Boston Society of Film Critics Awards Best Director Stanley Kubrick Won [69] Best Supporting Actor R.

The novel is in three parts. The film greatly expands the relatively brief section in Part I, about the boot camp on Parris Island, and essentially discards Part III. This gives the film a twofold structure, telling two largely independent stories connected by the same characters acting in each. Jenkins believes this structure is a development of concepts that Kubrick originally discussed back in the 1960s. At that time, Kubrick talked about wanting to explode the usual conventions of narrative structure.\n\nSergeant Hartman (renamed from the book's Gerheim) has an expanded role in the film. Private Pyle's incompetence is presented as weighing negatively on the rest of the platoon and, unlike the novel, he is the only under-performing recruit. The film omits \"Hartman's\" disclosure to other troops that he thinks Pyle might be mentally unstable, a \"Section 8\"; instead it is Joker who questions Pyle's mental state in the scene where he mops the latrines with Cowboy. In contrast, Hartman praises Pyle, saying that he is \"born again hard\". Jenkins says that the character of Hartman could not have been portrayed as having a warmer social relationship with the troops, as that would have upset the balance of the film, which depends on the spectacle of ordinary soldiers coming to grips with Hartman as a force of nature embodying a killer culture.\n\nVarious episodes in the book have been cut from the screenplay or conflated with others. For example, Cowboy's introduction of the \"Lusthog Squad\" has been both markedly shortened and supplemented by material from other sections of the book. Although the book's final, third section was largely dropped, elements from this section were inserted into other episodes of the film. For instance, the climactic episode with the sniper is a conflation of two episodes in the book, from Parts II and III. Jenkins thinks the film presents this passage more dramatically but in less gruesome detail than in the novel.\n\nThe film often has a more tragic tone than the book, which relies on callous humor. Joker in the film remains a model of humane thinking, as evidenced by his moral struggle in the sniper episode and elsewhere. He works to overcome his own meekness, rather than compete with other Marines. The film omits the Joker's eventual domination over Animal Mother shown in the book.\n\nThe film also omits the death of the character Rafterman. Jenkins believed this allowed viewers to reflect on Rafterman's personal growth in the film and speculate on his future growth after the war.\n\nIn popular culture[]\n\nThe line of dialogue \"Me so horny. Me love you long time,\" uttered by the Da Nang street prostitute (played by Papillon Soo Soo) to Joker (Modine) became a catchphrase in popular culture[75][76] after it was sampled by rap artists 2 Live Crew in their 1990 hit \"Me So Horny\" and by Sir Mix-A-Lot in \"Baby Got Back\" (1992).[77][78]\n\nSee also[]\n\nPaths of Glory\n\nProject 100,000\n\nVietnam War in film\n\nBattle of Huế\n\nReferences[]\n\nBibliography[]\n\nJenkins, Greg (1997).
