Bunin was born in Central Russia and was always proud of his Polish Ancestry. His father was strong, quick-tempered and addicted to gambling while mother was subtle, tender and civilized.

From childhood, Bunin was sensitive and susceptible to the fine nuances of nature. A dark night, sweet scent of the flowers and beauty of rustic Russian life would mesmerize him to no end. In fact, he described his childhood as melancholic poetry. His father lost sizable wealth to gambling and the family was plagued with financial hardship. Bunin could not complete his schooling and had to take odd jobs in 1889 such as Govt. Clerk, editor of a local newspaper, librarian and court statistician etc.
