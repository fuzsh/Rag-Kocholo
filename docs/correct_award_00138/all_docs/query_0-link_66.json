        "text": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A seminar on literature was organised here by the Russian Cultural Centre to mark the 145th birth anniversary of Ivan Bunin, the author of works like ‘Dry Valley’ and ‘The Village’. He was the first Russian to win the Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nLike other Russian writers who loved their motherland, Ivan was influenced by the village life of his childhood, writer Prof Maheswaran Nair, who inaugurated the literary seminar, said. “ He was not a writer who supported the rulers. But Bunin was aware about the policy of the rulers in promoting literature in Russia. For example, Alexander Pushkin was a Decembrist, but he had the freedom to write. All well known writers in Russia could produce their master works during Tsarist Russia,” Maheswaran Nair said.\n\n“ Bunin never supported the ideas of the Bolsheviks. He had to leave Russia and was forced to live in Europe. But in the later stage of his life Bunin wanted to return to Russia,” said Maheswaran Nair said.\n\nBunin won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1933, but by then he had left Russia which had come under Communist rule and settled in France. The announcement of the Nobel Prize was a cause for celebration for the Russian expatriates in France, but in Soviet Russia it was termed an imperialist intrigue.\n\nPresiding over the function, honorary consul of Russia, Ratheesh C Nair, said that only a few genuine Russian writers have received the Nobel Prize. “ Geo-political aspects should not be considered when a writer is chosen for awards. Many writers in Russia deserve and deserved Nobel prize for literature,” he said. V R Ajith Kumar, deputy director, Information and Public Relations Department, delivered the key note address. M S Jayakumar welcomed the gathering."
