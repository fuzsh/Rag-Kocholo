        "text": "This volume of selected poems and short stories of Ivan Bunin (1870-1953) is representative of the work he did over a period of more than fifty years. Included are his first published poems (1887-1890), the short stories Apple Fragrance (1900) and The Village (1909-1910) which earned him the fame of a major Russian writer; the autobiographical stories Love (1924) and Lika (1933-1938) from his novel The Life of Arseniev, written while he was living abroad; the cycle of stories Shadowed Paths, and his poetic cycles dated 1940-1950.\n\nIvan Alekseyevich Bunin (Russian: Иван Алексеевич Бунин) was the first Russian writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. He was noted for the strict artistry with which he carried on the classical Russian traditions in the writing of prose and poetry. The texture of his poems and stories, sometimes referred to as \"Bunin brocade\", is considered to be one of the richest in the language.\n\nBest known for his short novels The Village (1910) and Dry Valley (1912), his autobiographical novel The Life of Arseniev (1933, 1939), the book of short stories Dark Avenues (1946) and his 1917–1918 diary ( Cursed Days, 1926), Bunin was a revered figure among anti-communist White emigres, European critics, and many of his fellow writers, who viewed him as a true heir to the tradition of realism in Russian literature established by Leo Tolstoy and Anton Chekhov.\n\nHe died November 8, 1953 in Paris."
