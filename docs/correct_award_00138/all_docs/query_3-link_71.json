        "text": "”The Gentleman from San Francisco” is easily the best known of Ivan Bunin's stories and has achieved the stature of a masterpiece. But Bunin's other stories are not to be missed. In Sunstroke, Graham Hettlinger has selected the “Gentleman” and twenty-four other stories and translated them afresh—several for the first time in English. The result is a collection that is remarkable in its crystalline prose, surprising in its vibrancy. It includes, among others, “Raven,” “Cold Fall,” “Muza,” “Styopa,” “Antigone,” ”In Paris,” and “Late Hour.” Never has the last of the great “gentry” writers and the first Russian to win the Nobel Prize for Literature received a more caring and passionate translation. Sunstroke confirms Bunin's stature as one of the greatest—and most neglected—Russian writers of the twentieth century.\n\nIvan R. Dee\n\nPages: 206  Trim: 5¾ x 8¾\n\n978-1-56663-426-7 • Hardback • January 2002 • $29.95 • (£25.00)\n\nIvan Bunin (1870–1953) was regarded by many of his contemporaries as the rightful successor to Tolstoy and Chekhov as a master of Russian letters. He won the Nobel Prize in 1933. Graham Hettlinger lives in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nPart 1 Acknowledgements ix\n\nPart 2 Introduction xi\n\nPart 3 Sunstroke 3\n\nPart 4 Summer Day 13\n\nPart 5 Raven 15\n\nPart 6 Sky Above a Wall 23\n\nPart 7 Ida 25\n\nPart 8 Cranes 36\n\nPart 9 Caucasus 38\n\nPart 10 The Hunchback's Affair 44\n\nPart 11 Ballad 46\n\nPart 12 First Class 54\n\nPart 13 Cold Fall 56\n\nPart 14 Calf's Head 62\n\nPart 15 The Gentleman from San Francisco 64\n\nPart 16 Little Fool 91\n\nPart 17 Muza 94\n\nPart 18 Old Woman 103\n\nPart 19 Rusya 105\n\nPart 20 Old and Young 118\n\nPart 21 Styopa 123\n\nPart 22 On One Familiar Street 130\n\nPart 23 Antigone 133\n\nPart 24 Zoyka and Valeriya 144\n\nPart 25 In Paris 160\n\nPart 26 The Eve 173\n\nPart 27 Late Hour 175\n\nPart 28 Notes 183\n\nBunin displays a painterly eye for detail. He is a master at capturing the moment.\n\n— Publishers Weekly\n\nThe plots of Bunin's stories are not necessarily original, but their force and animation never fail to surprise.\n\n— Library Journal\n\nVibrant...a fine introduction to Bunin's work and a reminder of its importance.\n\n— New York Sun\n\nGraham Hettlinger's new translation...gives us a Bunin startling in his vividness, sensuality, and restraint.\n\n— Virginia Quarterly Review\n\nBunin is, unaccountably, the least translated of the great Russian writers (and his best work ranks with that of Turgenev and Chekov). This splendid volume takes an important step towards righting a long-standing wrong.\n\n— Kirkus Reviews\n\nA gifted new translation of Bunin's remarkable stories"
