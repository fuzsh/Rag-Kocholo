        "text": "Today we note the birth date of Ivan Alekseyevich Bunin (October 22, 1870 – November 8, 1953), first Russian writer awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. He was noted for the strict artistry with which he carried on the classical Russian traditions in the writing of prose and poetry.\n\nThe texture of his poems and stories, sometimes referred to as \"Bunin brocade\", is considered to be one of the richest in the language. He is best known for his short novels The Village (1910) and Dry Valley (1912), his autobiographical novel The Life of Arseniev (1933, 1939), the book of short stories Dark Avenues (1946) and his 1917–1918 diary (Cursed Days, 1926).\n\nHere is one of his poems for your consideration:\n\nThe Pleiades\n\nIt's dark. Not caring where I go, which path I follow\n\nPast sleepy ponds I stroll.\n\nOf autumn freshness, leaves and fruit the fragrance mellow\n\nDrifts over all.\n\nThe garden's almost bare, and through the branches whitely\n\nThe stars of evening show.\n\nDead silence reigns. Murk clothes the paths. It's nighttime.\n\nMy steps are slow.\n\nThey're slow, but wake the hush… High in the sky's cool\n\ndarkness,\n\nA princely diadem,\n\nThe icy Pleiades blaze diamond-like and sparkle,\n\nEach one a gem.\n\n--Ivan Alekseyevich Bunin"
