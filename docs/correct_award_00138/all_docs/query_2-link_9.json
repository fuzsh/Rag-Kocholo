        "text": "Richard Davies, Archivist, Leeds Russian Archive, writes:\n\nThe Leeds Russian Archive‘s most important literary collection is the triple archive of Ivan Bunin (1870-1953), the first Russian writer to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature (1933), his wife, Vera Muromtseva-Bunina (1881-1961), and their heir, also a Russian émigré writer, Leonid Zurov (1902-1971).\n\nNovember and December 2023 see four significant Bunin anniversaries, which are being marked in different ways in Russia and the global Russian-speaking diaspora.\n\nBunin died in Paris 70 years ago, on 8 November 1953.\n\n90 years ago, on 9 November 1933, Bunin was watching a film in the cinema in Grasse on the Côte d’Azur, when Leonid Zurov searched him out to tell him that Stockholm was on the phone.\n\nOn 10 December 1933, in the traditional ceremony in Stockholm, King Gustav V presented Bunin with his Nobel Prize certificate and medal, which have become prize items in the Leeds Russian Archive’s holdings, and a cheque for 170,331 Swedish Crowns.\n\nFinally, midnight on 31 December 2023 sees the end of the 70-year period of copyright protection that Bunin’s published works have enjoyed outside Russia since his death. From 1 January 2024 they enter the public domain. This represents a major change for the Bunin literary estate, which has been owned since 2000 by the University of Leeds and administered by the University Library on behalf of the University and a private beneficiary.\n\nAs a citizen of the Russian Empire and then an émigré in France, Bunin’s copyright status was never straightforward. Neither the Russian Empire, nor the Soviet Union joined the Berne Convention, which granted copyright protection to citizens of signatory countries. So in his first years in exile Bunin’s works could be published in the West without royalties being paid, but he could not collect royalties for his works published in the Soviet Union. It was only when being a long term French resident entitled him to the same protection enjoyed by French citizens, and particularly after receiving the Nobel Prize, that his situation in the Western publishing market improved."
