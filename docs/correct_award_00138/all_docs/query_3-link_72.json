        "text": "1.\n\nThe rain and the wind and the murk\n\nReign over cold desert of fall,\n\nHere, life's interrupted till spring;\n\nTill the spring, gardens barren and tall.\n\n...\n\n2.\n\nNovember. Midnight damp. Chalk-white beneath\n\nThe moon the village lies, by the oppressive\n\nHush overcome. The tide sweeps in, impassive,\n\nIts voice all deep solemnity and breadth.\n\n...\n\nA crackling fire. Light, heat in the felucca.\n\nPikes in the water. Pearl-white sand below.\n\nThe trident now! You'll get one if you're lucky.\n\nGo slow, don't rush. A blow! Another blow!\n\n...\n\n4.\n\nBlasting the malachites beneath the rudder,\n\nThe seething sea spews pearly blobs of foam.\n\nThe shore sails nearer as we move from under\n\nThe ship's smooth, towering shape and make for home.\n\n...\n\n5.\n\n'Who knocks? I won't get up. I will not open\n\nThe spray-soaked door of this old hut. How chill\n\nAnd how uneasy are the nights of autumn!\n\nAnd yet its dawns are more uneasy still.'\n\n...\n\n6.\n\nA whip cracks in the wood, and cattle low\n\nAnd through the underbrush are heard to\n\nCrash heavily. Leaves rustle. Snowdrops show\n\nTheir blue heads here and there. A sudden, furtive\n\n...\n\n7.\n\nIt's dark. Not caring where I go, which path I follow,\n\nPast sleepy ponds I stroll.\n\nOf autumn freshness, leaves and fruit the fragrance mellow\n\nDrifts over all.\n\n...\n\nDead grasses parched by heat. The steppeland, seared,\n\nRuns on and merges with the sky's pale reaches.\n\nHere is a horse's sun-bleached skull, and here\n\nAn idol with its flat, stone features.\n\n...\n\n9.\n\nStarved, mangy dogs with mournful, pleading eyes,\n\nDescendants of the ones that in a bygone\n\nAge from the steppeland came, and, stung by flies,\n\nDragged in the wake of dusty, creaking wagons.\n\n...\n\n10.\n\nDream on! Your golden eyes turn narrower\n\nAnd duller as you watch the snowflakes clinging\n\nTo window frames, and hear the blizzard singing\n\nOut in the yard where poplars groan, astir.\n\n...\n\nAs in a boundless sea in darkening fields and meadows\n\nThe sunset's tristful rays fade and then sink from sight,\n\nAnd in mute twilights wake, over the steppe the shadows\n\nCreep swiftly, bringing night.\n\n...\n\nNo birds in sight. The forest withers slowly,\n\nResigned to utter emptiness and chill.\n\nNo mushrooms, but there comes from out a gully\n\nOf mushroom damp the strong and tangy smell.\n\n...\n\n13.\n\nThe Dead Sea, and, beyond, the greyish, broken\n\nLine of the hills. Noon. Mealtime. Deft of hand,\n\nHe bathes his mare, then sits a hookah smoking\n\nOn Jordan's shore. Like molten bronze the sand\n\n...\n\n14.\n\nLike copper shone the autumn day. Poseidon\n\nAnd Aeolus moaned softly, mournfully.\n\nHuge, surging, lilac waves rose on the sea.\n\nOur ship dove fish-like in and out among them.\n\n...\n\nSewn with gold is your sable-black jerkin of velvet,\n\nLoud your hum as you boldly fly into my room.\n\nWhy, O bumblebee, drone you so mournfully, tell me?\n\nWould you share my dejection and gloom?\n\n...\n\nWarmth and light, buzzing bumblebees, wheat ears and grasses,\n\nAzure skies - of high summer the birth…\n\nTo his prodigal son will the Lord say: 'Confess, pray -\n\nHave you known true contentment on earth?'\n\n...\n\n17.\n\n\"She passed away, and was interred by Jacob\n\nBeside the road…\" And on the tomb, no sight\n\nOf any name, inscription and no mark up.\n\n...\n\nThe camel snorts. He won't get up. .\n\nHis grumbling flanks are heaving. Give him\n\nA kick?.. The criers' calls atop\n\nThe mosques dawn's sleepy streets enliven.\n\n..."
