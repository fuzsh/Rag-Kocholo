        "text": "March 23, 2016\n\nIntroduction\n\n--The Gentleman from San Francisco\n\n--The Primer of Love\n\n--Chang's Dreams\n\n--Temir-Aksak-Khan\n\n--Long Ago\n\n--An Unknown Friend\n\n--At Sea, at Night\n\n--Graffiti\n\n--Mitya's Love\n\n--Sunstroke\n\n--Night\n\n--The Caucasus\n\n--Late Hour\n\n--Visiting Cards\n\n--Zoyka and Valeria\n\n--The Riverside Tavern\n\n--A Cold Autumn\n\nOctober 1, 2009\n\nIvan Bunin (1870-1953) is one of Russia's most overlooked writers. The stories are set in Russia, parts of Europe and France, where the author lived the last 30 years of his life. The pieces are really extraordinary in that they are about ordinary people who are brought to life in very colorful ways. The language is rich and detailed, sensuous, and reads like poetry. Nobel prize for 1933 and 1st Russian to win it.\n\nNovember 23, 2013\n\nIvan Bunin was the odd man out of Russian letters the early nineteenth century -- in a highly factionalized literary world, he stood by himself, or rather, in what he saw as the grand tradition of realists, not in the revolutionary vein of Gorky's but instead that of Tolstoy. Yet he clearly lacked Tolstoy's grand vision; what this volume reveals him to be, concerned mostly with the Russian countryside and failed love, is a Chekhov but without the exploration of how people interact and affect each other. Bunin is interested in strong emotion, principally romance, but not necessarily the people who experience them. The most famous of his characters, the gentleman from San Francisco, never receives so much as a name and is less well detailed than a couple who appear on the last page--dancers hired to pose as lovers on the voyage he fails to complete. His death is just the most extreme example of how nothing in Bunin endures: romance, affairs, great estates, families. The strongest of these pieces is \"Sukhodol\", which takes place on the kind of decaying estate that supplied Bunin's friend Chekhov with so much material for his desperate, bored characters, although the people in Sukhodol live decades before the three sisters. Like many of the great novelists of the early twentieth century -- Joyce, Proust and Faulkner come to mind -- the effect of the passage of time is one of Bunin's great themes. But each of those writers gave us unforgettable characters who suffer the effects of its passage. If Bunin had been as interested in people as they were he might have stood with them.\n\nJune 5, 2022\n\nDen russiske nobelpristager Ivan Bunin byder på novellekunst af den fineste slags. I nogle stræk kan hans små melankolske fortællinger om døden og den flygtige, erotiske kærlighed måske nok forekomme en anelse bedagede, men han er en uovertruffen stilist og så absolut læseværdig også i dag.\n\nLæs hele min anmeldelse på K’s bognoter: https://bognoter.dk/2022/02/16/ivan-b...\n\nDecember 14, 2018\n\nNot sure if this is the edition I read, but probably they have most of the same stories. I find Bunin to be a captivating author in the Russian tradition. Compared to the others, what makes Bunin stand out is his visual sense. Of course Turgenev and other Russians have great pictorial power too, but Bunin's words really leap off this page with astonishing beauty. \"The Gentleman from San Francisco\" is the clearest example of this. It's a visual feast from end to end.\n\nOn the other hand, I sometimes feel Bunin stresses these visual aspects because he has less of a handle on the social/emotional aspects. Not that he fails here, but there is sometimes a sense that the characters and plot are an excuse for the atmosphere and images, rather than equal partners. It's hard for me to hold that against him, however.\n\nI would say these stories should be pretty easy to pick up and enjoy, something I encourage everyone to do.\n\nFebruary 25, 2022\n\nIl signore di San Francisco di Ivan Bunin (Adelphi edizioni) è una raccolta di racconti coinvolgente e di grande valore. Io di Bunin avevo già letto e amato Giorni maledetti, edito da Voland (TROVATE QUI la mia recensione). Il signore di San Francisco è completamente diverso da Giorni maledetti che è un diario.\n\nIl signore di San Francisco è una raccolta di quindici racconti, alcuni mi hanno rapito, altri mi hanno lasciata tiepida. Ciò che ho amato di più di Bunin è proprio la penna. Malinconia, ricchezza e miseria si mescolano in questa raccolta di livello altissimo. Questi componimenti, tutti scritti prima del 1915.\n\nIl signore di San Francisco è forse il racconto che mi è piaciuto di più, a convincermi è bastato l’incipit.\n\nRECENSIONE COMPLETA: https://www.lalettricecontrocorrente....\n\nJuly 31, 2014\n\nExcellent book! Even more surprisingly this is an easy read - not a phrase commonly used to describe Russian writers' books.\n\nBunin has an incredible talent for making normal people and events seem extraordinary. The Gentleman from San Francisco is a brilliant story. I was captivated the entire time, and I even found myself laughing in certain parts. The rest of the book was just as fun to read.\n\nRussian writers have never been my favorite, but Bunin reads more like a British writer than his Russian contemporaries. However, after reading this book I'm searching out more of his works through the library. I can't wait to read more things he has written.\n\nThis was a great palate cleanser coming off of a disappointing book. It took me less than 24 hours to read the entire thing, and I didn't want to put it down until it was finished.\n\nMarch 21, 2021\n\nBunin is the greatest Russian author you've probably never heard of -- I somehow hadn't stumbled across this guy until last month.\n\nVery reminiscent of Chekhov, but not in a derivative way. The style is similar enough to be noteworthy -- especially the descriptions of nature -- but Bunin is doing his own thing, not as light/airy/playful as Chekhov, a bit more 'serious', lyrical, parable-esque, and also covering the full range of human experience (vs. Chekhov).\n\nAnyway, he's just so insanely good -- among Russian authors, I'd say only Tolstoy and Chekhov at their absolute best (like 30% of W&P/Karenina and Chekhov's best few stories) are better. I saw a critic refer to Bunin as \"Nabokov with a heart\" -- which, sure -- but he's also just better than Nabokov. Very highly recommended.\n\nJune 8, 2023\n\nShorts on human fragility and transience.\n\nRead\n\nJanuary 29, 2024\n\nCentury Reading Project 1922\n\nThe Wolffs’ Hogarth Press edition, short at 86 pages.\n\nApril 7, 2023\n\nBunin’s name pops up in my readings. He was the first Russian to win a Nobel Prize for Literature while in exile in France. I finally got around to reading this compilation of short stories focused on the good days for the country gentry before the Revolution. He muses on human existence, love, sex and death. I understand he had a way with the Russian language which is presumably lost in translation.\n\nJanuary 16, 2013\n\nAs I read the stories I became increasingly convinced that Bunin had been influenced by Buddhism. Most of the stories had very little plot, no great dialogues, they were rather sketches of a fleeting encounter, or an affair or a nostalgic recollection that echoed the fragility of our joys and existence. The title story itself sets the tone from the beginning - an American gentleman, holidaying in Italy with his family, meets with an unexpected end. The whole episode is narrated with almost ironic glee by the author. The dead man goes back by the same ship, 'hidden from the living: in a tarred coffin' and on board goes on the same chandelier-lit, festive ball.\n\nThe standout piece is 'Mitya's Love', the longest story in the book. Only in this story, there is a well developed character in Mitya whose jealousy and unchecked passion bring about his end. There is also a touch of modernity in these stories reflected by its treatment of sexuality. An adulterous affair, the sea, the night, a journey - these are recurring motifs in the book.\n\nAnd I was not surprised to find a mention of an episode from the Buddha's life in one of the stories. It is, no doubt, personally agreeable to find a Buddhist connection. I remember being delighted to find a mention of the Dalai Lama in Turgenev's 'Sketches from a Hunter's Album'. All the same I have to say most of these stories lack the 'story-ness' itself, without which any piece appears dead and hollow. Although a realist in the steps of Chekov, Bunin is too philosophical for his own good and lacks that eye for compassion and humour that made Chekov so great.\n\nDecember 1, 2013\n\nNobel Prize Project\n\nYear: 1933\n\nWinner: Ivan Bunin\n\nReview: The title story was great, one of the most insightful, thought provoking stories I've read in a long time. The other three stories in the collection were fairly innocuous character portraits, not exactly exciting but well-written. \"Son\" was the best of those. I will definitely be checking out more by this guy.\n\nVerdict: I don't know whether he was the best possible choice, but this is fundamentally Nobel-quality writing.\n\nRead\n\nJune 16, 2024\n\n“The fact we never learn the name of the gentleman from San Francisco—nor his wife’s name, nor his daughter’s—suggests the basic difference in orientation between Bunin’s story and “The Death of Ivan Ilych.” While the two stories share the themes of vanity, spiritual isolation, and death, Tolstoy focuses on the change which his hero undergoes. Enlightenment comes to Ivan Ilych and he breaks through the black bag, but for the gentleman from San Francisco there is no revelation—he remains in his black box in the bowels of the “Atlantic. Tolstoy makes us feel Ivan Ilych’s growing pain, and by the time he learns to feel pity for others, we have come to pity him. Bunin is more pessimistic. He wrote:\n\n‘Woe unto thee, Babylon!’ These terrible words of the apocalypse kept persistently ringing in my soul when I was writing “The Brothers” and conceived “The Gentleman from San Francisco,” only a few months before the war, when I had a presentiment of. . . the abyss which have since been revealed in our present-day civilization’\n\nWorld War One and the Russian Revolution showed that the Biblical warning was still relevant; the new Babylon was falling…\n\nthe careful reader may also be haunted by a feeling that the story has hidden depth and density. There is a wealth of detail, allusion, and symbol which gives the work this disturbing resonance….\n\nI think the key to the inner sanctum of the story is in the allusion to Tiberius…Why did Bunin set the story in Capri?…it was the residence of Tiberius Claudius Nero…(who)retired to Capri, neglected the affairs of state…and devoted himself to relaxed debauchery…he kept a house of adepts in perverse sexual practices…Above all, he was cruel.\n\nThe allusions to the birth and death of Christ are intended to combine with the epigram (‘Alas, alas, Babylon, the mighty city!’) and make us re-read the Book of Revelation.\n\nFN29: Bunin parallels specific situations from “The Death of Ivan Ilych”: the importance of the wife and daughter, the daughter coming to the death-bed with a half-bare bosom (contrast in flesh again), the reaction of other people to death, etc.\n\nFN31: in ironic contrast to the pious asceticism of its namesake, Saint Francis, at the turn of the century San Francisco was thought of as a symbol of crude materialism.\n\nFN32: a common interpretation of John’s allegory in Chapter 17 of the Book of Revelation has the seven-headed monster which supports the whore Babylon as a symbol for Rome with its seven hills. The entire apocalypse was written as a prediction of Rome’s fall. Of course, San Francisco too is built on seven hills. Presumably, this is one of the main reasons why Bunin chose that city. If we extend the prediction of the Apocalypse to the New World, then its fate is clear.”\n\n- Carl Proffer\n\nTranslated by Olga Shartse\n\nJune 21, 2021\n\nHave you had that experience when you hear or read about a book and then you go find it and read it and it's really wonderful? Well, I just did (again). I was reading Shirley Hazzard's delightful little book about Graham Greene, \"Greene on Capri,\" and she mentioned I. A. Bunin's book having something to do with the Isle of Capri. Aha, I thought. I think I have that little book somewhere in my stacks. Yes, there it was - a first edition in English published by Leonard and Virginia Woolf at their Hogarth Press in London in 1922, in mint condition, with the errata slip bound in.\n\nI read the first story (referencing the Isle of Capri) and then couldn't put it down. For several years apparently it sat in my shelves, unread and unappreciated.\n\nIt turns out, of course, Ivan Alekseyevich Bunin was the first Russhin writer to win the Pulitzer Prize (in 1933). Alas, my knowledge of and appreciation for Russian writers is seriously lacking. But, I am proud to say, my taste in fine literature and good writing is not impaired. Here's to more \"aha\" reading experiences.\n\nNovember 23, 2021\n\n(Only had chance to read The Gentleman from San Francisco): 3/5 stars\n\nI loved the wistful atmosphere Bunin created on the voyage towards Europe, the arrival of the family in Capri and everyone’s response to that. What I struggled to understand was the sudden death of the Gentleman and the complete 180 in behaviour of the staff and people from Capri.\n\nI liked the touch at the end, of the Gentleman journeying back in a dark coffin while life goes on as it did on the voyage to Europe, but that unexplained death, lack of attention to the daughter and wife’s grief at the death of the Gentleman, and the weird behaviour of Capri’s people after the event just made the story feel weird and not make sense anymore, which was a pity. This is a story that could’ve done with some more pages\n\nWant to read\n\nOctober 29, 2022\n\nRead so far:\n\nThe gentleman from San Francisco (Господин из Сан-Франциско) --3\n\nThe primer of love (aka The grammar of love, Грамматика любви) --2\n\nChang's dreams (Сны Чанга)\n\nTemir-Aksak-Khan (Темир-Аксак-Хан)\n\nLong ago (aka Distant things, Далёкое)\n\nAn unknown friend (Неизвестный друг)\n\nAt sea, at night (aka On the night sea, В ночном море)\n\nGraffiti (aka Inscriptions, Надписи)\n\nMitya's love (aka Brothers, Братья)\n\nSunstroke (Солнечный удар) --2\n\nNight (Ночь)\n\nThe Caucasus (Кавказ)\n\nLate hour (Поздний час)\n\n*Visiting cards (aka Calling cards,Визитные карточки)\n\nZoyka and Valeria (Зойка и Валерия)\n\nThe riverside tavern (Речной трактир)\n\n*A cold autumn (Холодная осень)\n\n***\n\n*Evening in spring (Весенний вечер)\n\nJuly 21, 2019\n\nJag har inte läst riktigt denna upplaga, utan den svenska Herrn från San Francisco och andra noveller från 1930-talet.\n\nJag är inte såld. Det finns vissa passager som är väldigt vackra och där det går att känna de starka känslor som karaktärerna känner, eller se de miljöer de befinner sig i, men mycket är det också bara meh. Och vad är grejen med att död spelar en så stor roll? I varje novell finns major character death med.\n\nLättläst iaf. Och alltid lite kul att se att människor alltid varit människor.\n\nMarch 12, 2019\n\nIt is unfortunate that Bunnin's work is relatively little known in English. He certainly deserves more and his short stories shine. Not only he is a master of this literary form, but in many ways unique even among Russian writers - though certainly one can see the \"Russian sensibility\" in his works.\n\nThough the \"The Gentleman from San Francisco\" is best known I consider the \"Sunstroke\" and \"Chang's Dream\" even better. But really all the short stories in this collection are superb.\n\nJuly 14, 2023\n\nIt took me so long to read this book.\n\nI decided to start it because of “Gentleman from San Francisco”, I loved that story. However there were only 2 other stories that i enjoyed as much as “Gentlemen from San Francisco”.\n\nIvan Bunin is the first Russian author to get a noble prize and i see why. He is extremely talented and has a writing style of his own. But for now i don’t see the appeal of his short stories, maybe i’ll change my opinion later\n\nMay 3, 2019\n\nA rich American and his family are on a world tour and have stopped in Italy. Assuming the world is theirs for the purchase, but a drastic turn of fortune shows that some things can't be purchased.\n\nA story that has potential ends in a pretty depressing way and no redemption available. It was interesting in the portrayal of dignity.\n\nCautiously recommend\n\nFebruary 1, 2024\n\nI'm frequently puzzled by the choices for the Nobel prize and Bunin is no exception. This book impressed me much less than when I first read it in the previous century. The descriptions of environments and events can be dazzlingly detailed but also rather superficial, as are most characters, while the dialogues are often tortured.\n\nJanuary 24, 2023\n\nFinalmente ho trovato una serie di racconti che mi è piaciuta, dopo che le ultime volte ero rimasto un po’ deluso. I racconti di Bunin un bello spaccato della società dell’epoca, l’autore ha viaggiato molto e questo si vede molto bene nelle ambientazioni precise (Capri, Sri Lanka, Russia, l’Oriente), con episodi sia di vita quotidiana che altri molto più particolari che hanno innescato la mia curiosità di andare avanti e leggere subito quello successivo. Probabilmente in futuro lèggerò altre sue opere, magari un romanzo, per farmi un’idea più precisa di questo scrittore che mi ha colpito.\n\nSeptember 7, 2017\n\nГосподин из Сан - Франциско: 2\n\nЧистый понедельник: 3\n\nЛёгкое дыхание: 4\n\nMay 20, 2020\n\nIncredibly well written but often so sad, borderline depressive."
