        "text": "January 21, 2022\n\n“He was very much in love, and when very much in love, they always shoot themselves...”\n\nDark Avenues (Russian: Тёмные аллеи) is a short-story collection written by Nobel Prize-winning Russian author Ivan Bunin. Its full version was publish in Paris in 1946. The unifying motif of the stories is love in all its aspects; both good and bad.\n\nI like how these mini-reviews form a greater whole and a broader perspective that represents my thoughts on the book in general. So, without further ado, here we go.\n\n1. Dark Avenues\n\nA love story, basically, about how we must count our blessings because the future might have worse things in store for us. Amazing how 30+ years of events were fit into 5 pages, too! [3]\n\n2. The Caucasus\n\nAn unfaithful wife makes off with her lover to southern Russia. Everything’s fine and dandy until it’s not. The descriptions of nature were beautiful but I was quite surprised – and slightly confused, too – by the abruptness with which the story ended. [2]\n\n3. A Ballad\n\nDuring the wandering pilgrim’s stay at a country house, the protagonist asks her about the entity she’s praying to, namely the “Lord's wolf.” An original and creative attempt at horror with a satisfying ending. [4]\n\n4. Styopa\n\nA shattering account of a teenage girl’s being sexually abused and, from what I understood, deceived into believing that in the end everything would turn out to be right. [4]\n\n5. Muza\n\nThe man does everything for her and then she just cheats on him as though it were the most normal thing in the world to do. Amazing writing. What a punch in the gut. But as the saying goes: easy come, easy go. [5]\n\n6. A Late Hour\n\nDidn’t really grab me. Surely, it must’ve been the late hour during which I was reading it. [1]\n\n7. Rusya\n\nThe man of a dependent daughter stands no chance against her jealous narcissistic mother. [5]\n\n8. A Beauty\n\nIn just one page the author was able to convey the shattering sadness of what it feels like to be neglected by one’s father who married a woman that hates the child from his previous marriage. Absolutely brilliant! (Thanks to Vadim’s Outlook at YouTube, I’ve learned that this story may also be interpreted as the author’s alienation as an artist from his native Russia during the times of the Soviet Union) [5]\n\n9. The Simpleton\n\nI’m not sure what to make of this one. 90% of the story is very much disheartening as it concerns a seminarist (and a deacon’s son) who impregnates their vulnerable cook and after a few years, out of shame (!), throws her and their son out. The conclusion here is that the boy was ugly but “when he smiled he was very sweet.” Does that mean there’s a silver lining lurking somewhere behind the clouds for the mother and the son? Will his charm save them? We are left to wonder... [4]\n\n10. Antigone\n\nHe is a general’s nephew and she’s his uncle’s servant. They have a one-night stand and he falls in love with her but their encounter is discovered, and she has to leave, thus abandoning her lover. That sucked, I guess... [2]\n\n11. An Emerald\n\nSo he didn’t succeed in seducing her. But the descriptions of nature were nice. [2]\n\n12. A Visitor\n\nA woman wishing to be raped again. I’m not sure whether it was funny or disturbing. [3]\n\n13. Wolves\n\nA pack of wolves left a woman scarred when she was much younger. And although she’s marked for life, the scars still remind her of better times. [4]\n\n14. Calling Cards\n\nSplendid descriptions of nature; I truly felt as if I were feeling the cold on that great river. And the way the author wrote about the building sexual desire and tension was absolutely remarkable! [5]\n\n15. Zoyka and Valeria\n\nA dude hating a girl for her teasing him constantly. I don’t know. Personally, I didn’t get anything out of it. [1]\n\n16. Tanya\n\nI can see what the message here was (two lovers separated by the atrocities of the Russian Revolution) but I was bored and fatigued by the style of narration. Sorry. [2]\n\n17. In Paris\n\nThat was easy breezy, right? And everything was going so great before it hit rock bottom. The moral of the story? Don’t leave your husband and don’t quit your job because one day you’ll have no chance to get your old life back. [3]\n\n18. Galya Ganskaya\n\nI was going to give this story only one star but then I read this:\n\n“What crazy people these damned Poles are.” As a Polack myself, I can say that this was an understatement, but true, nevertheless. [2]\n\n19. Heinrich\n\nA man and a woman escaping their home country to find peace and happiness abroad. The author did a great job in creating the main characters of this story; I found myself invested in their fates and felt for them once everything started going south. [4]\n\n20. Natalie\n\nThe longest story in the collection. The protagonist is torn between his cousin Sonya and her friend Natalie, both of whom he very much lusts after. The story was interesting enough, but I failed to understand what Natalie was on about all the time. [3]\n\n21. Upon a Long-Familiar Street\n\nShort and filled with nostalgia, just like the event it described, sprinkled with imaginative descriptions and comparisons. [4]\n\n22. A Riverside Inn\n\nWhat a nice trip to the Volga region. Lesson learned: some beings just can’t change. [3]\n\n23. The Godmother\n\nI, uh, I don’t get it. [1]\n\n24. The Beginning\n\nIf you feel like that guy did during winter, you know the experience must have been intense. Snow, pine trees, and women. Amazing. [4]\n\n25. The Oaklings\n\nPassion. Murder. Honor. [5]\n\n26. Miss Klara\n\nA surreal, almost oneiric, encounter with what seemed to be a prostitute. I liked it a lot for its weirdness. [5]\n\n27. Madrid\n\nWhat an amazing analysis of what it means to have a rough life. If it could be worse, then it’s not that bad after all, right? This little ditty makes you think, all right. [5]\n\n28. A Second Pot of Coffee\n\nThis one has to be one of the funniest stories in this collection, and I giggled like hell reading it, too! Ps. I swear, my love for coffee did not affect my judgement of this story. Speaking of which... [5]\n\n29. Iron Coat\n\nThe way I see it, this horror-coated story can be interpreted as our giving in to to our basic instincts, and then suffering the social and psychological consequences of our actions. It reminded me a lot of Freud’s writings, too. [5]\n\n30. A Cold Autumn\n\nWar, death, solitude. The descriptions were powerful, to say the least. [5]\n\n31. The Steamer Saratov\n\nHere’s a lesson for ya: if people do you wrong, just ignore them, for defending your honor can land you in prison. [5]\n\n32. The Raven\n\nA dark story about a father who desires the girl that’s fallen in love with his son. Some people can be cold and selfish, and the author did an amazing job in depicting the ruthless father as such. [5]\n\n33. The Camargue\n\nJust a description of a woman. Maybe written in appreciation of her beauty? Or maybe I’m just lacking the context. [2]\n\n34. One Hundred Rupees\n\nSame. [1]\n\n35. Vengeance\n\nA wronged woman with a broken heart finds a way out of her despair. The story wasn’t that bad but I wasn’t terribly engrossed by it, either. [2]\n\n36. The Swing\n\nMeh... [1]\n\n37. Pure Monday\n\nThis is one of the longest entries in this collection and yet I wasn’t able to find anything that would spark my interest. [1]\n\n38. The Chapel\n\nA very brief but oh how gloomy and eerie story this one was about love and suicide. Definitely one of my favorites. What an awesome way to close this collection! [5]\n\nSome final thoughts:\n\nThis was a mixed bag for me. While some of the stories here were some of the greatest pieces of literature I’ve ever read (they made me laugh, cry, think), others were – in my estimation – completely devoid of any depth and meaning.\n\n3+2+4+4+5+1+5+5+4+2+2+3+4+5+1+2+3+2+4+3+4+3+1+4+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+2+1+2+1+1+5 = 128 / 38 = 3.3"
