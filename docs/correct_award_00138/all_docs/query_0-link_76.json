        "text": "He read the great poets of Acmeism (Anna Akhmatovna and Ossip Mandelstam ) and of Futurism (Aleksei Kruchenykh, Velimir Khlebnikov and Vladimir Mayakovsky). Even as an emigre poet he would have been aware of Boris Pasternak and Marina Tsvetaeva, both producing linguistically brilliant, challenging and emotively compelling work.\n\nBut Bunin remained studiously unaffected by all such movements. His poetry shows the influence of Symbolism and Acmeism occasionally, but not markedly so. He knew its celebrated poets personally, and was respected in his turn, but Bunin simply produced collections of very conventional poems on very conventional themes. The personal element is not so much missing as muted, only hinted at in the ironic phrase or reflection, as is the case in his prose works. Many of the poems do indeed anticipate the short stories, but the affection for all things Russian has yet to become an overwhelming nostalgia. Bunin poems have an encompassing love of humanity, but also a stern eye for realism, and Bunin thus had little of Gorky's idealism of the common man, or Blok's unrealistic hopes of the Revolution. As his social world collapsed, first in Russia, and then in the Nazi takeover of France, he increasingly adhered to the traditionalist view, that poems give enduring life to what is only particular and evanescent. The poems seem very conventional, quite unlike those of more celebrated writers in Russia's Silver Age, but the pieces are very accomplished and have weathered well: many indeed anticipate the approaches of western Modernist poets.\n\nBunin's Poetry: A Very Traditional Approach\n\nPoetry for Bunin required application, observation and detachment. Each poem was a separate conception, therefore, born of what its author felt and saw at that particular moment, and not the product of a sustained reflection on intellectualised themes, as Modernist work tends to be. Bunin was thus a very traditional poet, indeed reactionary in later years. A poet in Bunin's view does not create from sustained imagination, but must fuse sense impressions and craft to produce aesthetic entities that reconcile us to our existence as it generally is, fragmentary and in the end unsatisfactory, but still mysteriously life-enhancing.\n\nThe free pdf ebook translates fifty of Bunin's most representative pieces. Each is given with facing Russian text, and the ebook includes an extensive Appendix providing literal and prosodic renderings, links to critical articles and audio recordings, and important references.\n\nA free Bunin Poems e-book in pdf format.\n\nExcerpt (Opening of Leaf Fall)"
