        "text": "I can't comment personally on Hartmann's supposed overclaiming, but I am VERY impressed with the fact that he never lost a wingman. That he could fly the combat he flew (1.404 missions, 850 combat missions, 352 victories awarded, meaning 2.41 combat missions per victory (189 LaGG [not La-5s], 81 P-39, 25 Yak-9. etc., I have the list) without losing a wingman speaks volumes for his sense of when to attack and when not to, and his sense of situational awareness.\n\nGreg - I suggest some NEW research as some of Hartman's feats have been debunked. As mentioned, a very detailed analysis has been done by Nick Hector to a segment of his claims and was found to be 44% overclaimed, and as mentioned, only 307 of his supposed claims had even been 'officially' filed before the end of the war. The fact that he never lost a wing man or was shot down by another fighter is suspect based on Soviet records released in 1991. At first I had a hard time believing this but the more I looked into this and the number of people coming up with the same conclusions, I have to believe their research. This was from the FB site I posted, D. Case is the author and I know he got most of his data from Nick. Sorry for the length of this article, but it does show the detail of research that went into it. I welcome comments, bold points are from me...\n\nErich Alfred Hartmann (19 April 1922 – 20 September 1993), nicknamed \"Bubi\" (\"The Kid\") by his German comrades, was a German fighter pilot during World War II and assumed to be the most successful fighter ace in the history of aerial warfare.\n\nHe flew 1,404 combat missions and participated in aerial combat on 825 separate occasions. He claimed, and was credited with, shooting down 352 Allied aircraft — 350 Soviet and 2 American—while serving with the Luftwaffe.\n\nRecent Claims research by Nick Hector and several other respected researchers has revealed that Hartmann had a horrendous actual claim % accuracy....\n\nOut of 72 victory claims listed below, only 32 actual claims resulted in a confirmed destroyed aircraft, with 40 claims being registered as overclaims...\n\nThis gives Hartmann a terrible claiming accuracy of 44.4%.\n\nThe research is based off of official Soviet TsAMO reports from the historical achives, which was only opened up in the early 90's.\n\nDuring the course of his career, Hartmann was forced to crash-land his fighter 14 times due to damage received from parts of enemy aircraft he had just shot down or mechanical failure.\n\nOn 20 August 1943, Hartmann himself was shot down: according to his account (in Toliver), he dispatched two Il-2s before being hit by anti-aircraft fire. He managed to belly-land and was captured for a short period of time (later he evaded).\n\nIn fact, author Khazanov was able to determine, that according to Soviet records, what Hartmann attacked was a group of Shturmoviks of the 232 ShAP.\n\nOne of the Il-2 pilots, Leytenat Pavel Evdokimov, saw a \"Messer\" jump his comrade V. Ermakov, who , firing at close range managed to put a 20-mm burst into the Bf.109, which performed a belly-landing - this was Hartmann's Bf109G-6.\n\nNo Il-2 were lost by 232 ShAP that day, although two were damaged.\n\nOnce again, Hartmann's \"kills\" were overclaims (even when in this case both were in good faith).\n\nAnd he was not downed by flak, but by Shturmovik pilot Pavel Evdokimov.\n\nGerman archives are themselves contradictory. Indeed only 289 of Hartmann's 'victories' were in fact 'officially confirmed' before the German claims sytem broke down in early 1945. Secondly, only 307 of his supposed claims had even been 'officially' filed before the end of the war..\n\nKhazanov conceeds that indeed Hartmann was a dangerous opponent, crediting him with at least two victories against Soviet aces: on 16.10.1943 he shot down the La-5 of Starshiy Leytenant Ivan Nikitovich Sytov (30 victories, 5 GIAP), and on 1.03.1945 the Yak-9 of Kapitan Sergey Ivanovich Lazarev (728 IAP, 256 IAD), but not before Lazarev shot down the Bf109G-14 of Hartmann's wingman G. Kapito (Lazarev's victory No.26)...\"\n\nHartmann began his military training on 1 October 1940 at the 10th Flying Regiment in Neukuhren. On 1 March 1941, he progressed to the Luftkriegsschule 2 (Air War School 2) in Berlin-Gatow, making his first flight with an instructor four days later, followed in just under three weeks by his first solo flight.\n\nHe completed his basic flying training in October 1941 and began advanced flight training at pre-fighter school 2 in Lachen-Speyerdorf on 1 November 1941. There, Hartmann learned combat techniques and gunnery skills.\n\nHis advanced pilot training was completed on 31 January 1942, and, between 1 March 1942 and 20 August 1942, he learned to fly the Messerschmitt Bf 109 at the Jagdfliegerschule 2 (Fighter Pilot School 2) in Zerbst/Anhalt.\n\nHartmann was assigned to III./JG 52, led by Gruppenkommandeur Major Hubertus von Bonin, and placed under the experienced Oberfeldwebel Edmund \"Paule\" Roßmann, although he also flew with such experienced pilots as Alfred Grislawski, Hans Dammers and Josef Zwernemann.\n\nHartmann flew his first combat mission on 14 October 1942 as Roßmann's wingman. When they encountered 10 enemy aircraft below, Hartmann, obsessed by the idea of scoring his first success, opened full throttle and became separated from Roßmann. He engaged an enemy fighter, but failed to score any hits and nearly collided with it instead. He then ran for cover in low cloud, and his mission subsequently ended with a crash landing after his aircraft ran out of fuel.\n\nHartmann had violated almost every rule of air-to-air combat, and von Bonin sentenced him to three days of working with the ground crew.\n\nIn Hartmann's words:\n\n\"Well, Rossmann and I were in our flight, and Rossmann radioed that he spotted ten enemy aircraft below us. We were at 12,000 feet and the enemy was far below us. I could see nothing but followed Rossmann down, then we came on them. I knew that I had to get my first kill, so I went full throttle and left Rossmann to shoot at a plane. My shots missed and I almost collided into him and had to pull up.\n\nSuddenly I was surrounded by the Soviets and I headed for low cloud cover to escape. All along Rossmann kept talking to me, and I had a low fuel warning.\n\nThen the engine went dead and I bellied in, destroying my fighter. I knew I was in trouble. I had violated every commandment a fighter pilot lives by, and I expected to be thrown out.\"\n\nTwenty-two days later, Hartmann claimed his first kill, an Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik of the 7th Guards Ground Attack Aviation Regiment.\n\nClaim Verification Research by Nick Hector\n\nNo. 1,\n\n5.11.42/1205\n\nIL-2 Sturmovik\n\nPQ 44 793, Digora (Caucasus) @ 400m\n\n7 GShAP, 4 VA\n\nWe know that Grislawski shot down Mladshiy Leytenant Fyodor Artyomov, KIA and Serzhant Vladimir Zangiyev, bellylanded safely POW (returned)\n\nHartmann's claim does not seem to match any of the known losses in the engagement. Nor does Eberhard Fritz's claim\n\nHartmann on how he met Walter Krupinski:\n\n\"I was being addressed by my new Wing Commander (Hrabak) when a fighter came in smoking, and suddenly landed, flipped over and exploded. We knew the pilot was dead. One of the men said that 'it is Krupinski', and out of the blinding smoke this man walked out of the wreckage with a singed uniform, but no other damage.\n\nHe was smiling and complained about the flak over the Caucasus, but without any real surprise on his face. This was my first meeting with \"The Count.\"\n\nHartmann makes his 2nd claim on 27 January 1943, when he engages Soviet aircraft over Armavir and shoots down a Mig-1 fighter.\n\nNo 2,\n\n27.1.43/1130\n\nMiG-1\n\nArmavir (PQ 15112) @ 2500m\n\nPossibly an aircraft of 7 IAP-ChF, but no further substantiation than that so far....\n\nHartmann claims his third victory on 9 February 1943, over a Yak-1 fighter\n\nNo.3,\n\n9.2.43/1020\n\nYak-1 (Misidentified as a \"LaGG-3\")\n\nSlawjanskaja (PQ 86722) @ 1000m\n\n66 IAP.

Evgeniy Ivanovich Kryukov [MIA] 43 IAP (3 IAK)\n\nOn 23 May 1943, he claimed his 17th victory, but two days later, Hartmann force-landed his Bf 109 G-4 \"White 2\" (W.Nr. 14 997) after colliding with a LaGG-3 fighter.\n\nAfter this incident he was given leave to rest and recuperate, returning to combat duty by the end of June.\n\nOn 25 May 1943, he shot down a Lavochkin La-5, before colliding with another Soviet fighter.\n\nHowever, he retained control of his damaged aircraft.\n\nOn 5 July 1943, Hartmann claimed FOUR victories and seemingly finds his groove.\n\nwo days later, on 7 July, Hartmann's personal plane, decorated with a large Roman numeral 'I' and the name Usch in a red heart (Usch Paetch was his fiancee), took part in one of the largeest dogfights that took place during the Battle of Kursk.\n\nHe claimed to have shot down SEVEN enemy aircraft throughout the day to record his 22nd through 28th victories.\n\nNo. 22,\n\nIL-2 on 7.7.43/0350: 1 ShAK.

Vladimir Grigorevich Snagovski MIA at 1155 local time over Ercsi, S of Budapest (was this it?)\n\nTwo Yak-9s on 9.12.44:\n\n150 GIAP lost 2329218 of Gv.Ml.Lt. Lev Gerasimovich Kamanyan crashlanded at 1450 local time after dogfight\n\nFrom 1–14 February 1945, Hartmann briefly led I. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 53 as acting Gruppenkommandeur until he was replaced by Helmut Lipfert.\n\nIn March 1945, Hartmann, his score now standing at 336 aerial victories, was asked a second time by General Adolf Galland to join the Me 262 units forming to fly the new jet fighter.\n\nHartmann did indeed attend the jet conversion program led by Heinrich Bär.\n\nGalland also intended Hartmann to fly with Jagdverband 44. Hartmann declined the offer, preferring to remain with JG 52.\n\nSome sources report that Hartmann's decision to stay with his unit was due to a request via telegram made by Oberstleutnant Hermann Graf.\n\nNow Gruppenkommandeur of I./JG 52, Erich Hartmann claimed his 350th aerial victory on 17 April, in the vicinity of Chrudim.\n\nThe last wartime photograph of Hartmann known was taken in connection with this victory.\n\nHartmann's last kill occurred over Brno, Czechoslovakia, on 8 May 1945, the last day of the war in Europe.\n\nEarly that morning, he was ordered to fly a reconnaissance mission and report the position of Soviet forces. Hartmann took off with his wingman at 08:30 and spotted the first Soviet units just 40 kilometres (25 miles) away.\n\nPassing over the area, Hartmann saw two Yak-9s performing aerobatics for the Soviet columns.\n\nDetermined to \"spoil the party\", Hartmann dove upon the fighters from his vantage point at 12,000 ft (3,700 m) and shot one down from a range of 200 ft (61 m).\n\nNo. 352, Yak on 8.5.45\n\n2 VA, 5 VA or 17 VA, pilot said to be KIA, listed as overclaim\n\nAs he lined up the second fighter, Hartmann noticed a flicker of shiny dots above him coming from the West; they were P-51s.\n\nRather than make a stand and be caught between the Soviets and the Americans, Hartmann and his wingman fled at low level into the pall of smoke that covered Brno.\n\nWhen he landed, Hartmann learned that the Soviet forces were within artillery range of the airfield, so JG 52 destroyed Karaya One, 24 other Bf 109s, and large quantities of ammunition.\n\nHartmann later recalled his final violent action of the war:\n\n\"We destroyed the aircraft and all munitions, everything. I sat in my fighter and fired the guns into the woods where all the fuel had been dropped, and then jumped out. We destroyed twenty-five perfectly good fighters. They would be nice to have in museums now.\"\n\nAs Gruppenkommandeur of I./JG 52, Hartmann chose to surrender his unit to members of the US 90th Infantry Division.\n\nAfter his capture, the U.S. Army handed Hartmann, his pilots, and ground crew over to the Soviet Union on 14 May 1945, where he was imprisoned in accordance with the Yalta Agreements, which stated that airmen and soldiers fighting Soviet forces had to surrender directly to them.\n\nDuring his captivity Hartmann was first arrested on 24 December 1949, and three days later, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nHartmann was charged with war crimes, specifically the \"deliberate shooting of 780 Soviet civilians\" in the village of Briansk, attacking a \"bread factory\" on 23 May 1943, and destroying 345 \"expensive\" Soviet aircraft.\n\nIn 1955, Hartmann's mother wrote to the new West German Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, to whom she appealed to secure his freedom. A trade agreement between West Germany and the Soviet Union was reached, and Hartmann was released along with 16,000 German military personnel as one of the last Heimkehrer. After spending 10 and a half years in Soviet POW camps, he was among the last batch of prisoners to be turned over. Returning to West Germany, he was reunited with his wife Ursula, to whom he had written every day of the war.\n\nDuring his long imprisonment, Hartmann's son, Erich-Peter, was born in 1945 and died as a three-year-old in 1948, without his father ever having seen him. Hartmann later had a daughter, Ursula Isabel, born on 23 February 1957.\n\nWhen Hartmann returned to West Germany, he reentered military service in the Bundeswehr and became an officer in the West German Air Force, where he commanded West Germany's first all-jet unit, Jagdgeschwader 71 \"Richthofen\", which was equipped initially with Canadair Sabres and later with Lockheed F-104 Starfighters.\n\nHe also made several trips to the United States, where he was trained on U.S. Air Force equipment. He had the JG 71 aircraft painted with the same spreading black tulip pattern used by Karaya 1 on the Eastern Front.\n\nAfter his military retirement, from 1971–74, Hartmann worked as a flight instructor in Hangelar, near Bonn, and also flew in an aerobatics team with Adolf Galland.\n\nIn 1980 he caught a cold that developed into angina pectoris — the condition that had killed his father at the age of 58. He recovered and, by 1983, was medically cleared to fly, after which he resumed instructing at the various flying schools.\n\nHowever, fearing a second attack, he became cautious and limited his appearances at public events.\n\nHartmann stated:\n\n\"I am retired and I am a civilian, and now I like to have my rest and peace. I do not live for exhibitions.\"\n\nHartmann died on 20 September 1993, at the age of 71 in Weil im Schönbuch.\n\nQuestion to Hartmann:\n\nWhat were some of your more memorable combat experiences in fighting enemy aircraft?\n\nA:\n\n\"One situation comes to mind. I was in a duel with a Red Banner flown Yak-9, and this guy was good, and absolutely insane. He tried and tried to get in behind me, and every time he went to open fire I would jerk out of the way of his rounds.\n\nThen he pulled up and rolled, and we approached each other head on, firing, with no hits either way.\n\nThis happened two times.\n\nFinally I rolled into a negative G dive, out of his line of sight, and rolled out to chase him at full throttle. I came in from below in a shallow climb and flamed him.\n\nThe pilot bailed out and was later captured.\n\nI met and spoke with this man, a captain, who was a likeable guy. We gave him some food and allowed him to roam the base after having his word that he would not escape.\n\nHe was happy to be alive, but he was very confused, since his superiors told him that Soviet pilots would be shot immediately upon capture.\""
