The rest are harmonious and flexible. In character, manners, habits - like his mother, but in appearance - like his father.\n\nThe adult Gregory reveals in himself the traits of slight vulnerability and increased mental sensitivity. An emphatically dry tone can throw him out of mental balance for a long time. To please everyone and always is his motto, and following it, he pays quite a lot of attention to fashion and is gallant in communication.\n\nGregory has good health, a calm, balanced character. He does not like “a watch on his hand” and “a master above his head.” He is interested in football, hockey, loves delicious food, therefore, as his life partner, he sees a good housewife with an even, calm character. He does not spare money for everyday life, clothes, food, and entertainment.\n\nGregory also likes to look at attractive young women. So his wife should be very careful in choosing her girlfriends.

Their significance in the character and behavior of Gregory is manifested 2 times more strongly.\n\nParable of the day January 23, 2022 on the Feast of the Summer Sign.\n\nOnce upon a time, an old wise man came to one village and stayed there to live. He loved children and spent a lot of time with them. He also loved to give them gifts, but only gave them fragile things. No matter how hard the children tried to be careful, their new toys often broke. The children were upset and cried bitterly. Some time passed, the sage again gave them toys, but even more fragile.\n\nOne day his parents couldn’t stand it anymore and came to him:\n\n“You are wise and wish only the best for our children.” But why do you give them such gifts? They try their best, but the toys still break and the children cry. But the toys are so beautiful that it’s impossible not to play with them.\n\n“Very few years will pass,” the elder smiled, “and someone will give them his heart.” Maybe this will teach them to handle such a priceless gift a little more carefully?\n\nInterpretation of letters in a name\n\nEach letter has its own influence on a person. It is from the meanings of individual letters that the overall meaning of the name is formed.\n\nG - the owner of this letter in the name is endowed with strong intuition and psychic abilities, but does not even suspect it. It is difficult for him to establish relationships with friends or the opposite sex, since he has absolutely no tact. Strives for self-development, always happy to learn something new;\n\nR - needs a girl who will support him and never betray him. He is endowed with optimism and the ability to see only the good in any situation, he is never sad or upset over trifles. Responsibly takes on any assignments, is very patient and principled, it is impossible to argue with such a person or convince him that he is wrong;\n\nAnd - a romantic who has been looking for the ideal spouse all his life, but, unfortunately, does not always find it. He is a little out of this world, his head in the clouds and immersed in dreams. This man is kind and simple-minded, his soul is an open book to those around him. He can become quite successful, as he has extraordinary thinking and insight;\n\nG - the value is already specified;\n\nO is very stubborn and tenacious, which allows him to quickly climb the career ladder and achieve the fulfillment of any of his dreams. This is an active, kind and sympathetic person who is unable to betray a loved one. He is very conservative and sticks to his habits. Falls in love once and for life;\n\nP—the value has already been specified;\n\nAnd - the value has already been specified;\n\nY - similar to the meaning of the letter I.\n\nThe first letter of the name gives Gregory strong intuition\n\nCharacter\n\nThe name Gregory has many positive traits. He is active and decisive, achieves his plans persistently and purposefully. Gregory can go towards his goal for years without becoming discouraged or upset by various obstacles. Since childhood, he becomes an authority among his peers. He communicates easily and finds a common language with almost any person. But he also demands openness and sincerity from those around him, otherwise he will begin to attack, taking hypocrisy as a personal insult. Even when the situation gets tense and Gregory is unlucky for a long time, he finds the strength to shake himself up and get down to business with renewed vigor, forgetting about all the failures and mistakes. Negative character traits should also be highlighted. Along with insolence and increased activity, Gregory is too impetuous and proud. He strives to immediately achieve what he wants, even if he has to wait a long time for the result. He cannot work for long: if his efforts do not bring results, he tries to solve the problem in another way. Being overly emotional, little Gregory quite often exhausts his parents with demands to fulfill his wishes or to purchase some new thing.\n\nMemorial Days:\n\nFebruary 7 is the day of remembrance of St. Gregory the Theologian\n\nFebruary 12 - Council of Ecumenical Teachers and Saints Basil the Great, Gregory the Theologian and John Chrysostom\n\nOther famous saints named Gregory:\n\nSaint Gregory of Tours (538–594) came from a family of senators. In 573 he became bishop of the city of Tours. At the time of his consecration, the King of Austrasia, Sigibert I, was present in the temple and was subsequently especially respected at the royal court. Gregory became famous thanks to his ten-volume History of the Franks. This work has become one of the most reliable sources on the history of Western Europe in the 6th century. In addition, the saint was engaged in compiling the lives of Gallic saints.\n\nSaint Gregory the Great (Dvoeslov) (540-604) came from an ancient patrician family. Having received an excellent secular education, Gregory decided to become a monk. For a long time the saint worked in Byzantium, studying the Greek language and theology. In 590 he was elected pope. Gregory composed the rite of the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts, which is still celebrated during the period of Great Lent. The relics of the saint are kept to this day in the Cathedral of the Apostle Peter in the Vatican.\n\nHieromartyr Gregory, the enlightener of Great Armenia (252–326 ), remained an orphan from childhood. His parents and entire family died after his father ordered the murder of the Armenian king Khosrov. Gregory lived in Rome for a long time. Returning to his homeland as a Christian, the saint was thrown into prison for 13 years by order of the pagan Armenian king Tiridates. However, when the ruler fell into madness, Gregory, after praying, healed him. After this, the king and the entire population of Armenia were baptized. So this country in 301 became the first where Christianity was officially declared the state religion. Gregory became the first Armenian bishop. After his death, the descendants of the saint continued to head the Armenian department for a long time.\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\n1. Saint Gregory the Theologian left behind a rich literary heritage, consisting of 245 letters, 507 poems (sometimes written in imitation of Homer in the forms of hexameters, pentameters, trimeters) and 45 “Words”.\n\n2. Saint Gregory is one of three saints (besides the Apostle John the Theologian and Simeon the New Theologian) who entered the history of the Church with the name “Theologian”. His theology had a significant influence on the entire subsequent history of Christian thought. Saint Gregory the Theologian, in his essay “On His Poems,” named three main goals that prompted him to take the path of poetry: self-education; the creation of a new poetic tradition to replace ancient poems, the reading of which “sometimes brought bad fruit”; to fight heretics.\n\n3. In honor of Pope Gregory XIII (1502-1585), a time calculation system based on the cyclic revolution of the Earth around the Sun is named - the Gregorian calendar.\n\n4. The name Gregory was very popular in church circles. Throughout the history of the Western and Eastern Churches, 16 popes and 7 patriarchs of Constantinople bore this name.\n\n5. In Russia, the name Gregory was most common in the 19th century among Russified Jews, by analogy with some Jewish names (for example, Gershen).\n\n6. A special medieval tradition of liturgical singing in the Roman Church is named after St. Gregory (Dvoeslov) - Gregorian chants (in Latin cantus planus) - monophonic singing.\n\nMore and more people are interested in the meaning of their name, which is not surprising. Each name contains a certain secret meaning and leaves a unique imprint on its owner. One of the ancient and popular names in Russia is Gregory, which translated from Greek means “unsleeping”, “vigorous”, “awake”.\n\nTable: name matches\n\nPlanetMars, SaturnZodiac signAries, AquariusNumber1ElementAirColorBrown, greenPlantNarcissusTreeCypressTotem animalTigerStoneNephritisDay of the weekWednesdaySeasonWinter\n\nDaffodils are the plant symbol of Gregory\n\nSaints named Gregory\n\nSaint Gregory the Theologian (329–389)\n\nGregory was born near the city of Nazians (the territory of modern Turkey). He came, in the literal sense of the word, from a family of saints: his father Gregory, Bishop of Nazianza, mother Nonna, brother Caesarius and sister Gorgonia - all of them were canonized after their death. Having received his primary education at home, the young man continued his studies, first in Alexandria, and then showed himself brilliantly at the Platonic Academy in Athens. “...Athens is the abode of science... for me it is truly golden and has brought me a lot of good things,” the saint later recalled. Here Gregory met Saint Basil the Great (c. 330 - 279). They became friends for life.\n\nAt the Academy, the saint taught rhetoric for some time, and then returned home and received baptism from his father. All his life, Gregory strove for solitude, with its calm and regularity, desiring philosophical contemplation and prayerful peace. To do this, he goes to a monastery in the city of Pontus. But in 361, at the insistence of his father, he became a priest. During this period, he actively helps him in the affairs of managing the diocese.\n\nWhen Basil the Great became Archbishop of Cappadocia, he asked his friend to take the see in the city of Sasimachus. Having accepted the rank of bishop, Gregory initially agreed to Vasily’s proposal, but after some time he left the city - he could not bear his fuss. The saint spends three years in prayerful silence in the monastery. After the death of his father, Gregory, at the insistence of the city residents, becomes the new bishop of Nazianza.\n\nAfter some time in Constantinople, having heard about the brilliant reputation of the educated preacher, they sent a group to him that begged him to become a bishop in the capital. Gregory, after some hesitation, accepts the offer. About the situation that the saint found in the capital, he wrote the following: “Some, yesterday or the day before yesterday, took a break from menial work and suddenly became professors of theology. Others, it seems servants, who have been beaten more than once, who have escaped from slave service, philosophize with importance about the Incomprehensible. Everything is full of this kind of people: streets, markets, squares, crossroads.” Constantinople was torn apart by dogmatic contradictions. Seeing this, Gregory the Theologian began an active struggle against the various heretical movements that flourished here.\n\nDuring his stay in Constantinople, the saint pronounced his famous “Five Words on Theology” in the home Church of the Resurrection. It was thanks to them that he later received the nickname Theologian. The saint took part in the Second Ecumenical Council (381), however, unable to withstand the internal political tension and court intricacies, he voluntarily left the capital’s see. “I bow to councils and interviews from afar since I experienced a lot of bad things,” the saint wrote, explaining his subsequent reluctance to take an active part in the life of the Church. He retired to his family estate and devoted all the remaining time to literary works: in particular, he wrote an autobiography. Before his death, the saint bequeathed all his property to the diocese.\n\nOn January 25, 389, he died in Nazianza. In 950 the relics of St. Gregory were transferred to Constantinople.\n\nThe name Gregory and our heroic past\n\nGrigory Andreevich Rechkalov (1920 - 1990, Moscow) - twice Hero of the Soviet Union, Major General of Aviation.

The name day (angel days) calendar presented below will help you determine the date of the name day, as well as find out the meaning of the name and its origin.\n\nThe Orthodox and Catholic name day calendars differ greatly in the names of the saints, since after the church schism of 1054, each church canonized only its own saints. Thus, it is easy to determine which saint was canonized before the church schism - he will be represented in both the Orthodox and Catholic name day calendars.\n\nShare the link “Name Day for the name Gregory” with friends on social networks:\n\nHoroscope for today\n\nWeekly horoscope\n\nHoroscope for 2022\n\nMonthly horoscope\n\nCompatibility Horoscope\n\nEastern horoscope for 2022\n\nEastern horoscope 2021\n\nHoroscope for 2022\n\nFaith and religion\n\nPractice\n\nTarot cards\n\nSecrets of the world\n\nNames and birthdays\n\nMagic\n\nThe fight of extrasensories\n\nConspiracies\n\nSpells for money\n\nConspiracies of the Siberian Healer\n\nEvil eye and damage\n\nMagnetic storm calendar\n\nCalendar 2020\n\nCalendar 2021\n\nFavorable days\n\nbeauty\n\nHealth\n\nRelationship\n\nGarden and dacha\n\nOur children\n\nTranslated from Greek, the name Gregory means “awake, awake, vigilant.”\n\nThe name Gregory in world culture\n\nGregory Peck (1916 – 2003) is one of the most famous actors in the history of Hollywood.
