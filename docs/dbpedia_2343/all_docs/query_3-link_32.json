        "text": "OVD Info\n\nFacebook\n\nOctober 8, 2020\n\nOn October 7, protests took place in various cities in honor [sic] of President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs birthday. Police reacted differently in each case.\n\nüìç In Moscow, members of Pussy Riot held an anti-homophobic protest by hanging rainbow flags on various government buildings. Police detained a journalist during the protest, and two participants later that evening. They were charged the rules for holding a public event. Today, police continued visiting the homes of the activists.\n\nLeft Bloc activists left bottles of PVA glue and swimming fins outside the office of the presidential administration. [This was an allusion to the Russian prison slang expression ‚Äúto glue the fins‚Äù (skleit‚Äô lasty), meaning ‚Äúto die.‚Äù] Police detained a journalist who wanted to see how officials reacted to the installation. He was charged with violating the rules for holding a public event and has his electronic devices confiscated.\n\nüìç In Kurgan, supporters of Alexei Navalny held solo pickets, wishing the president a speedy retirement. Afterwards, Center ‚ÄúE‚Äù officers attempted to enter the local Navalny headquarters, but were not allowed to enter.\n\nüìç In Novokuibyshevsk (Samara Region), opposition activists picketed on the city‚Äôs central square. Police officers took them to the police station, where they questioned them, scolded them for violating social distancing rules, and released them without charge.\n\nüìç In Petersburg, several people in Putin masks staged a protest outside Gostiny Dvor. Six people were detained and taken to three different police stations. They were charged with violating the self-isolation regime.\n\nActivists of the Vesna Movement arranged a birthday spread outside the house where Vladimir Putin lived as a young man. After drinking tea, they pretended to be dead. The police are looking for the people involved in the protest at their actual and registered places of residence.\n\nPhotos by David Frenkel.

Translated by the Russian Reader\n\n‚ÄúFree Svyatoslav Rechkalov.‚Äù Photo courtesy of the VK page Popular Self-Defense\n\nAnarchist Rechkalov Detained in Investigation of Attack on United Russia Campaign HQ, Tortured\n\nGrani.ru\n\nMarch 15, 2018\n\nAnarchist Svyatoslav Rechkalov, detained yesterday as part of an investigation of the attack on the United Russia party campaign headquarters in the Moscow district of Khovrino, has been remanded in custody to the Temporary Detention Center, as reported in the early hours of Thursday by OVD Info, who cited Yevgenia, a friend of Rechkalov‚Äôs who was detained at Rechkalov‚Äôs flat along with him and another person whose name has not been ascertained. It cannot be ruled out the person in question was an anarchist named Andrei, who as of Wednesday evening had also not been released from police custody.\n\nRechkalov informed his comrades that,when he was in the Moscow police‚Äôs investigation department, police officers had tortured him, demanding he confess his involvement in the attack. They put a plastic bag over Rechkalov‚Äôs head and administered electrical shocks to his legs.\n\nIt has not been ascertained whether Rechkalov confessed or not. Yevgenia maintains he had nothing to do with the attack on the United Russia headquarters.\n\nYevgenia and the unidentifed third detainee were released last night, but on Thursday they were summoned to the investigative department for questioning as witnesses.\n\nOn Thursday morning, lawyer Mikhail Biryukov reported he was going to the investigative department to obtain permission to see Rechkalov.\n\nYesterday, we reported that Left Bloc activist Vladimir Zhuravlov and an anarchist named Artyom had been questioned as witnesses in the case. Both men said they had no information about the attack.\n\nIn addition, security services officers searched the Left Bloc‚Äôs headquarters, confiscating all the equipment they found there and cracking open a safe. The three activists present the headquarters‚ÄîVadim Timergalin, Grigory Sineglazov, and Denis Avdeyev‚Äîwere detained and taken to a police precinct. They were later released without charge.\n\nThe Left Bloc‚Äôs VK page reports officers at the precinct had ‚Äúconversations‚Äù with the activists during which they repeatedly threatened them, demanding they testify against their Left Bloc comrades.\n\nIt was also noted that, during the search, a lawyer [sic] received messages from unknown accounts, messages supposedly written by the activists. They informed him they did not need his help.\n\nLeft Bloc linked the search of their headquarters and the interrogation of Zhuravlov with the ongoing campaign to boycott the upcoming Russian predisdental election. In particular, they mentioned a protest opposite the Nikulin Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard during which a banner emblazoned with the slogan ‚ÄúMarch 18: Tricks and Clowns‚Äù had been unfurled.\n\nWe assume that, as the presidential election approaches, the police and FSB want to intimidate everyone who has been calling for a boycott. They are justifiably afraid a low voter turnout is a danger to the political farce wrongly called an ‚Äúelection.‚Äù All activists involved in the election boycott are now in danger. We concede the outrageous instances of coercion could continue. However, no crackdown can force us to abandon the fight. Boycott the election! We cannot be intimidated! We cannot be forbidden!\n\n‚ÄîExcerpt from a pinned post on the Left Bloc‚Äôs VK page\n\n‚ÄúMarch 18: Russian presidential election. Dissenters in the cellars of the FSB.‚Äù Image from the VK page Popular Self-Defense\n\nThe attack on United Russia‚Äôs campaign headquarters in Khvorino occurred late on the evening of January 30. Three people, including a young woman, took part in the attack. The attackers broke a window in the office and tossed a lighted flare inside. One of attackers filmed the attack on video.\n\nAntifascists Yelena Gorban and Alexei Kobaidze were detained in the case on February 13, charged with vandalism under Article 214 Part 1 of the Russian Federal Criminal Code. The crime entails a maximum punishment of three months in jail and, consequently, does not stipulate that people accused of the crime be remanded in police custody until a verdict has been reached, according to Article 108 Part 1 of the Russian Federal Criminal Procedural Code, which covers incarceration. Nevertheless, both Gorban and Kobaidze were sent to the Temporary Detention Center, as Rechkalov has been now.\n\nHowever, forty-eight hours after they were apprehended, Gorban and Kobaidze were released on their own recognizance. Gorban had confessed her guilt, while it was reported Kobaidze had refused to testify, invoking his right not to incriminate himself under Article 51 of the Russian Constitution.\n\nThanks to Comrades AR and ZV for the heads-up.
