        "text": "Future twice Hero of the Soviet Union, one of the best Soviet aces, Grigory Andreyevich Rechkalov, was born on February 9 of the year 1920 in the village of Khudyakovo, Irbit district, in the most ordinary peasant family. At the end of 1937 of the year, on the Komsomol voucher, the young Rechkalov sent a military school of pilots to Perm, which he successfully graduated from in 1939. After being distributed, Gregory, in the rank of junior lieutenant, is sent to serve in the 55 th Fighter Aviation Regiment, which was given to the country by many famous pilots.\n\nAt the time when Rechkalov was in the 55th IAP, he was equipped with I-153, I-16 and UTI-4 aircraft and was part of the 1st KOVO high-speed bomber brigade. In 1940, the regiment was transferred to the 20th mixed aviation division, which was part of the Air Force of the Odessa Military District. The regiment was located on the outskirts of the small town of Balti, near the border with Romania.\n\n22 June 1941, Grigory Rechkalov arrived at the disposal of his regiment from Odessa, where he passed the medical flight committee, which wrote him off his flight work, the pilot had color blindness, he could hardly distinguish colors. The regiment had already had its first losses by that time, and combat work was in full swing. Reporting his arrival in the unit and writing off from the flights, Rechkalov immediately receives his first combat mission - on the I-153 fighter, take the documents to the next unit. On the conclusion of the doctors, the chief of staff of the regiment, Major Matveyev, did not even bother to pay his attention; there was no time for that. So unexpectedly for a fighter pilot, a very difficult task was solved, which tormented him all the way on the way to the regiment. In his first combat sortie, Grigory Rechkalov met with the enemy in battle, survived and was able to help out a comrade.\n\nIn the future, the fate of the pilot-ace will not just interfere with the case, which will give him the opportunity to return to the sky. A story about them would take too much time. It should be said only that after a month of war, having 3 downed German aircraft in his combat account, Rechkalov received a heavy wound in the leg and brought his Wounded X-NNUMX to the airfield, from where he was immediately forwarded to the hospital. In the hospital he is undergoing a very difficult operation on his right leg. This injury almost a year brought him down. In April, the 16 of the year, having escaped from the reserve air regiment, where the pilot retrained to the Yak-1942, he returned to his home, now 1, GvIAP.\n\nFrom this moment, a new stage of his flight career begins with the call sign \"RGA\". Ahead of him is waiting for retraining for the American fighter P-39 \"Air Cobra\", the terrible sky of the Kuban, the first Golden Star of the Hero, fierce fighting in the sky over the Iasi, the second Golden Star and at the end the sky of Berlin. He accommodated this segment and some confrontation with the famous Soviet ace Pokryshkin, which received an unexpected development after the end of the war and which had previously been preferred not to speak out loud.\n\nGrigory Rechkalov entered history, as the most productive ace, scored on the P-39 fighter \"Air Cobra\" most of all victories. By the end of the war, his Cobra had 56 stars, which symbolized the pilot's personal 53 and 3 group victories. Rechkalov was the second most effective Allied pilot. On his account was listed 61 personal victory and 4 group.\n\nAmong the German planes shot down by Grigory Rechkalov were:\n\nMe-30 fighter 109;\n\n5 Fighter FW-190\n\n2 fighter Me-110;\n\n11 Bomber Ju-87\n\n5 Bomber Ju 88\n\n3 transporter Ju 52\n\n2 bomber He-111\n\n2 light aircraft recon aircraft Fi 156\n\n1 fighter-spotter Hs 126\n\nConflict with Pokryshkin\n\nFor those who were interested in the history of the 55 th IAP, which later turned into the 16 th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, and subsequently the combat route of the 9 GwIAD, which since July 1944 commanded Pokryshkin, the strained relations between the divisional division and one of the best will be obvious Soviet aces twice Hero of the Soviet Union Grigory Andreyevich Rechkalov. At one time, the airline community even led to serious disputes on the expanses of the worldwide network, trying to understand the nature of the relationship between two famous Soviet aces. Many believed that the reasons lie in their air rivalry, while taking into account various aspects of their combat interaction.\n\nAce Pilots of the 9 Guards Aviation Division at Bell fighter P-39 “Air Cobra” G.А. Rechkalov. From left to right: Alexander Fyodorovich Clubs, Grigory Andreyevich Rechkalov, Andrey Ivanovich Labor and the commander of the 16 Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment Boris Borisovich Glinka.\n\nLike it or not, over time it seemed that the strained relations between the two pilots, which led to a serious conflict, were connected with their personal accounts of the downed aircraft. These assumptions were confirmed by Rechkalov’s relatives, in particular, his wife Anfisa and daughter Lyubov spoke about it. According to the daughter of the famous ace, after the end of the Great Patriotic War, Grigory Rechkalov, working with TsAMO documents, found 3 of his plane shot down in the 1941 year by Alexander Pokryshkin. Upon learning of this, he most likely called his immediate military commander and expressed everything he thought of him. The reaction of Alexander Pokryshkin did not take long to wait, after this conversation about Rechkalov was forgotten, and access to the TsAMO archives was closed for him. Even another Soviet ace Georgy Golubev, a former slave of Pokryshkin and friends during the war with Rechkalov, practically never wrote anything about his friend during the war in Rechnalov’s book, building all the narrative around Pokryshkin’s personality. According to Grigory Rechkalov's relatives, his opinion about the fact that 3 shot down the aircraft by him were attributed to Pokryshkin, he adhered to his death in the 1990 year.\n\nRechkalov’s personal combat account from 22.06.1941 of the year opens with the following downed enemy planes: 26 June in the Ungheni region he knocks down the Me-109 fighter, 27 June the fighter-corrector Hs 126 and 11 July bomber Ju 88. However, a month after the start of the war, Grigory Rechkalov gets a serious wound to the leg. During the departure of 26.07.1941 for support of the seven I-153, which took off for attack, Rechkalov was part of the escort of the escort fighters I-16. In the area of ​​Dubossary, upon reaching the target, a group of aircraft falls under intense German anti-aircraft fire. During the shelling, Rechkalov was injured, getting into the plane was so strong and precise that the fighter’s steering wheel pedal was broken in half, and the pilot’s foot was seriously damaged.\n\nDuring the absence of the pilot, many documents of the 55-IAP during the retreat from Odessa were destroyed. Rechkalovo’s “nullification of the account” is also possible because during its almost one-year absence the regiment moved to another unit, while information about the victories of the pilot remained in the documents of the 20-th mixed aviation division. The report on the combat work of the new 16 Guards Aviation Regiment was already compiled in the reserve regiment, so there was nowhere to take the data for 1941. It would be a convincing enough version, if it were not for the fact that many pilots of the 55-IAP, even despite the burning of staff documents, the downed planes were again recorded and only the “returnee” Grigory Rechkalov had to start his combat path from scratch. Anyway, until the end of his life, Rechkalov was convinced that the 3 victories of the 1941 of the year, which by some coincidence of circumstances fell at the expense of Pokryshkin, were withdrawn from his combat account.\n\nBell P-39 \"Airacobra\"\n\nMany years after the end of the war, Rechkalov was asked what he most valued in his P-39Q “Airacobra” fighter, on which he scored such a number of victories: the power of firing volley, speed, reliability of the engine, visibility from the cabin? On this question, Rechkalov noted that all of the above, of course, played a role, and these advantages are important, but in his opinion the most important thing in the American fighter was ... radio. According to him, the Cobra was excellent, rare for those times radio. Thanks to her, the pilots in the group could communicate with each other, as if by telephone. Who saw what in the air - immediately reported, so there were no surprises during the making of combat missions.\n\nIt is worth noting that Aero Cobra has come a long way, constantly modernizing and improving, including taking into account the requirements of the Soviet side. To assemble and fly around fighters who stayed in the USSR, a special group of the Air Force Research Institute was created, which took up a thorough study of the Aerokob flight performance and also the elimination of various identified defects. The first versions of the P-39D differed inflated characteristics. For example, the ground speed was only 493 km / h, and at the height of 7000 m. - 552 km / h, the maximum speed that the aircraft was able to develop at the height of 4200 m. Was 585 km / h. The higher the plane climbed, the lower its climb rate. At the height of 5000 meters it was equal to 9,6 m / s, but on the ground it was already 14,4 m / s. The fighter’s takeoff and landing characteristics were also quite high. The run of the aircraft was equal to 350 meters, and the run 300 meters.\n\nThe plane had a good range, which was equal to 1000 km. and could be in the sky for 3,5 hours. The fairly good performance of the fighter at low altitudes allowed him to effectively play the role of an escort vehicle for the Soviet Il-2 attack aircraft and protect them from German fighters, as well as successfully fight German dive bombers and work fairly confidently on ground targets. Over time, the characteristics of the fighter only grew and were brought to a very high level.\n\nIt is worth noting that the American engineers, designers and workers reacted with understanding to the proposals received from the Soviet Air Force, which concerned the improvement of the design of the fighter. Specialists of the company \"Bell\", arriving in the USSR, visited military units, tried on the spot to study the circumstances and causes of accidents. In turn, Soviet engineers and pilots were also seconded to the United States, where they helped Bell to improve the P-39 Airacobra fighter. Was connected to work on the aircraft and the largest center of Soviet aviation science - Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute. Zhukovsky known by the abbreviation TsAGI.\n\nWork on the improvement of the aircraft was largely based on improving the performance of the engine and reducing the take-off mass of the fighter. Already from the P-39D-2 version, a new Allison V-1710-63 engine was installed on the aircraft, the power of which, without switching on afterburner mode, was equal to 1325 hp. To reduce the take-off mass of the fighter, the ammunition for wing machine guns was reduced from 1000 to 500 ammunition per barrel, and for fuselage from 270 to 200 ammunition per barrel. The hydraulic system for reloading the gun was also completely removed from the aircraft; it could only be reloaded at the aerodrome. In addition, in the air, fuel and oil systems, units were mounted that were installed on P-40 “Kittyhawk” aircraft, which also entered the USSR under lend-lease.\n\nIn the 1942, the most massive and best modification of the P-39Q fighter went into production, Rechkalov flew the P-39Q-15 fighter. Unlike other models, on a fighter with a letter Q instead of 4 wing machine guns of rifle caliber were installed 2 large caliber 12,7-mm machine guns. Among the fighters of this series were special lightweight models, for example, the version of the P-39Q-10 was different in that the wing guns on it were completely absent.\n\nSources used:\n\nwww.airwiki.org/history/aces/ace2ww/pilots/rechkalov.html\n\nwww.airwar.ru/history/aces/ace2ww/pilots/rechkalov.html\n\nwww.airaces.narod.ru/all1/rechkal1.htm\n\nwww.vspomniv.ru/P_39\n\nYuferev Sergey\n\nOur news channels\n\nSubscribe and stay up to date with the latest news and the most important events of the day.\n\n49 comments\n\n\"Right Sector\" (banned in Russia), \"Ukrainian Insurgent Army\" (UPA) (banned in Russia), ISIS (banned in Russia), \"Jabhat Fatah al-Sham\" formerly \"Jabhat al-Nusra\" (banned in Russia) , Taliban (banned in Russia), Al-Qaeda (banned in Russia), Anti-Corruption Foundation (banned in Russia), Navalny Headquarters (banned in Russia), Facebook (banned in Russia), Instagram (banned in Russia), Meta (banned in Russia), Misanthropic Division (banned in Russia), Azov (banned in Russia), Muslim Brotherhood (banned in Russia), Aum Shinrikyo (banned in Russia), AUE (banned in Russia), UNA-UNSO (banned in Russia), Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people (banned in Russia), Legion “Freedom of Russia” (armed formation, recognized as terrorist in the Russian Federation and banned), Kirill Budanov (included on the Rosfinmonitoring list of terrorists and extremists), the International LGBT public movement and its structural divisions are recognized as extremist (decision of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation dated November 30.11.2023, XNUMX)\n\n“Non-profit organizations, unregistered public associations or individuals performing the functions of a foreign agent,” as well as media outlets performing the functions of a foreign agent: “Medusa”; \"Voice of America\"; \"Realities\"; \"Present time\"; \"Radio Freedom\"; Ponomarev Lev; Ponomarev Ilya; Savitskaya; Markelov; Kamalyagin; Apakhonchich; Makarevich; Dud; Gordon; Zhdanov; Medvedev; Fedorov; Mikhail Kasyanov; Dmitry Muratov; \"Owl\"; \"Alliance of Doctors\"; \"RKK\" \"Levada Center\"; \"Memorial\"; \"Voice\"; \"Person and law\"; \"Rain\"; \"Mediazone\"; \"Deutsche Welle\"; QMS \"Caucasian Knot\"; \"Insider\"; \"New Newspaper\""
