        "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe previous sixth report on the situation of Chechens in Russia covered events through October 2007[1]. There has long been plenty of material for preparing the next yearly report. However, when compiling it we face the problem of safety both for those whose destinies we describe and of those officers of our organization who work in Chechnya.\n\nOf course, the problem existed earlier as well, but the level of danger became such that we no longer risk publishing and presenting a report, which would openly tell about the situation in Chechnya. In the end of 2007 such a presentation already resulted in a storm of protests from the leadership of the republic.\n\nBesides, the applicants themselves dare to approach us or the law enforcement bodies more and more rarely, more and more of them refuse to tell about the violent acts committed against them, fearing persecution by the authorities. If they do come and tell about their grieves, they almost always prohibit us from making their stories public. Therefore, despite a decrease in abductions and extrajudicial executions, we cannot reliably determine how high the percentage of the information that we lose is. We still included one tragic case of applying to law enforcement bodies into the report (Appendix 1).\n\nDespite the drastic decrease in registered abductions of people by the law enforcement and in cases of tortures, the abductions, tortures and other violations of human rights nevertheless remain commonplace in the republic.\n\nBesides, in 2008 the numbers started to grow again, as shown in the tables below.\n\nIn 2009, the tendency didn't change (Appendix 2). From time to time we get information from anonymous sources. In March 2009, we learnt that starting from January law enforcement agencies frequently abducted residents of the Dargo village of Vvedensky district. Officers of Memorial Human Rights Center visited Dargo and ascertained that uniformed persons from the neighboring Nozhay-Yurt district regularly come to take young lads and sometimes even girls with them. As a rule, the abducted return home beaten up and intimidated in a few days. There were registered more than 20 of such cases.\n\nHowever, not all of them came back, and the fate of some abducted persons still hasn't been found out. Officers of Memorial Human Rights Center applied to the Chechnya Prosecutor's Office asking to perform a check of the abduction facts that they had learnt about. As a result of the check, it was established that unlawfully detained persons had been transported to Nozhay-Yurt where they had been kept and beaten up at the deployment of the patrol police regiment of the Chechen Republic Ministry of Interior named after A. Kh. Kadyrov.\n\nAt that, a division of the same regiment is deployed in the village. They don't participate in the abductions, but they don't prevent those from happening either.\n\nProsecutor's Office staff spoke to many residents of the Dargo village who had been subjected to unlawful detention and had been transported to Nozhay-Yurt. However, the victims, without refusing the facts, flatly refused any official witnessing. On the other hand, the unlawful detentions in Dargo stopped right after the beginning of the Prosecutor's Office check.\n\nIt is necessary to state that in Chechnya there has formed a totalitarian regime based on violence, delation, and fear. Even the seminars for teachers of small schools in mountain villages and for young human rights campaigners organized by Civic Assistance Committee raise suspicions. Participants of the seminars have to speak \"informally\" to law enforcement officers who probe to find out about seminar discussions with Moscow human rights defenders, but in particular with their foreign colleagues. The conversations include warnings and threats.\n\nIn summer 2008, the Chechen Republic President Ramzan Kadyrov said it was necessary to exert pressure on relatives of those who, in the opinion of the authorities, left for the mountains: \"…we have to make use of the Chechen customs. In the past such people were cursed and banished.\" After that there spread a practice of setting houses of suspects on fire. A few families left their villages after they had been threatened (Appendix 3).\n\nViolations of women's rights are additionally fostered by Vaynakh traditions (Appendix 4). Forced marriages, polygamy, marriages to underage girls are just a part of Russian law violations, against which there is currently no protection in Chechnya.\n\nFemale students of the Chechen State University, highly cultured modern young ladies, bitterly tell how they are forced to wear headscarves, which they had to accept after a few expulsions. Besides, they make them buy headscarves, and now also uniform, at a high price and of bad quality. The girls who try objecting to the constraints are treated rudely and without esteem by the guards, who may push them, take them by their hands, or lead them out of the building. The girls turn out to be isolated from the society, they cannot leave their houses in the evening, or meet at a public place. Students speak of a lawless situation, in which women who get abducted or married by their relatives without their consent find themselves. Not a single one of the female students we asked was prepared to live with a future husband who would also have other wives.\n\nAt the same time, Vaynakh traditions contain a number of mechanisms constraining arbitrariness towards women. Besides, in the Soviet times the women had by far more opportunities to engage the law enforcement system on their side.\n\nAccording to the RF President, the whole state system of Russia is corrupted from top to bottom[2], however, the level of corruption in Chechnya probably is a few times higher than the all-Russian averages, and the corruption here is virtually open. Job seekers pay to obtain a position at certain tariffs, and applicants to higher education institutions also pay for admission.\n\nOn April 16, 2009, the regime of counter-terrorist operation was repealed in Chechnya. This means that Chechnya will be authorized to become a destination of international flights, import goods from abroad, with the customs functioning at the airport. Federal troops in the territory of the Chechen Republic will be regrouped, and their soldiers will stop getting additional remuneration. Many of them are leaving Chechnya for that reason already now.\n\nHowever, there is a big question whether all of the above will favorably affect the observation of human rights in the Chechen Republic. And the answer to it is that, most likely, it won't.\n\n(See the \"Chronicle of violence\" by Memorial Human Rights Center on the violations of rights in Chechnya at http://www.memo.ru/hr/hotpoints/caucas1/rubr/2/index.htm).\n\nII. CHECHENS IN THE PENITENTIARY AND JUDICIAL SYSTEMS\n\nThe main topic of our report is the situation of Chechens in the judicial and penitentiary systems. Discrimination, humiliation, and violation of the right to life of Chechens in prisons, as well as the danger for any Chechen to find herself or himself on trial in court without any guilt are recognized by the Chechen leadership and in fact do comprise a large stratum of problems.\n\nThe situation of prisoners from Chechnya in Russian prisons\n\nInternational organizations monitoring the state of penitentiary systems in the world more than once equaled conditions of imprisonment in Russia to torture. In the 2007 report of Mr. V. P. Lukin, the RF Human Rights Ombudsman, the situation in prisons is also called \"close to torture\". At that, in recent years there were noticed certain positive changes in conditions of imprisonment: the food became better, the problem of overcrowding is getting resolved. However, these positive tendencies in no way touched upon the inhuman prison order, which is characterized by an increase in cruelty, sophistication in methods of humiliation and rude use of force, often without any rational foundation. One of reasons for bitterness is that the law enforcement bodies, including the penitentiary institutions, got a large influx of persons who had gone through the war in the Chechen Republic. The majority of them bring in skills coupled with traumatized mind and a charge of hatred acquired in the course of the warfare, which is particularly dangerous for those who recently were perceived as enemies.\n\nTherefore there is a category among the Russian convicts for whom imprisonment is connected to the direct threat to their life and health, and that is the Russian Chechens. As a rule, the Chechens who got their enormous terms as a result of fabricated charges are a priori considered dangerous special offenders who are inclined to violations of regime and to escape. If the prisoners or guards include those who served in federal troops in the territory of Chechnya during the warfare, their attitude towards the Chechens is easy to predict.\n\nThe majority of Chechen residents serve their term far from home. According to Article 73 of the RF Criminal Execution Code, as a rule the convicts serve their term in the limits of the federal subject where they resided or were convicted. However, the Chechen Republic until recently had no penal colony. Besides, in 2005, Article 73 underwent amendments, according to which the place of sentence completion is chosen by the federal penitentiary body, that is, the decision is made in Moscow[3]. Such crime categories include participation in illegal armed formations, banditry, infringement on the life of police officers, and some others, under which Chechnya residents as a rule get criminal convictions.\n\nThat makes it difficult for them to see their relatives and tell them about their situation. Besides, it is only possible for many Chechen residents to visit their imprisoned relatives thanks to a program of the Red Cross. At that, the visitors themselves often become subjected to persecution by the local police.\n\nHuman rights ombudsmen and non-governmental organizations get a lot of complaints about facts of humiliation and violence against Chechens. The discrimination on ethnic and religious grounds is also a part of daily life of the Russian penitentiary system.\n\nBelow is described a number of cases, about which we were informed in the course of the last year. A part of them is taken from applications to our offices, while others come from the information that we received from our colleagues[4].\n\nWe have received information from the colony Tomsk-3 of the city of Tomsk that convict Islam Isayevich Taipov serving his term there is subjected to incessant tortures and violence. Islam himself wouldn't be able to pass a word to his relatives: one of the convicts who were kept together with him learnt a note by heart and asked his own relatives to relate its contents to any Chechen who they would meet out of prison. It is necessary to underline that the colony, in which Taipov is held, is considered a \"red\" zone and is known for its cruelty, while its orders are customarily brutal. However, the way the administration and guards treat Islam is a rarity even for that place.\n\nRelatives of Islam communicated that on the very first day in the colony, on May 16, 2008, he was stripped naked, and then they hounded dogs on him. His body has scars from their bites. After that, they kept him naked in the disciplinary cell for 15 days and beat him daily. Islam says that he himself doesn't know how he survived.\n\nDuring their visit to Tomsk, relatives of Islam Taipov managed to meet the warden of the colony whom they told about their concern for Islam's health and asked not to oppress him, to which the warden answered that he was soon retiring and had no means to influence whatever was going on in the colony. The same, the inability to influence things, was stated by a troop commander.\n\nWhile visiting Taipov, his relatives (his mother and his father's sister) noticed that he still had wounds and scars from beating in the disciplinary cell. They tell that a strong young fellow became a skeleton in a few months spent in jail. They only were allowed to communicate to him via a monitor. As a robot, Islam repeated, \"I'm fine, I don't need anything.\" Next to him there sat an officer of the camp who controlled the conversation. Not a single word in the native tongue was spoken, as before the beginning of the conversation Taipov's relatives had been warned that they were permitted to speak only Russian.\n\nOnly the interference of human rights defenders relieved the situation of the young convict.\n\nRustam Taipov, an uncle of Islam convicted in the same case, is kept in the federal budget institution colony IK-11 of the Bor town in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. When Rustam was yet kept in Grozny prison right after conviction, two law enforcement officers entered his cell, mercilessly pummeled him, and claimed that when on zone, Rustam and everybody convicted in the same case would be killed.\n\nTaipov at first wasn't beaten in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast colony, but the pressure against him was present. There are testimonies that the order to be \"pressing\" Chechens (and Georgians after the Georgian events) came from Moscow, and if the officers of the colony would refuse to obey it, they would soon find themselves next to those whom they guarded. It is known that in the same colony there are former soldiers and police officers serving terms for crimes committed while in action in Chechnya during the warfare. Usually their crimes were violence against their own fellow soldiers and officers, as well as theft.\n\nOn April 21, an unknown woman called Civic Assistance Committee and told that according to her information in IK-11 penal colony there had been created intentionally hard conditions for convicts from Caucasus. They were beaten and humiliated, they were cruelly punished for no reason.\n\nNot surviving the suffering, convicts opened their veins and stomachs. They were kept in disciplinary cells for months, their walks were a sophisticated form of torture: the guards would let hundreds of people into a small court where they had to spend a long time in a jam.\n\nDuring meals, prisoners suffering from tuberculosis, hepatitis and AIDS were put at the same table as the others and fed from the same plates and dishes as people who were yet healthy. Illnesses were purposefully spread among the victims. As we constantly keep hearing, convicts from Chechnya got more than others did.\n\nThe Committee sent an inquiry to Mr. Yu. I. Kalinin, the head of the Federal Penitentiary Service, asking to verify the anonymous caller's information.\n\nIn ten days after that we were informed that the situation of the prisoners got better. The colony's managers were stirred, and the convicts were interrogated to determine from where the information came.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not always and not for long that our letters have such an effect.\n\nFarid Khayrulayevich Israilov, convicted for 5 years and serving his term in a colony in Tomsk, according to his mother, was subjected to beating, which resulted in broken ribs. After his mother's complaint, the warden of the colony again beat the prisoner and broke his nose. Following that, Israilov got 6 months of disciplinary room. He was deprived of a long visit of his mother, who was also humiliated when she came to the colony. She learnt about what was happening to her son from a former prisoner who was just released after finishing his term. He informed her that Farid was systematically beaten, and once was barely not suffocated with a towel.\n\nThree months later the mother still managed to meet her son. On his right leg she saw a haematoma. She understood that Farid's ribs were broken from his condition. However, the colony's medics didn't find any damage. A prosecutor's office investigation didn't result in anything either.\n\nUnfortunately, we have to acknowledge that in Russian prisons there has formed a special complex of executions applied to those professing\n\nIslam, particularly, to those who come from the North Caucasus, Chechens and Ingushs. Thus, it is virtually ubiquitous that those doing namaz are threatened with punishments from guards and administration for \"violations of regime\"; there is information that in some institutions the Muslim prayer is under open prohibition. The difference between penitentiary institutions in this regard reveals itself only in causes to such prohibition. Many Chechen prisoners tell that they are forced to eat exclusively pork dishes, without being given any other food. In some prisons it is even prohibited to read Koran. In one of the colonies, while Muslims are doing the morning namaz (prayer), they turn on frivolous \"chastushkas\" (folk style humorous rhymes) on the loud speakers. A Chechen who showed his indignation against this was sent to the disciplinary cell.\n\nIslam Said-Akhmedovich Batsiyev, born 1977, is kept in the penal colony USH-382/4 in the town of Pugachev of Saratov Oblast. His wife applied to Memorial Human Rights Center with a complaint about the cruelty, with which her husband is persecuted in prison: he gets beaten up, they don't let him do prayers requiring him to produce some official permission for namaz. She describes his condition as follows: \"I saw him beaten, with 2 left ribs broken, one leg swollen, the head was all bumps, the right kidney was damaged, he was all pale and weak.\" When he attempted to resort to the doctor of the colony, they simply took him away from the doctor's office, without providing him with any aid.\n\nBatsiyev is not given letters from home, they constantly put him into the disciplinary cell. After his wife's visit he was put into isolation ward for the term of 10 days. However, 2 months have passed since, and he is still there.\n\nWithout any formal reason, the management of the prison constantly threatens to transfer Batsiyev to the prison of Balashov town where he would be put into a barrack of strict regime as opposed to a regular zone.\n\nIn fall 2008, Memorial Human Rights Center received information that prisoner Rizvan Balavdiyevich Taysumov is also getting sadistically humiliated because of his religiousness. He was severely beaten up by other convicts during convict transportation under the order of the warden of Irkutsk prison. The beating took place at the so-called \"presskhata\" (a cell where specially chosen convicts torture the disobedient ones put in there). Torturing continued for two weeks. He was held in a cell in ropes and tortured in most sophisticated way. For more than a year now he has been kept in the underground of the penitentiary institution UV/8 of the town of Blagoveschensk in Amur Oblast without access to medical aid. They don't let his relatives meet him. After a wounding during the warfare Taysumov gets around on crutches.\n\nThose kept in the IK-1 colony of Nadvoitsy village of Segerzh district of Karelia are subjected to tortures and regular beating by armed gangs of supervisors and so called \"prison commandos\". Supervisors not only oppress Muslims, they prohibit them from praying. Prisoners tell that Mr. Fedotov, the colony warden, personally controls the process. Namaz is proclaimed \"a violation of order\" in the IK-1 concentration camp.\n\nThere were cases when a Chechen who asked for a permission to pray was offered to go to an Orthodox Church. There are great many complaints about seizures of Korans, prayer rugs, and subhahs, while making searches at the place of imprisonment. It often happens that prison officers intentionally humiliate religious feelings of prisoners.\n\nFor instance, on July 16, 2008, in IK-68/1 colony of the city of Tambov, officers belonging to a special police troop were beating up Chechens and Dagestanis in the presence of other prisoners, making them cry \"Allah Akbar!\" They used batons and electroshock weapons. As a result, prisoners had their ribs broken.\n\nM. L. Yusupkhadzhiyev, a prisoner of the Nizhny Tagil colony, complains that Muslims are disallowed from praying and threatened with words, \"we will make you wear crosses.\" Local priest father Alexander provoked a clash between Christians and Muslims by his insulting utterances regarding the Muslim religion.\n\nMuslims don't get a chance to pray. After the warden of the colony had noticed one of the prisoners doing namaz, he summoned him and told him that he wasn't going to see \"how Muslims stand on all fours in a barrack.\" There were 7 convicts of Slavic nationality who were converts to Islam in the camp, and the warden of the camp ordered for them all to be baptized.\n\nAt the end of 2008, Memorial Human Rights Center was approached by an Ingush writer Isa Kodzoyev seeking help. He told the human rights defenders that his son Zalmakh Kodzoyev serving sentence in the Udarny village of Zubova Polyana district in the Mordovian Republic (FGU IK-4, troop 7) was kept in unbearable conditions directly threatening not only his health, but also his very life.\n\nZalmakh Kodzoyev is gravely ill. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis and lungs decay, however as a prisoner he couldn't get the necessary medical aid. Besides, prior to imprisonment he suffered a serious craniocerebral trauma, and he is missing a large part of his frontal bone. Zalmakh was already hospitalized in a very grave condition a few times, however, at this stage doctors of the camp's hospital cannot provide him neither with an adequate treatment, nor with good meals. Therefore the condition of the prisoner becomes increasingly grave, and the colony administration doesn't permit to send him to another medical institution. At the same time, the very climate of Mordovia is highly detrimental to his illness. Relatives of Z. I. Kodzoyev petitioned on multiple occasions asking to transfer him to one of the penitentiary institutions of South Federal Region, but so far they only got refusals. Apart from tuberculosis, Zalmakh Kodzoyev who was sentenced to 24 years of strict regime colony suffers from consequences of dangerous craniocerebral trauma (in connection to which he had already been operated and had to undergo a repeat operation, but that became impossible because of his arrest). However, despite of this, starting from the first days after his appearance at the colony, the administration began to exert pressure on the new prisoner and to use severe measures to \"educate\" him. Parents of Kodzoyev who came to see him witnessed his extreme exhaustion; besides, there are testimonies that while under investigation and later during transportation to the colony their son became subject to beating and tortures.\n\nReplying to the inquiry made by Civic Assistance Committee, the Prosecutor's Office gave a detailed list of all Kodzoyev's illnesses together with data on medical aid he was provided with. The reply read as follows: \"the Republic Diagnostic Center carried out a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Medical opinion – after-effects of the craniotomy, cystic lesions and scars on both frontal lobes. Atrophic changes of the brain.\" (Appendix 5).\n\nIndependent medical experts came to the conclusion that Zalmakh Kodzoyev needed hospitalization, urgent medical treatment and an operation. However, the prison medics and administration believe that \"there are no medical contraindications to convict Z.I. Kodzoyev's serving his term\" in the Mordovian camp.\n\nViolence and humiliation in a specific colony are often systematically and purposefully used on a whole group of Chechen prisoners.\n\nIn the penal colony of Nizhny Tagil town of Sverdlovsk Oblast the cases of convicts from Chechnya and Ingushetia are marked by a red line, which means that the prisoner is inclined to plotting escape, without any ground for such a classification. The red line means additional hardening of the regime. Apart from other limitations, a convict should undergo a check every two hours.\n\nManagement uses all possible reasons to punish convicts from Caucasus, often punishing them without a reason. In the colony there exists a special \"educational troop\" where the convicts from Chechnya are kept as notorious offenders. The decision about troop closure was made in March or April of 2007, but it still functions.\n\nThere appeared a lot of information about special, comparatively more difficult situation of prisoners in colonies of strict regime in Irkutsk Oblast. There happen the same things as described above: beating, purposeful incarceration of prisoners under conditions that are detrimental to their health, tortures aimed at obtaining testimonies to be used for opening new criminal cases. Relatives of these people witness that such arbitrary rule is not perceived as anything special or illegal by the personnel of the colony. Chechens are persecuted with full understanding of the officers' impunity, openly threatened with \"living in a very own hell on earth\", with all measures being taken to fulfill these threats.[5]\n\nR. Kh. Magomadov, whose brother is serving a sentence in Penal colony 398/2 of Rostov city, recently informed Memorial Human Rights Center about a new danger that got poised over his relative already in the colony where he had been sent in 2002 after the conviction for 24 years of strict regime by Rostov Oblast court. The prisoner told that around September 20, 2008 he had been summoned to the office of operative troop where people who had introduced themselves as Federal Security Service officers had requested that he write a frank confession about his participation in illegal military formations. They had threatened that in the case of refusal they would use the same methods of investigation as earlier, during first investigation, when they had been obtaining a confession in the commitment of crimes, under which he had been convicted.\n\nBack then in 2001 when he was abducted, he was held for about twenty days in the temporary isolation ward of Shali town police office, where he was tortured and beaten up. They turned down the attorney who his relatives hired for him, after she had asked that a medicolegal examination be held upon seeing traces on the body and face of the client. (The information is drawn from the application of R. Kh. Magomadov to Memorial Human Rights Center).\n\nTestimonies of relatives are often the only chance for those who suffer from the arbitrary rule of prison authorities to appeal for aid at least in some way. The other source of information is the words of those who are released from the penitentiary institutions and speak up about what they had to face in prison.\n\nIn March 2009, Memorial Human Rights Center was approached by Norwegian human rights defenders who had become aware of violations of rights of convict I. I. Dashayev, born on September 5, 1982, who served his term in the institution IR 99/11 of Zvezdny village in the town of Surgut, Khanty-Mansiysk autonomous region. They had been called by an unknown, possibly calling from prison, and informed that Dashayev was constantly tortured, and his life was in danger.\n\nColleagues passed to us the telephone number, from which they had been called, but our attempts to contact the caller were futile. However, in a short while we received a call from an unidentified telephone number. The caller who refused to give his name informed us that I. Dashayev was beaten up constantly and severely from the day of his appearance at IR 99/11 colony on February 2, in the opinion of the caller, purely on ethnic grounds and not because of any order violations.\n\nMs. S.A. Gannushkina approached the Director of the Federal Penitentiary Service Yu. I. Kalinin asking to take prompt measures to normalize the situation of Ilyas Isayevich Dashayev. The reply came on April 2, 2009. As usual, all violations towards Dashayev were denied, and they communicated that he was a member of the section of discipline and order of the troop, i.e. agreed to collaborate with administration and look after other convicts. Human rights defenders consider these sections to be the most disgusting mechanism of oppressing some convicts by others.\n\nIt is virtually impossible to prove anything when applying to the Prosecutor's Office.\n\nThere are cases when the whole investigation is falsified, starting with medicolegal examination.\n\nIt is often not only useless, but also dangerous for prisoners to complain to higher Russian instances. The result of visiting prisoners and arranging media coverage often is increased pressure.\n\nIn November 2008, a sister of Turpal-Ali Abdrakhmanov, the resident of Gudermes town who served his sentence in a colony of strict regime in the city of Krasnoyarsk, applied to an office of Memorial Human Rights Center.\n\nIn August 2008, he petitioned General V. K. Shayeshnikov, the head of the Federal Penitentiary Service in Krasnoyarsk region.\n\nAfter meeting him, Turpal-Ali started having problems. He was removed from his work and locked up. Senior lieutenant Vaganov rudely cursed Abdurakhmanov in front of other prisoners and told him that he was getting transferred to Norilsk. In November 2008, Turpal-Ali called his sister and told her that he was in Norilsk, speaking in Russian and very briefly, and one could hear that there was somebody near him and the conversation was under control. The sister called Memorial and said that she received a letter with a new address from Turpal-Ali and sent him some parcels, but they were returned. The relatives of the prisoner don't know what to do next. Later he called them again, but parcels still do not reach him.\n\nThe right of prisoners to see an attorney is also violated.\n\nCommon wife of convict Shamil Khatayev, serving his sentence in FBU LIU-7 (medical correctional facility) of the Polevoy village in the Kirsanov district of Tambov Oblast, told it to Ms. Svetlana Gannushkina that her husband had asked for an attorney to be sent to him promptly to prepare a supervisory complaint and also to prevent him from being further humiliated. On March 10, 2009, attorney V. A. Shaysipova, a member of Tambov's office of the Migration Rights Network, came to the colony and, after producing her certificate of employment and her order, asked the deputy warden of the penal institution lieutenant colonel Ye. A. Demenkov and the warden lieutenant colonel V. A. Yurkov to arrange her visit to the prisoner. However, she was refused, in violation of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the Law \"On the activity of attorneys and the institution of attorney in the Russian Federation\", and the RF Criminal Execution Code.\n\nThe ground for refusal to the attorney was the consideration of the management of LIU-7 that she didn't present materials showing that she had made an agreement for provision of legal aid with Khatayev proper. The warden of LIU-7 V. A. Yurkov requested an official confirmation of Ms. Shaysipova's intention to really provide Sh. E. Khatayev with legal aid instead of, as he put it, \"just looking at him\". Mr. V. A. Yurkov said, \"We already had such facts when attorneys just came to look at a convict, to make sure he was all fine. Khatayev is all fine, he doesn't want to see an attorney.\" The latter was a direct lie.\n\nIn the course of an hour and a half Mr. V. A. Yurkov and Mr. Ye. A. Demenkov along with a major who later joined them and presented himself as the head of security service, simply humiliated the poor woman, provoked a scandal, threatened her with administrative charges, and said they would use physical force and throw her out of their territory, if she wouldn't leave voluntarily.\n\nThe attorney believes that the management of LIU-7 intentionally violated the constitutional right of Khatayev to defense, being afraid of publicity to be given to objectionable facts regarding Shamil Khatayev who was put into the disciplinary cell.\n\nZaurbek Yunusovich Talkhigov is subject to cruel treatment in the Republic of Komi. After an attempt to help set free hostages of Dubrovka he was sentenced to 8,5 years of incarceration in a colony of strict regime on charges of \"assisting terrorists and taking hostages.\" The story of his conviction has already been described in the report of the Migration Rights Network \"On the situation of residents of Chechnya in the Russian Federation June 2004 – June 2005.\" Zaurbek came to the theater center following a call by RF State Duma deputy Aslanbek Aslakhanov, and it was also from him that he got the cellular number of Movsar Bayrayev, the leader of terrorists. Zaurbek called him standing next to Federal Security Service officers and tried to make Bayrayev set foreign citizens free. That same day he was arrested for an attempt to assist terrorists. On September 9, 2003, the cassation instance represented by the judicial board on criminal cases of the RF Supreme Court left his sentence unchanged. The text of the sentence directly mentioned that, when Zaurbek Talkhigov came to the theater center, \"he had no intention to assist terrorists.\" Talkhigov has lodged a claim with the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nIn summer 2005, administration of the colony applied to make the regime of Talkhigov's incarceration stricter. He was charged with regular violations of regime.\n\nViolations included, for instance, addressing a guard with a singular pronoun (which is a custom in Zaurbek's native land); refusal to eat with a dirty spoon, which, according to a guard, was specially brought from tuberculosis barrack; refusal to execute the order \"lights-out\" (as he hadn't completed his prayer at that moment); showing in a formation in new clothes without stripes (he was only given the stripes a minute before the formation time, without thread and needle).\n\nEven before the application was made, Zaurbek received and served disciplinary punishments for all of the above transgressions.\n\nOn August 11, 2005, in Syktyvkar there took place a court session. The decision made was to move Talkhigov for two years from colony to prison where he was treated cruelly during all of his stay. He was beaten up, they put him to disciplinary cell on multiple occasions.\n\nIn June 2006, Zaurbek felt seriously ill and asked to see a doctor. The results of analyses showed that he was ill with a serious infection, hepatitis-C, which he contracted while in prison. However, as a matter of course, it didn't affect the conditions, under which he served his sentence.\n\nAfter the return to colony, to the severe climate of the Republic of Komi, his illness started progressing again. In 2007, they sent him to a hospital for an operation, but the doctors refused to do it.\n\nIn December 2008, Zaurbek got unlucky again: they refused him a long visit of his mother and sister who had already arrived. Zaurbek had the right to the visit already since spring, but his relatives could only save the money and come in the end of the year. At the day of their arrival Zaurbek was punished for smoking in a place where it was prohibited. They put him in a barrack of strict regime (usually a poorly heated space) for three months. It was for the first time that Talkhigov tried to excuse himself and asked not to punish him with the cancellation of the visit. But the repentance didn't help, and the humiliating punishment was left in force.\n\nIn February 2009, an attorney invited by Memorial Human Rights was sent to Zaurbek. The attorney described his bad physical condition and was ready to petition against his being kept in a barrack of strict regime. However, the reaction of the administration and visitors from the Federal Security Service was such that Zaurbek turned down the attorney's help fearing for his relatives' lives.\n\nVery recently, a failure ended the attempt of Z. Murtazalieva, a convict on fabricated charges, and her attorney for her to get released on parole.\n\nThe court of Zubova Polyana district in the Mordovian Republic considered eight applications for early release on parole. Seven of them were granted. The only refusal was to Zara Murtazaliyeva, convicted in 2005 on the charge of terrorist act attempt in the Okhotny Ryad trade center.\n\nIn March 2004, Zara, trying to hide from the Chechen war in Moscow, met two Russian women who had converted to Islam in a mosque. It happened during a large-scale anti-Chechen company, when those who came from the North Caucasus were blamed as the worst sinners. Security services spied on the mates. And Zara unwisely spoke to the mates about the injustice of warfare in Chechnya.\n\nZara was detained for the lack of registration, but then they \"found\" explosives in her bag at the police station. Moscow City court sentenced her to 9 years of imprisonment. It has been publicly spoken many times that the case of Murtazaliyeva is full of discrepancies. The President of Chechnya R. Kadyrov also claimed that the girl was innocent. And now, after almost five years after the arrest, when Zara served more than half of the term, she tried to get released early on parole. According to Murtazaliyeva, there is no way she can clear the penalties she got from the administration of the colony, \"not a single stimulation I receive for my work is approved by the management.\" In September 2005, Murtazaliyeva was reported as \"keeping a skirt of undetermined kind\", eight months later they reported her for \"making her bed inaccurately\". Later, as the term for early release approached, the penalties became more frequent. \"She didn't wake at the 'reveille' signal\", \"violated the standard for closing\", \"quarreled with a convict\", \"didn't come to the canteen for the intake of food\". There were 13 penalties altogether. It is needless to say that Murtazaliyeva cannot appeal against these penalties in court order. She doesn't have the money for attorneys who could do such a thankless work.\n\nAttorney M. Morozova who defended Zara on the commission from Memorial Human Rights Center asked the court to take into account that nobody suffered as a result of Murtazaliyeva's actions, that there existed a special solicitation about her from the government of Chechnya, and that she was guaranteed a job in the office of the Chechen ombudsman in Grozny. However, the reference for Murtazaliyeva from the colony administration (\"registered as a terrorist, indifferent to the life of the troop, admits conflicts with administration\") and, mainly, the ethnicity of the prisoner and the nature of the article, under which she was convicted, proved to be the most important. After such an evaluation it became clear that nobody is going to release Zara. Judge E. Kuzmin refused an early release on parole to Murtazaliyeva. Commenting on this decision, her attorney said symbolic words, \"The judge just couldn't act differently. They don't release early under such articles.\" In the course of that day seven other applications were considered, and they were all granted, though the articles were no less grave than the one, under which Murtazaliyeva was sentenced. Sale of narcotics, robbery, assault causing heavy bodily harm did actually take place, and still women who committed them could count on mercy and alleviation of their punishment and were set free. Zara Murtazaliyeva stayed to serve her sentence, which she received for her alleged intention to commit a crime.\n\nThe illegal interference into the right of prisoners to appeal to the European Court is characteristic for the whole Russian prison system. According to the effective legislation, complaints to the Court are not a part of correspondence that is subject to examination by administration of the institutions of confinement (Article 21 of the Federal law No. 103 \"On the detention of suspects and those charged with crimes\" of July 15, 1995). These amendments undoubtedly protect the right of prisoners to appeal to the European Court. But in practice it is clearly not enough for prisoner applicants to European Court to avoid pressure and persecutions on the part of their institution's administration.\n\nOn July 30, 2008, Shamsudi Said-Khuseynovich Abdulkadyrov serving sentence in IK-18 colony of the Murmashi village in Murmansk Oblast started a hunger strike. He protested against unjust attitude to him in the prison management suspecting that it had to do with his having lodged a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights. Abdulkadyrov was punished for slightest causes and without them, and, on April 24, he was severely beaten up by prison officers, at that the warden was among those who humiliated him.\n\nShamsudi Abdulkadyrov, born 1981, underwent the amnesty procedure in 2003, however, on January 16, 2004, he was arrested and convicted by the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic to 17 years of strict regime under a number of RF Criminal Code articles including murder. Abdulkadyrov pleaded not guilty and said in court that he copped out during investigation because he was tortured. The court didn't believe the defendant. In 2005, Abdulkadyrov appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, certain that he would be able to prove his case. In 2006, his innocence of the murder was confirmed after they found the weapon, which made a mortal shot. Nevertheless, nothing changed for Abdulkadyrov.\n\nOn March 21, 2008, Shamsudi was transferred from usual conditions of incarceration to strict ones, as he was acknowledged to be a persistent violator of regime.\n\nTogether with him there was put Eugeny Viktorovich Timoshin who is also an applicant to the European Court since March 2005. While talking to a Migration Rights officer, he noticed that Abdulkadyrov was not only constantly isolated in his camera, but they also created a vacuum around him, punishing everybody who contacted him.\n\nTimoshin and two other Muslims, V. B. Spitsin and R. Aslanov, joined the hunger strike started by Sh. Abdulkadyrov. They were on strike till August 20, 2008. The reason for this was not only the persecution of those who complained to the European Court, but also the prohibition to do namaz and read Koran.\n\nAll four of them were transported to hospital in stretchers. By the end of the hunger strike they couldn't even talk, being completely weakened.\n\nThe conditions in hospital weren't as hard as in prison proper, and Shamsudi Abdulkadyrov felt better, but there was no guarantee that lawless actions against him and other participants of the hunger strike wouldn't be repeated.\n\nMedical assistance is difficult to obtain both during transportation and in prison. There are cases when even four months after arrival the prisoner's location remains unknown, and then human rights defenders have to step in. For instance, a prisoner from Chechnya cannot get a leg prosthesis in one of the colonies.\n\nThose whose term is about over are particularly vulnerable. In some colonies they create favorable conditions for law enforcement officers who force those who are already preparing for freedom to confess to committing some undetected crime by torture. Such vicious practice flourished in Chernokozovo before spring 2008 where such prisoners were also forced to pay for the possibility to get released on time.\n\nProvocations of other prisoners aiming at convicts from the Chechen Republic are not always suppressed by the guards. There have already been established a number of cases when Chechen prisoners of Russian prisons perished. Their relatives are afraid to demand investigations of death cases, which can quite possibly turn out to be murders.\n\nFor instance, on July 1, 2007 in Murmansk oblast, Azamat Uspayev, 22 years old, a young and absolutely healthy person, fell from the first floor for unknown reason and died from the traumas (two weeks prior to his death he sent a complaint to the European Court of Human Rights).\n\nIn fall 2007, the corpse of Mr. Bichkarev, a resident of Shelkovskoy district of the Chechen republic, who also died in prison under strange circumstances, was brought to his relatives.\n\nIn Udmurtia, Islam Shepovich Serbiyev, born 1977, was beaten up so severely that he was sent to the medical unit.\n\nDzhamalay Shamkhanovich Aliyev, born 1979, was sentenced to 13 years under Article 208 and Article 209 of the RF Criminal Code in 2003. He began the completion of his sentence in Vladikavkaz, however, after the terrorist act committed in Beslan, he was again sent to investigation ward where he was kept for three months and then transported to the city of Syktyvkar. In a month after his arrival, he was sent to investigation ward one more time, this time in the village Verkhny Chev in Syktyvkar, in the institution OS-34/1. In accordance with the law, the term of incarceration in investigation wards cannot exceed one year and should be prolonged every two months by the decision of a prosecutor of high rank.\n\nIt also greatly facilitates committing crimes against prisoners that though according to the law officers of the Federal Penitentiary Service have to inform relatives about the place of a prisoner's incarceration within four months, cases are frequent when no information about prisoners comes in a very long time. In this time crimes are often committed against the prisoner in transportation prisons, there are particularly many complaints regarding colonies of Chelyabinsk and Irkutsk.\n\nIn such cases it is difficult for victims to file a claim with the prosecutor's office also because visible traces of beating abate in time, while serious medical examinations are not accessible. Impunity lets administrations of colonies abuse power, punishing for a long time for minor violations of regime, as a result of which some prisoners don't leave disciplinary cells for months or even years.\n\nIsmail Amelyevich Tatayev spent almost two years in solitary confinement at the FGU IK-9 colony of Volgograd Oblast. During all of this time his relatives barely managed to obtain short visits to the prisoner, at that the administration of the colony used all possible means to put obstacles in their way.\n\nAnswering the inquiry by Ms. S. A. Gannushkina to the Prosecutor General's Office, the head of the division on supervision of criminal sentences completion lawfulness replied that he didn't see grounds for repealing measures of Tatayev's punishment.\n\nThe practice of refusing visits from relatives is especially painful for those who can only visit from far away. Nebi Tatayeva, Ismail's mother, came to visit him for the first time in June 2007.\n\nIn the beginning of November 2007, they authorized a two days visit. She came to visit the son with two daughters of Ismail, but was one day late for the indicated date, so the visit only lasted one day.\n\nThe attorney of the Migration Rights Network who tried to help Ismail sent him a certified letter with blanks of warrants for attorneys of the European Court, which he had to fill in and sign. I. Tatayev indeed received the blanks, signed them and gave the letter with warrants to the deputy warden for mailing. However, the warrants never came back to the lawyer. During a visit, his mother could secretly bring in the blanks and bring them out filled in and signed. In January 2009, Ismail called his mother's cellular phone and told her that they transferred him to a troop of strict regime.\n\nDuring the last visit the mother was told that the son may call her on 14's day of every month and she passed phone cards costing 1,5 thousand rubles to him. Since then there was only one call.\n\nIn the phone conversation that lasted two minutes, Ismail told to his mother that in March he would get permission for a visit of 4 days from his relatives. In almost two years at this colony he obtained a long visit only once and only for one day. Nebi saved money for the visit to her son for a long time and, without getting a repeat call and seeing that March was at its end, she went to the colony together with Ismail's wife Makka and three small daughters (the eldest of whom had 6,5 years of age). Upon arrival to the colony, she learnt that Ismail was punished and he wouldn't get a visit.\n\nA visit of 2 hours was still granted after Nebi lost her consciousness because of the nervous pressure. She used the occasion to pass a parcel to the son, but he never got anything of what she passed. The next 2 hours visit took place in August of the same year, and again Tatayev didn't get the parcel.\n\nAccording to his mother, Ismail's health is in horrible condition, his heart, liver, and kidneys are all diseased. For half a year he ate only bread, which he was given together with the food, because the food was made with pork fat.\n\nDuring her visits, the mother usually examines the body of her son to see the traces of violence. This time the son refused to take off his coat, and she thought that he had traces of injuries on his body. While visiting, relatives are allowed to bring food to convicts, but they didn't let Ismail take anything and didn't even take the parcel. A transfer of 1000 rubles sent by Ismail's mother on January 24 was never received.\n\nThe case of Tatayev is not singular. Volgograd colonies are among the leaders in violating convicts' rights. Convicts informed human rights defenders that R. B. Daudov born in Urus-Martan village and serving his term at one of the colonies was put into a cell from his first days in the colony and spent there already a few years, being subject to tortures. Relatives don't come to see him, though he has many. Convicts asked to help him.\n\nWe would like to put a special emphasis on the story of Zubayr Zubayrayev, which became known all around the world and drew attention also because Zubayr was naive enough to believe that peace came to Chechnya and returned to the native land from abroad.\n\nZubayr Zubayrayev was born and grew up in the Tolstoy-Yurt village not far from Grozny. He was the fifth child in a family, the only boy among five sisters. When Zubayr was 14, his father died in an accident. Zubayr was left the only man in the household. Now a married man and provider of his mother and sisters, he took part in neither of the two Chechen wars. His family participated in antimilitary actions and pickets, and sometimes their house hosted refugees from Grozny, peaceful men, both Russians and Chechens.\n\nHowever, even this could become a serious ground for suspicions on the part of security services. Many cases are known where they arrested people as militants and terrorists without any cause whatsoever. Zubayr was informed a few times that he got \"blacklisted\", and his relatives insisted that he leave. In Austria there live relatives of Zubayrayevs, and Zubayr and his wife Madina moved in with them in 2004.\n\nThey lived there for a little bit more than year. In 2006, Zubayr learnt that his mother was diagnosed with cancer and that she needed to go to treatments regularly, while there was nobody to bring there the old woman who lived in a village for all of her life. Zubayr, his wife and a small son born in Vienna went to the homeland. Possibly, they considered that suspicions that made them leave were no longer topical, and now hardly anybody would think of laying farfetched accusations against Zubayr.\n\nIndeed, at first nobody bothered the family. The mother of Zubayr grew better, and, after a prolonged treatment in hospital in the city of Rostov, she came back home.\n\nHowever, on February 23, 2007, Zubayrayev went missing. For three months his relatives were looking for him and finally found him in the district police office of the Groznensky district.\n\nAs Malika, Zubayr's sister[6], tells, it was already there that he became subject to torture, \"they would pull out his nails, torture him with electric shock, trying to get information about some fighters, a confession that he knew them.\" Besides, he was constantly threatened with new tortures, and if he wouldn't confess to crimes made up by the investigation, his relatives might also get persecuted. They also threatened the pregnant wife of Zubayr who got into hospital after his disappearance.\n\nIn the beginning of June 2007, Zubayr told to his sisters who managed to get to see him that he had defamed himself, having given in to severe pressure. The Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic sentenced him to 5 years imprisonment on charges of infringement on law enforcement officer's life (Article 317 of the Criminal Code) and illegal possession of weapons (Article 222). Zubayrayev was transported form Chechnya to the 25th colony in Volgograd Oblast (Frolovo village).\n\nThings that happened to him subsequently can hardly be called tortures, for it was tortures, which didn't have any specific goal. It was more than once that he became subject to beating. Officers of the colony simply burst into the cell of Zubayrayev and started to beat him, including striking him on the head with plastic bottles filled with water till he would lose consciousness. Zubayr who was a strong and healthy man before his arrest began to suffer from frequent pain in the heart, kidneys, and liver. In a few months they virtually turned him into an invalid.\n\nZubayr complained against the deputy warden of the colony who was among those who beat him. A criminal case was brought in at the fact of serious bodily assault. Zubayrayev was transferred to the colony 9 of Volgograd City wherefrom they sent him to LIU-15, a medical penal colony. However it was also here that they continued to beat Zubayr up. In particular, now they wanted him to write a confession that his words about tortures that he had undergone in the Russian prisons were a lie. Relatives of other prisoners, having learnt about how he was tortured, called his sister and said to her, \"If you don't take him from here soon, there will remain nothing but a dead body.\"\n\nMalika and Fatima Zubayrayevs were allowed to see their brother only on the condition that they would make him sign the required paper. Upon seeing Zubayr, they were amazed at his condition. \"Zubayr was maimed to the degree that he couldn't move on his own, and recognized us only by voice,\" Malika told to a journalist. \"When I asked why my brother was in such a condition, officers of the colony answered that Zubayr who before his imprisonment never suffered from epilepsy had fallen twice during an attack and damaged his head.[7]\"\n\nMedia started covering things happening to Zubayr.\n\nA group of human rights defenders visited Volgograd on November 9-10, 2008, in order to establish facts. Mr. Imran Ezhiyev, the chair of the North Caucasus division of the Society for Russian-Chechen Friendship said the following after visiting Zubayrayev[8]: \"I have met him thrice and understood that he isn't provided with the necessary medical aid. The wounds that have been inflicted on him by officers of the colony fester. Zubayr doesn't get the necessary bandaging.\" At the same time, a representative of the administration claimed that the best conditions had been created for the convict Zubayrayev, however, he harmed himself by taking a run and hitting the wall with his head, as well as by rubbing salt into his wounds, all this in order to get a transfer to Chechnya (Appendix 6). \"All of this is certainly untrue,\" Mr. Ezhiev said. Among those who visited Zubayr there was Mr. Alikhan Soltakhanov, a board member of the Good without Borders International Foundation, a coordinator of medical programs and surgeon orthopedist. He described Zubayrayev's condition as follows: \"He looked extremely exhausted, and barely could move around. He literally was emaciated and morally drained. All the left side of his face from the forehead to the chin was a huge haematoma, at that, the face was distorted and swollen and virtually lost sensitivity on the left, that is a paresis of the facial nerve occurred, speaking in medical terms... His arms looked as if they tore pieces of meat out of them using pincers. There was a festering wound on his right knee. Zubayr told that the wound was inflicted with a screwdriver, which they used to virtually pierce the knee. Both shins had subcutaneous wounds about 5 cm in diameter, which already started to heal and with due care, bandaging with ointment, could heal very fast, but the care wasn't really there… They began changing bandaging only upon our arrival. Both of his feet had perforating wounds about 0,5 cm, also festering, they perforated his feet with nails. As a result of all this Zubayr could barely move around leaning against a crutch, which they were, as I knew, trying to take away from him, since he allegedly didn't need it, much as he couldn't walk at all without it. His general condition was grave. Constant giddiness and losses of consciousness were a sign of extremely serious brain concussion[9].\"\n\nThe fate of the prisoner from Chechnya attracted attention of both Russian and western human rights defenders (a picket in Novopushkinsky Square in November 2008, statements of Amnesty International in Zubayrayev's defense[10], etc.). However, neither the reaction of international community, nor publications in media, nor the above-mentioned visit of Mr. I. Ezhiyev to the colony changed the convict's situation. After the departure of human rights defenders Zubayrayv was again put into disciplinary cell.\n\nOn February 11, 2009, a press conference with the participation of Mr. Imran Ezhiyev, Ms. Yelena Sannikova, Ms. Svetlana Gannushkina, and Mr. Lev Ponomaryov took place in Moscow. In the course of the press-conference there were demonstrated photographs taken during a visit to Zubayrayev. One could see marks from nailing his feet to the floor. Mr. Ezhiyev added that Zubayrayev was all bandaged, with bandages soaked with pus. The head of Zubayrayev grew in size because of getting beaten with batons.\n\nA sister of Zubayrayev told that the management of the colony threatened to finish Zubayrayev off, if he doesn't stop complaining to human rights defenders. She herself started getting threats both from law enforcement officers in Chechnya proper and from those working in the Volograd office of the Federal Penitentiary Service.\n\n\"We have to organize a committee including a representative of the RF Human Rights Ombudsman, officers of the Chief Office of the RF Federal Penitentiary Service, members of the Public Chamber's expert committee on human rights in the Chechen Republic, Volgograd human rights defenders and representatives of the prosecutor's office,\" said Mr. Imran Ezhiyev. \"This committee should question both convicts and officers of LIU-15 who is connected to the situation around Zubayr.\"\n\nThe tortures temporarily stopped after the press conference. However, on March 13 there was taken a court decision following a petition from the administration of the colony on the transfer of Zubayrayev to prison for further sentence completion, i.e. the conditions of his incarceration were made stricter.\n\nThis caused serious fears for the life of Zubayrayev. On March 17, Mr. Vladmir Lukin was approached both personally and in writing by Ms. Svetlana Gannushkina who referred to witnesses and asked Mr. Lukin to do everything possible to prevent a tragic development of the events. In her address, Ms. Gannushkina proposed to accept the suggestion of Mr. Imran Ezhiyev about sending representatives of the Ombudsman's office to Volgograd and expressed readiness to participate in this visit.\n\nIn reply, the Ombudsman's office sent a copy of colony administration's letter where Zubayrayev is charged with self-injury and self-aggression. \"In each case of autoagression Z. I. Zubayrayev was provided with necessary medical aid,\" asserted the letter.\n\nOn March 22, Memorial Human Rights Center hired attorney Mussa Khadisov for representing Zubayrayev, and the attorney immediately left for Volgograd to make sure one more time that the convict was subject to torture. Attorney Khadisov filed a complaint against Zubayrayev's transfer to prison.\n\nThe arrival of Mr. Mussa Khadisov turned out to be very timely. Ms. Yelena Maglevannaya, a journalist and human rights defender who did a lot to inform the public about Zubayrayev's situation, started having problems. On March 20, the administration of LIU-15 filed a claim against her defending its honor and business reputation.\n\nOfficers of the colony sought compensation for damage to their business reputation first in the size of 5 and then 500 thousand rubles, accompanied by an apology. The text that in their opinion should be read by Yelena Maglevannaya begins as follows, \"Officers of the criminal execution system serve to the state, and this service requires courage, endurance, restraint and complete devotion from them…\"\n\nOn March 26, 2009, Mr. Mussa Khadisov, the attorney of Zubayr Zubayrayev spoke at the first hearing of Ye. Maglevannaya's case in Kirov district court of Volgograd. He confirmed that when he had seen his client shortly before the hearings there had been a lot of marks of torture on his body, particularly on the legs. Two Chechen human rights defenders from the Center on Human Rights at the office of the Chechen ombudsman, Ms. Roza Shamiyeva and Ms. Madina Astamirova, confirmed that the current warden of the colony LIU-15 had served at the investigation ward in Chernokozovo, notorious for tortures of the detainees[11].\n\nThe attitude towards Zubayrayev in particular and to the Chechens in general of a doctor, assistant to the head of regional office of the Federal Penitentiary Service on the observation of human rights in penal institutions and colony warden ad interim is described in the chapter \"On the Image of the Enemy in Mass Consciousness\" of the present report. These are persons whose opinions and past should be investigated into at appointment to their posts, and they cannot be objective neither to Zybayrayev, nor to any other person who will dare to act in his defense.\n\nCourt hearings continued on May 12 and May 14. The court flatly denied it to representatives of Maglevannya to call Zubayr Zubayrayev himself to witness at the hearing, possibly, because the very sight of the exhausted person would turn down all claims of colony officers that he hadn't been subject to any tortures. During the hearings, the plaintiff's side demonstrated some video recordings, allegedly confirming that Zubayrayev injuries were self-inflicted. However, witnesses claimed they could see nothing like that in the recordings. Despite that, the court accepted the claim and sentenced Ms. Yelena Maglevannaya to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.\n\nHowever, the imprisonment of Zubayr is still tumultuous. His relatives were informed that they put a person into his cell who was convinced that relatives of Zubayr were guilty of the death of his father. The neighbor is a constant threat. But that's not the end of it all. On April 12, the relatives learnt again that Zubayr was getting beaten up in prison. The local lawyer who they commissioned, Mr. Edal-Bek Magomadov, asked for a permission to visit the client. He was only allowed a visit on April 23. As a consequence of his visit, he petitioned the warden of LIU-15:\n\n\"On April 23, 2009, when visiting convict Z. I. Zubayrayev in the colony LIU-15 of the city of Volgograd I found traces of beating, haematomas, and bruises on the body of Z. I. Zubayrayev. The worst bruises were located in the area of shoulders, breast, and ribs. The lower back in the area of the waist also has traces of beating. The indicated bodily injuries were inflicted on convict Z. I. Zubayrayev on April 10 and 12, 2009… I asked for the doctor or warden of the institution to be called to the meeting room in order to have the above-mentioned injuries recorded, to which there was given a flat refuse.\"\n\nThe story of Zubayr Zubayrayev continues.\n\nThe information about cruel treatment of prisoners comes in almost daily.\n\nOn May 6, 2009, we received the following letter of a Chechen refugee from colleagues in Norway about the above-mentioned Rizvan Taisumov:\n\n\"I have emergency business. I have received information that some lad Rezvan Taysumov who is now kept in prison is being transferred to a different camp where there have already happened murders of those who come from the same parts as I.\n\nEven here they beat him on various farfetched causes, and now they just send him to die. Today he should get to FBU IK/2 Single Space of Cell Type at the address Vozzhayevka station, Amur Oblast.\n\nFurthermore, at the same zone IK/2 they have Mr. Ibragim Alaudinovich Katsayev, this person is kept under strong press and humiliated. The help of human rights defenders is needed.\"\n\nAnother letter came in 5 days:\n\n\"Very recently a Russian lad has hanged himself because of violence from other prisoners who work for administration in the camp whereto they are transferring Rezvan Taysumov. He didn't survive humiliation and violence. The name of the lad was Artyom Yuryevich Morozov.\"\n\nThe latter message was verified by our attorney working in Amur Oblast. Morozov was indeed found hanged on May 9. He had been sentenced to 3.5 years of imprisonment. The day before his death a psychologist spoke to him who stated that Artyom Morozov's mood wasn't at all gloomy, and he was interested in learning about the procedure for obtaining a long visit from relatives. It will hardly ever become known whether it was a suicide or a murder.\n\nThings that happened to Artyom Morozov show the overall level of common troubles in certain penal institutions in the Russian Federation. It is exactly such institutions where they often send residents of the Chechen Republic for serving their sentences.\n\nFabrication of criminal cases\n\nMass fabrication of criminal cases became the most cruel and cynical form of persecuting Chechens.\n\nThe standard mechanism of persecution is simple: when performing housing or body search, police officers plant a small amount of narcotics, bullets, a grenade, or explosives, and then, after having detained the citizen, they wring a confession out of him or her. At that, there is often no other grounds to check papers, do a body or housing search than close attention of law enforcement bodies to persons of a specific ethnic background.\n\nIn December 2007, before the elections, Moscow police officers made rounds of apartments of those who were from Chechnya by origin, writing down their passport information and requiring to inform the local police office of who was going to visit them at that time.\n\nPersons from Chechnya by origin get special attention at the passport control when crossing borders. They are delayed, their passports are taken away for additional checks. There were cases when the passport control lasted so long that it resulted in missing the plane. For instance, in December 2007, Ms. Lydia Yusupova, a nominee for the Nobel peace prize, missed her plane to Italy at Sheremetyevo airport. In summer 2008, the situation repeated twice at Vnukovo airport, as participants of the rehabilitation seminar organized by Memorial Human Rights Center for its officers were flying out and flying back in. At that, a special one hour check was performed for those whose origin was Chechnya without any explanation. One of the Chechens nearly got detained for expressing discontent with that. The chief of brigade threatened him with a court trial and falsified his replies on the fly. The process could only be stopped when the head of the group produced a member certificate of RF President's Council on Human Rights.\n\nIt is obvious that all this is taking place at secret directions from higher-ups, though it is also consistent with the general xenophobic attitude towards Chechens.\n\nEven though the criminal cases are fabricated in a very obvious manner, those charged with criminal offences as a rule are not acquitted. The best that attorneys can manage is return cases for further investigation or obtain a conditional sentence.\n\nSometimes investigators offer small terms or conditional sentences in return for a confession, which is a corollary proof of the groundlessness of charges. However, there are known many cases when a defendant is imprisoned for a long time on fabricated charges.\n\nU. Batukayev, R. Musayev, and L. Khamiyev from Chechnya are still detained following their arrest in May 2007. On November 1, 2008, the Moscow city court prolongued again the term of their arrest (till January 5, 2009, for the accused Lors Khamiyev, till January 8, 2009, for Umar Batukayev and Ruslan Musayev, as Gazeta.Ru informs with a referral to RIA Novosti).\n\nUmar Batukayev, Ruslan Musayev, and Lors Khamiyev are being charged with the intention to blow up a car with explosives. The case is investigated by the Federal Security Service, therefore the suspects are kept in the Lefortovo investigation ward of the Service. According to the investigation's story, the accused were a part of a terrorist group headed by Lors Khamiyev. At the order of the latter, Umar Batukayev, a student at the Academy of Economics and Law, and Ruslan Musayev, a graduate of the Moscow banking institute, bought VAZ-2107 car and turned it into a car bomb. The day before the Victory day, Federal Security Service officers found and then defused the car using a robot. At first the investigation worked on the story about Chechens preparing to blow up the car during the celebration of the Victory day. However, now the Federal Security Service officers believe that the suspects prepared an attempt on the life of the Chechnya President Ramzan Kadyrov. According to the investigation, they were planning to murder the head of the republic during his participation in the holiday celebrations at the capital. Original articles of the RF Criminal Code, under which the accused were being prosecuted (\"Illegal possession and transportation of weapons\", \"Attempt of a terrorist act\", etc.) were reinforced by the article \"Preparation of an attempt on life of a state or public figure.\"\n\nAttorney M. Musayev believes that the prosecution didn't find direct proofs of his client's guilt and is based solely on hypotheses of the investigators.\n\nOne could suggest that the accusation of an attempt on Kadyrov's life was added to deprive the suspects of support from Chechnya.\n\nThe process was in its very beginning when all suspects on the case were made to take some medicaments, as a result of which Mr. Ruslan Musayev lost consciousness in the courtroom during the determination of a measure of restriction. They had to call an emergency to get him back to senses. Mr. Batukayev, who has since been kept under arrest in Lefortovo is not allowed visits from his relatives. This is a well-known instrument of psychological pressure on those under investigation.\n\nThe court hearings on the case weren't public. On April 2, 2009, the Moscow City court sentenced the defendants to the terms of between five and eight years in a colony of strict regime. Specifically, Lors Khamiyev was sentenced to eight years in a colony of strict regime and Umar Batukayev was sentenced to five years in a colony of common regime. The accused Ruslan Musayev was acquitted, he didn't get any term. However, the reason for that wasn't stated by the judge as the motivational part of the sentence wasn't pronounced in the open court hearing.\n\nPersons originally from the Chechen Republic cannot feel safe in the RF territory: they constantly are in the \"risk group\", under the threat that they will have to bear responsibility for crimes that they didn't commit. The stories are rare that would both confirm it and finish favorably to their heroes.\n\nOn December 12, 2007, Mr. Mokhmad Betmirzayev, thrice champion of Russia and the World in kickboxing, was detained at Vnukovo airport in Moscow.\n\nAgents explained to him that they wanted to question him in connection with the murder of some Ms. Smirnova, committed on January 27, 2007. Betmirzayev explained that he didn't know the woman. On December 20, 2007 he was nevertheless charged with the murder, and Savelovsky district court issued an order for his arrest.\n\nSome muscovite Ye. M. Smirnova was beaten to death with bats by two unknown persons. According to the hypotheses of the detectives, Smirnova, having quarreled with a friend of hers, started calling his acquaintances on the telephone, terrorizing them with her calls. Some of them organized her murder so that she wouldn't bother them any further. Investigators interrogated persons whom Smirnova called, but they couldn't collect any proofs confirming their guilt in her murder. There was a person among those interrogated whom Smirnova called particularly often. He mentioned Mokhmad Betmirzayev as his close friend, and this turned out to be enough formal reason for an arrest.\n\nNot a single proof of Betmirzayev's connection to the murder of Smirnova was found. Moreover, the investigative actions and expert examinations undertaken under the case confirmed groundlessness of criminal charges against him. Thus, as is stated in the material of the criminal case, there were found a baseball bat, cigarette ends, two used syringes, chewing gum, and traces of blood at the place of the event. But the records of occurrence site survey weren't presented to the defendant's side, despite numerous applications. According to forensic biological and genetic tests, Mokhmad Betmirzayev doesn't have anything to do with the evidence found, and the murder weapon doesn't have his finger imprints. This didn't prevent investigators from passing the case to the Moscow military prosecutor's office.\n\nDuring all of the year preceding detention, Betmirzayev participated in numerous sport events and often went abroad. Had he wanted to flee from justice, he would have many opportunities to do that. He was charged 11 months after the murder, right at the end of the year, when they had to draw up balance and report about the investigation success.\n\nThe ombudsman in the Chechen Republic Nurdi Nukhazhiyev, when addressing the prosecutor of Moscow Yuri Syomin on the case of Betmirzayev, notes that the agents who detained the sportsman at the airport asked whether he had money, rich relatives in Moscow, assistance from the Diaspora, and pressed him to make a confession that he committed the murder.\n\nMr. Nukhazhiyev noted[12], \"It is clear from the investigator's resolutions and circumstances of the criminal case that the preliminary investigation exhausted all procedural possibilities for proving the defendant's guilt from the very start.\"\n\nIn his address, Mr. Nurdi Nukhazhiyev asked the prosecutor of Moscow to take measures to stop the ungrounded criminal proceedings against Mokhmad Betmirzayev and direct the efforts of investigators towards the establishment of the real initiators of the crime.\n\nDefending the arrested champion, representatives of the Chechen ministry of sport, deputy chair of the Chechen government Ziyad Sabasbi, and a representative of the kickboxing federation of Russia pledged for him to be set free. The interference of the human rights protection community also was important, Ms. S. A. Gannushkina petitioned the prosecutor vouching for Mr. M. Betmirzayev and asking to release him. The article of the journalist Zoya Svetova published in Novyye Izvestiya, one of the central newspapers, attracted the attention of the public to Betmirzayev.\n\nThe active defense of Mokhmad organized by his father Adlan Betmirzayev who was a human rights campaigner for many years and is well known to the human rights protection community led to a success.\n\nAfter eight months spent in detention, Mokhamd Betmirzayev was released without the right to leave Moscow.\n\nEven having served a sentence, a Chechen cannot be sure of regaining freedom.\n\nIn 2005, Movsar Beksultanov, a resident of Achkhoy-Martan where the Voronezh police special task force troop is stationed, was sentenced for participating in illegal military formations. The defense managed to prove that Beksultanov was tortured during investigation, and a criminal case was brought in on facts of illegal methods of investigation. But this didn't stop the prosecution, and Movsar served three years in the colony 2 of the city of Voronezh. About a month prior to release date, he was visited in the colony by the chief of the Zheleznodorozhny police office of Voronezh Vyacheslav Kulikov who served as the head of criminal police in Achkhoy-Martan. Kulikov demanded that Movsar write a new confession on his case. \"Otherwise they will meet you at the exit from the colony and give you a new term. You won't survive four years somewhere next to Magadan with your gastric ulcer.\" Beksultanov refused to defame himself.\n\nOn June 16, 2008 during the day when Movsar Beksultanov was scheduled to be released, his relatives, father, mother, and a five years old niece, came to meet him. All of them, including the girl, were detained. They were brought to the district office of Voronezh police where they spent 3 hours without any explanations. (A characteristic feature of such cases is that no traces of detention can be found. The inquiry about ungrounded detention of a few persons including a child that we sent to the prosecutor's office had a standard reply, \"the facts you conveyed weren't confirmed under an objective verification.\")\n\nWhile those meeting him were in detention, Movsar Beksultanov left the prison and was immediately stopped by police officers in civilian clothing. He gave them the release certificate, after which they virtually abducted him: handcuffed him, and, having covered his head with prison overalls, forced him into a car.\n\nThe officers later explained the abduction with absurd causes, for a moment claiming that a grenade was found in his bag, then telling about some cellmate who threatened to kill Beksultanov for some offence. Finally, they said that narcotics were found in Beksultanov's Koran (!), held by the officers in their hands for some time.\n\nAfter this Movsar was brought to the district police office of the Voronezh's Central district where he was kept without food and drink for two days. Unbearable pain made Movsar suffering from a gastric ulcer commit a suicide attempt.\n\nAfter two days (during detention without a court order for 48 hours), Beksultanov was brought to the court for choosing a measure of restriction. There Beksultanov \"learnt\" that he was detained on June 16 at 23.00 (that is 8 hours later than the factual detention time) next to the colony for disorderly conduct, and narcotics were found on hum in the course of a body search. A new criminal case against Movsar Beksultanov was brought in.\n\nThe fabrication of a new case and the court trial didn't take place, however. The judge of the Central district of the city of Voronezh didn't sanction Movsar Beksultanov's arrest, disbelieving his guilt. Zoya Svetova quotes the attorney Yelena Kuznetsova's words in her article \"How a release from prison turns into a new term of imprisonment\"[13]: \"One has to give credit to the judge who understood the situation very well. How could a convict who just got released bring narcotics out of the colony? They do body search when releasing them. It means that Movsar was leaving the zone without the narcotics, and two minutes later the narcotics appeared. Besides, the colony is equipped with permanent video surveillance. It is surprising, but the investigator remembered about this only in five days. Apparently, she knew it only too well that the record was by then destroyed.\"\n\nMovsar was aided both by Voronezh and Moscow human rights defenders (including Mr. Bitutsky, an attorney of the Migration Rights Network) and also by the human rights ombudsman in Chechnya and reporters. In a few months the case on the narcotics found in Koran was dropped because of the absence of corpus delicti.\n\nIt is not at all always that efforts of public campaigns bring at least relative success.\n\nIn May 2008, Civic Assistance committee was approached by Zareta Dzhanaraliyeva, a sister of Lechi Musayevich Dzhanaraliyev, about whom Memorial Human Rights Center had already reported[14].\n\nLechi Dzhanaraliyev, born 1980, an officer of the district police office of Zavodskoy district was found guilty of banditry and sentenced to 12 years in prison by the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic. He is gravely ill, and they were obliged to release him because of his health condition. However, instead the Federal Penitentiary Service decided to transport Dzhanaraliyev to Mordovia.\n\nLechi Dzhanaraliyev was detained on April 8, 2005. He went in a car of his neighbor who volunteered to take him home. On the road, Lechi's acquaintance ignored the requests to stop from the military. They opened destruction fire at the car. The driver was killed, and they found a gun on him. Lechi Dzhanaraliyev was wounded in the head and in the spine. After detention he spent about a month in the city hospital 9. Upon treatment completion the doctors said that Dzhanaraliyev would need a repeat operation in a year. He needed a skull trepanation and plastic prosthetics. Dzhanaraliyev obtained the status of invalid of the 1st group. In the course of the trial they brought him into the courtroom in a stretcher. Despite Dzhanaraliyev not having much in common with his neighbor and became disabled as a result of severe wounding, the court found him guilty and sentenced him to 13 years of imprisonment in a colony of strict regime. In August 2005, the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic, a cassation instance, dropped the charge of possessing weapons, but left \"banditry\" in place (how is it possible without weapons?). The term of punishment became half a year shorter.\n\nAt first Dzhanaraliyev served his sentence in the town of Georgiyevsk of Stavropol region. On March 19, 2008, a special committee on medical examination of convicts consisting of eight people diagnosed Lechi Dzhanaraliyev with the diagnosis of \"open cerebral injury\", which is on the list of illnesses exempting from the completion of a sentence in accordance with Paragraph 23 of the RF Government Resolution of February 6, 2004. The committee set Dzhanaraliyev forth for a release.\n\nThey returned Lechi to the Chechen Republic and put him into the investigation ward 1 in the city of Grozny.\n\nHowever, soon after that Dzhanaraliyev was transferred to the investigation ward of Chernokozovo village instead of release. He was kept there for about two weeks.\n\nThe final decision on his release had to be made by the court. However, Mr. V. A. Agarkov, a judge of Georgiyevsk town court, didn't agree with the opinion of the medics. His resolution reads as follows, \"Despite Mr. Dzhanaraliyev's \"suffering from diseases on the 'List of Diseases Preventing from Sentence Completion', his life is currently not in danger, and he is capable of completing his sentence in a specialized medical institution in a colony…\"\n\nIn the end of May 2008, Lechi's family was informed that they intended to transport him to Mordovia. The medical opinion that Dzhanaraliyev should be set free for health reasons was ignored.\n\nUpon learning about such a decision, his relatives applied to Memorial Human Rights Center and to the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman in the Chechen Republic. The decision on transportation was appealed against, and the complaint of Dzhanaraliyev was still at the stage of consideration on June 30, when he was transported to the investigation ward of the city of Pyatigorsk, and further to Mordovia.\n\nAccording to the words of witnesses, fellow convicts who were transported together with Dzhanaraliyev, the treatment of Lechi by the officers of the investigation ward were inhuman. The convoy took him from the cell where he was located, dragged him to the car, and threw him into it, sending him by usual means of transportation without a doctor.\n\nNeither human rights defenders, nor the Human Rights Ombudsman could resist the cruelty of the court. One could suggest that this is a form of revenge for Lechi Dzhanaraliyev's refusal to plead guilty despite of all of the efforts of the investigation and judges.\n\nAccording to Ms. Zareta Dzhanaraliyeva, the sister of Lechi who visited him in Mordovia, the condition of her brother was extremely grave, he was emaciated to exhaustion, suffered from severe headaches, couldn't service himself, and needed urgent and radical medical aid. Memorial Human Rights Center commissioned an attorney to defend Dzhanaraliyev, but so far he couldn't meet his client.\n\nOn March 23, 2009, Civic Assistance Committee was approached by the representative of the Chechen Ministry of Health Ms. Satsita Uspayeva who for many years cooperated with the Committee on providing residents of the Chechen Republic with medical aid.\n\nIt was the more unexpected for the non-governmental organization's officers when Satsita told them that on October 21, 2008, her husband, Mr. Akhiyad Magomedzhovich Baysarov, was sentenced to 8 years of imprisonment on a charge of abduction.\n\nThe abduction took place in Moscow in 1999. The abducted, Mr. Serzhik Dzhilavyan, was supposed to meet up with Akhiyad Baysarov, but was forcedly taken away from the place of meeting and kept in isolation for 11 days. After his release, Dzhilavyan lodged an application with the law enforcement bodies where he mentioned the failed meeting with Baysarov. Right after that Dzhilavyan left for Yerevan.\n\nAkhiyad Baysarov was arrested, but after 8 months of imprisonment they released him after a written undertaking not to leave. The investigation was stopped because of the absence of the victim.\n\nBaysarov spent 10 years under the undertaking not to leave. In 2006, Mr. Dzhilavyan appeared in Moscow where Mr. Baysarov accidentally met him. It turned out that Dzhilavyan long had investigated his abduction on his own and had found out that its organizer was his guard. At Baysarov's request, Dzhilavyan wrote about it to the investigation authorities. However, instead of closing the file, they sent it to the court. Dzhilavyan went to all hearings and tried to protect Baysarov. But it was all in vain, the sentence was as cruel as it was absurd, which didn't prevent the cassation instance from confirming it.\n\nProbably, it is the only case when the cassation complaint for the defendant was written also by the victim.\n\nAkhiyad Magomedzhovich Baysarov is an invalid of 2nd group, he has a gastric ulcer and diabetes, some time ago he went through an infarct. He has two underage children. All this wasn't taken into account by the court. Participants of the process keep filing complaints, but the positive outcome of this strange case is still not foreseen.\n\nNon-governmental organizations keep getting information that they send bodies of those who died in prison to Chechnya. Relatives apply to law enforcement authorities with investigation requests in such cases very rarely.\n\nImali Vikharzhiyevich Ayubov, born 1978, a resident of the Oyskhar village, was sentenced to 16 years of imprisonment by the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic on July 10, 2006, and then transported to a tuberculosis zone, the institution OI-92/4 of the Dagestan Republic office of the Penitentiary Serice of the RF Ministry of Justice. He had been kept there since May 2007. Ayubov was in bad condition and in September 2008 a medical committee made a decision that he and 5 other convicts were subject to release according to the legislation. The administration of the colony in turn applied to the court of Sovetsky district in the city of Makhachkala on September 28, 2007, with a petition on the release of Ayubov.\n\nHowever, on December 31, 2007, the court refused Ayubov's release. The cause for this was that the relatives couldn't collect the necessary sum of money. On April 11, 2009, a volunteer called Memorial Human Rights Center and told that Imali Ayubov had died in the colony. An officer of the Human Rights Center went to see his relatives in the Oyskhar village and made sure that the news was true. It was impossible to ask questions at the funerals, but it became clear from conversations of the relatives that he died because of an illness. Attempts were made to set him free to let him die in peace at home. The last amount that they asked for his release was 750 thousand rubles (before they named 130 thousand dollars). The relatives were collecting the money, but managed to collect only a half[15].\n\nIt should be noticed that only an insignificant fraction of cases comes in sight of the human rights defenders. As a rule, relatives attempt to resolve the issue quietly using connections and money. The faith in justice and legal mechanisms is almost lost, and not without a foundation. We often learn about the events of the kind by indirection and don't get permission from the victims to speak up about the event, ask the press in and commission an attorney who refuses to bring a bribe to the court. Therefore, when we are approached by applicants who lost their hope in getting their relative released, it often turns out that the case has gone so far that all terms have passed and there is already no way to help.\n\nThe only hope for acquittal till recently was the possibility to get the case considered by a jury trial where falsifications could be exposed in a number of situations. However, on December 30, 2008, a law went into effect, which excluded the following crimes from the consideration of a jury trial: Article 205 (Terrorist Act), Article 206 Part 2-4 (Taking a Hostage), Article 208, Part 1 (Organization of an Illegal Military Formation), Article 212, Part 1 (Organization of Mass Disorders), Article 275 (High Treason), Article 276 (Espionage), Article 278 (Capturing or Holding Power with Force), Article 279 (Armed Rebellion), or Article 281 (Diversion).\n\nThe human rights community produced a distinctly negative evaluation of such a change to the RF Criminal Execution Code. The law violates the legal logic: before it came into effect, a jury trial could be chosen by those charged with crimes subject to trial in courts no lower than the courts of the RF federal subjects. Besides, fabrications on charges of criminal acts, participation in an illegal military formation, and mass disorders are the most widespread ones. Professional judges are afraid to bring in acquittals on such charges.\n\nIII. ON THE IMAGE OF THE ENEMY IN MASS CONSCIOUSNESS\n\nOver the past years, the image of the Chechen who is dangerous, cruel and hostile to Russia has become ingrained in mass consciousness. Media outlets no longer need to shape this image of the enemy. It is enough just to flesh it out, using the appropriate formulas and expressions that have already become set – and no proof is needed. Material gets the required emotional coloring and any fact can be presented as yet another proof of the already existing myth.\n\nArticle by Grigory Geroyev titled \"A new path of development for Chechnya? We'll go on short rations ourselves just to feed the Chechens\" posted on January 13, 2009, on the official web-site of the Political News Agency (APN)[16] is a typical example illustrating this. The author starts off citing quite commendable words from a New Year's Eve address by Ramzan Kadyrov to the nation of Chechnya: \"The most important thing is to break those stereotypes that had been imposed over a number of years… I'm asking the Almighty Allah to never let war and bloodshed descend on our heads and to make the new times for the Muslims of Russia a period of further revival of spirituality, culture and traditions, for people without spiritual roots are deprived of the past, and there can be no future without the past.\"\n\nThen Geroyev cites the words of the Chechen culture minister Dikalu Muzakayev, who summing up the results of the past year expressed confidence that Chechnya would soon reach \"a qualitatively new level — the level of an intellectual and cultural center of the entire North Caucasus.\"\n\n\"Our republic possessed vast museum collections, most of which have been irrevocably lost. …Young people from that generation were deprived of the opportunity to fully inherit the beautiful traditions and customs of their ancestors… homes and communications can be restored, but to restore the spiritual heritage is a tremendous challenge,\" Muzakayev said.\n\nThe Minister speaks about the restoration of cultural facilities damaged during the hostilities: a new Chechen national library, the idea of establishing a department for the protection of material culture sites, and the construction of a National Museum of Regional Studies in Grozny.\n\nOne might expect that Geroyev's article would also deal with the revival of culture in Chechnya. But it's nothing of the sort.\n\nGeroyev switches to a completely different subject. He says that the debate \"which today has started in Chechnya around the early release of Yury Budanov, former colonel of the Russian Army and holder of the title Hero of Russia, in no way suggests that Chechnya \"has been breaking old stereotypes.\" Geroyev rebukes Chechens for being angry at the release of the murderer young Chechen girl Elza Kungayeva, whose parents risked going to law.\n\nFor Geroyev, Budanov still holds the title of Hero of Russia, although he was stripped of this title as long as seven years ago. Geroyev complains that Chechens \"do not give a slightest thought to the fact that they themselves did things that in no way did them credit during the last two conflicts. Among these things were terrorism and banditry fueled by Chechen separatism; drug trade; abductions for ransom or subsequent use of the abducted as slaves; barbaric traditions steeped in bizarre religious beliefs; finally, sadism.\"\n\nPutting aside the discussion of the Budanov case, as well as the grammar and the language of the article, one can not fail to note how strange in itself is the logic according to which it was written. In response to the call to break stereotypes, the author immediately starts replicating them.\n\nOne might think, what relation museums and libraries have to Budanov and separatism? Well, none, really, whatsoever.\n\nThe article contains no sensible reasoning. The author replicates a set of associations: Chechens – slave owners – drug dealers – terrorists – barbarians – savages – sadists. They slander our hero (even if this hero is a murderer!) and, therefore, cannot be sincere in their desire for the revival of cultural values in Chechnya.\n\nTo make the required impression on the mass reader Geroyev does not at all need to show why and in what ways the projects of the Chechen Republic's culture ministry are harmful and why the idea of reviving \"spirituality, culture and traditions\" is bad. It is enough to flesh out the myth – and in its context the article's final conclusion becomes acceptable: \"by supporting the Chechen national culture and reviving their traditions, Russia destroys its own culture and traditions.\"\n\nThe primitive and extremely poor article prompted a flurry of comments on the Internet. They came mostly from young people. With rare exception, the remarks were full of xenophobia and hatred towards Chechens and conviction that the Russian people is humiliated and subdued. There were also some words of sympathy for Budanov, but mostly he was seen with contempt. A comment below presents a typical attitude in the most concise way:\n\n\"I have no pity for this non-white trash, but Budanov is a lackey, why doesn't he shoot himself? He has really dishonored himself and looks now like those black-assed pigs.\" Rare retorts came from persons from the Caucasus, who turned the tables on the majority of commenters. The few reasonable comments are swamped in the oozy mire of hatred. No one refers to the revival of the cultural heritage.\n\nStudies of the formation of the \"language of enmity\" used by the media repeatedly suggest the existence of the practice of making unprompted references to ethnicity in media crime reports. \"Natives of Chechnya detained in Moscow when they tried to sell a forged bill…[17]\" \"A Chechen hitman detained in the Czech Republic[18]…\" \"The case, in which six Chechens are charged with launching an illegal migration route across Belarus, sent to court\"[19] \"A purely Chechen operation\" (an article about the investigation of a contract killing)[20]…\n\nAs Ye. O. Khabenskaya wrote in her study \"Ethnic stereotypes and xenophobia in the media\"[21]:\n\n\"Journalists, building on the fears and phobias existing in mass consciousness, consciously or unconsciously give an ethnic dimension to the crime situation… A significant portion of ethnoconflictogenic publications in the above media deal with developments in the North Caucasus and problems of terrorism and help demonize the image of the \"Chechen\" and the \"man from the Caucasus\". Inaccurate use by journalists of a number of religious terms (shahid, mujahid, warrior of Allah, etc.) when referring to bandits and suicide bombers helps shape erroneous perceptions of Islam norms and, accordingly, a negative image of the Muslim. We have found that the most conflictogenic articles on the subject of terror have been published by the Argumenty i Fakty weekly, followed by the daily newspapers Moskovsky Komsomolets and Moskovskaya Pravda. In a number of cases, such publications can be seen in the context of the criminal and civil law as inciting ethnic and interconfessional hostility (Article 282 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).\"\n\nChechens are described in such a way as to produce an a priori assumption that they are guilty of a host of \"deadly sins\"; acts devoid of all plausibility are readily inscribed to them. Let us cite two examples, the full details of which are available to us.\n\nLet's recall the story of Movsar Beksultanov that we have already mentioned in this Report.\n\nIn 2004, Beksultanov was arrested in the town of Achkhoi-Martan. He was charged with aiding Wahhabis. Under torture that continued for many hours he confessed to the charges and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was sent to Penal Colony 2 of the city of Voronezh to serve his sentence.\n\nTwo months before the end of his prison-term, Movsar was visited in his cell by a man the young Chechen remembered all too well: it was the man who interrogated him on several occasions during 2004 in Achkhoi-Martan (Voronezh-based police officers were at the time on a mission in Chechnya). \"The man warned me that if I didn't give information about militants I would be met at the colony's gate and jailed again,\" Beksultanov said.\n\nOn June 16, 2008, the day Movsar was released, he was stopped by police officers in plain clothes not far away from the penal colony. He presented his certificate of release, after which he was handcuffed, forced into a car with his prison overalls pulled over his head and taken to the Central District police department of the city of Voronezh.\n\nHis abductors gave ridiculous reasons for his detention: first they claimed that a grenade was found in his bag, later, they told him that drugs were discovered in a Koran that had been seized from Beksultanov and was for some time held by the abductors.\n\nMovsar was held at the Central district police department of the city of Voronezh for two days without food and water. Because of the unbearable pain, Movsar who suffers from gastric ulcer attempted suicide. A new criminal case was opened against Movsar Beksultanov.\n\nField investigators' plans to put him behind bars again were unexpectedly disrupted by a judge of the Central district of the city of Voronezh: she did not sanction Movsar Beksultanov's arrest, citing the lack of legal grounds for his detention. Movsar was helped by the fact that human rights defenders, Voronezh-based journalist Svetlana Tarasova and the Human Rights Ombudsman in Chechnya got involved in his defense. Several months later, the case of drugs found in a Koran was dropped because of the absence of corpus delicti. The story ended with a relative success, although the persons guilty of trumping up the evidence went unpunished.\n\nHowever, in the article \"Basayev's close henchman detained in Chechnya\" published on NEWS.RU web-portal[22] and cited by many other media outlets, including a w"
