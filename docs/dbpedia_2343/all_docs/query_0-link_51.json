        "text": "Within five years of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, ethnic conflicts spilled throughout its territory, most of them in the Russian Federation. An analysis of scope and intensity of a conflict with one of Russia’s two hundred ethnic minorities is the focus of this book. The conflict in Chechnya erupted into two full-scale wars, fought during the decade of Russia’s turbulent transition from communism toward democracy. Using a variety of sources–governmental documents, monographs, diaries of military and political leaders, reports, and contemporary periodicals–the author examines the roots of the conflict and responses to the wars from the media, political parties, and diplomatic circles in Russia and the United States. The Chechen wars have demonstrated the limits of the concept of self-determination for an abused minority population. The military operation in Chechnya has eroded Russian democracy and strengthened those within the military and security forces who call for a return to the old ways. For many in today’s Russian elite, the restoration of the lost Soviet empire might be the ultimate objective. The developments in the future deserve the world's attention.\n\nTHE CONFLICT IN CHECHNYA and its consequences are among the most serious challenges currently facing Russia—draining the country of valuable human and material resources, impeding democratic development and contributing to stall military reform. The most dramatic consequence of the nearly ten-year conflict is perhaps the radicalisation and Islamisation of parts of the separatist movement, with international Islamist organisations apparently gaining a foothold on Russian territory. One can get the impression that Islam in itself is the key conflict-generating factor in Chechnya. This article argues against that notion. Although there was a religious revival in Chechnya at the time, Islam initially played a marginal role in the ideology of Chechen separatists. 1 After nearly ten years of conflict and chaos both Political Islam and Radical Islam, trends quite alien to the Sufi Chechens, have become part of the ideology and working method of many Chechen fighters and politicians. 2 This article aims to address two different but closely related questions. First, how did Radical Islam gain a foothold in the Chechen separatist movement? Second, why are the moderates in the separatist movement losing ground to the radicals? To answer these questions three developments that run parallel in time and mutually influence each other are analysed. (1) The first war between 1994 and 1996 led to a radicalisation of a few central warlords and politicians, who came to play a crucial role in the interwar period and in the second war (1999 – ?). The article addresses why these individuals adopted Radical and/or Political Islam. (2) Foreign Islamists and organisations have attempted to co-opt the Chechen conflict. The article traces how and why these actors have gained access to the Chechen separatist movement. (3) Russia's policies towards Chechnya in the interwar period and during the second war are analysed. How have these policies influenced the balance of power between moderates and radicals in the Chechen separatist movement? The reasons for the Islamisation of the Chechen separatist movement are thus sought at the local, the regional and the global level. The main thrust of the argument\n\nThis chapter examines the main causes, actors and trajectories of ethno-territorial conflicts in Nagorny Karabakh, South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the South Caucasus, and in Prigorodnyi region between Ossetians and Ingush and in Chechnya in the North Caucasus. The chapter argues that these, as well as other ethnic conflicts on the territory of the former USSR, were triggered by perestroika and glasnost policies under Mikhail Gorbachev. Caucasus conflicts in the 1990s are explained in terms of local and contingent factors such as the historically contested delimitation of territorial borders, mythologised narratives of communal antagonism, majority-dominated cores and peripheral minorities (with many in possession of autonomous institutions), relationships between immediate neighbours as well as with the Russian/Soviet centre, and personalities of national leaders that contributed to radicalisation.\n\nThis article examines the radicalization of the insurgency in Chechnya and the Northeast Caucasus during the conflict of the 1990s and 2000s. In the post-Soviet era, the separatist movement in the region shed its secular and nationalist roots and assumed a more radical and Islamist character. This research analyses whether counterinsurgency tactics employed by Russian forces contributed to the radicalization of the insurgency or if this radicalization was the result of external factors, such as the influence of foreign fighters and their ideologies hat were not native to the North Caucasus region. In the North Caucasus, the Russian Federation employed an enemy-centric approach to counterinsurgency, rather than a population-centric approach common to the United States and other Western countries. This research concludes that the presence of foreign missionaries, fighters, and ideologies were the main catalysts that caused the conflict to become religiously inspired. The internal factionalism of the independence movement also facilitated this process, with certain leaders aligning with foreign, Islamist radicals who promised to support the Chechen cause. While Russia's counterinsurgency tactics did contribute to radicalization and inflicted severe psychological trauma on the population, they were not the ultimate cause of the insurgency's transformation.\n\nThis dissertation investigates how violence against a given territory or group of people becomes acceptable to leaders and their publics. Some wars are launched only reluctantly, and support dwindles once the high human costs are revealaed. Others, however, are undertaken with a sense of urgency and righteousness. The brute violence employed appears not only acceptable, but even necessary. The second post-soviet war which was launched against Chechnya in 1999 was such a war. The thesis employs and develops a post-structuralist version of securitization theory. This approach emphasises securitization as an intersubjective and ongoing process of legitimation, not an instance or a moment. The social construction of Chechnya and Chechens as 'terrorist' is conceptualized as a collective endeavour. Not only statements by the Russian leadership, but also historical representations as well as those of the wider political elite, journalists and experts contributed to this rough categorization. In the final chapter the thesis investigates how this linguistic categorization materialized in the brutal practices employed during the Second Chechen War."
