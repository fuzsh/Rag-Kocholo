Historians' estimates for her total victories range from five to twelve solo victories and two to four shared kills in her 66 combat sorties. In about two years of operations, she was the first female fighter pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft, the first of two female fighter pilots who have earned the title of fighter ace and the holder of the record for the greatest number of kills by a female fighter pilot. She was shot down near Orel during the Battle of Kursk as she attacked a formation of German aircraft.\n\nRussian Jews who died in the Holocaust · 6T\n\nFemale military aviators · 19T\n\nVictims of aviation accidents or incidents in 1943 · 64T\n\nYekaterina Budanova Soviet fighter pilot\n\n0 0\n\nrank #3 ·\n\nYekaterina Vasilyevna Budanova (Russian: Екатерина Васильевна Буданова), nicknamed Katya (Катя), (6 December 1916 – 19 July 1943), was a fighter pilot in the Soviet Air Force during World War II.
