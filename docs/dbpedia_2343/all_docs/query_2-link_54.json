        "text": "You can unzip [the downloaded update file] and let it overwrite. It will not overwrite your campaigns or other settings.\n\nA cleaner way is to back up the user folder (PWCGBoS\\User) somewhere else. Delete PWCGBoS. Unzip again. Restore your user folder.\n\nThe versions\n\n16.0.1\n\nBugs:\n\n- Added missing profiles and pictures for Li2 and La 5 S38\n\n- Fixed issue with FC new pilot creation for coop campaigns\n\n16.0.0\n\nFC:\n\nAdded western front map with seasons\n\nExpanded FC squadrons available\n\nRearranged all FC squadron assignments to fit expanded map (and be more accurate)\n\nAdded RE8\n\n- Strutter and Dorand AR are RE8s.\n\nBoS:\n\n- Added Li2\n\n- Added La5 S.38\n\n- Added Spitfire Mx.IXc\n\n- Added IAR as a possible replacement plane\n\nBugs:\n\n- Fixed autumn season for FC map\n\n- Fixed cannot add a pilot to SP campaigns\n\n- Fixed iconic missions from the main screen\n\n- Fixed Squadron Logs\n\n- Fixed static planes damage too high\n\n15.1.1\n\nAdded Ultra Low ground to eliminate trains and trucks.\n\n- Good for WWI where you are not really roaming the countrside\n\n- reduced infantry\n\nAdded Ultra AAA to reduce the gobs of AAA in PWCG missions.\n\n- PWCG puts over 400 AAA units on the map at medium AA levels,so ultra low isn't really a tiny number\n\n- No AAA around bridges\n\n- No AAA around railroad stations\n\n- No AAA on airfield approaches\n\n- reduced AAA on airfields\n\n- slightly reduced AAA on front lines\n\nAdded rare plane flight odds config\n\n- Gotha, HP, Arado\n\n- Limits frequency of mission generation for certain rare planes\n\n- Controllable through advanced config: Mission Limits section\n\nAdded Adjustment To Pilot Injury config\n\n- Allows incremental downgrade of injuries suffered by player\n\n- Number 0-4. Every number causes injury downgrade from dead-> seriously wounded -> wounded - just ducky\n\n- Controllable through advanced config: Campaign Preferences section\n\nFixed FC airfield Beugnatre\n\nFixed escorts for players using check zones\n\nFixed cold start disabled for coops.\n\nFixed inability to work with coop pilots (transfer, activate, etc.)\n\n15.1.0\n\nAdded Bf109-G6 AS, Spitfire Mk XIVe, Sopwith Snipe and SSW D.IV\n\nFixed issues around adding a coop user\n\nFixed briefing issues for coop missions\n\nFixed zero altitude scramble and strategic intercept missions\n\nFixed issue that could have neutral targets chosen\n\nThe 109 and Spitfire are available to any units that already fly the 109 and Gryphon Spitfire (66th and I forget who else).\n\nThe SSW is available for Jasta 12.\n\nThe Snipe is available for No 43 Squadron and No 4 Squadron AFC, very late in the war.\n\n15.0.0\n\nFor all:\n\n- Missions generate about 10x faster\n\n- Added protection for instances of bad log data\n\n- Reduced infantry by quite a bit\n\nPWCG for FC 2\n\n- FC2 map\n\n- Fronts move in 1918\n\n- Squadrons redeploy based on historical events\n\nSquadron skins with tactical codes for all units.\n\n- Must download ALL FC skin packs.\n\n- Newer skin packs made by me are labeled \"FC Squadron\"\n\n- Existing skin packs are labeled \"FC Skin\"\n\n- Both sets contain squadron skins, so you need all of the packs.\n\n14.1.4\n\nAnother attempt at sweeping the runway clean.\n\nImprovements to campaign generation\n\n- Validate name to prevent downstream errors\n\n- Must now select a map. Ensures data integrity later in the process\n\nIf parked is selected and the map ios Normandy and the campaign is not coop, no runway starts\n\n- Parked starts will not work in Normandy\n\n- I left the option available to coop as they might be able to pull it off with no AI in the flight.\n\nCleaned up transfer screen. Transfers to transport now work.\n\nFixed transport missions\n\n- They are now one way.\n\n- Intermediate waypoints are editable\n\n- No parachute drops in England\n\n14.1.3\n\nFixed error in tactical code config that could cause mission generation to fail.\n\n14.1.2\n\nC47 is flyable in a campaign\n\nFix something that I fixed in 14.1.1 (fixes failure to generate mission)\n\n14.1.1\n\nFixed two issues that could cause AARs to fail\n\nMade an attempt at fixing AI flies to enemy base\n\n14.1.0\n\nCompletion of blank Squadron skins.\n\nOver 600 skins added\n\nWhat is a \"squadron skin?\". it is a skin configured in PWCG to be used as the generic squadron skin. So it is a blank with a unit marking on it.\n\n- All variations of an aircraft were done, so a P47D22 for a squadron will take up to 8 skins with green, silver, plain, and 3 variations of Normandy markings.\n\n- Russian aircraft might have multiple camo schemes over time and concurrently. German planes often had multiple concurrent camo schemes.\n\n- No British squadron skins as they did not have squadron markings other than the code. The existing blank skins are adequate.\n\n- The different paint schemes and markings will add some life and the use of codes will make every aircraft in the mission unique.\n\nChanged takeoff WP priority to low to prevent unaggressive AI if takeoff WP is missed\n\nMany tweaks to iconic events to ensure intended actions are included in the mission\n\nFixed Mosquito payloads not available in briefing\n\nFixed Mosquito payload in Lb not Kg.\n\nFixed wrong image context sometimes used (RAF logbook for German pilot, etc.)\n\nFixed introduction date of Tempests to 56th squadron\n\nMoved introduction of Free French (326th Squadron) to March 1943\n\nFixed \"Dover Castle\" typo\n\nFixed Kingsnorth typo\n\nSignificant internal changes, mostly for testability.\n\n14.0.1\n\nMe 109 Blank Squadron Skins\n\nFW 190 Blank Squadron Skins\n\nReorganized the skin packs download by plane\n\n14.0.0\n\nIntegration of IL2 GB Normandy\n\n- Normandy Map\n\n- Dunkirk 1941\n\n- Battle of Britain 1941\n\n- Channel Front\n\n- Dieppe\n\n- Normandy\n\n- Newspapers\n\n- Normandy iconic missions\n\nImprove strategic intercept and scramble mission waypoints\n\nRadar on the channel front and on the Rhine map\n\nBlank skins and tactical codes\n\nTwo new skin sets\n\n- Blank skins for US fighter squadrons\n\n- P-47 D22, P-47 D28, P-51 B5, P-51 D-15\n\n- About 100 new squadron skins based on the new blank skins\n\nAdded code to not kill pilots who bail out\n\n- Used to avoid killing everybody that bails out over water\n\n- If you are going down over water, don't ditch. PWCG can't pick that up. Bail out.\n\nFixed keep airfield objects away from any area usable by real planes.\n\nFixed issue that could prevent AAR from completing.\n\n13.11.0\n\nAdd Me 410\n\n- III ZG 26 starting in June 1943\n\nChanged victory assignment logic in AAR\n\n- Better damage records allows me to determine who did the most damage.\n\n- Victory goes by log assignment or by who did the most damage.\n\n- Unclaimed player victories are still assigned to flight mates.\n\nOutput AAR results to the error log. Allows players to see what the log files are saying.\n\n- If you are wondering why you did or did not get credit, look at the PWCGErrorLog.txt file\n\nAnother attempt at triggering an Attack MCU to attack all enemy planes\n\n- This time I wait until the first WP is reached on take off.\n\n- Worked in a couple of tests\n\nMove Fokker D8 introduction to August 1918.
