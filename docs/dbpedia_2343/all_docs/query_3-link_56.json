You will get much more variety, in particular. lots more rain and snow. Most battle areas have upwards of 25% rainy days.\n\nAny given weather pattern may or may not impact a given mission type. If it is overcast and rainy most of the missions are going to be pushed to low altitude. Dive bombing missions are particularly affected. Dive bombing will be swapped for an attack mission where the Stuka will drop bombs much like a fighter or IL2. Tactical bombing will be pushed lower. Patrols will be pushed lower. Deeper penetration missions will be scrapped in favor of lower altitude missions near the front.\n\nIf cloud cover is not overcast or heavy then you will fly the missions as usual with whatever cloud cover there may be.\n\nWeather related advanced configuration:\n\nCampaign ->Configuration -> Advanced Config -> Weather\n\nUse realistic weather: set to 1 to use weather than includes heavier weather. Set to 0 to fly in relatively clear skies (Still has clouds but no rain)\n\nMin Haze/Max Haze: Minimum and maximum values for haze. Proper values are 1-10. This makes use of the new haze feature\n\nMax Wind: Not a new config. Maximum wind speed in meters per second\n\nMax turbulence: Not a new config. Proper values are 1-10. Maximum turbulence value in the mission.\n\n11.7.2\n\nFix the thing that I broke in 11.7.1 (which fixed the thing that I broke in 11.7.0)\n\n- Escort and air start were fixed in 11.7.1 but virtual start got broken\n\nVerified proper spawn and activity of player air start, escort air start, and virtual flights.\n\nThanks @FodderMonkey\n\n11.7.1\n\nFixed air start\n\nFixed escorts for player not appearing\n\n11.7.0\n\nAdded Bf109 G6 Late\n\nAdded Paper Dolls in medal view\n\n- Thanks to @ual002 for all of the hard work in making these things. As you can see from the posts above, a lot of effort went into this.\n\n- Not available for Italy in WWII or FC yet.\n\nVaried formations\n\n- Fighters will now use V\n\n- Best formation for a 3 man plane flight\n\n- More like a finger 4 than echelon right for a 4 plane flight\n\n- Bombers may use V or echelon\n\n- Dive bombers and transports use echelon\n\n11.6.1\n\nFixed flying boats on rivers\n\nFixed error in AAR in FC due to missing vehicle names\n\nCorrected pilot names with spaces accidentally typed on the end\n\n11.6.0\n\nUpdated Campaign Main Screen\n\n- Consolidated several buttons into sub menus.\n\n- See tool tip (hover over button) to see where things have gone\n\nAdded Emergency Resupply feature\n\n- Use if your campaign is depleted and not generating oppositon\n\n- Campaign -> Intelligence -> Emergency Resupply\n\n- Verify resupply by looking at Campaign -> Intelligence -> Intelligence Report\n\nAdded CPU Allowance Simple Config\n\n- Accessible from the simple config screen\n\n- Allows you to tone down high CPU mission elements\n\n- Low: One enemy bomber flight. No friendly bomber flights. No virtual escorts.\n\n- Medium: One enemy bomber flight. One friendly bomber flights. COnfigured max virtual escorts for enemy flights.\n\n- High: CPU allowances not considered.\n\n- CPU allowance config does not affect other configs such as air, ground, and AA. Also does not impact advanced configs.\n\n- Setting air, ground, AA, and CPU allowance to low gets lightest possible mission.\n\n- Allows for more limits on high CPU mission elements as they are identified.\n\n- If you are low CPU allowance, recommend scrubbing strategic intercepts.\n\n11.5.1\n\nFix designation of C47 \"Type\"\n\n- Could cause AAR failure to accept claim\n\nFix failure to write new squadrons under some conditions\n\n- Could cause AAR to fail\n\n11.5.0\n\nHurricane\n\n- Select fighter campaign\n\n- Fly with 157th Regiment early or 651st Regiment after August 1942\n\nC47 (LI2)\n\n- Added transport unit to VVS and ASAAF\n\nBetter vehicle naming\n\n- Fewer (hopefully zero) unidentified vehicles\n\n- Fix flying locomotives\n\n11.4.3\n\nFixed only generating recon\n\n11.4.2\n\nFixed issue with pathing that was causing mission generation to fail.\n\nContinued to improve front line pathing.\n\nPayload updates:\n\nEmphasis on armor\n\n- If a battle is the target area, made flights more likely to target armored targets if it is present. Payloads are responsive to this.\n\nSpitfire no has 150 octane fuel.\n\nFW190 A3 now has wing guns with extra ammo\n\nFW190 A5 fixed to include ordnance with U17 selection\n\nFW190 A5 ground attack units now use U17 as standard equipment\n\nBf110 G2 now has 20mm gun pods available.

Murleen has contributed Java code. This is the first time in nine years that an outside author has written Java code for PWCG!\n\nAlso a first: PWCG is now available on GitHub.\n\nMurleen's contributions were a bug fix for spawn parsing and .. this was a lot of work on his part ... the landing correction noted above.
