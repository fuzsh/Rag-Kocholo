        "text": "Aim: This study aimed to detect changes in calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and chlorine levels in male and female footballers before, immediately after and 1 hour after aerobic exercise and to compare the mineral levels detected after the exercise by taking the gender into account. Method: Blood samples were taken before, immediately after and 1 hour after a 20-meter shuttle run test. Macro elements were detected by using the plasma emission spectroscopy method, and the significance level was accepted as P<0.05. Findings: A statistically significant difference was not observed in macro element levels in male and female footballers before, immediately after and 1 hour after the training. In females, the chlorine level in all three periods and the potassium level 1 hour after the training was found higher than males. Conclusion: It is thought that the duration of exercise does not cause a loss of liquid which may result in liquid imbalance; and the haemostatic balance which is strongly controlled by the body prevented the mineral levels from changing after the aerobic exercise.

Life Sci J 2013;10(6s):734-737] (ISSN:1097-8135). http://www.lifesciencesite.com. 114\n\nBackground and Objectives: Exercise results in oxidative enzyme increase and micro-injuries in skeletal muscles. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of maximal aerobic exercise on serum muscle enzymes in professional field hockey players. This study aims to determine the effect of increasing maximal aerobic exercise on creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) serum levels. Material and Methods: 31 young professional field hockey players (13 female and 18 male players) volunteered for this study. All participants underwent the shuttle run test. Blood samples were taken from each participant before the shuttle run test. Post test blood samples were taken immediately after exercise and one hour after respectively. Pre and post test CK, CK-MB, AST and ALT values were measured by means of auto analyzer using original kits. Results: The acute post test measure of the CK level increased in male (p=0.002) and female (p=0.00) sportsmen. CK-MB values obtained one hour after the exercise was lower than those before the exercise in males (p=0.02). In females (p=0.017) and males (p=0.05) AST activity significantly increased immediately after exercise and decreased to resting activity 1 h recovery. ALT significantly increased immediately after exercise in female (p=0.03) and male (p=0.00) athletes and after 1 h recovery ALT activities decreased below resting values. Conclusion: The timing and severity of exercise used in our study increased CK values, decreased CK-MB values and AST, ALT values increased in female and male field hockey players.\n\nAccumulating evidence supports that athletes should pay extra attention to magnesium status as performing exercise is highly dependent on the regulation of magnesium homeostasis. This cation plays significant roles in promoting strength and cardiorespiratory function in healthy persons and athletes due to the key role of magnesium in the energetic metabolism, transmem-brane transport, muscle contraction, hydra-tion, oxidative stress and immune function. Surveys of athletes reveal that frequently, these individuals fail to consume a diet that eontains adequate amounts of minerals, in-eluding magnesium. Individuals engaged in intense exercise should have a magnesium requirement 10-20% higher than the average sedentary person, because of increased losses through sweat and urine. Magnesium deficit is associated with muscle weakness, cramps, and structural damage of muscle fibers and organelles, probably as a result of increased production of reactive oxygen species, lipid and protein damage, and impaired cation homeostasis. This may result in substandard training and impaired performance. Regarding the effect of magnesium intake on muscle performance, few studies were conducted, especially in elite athletes. In this paper we are going to summarize some of our recent research in this area regarding the association between magnesium status, intracellular water and strength and power performance in elite combat sports and team sports athletes. In these studies we have observed that magnesium deficit is associated with strength and power limitation, therefore affecting muscle performance. We might highlight the importance of evaluating magnesium status, not only because its deficit may compromise performance, but also because the practice of exercise with a magnesium deficit may render the athlete more susceptible to cellular damage.\n\nMuscle injuries and lactate overload during training or at the end of the season, in top team sports, quickly preclude optimal results and participation. Is total magnesium deficiency responsible for these problems in elite athletes and whether magnesium supplementation improves their muscle metabolism or lactate-pyruvate-metabolism? Methods: In 55 elite athletes [male: 25 – female: 30 / soccer: 26 – Olympics: 14 – tennis: 15 – motorsports (DTM-Formula1): whole blood magnesium were determined. In 25 athletes serum and whole blood magnesium, creatine kinase (CK), venous pyruvate and lactate, and the mitochondrial energy level ATP were determined before and after 3 months of daily supplementation with 370mg magnesium and statistically correlated. A Spearman-ranking coefficient of correlation, a chi-quadrat-test by Pearson, and an independent t-test were used with p<0.05 this value is reliable, p<0.01 highly significant. Results: In 27. 1% of all elite athletes (N=18/55) a whole blood magnesium deficiency (vMg<1.29 mmol/l) was proved. Female athletes were significantly worst supplied than the male athletes [vMg: 1.33 ± 0.11 mmol/l vs. 1.41 ± 0.13 mmol/l (p<0.024].Whole blood magnesium (1.31 ± 0.15 mmol/l before vs 1.45 ± 0.09 mmol/l after therapy, p<0.00025), serum magnesium (0.78 ± 0.06 mmol/l before vs 0.93 ± 0.05 mmol/l after therapy, p<0.00025), the venous pyruvate (0.21 ± 0.12 mg/dl before vs 0.39 ± 0.10 mg/dl after therapy, p<0.00025) and mitochondrial ATP (90.56 ± 10.11 %T cells before vs 99.07 ± 1.21 %T cells after therapy, p<0.00025) significantly increased after 3 months supplementation of 370mg magnesiumoxide. Venouslactate (10.62 ± 3.50 mg/dl vs. 8.08 ± 2.09 mg/dl after therapy, p<0.0025), the pyruvate lactate ratio (69.98 ± 52.81 vs. 22.93 ± 12.29 after therapy, p<0.00025) and the creatine kinase CK (501 ± 323 U/l before vs. 294 ± 161 U/l after therapy, p=0.018) significantly reduced under 3-months old daily magnesium substitution. For each 0.1 mmol/l increase in whole blood magnesium, the pyruvate improves significantly by 0,06 mg/dl and the pyruvate lactate ratio decreases significantly by 90.9. The improvement of the pyruvate as well as the pyruvate lactate ratio leads to a significant improvement in muscularity metabolism (CK) [increase by 0.1 mg/dl pyruvate decreases CK by 89.39, p=0.018, reduction of lactate pyruvate ratio decreases CK by 25.45, p=0.008). An absolute risk reduction of 68% (18/25 before vs 1/25 after therapy) could be calculated for muscular injuries. No side influences were reported. Conclusion: The determination of serum magnesium in elite sports is not meaningful. Whole blood magnesium (vMg), on the other hand, plays a significant role in the prevention of muscularity injuries, independently of the type of sports, by optimizing pyruvate lactate metabolism and thus mitochondrial energy production ATP. Further treatment studies have to prove if optimizing whole blood magnesium can lead to an increase in performance."
