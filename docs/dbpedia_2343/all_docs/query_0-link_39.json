        "text": "Active chiral control of GHz acoustic whispering-gallery modes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMezil, Sylvain; Fujita, Kentaro; Otsuka, Paul H.; Tomoda, Motonobu; Clark, Matt; Wright, Oliver B.; Matsuda, Osamu\n\n2017-10-01\n\nWe selectively generate chiral surface-acoustic whispering-gallery modes in the gigahertz range on a microscopic disk by means of an ultrafast time-domain technique incorporating a spatial light modulator. Active chiral control is achieved by making use of an optical pump spatial profile in the form of a semicircular arc, positioned on the sample to break the symmetry of clockwise- and counterclockwise-propagating modes. Spatiotemporal Fourier transforms of the interferometrically monitored two-dimensional acoustic fields measured to micron resolution allow individual chiral modes and their azimuthal mode order, both positive and negative, to be distinguished. In particular, for modes with 15-fold rotational symmetry, we demonstrate ultrafast chiral control of surface acoustic waves in a micro-acoustic system with picosecond temporal resolution. Applications include nondestructive testing and surface acoustic wave devices.\n\nActive vibration and noise control of vibro-acoustic system by using PID controller\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Yunlong; Wang, Xiaojun; Huang, Ren; Qiu, Zhiping\n\n2015-07-01\n\nActive control simulation of the acoustic and vibration response of a vibro-acoustic cavity of an airplane based on a PID controller is presented. A full numerical vibro-acoustic model is developed by using an Eulerian model, which is a coupled model based on the finite element formulation. The reduced order model, which is used to design the closed-loop control system, is obtained by the combination of modal expansion and variable substitution. Some physical experiments are made to validate and update the full-order and the reduced-order numerical models. Optimization of the actuator placement is employed in order to get an effective closed-loop control system. For the controller design, an iterative method is used to determine the optimal parameters of the PID controller. The process is illustrated by the design of an active noise and vibration control system for a cavity structure. The numerical and experimental results show that a PID-based active control system can effectively suppress the noise inside the cavity using a sound pressure signal as the controller input. It is also possible to control the noise by suppressing the vibration of the structure using the structural displacement signal as the controller input. For an airplane cavity structure, considering the issue of space-saving, the latter is more suitable.\n\nNumerical Comparison of Active Acoustic and Structural Noise Control in a Stiffened Double Wall Cylinder\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGrosveld, Ferdinand W.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThe active acoustic and structural noise control characteristics of a double wall cylinder with and without ring stiffeners were numerically evaluated. An exterior monopole was assumed to acoustically excite the outside of the double wall cylinder at an acoustic cavity resonance frequency. Structural modal vibration properties of the inner and outer shells were analyzed by post-processing the results from a finite element analysis. A boundary element approach was used to calculate the acoustic cavity response and the coupled structural-acoustic interaction. In the frequency region of interest, below 500 Hz, all structural resonant modes were found to be acoustically slow and the nonresonant modal response to be dominant. Active sound transmission control was achieved by control forces applied to the inner or outer shell, or acoustic control monopoles placed just outside the inner or outer shell. A least mean square technique was used to minimize the interior sound pressures at the nodes of a data recovery mesh. Results showed that single acoustic control monopoles placed just outside the inner or outer shells resulted in better sound transmission control than six distributed point forces applied to either one of the shells. Adding stiffeners to the double wall structure constrained the modal vibrations of the shells, making the double wall stiffer with associated higher modal frequencies. Active noise control obtained for the stiffened double wall configurations was less than for the unstiffened cylinder. In all cases, the acoustic control monopoles controlled the sound transmission into the interior better than the structural control forces.\n\nAcoustic Aspects of Active-Twist Rotor Control\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBooth, Earl R., Jr.; Wilbur, Matthew L.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe use of an Active Twist Rotor system to provide both vibration reduction and performance enhancement has been explored in recent analytical and experimental studies. Effects of active-twist control on rotor noise, however, had not been determined. During a recent wind tunnel test of an active-twist rotor system, a set of acoustic measurements were obtained to assess the effects of active-twist control on noise produced by the rotor, especially blade-vortex interaction (BVI) noise. It was found that for rotor operating conditions where BVI noise is dominant, active-twist control provided a reduction in BVI noise level. This BVI noise reduction was almost, but not quite, as large as that obtained in a similar test using HHC. However, vibration levels were usually adversely affected at operating conditions favoring minimum BVI noise. Conversely, operating conditions favoring minimum vibration levels affected BVI noise levels, but not always adversely.\n\nActive structural acoustic control of noise transmission through double panel systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCarneal, James P.; Fuller, Chris R.\n\n1995-04-01\n\nA preliminary parametric study of active control of sound transmission through double panel systems has been experimentally performed. The technique used is the active structural acoustic control (ASAC) approach where control inputs, in the form of piezoelectric actuators, were applied to the structure while the radiated pressure field was minimized. Results indicate the application of control inputs to the radiating panel resulted in greater transmission loss due to its direct effect on the nature of the structural-acoustic coupling between the radiating panel and the receiving chamber. Increased control performance was seen in a double panel system consisting of a stiffer radiating panel with a lower modal density. As expected, more effective control of a radiating panel excited on-resonance is achieved over one excited off-resonance. In general, the results validate the ASAC approach for double panel systems and demonstrate that it is possible to take advantage of double panel behavior to enhance control performance, although it is clear that further research must be done to understand the physics involved.\n\nA curved piezo-structure model: implications on active structural acoustic control.\n\nPubMed\n\nHenry, J K; Clark, R L\n\n1999-09-01\n\nCurrent research in Active Structural Acoustic Control (ASAC) relies heavily upon accurately capturing the application physics associated with the structure being controlled. The application of ASAC to aircraft interior noise requires a greater understanding of the dynamics of the curved panels which compose the skin of an aircraft fuselage. This paper presents a model of a simply supported curved panel with attached piezoelectric transducers. The model is validated by comparison to previous work. Further, experimental results for a simply supported curved panel test structure are presented in support of the model. The curvature is shown to affect substantially the dynamics of the panel, the integration of transducers, and the bandwidth required for structural acoustic control.\n\nA numerical study of active structural acoustic control in a stiffened, double wall cylinder\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGrosveld, Ferdinand W.; Coats, T. J.; Lester, H. C.; Silcox, R. J.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nIt is demonstrated that active structural acoustic control of complex structural/acoustic coupling can be numerically modeled using finite element and boundary element techniques in conjunction with an optimization procedure to calculate control force amplitudes. Appreciable noise reduction is obtained when the structure is excited at a structural resonance of the outer shell or an acoustic resonance of the inner cavity. Adding ring stiffeners as a connection between the inner and outer shells provides an additional structural transmission path to the interior cavity and coupled the modal behavior of the inner and outer shells. For the case of excitation at the structural resonance of the unstiffened outer shell, adding the stiffeners raises the structural resonance frequencies. The effectiveness of the control forces is reduced due to the off resonance structural response. For excitation at an acoustic cavity resonance, the controller effectiveness is enhanced.\n\nAdaptive piezoelectric sensoriactuators for active structural acoustic control\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVipperman, Jeffrey Stuart\n\n1997-09-01\n\npiezostructures were used to demonstrate and verify the adaptive piezoelectric sensoriactuator, a cantilevered beam and a simply-supported plate. The experimental open- loop results compare well with theory. A preliminary closed-loop rate controller applied to the cantilevered beam demonstrates simultaneous control and adaptation of the piezoelectric sensoriactuator. Lastly, [/cal H]2 optimal feedback Active Structural Acoustic Control (ASAC) is demonstrated using the adaptive piezoelectric sensoriactuators and the simply- supported plate test bed. A cost function is formulated based upon control effort and predicted radiated acoustic power. Radiation filters are created to predict acoustic power based on the self and mutual radiation efficiencies of the plate modes to be controlled. Both static output feedback and state-feedback compensation as well as dynamic (Linear Quadratic Gaussian) compensation are investigated and compared analytically. The importance of choosing an appropriate spatial aperture for the piezoceramic transducer for static compensation is discussed. Finally, multivariable Active Vibration Control (AVC) and ASAC are implemented experimentally on a simply-supported plate test bed using an array of four Adaptive Piezoelectric Sensoriactuators as the control sensors and actuators. Unfavorable high-frequency response from the given piezoceramic transducers required that dynamic, Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) compensation be used to achieve good control performance.\n\nPiezoceramic Actuator Placement for Acoustic Control of Panels\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBevan, Jeffrey S.; Turner, Travis L. (Technical Monitor)\n\n2001-01-01\n\nOptimum placement of multiple traditional piezoceramic actuators is determined for active structural acoustic control of flat panels. The structural acoustic response is determined using acoustic radiation filters and structural surface vibration characteristics. Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control is utilized to determine the optimum state feedback gain for active structural acoustic control. The optimum actuator location is determined by minimizing the structural acoustic radiated noise using a modified genetic algorithm. Experimental tests are conducted and compared to analytical results. Anisotropic piezoceramic actuators exhibits enhanced performance when compared to traditional isotropic piezoceramic actuators. As a result of the inherent isotropy, these advanced actuators develop strain along the principal material axis. The orientation of anisotropic actuators is investigated on the effect of structural vibration and acoustic control of curved and flat panels. A fully coupled shallow shell finite element formulation is developed to include anisotropic piezoceramic actuators for shell structures.\n\nPiezoceramic Actuator Placement for Acoustic Control of Panels\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBevan, Jeffrey S.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nOptimum placement of multiple traditional piezoceramic actuators is determined for active structural acoustic control of flat panels.

The proposed virtual sensor was designed to estimate a broadband acoustic interior sound pressure using structural sensors, with robustness against certain dynamic uncertainties occurring in an acoustic-structural coupled enclosure. A convex combination of Kalman sub-filters was used during the design, accommodating different sets of perturbed dynamic model of the vibro-acoustic enclosure. A minimax optimization problem was set up to determine an optimal convex combination of Kalman sub-filters, ensuring an optimal worst-case virtual sensing performance. The virtual sensing and active noise control performance was numerically investigated on a rectangular panel-cavity system. It was demonstrated that the proposed virtual sensor could accurately estimate the interior sound pressure, particularly the one dominated by cavity-controlled modes, by using a structural sensor. With such a virtual sensing technique, effective active noise control performance was also obtained even for the worst-case dynamics. Â© 2011 Acoustical Society of America\n\nCavitation controlled acoustic probe for fabric spot cleaning and moisture monitoring\n\nDOEpatents\n\nSheen, Shuh-Haw; Chien, Hual-Te; Raptis, Apostolos C.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nA method and apparatus are provided for monitoring a fabric. An acoustic probe generates acoustic waves relative to the fabric. An acoustic sensor, such as an accelerometer is coupled to the acoustic probe for generating a signal representative of cavitation activity in the fabric. The generated cavitation activity representative signal is processed to indicate moisture content of the fabric. A feature of the invention is a feedback control signal is generated responsive to the generated cavitation activity representative signal. The feedback control signal can be used to control the energy level of the generated acoustic waves and to control the application of a cleaning solution to the fabric.\n\nToward wideband steerable acoustic metasurfaces with arrays of active electroacoustic resonators\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLissek, HervÃ©; Rivet, Etienne; Laurence, Thomas; Fleury, Romain\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe introduce an active concept for achieving acoustic metasurfaces with steerable reflection properties, effective over a wide frequency band. The proposed active acoustic metasurface consists of a surface array of subwavelength loudspeaker diaphragms, each with programmable individual active acoustic impedances allowing for local control over the different reflection phases over the metasurface. The active control framework used for controlling the reflection phase over the metasurface is derived from the Active Electroacoustic Resonator concept. Each unit-cell simply consists of a current-driven electrodynamic loudspeaker in a closed box, whose acoustic impedance at the diaphragm is judiciously adjusted by connecting an active electrical control circuit. The control is known to achieve a wide variety of acoustic impedances on a single loudspeaker diaphragm used as an acoustic resonator, with the possibility to shift its resonance frequency by more than one octave. This paper presents a methodology for designing such active metasurface elements. An experimental validation of the achieved individual reflection coefficients is presented, and full wave simulations present a few examples of achievable reflection properties, with a focus on the bandwidth of operation of the proposed control concept.\n\nStructural sensing of interior sound for active control of noise in structural-acoustic cavities.\n\nPubMed\n\nBagha, Ashok K; Modak, S V\n\n2015-07-01\n\nThis paper proposes a method for structural sensing of acoustic potential energy for active control of noise in a structural-acoustic cavity. The sensing strategy aims at global control and works with a fewer number of sensors. It is based on the established concept of radiation modes and hence does not add too many states to the order of the system. Acoustic potential energy is sensed using a combination of a Kalman filter and a frequency weighting filter with the structural response measurements as the inputs. The use of Kalman filter also makes the system robust against measurement noise. The formulation of the strategy is presented using finite element models of the system including that of sensors and actuators so that it can be easily applied to practical systems. The sensing strategy is numerically evaluated in the framework of Linear Quadratic Gaussian based feedback control of interior noise in a rectangular box cavity with a flexible plate with single and multiple pairs of piezoelectric sensor-actuator patches when broadband disturbances act on the plate. The performance is compared with an \"acoustic filter\" that models the complete transfer function from the structure to the acoustic domain. The sensing performance is also compared with a direct estimation strategy.\n\nActive control of acoustic pressure fields using smart material technologies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBanks, H. T.; Smith, R. C.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nAn overview describing the use of piezoceramic patches in reducing noise in a structural acoustics setting is presented. The passive and active contributions due to patches which are bonded to an Euler-Bernoulli beam or thin shell are briefly discussed and the results are incorporated into a 2-D structural acoustics model. In this model, an exterior noise source causes structural vibrations which in turn lead to interior noise as a result of nonlinear fluid/structure coupling mechanism. Interior sound pressure levels are reduced via patches bonded to the flexible boundary (a beam in this case) which generate pure bending moments when an out-of-phase voltage is applied. Well-posedness results for the infinite dimensional system are discussed and a Galerkin scheme for approximating the system dynamics is outlined. Control is implemented by using linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimal control theory to calculate gains for the linearized system and then feeding these gains back into the nonlinear system of interest. The effectiveness of this strategy for this problem is illustrated in an example.\n\nAn analytical and experimental investigation of active structural acoustic control of noise transmission through double panel systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCarneal, James P.; Fuller, Chris R.\n\n2004-05-01\n\nAn analytical and experimental investigation of active control of sound transmission through double panel systems has been performed. The technique used was active structural acoustic control (ASAC) where the control inputs, in the form of piezoelectric actuators, were applied to the structure while the radiating pressure field was minimized. Results verify earlier experimental investigations and indicate the application of control inputs to the radiating panel of the double panel system resulted in greater transmission loss (TL) due to its direct effect on the nature of the structural-acoustic (or radiation) coupling between the radiating panel and the receiving acoustic space. Increased control performance was seen in a double panel system consisting of a stiffer radiating panel due to its lower modal density and also as a result of better impedance matching between the piezoelectric actuator and the radiating plate. In general the results validate the ASAC approach for double panel systems, demonstrating that it is possible to take advantage of double panel system passive behavior to enhance control performance, and provide design guidelines.\n\nControllable asymmetric transmission via gap-tunable acoustic metasurface\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Bingyi; Jiang, Yongyuan\n\n2018-04-01\n\nIn this work, we utilize the acoustic gradient metasurface (AGM) of a bilayer configuration to realize the controllable asymmetric transmission. Relying on the adjustable gap between the two composing layers, the metasurface could switch from symmetric transmission to asymmetric transmission at a certain gap value. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the interference between the forward diffracted waves scattered by the surface bound waves at two air-AGM interfaces, which is apparently influenced by the interlayer distance. We further utilize the hybrid acoustic elements to construct the desired gradient metasurface with a tunable gap and validate the controllable asymmetric transmission with full-wave simulations. Our work provides the solution for actively controlling the transmission property of an acoustic element, which shows potential application in acoustic communication as a dynamic tunable acoustic diode.\n\nBroadband acoustic phased array with subwavelength active tube array\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Xiao-Yan; Yang, Zhang-Zhao; Zhu, Yi-Fan; Zou, Xin-Ye; Cheng, Jian-Chun\n\n2018-02-01\n\nAcoustic metasurfaces provide a way to manipulate wavefronts at anomalous reflection or refraction angles through subwavelength structures. Here, based on the generalized Snell's refraction law for acoustic metasurfaces and the classical acoustic phased array (PA) theory, a broadband acoustic PA with a subwavelength active tube array has been proposed to form a special acoustic beam and to determine the directivity characteristics of the acoustic source. Theoretical analysis shows that the dispersionless wavefront manipulation can be realized by the gradient model of the active tube array, and a wide working frequency band can be obtained in practical applications from the simulated and experimental results. The numerical results of forming a special acoustic beam and establishing an acoustic focus model with an arbitrary focal position are consistent with the theoretical predictions. The experimental results agree well with the simulated results in the model of forming the acoustic beam of 45 Â° . By combining acoustic metamaterials and conventional acoustic PA, the model of the active tube array paves a way to design a composite acoustic PA with high radiation efficiency and system robustness without the need for any complex circuit control system. This design concept is expected to be used in the design of ultrasonic therapy devices and high-efficiency transducers.\n\nVibro-acoustic model of an active aircraft cabin window\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAloufi, Badr; Behdinan, Kamran; Zu, Jean\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThis paper presents modeling and design of an active structural acoustic control (ASAC) system for controlling the low frequency sound field transmitted through an aircraft cabin window. The system uses stacked piezoelectric elements arranged in a manner to generate out-of-plane actuation point forces acting on the window panel boundaries. A theoretical vibro-acoustic model for an active quadruple-panel system is developed to characterize the dynamic behavior of the system and achieve a good understanding of the active control performance and the physical phenomena of the sound transmission loss (STL) characteristics. The quadruple-panel system represents the passenger window design used in some classes of modern aircraft with an exterior double pane of Plexiglas, an interior dust cover pane and a glazed dimmable pane, all separated by thin air cavities. The STL characteristics of identical pane window configurations with different piezoelectric actuator sets are analyzed. A parametric study describes the influence of important active parameters, such as the input voltage, number and location of the actuator elements, on the STL is investigated. In addition, a mathematical model for obtaining the optimal input voltage is developed to improve the acoustic attenuation capability of the control system. In general, the achieved results indicate that the proposed ASAC design offers a considerable improvement in the passive sound loss performance of cabin window design without significant effects, such as weight increase, on the original design. Also, the results show that the acoustic control of the active model with piezoelectric actuators bonded to the dust cover pane generates high structural vibrations in the radiating panel (dust cover) and an increase in sound power radiation. High active acoustic attenuation can be achieved by designing the ASAC system to apply active control forces on the inner Plexiglas panel or dimmable panel by installing the actuators on the\n\nStructural Acoustic Characteristics of Aircraft and Active Control of Interior Noise\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFuller, C. R.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe reduction of aircraft cabin sound levels to acceptable values still remains a topic of much research. The use of conventional passive approaches has been extensively studied and implemented. However performance limits of these techniques have been reached. In this project, new techniques for understanding the structural acoustic behavior of aircraft fuselages and the use of this knowledge in developing advanced new control approaches are investigated. A central feature of the project is the Aircraft Fuselage Test Facility at Va Tech which is based around a full scale Cessna Citation III fuselage. The work is divided into two main parts; the first part investigates the use of an inverse technique for identifying dominant fuselage vibrations. The second part studies the development and implementation of active and active-passive techniques for controlling aircraft interior noise.\n\nAcoustic manipulation: Bessel beams and active carriers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRajabi, Majid; Mojahed, Alireza\n\n2017-10-01\n\nIn this paper, we address the interaction of zero-order acoustic Bessel beams as an acoustic manipulation tool, with an active spherical shell, as a carrier in drug, agent, or material delivery systems, in order to investigate the controllability of exerted acoustic radiation force as the driver. The active body is comprised of a spherical elastic shell stimulated in its monopole mode of vibrations with the same frequency as the incident wave field via an internally bonded and spatially uniformly excited piezoelectric actuator. The main aim of this work is to examine the performance of a nondiffracting and self-reconstructing zero-order Bessel beam to obtain the full manipulability condition of active carriers in comparison with the case of a plane wave field. The results unveil some unique potentials of the Bessel beams in the company of active carriers, with emphasis on the consumed power of the actuation system. This paper will widen the path toward the single-beam robust acoustic manipulation techniques and may lead to the prospect of combined tweezers and fields, with applications in delivery systems, microswimmers, and trapper designs.\n\nThe optimization of force inputs for active structural acoustic control using a neural network\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCabell, R. H.; Lester, H. C.; Silcox, R. J.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThis paper investigates the use of a neural network to determine which force actuators, of a multi-actuator array, are best activated in order to achieve structural-acoustic control. The concept is demonstrated using a cylinder/cavity model on which the control forces, produced by piezoelectric actuators, are applied with the objective of reducing the interior noise. A two-layer neural network is employed and the back propagation solution is compared with the results calculated by a conventional, least-squares optimization analysis. The ability of the neural network to accurately and efficiently control actuator activation for interior noise reduction is demonstrated.\n\nBaseline acoustic levels of the NASA Active Noise Control Fan rig\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSutliff, Daniel L.; Heidelberg, Laurence J.; Elliott, David M.; Nallasamy, M.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nExtensive measurements of the spinning acoustic mode structure in the NASA 48 inch Active Noise Control Fan (ANCF) test rig have been taken. A continuously rotating microphone rake system with a least-squares data reduction technique was employed to measure these modes in the inlet and exhaust. Farfield directivity patterns in an anechoic environment were also measured at matched corrected rotor speeds. Several vane counts and spacings were tested over a range of rotor speeds. The Eversman finite element radiation code was run with the measured in-duct modes as input and the computed farfield results were compared to the experimentally measured directivity pattern. The experimental data show that inlet spinning mode measurements can be made very accurately. Exhaust mode measurements may have wake interference, but the least-squares reduction does a good job of rejecting the non-acoustic pressure. The Eversman radiation code accurately extrapolates the farfield levels and directivity pattern when all in-duct modes are included.\n\nControlling Sample Rotation in Acoustic Levitation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBarmatz, M. B.; Stoneburner, J. D.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nRotation of acoustically levitated object stopped or controlled according to phase-shift monitoring and control concept. Principle applies to square-cross-section levitation chamber with two perpendicular acoustic drivers operating at same frequency. Phase difference between X and Y acoustic excitation measured at one corner by measuring variation of acoustic amplitude sensed by microphone. Phase of driver adjusted to value that produces no rotation or controlled rotation of levitated object.\n\nVentilation duct with concurrent acoustic feed-forward and decentralised structural feedback active control\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRohlfing, J.; Gardonio, P.\n\n2014-02-01\n\nThis paper presents theoretical and experimental work on concurrent active noise and vibration control for a ventilation duct. The active noise control system is used to reduce the air-borne noise radiated via the duct outlet whereas the active vibration control system is used to both reduce the structure-borne noise radiated by the duct wall and to minimise the structural feed-through effect that reduces the effectiveness of the active noise control system. An elemental model based on structural mobility functions and acoustic impedance functions has been developed to investigate the principal effects and limitations of feed-forward active noise control and decentralised velocity feedback vibration control. The principal simulation results have been contrasted and validated with measurements taken on a laboratory duct set-up, equipped with an active noise control system and a decentralised vibration control system. Both simulations and experimental results show that the air-borne noise radiated from the duct outlet can be significantly attenuated using the feed-forward active noise control. In the presence of structure-borne noise the performance of the active noise control system is impaired by a structure-borne feed-through effect. Also the sound radiation from the duct wall is increased. In this case, if the active noise control is combined with a concurrent active vibration control system, the sound radiation by the duct outlet is further reduced and the sound radiation from the duct wall at low frequencies reduces noticeably.\n\nAn active structural acoustic control approach for the reduction of the structure-borne road noise\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDouville, Hugo; Berry, Alain; Masson, Patrice\n\n2002-11-01\n\nThe reduction of the structure-borne road noise generated inside the cabin of an automobile is investigated using an Active Structural Acoustic Control (ASAC) approach. First, a laboratory test bench consisting of a wheel/suspension/lower suspension A-arm assembly has been developed in order to identify the vibroacoustic transfer paths (up to 250 Hz) for realistic road noise excitation of the wheel. Frequency Response Function (FRF) measurements between the excitation/control actuators and each suspension/chassis linkage are used to characterize the different transfer paths that transmit energy through the chassis of the car. Second, a FE/BE model (Finite/Boundary Elements) was developed to simulate the acoustic field of an automobile cab interior. This model is used to predict the acoustic field inside the cabin as a response to the measured forces applied on the suspension/chassis linkages. Finally, an experimental implementation of ASAC is presented. The control approach relies on the use of inertial actuators to modify the vibration behavior of the suspension and the automotive chassis such that its noise radiation efficiency is decreased. The implemented algorithm consists of a MIMO (Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output) feedforward configuration with a filtered-X LMS algorithm using an advanced reference signal (width FIR filters) using the Simulink/Dspace environment for control prototyping.\n\nAcoustic controlled rotation and orientation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBarmatz, Martin B. (Inventor); Allen, James L. (Inventor)\n\n1989-01-01\n\nAcoustic energy is applied to a pair of locations spaced about a chamber, to control rotation of an object levitated in the chamber. Two acoustic transducers applying energy of a single acoustic mode, one at each location, can (one or both) serve to levitate the object in three dimensions as well as control its rotation. Slow rotation is achieved by initially establishing a large phase difference and/or pressure ratio of the acoustic waves, which is sufficient to turn the object by more than 45 deg, which is immediately followed by reducing the phase difference and/or pressure ratio to maintain slow rotation. A small phase difference and/or pressure ratio enables control of the angular orientation of the object without rotating it. The sphericity of an object can be measured by its response to the acoustic energy.\n\nVirtual sensors for active noise control in acoustic-structural coupled enclosures using structural sensing: part II--Optimization of structural sensor placement.\n\nPubMed\n\nHalim, Dunant; Cheng, Li; Su, Zhongqing\n\n2011-04-01\n\nThe work proposed an optimization approach for structural sensor placement to improve the performance of vibro-acoustic virtual sensor for active noise control applications. The vibro-acoustic virtual sensor was designed to estimate the interior sound pressure of an acoustic-structural coupled enclosure using structural sensors. A spectral-spatial performance metric was proposed, which was used to quantify the averaged structural sensor output energy of a vibro-acoustic system excited by a spatially varying point source. It was shown that (i) the overall virtual sensing error energy was contributed additively by the modal virtual sensing error and the measurement noise energy; (ii) each of the modal virtual sensing error system was contributed by both the modal observability levels for the structural sensing and the target acoustic virtual sensing; and further (iii) the strength of each modal observability level was influenced by the modal coupling and resonance frequencies of the associated uncoupled structural/cavity modes. An optimal design of structural sensor placement was proposed to achieve sufficiently high modal observability levels for certain important panel- and cavity-controlled modes. Numerical analysis on a panel-cavity system demonstrated the importance of structural sensor placement on virtual sensing and active noise control performance, particularly for cavity-controlled modes.\n\nActive structural acoustic control of helicopter interior multifrequency noise using input-output-based hybrid control\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMa, Xunjun; Lu, Yang; Wang, Fengjiao\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThis paper presents the recent advances in reduction of multifrequency noise inside helicopter cabin using an active structural acoustic control system, which is based on active gearbox struts technical approach. To attenuate the multifrequency gearbox vibrations and resulting noise, a new scheme of discrete model predictive sliding mode control has been proposed based on controlled auto-regressive moving average model. Its implementation only needs input/output data, hence a broader frequency range of controlled system is modelled and the burden on the state observer design is released. Furthermore, a new iteration form of the algorithm is designed, improving the developing efficiency and run speed. To verify the algorithm's effectiveness and self-adaptability, experiments of real-time active control are performed on a newly developed helicopter model system. The helicopter model can generate gear meshing vibration/noise similar to a real helicopter with specially designed gearbox and active struts. The algorithm's control abilities are sufficiently checked by single-input single-output and multiple-input multiple-output experiments via different feedback strategies progressively: (1) control gear meshing noise through attenuating vibrations at the key points on the transmission path, (2) directly control the gear meshing noise in the cabin using the actuators. Results confirm that the active control system is practical for cancelling multifrequency helicopter interior noise, which also weakens the frequency-modulation of the tones. For many cases, the attenuations of the measured noise exceed the level of 15 dB, with maximum reduction reaching 31 dB. Also, the control process is demonstrated to be smoother and faster.\n\nActive control of turbomachine discrete tones\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFleeter, Sanford\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThis paper was directed at active control of discrete frequency noise generated by subsonic blade rows through cancellation of the blade row interaction generated propagating acoustic waves. First discrete frequency noise generated by a rotor and stator in a duct was analyzed to determine the propagating acoustic pressure waves. Then a mathematical model was developed to analyze and predict the active control of discrete frequency noise generated by subsonic blade rows through cancellation of the propagating acoustic waves, accomplished by utilizing oscillating airfoil surfaces to generate additional control propagating pressure waves. These control waves interact with the propagating acoustic waves, thereby, in principle, canceling the acoustic waves and thus, the far field discrete frequency tones. This model was then applied to a fan exit guide vane to investigate active airfoil surface techniques for control of the propagating acoustic waves, and thus the far field discrete frequency tones, generated by blade row interactions.\n\nActive control of turbomachine discrete tones\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFleeter, Sanford\n\nThis paper was directed at active control of discrete frequency noise generated by subsonic blade rows through cancellation of the blade row interaction generated propagating acoustic waves.

However, a modern musician could prefer to have a single musical instrument whose acoustics are programmable by feedback control, where acoustic variables are estimated from sensor measurements in real time and then fed back in order to influence the controlled variables. In this paper, theory is presented that describes stable feedback control of an acoustic musical instrument. The presentation should be accessible to members of the musical acoustics community who may have limited or no experience with feedback control. First, the only control strategy guaranteed to be stable subject to any musical instrument mobility is described: the sensors and actuators must be collocated, and the controller must emulate a physical analog system. Next, the most fundamental feedback controllers and the corresponding physical analog systems are presented. The effects that these controllers have on acoustic musical instruments are described. Finally, practical design challenges are discussed. A proof explains why changing the resonance frequency of a musical resonance requires much more control power than changing the decay time of the resonance.

This system has been under development at Yamaha Corporation for more than 15 years and has been installed in approximately 50 venues in Japan to date. AFC utilizes feedback control techniques for recreation of reverberation from the physical reverberation of the room. In order to prevent coloration problems caused by a closed loop condition, two types of time-varying control techniques are implemented in the AFC system to ensure smooth loop gain and a sufficient margin in frequency characteristics to prevent instability. Those are: (a) EMR (electric microphone rotator) -smoothing frequency responses between microphones and speakers by changing the combinations of inputs and outputs periodically; (b) fluctuating-FIR -smoothing frequency responses of FIR filters and preventing coloration problems caused by fixed FIR filters, by moving each FIR tap periodically on time axis with a different phase and time period. In this paper, these techniques are summarized. A block diagram of AFC using new equipment named AFC1, which has been developed at Yamaha Corporation and released recently in the US, is also presented.\n\nOptical Sensor/Actuator Locations for Active Structural Acoustic Control\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPadula, Sharon L.; Palumbo, Daniel L.; Kincaid, Rex K.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nResearchers at NASA Langley Research Center have extensive experience using active structural acoustic control (ASAC) for aircraft interior noise reduction. One aspect of ASAC involves the selection of optimum locations for microphone sensors and force actuators. This paper explains the importance of sensor/actuator selection, reviews optimization techniques, and summarizes experimental and numerical results. Three combinatorial optimization problems are described. Two involve the determination of the number and position of piezoelectric actuators, and the other involves the determination of the number and location of the sensors. For each case, a solution method is suggested, and typical results are examined. The first case, a simplified problem with simulated data, is used to illustrate the method. The second and third cases are more representative of the potential of the method and use measured data. The three case studies and laboratory test results establish the usefulness of the numerical methods.\n\nDesign and implementation of multichannel global active structural acoustic control for a device casing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMazur, Krzysztof; Wrona, Stanislaw; Pawelczyk, Marek\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe paper presents the idea and discussion on implementation of multichannel global active noise control systems. As a test plant an active casing is used. It has been developed by the authors to reduce device noise directly at the source by controlling vibration of its casing. To provide global acoustic effect in the whole environment, where the device operates, it requires a number of secondary sources and sensors for each casing wall, thus making the whole active control structure complicated, i.e. with a large number of interacting channels. The paper discloses all details concerning hardware setup and efficient implementation of control algorithms for the multichannel case. A new formulation is presented to introduce the distributed version of the Switched-error Filtered-reference Least Mean Squares (FXLMS) algorithm together with adaptation rate enhancement. The convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is compared with original Multiple-error FXLMS. A number of hints followed from many years of authors' experience on microprocessor control systems design and signal processing algorithms optimization are presented. They can be used for various active control and signal processing applications, both for academic research and commercialization.\n\nActive acoustical impedance using distributed electrodynamical transducers.\n\nPubMed\n\nCollet, M; David, P; Berthillier, M\n\n2009-02-01\n\nNew miniaturization and integration capabilities available from emerging microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology will allow silicon-based artificial skins involving thousands of elementary actuators to be developed in the near future. SMART structures combining large arrays of elementary motion pixels coated with macroscopic components are thus being studied so that fundamental properties such as shape, stiffness, and even reflectivity of light and sound could be dynamically adjusted. This paper investigates the acoustic impedance capabilities of a set of distributed transducers connected with a suitable controlling strategy. Research in this domain aims at designing integrated active interfaces with a desired acoustical impedance for reaching an appropriate global acoustical behavior. This generic problem is intrinsically connected with the control of multiphysical systems based on partial differential equations (PDEs) and with the notion of multiscaled physics when a dense array of electromechanical systems (or MEMS) is considered. By using specific techniques based on PDE control theory, a simple boundary control equation capable of annihilating the wave reflections has been built. The obtained strategy is also discretized as a low order time-space operator for experimental implementation by using a dense network of interlaced microphones and loudspeakers. The resulting quasicollocated architecture guarantees robustness and stability margins. This paper aims at showing how a well controlled semidistributed active skin can substantially modify the sound transmissibility or reflectivity of the corresponding homogeneous passive interface. In Sec. IV, numerical and experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of such a method for controlling sound propagation in ducts. Finally, in Sec. V, an energy-based comparison with a classical open-loop strategy underlines the system's efficiency.\n\nHybrid passive/active damping for robust multivariable acoustic control in composite plates\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVeeramani, Sudha; Wereley, Norman M.\n\n1996-05-01\n\nNoise transmission through a flexible kevlar-epoxy composite trim panel into an acoustic cavity or box is studied with the intent of controlling the interior sound fields. A hybrid noise attenuation technique is proposed which uses viscoelastic damping layers in the composite plate for passive attenuation of high frequency noise transmission, and uses piezo-electric patch actuators for active control in the low frequency range. An adaptive feedforward noise control strategy is applied. The passive structural damping augmentation incorporated in the composite plates is also intended to increase stability robustness of the active noise control strategy. A condenser microphone in the interior of the enclosure functions as the error sensor. Three composite plates were experimentally evaluated: one with no damping layer, the second with a 10 mil damping layer, and the third with a 15 mil damping layer. The damping layer was cocured in the kevlar-epoxy trim panels. Damping in the plates was increased from 1.6% for the plate with no damping layer, to 5.9% for the plate with a 15 mil damping layer. In experimental studies, the improved stability robustness of the controller was demonstrated by improved adaptive feedforward control algorithm convergence. A preliminary analytical model is presented that describes the dynamic behavior of a composite panel actuated by piezoelectric actuators bonded to its surface.\n\nActive Control of Fan Noise: Feasibility Study. Volume 5; Numerical Computation of Acoustic Mode Reflection Coefficients for an Unflanged Cylindrical Duct\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKraft, R. E.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nA computational method to predict modal reflection coefficients in cylindrical ducts has been developed based on the work of Homicz, Lordi, and Rehm, which uses the Wiener-Hopf method to account for the boundary conditions at the termination of a thin cylindrical pipe. The purpose of this study is to develop a computational routine to predict the reflection coefficients of higher order acoustic modes impinging on the unflanged termination of a cylindrical duct. This effort was conducted wider Task Order 5 of the NASA Lewis LET Program, Active Noise Control of aircraft Engines: Feasibility Study, and will be used as part of the development of an integrated source noise, acoustic propagation, ANC actuator coupling, and control system algorithm simulation. The reflection coefficient prediction will be incorporated into an existing cylindrical duct modal analysis to account for the reflection of modes from the duct termination. This will provide a more accurate, rapid computation design tool for evaluating the effect of reflected waves on active noise control systems mounted in the duct, as well as providing a tool for the design of acoustic treatment in inlet ducts. As an active noise control system design tool, the method can be used preliminary to more accurate but more numerically intensive acoustic propagation models such as finite element methods. The resulting computer program has been shown to give reasonable results, some examples of which are presented. Reliable data to use for comparison is scarce, so complete checkout is difficult, and further checkout is needed over a wider range of system parameters. In future efforts the method will be adapted as a subroutine to the GEAE segmented cylindrical duct modal analysis program.\n\nActive Control of Fan Noise-Feasibility Study. Volume 2: Canceling Noise Source-Design of an Acoustic Plate Radiator Using Piezoceramic Actuators\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPla, F. G.; Rajiyah, H.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe feasibility of using acoustic plate radiators powered by piezoceramic thin sheets as canceling sources for active control of aircraft engine fan noise is demonstrated. Analytical and numerical models of actuated beams and plates are developed and validated. An optimization study is performed to identify the optimum combination of design parameters that maximizes the plate volume velocity for a given resonance frequency. Fifteen plates with various plate and actuator sizes, thicknesses, and bonding layers were fabricated and tested using results from the optimization study. A maximum equivalent piston displacement of 0.39 mm was achieved with the optimized plate samples tested with only one actuator powered, corresponding to a plate deflection at the center of over 1 millimeter. This is very close to the deflection required for a full size engine application and represents a 160-fold improvement over previous work. Experimental results further show that performance is limited by the critical stress of the piezoceramic actuator and bonding layer rather than by the maximum moment available from the actuator. Design enhancements are described in detail that will lead to a flight-worthy acoustic plate radiator by minimizing actuator tensile stresses and reducing nonlinear effects. Finally, several adaptive tuning methods designed to increase the bandwidth of acoustic plate radiators are analyzed including passive, active, and semi-active approaches. The back chamber pressurization and volume variation methods are investigated experimentally and shown to be simple and effective ways to obtain substantial control over the resonance frequency of a plate radiator. This study shows that piezoceramic-based plate radiators can be a viable acoustic source for active control of aircraft engine fan noise.\n\nExperimental implementation of acoustic impedance control by a 2D network of distributed smart cells\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDavid, P.; Collet, M.; Cote, J.-M.\n\n2010-03-01\n\nNew miniaturization and integration capabilities available from emerging microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology will allow silicon-based artificial skins involving thousands of elementary actuators to be developed in the near future. Smart structures combining large arrays of elementary motion pixels are thus being studied so that fundamental properties could be dynamically adjusted. This paper investigates the acoustical capabilities of a network of distributed transducers connected with a suitable controlling strategy. The research aims at designing an integrated active interface for sound attenuation by using suitable changes of acoustical impedance. The control strategy is based on partial differential equations (PDE) and the multiscaled physics of electromechanical elements. Specific techniques based on PDE control theory have provided a simple boundary control equation able to annihilate the reflections of acoustic waves. To experimentally implement the method, the control strategy is discretized as a first order time-space operator. The obtained quasi-collocated architecture, composed of a large number of sensors and actuators, provides high robustness and stability. The experimental results demonstrate how a well controlled active skin can substantially modify sound reflectivity of the acoustical interface and reduce the propagation of acoustic waves.\n\nThe Research and Training Activities for the Joint Institute for Aeronautics and Acoustics\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCantwell, Brian\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThis proposal requests continued support for the program of activities to be undertaken by the Ames-Stanford Joint Institute for Aeronautics and Acoustics during the period 1 Oct. 1995 - 30 Sept. 1996. The emphasis in this program is on training and research in experimental and computational methods with application to aerodynamics, acoustics and the important interactions between them. The program comprises activities in active flow control, Large Eddy Simulation of jet noise, flap aerodynamics and acoustics and high lift modeling studies. During the proposed period there will be a continued emphasis on the interaction between NASA Ames, Stanford University and Industry, particularly in connection with the high lift activities.\n\nThe Impact of Model Uncertainty on Spatial Compensation in Active Structural Acoustic Control\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCabell, Randolph H.; Gibbs, Gary P.; Sprofera, Joseph D.; Clark, Robert L.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nTurbulent boundary layer (TBL) noise is considered a primary factor in the interior noise experienced by passengers aboard commercial airliners. There have been numerous investigations of interior noise control devoted to aircraft panels; however, practical realization is a challenge since the physical boundary conditions are uncertain at best. In most prior studies, pinned or clamped boundary conditions have been assumed; however, realistic panels likely display a range of varying boundary conditions between these two limits. Uncertainty in boundary conditions is a challenge for control system designers, both in terms of the compensator implemented and the location of actuators and sensors required to achieve the desired control. The impact of model uncertainties, uncertain boundary conditions in particular, on the selection of actuator and sensor locations for structural acoustic control are considered herein. Results from this research effort indicate that it is possible to optimize the design of actuator and sensor location and aperture, which minimizes the impact of boundary conditions on the desired structural acoustic control.\n\nMultifunctional and Context-Dependent Control of Vocal Acoustics by Individual Muscles\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSrivastava, Kyle H.; Elemans, Coen P.H.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe relationship between muscle activity and behavioral output determines how the brain controls and modifies complex skills. In vocal control, ensembles of muscles are used to precisely tune single acoustic parameters such as fundamental frequency and sound amplitude. If individual vocal muscles were dedicated to the control of single parameters, then the brain could control each parameter independently by modulating the appropriate muscle or muscles. Alternatively, if each muscle influenced multiple parameters, a more complex control strategy would be required to selectively modulate a single parameter. Additionally, it is unknown whether the function of single muscles is fixed or varies across different vocal gestures. A fixed relationship would allow the brain to use the same changes in muscle activation to, for example, increase the fundamental frequency of different vocal gestures, whereas a context-dependent scheme would require the brain to calculate different motor modifications in each case. We tested the hypothesis that single muscles control multiple acoustic parameters and that the function of single muscles varies across gestures using three complementary approaches. First, we recorded electromyographic data from vocal muscles in singing Bengalese finches. Second, we electrically perturbed the activity of single muscles during song. Third, we developed an ex vivo technique to analyze the biomechanical and acoustic consequences of single-muscle perturbations. We found that single muscles drive changes in multiple parameters and that the function of single muscles differs across vocal gestures, suggesting that the brain uses a complex, gesture-dependent control scheme to regulate vocal output.

Both single frequency and multi-frequency control of the blade passage frequency and its harmonics was accomplished. The control algorithm was a variant of the popular filtered-x LMS implemented in the principal component domain. The control system consisted of 21 inertial actuators and 32 microphones. The actuators were mounted to the aircraft's ring frames. The microphones were distributed uniformly throughout the interior at head height, both seated and standing. Actuator locations were selected using a combinatorial search optimization algorithm. The control system achieved a 14 dB noise reduction of the blade passage frequency during single frequency tests. Multi-frequency control of the first 1st, 2nd and 3rd harmonics resulted in 10.2 dB, 3.3 dB and 1.6 dB noise reductions respectively. These results fall short of the predictions which were produced by the optimization algorithm (13.5 dB, 8.6 dB and 6.3 dB). The optimization was based on actuator transfer functions taken on the ground and it is postulated that cabin pressurization at flight altitude was a factor in this discrepancy.\n\nAnalytical study of acoustic response of a semireverberant enclosure with application to active noise control\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParrott, T. L.; Schein, D. B.; Gridley, D.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThe acoustic response of a semireverberant enclosure with two interacting, velocity-prescribed source distributions was analyzed using standard modal analysis techniques with a view toward a better understanding of active noise control. Different source and enclosure dimensions, source separations, and single-wall admittances were studied over representative frequency bandwidths of 10 Hz with source relative phase as a parameter. Results indicate that power radiated into the enclosure agree qualitatively with the spatial average of the mean square pressure, even though the reverberant field is nondiffuse. Decreases in acoustic power can therefore be used to estimate global noise reduction in a nondiffuse semireverberant environment. As might be expected, parametric studies indicate that maximum power reductions of up to 25 dB can be achieved when secondary and primary sources are compact and closely spaced. Although less success is achieved with increasing frequency and source separation or size, significant suppression of up to 8 dB still occurs over the 1 to 2 Hz bandwidth.\n\nAcoustic (loudspeaker) facial EMG monitoring: II. Use of evoked EMG activity during acoustic neuroma resection.\n\nPubMed\n\nPrass, R L; Kinney, S E; Hardy, R W; Hahn, J F; LÃ¼ders, H\n\n1987-12-01\n\nFacial electromyographic (EMG) activity was continuously monitored via loudspeaker during eleven translabyrinthine and nine suboccipital consecutive unselected acoustic neuroma resections. Ipsilateral facial EMG activity was synchronously recorded on the audio channels of operative videotapes, which were retrospectively reviewed in order to allow detailed evaluation of the potential benefit of various acoustic EMG patterns in the performance of specific aspects of acoustic neuroma resection. The use of evoked facial EMG activity was classified and described. Direct local mechanical (surgical) stimulation and direct electrical stimulation were of benefit in the localization and/or delineation of the facial nerve contour. Burst and train acoustic patterns of EMG activity appeared to indicate surgical trauma to the facial nerve that would not have been appreciated otherwise. Early results of postoperative facial function of monitored patients are presented, and the possible value of burst and train acoustic EMG activity patterns in the intraoperative assessment of facial nerve function is discussed. Acoustic facial EMG monitoring appears to provide a potentially powerful surgical tool for delineation of the facial nerve contour, the ongoing use of which may lead to continued improvement in facial nerve function preservation through modification of dissection strategy.\n\nContributions of rapid neuromuscular transmission to the fine control of acoustic parameters of birdsong.\n\nPubMed\n\nMencio, Caitlin; Kuberan, Balagurunathan; Goller, Franz\n\n2017-02-01\n\nNeural control of complex vocal behaviors, such as birdsong and speech, requires integration of biomechanical nonlinearities through muscular output. Although control of airflow and tension of vibrating tissues are known functions of vocal muscles, it remains unclear how specific muscle characteristics contribute to specific acoustic parameters. To address this gap, we removed heparan sulfate chains using heparitinases to perturb neuromuscular transmission subtly in the syrinx of adult male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Infusion of heparitinases into ventral syringeal muscles altered their excitation threshold and reduced neuromuscular transmission changing their ability to modulate airflow. The changes in muscle activation dynamics caused a reduction in frequency modulation rates and elimination of many high-frequency syllables but did not alter the fundamental frequency of syllables. Sound amplitude was reduced and sound onset pressure was increased, suggesting a role of muscles in the induction of self-sustained oscillations under low-airflow conditions, thus enhancing vocal efficiency. These changes were reversed to preinfusion levels by 7 days after infusion. These results illustrate complex interactions between the control of airflow and tension and further define the importance of syringeal muscle in the control of a variety of acoustic song characteristics. In summary, the findings reported here show that altering neuromuscular transmission can lead to reversible changes to the acoustic structure of song. Understanding the full extent of muscle involvement in song production is critical in decoding the motor program for the production of complex vocal behavior, including our search for parallels between birdsong and human speech motor control. It is largely unknown how fine motor control of acoustic parameters is achieved in vocal organs. Subtle manipulation of syringeal muscle function was used to test how active motor control influences acoustic\n\nSurface acoustic waves voltage controlled directional coupler\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGolan, G.; Griffel, G.; Yanilov, E.; Ruschin, S.; Seidman, A.; Croitoru, N.\n\n1988-10-01\n\nAn important condition for the development of surface wave integrated-acoustic devices is the ability to guide and control the propagation of the acoustic energy. This can be implemented by deposition of metallic \"loading\" channels on an anisotropic piezoelectric substrate. Deposition of such two parallel channels causes an effective coupling of acoustic energy from one channel to the other. A basic requirement for this coupling effect is the existence of the two basic modes: a symmetrical and a nonsymmetrical one. A mode map that shows the number of sustained modes as a function of the device parameters (i.e., channel width; distance between channels; material velocity; and acoustical exciting frequency) is presented. This kind of map can help significantly in the design process of such a device. In this paper we devise an advanced acoustical \"Y\" coupler with the ability to control its effective coupling by an externally applied voltage, thereby causing modulation of the output intensities of the signals.\n\nSystem for controlled acoustic rotation of objects\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBarmatz, M. B. (Inventor)\n\n1983-01-01\n\nA system is described for use with acoustically levitated objects, which enables close control of rotation of the object. One system includes transducers that propagate acoustic waves along the three dimensions (X, Y, Z) of a chamber of rectangular cross section. Each transducers generates one wave which is resonant to a corresponding chamber dimension to acoustically levitate an object, and additional higher frequency resonant wavelengths for controlling rotation of the object. The three chamber dimensions and the corresponding three levitation modes (resonant wavelengths) are all different, to avoid degeneracy, or interference, of waves with one another, that could have an effect on object rotation. Only the higher frequencies, with pairs of them having the same wavelength, are utilized to control rotation, so that rotation is controlled independently of levitation and about any arbitrarily chosen axis.\n\nActive Structural Acoustic Control in an Original A400M Aircraft Structure\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKoehne, C.; Sachau, D.; Renger, K.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nLow frequency noise has always been a challenge in propeller driven aircraft. At low frequencies passive noise treatments are not as efficient as active noise reduction systems. The Helmut-Schmidt-University has built up a full-scale test rig with an original A400M aircraft structure. This provides a good opportunity to develop and test active noise reduction systems in a realistic environment. The currently installed system consists of mechanical actuators and acoustical sensors. The actuators are called TVAs (Tuneable Vibration Absorber) and contain two spring-mass systems whose natural frequencies are adjusted to the BPFs (Blade Passage Frequency) of the propellers. The TVAs are mounted to the frames and the force direction is normal to the skin. The sensors are condenser microphones which are attached to the primary structure of the airframe. The TVAs are equipped with signal processing devices. These components carry out Fourier transforms and signal amplification for the sensor data and actuator signals. The communication between the TVAs and the central control unit is implemented by the CAN Bus protocol and mainly consists of complex coefficients for the sensor and actuator data. This paper describes the basic structure of the system, the hardware set-up and function tests of the controller.\n\nSorting drops and cells with acoustics: acoustic microfluidic fluorescence-activated cell sorter.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchmid, Lothar; Weitz, David A; Franke, Thomas\n\n2014-10-07\n\nWe describe a versatile microfluidic fluorescence-activated cell sorter that uses acoustic actuation to sort cells or drops at ultra-high rates. Our acoustic sorter combines the advantages of traditional fluorescence-activated cell (FACS) and droplet sorting (FADS) and is applicable for a multitude of objects. We sort aqueous droplets, at rates as high as several kHz, into two or even more outlet channels. We can also sort cells directly from the medium without prior encapsulation into drops; we demonstrate this by sorting fluorescently labeled mouse melanoma cells in a single phase fluid. Our acoustic microfluidic FACS is compatible with standard cell sorting cytometers, yet, at the same time, enables a rich variety of more sophisticated applications.\n\nActive micromixer using surface acoustic wave streaming\n\nDOEpatents\n\nBranch,; Darren W. , Meyer; Grant D. , Craighead; Harold, G [Ithaca, NY\n\n2011-05-17\n\nAn active micromixer uses a surface acoustic wave, preferably a Rayleigh wave, propagating on a piezoelectric substrate to induce acoustic streaming in a fluid in a microfluidic channel. The surface acoustic wave can be generated by applying an RF excitation signal to at least one interdigital transducer on the piezoelectric substrate. The active micromixer can rapidly mix quiescent fluids or laminar streams in low Reynolds number flows. The active micromixer has no moving parts (other than the SAW transducer) and is, therefore, more reliable, less damaging to sensitive fluids, and less susceptible to fouling and channel clogging than other types of active and passive micromixers. The active micromixer is adaptable to a wide range of geometries, can be easily fabricated, and can be integrated in a microfluidic system, reducing dead volume. Finally, the active micromixer has on-demand on/off mixing capability and can be operated at low power.\n\nActive Hearing Mechanisms Inspire Adaptive Amplification in an Acoustic Sensor System.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuerreiro, Jose; Reid, Andrew; Jackson, Joseph C; Windmill, James F C\n\n2018-06-01\n\nOver many millions of years of evolution, nature has developed some of the most adaptable sensors and sensory systems possible, capable of sensing, conditioning and processing signals in a very power- and size-effective manner. By looking into biological sensors and systems as a source of inspiration, this paper presents the study of a bioinspired concept of signal processing at the sensor level. By exploiting a feedback control mechanism between a front-end acoustic receiver and back-end neuronal based computation, a nonlinear amplification with hysteretic behavior is created. Moreover, the transient response of the front-end acoustic receiver can also be controlled and enhanced. A theoretical model is proposed and the concept is prototyped experimentally through an embedded system setup that can provide dynamic adaptations of a sensory system comprising a MEMS microphone placed in a closed-loop feedback system. It faithfully mimics the mosquito's active hearing response as a function of the input sound intensity. This is an adaptive acoustic sensor system concept that can be exploited by sensor and system designers within acoustics and ultrasonic engineering fields.\n\nControllable Solid Propulsion Combustion and Acoustic Knowledge Base Improvements\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMcCauley, Rachel; Fischbach, Sean; Fredrick, Robert\n\n2012-01-01\n\nControllable solid propulsion systems have distinctive combustion and acoustic environments that require enhanced testing and analysis techniques to progress this new technology from development to production. In a hot gas valve actuating system, the movement of the pintle through the hot gas exhibits complex acoustic disturbances and flow characteristics that can amplify induced pressure loads that can damage or detonate the rocket motor. The geometry of a controllable solid propulsion gas chamber can set up unique unsteady flow which can feed acoustic oscillations patterns that require characterization. Research in this area aids in the understanding of how best to design, test, and analyze future controllable solid rocket motors using the lessons learned from past government programs as well as university research and testing. This survey paper will give the reader a better understanding of the potentially amplifying affects propagated by a controllable solid rocket motor system and the knowledge of the tools current available to address these acoustic disturbances in a preliminary design. Finally the paper will supply lessons learned from past experiences which will allow the reader to come away with understanding of what steps need to be taken when developing a controllable solid rocket propulsion system.

The acoustic emissions from the medium correlated with surface boiling is used to generate a feedback control signal proportional to the level of boiling of the medium. This signal is applied to a power controller to automatically and continuoulsly vary the power applied to the oven to control the boiling at a selected level.\n\nFrequency-independent radiation modes of interior sound radiation: Experimental study and global active control\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHesse, C.; Papantoni, V.; Algermissen, S.; Monner, H. P.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nActive control of structural sound radiation is a promising technique to overcome the poor passive acoustic isolation performance of lightweight structures in the low-frequency region. Active structural acoustic control commonly aims at the suppression of the far-field radiated sound power. This paper is concerned with the active control of sound radiation into acoustic enclosures. Experimental results of a coupled rectangular plate-fluid system under stochastic excitation are presented. The amplitudes of the frequency-independent interior radiation modes are determined in real-time using a set of structural vibration sensors, for the purpose of estimating their contribution to the acoustic potential energy in the enclosure. This approach is validated by acoustic measurements inside the cavity. Utilizing a feedback control approach, a broadband reduction of the global acoustic response inside the enclosure is achieved.\n\nActive control of reheat buzz\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDowling, A. P.; Hooper, N.; Langhorne, P. J.; Bloxsidge, G. J.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nReheat buzz is a low-frequency combustion instability involving the propagation of longitudinal pressure waves inside a duct in which a flame is anchored. Active control has been successfully applied to this instability. The controller alters the upstream acoustic boundary condition and thereby changes the energy balance in duct. Control is found to reduce the peak in the pressure spectrum due to the combustion instability by 20 dB. The acoustic energy in the whole 0-800-Hz bandwidth is reduced to about 10 percent of its uncontrolled value. A comparison with numerical calculations is presented.\n\nStructural acoustic control of plates with variable boundary conditions: design methodology.\n\nPubMed\n\nSprofera, Joseph D; Cabell, Randolph H; Gibbs, Gary P; Clark, Robert L\n\n2007-07-01\n\nA method for optimizing a structural acoustic control system subject to variations in plate boundary conditions is provided. The assumed modes method is used to build a plate model with varying levels of rotational boundary stiffness to simulate the dynamics of a plate with uncertain edge conditions. A transducer placement scoring process, involving Hankel singular values, is combined with a genetic optimization routine to find spatial locations robust to boundary condition variation. Predicted frequency response characteristics are examined, and theoretically optimized results are discussed in relation to the range of boundary conditions investigated. Modeled results indicate that it is possible to minimize the impact of uncertain boundary conditions in active structural acoustic control by optimizing the placement of transducers with respect to those uncertainties.\n\nAcoustic activation of water-in-oil microemulsions for controlled salt dissolution.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaxamusa, Salmaan; Ehrmann, Paul; Ong, Jemi\n\n2018-06-18\n\nThe dynamic nature of the oil-water interface allows for sequestration of material within the dispersed domains of a microemulsion. Microstructural changes should therefore change the dissolution rate of a solid surface in a microemulsion. We hypothesize that microstructural changes due to formulation and cavitation in an acoustic field will enable control over solid dissolution rates. Water-in-oil microemulsions were formulated using cyclohexane, water, Triton X-100, and hexanol. The microstructure and solvation properties of Winsor Type IV formulations were characterized. Dissolution rates of KH 2 PO 4 (KDP), were measured. A kinetic analysis isolated the effect of the microstructure, and rate enhancements due to cavitation effects on the microstructure were characterized by measuring dissolution rates in an ultrasonic field. Dispersed aqueous domains of 2-6â¯nm radius dissolve a solid block of KDP at 0-10â¯nm/min. Dissolution rate is governed not by the domain-surface collision frequency but rather by a dissolution probability per domain-surface encounter. Higher probabilities are correlated with larger domains. Rapid and reversible dissolution rate increases of up to 270Ã were observed under ultrasonic conditions, with <20% of the increase due to bulk heating effects. The rest is attributed to cavitation-induced changes to the domain microstructure, providing a simple method for remotely activating and de-activating dissolution. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Acoustic disturbances, such as those caused by the pressure recovery system of the high power laser, are a significant jitter source. Several technologies may be appropriate for reducing the acoustically induced jitter. The first choice for mitigation will be passive approaches, such as acoustic blankets. There is, however, some uncertainty whether these approaches will provide sufficient attenuation and there is concern about the weight of these approaches. A testbed that captured the fundamental physics of the ABL acoustically induced optical jitter problem was developed. This testbed consists of a flexure-mounted mirror exposed to an acoustic field that is generated outside a beam tube and then propagates within the tube. Both feedback and adaptive feedforward control topologies were implemented on the testbed using either of two actuators (a fast steering mirror and a secondary acoustic speaker located near the precision mirror), and a variety of sensors (microphones measuring the acoustic disturbance, accelerometers and microphones mounted on the precision optic, and an optical position sensing detector). This paper summarizes the results from these control topologies for reducing the acoustically induced jitter with some control topologies achieving in excess of 40 dB jitter reduction at a single frequency. This work was performed under an SBIR Phase I funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate.\n\nActive Control Of Structure-Borne Noise\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nElliott, S. J.\n\n1994-11-01\n\nThe successful practical application of active noise control requires an understanding of both its acoustic limitations and the limitations of the electrical control strategy used. This paper is concerned with the active control of sound in enclosures. First, a review is presented of the fundamental physical limitations of using loudspeakers to achieve either global or local control. Both approaches are seen to have a high frequency limit, due to either the acoustic modal overlap, or the spatial correlation function of the pressure field. These physical performance limits could, in principle, be achieved with either a feedback or a feedforward control strategy. These strategies are reviewed and the use of adaptive digital filters is discussed for both approaches. The application of adaptive feedforward control in the control of engine and road noise in cars is described. Finally, an indirect approach to the active control of sound is discussed, in which the vibration is suppressed in the structural paths connecting the source of vibration to the enclosure. Two specific examples of this strategy are described, using an active automotive engine mount and the incorporation of actuators into helicopter struts to control gear-meshing tones. In both cases good passive design can minimize the complexity of the active controller.\n\nIonospheric acoustic and gravity wave activity above low-latitude thunderstorms\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLay, Erin Hoffmann\n\nIn this report, we study the correlation between thunderstorm activity and ionospheric gravity and acoustic waves in the low-latitude ionosphere. We use ionospheric total electron content (TEC) measurements from the Low Latitude Ionospheric Sensor Network (LISN) and lightning measurements from the World- Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). We find that ionospheric acoustic waves show a strong diurnal pattern in summer, peaking in the pre-midnight time period. However, the peak magnitude does not correspond to thunderstorm area, and the peak time is significantly after the peak in thunderstorm activity. Wintertime acoustic wave activity has no discernable pattern in these data. ThemoreÂ Â» coverage area of ionospheric gravity waves in the summer was found to increase with increasing thunderstorm activity. Wintertime gravity wave activity has an observable diurnal pattern unrelated to thunderstorm activity. These findings show that while thunderstorms are not the only, or dominant source of ionospheric perturbations at low-latitudes, they do have an observable effect on gravity wave activity and could be influential in acoustic wave activity.Â«Â less\n\nEcological Insights from Pelagic Habitats Acquired Using Active Acoustic Techniques.\n\nPubMed\n\nBenoit-Bird, Kelly J; Lawson, Gareth L\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMarine pelagic ecosystems present fascinating opportunities for ecological investigation but pose important methodological challenges for sampling. Active acoustic techniques involve producing sound and receiving signals from organisms and other water column sources, offering the benefit of high spatial and temporal resolution and, via integration into different platforms, the ability to make measurements spanning a range of spatial and temporal scales. As a consequence, a variety of questions concerning the ecology of pelagic systems lend themselves to active acoustics, ranging from organism-level investigations and physiological responses to the environment to ecosystem-level studies and climate. As technologies and data analysis methods have matured, the use of acoustics in ecological studies has grown rapidly. We explore the continued role of active acoustics in addressing questions concerning life in the ocean, highlight creative applications to key ecological themes ranging from physiology and behavior to biogeography and climate, and discuss emerging avenues where acoustics can help determine how pelagic ecosystems function.\n\nTransducer placement for robustness to variations in boundary conditions for active structural acoustic control\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSprofera, Joseph D.; Clark, Robert L.; Cabell, Randolph H.; Gibbs, Gary P.\n\n2005-05-01\n\nTurbulent boundary layer (TBL) noise is considered a primary contribution to the interior noise present in commercial airliners. There are numerous investigations of interior noise control devoted to aircraft panels; however, practical realization is a potential challenge since physical boundary conditions are uncertain at best. In most prior studies, pinned or clamped boundary conditions were assumed; however, realistic panels likely display a range of boundary conditions between these two limits. Uncertainty in boundary conditions is a challenge for control system designers, both in terms of the compensator implemented and the location of transducers required to achieve the desired control. The impact of model uncertainties, specifically uncertain boundaries, on the selection of transducer locations for structural acoustic control is considered herein. The final goal of this work is the design of an aircraft panel structure that can reduce TBL noise transmission through the use of a completely adaptive, single-input, single-output control system. The feasibility of this goal is demonstrated through the creation of a detailed analytical solution, followed by the implementation of a test model in a transmission loss apparatus. Successfully realizing a control system robust to variations in boundary conditions can lead to the design and implementation of practical adaptive structures that could be used to control the transmission of sound to the interior of aircraft. Results from this research effort indicate it is possible to optimize the design of actuator and sensor location and aperture, minimizing the impact of boundary conditions on the desired structural acoustic control.\n\nAcoustic fatigue: Overview of activities at NASA Langley\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMixson, John S.; Roussos, Louis A.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nA number of aircraft and spacecraft configurations are being considered for future development. These include high-speed turboprop aircraft, advanced vertical take-off and landing fighter aircraft, and aerospace planes for hypersonic intercontinental cruise or flight to orbit and return. Review of the acoustic environment expected for these vehicles indicates levels high enough that acoustic fatigue must be considered. Unfortunately, the sonic fatique design technology used for current aircraft may not be adequate for these future vehicles. This has resulted in renewed emphasis on acoustic fatigue research at the NASA Langley Research Center. The overall objective of the Langley program is to develop methods and information for design of aerospace vehicles that will resist acoustic fatigue. The program includes definition of the acoustic loads acting on structures due to exhaust jets of boundary layers, and subsequent determination of the stresses within the structure due to these acoustic loads. Material fatigue associated with the high frequency structural stress reversal patterns resulting from acoustic loadings is considered to be an area requiring study, but no activity is currently underway.\n\nControlled sample orientation and rotation in an acoustic levitator\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBarmatz, Martin B. (Inventor); Gaspar, Mark S. (Inventor); Trinh, Eugene H. (Inventor)\n\n1988-01-01\n\nA system is described for use with acoustic levitators, which can prevent rotation of a levitated object or control its orientation and/or rotation. The acoustic field is made nonsymmetrical about the axis of the levitator, to produce an orienting torque that resists sample rotation. In one system, a perturbating reflector is located on one side of the axis of the levitator, at a location near the levitated object. In another system, the main reflector surface towards which incoming acoustic waves are directed is nonsymmetrically curved about the axis of the levitator. The levitated object can be reoriented or rotated in a controlled manner by repositioning the reflector producing the nonsymmetry.\n\nA digital control system for high level acoustic noise generation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLee, John P.; Bosco, Jerry H.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nAs part of the modernization of the Acoustic Test Facility at Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, Sunnyvale, a digital acoustic control system was designed and built. The requirements imposed by Lockheed on the control system and the degree to which those requirements were met are discussed. Acceptance test results as well as some of the features of the digital control system not found in traditional manual control systems are discussed.\n\nClosed-Loop Acoustic Control of Reverberant Room for Satellite Environmental Testing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJanssens, Karl; Bianciardi, Fabio; Sabbatini, Danilo; Debille, Jan; Carrella, Alex\n\n2012-07-01\n\nThe full satellite acoustic test is an important milestone in a satellite launch survivability verification campaign. This test is required to verify the satelliteâs mechanical design against the high-level acoustic loads induced by the launch vehicle during the atmospheric flight. During the test, the satellite is subjected to a broadband diffuse acoustic field, reproducing the pressure levels observed during launch. The excitation is in most cases provided by a combination of horns for the low frequencies and noise generators for the higher frequencies. Acoustic control tests are commonly performed in reverberant rooms, controlling the sound pressure levels in third octave bands over the specified target spectrum. This paper discusses an automatic feedback control system for acoustic control of large reverberation rooms for satellite environmental testing. The acoustic control system consists of parallel third octave PI (Proportional Integral) feedback controllers that take the reverberation characteristics of the room into consideration. The drive output of the control system is shaped at every control step based on the comparison of the average third octave noise spectrum, measured from a number of microphones in the test room, with the target spectrum. Cross-over filters split the output drive into band- limited signals to feed each of the horns. The control system is realized in several steps. In the first phase, a dynamic process model is developed, including the non-linear characteristics of the horns and the reverberant properties of the room. The model is identified from dynamic experiments using system identification techniques. In the next phase, an adequate control strategy is designed which is capable of reaching the target spectrum in the required time period without overshoots. This control strategy is obtained from model-in-the-loop (MIL) simulations, evaluating the performance of various potential strategies. Finally, the proposed strategy is\n\nExtinction cross-section suppression and active acoustic invisibility cloaking\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMitri, F. G.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nInvisibility in its canonical form requires rendering a zero extinction cross-section (or energy efficiency) from an active or a passive object. This work demonstrates the successful theoretical realization of this physical effect for an active cylindrically radiating acoustic body, undergoing periodic axisymmetric harmonic vibrations near a flat rigid boundary. Radiating, amplification and extinction cross-sections of the active source are defined. Assuming monopole and dipole modal oscillations of the circular source, conditions are found where the extinction energy efficiency factor of the active source vanishes, achieving total invisibility with minimal influence of the source size. It also takes positive or negative values, depending on its size and distance from the boundary. Moreover, the amplification energy efficiency factor is negative for the acoustically-active source. These effects also occur for higher-order modal oscillations of the active source. The results find potential applications in the development of acoustic cloaking devices and invisibility.\n\nApproximation methods for control of acoustic/structure models with piezoceramic actuators\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBanks, H. T.; Fang, W.; Silcox, R. J.; Smith, R. C.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe active control of acoustic pressure in a 2-D cavity with a flexible boundary (a beam) is considered. Specifically, this control is implemented via piezoceramic patches on the beam which produces pure bending moments. The incorporation of the feedback control in this manner leads to a system with an unbounded input term. Approximation methods in this manner leads to a system with an unbounded input term. Approximation methods in the context of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) state space control formulation are discussed and numerical results demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in computing feedback controls for noise reduction are presented.\n\nDetecting Human Activity Using Acoustic, Seismic, Accelerometer, Video, and E-field Sensors\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2011-09-01\n\nDetecting Human Activity using Acoustic, Seismic, Accelerometer, Video, and E-field Sensors by Sarah H.

Here, we addressed this question by studying echolocating bats, animals that have the ability to point their biosonar beam to a confined region of space. We trained Egyptian fruit bats to land on a target, under conditions of varying levels of environmental complexity, and measured their echolocation and flight behavior. The bats modulated the intensity of their biosonar emissions, and the spatial region they sampled, in a task-dependant manner. We report here that Egyptian fruit bats selectively change the emission intensity and the angle between the beam axes of sequentially emitted clicks, according to the distance to the target, and depending on the level of environmental complexity. In so doing, they effectively adjusted the spatial sector sampled by a pair of clicksâthe âfield-of-view.â We suggest that the exact point within the beam that is directed towards an object (e.g., the beam's peak, maximal slope, etc.) is influenced by three competing task demands: detection, localization, and angular scanningâwhere the third factor is modulated by field-of-view. Our results suggest that lingual echolocation (based on tongue clicks) is in fact much more sophisticated than previously believed. They also reveal a new parameter under active control in animal sonarâthe angle between consecutive beams. Our findings suggest that acoustic scanning of space by mammals is highly flexible and modulated much more selectively than previously recognized.
