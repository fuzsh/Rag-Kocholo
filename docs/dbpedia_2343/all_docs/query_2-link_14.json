His total score was 56 plus 6 shared. You probably\n\nwant to read \"Attack of the Airacobras\", by Dimitri Loza, translated into\n\nEnglish and published by the University Press of Kansas.\n\n> Seems some aircraft do well in some theaters and terrible in others, for a\n\n> vareity of reasons.

Later they specifically\n\nrequested that we send no more P-40s, but send them as many P-39s as we could.\n\nIn July 1943 Stalin asked for 500/month; considering that production peaked in\n\nApril 1943 with 511 P-39s delivered, he was essentially asking for the entire\n\nproduction.\n\n> It also did well for the AVG, for the US 325 fighter group, and for many\n\n> though not all of the Commonwealth squadrons in North Africa (the South\n\n> Africans did poorly) It also did well for the New Zealanders in the Pacific.\n\n>\n\n> In every aircraft book, the P-40 is always described in nearly identical\n\n> cliche language, as 'unmaneverable, but rugged'.

Most fighters get shot down in the first pass by the\n\nenemy they don't see; speed and acceleration, at least in a guns-only era, was\n\nfar more important. It's fantastic roll capability allowed it to track for long\n\nenough to take a shot, and then evade until out of gun range. Turning was a\n\ndefensive move, and something that you don't want to do in the middle of a big\n\nfurball. The FW-190A was the supreme energy fighter in the world for a year or\n\ntwo.\n\nThe other thing that Sims don't show is the control feel of the a/c; every pilot\n\nI've ever read who's flown the FW-190 comments on the superb control harmony,\n\ni.e. the way the three controls worked together.\n\nGuy\n\nThe nude on the screen at least can't take all of your money...\n\nFlight sims are great fun, but they tend to view an aircraft in a micro\n\nworld, where you get to set up certain comfort zone to replaced 6 months\n\nto a year of training in the real thing and you also get to set up such\n\nthings as unlimited ammo, the ability of your opposition and the like,\n\nobviously, you don't want to participate in several hours of boring\n\nflying and then a 1-2 minute engagement on a sim when in real life 2\n\nminutes or less of sheer terror is more than enough. A lot of\n\ncharacteristics of flying are in the Sim, which is really cool, but it\n\nain't real.\n\nI think the P-40 might be a good sim aircraft and give an operator a lot\n\nof confidence. No one ever said it wasn't stable and as such it was a\n\ngood gun platform. And some of the characteristics that historians\n\ncomment didn't really show up in combat scenarios that often.\n\nTo some extent, its unfortunate that a lot of young people will learn\n\ntheir history on the Sim rather than research, but then again, at least\n\nthey will be learning \"Semi-reality\" rather than all the fantasy crap\n\nthat has NO comparison to reality.\n\nIn reality the P-40 was an aircraft that was designed to be highly\n\nmanuverable but with much less weight (P-36). The addition of the\n\nAllison powerplant, while giving the P-40 a smaller front plate and\n\ntherefore more \"usable\" hp, but without an increase in wing area that\n\nalso had to contend with the additional weight of needed armor and\n\nself-sealing tankage, turned that thoroughbred handling of the P-36, its\n\none great asset, to a plug, i.e. it could still fly OK, but combat\n\nmanuverability was considerably lessened, but no so much as other prewar\n\ndesigns that did not have the surplus wing area that the P-36 had to\n\ngive.\n\nIn favor of the P-40 was its ability to still carry the weight stably\n\nwhile it had a classic engine in terms of reliability, except that it\n\nhad to keep to lower altitudes. This made the P-40 an effective low\n\nlevel fighter and strafer and interceptor against marginal performance\n\nbombing aircraft. It was a durable airplane, surprizing so, and it may\n\nhave been a happy fact that the 40's\n\nradiator was located where it was and not further to the rear where,\n\nalthough there might have been more favorable placement in terms of\n\naerodynamics, at least it put the most vulnerable part of the plane up\n\nfront and in a small package, so that lighter mgs had difficultly\n\nreaching those area in stern attacks.\n\nThe P-40 also had a very solid punch. The six 50 cal mgs of the E and\n\nother variants, even 4, were more than adequate against the relatively\n\nlighter aircraft they engaged.\n\nMe-109's were effective against the P-40's, but part of the reason the\n\nP-40's kept soldiering on was that even the 109 had to fly in the P-40's\n\nenvelope so the superiority of the 109F, the best 109 to take on the\n\nP-40, was not totally overwhelming....and P-40's continued to chew up\n\nJu-52's and most other aircraft in the Luftwaffe inventory.\n\nNot a great fighter but an adequate fighter as long as you didn't\n\nstretch the envelope too far....sims don't do that.

You\n\n> don't get aces with over 60 kills against the Luftwaffe by accident.\n\n(snipped for brevity)\n\nThe P-39 and P-40 are very interesting aircraft from an historical point\n\nof view. U.S. historians have a number of reasons for \"underrating\"\n\nthese planes. Wartime propaganda blamed the aircraft for Allied defeats\n\nearly in the war. Some historians (unfortunately) repeat that story as\n\n\"the truth.\" Also, the \"doctrine\" of high-altitude bombing was very\n\nwidely accepted, and this *required* turbo-supercharged aircraft (as\n\nothers have pointed out in this thread) and the P-39 and P-40 lacked\n\nturbo-superchargers.\n\nBut the most interesting aspect of all this to me is the doctrine of the\n\nU.S. Army and Navy -- the unspoken assumption that \"everybody comes\n\nback\" from a mission. This meant that high speed was the most desired\n\ncharacteristic of a fighter plane, since that meant that when\n\noutnumbered or at a disadvantage, our guys could just out-run the\n\nopposition. The P-40 and P-39 did not always have a clear speed\n\nadvantage, so they were quickly replaced with newer (or just faster)\n\ndesigns.\n\nIt's interesting to me is that this is something that you can learn from\n\na sim (like IL-2) but you have to make survival the *number one*\n\npriority in order to learn it. In any sim, a slow plane will get you\n\nkilled if things get \"hairy.\" In reality, \"getting killed\" means being\n\nstill and cold forever and ever. Americans really try to avoid that\n\nsort of thing (see Gen. Patton's speech at the start of the movie \"Patton.\")\n\nUnfortunately, civilians just don't understand. There is going to be a\n\nlittle \"taint\" associated with the idea of \"running away\" (an RAF\n\nofficer told Chenault that any British pilot who followed Chenault's\n\nadvice to \"boom and zoom\" should be \"court martialed for cowardice.\")\n\nSo, for many years, the P-39 and P-40 have had to do their duty, and\n\nsacrifice their reputations for the common good and to uphold the image\n\nof the genuinely brave flyers who traded them in for faster mounts.\n\nOn the other hand, the Soviets had a different view on the whole \"coming\n\nback alive\" thing. \"With your shield or on it\" kind of sums it up, I\n\nthink. All in all, the attitude of the U.S. forces ultimately proved to\n\nbe a superior strategy.\n\nold hoodoo wrote:\n\n<snip>\n\n> Oddly, the I-16's, which I thought would be very handy, look for\n\n> an excuse to fall out of the sky, turn steeply, fire your guns, they\n\n> want to stop flying, unstable as heck.

Here's Eric Brown on flying theI-16:\n\n\"Cruising at225 mph, the Rata had marginal longitudinal but neutral lateral\n\nand directional stability. The controls were all sensitive, and its\n\nfeatherlight ailerons gave a high rate of roll . . . Top speed was 283 mph at\n\n10,000 ft, but accelearation was surprisingly poor in the dive, whenthe nose\n\nshowed a tendency to rise and a rigidly mounted engine caused the airplane to\n\nshake and rattle through the whole flight envelope. This made the Rata a poor\n\ngun platform.\"\n\n> The P-39's have been delights to fly except that when I loose\n\n> concentration and get too caught up in trying to pull it through and\n\n> take deflection--spins come at the worse times, and it takes quite a bit\n\n> of altitude to get out of the spins which I normally can do but some\n\n> times I give up trying and bail.

From Dean:\n\n\"One pilot said 'the P-39 would do the most wicked stall of any airplane I\n\never saw. That is why there were so many stall-spin accidents'. Another\n\nnoted 'Its controls were extremely delicate. The slightest hint of abruptness\n\non the pilot's part would instigate a high-speed stall; result, a snap roll'.\n\nThe P-39 at one g stall mushed considerably, and had a simultaneous mild roll\n\nand downward pitch; it would then return to level flight, and a pitching\n\nmotion would start as the stall progressed. In high speed stalls this\n\npitching would be accompanied by yawing and rolling motions. Stall recovery\n\ncould be made promptly using down elevator; ailerons were ineffective, and\n\nusing the rudder only increased oscillatory motions, as would use of up\n\nelevator. If the pilot did not get out of the stall, a spin which quickly\n\nflattened out would result, particularly if the center of gravity was aft. A\n\nwartime pilot in training related 'we bounced some P-39s. One of them stalled\n\nin a tight turn and went into a flat spin. We received orders not to attack\n\nP-39s as they were susceptible to flat spins after they had expended their\n\nammunition' . . . .\n\n\"Other comments denoted pilot's concerns 'It had a pronounced stalling\n\ntendency in steep turns; a pilot entering a tight turn never knew whether he\n\nwould make it around or get into a high-speed stall. Notoriously tricky in\n\nthe hands of a careless operator', and 'It was very important to keep the nose\n\ndown in recovering from a stall or spin. If the nose was brought up too\n\nquickly in recovering from a normal stall or spin, the P-39 could go into a\n\nflat spin.\"\n\nGuy\n\nWhat a terrifying job, being a gunner, especially in a single engined\n\nbomber.\n\nOne can see why the pilots liked armored glass on the windscreen and why\n\nit was probably considered very important, armored glass would give the\n\npilot a lot more confidence while boring in.\n\nOf course, after sitting in the back seat of a sim Il-2 and Stuka, its\n\nnot that easy to hit a target, especially with that pilot doing all\n\nsorts of aerobatics and the wings and or nose of the fighter attacking\n\nyou lighting up and you know you are unprotected.

Did everyone use it?\n\nIt wasn't a lead computing sight - what it did, if it was set up\n\nfoght, was counter the effect of the deflection of the gun from the\n\neffect of being oriented in the direction of the bomber's motion - a\n\nsort of \"Double-Whammy\" for computing lead, since it changes as you\n\nmove the gun to track the target. It varies according to speed adn\n\ndeflection. If you're careful, you can design a spring that will give\n\na resistence that matches the compnent of the airflow of the airplane's\n\nown motion and pretty uch cancel it out - for a single altitide, since\n\nit's measuring IAS rather than TAS. I suppose that if you're careful\n\nabout what altitude you choose for the spring to be based on, it'll\n\ngive a \"close enough\" answer for the range of altitudes you usually\n\nfly. (A system that can adjust the spring tension for an on-the-fly IAS\n\n->TAS calculation is possible, I suppose, but it's kinda tough to put\n\nthat into the front sight of a .30 cal machine gun.)\n\nGiven the effects of jump. mount vibration, and, in general, the\n\ndispersion that you get from a handheld gun (Something on teh order of\n\n20 mils, IIRC), I suspect that the \"Good enough\" range was pretty\n\nwide.\n\nIt'a a simple solution to the problem. Many nations used it. (The\n\nItalias put a lot of effort into making manually operated guns easier\n\nto use. For example, their manual turrets had a dummy gun barrel that\n\nstuck out into the airstream 180 degrees from the gun itself,and which\n\nelevated and depressed with the gun in order to counteract teh\n\nslipstream force on the gunbarel, adn make the gunner's job easier.\n\nThe Brits, Germans, and U.S, had systems of cams & levers that biased\n\nthe rear sight (Necessary with reflector sights and powered turets) to\n\nacheive the same effect. IIRC, these usually did have some form of\n\nIAS->TAS compensation. The ultimate expression was, of course, the GE\n\nCentral Fire Control System used on the B-29. This system used IAS,\n\naltitude, air temperature, target speed, range, azimuth, elevation,\n\nrange rate, bearing change, aand parrelax of the sight to the\n\ncomputer, and the computer to the gun turret to develop a firing\n\nsolution. If it was working correctly, the Gunner/Scanner just had to\n\nhold the sight's range ring on target, keep the target spanned for\n\nthe rangefinder. and hold down the action button when he had a good\n\ntrack. The computer did the rest. (When it didn't work, though...)\n\n>\n\n>>To be a gunner in a SE bomber I think you needed a certain lack of\n\n>>imagination and a very calm disposition...when you think of all the bad\n\n>>things that could happen to you over which you had no control, it didn't\n\n>>pay to think about it too much.\n\n>\n\n> I was pretty impressed to look in the Grumman Avenger.

I highly reccomend Il2, or if\n\nyou dont want to spend money, the 2.77 version of Warbirds is still\n\navailable for download, and the offline mode is quite challenging and fairly\n\nrealistic (miles ahead of 1942: PAW)\n\n> Speed is life.\n\nTrue, but that can be oversimplified. Again, if this was all there was to\n\nit, the MiG3 would have been a world beater in 1941...\n\nAs for this margin you are talking about, I know what you mean, but I think\n\nit did exist actally, at least at lower altitudes, (*below 16,000 ft)\n\nparticularly for the P-39. The P-39 was around 380 mph, the early Zero\n\n(a6m2) was about 320 mph, and the Ki-43 about 300 ... thats a big\n\ndifference. Even the P 40 at 360 mph was a whole lot faster, and that is\n\nnot even considering both dive speed and performance in a dive. The P-40\n\nactually handled better at high speed, while the A6M practically locked up\n\nnear 400 mph...\n\n> I would like to know one thing.

Have you found the\n\n> answer to this riddle?\n\nWell, I think you are on to one important aspect of a lot of historical\n\ndistortions, the British write most of the English language WW II history,\n\nand their perspective on things, their blind spots, sometimes their agenda,\n\nis reflected in this writing. They hated the P-39 as much or more than they\n\nhated the P-38, even while they initally loved such stellar gems aas the\n\nDefiant, the Fulmar, the Buffalo, etc. etc. I think their evaluation\n\nsystem was badly flawed to say the least.\n\nSo once they declared a fighter substandard, it took a lot for them to\n\nchange their mind (like Richard Bongs record with the P-38, for example)\n\nThey also had to come up with an excuse for the sometimes poor performance\n\nof UK and Commonwealth fighter squadrons, particularly in North Africa and\n\nthe Middle East. For example the South Africans in particular seemed to\n\nhave been poorly prepared for air combat, and suffered undue casualties.\n\nCan't really blame the Commowealth nations though or their militaries, the\n\nUK does want to emphasize the shoddy preparation of Colonian cannon fodder.\n\nWhat better fall-guy than to fault a foreign supplied aircraft?\n\nThe P-40, and to a lesser extent P-39, also had the problem of being the\n\nleading exampeles of the arsenal of democracy. They were in every theater\n\nfrom Alaska to Burma, from Lybia to Leningrad. Needless to say, the plane\n\nwasn't equally suited to all these enivronments.\n\nIn the US military, both P-40 and P-39 were in fact often deployed without\n\nmuch consideration of their strengths and weaknesses, (like being used in\n\nthe Pacific to intercept high altitude Japanese bomber formations). With\n\nforiegn nations, the same problem existed, often compounded with inadequate\n\ntraining, spare parts, and lack of support equipment and personnell. The\n\nRussians for example got no spare parts or even ammunition with their\n\nP-40's.

Its the same dynamic that led to the mythical exxageration of the\n\nprowess of the Zero, for example, for many of the same reasons. The P40\n\nand P39 became associated with the early defeats of the war (unlike say, the\n\nSpit, which was associated with early victory of the Battle of Britain)\n\nI think these factors, compounded by the fact that modern writers, who lack\n\ndirect experience with these old aircraft, just repeated what was said\n\nbeforehand without much criticial examination, are why so many myths\n\nremained for so long from WW II.\n\nThe two big factors changing now are the appearance of realistic flight\n\nsimulations and the opening up of the Russian records, and particuarly the\n\nRussian perspective on the war, which has shed an important new light on\n\nevents.\n\nDB\n\n\"Drifter Bob\" <nob...@nowhere.net> wrote in message\n\nnews:mYMqd.69387$IQ.3...@bignews6.bellsouth.net...\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>> I would like to know one thing.

The Typhoon and Tempest of course had all\n\nkinds of problems..\n\nThe question ultimately is, which was a \"good\" airplane and which wasn't.\n\nI'm trying to debunk the mythology that the P-40 was obsolete before it was\n\nbuilt, that it was unmaneuverable, that it was grossly inferior to all the\n\nenemy aircraft it faced, that it was only good for fighter bomber missions,\n\netc. and etc.\n\nThe P-40 was a great front line fighter. It was extremely manueverable,\n\nrugged, heavily armed and fast for the early part of the war. It was a\n\nvery, very dangerous high powered thoroughbread airplane, not some chugging\n\nhalf assed second line clunker. It happened to not be a high altitude\n\naircraft, and didn't climb well. Nearly every aircraft has a vice of some\n\nkind or some kind of tactical or strategic limitation. The poor high\n\naltitude performance (hardly unique to the P-40) was a strategic limitation,\n\nbut so for that matter was the short range of the Spitfire. The poor climb\n\nrate was a tactical weakness, but few if any aircraft of this period had\n\nevery desirable trait.\n\nThe P-40 had superb roll rate, among the best in the world\n\nIt had an excellent turn rate, comparable to the Spitfire.\n\nIt had excellent high speed performance an a fast dive rate\n\nIt was incredibly tough, known to survive numerous air-to air collisions and\n\nintentonal rammings, among other things.\n\nIt had a good though not fantastic operational range.\n\nAnother major deficiency of the P-40 is that it did not turn out to be a\n\ngood platform for steady improvement and modernization, unlike the Spit or\n\nthe Bf109. By 1943, the P-40 was largely out-classed in terms of speed,\n\nclimb rate, and increasingly firepower.

I would go further, however: multiple\n\nExcept, US pilots often DID have to go against bombers, as in North Africa,\n\nand Italy especially. It's not a matter at that point of whether four or\n\nsix .50's can take down a bomber, it's how quickly it can do so while you\n\nare being shot at\n\nattacking a bomber is dangerous, if you approach from behind the way you\n\nwould a fighter, you are slowly closing with an enemy who is shooting at\n\nyou, and while you are trying to fly and line up your aircraft to shoot,\n\ntheir gunner(s) are shooting at you. All they need to do is line up a\n\nswivel gun or a turret, which is a little eaier. This is even more\n\nexcaserbated when you are facing several bombers flying in formation, all\n\nshooting at you.\n\nThat is why the preferred methods of attacking even moderately well defended\n\nbombers (such as G4M, Ju-88, He 111 etc) is to attack from below, from the\n\nside, or from head on. In this case however you have even less time to\n\nshoot, a fraction of a second.\n\nThe key point is that you need to destroy or cripple that bomber in a very,\n\nvery short time, often with a very few number of bullets hitting. if you\n\nare coming in head on or swooping up from below, this might actually mean\n\nliterally less than half a second of shooting time. A 20mm cannon can blow\n\noff a wing, blow up a cockpit, or blow out an enemy with 2 or 3 rounds. A\n\n.50 cal isn't going to do that, it penetrates very well and punches holes\n\nthrough anything but very heavy armor, but it doesn't damage the structure\n\nas much as an exploding cannon shell.\n\n> fifties was not merely good enough against most Axis fighters, it was\n\n> likely the preferred armament.\n\nHa! Try going head to head with a Fw 190, BF 109K, a N1K1, or a K-84 armed\n\nwith the standard 6 x .50's on the Mustang, Corsair, or Hellcat. For that\n\nmatter, try shooting a heavily armored fighter like a Fw190 from dead astern\n\nand see how long it takes to knock it down... precious seconds which could\n\nlead to your death...\n\n> That probably was especially true of American pilots, who would be\n\n> less inclined than most to conserve ammunition.\n\nThe extra ammo in the .50's IS a nice advantage. Most other nations\n\ncompramise by having .30 cal MG with a lot of ammo, and 20mm or 30mm cannon\n\nwith less. That way you can line up your target with the MG's, and get the\n\nkilling shots with just a few cannon shells.\n\nThere is no doubt however that cannons kill quicker, and quick kills are the\n\nname of the game in air combat.\n\nFrankly, Cub Driver, I think you could benefit from a little time on a good\n\nflight Sim. If they weren't effective simulations, why else would the\n\nmilitary use them? There are some things you just dont learn about the\n\nreality of air combat any other way (short of the real thing)\n\nDB\n\nDB"
