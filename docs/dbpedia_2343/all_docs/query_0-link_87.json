        "text": "F adeev (correctly - Faddeev) Vadim Ivanovich - squadron commander of the 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment (216th mixed aviation division, 4th air army, North Caucasian Front), guard captain.\n\nBorn on December 13 (25), 1917 in the village of Fedkino, now Terengulsky district, Ulyanovsk region, in a family of teachers. Russian. He lived in the city of Kuibyshev (now Samara), where he graduated from the 3rd year of the construction institute and the flying club, where he was left as an instructor.\n\nIn the Red Army since 1940. In 1940 he graduated from the Chkalov Military Aviation Pilot School.\n\nI met the beginning of the Great Patriotic War in one of the fighter regiments in Siberia. Wrote a report about sending to the front.\n\nMember of the Great Patriotic War since August 1941. Sergeant Fadeev fought in the 446th, 131st, 630th (since December 1941) fighter and 762nd mixed aviation regiments. On the I-16 plane, he flew as a wingman for the future Hero Vladimir Istrashkin. Member of the CPSU (b) since 1942.\n\nFadeev was distinguished by high growth (about 2 meters) and a powerful physique. Subsequently, at the front, he was personally issued a double ration. For his cheerful and sociable character, he enjoyed the love and respect of his comrades. He read a lot, played the guitar well, sang beautifully. There were legends about Fadeev's sorties at the front. Possessing great physical strength and endurance, he made 5-6 sorties a day. At the same time, his attitude to danger sometimes reached the point of recklessness. For mischief, he grew his beard \"with a shovel\" - \"for the fear of enemies,\" as he said. And his call sign was appropriate - \"Beard\".\n\nOn November 27, 1941, during a sortie, the I-16 Fadeev was shot down. The pilot reached the neutral zone and moved to his positions. But then ... he led a group of infantrymen who attacked a high-rise, over which he himself had just flown in a wrecked plane. The fighters captured the height, destroying a mortar battery, several enemy firing points and armored cars. For this land battle, pilot Fadeev was awarded the Order of the Red Banner and soon received the first officer rank of \"lieutenant\".\n\nIn one of the sorties, having spent ammunition, Fadeev attacked a Romanian cavalry unit from a strafing flight using an aircraft propeller as a weapon.\n\nIn 1942, after being wounded and due to a conflict with the regiment commander, Fadeev was transferred to a reserve regiment in the rear. In August 1942 he was enrolled in the 16th Guards Fighter Regiment to A.I. Pokryshkin. He was promoted to flight commander and then squadron leader. By that time, Fadeev had 1 personal air victory on his account.\n\nIn air battles in the North Caucasus, along with Pokryshkin, the Glinka brothers, Fadeev became the most productive ace of the Kuban battle. By April 28, 1943, Captain Fadeev completed 394 sorties, conducted 43 air battles, shot down 17 enemy aircraft and 1 in the group. He was the first of the pilots of the 4th Air Army who fought in the Kuban, presented to the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nAt kazam of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of May 24, 1943 for the exemplary performance of combat missions of the command on the front of the fight against the invaders and the courage and heroism shown by the guard to the captain Fadeev Vadim Ivanovich posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Hero did not have time to receive the award. The performance went around the authorities, but the fighting continued ... On May 5, 1943, Vadim Fadeev died in an unequal battle. The Germans hunted for him, as well as for other Soviet aces. On that day, he collided with 12 Nazi fighters, according to some reports, he shot down two planes, but he himself was seriously wounded. The pilot managed to land the damaged plane in the floodplain, but, having lost consciousness, died from blood loss. The forced landing site was found only a few days later.\n\nBy that time, Vadim Fadeev had made more than 400 sorties, conducted 51 air battles and shot down 17 personally and in a group of 3 enemy aircraft **.\n\nHe was buried in the central park of the village of Kyiv, Krymsky District, Krasnodar Territory.\n\nCaptain of the Guard (1943). He was awarded the Order of Lenin (05/24/1943), two Orders of the Red Banner (12/23/1941, 04/22/1943).\n\nThe name of the Hero is carried by the streets in the city of Samara and in the village of Kievskoye. Busts of V.I. In Samara, on the house in which he lived, and on the street that bears his name, there are memorial plaques.\n\nVadim Fadeev was born on December 25, 1917 in the village of Fedkino, now the Terengulsky district of the former Ulyanovsk region, in a family of teachers. He lived in Kuibyshev, graduated from the 3 courses of the Construction Institute and the local flying club, where he was left as an instructor. Vadim was well educated, well-read, sang beautifully, very handsome - almost two meters tall, blond with blue eyes. In 1940 he was drafted into the Red Army, graduated from the Chkalovsky military aviation school for pilots.\n\nOn the fronts of the Great Patriotic War since August 1941. At first he fought as part of the 131st Fighter Aviation Regiment, flying an I-16 aircraft. Once, in the region of Kodyma (Moldova), V.I. Fadeev attacked a column of Romanian cavalrymen with a group of fighters. Having shot all the cartridges, he went down to the very ground and chopped the riders with the propeller of the aircraft.\n\nIn 1943, Lieutenant Fadeev arrived in the 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, quickly mastered new equipment, became an excellent lead pair, and then a squadron commander. Vadim carefully kept the document issued by the commander of the Air Army - an order to issue him a double food ration and a permit for individual tailoring of clothes and shoes. From the finished uniform, nothing suited him - everything was not enough.\n\nHis brilliant abilities as a fighter pilot were fully revealed in the battles in the Kuban. Possessing great physical strength and endurance, he made 5-6 sorties a day. He often shot down several aircraft per flight, and once in one week he destroyed 10 aircraft personally and 1 in a group. By the end of April 1943, Captain V.I. Fadeev made 394 sorties, conducted 43 air battles and personally shot down 17 enemy aircraft.\n\nOne of the features of his character was a dismissive attitude to danger and an underestimation of the enemy's forces. Sometimes he behaved simply recklessly - he could, having abandoned the management of the group, chase after a single \"Messer\"; turn on the transmitter in flight and perform arias from operas; perform \"circus\" tricks at low altitude over the airfield. For the sake of mischief, he grew his beard with a \"shovel\" - \"for the fear of enemies,\" as he said. His broad Volga nature and confidence in his outstanding abilities often manifested themselves in an overestimation of his capabilities.\n\nVadim Fadeev died in an unequal air battle on May 5, 1943. In the last sortie, he, having shown his often inherent self-confidence, decided to act independently, and this was his fatal mistake. Breaking away from the main group of our fighters, led by A.I. Pokryshkin, he and his wingman Andrey Trud met a group of 12 Me-109 fighters. In this battle, Fadeev shot down 2 aircraft, but was seriously wounded and died returning to his airfield.\n\nBy that time, he had made more than 400 sorties and conducted 51 air battles. He had 21 personal and 1 group victories on his account (other figures are given in some sources, for example, 17 personal and 3 group victories). Assault strikes destroyed up to 90 vehicles, 15 guns, 25 wagons and a lot of enemy manpower.\n\nOn May 24, 1943, for courage and military prowess shown in battles with enemies, Vadim Ivanovich Fadeev was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. During the war, he was awarded the Orders of Lenin, the Red Banner (twice), and medals. He was buried in the central park of the village of Kievskoye, Krasnodar Territory. Streets in Kuibyshev and Kievskaya bear his name.\n\nBest of the day\n\nA true legend of the global pop scene\n\nVisited:212\n\nDisgusting collection, or how to become famous\n\nVisited:164\n\nKarl Habsburg-Lothringen\n\nAfter the war, friends from the front, who loved this house so much, gathered, a moment came, and, looking into her husband’s eyes, Maria asked him: “Sasha, imagine that now… Vadim would appear?”\n\nHe would have appeared with a bang, filling the rooms with his magnificent Chaliapin-style roaring bass. He breathed joyful animation into the guests, riveted everyone's attention to himself with a well-aimed joke on the topic of the day, an artistic recitation of poetry or Prince Igor's opera aria: “Oh, give me freedom ...”. He would have guessed the mood of everyone at once, only briefly looking at him with a cheerful penetrating look of large gray-blue eyes ...\n\nAnd for each he would find a sincere word. Vadim! The pilots smiled only when they heard his approach. Only Vadim Fadeev, with his jokes, could at dawn and five languishing tension before a sortie into the Cuban sky.\n\nA constellation of aces fought next to Pokryshkin, some of them had a larger number of downed aircraft in 1945 than Vadim Fadeev, but Alexander Ivanovich said only about the latter: “He could become a Hero three times.”\n\nProbably, nowhere and never has there been such a fighter pilot: almost two meters tall and weighing about a hundred kilograms, but at the same time a slender, athletic build. When asked how he fits on the plane, Vadim, laughing, compared himself to a folding wooden ruler:\n\n“True, during the battle, sometimes you have to look for an additional point of support, resting your head on the cabin ceiling.” At first, he was sent to bombers, where there is room for a giant at the helm, but Fadeev won the right to be a fighter. He had a sharp reaction, the ability to maneuver with an overload inaccessible to others. According to his warehouse, Vadim was a fighter - a lone swift warrior.\n\nEach of his appearances on the roads of war, or later, on the pages of memories, is unique, imbued with a special meaning. This property is only for outstanding people.\n\nPokryshkin and Fadeev knew about each other even before the first meeting at the division headquarters, where Alexander Ivanovich received his first order. Correspondents wrote about the best fighters, the rumor about them was passed from mouth to mouth in the regiments, in contrast to the dryish newspaper lines, gaining a lively brilliance and charm.\n\nThey started talking about Fadeev shortly after his arrival at the front on August 10, 1941. Here are two nines of I-16s successfully storming a convoy. Vadim dives six times, setting cars on fire. Then, in parting, it goes up vertically, triumphantly showing the immaculate Immelman to the defeated enemy. Returning to the airfield, the fighters see a column of refugees cut down by the Romanian cavalry in the steppe in the Kodyma region. Having caught up with the cavalrymen, they shoot them with the remaining shells and cartridges. Having used up the ammunition load, Fadeev, in righteous anger at low level flight, cuts down an officer with a propeller. On the I-16 propeller blade, after it landed, the mechanics found a piece of the occupier's cranial bone. It was not possible to hear or read about the second such example during the war years ...\n\nOn November 27, 1941, Vadim landed an aircraft damaged during an attack on a neutral zone near the Five Brothers mound, northwest of Rostov-on-Don. Having managed to evaluate the German defense during planning, Fadeev ran to the infantry trench under fire. After a conversation with the commander, the giant with a machine gun in his hand left the dugout and with his powerful bass raised the battalion to the attack: “Forward! For the Motherland! The plane was saved, the altitude was taken. Taken by surprise, the Germans were unable to resist. The commander of the infantry division reported to the 446th air regiment about the feat of Sergeant Vadim Ivanovich Fadeev.\n\nIn the winter of 1942, Fadeev, who did not have enough fuel when returning from reconnaissance, landed at the airfield of the Pokryshkin squadron. Already a lieutenant with the Order of the Red Banner on his chest, he struck the young pilots with a face disfigured by repeated frostbites. Fadeev did not spare himself, he flew with an open canopy in any frost. In the dining room, the guest stunned the commander of the BAO with a paper signed by General S. A. Krasovsky himself, with an order to issue a double portion to the owner of this document. After lunch, Vadim completed the impression he had made by taking off with his usual aerobatics chic.\n\nAt the very first meeting with Pokryshkin, Fadeev said:\n\n\"Ready to be a friend!\" Alexander Ivanovich recalled that day with the words: “Fate connected our path ...” Having met again already in the Caucasus, near the Caspian Sea, in August 1942, two pilots hugged, clapped each other on the shoulders for a long time ... Having learned that Fadeev was sent to the reserve regiment , Pokryshkin first of all calls him to his 16th Guards. \"I agree! Let's fight together!\" Vadim answers. Isaev gives the go-ahead for the translation, overwhelmed by the power of Fadeev’s handshake: “Well, what a power!” To Figichev’s question: “Why did you grow a beard?” followed by words that caused general laughter: \"For the fear of enemies!\"\n\nThus began the military friendship of the two Ivanovichs - Alexander Pokryshkin and Vadim Fadeev. Ever since the epic times in Russia, leading a circular defense against enemy raids, twinning, the brotherhood of the cross, appears. Two warriors, Cossacks, exchanged pectoral crosses as a sign of fraternal devotion and fidelity to the coffin. On the chest of the Soviet pilots were in 1942 the Order of Lenin and the Red Banner, but the essence of their friendship remained the same ...\n\nVadim is the first to fully comprehend Pokryshkin's \"science of winning\" in the air, becomes a like-minded friend, instantly grasps his ideas and developments even before they are triumphantly tested in practice.\n\nProbably, it was Vadim, with his sensitivity and irresistible love of life, who saved his friend in the darkest hour of his life, when Pokryshkin, without waiting for the tribunal, wanted to end his own life. “What are you thinking, Sasha! Stop fooling around! More than once we will fight together against the Nazis!”\n\nOn the boat, Pokryshkin and Fadeev went to the Caspian Sea, conducted their conversations, as Alexander and Stepan Suprun once spoke in the stormy Black Sea. Vadim was the first to whom Pokryshkin told about his relationship with Maria, about his desire to start a family. “Vadim,” Alexander Ivanovich recalled, “was able to quickly eliminate the misunderstandings that arose in our relationship with Maria with a joke, a challenge to a frank conversation.” In Makhachkala, Fadeev sat a friend and his beloved in front of a photographer and presciently said: “Now take a picture of them together! You do not see that the girl is embarrassed. I assure you that they will keep the photograph you take until the end of their lives ... ”M.K. Pokryshkina wrote in her book:\n\n“Vadim's prediction came true. This photo is now in Sasha's office in a place of honor, and every time I look at it, I mentally thank Vadim ... \"\n\nYes, this man could leave an indelible mark on his soul ... The political officer of the regiment, M.A. Pogrebnoy, wore a beard for five years as a sign of his memory. Hero of the Soviet Union Arkady Fedorov, who became friends with Vadim at the end of 1941, recalled 20 years later: “I still often consult with him mentally when I need to make some important decision.” Hero of the Soviet Union Nikolai Iskrin, his fellow countryman from Kuibyshev (Samara), said: “From the whole appearance of Vadim Fadeev, the mighty power of a real Volga hero blew. About people like him, poems, legends and songs were composed, artists dedicated their canvases to them. In our regiment, Vadim was everyone's favorite. His image will never be erased from my memory.\n\nYes, he was a Volgar, grew up on the banks of this sacred Russian river, mother and nurse. Many talents and a number of famous pilots gave Russia the world of the great Volga full of originality. Nesterov and Chkalov have already been mentioned. The coryphaeus of long-range aviation, the son of the captain of the Volga steamer Alexander Golovanov, was also born here, also unusually handsome, two meters tall, generously endowed with intelligence and iron strength.\n\n... Vadim knew the nature of his native river well. As a high school student, he got the right to drive a motorboat, loved the open space, fighting a strong wave, spray flying over his head. Working as a mail carrier, he once persuaded the postman to cross, despite the approach of a thunderstorm. The storm caught the boat on the rapids of the river, it was already impossible to turn. The postman survived the stress, Vadim bawled out songs with delight ...\n\nAt the age of 11, Vadim, as indicated in the description, \"according to the data of a pedagogical examination in mental development, gives an increase of one and a half years.\" And then he studies well, reads a lot, is fond of Mayakovsky's poetry, music, and opera. Father Ivan Vasilievich, a major civil engineer, wanted to direct his son in his footsteps, and Vadim entered the construction institute, but in his second year he stopped attending classes. In the 1930s, aviation had no rivals among young talents with excellent health ... In the flying club, a new set of pilots was planned only a year later. In a month, Vadim masters the six-month-long courses of drivers at Osoaviakhim, works on a bread van, and then on an ambulance more suitable for his character. The father does not give up, he agrees with the dean on the admission of his son to the session. That one, having not attended a single lecture in the semester, passes the session with “excellent”! And still leaves the third year. All evenings he studies aviation-technical literature. On his birthday, friends wrote to Vadim: “You, born on the great days of our era; you are a great man in form, structure and complexion; you, whose foot has no equal; you, who are doomed to great torment in search of size 49 boots and are deprived of the opportunity to visit the ice rink; you, who to this day have lived in the world for exactly two dozen years, in the days of grandiose victories on the entire socialist front, accept our sincere congratulations ... \".\n\nIn 1938, Fadeev, again, excellently graduated from the Kuibyshev flying club, was left there as an instructor, and only in January 1940 was released to the Ulyanovsk flight school. From there he was sent to the Chkalovsk (Orenburg) school. The uniform, which the new cadet called \"armor\", he had to sew - the right size was not found. When was the double ration approved. An old photograph has preserved one of the jokes of a young strong man - Fadeev proudly, with a grin, holds on his hands and shoulders three classmates with the usual build with militantly mischievous faces.\n\nIn the school, the foreman “knocks the crap out” of an unbridled cadet for two months. But the nature of the Volga rebel, as Pokryshkin later identified his friend, no, no, but made itself felt ...\n\nHaving mastered and looked around, Fadeev externally passes the theory exams with excellent marks, overtaking everyone; without \"export\" makes an independent flight. In the newspaper of the school, an article is printed about him with a portrait called \"Steel Will\". After taking off on the I-16, Vadim writes to his parents:\n\n“Oh, and good! When you fly and make various “slanders”, when it seems that the car is me myself ... The car is tense to the extreme, the engine roars so that it becomes scary for those standing on the ground - no matter how it falls apart. But the main goal is to test yourself during overloads in order to take everything that it is capable of from the car. Surprising in these lines is the similarity with the way of thinking of Pokryshkin, who at the same time called his figures in the sky of Moldova not “slander”, but “hooks”. The phrase \"take everything from the car ...\" coincides literally with two aces!\n\nThe year 1941 finds Fadeev in the Far East, where he is awarded the rank of sergeant of military service ... He did not have to serve here for long, after the start of the war, part of the train along the Trans-Siberian Railway was sent to the west. On the back of the picture, where Fadeev is standing at the “donkey” next to twelve aviators, it is written in his hand: “5.7.41. Shanks. Friends who are going to beat everyone who climbs on the USSR. In Balashov, missing flying, Vadim demonstrates such figures at low altitude with a dive over the city center that the Air Force commander, who turned out to be a witness, sends the pilot to the guardhouse: “Recklessness! Take action immediately! There will be more imitators, then accidents, disasters.\n\n“Bastards are fascist pilots. When they bombard, then, if there are no our fighters, they go down and shoot civilians from low ground. Recently, their fighters, having flown into one village, from fifty meters began to fire at children swimming in the river ... I myself am a fighter, but I will never shoot German children, although my hand will not waver to destroy any number of fascists in battle.\n\nBy August 1942, Fadeev accounted for six downed German aircraft. But even of those pilots with whom he arrived at the front, few survived. Lieutenant Georgy Plotnikov died, with whom Vadim became friends in the Far East.\n\n…Hold on, German! Fully armed with new technology and Pokryshkin's tactics, Vadim Fadeev took to the skies of the Kuban. “Let the noble fury boil like a wave”… From V. I. Fadeev’s award sheet: “11.4.43, covering his troops in the area of ​​Ukrainian, Shiptalskaya, Stavropolskaya, Krasny Tabakovod, fought an air battle with 4 Me-109. As a result of decisive attacks, Comrade Fadeev shoots down one Me-109 ... An informing radio station - the call sign \"squirrel\" said: \"air cobra\", stop fire, \"mass\" is on fire. But comrade Fadeev accompanied the vulture to the very ground with machine-gun and cannon fire ... Comrade Fadeev had a lot of combat episodes and all sorties occurred with a meeting of enemy fighters.\n\n\"Hey, let's go!\" - Violating discipline on the air, Vadim sang \"Dubinushka\" in flight. Hey, let's go! “The first person to whom during the fighting in the Kuban I signed a submission for the title of Hero of the Soviet Union was V.I. Fadeev. And he fully deserved it ... - recalled General N. F. Naumenko. - During one of the weeks he destroyed ten enemy aircraft personally and one in the group. This is a very big victory.\" The general also noted that, upon personal acquaintance, “I immediately liked the pilot for the depth and liveliness of his mind, a clear understanding of the tasks facing fighter aircraft. Later, it became a kind of need for me to see our hero and talk to him.\n\nIvan Babak wrote: “Vadim Fadeev was a common favorite, even in our neighboring forty-fifth regiment he was considered some kind of special pilot. After all, in each battle he would definitely shoot down 2-3 aircraft!\n\nVadim continued to amuse his comrades. At first, as already mentioned, the pilots of the 16th and 45th regiments were placed in Krasnodar, in a dilapidated warehouse, on bunk beds. At night, the racks could not withstand the weight of Fadeev, who collapsed on Dmitry Glinka. The pilots sleeping nearby woke up from the roar, deciding that another bombing had begun. And the dream of two tired Hercules, to everyone's amazement and laughter, was not disturbed!\n\nBy April 28, as indicated in the submission for the title of Hero, Fadeev already had 394 sorties, of which 118 were for attack, 155 for reconnaissance, 106 for escorting bombers, 55 for patrol and cover. In 43 air battles, he personally shot down 17 aircraft (15 Me-109, but one Yu-87 and Yu-88) and one in a group (Me-109). These are official figures, they are probably underestimated. After all, the planes shot down behind the front line, left without confirmation by the ground forces, as already mentioned, were not counted by Soviet pilots then.\n\nThe Germans began hunting for the best Russian aces. Highlighting his \"Akhtung, akhtung!\" Pokryshkin, they, according to N. I. Umansky, also started talking about Glinka, Fadeev and Rechkalov. \"Khadeev, Khadeev...\" - the voices of German observers came from the radio. They also knew his call sign \"Beard\".\n\n\"To be or not to be. That's the question…” - another favorite number performed by Vadim - Prince Hamlet's monologue from act 111 of Shakespeare's tragedy…\n\nAlexander Ivanovich, together with political officer M. A. Pogrebny, worried about a friend. Vadim's young wife came to Popovicheskaya. They met shortly before that in the reserve regiment. Lyudmila was married to Nikolai Lavitsky, one of the best pilots of the 45th regiment. Spectacular in appearance, she played the accordion beautifully, loved communication, feasts. Vadim fell in love with her without memory and “recaptured” her from her husband, who had a hard time surviving the betrayal ...\n\nOnce Vadim, returning from a sortie, over the house where he lived with Lyudmila in the village, began to show his virtuoso aerobatics. From an ambush in the clouds, a pair of Messerschmitts dived on Fadeev. He was saved from death only by a warning from the ground on the radio of Arkady Fedorov, who managed to jump into the cab of the Cobra.\n\nPokryshkin boiled: “What are you doing, Vadim?! Foolishly decided to die?!… You behave like a vagrant merchant. In combat flight, turning on the transmitter, you perform arias from operas. Recklessly sometimes chasing individual \"messers\", leaving to manage the group. Who needs this circus?! You are the commander, you must set an example.” Vadim agreed, but could not overcome himself ...\n\nOn May 5, 1943, the regiment commander N.V. Isaev determined the composition of the group that flew out on patrol. A pair of Fadeev was connected to the Pokryshkin link. Andrey Trud most often flew as Vadim's wingman. Only such an experienced tenacious pilot could hold on to him. In flight, Fadeev began to move away from the group.\n\n- “Beard”, I am Pokryshkin, come closer, why are you coming off?\n\nNow I'll come!\n\nThese were Vadim's last words that his friend heard. Soon, Pokryshkin's link entered into battle with the Junkers and Messerschmitts. A couple of Fadeevs, far away from their own, were attacked by twelve Messerschmitts. As Andrei Trud later said, he was bound by battle. Vadim was hit and went home... He did not return to the airfield.\n\nOn that day, the German “expert” aces, using intelligence and radio interception data, made a decisive attempt to crack down on the best pilots of the 16th regiment. Pokryshkin in this sortie escaped with the help of Ivan Stepanov from the “pincers”, into which he was rigidly taken by two pairs of Me-109s. And then it was Pokryshkin who was shot by the Yak-\"werewolf\".\n\nKnowing the strength of the \"Beard\", the Germans lured him under the blow of a group that had an overwhelming numerical superiority.\n\nHis friends did not learn about the place of Vadim's death. N. I. Umansky, in a letter to the author of these lines, recalled:\n\n“I visually observed this pirate air battle from the army command post due to a cloud ambush. You should have seen with what cruelty they attacked him! This fight lasted five or six minutes. Three German planes were on fire, but Fadeev's plane also rolled off to the side with a decrease, all this happened in the Abinskaya-Krymskaya area. Fadeev was seriously wounded and still headed towards the village of Popovichnaya, towards his airfield ...\n\nFadeev landed his \"aerocobra\", without releasing the landing gear, near the lake, forty kilometers from the village of Slavyanskaya, in the reeds. When I was at the site of his forced landing and death, he had already been buried. It was around May 10-11, I arrived with two senior officers of the army headquarters, it was really difficult to get there, everything was still mined, trenches, ditches, various defense structures, lakes and swamps were all around.\n\nOn the spot, we were told by anti-aircraft defense gunners that the pilot was still alive for some time after landing, about an hour and a half, but was unconscious and soon died. His body was tortured by mosquitoes, the likes of which I have never seen anywhere in my life - in size, like wasps. Anti-aircraft gunners found Fadeev and buried him. I personally inspected the plane, the cockpit was smashed, covered in blood. The blow fell on the front of the aircraft, the instruments and sight were mutilated. The grave was very small, on the board there was an inscription “Pilot V. I. Fadeev died on May 5, 1943” and an asterisk, that’s all.\n\nThose officers with whom I went to this place asked everyone, wrote everything down, talked with the officers who buried Fadeev, took a photo of the plane and the grave.\n\nI. M. Dzusov, who was on duty at the army command post, reported to the regiment about our plane that had exploded. Can you imagine what is left of the plane and the pilot after hitting the ground and exploding? But Fadeev's follower Andrey Trud did not confirm this. In fact, the Yak-3 plane from Savitsky’s corps exploded, exactly at the place where Dzusov spoke, this was established by a later check, and Fadeev landed his “aircobra”, being seriously wounded with a broken head and chest ... Why didn’t the regiment find out about this , I don't know.\"\n\n* * *\n\nThere is a statement that the war ends only when the last dead soldier is buried. If this is so, then it is understandable why we lost many fruits of the Victory of 1945... According to the Krasnodar Regional Center for Search Works, 86-87 thousand dead were buried in official graves in the Krasnodar Territory. And 200-300 thousand soldiers remained lying in the Kuban fields and forests. As well as in the places of other battles and battles ...\n\nIn the region, for the first time in the country in the 1990s, the laws “On search work”, “On security (memorial) zones of the Krasnodar Territory” and “On ensuring the safety and maintenance of Russian and foreign military graves and military graves on the territory of the Krasnodar Territory” were adopted . Funds have been allocated from the budget, there is opposition to \"businessmen\" - marauders who are looking for orders, weapons, gold.\n\nUntil now, detachments of disinterested ascetics-searchers have been walking around Russia at their own peril and risk, finding the remains of the dead. Many, many of them still lie in the forests and swamps. Only sometimes it is possible to establish their names ...\n\n... On May 10, 1943, when there was some calm in the air, the results were summed up in the regiment. The death of Vadim shocked everyone. For Pokryshkin, this was the heaviest loss since the beginning of the war.\n\nHaving received permission to speak, Alexander Ivanovich again named the main reason for the death of the pilots - patrolling in small groups, while the Germans were operating in large forces. In response to Isaev’s remark: “We must reckon with the quantitative composition of the regiment,” Pokryshkin proposed increasing the number of sorties for each pilot, with which they agree.\n\nPokryshkin also said: “You can’t make groups of bosses. This leads to different decisions in the conduct of combat, to a violation of the idea of ​​​​the group commander and to unjustified losses. The appointment of Fadeev as the leader of the couple in my six was wrong and led to his death.\n\nAfter that, \"Isaev, without listening to me, closed the meeting so as not to listen to comments about the shortcomings in the combat work of the regiment, which he himself was to blame.\"\n\nLet's say a few words about Vadim's girlfriend ... Friends persuaded Fadeev to send her to Kuibyshev to her parents, but Lyudmila remained in Popovichnaya. Upon learning of Vadim's death, she did not allow his child to be born and, having got rid of the burden, began working as a waitress in the flight canteen. Her former husband, also a Hero of the Soviet Union, also died. The pilots began to avoid the society of the femme fatale...\n\nPokryshkin, who after meeting with Maria changed his mind about a woman in the life of a pilot, nevertheless superstitiously did not even allow his beloved to approach the plane. In combat conditions, Alexander Ivanovich believed, the wife should not be around. So, Vadim's wife kept him away from communication with the pilots of the regiment, he did not participate in the debriefing and actions of the enemy. “All this could not but affect the combat form of Vadim ... - Pokryshkin wrote. - And in his last battle, Vadim showed his inherent courage and skill, but his usual underestimation of the enemy's forces, the neglect of real danger, also made themselves felt. These reflections of mine ... which I did not share with anyone ... confirmed me even more strongly in certain unshakable norms of pilot behavior on the ground and in the air. If you break them, retribution will inevitably come ... \"\n\nOf course, it was difficult to compare with the Siberian endurance and will of Pokryshkin, who went through an exceptionally harsh life school. Vadim basil in response: “What are you, Sasha, are you worried, is there really some lousy Fritz who can bring me down ?!”.\n\nWe must still admit that Fadeev’s underestimation of the enemy in battles with the “experts” of the Udet, Mölders and 52nd squadrons is also a kind of phenomenon ...\n\n... Spring of 1943. Aircobras received in Tehran. The pilots of the 16th Guards Regiment, having spent the night in one of the hotels in the eastern capital, are walking along the airfield towards American planes lined up in dense rows, shining with fresh paint in the rays of the rising sun. For one day, Soviet officers found themselves in an unfamiliar, different in colors, sounds, rhythm world of palaces and minarets, fashionable avenues and narrow poor streets, abundant bazaars and advertising lights. The real war and grief were far from here ...\n\nSuddenly stopping and, like a talented artist, immediately capturing his attention, Vadim, looking to the north, recited Yesenin's lines:\n\nIt's time for me to go back to Russia,\n\nPersia! Am I leaving you?\n\nAm I parting with you forever?\n\nFor the love of my native land\n\nIt's time for me to go back to Russia.\n\nThe pilots froze for a moment. As always, amazingly subtly, Vadim touched the innermost string in their souls ...\n\nFadeev, the maestro of amateur regimental activity, knew how to read poetry. His love for Mayakovsky, named by Stalin the best poet of the Soviet era, and for the then semi-forbidden Yesenin reflected the time of the 1920s and 1930s. Soviet Russia and outgoing Russia, unbridled passion, the mystery of death, not fully solved ... Fadeev resembles Mayakovsky in growth, seething energy, loudness. Yesenin - with a strand falling on his forehead, when Vadim did not have time to cut his hair short, in a front-line manner ... And with a look in which a childish clarity is visible behind a daring or comic challenge or, as in one of the last pictures in the Kuban, sad and aching: “My life Or did you dream about me ... \"\n\n... In early June 1999, Maria Kuzminichna, during a trip to the Kuban, which she dreamed of, visited Fadeev, in a school museum dedicated to the Hero. She also knew from the letters she received in Moscow that in the early 1990s it was decided to close the museum, at the same time Vadim's personal belongings, handed over by his father, also disappeared. But after a few years, people realized it ... How could it be without him ?! The museum has been restored, here again in the photographs Fadeev sits freely on the wing of the \"aircobra\" with Andrey Trud, holding, like an epic hero, three on his shoulders ... School teachers hold competitions among the children for the best knowledge of the biographies of A. I. Pokryshkin and V. I. Fadeev . The program of the \"young Pokryshkins\" from Fadeevo at the review in Krasnodar was distinguished by special enthusiasm. Yes, Vadim still knows how to lead and ignite!\n\nA monument to the Hero of the Soviet Union Vadim Ivanovich Fadeev was erected near the road from Fadeevo to Krymskaya. Maria Kuzminichna, peering at photographs of the bust in Moscow, believed that the sculptor could not achieve similarities with Vadim. But here she changed her mind. The photograph failed. She approached the pedestal, raising her head, touched the stone with her palms... Silence reigned among those accompanying the guest of honor.\n\nBehind the monument, standing on a steep slope, there was a stunningly beautiful view of the hilly expanses of the Kuban, shrouded in a June hot blue haze ...\n\nOn May 6, the famous composer Maxim Fadeev was born in Kurgan. Thanks to the work of this talented producer, many bright stars appeared on the Russian stage. Among them are Linda, Katya Lel, the Silver group, Nargiz Zakirova and many others. The musician does not stop there today.\n\nSports or music\n\nIn 1973, Maxim was 5 years old, and he was sent to study at a music school. This choice of parents was predictable, because they themselves were engaged in music. His father was a talented composer, and his mother was a singer. At the age of 12, Maxim already knew how to play the bass guitar, and at the age of fourteen he won the main prize at a jazz piano competition.\n\nFadeev was fond of martial arts and at the age of 17 he had the third rank in aikido. He began to study because he wanted to show his peers his abilities, achieve success, prove that he is an ordinary healthy guy. After all, he was given a terrible diagnosis of heart disease. And one day it let him down.\n\nWhen Maxim was performing another exercise, his heart septum burst from a large flow of blood. He lost consciousness and survived clinical death. Doctors performed a miracle and brought Fadeev back to life, but the door to big sport was closed.\n\nCarier start\n\nSoon Maxim became interested in dancing. He skillfully portrayed the movements of Michael Jackson, took part in various competitions and was already thinking about a singing career. Fadeev became the vocalist of the Convoy group, and in 1990 he performed in Jurmala with Shukenov's song \"Julia\" and took third place.\n\nThen he sang the composition of his own composition \"Dancing on Glass\". It seemed that the victory ended there. A complete surprise for the singer was the appearance of Sergei Krylov, who came to Fadeev right at home and offered to go to Moscow.\n\nIn 1991 Maxim and his wife moved to the capital. Fadeev began to work as an arranger. The earnings were small, but Sergey Krylov helped the singer's family in every possible way. After some time, Fadeev got his own producer, and he released clips for compositions from the Time of Wild Beasts album.\n\nFyodor Bondarchuk invited Maxim to write music for the film \"The Blue Army\". Sergey Bondarchuk was supposed to star in the tape, but, unfortunately, he died without playing his role. Fadeev's music was not useful.\n\nCareer Success\n\nIn 1993, the singer met Svetlana Geiman, who dreamed of becoming a pop singer. Maxim began to produce a girl under the pseudonym \"Linda\". Her work was crowned with success, she became a popular singer and idol of youth. Then material well-being came to the producer's family.\n\nDuring his work with Linda, the composer wrote 6 albums and received a large number of awards. Linda herself became \"Singer of the Year\" nine times. The performer and producer worked perfectly together, their collaboration brought great results. Why was the main hit of the nineties \"Crow\" standing.\n\nFadeev again decided to try himself as a solo artist. His song \"Run Through the Sky\" became a popular hit. Soon the singer left for Germany, where he composed compositions for films.\n\nIn 2002, Fadeev became the producer of the second season of Star Factory. By that time, he had already stopped working with Linda and produced the singer Glucose, the Monokini and Total groups.\n\nIn 2003, Maxim founded a personal production center and became a co-owner of Monolith Records. In 2004, the new season of Star Factory started, where he again acted as an idea generator and project creator.\n\nIn 2006, Fadeev founded the Silver team. Already in 2007, this group performed at Eurovision, taking third place. Soon the composer had hearing problems, but his friend found a good doctor who brought Maxim back to normal. He wrote the song \"Dyshi\" of the group \"Silver\" almost deaf.\n\nAfter this incident, the producer revised his view on many things. After some time, Fadeev presented a 3D cartoon, the plot of which was written based on his book Savva.\n\nIn 2014, the project “Voice. Children ”, where Pelageya, Bilan and Fadeev became mentors. A few hours before the blind auditions, Maxim was hospitalized due to kidney problems, and it was decided to reschedule the shooting. After treatment, Fadeev finally took his chair as a mentor.\n\nIt was his ward who became the winner of the project, and the show is one of the most popular programs on Russian television. In 2015, the second season of the program was released. And this time, a member of the Fadeeva team won. For personal reasons, Maxim did not get into the third season. He was replaced by Leonid Agutin.\n\nFadeev proved himself to be a competent and talented mentor. Children with great pleasure worked in Maxim's team. He showed himself as a real professional and made an amazing show out of each episode of this program. For participation in the project “Voice. Children ”Maxim refused the fee because he loves his little students too much.\n\nPersonal life\n\nWhen Maxim played in the Convoy team, he met a girl named Galina. She began to travel with Fadeev to concerts, and soon they got married. But the wife was seriously carried away by the singer's friend. Constant quarrels began, and the couple divorced. After a short time, Galina returned, begging her to forgive. But it was already too late.\n\nOnce Maxim selected the girls for the filming of the next clip of the Convoy group. One of the extras dancers was called Natalia. What is known about her is that she was born in Kurgan and has the pseudonym \"Daria Ukhacheva\". Fadeev immediately liked the girl, and he decided to marry her at all costs. Three months later, Maxim and Natalya signed.\n\nThe wife became pregnant, and they were looking forward to the birth of their daughter. But due to a medical error, the baby died during childbirth. After the singer composed the song \"Lullaby\", which he dedicated to his daughter.\n\nSoon Natalia became pregnant a second time. She and her husband moved abroad, and the wife began to be observed in one of the clinics in Germany. The Fadeevs remember the wonderful six years in this country with special warmth. It was here that their son Savva was born.\n\nDespite all the possibilities, the husband forbade Natalia to engage in creative activities. He was afraid that the stellar life would turn her head, and she would leave him. But Fadeev's wife turned out to be a modest and domestic person. The couple have been together for over 20 years. They raised a worthy son, who now plays the piano and writes poetry.\n\nThe producer used his prototype as the main character of the cartoon Savva: The Heart of a Warrior.\n\nMaxim takes on any business, and it brings success. His songs are popular in Russia and abroad. He also owes his success to his family. His wife and son always understand and support him.\n\nThe composer has a brother Artem, who also found himself in the musical field. He writes songs for famous artists.\n\nBorn December 25, 1917 in the village of Fedkino, now Terengulsky district of the former Ulyanovsk region, in a family of teachers. He lived in Kuibyshev, graduated from the 3 courses of the Construction Institute and the local flying club, where he was left as an instructor. Since 1940, in the ranks of the Red Army, he graduated from the Chkalovsky military aviation school for pilots.\n\nSince August 19, 1941, Lieutenant V.I. Fadeev on the fronts of the Great Patriotic War. Until November 1941, he served in the 446th SAP and the 131st IAP, then in the 630th (762nd) IAP (SAP). Since May 1942 - in the 16th Guards IAP. He flew on the I-16, Yak-1 and Air Cobra.\n\nBy the end of April 1943, the squadron commander of the 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment (216th Mixed Aviation Division, 4th Air Army, North Caucasian Front) of the Guard Captain V.I. Fadeev made 394 sorties. After 43 air battles, he shot down 17 enemy aircraft.\n\nOn May 24, 1943, for courage and military prowess shown in battles with enemies, he was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nHe was buried in the central park of the village of Kyiv, Krymsky District, Krasnodar Territory. Streets in the city of Samara and in the village of Kyiv bear his name.\n\nAwarded with orders: Lenin, Red Banner (twice).\n\n* * *\n\nVadim Fadeev was born in Kuibyshev on January 7, 1917. After high school he entered the flying club. He graduated from it in 1938. Worked as an instructor. In January 1940 he was sent to a military school for pilots. In July 1941, at his request, he was seconded to the active army.\n\nAt first he fought in the 446th and 131st aviation regiments, flying on the I-16 aircraft. Once, in the region of Kodyma (Moldova), V.I. Fadeev attacked a column of Romanian cavalrymen with a group of fighters. Having shot all the cartridges, he went down to the very ground and chopped the riders with the propeller of the aircraft.\n\nSuch a fact is interesting. V. Fadeev received the first Order of the Red Banner in the harsh year of 1941 near Taganrog. Finding himself in a difficult moment among the foot soldiers, he raised them to the attack and, setting an example of courage and courage, together with them recaptured the dominant height from the enemy.\n\nDuring the war years, the story of an old soldier, a participant in the liberation of Rostov-on-Don, cited in the book by V.I. Pogrebny - \"The Man from the Legend\" passed from mouth to mouth during the war years.\n\nIn the late autumn of 1941, on the 2nd day, our infantrymen fought for a small mound - \"Five Brothers\", of which there are many in the south, and could not dislodge the Nazis entrenched there. And suddenly our fighter flies over the German trenches, very low, silently, with a stopped propeller. The Nazis are shooting at him from rifles, from machine guns, they raised such a chatter, even plug your ears, but they don’t even take bullets. And he sits down on the frozen ground pitted with mines and shells, sits down 300 meters from the front line, calmly, as if out of the blue.\n\nA huge pilot jumps out of a small plane - as soon as he could fit in it - and runs to his own people, to the trenches. Around the bullets buzz with a whistle, pieces of 3 mines fell, sang in fragments, and nothing touched him. How can one not remember here: \"The bullet is afraid of the brave ...\" He jumps into the trench, covered the entire passage with a heroic figure, smiles.\n\nI know your trouble, brothers, - says the pilot. - Where is the commander? Lead.\n\nHe showed the commander on the map where the mortars were coming from, where the armored vehicles were located, in which places there were more infantry. Our artillery has spoken. A pilot jumped out of the commander's dugout, holding a machine gun in his hands, shouted in his mighty voice:\n\nForward for the Motherland!\n\nAnd he ran to the mound, covered with old legends and the glory of 5 brothers who died there many centuries ago, but did not allow the enemy to advance on the Russian land. The red infantry rose up and went on the attack. Everyone is trying to catch up with the giant, to break ahead. And on the move, he sends some around the heights, drags others with him ...\n\nHooray! - rolls over the mound.\n\nWe took the mound \"Five Brothers\", smashed mortar batteries, destroyed several armored cars, and captured 2 whole, many Nazis died there, many were taken prisoner, - the old soldier finished his story. “But I don’t know anything more about the giant.” They said he handed over the plane under guard and went his own way ...\n\nSuch is the story of the old soldier. And he turned out to be true. That giant was a fighter pilot of the 446th mixed air regiment, Sergeant Vadim Ivanovich Fadeev, a graduate of the Kuibyshev flying club. For the feat at the Five Brothers mound, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner, and was given the extraordinary military rank of Lieutenant.\n\nHere is what the former commander of the 4th Air Army writes about Fadeev Chief Marshal of Aviation K. A. Vershinin:\n\n“Shortly after this battle, Fadeev, already on another plane, flew out together with flight commander A. Ya. Novikov for reconnaissance. They had to go along the route Slavyansk - Kramatorsk - Konstantinovskaya - Artemovsk. anti-aircraft fire. However, the Soviet pilots, skillfully maneuvering, slipped through the curtain of fire. And then Novikov's wingman noticed a galloping horseman. Descending, Fadeev established that this was a fascist, and most likely a liaison officer who was in a hurry to deliver an important report to the headquarters. Not wanting to waste cartridges , which were intended for combat, the pilot hacked the rider with an airplane propeller.\n\nI knew Vadim Ivanovich Fadeev well. He was a tall, slender fellow, with lush hair and a neatly trimmed beard. Kind, sympathetic, he enjoyed respect and authority among fellow soldiers. He fought boldly, even risky ... \"\n\nHe was awarded the second Order of the Red Banner for air battles over Myskhako.\n\nIn 1943, Lieutenant V. I. Fadeev arrived in the 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, quickly mastered the new equipment, became an excellent leader of the pair, and then the squadron commander. Vadim carefully kept the document issued by the commander of the Air Army - an order to issue him a double food ration and a permit for individual tailoring of clothes and shoes. From the finished uniform, nothing suited him - everything was not enough.\n\nHis brilliant abilities as a fighter pilot were fully revealed in the battles in the Kuban. Possessing great physical strength and endurance, he made 5-6 sorties a day. Sometimes he shot down several planes per flight.\n\nKuban. Here, from April to June 1943, one of the largest air battles in the Great Patriotic War took place. As a result of continuous fierce battles, Soviet aviation wrested the initiative from the hands of the enemy and won air supremacy not only in this area, but later on on the entire Soviet-German front.\n\nThe first pilot of the 4th Air Army, presented to the high rank of Hero of the Soviet Union during the battles over the Kuban, was Guard Captain V. Fadeev. An ardent patriot, a skilled air fighter, Vadim smashed the enemy without a miss. Within only one week, he destroyed 10 enemy aircraft personally and 1 in the group!\n\nI remember the air battle, which was then conducted by Senior Lieutenant V. Fadeev of the Guard on April 17, 1943. The eight fighters led by him - the strike group - for the 3rd time started from the airfield. A cover group of 4 aircraft was led by Senior Lieutenant G. Rechkalov of the Guard. It was necessary to pass over the spurs of the Main Caucasian Range, covered with clouds in places, then turn around over the sea.\n\nAnd now the mountain range is behind. Vadim saw a blue expanse ahead. Sea! But there is no time to admire the beauties of nature. All attention to the airspace. The enemy may appear unexpectedly.\n\nThe pilot did not see, but rather intuitively felt that the enemy was somewhere close. I looked back. It is true: on the traverse of Anapa from the direction of the sun, heading for Novorossiysk, Ju-87 dive bombers were heavily floating in the air in several waves, with cover fighters above them. Vadim glanced up. There was a four of Grigory Rechkalov.\n\nTo the left, from the Anapa airfield, raising ribbons of yellowish dust behind them, enemy fighters took off. \"Hurry to help their own. Be fighting over the sea!\" - a thought flashed through Fadeev.\n\nTo the right, at some distance below, floated Novorossiysk shrouded in smoke. One could see frequent crimson flashes on a small spot - the Myskhako Peninsula. It was this area that needed to be covered from the attacks of enemy bombers. There, buried in the rocky ground, brave Soviet paratroopers stood to death, firmly holding the bridgehead.\n\n12 Ju-87s, accompanied by a group of Me-109s, approached the Myskhako area.\n\nRechkalov, attack the \"thin ones\"! - Senior Lieutenant Fadeev told the Guards, and he himself rushed to attack the bombers.\n\nCheerful and cheerful, Vadim was bold and impetuous in battle, fought desperately, despising the danger. He burned with hatred for the enemy, searched for him, and when he found him, he never retreated, no matter how strong the enemy was. The pilot seemed to merge with his fighter, his fire from a cannon and machine guns was sizzling.\n\nFadeev always relied on his wingman Andrei Trud and other pilots of the group. It is not surprising that in just 3 weeks he managed to defeat about 20 enemy aircraft. The commander saw everyone and saw everything, in a difficult moment he was ready to cover for a comrade. And this time, Fadeev did not hesitate and, despite the numerical superiority of the enemy, decided to impose his will on him.\n\nMeanwhile, Rechkalov's group had already shot down 2 Messers, which almost plummeted into the sea like burning torches. The Nazi pilots, apparently, were waiting for reinforcements, hoping that the Me-109 and the FW-190 that had recently appeared in the Kuban sky would help repel the onslaught of Soviet fighters. Soon a dozen and a half enemy vehicles really came up.\n\nHowever, this did not bother Fadeev. He countered the numerical superiority of the enemy with an accurate and bold maneuver, close interaction of the pairs of the group. On the vertical shot down one fighter, on the turn - the second, after them set fire to the Ju-87. Ivan Savin finished with 2 Messers. One plane was shot down by Vladimir Berezhnoy and Nikolai Iskrin. Mikhail Sutyrin was also lucky: he destroyed the latest German fighter with an air-cooled FW-190 engine.\n\nThis air battle showed that the enemy novelty - fighters with powerful weapons - can be beaten. These victories were the merit of the commander. His personal skill, courage, some special, Russian prowess inspired fighting friends.\n\nThis is how his brother-soldiers Vadim Ivanovich Fadeev remembered for the rest of his life. From August 1941 to May 1943, he made 434 sorties, participated in 51 air battles, shot down about 20 enemy aircraft, destroyed 80 vehicles, 15 guns, and up to 200 enemy soldiers and officers with assault actions. Paired with his slave A. Trud, who later became a Hero of the Soviet Union, he shot down 44 enemy aircraft.\n\nOne of the features of his character was a dismissive attitude to danger and an underestimation of the enemy's forces. Sometimes he behaved simply recklessly - he could, having abandoned the management of the group, chase after a single \"Messer\"; turn on the transmitter in flight and perform arias from operas; perform \"circus\" tricks at low altitude over the airfield. For the sake of mischief, he grew his beard with a \"shovel\" - \"for the fear of enemies,\" as he said. His broad Volga nature and confidence in his outstanding abilities often manifested themselves in an overestimation of his capabilities.\n\nVadim Fadeev died in an unequal air battle on May 5, 1943. In the last sortie, he, having shown his often inherent self-confidence, decided to act independently, and this was his fatal mistake. Breaking away from the main group of our fighters, led by A.I. Pokryshkin, he and his wingman Andrey Trud met a group of 12 Me-109 fighters. In this battle, Fadeev shot down 2 aircraft, but was seriously wounded and died returning to his airfield.\n\nBy that time, he had 21 personal and 1 group victories to his credit. [ M. Yu. Bykov in his research indicates 17 personal and 3 group victories. ]\n\nOn May 24, 1943, for courage and military prowess shown in battles with enemies, Vadim Ivanovich Fadeev was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe name of V. I. Fadeev by the Decree of the Council of Ministers of the USSR to the Kuibyshev Aviation Club DOSAAF. The sign on the building, the large portrait in the auditorium, and the full house above the gallery of masters of sports remind of this.\n\nVadim Fadeev returned to his native flying club in the stories of those who studied the art of flying with him, in short and, at the same time, comprehensive lines of the government decree on naming the club after him. A rally took place. With bated breath, the athletes listened to the excited words of the mother of the Hero, Varvara Feodorovna: improve your knowledge, study military affairs, be worthy successors to the work of your fathers and older brothers, sacredly honor those who died for the Fatherland, take care of the Motherland.\n\nIn the mouth of the mother, these words sounded like a call. And every word was remembered, sunk into the heart. They, these words, are in the thoughts of athletes, in their deeds ...\n\n* * *\n\nList of famous victories of the Guard Captain V.I.
