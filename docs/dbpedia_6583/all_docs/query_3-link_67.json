        "text": "ASAPA members - Remember to vote before June 1st! A representative to the AAPA House of Delegates (HOD) is responsible for being the voice of our state and profession. For the past six years, I have had the honor of serving as a representative for Arizona and as chief delegate over the past year. I have been introduced to the challenges our profession faces while serving as the ASAPA president-elect and now as president of our state association. I have worked closely with our amazing Legal and Legislative Affairs committee to push for PA practice modernization in Arizona and on the national level. I am a third-generation native of Arizona, and I had the great fortune of attending the PA program at AT Still University in Mesa. After graduation over 15 years ago, I began my practice in emergency medicine. After four years, I worked overseas in austere environments and loved the cultural enrichment that came with my experiences. After half a decade of bouncing around the globe, I found myself back in my hometown, educating future PAs and continuing to work in emergency medicine. I received my doctorate in leadership in 2021, which extended my future in this profession. Giving back on all levels is essential. I volunteer in multiple international clinics, but my main focus is providing monthly clinics in a rural part of Mexico. I believe in helping others and learning from each culture that touches my life. As your representative, my duty is to continue to be the voice of our diverse Arizona-based PAs and facilitate the flow of information. We have more to do, and the changes being considered now will significantly affect our future practice. I hope you will allow me to continue representing PAs in Arizona alongside our four other House of Delegates representatives."
