        "text": "“No guilt in life, no fear in death”\n\nThese lines are from the fourth verse of “In Christ Alone.” This contemporary hymn expresses hope in the love, death, and power of Christ. Written by Keith Getty and Stuart Townend in 2001, the song quickly became internationally popular. At my Christian university, it was a campus favorite, and we sang it often in chapel services. It’s Irish-sounding melody and expressive lyrics have made it one of my personal favorites as well. Easter comes this weekend, and this song beautifully sketches the story of Christ’s death and resurrection. I want to use the lyrics of this song to explore why we celebrate.\n\nIn the song’s second verse, Townend’s lyrics express how Jesus “took on flesh.” The Son of God—who is one with God the Father—became human so that He could reconcile humankind’s broken relationship with God. Through sin we became enemies of God, but through Jesus’ death on the cross, “the wrath of God was satisfied; for every sin on Him was laid.” Jesus sacrificially died by crucifixion to atone for every sin and restore humankind’s relationship with God the Father.\n\nBut the story doesn’t end with His death. Verse three exclaims, “Then bursting forth in glorious day, up from the grave He rose again!” The Bible tells how Jesus lay dead in the grave until the third day after His crucifixion. On that day, angels came and rolled the great stone away from in front of the tomb and sat on it, revealing only strips of linen burial cloths inside. To Jesus’ bewildered followers who came to look for His body, they said “He is not here; He has risen!” (For a full account of these events, see Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, and John 20.)\n\nIn a triumphant crescendo, Townend’s lyrics continue, “And as He stands in victory, sin’s curse has lost its grip on me.” Victorious over death, Jesus appeared to many of His disciples and gave them instructions before finally returning to heaven to wait for the right time to return to earth again. What His death and resurrection accomplished was to free us from the burden of sin. Anyone who trusts that Jesus’ sacrifice was enough to atone for their sins can regain a loving relationship with God and be assured of being with Him for eternity, no matter what happens here on earth.\n\nBut my favorite line comes from verse four: “No guilt in life, no fear in death—this is the pow’r of Christ in me.” I know I haven’t yet fully realized what it means to truly live without guilt or fear—I probably won’t until I’m spending eternity with Jesus. But yet it’s true! The power of Christ has already nullified them both. Isn’t it glorious?\n\nI wrote last week about the fear of death—about how risk management is difficult in a world that seems fraught with danger. But because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, death is not fearsome. Any who trust in His sacrifice will live eternally after their current mortal bodies die, and the future will be what C.S. Lewis describes as “the beginning of the real story” and coming “home at last” (The Chronicles of Narnia: The Last Battle).\n\nBut even more amazing to me is the freedom from guilt. I’m convinced that guilt is one of the worst feelings a human has to endure. We all feel shame sometimes, which can actually help us grow and make better choices. But the true power of being guilty was destroyed by Christ’s death on the cross. Sin—the continual state of disappointing God and being unable to live up to His standards—has “lost its grip.” In God’s eyes, I am no longer guilty because Christ has taken all my guilt on Himself, and I no longer need to carry it. I finally have the ability to follow Christ and please God without the burden of sin and guilt.\n\nAt Easter, we celebrate Jesus’ death and resurrection because without it, “we are of all people most to be pitied” (1 Corinthians 15:19). Christ is the focus of the Christian’s hope. Because of His love, life, death, and resurrection, we can confidently sing,\n\nNo pow’r of hell, no scheme of man,\n\nCan ever pluck me from His hand;\n\nTill He returns or calls me home—\n\nHere in the pow’r of Christ I’ll stand.\n\nLyrics from “In Christ Alone,” Stuart Townend & Keith Getty, 2001.
