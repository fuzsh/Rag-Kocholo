He was named to the IHL second team All-Star team in 1905. In 1902 and 1903, he had played on the Stanley Cup winning team, the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association Club. He won the Stanley Cup 2 more times with the Montreal Wanderers in 1909 and 1910. He then coached the Montreal Canadiens of the NHA for two seasons and officiated for several years.

Born in Berlin (Kitchener) Ontario, Gibson was a graduate of the Detroit Medical School of Dentistry. Doc is in the Hockey Hall of Fame. He was a fine player of all sports in Canada before arriving in Houghton. Although he had been banned from playing hockey because he and other team members had each accepted a $10 gold piece tossed to them by a fan after they had just won an important game. At the time, hockey was an amateur sport in Canada; any form of payment would result in a lifetime suspension for a Canadian player. Doc Gibson is pictured here on the 1904 Portage Lake Team, the World's First Pro Hockey Team.\n\nA young reporter, Merv Youngs, saw news clippings in Doc Gibson's Houghton office about Doc's hockey experience in Canada; he wrote articles in the local paper about Doc's hockey playing in Canada. Merv, who later became editor of this newspaper, the Houghton Mining Gazette, along with other community members, prevailed upon Doc to join and organize the Portage Lake hockey organization. The new hockey team, with support from local businessman, James R. Dee, was built around Gibson as captain. It was called the Portage Lakes. Their fame reached into Canada and soon they had gained recognition for the roughest, toughest hockey in the world. In 1903 a four-team league flourished in the Upper Peninsula (Houghton, Hancock, Laurium, and American Soo). Then, in 1903-04, Canadian players began drifting into the Cooper Country to play for the Portage Lakes, including such greats as goalie William \"Riley\" Hern (4 time Stanley Cup winner), Hod and Bruce Stuart (3 time Stanley Cup winner) and Fred \"Cyclone\" Taylor. Gibson was instrumental in forming these players into the first professional league in the world, the International Hockey League, of which Portage Lake was a member. Gibson was the teams leading scorer, although there is no record of his exact number of goals. \"The 1903-04 the Portage Lake team was perhaps one of the greatest hockey teams of all times.\" In 26 games they scored 273 goals and allowed only 48. Only twice were they defeated - by American Soo, 7-6, in the regular season, and by Pittsburg, 5-2, in U.S. playoffs. Then the Lakes beat Pittsburg, 5-1 and 7-0, for the American Championship. Later, in Houghton with over 5,000 fans packed into the Old Amphidrome, Portage Lake defeated the Montreal Wanderers, 8-4 and 9-2, to lay claim to the World Championship. Other teams which bowed to the Portage Lakes were St. Paul, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Cleveland, St. Louis and the Canadian Soo. In the spring of 1905 Portage Lake sent word to the Stanley Cup committee Board of Governors challenging the Ottawa Silver Seven to a championship series, and in 1906 they did the same to Montreal. Both refused. It was then that the Canadian clubs signed away the great Portage Lake Players. Gibson also returned to Canada to play hockey and opened his Dentist practice in Calgary, Alberta where he resided until his death in 1955. A news article in the local Calumet News date 26 Feb 1916 reports that \"\"Doc\" John L. McD Gibson, the founder of the Portage Lake hockey team, will leave Canada next week or early in March for the battlefields in Europe. Dr. Gibson is a Captain in the Eighty-Second Overseas battalion in Calgary, Alverta, and has been training with his company for the past two months. Their course of training ... gave him an opportunity to indulge in bomb-throwing contests... he was awarded the Duke of Connaught Gold Medal for the best throw in the Dominion\". Gibson is then quoted in the article citing from a long letter he had written to a friend here in Houghton: Gibson writes \"all his friends are in khaki [uniform] ... the battalions are lawyers, doctors, crooks, bums etc.... conscription will never be needed in Canada...\" Gibson was elected as a Builder to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1976 and inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame in 1973 and the UP Sports Hall of Fame in 1972.\n\nJohn Maurice Gipp, (1933-95) was born in nearby Ahmeek, Michigan. He played hockey on local CLK hockey teams and was an All-State football player at Calumet High School. \"Morgan\" as he was nick-named, played local baseball and was the catcher for B. O. Brunet from nearby New Alouez, who went on to pitch in the major leagues. Gipp received a scholarship to play hockey for Michigan State University 1952-55. He played wing on the first line with local Weldy Olson (Olympic Hockey Gold Medalist) and was coached by Amo Bessone. Like his cousin George, John Gipp was known as the \"Gipper\" throughout his lifetime.\n\n1953-54\n\nMichigan State University\n\nlocals: #7 John Gipp,\n\n#13 Karl Jackson, #14 Weldon Olson, #15 Buck Nystrom,\n\nRob Roy -mgr.\n\nRobert Gitzen, (19--to 50) a Houghton native, played hockey for Michigan Tech 1949-50. He and team manager Dick Loutit, were killed in a bus accident while the team was traveling home from a game series at Michigan State on January 14, 1950. An annual award since the 1957-58 season, the Gitzen-Loutit Memorial Hockey Award, is presented each year to Michigan Tech's most outstanding hockey defenseman in their honor.\n\nRobert Gitzen\n\nChris Givens, born 1967 in Hancock, was a 4 year varsity hockey letter winner for the Hancock Bulldogs where he has a Lake Superior Hockey Conference record with 72 career assists 1981-85, and is still the 3rd leading scorer in Hancock hockey history. He played in the 1985 Michigan High School Senior All-Star hockey game at the Yost Arena in Ann Arbor and was selected to Team Michigan for the 1985 National High School Senior Tournament in Franklin Park, Ill. Chris finished his high school career with 180 points. Chris was also a standout football player for 4 years at Hancock: winning All U.P, All Conference, All State and Michigan HS All Star game honors, averaging over 40 yards per punt all 4 years. Chris was awarded a full football scholarship at Central Michigan University. He went on to join the hockey coaching staff of Traverse City High School as the assistant hockey coach in 1992; Chris has been the Head Hockey Coach for the Traverse City Central High School since 1995. He has been the all time winningest coach in school history; surpassing the 150 win mark in 2006. He has led his teams to five conference championships, one district championship, two regional championships, and one state championship. His team broke the school record for wins in a season with 19 in 2003 and again in 2006 with 26 wins when they won the Division II High School State Championship.\n\nChris Givens\n\nChris has twice been named Hockey Coach of the Year: in 2004 by the Great Northern Hockey Conf. when his team won the Conference Championship, and in 2006 by MHSAA, after his team won the Division II State Championship.\n\nMike Gorman, born 19-- in -- a Houghton native, played hockey for Michigan Tech 1964-67. need more info and picture here.

We won the championship that year.\" At 6'1\", 155 pounds, Gresnick, played defense in minor pro hockey 2 years with the Washington Lions AHL (1941-42) he played one year with the Baltimore Rovers of the Eastern Amateur League and later Washington U-Lines of the American League, when working in Detroit, he played with the Windsor Eagles. After the war, he played for the Marquette Millionaires; where he played with Ching Johnson who went on to play with the New York Rangers. Johnson got him signed on with the Washington team. A local team mate of his said in an interview: \"Gresnick was sometimes a showboat when playing before large crowds in Marquette. At least once a night in Marquette, hed make a solo dash down the ice, and if he scored, hed flip his stick up into the lights and catch it, Owen OBrien said. The people would like that. Gresnick ended his playing career with the 1950-1951 season, after helping the Calumet Radars win the Gibson and MacNaughton Cup that year.\n\nNate Grisolono, born 19-- in --, a player from the Calumet Jr hockey league, plays for Finlandia University...\n\nBen Gullstand, born 1979 in Shakopee, MN; played hockey for Houghton High School then played 2 seasons 1998-00 for St. Louis in the NAHL.
