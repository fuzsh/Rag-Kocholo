        "text": "The abhorrent acts committed by the globally recognized terrorist organization Hamas on the citizens of Israel are reprehensible. The blatant disregard for humanity and the destruction they have inflicted on our homeland and its people is heartbreaking. These atrocities have absolutely devastated our communities and many others around the world.\n\nWhile Hamas may be working to create division amongst inhabitants of our homeland and throughout the globe, it is now more important than ever to stay unified as one. We would like to offer a place on our webpage for individuals in our community to share their messages of condolence to those who have been lost, their thoughts and prayers to all those who have been impacted, and their prayers of safety to those who are fighting for the security of Israel and its children\n\nPlease consider performing a Mitzvah in memory of those who have fallen."
