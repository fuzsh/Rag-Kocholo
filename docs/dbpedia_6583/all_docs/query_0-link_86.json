        "text": "JOHNSTON, Margaret Sinclair\n\n(Stockman) 'Maggie' (nee Young)\n\nMaggie died peacefully in her sleep on Monday, November 7 in her 101st year. Beloved wife of the late James Stuart Johnston and of the late Ernest Oswald 'Stocky' Stockman who gave his life on the destroyer Athabaskan during WWII. Loving mother of Roger Stockman and step daughters Anne and Barbara and adoring grandmother of Robert, Catherine, Stuart and Andrea and great-grandmother of Simon. She was predeceased by her mother Maude Marie Fick, her father Charles Robert Young and her brother Arnold Robert Young. Maggie attended Oakwood Collegiate, Havergal, Bishop Strachan School and University of Toronto where she earned her ATCM and LTCM from the Royal Conservatory of Music. She enjoyed membership in The Garden Club, The Ladies Club, The York Club, Caledon Ski Club and, after her twenty year dedication as Manager of the Junior League opportunity Shop, was awarded the distinction of becoming the first honourary life member of the Junior League. She was an avid skier and her summers were enriched in cottage country at Bobcaygeon on the Trent Severn, and, at Copperhead, Go Home and Point au Baril on Georgian Bay. Her love of music, theatre, gardening and travel and her insatiable interest in all things knew no bounds. She will be missed by all of those whose lives she touched. We would like to thank all the Belmont House staff, the Eldercare staff and her caregivers Joan, Reca, Eura, Aurora, Norma, Betsy and their predecessors for all their generosity of care. A private family burial was held at Mt. Pleasant Cemetery. A memorial gathering will be held at the MORLEY BEDFORD FUNERAL HOME, 159 Eglinton Ave. W. (2 stop lights west of Yonge St.) on Wednesday November 23rd from 2-5 p.m. In lieu of flowers you may make a donation to The Belmont House Foundation."
