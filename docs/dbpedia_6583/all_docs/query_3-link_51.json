        "text": "The School has received the news of the death of Ian James Shaw OBE CMG BSc(NZ) PhD (Camb). Dr Shaw was born in Masterton and was at School from 1932 ‘ 1937. He took a full part in the life of the School, playing rugby and tennis as well as being in the rifle club and acting as a lab boy. He was a prefect in 1937.\n\nIan Shaw had a fine academic career here being in top classes throughout. Passing the University Entrance examination (form 5A) in 1934 with the creditable mark of 299, he was bettered only by John Stacpoole with a mark of 301. In 1937 Ian was dux, (the year before Ted Bollard) and in the same year he was a University Entrance Scholar.\n\nOn completing a BSc at Auckland University College he joined the RNZAF and left in June 1941 on the merchant ship SS Raingitane which was sunk by a German armed raider and he spent five years in various prisoner-of-war camps including the notorious Stalagluft III.\n\nAt the end of hostilities he obtained a research post at Cambridge’s famous Cavendish Laboratory. Ian worked in the radio section under JA Ratcliff and he studies the Luxembourg Effect in ionospheric propagation for his doctorate. During this time he met another research student, Audrey Spalding (a Newnham College graduate) and they were married in 1949.\n\nDr Shaw became a civil servant at the Ministry of Defense. In the 1950s he was among the observers to see the first British atomic bomb go off at Woomera n the Australian dessert.\n\nAlso, during the early part of his career, he was sent to Kenya during the Mau Mau troubles to find out why the British troops were having such difficulties with their radio communications. He discovered, for example, one senior army officer with his men camped in a valley. Asked why they were not on the surrounding hillside, he was told ‘The fishing is no good up there, old boy.’\n\nLater in his career he spent some time in trips to Europe for various NATO conferences. He worked for the then Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Solly Zuckerman and later for Sir Hermann Bondi. During this time his duties sometimes involved him in preparing information for Lord Healey.\n\nHe was finally in charge of an army research establishment at Byfleet in Surrey. While there he unfortunately suffered a major stroke at the age of sixty. After his retirement, Dr Shaw continued to do gardening and other hobbies such as woodwork, although badly disabled on his right side. Friends and neighbours were impressed by his determination not to give in.\n\nHe was awarded an OBE in 1965 and a CMB in 1977. He died on 25 March 2004 in Wonersh, Surrey, England.\n\nThe School and the Albertians Association extend their condolences to his widow Audrey, his sons, Duncan and Malcolm and his grandson Callum.\n\nBrian Murphy, Archivist\n\nFrom an obituary by his widow, Audrey\n\nAt MAGS was in the A form and an outstanding athlete, representing the school in Swimming and Athletics. He went to Victoria University where he completed a BA Honours programme and graduated with a PhD in Philosophy (1973). He then went to the USA and completed a law degree (JD) at the University of Michigan (1978). He practised law and taught at universities in the States, before being appointed to the prestigious New York Law School in 1991, where he gained a full Professorship. He retired at the close of 2011 and was awarded the title of Emeritus Professor at the New York Law School.\n\nHe has also published a number of books (his most recent volume is entitled Traditional Tools of Statutory Interpretation, published 2013), and numerous scholarly articles. He is a highly influential legal academic. He resides in Michigan, USA."
