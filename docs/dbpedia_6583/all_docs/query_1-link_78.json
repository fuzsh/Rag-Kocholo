        "text": "If I asked you, \"Do you know Stuart Hamblin?,\" you might pause for a few seconds. If I added that he had a \"star\" on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, placed there in 1978, then you might say, \"Yes, Carl \"Stuart\" Hamblen, radio personality, songwriter, cowboy singer and motion picture actor. And you would be right.\n\nHamblen was born into the family of a traveling Methodist preacher on Oct. 20, 1908, in Kelleyville, Texas. In later years, after going to Hollywood, he appeared in 10 movies with such stars as Roy Rogers, Gene Autry and John Wayne. He was also a singer and songwriter with his own radio show.\n\nMany of Hamblen's 225 songs were recorded by scores of artists, not the least of which were Eddy Arnold, Pat Boone, Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley. His song, \"This Old House,\" recorded by Rosemary Clooney, was named Song of the Year in 1954 and was the No. 1 hit song in seven countries at the same time.\n\nIn 1949, when Billy Graham was in Los Angeles for evangelist meetings under \"The Big Tent,\" Hamblen's wife persuaded him to attend one of the services. Early the following morning he requested an appointment with Graham - which was granted - and during their conversation Hamblen surrendered his life to be a follower of Christ.\n\nHamblen tells the story behind one of his songs:\n\n\"I wrote the song one night, shortly after midnight. My wife and I had been visiting one of Hollywood's most famous movie stars. We had gone over to his home just to fill him in on some of the things that had happened in his recent absence.\"\n\n\"Somehow the discussion got around to how people can solve problems within themselves. I remember making a statement such as, 'It's no secret what God can do in a man's life.' About two hours later, as we were about to leave the actor's home he said, 'Stuart you ought to write a song about it is no secret what God can do. That is a beautiful thought.'\"\n\n\"As we walked across the lawn, back to our house, I began to think about it. When we arrived at home I walked into the living room and sat down at the organ.\n\nOur hall clock began to \"chime\" the hour of midnight. I grabbed a pen and started writing, 'The chimes of time ring out the news, another day is through' and on and on until the song was finished. I then turned and glanced at the hall clock. It was only 17 minutes after midnight. I couldn't believe it. I had never been able to write any musical composition in less than three or four hours. I thought the clock had stopped. I then looked and saw the big pendulum still swinging.\"\n\nHamblen's song has been heard in every small city, town and hamlet in America and in countless places around the world - in more than 50 languages. Stuart's neighbor, who made the suggestion about writing the song, was John Wayne. You better believe it, pardner!\n\n\"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\" - 1 Corinthians 2:9"
