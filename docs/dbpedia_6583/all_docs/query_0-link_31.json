        "text": "Introduction\n\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia worldwide and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.[1,2] The main cause of increased mortality associated with AF is the risk for thromboembolic stroke, which can be substantially reduced by appropriate stroke prevention therapy with systemic anticoagulation.[3,4]\n\nPatients with AF are diagnosed in many clinical situations, ranging from asymptomatic AF discovered during a routine clinical evaluation, to symptomatic AF presenting at an outpatient facility or an emergency room (ER). The ER is a common place to present, making the ER a prime location to focus efforts that can intervene in the course of illness. According to Canadian and International Guidelines, among patients for whom AF is the primary reason for the ER visit, the majority do not require hospital admission, and can safely be discharged from the ER to their place of residence.[5-7] Recent studies indicate that 70-85% of such patients can be safely discharged, however discharge rates vary widely.[8] In the province of Ontario (population of 13 million),[9] between 2002 and 2010 there were approximately 20,000 visits per year to an ER with a primary diagnosis of AF, representing almost 16,000 individual patients. The province-wide discharge rate was approximately 60%.[10]\n\nSome studies suggest that these patients may receive incomplete, inconsistent, or fragmented care in follow-up, and that the proportion of these patients receiving evidence-based stroke prevention treatment on discharge from the ER is undesirably low.[11] Furthermore, there are rarely standardized transition of care systems that ensure timely and appropriate follow-up care following ER discharge, as well as standardized patient information and instructions.\n\nThe main purpose of the AFTER3 Study was to evaluate and verify feasibility of a comprehensive program of outpatient care for patients with AF as their primary ER diagnosis, consisting of a care pathway and patient toolkit. Secondary outcomes include guideline-indicated oral anticoagulant use and quality of life measures at AF clinic follow-up and at 3 months. We hypothesize that this comprehensive program will be feasible and provide optimal outpatient care for patients with AF identified in the ER.\n\nResults\n\nDuring the study period from March 29, 2012 to August 23, 2013, a total of 321 patients presented to the ER with AF. Twenty-four percent were admitted to hospital. Of the discharged patients, 166 (68%) were referred to the AF clinic; 144 (87%) of those were seen in the AF clinic, and 128 (89%) patients were recruited into the AFTER3 study ( ).\n\nBaseline ER characteristics of enrolled patients are shown in . The mean patient age was 63.6±13.2 years old (males 59%). The most common presenting ER symptom was palpitations (70%), with most symptoms starting within the previous 48 hours (71%). Fifty-six percent had a prior history of AF. The initial documented rhythm was atrial fibrillation in 78% and atrial flutter in 16% of cases. Sinus rhythm was present on the initial ECG in 6% of cases. The initial mean ventricular rate was 123.9±35.5 bpm. With respect to stroke risk, 31% had a CHADS2 score ≥ 2 and 56% had a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2. Among the 23 patients presenting to the ER with prior known AF and a CHADS2 score ≥ 2, nine (39%) were on an oral anticoagulant; only five (46%) of the 11 patients with AF and on warfarin had an INR in therapeutic range (2.0-3.0) ( - ).\n\nTable 1\n\nDemographicsN=128Age, years (mean ± SD)63.6 ± 13.2ER SymptomsChest Pain – no (%)25 (20%)Dyspnea – no (%)48 (38%)Fatigue/Effort Tolerance – no (%)26 (20%)Palpitations – no (%)90 (70%)Syncope/Presyncope – no (%)27 (21%)Past Medical History – no (%)Known AF/Atrial Flutter (prior to current ER visit)72 (56%)Heart Failure4 (3%)Hypertension59 (46%)Diabetes Mellitus22 (17%)Stroke/TIA 10 (8%)CAD15 (12%)Significant valvular heart disease3 (2%)Valve surgery2 (2%)Myocardial Infarction6 (5%)Left ventricular systolic dysfunction2 (2%)CABG / PCI12 (9%)Prior major bleeding1 (1%)Substance abuse including ETOH and street drugs 8 (6%)Initial ECG in ER - Type – no (%)AF100 (78%)Atrial Flutter20 (16%)Sinus Rhythm*8 (6%)Final ECG in ER - Type – no (%)N=96†AF33 (34%)Atrial Flutter5 (5%)Sinus Rhythm58 (60%)CHADS2 – no.

Overall, 56 (58%) and 37 (39%) patients were prescribed beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, respectively, at discharge. Eighty-one percent received a patient toolkit when they were discharged from the ER.\n\nAmong the 78 (32%) patients seen in the ER with AF who were not referred to the AF clinic, 62 (79%) were asked to follow-up with their family physician or cardiologist, while 16 (21%) had no specific follow-up documented. Characteristics between patients not referred and those referred to the AF clinic appeared to be similar. Patients with no specific follow-up or specialist referral were less likely to be seen by a cardiologist or arrhythmia specialist (67%), compared to those referred to the AF clinic (87%). The median time from the ER visit to follow-up with their cardiologist was 33.0 days (IQR 18.5-134.5).\n\nThe characteristics of enrolled patients seen during their AF clinic visit are shown in . The median time from ER visit to AF clinic visit was 10.5 (IQR 5.5-18) days, with the majority of patients seen primarily by the nurse practitioner in conjunction with a cardiologist (81%). This was the first ER presentation of AF in 44% of patients. The mean Severity of Atrial Fibrillation (SAF) class[17,18] was 1.8±1.0. At the time of their first clinic visit, 61% of patients were in sinus rhythm. Three-quarters of all patients seen in the AF clinic were not currently receiving oral anticoagulation therapy ( ). Oral anticoagulation therapy was newly prescribed or recommended in 30% and 27% of patients, respectively. When anticoagulation therapy was recommended in the AF clinic, only 54% of patients were actually started on an oral anticoagulant by their family physician or cardiologist at 3 months. In patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc≥2 seen in AF clinic, 66% were not currently taking an oral anticoagulant. Of these patients, oral anticoagulation was newly prescribed in 43% and recommended in 43% of patients. In the remaining 13% (n=6), no anticoagulation was prescribed for various reasons ( ). When anticoagulation therapy was recommended in the AF clinic, only 55% of patients were actually started on an oral anticoagulant by their family physician or cardiologist at 3 months.\n\nResults of patient questionnaires regarding AF knowledge, attitudes and quality of life are summarized in . Over 80% of patients were aware of their diagnosis (87%), increased stroke risk (82%) and possible complications (90%). Most patients were aware that AF could affect quality of life (95%) and that treatment could improve symptoms (86%). There was a significant and moderately large improvement in AFEQT scores[14], from baseline values of 56.4±25.5 to 76.4±20.0 at 3 months (p<0.0001).\n\nTable 3\n\nAFEQT Overall ScoresBaseline - mean±SD, range (N=103)56.4±25.5 (7.4 – 100) 3 Months - mean±SD, range (N=103)76.4±20.0 (20.4 – 100) Overall ∆ AFEQT Score20.0±22.9 (-45.4 – 69.4)*\n\nAt 3 months after the initial AF clinic visit, follow-up data was obtained in 101 patients (79%). Three patients dropped out of the study, 2 patients died and we were unable to contact 22 patients. Only 62% of patients had seen their family physician since their AF clinic visit and 15% had a repeat visit to the ER for AF. Overall, 93% were satisfied or very satisfied with their understanding of AF and 93% were aware that AF can increase stroke risk.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study we found that a systematic program to improve transitions of care from the ER to outpatient community care was associated with prompt, guideline-based care, and substantial patient satisfaction. The predominantly nurse-practitioner-led AF clinic resulted in high oral anticoagulant use in guideline-indicated patients, and patients reported improved quality of life at 3 months, compared to the baseline AF clinic visit. The study also demonstrated the feasibility of a process to organize a systematic and rapid “turn-around” referral to a dedicated AF service following ER discharge.\n\nIn many clinical settings, particularly after emergency care, a systematic, protocol driven, pattern of care which includes patient education, organized and structured follow-up, and rapid access to expert care, results in improved outcomes compared to “usual care”.[19] In the intermediate term, for example, a systematic protocol-driven pattern of care delivered by nurse practitioners was superior to “usual care” delivered by specialist cardiologists, in a randomized controlled trial in the Netherlands.[20] In other studies, follow-up with a cardiologist or specialist was associated with a decreased odds of making a return ER visit and follow-up with a family physician decreased the risk of death.[11,21] This highlights the importance of having a systematic process to ensure adequate and timely follow-up.\n\nA high proportion of patients presenting to the ER have inadequate or absent guideline-indicated stroke prevention therapies despite a prior diagnosis of AF.[22] Similar findings have been shown in studies of patients with prior known AF, and in patients presenting with stroke.[23] In our study, a high proportion of patients with guideline-indication for anticoagulation for stroke prevention were discharged from the ER on inadequate stroke prevention. There may be several potential explanations for this finding. First, since patients were being referred and promptly seen in the AF clinic, the decision of whether anticoagulation should be started and the most appropriate anticoagulant to use may have been left up to the specialist physicians in the AF clinic as the interim stroke risk is perceived to be low. Second, it may be possible that ER physicians are concerned about starting an anticoagulant in patients in whom follow-up cannot be certain, and who may therefore be at risk of bleeding and relatively unsupervised in the early period following hospital discharge. It is also possible that there may be physician knowledge gaps in stroke risk stratification and therapy.\n\nIn this study we also found a low rate of warfarin prescription by family physicians following an explicit recommendation from the AF clinic to start therapy with warfarin. This barrier was not present when the anticoagulation was started in the AF clinic, usually with a direct acting oral anticoagulant. Warfarin was not always started directly in the AF clinic due to concern about incomplete early follow-up without an opportunity for early follow-up of INRs in the community. It is not clear why there was a low rate of warfarin prescription by family physicians, but possible reasons include that they never received the AF clinic recommendations, patients did not see family physicians within the study period or there was “therapeutic inertia” with respect to treatment recommendation. Regardless of the reason, in order to minimize this from occurring, it seems reasonable that patients should be directly given a prescription at the time of the AF clinic encounter.\n\nDistribution of a patient “toolkit”, including educational pamphlets on AF, stroke and stroke prevention, treatment options and letters to family physicians at the time of ER discharge was found to be feasible and resulted in excellent patient satisfaction and adequate patient knowledge about AF and its potential consequences. This contrasts with studies suggesting a lack of patient awareness of stroke risks and details of their illness in most patients with AF.[24] Even though 41% of patients had AF prior to the index ER visit, and thus presumably had a prior opportunity to be educated about the illness, the systematic process was associated with a clinically important improvement in quality of life. It is reasonable to ascribe this improvement, at least in part, to the patient toolkit and information, as well as the prompt follow-up and in-person education and treatment provided in the AF clinic.\n\nThere was somewhat inconsistent and incomplete referral of all eligible patients from the ER, possibly due to physicians forgetting, being too busy to complete the referral process or difficulty in identifying the most efficient process for referring patients to the AF clinic. We tested several strategies, including an ER physician completed checklist which was hand delivered, mailed or faxed to the AF clinic; pre-scheduled appointments in a dedicated appointment book which were both given to patients and collected by the AF clinic; and an electronic email/fax based-referral system. In our study, the most effective referral method was a combination of pre-scheduled appointments given to patients and an electronic-based referral system, which resulted in an increased proportion of referrals for patients presenting to the ER with AF. The attrition at all steps in the process, including incomplete referral, patients declining to be seen in the clinic, and a small, non-participation rate all remain important barriers to the wide scale adoption of this program. It is our belief that the most effective and least disruptive referral will need to be decided after discussion between the ER physicians and the referral destination, adapting the process to local needs and resources.\n\nThe principal limitation of the current study is its observational nature and it is unclear if “conventional” treatment such as specialist referral would have led to similar improvements in guideline-based therapies and patient satisfaction. Although the best way to study this AF clinic intervention would have been via a randomized trial, this study does highlight the significant gaps in “real-world” practice care and that significant improvements can be achieved through systematic referral to an AF clinic. This was also a single-centre study at an urban academic institution, so generalizability of results to other settings is unknown."
