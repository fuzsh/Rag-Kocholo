        "text": "‚è∞.. PSA: You cannot make new OLD FRIENDS!!!! Roger Kechawah and I have been friends for close to a century ago‚Ä¶ We started primary school together. We became friends even before we knew the meaning of the word üßÆ.. For nineteen (19) straight years we were either in the same class, one classroom away from each other, or roommates. We were fierce academic rivals and yet great friends all along the way. Guess who used to be, and still is the more sociable guy? Not me of course! üë®üè´.. We both became teachers in Cameroon on the same day. In 2013 when I had to move to the USA, Roger's sister predicted Roger would be joining me soon! Two years later, we were both in the USAü•Çü•Çü•Ç A little more about my dear (old) friend‚Ä¶ 1Ô∏è‚É£..Roger was a little more economically disadvantaged than I was and his academic pursuits almost ended prematurely. Thanks to a tacit melange of #GRIT & #serendipity, my #friend has earned more degrees than a thermometerüòé. Dr Roger Kechawah Mbianda - I‚Äôm proud of you! 2Ô∏è‚É£.. Roger joined the US Army as a Horizontal Engineer (far from his kind of thing), then smartly moved to Military Intelligence (his initial target job)ü•Ç 3Ô∏è‚É£.. How can one man be comfortable in everything he does? Roger is now a Scrum Master and a Licensed Financial Professional 4Ô∏è‚É£.. Icing on the cake - Roger is a poet and a book author. Here is a link to his most recent book - UNEARTHED TRIUMPHS: Navigating Through Life‚Äôs Hidden Challenges, https://lnkd.in/gq-5gR6c You cannot make new OLD FRIENDS! ü§©.. Roger Kechawah is one of the people I need not preface any conversation with, we just get started. If you ever hear us talk, eavesdrop at your own risk‚Ä¶ üì∏.. A random video call - we realized we were wearing the same sweater‚Ä¶. Maybe we‚Äôre actually (good old) #friends üëåüèæ.. Which (old) friend are you celebrating today? Tag them and if you feel like it, tell us more! #Gratitude #Friendship #GrowthMindSet"
