        "text": "LOOK: Harrowing of Hell by Kateryna Shadrina\n\nThis contemporary icon of the Resurrection shows Christ standing atop the gates of hell—which have fallen into the shape of a cross—redeeming Adam and Eve while flames whip all around. In the sudden rush of rescue, his cloak billows behind him. His mandorla—that is, the radiant oval that frames him—is traditionally gold, but here the artist has chosen a deep royal blue, symbolic of heaven, and jade green for healing, renewal, and prosperity. The black oval in the upper right may signify the mouth of the empty tomb, or the portal through which Christ will return with the newly liberated to the realms above.\n\nLISTEN: “Welcome, Happy Morning!” | Original Latin words by Venantius Fortunatus, 6th century; English translation by John Ellerton, 19th century | Music: NOEL NOUVELET (traditional French tune), 15th century | Performed by the Green Carpet Players (musicians of Redeemer Church of Knoxville), feat. Tyler Anthony, on Rise, O Buried Lord, 2011\n\n“Welcome, happy morning!”\n\nage to age shall say:\n\nhell today is vanquished,\n\nheav’n is won today.\n\nLo! the dead is living,\n\nGod forevermore!\n\nHim, their true Creator,\n\nall his works adore.\n\n“Welcome, happy morning!”\n\nage to age shall say:\n\nhell today is vanquished,\n\nheav’n is won today.\n\nMaker and Redeemer,\n\nlife and health of all,\n\nthou, from heav’n beholding\n\nhuman nature’s fall,\n\nof the Father’s Godhead\n\ntrue and only Son,\n\nmanhood to deliver,\n\nmanhood didst put on.\n\nThou, of life the author,\n\ndeath didst undergo,\n\ntread the path of darkness,\n\nsaving strength to show.\n\nCome then, True and Faithful,\n\nnow fulfill thy word;\n\n’tis thine own third morning:\n\nrise, O buried Lord!\n\nLoose the souls long prisoned,\n\nbound with Satan’s chain;\n\nthine that now are fallen\n\nraise to life again;\n\nshow thy face in brightness,\n\nbid the nations see;\n\nbring again our daylight;\n\nday returns with thee.\n\nI like how this hymn—whose origins are in the sixth century!—integrates the Incarnation into the story of Easter, enfolding together Jesus’s birth, life, death, and resurrection as well as his second coming.\n\nTo deliver humanity from the thrall of sin and death, the second person of the Trinity put on human flesh. He lived faithfully and died a sacrificial death. And then this God-Man came back to life! Now all the created world praises his name. The hymn ends with a prayer to see resurrection life in our world and for Christ’s return. “True and Faithful” in the third stanza are epithets of Jesus, the white-horse rider, in Revelation 19:11.\n\nThe musicians of Redeemer Church of Knoxville have paired the early medieval text with the fifteenth-century French carol tune NOEL NOUVELET, which is more commonly used with “Sing We Now of Christmas” and “Now the Green Blade Riseth” but works equally well here. The group brings a raucous energy and sings at a quickened tempo, using xylophones, mandolins, and trumpets in their celebration of the Risen Christ.\n\nThis song and many others can be found on my Eastertide playlist.\n\nDuring the Easter Octave (the first eight days of the fifty-day season of Easter), I will continue publishing short daily posts in this art-and-song format.\n\nLOOK: Myrrhbearers by Kateryna Kuziv\n\nLISTEN: “The Women Prepare the Spices (Song of Songs 8)” by Katy Wehr, a setting of Song of Songs 8:6–7, 13–14, on And All the Marys (2018)\n\nO set me as a seal upon thy heart\n\nO set me as a seal upon thine arm\n\nFor love is strong, strong as death, my love\n\nAnd jealousy is cruel as the grave\n\nIts flashes are the living flame of a blazing fire\n\nThat cannot be drowned out in a flood\n\nAll earthly gold in exchange for love\n\nWould be utterly contemptible and scorned\n\nCome, my love\n\nLet me hear your voice\n\nMy companions and I wait in the garden\n\nMake haste, my love, and shine out like the rising sun\n\nLike a stag appearing on the mountain\n\nAfter the crucifixion of Jesus, a small group of his female followers purchased spices and prepared them to bring to the tomb to anoint his body on Sunday morning. (Sabbath restrictions prevented them from doing work on Saturday.) This was an act of love and reverence that served the practical function of counteracting the smell of decomposition.\n\nThe singer-songwriter Katy Wehr [previously] imagines the women consoling each other by singing excerpts from the Song of Songs as they crushed the myrrh, mixed it with oil, and bottled it up for transport—maybe also as they headed over to the gravesite. Wehr has set to music four of the verses from the book’s final chapter, a setting she says she hopes conveys a tone that is both mournful and hopeful.\n\nThe Song of Songs, or Song of Solomon, is an ancient collection of Hebrew love poems that Christians have long read as allegorical of the love between Christ and his bride, the church.\n\nWehr’s selections comment on the nature of love: it is permanent, strong, passionate, inextinguishable, and priceless. The female speaker in the poem seeks to stamp herself on her lover’s heart like a seal, claiming him as hers. She professes love’s power, which is as severe and enduring as death. In the context of this passage, the word “jealousy” appears to be used in the positive sense to mean zeal or passion—a resolute devotion.\n\nShe goes on to describe love as fiery and intense.\n\nIt seems her lover has gone out for the day, or gone on a trip, and she calls him back home. She can’t wait to hear his voice again. She waits outside for him in the garden, wishing for him to come bounding back into her arms.\n\n“Make haste, my love, and shine out like the rising sun.” One can imagine the myrrh-bearing women of the Gospels hoping beyond hope that their beloved Jesus would arise, would speak their names once more, would prove that love is indeed stronger than death.\n\nIt was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified him. . . .\n\nWhen it was noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. At three o’clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” . . . Then Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last.\n\n—Mark 15:25, 33–34, 37\n\nLOOK: Crucifix 45 by William Congdon\n\nAfter his conversion to Catholicism in 1959, artist William Congdon [previously], an American expatriate living in Italy, spent the next twenty years of his life painting dozens of Crucifixions. One of them, Crocefisso 45, shows the crucified Christ immersed in near total darkness. His form is barely differentiated from the black background but can just be discerned by the faint band of light that outlines it. Congdon writes that he wanted to portray “a body soaked with pain to the point that one cannot distinguish the body from the pain, almost as though the pain had become a body and not the body a pain.”1\n\nChrist’s head, like a gaping hole, hangs down to rest on his dimly luminescent chest. It’s as if the light of the world has been eclipsed. Art historian Giuseppe Mazzariol wrote of the recurring nero sole (black sun) in Congdon’s work, whose purpose is “to express the spiritual widowhood of a world marked by suffering.”2 Here it expresses the utter desolation of Good Friday.\n\nFred Licht writes that “in the Crucifixes [of Congdon] the black spot becomes the storm over Golgotha which is repeated every year with the advent of Good Friday, erasing the images from the altars, extinguishing the candles, and plunging the Christian world into deepest night.”3\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

Fred Licht, “The Art of William Congdon,” in Fred Licht, Peter Selz, and Rodolfo Balzarotti, William Congdon (Jaca Book: Milan, 1995): 11–58.\n\nLISTEN: “The Sun’s Gone Dim and the Sky’s Turned Black” by Jóhann Jóhannsson, on IBM 1401, A User’s Manual (2006) [HT]\n\nThe sun’s gone dim\n\nAnd the sky’s turned black\n\n’Cause I loved her\n\nAnd she didn’t love back\n\n“The Sun’s Gone Dim and the Sky’s Turned Black” by the late Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson (1969–2018) blends, as does most of his work, traditional orchestration with contemporary electronic elements. The elegiac lyrics, which repeat multiple times over the nearly six-minute runtime, are adapted from “Two-Volume Novel” by Dorothy Parker, a four-line poem about unrequited love.\n\nThis piece was inspired by a recording of an IBM mainframe computer that Jóhannsson’s father, Jóhann Gunnarsson, made on a reel-to-reel tape machine in the 1970s. (Gunnarsson was an IBM engineer and one of Iceland’s first computer programmers, who used early hardware to compose melodies during his downtime at work.) It was recorded by a sixty-piece string orchestra, with Jóhannsson on vocals.\n\nCredit goes to the Rabbit Room not only for this find but also for connecting it to Good Friday. (I found the song on their Lent playlist.) Imagine the speaker as Jesus on the cross, speaking to the world that he so loved (John 3:16) but who rejected him. Even the sky mourns with him as the sun veils her face. All is dark and seemingly lost.\n\nPOEM SEQUENCE: “The Unfolding” by Michael Stalcup: Michael Stalcup has published a sequence of five short poems in Solum Journal that “tells the story of Jesus’ death and resurrection by unfolding five words that take us from Maundy Thursday through Easter Sunday,” he says. “I wrote these poems in a very unusual way, restricting myself to words that could be formed from the letters in each poem’s title. . . . This poetic form calls for creativity within intense limitations, which seems fitting for Holy Week—a time when Jesus crafted the most beautiful art this world has ever known within the constraints of his own suffering and death.” Stalcup has also presented them on Instagram (click on the image below).\n\n+++\n\nARTICLE: “Don’t Rush Past Good Friday” by Brian Zahnd: Pastor and author Brian Zahnd cautions us not to shortchange the cross on the way to Easter, but rather to slow down and dwell there, beholding the crucified Christ.\n\n+++\n\nSONGS:\n\n>> “Friday Morning” by Sydney Carter, performed by Timothy Renner: This Good Friday song by the English folk musician Sydney Bertram Carter (1915–2004) is difficult—one might even say blasphemous. That’s because it’s voiced from the perspective of the “bad” thief, who is spewing hatred and bitterness over his fate and blaming God for having created such a cruel world. But we’re aware of an irony in the refrain that the convicted man is not: “It’s God they ought to crucify / Instead of you and me, / I said to the carpenter / A-hanging on the tree.”\n\nRead or listen to a reflection on “Friday Morning,” by Andrew Pratt, here.\n\n>> “Go to Hell” by Nick Chambers: This song is a setting of a poem by Pádraig Ó Tuama from his collection Sorry for Your Troubles (Canterbury Press Norwich, 2013). The title is shocking, I know, but it’s derived from a line in the Apostles’ Creed, where we Christians profess that after Jesus died, he “descended into hell.” The singer-songwriter, Nick Chambers, writes in the YouTube video description: “In between Good Friday and Easter Sunday is possibly strangest day of the Christian year. On Holy Saturday, not only is Jesus, the God-Man, in the grave; traditions abound about his descent to the dead, his ‘harrowing of hell.’ What does it mean for the coming down of God-with-us not to end on earth but ‘under the earth,’ extending hope to the furthest regions of human pain and abandonment? Such a question deserves more poetry than explanation.”\n\n“Go to hell” is a slang expression of scorn or rejection, to which Jesus was no stranger. As in the previous song, there’s an irony here, in telling Jesus to go to hell—because he did. Literally. Ó Tuama meditates on how Jesus shares in our vulnerabilities and yearnings and seeks to pull us out of the hells we’re in and redeem our stories.\n\nHear the poem read by the poet here, or at the end of the Stations of the Cross video below. “he is called to hell, this man / he is called to glory . . .”\n\n+++\n\nGUIDED MEDITATION: “Stations of the Cross, Good Friday, 2020” by Pádraig Ó Tuama: In 2020 the poet-theologian Pádraig Ó Tuama put together this twenty-minute video reflection for Good Friday structured around the Stations of the Cross, consisting of photos of art he’s taken and the praying of collects he’s written. (Several of the collects can be found in his book Daily Prayer with the Corrymeela Community from 2017.) The throughline is a set of stained-glass Stations by Sheila Corcoran at the Church of Our Lady Queen of Heaven at Dublin Airport; others are by Jong-Tae Choi, Gib Singleton, Sieger Köder, Richard P. Campbell, and Audrey Frank Anastasi.\n\nBut before stepping onto Jesus’s Via Dolorosa, Ó Tuama considers Judas, sharing a stained glass panel by Harry Clarke that illustrates a medieval legend about the Irish monastic saint Brendan the Navigator. According to the Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis, on one of his voyages St. Brendan encountered Judas at sea, tied to an iceberg. He learned that an angel had taken pity on Judas in hell and given him a reprieve of one hour to cool himself from the flames of judgment. Ó Tuama then prays for those who, like Judas, are tormented by guilt and see no way out.\n\nHe closes with a reading of his poem “Go to Hell” (set to music in the previous roundup item).\n\n+++\n\nSONG: “For the Songless Hearts” by Jon Guerra: “There’s a lot of hubbub around Easter weekend in churches. And for good reason,” says singer-songwriter Jon Guerra. “But our hearts can’t always cooperate with the prescribed mood of the Easter season: ‘Celebrate! Be happy! Sing!’ Sometimes the last thing we are able to do is sing. Thankfully, Good Friday and Easter are not about mustering a mood. Good Friday and Easter are about remembering that there is One who meets us in our life and meets us in our death. He sings for us—and over us—when we can’t.”\n\nThat’s what “For the Songless Hearts” is about—a single released in 2017, and which Guerra sings with his wife, Valerie. In a Mockingbird blog post about it, Guerra admonishes, “Remember that before the tomb was empty, it was full. ‘When he was laid in the tomb, he laid right next to you.’” Jesus knew the depths of sorrow and the sting of death. We are not alone in such experiences.\n\n. . . carrying the cross by himself he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha. There they crucified him . . .\n\n—John 19:17–18\n\nLOOK: White Mountain by Ihor Paneyko\n\nLISTEN: “Solus ad victimam” (Alone to Sacrifice Thou Goest, Lord) | Original Latin words by Peter Abelard, second quarter of 12th century; English translation by Helen Waddell, 1929 | Music by Kenneth Leighton, 1973 | Performed by St. Olaf Cantorei, dir. John Ferguson, on Hidden in Humbleness: Meditations for Holy Week and Easter, 2010\n\nAlone to sacrifice thou goest, Lord,\n\nGiving thyself to Death, whom thou hast slain.\n\nFor us, thy wretched folk, is [there] any word,\n\nWho know that for our sins this is thy pain?\n\nFor they are ours, O Lord, our deeds, our deeds.\n\nWhy must thou suffer torture for our sin?\n\nLet our hearts suffer for thy passion, Lord,\n\nThat very suffering may thy mercy win.\n\nThis is that night of tears, the three days’ space,\n\nSorrow abiding of the eventide,\n\nUntil the day break with the risen Christ,\n\nAnd hearts that sorrowed shall be satisfied.\n\nSo may our hearts share in thine anguish, Lord,\n\nThat they may sharers of thy glory be.\n\nHeavy with weeping may the three days pass,\n\nTo win the laughter of thine Easter Day.\n\n“In Parasceve Domini: III. Nocturno,” whose first line is “Solus ad victimam procedis, Domine,” is a Latin hymn by the French scholastic philosopher, theologian, and poet Peter Abelard (1079–1142). It appears in his collection Hymnarius Paraclitensis—a major contribution to medieval Latin hymnody—and was sung in the night office (Nocturns) of prayers on Good Friday.\n\nToday it is best known through its modern choral setting of the English by British composer and pianist Kenneth Leighton (1929–1988). Dr. David Ouzts, the minister of music and liturgy at Church of the Holy Communion in Memphis, says this is “one of the most effective musical settings of any anthem of the 1,000-plus octavos in our parish music library.” He continues:\n\nThis anthem is one of those with harmonies and sonorities that may not sound correct when they are. Worshipers will hear the sparseness of the choir singing in simple same-note octaves, and in the next moment, dissonances between the choral voices will appear.\n\nThough this 12th century text is most certainly a Passiontide text, my favorite aspect is that it foreshadows Easter and the Resurrection.\n\nThe wordplay of the music that accompanies “laughter” in the text is notable. The choral voices are high in their tessituras, and the full choir ends literally on a high note, after which the organ accompaniment steals the show with great dissonant chords, only to land on a huge, bright E Major chord.\n\nThe hymn invites us to follow Christ to Golgotha, beholding his suffering so that we might be moved to contrition and, clinging to God’s mercy, rise to newness of life—or, as the wonderful last line puts it, “win the laughter of [Christ’s] Easter Day.” The fourth stanza alludes to Romans 8:17, where the apostle Paul writes that we are “heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if we in fact suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.” Paul speaks elsewhere of believers being “crucified with Christ” (Gal. 2:20)—see my visual commentaries on this passage—and “baptized into his death” (Rom. 6:3) as well as being raised with him.\n\nJesus may have gone “alone to sacrifice”—but the fruits of that sacrifice abound to all who would eat. Praise be to God.\n\nAs we enter the Paschal Triduum, let us weep for our sins and for the innocent Lamb who was slain to atone for them. Let us also look with hope toward daybreak.\n\nThe carpenter is intent on the pressure of his hand\n\non the awl, and the trick of pinpointing his strength\n\nthrough the awl to the wood, which is tough.\n\nHe has no effort to spare for despoilings\n\nnor to worry if he’ll be cut in on the dice.\n\nHis skill is vital to the scene, and the safety of the state.\n\nAnyone can perform the indignities; it is his hard arms\n\nand craft that hold the eyes of the convict’s women.\n\nThere is the problem of getting the holes straight\n\n(in the middle of this shoving crowd)\n\nand deep enough to hold the spikes\n\nafter they’ve sunk through those soft feet\n\nand wrists waiting behind him.\n\nThe carpenter isn’t aware that one of the hands\n\nis held in a curious beseechment over him—\n\nbut what is besought, forgiveness or blessing?—\n\nnor if he saw would he take the time to be puzzled.\n\nCriminals come in all sorts, as anyone knows who makes crosses,\n\nare as mad or sane as those who decide on their killings.\n\nOur one at least has been quiet so far,\n\nthough they say he has talked himself into this trouble—\n\na carpenter’s son who got notions of preaching.\n\nWell here’s a carpenter’s son who’ll have carpenter’s sons,\n\nGod willing, and build what’s wanted, temples or tables,\n\nmangers or crosses, and shape them decently,\n\nworking alone in that firm and profound abstraction\n\nwhich blots out the bawling of rag-snatchers.\n\nTo construct with hands, knee-weight, braced thigh,\n\nkeeps the back turned from death.\n\nBut it’s too late now for the other carpenter’s boy\n\nto return to this peace before the nails are hammered.\n\nFrom Selected Poems, 1940–1966 by Earle Birney (Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1966), copyright © the Estate of Earle Birney.\n\nEarle Birney (1904–1995) is regarded as one of Canada’s finest poets. He is the author of twenty-five poetry collections, including David and Other Poems (1942), Now Is Time (1945), and Near False Creek Mouth (1964). He taught English at the University of British Columbia, where he founded and directed the first Canadian creative writing program. He was also a novelist, essayist, literary critic, and radio playwright.\n\nWhen they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.\n\nThen Jesus said to [his disciples], “You will all fall away because of me this night, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ But after I am raised up, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.”\n\nPeter said to him, “Even if all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.”\n\nJesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, this very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.”\n\nPeter said to him, “Even though I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And so said all the disciples.\n\nThen Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.” He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be grieved and agitated. Then he said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, even to death; remain here, and stay awake with me.” And going a little farther, he threw himself on the ground and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me, yet not what I want but what you want.”\n\nThen he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “So, could you not stay awake with me one hour? Stay awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”\n\nAgain he went away for the second time and prayed, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.” Again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.\n\nSo leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words. Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Now the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Get up, let us be going. Look, my betrayer is at hand.”\n\n—Matthew 26:30–46\n\nLOOK: Exceeding Sorrowful by Douglas Porter\n\nDoug Porter is a painter, video artist and editor, and graphic designer from Orillia, Ontario.

The painting’s title comes from the King James Version of Matthew 26:38, where Jesus tells his inner circle of disciples (Peter, James, and John), “My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.”\n\nHe had just eaten the Passover seder with them and the rest of the Twelve, pronouncing some strange words at the table: “Take, eat; this is my body,” he said as he broke the bread. And as he raised the wineglass, he commanded them, “Drink from it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins . . .”\n\nSinging a hymn and going out to the Mount of Olives, he then foretold his disciples’ desertion of him. Adapting God’s words from Zechariah 13:7, he told them that he, their shepherd, would be struck, and they, his sheep, would be scattered. They all protested, but their faithlessness would soon be revealed.\n\nUsing rich hues reminiscent of stained glass, Porter shows Christ with his eyes closed as if a wave of pain is passing over him, and his brow anxiously furrowed. (The head of Christ is based on a painted wood crucifix by Coppo di Marcovaldo of Italy, from around 1260.) He is broken, shattered; the three jagged shards of him pull away to reveal a dark void. At the top the rim of the cup of suffering is just visible, which he pleads with God to remove. But as he communes with the Father, he becomes increasingly bolstered in his resolve to carry out his mission to the very end.\n\nOn the right is a shepherd’s staff, also broken, representing Christ’s words about his being struck. Three of his “sheep” are sprawled out on the ground. The figures of Peter, James, and John are based on a fifteenth-century icon of the Transfiguration by Theophanes the Greek. These three disciples on the Mount of Olives had been privileged earlier to see their Lord gloriously transfigured on another mount: Tabor. And yet despite having received that divine vision, in Gethsemane they fall asleep, failing to support Jesus in his final hours.\n\nIn a few days, Jesus’s exceeding sorrow and pain would be transfigured. But on that Thursday and Friday, he drank that cup to its dregs.\n\nYou can read Porter’s statement about this painting on his website (scroll down to fifth entry).\n\nLISTEN: “Miracle” by Dave Von Bieker, on Bridge Songs ONE by Urban Bridge Church (2007) | MP3 provided by permission of the artist\n\nUpdate, 3/28/24: Von Bieker told me my interest in the song has spurred him on to remake it! Here’s his new recording from this week:\n\nThis garden grows death\n\nAnd it’s damp and it’s dark\n\nYour three closest friends\n\nAre asleep on the bark\n\nOf a tree that once grew tall\n\nOffering its shade\n\nBut it’s dead and it’s mourning\n\nIt’s black and decayed\n\nAnd you search for a place\n\nThat is far enough out\n\nSo your voice won’t be heard\n\nWhen you cry and you shout\n\nHave you come here to bargain?\n\nHave you come to ask why?\n\nIs that fear or pure sorrow\n\nBuried in your eyes?\n\nAnd isn’t it time\n\nTo turn water into wine?\n\nTo drink a different cup?\n\nTo forget what’s on your mind?\n\nIt seems a good time\n\nTo take up Satan’s deal\n\nTo leap from tall buildings\n\nWithout bruising a heel\n\nBut now’s not the time for miracles\n\nNow’s not the time for trap doors and way outs\n\nOh, now’s not the time for miracles\n\nEverything comes in its time\n\nIt’s a strange sort of prayer\n\nMore a fight to the death\n\nYou walk back to your watchmen\n\nThere isn’t one left\n\nThey’ve all slept through this spiritual\n\nSolar eclipse\n\nThey don’t get it, how could they\n\nWho would have guessed this?\n\nAnd you drop to your knees\n\nThere’s no way out, not yet\n\nAnd your pores are still dripping\n\nWith blood, oh, with sweat\n\nJacob left with a limp\n\nMoses’ tongue couldn’t find\n\nAn excuse, Paul be blinded\n\nWhy fight him when you know it’s no use?\n\nWhen you know, well\n\nThat now’s not the time for miracles\n\nNow’s not the time for trap doors and way outs\n\nNo, now’s not the time for miracles\n\nEverything comes in its time\n\nYou sit at her bedside\n\nAnd cry to the roof\n\nI don’t know why I hold on\n\nWhen I have no proof\n\nBut there’s something in knowing\n\nYou knew how this felt\n\nYeah, there’s something in sharing\n\nThis hand that we’re dealt\n\nAnd isn’t it time to say,\n\n“Wake up, arise! Come on,\n\nTake up your mat! Come on\n\nAnd open your eyes!”\n\nIsn’t it time now?\n\nHe’s sick, close to death\n\nHe’s been in the grave for four days\n\nWhy not yet?\n\nBut now’s not the time for miracles\n\nNow’s not the time for trap doors and way outs\n\nNo, now’s not the time for miracles\n\nAnd everything comes in its time\n\nAnd everything comes in its time\n\nDave Von Bieker is a singer-songwriter from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, who performs and records under the artist name “Von Bieker.” He wrote “Miracle” while part of a songwriting group connected to Urban Bridge Church, a Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada church plant in downtown Edmonton that existed from 2006 to 2015. “We [were] writing songs that dance around the edges of the sacred and songs that wade right through it,” he said. “We [were] questioning and shouting with our songs.”\n\nStarting in 2007, each year the collective shared some of their work at a live concert event they dubbed Bridge Songs and released an album. “Miracle” is from the first such album, Bridge Songs ONE. This album is no longer available, but Von Bieker gave me permission to share this song from it, which I learned about last year as a subscriber to his newsletter, Von Bieker Backstage.\n\nThe narrator of the song observes Christ’s distress in the garden of Gethsemane and questions why he doesn’t work a miracle to avoid the cross. Then the refrain comes in—perhaps in Christ’s voice, perhaps in the voice of the concessionary narrator—saying that “now’s not the time for miracles” but suggesting that the miracle of resurrection will come in its time.\n\nA bloody crucifixion is probably not the path to victory we would have imagined, but it’s the path God in his wisdom laid out and took and by doing so showed com-passion (literally “suffering with”) on humanity. The physical, mental, and spiritual anguish that God in Christ endured speaks to God’s awesome love, which comes alongside us in our own suffering.\n\nIn the third verse “Miracle” appears to shift to a contemporary scene of a loved one (daughter? wife? mother? friend?) lying gravely ill in bed. Why doesn’t God intervene to miraculously heal? It then moves back again in time to the story of Lazarus, who died. His sister Martha chastises Jesus for his delayed arrival to Lazarus’s bedside. Upon seeing the four-days-dead body of his friend in the tomb, “Jesus began to weep” and was “greatly disturbed” (John 11:35, 38). Then, after giving space to his grief, he calls into the dark cavern, “Lazarus, come out!”—and wouldn’t you know, Lazarus comes stumbling out alive! A delayed miracle.\n\nI love how this song enfolds the story of Christ into our own and that of the Old and New Testament saints, who wrestled with God and stammered their doubts and had their obstinacy obliterated by blinding light, or their fervent belief validated by a brother’s sudden awakening from the grave.\n\nIn addition to writing songs, in September 2011 Von Bieker founded Bleeding Heart Art Space, a community space dedicated to exploring art, faith, and justice. He served as director, or “arts chaplain,” until June 2018. Bleeding Heart started as a ministry of Urban Bridge Church, and when that church closed, Bleeding Heart was grafted into St. Faith’s Anglican Church, under whose aegis it remains active today, organizing pop-up solo and group exhibitions and hosting ArtLucks for local artists to share what they’ve been working on.\n\nIf I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. . . .\n\nI give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.\n\n—John 13:14–15, 34–35\n\nLOOK: We Are by Hyeyoung Shin [HT]\n\nHyeyoung Shin is a South Korean–born, Kansas City–based artist whose work explores human vulnerability, humility, intimacy, empathy, interpersonal relationships, and belonging.\n\nWe Are is the name of a solo exhibition of hers from 2010 consisting of life-size drawings and lithographs of human feet and a foot-washing performance. Shin executed thirty-four graphite drawings on paper as well as on paper garments that she custom-made. The structural anchor of the installation was five muslin panels, each ten yards long, suspended from the ceiling and draped like a hammock. On the upper reaches of each were lithographs of two pairs of legs, and in the bed of the hammock lay a mat, a pillow, and a paper dress. Leading up to the hammock was a long sheet of paper with twelve sets of footprints arranged in two rows, evoking Jesus’s twelve disciples.\n\nShin enacted the foot washings herself. She said that “through the experiences, I began to learn again how to practice love akin to holding my mother’s feet” as she lay dying of a terminal illness. The physical proximity and tender touch at that gallery event opened up channels of empathy between the artist and participants.\n\nLISTEN: “Reverie: This is my will,” arr. Anne-Marie O’Farrell, on Easter in Ireland: Music for the Paschal Season (2020)\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Anne-Marie O’Farrell, a harpist, composer, and Church of Ireland minister from Dublin, wrote this reverie on the Maundy Thursday hymn “This Is My Will” for solo lever harp in 2019. (A reverie is an instrumental piece suggesting a dreamy or musing state.) The Jesuit priest James Quinn (1918–2010) of Scotland wrote the hymn text, reproduced below, in 1969, a paraphrase of John 15:11–17, pairing it with a traditional Irish suantraí (lullaby) melody. It is that melody—which in Ireland has come to be associated with Holy Week, thanks to Quinn—that O’Farrell has arranged here. Purchase sheet music for O’Farrell’s harp reverie, or an arrangement for SATB voices and solo.\n\nThis is my will, my one command,\n\nthat love should dwell among you all.\n\nThis is my will, that you should love\n\nas I have shown that I love you.\n\nNo greater love a man can have\n\nthan that he die to save his friends.\n\nYou are my friends if you obey\n\nall I command that you should do.\n\nI call you now no longer slaves;\n\nno slave knows all his master does.\n\nI call you friends, for all I hear\n\nmy Father say you hear from me.\n\nYou chose not me, but I chose you,\n\nthat you should go and bear much fruit.\n\nI called you out that you in me\n\nshould bear much fruit that will abide.\n\nAll that you ask my Father dear\n\nfor my name’s sake you shall receive.\n\nThis is my will, my one command,\n\nthat love should dwell in each, in all.\n\nJesus speaks this discourse after washing his disciples’ feet the day before his death. The name traditionally accorded to Thursday of Holy Week—Maundy Thursday—comes from the Latin word mandatum, “command,” referencing this passage."
