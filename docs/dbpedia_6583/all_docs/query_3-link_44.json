We spent a lot of hours playing and getting in trouble together. I can't believe he's gone. The last time we talked was about a couple years ago, reminiscing about our younger days for a couple hours until his phone died. It was so nice to hear from him. Never thought it would be the last time. Such a great guy. He will be sadly missed. My deepest condolences to all those who loved him. I hope you can take comfort in the sweet memories you have of him. Rest in peace, Danny. Love you. ❤️\n\nJanice Mahon (Elgar), June 12, 2022\n\nNatalie\n\nWe are saddened to hear the new of Danny passing. Our thoughts and prayers go out to you and your boys.
