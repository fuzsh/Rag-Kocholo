        "text": "Kia Ora Parents, Students and Whānau,\n\nIt is with great sadness that we have learned that Matua Stuart Anderson passed away peacefully in Auckland Hospital on Tuesday 24/1/23.\n\nStuart had been diagnosed with cancer in August of last year and was able to spend the precious time he had after that diagnosis with his wife, twins, parents, friends and whānau.\n\nStuart has been employed at Waitākere College since 2016 and has been an outstanding teacher of maths and scholarship calculus (including students from our neighbouring secondary schools). Stuart is hugely respected by his colleagues in the Maths Department and his peers across the whole school.\n\nStuart is also one of our Kāhui Ako Community of Schools leaders and played a lead role in demystifying the language of mathematics and numeracy here and in our Primary and Intermediate schools.\n\nThere was a lovely service for Stuart attended by many staff and students, both current and past teachers and students acknowledging the positive difference that he made to all our lives.\n\nAs you can imagine this news regarding Matua Stuart is very challenging for our College community. We are offering support to our staff and we are also ensuring support is available to any students who Stuart has taught or any students affected by his passing. Our Guidance Counsellors will be available; feel free to contact our HoD of Guidance, Katie Wasson on [email protected] or you can txt 1737 for immediate support from Helpline.\n\nThere has also been a Givealittle page set up by Stuart’s whānau through which you may wish to offer your support to help them navigate a pathway over the coming months.\n\nhttps://givealittle.co.nz/cause/support-for-stu-andersons-family\n\nPhoto credit - Melanie Jenkins, Photographer at flashstudios\n\nNgā mihi nui and God bless,\n\nMark P Shanahan"
