        "text": "James “Jim” R. Day passed away on October 1, 2022.\n\nJim was the third child of six of Kenneth and Luz Day, Detroit, Michigan. His Holcomb Elementary years were the beginnings of his leadership and lifelong friendships: from being a member of Future Teachers of America to being Captain of the Safety Patrol, Jim took his classes and extracurricular activities to heart. He even played “school” with his younger siblings, as ‘Mr. Reilly, Teacher.’ Yes, we had lesson plans, worksheets, and were given homework! At Holcomb reunions, his favorite teacher from Holcomb, Kenneth McAlpine, remembered this with a chuckle (how many kids play School after school?).\n\nFrom Emerson Jr. High to Redford High School (class of 1967) Jim played the baritone and sang baritone. Not surprisingly, he received all A’s in music classes. He loved being in the barbershop quartet for the production of “Music Man” and very much enjoyed the talents of Mr. Gene Fenby in the specialty vocal groups at RHS. Jim worked at the Federal Department Store at 7 Mile and Grand River when he was 16; he worked the next two summers for his Uncle Pete McAlpine at Durant & McAlpine Plumbing Company.\n\nIn 1968, Jim sang with two of his sisters, a future brother-in-law, and a friend at older brother Ken’s wedding reception at West Point. The five of them - Jim, Mary Luz, Lorna, Bruce Jacobson, and Loren Wolfe - called themselves “The Sons and the Daughters,” fashioned after the Mamas and the Papas group.\n\nJim’s years at the University of Michigan were filled with establishing long-time friendships: he was a member and President of the Michigan Men’s Glee Club. During his tenure as President, this esteemed ensemble won the International Musical Eisteddfod (World Competition) in Llangollen, Wales in 1971. Jim’s future brother-in-law Bruce shared all these Glee Club experiences with him.\n\nThe autumn after this big award, Jim became the Resident Advisor for the 8th floor, Huber House, South Quad all male dorm floor (during the beginning of coed dorm life at Michigan). His Freshmen residents were a hardy group of future CEOs and Presidents, an Architect, a Dentist, a Naval officer, a Lawyer and many more successful careers. He loved his residents and they all loved him. Good friendships, great stories, and a brother-in-law, Charlie, evolved from this one year beginning September of 1971 through May of 1972.\n\nJim belonged to the Young Republicans on campus: not too popular a club in the late ‘60’s – early 70’s. He remained a staunch Conservative his whole life.\n\nDuring his collegiate summers of 1968-1971, Jim worked at the Ford Transmission Plant, Ford Credit Company, Chrysler Motor Company, Sanford Security, and Plymouth Parts Shop.\n\nJim worked part- and full-time for Ford Motor Co., Saline, from 1972-1984 in the following capacities: Production Supervisor, Material Handling Supervisor, Pro- duction Control General Supervisor, Senior Parts Distributor & Scheduler, Quality Engineer, Employee Involvement Facilitator, and Salaried Personnel Specialist. While working for Ford, Jim obtained his M.B.A. in Business Management from Eastern Michigan University in 1980.\n\nDuring the Spring Break of 1974, Jim drove his Gran Torino, along with Charlie Schrock, to Ft. Benning, GA, to visit brother Ken and his family. Surprisingly, they did not get a speeding ticket after being pulled over by a State Trooper at 2:00 a.m. in a small Georgia town. He enjoyed reminiscing about this trip on many occasions.\n\nJim was passionate about the Michigan Wolverine football team and watched the games live or on TV from 1967 through 2022. He never forgot the “Bo years” and used those as a Standard Comparison, forever. Jim enjoyed golfing but had more fun watching the Masters with Mary Luz and Peter, and Leonor and Bruce.\n\nJim was also a huge fan of the Detroit Red Wings and Tigers. He took his only nephew to a Wings’ game. His homes and apartments were decorated with memorabilia from these four sports.\n\nBecause the youngest four Day siblings (Jim, Lorna, Leonor and Liz) were students at U of M at the same time, his sisters’ friends from high school and University of Michigan (Arlene, Chris, Sue, Claire, Gerry, Patty, Sherry, Mary, Tena) all thought of Jim as their big brother. He was fun and was always included in the girls’ events, parties, dances, and the M stadium games. Go Blue!\n\nAfter Jim graduated in 1977 with a BA in Psychology, he continued to help the Glee Club by being a steadfast member of the Phillip A. Duey Scholarship Committee. Jim believed in Dr. Duey’s original intent and was an advocate to retain those intentions in Phil Duey’s honor. Dr. Duey was revered by Jim, and they kept in touch years after Dr. Duey’s retirement.\n\nJim was involved in Junior Achievement from 1979 to 1982, again, making lifetime friendships. In particular are his dear friends the Fosters: Tim, Karen, and their sons, Liam, Quinn and Brendan. The (grown) boys still call him Uncle Jim. During Jim’s last years, the Fosters diligently visited him, bringing smiles, supplies, and prayers.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1986, Jim was co-owner and President of LCO, Inc.; he and partner Dan Benson owned and opened the first Little Caesar's in the Eugene, Oregon area. Brother Ken visited from Poulsbo, WA, and enjoyed seeing the start-up operation.\n\nBy 1986 Jim was back in Michigan, working for Univ. of Michigan Salvage, as Director of Sales (Hospital Disposal Project). His next jobs at UM Hospitals were Building Manager and Total Quality Management (TQM) Consultant/ Facili-tator/Instructor, through 1997. Jim successfully trained over 500 managers and supervisors in TQM Leadership and Facility Leadership courses at the Hospital. He also taught these courses to Michigan clients from Lakeland Health, Department of Corrections, Pine Rest Christian Hospital, as well as in other states: Lake of the Ozarks Hospital, The Carle Clinic, and the University of Illinois and in Canada at The Doctors Hospital & Queensway Carleton Hospital.\n\nFrom 1997-1998, Jim taught classes at Cleary College and Eastern Michigan University (Management, Psych, Org. Change and Team Effectiveness). He was proud of his many career Recognitions and Certificates and displayed all these awards on his home office wall.\n\nFrom 1997 through 2005, Jim was the Manager of Property Disposition Warehouse. He retired in 2005.\n\nJim took over the McAlpine / Day cottage (built in 1929) on Lake St. Clair in Ontario, Canada, and had many years of fun with friends and relatives: ski-dooing, boating, and catching fish. He loved fishing more than golf and hunting: he had a talent for catching big stringers-full of bass and perch. Jim also loved fishing for walleyes on Lake Erie. If you asked him his favorite place on Earth, he’d say, “The Cottage in Canada.” For three years he joined friends flying into remote lakes in Canada to fish, and had a visit to Beaver Island with brother Ken to fish Lake Michigan with Leo and Bruce. He caught some big lake trout on Lake Michigan with Charlie and Liz as well. Jim was able to fish on Patten Lake at Liz’s and Charlie’s home several times.\n\nJim stood up in the weddings of Ken (twice!), Mary Luz, Leonor, and Liz; he did the same for many friends as well. He was honored to be a part of so many people’s Big Day,and they were honored to have him as a witness. His in-laws and their extended families became full brothers and sisters to Jim. Jim never forgot to inquire about Linda, Peter, Bill, Bruce, and Charlie or their extended families.\n\nJim fully respected our choices in life. Jim was loved by all of them.\n\nJim and Mary Luz provided care during their parents’ last years: Jim never complained as he helped tirelessly, making decisions, keeping the siblings appraised, and all the details that go into a very trying job. He and ‘Luz’ were partners.\n\nAfter sister Mary Luz passed away in 2010, Jim frequently mentioned how much he missed her. He talked about the fun gatherings, especially the major holidays she and Pete would host, always including him. She was dear to Jim.\n\nJim’s siblings would say that Jim was the “Uncle Buck” to his nieces (Carol, Wendy, Emily, Karen, Melanie, Jennifer, and Michelle) and nephew (Kenneth). Who gave the children loud toys? Who showed up at Thanksgiving and Christmas with armfuls of gifts and smiles to make that nephew say, “can he come back and stay 200 days?” It was Uncle Jim: they all loved him like crazy.\n\nJim liked going to the Sidetrack Bar & Grill in Depot Town, Ypsilanti, with Lorna and Bill, Pete and Rena, Ken, and any other visiting relative or friend. Didn’t he seemed to live his whole life like the words to his favorite singer’s big hit, “My Way”? Coincidentally, Jim converted many novices to Old Blue Eyes’ songs…\n\nAs Jim’s health began declining he was not allowed the pleasures of travel and outside activities. When brother Ken passed away in September, 2021, Jim was very sad that he couldn’t attend the funeral. His health was already declining, and he was not able to travel on his own.\n\nThis great, personable man was house-bound, relying on visitors and friends to come to his apartment. One friend who helped was Matt Branistareanu, who provided friendship and caregiving to Jim. Another dear friend from Jim’s R.A. days at Michigan, Frank Tymowski, along with his wife, Ania frequently checked up on him. The Fosters continued to include Jim in their holidays, local Ypsi events, and church events up until the pandemic altered everyone’s lives.\n\nJim made many friends at Cross Street Village over the eight years he resided there. He played poker with his best friends there and ran the Sunday Evening Movies in the apartment complex theater, where both the Zubrin baby grand piano and the Schrock theater equipment was located. He loved the local high school groups coming in to sing Christmas Carols (and asking him to sing solos or duets with them). He was known and liked by all the apartment residents. They will miss Jim.\n\nWe all will miss Jim’s smile. We will miss his intelligence, his thoughtful way of listening, his musical talents, and his love of attending his sibling’s and his nieces’ and nephew’s music performances, sporting events, and weddings. We will miss his strong political opinions. We will miss him; he left this world way too early.\n\nThe family has requested that gifts in memory of Jim be made to the Phillip A. Duey Scholarship at the University of Michigan, earmarked for members of the Men’s Glee Club, or mail to the attention of the School of Music, Theatre & Dance, 2005 Baits Drive, Ann Arbor, 48109.\n\nA fellow Glee Club scholarship committee member, Jack Baker, said, “I always looked up to [Jim] a great deal; he has always epitomized someone whose heart and soul was devoted to the [Glee] Club.”\n\nA Memorial Open House will be held on Wednesday, October 12, 2022 from 11:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m. at Cottage Inn located at 512 East William, Ann Arbor, in the Banquet Room on the upper level. There is a parking garage close by.\n\nThank you for caring about our Dear Brother."
