The WPHL is considered the 1st professional Hockey league. Hern also backstopped the Keystones to the 1902 WPHL championship,\n\nMany exhibition games were being played at the time between rival leagues, such as the International Professional Hockey League / IPHL. The more games a player was in, the higher the income.\n\nHern then joined the Portage Lakes Hockey Club of the International Professional Hockey League / IPHL (IHL) for the 1903-04 season, helping them win the 1904 championship. The Portage Lakes Hockey team considered themselves \"World Champions\" as during the season they defeated teams from the IPHL, WPHL, Twin City Hockey League (St. Paul) and from Canada, the Montreal Victorias and Montreal Wanderers.\n\nThe Portage Lakes team played in the famous 5,000-seat Houghton Amphidrome, the world's first facility built specifically for Hockey.\n\nHe played with Cyclone Taylor, Joe Hall and Bruce Stewart to name a few while playing for the Portage Lakes team. He was named to the International Hockey League All-Star First Team for 1904-05 season and the All-Star Second Team for 1905-06, and backstopped the Portage Lakes to the IPHL (IHL) championship for the 1905-06 season.\n\nHern was the recruited by the Montreal Wanderers, who had been playing in the Federal Amateur Hockey League / FAHL, but then helped form the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association / ECAHA, a new league that allowed teams to openly use professional players, along with amateur players too.\n\nHern backstopped the Wanderers to the ECAHA championship in 1907 and 1908 winning the Arena Cup as champions.\n\nHern also played in Stanley Cup challenge games vs New Glasgow Cubs in December 1906, and the Kenora Thistles in two challenge series, the first in January, losing both games, and then again in March 1907, winning the 2 game series, winning back the Stanley Cup championship.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe 1907 Montreal Wanderers became the 1st team to engrave the players names on the Stanley Cup, which they did inside the bowl of the trophy.\n\nHern and the Wanderers, as Stanley Cup champions played in the Hod Stuart Benefit All-Star Game vs ECAHA All-Stars, winning 10-7 on January 2, 1908.\n\nThe Wanderers, with Hern in goal would win the Stanley Cup championship again in 1908 and 1910.\n\nAfter the finish of the 1909 season, and new league was formed, the National Hockey Association / NHA, with the Wanderers becoming the 1st champions, winning the new O'Brien Trophy. They were also declared the Stanley Cup champions in 1910 as the NHA champions.\n\nHern played one final season in 1910-11, finishing his career in a exhibition series played at the St. Nicholas Rink, in New York City and the Boston Arena, in Massachusetts. These games were the very 1st professional games played in Boston.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Hern refereed games in the NHA, along with exhibition games and was also a goal judge. He also was involved as a executive in forming other amateur Hockey leagues.\n\nHern's grandson is Allan F.
