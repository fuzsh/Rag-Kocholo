        "text": "Veterinary leaders\n\nSYNERGIZE at AVMA conference\n\nLeaders from AVMA principal veterinary organizations in the states and Puerto Rico as well as from Canada, Mexico, and many AVMA constituent allied veterinary organizations came together once again in January for leadership development, decision making, strategizing, and networking.\n\nThe 2008 AVMA Veterinary Leadership Conference, Jan. 11–13, drew 470 leaders, topping last year's record attendance by 50. In recent years, Chicago has hosted the event, but this year's venue at a new hotel and convention center in Schaumburg, Ill., made nearby AVMA headquarters a popular tour destination.\n\nThe conference offered two concurrent agendas— leadership development workshops and the AVMA House of Delegates' first regular winter session (see page 662).\n\nGeneral sessions, open to all attendees, featured reports about relevant issues and legislation along with noteworthy programs and developments.\n\nFull disclosure\n\nDisclosure of medical errors was the topic of the opening speaker, Kathleen Bonvicini, EdD, associate director of the Institute for Healthcare Communication.\n\nDr. Bonvicini said being open and honest with clients about medical errors can help rebuild trust, preserve professional integrity, and reduce malpractice lawsuits.\n\n“It's how they're treated that's going to get them to file a complaint or badmouth your practice,” Dr. Bonvicini said.\n\nYet, a 2004 survey of recent veterinary graduates in the United Kingdom found that while 78 percent reported making a medical error resulting in an adverse outcome, 40 percent had not discussed the error with the client.\n\nDr. Bonvicini said barriers to disclosing a medical error can include uncertainty over the cause, a professional culture in which veterinarians feel shame for being fallible, a lack of training in communication skills, and a variety of other fears—including the fear of adding to the client's distress.\n\nDr. Bonvicini said the client wants to know what happened, though. The TEAM model is one approach to the disclosure discussion, she said. The model calls for veterinarians to be truthful, acknowledging error and harm. They should empathize with the client's experience. The model calls for veterinarians to apologize and express regret. Finally, they should manage through to resolution.\n\n“A lot of times, we base our framework on the worst possible situation, the worst possible client,” Dr. Bonvicini cautioned.\n\nDr. Bonvicini adapted the presentation from one of 12 educational modules that the Institute for Healthcare Communication developed with a grant from Bayer Animal Health to train veterinarians in communication skills. Thirty veterinary colleges are participating in the BAH Communication Project.\n\nThe AVMA PLIT, a trust that provides professional liability insurance and other insurance programs, has begun collaborating with the IHC to adapt all the educational modules for veterinary meetings.\n\nNCVEI leadership\n\nDr. Ralph Richardson, chairman of the National Commission on Veterinary Economic Issues, spoke briefly after Dr. Bonvicini. He recognized the contributions of the NCVEI's founding chief executive officer, Howard Rubin, who departed in November, and the commission's first chairman, Dr. James E. Nave, whose term ended this past July.\n\nThe NCVEI board elected Dr. Richardson as chairman in October. Dr. Richardson has been dean of the Kansas State University College of Veterinary Medicine since 1998. A diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine, he taught previously at Purdue University School of Veterinary Medicine, where he was head of veterinary clinical sciences for more than a decade. He also served as a captain in the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps after graduating from KSU in 1970.\n\nAt press time, the NCVEI was seeking a new CEO.\n\nA theatrical introduction\n\nThe weekend session began with a skit by a comedy troupe from The Second City introducing a new veterinary-industry alliance—the Alliance for Healthier Pets—Obesity Awareness and Prevention Program.\n\nThe AVMA and Hill's Pet Nutrition Inc. have formed the alliance to help veterinarians and their staff educate clients about the health implications of obesity in cats and dogs.\n\nNeal Thompson, president of the Americas for Hill's Pet Nutrition, said, “We want to provide you with the tools needed to achieve weight management success.” Today, he said, 35 percent of adult pets and 50 percent of pets over age 7 are overweight.\n\nThe skit portrayed the dynamics between a family and their veterinarian in recognizing and coming to terms with pet obesity, and the initial reluctance some veterinarians and veterinary staff may have in raising the issue with their clients.\n\nThe alliance was officially launched Jan. 20 at the North American Veterinary Conference in Orlando, Fla. (see JAVMA, Feb. 1, page 341).\n\nFrom the AVMA\n\nAVMA President Gregory S. Hammer presented AVMA highlights from 2007. “Our relationships are growing strong, and I'd like to see that continue. In August, Dr. Ron DeHaven took the reins as the AVMA's executive vice president,” he noted, also recognizing executive staff who were hired or promoted, and staff who retired.\n\nTurning to the AVMA Strategic Plan, Dr. Hammer noted that last year, the Executive Board approved a strategic goal for each of the five previously adopted AVMA critical issues—advocacy, veterinary workforce, education, animal welfare, and economic viability. The strategic plan is still under development, he said, but the leadership and staff have already been working toward objectives under each goal.\n\n“Times are changing and barriers exist that can keep our Association from adapting and growing,” Dr. Hammer said. “Keeping the ultimate goals in sight, we must break through those barriers to achieve them.”\n\nDr. Bret D. Marsh led off his AVMA treasurer's report by saying, “2007 was a good year for us fiscally, and membership in particular continued to grow; our membership now exceeds 76,000 people around the country—over 85 percent of the eligible veterinarians in the country belong to the AVMA. Dues income from those members represents approximately 60 percent of the annual income to the AVMA, and it topped $16 million last year.”\n\nThe treasurer listed some of the AVMA's other income sources, among them, investment earnings, which he said exceeded budget projections and totaled more than $1.8 million.\n\n“Although the year-end figures are not all in and we're still subject to an audit of those books, we expect income over expenses for the year 2007 to exceed $1.5 million—all in all, a good year for the AVMA,” Dr. Marsh said.\n\nFor 2008, he noted that the annual budget is $28.8 million and projects $118,400 in income over expenses.\n\nAn update from the AVMA Group Health and Life Insurance Trust was presented by Dr. Gary Holfinger, chair of the GHLIT board of trustees. Effective Dec. 1, the GHLIT switched the network provider from First Health to Aetna Signature Administrators. “With ASA, 99.4 percent of our members—from Fairbanks, Alaska, down to Key West—will have accessibility to that network,” Dr. Holfinger said. “We also found that, based on our claims history, 87 percent of our insureds would not have to change physicians.”\n\nWhy was the network provider changed? He said, “The answer is very simple—our projected savings are about a million dollars every month, and a million dollars goes right to the bottom line to help our insureds offset (coverage expenses) for the rising cost of health insurance.”\n\nDr. Holfinger added that as of Jan. 1, ASA expanded its network to include the Mayo Clinic Rochester and Mayo Health System.\n\nAddressing the leadership conference as AVMA executive vice president for the first time, Dr. Ron DeHaven extended his thanks to Dr. Hammer for his friendship since the new CEO joined the AVMA staff and for “his unending energy on behalf of the AVMA.”\n\nAdding to Dr. Hammer's comments on the AVMA Strategic Plan, Dr. DeHaven reported that as the Executive Board suggested, he has appointed a manager from staff for each of the five strategic goals. He explained that not only are there specific objectives for each goal but also tactics for each objective. “The tactics are on-the-ground activities that will help achieve the objectives,” he said, giving some examples.\n\nDr. DeHaven noted that in November, these objectives and tactics were presented informally to the board, which endorsed the direction staff was taking with them. In April, Dr. DeHaven and staff will come back to the board with a detailed implementation plan for approval.\n\nAnother general session speaker was Dr. Mark Lutschaunig, director of the AVMA Governmental Relations Division, who discussed developments with the GRD, Congress, and the AVMA Political Action Committee.\n\nDr. Gail C. Golab, director of the Animal Welfare Division, presented an interesting approach toward understanding how diverse stakeholders perceive the same welfare issue. She described three housing systems for laying hens and challenged attendees to ask themselves which system they would choose, and why. “Everyone's choice is going to be influenced by values and experiences,” she said. She went on to describe the various frames of reference and their origins, using veterinarians in multiple types of practices, other scientists, businesses, the public, and public officials as examples.\n\nThe only declared candidate for AVMA president-elect, Dr. Larry M. Corry, and for vice president, Dr. Gary Brown, gave short addresses relating some of their priorities and asking delegates to vote for them at the House of Delegates session this July in New Orleans.\n\nClosing day speaker Steve Gilliland talked about “Discovering the magic and power of WE.” It involves four things, he said—purpose, passion, potential, and people.\n\n“But the first thing you have to do is find your voice, because you will always lead from the essence of who you are as a person,” he said. “If I said to you ‘name five people that have impacted your life the most,' who would you name? What did they give you?” Would you make someone else's list?\n\nManaging things isn't the same as leading people, Gilliland said—being a leader is about serving. “You'll know you've arrived as a leader when people follow you because they want to, not because they believe they have to.”\n\n—KATIE BURNS AND SUSAN C. KAHLER\n\nLeadership workshops emphasize communication, collaboration\n\nAttendees at the recent AVMA Veterinary Leadership Conference participated in a variety of leadership development workshops, several of which tackled the intertwining topics of communication and collaboration.\n\nDr. Althea A. Jones, AVMA online professional services editor, spoke about new communications technologies ranging from wikis to webinars.\n\nA wiki is a Web page that anyone can edit, she said, and wikis can help groups work together despite separations in space and time. A webinar, or Web seminar, combines a conference call with content on the computer screen via the Internet. Webinars are becoming more practical, even as the technology continues to evolve.\n\n“You're always playing catch-up with technology,” Dr. Jones said. “That's just how it is.”\n\nRalph Johnson, executive director of the Colorado VMA, and Bob Rohde, president of the Dumb Friends League of Denver, discussed how veterinary associations and humane organizations can collaborate.\n\nJohnson and Rohde said veterinary associations may view humane organizations, particularly organizations that offer free spay/neuter procedures, as the competition. Animal shelters may believe veterinarians can afford to offer them more free services. Despite any distrust, though, the groups share the goal of responsible pet ownership.\n\nJohnson said the Colorado VMA and humane organizations have worked together on multiple initiatives. Pet owners who can't pay for spay/neuter procedures benefit from initiatives such as vouchers for free procedures, a check-off on state income tax returns for the Colorado Pet Overpopulation Fund, and mobile spay/neuter units.\n\n“I hear, ‘If they can't afford an animal, then they shouldn't have one,’ but they do, and they always will,” Rohde said.\n\nThe AVMA Communications Division led workshops featuring interactive scenarios in crisis communication. Sessions began with an overview of the subject, emphasizing the need for a communication plan. Then participants broke into groups, each acting as the crisis team of a state VMA.\n\nThe scenarios included the recall of a diabetes drug, an outbreak of footand-mouth disease, and a series of newspaper articles about filthy conditions and unprofessional conduct at local veterinary clinics. With each situation, new developments arose during the exercise.\n\nThe other two workshops focused on effective leadership and on gender and generational diversity. Dr. Jeff Thoren of Gifted Leaders and Brian Sorge of Lambert and Associates were the speakers for the respective sessions.\n\n–KATIE BURNS\n\nDelegates hold first official winter session\n\nDr. James O. Cook, AVMA president-elect, presided over the House of Delegates' first regular winter session, held Jan. 12 during the AVMA Veterinary Leadership Conference. Previously, the HOD held an informational assembly during the leadership conference. The winter session is held in addition to the regular annual session held in conjunction with the AVMA Annual Convention.\n\nDr. Mark Helfat, chair of the AVMA House Advisory Committee, said the winter session will create greater synergy between the HOD and other leadership committees and allow delegates more flexibility in conducting business.\n\nAt the first regular winter session, delegates approved the minutes of the 2007 HOD Annual Session and a new House of Delegates Manual. Noteworthy changes to the manual included adding the Department of Homeland Security to the HOD advisory panel and making editorial changes to accommodate the regular winter session. The advisory panel now comprises eight agencies or organizations.\n\nBesides convening in formal sessions, the HOD met in reference committees and engaged in informal open discussion on a number of planned topics and additional ones introduced by delegates.\n\nCraig Little, director of the AVMA Information Technology Division, demonstrated the electronic voting system the AVMA has purchased for use by the House of Delegates and other entities. Delegates had expressed interest in electronic voting, which will provide instant, accurate, and retrievable results in elections and votes on issues. The results will be weighted as mandated by the AVMA Bylaws.\n\nElectronic voting will become operational when the HOD holds its regular annual session July 18–19 in New Orleans.\n\nComments invited on proposed reptile and amphibian specialty\n\nThe AVMA American Board of Veterinary Specialties has received a petition for recognition of the Reptile and Amphibian Practice specialty under the auspices of the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners, which has been an AVMA-recognized veterinary specialty organization since 1978. In compliance with ABVS procedures for recognition of a new specialty under an existing specialty organization (www.avma.org/education/abvs/abvs_policies _III.asp), the ABVS is now seeking comment from the public and the profession regarding the proposed new specialty.\n\nThe Association of Reptile and Amphibian Veterinarians (www.arav.org) first petitioned the ABVP in 2006 to begin the process toward recognition of the Reptile and Amphibian Practice specialty. The ABVP submitted a formal petition for recognition of the specialty to the ABVS Committee on the Development of New Specialties in December 2007.\n\nThe ABVP and the organizing committee for the proposed new specialty believe that the diverse and unique veterinary requirements of reptiles and amphibians—including iguanas, turtles, snakes, frogs, and toads—are substantial enough to warrant separate specialty recognition. Because the proposed new specialty would administer certification under the ABVP umbrella, credentialing and examination requirements would be the same as for the current ABVP-recognized veterinary specialties of Avian Practice, Beef Cattle Practice, Canine and Feline Practice, Dairy Practice, Equine Practice, Feline Practice, Food Animal Practice, and Swine Health Management (www.abvp.com). The petition further indicates that there are more than 175 current members of the Association of Reptile and Amphibian Veterinarians who would pursue board certification in the ABVP Reptile and Amphibian Practice specialty once it were recognized.\n\nTwenty veterinary specialty organizations are recognized by the AVMA, and of those, seven have recognized veterinary specialties (www.avma.org/reference/market stats/vetspec.asp). All AVMA-recognized specialty organizations and specialties comply with recognition guidelines outlined in the ABVS Policies and Procedures Manual, available online at www.avma.org/education/abvs/abvs_pp.asp. Refer to those guidelines when developing comments regarding the proposed specialty of Reptile and Amphibian Practice.\n\nComments must be signed and received no later than Nov. 1, 2008, by Dr. Beth Sabin, AVMA Education and Research Division, 1931 N. Meacham Road, Suite 100, Schaumburg, IL 60173-4360, or via e-mail at esabin@ avma.org. Questions regarding the recognition guidelines or the proposed new specialty may be directed to Dr. Sabin via e-mail or by phone, (800) 248-2862, Ext. 6675.\n\ncall out: Experts to teach summer course in foreign diseases\n\nThe University of WisconsinMadison School of Veterinary Medicine, in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, will host the 5th Biennial Foreign Animal Disease Training Course from Aug. 3–8, 2008, on the Madison campus.\n\nBuilding on successful courses offered in 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2006, the event will once again bring together U.S. and international experts to provide in-depth presentations and discussions on the recognition, diagnosis, and control of foreign animal diseases that threaten livestock industries. The FAD2008 course will include a daylong tabletop exercise on foreign animal disease incursion and control.\n\nThe course is designed for regulatory and public health veterinarians in government, animal disease regulatory specialists from industry, veterinary school educators, veterinarians in practice, and others interested in animal industry biosecurity and foreign animal diseases.\n\nSpace is limited, and previous courses filled up quickly. Visit www.vetmed.wisc.edu/pbs/courses/FAD2008 or contact the organizers at FAD2008@svm.vetmed.wisc.edu.\n\nAvian influenza flares up in India, more than a dozen other countries\n\nThe worst outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza ever to hit India, the world's second most populous country, refocused international attention on the virus early this year.\n\nThe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization stated that recent H5N1 outbreaks in 15 countries demonstrate that the zoonotic disease remains a global threat and requires close monitoring and strong control efforts.\n\nNew H5N1 outbreaks occurred between December 2007 and late January 2008 in Bangladesh, Benin, China, Egypt, Germany, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Myanmar, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and Vietnam. Most of the outbreaks occurred in domestic poultry—including chickens, turkeys, geese, and ducks—except for a few cases involving wild birds in China, Poland, and the United Kingdom.\n\n“Globally, much progress has been achieved in keeping the H5N1 avian influenza virus under control. We are better prepared today to deal with the disease than we were three years ago,” said Dr. Joseph Domenech, chief veterinary officer for the FAO. “Surveillance, early detection, and immediate response have improved, and many newly infected countries have managed to eliminate the virus from poultry.\n\n“But the H5N1 avian influenza crisis is far from over and remains particularly worrying in Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Egypt—where the virus has become deeply entrenched despite major control efforts.”\n\nAccording to the FAO, countries should continue to keep a close eye on the evolving situation.\n\n“The virus has not become more contagious to humans but has managed to persist in parts of Asia, Africa, and probably Europe,” Dr. Domenech said. “It could still trigger a human influenza pandemic.”\n\nAs of late January, India was struggling to control the H5N1 outbreak in the state of West Bengal—but the country had not reported any cases of human infection.\n\nIn Indonesia, almost all of the 33 provinces have experienced an H5N1 outbreak since 2004. The country recently reported its 100th fatal human infection.\n\n“We have observed that new H5N1 avian influenza virus strains have recently emerged in Indonesia, with the possible effect that vaccines currently in use may not be fully protecting poultry against the disease,” Dr. Domenech said. “This requires more investigations and the development of better poultry vaccines.”\n\nMany districts of Bangladesh have experienced H5N1 outbreaks. The situation seems to be worsening, according to the FAO, and Bangladesh borders West Bengal. According to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, Bangladesh protested India's previous attempts to fence off high-traffic sections of the porous border.\n\nEgypt has stepped up its fight against the virus, Dr. Domenech said, but recent outbreaks indicate a need for stronger control efforts.\n\nAs of Feb. 5, the World Health Organization had recorded 359 cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza—including 226 fatalities. The WHO just launched the Influenza Virus Tracking System, an online database to track H5N1 viruses that countries have shared via the Global Influenza Surveillance Network and the selection of viruses for vaccine development. The interim version is at www.who.int/fluvirus_tracker.\n\nAVMA backs proposal strengthening horse transportation regulations\n\nThe AVMA is supporting an amendment to commercial transportation regulations that would extend federal protections afforded to “equines” bound for slaughter.\n\nIn the Nov. 7, 2007, Federal Register, the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service proposed adding a definition of “equine for slaughter” among other changes to the regulations (9 CFR part 88) implementing the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act. The current regulations protect equines moved directly via commercial transportation to slaughter facilities but not equines bound for slaughter but moved first to an assembly point, feedlot, or stockyard.\n\nTo close that loophole, the agency is proposing to amend the regulations by adding a definition of “equine for slaughter” as “any member of the Equidae family being transferred to a slaughter facility, including an assembly point, feedlot, or stockyard.”\n\nAs the regulations are currently written, equines sold as slaughter horses may be transported first to an assembly point in a double-deck trailer without any of the other protections afforded by the regulations, such as receiving adequate water and food prior to loading. “We believe that equines may be delivered to these intermediate points en route to slaughter for the sole purpose of avoiding compliance with the regulations,” APHIS wrote.\n\nIf the amendment were approved, double-deck trailers could no longer be used to ship horses destined for slaughter to intermediate collection points. Transporting horses directly to slaughter establishments via double-deckers has been banned since Dec. 7, 2006. Current regulations, however, allow the trailers to be used when shipping slaughter horses to assembly points, feedlots, and stockyards.\n\nIn its comments supporting the amendment, the AVMA stated that the added definition makes the regulations more consistent with the intent of the law than the current regulations do. Additionally, the Association supported the doubledeck trailer ban because available scientific data indicate current double-decker trailer configurations cannot adequately house taller horses.\n\nFurther clarification of “Wildlife-livestock interactions” policy\n\nIn reading a May 15, 2007, JAVMA News article titled “Wildlifelivestock interactions policy adopted,” the AVMA Committee on Environmental Issues identified inadequacies in certain background statements that accompanied the new policy. Subsequently, a Jan. 1, 2008, JAVMA News article reported that the Executive Board approved another recommendation from the entity that originated the policy—the Animal Agriculture Liaison Committee—to reaffirm it, and that the CEI joined the AALC in affirming and supporting the policy.\n\nThe CEI chair believes, however, that a further clarification is in order. That committee's memo of support for the policy included a caveat that statements in the policy background as previously worded and reported in JAVMA had not been made with the benefit of all available information on the subject. Those statements involved the sensitivity of bighorn sheep to largescale die-offs, their susceptibility to Mannheimia haemolytica, and domestic and bighorn sheep interactions.\n\nGranstrom to head AVMA Education and Research Division\n\nThe AVMA has hired Dr. David E. Granstrom, currently an associate director at the Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service, as director of the Education and Research Division. He is expected to begin his work at the AVMA this March.\n\nDr. Granstrom's responsibilities as division director will include overseeing and helping formulate the AVMA's policies, objectives and programs concerning education, research, accreditation of veterinary schools and colleges, certification of graduates of foreign colleges of veterinary medicine, and veterinary medical specialties.\n\n“It is difficult to imagine anything more important to the profession than ensuring the transfer of new and existing knowledge to the next generation of veterinarians. I welcome the opportunity to serve the profession in this critical capacity,” Dr. Granstrom said. “My primary goal is to work collaboratively with stakeholders and AVMA staff to help ensure a bright future for the profession and those we serve.”\n\nDr. Granstrom is returning to the AVMA after seven years with the USDA. He previously was an assistant director of the AVMA Education and Research Division from 1997–2001.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Granstrom was a professor of parasitology at the Maxwell H. Gluck Equine Research Center at the University of Kentucky from 1988–1997. He has also served as an environmental health officer for the U.S. Air Force Biomedical Science Corps and public health officer with the Kentucky Air National Guard Biomedical Science Corps.\n\n“Dave … has an impressive background in practice, academia, research, private business, and government. His broad base of experience and knowledge of AVMA will serve him very well as our new division director,” said Dr. Ron DeHaven, AVMA executive vice president.\n\nDr. Granstrom received his DVM degree in 1978 from Kansas State University, where he later earned a Ph.D. degree in parasitology.\n\ncall out: AVMA Congressional Advocacy Network seeking volunteers\n\nThis year could be an important one in Congress for the veterinary profession.\n\nAt press time, the Farm Bill was in conference committee. Also, Congress has not fully funded the National Veterinary Medical Services Act, a tuition repayment program for veterinarians who work in shortage areas.\n\nTo promote passage and implementation of these and other pieces of legislation, the AVMA is working to attract many more volunteers into the AVMA Congressional Advocacy Network.\n\nChristine Baker, grassroots manager at the AVMA Governmental Relations Division in Washington, D.C., said the goal of AVMA-CAN is to have members in every congressional district—with a volunteer to coordinate each district's grassroots efforts. The AVMA asks volunteers to get to know their members of Congress and to serve as a local link to veterinary medicine for these legislators.\n\n“There may be veterinarians out there who already have existing friendships with members of Congress, and we need to know that. We need veterinarians who are willing to become the veterinary contact person for their senators and representatives,” Baker said.\n\n“There is a minimal time commitment—perhaps 30 minutes to make an important telephone call—and the GRD will supply background information to quickly bring each of our champions up to speed. We're also asking all our AVMA-CAN volunteers to visit their members of Congress when they are in their home districts to help foster a stronger relationship.”\n\nInformation is available by contacting Baker at (800) 321-1473, Ext. 3206, or cbaker@avma.org. Veterinarians can sign up for the Action E-List—which sends e-mail alerts when veterinarians' involvement can make a difference—by visiting www.avma.org, then clicking on “Get Involved” and “AVMA Congressional Advocacy Network.”\n\nAVMA goes live on YouTube\n\nOn Jan. 9, the AVMA went live on YouTube, the popular video-sharing Web site where users can upload, view, and share video clips. Viewers will find 14 clips from the AVMA career video, “Veterinary Medicine: It's More than You Think,” at www.youtube.com/AmerVetMedAssn. By early February, clips had been viewed about 2,250 times, with the food animal practitioner clip the most popular, followed by the one on small animal veterinary technicians. Feedback has been positive.\n\nThe clips were also reformatted for the AVMA Press Room Media Library, accessible from www.avma.org. Work has also begun on the AVMA's new strategic TV channel on the Internet, and it is anticipated that will be operational in a couple months. The strategic TV channel will be a custom-designed, dedicated Web site featuring videos and other multimedia products pertaining to the veterinary profession.\n\nDr. Kimberly May, AVMA assistant director for professional and public affairs, is coordinating these projects.\n\nFDA reaches final conclusion that food from animal clones is safe\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has issued final documents concluding that meat and milk from clones of cattle, swine, and goats—and from the offspring of clones—is as safe to eat as food from more conventionally bred animals.\n\nIn January, the FDA issued final versions of three documents outlining the agency's regulatory approach to animal cloning—a risk assessment, a risk management plan, and guidance for industry. The agency released drafts of the documents in December 2006 for public comment. In the intervening year, the FDA updated the risk assessment to include new scientific information. The information reinforces the conclusions of the draft documents regarding food safety, according to the agency.\n\nIn 2001, U.S. producers agreed to refrain voluntarily from introducing meat or milk from clones or clone offspring into the food supply until the FDA could evaluate the issue. Now, the Department of Agriculture is asking U.S. producers to maintain the existing voluntary moratorium until the USDA can consult stakeholders to ensure a smooth market transition.\n\nThe FDA is not requiring labeling or any other additional measures for food from clones of cattle, swine, and goats—or from clone offspring—because the agency has determined that food from these sources is no different than food from conventionally bred animals. If producers express a desire for voluntary labeling, the FDA will consider requests on a case-by-case basis to ensure compliance with statutory requirements for truth in labeling.\n\nBecause producers probably will keep most clones for breeding, the FDA does not expect clones to enter the food supply in any substantial numbers. Instead, clone offspring would be a more likely source of meat and milk for the marketplace. The agency deemed food from the offspring of clones of any traditional food animals to be suitable to enter the food supply.\n\nThe FDA continues to recommend that producers not introduce food from clones of species other than cattle, swine, and goats into the food supply. The agency did not reach a conclusion on the safety of food from clones of other animals, such as sheep, because of insufficient information.\n\nThe FDA's risk management plan outlines measures that the agency has taken to address the risks that cloning poses to animal health— risks that also exist to a lesser extent with other assisted reproductive technologies. The agency is working with scientific and professional societies with expertise in animal health and reproduction to develop standards of care for animals in the cloning process.\n\nAdditional information is available at www.fda.gov/cvm/cloning.htm.\n\nUSDA releases reports on animal health\n\nThe Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service recently released several reports relevant to production animals, including the 2006 U.S. Animal Health Report and reports from the Swine 2006 and Dairy 2007 studies.\n\nThe Animal Health Report provides an overview of the health of livestock, poultry, and aquaculture populations in the United States. The report addresses the many components of the U.S. animal health infrastructure; approaches to disease surveillance, control, and eradication; animal population demographics; and new initiatives.\n\nThe report describes notable epidemiologic events during 2006, such as a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The 2006 report includes a new chapter about animal health research at the USDA and at U.S. veterinary colleges. Another new chapter focuses on the USDA's international programs to safeguard and improve animal and human health globally.\n\nThe Animal Health Report is available at www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health.\n\nThe APHIS National Animal Health Monitoring System produced the Swine 2006 and Dairy 2007 studies. The studies serve as a basis of information for education and research programs.\n\nThe initial report from the swine study is “Part I: Reference of Swine Health and Management Practices in the United States, 2006.” Seventeen states, accounting for 94 percent of the U.S. swine inventory, participated in the study.\n\nThe initial report from the dairy study is “Part I: Reference of Dairy Cattle Health and Management Practices in the United States, 2007.” Seventeen states, accounting for 82.5 percent of the nation's dairy cows, participated in the study.\n\nThe reports are available at http://nahms.aphis.usda.gov under “Current Projects.”\n\nEquine veterinarians continue to advance horse health\n\nThe 53rd Annual Convention of the American Association of Equine Practitioners, held Dec. 1–5 in Orlando, Fla., set a convention attendance record for the second year in a row, as 7,238 veterinary professionals, guests, and exhibitors participated. The previous attendance record of 6,842 was set in 2006.\n\nEquine surgeon Dr. Dean Richardson opened the conference with a talk specifically for equine practitioners recalling his treatment of Barbaro, the 2006 Kentucky Derby winner whose life was tragically cut short by a racing injury.\n\nThe conference's keynote speaker was Connie Podesta, a life balance coach and media personality. Podesta offered a motivational presentation about balancing career with personal life, a topic requested by the AAEP Lifestyles Task Force.\n\nThe Frank J. Milne State-of-theArt Lecture, “From a sperm's eye view: Revisiting our perception of this intriguing cell,” was delivered by worldrenowned reproduction specialist and AAEP member, Dr. Dickson Varner.\n\nFrom nutrition and dealing with infectious diseases to practice management and cutting-edge surgical techniques, the wide array of CE sessions reflected the requests of AAEP members, according to 2007 Program Chair Dr. Eleanor M. Green. Dr. Green was named the 2008 AAEP president; see her profile on page 670.\n\nNew this year were a preconvention equine herpesvirus symposium and a media training session.\n\n“Dr. Eleanor Green and the Educational Programs Committee put together another great meeting program for our members,” said David L. Foley, AAEP executive director.\n\nThe Kester News Hour changed formats this year, with Drs. Scott Palmer, Bonnie Rush, and Margo Macpherson replacing Drs. John Madigan and Larry Bramlage at the news desk. Attendees listened to a series of fast-paced presentations on the latest scientific literature on equine medicine.\n\nThe annual live and silent auctions held during the AAEP Foundation Celebration and the Welcome Reception raised more than $125,000. The funds will go toward programs benefiting horses.\n\nIn addition, several awards were presented during the President's Luncheon on Dec. 4 (see page 673 for story.)\n\nBarbaro's veterinarian recalls time with famed racehorse\n\nEquine surgeon at the heart of months-long media firestorm\n\nBy his own admission, Dr. Dean Richardson is better at large animal surgery than public speaking. But as fate would have it, Dr. Richardson was thrust into the center of a months-long media frenzy over Barbaro, the 3-year-old colt whose dramatic 2006 Kentucky Derby win and tragic injury and death captivated a nation.\n\nOn Dec. 1, 2007, nearly a year after Barbaro was euthanized, Dr. Richardson spoke at the 53rd annual convention of the American Association of Equine Practitioners in Orlando about the lessons he learned while the horse was in his care. “It was an extraordinary privilege to even have the opportunity to be involved in this case,” he told the crowd.\n\nJust seconds into the Preakness Stakes in May 2006, Barbaro suffered a lateral condylar fracture of the cannon bone in his right hind limb. The pastern bone was shattered into more than 20 pieces, and he tore the intersesamoidean ligament. Barbaro was stabilized and transported from Baltimore to the University of Pennsylvania's New Bolton Center, where Dr. Richardson is the chief of surgery at the center's George D. Widener Hospital.\n\n“It was a complicated fracture, to say the least,” Dr. Richardson recalled. “The nature of the fracture … was such that it precluded certain options, I thought, such as external fixation and external skeletal fixation.” He placed 27 screws and a locking metal compression plate on the shattered limb, and a cast was set.\n\nAlong with trying to save Barbaro's life, Dr. Richardson found himself as a reluctant spokesman, explaining to the media as simply as he could how his team was treating the colt, and the its chances for survival. His main objective in these talks with the media was getting across just how different equine and human medicine are—a point often lost on many people, including medical doctors who thought they knew better how to treat the injury.\n\nLooking back, Dr. Richardson said the surgery was the least complicated part of the experience. “That's the part I do a lot. It's the part I'm best at,” he said. “What you're not prepared for is … the press coverage.” He then showed the audience a photo of a standing-room-only press conference at the New Bolton Center.\n\n“I'm not sure you can prepare yourself to speak to that many reporters. I prepared myself to tell the truth and be very aware that you may have to repeat yourself and speak very simple and keep on point. Those were my only real goals,” Dr. Richardson explained.\n\nFor the eight months Barbaro was in his care, Dr. Richardson essentially lived under a microscope; his every treatment decision was scrutinized and secondguessed by veterinarians and many others following the case. “Having your post-operative radiographs show up all over the world, and having people calling from Hong Kong, Italy, and wherever else, is a little bit daunting,” he said.\n\nBarbaro was recovering nicely the first six weeks following the surgery. The surgical site was free from infection; moderate doses of phenylbutazone allowed Barbaro to stand on the fractured limb comfortably. His time in the equine recovery pool was also going well. Although he knew better, Dr. Richardson couldn't help feeling optimistic about the colt's chances.\n\n“I knew all the problems were not going to be addressed in the first eight weeks. I've done this long enough to know that. I explained that to the media as emphatically as I could,” he said. “But if you're human, you still get your hopes up. Mine were up because he was doing so well at that point.”\n\nThen, in early July, Barbaro started favoring the injured limb. The fixation had begun showing signs of instability, so the decision was made to operate to replace a bent screw. Looking back, Dr. Richardson believes this choice ultimately led to Barbaro's death. “If you're going to put one moment that probably led to the failure of the case, it is probably this instance,” he said.\n\nUp until that point, the surgical site was healthy, Dr. Richardson explained. After the second surgery, however, sepsis set in, necessitating a third surgery to clean the area and repair the joint. The day he knew Barbaro was in trouble was when he had trouble waking from anesthesia used to place him safely into the recovery pool. Usually Barbaro revived quickly, but not that day. “That was a very long and pretty heartbreaking day because I was pretty sure we were in big trouble at this point,” Dr. Richardson recalled.\n\nShortly afterward, Barbaro started having problems with his left hind quarter—problems, as it turned out, that were caused by laminitis. Dr. Richardson knew the hoof was lost, so he had a heart-to-heart talk with Barbaro's owners, Roy and Gretchen Jackson.\n\n“I told them things were very, very bad here, that this was catastrophic in every sense, and there's just no getting around it,” Dr. Richardson said, suggesting that it might be time to end his struggle. “Frankly, none of us could do it, because we were standing in front of his stall and he was there looking like he didn't have a care in the world. We all voted, but Barbaro had the last vote, and we decided to press on.”\n\nWith the decision made, Dr. Richardson resected the hoof on the infected limb. “You have to keep in mind,” he noted, “the whole time we're dealing with his left hind foot, it's not like we have a normal right hind leg.”\n\nDr. Richardson showed a video shot in August 2006, nearly four weeks after the hoof resection surgery, of Barbaro walking a short distance outside to eat grass, something he did through the fall. “He was a fairly happy horse. Certainly at this point, we didn't think there was any compelling reason not to continue on.”\n\nFractures from the original injury had healed well enough that the cast could finally come off. Barbaro was able to bear full weight on the limb comfortably for more than a month. Barbaro's comfort diminished progressively, however, when a severe solar abscess developed in his right hind foot. To make matters worse, the left hoof deteriorated even further and his front limbs foundered. That was when the hard decision was made to euthanize Barbaro.\n\nDr. Richardson said he is often asked: Why did you go on? For a horse confined to a stall, Barbaro had a reasonably good quality of life much of the time. The colt had companions, such as Mocha, a cow that had a rumenotomy at the center. He received lots of attention and treats; Mrs. Jackson brought him fresh grass every day.\n\nSo, what did Dr. Richardson learn from his time with Barbaro? Primarily, people who know nothing about equine medicine thought they could save Barbaro. Many of the countless suggestions he received bordered on the bizarre. It was recommended, for instance, that the colt drink water from various holy shrines as well as the Jordan River and soak his injured limb in Atlantic Ocean water. Dr. Richardson also received letters with pages torn from 19th century medical books and even pages from James Herriot books.\n\nAll of these made him realize that one cannot overemphasize what equine veterinarians do is different from other types of medicine.\n\nIt wasn't all criticism, however. Dr. Richardson also saw that people can be very compassionate. Thousands of dollars were donated to the Barbaro Fund. The fences surrounding the New Bolton Center were plastered with get well posters, and baskets of carrots for Barbaro and treats for the staff came in on a daily basis. “The outpouring of affection was staggering,” he said. “It was really, really amazing. Most of the people who wrote in weren't horse owners.”\n\n—R. SCOTT NOLEN\n\nAs AAEP president, Green makes member outreach a priority\n\nPartnerships critical to success, academician says\n\nDr. Eleanor M. Green is an unintentional trailblazer. Not only is she the first woman to chair the University of Florida's Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, but in December 2007, Dr. Green became the first female president of the American Association of Equine Practitioners, the world's largest professional organization dedicated to equine veterinary medicine.\n\nAbout such accomplishments Dr. Green is nonchalant. She'd much rather talk about what she hopes to achieve as AAEP president, such as helping members strike a balance between their career and personal life.\n\n“They have a lot of questions today about lifestyle,” Dr. Green said. “How do we deal with the changing demographics of our members? How do we deal with generational preferences? How do we make sure equine practice is appealing to the new generation and to the more mature generation as well? How do we serve both sets of members?”\n\nLike much of the veterinary profession, equine veterinary medicine is undergoing major gender and generational changes. Forty percent of the 9,000 AAEP members are women—a percentage sure to increase since 75 percent of new veterinary graduates are women.\n\nThat outreach to members, along with all other AAEP initiatives, requires forging partnerships among academia, private practitioners, industry, and government, according to Dr. Green. “One of the waves of the future is partnerships and collaborations in all facets of what we do,” she explained, adding that her years in academia have equipped her with the experience to make those connections.\n\nThe Tampa, Fla., native began her career in veterinary academia shortly after receiving her DVM degree from Auburn University in 1973. Before joining the faculty at FSU, she taught at Mississippi State University, the University of Missouri-Columbia, and the University of Tennessee.\n\nHer extensive career in organized veterinary medicine also began at graduation. “No sooner did I become an AAEP member than I looked for ways to be active,” Dr. Green explained. She's served the association in various capacities, including as a district director, chair of the Internship and Student Relations Committee, and chair of the AAEP Foundation's Student Scholarship Task Force.\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Green has been president of the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners and American Association of Veterinary Clinicians.\n\n“Dr. Green brings many terrific qualities to the AAEP presidency—enthusiasm, an unmatched work ethic, and most importantly, the desire to do what is best for the horse,” observed David L. Foley, AAEP executive director.\n\nDr. Green's passion for horses extends beyond her professional life. She is a longtime Quarter Horse enthusiast and has competed in numerous events. Dr. Green will compete again when her tenure as president ends in December.\n\nAnother goal of Dr. Green's presidency is to follow one of the AAEP's strategic goals of increasing the association's student members. “We're a lot more connected to the student groups, but we're not quite there yet,” Dr. Green said. “We need to continue building relations with student chapters and especially the advisers.”\n\nOther officers\n\nJoining Dr. Green on the AAEP Executive Committee are Drs. Harry W. Werner, North Granby, Conn., president-elect; Nat White II, Leesburg, Va., vice president; Doug Corey, Adams, Ore., immediate past president; and R. Reynolds Cowles Jr., Free Union, Va., treasurer.\n\n—R. SCOTT NOLEN\n\nSurvey asks how pet owners will respond to an economic downturn\n\nIn an uncertain economy, pet owners say they are far more likely to curtail spending on luxury items and electronics—and even groceries and household goods—than on care or supplies for their companion animals.\n\nThe finding is from a December survey of 665 pet owners, including 602 people who owned a dog or cat, by Fleishman-Hillard International Communications. Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations firm that works with animal care companies, released survey results in late January during the North American Veterinary Conference.\n\nSurvey respondents said they would be most likely to cut back on pet fashions, toys, and the services of pet walkers, sitters, and groomers if they had to curtail spending on their pets.\n\nNevertheless, nearly a third of the respondents said they might cut back on veterinary visits and preventive medicine if they faced financial constraints.\n\n“The key to preventing this shift—and its detrimental effects on pets—will be client education,” said Doug Bell, Fleishman-Hillard senior vice president.\n\n“We know that veterinarians' recommendations carry the greatest weight with pet owners when making decisions about their pets. If a recession hits in 2008, veterinarians and their in-clinic teams will need to take the time to remind clients that ongoing, preventive care is as vital to their pets' health and safety as it is to the two-legged members of their family.”\n\nMore than a third of states have pet lemon laws\n\nLemon laws aren't just for automobiles in some states. As of late 2007, 18 states had passed lemon laws to provide legal recourse to people who purchase animals from pet dealers only to discover that the animals have a disease or defect. In early 2008, several more states already had proposed similar laws.\n\nA chart listing the key provisions of the existing pet lemon laws is now available on the AVMA Web site. States with this type of law include Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia.\n\nUnder the various laws, the amount of time that a purchaser has to make a claim ranges from seven to 20 days for illness or injury and 10 days to two years for congenital or hereditary conditions. Common remedies include replacement of the animal, a refund of the purchase price, and reimbursement of veterinary expenses—generally up to the purchase price of the animal.\n\nSeveral of the pet lemon laws require dealers to maintain records on the health and disposition of each animal at the time of sale. The laws do not address what happens to the animals that dealers replace, however.\n\nThe summary of pet lemon laws is at www.avma.org/advocacy/state/issues/ under “Animal welfare.” The actual text of the law in a particular state is available by contacting Tara Madson, state policy analyst, AVMA State Legislative and Regulatory Affairs Department; phone, (800) 248-2862, Ext. 6779; tmadson@avma.org.\n\nnews update: Company reaches $3.1 million settlement for aflatoxin contamination\n\nDiamond Pet Foods has agreed to a $3.1 million settlement in a lawsuit relevant to product contamination that apparently led to illness and deaths of dogs in late 2005.\n\nThe dogs had eaten Diamond products that contained aflatoxin, a toxic byproduct of the growth of certain fungi on corn and other food crops. The company issued a broad recall of the suspect products at the time (see JAVMA, Feb. 1, 2006, page 334).\n\nThe recent legal settlement, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee at Knoxville, provides for Diamond to pay a total of up to $3.1 million to customers who purchased products subject to the recall and to pet owners whose dogs sustained injury from eating the company's products.\n\nCustomers who did not return products subject to recall can still receive a refund for up to two bags of food. Pet owners who incurred veterinary bills as a result of Diamond products can receive reimbursement for aflatoxin-specific testing and treatment, not to exceed $200 for testing or $1,000 for testing and treatment. Pet owners whose dogs died can receive a payment for the market value of the animal, not to exceed $1,000.\n\nDiamond and its insurance company already had resolved about 1,200 claims for compensation for products, veterinary bills, and pet deaths prior to the settlement.\n\nAdditional information and claim forms are available by calling (800) 960-6651 or visiting www.recalled petfoodsettlement.com. All claims must have a postmark of April 15 or earlier.\n\ncollege news: CSU building new home for veterinary laboratories\n\nColorado State University has begun building a new Diagnostic Medicine Center south of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital.\n\nThe $42 million center will house the CSU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Clinical Pathology Laboratory, and Animal Population Health Institute. Construction of the 90,000-square-foot facility should be complete in December 2009.\n\nThe university's veterinary laboratory system was one of the earliest participants in the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which combines the capacity of federal laboratories with the resources of state and university laboratories to enhance response to animal health emergencies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved CSU laboratories to test for exotic Newcastle disease, avian influenza, scrapie, chronic wasting disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, classical swine fever, and foot and mouth disease.\n\nThe CSU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and Clinical Pathology Laboratory also provide services to owners of companion animals, owners of production animals, and state government agencies such as the Colorado Division of Wildlife.\n\nThe CSU Animal Population Health Institute promotes the exchange of information and expertise in veterinary epidemiology among scientists at the university, collaborating institutions, and government agencies throughout the world.\n\nThe Diagnostic Medicine Center also will house the veterinary extension office.\n\nRehabilitation veterinarians form association\n\nThe American Association of Rehabilitation Veterinarians has formed and will be holding its first annual meeting from Aug. 13–16 in Minneapolis.\n\nMost of the 40 current members are in private practice, while five members work at universities. The secretary and founder, Dr. Julia Tomlinson, owns Twin Cities Animal Rehabilitation Clinic in Burnsville, Minn.\n\nDr. Tomlinson said the rehabilitation of animals is a growing business, involving veterinarians and nonveterinarians. In addition to clinics that provide specialty surgery and rehabilitation, an increasing number of clinics focus solely on rehabilitation. Providing rehabilitation as part of mainstream practice permits veterinarians to take a central role in case management.\n\nThe goals of the AARV are to help advance rehabilitation in veterinary medicine, increase public awareness of veterinary rehabilitation, and allow rehabilitation veterinarians to meet and discuss aspects of continuing education. Dr. Tomlinson said recent scientific articles have reported the advantage of rehabilitation in recovery from orthopedic surgery and in management of chronic arthritis. New guidelines from the American Animal Hospital Association recognize the role of rehabilitation in pain management protocols.\n\nDr. Sherman O. Canapp Jr. is serving as the current AARV president. The board members are Drs. Becky Paulekas, Julia Tomlinson, Sally Lane, and Rick Wall. Members will vote on officers at the first annual meeting. Members also will discuss an upcoming multicenter study on the effects of rehabilitation and creation of a Web site with information for the public.\n\nMore details about the AARV are available by e-mailing Dr. Tomlinson at drjulia@tcrehab.com.\n\nindustry initiatives: Petco raises $2.5 million for animal shelters\n\nThe 2007 Tree of Hope fundraiser by Petco and the Petco Foundation generated more than $2.5 million for animal shelters.\n\nThe 36-day campaign collected donations from the company's customers, vendors, and associates.\n\nEach Petco store raised funds on behalf of local animal welfare groups. Customers also could make donations on the company's Web site. Petco's partner in pet health insurance, PetCare Pet Insurance Programs through Pethealth Inc., contributed $5 for each policy that became active during the fundraiser.\n\nPetco encourages customers to consider adoption before the purchase of any companion animal. Petco stores offer adoption events, Adoption Gift Booklets with up to $150 in savings, and Think Adoption First resource centers.\n\naccolades\n\nAssociations\n\nDr. Henry J.
