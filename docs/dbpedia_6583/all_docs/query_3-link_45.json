Cooperative communities in the United States may be classified according to their aims rather than their achievements. They are of three kinds: (1) Communistic; (2) socialistic; (3) partially cooperative. The communistic are those which aim at the widest possible com­ munity of goods, and which seek to have both labor and income equally distributed among the members. The socialistic are those which aim at collective ownership of all the means of production, and at equitable rather than equal distribution. Averse to private capital, they are not averse to private property. Opposed to exploitation, they are not opposed to honest thrift. They would encourage industry and skill, and discourage laziness and inef­ ficiency. The partially cooperative communities are those which favor col­ lective ownership and action in some things and individual ownership and action in others, but wish for a larger degree of cooperation than is yet enjoyed by the community at large. In the practical workings of these communities, however, the differ­ ences are less pronounced. Sometimes the communistic in purpose are impelled, in the matter of distribution, to become socialistic in practice, while economic considerations often lead those socialistically inclined to more and more of communistic living. Thus the Zoarites, who at first were not even socialistic in their aims, but merely desired a more Christianized individualism, found them­ selves unable to make any adequate provision for the older and weaker among them, except by turning all private possessions into a common fund for the equal benefit of all. On the other hand, the Shakers, who started out as communists, in the widest sense of the word, so far 563 564 B U L L E T IN OF T H E DEPARTM ENT OF LA B O R . as property is concerned, soon restricted the application of the com­ munity principle within the limits of the family life. Thus the New Lebanon society h a s .4 families, or communes (it formerly had 7), each of which has its independent community or family life. Then again, some of the more recent communities have considerably changed their original plans, so that we have in the same community different aims at different times. These and other considerations render any exact classification out of the question. W h en the work of Nordhoff (a) was published in 1875 the total num­ ber of communistic societies was 11, counting, of course, the 18 Shaker societies, which included 58 communes, as one. Three of these, however, Mr. Nordhoff did not rank as entitled to a place among the successful communities, so that he counted only 8 societies, compris­ ing not less than 72 communes. These contained about 5,000 persons, including children. They held some 180,000 acres of land, and their wealth, M r. Nordhoff estimated, was not less than $12,000,000. This would have given, if equally divided, more than $2,000 dollars to each man, woman, and child. W hen M r. Hinds wrote, (i) in 1878, three of the communities mentioned by M r. Nordhoff had already lapsed, viz, the Bishop H ill Colony, the Cedar Yale Community, and the Social Freedom Community. Those remaining were Economy, Zoar, Bethel, Aurora, Amana, Icaria, Oneida and W allingford, the Shakers, and the Brotherhood of the New L ife. The last named, however, was not included in M r. NordhofPs list and can not properly be classed as even cooperative. O f all these, only the Shakers, the Amana Society, and a mere fragment of the Economists remain. Three of the Shaker societies and 22 of the families, or communes, have also passed away. Two small societies, however, have recently been formed, so that there are still 17 societies and 36 families. But there has been a steady decline in the number of members, taking the communities as a whole. M r. Nordhoff gives some account of one society, not communistic, at Silkville, or Prairie Hom e, Kans., and M r. Hinds names some 16 socialistic experiments then organized, or organizing, not one of which, so far as can be learned, is now existing. M r. Noyes’s H istory of American Socialisms (c) gives an account of 45 different experiments growing out of the Owen movement in the twenties and the Fourier movement in the forties, not one of which remains. A s near as we can judge from the facts obtained, the aver­ age life of these experiments was about two years. Nevertheless, a The Communistic Societies of the United States, by Charles Nordhoff.

It can not, however, be claimed, it is feared, that these later efforts give any greater promise of success than the earlier. Something more than a score of these are making a desperate struggle to get a foothold, or to resist the disintegrating influence of their unfriendly environment, but apparently with little prospect of desired success. These colonies are mostly of recent origin, with small membership and very meager resources. They have, therefore, as yet, but little in the way of achievement to relate. Their history, if they are to have a worthy one, is still to be made. Before giving any account of these, it will be worth while to give some attention to the old societies still in existence, and to a few of the more important ones that have recently passed out. (a) TH E SH AK ER S. O f all societies in this country ranked as communistic Shaker soci­ eties are the oldest, best organized, and, financially speaking, the most prosperous. Shakers report at present seventeen societies, scattered through nine States. Two, Mount Lebanon and W atervliet, are in New Y o rk ; three, Hancock, Harvard, and Shirley, in Massachusetts; one, Enfield, in Connecticut; two, Canterbury and Enfield, in New Hampshire; two, Alfred and New Gloucester, in Maine; three, Union Village, Whitewater, and W atervliet, in Ohio; two, Pleasanthill and South Union, in Kentucky; one, W hiteoak, in Georgia; and one, Narcoossee, in Florida. It is hardly proper, however, to count the two last mentioned, as they have recently been organized by members of Northern societies with a view of transferring the whole body to a more congenial clime, where they hope to be able to live more cheaply and support them­ selves without the employment of hired labor. They desire to sell their property in Mount Lebanon, N. Y ., or much of it, at least, and build up their home in the South with the proceeds. Two of the old societies, Groveland and Canaan, in New Y ork , have died out. a The author desires to acknowledge his indebtedness not only to the valuable and well-known works of Nordhoff, Noyes, and Hinds, but to excellent monographs by Charles Edson Robinson on the Shakers; by Professor Perkins, of the State Univer­ sity of Iowa, on the Amana Society; and by Mr. E. 0. Randall, secretary of the Ohio Historical Society, on the Zoar Society. He is also much indebted to Mr. Charles M. Skinner, of the Brooklyn Eagle, for a series of articles published in that paper, the result of an investigation cotemporaneous with this; and to the officials of the various organizations who have been uniformly courteous and obliging. 566 B U L L E T IN ,0 F THE DEPARTM ENT OF L A B O R . Shaker societies are usually composed of two or more “ families” or communes, which range in number from a very few to a hundred or more, comprising both sexes and all ages. These families are practi­ cally independent of each other as to property and business interests. The principle of communism holds in their organization only within the limits of the family. It does not apply to the families as constit­ uents of the society nor to the societies as related to the whole body of Shakerdom. In any given society made up of two or more families one family may have much more wealth per capita than another. A like inequality exists, of course, among the societies. In some cases certain families agree to extend the principle and hold their property in common as do three families, we are told, at Pleasanthill, K y . But the rule is that each family manages its own business affairs, and profits or suffers as the management is good or bad. The claim is that the property is more easily managed by such division; that it tends to wider development of individual talents and creates a larger number of capable and responsible men and women. In case of calamity, however, by fire or flood or tempest, all are expected to help according to means. I f, through bad management, any family gets into straitened circumstances it is helped by those more prosper­ ous, according to ability, until the management is changed. But however great this spirit of helpfulness may be it does not pre­ vent some families and some societies from having much more wealth than others. Shakerism, therefore, is only a modified communism and really carries the principle, so far as its organization is concerned, only a little beyond that practiced in the general family life o f the world. Its families are larger and there is more of cooperation among them than in the life of the world, but the full effects of the principle do not extend to the body as a whole, nor to all of the mem­ bers. Indeed, a recent letter from one of the members says: u W e are not even, strictly speaking, a community. W e are, fundamentally and primarily, a church; a body of people united together for a spir. itual purpose. Only secondarily and incidentally are we communistic. Our communism, such as it is, is only incidental to our main object, which is a spiritual one, and it is this fact which differentiates us from all other attempts at communism on this continent.” The writer quoted ventures the opinion that in all other colonies the main object is material, and “ those who take part are governed solely by the motive o f self-interest,” while the Shakers are banded together for a spiritual purpose. This view, undoubtedly, not only does injustice to some other movements, but somewhat exaggerates the spiritual merits o f the Shakers. Certainly something of this higher purpose has been pro­ fessed, and in good degree manifested, by several other communities in this country; and Shakers have not always been so loyal to their fundamental aim that they can safely make such claims. One of their C O O P E R A T IV E COM M UNITIES IN TH E U N IT E D ST A TE S. 567 leading members writes: 44 I f we have so far deviated from the foun­ dation principles of our faith as to make that [the piling of wealth] our object, it has invariably been productive of disaster, spiritual and temporal blight, and when success seemed already achieved, loss and disaster ‘ followed fast and followed faster,’ large sums having been lost on bad investments, or by swindling operators.” This confession serves to show that however steadily the current of high purpose has swept on in the stream of the Shaker life, there have been eddies here and there where the movement was pretty strongly in an opposite direction. ORIGIN AND E A R L Y HISTORY. The Shakers trace their origin to the Camisards, or French prophets, who figured in the early part of the eighteenth century. The move­ ment of which these people were the center spread rapidly to other countries, and notably in England. Some Friends, or Quakers, came under their influence and organized a society of which James and Jane W ardley, a very devout couple, were the leaders. So violent were the agitations and tremblings which seized these people during their meetings that they came to be called the 44 Shaking Quakers,” and later 44 Shakers.” Ann Lee and her parents were among those who were drawn into the society. H er father was a blacksmith, as was the man Stanley, whom she subsequently married, and to whom she bore four children, all of whom died in infancy. It is worth while to note here as having some bearing, perhaps, on the loss of the children, and on the view of marriage which she afterwards made central in her religious system, that she is said to have had from childhood a strong repugnance to the married state, and only consented to enter into it at the urgent and persistent solicitation of her friends. Though wholly illiterate, never being able to read or write, Ann Lee had qualities of mind and heart which brought her rapidly to the front and caused her to share in the persecutions then being visited upon her people. In 1770, while in prison, she claimed to have had a great revelation, especially as to the nature of the sin which was the cause of man’s alleged fall, and the necessity of the celibate life as the first and indispensable step to his spiritual recovery. In 1773, having been released from prison, she had another revelation, by which she was instructed to repair to America, being assured that 44there the Second Christian Church” — that is, the Church of Ann Christ, the first being that of Jesus Christ— 44 would be established,” that the colonies would gain their independence, and 44 complete liberty of conscience be secured to all people.” She was obedient to the 44 vision,” and with eight others, selected from the congregation, sailed from Liverpool for New Y ork M ay 19, 1774. W ith the departure of 568 B U L L E T IN OF T H E DEPARTM ENT OF L A B O R . this little band Shakerism soon ceased to exist in England and has never since revived. Ann and her company landed in New Y o rk August 6, 1774. A year or so after her arrival her husband, who was not in sympathy with the kind or measure of holiness insisted on by Ann, left the order and took up with another woman, dissolving the marriage ties that bound him to u M o th e r” Ann. About 1776 one of the company, who was possessed of considerable means, purchased a section of land near Albany, in a wilderness called Niskayuna, but now known as Watervliet. Here, in comparative seclusion, the believers lived a celibate life, holding all possessions in common, and working indus­ triously to improve their surroundings and provide a comfortable subsistence, not only for themselves, but for those whom Mother Ann assured them would soon come to swell their numbers. In 1779 a religious revival, which aroused converts to a great pitch of excitement, led a company of those who were looking for the second coming of the Christ to visit the little Shaker settlement to learn if they knew aught of his appearance. Mother Ann met and welcomed them as expected guests and colaborers with her in the work to which she had devoted her life. Though several of these visitors were young peo­ ple betrothed to each other in marriage, “ all of the company became disciples of Ann Lee and remained faithful believers through life .” They accepted celibacy and communism, together with a belief in the Fatherhood of God as revealed in Jesus Christ, and a belief in the Motherhood of God as revealed in Ann Christ. So M other Ann was to them Christ’s second coming, and Shakerism became a fixed insti­ tution in the community, and the first communistic society established in America. Its history covers a period of a century and a quarter. The Shakers came to America during the exciting times preceding the Revolution. Being foreigners, their avowed hostility to war, their refusal to take the oath of allegiance or to enter the A rm y, naturally brought them under suspicion. In 1780 all the elders and leaders were arrested and imprisoned, but afterwards set at liberty by order of Governor Clinton. The course pursued drew attention to the body, created sympathy with its purposes, and added largely to its numbers, and the leaders returned to find it more prosperous than when they left. So greatly did the spirit of devotion to M other Ann and her mission grow among the new converts that most of them went back to their homes and became missionaries of the new faith. This, together with the labors of the leaders as they traveled and preached, soon caused societies to spring up in several of the States. The death of Mother Ann in 1784 seemed only to bind the members together more closely and to call out talents of leadership and admin­ istration in others. James W hittaker, Joseph Meacham, and Lucy W rig h t were all conspicuous for ability and wisdom in the work of C O O P E R A T IV E COMMUNITIES IN THE U N IT E D ST A TE S. 569 organizing the new body of converts, but especially was their wisdom shown in the emphasis laid on the following cardinal principles: 1. Purity in mind and body. 2. Honesty and integrity in thought and deed. 3. Humanity and kindness to friend and foe. 4. Diligence in business— meaning labor for the common weal, according to strength and ability— industrious, but not slavish, that all may be busy, peaceable, and happy. 5. Prudence and economy, temperance and frugality, without parsimony. 6. Absolute freedom from debt, owing no man anything but love and good will. 7. Education of children in scriptural, secular, and scientific knowledge. 8. A united interest in all things. 9. Am ple provision for all in health, sickness, and old age— a per­ fect equality— one household, one faith, practicing every virtue, shun­ ning every vice. W ith these principles as fundamental no one could join the order against whom any just debts were pending, and all who had wronged their fellows must make reparation as far as lay in their power. CLASSES OR ORDERS. The Shaker denomination in the United States is composed at pres­ ent of seventeen societies. Each of these, as we have seen, is divided into two or more families. But this division is simply for convenience and does not indicate the spiritual status of the member as related to the body. For this purpose there are three classes or orders: 1. The Novitiates.— These are such as come into a degree of relation with the society, but choose to live in their own families and manage their own temporal concerns. In spiritual matters they acknowledge the rule of the society, make confession of their sins, agree to live virgin lives, and to separate themselves from the ways of the world. So long as they do this they are in good standing and participate in such bless­ ings as the fellowship affords. 2. The Juniors.— These are persons who choose to come, temporarily at least, into the local community, agreeing by special contract to give their services freely in the interest, of the family of which they ate members so long as they continue. They agree, further, to make no claim for compensation should they withdraw, whether for service rendered or for the use of any property or monev which they allowed the family to enjoy. The property itself they may resume, according to the contract, at any time, but interest they can not claim. 570 B U L L E T IN OF T H E D E P A R T M E N T OF L A B O R . 3. The Seniors.— These are persons who, having served a period of probation and having found the faith and practice of the society accept­ able, decide to enter fully into “ a united and consecrated” interest. Such persons covenant and agree to devote themselves and all they possess, fully and* irrevocably, to the service of God, through this institution. This class constitutes what is called the church order. GOVERNMENT. The government is vested in a central executive board called the ministry. This is composed of four persons— two of each sex— and has jurisdiction over all the societies. Y et every organized community or family in a society has two elder brethren and two elder sisters, who have charge of the spiritual affairs, and two deacons and two deacon­ esses, who have charge of the temporalities. A ll other positions of care and trust are filled after the same dual order. The government, apart from this dual feature, which gives the female element direct representation, is modeled on the military system. Authority is transmitted from the head down, the inferior rank taking orders from the superior. Each officer reports to the one in authority next above him, and the head of the central ministry may depose any one of them, and even appoint his own successor. It is worthy of remark that despite the opportunity and temptation which this system would seem to offer for the exercise of arbitrary and despotic power, the men and women who have held rule in the Shaker body— during a period of more than a hundred years— have been uniformly regardful of the rights and interests of others, and have exercised their high office in the very spirit of H im who said, “ I f any among you would be great let him be your servant. I f he would be chief of all, let him be preeminent in service.” They realized that it was given to them to rule that they might be able the more effectually to serve. And they have accounted this opportunity for special service a peculiar privilege and joy. RELIGIOUS BELIEF AND FORM OF WORSHIP. The Shakers believe in and worship one God, “ the Alm ighty Creator of heaven and earth, the Fountain of eternal light, love, and goodness; one in essence, dual in principles; Father and Mother mani­ fested and expressed in humanity, and in all the beauties and sublimi­ ties o f the physical world.” To know the Divine W ill and W isdom , and to obey the law of righteousness and truth, in the Spirit of the Christ, as revealed in Jesus and Ann, is the professed aim of their daily life. Mother Ann taught, “ Put your hands to work, and give your hearts to G od .” “ To do this,” she said, “ in sincerity and truth is the essence o f worship.” W ith the Shakers the whole business of C O O P E B A T IV E COMMUNITIES IN TH E U N IT E D ST A TE S. life is to be pervaded and informed by this spirit. 571 Y et they attach much value to forms as preservative of the spirit. Hence they all kneel before and after eating, before retiring at night, and on rising in the morning. They meet often for social converse in small companies, and three or four times during the week in congregation, and redevote them­ selves to the spiritual life. They sing and march to tunes of different measure, and move their hands in a manner expressive of their desire to gather and appropriate the treasures of the spiritual realm. Some­ times the march changes to a peculiar sort of dance, which they say “ seems to quicken body and soul and to kindle anew the fire of truth.” B y the more violent shaking of the body they seek to express their hatred of all evil and to free themselves from all elements of worldly bondage. Their songs, hymns, and anthems are original, and written, the}^ claim, mostly under inspiration. They are all spiritualists in the sense of holding to the actuality of spirit communion. They profess, however, to have learned how to test or try the spirits, and so avoid the evils of promiscuous intercourse. They do not worship Ann Lee, as many suppose; nor do they worship Jesus. They give to both a high place in their thought and regard as types of the nobler man­ hood and womanhood of the “ New Creation.” The truth incarnated in them was not born with them; it existed before they perceived it and made it their own. W e can be helped by a belief in them only as we are helped to a like perception and appropriation of the truth incarnate in them. The Shakers attach great importance to an honest and full confession in the presence of a witness. The confession is not to man, but it must be in man’s hearing. They will admit no one, therefore, to their society unless he promises to make a full and complete confession of every evil transaction that lies within the reach of memory. They regard the acknowledgment of wrongdoing to elders of their own sex, appointed for the purpose, as the chief door of hope to the soul, and so they make this opportunity a permanent part of their institution. They affirm that the great mistake of the Catholic Church in this matter lies in not having for women confessors of their own sex, and that the dominion which the confessional gives the male priest over the woman carries with it a temptation which many have not been able to withstand. Ann Lee, in teaching the Motherhood in Deity, and in providing for woman a confessor of her own sex, took the first important step in the emancipation of woman from sexual thraldom. Each sex, it is affirmed, comprehends its own frailties, and in the Shaker family each has its spiritual advisers, between whom the law of virgin purity is maintained. Their attitude toward this law, the Shakers affirm, is not understood by the outside world, They have no desire, they say, to destroy or even to 572 B U L L E T IN OF TH E DEPAETM ENT OF L A B O E . hold a controversy with “ the institution of marriage properly main­ tained.55 But they do condemn prostitution, licensed or unlicensed, as a sin against God and the human race; a sin that is every day having its effect in manifold miseries of the people. “ A ll copulation, in or out of wedlock, except for offspring, at such times and under condi­ tions proper for offspring to result, is prostitution, condemned by the law of God and of nature.55 They hold that “ there are two orders, the earthly or generative order and the heavenly or virgin order.15 The first is on the natural the second on the spiritual plane. Those only who choose the latter follow the example of Christ. The Shaker attitude toward the Bible is that of the Liberal Church generally. It is valued for the good that it contains, not accepted as a final authority. It must not be used to silence reason or affection. Its noblest utterances are inspired only as like truths in other scrip­ tures are inspired. “ A ll scriptural records of holy life and teaching,55 they affirm, 44help to reveal the power and wisdom of God to man­ kind, and they should be preserved, studied, and brought to bear upon the life. To believe only in the Bible, and to hold controversies over that which it contains, availeth little; but to strive reverently, hon­ estly, and earnestly to learn its simple and holy lessons and to live by them continually is great wisdom.55 EXISTING COMMUNITIES, W IT H PURSUITS AND CUSTOMS. The first society was formed at Mount Lebanon, N. Y . , in 1787. It is the strongest as well as the oldest, and has seven families or separate communities, with a present membership of 120— 19 of whom are over 70 years of age, as many under 20, and 5 over 80. Prior to 1792 other societies had been formed in New Y ork , Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine. Between 1805 and 1807 two societies were formed in Ohio, one in Indiana, and two in Kentucky. Later— in the twenties— two more societies were formed in Ohio and one in New Y ork. A ll but three of these are still in existence, though the membership is less than one-fourth of what it was at one time, when it reached a total of nearly 6,000 souls. A ll these societies have large home farms, and many own large tracts of land in the W est and South. It is said that one family of one of the New Y ork societies bought a few years ago 30,000 acres in K en ­ tucky. These purchases were doubtless regarded as a wise and neces­ sary provision for the future, which it was believed would surely send thousands of the people into their ranks. But great as the economic pressure has been in recent years, it has not worked to the upbuilding of Shaker communities, and so their great landed estates have proven a burden. They cultivate but a small part of their large domains. Ordinary farming does not pay where all the work has to be done by hired help. They prefer, therefore, to let the land run to forest or COOPERATE E COM M UNITIES IN THE U N IT E D ST ATES. 573 rent it to others. Their agricultural labor is devoted to garden seeds, medicinal herbs, etc., which have yielded much better returns than more extensive farming, and are better suited to the tastes and habits of the community members. In addition to this they engage to a considerable extent in mechanical industries. They u manufacture brooms and measures, pails and tubs, chairs and mops, mats and sieves, washing machines, and chimney caps,” and a great many other things. They 44 put u p ” a variety of canned and bottled goods— corn, tomatoes, peaches, and other vegetables and fruits. They affirm 44the equality of the sexes in all honors, duties, rights, and privileges in mental and manual industry; for 4godliness doth not lead to idleness.’ W o r k improves the faculties, clarifies and invigorates mind and body. It disperses clouds, banishes fear, and supplies the elements of life, health, and cheer.” For the brethren there are agricultural, horticultural, and mechanical pursuits, and the raising and preparation of fruits and vegetables for market. F or the sisters there are duties of the household, the kitchen, and the laundry, where many conveniences and various kinds of machinery are found to lighten the toil. Then there are dressmaking and tailoring. Some families engage in shirt and cloak making, others in upholstering or chair making, and something is done also in the way of trade. But while it is the inflexible rule that all who are able shall work, there arc no arbitrary hours of labor. 44 W e are not wage slaves of a soulless corporation,” says one of their number. 44 W e all have a united interest to build up our communistic homes, where all share equally the blessings of existence. Although our duties are sometimes arduous, we know not of drudgery in the usual meaning of that term .” Though disapproving of the hireling system, they have found it impracticable to dispense with it wholly in the matter of farm work. They refuse, however, to employ household servants. For this reason they will take no boarders, nor will they accept the services of any who do not intend to join the community in lieu of cash payment for goods they may sell. A ll applicants for membership are met with the same conditions. Former wealth or poverty receives no considera­ tion. The Shaker family 44is not a charity institution, nor a home for invalids who come as such, with the idea of being supported and taken care of, but for world-tired souls, who come from conviction of sin and for the purpose of unfolding in the spiritual life; for these there is plenty of room, providing that such will exert themselves as far as they are able and capable to help in the family which they enter, seek the good of others, and strive to learn the way of self-denial, purity, and peace.” These families, as we have said, consist of both sexes and all ages. 44The sexes, however, occupy separate apartments (including those married who have become members), all in the same dwelling; both 574 B U L L E T IN OF T H E DEPARTM ENT OF L A B O R . sexes take meals at the same time, in the same hall, but at separate tables.” Some suppose that opposite sexes among the Shakers never commune together. “ Such persons,” says one of their writers, “ are mistaken.” “ W h ile we live absolute virgin lives, there is much free­ dom in the social sense between the sexes, but it is required to be free from all that would tend to carnal affections and actions. The power thus to live in purity and innocence is found in the conviction that a spotless, virgin, angelic life is the order of the kingdom of Christ, and is higher, better, happier, than a sensual, worldly life. W e are anti-Mormon and anti-Oneidan in faith and practice, as becomes the true followers of Christ. W e do not condemn marriage, nor orderly generation, as worldly institutions, but claim that these have no place in Christ9s K ingdom .” HYGIENE. It is essential to health, they affirm, that meals should be eaten at regular intervals. They breakfast at 6 (in the summer, half past 6 in the winter), dine at 12, and sup at 6. They eschew pork altogether, and use little meat of any kind. some families it is wholly discarded. In They prepare fruits, grains, and vegetables in a great variety of ways, and, as a rule, prefer bread made from whole wheat, corn, or oatmeal flour to that made from the bolted article. They use neither lard, tallow, nor any butter substi­ tutes in their cooking. Tea and coffee are used in moderation, but tobacco chewing, smoking, and snuff taking are prohibited. In many of the families the dwellings are steam heated, well drained, and pro­ vided with all modern conveniences. Shakers retire usually about 9, rise at 5 or half past 5, fold the bed­ clothes neatly and lay them over the backs of chairs, empty the slops, ventilate the rooms, and leave everything in readiness for the sisters, who come a little later to make up the beds, sweep, and dust. Hair and wire mattresses have largely displaced the old feather beds. The dress worn by Shaker women is si^nple, comfortable, and con­ venient. Corsets are discarded, and skirts are suspended from the shoulders. They have warm home-made shoes which fit, but do not cramp the feet, and are in every way so alive to health conditions that serious sickness is very rare among them, and the fevers that prevailed in the earlier days have been practically banished. Regular habits, pure water, pure air, plenty of sunshine, good drainage, and wholesome food, together with variety of occupation, have wrought great improvement in the general health. RECREATIONS. Travel to distant countries is only undertaken when in the interest of the community; but visiting sister families and societies and engag­ ing in excursions and picnics are often indulged in as a matter of healthful enjoyment and social recreation. C O O P E R A T IV E COMMUNITIES IN THE U N IT E D ST A TE S. 575 Other wholesome amusements, such as croquet and tennis, are com­ ing into favor. But the Shakers aim to keep out everything that is calculated to lead to mere dissipation of time and energy and to lower the moral tone of those indulging. Music, once tabooed, is coming to the front, though the old prejudice against instrumental music limits the use of the organ and piano to exercises not considered dis­ tinctively religious. These instruments are excluded from the house of worship. LITERATURE AND CORRESPONDENCE. There is a disposition to keep well informed upon topics of general interest, and especially upon matters of social reform. Many of the best papers and books, therefore, both secular and spiritual, are read in the different families. But as light and trashy literature and frivo­ lous correspondence are disallowed, all books, papers, and letters received or sent must be subject to the knowledge and approval of the elders. A ll elements of espionage are abjured, but the principles of the society demand openness and freedom to its leading authorities, for mutual confidence, union, and protection. Hence this by-law to guard against all secret organizations and cliques that might seek to corrupt and destroy the society: “ God is light, and those who dwell in God dwell in light and can have no need nor desire to conceal correspond­ ence from the leaders in the household of faith.” Children and youths are received, but always in obedience to certain rules. V ery young children are only taken in connection with their parents. None are taken who are physically deformed or who show a lack of mental or moral capacity. A ll who are taken are well instructed in the branches taught in the common schools, together with the reading of music and singing, but none are given a high school or college edu­ cation. A ll are taught to work and to earn their livelihood rather than to get it. Boys are trained in agricultural, horticultural, and mechanical employments; girls in household duties— knitting, sewing, dressmaking and mending, cooking, and cleaning. W hen parents come into the society with their children the latter are usually placed where they will have the companionship of other chil­ dren and have proper care and guardianship, but if not transferred parents are required to see that the rules are obeyed. Parents leav­ ing may take their children with them if they wish to. Parents leaving their children may visit them once a }jear, but not for more than two or three days. Occasional letters and answers are allowed, but anything calculated to cause discontent is forbidden. A small monthly sum is requested. No corporal punishment is permitted, nor any external violence allowed on any of its members. 11358— No. 35— 01------ 2 576 B U L L E T IN OF T H E DEPARTM ENT OF L A B O R . W H Y SHAKERS DO NOT VOTE. Shakers are averse to war and all violence. They feel that they can not consistently support by their votes a form of government which rests at last upon force, unless they are prepared to use force. Besides, party spirit, they affirm, is inseparable from party action. It fosters contention, engenders hatred and strife, and often develops into the most cruel and destructive wars. A s honorable citizens and members of society they discharge all just debts, pay their full share of the public taxes, and by just and ethical measures maintain peace and unity among themselves and strive for the peace and prosueritv of the nation. M ore than this, they give largely in charity. Not only do the Mount Lebanon families look after the needs of the poor in the territory adjacent, but they send carloads of provisions to the Salvation A rm y and to the Brooklyn bureau of charities, and are always responsive to appeals in case of fire, famine, or flood. But, despite the kindness, benevolence, mental breadth, and liber­ ality of these people, the young men and women of the country are not drawn to them. ing in. The old are dying off and little new blood is com­ Unless, therefore, some great change takes place in the ideals of the rising generation there is little prospect that the hopes long cherished by the Shakers will ever be realized. The movement of modern thought is altogether against the notion that the generative function is inconsistent with the highest manhood and womanhood, and the hopes of thoughtful people respecting the future of the race are turning to generation more than regeneration. The following passage from a recent letter of an elder is really pathetic, when we consider the hopes these people have cherished and the fidelity with which they have striven to do their part in the work of bringing about their fulfillment: W e are tired of trying to support our institution by hiring aliens, which is utterly antagonistic to the life and principles we are pledged to uphold. There has been a steady decline in members, and in the animating spirit of our community, since we began to hire our home work done to supply the lack of members to accomplish all it appeared necessary to have done. W e have raised many children, who generally leave us for other pastures by the time they are old enough to find a home for them­ selves, or before. The spirit of the hireling operates to blight nearly all young growth, instilling actual poison where it can be done without liability of detection. Some of us are thoroughly satisfied that we must cease hiring in order to recover prosperity. W e thought that if we were located far enough south to be beyond the frost line we might live more cheaply, and, having less taxes to pay, procure our support from the land without having to hire part of our work done to supplement labor of the community. So it was decided by the wise heads of one C O O P E R A T IV E COM M UNITIES IN TH E U N IT E D ST A TE S. 577 family here to purchase land in Florida with the proceeds of sales of property we hoped to make elsewhere. Those intrusted with the business engaged for a tract that is not yet paid for. W e have received considerable help from other families, and yet, unless something unforeseen occurs, unless somebody wants land that we would be glad to sell— land and buildings at a fair price— it will take all our surplus earnings for several years to discharge the debt. Is not almost everybody that has any life in them, i. e., the life of the world, after money, money, money ? Is there ever any satisfy­ ing the greed for money ? W e have got so far away from the original purpose of our insti­ tution that we seem to be forced into the general scramble for money. Nearly all our labor, beyond supplying our immediate physical neces­ sities, must be turned into money to pay hirelings and to pay taxes. On this matter of taxes the writer of the above thinks it a great hardship that the family to which he belongs should have to pa}^ a tax of $2,000 a year for the privilege of doing good and raising other peo­ ple’s children, feeding the hungry, and clothing the naked. He would make no complaint of the school tax or the road tax, but the military and naval tax, and the tax for criminal courts to punish the disorders of licensed criminal makers and manufacturers of crime and disorder should not, he thinks, be put upon the property of such orderly, peace-loving people. VALUE OF PROPERTY. A s to the value of Shaker property it is impossible to give even an approximate estimate. Buildings are of value only as required for use and as adapted to the particular need. The Shaker structures are substantially built and capable of housing and employing probably five times their present population. W ere they convenient to great centers of population their value would be greatly increased, though being built for communal living they would be poorly adapted for individual homes. They could, however, be utilized for hotels, boarding houses, schools, and other like purposes. But most of the villages are too remote from great commercial and industrial centers to be available for such uses. Under former conditions of business many of these villages could have been readily transformed into manufacturing plants. Under present con­ ditions, however, they could hardly be utilized even if purchasable at very low prices. So that these buildings in the various Shaker com­ munities, though kept in good repair and in an excellent state of preservation, are probably not worth one-fourth of what it would cost to build them. A s Shakers are good farmers their land is probably worth quite as much as that of their neighbors, and as they have many thousands of acres, with much in a high state of cultivation, its value must be very 578 B U L L E T IN OF T H E DEPARTM ENT OF L A B O R . great. M r. Nordhoff reported 49,335 acres, mainly in the home farms, but as several societies have large holdings in other States he estimated their landed possessions at not less then 100,000 acres. Some large purchases have been made since then, partly in prepara­ tion for the accession to their ranks, which the leaders felt sure must come, as the result of economic and social conditions; and partly with the view of transferring their societies from the North to the South. A s sales have been comparatively small, their holdings are probably larger than in 1875, though the population is reported as only half as great. M r. Nordhoff reported 2,415. The census feturns for 1890 report 1,728. Elder Hollister reports about 1,200 at the close of the century. These facts indicate that the dissolution of the body or a change in some of its peculiar features can not long be postponed. The world will surely witness its demise with regret. There has been so much in the life and spirit of these people that is admirable; so much of simplicity, of integrity, of brotherly regard, of real human kindness, in the midst of a world too largely bent on selfish aims, that we shall miss them sadly. But whatever of good they have accomplished, whatever of truth they have taught, will remain to work itself into the social order that is to be. Indeed, we can not doubt that the object lesson furnished by the Shakers has already had much to do with the growth of the cooperative spirit and the development of more humane ideals and methods, as manifested in the conduct of scores of our present enterprises. T H E A M A N A S O C IE T Y . ORIGIN AND CHARACTER. This is the corporate name of what is otherwise known as “ The Community of True Inspiration.” It had its origin in Germany in the early part of the eighteenth century. It did not, however, begin as a communistic society, but as a religious body, having for its distinguish­ ing doctrine the affirmation that inspiration belongs to the present not less than to the past, and that God is always ready to declare H is word and will to men and women who are ready to hear and do. This was the teaching of Mystics and Pietists generally, but this particular society grew out of the labors of J. F. Rock and E. L. Gruber, in Hesse, Germany, and dates back to the year 1714. Many who felt the hollowness and formality of the existing church eagerly embraced this teaching, which opened the way, as they felt, to per­ sonal communion with the Highest, and to a life of divinest fellowship and happiness. The leaders in this movement were not only men of piety in the usual sense of this term, they were men having a pro­ found interest in the present welfare as well as the future happiness of C O O P E R A T IV E COMMUNITIES IN THE U N IT E D ST A TE S. 579 the poor about them. They sought to free the common people from the heavy burdens imposed by a corrupt clergy, and to lead them to purer living, and through this to a larger fellowship with the divine. The difference between the society organized by Rock and Gruber and many other inspiration communities throughout Germany and Holland lay in the fact that the former community maintained that there is a false as well as a true inspiration, and that it is necessary to distinguish between them. Besides, both Rock and Gruber were earnest and enthusiastic social reformers. They arraigned the immor­ alities of the clergy and the dishonesty and selfishness of the people. Men were not saved by faith alone, they said, but by good works as well. They laid great stress on virtue. Honesty, uprightness, mor­ ality were strictly enforced on members of the society. The fact was emphasized that ethics must be carried into government, into politics, into religion. These facts touching the origin and character of the movement in its early stages, before it committed itself to the communistic policy, have a value as affording an explanation of the growth of the com­ munistic spirit and of the strength and permanency of the bond that has held them so long in communistic effort. The boldness with which the Pietists generally attacked the corruptions of the church and the sins of men in high places soon led to the arrest and imprisonment of the offenders. Many governments prohibited all meetings of the Inspirationists and imposed heavy fines. A s persecution increased, the persecuted naturally sought refuge under those governments where the largest liberty was allowed.* This brought many to Hesse, and nat­ urally into the fellowship of the new Inspirational Society. W ith all these thrown upon their hands, without any means, and often unable to get work, the members were sorely perplexed. Their leader, Christian M etz, thought the right and wise thing to do was to lease a large estate, where these exiles could be put to work, and at least make enough to supply their wants, the societ}r becoming responsible for the rest. A s others flocked to this place of refuge three more estates were leased and the people placed according to nationality and language. The members lived for the most part together in the castle or adjoining buildings; meetings were held in the large hall, and chil­ dren were taught. They worked the land together, sold the surplus products, and shared equally in the proceeds. Soon they found it cheaper to have a common kitchen and table, and so, out of the necessi­ ties of their situation, began that communistic life which they after­ wards deliberately approved and adopted. EMIGRATION TO AMERICA. But the movement was not allowed to grow and take permanent root in Hesse. These people had other peculiar views objectionable to the rulers of their time besides those on inspiration. They were 580 B U L L E T IN opposed to war. OF T H E DEPARTM ENT OF L A B O R . They objected to making oath. They wished to educate their children themselves, though willing also to support the state schools. They did not wish to spend years in military training, learning an art for which they had no use, and which they could not conscientiously practice. So they petitioned for liberty to follow their own consciences in all these things. But their plea was denied. In this emergency an inspiration came to their leader and to others that all should leave their native land, settle in one place, live under the same laws, and adopt a community of goods. In the discussion which followed it seemed that the United States offered the best advantages. On the 14th of August, 1842, the elders decided that four men should be elected to look up a place for them in America, or any other country suitable for a new home, where they could all live in common. The outcome of this step was that in 1843 and years following many of the members settled in Erie County, N. Y . , on what was formerly the Seneca reservation. There they built up a flourishing community in a single decade, and in 1855, desiring more room for growth and a larger tract of land than they could afford to buy in New Y ork , they sold the property there to good advantage and moved to Iowa County, Iowa. There they now hold about 26,000 acres of ground, and have established seven villages, with an aggregate population of 1,800. INDUSTRIES, ETC. In addition to farming, the society carries on several manufacturing industries, employing many who are not members of the community, and has attained a high degree of prosperity. The seven villages are Amana, East, W e st, South, and Middle Amana, High Amana, and Homestead. The last named is a station on the Chicago, Bock Island and Pacific Railway, about 20 miles west of Iowa City. It was not included in the original purchase, but the whole village was bought later to secure better shipping facilities for the community. This was of great importance to them, as they had four sawmills, two gristmills, a tannery, a print factory, and two woolen mills, the products of which are in excellent repute. They sell large quantities of flour. They have soap factories, starch factories, hominy mills, and bookbinderies, while their pepsin is deemed tfie best in the market. Each village has a store which commands the trade of the neighboring farmers, and a hotel for the accommodation of the general public. It also has its shoemakers’ , carpenters’ , tailors’, and other shops, for they aim to produce and make as nearly as possible all that they use. The society has a printing office in Middle Amana, where its own books are made. A s the villages are small, they usually have but one street, apart from which are the barns, factories, and workshops. The houses, of wood, brick, and stone, are plain, but well built, though the absence of paint gives them a rather dull and unattractive appearance. C O O P E R A T IV E COMMUNITIES IN THE U N IT E D ST A TE S. 581 Churches and schoolhouses differ in externals from other buildings only in being larger. The farm buildings are roomy and well arranged. Each village has a number of eating houses, arranged for groups of 30 to 50, to suit the convenience of the population. Amana proper, with a population of about 500, has 16 such houses. Here, when the signal is given, the families gather from their separate houses for meals, the sexes sitting at separate tables and the children also by them­ selves. Those unable to go to the eating houses have their food car­ ried to them. Three regular meals, and in summer lunches between, are the custom. The food is wholesome and abundant, but less varied from day to day than is common. Every house has its vegetable and flower garden. Grapes are grown in abundance, from which the peo­ ple keep themselves supplied with home-made wine. A n annual allowance of $40 for men and $25 for women is made to cover the individual expenses for clothing. That of the children ranges from $5 to $10. A store exists in each village for the conven­ ience of the members, but it draws not a little patronage from neigh­ boring towns. SCHOOLS. W hile the society values education, it lays special stress on that which makes most strongly for good character and fits for the useful activities of life. From 7 to 14 every child must attend school the entire year; from 14 to 20 they are obliged to attend during the winter season. The school sessions are from 8 in the morning until noon. Manual training occupies the afternoon. In the schools are taught the ordinary branches. Special attention is given to mathe­ matics and penmanship, in which the children attain great proficiency. German and English are given an hour each, but during school hours all conversation is carried on in German. The children are also trained in vocal music, but not in instrumental. The schools are supported by the township, which belongs to the Amana Society. It is divided into independent districts, with a schoolhouse in each village. They levy their own tax, build their own schoolhouses, and employ their own teachers. These, however, attend the county institute, are examined by the county superintendent, and are, therefore, competent English teachers. They receive $30 a month for twelve months, but as they are all members of the society this goes into the common fund. There are various kinds of manual training meant to fit the children for the different pursuits carried on by the society. Gardening, the various branches of mechanics, and processes of manufacture are all taught. Attention is paid to the natural aptitude of the children, and an effort made to give each child an opportunity to follow that for which he is best fitted by natural endowment. That the com­ munity is not entirely wedded to old ways and methods is evidenced 582 B U L L E T IN OF T H E DEPARTM ENT OF L A B O R . by the changes that have taken place in this department. In the earlier days, when Nordhoff and Hinds wrote of this society, the boys as well as the girls were taught knitting, and in the works of these writers other kinds of manual training were not mentioned. RELIGIOUS BELIEF. Though believing in the inspiration of the Bible and the authority of the New Testament teaching, they do not regard inspiration and revelation as wholly things of the past. God is present in the world to-day as in olden time, and has in no way changed his methods of communication. Inspiration, as defined by them, is “ a supernatural influence of the spirit of God on the human mind, by which persons are qualified to set forth divine truth.” It is not limited by sex. Therefore all members have an equal right to teach and exhort in public meeting if they feel themselves moved thereto by the illuminating spirit. W h ile rejecting the creedal doctrine of the Trinity and holding to the unity of God, they believe in the threefold manifestation. They reject the notions of predestination, of a millenium in this life, and of purgatory beyond. They believe in the resurrection, in the happiness of the righteous, and the misery of the wicked. Baptism is purely spiritual. They observe the Lord’s Supper on rare occasions, but only as symbolic of an inward feasting with the Lord. They practice feet washing and have love feasts, in the manner, as they believe, of the primitive Christians. W a r is at variance, in their thought, with the teaching of Christ and H is apostles. Like the Quakers, they refuse to take oaths. They use salutations or greetings, but object to all friv ­ olous recreations. Vocal music for home and church use is cultivated, but all instrumental music is forbidden. They permit no display or ostentation in their burial services. They erect no costly monuments. A small slab of wood, painted white, and bearing the name and age of the deceased, alone marks the resting place of the body. COMMUNITY OF GOODS. Their reason for adopting a community of goods was “ that they might lead a life ,” as holders of a common faith, “ which they could not lead among their fellow-m en.” Since they took this step, though their increase has not been rapid, it has been steady, and they are stronger to-day in numbers and financial resources than ever before. Over 800 crossed the sea and formed the Ebenezer Community in New Y ork. Nearly 1,200 moved to Iowa, and to-day they number about 1,800. Their increase in wealth is much greater than their growth in numbers, though this, so far as we can gather from the assessments for the year 1890, is no greater per capita than that outside community life. There is, however, this great difference, as bearing on the com­ C O O P E R A T IV E COMMUNITIES IN THE U N IT E D S T A T E S. 583 fort and happiness which the increase of wealth in a community ought to carry with it: In Amana each individual of the population is an equal sharer in the gains which afford the means for adding to comfort and happiness, while outside the gains of some single individuals are counted millions, though the great majority of the population may have gained in wealth but little or not at all each year. If the record of all communities were as favorable, from the eco­ nomic point of view, as that of the Amana Society, the advantage in the way of general comfort and happiness would be an overwhelming argument in favor of community life. But, unfortunately, it is not. Amana stands practically alone in having a steady increase, both in wealth and membership. Their own philosophy of this fact may be stated as follows: Religion is the only bond which can hold men together in the fellowship of mutual service. Men who do not regard such service as a matter of divine requirement and of primary obliga­ tion have no adequate motive to such service, and no bond of union strong enough to prevent differences of opinion and interest from breed­ ing dissension and disruption. Again, the Amana Society has never encouraged that democratic form of government which is the ideal of most modern communists. It has depended rather on the wisdom of the few who, under a sense of religious duty, recognize their obliga­ tion to use their greater gifts in the interest of all. The sentiment, UA public office is a public trust,” is with them an abiding and con­ trolling conviction. Office is not something to be sought for the honors or emoluments that go with it. It is something to be imposed and accepted as a sacred responsibility, something which fitness alone gives one the right to accept. The elect are not chosen for their own sake, but rather for the sake of the community they are elected to serve. Hence, though elections are annually held, satisfactory officers are generally reelected. The men intrusted with the general manage­ ment of affairs are selected from the men of middle age and experience. The elders are chosen from the older members who lead pure lives and who have rendered the society faithful and meritorious service. There is a strong religious sentiment against allowing personal ambi­ tion to play any part in this matter. Hence the community has really commanded the service of its best and most capable men, and has avoided the disasters which the office-hunting spirit is sure to bring. Again, the system of village life in separate homes and of eating together in small-sized groups has tended to preserve the religious and social independence of the villages and to give opportunity for a larger individuality of expression. Then there is a homogeneity among these people not commonly found in cooperative movements. They speak one language, have common hopes and aspirations, and are bound together by ties like those which form the strongest bond .of the national life. 584 B U L L E T IN OF TH E DEPARTM ENT OF L A B O R . These people are simple in their habits and have little to do with what we call the luxuries of life. Their tables are bountifully laden with wholesome food, but practically it is the same from day to da}^ except as varied by the presence of fresh fruits in their season. Their gardens are neat, well cultivated, and tasteful, and their houses models of cleanliness. They give much attention to flowers. Lattices are built against the front of nearly all the houses, over which vines are trained, making their homes in the summer season masses of foliage and blossoms. Again, the variety of song birds one sees indicates that something higher than the sporting or commercial spirit rules the peo­ ple. Pretty little houses are erected for the martins in almost every yard, and other birds make themselves at home where they will. u No pig or cow or dog wanders in the street, and no cart is stationed there over night. Instead of a barn and stable to make a mess about every house, there is one big barn belonging to the community.” I f there is no theater or library, there is no saloon or jail; neither is there any corner store where loafers sit around on barrels, chewing tobacco and swapping stories. The mills that belong to the society are on the edge of the village, not in its center, and a canal supplies the water power that runs the mills. A large dredge, built by the community, keeps the canal clean. Altogether the Amanas constitute a pleasing group of villages, and probably shelter as contented and happy a people as can be found in the country. They do not insure their property for the same reason that they do not paint their houses— they say there is no economy in it. RELIGIOUS SERVICES. Form erly both sexes and all ages formed one congregation, the elders and others supposed to be spiritually minded sitting in front facing the congregation. Immediately in front of the elders, on the first rows, sat the children and others ranked among the least spiritually developed. Back of the children were those regarded as more advanced, but not entitled to sit with the elders. Males occupied one side of the house, females the other. In more recent times each meetinghouse has been divided into four separate apartments or meeting rooms— one for the older people, one for the young married couples, a third for the young women, and a fourth for the young men. These rooms are entirely separate from each other, and can be entered only from the outside. The walls are bare, but blue-washed and clean. Plain benches take the place of pews. These, as well as the floors, are scoured until they are almost white. A rag carpet in the aisle serves the double purpose of deaden­ ing the sound of tramping feet and relieving in some measure the bareness of the room. A ll observe a reverential demeanor. ice begins with silent prayer. The serv­ A fte r a brief time the silence is broken C O O P E R A T IV E COMMUNITIES IN TH E U N IT E D ST A TE S. 585 by one of the elders, who announces a hymn, which is sung by the con­ gregation without any instrumental accompaniment. A fte r singing, there is a reading from the Bible, or some more modern writing regarded as inspired, on which comments may be offered by any mem­ ber. A fter this another hymn is sung and the service closed. The service is dignified and impressive, and breathes throughout a reverent and devout spirit. On Sunday quiet reigns throughout the village and makes it really a day of rest. DRESS AND COMMUNITY CUSTOMS. The Amanists dress plainly, the men in modern attire of dark color, the women in calico or woolen gowns, surmounted by a sort of hood. Their adornment is of the inner man rather than the outer. Their religion forbids them to turn a deaf ear to a suffering brother or sister, a fact of which some tramps are not slow to avail themselves. Some­ times these tramps make a circuit of the villages, staying a night at each place; but when they start on their second round they are apt to be discovered, and as the religion of the Amana community emphasizes the love that works no ill to the neighbor, it gives no encouragement to that sort of predatory industry. They eschew all titles and merely formal modes of address. They greet each other as brother and sister and salute one another upon meeting. They are kind and obliging, though plain and direct of speech, and as ready, within reasonable bounds, to help an outsider as one of their own. There is nothing of gloom in community life as illustrated in Amana. W h ile the people are selfpossessed and sedate, they are not without cheerfulness, and one is not considered irreligious simply because lively. Joyous laughter is often heard in the laundries and kitchen where the women are employed, while the men in the factories work with a happy and contented look, often chanting some well-known hymn they have learned in the home or the church. “ For two hundred years they have existed as a religious society. For nearly fifty years they have practiced com­ munism and prospered under it.” “ This is the only community in the United States which, from its foundation to the present time, can show a continued increase in mem­ bership and value of property. ” The dying embers of enthusiam which Christian M etz and Barbara Heinemann fanned into a flame have con tinued to burn on this side of the ocean. From the foundation of the society the members have always been persons of strong mentality and good morals, who have clung to their faith with the enthusiasm of real believers, and, persuaded of the truth of their doctrines, have been striving to realize a high ideal. It has been said that the Amana people are opposed to war. They really claim to be nonresistants. Y et during the civil war, while they furnished no volunteers, they, regretfully, it is said, hired substitutes 586 B U L L E T IN to fill their quota. OF TH E DEPARTM ENT OF L A B O R . In addition, they contributed some $20,000 during that period to benevolent objects. They show no party spirit in poli­ tics, but vote for the best men regardless of party. A ll widows and unmarried women 30 years of age or over, who are not represented by male members, have a right to vote at the annual election of trus­ tees. The women have also a council among themselves for the man­ agement of household matters. Besides, the recognized head of the community and its inspired leader was a woman— Barbara Heinemann. PROPERTY. There is a general feeling that communism is unfavorable to industry; that in making the common good the dominant motive, and in giving to each a feeling of security against want, the most powerful incentive to individual enterprise and energy is removed, and so, in the nature of things, communistic enterprises must fall behind in productiveness. A comparison made between the average per capita holdings of indi­ viduals in the Amana Society and individuals in the State gives some support to this view; but the difference is so slight that one is led rather to question whether it may not be due to some other cause.

Certainly the difference is not so great as to constitute in itself a very formidable argument against the communistic life. I f the Amanas could make as good a showing in other matters which meas­ ure progress and civilization as they do in this, together with the much better showing which they make in point of sobriety, honesty, and general virtue, their system would surely have serious claims on the consideration of mankind. A s it is, we may well question whether these people can not teach us some important lessons, and whether we have not paid too high a price for some of the things to which we are fond of pointing as evidences of p r o g r e s s C O O P E R A T IV E COMMUNITIES IN TH E U N IT E D STA TE S. 587 T H E S E P A R A T IS T S O C IE T Y O F Z O A R . Though this society passed out of existence as a communistic body in 1898, its history is such as to justify something more than an obituary notice. Like most of the communistic societies that had their rise in Germany, the Zoar Society, its members claim, grew out of the revolt against the formalism, decadence, and corruption of the church. Many of those who were active in the movement for radical reform were not content to follow Luther and his party. One of the preachers in Luther’s day complained that there were u as many sects in W iirtem berg as there were houses.” Am ong these dis­ senting and independent bodies, the Pietists or Mystics were perhaps the strongest and most influential school. One branch of these— the Separatists— rejected baptism, confirmation, and other ordinances. They believed very earnestly and very literally in the ethical teaching of the Sermon on the Mount. Therefore they were opposed to war and refused to bear arms. They would take no legal oath nor call any man master. Their yea and nay were enough, and all men, in their thought, were equal before the Lord. Hence they discarded all forms and customs which implied authority on the one hand and submission on the other. They refused to send their children to the public schools because these were conducted by the Lutheran clergy. Disregard of the conventional forms of the church and of the state naturally brought them into conflict with both institutions. Hence they were both perse­ cuted and prosecuted. They were flogged, imprisoned, and stripped of their possessions.’ Their children were taken from them. They were subjected, in short, to conditions which made life in their own country almost impossible. Naturally their thoughts turned to America, which had proven a haven of refuge for the persecuted of England. In 1804 some 600 Separatists, mostly mechanics and peasants, under the leadership of George Rapp, came to America and settled in Beaver County, Pa., about 25 miles northwest of Pittsburg, forming what was known as the Harmony Society. Doubtless some knowledge of their fortune had reached the people of whom we are now writing, moving them to a like venture. A t all events, the company that formed the Zoar colony left W iirtem berg for this country in A p ril, 1817. They selected as leader Joseph M . Baumeler, later called Bimeler, who, though of humble origin, showed remarkable ability and unusual moral fitness for the service to which he had been chosen. M ost of the company, some 300 in number, were poor. Many were unable to pay their passage, but were aided by the Quakers of England^who had a lively sympathy for them in their trouble and with them in their purpose. 588 B U L L E T IN OF TH E DEPARTM ENT OF L A B O R . Landing in Philadelphia, after a voyage of three months, they were kindly received by the resident Friends, who gave them shelter and care while they were getting ready for their W estern home. The Society of Friends m England, anticipating the needs of these perse­ cuted people, had sent for their use a sum amounting to about $18 for each. This was a great boon, and did much to cheer and encourage the colonists, as well as to attach them strongly to these Quaker friends. Several months passed before a location was chosen and a tract of land secured for a colony settlement. Finally 5 500 acres of a military grant in Tuscarawas County, Ohio, were purchased of one Godfrey Hagar, at $3 per acre. It is interesting to note, in view of what fo l­ lowed, that the price paid was a large one for wilderness lands. But it is all the more significant when we learn that even the cash payment of $1,500 was loaned by the Quaker friends, while Bimeler’s individual notes for $15,000, to be paid in fifteen years, were secured by a mort­ gage on the land for that amount, with interest for all but the first three years. This was surely a great handicap on the little colony in its race for fortune. The marvel is that with such a burden financial success was ever achieved. W e have said that the transaction was in Bimeler’s name, but it was with a definite understanding that each member should have an interest in the property proportionate to the amount he contributed to the payment for the land. In December, 1817, Bimeler, in company with a chosen few, went out and took possession of his purchase and began the work of erect­ ing shelter for others who should follow. These log houses were built about a common center, after the German custom, and not scattered over separate farms. In the spring of 1818 all who were able to move joined the advance company at Zoar, the name they had chosen for their little settlement. Many were too poor to join at once, and so remained behind, taking service with farmers to earn a support for their families and the means of transportation. In the study of this social experiment we have to bear in mind that the real motive of these Separatist immigrants was, first, religious liberty, and second, better opportunities for obtaining a livelihood. They had no intention at the outset— even when their land was purchased---of forming a communistic society. Each was to pay for his own little piece of land and work it for his own advantage. They soon saw, however, that while this meant success and prosperity for some, it meant failure and distress for others. But the ethical side of the religion they professed bound them to consider the need of the weaker as well as the stronger, and, really desiring above all else to be loyal to this, they set themselves to the work of discovering what it really required. The result was a determination to establish u a C O O P E R A T IV E COMMUNITIES IN TH E U N ITED ST A T E S. 589 community of goods and efforts, and draw unto themselves all whom poverty compelled to take service at a distance.” A fter laying the matter before the whole society and discussing it for some weeks, articles of agreement were signed on April 19, 1819, by 53 males and 104 females— the total number of men, women, and children at this time being 225 persons. The articles of association were prefaced as follows: The undersigned, members of the Society of Separatists of Zoar, have, from a true Christian love toward God and their fellow-men, found themselves convinced and induced to unite themselves according to the Christian Apostolic sense, under the following rules, through a communion of property, and they do hereby determine and declare that from the day of this date the following rules shall be valid and in effect. The rules which are here referred to simply provide for com­ plete community of property interests, present and prospective. A ll earnings go into the common stock of the association, to be used by the directors in the common interest. These directors the society elects annually out of its own members, and to the society they must give account of all their business transactions. Five years later these articles were amended and extended, but only with a view the more effectually to carry out the purposes declared in the first. February 6, 1832, the society was incorporated under the then exist­ ing laws of Ohio by the name of “ The Society of Separatists of Zoar,” thus acquiring the usual powers of a corporation, and being able to hold property, purchase and sell, and do all other things necessary to its continuous existence. Under this act of incorporation an organization was effected and a constitution adopted, all members who remained in the society at the time becoming members of the society in its corporate capacity. Under this constitution two classes were recognized, the novitiates and the full associates. The first served at least one year before admission to the second class. Full associates must be of legal age— males 21 and females 18. Proba­ tioners retained their property until becoming full associate members. One could be admitted without property, but must have no debt. Strangers seeking admission were fed, clothed, and lodged during the probationary year, but not paid. Many relatives and friends of the first comers joined the colony during its early years. Occasionally marriage drew a new member, but accessions by conversion were exceedingly few. No American is known to have joined. Officers were elected by ballot and majority vote, the women voting as well as the men. The community government was vested in three trustees to serve three each, one to be elected annually. These trustees had the exclu­ 3^ears sive management of all the industries and affairs of the society, and 590 B U L L E T IN OF T H E DEPARTM ENT OF L A B O R . assigned to each member his special work. In doing this the inclina­ tion and aptitude of each were considered and great care taken to avoid misfits. Clothing, board, and housing were provided for each member “ without respect to person,” and all means confided to their charge the trustees must use for the best interests of all. Superin­ tendents of the different industries and departments of labor, as well as their subordinates, were chosen by this board. It held monthly meetings, at which all matters of administration, home and foreign, were carefully considered. The supreme judiciary, or arbitration tri­ bunal, of the society, to which all cases of dissension and complaint were carried, was a standing committee or council of five, one mem­ ber going off and a new one coming on each year. This council could discipline or drop refractory members, erasing their names from the roll of membership and depriving them of all rights in the society. A ll disputes were to be settled by arbitration alone and within the society. A secretary-treasurer was elected every four years. H e had the sole charge of all moneys, kept the books, and had immediate oversight of all society transactions. There was also an agent-general, an elected officer, who acted as the purchaser, salesman, and contractor for the society in its dealings with the outside world. This office when created was looked upon as the post of honor and influence in the society; so it was given to Joseph Bimeler, their leader, who held it to the time of his death, after which it remained vacant, its duties being performed by the cashier or one of the trustees. Notice of time and place of election was given twenty days in advance of the event by the trustees, and five members were chosen at each election to be managers and judges. It was their custom to have their constitution publicly read at least once a year, at which time the people discussed and acted upon their affairs much after the fashion of the New England town meeting. They had no president, and in the form of government were exceedingly democratic. The u principles of the Separatists,” as set forth in the works of Joseph Bimeler, consist of twelve articles. The first four, which con­ cern the Trinity, the fall, the restoration through Christ, and the H oly Scriptures, need not be given, as they are held substantially as taught by the general church. The others are: V . A ll ceremonies are banished from among us, and we declare them useless and injurious; and this is the chief cause of our separation. V I. W e render to no mortal honors due only to God, as to uncover the head, or to bend the knee. Also we address every one as ‘ 4thou. ” V II. W e separate ourselves from all ecclesiastical connections and constitutions, because true Christian life requires no sectarianism, while set forms and ceremonies cause sectarian divisions. V III. Our marriages are contracted b}^ mutual consent, and before witnesses. They are then notified to the political authority; and we reject all intervention of priests or preachers. C O O P E R A T IV E COMMUNITIES IN THE U N IT E D S T A T E S. 591 I X . A ll intercourse of the sexes, except what is necessary to the perpetuation of the species, we hold to be sinful and contrary to the order and command of God. Complete virginity or entire cessation of sexual commerce is more commendable than marriage. X . W e can not send our children into the schools of Babylon, where other principles, contrary to these, are taught. X I . W e can not serve the State as soldiers, because a Christian can not murder his enemy, much less his friend. X I I . W e regard the political government as absolutely necessary to maintain order, and to protect the good and honest and to punish the wrongdoers; and no one can prove us to be untrue to the constituted authorities. It is easy to see that separation from the regular church was a neces­ sary result to those holding such views. Joseph Bimeler was the spiritual leader and preacher of these people, made such not by any ecclesiastical authority, or any laying on of priestly hands, but by the universal voice of his people. H is reported and printed discourses constitute the only theological literature they possess. They make three large octavo volumes, and are said to be very rare. He was very severe on the u official clergy,” whom he denounced as “ lazy and useless servants,” who, by their empty, cere­ monious trifles, deluded the people and kept them from the path of truth. His speeches contain lessons on morality, temperance, health, housekeeping, and other practical topics. H e was not a Sabbatarian, and did not think much of foreign missionary work. Though Article I X mildly condemns marriage, and Bimeler’s teaching and influence led to its prohibition for a number of years, when smitten with the charms of one of the comely maidens, who was an inmate of his house­ hold and whose duty it was to wait upon him, a sudden and radical change took place in his views. The antimarriage rule was abro­ gated, the head of the society was married, and ever after he publicly advocated the wedded state. H e highly appreciated the educational privileges enjoyed by the children in this country and admired the republican principles of government under which such freedom was enjoyed. The Separatists took as their model the first Christian community at Jerusalem— where all were of one heart and one soul, had all things common, and no man said that aught of the things he possessed was his own. Bimeler said he preferred the equality of the communistic colony to the wealth and poverty of the outer world, as more favor­ able to virtue and happiness and less productive of sin and misery. Aside from his attacks on the clergy, Bimeler was little given to denunciation. H e had an eye for the good in most things, and kept well abreast of the spirit of the age. H e rejoiced in the advance of science and in the progress of invention, and sought to encourage individual independence of thought and action. 11358— No. 35— 01------3 “ W e must be glad,” 592 B U L L E T IN OF T H E DEPARTM ENT OF L A B O R . he nays, “ that God has led us out of our former fatherland, which is kept so much under pressure and servitude, and brought us hither, where we can act, without hindrance and molestation, according to our conviction and conscience. It was for this we came. It was not sel­ fishness, nor greed, nor avarice, nor desire for an easy life, that caused us to emigrate. I f either of those had been our motive we would not be so peaceful and satisfied within ourselves as we are. W e should not have attained our aim had we been guided by any of these ignoble intentions.” Had this freedom from selfishness and avarice and desire for an eas}^ life continued to exist as characteristic of these people, perhaps the dissolution which came after a long period of prosperity might have been avoided. The presence of those things led to troubles which were finally carried to the courts of the country. Members who had been deprived of supposed rights, or expelled, resorted to the law for redress. Two of these cases became famous and important as legal precedents. In the A pril term, 1851, a suit was brought by John G. Gosele and others in the seventh circuit of the United States. John Gosele, the father of the complainant, was one of the original emi­ grants, and continued a member of the Zoar Society until his death in 1827, which was five years prior to its incorporation in 1832. His heirs, John G. Gosele and others, brought suit for a partition of the Zoar property and the restitution to them of their ancestor’s distribu­ tive share. This raised the question whether the contract entered into by the members with the organization was legitimate and valid under our laws. W e have no space for the argument, or even the court’s opinion in the case, but the court held to the legitimacy and validity of the contract under which members in joining the society relin­ quished all individual ownership in their property and, by withdrawal, forfeited all interest. A subsequent suit, carried to the supreme court of Ohio in 1862, resulted in a similar decision, the court sustaining the contract upon which the community was based. These troubles, however, only came to the- society after it had achieved a considerable industrial and financial success. The story of this deserves to be told at length, but space will not permit. W e must sketch it briefly. The site of Zoar was well chosen on the east bank of the Tuscarawas River, in the northern part of Tuscarawas County, Ohio, where the stream flows through a valley fertile in soil and rich in scenery. The Ohio and Erie Canal passes near by, and the town is a station on the W heeling and Lake Erie Railroad. The Zoarites were fortunate in their location. The country was opening up. The tide of emigration was flowing westward, and, whether it swept by or settled about them, it built up their industries and gave value to their lands. Then the building of the canal was a timely help. They obtained the contract C O O P E R A T IV E COMMUNITIES IN THE U N IT E D ST A TE S. 593 to dig* it through the extent of their territory, receiving in cash $21,000 and finding in addition a market for many of their products. They worked and prospered. They not only paid oft' their indebtedness on the original purchase, but added to their territory until they pos­ sessed some 12,000 acres. They not only built up industries for the supply of their own needs, but established a large commerce with the outside world. Much of the growth and prosperity of the society was doubtless due to the ability and clear-sightedness of Bimeler. Though the success continued for some years after his death, when the decline set in the downward movement was rapid. Trade fell off, income decreased, while expenses grew. began to withdraw. Then the younger and more active members Some, as we have seen, made trouble by trying to take their share of the property with them. Occasionally some one suggested a dissolution and abandonment of the communistic feature, but for a long time this met with no favor. The time came, however, when the movement for dissolution was headed by one of the most active and influential members, Levi Bimeler, a descendant of Joseph, and the village schoolmaster. Levi Bimeler had been educated outside of the society, and imbibed not a little of the individualistic spirit. Despite the decision of the courts, he openly asserted the right of the members to withdraw and receive their distributive share of the property. In 1895 he promul­ gated his views in a little paper, of which he was editor, publisher, and pressman. He called it The Nugitna. Three numbers were issued, and the fourth ready for issue, when the editor was threatened with expulsion and loss of all rights, present and prospective, if he persisted in his course. But the mischief had been done. A quarter of a cen­ tury without any adequate leadership in the line of their purpose, and with increasing contact with the individualism of the outside world, had bred in the strong and capable a readiness for the competitive struggle, which struggle yielded such great prizes to the few, and at last, in 1898, when the matter was formally broached at a meeting of the society, the motion to dissolve was finally carried. A n agreement was reached binding all to the decision to divide the property upon an equitable basis. On March 10, 1898, the members signed a written compact whereby they selected and appointed Henry S. Fisher, Samuel Foltz, and W il­ liam Becker commissioners to make such equitable division. This was finally accomplished in the fall of 1898. The amount awarded to each approximated $1,500 per capita— nearly $500, or one-third, more than the average per capita of the United States in 1890. It should be said, however, that when the society was at the height of its prosperity and had a membership of 500 the per capita wealth was $3,000, the entire property of the community being valued at $1,500,000. This action of 594 B U L L E T IN OF TH E D E P A R T M E N T OF L A B O R . distribution destroyed the communistic feature of the society. The municipal incorporation of the village and the incorporated society of Zoar remain intact. The society will continue as a corporate body until all its financial affairs are adjusted and litigation at an end. Then it will be legally dissolved, and the Separatist Society of Zoar will be no more. T H E H A R M O N Y S O C IE T Y . Like the Separatists of Zoar, this society has an interesting and remarkable history. Unlike Zoar, it has been able up to date to cope successfully with the elements seeking its dissolution and a share in its property, although the membership at the present writing has been reduced to nine. These nine, however, are able to pay from the income of their property $125,000 annually to keep up their little vil­ lage. A large part of this, of course, goes to pay taxes, tor the State of Pennsylvania regards the Harmonists as good taxable material and governs itself accordingly. M r. Nordhoff, writing of this society, gives the number of persons in 1874 as 110, “ most of whom are aged, and none under 4 0 .” M r. Hinds, in 1878, puts it at 100, and says “ few are under 60 ,” though in 1828 “ it had a thousand inhabitants.” W h en we consider that these people adopted celibacy early in their history and adhered strictly to the practice during their subsequent career, we have at least a partial account of their decline in numbers altogether apart from their communistic regime. The village of Econom y, the home of the Harmonists, is situated on the Ohio River a few miles below Pittsburg. M ost of the buildings originally occupied by members are now rented by outsiders. The management of village affairs, however, is in the hands of the nine own­ ers, and residents are obliged to conform in some measure to their ways of life. This is not regarded by all as a hardship or altogether a disadvantage, as there is a degree of order and quiet not usually found in other villages of 70 to 80 houses. The Harmony Society was founded in 1805 by George Rapp, who came to America with some 600 followers in 1804. The causes which operated to bring this company across the water were similar to those which moved the Shakers, Zoarites, and others. Denial of religious freedom in the old country, persecution and imprisonment for daring to differ from constituted authorities in church and state, was the chief cause of that unrest which led all these descendants of the old Pietists and Mystics to seek a home in the new Republic. George Rapp was the son of a W iirtem berg farmer, with only moderate advantages of education. H e followed his father’s calling, adding to it that of weaver during the winter months. A thoughtful youth, with a decidedly religious cast of mind, he was seriously impressed by the great disparity between Christians as he knew them C O O P E R A T IV E COM M UNITIES IN TH E U N IT E D STA TE S. 595 and the New Testament ideal. Finding others who shared his thought, he invited them to his house, where soon quite a congregation gathered to hear him. This stirred up the clergy. Rapp and his adherents were fined and imprisoned, which confirmed them in their dislike of the existing order, and added greatly to the number of those who sympathized with them. W hile Rapp counseled obedience to the laws, he insisted on the right of the people to choose their religion and their church. Industrious and thrifty, Rapp soon gathered quite a little property, and with the help of the persecutions of the clerg}' a following of some 300 families. W hen about 45 years of age, he and his followers determined to seek a home in this country, where they would have freedom, they thought, to worship God as their own consciences might dictate. In 1803 Rapp sailed for Baltimore, accompanied by his son and two other persons. A fter some search for a suitable site, they finally pur­ chased 5,000 acres about 25 miles north of Pittsburg. Frederick Rapp, an adopted son and a man of excellent ability, who had been left in charge in Germany, had made all necessary arrangements for moving, so that no time was lost when word came that the new home had been selected. About 1,000 persons came over in three ships, but some 400 were drawn ofi by one Haller and settled in Lycoming County. The 600 who remained with Rapp were mostly of the peasant and mechanic* (*lass, but all were of the thriftier sort, and some had considerable property. Rapp met them and placed them in different parts of Maryland and Pennsylvania, reserving some of the ablest mechanics and laborers to aid him in preparing habitations in their new home for the rest. On February 15, 1805, such as could be gathered u solemnly organ­ ized themselves into the Harmony Society,” as a strictly communistic body. Later, 50 additional families joined them, bringing their num­ ber up to about 750 souls. During the first }^ear they built over 40 log houses, a church and schoolhouse, a gristmill, barn, and some work­ shops, and cleared 150 acres of land. The year following they built a sawmill, a tannery, a storehouse, and a distillery, cleared 400 acres of land, and planted a vineyard. They soon proved themselves success­ ful, both as farmers and manufacturers. Making it a rule as far as possible to make and produce everything they used, they soon intro­ duced merino sheep and built a woolen mill, thus producing their own cloth and clothing. They were extremely fortunate in their leader and his principal helper, Frederick. Rapp’s great ability and high purpose were united to unusual good sense and good temper. W h ile insisting on a rigidly religious life and cautioning them against anxiety for outward prosperity, industry and frugality were essentials of his relig­ ion, so that any disposition to shirk or sponge was regarded with especial disfavor. 596 B U L L E T IN OF TH E DEPARTM ENT OF L A B O R . In 1807 a religious revival in the society led the thoughts of the members in a direction which, though favorable to immediate pros­ perity, carried in itself the seeds of certain future decline. The younger members became impressed with the notion that the higher spiritual life is one in which the generative function can have no part. Marriage, therefore, they argued, is out of character with a Christian profession. tians. W h ile not wrong or sinful in worldlings, it is so in Chris­ Therefore they determined to live a strictly celibate life. Father Rapp, while not leading in this movement, and advising careful consideration, concurred in the view we have given, and the new order became thenceforth the law of the community. Some of the members, not feeling drawn to this sort of life, withdrew from the society. It is worthy of remark, as showing the power of a deep religious conviction, that though no measures were taken to secure conformity to the new requirement, though the sexes were allowed to mingle together freely as before, no more children were born in the community, and no evi­ dence discovered of any violation of the new agreement. Another change in the habits of the members was voluntarily made at the same time, which is scarcely less remarkable. The whole community aban­ doned the use of tobacco in every form — a sacrifice to the average adult male of the society scarcely less than that of his conjugal pleasures. Though the communhy continued to prosper, the conviction grew that, owing to lack of water communication and the unsuitableness of the soil for vineyards, they were working at a disadvantage. This led to the purchase of 30,000 acres in Posey County, In d ., to which the whole population was transferred in 1815. The Harmony property was sold for $100,000, which was thought to be much below its value. A t their new home on the Wabash the}^ soon had a flourishing town, building large factories and extending their business in many direc­ tions. But the neighbors did not take kindly to the newcomers, and the health of the members was seriously affected by fever"
