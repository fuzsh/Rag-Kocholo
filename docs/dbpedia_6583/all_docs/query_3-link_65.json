        "text": "Chris Taylor and the Great Bear Resources Exploration Team\n\nFor the discovery of the Dixie gold deposit when others believed all the multi-million ounce deposits in Ontario's Red Lake camp had been found\n\nThe Dixie project in the Red Lake gold camp of northern Ontario has been subject to intermittent exploration since 1985. Industry consensus was that whatever potential existed there had been investigated and found wanting.\n\nBut Great Bear Resources CEO, Chris Taylor and VP Exploration, Bob Singh figured there was a lot more gold to be discovered, starting with the previously identified Dixie Limb zone. They used a wealth of historical data, including a suite of more than 150 drill holes, to construct a new model of mineralization. Chris, a structural geologist, was so convinced previous explorers had misinterpreted the geology that he used his personal line of credit to finance early exploration.\n\nTheir educated gamble paid off. The Great Bear team made its first major discovery – the Hinge zone – in August 2018 by targeting a regional fold axis. Shallow drill intersections, such as 16.4 metres grading 27 grams per tonne gold, caught the market's attention and allowed the company to raise $10 million for further work.\n\nSubsequent exploration and structural interpretation led to more discoveries in rapid succession. During 2019, Great Bear found the Bear-Rimini, Yuma, Auro, Yauro, Viggo and Gap zones. Follow-up drilling confirmed these discoveries were part of a larger continuous zone of gold mineralization later called the LP Fault Zone. Unlike the vein-hosted gold mineralization typical of Red Lake, the mineralization was sheet-like, containing high-grade zones within lower grade haloes.\n\nIn February 2022, Kinross Gold purchased Great Bear for $1.8 billion, or $29 per share, even before the technical team had a chance to estimate resources for Dixie. The senior gold producer plans to develop the project into a top tier, long-life mine. As an added bonus, Great Bear’s discovery has reinvigorated exploration in the Red Lake camp, where geoscientists now have access to a new model of mineralization to find more gold.\n\nPhillip Walford & Sherry Dunsworth\n\nFor the discovery and delineation of Valentine, the largest undeveloped gold resource in Atlantic Canada\n\nAfter 25 years of sporadic exploration, the Valentine gold project in Newfoundland was growing stale. There seemed little hope of improving on a sub-economic non-compliant resource of less than half a million ounces announced in 2004.\n\nEverything changed in 2010 when Phillip Walford and Sherry Dunsworth arrived on the scene looking for a multi-million ounce gold acquisition. The two experienced geologists determined that the controls on gold mineralization were poorly understood at Valentine. They developed a new orogenic model that allowed their company, Marathon Gold, to delineate the largest undeveloped gold resource in Atlantic Canada and one of the leading gold development projects in North America.\n\nThe first four years were tough. The markets were still recovering from the recession of 2007-2009 and the gold price was just beginning to climb above US$1,000 per ounce. Financing was hard to come by. Yet the team persevered, led by Phill as President and Sherry as Vice-President of Exploration. The more they explored, the more they learned about the structural controls on existing gold zones. This growing understanding of the geological model led to the discovery of satellite deposits along a 20-kilometre strike length of the Valentine Lake Shear Zone.\n\nThe breakthrough came in 2014 when the team discovered the plus-three-million-ounce Marathon deposit by following up historical soil anomalies. More discoveries would follow, changing the landscape of geological thinking in Eastern Canada and highlighting Newfoundland and Labrador as a top jurisdiction for global exploration spending.\n\nThe April 22, 2020 press release of the updated technical report and pre-feasibility study on the Valentine Gold Project states that the Proven and Probable Reserves are 1.87 million ounces (41.05 million tonnes at 1.41 grams per tonne gold). These reserves are included in the mineral resources which are measured and indicated resources of 3.09 million ounces (54.9 million tonnes at 1.75 grams per tonne gold) and inferred resources containing 0.96 million ounces (16.77 million tonnes at 1.78 grams per tonne gold).\n\nRoss McElroy, President and Chief Operating Officer, Fission Uranium Corp.\n\nFor leading Fission’s team of geologists in the one of the most significant discoveries in the Athabasca Basin in recent years\n\nPatterson Lake South property is a high-grade shallow-depth uranium discovery located on the south-western margin of the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan. In the summer of 2011, a team of Fission geologists, led by Ross McElroy, discovered a large radioactive boulder field. The team used a new airborne surveying technology specifically designed for radioactive deposits to make the discovery.\n\nA Radon survey of the site was completed, following the discovery, to assist the team in identifying drill targets. Drilling in 2012 and 2013 resulted in the discovery of high-grade, shallow, thick uranium intersections which quickly launched the Patterson Lake South property to the top of analysts watch lists. Over the past 10 months the discovery has grown from a single hole to five mineralized zones on-trend along a strike length of 1.03km.\n\nUnder the leadership of Ross McElroy, Fission’s uranium discovery has rejuvenated the entire exploration industry in the Athabasca Basin. Previously ignored by the uranium exploration sector, the western side of the Athabasca Basin now has multiple programs being launched by other uranium junior miners in the area.\n\nRoss McElroy has over 30 years experience as a professional geologist. He has been instrumental in five of the last nine major discoveries in the Athabasca Basin, and has made two major discoveries in the past three years including Patterson Lake South, and Fission Energy’s J-Zone discovery.\n\nHudBay Minerals Inc.\n\nHudBay Minerals Inc. is being recognized for its Lalor discovery near Snow Lake, Manitoba. In turn, the company is recognizing Alan Vowles and Kelly Gilmore, the respective heads of HudBay’s geophysics and exploration teams, for their roles in the discovery.\n\nIn a 1980 report, Geological Survey of Canada geologist Don Sangster had outlined prospects for the Flin Flon greenstone belt in Manitoba and wrote that he believed “the largest deposit in the Snow Lake area is, as yet, undiscovered.”\n\nWith HudBay’s Chisel Lake mine in the Snow Lake area nearing the end of its reserves in the 1980s, HudBay began working to prove that Sangster’s view was correct.\n\nIt began a major exploration program. By 2002, well over a decade after it began, the company was moving to deeper and deeper parts of the basin and the exploration team agreed that it needed to develop an accurate method for targeting deep holes.\n\nProject geophysicist Alan Vowles agreed to conduct a geophysical experiment that he had developed with former chief geophysicist Bob Frazer to see if they could detect the Chisel North mine 600 metres below the surface employing new technology.\n\nUsing Crone Geophysics’ deep penetrating EM system, Vowles plotted the layout of a large loop of wire for a survey that would carry the electrical current over a two-square-kilometre area above the mine.\n\nHe had a joking wager with Ed Yarrow, then HudBay’s vice president of exploration, that if the experiment showed that equipment was able to detect the existing mine, the company would invest in the necessary upgrades to do more testing.\n\nVowles hired local contractor Dave Koop of Koop Geotechnical Services to lay out the wire. Vowles says Koop is an adventurous, enthusiastic professional who thrives on the excitement of making new discoveries.\n\nAlthough the zinc at Chisel and Lalor is not conductive, it is associated with minerals that are. As a result, Vowles anticipated that extraordinary measures would need to be taken to detect deposits significantly deeper than the 300-metre depth for which the equipment was certified.\n\nWith the instrument that detects conductive minerals set for the test, they threw the switch on the transmitter and the current flowed through more than 10 kilometres of wire.\n\nBut instead of the conventional practice of letting the receiver run for about 30 seconds to test to the technology’s proven depth of 300 metres, Vowles pushed it to a new level.\n\nHe left the current on to record thousands of readings while he and the team went for lunch! When they returned the readings confirmed the mine was clearly in evidence 600 metres below the surface.\n\nThe results meant that HudBay could use the technology to search for deep deposits all around their numerous mine sites in the Flin Flon area.\n\nWorking with project geologist Chris Roney, who has since left the company, Vowles identified two potential sites for the next test, one near an existing mine and the other spanning an area identified by senior geologist Jerry Kitzler at a depth of 1,100 metres.\n\nIn 2003, Vowles and Roney designed a plan for the next step. They laid out huge loops of even more wire to test an area more than 800 metres deep.\n\nWhen the data were plotted on a map, the anomalies looked like two bull’s eyes at a depth of about 900 metres.\n\nLater that year they drilled a single hole into the first of the targets.\n\nUnfortunately, the copper and zinc grades in that single sample were not economic. But the technology had worked and they had proved they could find mineralization 800 metres down.\n\nEconomics and then weather conditions intervened and delayed more drilling. By 2007 senior geologist Craig Taylor was in charge of the project. He and Gilmore, who is now chief exploration geologist, were ready to drill the second target, again 800 metres down.\n\nAt last, four years after the anomalies were first identified, drilling resumed. The results were immediately obvious. The core box was unusually heavy and just by looking at the samples, the distinctive Lalor ‘Black Jack’ zinc was evident.\n\nSince then drilling has continued steadily, and the company has subsequently announced its discovery of a new gold zone that significantly enhances the potential of the deposit.\n\nSo HudBay Minerals is continuing on its quest to track down the even bigger deposit that Don Sangster predicted.\n\nOsisko Exploration Ltd.\n\nThis award honours individuals who have made an important contribution to prospecting and exploration in Canada.\n\nOsisko Exploration has had its share of good fortune outlining more than 8.4 million ounces of gold on its Canadian Malartic property in Malartic, Quebec. But the company’s innovative approach to a mature gold camp is what ultimately won the day.\n\nOsisko was formed in 1998 by geologist Robert Wares but with commodity prices in the tank, and little capital, the company remained a one-man show until 2003 -- when John Burzynski and Sean Roosen entered the picture.\n\nRoosen and Burzynski, along with Walter and Norman Storm, were co-founders of EurAsia Holding AG, a venture capital fund consisting of equity from wealthy German investors, many of whom were lured by the idea of finding oil and gas in Kazakhstan -- not gold in Quebec. But Roosen believed that gold was about to move into a long-term bull run and it was time for EurAsia to diversify. The fund bought its first stake in Osisko in 2003 for $1.5 million.\n\nOsisko had some greenfield exploration properties in Quebec but little else. By the fall of 2004, after a foray into Brazil, little had changed. And investors were getting restless.\n\nThe company would soon focus on the Abitibi greenstone belt in an effort to find bulk-tonnage, open-pit, gold targets, a concept that eschewed the region’s long-held wisdom that the Abitibi only offered underground, high-grade, vein deposits.\n\nAfter drilling several properties and finding few ounces, Osisko moved on. Meanwhile, Robert Wares quietly sifted through Quebec’s digital database of drill results, home to information on almost every hole drilled in the province since the 1920s. Wares and his technical team, who are geologists with Cygnus Consulting Inc. in Montreal, designed programs to comb the data for holes that had long intercepts at low grades. It wasn’t long before they outlined the roughly 1,000 surface holes drilled into Canadian Malartic and decided it was a bulk-tonnage target.\n\nThe old Canadian Malartic mine operated from 1935-1965 and yielded one million ounces of gold at a head grade of 3.3 grams per tonne -- making it the lowest grade gold operation in eastern Canada.\n\nArmed with knowledge from the public drill-hole database, Osisko bought the Canadian Malartic claims from a liquidator for about $80,000. Now that Osisko had a high potential property, Roosen and Burzynski pitched EurAsia investors for more money – and got it.\n\nAs a result of the acquisition, Osisko received the former producer’s huge database as well as 65,000 metres of core drilled by Lac Minerals in the 1980s. In the spring of 2005, the Quebec government leased Osisko the former mine manager’s house on the East Malartic property and Wares’ team moved in and converted the garage to a core shack.\n\nIn an atmosphere not unlike a college dormitory, Wares and his team spent endless hours logging core and working the data into a comprehensive digital model. Lac Minerals had identified about 520,000 ounces of gold in a series of shallow open pits. Wares thought the deposit was much larger.\n\nOsisko needed to know what it had and decided to drill right down the middle of the deposit -- an unusual tack that took until late summer 2005 to complete. The gold grades were low and consistent as would be expected in a porphyry-type system. Drill holes hit mineralization 52 times out of 56.\n\nIn September 2005 the company disclosed that it had evidence of a potential 3-million-ounce deposit, and that finally caught the market’s attention.\n\nAlmost two years later, in July 2007, and after a lot more drilling, consulting firm RSG Global pegged Canadian Malartic’s inferred resource at 8.4 million ounces from 286 million tonnes grading 0.92 gram gold per tonne, using a cutoff grade of 0.4 gram gold.\n\nIn January 2003, Osisko was trading at 5¢ per share and is now around $6.00. Osisko has brought a smile to the lips of many in Canada’s mining establishment by proving once again that Canada still holds world-class deposits, and that what it takes to find them is sometimes as simple as a new approach, faith in an idea, and a lot of persistence.\n\nDennis Jones\n\nFor his contribution to sustainability in the mineral exploration sector through strong leadership of PDAC’s e3 and e3 Plus initiatives as well as ongoing CSR efforts\n\nDennis Jones applied his experience as a geologist to transform the mineral exploration sector’s approach to sustainability. In 2004 he joined the PDAC board and became chair of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Committee. In this capacity, Dennis spearheaded the expansion of PDAC’s Environmental Excellence in Exploration (e3) guide and its evolution to e3 Plus, an enhanced version that incorporates broader CSR guidelines.\n\ne3 Plus, translated into several languages, is considered the essential guide for building an environmentally and socially responsible exploration program.\n\nDennis graduated from Nottingham University with a BSc in 1966 and earned an MSc in economic geology from the University of Toronto in 1975. He started his career as a mine geologist for the Iron Ore Company of Canada. He went on to work for the United Nations as an exploration geologist, mainly in Latin America.\n\nWith international experience under his belt, Dennis started his own consulting company, GeoQuest International, to provide global exploration services to companies, financial groups and government agencies. Later, he joined IAMGOLD, retiring as the company’s vice-president of exploration in 2005.\n\nFor two decades, Dennis has contributed countless hours of volunteer time to PDAC. Aside from his CSR committee leadership, he helped the association’s advocacy efforts through domestic and international representation, once serving as an advisor to the federal government on a national CSR roundtable. He is credited with enhancing PDAC’s reputation as a world leader in best practices for environmental and social responsibility in exploration.\n\nAuthority, leader, trailblazer, champion and communicator: these are adjectives colleagues use to describe Dennis Jones. PDAC is much stronger for having him on board.\n\nRoger Wallis\n\nFor his outstanding contribution and dedication to the PDAC over the past 48 years.\n\nRoger Wallis joined the PDAC in 1967, and has been an active PDAC board and committee member since 1993. He was one of the original “e3” authors. The original e3 program was an environmental toolkit that focused on environmental excellence and included a section on community engagement. It offered an orientation to the processes related to environmental excellence.\n\nThe original program was used as the corner stone for today’s e3 Plus. While e3 Plus has grown to include social responsibility; and health and safety toolkits, the original e3 manual has been incorporated as the environmental stewardship component of the Framework for Responsible Exploration.\n\nServing on a variety of PDAC committees, including Land Access/WMI (1993-2000); Environmental Excellence in Exploration (2000-09); Corporate Society Responsibility (2009 – 2012); Annual Convention Planning Committee (2000-2013); International Geological Congress 2020 Bid Committee (2010-2011), Mr. Wallis has remained a vocal advocate for the industry over the past 20 years.\n\nMr. Wallis has been a proponent of the PDAC taking a leadership role in becoming more proactive about industry issues, particularly around environmental and corporate responsibility issues. He has participated in various meetings and working groups, and drafted countless briefs, articles and reports to raise awareness of industry concerns and needs with governments, Canadian Stakeholders and NGOs.\n\nMr. Wallis has been an integral member of the Annual Convention Planning Committee. Serving on the committee for 13 years, Mr. Wallis has organized more than 12 technical sessions, chairing one or more sessions each year, and has been a technical presenter a number of times. A natural leader, Mr. Wallis has worked hard with the committee raising the convention standard year after year.\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Wallis has participated in various provincial and national industry associations, including Geological Association of Canada; Canadian Institute of Mining; Canadian Geological Council; Canadian Geological Foundation; Ontario Ministry of Economic Development; Ontario Science and Industry Grant Council; Ontario Geological Research Fund Committee; Toronto Geological Discussion Group; and Industry Advisory Board to the Ontario Geological Survey.\n\nGlenn Nolan\n\nFor his leadership in fostering economic opportunities for First Nations on their traditional lands, and for his long history of volunteerism\n\nGlenn Nolan is receiving the very award he helped create as co-chair of the PDAC's Indigenous Affairs Committee. Glenn was elected as PDAC director in 2005 and went on to serve as the association's first Indigenous president from 2012 to 2014.\n\nGlenn is known as an accomplished bridge builder between Indigenous communities and the mining industry in Ontario. As former Chief of the Missanabie Cree First Nation, he understands the struggles and aspirations of Indigenous peoples. As an executive of Ring of Fire Metals (formerly Noront Resources), he appreciates the challenges exploration companies face as they try to advance mineral projects. Glenn continues to help foster stronger local Indigenous involvement and participation with Ring of Fire Metals.\n\nFollowing in his father's footsteps, Glenn spent most of his career in the mining sector. He formed his own contracting firm to conduct geophysical surveys, line cutting and claim staking for mineral exploration across Northern Canada before moving on to other business ventures.\n\nGlenn has supported the development of economic opportunities for Indigenous peoples world-wide. He has supported the government of Canada’s efforts to bring awareness of mining opportunities to Indigenous people throughout the Americas. He continues to support the Shuar people of Ecuador and Peru to help establish better relations with government and the mining sectors and was chair of the Canadian Executive Service Organization (now Catalyste+).\n\nAfter dedicating his life’s work to meaningful engagement and consultation between industry and Indigenous communities, including countless hours of volunteer work with PDAC, it's Glenn's turn to be recognized by his peers.\n\nNalaine Morin\n\nFor combining Indigenous traditional knowledge with Western science to improve the environmental assessment process for mining projects\n\nAs a nationally recognized environmental assessment consultant, Nalaine Morin is known for her ability to bridge the gap between Indigenous Peoples and the mining industry by combining traditional knowledge with Western science.\n\nA member of the Tahltan First Nation, Nalaine has a deep technical understanding of both mining and environmental assessment. She uses this unique background to assist companies and Indigenous communities navigating the complex waters of technical review, community consultation and permitting in British Columbia (BC). She was instrumental in creating and executing a joint permitting process and agreement for the Red Chris mine, for example, that ensures the Tahltan share in regulatory oversight of the mine.\n\nNalaine, principal of ArrowBlade Consulting Services, is a member of BC’s standing Code Review Committee. As an Indigenous representative, she encouraged the province to revise the Code, making it among the strongest in the world for tailings storage. She served as a panel member for the proposed Prosperity Mine project for the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, is the technical advisor for the Citxw Nlaka’pamux Assembly’s traditional stewardship department, is a founder of the Tahltan heritage resource environmental assessment team, and serves as a director on the BC Hydro board and for Geoscience BC.\n\nNalaine holds a BSc in metals and materials engineering from UBC and a mechanical engineering technology diploma from the BC Institute of Technology. She is a guest lecturer at UBC’s School of Engineering, where she is known for her ability to connect with students and prepare them for work as engineers in a changing regulatory environment.\n\nSam Bosum, President, Native Exploration Services\n\nFor his strong and continued efforts to encourage and mentor Cree youth to pursue a career in mineral exploration.\n\nSam Bosum has been working with mining and exploration companies in the Chibougamau region of Québec for nearly 50 years. He began his career in the area in the 1960s, and has worked as a Director of several mining and exploration companies.\n\nCurrently the President of Native Exploration Services, an Aboriginal-owned company founded in 1984, Sam is based in the Oujé-Bougoumou Cree Nation, Québec. Native Exploration Services provides staking, line-cutting, and geophysical services to both the mining and exploration industries, and provides training in the field of basic mineral exploration methodologies (prospecting and sampling). The company offers significant employment and business opportunities in the region, and is considered a major employer in the Oujé-Bougoumou Cree Nation.\n\nSam has been a member of the Band Council of the Oujé-Bougoumou Cree Nation for the past 38 years and has focused his efforts on advancing the affairs of his community. During this time he has served as Deputy Chief and was elected as Chief in 2001, a position he held for eight years. Sam is still an active member of the Band Council of the Oujé-Bougoumou Cree Nation. He works to inspire and encourage the youth of his community to pursue their education and achieve the goals they set for themselves in their future careers, including that of geologists.\n\nJim MacLeod, President J.A. MacLeod Exploration and EnviroCree Ltd.\n\nFor his strong leadership in the environmental impact of the mining sector and his work advocating for more education and training programs for Aboriginal youth within the industry.\n\nMr. James MacLeod, a Cree resident of Mistissini, Quebec, is well known and respected in the mineral industry throughout Canada as a mining exploration technologist. Mr. MacLeod is a pioneer in mineral exploration and environmental impact and from the beginning recognized the link between mining and environment, and the importance of managing the relationship.\n\nMr. MacLeod began his career in mineral exploration as a young man, and founded J.A. MacLeod Exploration in 1987. Focussing his energy, knowledge and expertise on mineral exploration, Mr. Macleod has demonstrated a passion for field work, and built a strong reputation. In 2009, he founded EnviroCree Ltd ., an Aboriginal company specializing in environmental services. Both companies employ a local Aboriginal workforce, providing learning opportunities and training programs for Cree youth.\n\nMr. MacLeod is a strong advocate of education and advises youth to participate in all forms of training available to them. Over the years, he has given a number of courses in the mineral exploration domain, financially supported by the CHRD (Cree Human Resources Development). In the Spring of 2013, EnviroCree provided 9 Crees of Mistissini and Oujé-Bougoumou with the opportunity to participate in the Building Environmental Aboriginal Human Resources (BEAHR) Training Program, prepared by Eco-Canada.\n\nFounder of the Mistissini Geological Resources Centre, Mr. MacLeod has worked closely with native communities as a consultant on projects and training in mining exploration. He also serves on the Board of Directors of Cree Mineral Exploration Board, and Canadian Aboriginal Minerals Association.\n\nMotion: Be it resolved that the board approve the above recommendations proposed by the Awards Committee for the 2014 annual awards.\n\nThe Lundin Foundation\n\nFor creating an organization funded by mining revenue with the sole purpose of providing lasting benefits for communities surrounding Lundin Group companies operations\n\nThe first question country leaders often ask when a company wishes to develop a mine within their borders is how communities will benefit from the development. The Lundin Group of companies, consist of 11 publicly traded companies operating in over 20 countries, can provide concrete examples of how the Lundin Foundation leverages resource development to provide local economic opportunities.\n\nIn 2021 alone, the Foundation supported 650 small businesses that generated $42 million in revenues and provided 2,000 well-paying jobs. The Foundation helped 79 start-ups launch solutions to climate change, attracting $30 million in third party funding to bring those solutions to market.\n\nTo encourage career development in Ecuador, the Foundation developed and delivered a training program for community members with no previous experience to become best-in-class process plant and mine operators at the Fruta del Norte gold mine, Ecuador's first large-scale underground mine. At the start of the program, 50% of the 315 trainees were either unemployed or underemployed. One year after completing the program, 80% of the trainees - including women - were employed as operators, bringing home a cumulative US$3.2 million in wages.\n\nIn the communities surrounding the mine, the Foundation provided technical and financial support a local agricultural cooperative, to establish organic farm management practices and achieve organic certification. As a result, the cooperative's 180 producers, whose products include coffee, cocoa, yuca and plantain, now export to Europe, North America and other South American countries.\n\nThese are just two examples of how the foundation is improving the lives of people near the Lundin Group of companies' operations. Given the quantities of metals and minerals required to meet future generations' needs, coupled with the complexities of securing and maintaining a social licence to operate, the Lundin Foundation provides a model for the industry on how mining can foster a more sustainable future.\n\nB2Gold\n\nFor exemplary resettlement and community development work with the village of Fadougou at the Fekola gold mine in Mali\n\nWhen B2Gold, an operator of several mines and development projects worldwide, acquired the Fekola Project in Mali in 2014, the village of Fadougou was located near the perimeter of the proposed open pit. Although relocating the residents wasn’t a condition of the mine permit, it soon became obvious that building a new village was an opportunity to invest in the long-term social and economic development of the villagers.\n\nResettlement is a disruptive, stressful process. So it was only after extensive engagement with the government and community members that B2Gold devised a resettlement plan to account for risks such as loss of homes, loss of livelihoods and access to land, and social disorganization.\n\nThe collaborative effort went beyond managing these risks. It improved living conditions in Fadougou by providing services, education and training, building new infrastructure and diversifying the economy. The resettlement project employed 400 members of the community during construction. It gave traditionally marginalized women a role in the planning and execution of the resettlement. And, most importantly, the process positioned the whole region for social and economic growth beyond the life of the Fekola Mine.\n\nA cornerstone of the process was a training program called AFECK sponsored by B2Gold and the Canadian government. The four-year program provided trade skills such as carpentry, concrete finishing and solar panel installation to community members so they could participate in village construction. AFECK also offered training and support to local entrepreneurs, resulting in several new businesses. A permanent vocational centre was established to train youth in locally relevant skills such as masonry, catering and auto mechanics.\n\nAnother critical component was a grievance mechanism that allowed people affected by the resettlement to formally express their concerns and complaints. If complainants disagreed with the proposed resolution, they could appeal to a Community Resettlement Committee composed of village members, women, youth, in-migrants and local authorities.\n\nThe Fekola Mine reached commercial production in 2017 and the village construction began later that year. The first residents moved to New Fadougou in April 2019, and since then 912 households representing 3,241 people have completed the move. B2Gold continues to invest in the village of New Fadougou to ensure their long-term success. In 2018, a three-year Community Development Plan (CDP) was developed with surrounding communities, setting mid-term and long-term objectives for their own development. Current projects include improved access to potable water infrastructure, construction of primary and secondary schools, equipment and capacity building on advanced agricultural techniques.\n\nB2Gold believes that it has a responsibility to share benefits and leave a positive legacy with communities that will last beyond the life of its mines and seeks to build a trust-based relationship with local stakeholders. The resettlement and development of the village of Fadougou by its Fekola Gold Mine demonstrates this commitment to responsible mining and to international best practice in community relations and development.\n\nTeck Resources Limited\n\nFor its outstanding accomplishments and commitment to sustainability, environmental and social initiatives.\n\nTeck is Canada's largest diversified mining company, with assets in Canada, the USA, Chile and Peru. The company has learned over its 100-year history that responsible mining and mineral development are fundamental to long-term success. Teck’s approach to business is guided by its pursuit of sustainability.\n\nIn 2011, Teck developed a comprehensive sustainability strategy, focusing on long and short term goals that will achieve the company’s vision for sustainability. The sustainability strategy supports six key areas that represent the biggest challenges and opportunities for the mining sector: community, our people, water, biodiversity, energy, and materials stewardship.\n\nTeck is committed to investing in environmental and social initiatives with communities and organizations that align with the company’s business objectives and sustainability efforts both locally and globally.

But when the Chalice Mining team of Kevin Frost and Morgan Fréjabise studied publicly available airborne magnetic surveys supported by other regional geoscience datasets, they saw the hallmarks of an ultramafic-mafic intrusive complex hidden beneath the cover. By later applying electromagnetics on the ground and multi-element soil geochemistry, they were able to hone in on the rich deposit of metals now known as the Gonneville deposit.\n\nThe Chalice team spent a very modest ~A$50,000 at the project to define a drill-ready target and in early 2020, the maiden drill hole intersected a remarkable 19 metres grading 2.6% nickel, 1.0% copper, 0.14% cobalt, 8.4 grams per tonne (g/t) palladium and 1.1g/t platinum at a shallow depth of about 40 metres. The drill hole uncovered one of the most significant nickel sulphide discoveries in recent global history, and the largest PGE discovery ever in Australia.\n\nThe Gonneville deposit is particularly significant because of the range of valuable metals it contains, its scale and its shallow starting depth. Palladium, platinum, nickel, copper and cobalt are all critical to decarbonisation and green technologies. The discovery has established a new mineral province along the western edge of the Yilgarn Craton (the West Yilgarn Province) with over a thousand kilometres of unexplored potential.\n\nIn July 2022, Chalice released an updated Mineral Resource Estimate for Gonneville of 350 million tonnes grading 0.58% nickel equivalent (NiEq) or 1.8 g/t palladium equivalent (PdEq), containing 11 million ounces of PGEs and gold, 560 thousand tonnes of nickel, 360 thousand tonnes of copper and 54 thousand tonnes of cobalt. The deposit remains open beyond a depth of ~700m and open to the north along strike, which is quite remarkable when considering over 275km of drilling has been completed to date.\n\nK92 Mining\n\nFor the 2017 discovery of the Kora North deposit at the Kainantu mine in Papua New Guinea\n\nWhen K92 Mining acquired the Kainantu gold mine in Papua New Guinea from Barrick Gold in 2015, the operation had been mothballed for several years. By questioning the geological model and acting on the reinterpretation, the K92 exploration team transformed the previously struggling mine into a highly profitable and rapidly expanding gold producer.\n\nThe breakthrough came in 2017, when K92 tested the theory that two of the mine’s deposits, Kora and Eutompi, were in fact the same deposit. The team modified the development design to access the untested area 500 metres to the north of Kora and 400 metres below Eutompi. The first drill hole intersected 5.4 metres grading 11.68 grams per tonne gold and 1.33% copper about 500 metres north of the Kora deposit.\n\nSince then, the combined Kora North, Kora and Eutompi measured, indicated and inferred resource has grown to almost 5 million ounces AuEq at a discovery cost of less than US$5 per ounce. The exceptional characteristics of the Kora North discovery have allowed Kainantu to operate at head grade of more than 18 grams gold per tonne, placing the mine among the highest-grade operators in the world. An operation that was struggling to achieve 50,000 ounces annual production is now on track to produce more than 300,000 ounces gold per year upon completion of its Stage 3 expansion, due to come on line by late 2023.\n\nIn September 2020, K92 completed the commissioning of a process plant expansion, doubling throughput to 400,000 tonnes per year and increasing annual production to 120,000 ounces. The next phase of expansion will more than double throughput again, to one million tonnes per year.\n\nA preliminary economic assessment (PEA) calls for production of 318,000 ounces AuEq annually at all-in sustaining costs of US$489 per AuEq beginning in 2023 and running until 2033. At a gold price of US$1,500 per ounce, the after-tax NPV is US$1.5 billion.\n\nIn addition, there are several high priority targets close to current mining operations at Kainantu that promise to rapidly boost existing resources through both underground and surface drilling.\n\nKamoa Discovery Team, Ivanhoe Mines\n\nFor the team’s discovery of the Kamoa Copper Deposit, Central African Copperbelt, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\n\nThe Ivanhoe Mines Kamoa Discovery Team is the recipient of this year’s Thayer Lindsley Award for international mineral discoveries. The team is receiving the award for discovery of the Kamoa Copper Deposit in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\n\nThe deposit is located in the Central African Copperbelt on the western edge of the Katangan basin, approximately 25 km west of the Kolwezi district. The deposit is a new and blind grassroots discovery in an area previously written off by other explorers because of its lack of Mines Series rocks, as well as of surface mineralization.\n\nIn January 2013, a new independent mineral resource estimate was prepared for the Kamoa Copper Discovery by AMEC E&C Services of Reno, Nevada. The new estimate ranks Kamoa as Africa's largest high-grade copper discovery and the world's largest undeveloped high-grade copper discovery. As of January 2013, Ivanhoe Mines had discovered indicated mineral resources of 739 million tonnes grading 2.67% copper, containing 43.5 billion pounds of copper, and inferred mineral resources of 227 million tonnes grading 1.96% copper, containing 9.8 billion pounds of copper. A 1% copper cut-off grade and a minimum vertical mining thickness of three metres was applied in each classification.\n\nThe Kamoa Discovery Team was led by Dr. David Broughton, Executive Vice President of Exploration at Ivanhoe Mines, and Thomas Rogers, Director of Exploration, African Mining Consultants. In addition, the team included David Edwards, Geology Manager, Kamoa Project, Ivanhoe Mines; Dr. Douglas Haynes, Director, Douglas Haynes Discovery Pty. Ltd.; Dr. Ross McGowan, formerly of African Mining Consultants and currently CEO, Armada Exploration Ltd.; and Steven McMullan, P. Geo., Site Manager at Ivanhoe Mines’ Kipushi Project, and Principal Geoscientist, African Mining Consultants.\n\nGoldrush Discovery Team, Barrick Gold Corporation\n\nFor the team’s discovery of the 14.1 million ounce Goldrush deposit in Cortez District, Nevada, USA.\n\nIn September 2011, Barrick announced its Goldrush discovery in Cortez District, Nevada.\n\nThe deposit, located in the eastern portion of the Cortez mining district, 6 km southeast of Cortex Hills, potentially represents the largest Carlin-style discovery in Nevada since Cortez Hills over 10 years ago.\n\nThe Cortez District has had a long discovery history and is challenged by concealed mineralization. Using an integrated exploration program based on understanding of deposit model and local stratigraphy, the discovery team used improved geologic interpretations and exploration techniques to discover and delineate the concealed deposit.\n\nThe Goldrush deposit has the third highest grade and is one of just +10 million ounce gold discoveries since 2001. Through aggressive exploration, the initial resource discovered at Goldrush has grown from 3.5 million to 14.1 million ounces, and now has a strike length of +7 km. A scoping study of the site has recently been completed and a prefeasibility study is underway while exploration work and technical studies continue. A number of development options are currently being considered, including open pit mining, underground mining, or a combination of both.\n\nThe 25 person Goldrush Discovery Team was led by Rob Krcmarov, Senior Vice President, Global Exploration (Toronto), François Robert, Vice President and Chief Geologist (Toronto), Ed Cope, Vice President, Exploration North America (Elko, Nevada), Kevin Creel (Chief Exploration Geologist), Mark Bradley (District Geologist) and Alejandro Ly (Project Geologist). The team’s knowledge and expertise of Carlin deposits and Nevada geology was instrumental in the discovery of Goldrush.\n\nAlamos Gold’s John A. McCluskey\n\nFor showing leadership and a willingness to take risks in the acquisition and development of the Island Gold mine in Northern Ontario\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of geological data, President and CEO John McCluskey and the senior management team of Alamos Gold were confident the Island Gold deposit owned by Richmont Mines was larger and richer than the published mineral reserves and resources would suggest. However, shareholders balked at the acquisition price paid with Alamos’ share price plummeting by 17% on the date of announcement of the acquisition in September 2017.\n\nBut McCluskey and the Alamos team were right to bet on the exploration potential of the Island Gold. Since acquisition, Island Gold has grown dramatically: reserves and resources have almost tripled to 5.1 million ounces from 1.8 million ounces in 2017; the mine life has more than doubled to 18 years at higher production rates; and the exploration potential has expanded through the acquisition of a substantial land package surrounding the mine.\n\nBy taking a calculated risk, McCluskey realized his 20-year dream of building a leading intermediate gold producer. Five years after the transaction, Island Gold is valued at nearly three times its acquisition price and the operation continues to grow through a self-financed expansion that will transform Island Gold into one of the largest and most profitable gold mines in Canada. Once unappreciated and misunderstood, the mine and its expansion are helping support and sustain local communities in Northern Ontario.\n\nThe Island Gold acquisition and development is the latest in a string of strategically driven acquisitions for Alamos, from the Mulatos mine in Mexico in 2003 to the Young-Davidson operation in northern Ontario in 2015. Island Gold may well turn out to be the company's best acquisition reflecting McCluskey’s vision, strategy and perseverance.\n\nMark O'Dea\n\nFor building and financing several international mining companies, taking them from exploration and discovery to development and operations.\n\nSince winning second place in the Goldcorp Challenge in 2001, Mark O’Dea has built and financed several mining companies with worldwide operations.\n\nGreat projects in good places. This statement acts as Mark’s keel and compass to building a portfolio of quality mining companies that have crystallized C$3 billion in shareholder value.\n\nMark launched his first company, Fronteer Gold in 2001. A decade later, at the top of the last mining cycle, the young geologist sold Fronteer and its flagship Long Canyon gold project in Nevada to Newmont Mining for US$2.3 billion. He had vended Fronteer’s uranium assets in Labrador a year earlier for C$260 million.\n\nMark then scaled up his business platform by founding Oxygen Capital, to structure, finance, build and manage mining companies. True Gold Mining is just one example of this, putting the Karma gold mine in Burkina Faso into production. With traditional bank financing unavailable for gold projects in West Africa, Mark tapped into existing corporate relationships and private equity to raise C$33.5 million at a low point in the mining cycle. He and his team were later able to convince Franco-Nevada and Sandstorm to provide a syndicated gold loan and streaming package worth C$120 million, the first partnership of its kind for a single asset developer. Endeavour Mining purchased True Gold for C$240 million in 2016.\n\nPure Gold Mining is another example. Securing support from large corporates and mining titans, the PureGold Mine in Red Lake Ontario is scheduled to complete its first gold pour in December 2020, becoming Canada’s newest high-grade gold mine.\n\nMark has guided his companies by an ethos developed at the outset of his career: The Science of Discovery. Every company and project he worked on was science-driven, identified undervalued assets, defined team culture, while simultaneously leveraging existing and new financing avenues to advance projects to commercial status.\n\nMark has shown an intrinsic knack for bringing together and motivating top-tier talent, allowing him to build teams bound for success. Creativity and resourcefulness are some of the core traits he seeks in every team member, and he attributes his success to those he has worked with over the past 20 years.\n\nToday, Mark remains actively involved with his Oxygen portfolio companies and continues to be committed to a strong mining industry that balances responsible environmental stewardship, community benefits and sound financial returns.\n\nMatt Manson, President and Chief Executive Officer, Stornoway Diamond Corporation\n\nFor leading Stornoway’s team in the continuing development of the company’s Renard Project located in the James Bay region of Québec.\n\nMatt Manson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Stornoway Diamond Corporation, is the recipient of this year’s Viola R. MacMillan Award for company or mine development. He is receiving the award for leading Stornoway’s team in the continuing development of the company’s Renard Project located in the James Bay region of Québec. The team completed its $946 million project financing package this past July, more than 13 years after the project’s initial discovery.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Matt, then President and CEO of Contact Diamond Corporation, was looking for growth opportunity and concluded that Ashton Mining of Canada’s 50 per cent interest in the Renard Property was Canada’s best undeveloped diamond asset at the time. He knew that Contact Diamond would not be able to acquire Ashton Mining alone, and approached Stornoway Diamond Corporation to propose a merger, which was completed in September 2006. In April 2011, Stornoway acquired the remaining 50 per cent of the Renard Property from Diaquem, Soquem, and Investissement Quebec.\n\nMatt took the Renard Project through its various phases of development, modifying and adjusting plans to ensure development. Over this period, he has also built up strong relationships with the Québec Government and the Cree Nation and has made them active partners with Stornoway. Most impressively he has put in place the financing necessary to construct the Renard Mine, despite extremely difficult markets.\n\nCapstone Resources Corp.\n\nFor demonstrating leadership and management in the successful development of the Minto and Cozamin copper mines and in its acquisition of Pinto Valley Copper Mine, transforming it into an intermediate copper producer.\n\nCapstone Resources Corp., a Canadian base metals mining company, headquartered in Vancouver, purchased BHP Billiton’s Pinto Valley copper mining operation in Arizona, USA, in April 2013.\n\nThe Pinto Valley mine is the company’s third copper producing mine. Capstone Resources Corp. currently operates Minto Mine, an open pit copper-gold-silver mine in the Yukon, and Cozamin Mine, a copper-silver-zinc-lead underground mine in Zacatecas, Mexico. The annual production of both mines is approximately 85 million pounds of copper.\n\nLocated in the Globe-Miami mining district in Arizona, the Pinto Valley site is expected to produce 130 – 150 million pounds of copper in concentrate and approximately 10 million pounds of copper cathode annually, and by-product molybdenum and silver. The site’s estimated cash cost, for the first five years of production, is approximately $1.80 per pound (net of by-product credits).\n\nThe Pinto Valley acquisition transformed Capstone Resources Corp. from a mid-tier to an intermediate copper producer. The company’s annual copper production is projected to increase by more than 160%, from 85 M lbs Cu to 235 M lbs Cu, with the new Arizona mine.\n\nThe financing structure and purchase price of Pinto Valley allows Capstone Resources Corp. to maintain financial flexibility and retain $135 million cash providing them the necessary financial resources to continue funding development projects and avoid shareholder dilution.\n\nThe purchase of Pinto Valley allows Capstone Resources Corp. to further diversify its assets into Arizona, USA, one of the world’s most favourable mining jurisdictions."
