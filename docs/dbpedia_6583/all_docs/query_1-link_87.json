        "text": "Saltburn continues to draw people into its debauched ways since its Prime Video release in December 2023.\n\nIt wasn't just the numerous sex scenes that has got people talking, but also its eye-catching ending which sees Barry Keoghan's Oliver dance naked through Saltburn to Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder on the Dancefloor'.\n\nThe movie sees outsider Oliver invited by the very popular Felix (Jacob Elordi) to spend the summer in his family's massive country house where he meets the likes of Oliver's sister Venetia (Alison Oliver) and his mother Elsbeth (Rosamund Pike).\n\nHowever, Felix and the rest of the Catton family have no idea what Oliver has in store for them, leading to shocking twists among all the debauchery.\n\nIt might leave you with questions about what happened to Felix in Saltburn, why Oliver did what he did and more. So we're here with the definitive guide to Saltburn and all its mysteries.\n\nMajor spoilers ahead for Saltburn and its ending.\n\nWhat happened to Felix in Saltburn?\n\nSince the beginning, you might have realised Oliver is not as innocent as he seems to be. In fact, he has concocted an elaborate plan.\n\nAfter some days of absolute joy playing tennis while wearing tuxedos and having fancy alcohol-fuelled dinners, the relationship between Felix and Oliver starts to decay.\n\nFelix finds out Oliver was lying about his family — he told him his mother was an addict and his father was dead, when they're a very alive middle-class couple. As we learn soon enough, that wasn't Oliver's biggest deception.\n\nDespite Oliver losing Felix's trust, the Catton family moves forward with Oliver's birthday party in Saltburn, where costumes and debauchery are required.\n\nAt some point, Oliver follows Felix into the garden's maze, visibly drunk. They argue, but things don't seem to escalate as Oliver goes back to the party.\n\nThe next morning, Felix is found dead at the centre of the maze.\n\nWhat happened to Venetia in Saltburn?\n\nAfter the funeral and a really disturbing scene where Oliver has sex with Felix's muddy grave (and we mean that literally), the Catton family enjoy a post-mortem shepherd's pie as they try to eat up their emotions.\n\nFelix's friend Farleigh (Archie Madekwe) soon questions why Oliver is still there, since he is not family and hasn't been a friend of Felix's for long. Farleigh is the one who is kicked out, though, as the Catton family encourages Oliver to stay.\n\nThey don't have to ask him twice.\n\nNot all the Cattons are smitten with their guest. Venetia somehow knows he was involved in her brother's death. Sadly, she can't investigate further, since she is soon found dead in a bloody bathtub.\n\nWith a razorblade found at the scene – and given Venetia's known struggles with mental health – the death is ruled out as suicide. But we know it probably wasn't and that Oliver had something to do with it (more on that in a bit).\n\nIn these dark times, Oliver becomes a close support for Elsbeth, until eventually her husband James (Richard E Grant) offers him a substantial amount of money to leave.\n\nWhat happened to Farleigh in Saltburn?\n\nOf all the characters in the movie, Farleigh seems aware of who Oliver really is deep down – and that puts him on Oliver's radar.\n\nInitially, Oliver thinks he's won when he makes James think that Farleigh is going to sell some of the valuables in the house. Farleigh is evicted, but is soon back at Saltburn on the night of the fateful party.\n\nOliver manages to turn this to his advantage by telling James that Farleigh was supplying drugs at the party, hinting that he might have been indirectly responsible for Felix's death. James bans Farleigh from ever returning and withdraws all financial support.\n\nThe movie never explicitly states what happened to Farleigh, so you can assume that he just returned to the US. But if you wanted to be dark about it, maybe Oliver found a way to get rid of Farleigh permanently before he enacted the final stage of his plan.\n\nSaltburn ending explained\n\nSome time later after James pays Oliver to leave Saltburn, we're back at Oxford, where Elsbeth finds Oliver in a café working at his laptop.\n\nOliver knows that James has died as he read it in the newspaper (the one death Oliver had nothing to do with... probably), so he spots another chance to complete his plan.\n\nElsbeth invites Oliver back again to Saltburn where he grows close to her, and becomes a caretaker and companion for Elsbeth who, unsurprisingly, dies not long after in her hospital bed.\n\nBy that time, Oliver's masterplan is finally unveiled.\n\nIt turns out he planned this whole thing from the very beginning, ever since he arranged his first encounter with Felix in order to gain his sympathy and to be introduced to his friend's circle.\n\nOliver's long-term plan was always to steal the Catton family's immense fortune, and what a roaring success he made of it.\n\nTo achieve that, he killed Felix by leading him to drink from a poisoned champagne bottle (which Oliver poisoned) after they argued at the centre of the maze. Felix collapsed and there was nobody to help him.\n\nOliver also provided Venetia with the razor, knowing she was drunk, grieving and over the edge, capable of taking her own life in that moment. \"I broke her completely,\" he admits.\n\nHe doesn't seem to be responsible for James' death (just a happy coincidence), and there's some ambiguity about Elsbeth's sickness being natural or induced. He probably did slowly poison her though and, either way, he definitely suffocated her with a pillow.\n\nWhy did Oliver do what he did in Saltburn?\n\nHaving cleverly arranged for him to inherit the Catton fortune, Oliver is now the owner of Saltburn, so he gets all naked and dances to the rhythm of 'Murder on the Dancefloor'. (Think Hugh Grant in Love Actually, just more sinister.)\n\nWho wouldn't? His plan has worked flawlessly and now he's at the top of the food chain.\n\nAs for why he did it, you could say it was because he genuinely loved Felix and when Felix discovered who he really was and spurned him, that led Oliver to concoct his deadly plan to take everything Felix had for himself.\n\nEqually, if you were being bleaker, you could say that was always Oliver's plan and he just wanted to do it.\n\nIt depends how you want to read it, but there's definitely a reason for that naked dance at the end. Take it away Barry Keoghan.\n\n\"It's ownership. This is my place. It's full confidence in, 'I can do what I want in this manor. I can strip to my barest and waltz around because this is mine.'

You don't care what he does, you want him to do it. You are both completely repulsed and sort of on his side.\""
