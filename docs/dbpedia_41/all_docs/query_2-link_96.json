        "text": "For immediate release\n\nWAYLAND — The Wayland Planning Board is hosting a virtual public forum this month to receive input from residents and businesses on revitalization of Wayland’s Route 20 Corridor.\n\nWHEN:\n\nTuesday, Feb. 28 at 7 p.m.\n\nWHERE:\n\nClick here to find the Planning Board Zoom link\n\nWHAT:\n\nThe town’s consultant BETA Group, Inc. will present examples of possible future improvements along the Route 20 Corridor from the area around the Route 20/27/126 intersection west to the Sudbury River. The meeting is designed to foster community discussion.\n\nThe town asks community members to bring ideas and preferences for future improvements so that the town and its consultants can craft a viable Master Plan for the area.\n\nMultiple town boards are collaborating to create a renewed vision for the existing Route 20 commercial area that promotes an economically and socially vibrant, unified, “New England Village” town center. A major goal is to reduce Route 20’s dividing impact and provide increased connectivity and safety for pedestrians and bicyclists.\n\nIdeas for possible improvements focus on: lighting, plantings, improved locations for entrance driveways, distinct cross walk locations, traffic calming measures, and incorporating the rail trail that is located in the site area into the overall design of the Master Plan. The board welcomes additional ideas and suggestions.\n\n“Community ideas and participation are vital to achieving a viable plan for revitalization of the Route 20 Corridor, and we encourage community members to join us for what is sure to be a productive meeting,” Town Planner Robert Hummel said.\n\nFind more information about the plan click here.\n\n###"
