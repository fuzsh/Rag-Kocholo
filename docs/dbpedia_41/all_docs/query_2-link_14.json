To insure your Property Record Card is correct, it is important that we inspect as many properties as possible that have had construction activity during the past year.\n\nDuring Fall, we will be inspecting as many of the CY 2024 sales as possible. The protocol will be the same as detailed above regarding construction activity inspections.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.\n\nBy state mandate, the Board of Assessors is required to attempt an inspection of all properties at least once every 10 years. Per Wayland Board of Assessors policy, the time period is at least once every 6 years. This process is known as a cyclical property inspection program. On an ongoing basis, employees of the Wayland Assessors’ Office and sometimes hired contractors visit properties that are due to have an inspection.\n\nAlso, properties with construction activity (e.g., new construction, additions, finished basements, remodeling, etc.) are required to be inspected. If your home has building permit activity ongoing or recently completed, you should expect a visit by an assessor within the next few months.\n\nThirdly, it is very important that recent sales be inspected. Having the most accurate data possible for those properties allows for the best analysis of the sales in a given year, which in turn allows for more accurate valuation of all properties in town. Therefore, the office's ongoing sales inspection program is a key component of the overall property inspection program.\n\nFinally, office staff are always willing to inspect a property at the owner's request. Sometimes property owners have questions about the data are accurate or just want to make sure that their property information is correct.\n\nThe assessor will ask to do a full interior and exterior inspection in order to verify the accuracy of assessing records. At the least, an exterior inspection and front and rear photos are planned for all properties. A door hangar will be left if there is no answer at the door. Inspections generally take only about 10-15 minutes. If you prefer, you are invited to contact our office to schedule an appointment for an inspection.\n\nIf you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact the Assessors’ Office at 508-358-3788 or email us at by clicking here.\n\nIf you have questions regarding your proposed assessment please call (508) 358-3788 or stop by the Assessors’ Office at the Town Building during summer office hours: Mon 8:00a to 7:00p, Tu – Th 8:00a to 4:00p, Friday 8:00a - 12:30p."
