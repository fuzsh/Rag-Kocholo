        "text": "Sometimes I feel very blessed to live in such a beautiful state, especially one with so much water in the form of lakes, rivers, creeks, and ponds. It seems like anywhere you go in the state, there is some captivating body of water waiting to be explored. While most people are familiar with the larger lakes, they aren’t always acquainted with the smaller yet just as majestic ones. Loon Lake is one of these small but magnificent lakes.\n\nLoon Lake located outside of Wayland is an almost completely private lake with only one boat launch for those not living on the lake. This lake, although small, is exceptionally clean and very beautiful. This lake is a peaceful place to relax and enjoy the peacefulness of this quaint little lake community.\n\nLake Facts\n\nSurface Area: 141 Acres\n\nAverage Depth: 12 Feet\n\nMaximum Depth: 45 Feet\n\nShore Length: 3.1 Miles\n\nSurface Elevation: 1696 Feet\n\nWhat To Do In The Area\n\nLoon Lake Wetlands Preserve\n\nEnjoy a quiet place to observe Loon Lake and enjoy the emerging beauty of this beautiful park. This park does not allow swimming or boating. However, it appears to be an excellent fishing spot.\n\nStony Brook State Park\n\nStony Brook State Park is one of the prettiest State Parks in New York State. It is known for its superb waterfalls and exquisite scenery.\n\nGrimes Glen\n\nThis is a favorite cool-down spot. There are two magnificent waterfalls here and is a great place for creek hiking and swimming.\n\nHemlock Lake\n\nHemlock Lake is located on State Route 15A. There is a park and several boat launches located on Hemlock Lake. While swimming is not permitted, fishing is. Enjoy a hike on the Lake trail or a picnic in the park.\n\nCanadice Lake\n\nCanadice Lake is a lovely lake that is perfect for fishing, kayaking or just taking a stroll on its shores.\n\nBoating\n\nMotorboats are permitted on Loon Lake. However, given the Lake’s small size, there isn’t a large boat launch for public use. The only boat launch available to the public is located at the Laf-A-Lot Restaurant located on Laf-A-Lot Road. Although they do not charge people to launch, we suggest a small donation for the use of their boat launch for the cost of maintaining it.\n\nIf you are visiting on the 4th of July, it is a treat to see the resident of the Loon Lake community have the annual boat parade and “ring of fire”.\n\nKayaking/Canoeing\n\nThis lake is perfect for any sort of paddling including standup paddleboarding. Although there aren’t rental opportunities close to the lake, launching your own is fairly easy from the Laf-A-Lot Restaurant boat launch.\n\nFishing\n\nThere are lots of species of fish that live in Loon Lake such as largemouth bass, yellow perch, bullhead, smallmouth bass, pickerel, pumpkinseed, black crappie, and rock bass. Loon Lake is also a popular ice fishing destination.\n\nWhere to Eat\n\nLaf-A-Lot Restaurant – 100 Laf-A-Lot Road – Enjoy great food outside, on their deck, by the water or inside with the bar. Interesting fact: This restaurant has the oldest liquor license in New York State.\n\nSimply Autumn Cafe and Restaurant – 6 North Main St., Wayland – Word on the street is this is the best place to get breakfast.\n\nSteve’s Place – 11446 State Rte 21 S., Wayland –\n\nJim’s Diner – 22 N Main St., Wayland –\n\nSmitty’s Pop & Hops Shop – 11506 State Route 21, Wayland –\n\nWay-co Ice Cream Island – 2347 State Route 63, Wayland – All thing ice cream and yummy!\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nCottages and House Rentals – There are lots of rentals in the area. This is a great way to stay directly on the lake.\n\nCamping\n\nCamping is my favorite way to enjoy the great outdoors. There are a number of great campgrounds in the Loon Lake area.\n\nHoliday Hill Campground\n\nTamarack Campground\n\nHope Valley Camp\n\nSkybrook Campground\n\nSugar Creek Glen Campground\n\nStony Brook State Park\n\nHave you been to Loon Lake?
