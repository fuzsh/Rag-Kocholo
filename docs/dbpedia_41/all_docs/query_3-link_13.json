        "text": "Wayland, Massachusetts is a community located in Middlesex County that takes pride in its history and strong sense of civic engagement. Wayland is a somewhat rural town that strives to preserve open space. Wayland is home to award-winning public schools and Lake Cochituate. The town has an area of 15.9 square miles and a population of just over 13,000. The Framingham District Court serves the town of Wayland as well as the following communities:\n\nHolliston\n\nSudbury\n\nHopkinton\n\nAshland\n\nFramingham\n\nIf you are a resident of Wayland who has been charged with operating under the influence, Massachusetts criminal defense lawyer Stephen Neyman can help you to fight it.\n\nWhat Happens to my License After an OUI Arrest?\n\nFIRST OFFENSE OUI: For a first offense OUI, you will lose your license for 30 days if you failed the breath test or for 180 days if you refused the breath test. You could have your license suspended for one year if you are convicted, with a hardship license to be considered in 3 months.\n\nSECOND OFFENSE OUI: If this a your second OUI offense, then your license will be suspended for 3 years for a breath test refusal or for 30 days if you failed with a .08 BAC or higher. A conviction carries a 2-year loss of license.\n\nTHIRD OFFENSE OUI: Your license will be suspended for 5 years if you refuse to take a breathalyzer on a third offense OUI and for 30 days if you take the test and fail. A conviction carries an 8-year loss of license. Third offense OUIs are felonies.\n\nRepeat Offender Status\n\nPenalties are more severe for repeat offenders, and in Massachusetts there is lifetime lookback. If you had a case that was continued without a finding in the past and were assigned to an alcohol education program, this will count towards your subsequent offender status.\n\nMassachusetts Drunk Driving Defense\n\nIf you have been charged with operating under the influence, an experienced OUI lawyer can help you in countless ways. A lawyer will be able to look into the circumstances of your stop, explore whether the police advised you of certain rights, challenge the breathalyzer and its results, create reasonable doubt at a trial, and much more. You should talk with a lawyer as soon as possible because it is extremely helpful to have an attorney on your side from start to finish.\n\nExperienced OUI Lawyer\n\nStephen Neyman has more than 20 years of experience defending persons who have been accused of driving under the influence. He is among the very best and most qualified drunk driving/OUI/DUI lawyers in Massachusetts. He offers his clients not only his expertise, but also attentive service, aggressive courtroom presence, and tireless work ethic.\n\nLaw Offices of Stephen Neyman, P.C. 617-263-6800"
