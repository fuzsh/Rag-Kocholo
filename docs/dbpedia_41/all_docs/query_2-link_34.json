        "text": "This is the first of a series of stories about the 28 sites along the Allegan County History Alive! Heritage Trail. While traveling the 122-mile loop through the county, tourists can learn about the county's history, view scenic areas and discover unique restaurants, stores and other attractions. While the trail is designed for traveling in a clockwise direction, tourists can start their journey at any point on the loop. Before hitting the trail, tourists can purchase a booklet, CD and map of the trail. For more information, visit www.visitallegancounty.org or call the Allegan County Tourist Council at 1-888-ALLEGAN. The City of Wayland\n\nWayland, located off U.S. 131 between Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo, is Site 25 on the Heritage Trail. Wayland was established as a village in 1868 and was primarily a lumber and farming community. As of 2007, the population of Wayland was around 3,831.\n\nThe heart of Wayland's historical downtown is at Main and Superior, which can be reached by taking the Wayland exit off U.S. 131, driving east on Superior. Due to a summer long Superior road project, travelers should follow the detour signs to reach the downtown area.\n\nThe best way to see downtown Wayland is on foot. While searching for historical buildings, visitors can visit local shops, order pizza, purchase gifts and flowers, enjoy gourmet coffee or learn more about the city by visiting the Wayland Area Chamber of Commerce at 117 S. Main St.\n\nThe former name of Wayland is Chambers Corners, although while standing at Main and Superior, visitors might have a hard time imagining what it was like when Nelson Chambers built his cabin there in 1838.\n\nAccording to local legend, wolves roamed the woods in the area and Chambers' wife once rescued her husband from a pack of the animals, using a lit torch to drive them away.\n\nWayland's oldest building\n\nLike many communities on the Heritage Trail, Wayland was devastated by a series of fires. With so many wooden buildings, heated by wood stoves and lit by oil lamps and candles, fire was a constant threat. In 1902, a fire destroyed the southwest block of Main and Superior. Only one building was unscathed and can still be seen today. The modest red barn in the parking lot near Bentley's Party Store at 145 W. Superior is the lone survivor of fire of 1902.\n\nThe library that Julia built\n\nThe architectural jewel of Wayland's historical district is Henika District Library at 149 S. Main. A registered historical site marker tells the building's history. Julia Henika died in 1899 when Wayland was still a pioneer town, leaving $2,000 for the building of a library. Henika left the library to the Wayland Ladies Library Association. The original name of the library was the Henika Ladies Library. Opened in 1900, the library is made of fieldstone gathered from a local farm. The interior of the library features pressed tin ceilings and contemporary artwork that harmonizes with the vintage interior. For more information about Henika and its history, visit www.henikalibrary.org.\n\nBank, or City Hall?\n\nFirst time visitors to Wayland might be confused over whether 103 S. Main is a bank or City Hall. The brick building's facade has a modern sign that reads, \"Wayland City Hall,\" while a vintage stone sign reads, \"Wayland State Bank,\" along with the date 1917. Now used as City Hall, the building is the site of the former Wayland State Bank that later grew to become United Bank of Michigan. During a facade restoration project, the old sign was revealed and citizens and local officials decided to leave it uncovered as a tribute to the building's history.\n\nEnsign W. Pickett, who once ran a small bank out of Pickett Brother's General Store, founded Wayland State Bank in 1904 with $20,000 in capital. The bank's name was later changed to United Bank and there are now multiple branches of the bank in the Wayland, Dorr, Gun Lake and Grand Rapids area.\n\nThe Interurban Trail\n\nVisitors can see what is left of the Interurban Trail, a former commuter railway line that ran from Grand Rapids to Kalamazoo. The local portion of the trail runs from the north end of Dahlia Street in Wayland, south to 133rd Avenue in Bradley in Wayland Township. A local group, \"Friends of the Interurban Trail (FIT), is working towards the goal of developing Wayland's portion of the trail for the use of hikers, joggers and bicyclists.\n\nPenasee Globe has long history\n\nKnown by various names and with various publishers and editors, the Wayland area paper has been in publication since the 1800s. Although the owners and the format of the paper has changed, the Penasee Globe still serves as a weekly community newspaper for citizens of Wayland, Shelbyville, Dorr, the Gun Lake area, Hopkins, Monterey Township and other local communities.\n\nThe Penasee Globe, located at 206 S. Main, is now part of the Advance family of newspapers."
