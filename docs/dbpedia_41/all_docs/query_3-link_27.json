        "text": "Springwater-Wayland EMS provides Emergency Medical Services to the town of Wayland.\n\nHistorically, both Springwater and Wayland were covered by ambulance services operated by the respective town fire departments. In 2013, both Springwater FD and Wayland FD got together and began working on a project to combine ambulances services into a new non-profit corporation with the goal of improving services without adding an appreciable cost to the taxpayers.\n\nSpringwater-Wayland Emergency Medical Services Corp was borne out of that project and was formed as a 501(c)3 non-profit corporation. We currently cover the Town of Wayland for EMS services, comprising of 39 square miles. We provide 24×7 coverage using 2 front line ambulances staffed with volunteer Emergency Medical Technicians and drivers. Whenever an ambulance is dispatched to a call, it is staffed by at least one EMT, as required by NYS regulations. Our ambulances are equipped with all of the required equipment for a Basic Life Support service, including the latest in Semi-automatic Defibrillators.\n\nDispatching\n\nSWEMS is dispatched by Steuben County 911. All apparatus has radio equipment to communicate with both the county dispatch center as well as other EMS and Fire units on a scene.\n\nMembers are issued a Voice pager to receive toned out calls. In addition, SWEMS utilizes I Am Responding software and has a display in the base that is constantly updated. This software is directly tied into the Steuben County Dispatch center and all members can use their cell phone to notify dispatch and members at the base if they are responding as well as if they have a delayed response. This software improves our ability to ensure coverage of all calls.\n\nEvents\n\nSWEMS provides EMS coverage for community events, just as the various fire departments has done in the past. SWEMS has provided coverage to various community events, including football games, wrestling tournaments, and festivals. SWEMS is also the current sponsor of the Wayland Fun Days, held annually in July.\n\nIf you are interested in having SWEMS provide EMS coverage for your event in our district, please contact us.\n\nPublic Training"
