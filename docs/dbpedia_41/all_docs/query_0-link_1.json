The town is in the northern part of the county, northwest of Bath, New York.\n\nThe first settler arrived around 1794. At that time, the area was home to the Seneca Indians.[3] The town was formed from parts of four other towns in 1843.

From 1882 to 1963, Avoca and Wallace were also served by the New York (Hoboken) to Buffalo Main Line of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (and its Erie Lackawanna successor). This through route was also severed in 1963 by order of the ICC, at EL's request.
