        "text": "Town in New York, United States\n\nCampbell is a town in Steuben County, New York, United States. The population was 3,163 at the 2020 census.[2] The name is from Robert Campbell, an early landowner. The town is centrally located in the county and is northwest of Corning.\n\nCampbell was first settled around 1801. The town was formed in 1831 from the town of Hornby.\n\nThe District School Number Five and Wood Road Metal Truss Bridge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[3]\n\nCampbell was the birthplace, in 1869, of Illinois Attorney General Edward J. Brundage and, in 1874, of IBM founder Thomas J. Watson, Sr. Locally the town is known as Camp-Bell, probably after a campground of the same name.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 40.8 square miles (106 km2), of which 40.8 square miles (106 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) (0.07%) is water.\n\nInterstate 86 (including New York State Route 17), New York State Route 415 and the Conhocton River pass through the town.\n\nFormer New York State Route 333, now County Road 333, enters the town from the west.\n\nCampbell is on the Gang Mills (Painted Post) Line of the B&H Rail Corporation. This portion of track was opened in 1882 as the New York (Hoboken) to Buffalo line of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad. In 1963, the route to Buffalo was severed between Wayland and Groveland, N.Y., by order of the U. S. Interstate Commerce Commission in order to promote highway transportation.\n\nCampbell was also served (c. 1853-1963) by the Corning-Rochester line of the Erie Railroad. This line was removed in 1963 by the ICC, also in order to promote highway transportation.\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1840852—18501,17537.9%18601,62238.0%18701,98922.6%18801,881−5.4%18901,533−18.5%19001,467−4.3%19101,204−17.9%19201,032−14.3%19301,26322.4%19401,47216.5%19501,81423.2%19602,47136.2%19703,18028.7%19803,80119.5%19903,658−3.8%20003,6910.9%20103,406−7.7%20203,163−7.1%2021 (est.)3,121[2]−1.3%\n\nAs of the census[5] of 2000, there were 3,691 people, 1,418 households, and 1,036 families residing in the town.
