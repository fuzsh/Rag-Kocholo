        "text": "I don't live in Wayland, but I'm very familiar with the area. My sister and her family lived there for about ten years.\n\nI think that all the reasons you mentioned contribute to the fact that Wayland gets less mention than some nearby towns. Something I think figures in here is that Boston's western suburbs overall are the most affluent section of the metro area. There are some individual towns which are exceptions to this, at least to a degree, but generally the area is very much the high-rent district. This puts Wayland in a funny position. It's a very nice town itself, with neighborhoods that are more upscale than those which apparently you have passed through. Therefore, Wayland is expensive on average. Because of this, it may often miss out on getting suggested to people coming here seeking towns that are relatively less costly. At the same time, the lack of commuter rail and the neighborhoods with more modest properties leave Wayland seeming like maybe not quite as good a choice as some nearby towns for those asking about the area who have very high housing budgets.\n\nIt's a nice town, though. And in fact one of the negative factors you mentioned isn't quite true. That would be the lack of a town center. Although the official town center is at present just a couple of smal strip malls and an office building or two along a highway, there is a commercial district in Wayland's Cochituate section which resembles a small-town downtown area, with the only difference being that Cochituate Village, as this commercial zone is referred to at times, has a few small shopping centers mixed in with the individual stores right up against the street that are more characteristic of a typical downtown. As you move away from the main intersection in Cochituate, the businesses also tend to be spread out along the street to some degree. Because of this the area does not have the cohesive appearance usually associated with the term \"dowontown.\" However, the basic local small businesses you typically find in the downtown of a small town are located in that area, so functionally it serves as a legitimate town center.\n\nFrom what you describe of the neighborhoods you've seen, I'm guessing that you've passed through or near Cochituate. From this area, it's a short drive to the commuter rail station in Natick center. I'm not sure what the parking situation is at that station. If parking in Natick center is good, then Cochituate is located no farther from the nearest train station than you'd find in many neighborhoods of some other spread out, low-density suburbs in the area, like Weston.\n\nSo, really, it seems that Wayland is basically in a funny in-between position, too expensive for many people who don't have really large housing budgets, but for those who can afford highly expensive housing not quite as elite a location as some other towns in the vicinity. It's a very nice town, though. Assuming that generally low-density kinds of suburbs work for you, if you find a smaller house in your price range which works for you, I'd give Wayland a big thumbs up, and say go for it.\n\nOne vote for Wayland\n\nHi, MABound,\n\nI live in Wayland and I sometimes share your puzzlement about Wayland's omission from discussions of great places to live. I think the lack of a cohesive downtown is probably the main reason, followed by the fact that Wayland is overshadowed by so many legendarily historic towns (Concord, Lexington) and legendarily wealthy towns (Weston, Wellesley) in the vicinity.\n\nWayland does have excellent schools, and I can tell you from recent Town Meetings concerning the new high school that academic excellence is the top priority for many or most families who live here. Taxes are slightly higher because, lacking a commercial tax base, people are willing to pony up for a top-flight public education. I don't personally have kids in the schools yet, but I watch academic activities closely, and Wayland's schools seem to achieve a nice balance of competitive rigor and a healthy quality of life. That's important to me, as we initially considered communities such as Lexington, where I found the houses and lots too small for the money and the schools potentially too high-pressure.\n\nI happen to be a great nature lover, and we moved here in large part because we found a spectacularly beautiful property. There is a big difference in the real-estate \"feel\" of north and south Wayland -- north Wayland is more rural, with winding, woodsy roads, larger lots, and some interesting, varied styles of houses peeking out from between tall trees. It's true that you can't walk to anything commercial from my house, but you can walk to some nature trails along the Sudbury River -- as lovely as any lakeside park you might drive to on a weekend, and not something most people consider when buying a house. Southern Wayland also has woodsy sections but is more densely populated. On the whole, I find Wayland's physical beauty the most appealing and underrated aspect of living here, and I think it attracts people who value peace, quiet, and (again) good schools more than buzz. I have yet to see a MetroWest town this beautiful except neighboring Lincoln, which has even fewer commercial amenities than Wayland.\n\nI also hugely value the fact that Wayland has its own Whole Foods (even though it lost its liquor license to Dedham, bah!), which draws people from all over the region. I'm a big fan of organic produce, healthy fish and meat, etc., and even in Cambridge I was never this close to such an excellent, friendly grocery store with knowledgeable staff. While I realize stores are not necessarily permanent, WF was a big factor in my excitement about moving here and I'm still thrilled to have it right down the road.\n\nThe commuter rail IS an option depending on where you live. I live very close to Lincoln, and when I worked in Boston I used to drive five minutes to Lincoln's commuter-rail stop, no problem. I believe there's another station in Framingham, though I'm not sure where.\n\nHope that helps!"
