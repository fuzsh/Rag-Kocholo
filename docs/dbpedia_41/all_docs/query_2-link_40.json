        "text": "25 Years Ago — May 2, 1990\n\nThere was no informa tion available at the Then & Now historical service in Dorr this week because the May 2 edition of the Penasee Globe was missing.\n\nWe are sorry for the inconvenience.\n\n50 Years Ago — April 28, 1965\n\nA public meeting was set for 7:30 p.m. Friday, Aoril 30, at the Wayland High School cafeteria to explain all the ins and outs of the home rule city question in the May 18 special election. Village President Phillip Reno and Planning Commission Chairman will be on hand to answer questions and field comments.\n\nThe four candidates for Charter Commission featured in the Globe this week were Jerome LaValley, Mrs. Gene Weber, Billy Niemchick and Dale Craner.\n\nEditor and Publisher Irvin P. Helmey once again opined in favor of the Village of Wayland going to a home rule city in the upcoming May special election. He stated, “As far as taxes are concerned, there will be no change as long as citizens are satisfied with the present services offered by the village… The advantages of easier (voter) registration and no extra taxes are reasons enough in the home rule election to pass on Tuesday, May 18.”\n\nJoanne Gilbert was named valedictorian of the Wayland High School Class of 1965 and Rhoda Edwards was announced as saltuatorian.\n\nJames E. Nunn of Otisville, one of 27 recent recruits from the Michigan State Police Academy, has been assigned as the newest trooper for the Wayland post.\n\nThe election for Hopkins Board of Education on June 14 will feature one opening.

The Robe Choir will show off their new green and white robes during the concert.\n\nA ceremony planned for 8 p.m. May 1 will focus on the new lights at the Bradley four corners. The ceremony will be held at the Organic Soil and Health Builders Club building.\n\nShowing at the Wayland Theatre this week was “Beath Party,” starring Franke Avalon, Annette Funicello, Bob Cummings and Dorothy Malone.\n\nLee Pepper was a triple winner in a dual meet victory over Caledonia, taking the high and low hurdles and the long jump. Wes Compson won the 100- and 220-yard dashes and Alan Hayes remained unbeaten on the season thus far in the mile run. The Wildcats, however, lost to Northview 57-52 on the last event of the day, the mile relay.\n\nWayland’s tennis team, on the strength of singles victories by Tom Tarnutzer, freshman Robert Ayers and Wayne VanDuine, hiked its league record to 2-0 with a dual match victory over Hamilton.\n\nDespite five hits in two games by catcher Roger Merren, Wayland’s baseball team lost 7-6 to Caledonia and 11-7 to Kenowa Hills.\n\n75 years Ago — May 1, 1940\n\nNew traffic lanes are being marked out on the village streets in the business section.\n\nFarmers are taking advantage of the weather to get in a belated crop of oats.\n\nListen for the cowbells when you visit Wayland merchants. They ring when you open the front door. Then remember that commencing in about four weeks the first Wednesday evening entertainment will take place.\n\nIf nothing out of the way happens to prevent it, by Friday night Dean Green and this writer expect to be on the banks of the Baldwin Creek, awaiting the opening of the 1940 trout fishing season which opens at midnight.\n\nAt recent meetings of the Wayland Business Men’s Association it was decided to publicize the fact that Wayland was the heart of the dairy industry in this section, so the slogan, “Wayland, The Cow Town of Michigan,” was adopted. The nearly forgotten cowbell is being brought’ back to life and will be used as a symbol of Wayland. Thus our popular Wednesday night entertainments will be known as “Nights of the Cowbell.”\n\n100 Years Ago — April 30, 1915\n\nMorris Ehle now drives an R.C.H. touring car.\n\nEarl Jerome has sold his lunch counter to Beri Stockdale.\n\nC.B.

Ryno, “A number responded quickly with the aid of automobiles, but the crowd arrived only in time to assist in saving the adjoining buildings.”\n\nThe pumping system at Helvetia Milk Condensing Co. was crippled by a malfunction and put at risk the fire prevention program for the village. At the suggestion of John Rankin, a new and larger pumping system will be installed from a deeper well.\n\nElizabeth Clark was elected president of the Ladies Literary Club.\n\nA united meeting for all Wayland area churches was set to welcome George Hudson of Okemos as guest speaker “in the interests of the Anti-Saloon League.”\n\nThe Rev. Reuben Wintz has accepted the call to the Congregational Church at Tipton, Mich. He had been Congregational minister for the churches in Bradley, Wayland and Hopkins.\n\n“A disagreeable person is one who suffers from misery of a bad liver.
