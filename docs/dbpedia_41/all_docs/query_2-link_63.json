        "text": "Wayland Little League provides baseball and softball programs that serve players in grades Pre-K to 9th and caters to all skill levels and abilities.\n\nOur mission is to provide a safe, positive environment in which players can participate and thrive in organized baseball and softball. We provide players with an initial introduction to and an ongoing development in baseball and softball skills through the dedication of our all-volunteer board and coaches. Programs are typically run in the spring, summer, and fall and are a good mix of both developmental and competitive in nature.\n\nSupported by Wayland Park & Recreation Department for the benefit of the boys, girls, and residents of Wayland, Wayland Little League is an all-volunteer organization committed to building an appreciation for the games of baseball and softball through quality coaching and parental involvement.\n\nOur affiliation with Little League International provides numerous direct and indirect benefits to players and their families including enhanced training and skills, development tools for all players, coaches and umpires, alignment with neighboring Little League-affiliated towns, and of course, the opportunity to field a Williamsport national tournament team.\n\nWe welcome your participation as a player, as a coach or as one of our many volunteers, as a financial contributor or teamâ€™s sponsor and as a fan.\n\nPlease note, we take our mission very seriously. We strive to provide any player that wants the opportunity to play the greatest game in the world that chance and regardless of his or her ability. While Wayland Little League does offer competitive travel teams at some levels there is always an additional option available for players who are new to the game."
