        "text": "The Hojack Trail is under the management of the Freinds of Webster Trails, an arm of the Webster Parks and Rec. It is well managed and has been updated over the last several years with renewed energy. The low areas on the eastern half have, for the most part, been repaired and it can be traversed all year. Some soft spots are inevitable after heavy rain or in the spring when it thaws. Best used with mountain bikes or larger tired ebikes, which we use. It is a beautiful trail. If you travel to itâ€™s terminus in the west at Lake Road, one can turn west on Lake Road and peddle a short mile past Bay Road to the new Sand Park, which came online in 2023. So, this trail does, technically, go to the lake, as you can ride out on the eastern most pier for beautiful views of Lake Ontario.\n\nI have ridden this trail from my home near the Genesee River into downtown Rochester and then out to Rte 252 / Jefferson Rd. Often I do a loop back home on the east side of Genesee River. It's even and well paved, clear on both sides. only some bumps and pavement that is a very little bit crumbly down on the straightway south of the Church of Love. but it is wide enough that never is a problem. Definitely gets lots of mosquitoes in areas. This trail follows the old railroad line and on one side also the Genesee Valley Canal.\n\nIn early June, we rode the section of the Erie Canal from Camillus to Syracuse. We also took a side trip on the Onondaga Lake West and East Shore Trails. Round trip, we biked approximatel 30 miles.\n\nWe parked at the June Reed Webster Park. The bathrooms were open. With that said, we have been there before and they have been closed. I would not count on them 100%.\n\nThe trail was in excellent shape. The Erie Canal section was hard a packed with small gravel. We did encounter hills, which we did not expect on a canal trail. They were small and manageable. Most of the hilly sections were paved, making them easy to navigate. The Onondaga Lake trails are paved and in fantastic condition. We only came across two small sections with tree root bumps.\n\nThis section of the Erie Canal Trail goes through the New York State Fairgrounds. It was eerie and strange to be at the Fair when no one else was around. Made for a unique experience.\n\nThe Onondaga Lake Trails were a pleasure with views of the lake, woodlands, birds, and flowers. We saw several bluebirds, which is not something we encounter routinely.\n\nThe Onondaga Lake Trails are part of the Onondaga Lake Park which has multiple bathroom facilities and picnic tables. We ate our lunch with a view of the lake and pickleball courts. There were a people playing, which provided our lunch time entertainment.\n\nThe only potential downside is the trail near Camillus is next to a garbage dumb. It is landscaped nicely with wild flowers in abundance and we did find a turtle on the path. We noticed an odor on our way back when the temperature was hotter. On the positive side, it is a productive use of the land.\n\nWe give this trail a thumbs up and will ride it again."
