        "text": "Quote:\n\nOriginally Posted by RHW1\n\nWayland seems like a great town.\n\nCan anyone comment on the overall feeling of the in the town? (i.e socially, politically etc.) It seems to get lumped in with the other \"W-towns\" however I am not sure if that is the case.\n\nIs it more laid back and low key then a Wellesley or Weston?\n\nI am not originally from MA and am are trying to get a sense of the different areas. Thanks!\n\nI grew up there (WHS Class of '81). It's quiet, pleasant, and expensive. My Dad still lives there, and his property tax bill is $9200/year, for a house that's worth about half a million, on a 1.5-acre (I think) lot.\n\nit's a nice town, if you like suburbs. Also, keep in mind that there are different parts of town -- Cochituate is more of a \"townie\" place, the north end of town is generic residential suburbia. Not much to do -- if you want any kind of entertainment or recreation, you have to get in the car and go somewhere else. There are a few exceptions -- Vokes Theater, the Town House Pool, stuff like that -- but by and large, a bedroom community.\n\nPolitics? Basically, like most upscale suburbs, it's all about the schools -- big taxes to pay for them. The schools were good, but in my estimation, overrated -- I think parents worry far too much about the public schools. What I learned at home, from my parents, was much more important long-term.\n\nWayland is not as old-money and/or snobbish as Weston and Wellesley -- a lot of the north end of town is newer housing (post-WWII).\n\nUrb\n\nThe keeping up with the Joneses attitude may be less apparent in Wayland than in some nearby towns. Still, Wayland is an affluent suburb, so you're probably not going to totally escape the attitudes typically associated with such areas. It's just that maybe you don't get snooty and competitive attitudes on steroids in Wayland.\n\nOne interesting twist on attitudes is that I've heard that Wayland's youth sometimes feel kind of an inferiority complex vis a vis some of the super-upscale towns in the vicinity, especially Weston, since it's right next door to Wayland, and their high schools' teams compete in the same league. Sort of silly when you think about it, because Wayland is a nice upscale town, but I guess those status games can really invovle a lot of fine-tuning regarding which places are most highly regarded.\n\nIt's not 100 percent true that Wayland lacks any sort of a downtown. It's just that Wayland Center, despite the fact that the name might make it sound like the commercial center of town, is not in fact the main business district. The commercial district in Cochituate has pretty much all the collection of stores and eateries usually found in the downtown of a small town--supermarket, drugstore, a haircut place or two in the vicinity, Starbucks, a mom-and-pop pizza/sub shop and several full-service restaurants. The commercial district in Cochituate doesn't really look like a downtown. Most of the buildings stand alone, rather than being right next to each other in a row the way you find in a true downtown, and some stores are located in a small shopping center at the district's main intersection. So it doesn't have the look of a downtown, but functionally the area is like a small-town downtown.\n\nNice town overall. High housing costs, yet relatively affordable when compared to some other towns in the vicinity. Much of Wayland has the sort of low-density, leafy suburban character of Weston, Dover, or Sudbury, but without quite the same exorbitant price tag. Wayland's a good choice if it falls within your housing budget and you like that kind of town.\n\n\"ogre\"\n\nThere actually is some of those things you listed Wayland \"didn't have\". They DO have a pizza place (WAYLAND HOUSE OF PIZZA (my FAVORITE pizza place- and Iv'e traveled to 45 states & 3 countries and Wayland's pizza is still #1), lots of other restaurants, though there is no Starbucks that's because of the historic district. There's a laundry place, 8 banks (soon to be 9), drug store, C.V.S., Whole Foods, and a future: Stop & Shop, ice cream shop, and many more small shops....THEY ARE JUST STILL BEING BUILT! So just you wait. There are some other boutiques, a clothing one right next to an Italian restaurant. We have 2 places to get massages and nails done, etc. (I love them). Three dentistry places (soon to be 4). WE DO HAVE A Dunkin' Donuts! It's located by the Middle School. So kids go there before school, and after school Liberty's pizza (also good). Next to it is a Mexican place! Right on the boarder of Sudbury and Wayland is a DAIRY QUEEN( in Sudbury, just a feet away from Wayland boarder- also by WAYLAND MIDDLE SCHOOL). YUM\n\nAs if the school's could get better- the high school is expanding-so many people come for our great schools that they had to expand and re do the high school. Parks are found throughout Wayland. The Wayland Town pool just re-modeled, and your first time you get to go in as a guest for free! We have two elementary schools (used to be 3), but then they took away one elementary school and now it's used for all Kindergardners. Pretty cool that the little kids get to rule the school!\n\nAnd the thing about the youth is false, we believe we are better And we are willing to defend that.\n\nI LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEE WAYLAND\n\nGO WARRIORS <3"
