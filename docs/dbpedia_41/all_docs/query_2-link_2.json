        "text": "Village in Iowa, United States\n\nWayland is a village in Jefferson Township, Henry County, Iowa, United States. The population was 964 at the time of the 2020 census.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nWayland was originally known as Crooked Creek. Crooked Creek became a voting precinct on October 5, 1840. The first burial is given to John Bullock, in 1838. He came as a surveyor to this region in 1837. The need to establish a post office followed. Rufus M. Pickell, one of the local leaders, was appointed on February 3, 1843, postmaster for the land east of the Skunk River and south of Crooked Creek. Pickell was also a blacksmith by trade. Establishing a church followed, so the little log cabin Methodist Church was built in 1844. From 1851 to 1880, the town was known as Marshall.[4] Christian Roth Sr. erected a brewery on his homestead in 1856, which was completed at a cost of over $4,000. Until its closing by laws passed in 1884, it had done a prosperous business and had a capacity of 10 barrels a day. Confusion over the name Marshall, Henry County and Marshalltown, Iowa, especially with mail getting mixed, required a change in 1879, with the smaller town relinquishing its name and taking up a new one in 1880. In the 1879 Henry County History book the following names can be found in Jefferson Township: Burrows, Clifton, Cook, Davies, Everts, Farmer, Hull, Jessup, Johnson, Manning, Mathews, Moore, Noble, Ressel, Sayles, Shively, Turney, Walker, Wallbank, Wiggins, and Williams.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.01 square miles (2.62 km2), all land.[5]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical populationsYearPop.±%1880171— 1900394+130.4%1910550+39.6%1920637+15.8%1930625−1.9%1940576−7.8%1950600+4.2%1960597−0.5%1970702+17.6%1980720+2.6%1990838+16.4%2000945+12.8%2010966+2.2%2020964−0.2%Source:\"U.S. Census website\".

WACO is a consolidation and acronym of the communities Wayland, Ainsworth, Crawfordsville and Olds. The Ainsworth community is no longer a part of the WACO school district. WACO's mascot is the Warrior (Spartan/Trojan) and their colors are powder blue and white. The elementary school is located in Crawfordsville. Prior to WACO, the Wayland High School stood where the current Bomber Field is located, behind the city's fire department. Their mascot was originally the Dutchman and their colors were orange and navy blue. In the late 1940s, their mascot was the Bombers (B-25) and the school changed their colors to purple and white. They fielded their first football team in 1953."
