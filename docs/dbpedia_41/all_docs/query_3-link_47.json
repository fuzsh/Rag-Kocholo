        "text": "The Concord Christmas Bird Count, which includes Wayland and surrounding towns, will be held this year on Dec. 29. Birders of all levels are invited to participate.\n\nThe first such bird count took place on Christmas Day 1900 at the behest of ornithologist Frank Chapman, who was upset by the indiscriminate slaughter and unregulated hunting of game birds for sport. To protest this state of affairs, Chapman organized 27 friends in 25 locations and asked them to count birds instead of shooting them.\n\nToday, more than 50,000 people from all 50 states, every Canadian province, the Caribbean, Central America, South America and the Pacific Islands (all areas where the breeding birds of North America spend their winters) participate in nearly 2,000 counts held during the 21/2-week period around the holiday. Thirty-four count circles are located entirely or partly within Massachusetts. In each circle, every individual bird and bird species seen during the calendar day is counted. The Concord Count Circle includes 18 towns and covers some 177 square miles.\n\n\"Birds are excellent indicators of the health of our environment,\" said Wayland's Barbara Howell, who participates in the Concord Christmas Bird Count every year. \"Globally, many birds appear to be in decline because of the degradation and outright loss of habitat. Forest fragmentation results in increased populations of predators, while pollution, pesticides, oil spills, the loss of ancient forests, and the destruction of rain forests all take their toll. As a result, the need to compile long-range data to document trends in bird populations is greater than ever.\"\n\nIn this area, many changes have been seen over the years. Back in the early part of the century, Christmas bird counters were lucky to spot 35 species in mid-winter. Today, however, the average is 55 to 65 species, and they are constantly changing.\n\nThis year's event is special for two reasons, says Hank Norwood of Wayland, another regular participant.\n\n\"First, we're trying to build our youth participation. We've been talking to schools and we have a mentor program going, so that younger people who are beginning birders will be put in teams with more experienced adults.\"\n\nIn a special effort to attract a youthful crowd Norwood said, the National Audubon Society is waiving the usual $5 \"in the field\" participation fee for people under the age of 18. (Feeder-bird watching is free for all ages.)\n\n\"Second,\" Norwood said, \"we're focusing a special effort on the new biodiversity sites that have been identified by the SuAsCo Watershed Commission. This is the group that oversees the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord River areas. They have identified a number of biodiversity sites, many of which are in the Concord Count. SuAsCo feels that they're regionally important for habitat and species diversity, and we'd like to see them get in-depth coverage.\n\n\"This is so we can continue to build a database to support the decisions involved in acquiring more land and managing the land we already have.\"\n\nThe SuAsCo study of these sites has used data from previous Christmas counts to identify what they thought were important from a birding standpoint. The data collected this year will be used to decide what kind of protection and/or stewardship will be necessary. As examples of stewardship, Norwood cited the restoration of native grasses and enhancing certain kinds of habitat.\n\nPeople interested in participating in this year's count should call Howell at 508-358-4508.\n\nNorwood and Howell say they'll schedule people in whenever they want.\n\n\"Some like to go out at 2 or 3 in the morning, though most begin at 7 or 8. Others like to participate during the afternoon or just want to stay home and look out their windows,\" Norwood said. \"We welcome everyone.\""
