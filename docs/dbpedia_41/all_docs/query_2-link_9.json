        "text": "Wayland is a suburban town with a bit of a rural New England feel. Many large lots, most people own their own homes, but the cost of housing is extremely high. If you want all the amenities at your fingertips or a walkable community, this is not for you. We are sorely lacking in good coffee shops. The restaurants are decent, but nothing exciting. You can drive to bigger centers with more amenities but plan on it taking you fifteen to twenty minutes at a minimum to get to your destination. To get into central Boston takes about half an hour when the traffic is good. If the traffic is bad it can take 1.5 hours. The schools are excellent, but playgrounds are limited, and there are no splash pads. Most families seem to drive into surrounding towns for things like kids programs. This area is growing in young families, but does not have a particularly youthful feel to it. Almost every household is double income, and so most kids attend daycare, preschool, or school.\n\nI moved to Wayland 20 years (!) ago for the same reason everyone else does - great schools. As I finish raising two kids here, it’s been an amazing town for quality of schools and teachers, for rec programs and sports leagues, and for my neighborhood filled with other kids and friendly parents. The town is liberal and generally very supportive of the schools, which is self-perpetuating. High debate is whether a new town playing field should be turf or not (artificial turf voted down of course). Residents get involved in town committees and groups, and while there can be a north/south divide (Cochituate village is denser than more rural/affluent north Wayland, with associated differences of opinions), the town comes together to support diversity, affordable housing and kids/education. Traffic commuting into Boston can be a bear but if you don’t have to deal with that, it’s an ideal “semi-rural” spot, close to Boston and Rt 9 shopping, but a nice small town community feel.\n\nCalm and pretty suburb town. Schools are okay and many people like them, but they just weren't for me. Aside from the schools, my main complaint would be the lack of transportation to the city and the fact that there's just about nothing to do in Wayland itself.\n\nWayland is a very nice town. As a teen it is a nice place to live, as there are things to do and things near by, but there is also a lot of natural beauty. I think this is something a lot of town lack, theres either a lot to do and its crowded and busy, or there is absolutely nothing to do at all. I know that living in Wayland there are a lot of opportunities open to me, and that's why I enjoy it, and recommend it for families.\n\nWe recently moved to this town and so far everything has been going great!\n\nI have three kids ages from 12, 5 and 2 years old. At first I was expecting a hard \"transitions\" being that we moved from a great and warm community, Naples Florida.\n\nTo families out there that are looking for a town with excellent schools and close-by to Boston, I highly recommended Wayland. We did our research for years- We started looking into Lexington (we got priced out from outrageous homes), Sudbury (little too far for my shopping needs), We looked and looked -really in all these towns you are comparing apple to apple, depends on what you looking for. Wayland fits my agenda- be in town that offers GREAT public schools and homes that you are not on top of each other. I love having my privacy and Wayland has that feel, yet if you want to be involved in the community, there are so many things you can do!\n\nI have lived in Wayland for 2 years now and I have loved it. It has always felt like a safe place to live. Living here has been a great experience and is not far from major highways. I love the quiet living here and don't feel like there is much traffic. I would recommend Wayland,Ma to anyone trying to move to Massachusetts.\n\nNice people, nice education system. Not a lot of crime except the occasional adolescent drug use. Not noticeable unless you're actually enrolled in high school. The high school has been recently renovated and has a new and modern look. Safe neighborhood, lots of people walking their dogs and jogging, if you pass someone they always smile and say hello. It's a fairly rich and prestigious town. Lots of people are lawyers. Not very diverse, mostly white followed by asian. School uses METCO program which might be nice for some people. School athletics is top notch apparently. Supermarket opened up recently in town center, everything you need is within reach. 20 min drive from inner Boston. Very nice town overall."
