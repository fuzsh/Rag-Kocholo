        "text": "Jeffrey Dodge Rogers Photography (Wayland); Atlantic Visuals (Boston)\n\n40 Battery Street, #401, BostonSale Price: $1,595,0002 Forest Hill Road, Wayland\n\n$1,639,000\n\n27\n\n1,032 square feet\n\n2\n\n1.5Asking Price\n\nDays on Market\n\nSize\n\nBedrooms\n\nBathrooms$1,595,000\n\n3\n\n4,291 square feet\n\n5\n\n5.5\n\nWhether they’re closing deals in the city or the ’burbs, there’s no denying that the pandemic has changed the way Realtors do business. Consider this Boston condo, where the agent led the buyers through their final walkthrough virtually. Once they actually unpacked their boxes IRL, the new owners were able to enjoy their light, bright kitchen with custom cabinetry and a private balcony featuring enviable views of the harbor, the Zakim Bridge, and the Old North Church steeple.\n\nTwenty miles west in Wayland, coronavirus complications drove another set of buyers to purchase sight unseen. Given the rich mahogany woodwork and modern design that characterize the open-concept single-family, set on more than an acre of land, it’s easy to understand how a FaceTime tour sealed the deal. And considering the retreat sold in just three days for the full asking price, the question isn’t whether the market is moving, but where buyers are moving—and the speed of this sale makes a strong case for the suburbs."
