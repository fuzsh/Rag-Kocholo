Call us (800) 828-7086)\n\nLocal Area Info: Wayland, Iowa\n\nWayland is a city in Jefferson Township, Henry County, Iowa, United States. The population was 966 at the 2010 census. Wayland was originally known as Crooked Creek. Crooked Creek became a voting precinct October 5, 1840. The first burial is given to John Bullock in 1838. He came as a surveyor to this region in 1837. The need to establish a post office followed. Rufus M. Pickell, one of the local leaders, was appointed on February 3, 1843, postmaster for the land East of the Skunk River and South of Crooked Creek. Pickell was also a blacksmith by trade. Establishing a church followed, so the little log cabin Methodist Church was built in 1844. From 1851 to 1880 the town was known as Marshall. Christian Roth Sr. erected a brewery on his homestead in 1856, which was completed at a cost of over $4,000. Until its closing by laws passed in 1884, it had done a prosperous business and had a capacity of 10 barrels a day. Confusion over the name Marshall, Henry County and Marshalltown, Iowa, especially with mail getting mixed, required in 1879 a change in the smaller town relinquishing its name and taking up a new one in 1880. In the 1879 Henry County History book the following names can be found in Jefferson Township: Burrows, Clifton, Cook, Davies, Everts, Farmer, Hull, Jessup, Johnson, Manning, Mathews, Moore, Noble, Ressel, Sayles, Shively, Turney, Walker, Wallbank, Wiggins, and Williams.\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 966 people, 396 households, and 268 families residing in the city. The population density was 956.4 inhabitants per square mile (369.3/km2). There were 417 housing units at an average density of 412.9 per square mile (159.4/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 95.5% White, 1.1% African American, 0.6% Native American, 0.9% Asian, 0.8% from other races, and 0.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.0% of the population.\n\nThere were 396 households of which 26.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.0% were married couples living together, 8.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 5.3% had a male householder with no wife present, and 32.3% were non-families. 29.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 19.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.33 and the average family size was 2.85."
