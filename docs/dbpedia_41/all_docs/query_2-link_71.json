        "text": "BALTIMORE – U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) today joined local officials, including Baltimore City Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, to celebrate the grand opening of the Wayland Village Senior Apartments. The brand new development consists of 89 affordable rental apartments for low- and moderate-income seniors and adults with disabilities. The apartments are green and sustainable with features that meet LEED standards and Enterprise Green Communities Criteria.\n\n“The Wayland Village Senior Apartment development exemplifies our commitment to the environment and to our senior citizens,” said Senator Cardin. “It took a strong commitment and strong partners to make this a reality, and I particularly want to thank the Bon Secours Foundation, the WBC Community Development Corporation, Enterprise Homes and others who have made it possible for seniors in Baltimore to have access to affordable, sustainable housing. At Wayland Village, seniors have an opportunity to help the environment and preserve the planet for their grandchildren and generations to come.”\n\nA partnership between Bon Secours Health System, Enterprise Homes and the WBC Community Development Corporation, a faith-based non-profit organization of the Wayland Baptist Church, spearheaded construction of the $15.2 million development. JPMorgan, the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development, and Baltimore City financed construction, along with a $2 million Recovery Act grant in 2010.\n\nSenator Cardin attended Wayland Village’s groundbreaking in May 2010. The Senator is a strong supporter of faith-based community projects, and has also championed the need for resources and services so that seniors can “enjoy a high quality of life” in their later years.\n\n–##–"
