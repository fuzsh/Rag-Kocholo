Upper Wallace Creek Dolomitic toward Morgan Corners formation overlying W.C. 1/3 mile E of Phillipsburg are infaulted blocks (slices) of Wallace Creek in Morgan Corners formation. Very fossiliferous containing many \"Syntrophinella\". This slice (or slices) are from the upper part of the Wallace Creek probably. There is no proof of this as these rocks have not been seen in the main mass of the Wallace Creek. The Chief block in the W.C. blocks is a [[underlined]] Syntrophinella [[/underlined]] like shell. The shell & sciatix suggest Canadian. There are also [[underlined]] Polytoechia-[[/underlined]] like shells.

From loose blocks excellent [[underlined]] Pentameroides [[/underlined]] were obtained. June 6 1.2 miles east of Dawsonville, new road cuts in very hard heavy bedded massive calcaneous sandstone. Dipping steeply to NE. Conchidium very abundant, Atrypa, Stromatopora, corals. May be Crickmay's St. Leon formation June 7. Spent most of day collecting from the La Vieille at Quinn's Point, 3 miles East of Jacquet River. Fossils are not abundant and are hard to get. It rained in spurts most of the day and was very cold and windy.\n\n[[stamped]] 0003 [[/stamped]] [[encircled]] 4 [[/encircled]] June 8. Snow and rain all morning. In afternoon went to Black Rock and collected for about 2 hours. Was unable to find bed with complete small [[underlined]] Stucklandias [[/underlined]] although I saw many poor separate valves. I believe that the beds at Black Point are not [[underlined]] La Vieille [[/underlined]] but I dont know where they go in the section. Perhaps they are uppermost Clemville. Lithologically the beds are not unlike those of the La Vieille being knobbly, there is an evident lack of corals. + Stromatopores as compared with the Quinn Point exposures. June 9. Rain most of day - went to Dalhousie with Dr. Smith. Collected about 5 hours. [[underlined]] Stewarti [[/underlined]] bed is mostly of soft ash. Shells abundant collected in beds at brook which were quite bare. Beds 8 & 9 I think are inseparable. June 10. Rain all day - prospects of clearing not good.

Collected fossils all day - Good day. June 12 Sunday - returned to Dalhousie chiefly to take notes and collect from beds exposed at low tide only. Bed 7 is in contact with the Barberie andesites which are amygdaloidal in the upper part. Bed 7 is hard arenaceous limestone containing many corals. [[^left margin]] Dip on bed 7 is 52[[degree symbol]] NNE [[/left margin]] The lower contact is very irregular and the lowest bed is a hard ls. 1 - 2' thick. Bed 7 is 5 to 7' thick. To my mind the fauna of bed 7 is essentially the same as that of 8 - 10, except there are more corals in 7. Bed 8 - sandy sh, ashy, bluish gray weathering brownish on surfaces, said to be 20'. I see no definite separation from bed 9. faunally or lithologically. Has clams like bed 9. Bed 9 is the one from which most of the loose & good fossils come.

From contact of bed 7 and Barberie Dacite it is 97 paces on or about 243'. According to the book (Howard) there are 180' between the hard ls & the contact. I fail to see the usefulness of beds listed by Howard as it is nearly impossible to identify them. I saw no R. stewarti in the bed 11.but they were abundant in beds 12 sub 2 [[?]]-15.

Industry Topography General Plan general appearance\n\n[[preprinted]] 0007 [[/preprinted]] June 19 Collected Clemville at Clemville. Most soft crumbly arenaceous sh. and harder ss. bands. Fossils common but hard to get. Port Daniel, small village whose main industry is fishing. Some farming done by inhabitants, several sawmills in town. General appearance is poor, most of people are poor. One lobster canning factory. One large new hotel. One hotel defunct (Le Grand's) and Hotel Port Daniel closed up. The village consists essentially of 3 parts, Port Daniel West, Port D. center and Port Daniel East or the main portion of the village. Port Daniel River forms a Barrachois at P.D. East, R.R. and village located on the bar, covered bridge over tickle. Same for Little Port Daniel River at Port D. center P.D. is surrounded by low ridge-like hills. The West Pt. limestone is one of the main ridge or hill formers. This is shown at Pt. L'Enfers where there is a ls. quarry, the ridge running N from the Point. From West Point to Indian Point the ridge and cliffs are held up mainly by West Pt. ls. The Gascones commonly form the low ground being arenaceous shores and arenaceous ls. This rims the bay at Port Daniel West and also forms the low ground at Chouinard Brook & Anse aux Gascons.\n\n[[printed]] 0008 [[/preprinted]] At Anse à la Barbe low cliffs rim the shore which are formed of the Upper Gascons but inland from these is a ridge, the backbone of which is West Point Limestone. The La Vieille makes high ground from Port Daniel (St George Church) to the north, and in the vicinity of Clemville. Population of Port Daniel 1776, founded 1855. Fishing, ls. quarrying, agriculture, a little lumber. New Richmond - Pop. 2,534, founder 1831. Mostly farming & lumbering.

Trilobites are still plentiful in the band that carries them but are difficult to get at. June 22 - Rain + fog - Went behind Ste. Anne to the amphitheatre, locs. 5, 5a and collected. Collecting good in the thin Is. bands. Rock mostly a soft rotten shole containing innumerable items bedded Is. In places alternation of Is. + sh. frequent, others no lime and in still others argillaceous Is abounds, but nowhere is it just puce Is. Collected at F, on Priests road. [[Blucks?]] are difficult to find along the road. June 23 - Spent 2 hours of morning at south flank of Mt. Joli for more trilobites. They are now very difficult to secure. Spent afternoon at F6 + F7.

On SE side of road new cuts expose bryozoan beds of Lobelville with [[underlined]] Gypidula [[/underlined]] and fine lined [[underlined]] Atrypa [[/underlined]]. Possibly these beds are lower part of coral bed. Above these in woods above the bridge for one tenth mile small corals can be found in the soil but the whole slope is thickly covered with leaves and brush. At crossing of road and Marrs Branch bluish gray lines [[ & one?]] is exposed. About 5' above water a thin layer with Combridium was found. Above this [[left margin]] 10. [[/left margin]]\n\n[[circled]] 11 [[/circled]] [[stamped]] 0043 [[/stamped]] layer the rocks are shaly and contain corals bath cup & tabulate which suggest Lobelville. My guess is that the Conchidium belongs to the Lobelville. [[in left margin]] 0.95 [[/in left margin]] Visited spring in bluff about 0.6 miles NNW of town. Decatur is in bluff, about 25' exposed. Downstream occurs coral bed with Conchidrium, locality mentioned above. Just north of west bridgehead at junction of Tenn, 13 and 50 shales rotted down to clay contain corals and bryozoa, undoubtedly belonging to the Bryozoan zone of the Lobelville. The Conchidrium collected at Lobelville belong high in the coral zone. At 1 p.m. it started to rain in ernest and I went home. Sept. 25 - In morning packed three kegs and then took them to Hohnenwold where I shipped them to the musuem. In afternoon went back to Beardstown along river level and about 1/4 mile N of bridge found [[/underline]]Rhipidium knappi [[/end underline]] ?? in a thin zone. Below it occurred [[/underline]] U. stricklandi, Gypidula, W. Saffordi [[/end underline]]and a few other brachiopods which suggest the Bob. I saw no beds that suggested Beech River. Left Beardstown and went to mouth of Jack Branch. No corals occur there but are abundant about 0.2 mile upstream. Visited small quarry (about 30') 0.7 mile east of junction of Tenn 13 and 20 on N side of latter. Quarry is mainly heavy bedded ls., light blue gray in color. Near top is a\n\n[[encircled]] 12 [[/encircled]] [[stamped]] 0044 [[/stamped]] [[in left margin]] 3.68 shaly zone about 3' thick containing brachiopods suggesting the Bob. As the Bob red zone is exposed on a small branch above the mull. I imagine this quarry is in Decatur limestone. I am wondering if, Lobelville, Decatur and Bob, are one and same thing having lateral shaly facies and coral facies [[left margin]] 133 [[/left margin]] Sept. 26- Bluff at Mousetail [[left margin]] 0.95 [[/left margin]] [[left margin]] [[image - geologic sketch of 5 layers.

Limestone beds up to a foot thick from occasional ledges. At 55' comes heavy-bedded gray ls. C. - About 25' of massive limestone forming a bench. This is probably Basslers Eucalyptaerinus zone. D- purplish shaly weathering limestone alternating with greenish shaly limestone and with harder layers that form ledges. 14'-15'. Most of corals seen weathered and lying on slopes were derived from this layer. Found Rhipidium here also E- Hard massive limestone to top of hill and forming a flat top. Limestone is cherty and contains many crinoid stems. Decatur ls? [[left margin]] 12.

Top of hill goes about 20' above top of Decatur making hill about 175' above present river level. The section given here was taken mainly at the point jutting into the river on the north side of a small creek that comes into the river. South of this creek the section is somewhat different. The so-called [[underline]] Uncinulus [[/underline]] bed is either more weathered or not so thick as to the north. My mention of U. stricklandi in Beech R. may bear this out. Found Conchidium in red-green shaly zone same as at [[sketch of layers in left margin]] ------------| Linden ? | G ------------| 60 +/- | F ------------| 15' +/- | E ------------| 8' | D ------------| 16' | C ------------| 5 - 15' | B Uncinulus ? | ------------| 30 - 42' | A | 13.\n\n[[encircled]] 14 [[encircled]] [[stamped]] 0046 [[/stamped]] mousetail. This section seems to me to be about the same as the Moustail one, a little thicker because of the complete section of the Decatur and more of the shaly zone with the red beds. Saw corals in lower Decatur which may indicate presence of the coral zone. Sept. 27 - by side of road opposite house, 1 1/4 miles (airline) SSE of Pine View, up Wilsdorf Branch, about 0.7 mile S of Toms Creek, Perry County, are 3 - 4 feet of shale yielding many corals like those exposed on Jack Branch. 1/4 mile NE of bridge over Coon Creek on Tenn. 100 is good exposure of brachiopod bed sandwiched between two layers of heavy - bedded ls. The shale bed with brachs is about 2' thick. This same brachiopod bed seen in Qy on Hy 20. The brachiopod bed in the Qy on Tenn. Hy. 20 is about 20' below the Hardin SS and the SS lies in place about 8' above the top of the Qy. There must be either much erosion at the top of the Silurian or unsuspected facies changes. Intersection of Coon Creek and Hy. 100 is probably Foerste's locality for Conchidium lindenensis. I hand - leveled down from Hardin ss. about 70 feet but rock is covered at level of Conchidium. Possibly if there were a ford at the Creek in Foerste's more rock was showing then. Sept. 28 - Peelers Pond a great spring issuing from the high bluff. Rock for about 3' at Spring is red but above that is mostly greenish or bluish. According to a man met on [[left margin]] 14.

Now the highway runs about 18 feet above the level of the pond. The bluff was blasted to get the fill for road. About 10' above the road is a 3' shaly bed containing [[underlined]] Strombodes [[/underlined]]. 1/4 mile south of the pond (where spring issues) on east side of the road scraping of bank has revealed a shaly coral & bryozoan bed which is between the Strombodes bed and the red bed at the base of the [[left margin]] 3.30 [[/left margin]] sequences. The spring is located about 600 paces south of Peelers Hollow. South side of crossing of Cane Creek by Tenn. Hy. 50 and for 0.1 mile upstream are 15' of coral beds at base of section. Over these are some 38' of heavy-bedded limestone and over this is the Linden with [[underlined]] Camarocrinus [[/underlined]]. Sept. 29 - Visited Pegram on Mill [[left margin]] 12.75 [[/left margin]] Creek. Spent most of day there. Good section of Silurian but poor in fossils along the road (Tenn.13) beside Buffalo River about 1 mile NW of Flatwoods. The whole section appeared to be most Beech River. In late afternoon stopped to see Natural Bridge on way to Waynsboro. [[left margin]] 0.40 [[/left margin]] Sept. 30 - Spent day at Clifton and vicinity. In morning went ENE of town to point where road bend ESE. Along the river bank at this point the Fernvale formation is well exposed and can be followed NE along the river to a conspicuous bluff a few tenth of a mile from the bend in the road. At the bluff the rock has been quarried or at any rate is fresh. The shaly part of the Fernvale is bright greenish [[left margin]] 15 [[/left margin]]\n\n[[encircled]] 16 [[/encircled]] [[stamped]] 0048 [[/stamped]] blue. Fossils occurred about one foot below the top. The thin Brassfield is exposed well along the shore here. This is followed by the red Osgood shaly limestone and the top of the bluff by the pinkish Laurel ls. After seeing this section walked west from old Dement Mill along the bank of the river. The section is covered where Mud Branch enters the river but a short distance west the top of the Laurel appears and scattered blocks of Waldron with [[underline]] Plectambonites tennesseensis, Stephanocrinus [[/underline]] and other fossils. Then follows the Laurel and the Dixon and finally the Beech River forming most of the bluff west of Clifton. This is the west limb of an anticline the center or axis of which is near the point where the power line crosses the river. Going east of the power line the Hermitage forms the bank for a long distance, nearly to the hotel. This is overlain by Arnhein and the Fernvale which is exposed below the hotel and at the Ferry landing. Farther east the Silurian sequence is repeated on the east limb of the anticline Made a good collection of inarticulate brachiopods from the Hermitage. Oct. 1 - Martins Mills in morning. Hill just south of the cluster of houses exposes an excellent section with Beech River at base and Bob with [[left margin]] 1.83 [[/left margin]] Gant ls. on top. Gant limestone comes to road level perhaps a half mile S of the mills. Hillside N-NE of mills showed Beech River at base and Hardin about middle of hill. Forest's section is undoubtedly up the small stream, although he speaks of being 57' above the road. [[left margin]] 16 [[/left margin]]\n\n[[encircled]] 17 [[/encircled]] [[stamped]] 0049 [[/stamped]] Good section of Beech River with fossils in hill a mile north of the mills. collected here. Several small crinoids are common with an occasional Troostoesius[[guess]] Just SW of schoolhouse one mile west of Houston the rocks have been blasted out for the road. Just NE of the school is about 10 feet of massive limestone abounding in brachiopods, which is overlain by the Hardin. The fill of blasted material unfortunately has either been picked or is not very fossiliferous. Oct. 2 - Went up to Short Creek north of Lego school. Thought it hopeless to try and find Foerste's locality for Conchidium. Went up old road north of Short Creek and found a glade showing about lower 5' of Beech River and its contact with the Dixon. The whitish clay at base of Beech River was well exposed but had few fossils. Above Beech River exposures are poor but upper 35' of Silurian is exposed below the Hardin. It is massive heavy, bedded xline ls. Visited Misers locality 121 opposite Lego. This was exactly like the one above. Fossils can be cracked out of the xline ls. Went 1/2 mile N of Whiteoak School corners to Miser Conchidium ledge. Opposite first house on West side of road just 1/2 mile north of the corners at the school an old road goes east into the woods. This road goes over rotten xline ls and shaley beds abounding in corals and bryozoa. About 100 yards from auto road old road branches, one branch going to the NE (left) up the hill. This branch of the road crosses the Conchidium ledge which may be followed to the NW around the hill for some distance. I make [[margin]] 17 [[/margin]]\n\n[[encircled]] 18 [[/encircled]] [[stamped]] 0050 [[/stamped]] the ledge about 8 - 10 feet thick on the front of the hill facing west and it is about 22 - 25' below the Hardin ss. Above the Conchidium corals are also fairly common and an occasional coral may be found with Conchidium. I think the Conchidium belongs with the corals. The few brachiopods present are like Lobelville or Bob types. Found on U. tennesseensis. I have a suspicion that Bob = Lobelville.. Oct. 3 - Beside the road on the north side of the entrance to the Sewell Spring and about road level a layer of earthy, yellow-weathering ls. contains large Conchidium. Went up hill to north of Sewell (the white) house. At base of hill is shaly material with corals, but nearly entire remainder of section is crystalline ls. right up to the Hardin ss. After lunch Mr. Sewell took me to a glade along an old road about 1/2 mile SSW of the Sewell house. Corals are exactly like those under Conchidium ledge. [[left margin]] 1.66 [[/left margin]] Conchidium was present here but rare. At this place shale of Beechwood type is interbedded with Xline ls. Presence of Troostocrinus & Oct. 4 - In morning collected from glade slope on US. 64, 6.8 miles east of Savannah. Got good Bob brachiopods and a whole Calymene. At noon collected at a glade 3.85 miles east of Savannah. I suspect glade is Rockhouse shale. The shale 10'+ occurred over a few feet of hard limestone showing in a ditch east of glade. On Indian Creek went along bluff facing Olive Hill. Saw [[left margin]] 18.

Here the WPA is building an armory and a great deal of chert from the upper part has been thrown out. We made a large collection. Oct. 8 - First stop was at bridge over Stones River about one mile southwest of Lascassas on Tenn. 96. Here Murphreesboro lies in stream bed. Pierce comes over it on east side bridge and the Ridley overlies the Pierce. We collected Murphreesboro and Pierce. [[left margin]] 1.45 [[/left margin]] Next visit was to old Pierce Mill, 1/2 mile S of Walter Hill on Tenn. 10. Here is a small exposure near power plant of thin ls. with bryozoans. Much of the material is without fossils and is quite vaughanitic in character. Visited Ridley on N side of road crossing Stones River a mile due east (airline) of Jefferson. Here near top of exposed sequences we found [[underlined]] protorhyncha. [[/underlined]] Visited Nice's Mill where Pierce is well exposed. Here [[underlined]] protorhyncha [[/underlined]] occurs in the bryozoan beds near top. Over the Pierce we found Ridley Rhynchotrema in soil. Oct. 9. - Spent morning at Marshalls Knobs on Ridley.

TVA Topsy [[square symbol]] Point out in paper if any of Pegram is really Onondaga there must have been big interval between Lower Onondaga (Camden) and Upper Onondaga [[underlined]] Sp. acuminatus [[/underlined]] zone to have produced the Camden and Clear Creek Cherts, which generally are chert wherever known. The Pegram on Buffalo River in bluff on west side of mouth of Mill Creek, north of Topsy is about 6' thick of hard light to dark gray crystalline limestone, irregularly bedded in layers from one to two inches up to nearly a foot. Contains many styliolites. Basal layer in bottom few inches contains concretions and a green mineral probably glauconite. Fossils are scarce throughout. Saw nothing while collecting to indicate anything of Onondaga age. In basal bed occurs tavosites turbinatus suggestive of Beechwood with a large wrinkled Schuchertella. In middle of formation saw possible Vitulina (or dorsals of Cyrtina). Near top Cypricardinia is common. All fossils seen suggest a Hamilton age for whole layer rather than any Onondaga. Sp. gregarius is only real Onondaga fossil in Pegram reported by Peoples. It could be a Delaware form. In paper show Nucleocrinus vernenili also of Hamilton type. [[underlined]] Pegram may all be Hamilton. [[/underlined]] After examining my specimens\n\n[[stamped]] 0056 [[/stamped]] Collected today I believe I do have Vitulina and they came from about the middle of the formation.
