This will be made possible with the help of Haim Saban, who truly understands the work and resources that go into fully developing artists and creating great music. I thank him for his support and partnership. The new Saban Music Group will have various pillars amongst them: artists signed as partners to 360 models, an acquisitions arm and its own publishing entity.”\n\nUnder the agreement, the record label, management and publishing assets of Lopez’s Talento Uno Music form part of SMG.\n\nLopez started Talento Uno Music in 2017 after serving as GM/EVP of Universal Music Latin entertainment. During 21 years at Universal, Lopez founded Machete Music and ran a host of labels including Fonovisa/Disa.\n\nSMG revealed that its roster includes Israeli duo Static And Ben El; management of Colombian act Reykon and French singer Marie Monti.\n\nHaim Saban is chairman and chief executive officer of Saban Capital Group LLC (SCG).
