        "text": "LOS ANGELES – Shareholders of Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Communications Inc. voted Wednesday in favor of selling the company for $12.3 billion to a private investor group that includes media mogul Haim Saban.\n\nThe deal priced at $36.25 a share in cash was approved by more than 80 percent of the shares that voted, which in turn represented more than 60 percent of company’s outstanding shares, Univision said.\n\nIn addition to what it is offering for the shares, the investment group would assume $1.4 billion in Univision debt.\n\nThe transaction must still pass regulatory approval, but is expected to close next spring.\n\nThe consortium of investors includes Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners, Texas Pacific Group, Thomas H. Lee Partners and Saban’s Saban Capital Group.\n\nUnivision dominates the U.S. Hispanic media market through its three television networks – Univision, TeleFutura and Galavision – more than two-dozen television stations, a recorded music division, Internet portal and Spanish-language radio stations.\n\nShareholder approval of the sale was widely expected, despite the objections of some shareholders who filed separate lawsuits against the company and its board of directors in June, seeking to block the sale on grounds the board failed to obtain a fair price for the company.\n\nThe lawsuits were voluntarily dismissed earlier this month.\n\nUnivision’s board, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer A. Jerrold Perenchio, began exploring a sale of the company in February. In June, the board accepted the investor group’s offer, leaving a rival investor group led by Mexican broadcaster Grupo Televisa SA rankled over having its bid rejected.\n\nTelevisa claimed Univision refused to engage in any talks after the Televisa group made its initial bid, despite repeated offers to do so.\n\nSpeculation that the rebuffed Mexican media giant still planned to put forth a higher offer for Univision resurfaced in recent weeks, leading the company to issue a statement last week saying it had no intention to do so.\n\nUnivision shares fell 4 cents to close at $34.40 on the New York Stock Exchange."
