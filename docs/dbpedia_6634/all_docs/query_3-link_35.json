        "text": "Music and media mogul Haim Saban is formally entering the 2020 election fray, throwing his support behind Democratic nominee Joe Biden, urging the party to unite behind him, and hosting a virtual fundraiser for the candidate next week.\n\nA person with knowledge of the fundraiser says that tickets for the event will start at $500,000 per person, and that House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) will participate. It will be Saban’s first fundraiser for Biden this election cycle.\n\n“I am pleased to see so many Democrats coming together in support of Vice President Joe Biden, and I am proud to endorse him for President,” Saban told The Hollywood Reporter in a statement. “Joe is a proven leader who has the experience, vision and heart to unify our country in this hyper-partisan time.”\n\nSaban and his wife Cheryl Saban have long been among the most reliable Democratic bundlers and donors, but mostly stayed out of the Democratic primary process over the past year. Saban made his first personal donation to the Biden campaign in May of this year, according to OpenSecrets.org.\n\n“We’re not going to be involved until the playing field is settled down. It’s too important not to be,” Cheryl Saban told THR‘s Tatiana Siegel last year. “We are just holding off for now, because there’s going to come a time when somebody is going to need a lot of help.”\n\nThe Sabans have also been vocal and high-profile supporters of the Israel (Saban, who grew up in in the country, remains an Israeli citizen), and the U.S.-Israel relationship. In his statement, Saban said that Biden would be the right candidate to keep the bonds between the countries secure.\n\n“Joe’s judgement and track record show that he will broadly restore America’s position as a moral and global leader, and ensure that the strong, bipartisan alliance between the U.S. and Israel remains unshakeable,” Saban said. “This alliance is vital to our American interests, something Joe articulated best when he said: ‘if there were not an Israel, we would have to invent one to make sure our interests were preserved.’ I am confident that Joe is the right leader to make real progress for Americans and our international partners, and urge our party to unite in his support.”"
