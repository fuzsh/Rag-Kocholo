        "text": "This Malibu home is on 70 feet of coastline along Carbon Beach, nicknamed Billionaires’ Beach for such illustrious residents as Eli Broad, David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Terry Semel, Peter Morton, Haim Saban and Richard and Nancy Daly Riordan.\n\nBill Chadwick, an investment banker, and his wife, Cheryl, spent close to two years and several million dollars rebuilding the residence. The Chadwicks, who had lived in another house on the beach in Malibu for more than 15 years, bought this home to redo for themselves.\n\nIn the meantime, their three young daughters became more interested in horses than in the ocean. Now the family is planning to buy a horse property, and the finished beach home is on the market.\n\nAbout this house: The residence has a history of famous owners and tenants, including actor Richard Chamberlain, who owned the house in the mid-’80s before selling it to William Banowsky, a former president of Pepperdine University. Tenants who lived in the home include film producer Arnon Milchan and the Osbournes, who were filmed there for several scenes of their MTV show.\n\nAsking price: $15,995,000\n\nSize: The house has five bedrooms and seven bathrooms in almost 6,000 square feet. The living and dining rooms have a total of more than 50 feet facing the ocean. The lot size is 11,500 square feet.\n\nFeatures: There are views from Santa Monica to Point Dume. The Cape Cod-style house also has an aquarium, large decks, stone counters, redwood siding, a stone-entry courtyard with lawn and three ocean-view showers, including one in the ocean-side guest suite, which has a 28-foot-long deck.\n\nThe master bedroom suite has a walk-in closet, wet bar, fireplace, private deck and study. The Chadwicks never lived there but had the house professionally decorated. Furnishings are included for $500,000 more.\n\nWhere: Carbon Beach, Malibu\n\nListing agent: Jack Pritchett of Pritchett-Rapf & Associates, Malibu, (310) 456-5621.\n\n*"
