        "text": "What does a man who made millions off of the \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" do with his money? He spends it to change how members of your California Assembly and Senate are elected. And then he spends a fortune to change it back to the way it originally was.\n\nHaim Saban made a fortune off the afternoon's children show and then two years ago he spent $200,000 to pass Proposition 11, a ballot measure that took the power of drawing district boundaries for state Assembly, Senate, and Board of Equalization members from elected officials to a newly created 14 person commission.\n\nThe bill passed in November 2008, partly with the help of Saban's donations, and along with it California's Constitution and government code were amended to accommodate the voter approved change.\n\nBut now Saban is spending even more money to repeal the measure he helped pass. The Hollywood producer loaned $2 million to the Yes on Fair committee campaign, which is seeking to repeal Proposition 11, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nDiversity, and maybe some politics, drove Saban's change of heart. A spokeswoman for the producer said while he once believed Proposition 11 was a good idea, the stateâ€™s diverse population has not been adequately represented in the process of selecting members of an independent commission.\"\n\nIt doesn't hurt that Saban is also a long time financial friend to California democrats -- including gubernatorial hopeful Jerry Brown -- and party leaders, such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), have come out strongly in favor of repealing the proposition."
