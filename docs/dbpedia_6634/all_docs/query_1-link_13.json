        "text": "American writer\n\nCheryl Saban ( ; born April 30, 1951) is an American psychologist, author, television writer, and philanthropist. She is a former Senior Advisor to the United States Mission to the United Nations. She is the author of several children's books, a novel, self-help books, numerous gift books, and many teleplays.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nCheryl Saban was born as Cheryl Lyn Flor[1] on April 30, 1951, in San Diego, California.[2] Her father worked for the local telephone company.[3] Saban worked as a telephone solicitor, waitressed at a barbecue-pit restaurant, and worked summers as a lifeguard at a Navy training center.[3]\n\nSaban attended San Diego State University.[3] In 2005 she earned a doctorate in psychology from California Coast University.[4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nSaban started her career as a model in San Francisco, California in 1973 and Los Angeles in 1975.[3] She recorded her first album in 1978 under the name Flower.[3] In April 1979, Playboy included her in a nude pictorial titled “Disco Queens\".[3]\n\nSaban accepted a job as an assistant for Israeli-American Haim Saban, a millionaire who later became her husband, in 1986.[3] She wrote for television multiple times, including 19 episodes of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, produced by Saban. She is the author of four children's books, a thriller, and several self-help books.[citation needed]\n\nSaban was nominated as Senior Advisor to the United States Mission to the United Nations by President Barack Obama in September 2012.[5]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\n[edit]\n\nSaban is the president of Saban Family Foundation.[2] She and her husband both donate through the foundation, which typically focuses on children, education and women's health. Through a $10 million donation, Saban established the Cheryl Saban Self-Worth Foundation for Women & Girls in 2009.[2] The foundation will provide micro-financing programs to women in the U.S. and in Israel.[3]\n\nSaban is on the board of directors of the Clinton Foundation.[6] She received an honorary doctorate from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel in 2014.[7] As of May 2018, they are supporting the building of a museum in Los Angeles.[8]\n\nLos Angeles Free Clinic\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1968, Los Angeles Free Clinic opened at 115 North Fairfax Avenue, Los Angeles.[9] The Los Angeles Free Clinic is the longest continually running free clinic in the nation.[10]\n\nIn her years of financial difficulty, Cheryl Saban was a patient of the Los Angeles Free Clinic. Later, with her husband, they donated $10 million, and in 2008, it was renamed the Saban Free Clinic.[11][12] now Saban Community Clinic of Beverly Hills,[13] Rampart Village, Hollywood, Melrose, and Blessed Sacrament.[14]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nSaban has been married three times. She married her first husband, Ray Lenhart, at the age of 20.[4] They had two daughters, Tifanie Lenhart Chaney and actress Heidi Lenhart Stills, and divorced soon after.[4] She later married and divorced Bobby Ocean. He was a music producer, and struggled to provide for her children.[3]\n\nSaban married her third husband, Egyptian-born Israeli-American billionaire Haim Saban in 1987.[15] They had two children through a surrogate (Saban had previously had a hysterectomy): son Ness (Hebrew for Miracle) and daughter Tanya. Ness was the eighth surrogate-born baby in the world and Tanya was the fortieth.[16] Although Cheryl is a Lutheran, she agreed to raise the children Jewish. The family always puts up a Christmas tree and celebrates Shabbat weekly. Saban told the rabbi who married them: \"Think of me as a Christian who believes in Judaism.”[3] They reside in Beverly Hills, California.[2]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nSaban, Cheryl (1993).
