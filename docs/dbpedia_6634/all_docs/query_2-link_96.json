        "text": "While the Power Rangers franchise is still going strong after 30 years, I thought I’d look back at the early seasons of “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,” which premiered on American TV on Saturday, August 28, 1993, 30 years ago today. In New York, it settled into a daily weekday afternoon schedule on local station WNEW-TV/Channel 5 as part of the Fox Kids programming block. I’d heard about it and seen promos for it and wondered if it had roots in a Japanese show. I don’t think I’d seen it yet when I visited a local monthly comics show at a hotel in Manhattan that September and asked my friendly dealer of Japanese tapes, mostly anime, if this new superhero show had a Japanese origin. He replied “Yes, and here it is,” as he handed me a VHS tape of “Zyuranger,” Volume 1, containing the first four episodes. It was in Japanese and untranslated and I eagerly bought it.\n\nAt home I watched the four episodes of “Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger”—full title–(1992), about a team of youthful warriors, four male, one female, from ancient Japan revived from suspended animation by an intergalactic guardian (disguised as a janitor in modern-day Tokyo) who has been alerted to the sudden re-emergence of the villainous Witch Bandora and her monster sidekicks, all inadvertently freed by a visiting team of ill-fated Space Shuttle astronauts from their 10,000-year prison chamber on another planet whose orbit has brought them close to Earth. “Zyuranger” was the 18th season in the Sentai/Super Sentai franchise, which had first premiered in Japan in 1975 with “Himitsu Sentai Goranger,” the product of the fertile imagination of manga and television writer Shotaro Ishinomori (Kamen Rider, Cyborg 009). Toei Studios initiated the franchise and continues to produce new Super Sentai seasons every year.\n\nI made a point of watching “Mighty Morphin” at the first opportunity and was surprised at the wholesale inclusion of fight and action scenes from the Japanese original even though their settings didn’t remotely match the rest of the show. The five teens in the American version were high school kids in suburban Angel Grove in Southern California or “five teenagers with attitudes” as their mentor Zordon, a huge floating head in a large glass tube in a nearby secret command center, has requested via Alpha 5, his robot assistant. The five are initially more concerned with after-school activities (dance, gymnastics, martial arts, science experiments) than in saving the world. One of the original characters, the Yellow Ranger, was male, while in the American version, that character is female. Three of the Power Rangers are male and two female, three are white, one black, one Asian. There was a bold charm about it and it offered a rather clever way to both exploit the Japanese pop cultural phenomenon of “Super Sentai” and introduce it to the American audience.\n\nIn the early episodes, whenever the five teens “morphed” into their Power Rangers costumes, the action immediately shifted to Japan, usually a remote quarry covered in volcanic ash or rock, but sometimes to Tokyo itself, referred to in a line of dialogue as “downtown Angel Grove,” or, more specifically, “the business district” or “warehouse district.” Even the film stock looked very different, usually a little darker and grainier than the Angel Grove footage. Location scenes in Tokyo were often shot on overcast days, while action scenes involving the five American teens out of costume in California were shot on sunny days.\n\nIn one episode, #22: “The Trouble with Shellshock,” the Power Rangers are playing basketball on an outdoor court in “Angel Grove Park” when the monsters show up and lure them out to a fight in the streets, where we now see Tokyo Tower looming behind them. (I believe I actually visited the park seen in these shots.)\n\nInvariably, the giant “Zord” battles in the finale of each episode come entirely from the Japanese original and show the Rangers piloting their personal giant robotic combat vehicles, combining them very efficiently when necessary to form a “Megazord,” in battle against the newly giant-sized monster they’ve been fighting in the episode, usually amidst the tall buildings of a miniature Tokyo built on a soundstage at the Toei Studio.\n\nBack in September 1993 , I showed the Zyuranger tape to my daughter and two of her neighbor friends who lived up the hall from us. I later showed it to her cousins. All of them had seen the American version by this point. They were all amazed. The neighbor boy, a fourth grader, declared, “My friends aren’t gonna believe me when I tell them I saw this.” Next time I saw him I asked about it and he was right, they didn’t, except one girl who noticed that the Yellow Ranger didn’t have a skirt on her costume like the Pink Ranger did, backing up my neighbor’s assertion that the Yellow Ranger was male in the original. Quite an observant little fan.\n\nIn re-watching the first season episodes, I am most impressed by the easy chemistry among the five actors comprising the initial lineup and a sixth actor who joined them a few weeks into the season. Watching them interact and develop their camaraderie is as much fun as watching the action scenes. They are: Austin St. John as Jason, the Red Ranger; Amy Jo Johnson as Kimberly, the Pink Ranger; Walter Jones as Zack, the Black Ranger, Thuy Trang as Trini, the Yellow Ranger; David Yost as Billy, the Blue Ranger; and Jason David Frank as Tommy, the Green Ranger and, later, the White Ranger (in footage from the 1993 Super Sentai season, “Gosei Sentai Dairanger”).\n\nI later learned that the actors had to bond because working conditions were so bad. They were working every day of the week at very long hours, prompting three of them, Austin St. John, Thuy Trang, and Walter Jones, below, to rebel after doing 80 episodes in a row and refuse to report for work until there were improvements. The story as I recall is that they all had the same agent who thought that since they were all so crucial to the show their walking out together would compel the producer, Haim Saban, to give in to their demands. Saban promptly fired them and hired new actors to replace them. In Googling this question, the general belief is that the three left over salary issues and wanted more money. It was a non-union show so the producers did not have to abide by Screen Actors Guild rules dictating hours and pay.\n\nIn any event, their departure did not sit well with fans, including me, and it shook things up on the series for a while, as the absence of the three actors was covered up for eight Season 2 episodes (#21-28) via doubles shot from behind and stock footage from earlier episodes as well as voice dubbing by other actors who didn’t even sound like St. John, Trang or Jones, while the new characters, Adam, Rocky, and Aisha, played by Johnny Yong Bosch, Steve Cardenas, and Karan Ashley, were introduced and reveal their martial arts skills by helping out in the fights with the “Putties” (none-too-competent gray, faceless alien henchmen in superior numbers) and earning the trust and respect of the remaining Rangers over the course of these episodes. Walter Jones, Thuy Trang, and Austin St. John continued to be billed prominently while the new actors weren’t billed at all yet. In “The Power Transfer, Parts I and II,” Season 2/#27 and 28, Jason, Trini and Zack are finally ushered out in a vague display of ceremony by sending them off to represent Angel Grove at the World Teen Peace Conference. Their Mighty Morphin powers and costumes are transferred to Rocky, Adam, and Aisha, making them the new Red, Black and Yellow Rangers. The scene where Tommy, Kimberly and Billy give Jason, Trini and Zack the good news about the Conference is done entirely in silhouette and in the scene where their powers are transferred, the three departing Rangers have their helmets on the whole time.\n\nThe new actors wound up doing 71 episodes, but only in their 8th episode, S2/#29: Goldar’s Vice-Versa, do Cardenas, Bosch and Ashley finally get their proper billing. The new actors had the right looks and physical skills for the roles but audiences missed the distinct personalities of Jason, Zack and Trini, although the new members soon got into the swing of things and did fine jobs in the roles.\n\nThis transition must have given the editors and continuity overseers nightmares. Not only were they juggling action footage from two different Japanese Super Sentai Seasons, Zyuranger and Gosei Sentai Dairanger, by this point, but they were searching for footage of Trini, Zack and Jason that matched the scenes they had to insert them in and had to make sure Tommy, Kimberly and Billy were wearing the same outfits in the new scenes. And the new scenes with doubles substituted for Trini, Zack and Jason had to match but not be too conspicuous.\n\nIn later PR seasons, starting with “Power Rangers Lost Galaxy” (1999), the producers followed the Japanese model and simply changed the cast every season.\n\nIn those earliest viewings I was also impressed by the villain, Witch Bandora, dubbed Rita Repulsa in the Power Rangers version and voiced by Barbara Goodson. The Japanese footage featuring Machiko Soga as Bandora is retained in the U.S. version and intercut with her long-distance campaign to defeat the Power Rangers and conquer the earth. Soga, a popular comic actress in Japan, had played flamboyant villains in earlier Super Sentai seasons and had a long history as a character actress.\n\nI even spotted her in a comic scene in SAMARITAN ZATOICHI (1968), in which she plays a concession proprietor at a festival who thinks blind swordsman Zatoichi is an easy mark. Little did she know.\n\nThis is an excerpt from my IMDB review of “Denshi Sentai Denjiman,” the 1980 Super Sentai season, highlighting Ms. Soga:\n\nIn “Denjiman,” Soga’s villainy is so over the top that she makes Bandora seem like Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, in comparison. Soga has such a great face for this role, with piercing eyes and a wide, expressive mouth and jaw that can erupt in maniacal laughter at one moment and withering, lethal snarls the next. There are many great closeups of her and she’s a delight to watch the whole time, especially as she’s saddled with an outlandish costume and massive headpiece that any lesser performer would have found daunting, but not Ms. Soga, who wears it all with aplomb.\n\nBandora had some great lines in the subtitled version of “Zyuranger,” which finally came out in a box set from Shout Factory in 2015.\n\nEventually, Saban ran out of “Zyuranger” footage, so they had to find another way to keep Rita Repulsa in the cast. They cast a vaguely lookalike actress, Carla Perez, and continued to have Barbara Goodson provide the voice. Eventually, during Season 2, she was joined by a new villain, Lord Zedd, created expressly for the American version, although his sidekicks, Goldar, Squatt and Baboo, remained the same as Rita’s, with actors continuing in the roles in monster suits provided by Toei. Eventually, Rita was phased out entirely, leaving only Lord Zedd and the three sidekicks.\n\nEarly episodes also featured footage of another female villain from Zyuranger, dubbed “Scorpina” in the English version. She was played by Ami Kawai and was featured in several MMPR episodes. (IMDB only lists four for her, but she was in many more.)\n\nHere’s a shot from MMPR of all the Japanese cast members whose footage is retained in the American version:\n\nScorpina later turned up in a second season episode, “Goldar’s Vice-Versa,” disguised as a new student named Sabrina at Angel Grove High who reveals herself to the Rangers pretty quickly. She is played by an American actress, Sabrina Lu, in all-new footage.\n\nRather than repeat another long history of the show, as I did in my previous Power Rangers piece on the occasion of the show’s 25th anniversary, I’d like to pay tribute to actor Jason David Frank, who played Tommy Oliver, the Green Ranger and the sixth to join the team, in the first season of MMPR, joining the cast for the 17th episode, “Green with Evil, Part I,” which initially aired October 5, 1993. (Frank passed away last year, a suicide, at the age of 49 and would have turned 50 next week, on Sept. 4, 2023.)\n\nFrank starred as Tommy in three incarnations and five seasons of Power Rangers from 1993 to 1997: “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers” (three seasons), “Power Rangers Zeo,” and “Power Rangers Turbo.” He was the only cast member to play a Power Ranger in the original season to stay in the franchise as long as he did. After Tommy loses his powers as the Green Ranger, he became the White Ranger midway through the second season and eventually the Red Ranger in “Power Rangers Zeo” and “Power Rangers Turbo.”\n\nFrank later returned to star in “Power Rangers Dino Thunder” (2004), the second season to film in New Zealand, after production moved there with “Power Rangers Ninja Storm” (2003). In Dino Thunder, eleven years after his first appearance, he plays Dr. Thomas Oliver, now a science teacher at Reefside High School and mentor to three chosen students who become the Dino Thunder Rangers. He also joins them as the Black Ranger before too long. So throughout Frank’s career in Power Rangers, he played Green, White, Red and Black Rangers.\n\nIn the fourth episode of Dino Thunder, “Legacy of Power,” the three Dino Thunder Rangers are treated to a computer presentation of the then ten-year history of Power Rangers, from Mighty Morphin to Ninja Storm, with clips from each. It takes up most of the episode, which happens to have been the 500th in the franchise. (19 years later, I’m not sure how many more there have been since the seasons have gotten much smaller in the years since.)\n\nFrank also appeared in cameos in other PR episodes over the years, most memorably in the “Legendary Battle” episode presented as a special in the “Power Rangers Super Megaforce” season (2015). He’s one of a number of former cast members who show up to help the Megaforce team in the climactic battle. It’s quite an emotional moment when a large group of the costumed Rangers walk together up to the current cast members in the prelude to a sprawling battle and eleven take off their helmets to reveal who they are.\n\nSome of the former cast members are seen briefly earlier in the episode helping people injured or trapped in the wake of the massive alien invasion which forms the threat they must confront. Tommy is seen rescuing a boy from a car teetering on a precipice.\n\nFrank was arguably the most charismatic actor to appear in the 30-year franchise and was an excellent martial artist, performing his own moves and stunts in numerous out-of-costume fight scenes and tournament sequences in the seasons he starred in. I had always hoped he’d star in his own franchise of action movies, a la Steven Seagal or Jean-Claude Van Damme, but, alas, it never happened. He will be missed.\n\nIn the early seasons, he is also seen teaching a karate class to kids.\n\nFrank isn’t the only original cast member to have left us. Thuy Trang (Trini) was killed in an auto collision on September 3, 2001. Here’s a remembrance of her.\n\nNo Power Rangers write-up would be complete without acknowledging the comic skills of Paul Schrier and Jason Narvy as Bulk and Skull, the bullies who constantly taunt and harass the six members of the Power Rangers team, only to blunder and make comic spectacles of themselves, evoking laughter from the Rangers and the audience. Both actors showed remarkable skill at physical comedy and are a lot more entertaining than the comedy relief in later seasons. They were like a younger, more frenetic version of Laurel and Hardy, the comedy team popular in the 1920s, ’30s and ’40s. The two kept appearing in later seasons, although eventually Skull left and Bulk remained, coming in and out of the franchise for more episodes than any other regular cast member aside from Frank.\n\nI used to tape a lot of episodes for later viewing, but starting in 2013 with Power Rangers Megaforce, I made sure to get up every Saturday and Sunday morning at 8AM to watch the episodes as they were broadcast on Nickelodeon. And when the repeats inevitably began, I re-watched them. I liked the structure of looking forward every week to the show at a set time and channel. However, after 2021, with the end of Season 1 of “Power Rangers Dino Fury,” the series was pulled from Nickelodeon and transferred to Netflix where Season 2 of Dino Fury premiered at some point. (Pokemon was also pulled off of Disney XD around the same time and moved to Netflix.) I don’t get Netflix so I can’t watch it anymore. Recently, when I visited my daughter on my birthday, I watched Dino Fury Season 2, #1 on her TV. So it’s all come full circle.\n\nI own the box sets, released by Shout Factory, of every Power Rangers series up to and including “Power Rangers Ninja Steel” as well as 13 seasons of Super Sentai with English subtitles. The two series that came after Ninja Steel, “Power Rangers Beast Morphers” and “Power Rangers Dino Fury,” have so far not appeared on disc. Streaming dominates the new media environment, which leaves behind dinosaur devotees of physical media or those who like the structure of watching something as it airs. Know anyone like that? (As a rule, I don’t record anything anymore.) As it stands, I have enough unseen episodes of Power Rangers and the various Super Sentai seasons (stretching back to 1991) to keep me busy for years, as well as the ones I’ve seen that I want to re-watch!"
