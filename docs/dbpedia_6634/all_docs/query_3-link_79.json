        "text": "The Saban Center for Middle East Policy is a research organization established at the Brookings Institution in 2002 through the donation of $13 million by the Israeli media-mogul, Haim Saban.[1] Its current director is Kenneth M. Pollack. Pollack took over from Martin Indyk, who founded the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, an AIPAC think-tank.\n\nHistory\n\nAfter founder Haim Saban closed a profitable multi-million dollar business deal he reportedly contacted Martin Indyk to discuss how he could set up his own think-tank:\n\nWhen they met in New York about a week later, Indyk recalled, “Haim said, ‘I’ve made all this money; I’m giving ten million to the D.N.C., and I want to set up a think tank. I think we really have to resolve the Arab-Israel conflict. These terrorists give me a potch in the panim, but I still think it’s important for Israel’s future to achieve peace.’ ” Indyk advised him to make a donation to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, but Saban said, “ ‘You don’t understand. I want my own.’ ”[2]\n\nAt this time Indyk was working at WINEP but joined Saban's think-tank after Saban made an initial contribution of 13 million dollars for its establishment.\n\nSaban informed a New York Times reporter about his own views about how the conflict in Israel-Palestine would be resolved in 2004: \"I'm going to make a very controversial statement and I hope to God that I am proven totally wrong: I think that any resolution will have to go both on the Palestinian side and Israeli side to some form of civil war. It's not going to be without spilling blood.\"[1] These views did not stop Saban from creating his \"own\" think tank in 2002. He explained: 'I want my own [think tank].’\n\nCriticism\n\nAccording to prominent scholars John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, the Saban Center harbors undeniable pro-Israel biases:\n\nIt is hard to imagine that a research institute funded by Saban and directed by Indyk is going to be anything but pro-Israel. To be sure, the Saban Centre occasionally hosts Arab scholars and exhibits some diversity of opinion. Saban Center fellows – like Indyk himself – often endorse the idea of a two-state settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. But Saban Center publications never question US support for Israel and rarely, if ever, offer significant criticism of key Israeli policies. Moreover, individuals who stray from the Center’s line do not remain for long, as former NSC official Flynt Leverett’s brief tenure there illustrates.[3]\n\nMoreover, the Brookings Institution's work on the Middle East has degraded since it was transferred to the Saban Center:\n\nTake the Brookings Institution. For many years, its senior expert on the Middle East was William B. Quandt, a former National Security Council official with a well-deserved reputation for even-handedness. Today, Brookings’s coverage is conducted through the Saban Center for Middle East Policy, which is financed by Haim Saban, an Israeli-American businessman and ardent Zionist. The centre’s director is the ubiquitous Martin Indyk. What was once a non-partisan policy institute is now part of the pro-Israel chorus.\"[4]\n\nSaban Forum\n\nThe center's \"pro-Israel proclivities\"[3] take place at the annual Saban Forum which brings together US and Israeli leaders and analysts for a two-day conference which is held in Washington or Jerusalem. Marketed as an event aimed at \"strengthening bilateral ties between the two countries [Israel and the US],\"[5] forum debates are closed to the public.\n\nSaban Forum 2009\n\nTaking place at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem on November 14-16, the 2009 forum was titled \"The U.S.-Israel Partnership: Can New Governments Overcome Old Challenges\" and according to the Saban Center's website, was focused on addressing issues which the current US and Israeli administrations do not \"see eye-to-eye on,\"[6] including how to end the conflict in Palestine-Israel and Iran’s nuclear program. The event program can be downloaded here.\n\nSummary\n\n(All forum proceedings that were made available to the public can be found here.)\n\nThe Forum was conducted using the \"Chatham House Rule\" which conceals the identity and affiliation of speakers.\n\nEvent chairman Haim Saban provided opening introductions for the most high-profile participants: Bill Clinton, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Ehud Olmert. In a \"Letter from the Chairman\" Saban attempted to portray Israeli interests as equal to US interests and mentioned a rift between the current US and Israeli administrations that he hoped could be resolved with \"dialogue\" resulting from the event.[7]\n\nThe event was focused on Israel-Palestine issues, with participants traveling to Ramallah for a meeting with Palestinian National Authority Prime Minister, Salam Fayyad, and Israel's issues with the Syrian negotiations, Iran, and Israel's relationship with the United States\n\nOn Iran\n\n(The Saban Forum's official summary of the \"Assessing Progress with Iran\" event can be found here.)\n\nWhile Iran was discussed in nearly all the forum events, the specific Iran-focused discussion (titled \"Assessing Progress with Iran\") was led by US neoconservative hawks, Kenneth M. Pollack and Joseph Lieberman, and James Steinberg (an advocate of the Bush Doctrine), Likud Party member, Dan Meridor, and Netanyahu's national security advisor, Uzi Arad.\n\nFrom the Saban Forum-authored summary (the only information about this discussion that was made available to the public), the bulk of the discussion was focused on how Israel and the US should respond to Iran's nuclear program. While the \"military option\" was kept on the table, stronger sanctions (and those aimed at Iran's refined oil imports) were a point of focus. The Green Movement in Iran was discussed in relation to whether support of this opposition movement would support Israeli interests. While it was acknowledged that the US and Israel's interests aren't the same with Iran:\n\nFor instance, the point was made that while Israel would be more threatened by an Iranian nuclear weapon than the United States, the United States would be more threatened by an Iranian response to a military strike—U.S. objectives in Afghanistan and Iraq are intensely vulnerable to Iranian retaliation.[8]\n\nthe session allegedly ended with participants discussing the importance of how to get the public opinion of their respective populations to favor \"strong policy toward Iran.\"[8]\n\nEvent Summaries\n\nDue to the use of the Chatham House rule (which conceals the identities and affiliations of speakers), the majority of the Saban Forum 2009 discussions were only made available to the public in the form of summaries authored by Saban Center staff.\n\nOpening Session: Israeli and American Worldviews » (PDF)\n\nModerator: David Ignatius, Columnist, The Washington Post Participants: Avigdor Liberman, Deputy Prime Minister James Steinberg, Deputy Secretary of State\n\nA Breakfast Conversation with Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert: Peacemaking in Wartime » (PDF)\n\nModerator: Samuel Berger, Chair, Albright Stonebridge Group\n\nPresentation of the Fayyad Plan: Palestine: Ending the Occupation, Establishing the State » (PDF)\n\nWith Stanley Fischer, Governor, Bank of Israel\n\nA Conversation with President William J.
