I've been eager to see how it looks in motion, for a long time. Of the forthcoming shows, It also seems like it will be the closest to an old school, bright colorful Marvel comic brought to life.\n\nEyes of Wakanda has me intrigued, with the word of mouth and rumors going around.\n\nI'm just a little indifferent to Marvel Zombies at the moment.\n\nIt would be really cool if there are any surprise announcements but right now, I'd be happy with new animation, designs and images.\n\nLast edited: Aug 9, 2024\n\nFrontier\n\nModerator\n\nJoined\n\nMay 28, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n33,464\n\nLocation\n\nTemecula California\n\nAug 9, 2024\n\n#8\n\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man footage is what I'm most keen on seeing.

Maybe some casting announcements and premiere dates. That's all I really need. Some new project announcements would really put me over.\n\nOn another note, I saw something Open Season related make it onto D+ recently. If they could permanently fix the Sony streaming arrangement, that would be wonderful. LOL I have one stubborn buddy that finally, after years, started watching Spectacular. Got halfway through before the Sony shows were pulled. He deserved that but I still wish it was all in one place again.\n\nLast edited: Saturday at 2:27 PM\n\nRick Jones\n\nBig Fan\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 27, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n12,025\n\nLocation\n\nThe Marvel Action Universe\n\nSaturday at 4:36 PM\n\n#17\n\nHoping they put up some HQ versions of the Spidey images\n\nI want to dig into that character spread\n\nNever been a fan of the Morrison era costumes, so not excited about that one.\n\nFour episodes for Eyes of Wakanda and Marvel Zombies definitely feels like they'll just be mini-series.\n\nI'm not seeing dates for anything\n\nIf only they put the What If...? and Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man footage up...\n\nLast edited: Saturday at 4:48 PM\n\nRoyalRubble\n\nModerator\n\nJoined\n\nMar 8, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n19,020\n\nLocation\n\nA Valid Location\n\nSaturday at 5:28 PM\n\n#18\n\nHudson Thames will voice Peter/Spidey. Role reprisal from What If...?.\n\nPeter & Norman's relationship is like a \"What If?\" scenario of Peter & Tony in the MCU. Difference is Norman uses more questionable methods.\n\nFirst clip from the show reveals Peter gets his spider bite when Doctor Strange and Venom come through a portal fighting along with a spider.\n\nMarvel Zombies will be a 4-episode event series rated \"TV-MA\".\n\nFirst teaser shows Mandarin giving Shang-Chi the Ten Rings to save his arm from a zombie bite. Also included are Shang-Chi, Katy and Jimmy Woo fighting a Skrull biker gang, reminiscent of Mad Max sequence.\n\nYeah, no dates is kind of a letdown. Not as much as no official clips being released online, but still. Somehow I expected more from this event but it's not too bad, we did get a few intriguing tidbits I think.\n\nEDIT:\n\nComicBook.com has a recap with a few more details.\n\nLast edited: Saturday at 5:28 PM\n\nRick Jones\n\nBig Fan\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 27, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n12,025\n\nLocation\n\nThe Marvel Action Universe\n\nSaturday at 5:30 PM\n\n#19\n\nSo I guess this was the scene of his origin, all along."
