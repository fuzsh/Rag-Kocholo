        "text": "Joe Biden will return to Los Angeles later this month for a fundraising swing including a fundraiser hosted by Haim and Cheryl Saban and Casey Wasserman.\n\nThe event will take place February 20, part of a West Coast visit that also includes events in the Bay Area.\n\nAccording to the invite, tickets for the event start at $3,300 per person, rising to $250,000 for those who want to be listed as a co-chair. Those who contribute $25,000 and above will be able to get a photo with the president.\n\nThe event will raise money for the Biden Victory Fund, a joint committee that collects contributions for the Biden campaign, the Democratic National Committee and state committees.\n\nBiden was in Los Angeles last weekend for a brief visit that included an event at the home of George Lucas. Sources earlier said that he was meeting with Black leaders from the entertainment industry to talk about the campaign.\n\nBidenâ€™s first Los Angeles fundraising swing of the campaign was in December, when he raised money at an event at the home of James Costos and Michael Smith. The Los Angeles Times first reported on the Saban event."
