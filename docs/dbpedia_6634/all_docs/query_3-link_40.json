        "text": "Media mogul Haim Saban has resigned from University of California’s governing Board of Regents, citing undisclosed personal reasons.\n\n“My position on the board was an honor and I feel blessed to live in California and hope to be given the opportunity to serve this great state in any way again,” Saban wrote in the resignation letter he submitted last Friday. His resignation is effective immediately.\n\nSaban, 59, the founder of Saban Entertainment and Fox Family Worldwide, was appointed to the board in February 2002 by former Gov. Gray Davis. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger will name a successor to fill the remainder of Saban’s term, which expires March 1, 2013.\n\nSaban had been criticized during his tenure for missing several regents’ meetings. UC records indicate Saban’s attendance waned after his appointment. In the 2001-02 year, Saban attended all six meetings of the investment committee of which he was a member. In 2002-03, Saban attended one of his five audit committee meetings and five of 12 investment committee meetings.\n\nThe board consists of 26 members, 18 of whom are appointed by the governor to 12-year terms. One regent is a student who is appointed by the board and the remaining seven are ex officio members, including the governor, lieutenant governor, state superintendent of public instruction, UC alumni and the president of the 10-campus UC system."
