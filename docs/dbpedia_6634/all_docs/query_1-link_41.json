Smoove himself announced the project a few hours ago.\n\nHigh On Life is a comedic FPS with metroidvania elements, where humanity is enslaved by a race of aliens who use them as opiates. To escape, you must wield a variety of guns, all of which are alive and chat at you constantly throughout the game. High On Life has sold over eight million copies and been expanded with DLC material.\n\nMost of the other media outlets reporting on this are avoiding the elephant in the room, but JB Smoove was not the main selling point for High On Life when it launched. It was marketed heavily as a Justin Roiland game — the designs of the guns bear his drawing style and most of the trailers featured his particular gun with his particular voice. That lasted up to the point where Roiland was kicked out of the entertainment industry for disgusting behavior, after which point developer Squanch Games was like “ha ha, who’s Justin?”\"\n\nClick here to read the full article."
