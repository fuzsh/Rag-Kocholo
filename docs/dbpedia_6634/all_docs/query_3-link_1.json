        "text": "The Hills Around L.A. are famously studded with stars, but the real money lives in North Beverly Park.\n\n\"It's the most prestigious enclave for high-end residential real estate in Los Angeles,\" says Mauricio Umansky, Chief executive of The Agency, a luxury real estate firm.\n\nAccessible only through two guarded checkpoints, the paparazzi-proof development boasts 2-acre-plus parcels of level land, all behind more gates and overlooking the city below. Homes average 20,000 square feet and $24 million apiece, many the works of star architects like Richard Landry and William Hablinsky.\n\nResidents include wealthy A-listers like actor Sylvester Stallone and rocker Rod Stewart. Billionaire Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone lives toward the southern end of the development, near construction czar Ronald Tutor of Tutor Perini Corporation. The ultra exclusive development has also attracted a smattering of rich Saudis who have purchased their stateside palaces covertly through limited liability companies. Billionaire businessman Saleh Kamel is rumored to be one such resident: the reported owner of a sleek Contemporary that's currently asking an astounding $175,000 per month in rent.\n\nHere's a rundown of the neighborhood.\n\nA. Beverly Park Lane\n\nOwner: Prince Turki bin Nasser bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud\n\nAssessed Value: $21.7 million\n\nThe prince, Saudi Arabia's environmental chief, has owned this 5-acre double compound, with two separate mansions, a pool and a long private driveway, since the early 1990s.\n\nB. Beverly Park Lane\n\nOwner: Mark Wahlberg, actor and producer\n\nPurchase price: $8.3 million (2009)\n\nAfter acquiring 6 undeveloped acres, the star built a 34,000-square-foot château with a wine-tasting room, a gym and a resort-size swimming pool.\n\nC. Beverly Park Lane\n\nOwner: Prince Naef bin Ahmed Al-Saud, Saudi royal family\n\nPurchase price: $16.9 million (2011)\n\nThe Saudi general has been linked to two Beverly Park properties. This two-family estate has a pair of mansions totaling 18 bedrooms and 28 baths.\n\nD. Beverly Park Lane\n\nOwner: Bruce Makowsky and Kathy Van Zeeland\n\nPurchase price: $22.6 million (2010)\n\nBefore the fashion duo snapped it up, singer Prince rented this 30,000-square-foot Tuscan home (with a sand volleyball court) for a reported $200,000 a month.\n\nE. Beverly Park Lane\n\nOwner: Tom Gores, Platinum Equity\n\nPurchase price: $21 million (2010)\n\nThe billionaire's 21,000-square-foot Moorish manor, with 7 bedrooms, 15 baths and a pool, sits just up the street from his older brother Alec's compound.\n\nF. Beverly Park Court\n\nOwner: Steven Udvar-Hazy, Air Lease Corp.\n\nAssessed value: $17.5 million\n\nKnown as Villa Firenze, this billionaire's mammoth 10-acre-plus spread includes a 28,700-square-foot main house, pavilions, grottoes and an orchard.\n\nG. Beverly Park\n\nOwner: Haim Saban, media billionaire\n\nAssessed value: $26.7 million\n\nThe Power Rangers creator amassed three lots on close to 6 acres for his Richard Landry-designed mansion, lap pool, sports facilities and gardens.\n\nH. Beverly Park\n\nOwner: Eric Smidt, Harbor Freight Tools\n\nAssessed value: $17.5 million\n\nThe two lots here total 6 acres, and their amenities include French-style formal gardens and a 16,000-square-foot garage with a bowling alley--but no outdoor pool.\n\nI. Beverly Park Circle\n\nOwner: Alec Gores, private equity billionaire\n\nAssessed value: $31.4 million\n\nThe French château covers no less than 42,000 square feet and includes a wood-paneled library, a 2,600-bottle wine room, a poker room and multiple kitchens.\n\nJ. Beverly Park Circle\n\nOwner: Barry Bonds, former pro athlete\n\nAsking price: $25 million\n\nThe ex-baseball player has put his 17,000-square-foot spread up for sale. It has a theater, commercial-grade gym, spa and massive outdoor kitchen.\n\nK. Beverly Park Circle\n\nOwner: Denzel Washington, actor\n\nAssessed value: $14.6 million\n\nA 30,000-square-foot estate on two lots, with two entrances, a fountain-studded motor court, a guesthouse, a large pool and a sunken, illuminated tennis court.\n\nL. Beverly Park Circle\n\nOwner: Eddie Murphy, actor\n\nAssessed value: $19.5 million\n\nMurphy dropped $10 million on the 3.7-acre lot in 2001, constructing a 40,000-square-foot Italianate manse said to have a stripper pole in the master closet.\n\nNote: This is an extended version of the Forbes Magazine story \"Billionaire Bluffs.\"\n\n–-"
