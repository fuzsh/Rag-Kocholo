        "text": "MALIBU, Calif. - LAST Monday, two white wooden doors swung open for the first time onto Carbon Beach, courtesy of David Geffen, the DreamWorks co-founder, who owns a large shingled compound on the ocean and has the option of borrowing suntan lotion from billionaire neighbors like Eli Broad and Haim Saban. The mile-and-a-half-long beach, among the first glimpses of Malibu on the drive up from Los Angeles, is public by law, but to get to it, visitors must find a way to penetrate a wall of multimillion-dollar homes.\n\nThe famous Malibu coastline, the stuff of surfer lore and \"Gidget\" movies, is a battleground that heats up every summer. This year, the score is 1-0 in favor of the underdog: the beachgoer who appreciates exclusive comfort but can't afford it.\n\nMr. Geffen had agreed to allow a pathway to run alongside his property in 1983 in exchange for state permission to add a swimming pool and other expansions. But in 2002 he filed a lawsuit to fight the public's right to gain access to the beach at that spot. Earlier this year he relented.\n\nCameron Wellwood, 36, a guitar player in a band called the Harsh Carpets, was one of the first to pass through Mr. Geffen's gate."
