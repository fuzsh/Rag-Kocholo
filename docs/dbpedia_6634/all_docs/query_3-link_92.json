        "text": "Hollywood for Genocide!!! As the genocidal state of 🇮🇱 continued its assault on Palestinians in #Gaza on Saturday, Joe Biden flew from the G7 summit in Italy straight to Hollywood to attend a fundraiser that raised $28 million for his reelection campaign. Attendees at the gala paid anywhere from $250 to $500,000 to raise money for four more years of a #GenocideJoe presidency, which would include more #israeligenocide and a perpetuation of a failed proxy war in Ukraine. Among those who attended were: 1. Barack Obama, the US President who holds the record for the most people killed using drones: https://lnkd.in/eiPQKHjN 2. Jimmy Kimmel of \"Man Show\" & \"Juggies\" fame: https://lnkd.in/enTEWAaF (feminists everywhere should be proud) 3. George Clooney, whose wife Amal is an international Human Rights lawyer who has remained SILENT on the #israeligenocide 4. Jeffrey Katzenberg. As a refresher, Katzenberg co-founded DreamWorks, along with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen. All three are supporters of 🇮🇱. Katzenberg is also co-chair of Biden's reelection campaign and has stated, “Joe Biden, for his entire career has been a huge supporter of Israel”: https://lnkd.in/ey9Y4d-a This is what Hollywood supports. These are its values personified. For those who support the #BDS movement, note that it doesn't just apply to companies, but also to individuals and their bodies of work. By the way, there were also hundreds who protested this event, something which won't be covered by #MSM: https://lnkd.in/ep26jeRk https://lnkd.in/eDqqtKWU\n\nHere is a thought for how to improve the lives of the average person. Tax the rich and stop spending billions of dollars to support a genocidal apartheid regime. Play in your own garden instead of going and messing around in other countries and trying to have us believe it has anything to do with making life better for people in North America. I despised Trump. Now it looks like you're all cut from the same cloth. Fill your own pockets full of cash while you do daily theatre for the masses. Where is the help for the homeless? Where is the help for people who need affordable health care? Where is the help for a decent education and food on the table? Yeah sure turn it into a bad hombres at the border issue. The distraction isn't working and if people had some sense of things being okay then maybe they would not numb their existence with drugs and I am pretty sure there are reliable studies supporting this view. Instead people will be demonized for addiction and you can continue to feed the largest incarceration system in the world. BTW how many mass shootings have there been in the USA in 2024? But everyone still has their guns right? You are all a despicable lot. https://lnkd.in/euGKcXgm\n\n𝗣𝗢𝗟𝗜𝗧𝗜𝗖𝗢: 𝗣𝗥𝗢-𝗣𝗔𝗟𝗘𝗦𝗧𝗜𝗡𝗜𝗔𝗡 𝗣𝗥𝗢𝗧𝗘𝗦𝗧𝗘𝗥𝗦 𝗔𝗥𝗘 𝗕𝗔𝗖𝗞𝗘𝗗 𝗕𝗬 𝗕𝗜𝗗𝗘𝗡𝗦 𝗕𝗜𝗚𝗚𝗘𝗦𝗧 𝗗𝗢𝗡𝗢𝗥𝗦 Article excerpts: \"The donors include some of the biggest names in Democratic circles: Soros, Rockefeller and Pritzker, according to a POLITICO analysis.\" \"Two of the organizers supporting the protests at Columbia University and on other campuses are Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow. Both are supported by the Tides Foundation, which is seeded by Democratic megadonor George Soros and was previously supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It in turn supports numerous small nonprofits that work for social change.\" \"Soros declined to comment. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has previously funded the Tides Foundation and other groups, said it no longer has active grants to Tides. It also does not support Jewish Voice for Peace or IfNotNow.\" \"Another notable Democratic donor whose philanthropy has helped fund the protest movement is David Rockefeller Jr., who sits on the board of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. In 2022, the fund gave $300,000 to the Tides Foundation; according to nonprofit tax forms, Tides has given nearly $500,000 over the past five years to Jewish Voice for Peace, which explicitly describes itself as anti-Zionist.\" \"Several other groups involved in pro-Palestinian protests are backed by a foundation funded by Susan and Nick Pritzker, heir to the Hyatt Hotel empire — and supporters of Biden and numerous Democratic campaigns, including $6,600 to the Biden Victory Fund a few months ago and more than $300,000 during the 2020 campaign.\" \"The trail of donations shows a series of blurred lines when it comes to liberal causes and Democratic politics. Often those missions are aligned, but they also sometimes have different and — particularly when it comes to Gaza — conflicting agendas and tactics. And a small group of wealthy heavyweights are often playing an outsize role funding many of them.\" by SHIA KAPOS Full article; https://lnkd.in/egbNrXYh\n\nWed., Feb. 7 @ 2PM ET: Join us for an eye-opening talk where our guest expert reveals his years of secrets on gaining and maintaining sponsorship connections while also growing a donor base.
