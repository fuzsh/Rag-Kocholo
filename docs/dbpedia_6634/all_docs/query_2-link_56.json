        "text": "8440 Wilshire Blvd. Beverly Hills, CA 90211 | map |\n\nMore pages about the Fox Wilshire/Saban Theatre: lobby areas | recent auditorium views | vintage auditorium views | stage | booth |\n\nOpened: September 19, 1930 as the Fox Wilshire Theatre with the Marx Brothers in \"Animal Crackers\" as the initial attraction. The premiere was attended by Fay Wray, Jeanette MacDonald, Robert Montgomery and many others. Fox West Coast had a 20 year lease. The building was erected and owned by Los Angeles theatre man Albert H. Chotiner and Eastern financier Arthur Forst.\n\nThe opening night photo by Mott Studios is from the California State Library collection. It also appears with several interior views as a collage from the UCLA S. Charles Lee Papers Collection. UCLA has a number of sketches by Lee of various early versions of the tower that can be seen among their 25 images of the theatre that are on Calisphere.\n\nArchitect: S. Charles Lee designed one of the most stunning of all the Los Angeles movie palaces. It was Lee's second theatre in Los Angeles. The Tower had opened in 1927, the Los Angeles would come along in January 1931. The Fox Wilshire was the first of many he would do in the art deco style but he never got a chance to do another large theatre that would rival this one.\n\nThe interior color scheme of black and silver was enhanced by coral colored seating and drapes. The uniquely styled \"curlicue\" front curtain opened iris-fashion in several stages. Almost all of the original color scheme is gone with the exception of the ante-proscenium area -- restored in 2008 to all its silvery wonder. Work in 2023 brought back some of the original decorative scheme to the lobby ceiling.\n\nCalisphere has listings for the 623 items in the S. Charles Lee Papers Collection at the UCLA Charles E. Young Research Library that have been digitized so far.\n\nThis floorplan for the Fox Wilshire comes from an article by S. Charles Lee in the December 28, 1929 issue of Motion Picture News. It seems to be a preliminary version. Many areas weren't built as shown. The article, on Internet Archive, also has sketches of alternate exterior looks for the project.\n\nThe new theatre was featured in the October 25, 1930 issue of Exhibitors Herald-World in an article by Tom Hacker titled \"The Modern Motif in Fantastic Mood.\" He comments:\n\n\"... A new Fox theatre that challenges the theory that the modernist can't play make believe. The new Fox Wilshire in Beverly Hills, Cal., just opened, represents the ultimate in dazzling and daring treatment. Basing his design on modernistic principles, S. Charles Lee, the architect, employed a unique and highly imaginative motif, which is incorporated in both interior and exterior of the large edifice. The Wilshire seats 2,500 persons, making it the third largest motion picture theatre in Los Angeles.\n\n\"The Fox Wilshire was constructed around basic acoustical and projection plans. Beginning at the extreme rear of the stage, the auditorium is fashioned in the shape of a mammoth horn to attain perfect sound reception. The color scheme is silver and black and coral, with an elegant organ screen forming the proscenium arch. The organ console carries the same design and is flanked on either side by glass panels overlaid with bright silvery metal. Various colored lights are installed in the rear of the two panels. The electric lighting fixtures are multi-colored and the light is reflected in the silver, changing the entire color effect of the auditorium as the light dissolves from one shade into another.\n\n\"The extreme modern design of the house extends also to its individual furnishings and seats, all of which were especially created. The mammoth curtain is a distinct innovation. Opening like an iris, it develops from three to four phases of color and design as it unfolds. Coral shades, beginning in the carpets, are carried into the color scheme of the seats, blending gradually upward into the many shades of silver and black in the mural and ceiling decorations. In line with the advanced theory of construction, the Fox Wilshire has an oval foyer, with curving stairs on either side leading to the balcony. Toilet facilities are located on a half-level of these stairs, as opposed to the usual basement location. This position affords these rooms an abundance of light and air. A cosmetic room adds to the facilities of the women's department. The treatment of the main foyer, like that of the balance of the house, is black, coral and silver, having black walls and a silver ceiling supported on silver columns. Of the dark shade, three tones are featured, including dull, medium and bright. Light cast on these tones gives an affect of red, silver and black.\n\n\"As extra insurance against casualty, the building was constructed of monolithic concrete, which is said to be both fire-proof and earthquake-proof. Fire exit facilities exceed by 25 percent those required by law. Special equipment for the hard-of-hearing is another of the refinements. The headphones are plugged in a socket near the seat by an usher. A volume control regulates the sound. The projection room has been developed to accommodate wide-film projectors or any new innovation that it might be necessary to install. The stage has also been built with wide-screen in mind. Ventilating and cooling equipment balances the humidity of the air with the number of patrons present. The balance of the building is devoted to stores and offices, the managers' headquarters being located off the right stairway leading to the mezzanine and balcony. The exterior of the seven-story building is modernistically designed in a dull gray finish, with the theatre marquee in bright black tile. A revolving neon tube sign carrying the name of Fox has been installed on the tower.\"\n\nUpstairs: The office tower had an opulent penthouse apartment for Howard Sheehan of 20th Century Fox.\n\nA look into the penthouse dining room. It's a photo on Calisphere from the UCLA S. Charles Lee Papers Collection.\n\nThe fireplace in the penthouse. It's on Calisphere from the UCLA S. Charles Lee Papers Collection. It's one of ten views of the penthouse in the collection indexed as \"Sheehan Apartments.\"\n\nThe Fox Wilshire as a Movie Theatre: The theatre was always a premier first run venue for Fox West Coast Theatres and its successor National General. Later it was operated by Mann Theatres after they took over the remnants of the Fox Circuit in 1973.\n\nFor the second film released in Cinemascope, \"How to Marry a Millionaire,\" 20th Century Fox took it to the Fox Wilshire. The premiere film in the process, \"The Robe,\" had opened at the Chinese on September 24, 1953. See Michael Coate's \"Looking Back at CinemaScope\" article on the site Digital Bits.\n\nThe ad for the premiere engagement of \"How To Marry a Millionaire\" at the Fox Wilshire in 1953. Thanks to Ken McIntyre for sharing it as a post for the Photos of Los Angeles private Facebook group.\n\nAn image from the center of the souvenir program for \"How To Marry a Millionaire.\" Thanks to Jeffrey Nickora for sharing it. Also see the program cover. Their copy noted that CinemaScope had \"revolutionized motion picture history... Conceivably, somewhere in the world one man may exist who has never heard of CinemaScope... he must be a hermit, cut off from society in a sealed cave...\"\n\n70mm at the Fox Wilshire: In the 1959 the theatre was was equipped for 70mm and hosted the exclusive premiere run of Walt Disney's \"Sleeping Beauty\" in 70mm Technirama and 6 channel stereo.\n\nThanks to Michael Coate for sharing this January 29, 1959 \"Sleeping Beauty\" ad from his collection. It was a post on the Friends of 70mm private Facebook group. The theatre also had a run of \"Solomon and Sheba\" in 70mm beginning December 26 that year.\n\nThe theatre played a number of long-run reserved seat 70mm engagements including \"Exodus\" (December 21, 1960), \"The Sound of Music\" (March 10, 1965), \"Sand Pebbles\" (December 28, 1966), \"Far From the Madding Crowd\" (October 19, 1967), \"Star!\" (October 31, 1968), \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" (November 7, 1969), \"Fiddler on the Roof\" (November 5, 1971) and \"Man of La Mancha\" (December 13, 1972).\n\nAn ad for \"The Sound of Music.\" Thanks to Mark Radley for including it with a post about the film for the Friends of 70mm Facebook group.\n\n70mm reissue, second run, return and move-over engagements included: \"Ben-Hur\" (1969, reserved seats), \"Sound Of Music\" (1969), \"South Pacific\" (1969), \"Doctor Zhivago\" (1970), \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1971, 1975), \"Around The World In 80 Days\" (1971), \"MGM Fabulous Three\" (1971), \"My Fair Lady\" (1971), \"West Side Story\" (1971), \"Camelot\" (1973, 1974, 1976, 1977), \"Fiddler On The Roof\" (1973), \"Man Of La Mancha\" (1973), \"This Is Cinerama\" (1973 - with a curved screen), \"Oliver!\" (1974), \"Hello, Dolly!\" (1975, 1976, 1977), \"Gone With The Wind\" (1976), \"Logan’s Run\" (1976), \"A Star Is Born\" (1977). Thanks to Michael Coate for the research.\n\nClosing as a film venue: The Fox Wilshire closed as a film venue in 1978. Mann Theatres was still operating it early that year.\n\nGoing Legit: It got a renovation in 1981 (with a muted color palette) by architect Richard McCann and reopened as a legit house under Nederlander Organization management as the Wilshire Theatre. Among other attractions, Liz and Dick appeared in 1983 with a touring production of \"Private Lives.\"\n\nAfter the Nederlanders stopped using the theatre, they rented it to a group called the Beverly Hills Performing Arts Center (aka Temple of the Arts). In the years following it had only sporadic bookings of Broadway plays, smaller musicals (the stage is only 26' deep), concerts, and religious events. The first film to play the theatre in years was the December 2006 premiere of \"Dreamgirls.\"\n\nThe group had been renting for over a decade and had made repeated offers to buy the building but were always rebuffed. Jimmy Nederlander reportedly told them \"We buy theatres. We don't sell theatres.\" But with the closing of their competitive threat, the Shubert, things changed. The building was purchased from the Nederlander Organization in 2006.\n\nAt the time they were calling it the Wilshire Theatre Beverly Hills. A program of restoration was begun. Early projects were new carpet, reupholstered seats and a repainting of the proscenium area. Tech work in recent years has also included lighting and sound upgrades.\n\nSAS operated the theatre for the new owners beginning in 2006. Bobby Jones comments:\n\n\"I worked/ran SAS for ten years from 2006 to 2016. SAS ran the Wilshire/Saban from 2006 to 2013? Or 14? I did a couple 40 hour days at that theater. Show up Friday, leave Sunday. Back when I was young.\"\n\nThe theatre was renamed the Saban Theatre in 2009. Restoration work continues in various areas of the theatre, much of it funded by a $5 million donation from Haim Saban.\n\nStatus: Alive and well as a concert venue now booked by promoter Lance Sterling of Sterling Venue Ventures, a company with the slogan \"Where Music Meets the Soul.\" They also operate music clubs in Agoura Hills, Santa Clarita and Montclair. The theatre occasionally hosts other events as well.\n\nMore exterior views:\n\n1930 - A February 27 construction view by Mason W. Shouler from the UCLA S.
