        "text": "The Saban Theatre is a historic theater located at 8440 Wilshire Boulevard, Beverly Hills, California, formerly known as the Fox Wilshire Theater and Wilshire Theatre Beverly Hills. It is an Art Deco structure at the southeast corner of Wilshire and Hamilton Drive, designed by architect S. Charles Lee and is considered a classic Los Angeles landmark. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 3, 2012. The exterior of the building with its simple Art Deco ornamentation is one of the first buildings seen by pedestrians and drivers entering the eastern boundary of the city of Beverly Hills. The Saban Theatre has been both a significant cultural and architectural landmark for Los Angeles and Beverly Hills since its opening as the Fox Wilshire Theatre on September 19, 1930. It was originally designed with 2500 seats by noted theatre architect S. Charles Lee to be a major film presentation house, even including a stage for Vaudeville acts before the films. Restoration work continues in various areas of the theatre, much of it funded by a $5 million donation from Haim Saban, and now you know how it got it's current name.\n\nSource: Wikipedia | Los Angeles Theatres"
