        "text": "Israeli-American mogul Haim Saban, a major Democratic donor and bundler, is expected to host a virtual fundraiser in support of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden next Monday, Jewish Insider has learned.\n\nThe event will feature Biden, along with Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), and costs $500,000 per person, a person with knowledge of the event told JI.\n\nSaban and his wife, Cheryl, who were the largest individual donors to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, stayed on the sidelines and didn’t endorse any candidate during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.\n\n“I am pleased to see so many Democrats coming together in support of Vice President Joe Biden, and I am proud to endorse him for president,” Saban told Jewish Insider on Thursday. “Joe is a proven leader who has the experience, vision and heart to unify our country in this hyper-partisan time. Joe’s judgement and track record show that he will broadly restore America’s position as a moral and global leader, and ensure that the strong, bipartisan alliance between the U.S. and Israel remains unshakeable,” Saban explained.\n\nPointing to comments Biden made in 2013 at a J Street conference — “If there were not an Israel, we would have to invent one to make sure our interests were preserved — Saban said, “I am confident that Joe is the right leader to make real progress for Americans and our international partners, and urge our party to unite in his support.”"
