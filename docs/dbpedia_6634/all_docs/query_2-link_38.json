        "text": "The third film in the long-running Power Rangers franchise is out this weekend, and in it, five teens are randomly chosen to transform into superheroes and fight the enemy, Rita Repulsa — but they have to work closely together.\n\nAlong the way, they have to reveal, and take advantage of, the traits that make them unique.\n\nThe reviews so far are mixed, but the movie marks a couple of key firsts in the superhero genre — as well as the return of the series' multi-billionaire creator — so we've gathered 10 fascinating facts:\n\n1. Power Rangers is the first major superhero movie to include an LGBTQ hero\n\nIn the film, a character assumes that Trini (Becky G) is having problems with a boyfriend — until Trini reveals that her relationship woes are actually with a girlfriend. \"It's done in a very classy way, and in a way that's really real, because Trini doesn't know herself, and it's that moment where she says out loud, 'I've never said any of this out loud,'\" Becky G said in an interview. \"Zordon says 'You must shed your masks to wear this armor' [and] it's true. People should accept themselves for who they really are and be proud of that, and take ownership of that first, and learn that self-love to really be happy.\"\n\n2. It's the first major superhero movie to feature a character with autism spectrum disorder\n\n\"I knew that it was my job to show that people [who] are on the spectrum are just regular people, literally,\" explained RJ Cyler, who plays Billy, in an interview. \"They have the same emotions, they want to be loved, they want people to love, they want relationships, they want connections. And I was really excited to be able to play that because I know it means so much to so many people.\"\n\n3. Director Dean Israelite, 32, aimed to make the movie playful, fun and funny\n\n\"I hope it's going to feel very grounded at the same time, and very contemporary and have a real edge to it, and a real gut to it,\" he said in an interview. \"So I think it's going to be a fun, joyful [movie] but one that feels completely grounded in a real world, with real characters going through real things.\"\n\n4. Screenwriter John Gatins also co-wrote this year's blockbuster remake of the King Kong story, Kong: Skull Island\n\nHe's also an actor who has had roles in several films, including three with Eddie Murphy (Norbit, Meet Dave and A Thousand Words).\n\n5. In advance of the film's release, you can catch up on all the past episodes\n\nThe Amazon-owned Twitch streaming platform is running a 17-day marathon of the TV franchise, screening all 831 episodes of the 19 different TV series.\n\n6. Multi-billionaire producer Haim Saban has returned\n\nSaban first launched the franchise in 1993, and has since become one of the richest people in the United States; his estimated net worth is $3 billion​. Now he has returned to produce the new Power Rangers film. The 72-year-old is also a longtime musician, and created the theme song for 1995's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie.\n\n7. There's some new sparkle in their merchandise\n\nThere are heaps of merchandise associated with Power Rangers, from toys to hoodies to online games; in 2016 alone the retail figures were a whopping $900 million. But the latest offering is even more glittery: a new jewellery line designed around the iconic lightning bolt logo that's aimed at older fans. The creator is Dannijo, and already the designs have traveled the runways at both New York and London Fashion Week. \"These take us directly to millennial and older consumers,\" says Saban Brands CEO Janet Hsu. \"We've always had product, but we haven't driven these interesting stories until now, so we are really embracing that.\"\n\n8. One of the actresses got famous through YouTube videos\n\nBefore she started landing major acting roles, Rebbeca Marie Gomez — known as Becky G — gained fame as a singer, songwriter and rapper by posting videos of herself covering popular songs.\n\n9. The voice of Alpha 5 may sound very familiar\n\nAlpha 5 may be a multi-functional semi-sentient automaton from Edinoi, a trusty robotic assistant responsible for daily operations — but his voice is that of Bill Hader, formerly of SNL.\n\n10. Even though they could barely make ends meet, actor RJ Cyler's family hit the road in pursuit of his dream\n\nCyler's dad was a Florida truck driver, and his family struggled to pay the bills; but the actor, the youngest of three kids, had a dream. So his parents sold their possessions, packed up and moved to California. It was a serious struggle at first, but then Cyler landed a key role in the Sundance-winning Me and Earl and the Dying Girl; suddenly and he was on the Hollywood radar. \"This acting is going to leave my stain. Not just my mark, because you can wipe a mark off,\" he said in an interview. \"But a stain, it's going to take a whole lot to get that out and that's how I'm going to leave my stain on this world.\"\n\n— Jennifer Van Evra, q digital staff"
