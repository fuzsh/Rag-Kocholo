        "text": "BERKELEY (AP -- A University of\n\nCalifornia regent who had been criticized for his attendance record at board\n\nmeetings announced Wednesday he is stepping down.\n\nRegent Haim Saban, a Los Angeles\n\nbusinessman who founded Fox Family Worldwide and Saban Entertainment, producer\n\nof the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, said in a statement that he is resigning\n\neffective immediately due to personal reasons.\n\n\"My position on the board was an\n\nhonor, and I feel blessed to live in California and hope to be given the opportunity\n\nto serve this great state again in any way,\" said the 59-year-old Saban, who\n\nwas appointed to a 12-year term by then-Gov. Gray Davis in 2002.\n\nEarlier this year, state Sen. Jeff\n\nDenham, R-Merced, had recommended that Saban resign after the San Diego Union-Tribune\n\nreported that Saban had missed a majority of board meetings.\n\nUC records indicate Saban's attendance\n\nwaned after his appointment. In the 2001-02 year, Saban attended all six meetings\n\nof the investment committee of which he was a member, according to university\n\nrecords. For the 2002-03 year, Saban attended one of his five audit committee\n\nmeetings and five of 12 investment committee meetings.\n\nUC's board is made up of 18 regents\n\nappointed by the governor and confirmed by the state senate, one UC student\n\nappointed for a one-year term, and seven elected officials, including the governor.\n\nRegents set policy for the nine-campus\n\nsystem, which has more than 200,000 students and an annual budget of $14 billion.\n\nCurrent regents include John Moores, owner of the San Diego Padres, and Sherry\n\nLansing, chair and CEO of Paramount Pictures Motion Picture Group.\n\nRegents are unpaid and are expected\n\nto attend six, two-day board meetings per year. They also are expected to participate\n\nin other committee hearings, some of which are held by teleconference, that\n\nmay be scheduled at other times in the year. They make campus visits and are\n\nsent thick stacks of documents to read before meetings."
