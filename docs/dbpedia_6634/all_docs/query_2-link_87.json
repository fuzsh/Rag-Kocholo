I wouldn't be surprised if he decides to buy the franchise again when Hasbro plans to offload it.\n\nBack to top\n\nHyperGatack wrote:\n\nNot surprising; Saban did try to screw over Gene Simmons.\n\nLike… blatantly. To his face.\n\nI remember that story. Saban didn’t realize Simmons knew Hebrew.\n\nBack to top\n\nI heard that Saban screwed over musicians for decades. He paid desperate musicians peanuts and made them sign over all the rights of the music to him. Then he and Shuki Levy would be the only ones credited for the music on the cartoon and the only ones to get residuals.\n\nBack to top\n\nThis really sucks to hear honestly. I don't know all about Saban and their goings-on so much of this is news to me. Makes me frustrated that I make more than they did and they those guys were on TV doing stunts and makes people's childhoods.\n\nBack to top\n\nIs this really just a Saban thing? I thought Power Rangers filmed in New Zealand because it was very cheap and there aren't a lot of actor rights there.

But by then the franchise had been around for ten years. All the previous seasons, including every season with Zordon, was filmed in California.\n\nBack to top bleachj0j\n\nJoined: 22 Nov 2008\n\nPosts: 926\n\nPosted: Fri Jul 14, 2023 11:11 pm\n\nFeelMyBlade wrote:\n\nIs this really just a Saban thing?

Saban did not mess with those unions during those years. Especially with the actors.\n\nBack to top Aresef\n\nJoined: 22 Jun 2005\n\nPosts: 914\n\nLocation: MD\n\nPosted: Sat Jul 15, 2023 12:00 am\n\nYep, before Saban Entertainment made nice with SAG in 1998, the union was actively telling members to keep away from their shows. And Power Rangers was taking money out of ranger actors’ paychecks for being late to ADR and things like that.\n\nThe show went non-union upon its move to New Zealand, with the exception of the recent special.\n\nBack to top\n\nYes, that times actors were MUCH MORE sincere and honest comparing modern time.\n\nBack to top MarshalBanana\n\nJoined: 31 Aug 2014\n\nPosts: 5449\n\nPosted: Sat Jul 15, 2023 8:53 am\n\nI've heard Saban Entertainment are infamous for penny pinching.\n\nBack to top"
