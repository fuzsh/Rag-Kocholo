        "text": "Haim Saban has never been short of chutzpah. A few years ago, when his plan to build a palatial Malibu beachfront compound looked doomed because the construction he had proposed would block the public's view of the ocean, he hit upon an ingenious solution. He bought a similar $1 million beachfront a mile away, which he immediately donated to the state of California. Soon afterwards he received the permit necessary to build his desired hideaway.\n\nThis pathologically private Egyptian-born, Israeli-raised entrepreneur - personally worth $1.7 billion according to Forbes - has been making waves in Europe. After the collapse of his $2bn bid for Leo Kirch's fallen media empire, which includes ProSiebenSat1 and Europe's largest programming library - and his bailing out of EM.TV's auction for Jim Henson Company - he has been linked to various consortia orbiting Britain's increasingly glum ITV network.\n\nYet until a month ago many of those working in the media would not have recognised Saban's name unless they happened to have small children in the early 1990s who stayed glued to the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers cartoons until the end credits. It was this team of martial arts vigilantes wielding colour-coordinated weapons that propelled Saban to his fortune and enables him to live on his six-acre Beverly Hills estate, where he devotes his energies to philanthropic causes and US-Israel political relations. Earlier this year he gave $3.3m to create the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, which has become one of the most widely-quoted think tanks on the lessons of Camp David, regime change in Iraq and reform in Iran.\n\nBut while most of his phone calls these days are to ex-American presidents or former Israeli premiers, Saban still has $1.5bn burning a hole in his back pocket. Last week one of his closest friends and a highly placed business associate were both quick to stress that he has not given up on the Kirch prize. 'It is so not over,' said one. 'It was not a question of not raising the money; it was just that the deal terms weren't right,' said the other. 'Haim never takes \"no\" for an answer,' adds his former business partner, the composer Shuki Levy, who has just struck a deal to take his musical based on the Masada (the heroism and sacrifice of a besieged Jewish garrison) to Broadway next year.\n\nSaban, who has just endured a Masada-like experience at the hands of the German press, has always prided himself on being a hard-nosed businessman and a schmoozer. Born in Alexandria and raised in a Tel Aviv apartment, where his family shared a communal bathroom with streetwalkers, he played bass in a rock band, provided music for Israeli television programmes and ran a successful tour company. In 1975, he moved to Paris, where he had the idea that the theme tunes to the English-language TV programmes shown might be popular on French radio. He discovered that he could buy the foreign rights to such tunes for practically loose change, and by the early 1980s he was licensing entire shows, mainly kids' programmes. In 1980, virtually dragged by Levy, he set up in Los Angeles, where the duo composed theme tunes for TV shows including Dallas and entered the children's programming market via cable network Nickelodeon with such fare as Koala Walla World and Saban's Fairy Tales.\n\nTravelling in Japan, Saban discovered a show, Kyoryu Sentai ZyuRanger, that would change his life. It had been deemed too quirky for foreign audiences by US acquisition scouts, but Saban bought the foreign rights in 1985 for $10,000 an episode and eight years later he licensed the show to Fox Kids Net work, a fledgling cable channel owned by Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corp. With Fox's marketing clout Saban built what became the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers into a massive global franchise. After other hits, including X-Men, he merged his media company with Fox Kids Network to form Fox Family Worldwide in 1996. A rare blip was the short-lived Saban Foods, which choked on the losses from Mighty Morphin Macaroni & Cheese and the like. In October 2001, Saban and Murdoch sold Fox Family to Walt Disney Co for $5.3bn and Saban walked away with $1.5bn - the largest cash transaction conducted by an individual in Hollywood history. Saban immediately dissolved all his other Hollywood activities - apart from Saban Music, which by then had swelled to include a film production and sales unit churning out a lot of straight-to-video fare and TV movies.\n\nBut Saban was better known for his support of the Democrat party and leftwing Israeli politicians than his mogul lifestyle, negotiating skills and Yiddish shtick. During the Clinton administration, he was a guest at the White House and Camp David, and he and wife Cheryl entertained the Clintons at least twice at home. Saban served on the President's Export Council, advising the White House on trade issues. Saban's $7m donation to the Democrats during last November's mid-term elections was the highest ever at a non-presidential poll. The self-described 'cartoon schlepper' also takes an unusual pride in being a top contributor: when he learned that another donor had topped his contributions to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee by $250,000, he immediately sent the DCCC a cheque for that amount, with a $1 bill attached.\n\nIn January 2001 his fundraising activities proved more irksome when a Tel-Aviv attorney, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, filed an Israeli High Court petition calling for criminal charges to be brought against Saban and former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak. Court papers alleged that on 25 March 1999, a month and half before Israel's national elections, Saban hosted a campaign fundraiser in his Beverly Hills home for then prime ministerial candidate Barak, in violation of Israeli election laws. The 35 to 40 guests who attended the dinner were each asked to donate $10,000 to benefit the Barak campaign. Saban promised to match each donation to Barak, dollar for dollar.\n\nLos Angeles film producer Daniel Dimbort, who attended that fundraiser and is a long-time friend, says: 'Haim really is a mensch. He doesn't play the Hollywood big shot and he's at his happiest when he's raising money for causes he believes in. He does like doing deals, though. He's got a lot of money and will buy something, certainly in Europe, but only if the price is right.'\n\nBut although he may well have another stab at Kirch and it is far too early to call on any movement on the ITV front, Saban is increasingly in danger of becoming known as the man who gets his wallet out and then puts it away again. Rumours that he was going to buy a major stake in Israel's Bank Leumi fizzled out and last November Saban Capital Group and Roy Disney's private investment company Shamrock Holdings quietly dropped their joint bid for the controlling share of Bezeq, Israel's national telecommunications provider, without providing an explanation.\n\nNevertheless, Saban remains active beneath the radar of most City editors. He is one of the few 'executive investors' in Jerusalem Global Ventures, a venture capital fund that invests in communications, information technology and life sciences companies. In March, JGV life sciences fund InnoMed pumped $2m into Chiasma, a start-up outfit exploring technology that will enable drugs to be administered into the bloodstream without a needle. Inevitably, the newspapers are more interested in which media company Saban will inject his cash into.\n\nWhat they say\n\nSaban is very charismatic, knows what he wants, and has the network necessary to be successful in this industry\n\nMathias Doepfner, chief executive of Axel Springer\n\nNo one who knows him thought he'd go lie on a beach after the sale to Disney. Haim has deal-making in his blood. Before you'd know you'd been had in a deal, Haim would have moved on to something else\n\nLongtime business associate\n\nProfile\n\nName: Haim Saban\n\nJob: Chairman/CEO Saban Capital Group\n\nBorn: Alexandria, Egypt, 1944\n\nFamily: Married to Cheryl, two children, two stepchildren\n\nEducation: Agricultural school, Tel Aviv\n\nNet worth: $1.7 billion"
