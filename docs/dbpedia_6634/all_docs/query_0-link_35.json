        "text": "The creator behind the iconic Power Rangers franchise is saying goodbye to his Malibu home of more than 20 years. Television producer and entertainment mogul Haim Saban, founder of Saban Entertainment and Saban Capital, is best known for producing television series including The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and X-Men: The Animated Series. Now the home that these iconic shows built on the sands of the Pacific Ocean can be yours for $75 million. “The floor plan is a ten plus; it flows beautifully,” listing agent Chris Cortazzo of Compass tells Robb Report. “The home is built like a fortress, and you feel the quality when you walk in.”\n\nSituated on a half-acre parcel with 120 feet of beach frontage, the 11,074-square-foot home is located along the famed Carbon Beach in Malibu, which has been nicknamed “Billionaires’ Beach” by locals due to its ultra-wealthy current and former residents like David Geffen and Larry Ellison. Saban and his wife, Cheryl, purchased the property in the 1990s and spent years transforming the existing home into what it is today. There are nine bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, and three powder rooms filtered through two levels. The white stucco structure is fronted by an elegant porte cochère and has a three-car garage with a 220-volt Tesla plug and parking for an additional five cars.\n\nThe home features classic and contemporary interiors, with stark-white walls, whitewashed wood-beamed ceilings, and dark wood floors that allows the turquoise ocean to take center stage. The main level features a spacious living room with many doors that open to the ocean-facing deck, as well as a fireplace, multiple seating areas, and an in-wall projector and retractable movie screen. The home is built for entertaining, as there are two dining tables. The spacious kitchen, lined with terrazzo floors, has state-of-the-art appliances, ample storage, a center island, a built-in breakfast nook, and a butler’s pantry with more prep and storage space.\n\nThere’s a wraparound patio that leads to an expansive, sun-drenched pool deck, with loungers, a turf lawn, an ocean-facing pool and hot tub, outdoor kitchen, bar seating, a firepit, and a built-in barbecue. There’s also a pergola and a sound system. There’s beach access via a private staircase, should you want an easy quick dip in the ocean.\n\n“There’s so much outdoor entertainment,” he says. “There’s a beautiful pool on the beach side with a fire pit, not to mention the media room in the living room, so you feel connected to the outdoors.”\n\nTwo bedrooms share a sitting room on the main level, and there are seven en suite bedrooms connected to private terraces on the upper level. The primary suite has its own entry vestibule that leads to a sumptuous bedroom with a fireplace below a tray ceiling, a sitting room/office area, dual walk-in closets, and spa-like bathrooms with pocket doors that open to the terrace. There are picture-perfect views of the ocean at every turn. Along the covered terrace, there are couches and al fresco dining tables for catching sea breezes and watching the sun dip down below the ocean’s horizon.\n\nAdditional amenities include a gym with even more ocean views, plus an outdoor shower, beach bathroom, and state-of-the-art security. And finally, the prime location on Carbon Beach allows easy walkable access to some of Malibu’s most sought-after restaurants, including Soho Beach House and Nobu Malibu."
