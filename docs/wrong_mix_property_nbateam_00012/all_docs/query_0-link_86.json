        "text": "No matter his differences with the owner, Kevin Garnett still has his heart beating for the Minnesota Timberwolves. However, the former NBA star has his love equally divided between two of his former teams — Wolves and Boston Celtics. But what if these two teams were to clash with each other in the NBA Finals?\n\nKevin Garnett faced this question during his appearance on the Stephen A. Smith Show. Some may consider it as a difficult scenario, but KG considers this as an absolute win for him. “That’s a win win for me. I win both ways…” he replied, even showing Celtics and Wolves in a single customized tee. “This is the ultimate gift right here. If Boston and Minnesota make it to the Finals, I know I’ve won, period. And I’m the chairman of the boards of the 50-50 club,” he added.\n\nKG further mentioned he is good in both cities and he even got himself seats in both arenas. His desire to see both the Celtics and Wolves in the Finals is so strong that if he had one wish, he’d use it for this scenario to come true. Although he hilariously excluded the wish of becoming a billionaire.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nNotably, the former NBA star was drafted into the NBA by the Minnesota Timberwolves. He played 14 seasons with the franchise. However, Kevin Garnett also played 6 seasons with the Celtics, and his 2008 NBA championship and Defensive Player of the Year came with the Celtics. But it’s not as if KG did not have any notable accolades with the Wolves. He won his MVP award and became 4x Rebounding Champ with the Wolves. However, as mentioned above, he had a falling out with the franchise after his retirement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nA closer look into Kevin Garnett’s differences with Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor\n\nAs per a recent article by Boston.com, there were speculations about Garnett joining the front-office role with the team after his retirement. However, after the death of former Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders, this plan was dismissed by the franchise’s majority owner, Glen Taylor. Since then, there has been friction between the franchise owner and KG.\n\nSo much so that the 2008 NBA champ has denied the Wolves to retire his jersey as long as Taylor is the majority owner. In fact, as per media reports, there is an ongoing battle between Taylor and two other owners — Alex Rodriguez and Marc Lore — for the majority share. And Kevin Garnett is rooting for Rodriguez and Lore to win.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“What they’ve been doing in Minnesota, the energy, and this team taking on [Anthony Edwards’s] and [Karl-Anthony Towns’s] personality bro, A-Rod and Marc built that [expletive], man… It took Glen Taylor 20 years, and he can’t figure it out…” Garnett said, as per the Boston.com article. But despite these differences with the franchise owner, KG still backs his former team no matter what."
