        "text": "Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kevin Garnett finished second in the NBA's MVP balloting, but because the Timberwolves have never won a playoff series and because there's only a year left on Garnett's $126 million contract, there's been speculation that he may be playing elsewhere by next season.\n\nWhichever team is paying the balance of K.G.'s mammoth playing contract, he'll be wearing a different brand of sneakers. Next season would be the fourth of a six-year deal that's been earning Garnett about $2 million per annum, but sources said the 27-year-old superstar is in the midst of a messy divorce from And 1.\n\nBoth And 1 and Andy Miller, Garnett's agent, are tight-lipped about what's going on. Sources said they are under an arrangement that has them close-mouthed until August to give And 1 time to sell off its supply of K.G. product. Some of the bigger sites, like eastbay.com, were discounting K.G. kicks as much 33 percent last week.\n\nWhy the breakup?\n\nK.G. split with Nike in 2000 after five years, thinking a smaller company would be more likely to feature him. Now, insiders say, he's heading back to a large sneaker and apparel company, most likely Adidas, in search of the same star treatment.\n\nWouldn't Adidas' reliance on Tracy McGrady, one of the few players whose name actually sells shoes, preclude that?\n\nStay tuned. Meanwhile, And 1 is left with a stable that includes Ben Wallace, Chauncey Billups and Stephon Marbury, a former Garnett teammate who had his own messy breakup with And 1 back in 1998 but returned as an endorser last year.\n\nWhile Nike and Wieden & Kennedy have produced most of the memorable sneaker spots in our lifetime, we'll fondly remember two spots in particular from K.G.'s tenure with And 1: a dreamlike biographical ad from Fallon, even if it was more of an homage to Garnett than a sneaker ad, and last year's \"interrogation\" spot, loosely based on a similar scene from the movie \"Scarface.\"\n\nSEARS DOESN'T HAVE EVERYTHING: The seventh WNBA season is under way without a familiar face. Sears has quietly dropped its WNBA sponsorship after six years.\n\nAs an original sponsor of the distaff basketball league, Sears paired its affiliation with the National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations and its WNBA sponsorship, producing promotions that targeted its archetypal 40-plus female shopper customer base.\n\nOther fund-raising activities for what was the WNBA's official department and discount store included auctions at the WNBA All-Star Game and title rights to a celebrity basketball game promoting breast health awareness.\n\nSears has pared much of its sports and music sponsorships in recent years. It renewed the title sponsorship of NASCAR's truck-racing circuit for an additional five years in 2000 but jettisoned its well-executed \"Champions Program\" last year, which included the sponsorship of many college trophies, awards and scholarships.\n\nThe company also just renewed its Craftsman brand's sponsorship as the official tool of the NHRA.\n\nOther WNBA sponsors failing to renew for this season were Yahoo!, AIG VALIC, which had the financial services category (outside of payment cards) since 2000, and L'Oréal, which had category rights for hair-care products and cosmetics since 1998. (NBA officials insist they are still in talks with L'Oréal.)\n\nThe WNBA now has five charter sponsors left: Nike, American Express, Anheuser-Busch for Bud Light, General Motors for its Chevrolet brand and Coke (which took the 1999 season \"off\") for Dasani bottled water and Diet Coke.\n\nBARRY'S BAUBLES: Even more than four years after his untimely retirement, there's still a business in being Barry Sanders. With the NFL's No. 3 all-time rusher eligible to be voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame for 2004 enshrinement (along with John Elway), a number of new deals have been signed by Pro Access, Miami, which is seeking licensees and sponsors under a recently established Barry Sanders Inc. organization.\n\nA still-developing affiliation with NFL Films and ESPN will result in a number of media extensions, including a \"Sports Century\" episode on Sanders and another ESPN show. A coffee table book and DVD are likely as well.\n\nThere's also new memorabilia and licensing deals. Schwartz Sports, Chicago extended its memorabilia deal for a year in a mid-six-figure deal to produce Hall-of-Fame-embossed products once Sanders is elected. Russell Athletic signed a nonexclusive to produce Sanders/Oklahoma State replica jerseys. Game Time Promotions will market authentic Oklahoma State jerseys.\n\nAnother nonexclusive sees Reebok making throwback Detroit Lions jerseys, T-shirts and caps with Sanders' name. Upper Deck, Topps and Playoff have signed to produce Sanders trading cards and will have signed cards randomly inserted into packs."
