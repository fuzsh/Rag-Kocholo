        "text": "This has been a strange and confusing season in the NBA, with plenty of surprises and no clear front-runner.\n\nNow, throw Kevin Garnett’s emotional return to the Minnesota Timberwolves into that entertaining mix.\n\nOn top of watching the Celtics lose every veteran to a trade or injury only to keep getting better, it’s been fascinating to watch how some former Celtics heroes have done outside of Boston.\n\nPaul Pierce has been doing what he can to bring some veteran toughness to the upstart Washington Wizards while they work through growing pains. Meanwhile Rajon Rondo and the Dallas Mavericks seem stuck in an already doomed short-term relationship.\n\nBut one of the sadder sagas is over. At the trade deadline, the Brooklyn Nets dealt Garnett back to Minnesota for Thaddeus Young, freeing Garnett from a troubled team with no clear plan.\n\n\"If you have a story, this is a fairy tale,” Garnett said when he was reintroduced with the Timberwolves. “This is a perfect ending to it. This is how you want to do it.\n\n“I figure if LeBron can go home, then (expletive) it, why can’t I?”\n\nIn the short term, the Timberwolves are hoping Garnett’s near-insane intensity can rub off in a positive way on Andrew Wiggins, Ricky Rubio and Zack LaVine. His new teammates have heard stories of KG throwing players’ phones in the toilet and have already witnessed him screaming for tempo in practice and on the sidelines.\n\nHe’ll likely be in Minnesota a little past this season, too, playing out a little longer before moving into the front office and perhaps into an ownership situation.\n\nRegardless, this move gets one of the best players the game has ever seen out of a disaster in New York.\n\nTo call Brooklyn dysfunctional is to miss the point that there’s never really been any kind of plan. Ownership wanted to make a splash in a new arena in hipster mecca, so they cashed in draft picks and contract years for a hodge-podge of stars. They then gave the reigns to a first year coach with name recognition and hoped it would be good enough to embarrass the Knicks and maybe win a title.\n\nThe Knicks didn’t need any help on their end, obviously. But the Nets were thrown together haphazardly, even by short-minded NBA standards. There was lots of talent on the roster, no realistic path to success and no direction home.\n\nIn the offseason, Pierce left for Washington and coach Jason Kidd bailed for Milwaukee. Meanwhile, a roster centered around Garnett, Deron Williams and Joe Johnson continued to struggle with injuries and dimming expectations.\n\nRight now, the Nets are struggling for the last playoff spot in the East, and that would’ve been the case with or without Garnett, battling through another rough season that’s practically a carbon copy of his per-game totals from 2013-14.\n\nSo the Nets get a player in Young who hasn’t lived up to expectations, and Garnett trades one struggling franchise for another in Minnesota.\n\nLooking at it quickly, it doesn’t look great for him. Teams don’t stay bad for 25 years by accident, and it’s hard to imagine a happy ending for Garnett in the standings.\n\nBut this is still a better ending than he would’ve otherwise received. Gone is the confusion and tire-spinning in Brooklyn, and in its place, a hero’s welcome and a chance to teach one more lesson.\n\nWhether or not this trade works out for either team on the court, Garnett gets a result his career deserves.\n\nNick Tavares' column appears Sundays in The Standard-Times."
