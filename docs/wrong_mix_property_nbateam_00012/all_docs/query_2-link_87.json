        "text": "Six seasons and one championship were more than enough for Kevin Garnett to have his No. 5 retired by the Boston Celtics.\n\nGarnett is still best known for his days with the Minnesota Timberwolves, of course, where he spent the first 12 seasons of his career. It's easy to forget that Garnett also finished his career with Minnesota, after the Brooklyn Nets traded him back to where it all began midway through the 2014-15 season.\n\nGarnett spent one final season with the T'Wolves in 2015-16, his 21st in the NBA, making one last stop in Boston along the way. He didn't play in the game, a 113-99 win for the Celtics on Dec. 21, 2015, but could still be seen making the rounds about TD Garden, chatting it up with team owner Wyc Grousbeck, radio analyst Cedric Maxwell and Avery Bradley, the only member of Boston's roster at that point who'd played with Garnett.\n\nForsberg: Breaking down the Isaiah Thomas conundrum\n\n\"Boston's always had a special place in my heart and it probably always will,\" Garnett said after the game. \"Tonight wasn't the outcome the way I wanted it to be, but it was a great homecoming. It felt really good to be in the building.\n\n\"The love is unconditional and I'm very appreciative of it.\"\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins combined for 51 points for Minnesota in the loss. Kelly Olynyk led the Celtics with 19 points. Marcus Smart, the only member of the C's still with the organization, missed the game due to a leg injury.\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nThe final game Garnett actually appeared in as a visitor at the TD Garden was on Dec. 26, 2014 as a member of the Nets, scoring six points in a 109-107 win for Brooklyn. Jeff Green, a one-time teammate of KG's with the Celtics, led Boston with 22 points while Smart, then a rookie, had five points, six assists and four steals for the Green."
