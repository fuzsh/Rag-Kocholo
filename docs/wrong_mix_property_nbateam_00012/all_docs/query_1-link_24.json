        "text": "There was a definite sign of things to come during his welcome-to-Boston press conference on July 31, 2007.\n\nAs Kevin Garnett held up a Celtics’ jersey and posed for pictures with new teammates Paul Pierce and Ray Allen at the TD Garden, he was obviously full of energy, bouncing on one foot and then the other.\n\nFor the next six seasons, that excess energy was on full display while Garnett played for the Celtics.\n\n“This is my mark, if you will, my style,’’ Garnett would say during his time with the Celtics. “It’s what I’m accustomed to. I don’t see me changing any time soon.\n\nI think you lock in how you lock in.\n\n“My focus is very exact. The energy that I have is something I’ve never paid attention to. I just know I have it.’’\n\nThat energy and the basketball talent Garnett possessed helped bring the Celtics their first championship in 22 years in 2008 followed by a near-miss two years later, a Game 7 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nGarnett, after playing 12 seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves, brought passion to the Celtics and changed the culture of an organization that had won only three playoff series in 15 years following the retirement of Larry Bird.\n\nWhen it was time to rebuild, Garnett and Pierce were traded to the Brooklyn Nets in 2013, and now, at the age of 40, the player known for his unselfishness is retiring.\n\nRather than report to the Timberwolves for a 20th season, Garnett agreed to a buyout of his contract Friday and is walking away from the NBA, a league he joined in 1995 as a a teenager.\n\nGarnett will now join Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan as first-ballot Basketball Hall of Fame inductees in Springfield in 2021.\n\nAlthough he spent around one-third of his career in Boston, Garnett will always have a special place in his heart for his time with the Celtics.\n\nFrustrated at not being able to contend for a title in Minnesota, Garnett agreed to be traded to the Celtics and became an instant fan favorite for his ferociousness on the court and leadership.\n\nHe delivered a championship and will never be forgotten for the way he went about his business.\n\n“He’s a great person, great guy in the locker room, the most unselfish superstar I’ve ever been around,’’ said his Celtics coach, Doc Rivers, in 2008. “I don’t know if there’s other guys – maybe Ray Lewis comes to mind in football.\n\n“But it’s all about his team. He literally loves his team and he literally does not like the other team.\n\n“He’s amazing. He really is. He’s just a different breed. They don’t make them like him.’’\n\nGarnett played 396 games for the Celtics, averaging 15.7 points and 8.3 rebounds.\n\nIt was never about numbers for Garnett, who relished playing defense and being the best teammate that he could possible be.\n\nWatching Garnett after he left the Celtics and played for the Nets and the Timberwolves was not a pretty sight. The toll of so many games in so many seasons caught up with Garnett and he was just another player.\n\nBefore that ending to his career, though, Garnett had six seasons in Boston that helped him get over all the frustration he had felt in Minnesota.\n\nGarnett truly enjoyed being a part of the Celtics and having such a key role in returning them back to the top of the NBA.\n\nWho will ever forget Garnett banging his head into the basketball support every game before lining up for the tipoff?\n\nOr yelling, “Anything’s possible’’ into a microphone while on the floor during the championship celebration after the Lakers were defeated in ’08?\n\nThe following season, the Celtics and Garnett were rolling along, and it looked like a repeat might be in the cards. But during a game on a western swing in February, Garnett injured his knee and the season of promise wound up ending early in the playoffs.\n\nOne title and a lot of good times is what Garnett, a special player, helped deliver here.\n\n“Every coach,’’ said Rivers, “should have the opportunity to coach Kevin Garnett.’’\n\nJim Fenton may be reached at jfenton@enterprisenews.com.
