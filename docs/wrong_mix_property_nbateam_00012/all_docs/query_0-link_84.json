Three-time winner Rudy Gobert finished third with 136 total points.\n\nThe votes were compiled from a global panel of 100 sportswriters and broadcasters.\n\nPlayers were awarded five points for each first-place vote, three points for each second-place vote and one point for each third-place vote.\n\nSmart becomes the first guard to win the award since Gary Payton in 1995-96 and the first Celtic since Kevin Garnett in 2007-08.\n\nIt's only fitting that GP surprised Smart at Celtics practice today to present him the award.\n\n\"That was awesome,\" Smart said on TNT on having Payton deliver the award.\n\n\"He was really the idol for the guards having even a chance, he set the bar high, he paved the way for us to have our names in that hat.\"\n\nSmart played a pivotal role as the leader of the Celtics' league-best defense this season as they posted a defensive rating of 106.2 and allowed the fewest points per game (104.5). They also held opponents to the lowest field goal percentage (43.4) and 3-point field goal percentage (33.9).\n\nStarting 71 games this season, Smart posted averages of 12.1 points, a career-high 5.9 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 1.7 steals in 32.3 minutes per game.\n\nThe 28-year-old finished the season ranked 11th in steals per game and tied for sixth in total steals (119). He was also among the league leaders in several hustle stats, tied for fourth in the NBA in loose balls recovered (75) and tied for 10th in both deflections (206) and charges drawn (16).\n\nNBA Defensive Player of the Year winners"
