        "text": "Kevin Garnett believes that Anthony Davis will win the NBA’s Most Valuable Player award by 2025. The former Boston Celtic conveyed on Showtime's Ticket and The Truth podcast that Davis is of the same caliber as Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid.\n\n“I’m expecting Anthony Davis to be MVP in these next two years … it’s time, it’s time, you can’t let Joker [Nikola Jokic] come in the league and surpass [you],” Garnett said. “Anthony Davis can do everything they can do. Anthony Davis can do everything Joker can do, he can do everything Embiid can do. … I’m expecting him to be MVP if not this year, definitely next year.”\n\nFor the 2022-2023 regular season, Davis averaged 25.9 points and 12.5 rebounds over 56 games. Davis’ Los Angeles Lakers reached the Western Conference Finals, where they were defeated by the Denver Nuggets after four games.\n\nIn April, the NBA approved a new stipulation that players must play in a minimum of 65 games to be eligible for postseason awards. Davis hasn’t fulfilled this criterion since 2018.\n\nThe 30-year-old recently agreed to a three-year, $186 million contract extension. As one of the league's top-paid players, Davis will be held to high expectations next season.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nRick Barry Discusses Jaylen Brown's Record-Breaking Contract Extension, Kristaps Porzingis Trade, Two Suggested Superstar Additions for Boston Celtics, Who's Face of the NBA\n\nNew Details Emerge About Celtics Regular-Season Schedule\n\nLatvian Basketball Association Denies Report on Kristaps Porzingis’ Foot Injury\n\nExamining How Celtics' Starting Lineup Might Shapeshift This Season\n\nWeighing Whether Celtics Should Sign Kelly Oubre\n\nWyc Grousbeck Reacts to Possibility of Selling Boston Celtics\n\nDwyane Wade Discusses Jayson Tatum's Next Step, Him and Jaylen Brown's Challenge, Heat Culture, Pat Riley, Damian Lillard, and Life After Basketball\n\nDerrick White on Signing Extension with Celtics: 'I Love Being Here in Boston'\n\nJaylen Brown Doesn't Want Celtics' Defensive Identity to 'Go Out the Door' With Marcus Smart\n\nWhy Celtics Should Enter 2023-24 Season Optimistic About Most Important Area of Improvement"
