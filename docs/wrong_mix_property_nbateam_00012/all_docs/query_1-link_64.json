        "text": "Kevin Garnett says he likes the older him. He’s no longer one of the most vitriolic trash talkers in NBA history, at least where fitting into civilian life is concerned. He’s learned to keep his game temperament tucked away, he says.\n\n“I’ve been put the Hulk in the closet, man,” Garnett said Thursday during a conference call with Boston media. “The monster’s under the bed, three or four slugs to the head. I’ve been put the monster under the bed.\n\n“Yeah, I haven’t reached into that bag of intensity for a while. I’m a lot older. I like to be a lot more chill these days. I’m a little more patient. All the things I didn’t have when I was younger. But yeah, I can’t say that and say I wouldn’t be lying to you if I wasn’t passionate about a lot of the stuff that I’m into and expressing it sometimes when I come in. Every time I jumped on the court and messed around, some of it leaks out here and there.\n\n“But I can’t say it’s been like the old days. I’ve definitely grown, I’m definitely calmed down a lot more. And yeah, I liked the older me, you know? I liked the older me. But yeah, there’s a time and place for everything.”\n\nAnd next month, the Garden faithful has a long-awaited chance to honor Garnett properly, when No. 5 will be retired during a March 13 game against Dallas.\n\nHe’s imagined the moment, not entirely consciously, since he first stepped into the Celtics’ former workout facility in Waltham, and noticed the original championship banners hanging up on the wall, and since he started gazing up at the king-sized sheets containing the numbers of his predecessors. Garnett will be the 24th entity retired up there, along with 21 other players in addition to Red Auerbach and owner Walter Brown.\n\n“You know, when you sit there and you go through the national anthem, I used to always do a couple things. I used to always beat my chest to the crowd, let them know that my heart was in it. That’s what that meant,” he said. “I used to always bang my head, because banging the head on the back support would say I would do anything in this game and I would bang my head here, so that was that.\n\n“And I would always, during the pledge of allegiance, I would always look up for the first part of coming out. If you ever seen me suit up, come out and all the guys got to line up, I would always look up, and that was my inspiration. That was my driving force. When I came to Boston, I wanted to be a player that was remembered for playing in Boston. And I went out every night that I suited up, and I played like that.”\n\nThe ritual continued in Waltham, where a blank banner hung next to the real ones prior to the 2008 championship, with a light shining on it.\n\n“Every morning I would come into practice and I would look up at the banners and I would just look at them and I would go through each one, and before we had our own I would look at the light,” he said. “Doc (Rivers) used to put a bright light on the space that had no banner, and I used to stare at that. I can say that retired numbers on top and the banners was my driving force, even when I didn’t play with Boston. When I played with Minnesota, if you go back and look at the video, I would stare at the numbers up there.\n\n“Talking to Bill Russell made me even more immersed in history, and made me … man, I was just so inspired even more from talking to the older players. Jo Jo White, rest in peace. When the players would come in I would love listening to them and listening to their journey, because it was all inspirational. So I was glad I had that. Real talk. I was glad I had that to push me, and I can sit here and say I’m here. I’m honored. And I just want to thank the Celtics organization for recognizing me in this manner, and it should be a fun night, man. I’m looking forward to it.”\n\nGarnett talked at length about the standard he set for teammates, and raising the bar to a level he considered necessary to win the first Celtics title in 22 years. Little wonder that Garnett bonded with the Garden crowd almost immediately.\n\n“I’m a historian of basketball and I have never ever in my life cheated the game,” he said. “I have never went at the game with nothing less than 100%. I heard Larry Bird say one time in his early years in Boston is that the reason why he loved playing in front of the fans in Boston is because you couldn’t fake them. You couldn’t fool the fans. They knew when you was playing hard. They knew when you were giving your all.\n\n“They have a sense of basketball history and they have high basketball IQs. They cared and I never forgot that. So much that when I was coming to Boston, I was talking to Antoine Walker and he obviously had some experiences. Not just with playing in Boston, but playing and having success and then not having success. And that advice he gave me was some of the best advice, along with the Larry Bird statement. After having those conversations, I told myself that I probably won’t be the best player on the court every night, but I’m going to play like it and I’m going to give 1,000% of effort like I’ve always done. But I wanted to be able to show people that I can play through injury.\n\n“I wanted to show them, plus teammates and coaching staff, I wanted them to see that I can play through damn near anything, that I was mentally strong, I had some endurance that I worked really hard, I really worked on my craft. I had stamina, I could play for long periods of time and I played both ends. I was very prideful in that approach.\n\n“I think that resonated with the city. Fans, when they saw me, I would like to think that they saw a person that was playing hard and giving his all. And as a player, that’s all you can ask of yourself. As fans watch you play, you can only give what you can give at the rate that you can give it. So I thought that I played the game at a high rate and a high velocity and I wanted to always play on that temperature.\n\n“I never wanted to come in and be cool, I didn’t want to be calm. I wanted to be under control, but I wanted to be electric. I wanted to win every game and I wanted everybody who I was playing against to know that. I guess the fans resonated with that and to this day, fans come up to me, they dap me, they express their appreciation for hard work and passion. At the end of the day, man, that’s all you can ask for, man. So I’m grateful for that. But that’s what I think is the connection between me and the fans or I would say they connected with me from Day One of stepping on the court.”"
