        "text": "Kevin Garnett will finally be immortalized as just the latest Hall of Famer whose jersey number will hang in the Garden rafters. That No. 5 jersey ceremony is still more than a month away, set for March 13, but Garnett reminisced on his time in Boston on Thursday, including winning the 2008 NBA title.\n\nWhile Garnett is a beloved figure in Boston, in reality, he only spent six seasons in the green and white. His most notable individual achievements came when he was with the Timberwolves, where he played parts of 14 seasons. But as Garnett noted ahead of his Hall of Fame induction, Celtics fans hold a special place in his mind.\n\nGarnett said he “never, ever in my life cheated the game” — and he thought that’s where Boston fans appreciated him the most. While Garnett said he likely won’t be the best player on the court every night, he could, at minimum, give “1000%” of his effort on a nightly basis. There’s a reason Garnett said the only regret from his NBA career was not getting to Boston sooner.\n\n“I heard Larry Bird say one time in his early years in Boston is that the reason why he loved playing in front of the fans in Boston is because you couldn’t fake them,” Garnett said. “You couldn’t fool the fans. They knew when you was playing hard. They knew when you were giving your all. They have a sense of basketball history and they have high basketball IQs. They cared and I never forgot that.”\n\nGarnett got plenty of input from other sources when he was traded from Minnesota to Boston during that fateful 2007 offseason. He said he reached out to Antoine Walker, the longtime Celtic, about his time in Boston and what Garnett could expect. The advice wasn’t just about the good times, Garnett said, but also on when the team struggled during Walker’s tenure.\n\nThere was a unique vigor to Garnett’s game during his playing days. That intensity level certainly didn’t make many friends on the court, but he was beloved by the Celtics faithful from 2007-13. He said he though that approach “resonated” with the city — the victories certainly didn’t hurt either.\n\n“I wanted to be able to show people that I can play through injury,” Garnett said. “I wanted to show them — plus teammates and coaching staff — I wanted them to see that I can play through damn near anything, that I was mentally strong. I had some endurance that I worked really hard. I really worked on my craft. I had stamina, I could play for long periods of time and I played both ends. I was very prideful in that approach.”\n\nGarnett has time and again looked back fondly during his six seasons in Boston. While his injury during the 2009 playoffs limited the team’s ceiling, the Celtics still had deep playoff runs after nabbing their lone title. That 2008 championship remains as Garnett’s lone ring in his career, teaming up with the likes of Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo, Doc Rivers and others.\n\nThe accolades are starting to pile up for Garnett, considered one of the greatest power forwards of all time. His style was ahead of his time, and his impact on basketball history is undeniable. Garnett was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as part of the 2020 class. And there will be plenty of other great memories for the basketball legend, which includes his upcoming jersey retirement.\n\n“I never wanted to come in and be cool, I didn’t want to be calm,” Garnett said. “I wanted to be under control, but I wanted to be electric. I wanted to win every game and I wanted everybody who I was playing against to know that. I guess the fans resonated with that and to this day, fans come up to me, they dap me, they express their appreciation for hard work and passion.”"
