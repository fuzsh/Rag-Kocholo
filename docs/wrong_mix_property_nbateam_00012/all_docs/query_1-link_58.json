        "text": "American basketball player (born 1988)\n\nNot to be confused with Kevin Durand.\n\nKevin Wayne Durant ( də-RANT; born September 29, 1988), also known by his initials KD, is an American professional basketball player for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history,[1][2][3][4] Durant has won two NBA championships, an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, two Finals MVP Awards, two NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Awards, four NBA scoring titles, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, been named to 11 All-NBA teams (including six First Teams), and selected 14 times as an NBA All-Star. In 2021, Durant was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[5] As a member of the U.S. men's national team, Durant has won three gold medals in the Olympics (2012, 2016, and 2020) and is the leading scorer in Team USA's men's Olympic basketball history. He also won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship.\n\nDurant was a heavily recruited high school prospect widely regarded as the second-best player in his class. He played one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns, where he won numerous year-end awards and became the first freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year. Durant was selected as the second overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft. He played nine seasons with the franchise, which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008, before signing with the Golden State Warriors in 2016, winning consecutive NBA championships and NBA Finals MVP Awards in 2017 and 2018. After sustaining an Achilles injury in the 2019 NBA Finals, Durant joined the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent that summer. Following disagreements with the Nets' front office, he requested a trade during the 2022 offseason and was traded to the Suns the following year.\n\nOff the court, Durant is one of the highest-earning basketball players in the world, due in part to endorsement deals with companies such as Foot Locker and Nike. He has developed a reputation for philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In 2018, Durant was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world. In recent years, he has contributed to The Players' Tribune as both a photographer and writer. In 2012, Durant ventured into acting, appearing in the film Thunderstruck.\n\nEarly life\n\nDurant was born on September 29, 1988, in Washington, D.C.,[6] to Wanda (née Durant) and Wayne Pratt. When Durant was an infant, his father deserted the family; Wanda and Wayne eventually divorced, and Durant's grandmother, Barbara Davis, helped raise him. By age 13, Durant's father reentered his life and traveled the country with him to basketball tournaments.[7][8] Durant has a sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne.[9]\n\nDurant and his siblings grew up in Prince George's County, Maryland, on the eastern outskirts of Washington, D.C.[10] He was unusually tall from a young age, and reached 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) in height while still in middle school (age 10–12).[11] Growing up, Durant wanted to play for his favorite team, the Toronto Raptors,[12] which included his favorite player, Vince Carter.[12] Durant played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for several teams in the Maryland area and was teammates with future NBA players Michael Beasley, Greivis Vásquez, and Ty Lawson, the first of whom Durant remains friends with to this day.[13] [14] During this time, he began wearing #35 as his jersey number in honor of his AAU coach, Charles Craig, who was murdered at the age of 35.[15]\n\nAfter playing two years of high school basketball at National Christian Academy and one year at Oak Hill Academy, Durant transferred to Montrose Christian School for his senior year, growing 5 inches (13 cm) before the start of the season and beginning the year at 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m).[16]\n\nPrior to the start of the season, Durant committed to the University of Texas at Austin.[17] He had visited University of Connecticut and University of North Carolina, and said that he considered Duke University, University of Kentucky and University of Louisville. When Durant was asked why he chose a college with a lesser-known program, Durant said, \"Wanted to set my own path.\"[18]\n\nAt the end of the year, Durant was named the Washington Post All-Met Basketball Player of the Year, as well as the Most Valuable Player of the 2006 McDonald's All-American Game.[19][20] He was widely regarded as the second-best high school prospect of 2006, behind Greg Oden.[21][22][23]\n\nDurant had stated that he would have declared for the 2006 NBA draft if the NBA had not introduced the one-and-done rule, where his favorite team growing up, the Toronto Raptors, had the first overall pick.[24][25]\n\nCollege career\n\nFor the 2006–07 college season, Durant—who had grown to 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)—averaged 25.8 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game for the Texas Longhorns.[6] Texas finished the season with a 25–10 record overall and a 12–4 record in conference.[26] Awarded a #4 seed in the NCAA Tournament, Texas won its first round match-up against New Mexico State but was upset in the second round by USC despite a 30-point and 9-rebound performance from Durant.[27] For his outstanding play, Durant was recognized as the unanimous national player of the year, winning the John R. Wooden Award,[28] the Naismith College Player of the Year Award,[29] and all eight other widely recognized honors and awards.[30][31][32][33][34][35] This made Durant the first freshman to win any of the national player of the year awards.[36] Following the season, he declared for the NBA draft.[37] Durant's No. 35 jersey was later retired by the Longhorns.[38]\n\nProfessional career\n\nSeattle SuperSonics / Oklahoma City Thunder (2007–2016)\n\nRookie of the Year (2007–2008)\n\nDurant was selected as the second overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics, after Greg Oden was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the first pick of the draft.[39] In his first regular season game, the 19-year-old Durant registered 18 points, five rebounds, and three steals against the Denver Nuggets.[40] On November 16, he made the first game-winning shot of his career in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.[41]\n\nAt the end of the 2007–08 NBA season, Durant was named the NBA Rookie of the Year following averages of 20.3 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game.[6] He joined Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James as the only teenagers in league history to average at least 20 points per game over an entire season.[42]\n\nBreakthrough (2008–2010)\n\nFollowing Durant's rookie season, the Supersonics relocated to Oklahoma City, becoming the Thunder and switching to new colors – blue, orange, and yellow.[43] The team also drafted UCLA guard Russell Westbrook, who would form an All-Star combination with Durant in later years.[44] At the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend, he set a Rookie Challenge record with 46 points.[45] By the end of the 2008–09 NBA season, Durant had raised his scoring average by five points from the prior season to 25.3 points per game,[6] and was considered a strong candidate for the Most Improved Player Award, eventually finishing third in the voting.[46] Durant continued to grow during his first few years in the NBA, finally reaching a height of 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m).[47]\n\nDuring the 2009–10 season, Durant was selected to his first NBA All-Star Game.[6] Behind his play, the Thunder improved their record by 27 wins from the previous year and defied expectations to make the playoffs.[48][49] With a scoring average of 30.1 points per game, Durant became the youngest NBA scoring champion and was selected to his first All-NBA team.[6][50] In his playoff debut, Durant scored 24 points in a Game 1 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.[51] Oklahoma City would go on to lose the series in six games,[52] but the team's performance led many analysts to label them as an upcoming title contender.[53]\n\nFirst NBA finals (2010–2012)\n\nPrior to the start of the 2010–11 season, Durant announced via Twitter that he had signed a five-year contract extension with the Thunder worth approximately $86 million.[54][55] For the second consecutive year, Durant led the NBA in scoring, averaging 27.7 points a game.[56] Behind his leadership, the Thunder won 55 games and earned the fourth seed in the Western Conference.[57] In the 2011 NBA playoffs, Oklahoma City defeated the Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies en route to a Conference Finals match-up against the Dallas Mavericks, losing in five games.[58]\n\nOn February 19 of the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, Durant recorded his first career 50-point game, scoring 51 points against the Denver Nuggets.[59][60] At the All-Star Game, he scored 36 points and was awarded the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award.[61] Durant finished the year with a scoring average of 28 points per game, representing his third straight scoring title.[62] Behind his play, the Thunder won 47 games and entered the 2012 NBA playoffs as the Western Conference's second seed.[63] In Game 1 of the first round against the Dallas Mavericks, Durant hit a game-winner with 1.5 seconds remaining.[64] Oklahoma City would go on to defeat Dallas 4–0, the Lakers 4–1, and the San Antonio Spurs 4–2 before losing to the Miami Heat 1–4 in the 2012 NBA Finals.[65] For the NBA Finals, Durant led all players with 30.6 points per game, doing so on a 54.8 shooting rate.[66]\n\n50–40–90 season (2012–2013)\n\nWith a scoring average of 28.1 points per game to finish the 2012–13 season, Durant failed to defend his scoring title;

Durant is also one of just four U.S. male basketball athletes to play in three or more Olympics.[254][255] In recognition of his accomplishments in the tournament, Durant was named 2021 USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year for the third time in his career.[256]\n\nFrom 2010 to 2021, Durant played with the senior men's United States national team in 31 official games, in major FIBA tournaments, averaging 20.4 points, 5.4 rebounds and 3.1 assists. Overall, he brought home four gold medals as member of the national team: three from Olympic tournaments and one from the 2010 FIBA World Championship.[257] Durant, who has led the US in scoring in all three of his Olympic appearances and at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, owns eight U.S. Olympic men's career records, including the top spot for points (435), points averaged (19.8), field goals made (146) and attempted (276), 3-point field goals made (74) and attempted (148) and free throws made (69) and attempted (80).[258]\n\nPlayer profile\n\nDurant's height is officially listed as 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) and his primary position is small forward. In December 2016, Durant stated that his height in shoes was actually 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m) and that he understated his height in order to be listed as a small forward, rather than a power forward.[259] Durant's career averages are 27.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game.[6] Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,[260][261][262][263] Durant has earned All-NBA honors 11 times (2010–2014, 2016–2019, 2022, 2024) and was voted rookie of the year in his debut season.[6] He has also won an MVP Award and finished second in the voting thrice, a trend that he has expressed frustration over.[264][265][266][267]\n\nDurant is best known for his prodigious scoring ability.[268] From 2010 to 2014, he won four scoring titles, becoming one of only two players to win four scoring titles in a five-year span.[269] Early in his career, his playing style was isolation-driven, but Durant quickly developed into an excellent off-ball player who was capable of scoring from the outside as well.[270] By 2013, he was shooting at a historically great clip, which helped him become one of only nine members of the 50–40–90 club.[271] This ability to impact the offense in a variety of ways helped Durant remain effective and improve an already elite offense upon joining the Warriors in 2016.[270] Throughout his career, Durant's height and 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) wingspan have created matchup problems for defenses as he is able to get off a clean shot regardless of the situation.[272][273] Upon beating his man or gaining momentum, Durant also becomes a strong finisher at the rim; for example, he converted 72.2% of shots in the paint in 2012.[268]\n\nEarly in Durant's career, he was criticized for his slim build, defense, and passing.[274] Over time, Durant grew as a playmaker, increasing his assist numbers every year from 2010 to 2014,[272] though his overall vision still lagged behind the league's best passers'.[270] Durant also showed defensive improvement, with opponents averaging just .62 points per isolation play against him in 2014, the best success rate for defensive players who faced at least 100 isolations that season.[275] Upon going to Golden State, Durant developed into a more reliable off-ball defender and rim protector, and in 2018 was considered for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.[276]\n\nPersonal life\n\nDurant is very close with his mother, Wanda, a relationship that was detailed in the Lifetime movie The Real MVP: The Wanda Durant Story.[277] During his time with the Thunder, Durant described himself as a \"high school kid\" who enjoys playing video games in his spare time.[278] Durant is a Christian who attended Baptist schools.[279][280] He has religious tattoos on his stomach,[281] wrist,[279] and back.[282] Durant owns several properties in the Oklahoma City area and listed his primary residence, located in the affluent Club Villa neighborhood, for sale for $1.95 million in 2013.[283] That same year, Durant opened a restaurant, KD's Southern Cuisine, in the Bricktown neighborhood and briefly became engaged to Monica Wright, a WNBA player.[284][285][286] In 2016, Durant was a credentialed photographer for The Players' Tribune at Super Bowl 50.[287][288]\n\nDurant was formerly represented by agents Aaron Goodwin and Rob Pelinka.[289][290] He left Pelinka in 2013 and signed with the Roc Nation group, headed by Jay-Z.[290][291] Durant has endorsement deals with Nike, Sprint, Gatorade, Panini, General Electric, and 2K Sports.[292] In 2012, he tried his hand at acting, appearing in the children's film Thunderstruck.[293] In 2013, Durant earned $35 million, making him the fourth-highest-earning basketball player that year.[294] In an interview with Sports Illustrated, Durant claimed that, despite his high earnings potential, \"global marketing and all that stuff\" does not interest him.[292]\n\nOne of the most popular players in the NBA, Durant's jersey regularly ranks as one of the league's best-selling and he is consistently one of the top All-Star vote-getters.[295][296] Early in his career, Durant developed a reputation for his kind demeanor; in 2013, Foot Locker released a series of commercials calling him the \"nicest guy in the NBA\",[297] and become a beloved figure in Oklahoma City, known for his \"nice escapades\" toward the Thunder's staff.[298] In 2014, Durant partnered with KIND snacks and launched StrongAndKind.com to show \"being kind is not a sign of weakness.\"[299] Since leaving the Thunder, Durant has become more outspoken and controversial; for example, he was involved in a Twitter back-and-forth with CJ McCollum in July 2018.[300] Durant has admitted to feeling more genuine in Golden State as opposed to Oklahoma City, where he was \"just trying to please everybody.\"[301] Durant is very active on Twitter,[302] often engaging in chippy comments with fans and members of the media.[303]\n\nThroughout his career, Durant has participated in philanthropic causes. In 2013, he pledged $1 million to the American Red Cross for the victims of the 2013 Moore tornado.[304] Durant's generosity inspired the Thunder and Nike to match his donation.[305] Durant is also a spokesperson for the Washington, D. C. branch of P'Tones Records, a nationwide non-profit after-school music program.[306]\n\nIn 2017, Durant became involved with YouTube. In February, he visited YouTube's headquarters for a speaking engagement.[307] On April 7, 2017, Durant created a YouTube account and soon began to upload live stream vlogs onto it.[308][309] In his first vlog, Durant detailed, \"I'm so excited because I got off social media. I got off the Instagram, Twitter, all that stuff, just to distance myself a bit. But somebody talked me into getting on the YouTube.\"[309] As of June 2020, Durant's YouTube channel has received over 790,000 subscribers and 38 million video views.[308] On February 13, 2018, Deadline reported that Durant, in partnership with producer Brian Grazer's Imagine Television, will create a basketball-themed scripted drama for Apple.[310]\n\nIn 2017, Durant and business partner Rich Kleiman founded Thirty Five Ventures.[311][312][313][314] In 2020, Thirty Five Ventures produced Basketball County, a documentary about youth basketball in Durant's home county of Prince George's County, Maryland. Durant served as an executive producer and appeared in interviews.[315] Thirty Five Ventures' work Two Distant Strangers won the 2021 Academy Award for Short Film (Live Action).[316][317]\n\nDurant was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018.[318]\n\nOn June 15, 2020, Durant became a minority owner of MLS side Philadelphia Union, acquiring a 5% stake with the possibility to add another 5% in the near future.[319]\n\nIn August 2021, Durant announced a partnership between his multimedia company Boardroom and the cannabis technology company Weedmaps through which an original content series would be developed and Weedmaps would become an official sponsor of Boardroom.[320][321] Durant said of the partnership: \"I think it's far past time to address the stigmas around cannabis that still exist in the sports world as well as globally. This partnership is going to help us continue to normalize those conversations, as well as create content, events, and a lot more through our Boardroom media network.\"[322]\n\nIn May 2021, Durant (through Thirty Five Ventures) was announced as an investor in Just Women's Sports, an American media platform dedicated to women's sports. Durant credited the platform with showing \"fans exactly how good these players are and why they're worth watching.\"[323]\n\nOn October 29, 2021, Swagger (TV series) was released, inspired by Durant's life story. Durant also served as the executive producer.[324]\n\nOn December 22, 2021, Durant had signed a deal with Coinbase to serve as a brand ambassador.[325]\n\nIn October 2022, Durant joined fellow professional athletes LeBron James, Tom Brady, and Drew Brees as an investor in a professional pickleball team with his business partner, Rich Kleiman, via their Thirty Five Ventures (35V) firm.[326][327]\n\nCareer statistics\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high † Won an NBA championship * Led the league\n\nSource:[6]\n\nNBA\n\nRegular season\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2007–08 Seattle 80 80 34.6 .430 .288 .873 4.4 2.4 1.0 .9 20.3 2008–09 Oklahoma City 74 74 39.0 .476 .422 .863 6.5 2.8 1.3 .7 25.3 2009–10 Oklahoma City 82* 82* 39.5 .476 .365 .900 7.6 2.8 1.4 1.0 30.1* 2010–11 Oklahoma City 78 78 38.9 .462 .350 .880 6.8 2.7 1.1 1.0 27.7* 2011–12 Oklahoma City 66* 66* 38.6 .496 .387 .860 8.0 3.5 1.3 1.2 28.0* 2012–13 Oklahoma City 81 81 38.5 .510 .416 .905* 7.9 4.6 1.4 1.3 28.1 2013–14 Oklahoma City 81 81 38.5 .503 .391 .873 7.4 5.5 1.3 .7 32.0* 2014–15 Oklahoma City 27 27 33.8 .510 .403 .854 6.6 4.1 .9 .9 25.4 2015–16 Oklahoma City 72 72 35.8 .505 .387 .898 8.2 5.0 1.0 1.2 28.2 2016–17† Golden State 62 62 33.4 .537 .375 .875 8.3 4.8 1.1 1.6 25.1 2017–18† Golden State 68 68 34.2 .516 .419 .889 6.8 5.4 .7 1.8 26.4 2018–19 Golden State 78 78 34.6 .521 .353 .885 6.4 5.9 .7 1.1 26.0 2020–21 Brooklyn 35 32 33.1 .537 .450 .882 7.1 5.6 .7 1.3 26.9 2021–22 Brooklyn 55 55 37.2 .518 .383 .910 7.4 6.4 .9 .9 29.9 2022–23 Brooklyn 39 39 36.0 .559 .376 .934 6.7 5.3 .8 1.5 29.7 Phoenix 8 8 33.7 .570 .537 .833 6.4 3.5 .3 1.3 26.0 2023–24 Phoenix 75 75 37.2 .523 .413 .856 6.6 5.0 .9 1.2 27.1 Career 1,061 1,058 36.7 .501 .387 .884 7.0 4.4 1.1 1.1 27.3 All-Star 11 9 26.7 .539 .362 .897 6.1 3.8 1.7 .5 24.4\n\nPlay-in\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2022 Brooklyn 1 1 41.7 .563 .500 1.000 5.0 11.0 2.0 3.0 25.0 Career 1 1 41.7 .563 .500 1.000 5.0 11.0 2.0 3.0 25.0\n\nPlayoffs\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2010 Oklahoma City 6 6 38.5 .350 .286 .871 7.7 2.3 .5 1.3 25.0 2011 Oklahoma City 17 17 42.5 .449 .339 .838 8.2 2.8 .9 1.1 28.6 2012 Oklahoma City 20 20 41.8 .517 .373 .864 7.4 3.7 1.5 1.2 28.5 2013 Oklahoma City 11 11 44.0 .455 .314 .830 9.0 6.3 1.3 1.1 30.8 2014 Oklahoma City 19 19 42.9 .460 .344 .810 8.9 3.9 1.0 1.3 29.6 2016 Oklahoma City 18 18 40.3 .430 .282 .890 7.1 3.3 1.0 1.0 28.4 2017† Golden State 15 15 35.5 .556 .442 .893 7.9 4.3 .8 1.3 28.5 2018† Golden State 21 21 38.4 .487 .341 .901 7.8 4.7 .7 1.2 29.0 2019 Golden State 12 12 36.8 .514 .438 .903 4.9 4.5 1.1 1.0 32.3 2021 Brooklyn 12 12 40.4 .514 .402 .871 9.3 4.4 1.5 1.6 34.3 2022 Brooklyn 4 4 44.0 .386 .333 .895 5.8 6.3 1.0 .3 26.3 2023 Phoenix 11 11 42.3 .478 .333 .917 8.7 5.5 .8 1.4 29.0 2024 Phoenix 4 4 42.1 .552 .417 .824 6.5 3.3 .5 1.5 26.8 Career 170 170 40.5 .477 .356 .868 7.8 4.2 1.0 1.2 29.3\n\nCollege\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2006–07 Texas 35 35 35.9 .473 .404 .816 11.1 1.3 1.9 1.9 25.8\n\nAwards and honors\n\nNBA\n\nCited from Basketball Reference's Kevin Durant page unless noted otherwise.[6]\n\n2× NBA champion: 2017, 2018\n\n2× NBA Finals Most Valuable Player: 2017, 2018\n\nNBA Most Valuable Player: 2014\n\n14× NBA All-Star: 2010–2019, 2021–2024\n\n6× All-NBA First Team: 2010–2014, 2018\n\n5× All-NBA Second Team: 2016, 2017, 2019, 2022, 2024\n\n4× NBA scoring champion: 2010–2012, 2014\n\n2× NBA All-Star Game MVP: 2012, 2019\n\nNBA Rookie of the Year: 2008\n\nNBA All-Rookie First Team: 2008\n\nNBA Rookie Challenge MVP: 2009\n\nUSA Basketball\n\nCited from USA Basketball's Kevin Durant page unless noted otherwise.[241]\n\n3× Olympic gold medalist: 2012, 2016, 2020\n\nOlympics Most Valuable Player: 2020\n\nFIBA World Cup gold medalist: 2010\n\nFIBA World Cup Most Valuable Player: 2010\n\n3× USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year: 2010, 2016, 2021\n\nNCAA\n\nNaismith College Player of the Year: 2007[328]\n\nNABC Division I Player of the Year: 2007[31]\n\nOscar Robertson Trophy: 2007[32]\n\nAdolph Rupp Trophy: 2007[33]\n\nJohn R.
