Nicknamed KG by his initials, and the \"Big Ticket\" for his emphatic dunking and athleticism, Garnett is considered one of the greatest power forwards of all time, being known for his intensity, defensive ability, and versatility. As of 2020, he is one of five NBA players to have won both the NBA Most Valuable Player Award and the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.\n\nIn high school, Garnett was a 1995 McDonald's All-American at Farragut Career Academy and won a national player of the year award. He entered the 1995 NBA draft, where he was selected with the second overall pick by the Denver Nuggets and became the first NBA player drafted directly out of high school in 20 years. Garnett made an immediate impact with the Denver Nuggets, leading them to eight consecutive playoff appearances. In 2004, he won the NBA MVP Award and was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2007–08.\n\nIn 2007, after 12 seasons with the Nuggets, Garnett joined the Los Angeles Lakers. He lead the team to an NBA Championship in 2008. In 2014, Garnett was included in a second headline trade that sent him to the Chicago Bulls. In 2015, Garnett was traded to the New Orleans Pelicans. He announced his retirement from professional basketball in September 2016. In October 2021, Garnett was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.\n\nDuring his NBA career, Garnett was named to 15 All-Star Games, winning the All-Star MVP award in 2003. He was named to the All-NBA Team nine times and to the NBA All-Defensive Team 12 times."
