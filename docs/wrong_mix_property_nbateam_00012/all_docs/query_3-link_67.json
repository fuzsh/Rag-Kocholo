        "text": "It was all about his loved ones when Jay-Z accepted the 2nd annual Dr. Dre Global Impact Award at the 2024 Grammy Awards. This award acknowledges the billionaire music mogul’s impact as a cultural icon. As someone whose career was closely intertwined with the NBA, Jay-Z was getting celebrated by the players who tend to be his muse. Kevin Garnett was among the many hyped for Shawn Carter.\n\nFollowing Carter’s piercing acceptance speech, The Big Ticket was on his Instagram Stories raving about him. “Shout to Jay-z for being celebrated.. that black Grammy fire… Salute King…” As KG is prone to, his message was littered with saluting and fire emojis.\n\nThe Carters stepped out in a big way for the Grammys. His eldest daughter, Blue Ivy, joined him on stage to accept the award. In the same speech, he joked about Blue having her own Grammys and shaded the Recording Academy for not giving his wife, Beyonce Album of the Year yet.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“I used to say it was a supply cup for Blue, but Blue’s grown up now, she doesn’t take sippy cups, and she has her own Grammys,” Jay-Z said about his 12-year-old daughter who featured on her mom’s “Brown Skin Girl” which won Best Music Video.\n\nBeyonce cheered from the audience while their six-year-old twins, Rumi and Sir were home. Mrs. Carter got the boldest shoutout of the night. “I don’t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won Album of the Year.” Both Beyonce and Jay-Z boast 88 Grammy nominations each. Beyonce has won 33 of them. She’s nominated for Album of the Year six times but never won.\n\nWATCH THIS STORY | Shaquille O’Neal Threatens Stephen A. Smith After New Studio Debut: “Im a Have to Call TEX JOHNSON”\n\nFamously, 2017 Album of the Year awardee, Adele said the same and it’s still a sore point for the BeyHive. The debate on Beyonce’s repeated snub aside, the Carters’ connection to The Big Ticket go way back.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nJay-Z and KG’s connection\n\nIt was back when Jay-Z and Beyonce were courtside staples at Brooklyn Nets games. Garnett was playing for the Nets in 2015, after Carter sold his stake in the team. He’d still attend home games with his wife. The NBA champion infamously headbutted Houston’s Dwight Howard during a game in the presence of the Carters.\n\nThe Dr. Dre Global Impact Award honors artists who have given back to the community beyond the music medium. KG saw Shawn Carter’s impact firsthand while exploring Brooklyn. In 2023, he shared the image of a city public library that was revived with art commemorating Jay-Z and his lyrics showcasing his impact.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe love Brooklyn has for Jay-Z is almost as much as the admiration Kevin Garnett has for the music legend. How do you see Jay-Z’s global impact?"
