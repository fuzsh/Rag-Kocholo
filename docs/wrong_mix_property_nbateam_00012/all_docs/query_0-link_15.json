        "text": "The Celtics had built a NBA World Championship-caliber team by the mid-2000s but needed an extra boost to go the distance. Enter Kevin Garnett. Coming to Boston on a blockbuster trade, the veteran forward was a perennial All-Star and rebounding champion known for his high-flying dunks and relentless defensive energy. In his first season as a Celtics player in 2007-08, KG and the new Big Three led Boston to an unforgettable six-game NBA Finals victory. It would be Garnett’s only title in his illustrious career, but as he emotionally exclaimed after the win: “Anything is possible.” Learn more about KG and his six seasons in Boston here."
