        "text": "The date was circled on calendars throughout Minnesota ever since the NBA released the 2007-08 schedule last August.\n\nThe return of Kevin Garnett on Feb. 8 to the place he created so many basketball memories was going to be a special occasion.\n\nGarnett was going to be wearing his No. 5 Boston Celtics' uniform and facing the Minnesota Timberwolves, the only team he played for the past 12 seasons.\n\nThe Timberwolves required fans to buy tickets to one or two other regular-season games in order to purchase a ticket for Garnett's return to Minnesota. Ticket agencies were charging higher prices than normal.\n\nWhen the Celtics make their annual visit to the Target Center tonight, though, there will be disappointment in the air.\n\nGarnett will be on hand, but he will miss his sixth straight game due to an strained abdominal muscle, putting a damper on the homecoming (8:05, TV: ESPN and Comcast SportsNet; radio: WEEI-850 AM).\n\nHis former team does plan to give Garnett a special introduction in between the national anthem and the announcing of the starting lineups.\n\nThere was plenty of anticipation in Minnesota this season awaiting Garnett's return after he played 927 points, scored 19,041 points and grabbed 10,542 rebounds for the Timberwolves.\n\nGarnett has not played since getting injured in the fourth quarter of an 87-86 win over Minnesota at the TD Banknorth Garden two weeks ago tonight.\n\nHe returned at the end of that game and made a clinching steal against former Boston guard Sebastian Telfair to enable the Celtics to avoid an upset.\n\nGarnett has kept a low profile ever since, watching games on television in the locker room rather than being on the bench. But he held a seven-minute press conference Wednesday night to give an injury update.\n\n“I've been trying to bring energy like I always do in a whole other way, in more of a cheerleading way, if you will,” said Garnett. “Give my insight to the guys and all that. So I'm still trying to be a presence. I make my trips, I work out every day and, hopefully, I'll be back soon.”\n\nCoach Doc Rivers had said that Garnett will make a brief appearance on the Celtics' bench prior to tonight's game if the Timberwolves are going to introduce him to the crowd.\n\n“I doubt if he sits on the bench (for the game),” said Rivers. “That would be different, and I don't want to do anything different.\n\n“If I find out when I get there that they're planning on something for him, we'll have him come on the floor to acknowledge that, then I'll tell him to get out.”\n\nTimberwolves senior vice president of communications Ted Johnson confirmed on the team's Web site Thursday that there will be a pregame acknowledgement of Garnett.\n\n“We wanted to give fans a chance to thank Kevin Garnett for all that he contributed to the organization in his 12 years in Minnesota,” said Johnson. “Even though it's unprecedented for teams to introduce a player not in the starting lineup, we felt it was important for our fans to have the opportunity to show their appreciation.”\n\nThe Timberwolves also announced they will give fans in attendance tonight a voucher for a free ticket to an upcoming game against Toronto, Philadelphia or Utah.\n\nThe Celtics acquired Garnett last July 31 for Al Jefferson, Gerald Green, Ryan Gomes, Telfair, Theo Ratliff and two first-round picks.\n\nGarnett has spoken very little about the Timberwolves this season, focusing on what the Celtics have been doing.\n\nFans in Minnesota, where the team is among the worst in the NBA with a young nucleus, seem to miss a player who was once the face of the franchise. Kevin McHale, a Hall of Fame forward who spent his career with the Celtics, has been taking heat for dealing away Garnett.\n\nOn a Minneapolis Star-Tribune Web site this week, one entry read, “He deserves a big thank you from the fans. Can the other Kevin come out for a big boo?“\n\nAnother post referred to McHale, the Timberwolves' basketball boss, as “McFail.” Asked about seeing Garnett tonight, McHale is quoted on the team's Web site as saying, “I'm not going to go down and invade their locker room. I imagine that if I ran into him, I'd like to see him. I like Kevin. Kevin is such a good guy and he was here such a long time. He really was the first guy I drafted.”\n\nThe Celtics (37-9) were fortunate to escape the Timberwolves (10-37) when they met at the Garden last month. It took a put-back by Kendrick Perkins to overcome Minnesota, and Jefferson, Gomes, Green and Telfair made strong contributions.\n\n“They'll be up for the game,” said Rivers of the Timberwolves. “They should have won here. We were very lucky to win that game.\n\n“They're playing terrific right now. It's going to be a tough one. They're going to be fired up. The one guy we would have to get us all fired up will be in street clothes.\n\n“We're going to have to understand going into that game for them it's going to be big and they're going to play it. We have to same intensity or we won't win the game.”"
