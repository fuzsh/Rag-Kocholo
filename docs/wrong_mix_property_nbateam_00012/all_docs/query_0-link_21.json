        "text": "Kevin Garnett of the Boston Celtics won the NBA’s Defensive Player of the Year award Tuesday. He beat out Denver’s Marcus Camby and Houston’s Shane Battier.\n\nThe 6-foot-11 forward led the Celtics with 9.2 rebounds per game. He added 18.8 points, 1.2 blocks and 1.4 steals.\n\nGarnett helped the Celtics to league-best records of 66-16 (.805) overall and 31-10 (.738) on the road. Boston held opponents to just 90.3 points (second in the NBA) after allowing 99.2 points per game a season ago. The Celtics had the biggest one-year turnaround in NBA history.\n\nGarnett received 493 points, including 90 first-place votes. Camby, who won the award last season, finished second with 178 points and Battier had 175 points.\n\nInformation from the Associated Press contributed to this report."
