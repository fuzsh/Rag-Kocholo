        "text": "If you were to ask the average, everyday NBA fan who the best defender in the NBA is right now, chances are they would say Dwight Howard.\n\nNow there are quite a few answers to this question, and none of them are necessarily wrong, it just so happens that Howard has the hardware in his trophy case to back up some of those claims.\n\nThere is no award in the game that is dominated by single players for years at a time other than the Defensive Player of the Year award. Certain players will win it, grab ahold of it and never let go, as Howard will now look to become the third player to win the award four times next season.\n\nWhen you think about the names of those DPOY winners, certain players stick out, from Howard to Ben Wallace and Alonzo Mourning, to Dikembe Mutombo and Hakeem Olajuwan and even Michael Jordan, he seems to stick his head into every other category, so why not this one?\n\nBut, the question remains, whose award winning year was the best.\n\nThis is a bit of a tough question to answer, especially since a huge portion of defense is not based on stats, unless you totally buy into advanced metrics in basketball (I can't say that I do yet, they are still in their infancy), so you have to reminisce on individuals in that particular season.\n\nThen you have to take into account the era that certain guys played in. It was easier to be more physical back in the '80s and early '90s, giving more competition for the award, but also the possibility of inflated stats. However, I don't think that anyone would argue that the individual as a star defender these days is much rarer than it was 20 years ago, dragging down competition for the award.\n\nDwight Howard may have nearly won the past three DPOY Awards unanimously, but does that mean his year was better than Mark Eaton's 1989 season when he got just under 31 percent of the vote. Not by a long shot.\n\nAnd how do you account for a guy like Dennis Rodman, who was never one to rack up huge amounts of blocks and steals, but still won two awards, and could have easily won more?\n\nIs it more impressive if a guard wins the award? Is a block more important than a steal? Do you get bonus points for breaking another players streak of consecutive awards? Is it worth more to win the award during the heyday of the Bad Boy Pistons if you weren't a part of the Bad Boy Pistons? And how much does Alonzo Mourning get dinged for winning it in 1999 playing only 50 games?\n\nI'll answer all of those questions and more in the coming slides. Hell, I'll just answer those questions really quickly right now; yes, no, yes, yes and a little bit.\n\nDwight Howard's three-peat of Defensive Player of the Year Awards might get a little bit skewed historically considering the large number of votes he has gotten in the past three years.\n\nHe has utterly dominated the voting for the award over the past three years because of three things.\n\nFirst, he gets tons of media attention because of his fierce blocks and the fact that he is the premier center in the league.\n\nSecond, he has the opportunity to get more points with second and third place votes when players up until 2003 had just first place votes to rely on, meaning they had to blow everyone else out of the water defensively to get the percentages that Howard has been getting.\n\nAnd third, the league has had a defensive power vacuum ever since the latter part of the past decade. There are good individual defenders, but most great defense comes as a team with the parts not standing out as much as they once did.\n\n2009 was the year that Dwight Howard really got on the map defensively.\n\nFor the first time in his career he led the league in blocks with 231 (or 2.9 a game, depending on how you prefer to process that information), plus after averaging just a shade under a steal a game for his career, he finally broke the trend and got to the magical whole number and had a steal per game.\n\nStill, something is missing for me when Howard goes out and blocks nearly three shots a game. When he blocks a shot, he goes for the crowd pleaser instead of the coach pleaser, often swatting the ball six rows up into the stands. This does make for a nice show and an intimidating play, but it gives the ball right back to the other team, which kind of defeats the purpose of blocking a shot.\n\nThe afro reigned supreme over the NBA for so many years that it seemed strange for about two or three years after he won his last award when other people started winning them.\n\nWallace was the epitome of a defense-first center. He wasn't a big man, but he was smart, he hustled and he had a mean streak.\n\nHe could block shots of guys four or five inches taller than himself with ease, and when he couldn't he would poke them in the ribs and step on their toes to pester them as much as possible before turning around and throwing his large backside into them to get the rebound.\n\nIn 2006, Wallace's final DPOY Award, he ended up with 1.8 steals a game and 2.2 blocks to go along with over 11 rebounds. He truly was a well-rounded defender in his prime.\n\nWhenever history is made, I must stop and take notice, so I hereby notice you, Alvin Robertson, for your defensive prowess in 1986.\n\nRobertson is perhaps the second most impressive guard to win the award (o. 1 is still to come, I'll give you one guess and a third of a second to guess who it is), and his legacy will live on forever now that he has won it.\n\nHe went ahead and posted 3.7 steals a game in 1986, or what I like to call, an all-time record. Now, Don Buse did total 4.1 steals a game for Indiana back in 1976, but it was in the ABA, so it's going to have an asterisk by it forever.\n\nDavid Robinson had a season like no other in 1992.\n\nWhen he came into the league just two years prior, hopes were high, as there was rarely a player so dominant and poised at the same time coming out of college. He was said to be a sure thing, a can't miss prospect.\n\nOh boy was he.\n\nIn 1992, Robinson blocked 305 shots, equating to 4.5 a game, and stole the ball 181 times, which is just over 2.3 times a game. On top of that he grabbed over 12 rebounds, saved three cats from trees and put out six burning buildings per game in 1992.\n\nIf you are one of those twitterers, you can follow me @JDorsey33."
