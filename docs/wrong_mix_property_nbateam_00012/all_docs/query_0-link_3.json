        "text": "Slated to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame this Saturday along with some of the greatest players, coaches, and media members from his era, champion Boston Celtics big man Kevin Garnett is about to be immortalized in basketball Valhalla.\n\nAnd while he reached the peak of his powers as a Celtic, with 21 seasons in the league, there have been a host of big moments we should all celebrate as fans of the game. To that end, we compiled No. 5’s five biggest career moments — two of which were achieved with Boston — for all of us to wax nostalgic over.\n\nCheck out the list below as we honor the Big Ticket with the greatest honor of the sport he dedicated his life to."
