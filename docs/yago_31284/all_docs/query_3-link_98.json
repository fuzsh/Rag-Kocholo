        "text": "Sea Serpent’s Heir vol 1 Mairghread Scott, Pablo Tunica Skybound-Image full review posted; Aella begins as the young, innocent hero without any knowledge of who she truly is other than the daughter of a Pirate Queen, Ryana. A zealot church’s army of knights is destroying all the people like her mother and magical pirate family. As the knights chase down the girl who appeared in a prophecy as the one who contains the demon Xir, the girl must make difficult decisions between the love for her family, her original good nature to avoid killing, and her first romantic love. Aella moves from feeling powerless to being like a god. In her attempt to save everyone, she sees that violence is the only way out and death is the only way to stop people from fighting. If Kylo Ren’s story was about a girl and the sea rather than a boy in space, it would be this beautifully rendered book filled with detailed panels and a select muted palette of greens, blues, and reds Scurry vol 1 Mac Smith Skybound-Image full review posted; Humans set off a nuclear weapon and the animals who were far enough away have survived and gained some skills. Very much like The Secret of NIMH. Beautiful art with attention to making each character unique in appearance which isn’t easy with nests of mice and rats, beavers, packs of wolves and angry cats. The story has a lot of action and tension. There are 3 fox sisters who are oracles to the forest animals. The animals pass down the prophecy that the Guardian won’t return until Erebus the Shadow Wolf dies. Two tiny little young mice heroically suss out betrayals, take epic journeys, make new friends and enemies, and eventually save their colony though after many animal deaths. Sea of Thieves: Origins Jeremy Whitley, Rhoald Marcellius (a), Sakti Yuwono (c) Titan Comics narrative stories of characters from the main title; as standard for Whitley, the women have the strong backbones to try anything the men can do which includes sailing, pirating, and running businesses. Is it anti-union or specifically anti-mob union? I Hate This Place vol 1 Kyle Starks (w/cocreator), Artyom Topilin (a/cocreator), Lee Loughridge (c), Pat Brosseau (L) Skybound a lesbian couple inherits a cattle farm that seems to be equally haunted inside by a poltergeist, haunted by a thousand ghosts outside the house, surrounded by a forest of giant alien spiders, AND there’s an armed man who stole a bunch of money trying to kill them so he can find the money his partners stashed Killadelphia (deluxe Year One, 1-12 plus bonus comic Elysium Gardens)\n\nRodney Barnes, Jason Shawn Alexander, Luis NCT, Marshall Dillon\n\nhistorical fiction with vampires Pretty Little Dead Girl Mercedes Yardley, Orion Zangara Kickstarter mystical and magical Twig 1-4 Skottie Young, Kyle Strahm, Jean-Francois Beaulieu, Nate Piekos Image Twig is a small blue fuzzy creature who loves to cook. However when his father died, he had to take over his job as a “placeling” which means he is responsible for placing the last gem. He’s accompanied by a slug like friend, Splat. All because Twig woke up late his day, his entire quest is jeopardized. Each step requires making amends before going on. The Big Adventures of Baby Mouse: Once Upon a Messy Whisker Jennifer L. Holm and Matthew Holm RH Children’s Books Babymouse has messy whiskers that get in her way and get made fun of. She learns about the power of making wishes and getting what you asked for. The Black Ghost: Hard Revolution Alex Segura, Monica Gallagher (w), George Kambadais (a), Marco Finnegan (layouts), Ellie Wright (c), Taylor Esposito (L & design)\n\nComixology Originals\n\na tie-in to Segura’s novel about a woman in the comics industry Ten Thousand Black Feathers Jeff Lemire, Andrea Sorrentino, Dave Stewart, Steve Wands (L&design), Greg Lockard (ed) Image Part of The Bone Orchard mythos; not a one-shot; intriguing story told in like a true crime podcast that sucks you in with baby step reveals. Census #1 Marc Bernardin & Adam Freeman (writers/creators), Sebastián Piriz (art & colors), Bernardo Brice (L), Sarah Litt (ed) Comixology Originals Funny sit-com type of story about Liam Malone, a Virgin in NYC who takes a job as a census counter for supernatural beings; day one he ends up in the apartment of a succubus family who want to sacrifice him. Earthdivers vol 1: Kill Columbus Stephen Graham Jones (w), Davide Gianfelice (a), Joana Lafuente (c), Steve Wands (L), Maggie Howell (ed) IDW 4 indigenous people in the year 2112 go to a cave that allows one at a time to travel back in time. Tad goes to the ship Nina in 1492. The Closet James Tynion IV (w), Gavin Fullerton (a), Chris O’Halloran (c), Tom Napolitano (L), Dylan Todd (design), Greg Lockard (ed) Image Thom is a screw up of a dad who keeps ignoring responsibilities to his wife Maggie and son Jamie. Jamie is terrified of a monster who comes out of his closet. Moving across the country doesn’t solve it. The story seems like it’s a sci fi where the monster is real, perhaps and alien. But the origin of the nightmares is from when Thom had an affair and kept a box of its mementos in Jamie’s closet. It feels like there should be a clearer ending other than Thom and Maggie keep fighting and Jamie is still scared to death. A Town Called Terror vol 1 Steve Niles (w), Szymon Kudranski (a), Scott O. Brown (L), Marshall Dillon (L) Image Fantastic art! This would be a fantastic monster horror about a man who is half-demon (Henry) returning to his monster only hometown to save his mother. As he battles his father, Lloyd, who keeps returning from the dead, Henry learns his real father is a priest. But supposedly Henry could come and go through the magical boundary of the town yet after fighting Lloyd, he’s stuck. Unless it’s going to be explained, it’s a bug mistake in the plot. Junk Rabbit Jimmie Robinson Image Detailed art that shows the junk city outside the domes as sepia/brown wash; no sun for years; in the domes in earth and in space, the air is so different and clean presumably that people who are accustomed to living in The Sink (junk city) can’t breathe it and vice versa. The dialog and narration is difficult using speculative slang of the year 2198. Consumerism is all that America understands. People have either been implanted with bio-thlinks to network or they remain offline. The Master of the Dome is one of those offline. His irritating, attention seeking son is murdered so Masters sends Det Chela Omina to solve it. Police wear badges of their corporate sponsors. The Keepsakers (W) Tayson Martindale (CA) Second Rocket Comics Invader Comics OGN b/w; fantastically original story about children and their favorite stuffed animals and what happens when people need them the most. Purr Evil Mirka Andolfo, Laura Braga Image Intriguing issue 1 as readers are shown that there’s some kind of magic and strange links between Rita, her daughter Deb, and a supposedly dead rock star named Angela Starr. Breath of Shadows Rich Douek, Alex Cormack, Justin Birch IDW 1968 British rock band includes a lead singer, an addict, who is set on exploring Mayan region to find something an author wrote about in his last book. Cat Fight Andrew Wheeler (w), Ilias Kyriazis (a), Auguste (i), Dennis Yatras (c), Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou (L) IDW Thief Felix owes a lot of money; his Nana Kitty formerly Kitty Midnight of NYC, is looking to add Felix to the Kit Kat Crime Syndicate, her gang with morality rules. Villain Schrodinger sets Felix up for murder and tips off the Kit Kat Syndicate. Pink Lemonade OGN Nick Cagnetti Oni Press Sweet and innocent story about someone wanting to be a hero Scrapper 1-4 of 6 Cliff Bleszinski & Alex de Campi (w), Sandy Jarrell (a), Alex de Campi (L), Ryan Kelly & Jordie Bellaire (I2 art) Image Comics I had fallen in love with this book about dogs living in a domed city and governed by an evil powerful tech agency (but for some reason no cats exist?) and then in the inspiring letter from Bleszinski, he quotes Louis fucking abuser with privilege CK. This isn’t a naive person outside pop culture. This is a creator of Gears of War and Fortnite who has Broadway credentials as well. This means he consciously chose to include a LCK quote without concern for what people hurt by abusers in Entertainment have done. Otherwise, it really is a great comic. *sigh* Antarctica 1-3 Simon Birks (w), Willi Roberts (a), Lyndon White (L) Image Comics Crisp art and wonderful balance of limited colors to dark ink per page. excellent lettering- didn’t even have to zoom in. Art comes off more realistic with body styles and uniqueness of each character even the duplicates from a parallel universe. If you don’t have “multiverse fatigue,” you might enjoy this one. Beneath the Trees Where Nobody Sees #1 Horvath, Otsmane-Elhaou IDW With a storybook art style that looks suitable for children’s books, comes a story of serial killers hiding amongst the anthropomorphic citizens of a small idyllic town. The Addams Family: The Bodies Issue Zoë Quinn (w), Philip Murphy (p), Philip Murphy & Maria Keane (i), Valentina Pinto (c), Christa Miesner (L) IDW Feels like its identical to the first of the animated movies. Con & On 1&2 Paul Cornell (w), Marika Cresta (a), Paul Little (c), Rob Steen (L) & more Ahoy Comics A narrative based look at the differences a white male aspiring writer and his friend a black female aspiring artist get through the first “major” comic con in the 1990s (where Hollywood first appeared). I get why someone might find this nostalgic look back at the first British creators being famous in the US, but the whole first issue felt bitter in a “get off my lawn” way. Devil Water Mario Candelaria (w), Silver Ferris (a), Scott Ewen (L), James Ferguson (ed) Kickstarter Creepy and horrific story of 2 best friends who are demons; the story flashes between World War II & Prohibition. Project: Cryptid anthology Ahoy Comics I liked the Ballroom of Death by Mark Russell (w), Jordi Perez (a), Madeline Seely (c), and Rob Steen (L) Lycan vol 1&2 Robinson, Donaire, Dominguez, Saavedra, Crugnola, Gabo, Kompan Hive Head Studios An Arabian origin of the first werewolf in 8000 BC Blood Tree Peter J. Tomasi (w), Maxim Šimić (a), John Kalisz (c), Rob Leigh (L) Image/Mad Ghost Serial killer out to end the bloodlines of all murderers because he believes violence is genetic; this killer turns innocent people into “angels” by drugging them and stitching wings to them; some of the art is questionable like where are these sutured wings hiding under clothes? It can’t be explained away as magical/divine. Lettering had an interesting effect in a gun fight where the BLAMs were different colors for the shooters – never saw that before and appreciated it. The Holy Roller #1 Andy Samberg, Rick Remender, Joe Trohman, Roland Boschi, Moreno Dinisio Image/Giant Generator Excellent extended first issue showing the rise of Anti-Semitism in the form of a prodigal son, Levi, returning home to Cleveland to see his dying father, a local bowling champion. Parliament of Rooks #1 Abigail Jill Harding (w/a), Richard Starkings (L) Comixology A Gothic romance fantasy as if you combined Cinderella, The Darkness, and forbidden / star-crossed lovers. Shelley Frankenstein: Cowpiggy Colleen Madden TopShelf/IDW Loved it! Rose Wolves Natalie Warner TopShelf/IDW Beyond LOVED IT, count this as a Don’t Miss pick Dracula (Universal Monsters) 1-3 Tynion, Simmonds Image I’ve been a fan of Martin Simmonds for years. The limited palette, staggering lines, and some collage effects make for wildly dramatic pages. Last issue comes out in January 2024. Haunted Girl #1 Young high school girl is treated for mental illness because she’s actually fulfilling some kind of prophecy. Good Comics for Bad People: an extra fabulous collection Zach M. Stafford Image Quick humor, often crude, surprised there are grammar errors like possessives and contractions. Makhno: Ukrainian Freedom Fighter (originally Le Vent des Libertaires) Philippe Thirault, Roberto Zaghi (a), Annelise Sauvetre (c), Sebastian Gerard (color pg1), Nanette McGuinness (translator), Mark Waid (publisher) Life Drawn by Humanoids Fictionalized biography of Ukrainian peasant Nestor Ivanovych Miknienko, an anarchist who rose and gathered an army to fight the Soviets, Germans, Bolsheviks, and White Cossacks (his army was consider Black Cossacks). He became Makhno while in prison. He freed his town to a communal egalitarian and free Huliaipole. This OGN makes the life of Makhno personal and dramatic taking it from his childhood when his mother has no choice but to allow a higher class woman adopt him & his subsequent escape to his first love, second love (his wife), and women with militia skills he puts in charge of certain regiments. His best friend reunites with him in France sent to assassinate him under threat of his own family being killed by Stalin. Stunning art, colors, and lettering with a story that takes the early 20th c revolution to be more than dry text book reading as our 2022-23 Ukraine fights again. The Deadliest Bouquet Erica Schultz (w&L), Carola Borelli (a), Gab Contreras (1-3 colors), Tom Chu (4-5 colors), James Emmett (ed) Image Three deadly sisters with an unusual upbringing have to solve their mother’s murder. Covid Cop Dean Haspiel Kickstarter Fun and weird. Absolutely love the limited palette of purple, pink, blue, and radioactive green. Black’s Myth: The Key to His Heart Eric Palicki (w), Wendell Cavalcanti (a), Rob Steen (L) & more Ahoy Half-werewolf, half-djinn, and now half-demon. A new character is a key figure who is also self identified as the only black girl in her school – there’s no shading to her skin to indicate that. Main character Strummer is biracial and the covers (in color) give a hint at that. Plus the djinn is middle eastern (described with an accent) and should also be shaded. Swan Songs #1 W. Maxwell Prince (w), Martin Simmonds (a), Good Old Neon (L) Image Comics Mostly told through inner thoughts of Brian who needs to appreciate the small good things left in the world as the Doomsday Clock counts down. His mother is dying from kidney failure and Brian reads to her about flowers, those beautiful earthly treasures that no longer exist. I’m a big fan of Simmonds to begin with and his art works well in this story where there’s an abundance of grime, crime, dystopia, depression, with small smattering of love. Kill Your Darlings 1 Ethan S. Parker, Griffin Sheridan, Bob Quinn, John J. Hill Image (Newcomers who haven’t published a comic before and got introduced to the right people). For fans of I Kill Giants or stories where kids live so realistically in their imaginations that there’s little separation."
