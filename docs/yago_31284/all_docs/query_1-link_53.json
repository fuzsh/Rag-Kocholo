        "text": "offoffBway.com\n\nJuly 6, 2007\n\nPurposeful Theater that Matters\n\nWell, that’s what the title says. And we’re suckers for titles. This one isn’t an all time great but it definitely makes you think IMPORTANT, even if its ironic. You know what? We have no idea what the show is about, we haven’t seen it. BUT with a title like that… how can you not???\n\nRead on…\n\nOne Man Tries to Combat his Fears and Anxieties on a Road Trip of Self-Discovery in THE PURPOSE OF MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE A Multi-Media Geography of a Nervous Breakdown Part of the Eighth Annual Midtown International Theatre Festival\n\nAttempting to understand one’s place in the world can be a terrifying prospect, as Joe Hutcheson demonstrates in his multi-media autobiographical one-man show THE PURPOSE OF MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE. Written and performed by Hutcheson (and subtitled “the geography of a nervous breakdown”) the show will be presented as part of the Eighth Annual Midtown International Theatre Festival, and be performed at Stage Left Studio, located at 438 West 37th Street on the 5th Floor. Directed by DB Levin, performances will begin on July 27th.\n\nHow can a person face a new life when he can’t get rid of the baggage from the old - especially while paralyzed by obsessiveness, crippling fears of failure, death, loss, inadequacy and just not fitting in? Such is the situation Joe finds himself in as he prepares to uproot his comfortable (if not altogether happy) existence in California for a new life in Florida. Eschewing a plane ride, he takes a road trip cross-country, but finds himself suffering an emotional meltdown almost before he gets started. Seeing a long and endless road with nothing but emptiness and despair stretched out before him, he must look deep inside himself to learn perhaps the one true axiom when it comes to life: sometimes you wonder and other times you just don’t know - and all we can do every day is the best we can. Along the way, Joe is joined by several travel mates, including his born-again mother, his pill-popping step-mother, some old classmates, and his lesbian soul mate. His adventure culminates in a rather interesting encounter in a techno gay bar in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nMore than a monologue, THE PURPOSE OF MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE is a multi-media event, combining video and film projection, a slide show, music and other audio elements to take the audience along on this literal and emotional journey.\n\nJoe Hutcheson developed THE PURPOSE OF MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE while completing his Master of Fine Arts at the University of Florida. He also holds a BFA from Cal State Fullerton. Regional credits include Into the Woods (The Baker), Romeo & Juliet (Mercutio), Noises Off, Search and Destroy, Taking Sides, and Forever Plaid. Joe was honored at the Kennedy Center/American College Theatre Festival for best classical performance and was awarded a full scholarship for a summer of study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts. In New York, Joe has appeared in I Hate Music: The Music and Songs of Glen Roven-featuring Douglas Sills, Donna McKechnie and Sandy Duncan; and the Monday Nights, New Voices Second Anniversary Concert at the Duplex. Most recently, Hutcheson sat alongside Eric McCormack (of TV’s Will and Grace) and Broadway’s Kerry Butler at New World Stages for a reading of Glen Roven’s The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T. To read more of his writing, find his monthly column at www.shiftdrink.com.\n\nDirector DB Levin has a long history in theatre, film and television. Most recently, his comedy Meet Me at the Purple Orchid was read at the Atlantic Theatre Company and his dramatic play One Step Over received an extended-run world premiere in Los Angeles. Before that, he co-wrote the feature documentary Bitter Jester (executive produced by Richard Belzer and winner at the New York Independent Film Festival) and co-scripted a film adaptation of Ibsen’s A Doll’s House with Janet McTeer. In addition, he wrote and directed the short film The Garden Path (Zola Productions) as well several television pilots. As a director, he has helmed many off-Broadway works, including versions of Tina Howe’s The Art of Dining, Tom Stoppard’s On the Razzle, and David Mamet’s American Buffalo. In 1998, he served as a visiting artist at the Royal National Theatre in London.\n\nTHE PURPOSE OF MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE will be performed at the intimate Stage Left Studio, located at 438 West 37th Street (between 9th & 10th Avenues) in Suite 5A.\n\nShow times are Friday, July 27th at 6pm, Sunday, July 29th at 4:15pm, Thursday, August 2nd at 8:45pm and Saturday, August 4th at 6pm.
