I’m humbled and honored to be a part of it.”\n\n- Rob Tovar\n\nSome of Rob's recent projects have included: Location's Stage Manager for the acclaimed CBS TV series The Redline, NBC's Chicago Fire, and films including ‘Come as you are,’ ‘Chasing the Blues,’ ‘Signature Move,’ ‘The Thing about Harry’ (for Disney's FreeForm channel), and the new hit Showtime network show ‘Work in Progress,’ in which The Hangar Film Stage was chosen for its debut season.\n\nHe also has a diverse background and relationship within the Sporting community (NBA, NFL, NHL, and MLB).

He is currently active on the Chicago Little Kids Rock Board of Directors, and on the Advisory Board for Center for Creative Entrepreneurship.\n\nRob loves to spend his spare time with family and friends. He enjoys exercise, travel, and volunteering at local food pantries.
