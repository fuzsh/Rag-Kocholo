        "text": "XXXToday is Thursday and on Thursdays we have lunch together.\n\nXXXWe talk a lot—or a lot for us. Neither of us is a person others consider talkative.\n\nXXXSometimes we even have lunch in silence. A comfortable silence, light, like the air it’s\n\nmade of, and which best expresses the flavor of what we’re eating.\n\nXXXOther times, when we do talk, the words form little mounds that slowly become\n\nmountains. Between one and the next we leave long silences: valleys in which we think as if we were walking through them.\n\nXXXWe choose a restaurant in an old house in San Telmo. It has a patio in the center, a square with its own sky, always different clouds.\n\nXXXThe conversation with my father moves at a relaxed pace.\n\nXXXSuddenly, in the middle of a phrase, he says, “…to wash rice…” and joins his hands, making a ring with his fingers, and moves them as if he were hitting something against the edge of the table.\n\nXXXWhat happens suddenly isn’t him saying these words but me realizing I don’t know how rice is cleaned. What happens suddenly is me realizing I know many things like this from him, without knowing them, only intuiting them.\n\nXXXI know that my father must be holding a bunch of something in his hands that I don’t see. I search my memory for the fields of rice that I saw in Japan, and I imagine that the bunch must be that type of green reeds.\n\nXXXI clumsily deduce that the rice must be adhering to the plants and by shaking it, it should fall. Like tiny fruits or seeds.\n\nXXXSeeing my father’s gestures I can get to the past, to Japan, or to my father’s history, which is mine. Like the impressionists, without looking for the details but rather the light, like I am familiar with the trees on the path to my house, not knowing their names, but without being able to imagine my house without them.\n\nXXXThis is how I talk with my father: safely but blindly.\n\nXXXHe says, for example, that this country is “just 200 years old,” “an infant country,” he says, and next to the infant I see an old Japan, with hands whose skin covers and reveals the shape of its bones.\n\nXXXIf he holds his head when he says that they used to run through fields of tea, I know that planes pass through the sky that I don’t see and that drop bombs.\n\nXXXWe look at the menu and choose plates that we will share. My father never got used to eating just one dish. It was my mother who adjusted to preparing various dishes for meals.\n\nXXXLater we talk about books. He is reading Mozart, by Kolb, and carries it with him wherever he goes. My father always carries a book and a dictionary with him.\n\nXXXFor me, who was born and raised in Argentina, I can’t be bothered to look up words in a dictionary. But not him. My Japanese father’s Spanish is vaster and more correct than mine.\n\nXXXHe tells me that he went to get some tests that the doctor ordered and while he waited, he read a few pages.\n\nXXX“What tests?” I ask him. “A biopsy,” he responds.\n\nXXXI’m worried. I feel what is lurking, and a certainty like knowing night will fall each day, a type of vertigo. Everything I hadn’t asked over the years comes back to me. Every question comes and brings others. I want to know why my father chose this country, this infant country. I want to know what it was like the day he learned the war had started, what every one of the days that followed was like until the day he got to this land. I want to know what his toys and his clothes were like, what it was like to go to school during the war, what the port of Buenos Aires was like in the 70s, if he wrote letters to my grandmother, what did they say. I want to know the colors, the words, the smell of foods, the houses he lived in. Once he told me that shortly after he had arrived, he didn’t get into the bathtub but instead washed himself beside it and only submerged himself in the water when he was clean because that is how they do it in Japan. Like that, I want him to tell me more. Much more. Everything. I want him to tell me about every day, so no time is wasted. Maybe to write it: leave it to take root with ink on paper forever. Where to start? Where do the questions start? Which is the first?\n\nXXXI look inside, as if I were lost running in this valley of silence that had suddenly opened between words. To lose yourself in a place so vast seems like a prison.\n\nXXXWhen I stop looking, I see the question before me as if it had been waiting for me. I look at my father and ask my question.\n\nXXXHe smiles, takes a paper from between the pages of his book and a black pen out of the pocket of the cardigan he is wearing. He draws lines very close together, some parallel and others that cross. Then another, perpendicular and wavy, that cuts through them close to one end. They are the rice plants in water. Then he makes some very small circles at the ends: the grains. He tells me that they fill up and retraces the lines but instead of straight, they’re curvy at the ends: the plants when the rice matures. “The fuller one is, the more cultivated it is, the humbler,” he says. “One bows like the rice plant under the weight of the grains.” Then he reaches out his hands and his arms and moves them in parallel to the floor. “They would lay big cloths over the field,” he says. I imagine them white, barely rippling, like water moves when it’s calm.\n\nXXXHe goes back to holding his hands as if he were holding a bundle and shakes it like before, against the edge of the table. Now I see it clearly, I can almost touch, the grains of rice that fall away.\n\nHe knows how to keep his customers happy. He thrusts two cardamom pods into a child’s hand; he unwraps the shawl from his shoulders and lays it on the ground for his customers to sit on; he takes the trouble to arrange a paan for someone else. And in this manner, he reassures those who come to sell to him: ‘Ajji, I will recover at least two rupees from the torn pieces of this mat; this broken spittoon will sell for a full two and a half rupees; and spending twenty paise worth of polish on these sandals will make them as good as new.’\n\nGafoor rambles on, convincing people he will sell their items for a considerable sum before they leave for Pakistan.\n\nAnd over there? Over there—it is heaven on earth; they will be given the best— beautifully decorated houses with electric fans and quality furniture, a retinue of servants, shining cars, the finest jobs. Those who stand on the margins of society today will be in a position of power tomorrow, enjoying the luxuries of life, marching ahead.\n\nHearing such tempting tales convinces many to sell off even the items they can easily carry, like handheld mirrors, cups and plates, knives and forks, coats and quilts.\n\nThoughts swirl in Gafoor’s mind. Pakistan…? I wonder how it will be. And the cities where so many people are rushing off to? Leaving their homes and jobs—they aren’t stupid, are they? They are all well-educated and intelligent. They say they’ll get large houses and bungalows to live in, jobs in prominent positions. An ordinary telegraph clerk or postman today will become a collector or commissioner tomorrow in Pakistan. Those staying in slums today will get palaces to live in, those who walk barefoot today will fly in motor vehicles, and then there’s me—despite twisting the truth, I still take home a pittance. Oh, the expenses have become unbearable. And Hamida doesn’t stop nagging me—get a necklace made for me, and so on. As if we’ll need such things over there—a land where gold is available at the price of silver. Here, even after slaving for a full year, one can only afford a nose ring worth a gram of gold. We’ve heard that the Congress party will make houses for the poor here; but a house is a house. Maybe they’ll build something better than a thatched hut, perhaps covering it with tin sheets or even levelling the roof flat. But in front of the palatial bungalows over there, what is a mere house?"
