        "text": "— Winner’s announced at Red Carpet Press Conference —\n\nLos Angeles, CA — The Beverly Hills/Hollywood NAACP branch has recognized the exceptional impact African Americans have contributed to the world of live theater. On Sunday March 6, 2016, winners of the 2015 NAACP Theatre Awards were announced and celebrated during a star-studded Red Carpet Press Conference at the Nate Holden Performing Arts Theatre/Ebony Repertory Theatre located at 4718 W. Washington Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90016.\n\nA phenomenal night acknowledging thespians in the world of black theatre began with an inviting Red Carpet and reception catered by popular local chef Gwen Vance.

Her performance was a play read in itself.\n\nAs celebrity announcers Jason George (Grey’s Anatomy), Ella Joyce (Theatre, TV and film veteran), Richard Lawson (Saints and Sinners), Obba Babatunde’, Renee Lawless (The Haves and Have Nots), and Harold Bell (Raising Whitley) made their way to the stage to honor the contributions of the most stellar theatrical performances, the nominees waited with bated breath. Each celebrity announcer, all with a history in theatre themselves, stressed the necessity to support and fund playhouses, playwrights, producers, directors, etc. so that they may continue to present great narratives, inclusive of black stories alive on stage. Black stories are American stories highlighting a culture that has made great contributions and helped to define the identity of this great Nation.\n\nNabbing 3 out of 6 nominations in Equity Theatre is the political-racially charged production, Above the Fold receiving Best Female Lead for Taraji P. Henson, Best Producer – The Pasadena Playhouse and Best Supporting Female – Kristy Johnson.

Du Bois. First time nominee Jaimyon Parker scored Best Sound and Leonard Thomas attained Best Lead Male for Bus Stops which takes the audience on a surprising and emotional journey dissecting stereotypical boundaries that occur at two different bus stops. Wrapping up the local category and securing a win for Best Supporting Male is veteran television, film and stage thespian Brent Jennings for Closely Related Keys.\n\nSeveral local politicians and entertainment supporters joined the festivities including, Actress KiKi Shepard, Actress Tonya R.
