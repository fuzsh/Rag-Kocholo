        "text": "CHICAGO, Oct. 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- McCaffery Interests, in partnership with Chicago production company Bitter Jester Creative, is proud to announce that its recent film, Full Circle, has received six Chicago/Midwest Emmy® nominations. The documentary, a pitch for consideration to host the Obama Presidential Library, tells the story of the old South Works steel plant and the master plan for the vacant land on which it used to reside. Full Circle was nominated for Outstanding Achievements in Writing, Directing, Editing, Audio, and Public/Current Affairs Programming.\n\nAdditionally, Full Circle garnered an Outstanding Performance nomination for celebrated film and TV actor Dennis Haysbert (Major League, 24, Allstate spokesman), who narrates the film. This is the very first Emmy® nomination of Mr. Haysbert's career.\n\nAlways on the forefront, McCaffery Interests views new media as a way to reach the increasingly sophisticated and changing audiences in today's digital age.\n\n\"We wanted to create a film that went beyond its initial purpose of pitching Chicago Lakeside as a great spot for the Obama Library,\" says Dan McCaffery, CEO. \"And 'Full Circle' did just that. Even though the library won't be built at Lakeside, 'Full Circle' continues to prove that video content is a powerful tool for exploring the future of thoughtful real estate development, investment, and management in Chicago and in the United States as a whole.\"\n\nOn Saturday, November 7th, the 57th Annual Chicago/Midwest Emmy Awards Ceremony will be broadcast live from the Redmoon Theater on Chicago's CLTV and Milwaukee's WITI 6.2 digital channel.\n\nMcCaffery Interests is a twenty-five year old, privately owned, full-service commercial real estate company in the business of investing, developing, leasing, and managing real estate. With offices in Chicago, IL and Washington, DC, the McCaffery Interests portfolio of planned, completed, and managed projects exceeds 20 million square feet and includes office, mixed-use, hotel, and residential properties, as well as large, master-planned communities and land developments.\n\nBitter Jester Creative is a fifteen-year old, four-time Emmy® award-winning production company with an altruistic and community focus. Bitter Jester Creative also received two additional 2015 Emmy® nominations: one for Commercial Editing for Affy Tapple, and one for Short Form Writing for a series of parodies aired during last year's Chicago/Midwest Emmys.\n\nSOURCE McCaffery Interests, Inc.\n\nRelated Links"
