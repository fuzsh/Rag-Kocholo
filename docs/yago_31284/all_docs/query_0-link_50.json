Info from courses@standupanddeliver.com (or see the Courses & Training page, for general information about courses)\n\n2004\n\nAmusedMooseComedy had a high profile for shows featuring the very top stand-ups and for bringing thrusting new comedy talent to the Edinburgh Fringe in 2004. The following bears testament to just how busy we were.\n\nAmusedMooseComedy and StandUp And Deliver produced 7 shows, including the Absolute & Almost Beginners comedy course and showcase (daytimes) - see our Courses+Training page for more information. (Page 15 of the Fringe programme)\n\nFor the first time the AmusedMooseComedy STAR SEARCH 2004 final (hosted by Time Out awardwinner Stephen K Amos) took place during the Edinburgh Fringe, showcasing brilliant stars-in-the-making ... and your vote counted! Held in one of the best rooms in Edinburgh - on 17 August at 10.45 in the Cabaret bar in the Pleasance Courtyard. (Page 18 of the Fringe programme)\n\nThe finalists were among 20 or so highly entertaining and original new comedians we have been nurturing during the last year, who performed for five nights each in AmusedMooseComedy's Hot Starlets - no two nights will be the same. Scotland's very own Logan Murray compered in his own inimitable style as Ronnie Rigsby. These shows are always a great talent-spotting opportunity ... Rhod Gilbert (runner-up in our Star Search final) was spotted in Hot Starlets in 2003 and invited to appear in the Adelaide comedy festival. Following sellout shows in 2003 at the Assembly Rooms, and in 2002 at Underbelly, in 2004 AmusedMooseComedy's Hot Starlets were in residence at Pleasance Joker Dome at 9.45 nightly. (Page 18 of the Fringe programme)\n\nThere are two solo shows under the Moose banner this year.\n\nMatt Dyktynski - Pole Dancer (in Pleasance Courtyard at 8.15) already had a bit of a buzz going, and transferred fast to Soho Theatre for a short runs in Sept/Oct, so was seen as a show \"not to be missed\". (Page 47 of the Fringe programme and www.mattdyktynski.com)\n\nand Doniert Macfarlane in Colin Montgomery Stole My Life (at C's Oxygen venue in Infirmary Street at 6.55 - page 30 of the Fringe programme) which was nominated for the Richard Pryor Award.\n\nIn Gilded Balloon Caves II (off Cowgate) four young comediennes - a children's television presenter, a successful novelist, an award-winning screen writer, and an actress - had everyone high on laughter in their show \"Four Queens Poker Club\" at 10.55. Kirsten O'Brien, Abigail Burdess, Issy Bordsky and Ruth Bratt performed at the atmospheric Caves venues. (Page 33 of the Fringe programme)\n\nAnd finally we repeated the successful formula of last years Afterhours show, as a co-production with Pleasance. Jason Byrne said it was \"Brilliant - the best show on the Fringe\" in 2003. Not surprisingly we booked him back for a number of these late night shows in Pleasance Dome Cabaret bar, which has the atmosphere of a sociable, goodnatured, high energy comedy club atmosphere which the comedians relish and the audiences adore.\n\nLast years comedians also included such late night luminaries as Ross Noble, Ed Byrne, Flight of the Conchords, Reg D Hunter, Adam Hills, Demetri Martin, Jimmy Carr, Dara O'Briain, and many many more. We will be improving even on that this year without doubt - the comedians are clamouring to do the gig and we're almost having to fight them off with sticks! (Page 15 of the Fringe programme)\n\nSee you up there! Come up and say hello --- look out for the AmusedMoose t-shirts!\n\nHils, Rachel, Clair, Ian and Carole\n\n2003\n\nAmusedMooseComedy was very busy at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2003, and the following shows we produced bears testament to just how busy we were.\n\nAbsolute & Almost Beginners intensive comedy course (over 5 days, daytimes, at the end of the Fringe, including performing in a showcase. (Details in yellow below, and pages 14 and 159 of the Fringe programme) In the event these courses produced the winner of both the C4 So You Think You' re Funny competition Tom Wrigglesworth, and the winner of the BBC New Comedy Award Rhod Gilbert who was runner-up in the Jongleurs Spike Award, the winner of which had been runner-up in the BBC in 2000! The course was represented by 3 BBC finalists and 3 C4 SYTYF finalists which we thought was wonderful as the courses have only been running for 18 months!\n\nJerry Sadowitz is one of the Fringe' s institutions. Jerry Sadowitz: The Midnight Show hits the stage of George Square Theatre on five nights only (20-24 Aug) at 23.59, with his unique brand of stand-up comedy. Billed as the world' s most offensive/offended comedian he is one of Scotland' s much loved, and respected sons who is always welcomed back with open arms. (No magic show this year, but Jerry will doubtless include a few somewhat larger and therefore more visible tricks to enthrall and maybe provoke just a little!). Fringe programme: page 36\n\nAmusedMooseComedy was informally involved in producing a very successful late evening show in 2002 (see archived report on last year' s Amused Moose shows at the Fringe, underneath the section in yellow below) at a venue which had asked us to programme all their comedy shows - we were chuffed that it was the only one in Edinburgh where Bill Bailey who was just in town for 24 hours performed! We' ll be bringing you even more comedy delights and surprises and unique performances this year at Afterhours at Pleasance Dome. 12 shows starting at 1am, with mad drinks prices beforehand and music after, and the very best comedians on the Fringe and some who are up in Edinburgh just to do these shows - you'll be used to how we magic up amazing comedians at AmusedMooseSoho (where did you see Eddie Izzard a few months back, for example, twice in the same week, and Al Murray and Ricky Gervais on the same bill, just before the Fringe!). And we' ll be bringing that same programming skill to Afterhours, which is a co-pro between the Moose and Pleasance, so you absolutely know it' ll be great fun, great value and a very well run comedy club-type of night, but even better because we' ll all be in Edinburgh, in a great comedy room with an excellent bar actually in the room - how many other Fringe comedy rooms can offer you that! The answer - none! Buy tickets ahead of times, as once the words out they will definitely be selling out! Page 14 of the Fringe programme (search for Afterhours on the EdFringe website as bizarrely it isn' t alphabeticallylisted there)\n\nHal Cruttenden - To Hal And Back. Hal was a Perrier Newcomer Nominee last year, and is planning a bigger triumph this year at Pleasance Dome 3 at 20.20 most evenings. And it promises 20.20 vision! (We' ve no idea what that means, but it was too good to leave out!). Pages 32 and 165 in the Fringe programme.\n\nAmusedMooseComedy' s Hot Starlets was a hugely successful show in 2002, so transferred this year straight to a prime timeslot in a delightful room at the premier Fringe venue, the Assembly Rooms. Over 20 rising stars, who have shown us their metal at AmusedMooseSoho comedy club over the last nine months or so, will be showcased for professional talentscouts and amateur talentspotters at 23.45 every evening from 1 to 24 August, in the Wildman Room at The Assembly Rooms. Five comedians every night, with a constantly changing roster, so that you can come to see the show again and again but never see the same five twice. Amongst these 20+ are winners of many recent comedy competitions (Leicester and London comedy Festival, Hackney New Acts, Paramount and so on) and finalists too, who will be in finals of the three competitions in Edinburgh during the Fringe. (Page 15 and 159 of the Fringe programme).\n\nNever slow to find something different to offer, AmusedMooseComedy went all the way to the Aspen Comedy Festival to source and bring back a very entertaining film about comedy, Bitter Jester. This could become one of those Fringe hot tickets ---- just two screenings on 13 August (at 3.30 and 6pm) at the lovely art deco Dominion cinema in Morningside, with a Q&A betweentimes with Maija di Giorgio who directs and stars in the film, and Kenny Simmons the Producer. Many US comedy icons (such as Whoopi Goldberg) are interviewed and give their perspectives on stand-up. This happens within a diary documentary format, showing the life and struggles of a new standup comedian who is befriended by comedian and actor Richard Belzer (from National Lampoon with John Belushi etc etc) who is the lynchpin (and Executive Producer) by introducing her to big name comedians, and getting her backstage at the Montreal Comedy Festival and onto film lots in LA, award ceremonies, benefits and Las Vegas, as well as the New York comedy clubs you' ll recognise. It was voted very enjoyable, interesting and entertaining at it' s first non-US showing, at the London Comedy Festival, with Frank Skinner, Andre Vincent, Jo Caulfield and many other comedians in the audience ---- lots of groans, cheers and sniggers. The best Ã'Â£5-worth on the Fringe. Reviewed on www.chortle.co.uk . Fringe programme, pages 19 and 159\n\nKids Are Best. John Ryan, who is well established not only as a stand-up but also as a children' s writer, director and entertainer will be delighting youngsters and their parents/teachers alike, now daily from 3 August at 12.45 at the Pleasance Courtyard. Don' t miss him. Big kids will enjoy it too - you' re all welcome. There will be games, songs, music, stories - all of which will demonstrate that Kids Are Best. Fringe programme: page 10\n\nPerrier newcomer nominee Andrew Clover will be back to delight absolutely everyone with his show Andrew Clover, Supercub at Pleasance Courtyard' s Cavern at 9.45pm most evenings from 30 July to 25 Aug. You may have seen Andrew-the-actor quite a lot on television recently --- that' s how life is, you decide to focus on your stand-up career and then everyone casts you in every telly series and sitcom and comedy pilot that has been commissioned recently including Simon Day' s sitcom \"Grass\" (well that' s how it seems, not that we are complaining of course). Andrew has previewed his show from as far afield as Southsea and Birmingham to Bath and Aldburgh, finetuning it to delight his enthusiastic loyal Fringe audiences, who have made his previous 5 star shows into sellouts. (pages 15 and 63).\n\nRichard Belzer (above) was to be in Edinburgh to also promote the film Bitter Jester that he is involved with and appears in, and entertain for just three shows only at Sweet at CrownePlaza on the High St at 9.45pm on 10, 11 and 12 August, and it' d have been the hottest ticket in town, as he performed his upcoming HBO Comedy Special just for a select band of Fringe goers. (Pages 52 and 159 of the Fringe programme). Howeve due to an unexpected major film contract his show has sadly had to be altered, so now will be hosted by Maija di Giorgio with special guests including Tina Kim who started out in the same clubs as Maija (see Bitter Jester, above) and now is hugely successful on the US college circuit too. Tix for Maija di Giorgio and friends will be £10 (£8.50 concessions)\n\nTo book Fringe tickets online by credit/debit/switch card go to www.edfringe.com (though to enrol for the comedy course you can call 07970 524 234 if you prefer OR email course@standupanddeliver.com)\n\n2002\n\nThe Edinburgh Fringe 2002 is now history of course but we thought we' d leave this up on the website for reference, and nostalgia' s sake! Highlights included a Perrier nomination for Hal Cruttenden, a sellout run from Stewart Lee in the Traverse Theatre's comedy strand, and AmusedMooseComedy' s Hot Starlets containing all the winners and runners up in the four competitions on the Fringe! - hooray\n\nSo much to tell and so little time! AmusedMooseComedy had a great time in Edinburgh - some sell-out shows (including James Campbell's children's comedy show, Jerry Sadowitz's magic show, and AmusedMooseComedy's Hot Starlets - many of the new comics you've been seeing at the Moose over the past months), and a Perrier newcomer nomination for Hal Cruttenden's first solo show ---- plus loads and loads of five and four star reviews ... oh yes and working with Neil Masters we had the most fantastic bills for the Underbelly Late Shows - just about all the big names including the only stand-up set of the Fringe from Bill Bailey himself. It was great - if you didn't make it you'll be able to see some of the shows and other Fringe shows that stood out from the crowd at the Moose pretty soon, or at various festivals we've been invited to put shows on at (Brighton, Leicester and Jersey so far, and we've only been back 5 days!!)\n\nA big highlight at the Fringe was that our enthusiasm and support for new comedians has paid off ---- all the winners of Edinburgh competitions were in the final of AmusedMoose Talent Quest, and they and all the runners up, and probably all of the London-based finalists in the competitions were among the 21 new comedians that were on the rota (at 5 a day, rotating) for our AmusedMooseComedy's Hot Starlets show. So who did win what? ... BBC was won by Nina Conti, with Dylan and Stefano Paolini as runners up; Daily Telegraph Open Mic was won by Mark Watson with Stan Stanley as runner-up; SoYouThinkYou'reFunny was won by Matthew Osborn with Nina and Mark as runners-up; and Wilkinson's was won by Dylan. So Nina, Dylan, Matthew and Mark are the mainstays of the AmusedMooseComedy's Hot Starlets that are being booked into festivals (most shows will have 5 comedians as the show did on the Fringe), sometimes with Stan and Gary Delaney, plus Patrick Monahan and Steve Williams who will compere between them ... it's never easy to get five comedians available simultaneously but thankfully we do have a willing and eager troup of quality new comedians to draw on.\n\nAnd now the news from before the Fringe 2002 ...\n\nSo much happening this year (2002) at the Edinburgh Fringe!\n\nThere will be over 50 Edinburgh previews at AmusedMooseSoho from mid-June to late July, and lots of shows in Edinburgh too! Details follow about those Edinburgh shows (which include the legendary Jerry Sadowitz btw) followed by the exciting announcement about our comedy course during the Fringe that anyone can participate in!
