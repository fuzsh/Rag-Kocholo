        "text": "Cory Popp\n\nBitter Jester Music Festival Judge\n\nCory Popp spent his childhood in Kentuckiana snapping photos on a Canon AE-1 program his mother had given him and creating short films on a VHS camcorder his father owned. Through his high school years and well into his twenties he spent time playing in bands like Kodan Armada, In Tongues, and Matt Pond PA, touring extensively throughout the US.\n\nWhen back in Louisville, he spent time volunteering at various venues and organizations, while also booking and promoting shows for touring bands coming through. He eventually left and pursued an education in Cinematography at Columbia College in Chicago, where he received his BA in Film/Video, graduating Magna Cum Laude. He has since spent the last eight years shooting music videos, documentaries, television programs, and commercials.\n\nCory has filmed for record labels like Atlantic, Scion A/V, and De Stijl; networks like HBO, Discovery, Travel Channel, National Geographic, TLC, MTV, Animal Planet, Fox Sports, and PBS; and companies like Samsung, Kuwait Oil Company, Vans, Finish Line, Reebok, Discover, and Sargento. His first feature film as a Director of Photography, Ellie Lumme, premiered at New York’s BAMcinemaFest in 2014 and went on to play Cucaloris, Unknown Pleasures and BFI London. He currently resides in Chicago, IL, but travels extensively, seeking out the best shots from around the world.\n\nHe still has his Sunn Coliseum, Traynor 8x10, Fender Jazz, and a willingness to turn it up to 11 and let the bass rattle all of the windows in his Logan Square apartment complex."
