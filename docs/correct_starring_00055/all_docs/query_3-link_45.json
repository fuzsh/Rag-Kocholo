        "text": "Film Appearances\n\nHancock made just five film appearances in his career. The first as a supporting player, the next 2 as a star and the final 2 as a guest artist.\n\nThe films are listed below.\n\nOrders Are Orders 1954\n\nHancock appeared in this film as a supporting player and played the role of Bandmaster. The film is loosely based on a play from 1932.\n\nThe barracks at Bilchester are taken over by Waggermeyer Pictures in order to make a science fiction film. The female stars of the film persuade the entire barracks to take part but the Divisional Commander makes a surprise inspection and is not impressed! In the end he persuades the film company to finish the film in a nearby haunted house.\n\nMain cast comprised Margot Grahame, Maureen Swanson, June Thorburn, Raymond Huntley, Bill Fraser, Peter Sellers, Brian Reece, Sid James and Tony Hancock.\n\nDirector: David Paltenghi; Producer: Donald Taylor\n\nScreenplay by Donald Taylor and Geoffrey Orme based on the play by Ian Hay and Anthony Armstrong.\n\nLength: 78 Minutes\n\nThis film has been released on video and DVD. Please see the Video and DVD releases pages for more information.\n\nFilming location stills can be seen on the website Reel Streets.\n\nThe Rebel 1960\n\nWritten by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, this was Hancock's first star appearance in a film.\n\nHancock is bored with his work routine and in his Landlady's lack of understanding of his painting and, more especially, his sculpting. After a disagreement with his boss, he leaves his job and moves to Paris where he is accepted by the local artistic set. He shares a room with Paul who is a genuinely good painter, but when Hancock's paintings are praised by the local artistic set, Paul returns to London.\n\nSubsequently, Paul's paintings are mistakenly attibuted to Hancock by an art critic and Hancock finds himself declared as a great painter and is commissioned to produce a statue of a rich patron's wife.\n\nWhen Hancock reproduces the terrible sculpture that he had produced in London, it is not received well! Meantime, the art critic tells Hancock that he has secured a new exhibition for him in London but Hancock has no paintings to fill the exhibition.\n\nDesperate, he asks Paul if he has continued to paint since his return to London and arranges for Paul's new paintings to be used for the exhibition. Hancock is shocked to discover that Paul has started to paint in Hancock's childish style but the paintings are once again acclaimed.\n\nHancock tells the art critic that Paul is the real painter and returns to his Landlady and starts sculplting again with his Landlady as a model\n\nThis film effectively sees the Hancock BBC TV character re-created for the big screen. Ray and Alan went on to write a follow-up film script for Hancock, also based on his TV character, called The Day Off. This script was rejected by Hancock as not 'international enough' and he parted company with Ray and Alan at this point. His follow-up film (detailed below) was The Punch & Judy Man, but this really didn't have the international flavour that Hancock so desired.\n\nMain Cast comprised: Tony Hancock, George Sanders, Paul Massie, Margit Saad, Gregoire Aslan, Dennis Price, Irene Handl, Mervyn Johns, Peter Bull, John Le Mesurier, Liz Fraser. Mario Fabrizi, Nanette Newman, Marie Burke, Marie Devereux and John Wood.\n\nDirector: Robert Day; Producer: W. A.

However, his wife Deliah (Sylvia Sims) has social aspirations and when the Council plans an official reception for the local dignitary Lady Jane Caterham after she has switched on the local illuminations, she persuades Wally to give a Punch & Judy performance at the reception after the Mayoress (unknown to the Mayor) has invited him.\n\nUnfortunately, the reception ends up in a fight involving most of the guests and with it Deliah's chance of climbing the social ladder gone.
