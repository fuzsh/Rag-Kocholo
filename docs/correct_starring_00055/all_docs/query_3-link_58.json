        "text": "Just for fun, how many Carry On actors and actresses can be find that have appeared in Last of the Summer Wine?\n\nThis includes all the bit players and less known people.\n\nHere's two to start the ball rolling:\n\nFrank Thornton (Truly and Carry On Screaming)\n\nJohn Bluthal (Brushes at Dawn and Carry On Follow That Camel)\n\nLiz Fraser been in several Carry On's Regardless , Cruising etc and was of course was Reggie Unsworth Compo's Thursday lady . Norman Rossington was in Carry on Nurse, Regardless and of course was Mr Microwave in Beware the Elbow .I mentioned John Jardine who was a guard Carry on Spying and was Billy Pilsworth in the Afterthoughts of a Coop Manager amongst other appearances in LOTSW\n\nBrian Rawlinson was the traffic warden in 3 episodes from the 1990s (a semi regular who was possibly planned for more appearances) and was in Carry On Cruising, Carry On Cleo and Carry On Cowboy.\n\nMargaret Nolan, Connie in LOTSW episode Pate and Chips, was also in Carry On Dick, Carry On Girls, Carry On Matron, Carry On At Your Convenience, Carry On Henry and Carry On Cowboy.\n\nBurt Kwouk was of course Entwistle in LOTSW and sadly for such a great actor , he was in the wonderful Pink Panther films for god sake, he was in the atrocious Carry on Columbus\n\nLynda Baron (Getting Sam Home) was also in Carry On Columbus.\n\nNorman Mitchell from Beware of the Oglethorpe played a drunk in Carry On Emmannuelle.\n\nVery good question to pose wstol!\n\nKenneth Cole was in The Love Mobile & All That Glitters is not Elvis, he appeared in numerous Carry On Films including, Carry On Jack, Nurse & At your Convenience and probably more.....\n\nOn the subject of the Carry On's I'm reading the Kenneth Williams official biography, I think he would've been a wonderful in a role in LOTSW! Interestingly he also acted with Peter Sallis in an Orson Wells play."
