        "text": "Be careful of what you ask for: you might get it.\n\nI Only Arsked is an interesting film, though only in what it is, not the watching of it. It’s a 1958 black-and-white British comedy film, released the same year as Carry on Sergeant, the first film in the long-running Carry On series, which had a similar theme but, unlike Carry On Sergeant, it was based on an existing property, the very popular sitcom The Army Game.\n\nThe Army Game debuted in 1957 and ran for four thirty-nine episode series until 1961. It was ITV’s first sitcom and was incredibly popular, spawning books, a board game, a top 5 hit single, an equally popular spin-off (Bootsie and Snudge) and, of course, a film. It wasn’t until the Seventies that film versions of successful sitcoms became a fad, so I Only Arsked was a ground-breaker on that score too.\n\nThe ‘sit’ of the series was based on the still-extant National Service (not ended until 1960). Four useless conscripts share hut 29 at a General Supplies depot spending all their time devising ways to do as little as possible (shades of Sgt Bilko). I don’t think I’ve ever seen an episode of it though I loved Bootsie and Snudge as a kid. But it was big.\n\nThe film re-unites most of the original cast: Michael medwin as the conniving spiv-like Corporal Spring, Norman Rossington as the Scouser Private ‘Cupcake’ Cook, Charles Hawtrey as the over-intelligent Private ‘Professor’ Hatchett, Alfie Bass as the flat-footed Private Montague ‘Excused Boots’ Bisley and Bernard Bresslaw as the intellectually challenged and very tall Private ‘Popeye’ Popplewell. The film was a quick cash-in as Rossington, Hawtrey and Bresslaw all left the sitcom after the first series. The only major absentee was William Hartnell as the red-hot disciplinarian Sergeant Major Bullimore, who was replaced in the film by David Lodge as Sergeant Major ‘Potty’ Chambers. Hartnell, incidentally, played the same role as the titular Sergeant of the Carry On film.\n\nIt’s interesting to see I Only Arsked anticipating the ploy used by so many writers in the Seventies to totally bog up their sitcom spin-off films, by taking the cast out of the usual environment and sending them abroad. The British Middle-East Protectorate of Daruwa (spelling?) calls for troops to protect it. King Fazim is drilling for oil to enrich his people (yeah, right) but the moment he strikes it rich, he will be deposed by his evil brother Mahmoud (a browned-up Francis Matthews). Though the British Resident strives hard to convince him he’s got a Brigade of Guards, the truth is he’s got Hut 29 plus Chambers and C/O Major Upshott-Bagley (Geoffrey Sumner, who also left after series 1)\n\nThere’s no real point in descriing the plot, which is rudimentary and prone to cliches. Mahmoud and his rebels are played seriously but as Saturday morning serialbaddies, the gang clump about, there’s a harem for them to break into via a tunnel constructed by the last British troops to be stationed here in 1892, and there’s a horribly trite and racist portrayal of an Arabian wheeler-dealer that I was shocked to find carried out by Michael Bentine: ghastly. The harem, incidentally, offers the only female roles in the entire film, about two dozen gorgeous girls who between them get to utter precisely zero words of dialogue.\n\nThe Army Game turned Bresslaw into what we’d now call the ‘break-out’ star (though as it ultimately led to his becoming a Carry On star, I’d query the exact extent of what it did for him). The film supposedly centres upon him – Bresslaw is the first named cast and the film’s title is his catchphrase, though it’s only used once, as the last three words of dialogue – but he didn’t come over as especially featured to me. Though as he was 6′ 7″ tall, he did stand out onscreen.\n\nThe main thing is that, however funny The Army Game was in its day, it isn’t funny now. I mustered one laugh and one half-suppressed giggle in its 75 minute length, though given the Seventies sitcom films, that’s not so bad an average (honourable exceptions: The Lovers, Dad’s Army and Porridge, as you might expect). It wasn’t so bad as to make me want to switch off (except in Bentine’s scenes) but it did do a brilliant job of exposing nostalgia as what it so often is: wishful thinking turned up until the knobs fall off.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThey don’t make films like this anymore.\n\nActually, I think there was only one time when they could make films like this, and that was 1964, so it was a good job they made it then. And despite all the things that have happened since, such as the passing of 59 years, to date it, A Hard Day’s Night remains remarkably fresh, and alive. Watching it is like slipping into a bubble of preserved time and breathing the air of then, the only problem being the return to 2023 when the recording ends.\n\nWatching the film this morning had its drawbacks. I was watching an upload to YouTube that, in order to evade copyright restrictions, had been ‘modified’ to 0.5x speed. This was not a problem as all I had to do was change settings to play at 2x speed. But the film was cut, a few seconds here, a few seconds there, lines and notes flensed from some, but not all of the song performances. And, most curious of all, the entire mid-film performance of ‘Can’t Buy Me Love’ was removed from the soundtrack, leaving the Beatles to perform their running and jumping antics in the park in dead silence. But the song’s reprise in the closing concert session was broadcast loud and clear. Wierd, I say, wierd.\n\nA Hard Day’s Night was a cash-in, an exploitation of the group’s fame, a step on the road to becoming ‘all-round entertainers’ who would survive the end of the inevitably ephemeral Merseybeat boom. At least, that was the intent. Messrs Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starkey (Starr) were to be presented as they were, in the midst of their existence, in the midst of being The Beatles. This kind of presentation was chosen, no doubt, to reflect their incredible popularity and to accomodate thair limitations as untrained actors. The beatles would play The Beatles, saying and doing what they said and did anyway. Liverpool playwright Alun Owen was hired to script the film, and provide dialogue that mirrored what the four Moptops would have said anyway. Between the naturalness of what they were asked to say and do, and the internal confidence buoying up their innate Scouse personalities, John, Paul, George and Ringo came over as themselves. It didn’t hurt that they were playing the public personae they portrayed on a daily basis anyway.\n\nAnd they were a bloody sight better than Gerry and The Pacemakers or The Dave Clark Five in their movies.\n\nThe film was directed by Richard Lester, who would go on to direct the band’s less successful sequel, Help! and the theatrical Superman 2. He gets a lot of praise for the innovations he brought to filming in this movie: the pace, the cutting, the hand-held cameras, the movement. Watching in the Twenty-First Century, the whole film feels familiar, yet these were all techniques that 1964 would have found strange and new.\n\nA Hard Day’s Night was shot quickly and on a low budget, none of which shows. The Beatles are the centre and they’re supplemented by some very familiar professional figures of the time, such as Norman Rossington and John Junkin, as their managers and Victor Spinetti as the TV Director, but the primary figure is Wilfred Branbell playing Paul’s Irish Grandfather, a ‘mixer’ of the first water. Brambell had ht stardom the year before as Albert Steptoe in Galton and Simpson’s classic Steptoe and Son, an arhetypal ‘dirty old man’, hence the constant, in-joke references to him in the film as being very clean, which would have had contemporary audiences roaring their heads off.\n\nThe film has its serious side, not that it shows it off, satirising the life The Beatles lead, under constant pressure from their fans, unable to be free to just do anything natural or normal, except when they escape. That’s left to be absorbed, silently, subliminally. And there are moments, little throwaways, brief surrealities, that had me laughing uproariously, even as I saw them coming.\n\nBut what of the music? That’s what a Beatles film was going to be about and these were brilliant. The film and the album and the songs written for it represent a turning point for the band. The album would be the first to consist only of band originals, without rock’n’roll and early Motown covers. The Beatles were still the young, unaffected, instant band, producing a stream of instant pop/rock records that had no thought other than fun, excitement, energy and all the myriad angles on love. They’re still naive at heart in their music. But this is the hinge-point. This film captures the Beatles on the point of growing up, still inspired by the rock’n’roll of their youth but beginning to see the potential for bigger and better things. A Hard Day’s Night is the doorway to Revolver and Rubber Soul. Here, they’re still playing, and still captivated by playing, and they can still give ‘She Loves You’ every bit of their force. This is where their eyes start to open, where they start to tell themselves there can – and will – be more than this.\n\nFlaws in the upload or no flaws, this was a glorious way to spend Sunday morning. By now, the film’s almost a social documentary, but if they were all as alive as this, there would be a lot more of them worth absorbing.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
