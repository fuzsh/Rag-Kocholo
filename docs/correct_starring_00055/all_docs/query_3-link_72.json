        "text": "Fifty years ago US film distributors fancied making a quick buck exploiting a British band they dismissed as a passing fad.\n\nThey wanted a low-budget film about The Beatles to be thrown together in a few weeks to cash in on “a brief craze”, reports the Sunday People.\n\nBut baffled by the Scouse accents, they demanded the Fab Four were dubbed with mid-Atlantic voices.\n\nFortunately for all of us Paul McCartney refused, saying: “If we can understand f***ing cowboys talking Texas, they can understand us talking Liverpool.”\n\nThe result was the Oscar-nominated box-office smash A Hard Day’s Night, made for just £200,000 using hand-held cameras and now considered the greatest rock’n’roll film ever made.\n\nAnd it is set to win a new generation of fans when a digitally remastered ­cinema ­version is released across Britain and America on Friday to mark its golden anniversary.\n\nToday the 87-minute black and white film is ranked in the world’s top 100.\n\nBut in 1964 The Beatles were reckoned to be no more than nine-day wonders.\n\nUnited Artists only agreed to distribute a Beatles’ movie in America if it was made quickly.\n\nEven in the UK few thought McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr had staying power – despite a string of No1 hits and an army of screaming girl fans.\n\nIndeed the film – originally called Beatlemania but retitled after Ringo called a marathon recording session “a hard day’s night” – became a parody of the band’s overnight fame.\n\nScripted by Alun Owen, who grew up in Liverpool and spent weeks hanging out with The Beatles, it portrayed them as four likeable lads amazed at the adulation they receive wherever they go.\n\nIt opens with real fans chasing the group on to a train bound for London.\n\nOnce there, the boys are told by their manager to stay inside their hotel while they prepare for a performance.\n\nBut of course they disobey – and have a string of comic misadventures with disapproving authority figures.\n\nThe Beatles’ band-name isn’t spoken once in the film, although it’s briefly seen on Ringo’s drum kit at the end.\n\nAnd when John meets a secretary who thinks he looks like someone famous, they have a surreal conversation about how much he looks like “him” – without saying who they are referring to.\n\nThe Fab Four aside, the film is a who’s who of well-known British entertainers from the 1950s and 60s.\n\nSteptoe & Son star Wilfred Bramble is Paul’s touble-making grandad and got rave reviews in America, where no one knew who he was.\n\nThe script often refers to how clean he looks – a sly nod to his “dirty old man” character in the rag-and-bone sitcom.\n\nStage actor Victor Spinetti plays a panicky TV director whose fluffy sweater sparks innuendos about his sexuality.\n\nDancer Lionel Blair pops up as a ­choreographer and comedy stalwart Deryck Guyler is an officious cop.\n\nNorman Rossington was an established star when he signed, having been in Carry On films, the Titanic epic A Night To Remember and Lawrence Of Arabia.\n\nThe Beatles were so excited he would be playing their manager they asked him for his autograph.\n\nUncredited appearances include a 13- year-old Phil Collins – who went on to rock superstardom – in a crowd scene and model Pattie Boyd as a schoolgirl.\n\nGeorge met her on the set and married her the following year.\n\nThe film was directed by American Richard Lester, who moved to the UK in the mid-1950s to make a low-budget variety show for ITV.\n\nAfter it had aired, comedy legend Peter Sellers told him: “Either that was the worst show ever been seen on British TV or you may be on to something.”\n\nThe two became friends and helped Spike Milligan bring cult radio hit The Goon Show to the small screen.\n\nLester’s first movie was Running Jumping And Standing Still Film, a bizarre 11-minute comedy.\n\nBut it was nominated for an Oscar and led directly to the Beatles’ film.\n\nThe result was a mix of slapstick, satire and vaudeville interspersed with hits like Can’t Buy Me Love, She Loves You, All My Loving, Don’t Bother Me, If I Fell, This Boy and I Wanna Be Your Man.\n\nJohn and Paul wrote the title track in one night in the middle of filming.\n\nThe Beatles were not trained actors so there were no formal rehearsals and many scenes were improvised.\n\nIndeed, when Ringo was complimented on his melancholy acting in one scene he admitted: “It was the result of a massive hangover.\n\n\"Because I’d been drinking all night I was incapable of saying a line.”\n\nFilming started on March 2 an hour after The Beatles had joined the actors’ union Equity.\n\nThe first day – at London’s Marylebone railway station – had to be shot again after the footage was lost when screaming girls mistook a mop-topped Beatles’ aide for the real thing and set upon him.\n\nA minder was added to the crew and police often had to block streets as crazed fans found out where the band were.\n\nThe second week of filming was spent on a train shuttling between London and Somerset before cast and crew moved to Twickenham Studios in south-west London for interior shots.\n\nThe Turks Head in Twickenham was used for pub scenes and the old Scala Theatre in ­central London was the venue for the concert at the climax of the film.\n\nThe entire movie took just seven weeks to shoot.\n\nA Hard’s Day’s Night had its premiere in London on July 6 – the eve of Ringo’s 24th birthday.\n\nIt won plaudits from critics as well as fans and smashed box office records.\n\nIt opened in the US four days later to wide acclaim – and has since earned tens of millions of pounds globally.\n\nScreen-writer Owen and musical director George Martin were nominated for Oscars and decades later Lester was given a ­special MTV award for being the father of the pop video.\n\nLester gave his blessing to the digital remix supervised by Martin’s son Giles at London’s Abbey Road Studios – where The Beatles made their iconic records.\n\nGiles said: “The movie was made ­before I was born but when I did see it I loved it – and the chance to work on it was tremendously exciting.”\n\nLester , now 82 and living in Petersham, Surrey, will introduce a preview of the remastered movie at the British Film Institute in London on Thursday, the day before its general cinema release.\n\nIt is already available on blu-ray and DVD with extras including out-takes, behind-the-scenes footage and cast interviews.\n\nLester later made The Beatles’ follow-up Help! and directed block-busters such as The Three Musketeers and two of the Superman movies.\n\nBut he credited the Goon Show, which went out live on TV and often had to be ad-libbed when scenery fell over and stunts went wrong, for helping him film A Hard Day’s Night so quickly.\n\nHe said: “It stood me in perfect stead for having to live a little by my wits and on my feet.”"
