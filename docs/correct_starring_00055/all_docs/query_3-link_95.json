        "text": "“We always win!” was all Norman Rossington, star of ITV’s Army Game, Our House and the film Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, could say after his TV All Stars had beaten Dudley Kernick’s Managers XI by seven goals to five.\n\nThe match, in aid of charity, drew one of the largest, if not the largest, crowds ever to be seen at Middlefield Lane.\n\nPlaying in goal for the All Stars was teenage idol Jess Conrad, and the ball was not by any means the only thing he had to keep out of the net. for given half a chance he would have had a net full of willing female “helpers”.\n\nAt left wing Norman Rossington had held the crowds in tucks of laughter in the biggest pair of shorts ever to visit Hinckley\n\nMike and Bernie Winters, the two mad brothers of stage and television, turned out and proved they both had some very good football sense. Although they did wear numbers, the positional play of these two zany comics was at times a little, eccentric to say the least.\n\nThroughout the first half the all stars played with twelve men on the field, unbeknown to the referee, Mr George Boast, an ex English League referee and a director of the Athletic, their additional player being Ken Bunt, one time of Hinckley Athletic.\n\nAt centre-forward for the Managers was ex-England goalkeeper Gil Merrick, and the very size of him seemed to upset many of the All Stars.\n\nIt is estimated there were more than 4,000 present at the match and the takings were approximately £900. Five minutes before the kick-off time the All-Stars had not arrived, but they had changed in the coach and were able take the field with a minimum of delay. They were in London at 12 o’clock and two of the members had an appointment at the London Recording Studio later the same night.\n\nBefore leaving they said how pleased they were with their Hinckley visit and promised to pay a return visit for any charitable purpose."
