        "text": "The age old question, should I get an iPad Air or a MacBook Air? I know that answer for my needs, an iPad Air with a keyboard. Now that the iPad Air will be released with a 13\" Screen, the Apple to Apple comparison can be made.\n\nThe costs.........\n\n13\" MacBook Air M2, $850, 8gb/256gb at Best Buy. $999 at Apple.\n\n13\" iPad Air M2 with Keyboard, $1148, 8gb/128gb at Apple. Add another $100 to get to 256gb.\n\nThat is quite the price difference and downright confusing to me. An iPad satisfies all of my needs but the price tells me I should buy a MacBook, which is overkill for my needs, I think? Am I not seeing something correctly here? Is an iPad with an M2 a superior processing device over an M2 MacBook that I am not aware of? Does Apple now consider an iPad more useful than a MacBook and warrants a premium?\n\nThis is interesting as I am in a similar quandary now. Our daughter's 2017 MacBook just died and we're trying to decide whether it should be replaced with a iPad Air or an MBA.\n\nIf it were me it would be a no brainer as I do a lot of stuff on a computer that I can't see doing on an iPad: Libre Office, simple coding via iTerm2, photo editing with Graphic Converter and that sort of thing. On the other hand, I'm sure the kid doesn't do any of those things and, I'm guessing here, probably spends most of her time watching videos.\n\nSo, I guess I need to shred my biases and go with an iPad?\n\nIf you really want the iPad, you might be happier with that in the long run. Last year I sold my base 12.9\" M1 iPad Pro (with MKB) and got a base M2 MacBook Air (along with a little bit of money back!). Both devices 100% satisfy my needs, but I had lot more fun working on the iPad and regret getting rid of it.\n\nThough with macOS 15 and iOS 18, I think having the MacBook is a lot more practical to me as I can mirror my iPhone to it. Either way, both devices will last you years and you can't really go wrong with either.\n\nIf you live in the US, keep an eye out for Best Buy open box sales. When I bought my MacBook, it was on sale, plus I got an extra ~$100 off because it was open box. It was in perfect condition.\n\nThis is interesting as I am in a similar quandary now.

Is it for school? My kids are still young enough that they don’t need a laptop, and an iPad is way more useful to them. If my kid was in high school, or going off to college, I still think a MacBook / laptop is more of the right tool for them for what they may need. It’s still better even for simple word processing / spreadsheets / writing reports. In 10 years, who knows if that’ll still be the case, but today, I still think so.\n\nIf it’s more a consumption device than a “school-work productivity tool”, in that case, an iPad Air + MK might be able to pull double-duty. And as the OP originally said, the iPad Air is generally priced more expensive because it is the more versatile and ”technologically advanced” device.\n\n@MacAndMic\n\nBoth devices are great but have different use cases, that's how I view it.\n\nAs far as I know you can run iPad apps on the MacBook, but since it lacks touch the user experience won't be the same.\n\nI have both an iPad Pro M1 11\" with Logitechs keyboard case and the MacBook Air M1 and if I had to choose between them (and not taking into account all the other laptops and gadgets I have) I would go for the MacBook Air.\n\nBut that's if I had to choose what to use as a main device for my needs.\n\nBoth are great devices tho, I would miss my MacBook if I didn't have it and miss my iPad if I had to let that go. But in fairness, I only really use my iPad for watching movies and playing the occasional game and so on, a cheaper iPad but with 5G would suit my needs just as well.\n\nBut in your case after viewing your second post maybe an iPad would suit all your needs.\n\nWhy not have a lookout for a sale on the M2 iPad Pro 12.9 (Face ID is great) and tie that with a Logitech keyboard (great protective case and detachable keyboard). They can prob be found at decent prices now when the new iPad Pro is out.\n\nThe prices of iPads have balooned so much that anything over the regular iPad I would not even consider, especially since they restrict what should be basic features like 120hz to the Pro model. And you look at the Mac, it's either stayed the same price or gotten cheaper with more features.\n\nEven for consumption these days I prefer a laptop. Sold my 12.9\" M1 Pro and haven't missed it at all. If I want another iPad, I'll get a basic one, but I haven't had the itch to be honest. Only time I really \"need\" it is on the plane but I've adapted to my phone for the most part.\n\n@MacAndMic\n\nBoth devices are great but have different use cases, that's how I view it.\n\nAs far as I know you can run iPad apps on the MacBook, but since it lacks touch the user experience won't be the same.\n\nI have both an iPad Pro M1 11\" with Logitechs keyboard case and the MacBook Air M1 and if I had to choose between them (and not taking into account all the other laptops and gadgets I have) I would go for the MacBook Air.\n\nBut that's if I had to choose what to use as a main device for my needs.\n\nBoth are great devices tho, I would miss my MacBook if I didn't have it and miss my iPad if I had to let that go.

I do have a M1 Air MacBook and have since given it to my wife to replace an aging MB Air she had. I have not missed the Mac at all, except once! Printing to my networked printers. They are older and do not work with the iOS printing system. Not a big issue, I have a “big” machine that I use for work or I could just jump on my Wife’s M1 Air but I print maybe a handful of times a year.\n\nOne HUGE thing for me was an iOS mapping app that interfaces with my fish finder / mapping network on my boat. Garmin does not make that app for Mac so for me, the 2 worlds came together. I started playing some games too, something I never did on my M1 Air. Touchscreen makes a difference. If Apple would only add touch to a Mac…….."
