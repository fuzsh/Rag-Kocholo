The kid can point a gun and fire a bullet, but he can't\n\neffectively do anything that is difficult like outmaneuver the enemy in\n\nclever ways. All the kid can do is what it's told to do (by Apple\n\nMarketing). It can't even, for example, automatically record a phone call,\n\nsimply because Apple Marketing limits what iOS can do.\n\nSwitching genders, using iOS is like having 12-year old girls in flimsy\n\nskirts, tanktops, and sandals trying to fix the mudslides on the roadways,\n\ninstead of men in boots, coveralls, and bulldozers. It can't even move\n\nicons around for heaven's sake. Nor can iOS do the simplest of things (such\n\nas output a list of apps to an editable text file) without the help of\n\nthose big brawny men with bulldozers.\n\nTo be clear, iOS is pretty, just like the girl in tank tops, but it's not\n\nfunctional compared to Android. On the other hand, Android isn't pretty,\n\nit's like a chainsaw isn't pretty.\n\nIn the end, if you're balanced and intelligent (you'll need both\n\nattributes!), you'll find that there is nothing iOS can do all by its itty\n\nbitty self that Android doesn't already do - while - there is *plenty* that\n\niOS can't do that Android does all by its itty bitty self.\n\nFor dozens of factual proofs, visit this thread:\n\nIs there a single bit of functionality on iOS that isn't already on\n\nAndroid?\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/misc.phone.mobile.iphone/trNDEOFg-A4%5B76-100%5D\n\nHINT: Plenty will disagree, but they can't supply a *single* fact to\n\nsupport their disagreement; meanwhile, I've just supplied dozens of facts\n\nsupporting the point of view above.\n\nStijn De Jong\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nOn Fri, 10 Feb 2017 15:05:26 +0000 (UTC), Stijn De Jong wrote:\n\n> Switching genders, using iOS is like having 12-year old girls in flimsy\n\n> skirts, tanktops, and sandals trying to fix the mudslides on the roadways,\n\n> instead of men in boots, coveralls, and bulldozers.

They are the\n\nnon-technical half, so, iOS devices are fantastic for people who just want\n\nto push buttons that the various Marketing teams put there for them.\n\nIf they can't do something, they don't worry about it.\n\nLike you, they just give up.\n\nAnd that's OK.\n\nWhat's NOT ok is that you can't see for yourself how very limited iOS is\n\ncompared to a modern mobile device operating system is. It's not the fault\n\nof the hardware, nor is it, in and of itself, the fault of the operatiing\n\nsystem itself.\n\nThe fault doesn't even lie in the most successful MARKETING organization in\n\nthe world, who has decided that, by limiting the functionality of what\n\nApple iOS devices can do, it makes MORE MONEY.\n\nYou can't blame Apple for limiting what the user can do so that they make\n\nmore money (e.g., by forcing the user to buy a second computer (often an\n\nApple computer, ka ching!) and installing hundreds upon hundreds upon\n\nhundreds of megabytes of targeted Apple bloatware (ka ching!) just to do\n\nthe simplest of things that Android does all by its itty bitty self.\n\nThe fault doesn't even lie in the average iOS users, who certainly know how\n\nvastly limited the Apple iOS devices are (e.g., they just give up all day,\n\nevery day).\n\nThe only fault is in people like you who can't see your nose in front of\n\nyour face. You're utterly blind to reality.\n\nI guess that's OK, but, you've never provided even a *single* bit of\n\nfunctionality that Apple iOS devices do, all by their itty bitty selves,\n\nthat isn't already on Android. Not one.\n\nYou know why?\n\nWhile there's plenty that Android devices do that Apple iOS devices can't\n\nhope to do (e.g., launchers, utilities, scanners, etc.) there's absolutely\n\nnothing that Apple iOS devices can do all by their itty bitty selves that\n\nAndroid don't already do!\n\nApple iOS: It's just limited.\n\nWhat you hate, is that factual truth.\n\nStijn De Jong\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nOn Sat, 11 Feb 2017 13:31:48 -0500, nospam wrote:\n\n> ios devices do *far* more than you think or want to believe, some of\n\n> which is not possible at all with android. you just can't see past your\n\n> ignorance and hatred to understand it or accept it.\n\nI don't have any hatred, but I certainly might have ignorance on iOS, which\n\nI have never denied.\n\nFor example, I'm sure there is a way, but my wife just asked me how to find\n\na file on her iOS 7.0.1 iPad she thinks she downloaded in November using\n\nChrome from an email sent to her of a \"book\".\n\nGuess what?\n\nWe can't find it.\n\nWhen I press the Chrome browser link, there isn't even a setting for\n\n*where* it puts its downloads.\n\nWhen I bring up Pages, it doesn't have it.\n\nThere's no \"downloads\" directory.\n\nSo where did it go?\n\nCertainly iOS is no help in finding it.\n\nI certainly don't know where she put it.\n\nIf it were any other operating system, I'd find it in a second.\n\niOS is that screwy that she can't even find her own files.\n\nAnd I clicked buttons for twenty minutes and just gave up (which is what\n\niOS users do all day, every day).\n\nI practically threw the damn iPad on the ground, it was that frustrating.\n\nSo, pray tell:\n\nHow does she find the file she's looking for?\n\nShe knows it's about navigational sextants and that it's a book.\n\nThat's all she knows.\n\nAnd that the link was sent to her from someone who bought the book.\n\nBut that link was sent in November.\n\nShe found one potentially related Amazon mail in her Gmail but it has a\n\ncloud sign which an unhappy face (whatever that means).\n\nI admit, I don't even have a clue how to find where iOS downloads stuff\n\nusing Chrome. If it were any other os, Chrome would just have a \"Downloads\"\n\nlocation.

Coffee-shop model\n\n2. FAQ model\n\nIn the coffee-shop model, people (like you) participate in very many\n\nthreads (perhaps also in very many groups), where the ratio of their\n\nthreads is something like 100:1 other people's threads to their threads.\n\nIn that coffee-shop model, each post is short, and often devoid of\n\nbackground detail, as it's a conversation of you and your ten thousand\n\nclosest friends over the years.\n\nThe opposite of the coffee-shop model is the FAQ model. In the FAQ model, a\n\nquestion is asked and answered and that's it for the nym (essentially). In\n\nthis FAQ model, everything that is necessary to answer the question is\n\nposited in the question. The only header that matters is the subject line.\n\nNothing else matters because the topic is completely covered in the\n\nquestion and in the summary response once the answer is found.\n\nWhat you object to is that many kooks and trolls change nyms, which is only\n\none aspect of trolling. The other aspect of trolling is that they actually\n\ntroll.\n\nThe other thing you object to is that many kooks and trolls keep a thread\n\ngoing forever (which, with the likes of nospam, RodSpeed, JR, Lewis, etc.)\n\nis so easy that it isn't even a challenge.\n\nAs you are well aware, I don't troll, and I'm not a kook. I just ask a\n\nquestion, and when the question is answered, I leave.\n\nWhat you see as trolling is merely that I courteously respond to all that\n\nbring up a point, but when that response gets to the level of, say, Lewis\n\nor Jolly Roger, then you'll see that I often just smile.\n\nYou'll note that I drop a thread when it's time to drop it.\n\nBTW, if I wanted to troll, it would be so easy with the likes of nospam and\n\nJR and Lewis; but all I care about is the answer to the question.\n\nI don't change my stripes.\n\nAs such, I am *easy* to spot.\n\nIn fact, a\n\nAnyone who can't spot me on sight is an idiot, since my MO is the same\n\nevery time (and all my information in the thread is the same every time,\n\nsame operating systems, same mobile devices, same needs, same stuff).\n\nWhat you visualize as trolling is just like arresting everyone in the bank\n\nwho has their hands in their pocket, because you simply assume that one\n\ntrait of bank robbers makes everyone with hands in their pocket a bank\n\nrobber.\n\nSaid similarly, everyone wearing a burka (sp?) is a terrorist.\n\nEveryone who voted for Trump is a racist.\n\nEveryone who likes kids is a pedophile.\n\netc.\n\nIt's how you think, not how I act, that forms your incorrect opinions.\n\nJolly Roger\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nOn 2017-02-12, Stijn De Jong <stijnd...@nlnet.nl> wrote:\n\n> On Sat, 11 Feb 2017 13:31:48 -0500, nospam wrote:\n\n>\n\n>> ios devices do *far* more than you think or want to believe, some of\n\n>> which is not possible at all with android. you just can't see past your\n\n>> ignorance and hatred to understand it or accept it.\n\n>\n\n> I don't have any hatred\n\nDenial.
