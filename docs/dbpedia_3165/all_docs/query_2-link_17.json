        "text": "To check your iPad generation, find the model number in Settings or on the back of your iPad.\n\nOnce you know your iPad's model number, use our comprehensive list to find its generation.\n\nYou can also check whether you have a home button or twin rear cameras to tell which iPad you have.\n\nIt's been more than a decade since the iPad first hit the market, and Apple has since released over two dozen different models and \"generations.\" If it's been a while since you bought your iPad, it's easy to forget which version you have.\n\nFiguring out exactly which iPad model you own lets you know how much storage space you're supposed to have, which accessories to buy, and how old your device is. It's also useful if you ever need troubleshooting help from Apple.\n\nHere's how to find your iPad's model number, and use that to check the generation and version.\n\nWhat generation is your iPad?\n\nEvery iPad has a model number that denotes exactly what kind of iPad it is, when it was made, and more.\n\nTo quickly see which iPad you have, find this model number and then search for it online or consult the list at the end of this article.\n\nFind the model number in your Settings app\n\nIf you can turn on and use your iPad, this is the fastest way to find the model number.\n\n1. Open the Settings app on your device and tap General.\n\n2. In the next menu, tap About at the top of the list.\n\n3. Look for the two tabs that say Model Name and Model Number. Tap Model Number to reveal a short code that starts with the letter \"A.\"\n\nThe Model Name line will tell you the name of your iPad and likely its screen size, but multiple iPad generations can share this name. The Model Number that begins with an A, however, is unique to your specific iPad model.\n\nLocate the model number on the back of your iPad\n\nIf your iPad can't turn on, you can still get the model number.\n\nJust turn your iPad over and look at the back. Underneath the iPad logo, beside the word \"Model,\" you'll see a capital letter A followed by a few numbers.\n\nThat's the model number, and with it you can search for your specific iPad generation online, or you can just reference our list below.\n\nCheck if there's a home button\n\nThere are also other clues to figure out which iPad you have, such as the home button.\n\nNewer iPad generations will not have a small circular home button at the bottom of the tablet's face. Apple stopped including the home button on newer iPads when they started using facial recognition technology.\n\nThese are the only iPad models that still have a home button:\n\niPad Pro with a home button are from 2017 or earlier\n\niPad Air, iPad Mini, and standard iPad with a home button are from 2019 or earlier\n\nLook at your camera placement\n\nIf you purchased an iPad Pro within the past few years, an easy way to identify the generation is if it has twin cameras.\n\nFor example, iPad Pro models from 2020 and later have rear twin cameras.\n\nHowever, previous iPad Pro models — and all other iPad models – only have one back camera.\n\nEvery iPad generation and model ever released\n\nEvery iPad generation has a unique model number. Take your model number and find it in the tables here to see which version you have. You can also press Ctrl + F or Command + F and type in your model number to find it in the tables immediately.\n\nThese tables are separated by iPad type, of which there are four: the iPad, the iPad mini, the iPad Air, and the iPad Pro.\n\nEvery iPad generation\n\nEvery iPad mini generation\n\nEvery iPad Air generation\n\nEvery iPad Pro generation"
