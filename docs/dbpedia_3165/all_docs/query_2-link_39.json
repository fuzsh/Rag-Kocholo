Finally, we'll give you a list of all iPad versions and iPad model numbers. Here's how to tell what iPad you have.\n\nWhat iPad Do I Have? How to Tell What iPad Model & Generation You Have\n\nNeed to identify an iPad model? The information you need to identify your iPad will depend on why you need it. If you’re getting your device repaired, the model number should be all you need (Ex: A1234). Buying a cool new iPad accessory? You’ll likely need your iPad model name and generation to check compatibility (Ex: 4th-Generation iPad Air). If you’re selling your device, it’s probably best to list the iPad model number, name, and generation. Below, we’ll cover some ultra-simple ways to find your iPad model and generation. For more great iPad tutorials, be sure to check out our free Tip of the Day.\n\nJump To:\n\nHow to Find Your iPad Model Number\n\nWhat Generation Is My iPad: iPad Versions & Model Numbers\n\n​Did You Identify Your iPad?\n\nHow to Find Your iPad Model Number\n\nIf you want to know which iPad you have, you should start by finding your device's model number (this is the letter \"A\", followed by a series of numbers). I recommend you start by checking your model number in the Settings app—with later iPad versions, you can view the model name, model number, and generation all in the same place. If you can view your iPad generation in the Settings app, it will be listed with the model name. If it doesn't show your iPad generation, find your model number, then skip to the section below to find your iPad generation. Now, here's how to check your iPad model number:\n\nTo find your iPad model in Settings: open the Settings app, tap General, and select About. You'll see your model name and you can tap the model number to view it. Directly underneath, you'll find your iPad serial number.\n\nYou can also check the back of your iPad to find your model number and serial number.\n\nIf your iPad won't turn on or is scratched on the back, you can identify your iPad by its external characteristics. To do so, check the section below listing all iPad models and their features.\n\nNow that you have your model number, it's time to use that information to learn how to tell what iPad you have. If you're getting your device repaired, you may not need more than your iPad model number. However, if you want to know what generation iPad you have, check the tables below to locate your generation by looking up the model number. We also have an article on how to do an iPad serial number lookup, if you need that info.\n\nWhat Generation Is My iPad: iPad Versions & Model Numbers\n\nIf you're wondering, \"What generation iPad do I have?\" you've come to the right place. In the charts below, look for your iPad's model number to find out which version of the iPad you own.
