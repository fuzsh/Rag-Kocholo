        "text": "📱 ⭐️ 5G - 5 reasons for getting a cellular iPad\n\nAs an iPad fan, the person who uses iPad as the main computer and who loves working on an iPad and who just happily upgraded to the M4 iPad Pro, I get asked a lot about choosing the best configured iPad for people’s needs. Recently I’ve been asked whether it’s worth it to upgrade to the “cellular” model. My answer in most cases is YES and here’s why:\n\n📱 ⭐️ A happy month with 13” M4 iPad Pro - thinness changes the device!\n\nAs a devout #iPadOnly user, I’ve posted my first and second impressions of the new iPads but now that I’ve lived with one for almost a month, I can offer a better verdict… and it’s very positive! The new 13” M4 iPad Pro is something else! Here’s why:\n\n📱 ✔️ ⭐️ How can I be so productive on the iPad?\n\nDespite my claims that the iPad Pro to me is the most versatile computer in the world, people still can’t believe I can get most of my work done on the iPad. I know the iPadOS is lacking when compared to the MacOS and it’s severely limited. Yet, I still prefer it and I get stuff done on the iPad with lots of joy, here’s why:\n\n📱 Second impressions of the all-new M4 13” iPad Pro - it’s thin and light!\n\nLast week I posted my first impressions on the new 13” iPad Pro and since I’m still happy with my current, almost-three-year-old M1 iPad Pro, I’ve decided to wait up until the first reviews show up and the iPad is on sale so I can touch it and feel the difference. I’m impressed:\n\n📱 🍎 New iPad Pros announced - first impressions!\n\nYesterday Apple unveiled the new iPad Airs and iPad Pros and since my current (awesome) iPad Pro 13” is going to turn 3 years old in 2 months, I’m searching for a reason to replace it with a new one. That being said, my 3 year-old iPad Pro is awesome. I completely don’t need to replace it. But maybe I want to? Let’s see:\n\n🖋 📱 🔗 ⭐️ Journaling Shortcut version 3 - simplified, improved and with Apple Notes support\n\nI love Journaling and have been since 2016 using a custom Workflow and later Siri Shortcuts. Every once in a while I’ve been tweaking my Journaling Shortcut, most recently last year. However, everything can be improved and this summer as I’ve been preparing a stand-alone Gratitude Siri Shortcut I’ve decided to also upgrade my Journaling shortcut and most importantly - add Apple Notes support. Here’s what’s improved and why you should start journaling if you haven’t already:\n\n📱 ⭐️ Why I must work on the iPad - the most versatile computer ever - M1 iPad Pro 13” review after 2 years\n\nPeople still ask me why after more than a decade I’m still working mainly on the iPad. They ask me how I can do it. The thing is, not only I can do it, but I must do it. I wouldn’t be able to work on anything else. My iPad Pro 13” is the most versatile computer ever and I can’t live without it. In most cases it’s just a much better computer than any laptop or desktop out there and in this post I’m going to prove it:\n\n🏠 📱 ⭐️ Home Office desk rearrangement - flipping monitor position, MacBook Air placement and iPad Pro setup\n\nI keep fine-tuning my home office and after rearranging it for 2023 and working like this with the M1 MacBook Air I decided to move some things around and make some more premium room on the desk for my iPad Pro and the result is this:\n\n📱 🏠 💻 ⭐️ Why I need a Mac when I’m working mostly on my iPad?\n\nRecently I wrote about my new 2023 home office setup where the key part of it is the M1 MacBook Air. Some people reading that article got a wrong impression that I’m no longer #iPadOnly. They thought I ditched my beloved 13” iPad Pro. That’s not true. Quite the contrary, the iPad is still my main computer. In fact, I’m writing these words on my iPad. I’m doing most of my creative work on the iPad. But… the M1 MacBook Air is an important back-stage/secondary computer and that’s why I need it in my home office:\n\n📱 A decade later - 5 apps which are still on my iPad and rocking it!\n\nMore than 10 years ago I switched completely to using the iPad as my main computer and I posted a series of screenshots of apps I was using then. Heck, I dedicated an entire section of my #iPadOnly book to apps from that era. What strikes me now is that after a decade, there are still many apps that not only have stayed on my iPad but continue thriving on it. And most are authored by indie developers. Here’s my tribute to them:"
