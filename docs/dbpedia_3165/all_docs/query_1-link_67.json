        "text": "While Apple’s shiny new products boast the latest and greatest in AI processing and tandem OLED screens, the older iPad Pro M2 and MacBook Air M2 are still worth considering in 2024. Apple’s iPad Pro M2 and MacBook Air 13 M2 (the MacBook Air 15 M2, too) share some of the same specifications: Apple’s impressive M2 chip, up to 16GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage space, so you'll get roughly the same performance out of both devices. Both are also lightweight, portable, and priced similarly.\n\nThat’s where the similarities end: After all, one is a tablet and the other is a laptop. They run on different operating systems, have different cameras, screen resolutions, cellular connectivity—the list goes on. Both the iPad Pro and MacBook Air are excellent productivity companions, but if you need a new device for more than checking emails, one will suit your needs better than the other.\n\nAs a laptop, the MacBook Air 13 beats out the iPad Pro—they may share the same processor, but the MacBook Air 13’s fully featured macOS operating system is a lot more versatile than the iPad Pro’s iPadOS. However, if you love to write with a pencil more than you do with a keyboard the iPad Pro is a worthy choice.\n\nMacBook Air M2 vs iPad Pro M2: Form factor and configuration\n\nIf you want the iPad Pro to double as a laptop, you’ll need to buy a keyboard. Companies like Logitech make a wide array of iPad keyboards, and Apple has its own Magic Keyboard, of course. But depending on the brand you could find yourself spending anywhere between $20 and $300 for an iPad keyboard.\n\nThe 11-inch iPad Pro's base model comes with 8GB RAM, 128GB of storage, and no cellular connectivity for $799. If you add Apple’s Magic Keyboard ($299), the total comes to $1,098 before sales. The base MacBook Air 13 is $850, and it comes with twice the amount of storage space as the iPad Pro.\n\nThe 12.9-inch iPad Pro starts at $1,099. You’ll get a better display with this screen size, but you get nothing in the way of more storage. Doubling the SSD storage from 128GB to 256GB adds another $100 regardless of whether you opt for the 11-inch or 12.9-inch model—and the starting price ensures you will spend more on this iPad Pro as a MacBook Air 13 M2 without a keyboard.\n\nThe MacBook Air M2 has four configurations (two 13-inch and two 15-inch models). The first 13-inch model starts at $849 with an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD storage. The second has a 10-core GPU and double the storage for $1,099.\n\nBoth 15-inch models come with an 8/10-core M2 chip, and 8GB of memory (configurable to 64GB), but the lower-end configuration starts with a 256GB SSD for $999. The $1,199 model starts with 512GB of storage. Both are configurable up to 2TB.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to configure both devices, but the MacBook Air removes the headache of finding a reasonably priced keyboard, and you get more for your money when it comes to storage.\n\nOur pick: MacBook Air\n\nMacBook Air M2 vs iPad Pro M2: Software compatibility\n\nAfter the form factor, the major difference between the iPad Pro and MacBook Air is the operating system. The iPad Pro runs on iPadOS and the MacBook Air runs on macOS. The latter is a full-fledged operating system, while the former has more in common with the iPhone.\n\nBut things get confusing from here. Macs can run iPadOS apps, but iPads can’t run some macOS apps.\n\nFinal Cut Pro, Logic Pro, and Garage Band are available on both platforms, but the iPadOS versions are pared-down with less nuanced controls and capabilities. Apps from other developers, such as Adobe Lightroom and Microsoft Excel, often have the same issue.\n\nIf you need the full version of any of the above programs, the iPad Pro is not the best choice for that.\n\nOur pick: MacBook Air\n\nMacBook Air M2 vs iPad Pro M2: Connectivity\n\nBoth the iPad Pro and MacBook Air don’t have many physical ports, but the MacBook Air wins over the iPad Pro because it has more by comparison. While the iPad Pro only has one USB Thunderbolt 4 port, the MacBook Air has two USB Thunderbolt 4 ports, plus a 3.5mm audio jack.\n\nThis means you can charge your laptop and plug in another device, like a flash drive, at the same time. If you wanted to do the same with the iPad Pro you’d need to buy a separate Thunderbolt dock.\n\nHowever, the MacBook Air does not have a Cellular connectivity option. Both devices have Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0, but the iPad Pro is the only one you can take with you to the park and play Doom in the cloud over a 4G or 5G connection. Or maybe you take the train to work and you need reliable access to the internet. The iPad Pro has you covered there, too.\n\nBut if you want the cheapest option possible, then you’re stuck with an 11-inch display with a less powerful OS for the same price as a 13-inch MacBook Air M2.\n\nOur pick: Tie\n\nMacBook Air M2 vs iPad Pro M2: Display\n\nThis is the one category where the iPad Pro wins outright, but let’s start with the MacBook Air.\n\nCompared to the iPad Pro, the MacBook Air’s display isn’t all that fancy. The Retina LED-backlit display supports up to a 2560 x 1664 resolution with a max 500 nits brightness. Like both iPad Pro models, its display has a wide color gamut (P3) and True Tone technology, but that’s where the similarities end.\n\nBoth iPad Pro models have True Tone displays with a wide color gamut (P3) and 600 nits max brightness (non-HDR content). But the 12.9-inch model has a fancier display that supports up to 1,000 nits max full-screen brightness and 1,600 nits peak brightness for HDR content. The 11-inch model has a max resolution of 2388 x 1668, and the 12-inch model’s max resolution is 2732 x 2048.\n\nBoth models also have a mini-LED backlit display. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro also has a 2D backlighting system with 2,596 full-array local dimming zones, so contrast and colors really pop.\n\nAnd, of course, the iPad Pro displays are touch displays, with support for Apple Pencil Hover, but the MacBook Air doesn’t have one. (I mean you can touch it, but nothing will happen.)\n\nOur pick: iPad Pro\n\nMacBook Air M2 vs iPad Pro M2: Battery life\n\nThe MacBook Air can get up to 15 hours of battery life, while the iPad Pro can only get up to ten hours. (The cellular models get up to nine hours.) If you were considering getting the iPad Pro as a laptop replacement but were concerned about the battery life, you get more for your money with the MacBook Air.\n\nOur pick: MacBook Air\n\nAnd the winner is… the MacBook Air\n\nWhen it comes to which device can be the best laptop, it’s no surprise Apple’s MacBook Air is the best because it’s, well, a laptop. Along with better battery life, more ports, and a more robust OS, the MacBook Air boasts a better value than the iPad Pro; it already has everything you could possibly need.\n\nThe iPad Pro serves a narrower demographic. But if you absolutely must have a touch-screen device, the iPad Pro is still a great, reliable machine. Just keep in mind that you will end up paying more for it than a MacBook Air."
