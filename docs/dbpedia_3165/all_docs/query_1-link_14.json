        "text": "Most people don’t need a laptop anymore for their computing needs in 2024. Don’t get me wrong, I’m right there with you if a laptop is your preferred device and the one that helps you be more productive, but there’s a good argument to be made that a tablet – and one of the best iPads in particular – is now such a versatile companion that it can do everything you’d be relying on your laptop for.\n\nIt’s possible to now fully replace a laptop with a more portable iPad – it’s not without its minor drawbacks but there are some major benefits, and it can be more affordable too.\n\nTo put the notion to the test, I’ve spent the last month with my personal laptop stashed away in a drawer. Of course, I’ve continued to use my work computer for my job, but once I’m off the clock I’ve been heading straight to the iPad Air for emailing, online shopping, photo editing, entertainment, browsing, reading and much more.\n\nHere are four reasons why I’d happily stick with the iPad as my main computer, along with the two things I missed from my laptop (an ):\n\nThe benefits of using an iPad as your main computer\n\n1. An iPad is super portable and convenient\n\nThis one’s an easy win for the iPad. At its lightest, an 11-inch iPad Air is a mere 462g. To put that in perspective, it’s lighter than a bag of spaghetti.\n\nEither way, it’s incredibly portable. It goes up to a higher weight once you add a (around 600g), which is a helpful accessory to make the tablet feel more like a laptop. Overall, though, this is a versatile and lightweight companion that you’ll find slips into your bag more easily than a laptop, especially if you don’t need the keyboard.\n\nIt’s more than actual on-the-go use, though. Even just for use around the house, an iPad feels more convenient. Whether I’m hopping on a FaceTime call, sending an email, watching some YouTube videos or jotting down notes, the touch interface is more intuitive overall than a laptop.\n\n2. It’s a better entertainment device than a laptop\n\nAn iPad is a natural device for reading, viewing TV shows and movies, and basic gaming. As I’ve already said, you’ll have no problem holding the lightweight tablet in one hand, and it’s simple to go into all the apps you’re already used to using from your phone. The screen is bright and goes into distraction-free fullscreen by default.\n\nIt’s helpful whether you are accessing your favourite streaming services and catch-up platforms to press play on the next episode of Bridgerton, watching the latest movies on Disney+, reading the news, or pageturners within Apple Books, the Kindle app or Kobo.\n\nOne of the greatest benefits I use all the time is the ability to download shows and movies to the iPad ahead of flights and long journeys. This is sometimes possible on a computer, but often more challenging. With the iPad, it’s easy to accomplish via each streaming service’s app, as long as downloading is supported (you’ll find it is on Netflix, Disney+, BBC iPlayer, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video and more).\n\n3. It keeps you focused on one task at a time\n\nA big criticism of the iPad is that it’s not a great device for multi-tasking and productivity, but I think this all depends on what you’re trying to do. It’s certainly possible to employ multiple windows on an iPad, especially side-by-side to refer to some research on one side of the screen and jot down your notes on the other side. However, juggling multiple windows and tasks at the same time could be a challenge.\n\nI tend to view this as a benefit rather than a downside, though, because I find myself getting far less easily distracted when working on an iPad. I’m sure artists using the Apple Pencil for a creative project would agree — It’s ideal to have one environment that’s free from interruptions or other windows that could divert your attention.\n\nI find this great when I’m editing my photos, for example, and need to go through hundreds of snaps without wanting to be sidetracked from them. It’s also great if you’re planning a holiday, and you know that you only need to see your itinerary on one side of the screen and your internet browser for research on the other side. It’s an effective setup for focus.\n\n4. It’s a more versatile product overall\n\nI keep coming back to the iPad for its sheer versatility. I like to travel light, so it has ended up being what I’ve brought with me on work trips over the laptop. I’ve had no problem using it for writing with the Magic Keyboard, communicating with colleagues, answering emails, managing and editing photos taken on my phone and my dedicated camera, and jotting down notes with the Apple Pencil.\n\nAnd, when you’re not working, it becomes a terrific device for catching up on TV programmes and films (especially when paired with a pair of Apple AirPods for the “spatial audio” effect) or for reading the headlines. Much of this might sound like what you’d do on your phone, but there’s a genuine appeal to a large screen that you won’t have to squint to use.\n\nYes, a laptop does many of the same things but its work-centric design can feel more geared towards productivity. Not using your devices to manage extensive spreadsheets or large projects? There’s a good chance that the convenient iPad is going to work better for your needs at a lower cost.\n\nBest iPad for colourful design\n\nApple iPad 10th generation (2022)\n\nRead more\n\nBest iPad for most people\n\nApple iPad Air (M2, 2024)\n\nRead more\n\nBest iPad for portability\n\nApple iPad mini (2021)\n\nRead more\n\nBest iPad for professional use\n\nApple iPad Pro (M4, 2024)\n\nRead more\n\nThe drawbacks of using an iPad as your main computer\n\nNow let’s take a look at some of the minor downsides. After all, the laptop holds some unique appeal for its versatility, background processes, multitasking and window management too. These are the two things that stuck out to me during this hands-on test:\n\n1. Multi-tasking is far better on a laptop\n\nYou’ll have guessed that this point was coming, but yes, you’ll find a proper laptop is significantly better for juggling lots of different jobs in one go.\n\nThere are several small things that add up, like how you can have loads of windows up on the screen at once, dragging and dropping files between them, playing concurrent audio streams, managing those files with more complex folders and using several different types of programmes that don’t only have to be available in Apple’s App Store. For some people, all of these capabilities are essential to their workflow, and it would be hard to put the laptop aside for a single-task-focused iPad.\n\nAs the iPad app availability has developed and improved over the years, this is far less of a dealbreaker than it used to be, and newer iPad Air and iPad Pro models have effective multitasking features to handle at least three applications on screen at once.\n\nDuring this test, I only occasionally wished I could have more windows on my iPad screen in one go. After all, I think you’ll know if the multi-tasking capabilities are a sticking point for your needs, and if it hadn’t occurred to you, you probably would get on just fine with an iPad.\n\n2. Battery life is much better on the MacBook Air\n\nI think I’d still pick a MacBook Air if you’re deciding between the two and you know that battery life is a major concern for how you use a computer. Every single iPad is developed to deliver a satisfactory battery life of 10 hours (although this can end up being less under intense usage) while a MacBook Air can reach up to a whopping 18 hours of life.\n\nThis kind of battery life is now true for a lot of laptops too, whether you’re looking at a Mac or a PC. Because of this, I think travellers who are working and away from a plug for a long time will still get the greatest benefit out of a dedicated laptop over an iPad.\n\nI wouldn’t go as far as calling this a big downside, though, and during the last month, I’ve only rarely noticed the iPad on low battery and found it fast to recharge. If you’re not working a lot on the device and you’re keeping a power bank with you in your carry-on backpack, you’re going to find the iPad will still work well enough to get you through a long-haul flight.\n\nVerdict: iPad vs laptop\n\nSo, at the end of this process, am I going back to using my laptop or iPad primarily? Because of my job as a technology journalist, I’ll always have a bit of balance between the two but I think my personal laptop is staying in the drawer for the time being.\n\nOutside of work, there’s very little that I’m struggling to get done on the more portable computer, and my multitasking needs are minimal – overall, the iPad ticks enough boxes while being just a bit more convenient and better for focusing on my work.\n\nUnsure of which iPad to get?
