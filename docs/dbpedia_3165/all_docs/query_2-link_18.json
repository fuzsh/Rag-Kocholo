        "text": "The Apple iPad 10.9 and iPad Air are both excellent tablets, with hundreds of millions sold to date.\n\nWritten by\n\nOur content is funded in part by commercial partnerships, at no extra cost to you and without impact to our editorial impartiality. Click to Learn More\n\nYou won’t be too shocked to hear that the iPad and iPad Air are both excellent tablets. Apple has been selling its iconic iPad for more than a decade now, and we’ve bought nearly 600 million of them. There’s a reason for that – coupling sleek design and speedy processors with an intuitive user interface, the iPad appeals to Apple experts and newcomers alike.\n\nThe question, then, is which model do you go for? According to our research, the iPad 10.9 is the better option for almost everyone, given its large screen and notably lower price tag. Still, the iPad Air is a very respectable device, but we don’t see much reach to pay extra for a slightly better processor and a crisper display.\n\nTo be clear, Apple has four distinct ranges in its iPad stable, launching the new iPad Air and iPad Pro models in May 2024. We’re going to focus on the iPad 10.9 (10th generation) and the iPad Air (6th generation) in this guide, and let you know which is the better fit for you.\n\nNeed an iPad like right now?\n\nGet the iPad for $349 on Amazon today\n\nNo matter what you’re using your iPad for – visual design, accounting, or sound editing, we’ll suggest the right iPad to opt for.\n\nStruggling to decide between the regular iPad and the iPad Air? We’ll get into the details later in the guide, but take a look at this comparison to see what each offer, plus pit them against the notably more robust and expensive iPad Pro lineup:\n\n0 out of 0\n\nScreen Size\n\nMeasured diagonally across.\n\nScreen Resolution\n\nIn pixels - the higher the number, the greater the screen detail.\n\nBattery Life\n\nAs claimed by the manufacturer – actual performance will vary depending on daily tasks.\n\nProcessor\n\nStorage\n\nThe built in storage space for files, programs, apps and the operating system\n\nRear Camera\n\nFront Camera\n\nApple Device Compatibility\n\nWhich official Apple accessories the iPad pairs with\n\nPrice\n\nBuy\n\nIn this guide:\n\niPad or iPad Air – Which Should You Buy?\n\niPad 10.9 Overview\n\niPad Air Overview\n\niPad Pro Overview\n\nThe iPad 10.9 is Much Better Value\n\nThe iPad Air Has Better Accessories\n\nThe iPad Air is More Powerful\n\nThe iPad 10.9 is Better for Casual Users\n\nVerdict: Which iPad Should You Buy?\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\niPad or iPad Air – Which Should You Buy?\n\nFor most people, the 10.9-inch regular iPad is a better choice than the iPad Air. The iPad 10.9 is such better value, even though it’s a bit outdated, and will do just about everything the average user could need. If you have to have the latest, lightest tablet – and money is no object – then spoil yourself with an iPad Air. You won’t regret it. But nor would you likely regret saving and going for a regular iPad model. The iPad and iPad Air are both excellent tablets that blow most of their competition out of the water. However, there are some distinct differences between the two:\n\nThe iPad Air features the powerful M2 chip\n\nThe iPad is the cheapest model in Apple’s line up\n\nThe iPad Air has a 10.9-inch screen\n\nOn paper, the Air is the better device. It offers more impressive specifications, including a faster processor. On the other hand, the standard iPad is cheaper – by quite a margin – and still delivers an excellent experience. What you opt for depends on what you’ll be doing, but we don’t think you should overlook the iPad in favor of the iPad Air.\n\nVerdict: Any casual user who just wants to browse, stream and email should go for the 10.9-inch iPad rather than the nice, but pricey Air.\n\nIf you want a smaller iPad, or the premium iPad, consider the Mini or the Pro. Read our full iPad buyers guide for the whole range.\n\niPad 10.9 (10th generation) Overview\n\nHas a 10.9-inch screen\n\nUses the A14 Bionic processor\n\nSmart Keyboard compatible\n\nExcellent battery life\n\nThe 2022 iPad 10.9 is the direct an excellent option for virtually anyone. The big 10.9-inch display still delights compared to the previous model’s 10.9-inches, while still being compact enough for on-the-go users.\n\nSpecs wise, the iPad 10.9 is rocking the A14 processor, and it starts with 64GB of storage, going up to 256GB.\n\nThe iPad 10.9 is available now for $349.\n\niPad 10.9 Folio Keyboard\n\nThe iPad 10.9 is compatible with the official Apple Folio Keyboard – previously owners of the entry-level iPad had to rely on third party solutions for their keyboard fix. It’s not cheap, at $179, but we’re glad that it’s no longer reserved for the much pricier Pro and Air models.\n\nApple iPad 10.9 10th Gen\n\nThe newest and best iPad for pretty much everyone\n\nIn Short\n\nPros\n\nCheapest iPad available\n\nCompatible with Smart Keyboard\n\n10.9-inch screen\n\nCons\n\nMore expensive than previous iterations\n\niPad Air (6th generation) Overview\n\nFeatures a 10.9-inch display\n\nPowerful M2 chip processor\n\nCompatible with Apple Pencil Pro\n\nSlimmer and lighter than the iPad\n\nThe iPad Air was recently given a makeover by Apple, which included a boost in its engine room. The M2 processor is now running the show, which puts it on a par with Apple’s latest devices.\n\nThe iPad Air is pitched somewhere between the iPad and the iPad Pro – it’s aimed at those who want a more powerful tablet, but don’t have the budget for Apple’s premium offerings. This is a space that the Air has carved out for itself, and there’s certainly a lot of reasons as to why you’d want to pick one up if your needs have exceeded the iPad.\n\nThe iPad Air is currently available for $599.\n\niPad Air Display\n\nThe display size is the same as the standard iPad, with a 10.9-inch screen. This is a recent change, with the iPad having recently received some extra real estate to bring it up to the dimensions of the Air. Needless to say, the image is fantastic, utilizing Apple’s retina display technology to reproduce stunning images.\n\nApple iPad Air 6th Gen\n\nGreat for professionals in need of lightweight portability\n\nIn Short\n\nPros\n\nCompatible with Apple Pen Pro\n\n10.9-inch screen\n\nCheaper than the iPad Pro\n\nCons\n\nPricier than the similar 10.9-inch iPad\n\nNo additional ports\n\nGallery Click to expand\n\niPad Pro Overview\n\n11-inch or 12.9-inch screen options\n\nUses the M4 chip\n\nNow compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro\n\nBeautiful display\n\nIn most cases, we’d recommend you stick with the iPad or iPad Air if you’re a casual user. However, if you need a lot of power, a lot of storage, or additional security, the iPad Pro line up is a great option. Professional use these devices as straight up laptop replacements, and pair with the many compatible accessories, it definitely is.\n\nThe iPad Pro comes in two difference sizes. You can opt for the iPad Pro 11, which is closer to the iPad and iPad Air on display size. However, the iPad Pro 12.9 is also available, providing nearly an additional two inches of screen size. The price reflects these sizes, though with the iPad 11 costing $999 and the iPad 12.9 costing a whopping $1,299.\n\niPad Pro Features\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between the standard iPad, the iPad Air, and the iPad Pro lineup is the fact that the Pro options offer Face ID for secure login. It’s a minor time-saver, but if you don’t feel like using your fingerprint to login, it can be an added benefit. You’ve also got the option to have a lot more storage with the iPad Pro lineup, as it offers more storage and more RAM across the board.\n\nApple iPad Pro 11 (2024)\n\nA powerful iPad, perfect for business and design users\n\nIn Short\n\nPros\n\nPowerful M4 processor\n\nSlim and light\n\nUSB-C port\n\nCons\n\nNo headphone jack\n\nA bit small for designers\n\nThe iPad 10.9 is Much Better Value than the iPad Air\n\nTake a look at the iPad and the iPad Air side by side, and you’ll soon spot the most glaring difference: The price. The iPad starts at $349, while the Air will set you back $599 for its cheapest model.\n\nThere’s a reason for this of course – the Air has a lot more muscle than the iPad, thanks to that M2 chip, compared to the iPad’s older A14 processor. That’s not to say that the standard iPad is a sluggish weakling – far from it – but if you want the extra power, you’ll have to pay out for the Air.\n\nWhether or not these differences are enough for you to justify spending an extra $250 depends on your own needs, but we can’t argue that the standard iPad represents excellent value.\n\nThe iPad Air Has Better Accessories\n\nYou might think that if there’s one thing that the iPad range isn’t famous for, it’s connections. Well, you’d be mostly right. Generally, on most models, you now get USB-C support, but wired headphones fans might want to take a seat – the headphone jack has now been eliminated from all models.\n\nHowever, the Air has a trick up its sleeve here, and just trumps the standard iPad. The iPad Air has compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro, whereas the iPad only has compatibility with Apple Pencil (1st generation). The difference shouldn’t be a huge deal breaker for anyone, but if you want the latest Apple Pencil, you’re going to have to opt for the iPad Air.\n\nThe iPad Air is More Powerful\n\nThe iPad Air, alongside the Pro both use the M2 chip – the Apple-made chip that kicked off the company’s independence.\n\nIn real terms, this means that it’s able to load your apps faster, as well as handle multi-tasking, with more ease than the standard iPad. The Air serves up a buttery smooth experience and exhibits few signs of faltering when you start to work it.\n\nThat said, whether or not you need this much horsepower in your tablet is another question. While the Air is the halfway house between the entry-level iPad and the super-powered Pro, it’s much closer to the latter than the former.\n\nThe iPad 10.9 is Better for Casual Users\n\nThe iPad is the best choice for casual users. This means that if you mainly use your iPad for social media, browsing the web, and streaming movies, then the standard iPad offers the whole package for $349.\n\nIs it as fast as the Air? No – but frankly, you’re unlikely to notice unless you have the two in a side-by-side comparison. On a daily basis, it will be hard to beat the iPad for performance and value, especially if you’re not challenging it with demanding software or juggling several things at once.\n\nVerdict: Which iPad Should You Buy?\n\nChoosing between the iPad and the iPad Air (or even the iPad Pro) is a matter of need. As we’ve stated above, if you’re a consumer more than a creator, then the standard iPad is a great choice for the money. It’ll serve up non-stop entertainment, and handle your daily desires with aplomb, whether it’s checking in on social media or browsing online.\n\nHowever, if you’re more interested in editing images and video – or substituting your trusted laptop for the iPad on occasion – the Air is better proposition, thanks to its extra firepower and on-the-go design. Plus, it’s the far more recent device, launching in May 2024, so you’re getting a far more future proof device.\n\nAbout our links\n\nIf you click on, sign up to a service through, or make a purchase through the links on our site, or use our quotes tool to receive custom pricing for your business needs, we may earn a referral fee from the supplier(s) of the technology you’re interested in.
