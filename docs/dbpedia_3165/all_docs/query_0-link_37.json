        "text": "You can use a cable to directly connect your iPad to a Mac with OS X 10.9 or later, or to a PC with Windows 7 or later.\n\nUsing the charging cable for your iPad, connect iPad to the USB port on your computer. If the cable isn’t compatible with the port on your computer, you’ll need to use an adapter (sold separately).\n\nThe iPad battery charges when iPad is connected to your computer and your computer is connected to power."
