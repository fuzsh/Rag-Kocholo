        "text": "What are all the differences between the iPad Air 5 (5th Gen) models?\n\nThe iPad Air 5 models have been discontinued. However, this Q&A has been updated subsequently with current operating system support details and can be quite helpful for anyone buying or selling one of these devices on the used market.\n\nThere are three iPad Air 5th Gen models -- the iPad Air 5 (Wi-Fi Only), iPad Air 5 (Wi-Fi+Cell), and iPad Air 5 (Wi-Fi+Cell China). These three models -- commonly collectively referred to as the iPad Air 5 -- vary by location sold, connectivity, battery life, identifiers, and price.\n\nPhoto Credit: Apple, Inc. (iPad Air 5)\n\nDevice Similarities\n\nAll iPad Air 5 tablets share the same general design with rounded corners and flat sides, weigh about a pound, and have a black front. Color options include a dark \"Space Gray,\" warm gray \"Starlight,\" Pink, Blue, or Purple aluminum back.\n\nPhoto Credit: Apple, Inc. (iPad Air 5 Color Options)\n\nAll iPad Air 5 models use the same fully-laminated, antireflective 10.9\" LED-backlit 2360x1640 \"Liquid Retina\" display (264 ppi, 500 nits) surrounded by a thin black bezel. The display offers \"wide color\" (DCI-P3) support and Apple's \"True Tone\" technology. They do not support ProMotion (120 Hz refresh rate).\n\nEach iPad Air 5 also shares the same eight-core 3.2 GHz Apple M1 processor, an 8-core GPU, and a 16-core \"Neural Engine,\" have 8 GB of RAM, and are equipped with either 64 GB or 256 GB of flash storage. In addition to a USB-C port, other shared connectivity includes 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) as well as Bluetooth 5.0.\n\nAll have a front-mounted 12 megapixel \"FaceTime HD\" camera that supports \"Center Stage\" to automatically pan and zoom and shoots up to 1080p video. All also have a rear-mounted 12 megapixel \"Wide\" camera that shoots up to 4K video in addition to dual microphones and stereo speakers.\n\nOther notable features include a \"Touch ID\" authentication sensor built into the top button as well as support for the Apple Pencil 2 (A2051, MU8F2AM/A, US$129) that conveniently charges via a magnetic connection on the side.\n\niOS Support Similarities\n\nThe iPad Air 5 models initially shipped with iPadOS 15.4 and are fully compatible with this version of the operating system. They support iPadOS 16, and iPadOS 17, as well.\n\nRunning iPadOS 16, the iPad Air 5 does not support the advanced Reference Mode and Accessibility Detection features. It does support the Stage Manager features to improve multitasking, except for full external display support. Running iPadOS 17, it lacks support for the minor Screen Distance and External Camera for FaceTime features.\n\nIdentification Differences\n\nWhen next to one another, the Wi-Fi only and cellular iPad Air 5 models can be differentiated visually because the iPad Air 5 (Wi-Fi Only) -- left -- has a solid aluminum back whereas the cellular iPad Air 5 models -- right -- have a subtle antenna line at the top of the back of each device:\n\nPhoto Credit: Apple, Inc. (iPad Air 5: Wi-Fi - Left; Cellular - Right)\n\nHowever, it is not possible to visually distinguish the two cellular-capable iPad Air 5 models and it is easy to mix up all of these tablets with the earlier iPad Air 4 models and the iPad Pro, as well. Consequently, one of the best methods for external identification is via Model Number.\n\nModel numbers are listed in small type toward the bottom of the back of each iPad Air 5:\n\niPad Air\n\nModel No\n\niPad Air 5 (Wi-Fi Only)\n\nA2588\n\niPad Air 5 (Wi-Fi+Cell)\n\nA2589\n\niPad Air 5 (Wi-Fi+Cell China)\n\nA2591\n\nInitially, the mainland China-only iPad Air 5 probably will not often be found on the other side of the great firewall, but over time, it inevitably will travel around the globe on the used market.\n\nEach iPad model can be differentiated by other identifiers as well, such as the Order Number, which can be located by selecting the Settings app and pressing General > About and scrolling down to what is specified as \"Model\" within the iOS. For example, the cellular-equipped configuration of the iPad Air 5 in purple with 64 GB of storage sold in the United States is MME93LL/A.\n\nTo pinpoint an exact iPad Air 5 by a number of other different identifiers, please refer to the Ultimate iLookup feature.\n\nConnectivity & Battery Life Differences\n\nAs noted at the beginning of this Q&A, the iPad Air 5 models have notable differences in connectivity. All iPad Air 5 models support 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6; simultaneous dual band (2.4GHz and 5GHz); HT80 with MIMO in addition to Bluetooth 5.0.\n\nAll cellular iPad Air 5 models support A-GPS, UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1700/2100, 1900, 2100 MHz), and 5G NR cellular connectivity (n1, n2, n3, n5, n7, n8, n12, n20, n25, n28, n29, n30, n38, n40, n41, n48, n66, n71, n77, n78, and n79), but Gigabit-class LTE support varies slightly between the global and mainland China models:\n\niPad Air Model 4G LTE Bands 5 (Wi-Fi Only) A2588 None 5 (Wi-Fi+Cell) A2589 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48, 66, 71 5 (Wi-Fi+Cell China) A2591 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48, 66, 71\n\nFor battery life, Apple estimates that all iPad Air 5 models provide up to ten hours of runtime on Wi-Fi whereas the cellular-equipped models provide up to nine hours using a cellular network.\n\nEvery cellular iPad Air 5 model ships unlocked. In the US, the applicable tablet works with AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. Some carriers may still require activation or configuration before it will work properly -- or at all -- on their network.\n\nIn the US and UK, if purchased from Apple or an Apple Authorized Reseller -- like site sponsor Adorama -- the cellular-capable iPad Air 5 also ships with an \"Apple SIM\" that is designed to support multiple carriers via a single Apple-issued Nano SIM card.\n\nPricing Comparison Chart\n\nEach iPad Air 5 color option costs the same amount. Original pricing is differentiated by capacity and connectivity alone:\n\nCapacity: 64 GB 256 GB Wi-Fi Only Price: US$599 US$749 Wi-Fi/Cellular & A-GPS Price: US$749 US$899\n\nFor original pricing details in dozens of other countries, please refer to the iPad specs page for the device of interest as well as Everyi.com's Global Original Prices section.\n\nComparison Summary\n\nUltimately, the iPad Air 5 models are differentiated from each other by connectivity and battery life. Like previous iPad Air models, the iPad Air 5 is considered to be a \"mid-range\" option between the inexpensive entry-level \"regular\" iPad and the high-end iPad Pro. However, the iPad Air 5 holds its own in terms of performance in many tasks with the more expensive iPad Pro models available when it was introduced.\n\nSelecting a Wi-Fi only or cellular-capable iPad Air 5 is a personal decision; whether or not the A-GPS and cellular capability is worth the extra money upfront (originally US$150) plus the extra ongoing costs for a cell plan.\n\nIf the iPad Air 5 is going to be your only computer and you probably will be on the go frequently, the cellular connection could be welcomed. On the other hand, if you plan to use your iPad mostly in your Wi-Fi-equipped home, office, and coffee shop (and don't mind occasionally tethering your iPad Air to a cellular-equipped device like an iPhone or Android mobile), the Wi-Fi only model could be good enough for your needs.\n\nIn the US, site sponsor Adorama sells new iPad Air models with free shipping. Other World Computing and JemJem sell used and refurb iPad Air models at bargain prices with free shipping, as well. Finally, if you need to sell an iPad, A+ BBB-rated Cash for Your Mac and GoRoostr will buy your older iPad with an instant quote and prompt payment.\n\nIn the UK, site sponsor Hoxton Macs has a large number of used and refurbished iPad models with a one-year warranty and free next day delivery throughout the UK. Delivery across Europe also is available starting at just Â£9.99 for two-day delivery to France and Germany.\n\nIn Australia, site sponsor Mac City may have used iPad models in stock, as well.
