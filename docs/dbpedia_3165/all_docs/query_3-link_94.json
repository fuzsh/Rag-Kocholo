        "text": "During June’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple unveiled significant software updates for its main products: the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple Vision Pro, Apple TV, and Mac. One of these updates is iPadOS 18.\n\nIf you’re wondering when you can download the new update for your iPad, it’s technically available now. However, there are three different versions of iPadOS 18, and each will be released at different times throughout the year. Let’s take a closer look.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\niPadOS 18 developer beta release date\n\nApple continues to release developer beta versions of iPadOS 18 and will keep doing so until the first public version is released this fall. Each new developer beta version has seen further refinements compared to the previous one. However, we haven’t seen any Apple Intelligence features yet. These features will likely be included in future developer versions of iPadOS 18 and might not arrive until later in the year with iPadOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.2, and other future updates.\n\nYou can download and install developer beta versions of iPadOS 18 even if you’re not a developer, but you probably shouldn’t since these versions are still prone to bugs. Instead, keep reading for updates.\n\niPadOS 18 public beta release date\n\nApple has finally started releasing public beta versions of iPadOS 18 on July 15. These versions are more stable than the developer betas and are aimed at non-developers. As a beta user, you may still encounter some issues, but these hiccups are expected to be less frequent than when using a developer beta on your iPad.\n\nTo download and install it, you can follow similar steps to those for the developer beta versions.\n\nWhen will your iPad get iPadOS 18?\n\nApple has a history of staggering when it releases the first public versions of new software; the same thing will likely happen this year. The company will likely announce its new iPhone 16 series in September, and at the same time, it will release the first public version of iOS 18.\n\nIt might also release the first public version of iPadOS 18 at this time, but don’t be surprised if Apple delays this until October. Although Apple announced the iPad Pro (M4) and iPad Air (M2) earlier this year, we still await updates to the regular iPad and iPad mini. Those updates could be revealed along with the release of the first public version of iPadOS 18.\n\nWhen iPadOS 18 is finally released to the general public, it should be exciting. In addition to Apple Intelligence, the update includes new customization tools, an updated version of the Notes and Photos apps, and much more. It also introduces the first official Calculator app in the iPad’s history. There’s also an official Password app set to arrive. Messages, Mail, and Safari are also gaining new tools, as are SharePlay and Freeform."
