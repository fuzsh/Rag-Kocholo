Learn more\n\nIn early 2022, Apple unveiled the fifth-generation iPad Air, a value champion for power users. A few months later, the company introduced the sixth-generation iPad Pro, which stands as the most powerful and responsive tablet in Apple's current lineup.\n\nDespite costing significantly less than the $799 11-inch iPad Pro and the $1,099 12.9-inch model, the $599 iPad Air is still very much a high-end tablet, and demanding users will be satisfied with its balance of price, performance, and feature set. The latest iPad Pro models run on Apple's M2 processor, which offers a performance bump over the iPad Air's M1 processor that will be mostly felt in long-term ownership.\n\nWhat really sets the iPad Pro apart is Apple's Hover feature for the second-generation Apple Pencil, which brings next-level accuracy in using the stylus. On top of that, the iPad Pro includes Apple's ProMotion high-refresh-rate display for a silky smooth experience when navigating and working on the tablet.\n\nWhen deciding between the iPad Air or iPad Pro, there are additional details to consider, like Face ID versus Touch ID, storage options, cameras, and USB-C data transfer speed. Whatever you choose, it's worth noting that both come recommended as the best iPads you can buy. Let's dive in.\n\nApple iPad Pro (2022)\n\nThe 2022 iPad Pro remains the most capable tablet in Apple's current iPad lineup. It's available in two sizes, 11 and 12.9 inches, and features the M2 processor, which makes it faster than previous generations and unlocks the \"hover\" feature for the Apple Pencil. If you want the best of the best and are willing to pay for it, the 2022 iPad Pro is worth a look.\n\nApple iPad Air (2022)\n\nThe portable 2022 iPad Air offers Pro-model performance for a lower price. It has a sharp screen, Touch ID, and support for the 2nd-gen or USB-C Apple Pencil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\niPad Air (2022) vs. iPad Pro (2022): Specs\n\nSpecificationiPad Air (2022)11-inch iPad Pro (2022)12.9-inch iPad Pro (2022)Display10.9-inch Liquid Retina (2,360 x 1,640)\n\n11-inch Liquid Retina with ProMotion (2,388 x 1,668)\n\n12.9-inch Liquid Retina XDR mini-LED with ProMotion (2,732 x 2,048)ProcessorApple M1Apple M2Apple M2Memory (RAM) 8GB RAM8GB, 16GB8GB, 16GBStorage64GB, 256GB128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TBRear cameras12MP main camera12MP main camera, 10MP ultra-wide camera12MP main camera, 10MP ultra-wide cameraFront camera12MP ultra-wide FaceTime HD camera with Center Stage12MP ultra-wide TrueDepth camera with Center Stage12MP ultra-wide TrueDepth camera with Center StageBattery28.6 Wh; 20W charger included28.65 Wh; 20W charger included40.88 Wh; 20W charger includedConnectivityWi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5, 5G sub-6 (optional)Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.3, 5G sub-6 and mmWave (optional)Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.3, 5G sub-6 and mmWave (optional)AuthenticationTouch IDFace IDFace IDPortsUSB-C, up to 10Gb/s (USB 3.1 Gen 2)USB-C, up to 40Gb/s (Thunderbolt 3, USB 4)USB-C, up to 40Gb/s (Thunderbolt 3, USB 4)AudioStereo speakersFour speakersFour speakersStarting price$599$799$1,099\n\nAdvertisement\n\niPad Air (2022) vs. iPad Pro (2022): Performance\n\nApple's M-series processors are serious hardware — they're the same chips you'll find in a range of Apple computers. That kind of power makes iPads ideal portable companions to desktop workstations, or even as primary creation devices.\n\nWhile both iPads were released in 2022, the iPad Air's M1 processor debuted toward the end of 2020, so it's older than the iPad Pro's M2 processor, which Apple released in June 2022. That age gap is reflected in benchmark results, but the M1 chip is still a workhorse that should please anyone who needs a mobile powerhouse.\n\nIn fact, the iPad Air renders a short 10-minute 4K video with light editing in Premiere Rush in the same amount of time as the iPad Pro.\n\nHowever, the iPad Pro is the iPad of choice if peak performance for more complex editing is necessary and your budget allows for it. Plus, the iPad Pro will likely keep up with power-hungry workloads for a year longer than the iPad Air, if not longer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\niPad Air (2022) vs. iPad Pro (2022): Display\n\nApple reserved its excellent 120Hz ProMotion display technology for the iPad Pro models, which delivers an ultra-premium smooth visual experience while navigating around iPadOS. Meanwhile, the iPad Air's display is a more moderate and standard 60Hz, which should be familiar if you've used standard iPads and non-Pro iPhones in the past.\n\nAs far as display quality, the iPad Air and 11-inch iPad Pros share the same Liquid Retina Display and just about the same screen size. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro has a superior Liquid Retina XDR display based on Mini-LED backlighting, which provides a brighter, more accurate, and crisper visual experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\niPad Air (2022) vs. iPad Pro (2022): Storage\n\nWhile the base iPad Air offers tempting value, one of its biggest drawbacks is its paltry 64GB of storage, which can be a disadvantage for those working with big content files, like high-resolution video.\n\nIf you need more storage, you'll have to upgrade to the $749 256GB iPad Air — a price that's mighty close to the base 128GB iPad Pro. If you know that 128GB is all you need, spending the extra $50 on the base iPad Pro can be easily justified.\n\nExternal storage devices are another option to add space to an iPad Air or iPad Pro, but they're not ideal for casual, everyday usage. Rather, they're best used for projects. Both models differ in transfer speeds via their USB-C ports, with the iPad Air peaking at 10Gb/s (USB Gen 3.1 Gen 2), and the iPad Pros can muster up to 40Gb/s (Thunderbolt 3/USB 4).\n\nThe iPad Air's 10Gb/s USB-C transfer rates should suffice for most projects — theoretically, it should transfer a huge 10-gigabyte file to and from an external drive in one second. If you're working with even larger, nay, humongous files, you'll feel the benefits of the iPad Pro's 40Gb/s second transfer rate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\niPad Air (2022) vs. iPad Pro (2022): Touch ID, Face ID, and cameras\n\nThe iPad Air is unlocked with a Touch ID sensor on the power button located on the edge of the tablet. Apple makes it easy to find with an on-screen prompt to show you where to lay your finger, but I've found it temperamental with finger placement and unresponsive to damp or excessively dry fingers. I have to reapply my fingertip to the Touch ID sensor, or tap my PIN code, more often than I'd like because the Touch ID sensor doesn't properly register my fingerprint the first few times.\n\nThe iPad Pros use Face ID for unlocking, which is more reliable and works significantly better. It's not a good enough reason on its own to spend more on the iPad Pro, but it's still something to consider when looking at the overall picture.\n\nThe iPad Pros also include a dual camera that actually produces decent photos and videos compared to the iPad Air's single, merely serviceable camera. Still, the iPad Pro's superior cameras aren't clinchers — most people use their phones for photos and videos, and transferring from an iPhone to an iPad is incredibly easy with AirDrop. And professionals may opt for professional gear depending on the project, anyway. I suppose it can be handy to have an all-in-one camera and workstation.\n\nThe iPad Pro cameras include a LiDAR scanner, which captures photos of objects or spaces (like a room) in 3D so you can navigate around the object or space from the iPad Pro's display. It's pretty neat, and it could be useful to have on hand if you work in some kind of design role. These 3D images could even be used in augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR).\n\nBoth the iPad Air and iPad Pro's front-facing cameras are on the short side of the tablet, which is a shame for video calls. It means your video feed will always show your face at a slight angle instead of directly in front. Still, at least both tablets support Center Stage, which keeps the focus on you, even when you're moving around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\niPad Air (2022) vs. iPad Pro (2022): Apple Pencil support\n\nBoth the iPad Air and iPad Pros support Apple's second-generation Apple Pencil, but only the iPad Pro supports Apple's Hover feature thanks to the M2 processor. Whether you use a second-generation Apple Pencil for intricate drawings or taking simple notes, the Hover feature can be the hook to go for the iPad Pro.\n\nHover gives you a preview of exactly where the second-generation Apple Pencil's tip will land on the iPad Pro's screen when you hover it up to 12mm above. If you've ever wished you the Apple Pencil had more precision, Hover is the fix.\n\nBeyond added precision, Hover also enables shortcuts when you hover and linger the second-generation Apple Pencil's tip above certain on-screen items. It can even preview how a color will blend with another color on your artwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\niPad Air (2022) vs. iPad Pro (2022): Which should you buy?\n\nYour budget should easily decide which iPad to go for, whether it's the iPad Air or the iPad Pro. If $600 is your limit, the iPad Air won't disappoint. From a sheer value standpoint, the iPad Air should also satisfy most people.\n\nBut if your budget allows, is it worth spending at least $200 more for the iPad Pro? It's a similar conundrum when deciding between the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro — both are great, but you have to consider whether the Pro's extra features are worth it.\n\nThe M2 processor's performance gains aren't massive, but the iPad Pro should maintain usable performance for longer than the iPad Air. You'll also appreciate the smooth ProMotion display and Face ID. And if you frequently use an Apple Pencil, the iPad Pro's Hover feature could be enough reason to opt for the iPad Pro.\n\nStorage requirement also dictates which model you should go for. If you need up to 128GB of storage, you're better off spending the extra $50 on the base 11-inch iPad Pro. That way, you'll get the newer processor, ProMotion display, and other iPad Pro goodies like Face ID and Hover for Apple Pencil.\n\nIf you need more storage, you could save $150 by going for the $749 256GB iPad Air rather than the $899 256GB iPad Pro, but you won't be disappointed by upgrading to the Pro. Storage options for the iPad Air halt at 256GB, so the iPad Pro is your only option if you need even more space.\n\nAntonio Villas-Boas\n\nSenior Tech Reporter\n\nAntonio is a senior tech reporter for Insider's Reviews team, where he helps lead coverage, reviews, and guides of smartphones, tablets, accessories, wearables, smart home products, as well as audio devices from Apple, Google, Samsung, OnePlus, and other major tech companies.
