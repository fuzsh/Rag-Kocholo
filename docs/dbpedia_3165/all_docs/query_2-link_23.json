        "text": "Which iPad Air models support cellular networking? What are the differences between the cellular networking on each model? Which iPad Air models use which type of SIM? Nano? Apple SIM? eSIM?\n\nEach iPad Air series, from the original to the current line, have at least one model that supports cellular networking. However, models from different generations, and even within generations, have different capabilities.\n\nPhoto Credit: Apple, Inc. (Cellular iPad Air 3 Models)\n\nPhysically, it is possible to tell that an iPad Air model supports some kind of cellular networking if it has a plastic panel or an antenna line on the back toward the top of the case, but this is not sufficient to determine the generation or the specific wireless capabilities.\n\nCellular Capable iPad Air Models\n\nThe Model Number is the easiest way to establish the precise iPad Air model; externally displayed toward the bottom on the back of each device:\n\niPad Air\n\nModel No\n\niPad Air (Wi-Fi/Cellular)\n\nA1475\n\niPad Air (Wi-Fi/TD-LTE - China)\n\nA1476\n\niPad Air 2 (Wi-Fi/Cellular)\n\nA1567\n\niPad Air 3 (Wi-Fi+Cell US/CA)\n\nA2153\n\niPad Air 3 (Wi-Fi+Cell Global)\n\nA2123\n\niPad Air 3 (Wi-Fi+Cell China)\n\nA2154\n\niPad Air 4 (Wi-Fi+Cell US/CA)\n\nA2324\n\niPad Air 4 (Wi-Fi+Cell Global)\n\nA2072\n\niPad Air 4 (Wi-Fi+Cell China)\n\nA2325\n\niPad Air 5 (Wi-Fi+Cell)\n\nA2589\n\niPad Air 5 (Wi-Fi+Cell China)\n\nA2591\n\niPad Air M2 11\" (Wi-Fi+Cell)\n\nA2903*\n\niPad Air M2 11\" (Wi-Fi+Cell China)\n\nA2904*\n\niPad Air M2 13\" (Wi-Fi+Cell)\n\nA2899*\n\niPad Air M2 13\" (Wi-Fi+Cell China)\n\nA2900*\n\nIf an iPad Air is not listed above, it does not support cellular networking, but it rather is a Wi-Fi only model.\n\nTo track down a specific iPad Air by a variety of different identifiers, please refer to the Ultimate iLookup feature.\n\niPad Air Cellular Differences\n\nAll cellular-equipped iPad Air models support 2G GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).
