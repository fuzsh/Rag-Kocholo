        "text": "Why you can trust ZDNET\n\n33 years of experience\n\n30 hands-on product reviewers\n\n10,000 square feet of lab space\n\nWhat to Consider\n\n+ -\n\nPurpose\n\nTablets serve different purposes for different users, so the purpose of your soon-to-be tablet is worth considering when choosing the right one. Kids may use one to play and stream, while adults may use one for reading or graphic design. If you’re looking for an entertainment tablet, it’s worth considering one with a high-resolution display and good speakers. If you need one for productivity or work, you’re better off with a strong processor and the ability to use it with a keyboard or stylus.\n\n+ -\n\nPerformance\n\nA tablet is only as good as it performs, so if a fast processor and good responsiveness are essential to you, look for tablets with a powerful processor. Storage is equally important; larger RAM translates into better multitasking capabilities. Also consider internal storage and if there are options for expandable storage.\n\n+ -\n\nOperating system and compatibility\n\niPhone users may prefer an iPad with seamless integration with more Apple products, like AirPods being able to switch between the iPhone and iPad without intervention. The same can be true for Samsung fans. Android tablets feature various brands and models, have more customization power, and are available in wider price ranges. Windows tablets are good for productivity, especially if you need compatibility across desktop apps.\n\n+ -\n\nPrice\n\nThe price range will narrow down the list of tablets considerably. These devices are already expensive to start, but budget and premium options are available. It’s worth considering if high-end features justify the cost for your needs.\n\n+ -\n\nBattery life\n\nLook for long battery life, especially if you plan to use your tablet on the go. You’ll need it to last for the duration of your task.\n\n+ -\n\nExtra features\n\nSome extra features may be exclusive to only some tablets, so consider whether these are important. These features include camera quality, headphone jack, USB-C charging port, weight, compatibility with accessories, and size.\n\nApple iPad (10th generation) | Best tablet overall\n\nApple iPad (10th generation)\n\nBest tablet overall\n\nView now View at Amazon\n\nAmazon Fire Max 11 | Best Amazon Tablet\n\nAmazon Fire Max 11\n\nBest Amazon Tablet\n\nView now View at Amazon\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra | Best Samsung Tablet\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra\n\nBest Samsung Tablet\n\nView now View at Samsung\n\nOnePlus Pad | Best Android tablet for entertainment\n\nOnePlus Pad\n\nBest Android tablet for entertainment\n\nView now View at Amazon\n\nMicrosoft Surface Go 3 | Best compact Windows tablet\n\nMicrosoft Surface Go 3\n\nBest compact Windows tablet\n\nView now View at Amazon\n\nApple iPad Pro (7th generation) | Best laptop replacement tablet\n\nApple iPad Pro (7th generation)\n\nBest laptop replacement tablet\n\nView now View at Amazon\n\nGoogle Pixel Tablet | Best Android tablet\n\nGoogle Pixel Tablet\n\nBest Android tablet\n\nView now View at Best Buy\n\nApple iPad Air (5th generation) | Best middle-of-the-road tablet\n\nApple iPad Air (5th generation)\n\nBest middle-of-the-road tablet\n\nView now View at Best Buy\n\nWacom Intuos Pro | Best tablet for drawing\n\nWacom Intuos Pro\n\nBest tablet for drawing\n\nView now View at Amazon\n\nAmazon Kindle Scribe | Best tablet for reading\n\nAmazon Kindle Scribe\n\nBest tablet for reading\n\nView now View at Amazon\n\nAmazon Fire HD 8 Kids Tablet | Best tablet for kids\n\nAmazon Fire HD 8 Kids Tablet\n\nBest tablet for kids\n\nView now View at Amazon\n\nShow more (6 items)\n\nTablets have come a long way since the first iPad was released in 2010. Once a device designed simply for consuming content and playing games (anyone remember the days of Fruit Ninja?), it has, for many, become a full-fledged computer replacement, allowing them to get real work done. A good tablet should have a long battery life, a respectable selection of apps and services, and more functionality than just a screen to watch YouTube videos.\n\nAlso: The best cheap tablets you can buy\n\nWith so many tablets on the market today from brands like Apple, Samsung, Google, Amazon, and more, it can take time to choose one, but ultimately, it comes down to what you need the tablet for.\n\nWhat is the best tablet right now?\n\nZDNET went hands-on with tons of the best tablets on the market, using them for work and entertainment and even testing them out with our kids. Our pick for the best tablet for most people is the Apple iPad (10th generation), thanks to its versatility and lightweight form. Read on to find the best tablet for your needs.\n\nThe best tablets of 2024\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nModernized design with a USB-C port\n\nLandscape front-facing camera is superior to other iPad models\n\nFour new colors to choose from\n\nCons\n\nDongle required to charge Apple Pencil (1st gen)\n\nApple iPad (10th generation)\n\nBest tablet overall\n\nApple's tried-and-true tablet, the base model iPad, is arguably the best value in the Company's tablet lineup, especially thanks to its versatility and compatibility. Plus, Apple just lowered the price on this tablet by $100, making it affordable at $349.\n\nWhen it comes to features, you essentially get the same suite as the more expensive iPad Pro and iPad Air models, but in a lighter form factor and a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina, True Tone display. Additionally, this model breaks out of the iPad's traditional space gray and silver color palette, adding pink, blue, and yellow in addition to sleek silver.\n\nReview: iPad 2022 (10th Gen): Better than the Pro in two ways\n\nIn his hands-on testing, ZDNET reviews editor June Wan determined that if you're shopping on a budget, last year's iPad should \"make the most sense,\" especially given the A14 Bionic processor, USB-C support, 5G support for on-the-go tasks, and a new 12MP ultra-wide camera. There's also a Magic Keyboard Folio made specifically for this iPad. It includes an adjustable kickstand with a 14-key function row for shortcuts.\n\nHowever, Apple customers point out that this iPad doesn't support the 2nd gen Apple Pencil, which means you'll have to use a dongle to use it.\n\nApple iPad specs: Display: 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display with True Tone | Processor: A14 Bionic chip with 16-core Neural Engine | Storage: 64GB or 256GB | Biometrics: Touch ID | Colors: Silver, Pink, Blue, Yellow | Cameras: 12MP f/1.8 wide, 12MP Landscape f/2.4 front | Weight: 1.05 pounds | Dimensions: 9.79 x 7.07 x .28 inches | Connections: USB-C, Smart Connector | Battery life: Up to 10 hours of video playback with USB-C charging\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nAffordably priced, especially when bundled\n\nSolid battery life\n\nNew, modernized design\n\nCons\n\nPerformance is just alright\n\nImportant productivity apps are missing\n\nAmazon Fire Max 11\n\nBest Amazon Tablet\n\nThe Fire Max 11 is Amazon's newest and best tablet yet. It still runs Fire OS, which means you'll lose access to any of Google's apps and services. However, Amazon's own App Store has many of the same apps that regular Android devices have access to -- including Netflix, Facebook, and Spotify.\n\nWith a starting price of $229, the Fire Max 11 brings an 11-inch display, 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage with support for 1TB of microSD card storage. If you're looking for a tablet for work and play, the Fire Max 11 Productivity Bundle costs $329, but comes with a keyboard with touchpad, case and a stylus.\n\nReview: Amazon Fire Max 11: Easily the best Fire tablet yet\n\nZDNET contributor, Jason Cipriani, went hands-on with the Amazon Fire Max 11 and said that it is \"easily the best Fire Tablet Amazon has made yet.\" \"The Fire Max 11 productivity bundle provides everything you need to get some work done on the small and affordable tablet, as long as your work can be done in Microsoft's suite of apps and services, or in sites that work properly with Amazon's Silk Browser,\" he wrote.\n\nOverall, 94% of Best Buy customers would recommend this tablet, giving it an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.\n\nAmazon Fire Max 11 specs: Display: 11-inch, 2000 x 1200, 410 nits brightness, 213 ppi | Processor: MediaTek MT8188J, 2.2Ghz Octacore processor | Storage: 64GB or 128GB | Memory: 4GB | Colors: Gray | Cameras: 8MP rear and 8MP front-facing camera | Weight: 490 grams | Dimensions: 259.1 x 163.7 x 7.50 millimeters | Connections: 3.5mm headphone jack, USB-C port | Battery life: 14 hours\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nImproved Dynamic AMOLED display\n\nIP68 water and dust resistant\n\nUltra responsive S Pen\n\nCons\n\nNot the most portable tablet\n\nOccasional app crashes\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra\n\nBest Samsung Tablet\n\nIf you're looking for an Android tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra is one of the best Android tablets. The Tab S9 Ultra features a 14.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED display, runs on the Android 13 operating system, and Samsung's S Pen stylus is included in the box.\n\nThe base model comes with 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage, and a microSD card for adding up to an extra 1TB of storage to the tablet, the combination of which should be enough for most. Plus, new for this generation is IP68 water and dust resistant, that neither the iPad nor any premium tablet on the market is certified for.\n\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra: This tablet can truly replace your laptop\n\nZDNET's Maria Diaz reviewed the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra and said, that while it looks and feels the same as last year, the upgrades give it a definitive edge over the competition. She also described the tablet as \"The perfect device for a professional that seeks the power of a laptop and the flexibility of a tablet.\"\n\nIf you opt for the $350 Book Cover Keyboard, you'll be able to use Samsung DeX on the S9 Ultra, effectively turning the tablet into an Android-powered 2-in-1 device with plenty of space for multitasking and using more than one app at a time. Reddit users say that the S9 Ultra with this keyboard case will feel like a laptop, in terms of looks and weight.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra specs: Display: 14.6-inch, 120Hz refresh rate, Dynamic AMOLED 2X 2960 x 1848 display | Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy | Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | Memory: 12GB, 16GB | Colors: Graphite and beige | Cameras: Rear: 13MP main, 8MP ultrawide, Front: 12MP main, 12MP ultrawide | Weight: 1.6lb | Dimensions: 12.85 x 8.21 x 0.22 inches | Connections: 5G, LTE, Wi-Fi 6E, Wi-Fi Direct Bluetooth 5.3 | Battery: 11,200mAh\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nDisplay looks good\n\nSolid performance\n\nBattery life\n\nCons\n\nAndroid apps still need tablet improvements\n\nNot a tablet for productivity\n\nIt looks and acts a lot like an iPad\n\nOnePlus Pad\n\nBest Android tablet for entertainment\n\nOnePlus is better known for its smartphone lineup where the company has led the way with producing phones that include a ton of features and performance while undercutting the competition when it comes to cost. And for the most part, that's exactly what's happened with the OnePlus Pad.\n\nThis Android-powered tablet has month-long battery standby, along with impressive daily battery life. Cipriani reviewed this tablet and found it quick and snappy for daily tasks like checking your email, playing games or browsing the web, all on a display that looks fantastic.\n\nReview: OnePlus Pad: A tablet for Android fans who secretly want an iPad\n\n\"One aspect of the overall experience I enjoyed using was the multitasking features built into OxygenOS, the operating system the Pad runs, Cipriani wrote. \"More specifically, I found myself frequently using a quick gesture on the display to effectively split the display in half, putting one app on the left side of the screen, and a second on the other half. A two-finger swipe down from the top of the screen was all it took.\"\n\nOnePlus also sells a keyboard case and a stylus for the OnePlus Pad, which more or less turns the OnePlus Pad into an iPad Pro dupe. However, verified customers who have bought and used this tablet say online that trackpad gestures and navigation are finicky, and a lot of the same interface features -- such as the mouse pointer -- on the OnePlus Pad come straight from Apple's iPadOS interface for the same feature.\n\nOnePlus Pad specs: Display: 11.61-inch, 144Hz refresh rate, LCD 2,800x2,000 display | Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 9000 Mobile Platform | Storage: 128GB | Memory: 8GB | Colors: Halo green | Cameras: 13MP rear. 8MP front camera | Weight: 555 grams | Dimensions: 189.41 x 258.03 x 6.54mm | Connections: USB-C | Battery: 9,510mAh\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nWindows Hello\n\nLots of ports\n\nUp to 256GB storage\n\nCons\n\nCan only install apps from Microsoft Store in Windows 10 S Mode\n\nMicrosoft Surface Go 3\n\nBest compact Windows tablet\n\nThe design hasn't changed for the Go 3, meaning it should work with all of the original accessories, including the . The Go 3 has faster internals that provides a better overall experience and performance, and this time around, all three configurations of the Go 3 use an SSD instead. Previously, the combination of slower storage via an eMMC drive and the Intel Pentium processor wasn't an enjoyable experience.\n\nReview: Microsoft Surface Go 3 review: A portable and versatile 2-in-1, but battery life disappoints\n\nZDNET's Mary Branscombe tested the Surface Go 3 back in 2021 and said it \"shines as a portable device.\" It's perfect for working on an airplane tray table or a crowded train, and for throwing in a backpack. It's a small tablet, with a display of just 10.5 inches, but it runs the full Windows operating system that you can customize.\n\nIt can also run Windows 10 in S Mode, which limits you to installing apps from only the Microsoft Store, along with a few other security features. But you can opt for the full Windows 10 experience by leaving S Mode.\n\nOne Reddit user praised the Surface Go 3, saying, \"No issues running a bunch of Edge tabs, Excel, Word, and PP docs all at the same time,\" adding, \"Even media consumption is way easier on the Go 3.\"\n\nMicrosoft Surface Go 3 tech specs: Display: 10.5-inch PixelSense Display | Processor: Intel Pentium Gold or Intel Core i3 | Storage: 64GB or 256GB | Memory: 4GB or 8GB | Biometrics: Windows Hello face sign-in | Colors: Platinum | Cameras: 8MP rear, 1080p video. 5MP front facing camera | Weight: 1.07 pounds | Dimensions: 9.65 x 6.9 x 0.33 inches | Connections: 1 x USB-C, 3.5mm headphone jack, 1 x Surface Connect Port, microSD card reader | Battery life: 11 hours\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nTandem OLED display gets plenty bright\n\nM4 processor is fast, reliable, and for everyone\n\nStrongest accessory ecosystem yet\n\nCons\n\niPadOS still feels inconsistent and limited\n\nAccessories are expensive but almost mandatory\n\nApple iPad Pro (7th generation)\n\nBest laptop replacement tablet\n\nApple's 2024 iPad Pro lineup is by far the most capable and impressive iPad lineup we've seen, and it makes replacing your laptop with a tablet an easy decision. The design is much slimmer than previous Pro models, and you'll find Apple's powerful M4 processor. This chip consists of a new 10-core GPU, next-generation machine learning accelerators to handle a diverse range of tasks, and ProMotion technology, enabling variable screen refresh rates ranging from 10 to 120Hz.\n\nWan spent some time with the 13-inch Apple iPad Pro and was especially impressed by the new Tandem OLED screen. \"In practice, Tandem OLED makes the iPad Pro a phenomenal tablet for visual experiences. I've been able to complete text-heavy and photo-editing work -- which often require adequate viewing angles -- under a New York City sun that thinks it's already summer,\" Wan wrote in his review. \"Watching Netflix and Disney+ on the iPad is straight eye candy; colors pop, and the darker, moodier scenes have a level of shadow detail unseen on older Pro models.\"\n\nReview: I replaced my MacBook with an M4 iPad Pro and was less bothered than I expected\n\nThe Pro also supports the new Apple Pencil Pro, which has range of features including a squeeze gesture for quick tool, color, and other changes, a gyroscope for precise control of pens and brush tools with a simple rotation, and custom haptic feedback that you can feel via a pulse. It also pairs with the newly revamped Magic Keyboard which is thinner and lighter, has a larger trackpad, and a new row of function keys this year make the keyboard case more essential than ever for the full iPad experience.\n\nApple iPad Pro tech specs: Display: 13-inch Ultra Retina XDR OLED display with ProMotion | Processor: Apple Silicon M4 | Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB or 2TB | Biometrics: Face ID | Colors: Silver, space black | Cameras: 12MP wide (4K, ProRes), Landscape 12MP ultra-wide | Weight: 1.23 pounds | Dimensions: 11.09 x 8.48 x 0.24 inches | Connections: USB-C connector with support for Thunderbolt / USB 4 | Battery life: Up to 10 hours of surfing the web\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nGood performance and battery life\n\nFinally, Android tablet apps done right\n\nThe Charging Speaker Dock makes it a Nest Hub\n\nCons\n\nNo official keyboard case\n\nHub Mode could use some quality-of-life improvements\n\nGoogle Pixel Tablet\n\nBest Android tablet\n\nGoogle's first Android tablet in years is exactly what Android tablets should have been all along. It's true, not all apps are optimized for the larger screen, but Google's gotten clever in the way it handles those apps, while also getting a bunch of developers on board with updating their apps for the bigger display.\n\nReview: Google Pixel Tablet: What Android tablets should have been all along\n\n\"When you open an app on the Pixel tablet, the app stays confined to a phone-like column view that takes up effectively a third of the tablet's display,\" Cipriani notes in his hands-on review. \"The app can live on the left edge of the screen, in the middle or on the right edge. You move it by double tapping in the blank space on either side of it.\"\n\nNot only is the app experience better with the Pixel Tablet, but it pulls double duty acting as a smart home hub when it's not in use thanks to the included Charging Speaker Dock. The $129 accessory (if you want to buy extras) has a built-in speaker that ups the bass by 4x, while enabling a hub mode feature that effectively makes the Pixel Tablet more like a Nest Hub, instead of a tablet.\n\nUnfortunately, right now there isn't any sort of official keyboard or stylus for those who want to get some work done on the Pixel Tablet. Customers who have bought the tablet have voiced on Reddit that they mainly use it for media consumption and that it does the job for that purpose.\n\nGoogle Pixel Tablet tech specs: Display: 10.95-inch LCD, 2560x1600, 500 nits | Processor: Google Tensor G2| Storage: 128GB or 256GB | Biometrics: Fingerprint sensor | Colors: Hazel, rose, porcelain | Cameras: 8MP front, 8MP rear | Weight: 17.39 ounces | Dimensions: 10.2 x 6.7 x 0.3 inches | Connections: USB-C, pogo pins | Battery life: Up to 12 hours of video playback\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nGreat battery life\n\nM1 processor\n\n4K video capable\n\nUp to 256GB storage\n\nCons\n\nOnly one USB-C port\n\nApple iPad Air (5th generation)\n\nBest middle-of-the-road tablet\n\nApple's latest update to the iPad Air is more of a catch-up announcement than anything. The 5th-generation iPad Air keeps the same design we saw Apple bring to the Air in late 2020, but it now boasts an M1 processor and 5G connectivity.\n\nThe Apple iPad Air still sits confidently between the base iPad and the iPad Pro when you look at price, but it's effectively caught up to the iPad Pro in terms of performance. With a 10.9-inch display, a Touch ID sensor that doubles as a power button on the side of its housing, it's more affordable and slightly different than the iPad Pro. The new iPad Air still works with the Magic Keyboard and 2nd generation Apple Pencil.\n\nReview: iPad Air (2022) review: So good I almost regret buying my iPad Pro\n\nWhere the iPad Pro is the model for those who want nothing but the best, the iPad Air is the model for those who want to use the tablet for work and play, without big sacrifices in performance or features. In our review, we said the iPad Air is \"where your search should begin and, likely, end\" if you're in the market for an iPad.\n\nUltimately, we think the more Apple pays attention to the iPad Air, the less the 11-inch iPad Pro makes sense, and customers agree. Overall, 98% of Best Buy customers who bought the iPad Air would recommend it to others and gave it an overall rating of 4.8 out of 5.\n\nApple iPad Air tech specs: Display: 10.9-inch Retina display | Processor: Apple Silicon M1 | Storage: 64GB or 256GB | Biometrics: Touch ID | Colors: Space gray, starlight, pink, purple, blue | Cameras: 12MP rear, 4K video. 12MP Ultra Wide camera | Weight: 1.02 pounds | Dimensions: 9.74 x 7.02 x 0.24 inches | Connections: USB-C port | Battery life: 10 hours\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nThree sizes to choose from\n\nIndustry-leading amount of pressure sensitivity levels\n\nIncluded stylus\n\nCons\n\nNeed an external screen to use\n\nNeed to replace the nibs of the stylus often\n\nWacom Intuos Pro\n\nBest tablet for drawing\n\nWhen it comes to drawing tablets, Wacom is one of the industry leaders. With virtually no lag and 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity in the battery-free pen included, this no-screen tablet is the best one on the market for professional artists looking to create while providing a natural drawing experience.\n\nWhile this writer's experience using it as a non-artist was simply for fun, professional artists and graphic designers will appreciate the Pro Pen 2's sensitive pressure points that allow you to go light and thin or dark and thick with your strokes. You can use the tablet to zoom in and out of your artwork, making fine-tuning details a breeze. Reddit users note that the Pro Pen 2 is better than anything they have experienced in a stylus and that it alone is worth buying the Wacom Intuos Pro for.\n\nReview: This Wacom drawing tablet feels like putting pen to paper\n\nThe possibilities are endless when it comes to creativity with the Wacom Intuos Pro tablet, and that is reinforced with a fully-customizable ExpressKeys located on the side of the active area. These buttons allow for artists to add their most-used tools for them to easily access. Its lightweight design is perfect for using it on a desk or on your lap, and with multiple sizes available, you can use this practically anywhere. This tablet connects to both Windows and Mac devices.\n\nYou'll also get free access to drawing-specific apps and services, like Clip Studio Paint Pro for two years, Boris Optics for one, and have the option to test Corel Painter Essentials 8 and Corel AfterShot Pro 3 for 90 days.\n\nWacom Intuos Pro tech specs: Display: Small, medium, or large | Weight: 0.99-2.86 pounds | Dimensions: ‎16.79 x 11.19 x 0.31 inches | Connections: USB and Bluetooth\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nImpressive battery life\n\nIncluded pen for handwritten notes\n\nCompatible with Microsoft Word\n\nCons\n\nPremium pen upgrade will cost you more\n\nDoes not support note-taking on magazines or newspapers\n\nAmazon Kindle Scribe\n\nBest tablet for reading\n\nThe Kindle Scribe is perhaps the perfect example of part e-reader, part tablet to satisfy your reading and note-taking needs. It has the same functions you've come to know and love in a Kindle, like 300 ppi glare-free screen, weeks of battery life, and adjustable warm light. It's also compatible with Amazon's Basic or Premium Pen, so you can take handwritten notes or underline important quotations within the book you're reading.\n\nYour notes are automatically organized in one place for every book, so you can browse, review, and export them via email. The Kindle Scribe also comes with preset templates to help you create notebooks, journals, and lists, and you can create sticky notes in Microsoft Word and other compatible Word documents.\n\nReview: Amazon Kindle Scribe\n\nZDNET contributing writer, Matthew Miller, went hands-on with the Kindle Scribe and called it \"close to perfect.\" \"I use my Kindle Scribe daily as my primary note-taking device, and the habit of carrying it has also resulted in me reading more books than I have in years,\" Miller wrote. \"It's an excellent ebook device while also serving as a capable working tablet.\"\n\nThe Kindle Scribe comes with the Basic pen, but verified Amazon customers say it's best to opt for the $30 premium pen so you get more advanced features like a dedicated eraser and the shortcut button.\n\nAmazon Kinde Scribe tech specs: Display: 10.2-inch 300 ppi Paperwhite display | Storage: 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB | Weight: 15.3 ounces | Dimensions: 7.7 x 9.0 x .22 inches | Connections: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB-C | Battery life: Up to 12 weeks (at 30 minutes per day)\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nAffordable\n\nKids edition has many perks\n\nEasy to use\n\nCons\n\nPerformance will be an issue\n\nAmazon's Appstore is hit or miss\n\nAmazon Fire HD 8 Kids Tablet\n\nBest tablet for kids\n\nAmazon just updated this tablet model in 2022, making it faster and with a longer battery life. Not only does it have a kid-proof case built to withstand 3 to 7-year-olds, but it also comes with a free one-year subscription to Amazon Kids+.\n\nThe tablet also grants users an Amazon Kids+ subscription, which grants you access to thousands of kid-friendly ad-free books, as well as movies, games and other kid-friendly and educational content. Parents who purchased this tablet on Best Buy give it an average rating of 4.7 out of 5, and 95% would recommend it to other parents.\n\nReview: I bought this Amazon kids tablet instead of an iPad and wasn't sorry\n\n\"The Fire HD 8 Kids tablet is a well-built, entry-level tablet that comes with a sturdy kid-proof cover and features useful parental controls,\" wrote ZDNET's Maria Diaz, who bought the tablet for her kids. \"Its 13-hour battery life means that you'll need to charge it less often than other competitors, and the combination of a durable case and screen ensures the integrity of the Fire tablet for years to come.\"\n\nThe tablet's kid-friendly case is also worth mentioning, because it protects against drops and bumps, and it comes complete with an adjustable stand so your kids can go hands-free. But Amazon does offer you a two-year worry-free guarantee in case the tablet does succumb to playtime.\n\nAmazon Fire HD 8 Kids tech specs: Display: 8-inch display | Processor: Hexa-core 2.0 Ghz | Storage: 32GB or 64GB (expandable by up to 1 TB) | Memory: 2GB | Colors: Blue, purple, Disney Mickey Mouse, or Disney princess | Cameras: 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording | Weight: 18.3 ounces | Dimensions: 8.7 x 7.1 x 1.1 inches| Connections: 3.5mm headphone jack, USB-C port | Battery life: 13 hours\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nWhat is the best tablet?\n\nAfter going hands-on with all of these tablets, the 10th-generation iPad is our pick for the best tablet. It has a battery life of up to 10 hours, up to 256GB of storage, and a lightweight design that's perfect for working or streaming movies on the go. Its fairly affordable price tag also makes it a great choice for students who need a mobile work computer.\n\nIf you want to see quickly how the 10th-generation iPad specifically compares to the other tablets that made our list, see the handy chart below that compares factors like price, storage, and display size.\n\nWhich is the right tablet for you?\n\nThe biggest question you'll need to answer about any tablet purchase is what you plan on using it for: Do you just want something to read a comic book and binge on some Netflix shows while you walk on the treadmill? If so, then a Fire tablet or the base model iPad is going to be more than enough for you.\n\nHowever, if you want to use a tablet more like a laptop, then you'll want to consider the iPad Pro, or one of the Surface devices. Here is a decision matrix that can help you choose which tablet is right for you:\n\nFactors to consider when choosing the best tablets:\n\nThese were the factors that were most important to us when making our top picks:\n\nFeature sets: Not all tablets are created equal. Some are better for kids, others are simply for artists, and then there's the mini laptop for working professionals and students. We considered a variety of use-cases to match virtually every need.\n\nPrice points: Tablets are an expensive piece of tech, especially if you're planning on investing in compatible accessories or buying for your kids to inevitably drop at a moment's notice,\n\nIntegrations with other products: We considered options that can work with a smart case, attachable keyboard, Apple Pencil, or Stylus, and other work and entertainment add-ons.\n\nBattery life: Whether you're using your tablet for work or play (or both), you'll want it to last the duration of your task.\n\nHow did we test these tablets?\n\nWhen choosing the best tablets, ZDNET editors considered our own experiences testing and using these tablets. We do extensive hands-on testing of tablets, including ease using them for work and entertainment, and paying attention to specs like display, battery life, and overall experience while using the tablet.\n\nFor products we recommend, we write a product spotlight review that we update periodically with new features and pricing information.\n\nWhat does it mean if a tablet is Wi-Fi only?\n\nWhen a tablet says that it is \"Wi-Fi Only,\" that means that it requires a wireless internet connection to access things like email, websites, and apps. There are models available that give you the option to use LTE cellular data to connect to the internet, but if you aren't planning on traveling with your tablet, you can stick to a Wi-Fi only model.\n\nIs a tablet better than a laptop?\n\nThat depends on what you want to use your tablet or laptop for. Digital artists tend to prefer tablets since they're easier to draw on with a stylus. Tablets are also great for photo editing and streaming movies if you get one with a large enough screen size. But if you want to do things like create spreadsheets, type in a word processing program, or do intensive 3D animation or modeling, you're better off with a laptop.\n\nAre there alternative tablets worth considering?\n\nOf course, the tablet market is more than just these 10 picks above. There are plenty of other options from different brands at various price points if you're looking for additional tablets.\n\nView at AmazonView at AmazonView at AmazonView at Apple\n\nEditorial standards"
