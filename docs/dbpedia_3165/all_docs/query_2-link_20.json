It is only 7.5 millimeters thin and weighs just 469 grams, making it the lightest slate of this size. Its screen is identical to the one we know from its predecessor - a 9.7-inch Retina Display with oleophobic coating and resolution of 1536 by 2048 pixels. Under the hood, Apple has chosen to install its A7 chip, which is the very same 64-bit SoC powering the iPhone 5s. As a result, the new iPad is two times faster than the previous model. With the 5MP iSight camera, one can take detailed photos and 1080p Full HD videos, while the FaceTime HD front-facing snapper is ideal for video chats and self portraits. Connecting to the internet is done either via Wi-Fi, or over a 4G LTE network, should you choose a cellular-enabled iPad Air model. Apple's iOS 7 operating system is loaded onto the tablet, with iPhoto, iMovie, GarageBand, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps included at no cost.\n\nCons\n\nThe camera lacks flash\n\nI want it 42 users\n\nI have it 71 users\n\nI had it 26 users\n\nPopular Comparisons\n\nThe Apple iPad Air is most commonly compared with these phones:\n\nSpecs Compare\n\nDisplay\n\nBenchmarks\n\nSize: 9.7 inches Resolution: 1536 x 2048 pixels, 264 PPI Technology: IPS LCD Screen-to-body: 71.65 % Colors: 16 777 216 Features: Oleophobic coating, Ambient light sensor\n\nHardware\n\nBenchmarks\n\nSystem chip: Apple A7 Processor: Dual-core, 1400 MHz, Cyclone, 64-bit GPU: PowerVR G6430 RAM: 1GB LPDDR3 Internal storage: 128GB OS: iOS (12.x, 11.x, 10.x, 9.x, 8.x, 7.x) Screenshots Device type: Tablet\n\nBattery\n\nBenchmarks\n\nCapacity: 8820 mAh Type: Li - Polymer, Not user replaceable\n\nCamera\n\nBenchmarks\n\nRear: Single camera Camera samples Main camera: 5 MP (Autofocus, BSI sensor) Specifications: Aperture size: F2.4; Focal length: 33 mm Video recording: 1920x1080 (Full HD) (30 fps) Features: Time-lapse video, EIS, Video calling Front: 1.2 MP Video capture: 1280x720 (HD) (30 fps)\n\nDesign\n\nSize comparison\n\nDimensions: 9.45 x 6.67 x 0.30 inches (240 x 169.5 x 7.5 mm) Weight: 16.86 oz (478.0 g) Materials: Back: Aluminum Keys: Right: Volume control, Other Colors: Black, Gray, Silver, White\n\nCellular\n\n4G (FDD): Bands 1(2100), 2(1900), 3(1800), 4(AWS-1), 5(850), 7(2600), 8(900), 13(700 c), 17(700 b), 18(800 Lower), 19(800 Upper), 20(800 DD), 25(1900+), 26(850+) 3G: Bands 5(850), 8(900), 2(1900), 1(2100) Data Speed: LTE, HSPA, UMTS SIM type: Nano SIM\n\nMultimedia\n\nBenchmarks\n\nHeadphones: 3.5mm jack Speakers: Multiple speakers Features: Album art cover, Background playback Screen mirroring: TV-out Additional microphone(s): Yes\n\nConnectivity & Features\n\nBluetooth: 4.0 Wi-Fi: 802.11 a, b, g, n, dual-band; Multiple antennas, MIMO, Hotspot USB: Lightning Features: Mass storage device, Charging Location: A-GPS, Glonass, Cell ID, Wi-Fi positioning Sensors: Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Compass Other: Tethering, Computer sync, OTA sync, AirDrop\n\nPhone features\n\nNotifications: Flight mode, Silent mode Other features: Voice commands, Voice recording\n\nRegulatory Approval\n\nFCC approval: Date approved: Oct 22, 2013 FCC ID value: BCGA1475 Measured SAR: Body: 1.19 W/kg Simultaneous Transmission: 1.33 W/kg\n\nBuyers information\n\nPrice: $ 929 In The Box: Lightning to USB Cable, USB Power Adapter\n\nAvailability\n\nOct 22, 2013 Officially announced: Yes\n\nDespite our efforts to provide full and correct Apple iPad Air specifications, there is always a possibility of admitting a mistake.

With so much less.\n\nThe new A7 chip in iPad Air was designed with 64-bit architecture.So you get incredible power in a device you can take with you wherever you go.\n\nThe redesigned Smart Cover and Smart Case are a perfect fit for iPad Air. They automatically wake it when opened and put it to sleep when closed. They also fold to create a great stand for reading, viewing, and typing. And they come in a whole range of colors. So they don’t just work smart, they look smart.\n\n10\n\nBuild quality\n\n8\n\nCamera quality\n\n10\n\nPerformance\n\n10\n\nDisplay\n\n9\n\nBattery life and charging\n\nWhat I like\n\nGreat os\n\nGreat ui speed\n\nVery Thin & style\n\nNice body quality\n\nA great music player\n\nLoud speaker\n\nNice display\n\nBeautiful\n\nWhat I don't like\n\nIt doesn't have touch id\n\nNo flash for behind camera\n\nDid you find this review helpful?\n\nHelpful\n\nUnhelpful\n\nSpam\n\nNot English content\n\nBad language\n\nOther\n\nReport\n\nReport\n\n3 out of 3 people found this helpful.\n\nEdit Review\n\nRead Full Review\n\npmgvsa5\n\nArena Apprentice\n\n9\n\nThis is it!!!!\n\nPhone owned for less than 3 months\n\nI have the samsung galaxy note 3 .
