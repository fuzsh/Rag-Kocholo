Order the iPad Air 6th gen, Apple Pencil Pro and a keyboard case!\n\nA comprehensive overview of the leasing program with pricing details and information on why Apple, why the iPad Air and how this device can change the way our students are learning.\n\nClick above for answers to some of the most commonly asked questions.\n\nFor example:\n\nWhat if our family does not choose to participate in the lease-to-own?\n\nWe encourage every family to invest in the iPad Air package. We recognize that some families may already have invested in a device. There are three options for students:\n\nParticipate in the Lease-to-Own Program\n\nBring your own device (devices will not be supported by NPS tech and must meet certain requirements)\n\nUse a loaner device in class as needed. Every classroom will have iPad devices available for student use. There will NOT be computers available for check out overnight, only for in-class use.\n\nWill NHS have loaner devices for students to borrow for the day or overnight?\n\nNo, students will need to have their own device at home. See options above.\n\nTake a look at the new iPad Air with the M2 chip. This fast processing device has the functionality of a laptop and the flexibility and creativity of a tablet.\n\nFrom annotation and note taking to multimedia creation, the iPad Air 6th generation with Apple Pencil Pro and Logitech keyboard allows students to mark up readings, create multimedia projects, and manage all their school work on one, accessible device."
