It was announced by Apple on September 15, 2020. Pre-orders began on October 16, 2020, and shipping began a week later on October 23, 2020 alongside the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro. The device closely resembles the design of the 11-inch iPad Pro (3rd generation) and has several features that were previously exclusive to the iPad Pro line, such as support for Magic Keyboard and the second-generation Apple Pencil. It is available in five colors: Space Gray, Silver, Rose Gold, Green, and Sky Blue.\n\nThe 4th generation iPad Air was discontinued on March 8, 2022, following the announcement of its successor, the iPad Air (5th generation).\n\nFeatures\n\n[edit]\n\nHardware\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Apple A14 Bionic SoC has 11.9 billion transistors inside, allowing for higher efficiency in terms of both power and performance. The chip has a 6-core CPU that is 40 percent faster than the A12, a 4-core GPU that is 30 percent faster, and Apple's 16-core Neural Engine, which is twice as fast and features improved machine learning.[3] The Neural Engine can process more than 11 trillion operations per second.[4]\n\nIt has a wider 60 Hz[5] 10.9-inch 2360 by 1640 Liquid Retina Display display with 3.8 million pixels. The display is laminated and has an anti-reflective coating, as well as featuring wide color and True Tone.[6]\n\nThe Home Button in the previous generation has been removed, as has the headphone jack; the Touch ID sensor has been relocated to the Sleep/Wake button attached on the top right edge of the device.[7] Landscape stereo audio effect is also added to the system's audio recording system.[8]\n\nIt features a rear 12MP camera capable of 4K video recording at up to 60fps as well as a 7MP FaceTime camera capable of 1080p 60fps video.[9]\n\nThe hardware specifications of the iPad Air (4th generation) are comparable to those of the iPad (10th generation). However, the iPad Air lacks 5G cellular data and Center Stage front camera support, whereas the iPad (10th generation) lacks a P3 Wide Color display, Apple Pencil (2nd generation) support, and Smart Keyboard Folio support.[10]\n\nConnectivity\n\n[edit]\n\nWith the release of its fourth-generation iPad Air, Apple discontinued the proprietary Lightning port in favor of a universal USB-C port that is used for charging as well as connecting external devices and accessories. The port is capable of transferring up to 5 Gbit/s (625 MB/s), allowing for fast connections to cameras and external storage, as well as support for monitors with up to 4K resolution.[11] For wireless connection, the device comes with Bluetooth 5.0 and WiFi 6 (802.11ax).[12]\n\nIt is compatible with the second-generation Apple Pencil, Magic Keyboard for iPad, and Smart Keyboard Folio.[13]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nApple's fourth-generation iPad Air has drawn criticism for being more expensive than its predecessor. In general, though, the iPad Air 4 has been widely praised by consumers and tech reviewers alike, with Henry T. Casey of Tom's Guide saying it is \"the best tablet for most people\" and \"one of the best iPads ever,\"[14] and with James Peckham of TechRadar calling it \"a phenomenally well-made tablet.\"[15] PCMag.com included the iPad Air (4th generation) in its Best Tech Products of the Year list in 2020 and awarded it their Editors' Choice for high-end tablets.[16]\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Apple was praised for keeping Touch ID integrated into the power button instead of Face ID, because early on in the pandemic, Face ID was unable to work when a user was wearing a face covering.[17][18]\n\nTimeline\n\n[edit]\n\nTimeline of iPad models\n\nSource: Apple Newsroom Archive.[19]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
