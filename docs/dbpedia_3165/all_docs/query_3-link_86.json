        "text": "Lesson 29: iOS 10: Frequently Asked Questions\n\n/en/iphonebasics/ios-9-frequently-asked-questions/content/\n\niOS 10: Frequently asked questions\n\nOn June 13, 2016, Apple announced iOS 10. We'd like to give you a brief overview of iOS 10 and try to answer some questions you may have at this time.\n\niOS 10 is no longer the most recent operating system, so parts of this lesson may be out of date. To learn more about the newest version, click here for more information on iOS 12.\n\nWhat is iOS 10?\n\niOS 10 is the a mobile operating system for Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nNothing. iOS 10 is free to download, like all previous versions of iOS.\n\nWhen is it available?\n\niOS 10 is available now.\n\nWho can get iOS 10?\n\nAnyone with a compatible iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch can upgrade to iOS 10. A full list of compatible devices is below.\n\nCompatible iPhone models:\n\niPhone 7\n\niPhone 7 Plus\n\niPhone 6S\n\niPhone 6S Plus\n\niPhone 6\n\niPhone 6 Plus\n\niPhone SE\n\niPhone 5S\n\niPhone 5C\n\niPhone 5\n\nCompatible iPad models:\n\niPad Pro (all versions)\n\niPad Air 2\n\niPad Air\n\niPad (4th generation)\n\niPad Mini 4\n\niPad Mini 3\n\niPad Mini 2\n\nCompatible iPod Touch models:\n\niPod Touch (6th generation)\n\nHow do I get iOS 10?\n\nIf you buy a new iOS device, iOS 10 will come pre-installed. You won't need to do anything to install it.\n\nIf you already have a compatible iOS device, you can download and install iOS 10 by going to your Settings, selecting General, and tapping Software Update.\n\nAm I required to upgrade?\n\nWhile it's not required, we recommend upgrading your device to iOS 10 if possible. This will help keep your phone up to date and working with newer apps.\n\nIf I don't upgrade, will I still be able to download newer apps?\n\nYes, but some apps may not always work correctly. If you don't upgrade to iOS 10, you may want to research how well an app will work on your device before downloading or updating it.\n\nEven if an app has always worked perfectly on your device, there is a chance that the newer versions may only run smoothly on iOS 10. You may want to avoid updating your favorite apps unless you are sure they will work with your device's operating system. Once you update an app, you won't be able to go back to an older version.\n\nWill my apps still be there after I upgrade?\n\nYes. Any app you previously had installed on your phone will still be there once you upgrade to iOS 10. Some built-in Apple apps, like Messages and Calendar, will be updated automatically when you upgrade.\n\nWill my apps still work after I upgrade?\n\nAlmost all apps installed on iOS 9 should work correctly in iOS 10. If not, the app developer will likely release an update to address the issue.\n\n/en/iphonebasics/ios-11-frequently-asked-questions/content/"
