        "text": "Available space is less and varies due to many factors. Storage capacity subject to change based on software version, settings, and iPad model. 1GB = 1 billion bytes; 1TB = 1 trillion bytes. Actual formatted capacity less.\n\nSize and weight vary by conﬁguration and manufacturing process.\n\nFaceTime calling requires a FaceTime-enabled device for the caller and recipient and a Wi-Fi connection. Availability over a cellular network depends on carrier policies; data charges may apply.\n\nData plan required. 5G, Gigabit LTE, and Wi-Fi calling are available in select markets and through select carriers. Speeds are based on theoretical throughput and vary based on site conditions and carrier. For details on 5G and LTE support, contact your carrier and see apple.com/ipad/cellular.\n\nCellular data plan is sold separately. The model you purchase is conﬁgured to work with a particular cellular network technology. Check with your carrier for compatibility and cellular data plan availability.\n\nNot all carriers support eSIM. See your carrier for details. Not available in China mainland.\n\nSiri may not be available in all languages or in all areas, and features may vary by area. Internet access required. Cellular data charges may apply.\n\nTesting conducted by Apple in February 2022 using preproduction iPad Air (5th generation) units and software. Testing consisted of full battery discharge while performing each of the following tasks: video playback and internet browsing using Wi‑Fi or cellular data network (cellular models subscribed to LTE and 5G carrier networks). Video content was a repeated 2‑hour 23‑minute movie purchased from the iTunes Store. Internet over Wi‑Fi and cellular data network tests were conducted using dedicated web servers, browsing snapshot versions of 20 popular web pages. All settings were default except: Wi‑Fi was associated with a network (except for internet browsing over cellular data network); the Wi‑Fi feature Ask to Join Networks and Auto-Brightness were turned off; Brightness was set to 50%; and WPA2 encryption was enabled. Battery life depends on device settings, usage, network, and many other factors. Battery tests are conducted using specific iPad units; actual results may vary.\n\nWireless broadband recommended; fees may apply.\n\nIn China mainland, you can use Apple Pay on the web in Safari only on compatible iPhone and iPad models using iOS 11.2 or later.\n\nData accurate as of product launch.\n\nENERGY STAR and the ENERGY STAR mark are registered trademarks owned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nApple defines its restrictions on harmful substances, including definitions for what Apple considers to be “free of,” in the Apple Regulated Substances Specification. Every Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of AC power cords in India, Thailand (for two-prong AC power cords), and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement."
