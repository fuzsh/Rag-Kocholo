It's also useful if you need to figure out whether your iPad will be supported from an upcoming iOS or iPadOS software update.\n\nLuckily, there are a few ways that you can identify your iPad model.\n\nCheck the rear of the device\n\nThe easiest way to find the model number of your iPad is to simply look at the text printed on the rear of your device. Importantly, this method works even if you can't unlock or power up your device.\n\nUnderneath \"iPad\" on the rear, you'll see the usual text stating that the iPad was designed in California and assembled in China. Right next to this, you should see text that says \"Model,\" followed by a model number starting with \"A.\"\n\nOnce you have this number, you can reference this Apple support document to figure out which specific iPad model you have or use the below table. The easiest way is to just plug in the model number in your browser's \"Find in Page\" feature.\n\niPad model and yearWi-Fi only model numberWi-Fi + Cellular model number12.9-inch iPad Pro\n\n(4th-generation, 2020)A2229A2069, A2232, A2233 (China only)11-inch iPad Pro (Second-generation, 2020)A2228A2068, A2230, A2231 (China only)12.9-inch iPad Pro (3rd generation, 2018)A1876A2014, A1895, A1983 (China only)11-inch iPad Pro (2018)A1980A2013, A1934, A1979 (China only)12.9-inch iPad Pro (2nd generation, 2017)A1670A1671, A1821 (China only)10.5-inch iPad ProA1701A1709, A1852 (China only)9.7-inch iPad Pro (2016)A1673A1674, A167512.9-inch iPad Pro (2015)A1584A1652iPad Air (4th generation, 2020)A2316A2324, A2325, A2072iPad Air (3rd generation, 2019)A2152A2123, A2153, A2154 (China only)iPad Air 2 (Late 2014)A1566A1567iPad AirA1474A1475, A1476iPad mini (5th generation, 2019)A2133A2124, A2126, A2125 (China only)iPad mini 4 (2015)A1538A1550iPad mini 3 (2014)A1599A1600iPad mini 2 (2013/2014)A1489A1490, A1491iPad mini (2012)A1432A1454, A1455iPad (8th generation, 2020)A2270A2428, A2429, A2430iPad (7th-generation, 2019)A2197A2200, A2198iPad (6th generation, 2018)A1893A1954iPad (5th generation, 2017)A1822A1823iPad (4th generation, Late 2012)A1458A1459, A1460iPad (3rd generation, early 2012)A1416A1430, A1403iPad 2 (2011)A1395A1396 (GSM), A1397 (CDMA)iPad (2010)A1219A1337\n\nIn addition to denoting the iPad's generation, the \"A\" model number can also identify whether your iPad is cellular-equipped or if it's a region-specific variant.\n\nThe model number won't give you any clues about your device's storage capacity, however. For that, and to find the second \"SKU\" model number, you'll need to open up the Settings app on your iPad.\n\nHead into Settings\n\nIf you can power up and unlock your iPad model, then you can find out a few additional details that will be useful if you're reselling your device.\n\nFirst off, open the Settings app on your device. From there, tap on General > About.\n\nIn this pane, you should see your iPad's name, your current software version, and the specific name of your iPad model. Underneath this information, you'll also see a model number.\n\nYou'll probably notice that this model number is completely different from the one on the rear of your device. That's because it's an internal SKU.\n\nIn most cases, you probably won't need this specific model number, but it gives a bit more information about your iPad. If you run a search for the SKU model number via Google, you should see results that identify the generation, model, storage capacity, and cellular configuration of your device.\n\nOn more recent versions of iOS or iPadOS, tapping on this SKU model number should also bring up the \"A\" model number that's on the rear of your device.\n\nYou'll also find your device's storage capacity in this About menu, if you need it.\n\nAdditional potentially identifying details\n\nIf, for some reason, you can't see the model number in either of the aforementioned places, then you can try identifying your iPad through its physical features.\n\nThis is not as foolproof, and you'll likely only be able to identify the general age or variant of your tablet — not its specific model or configuration.\n\nHome button: Some recent iPad models don't have Home buttons on their front faces, including the 2020 iPad Air or recent iPad Pro models. If there's a Home button, it could indicate an older iPad Pro model or a recent non-Pro iPad model.\n\nDesign & screen size: The design and screen size of your iPad could also offer some clues about its generation. Devices with slim bezels are iPad Pro or iPad Air models from 2018 or 2020, though lower-cost iPad models from those years may also sport traditional bezels. If your iPad's screen is not much larger than a big smartphone, then it's an iPad mini. Measuring your screen size on the diagonal could also help point you in the right direction.\n\nCharging port: The iPad lineup has been through three different charging ports during its span. USB-C is for the 2020 iPad Air and 2020 or 2018 iPad Pro models. Lightning is for all other recent iPads. The wider and flatter 30-pin port is only seen on older devices.\n\nSIM card slot: If your iPad has a SIM card slot, it's a Wi-Fi + Cellular model. If it doesn't, it's Wi-Fi only."
