        "text": "It’s no secret that Apple hit a home run with the creation of the iPad. The iPad is something of a cross between an iPhone and a MacBook. They provide larger screens and more power than an iPhone along with other important features.\n\nBut as good as an iPad is a “real” computer?\n\niPads as laptop replacements?\n\nThe portability and power of these tablet devices has lead many to tout them as potential laptop replacements. The iPad, they claim, can replace your friendly neighborhood laptop.\n\nEven Apple itself, for a while, proudly claimed that the iPad Pro is faster than most laptops. Whether or not that’s true — or which tasks for which that may or may not be true — is a topic for another day. But the fact that the comparison is even made is fascinating and lends credence to the possibility that an iPad is, indeed, a real computer.\n\niPads have powerful processors.\n\nBeginning with the 2021 iPad Pro lineup, the iPad line got the M1 chip — the same chip powering several 2020 MacBooks.\n\nA laptop processor in a tablet? “But why?” you might ask."
