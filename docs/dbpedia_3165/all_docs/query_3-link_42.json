Examplify works with most modern computers, both Mac and Windows operating systems. To keep Examplify current in the rapidly evolving market, when new technology is introduced, Examplify works hard to timely implement updates that accommodate changes in technologies. It is not always possible, however, to support all hardware or software, unless and until we test and certify updated technologies, including chipsets and operating systems.\n\nExamplify will not run on Chromebooks, Android, or Linux operating systems. Examplify does not support touchscreen input on Mac or Windows laptops.\n\nThe following versions of Examplify are currently supported:\n\nExamplify for Windows\n\nVersion 3.5.0\n\nVersion 3.4.6\n\nVersion 3.3.2\n\nVersion 3.6.1 (US Bar Exam only)\n\nExamplify for Mac\n\nVersion 3.5.0\n\nVersion 3.4.4\n\nVersion 3.3.2\n\nVersion 3.6.1 (US Bar Exam only)\n\nExamplify for iPad\n\nVersion 5.1\n\nWhile unsupported versions may still function, ExamSoft may not troubleshoot issues arising on unsupported versions.
