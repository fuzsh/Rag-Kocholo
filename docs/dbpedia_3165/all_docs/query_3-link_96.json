        "text": "Updated on 11/10/2023 with new model number information and iPadOS 17 compatibility.\n\nWhile most iPads can be upgraded to the latest operating system, iPadOS 17, some are stuck at an earlier generation of the operating system. Apple leaves devices behind when they don't have the hardware that's necessary to smoothly run the new operating system.\n\nConsult the chart below to find out the latest version of iOS or iPadOS that your tablet supports. To identify which iPad model you own, turn it over, and you will find it printed in very small type on the back under the iPad logo. You can also go to Settings > General > About. There you will find the \"Model Name\" and \"Model Number.\" The model number is a letter followed by four numbers. If you see a slash in a string of characters (for example, MY3K2LL/A), you're looking at the part number. Tap it to reveal the model number.\n\nHave an old iPhone?
