        "text": "The Brothers Warner apparently have not come up with the perfect romantic melodrama in \"Lightning Strikes Twice.\" But in the Palace's latest attraction they can be grateful for a professional cast, who work in some striking desert locales to provide a fair share of suspense and characterization. However, Director King Vidor, who is dealing with such fulminous elements as suspicion, crime and punishment, has not taken advantage of these potentially dramatic attributes. And, as a result, this story of a man harried by a murder he did not commit, is more often indirect and conversational than might be expected.This circuitous approach does, however, enable the director and the principals to build moods which give credence to the fear and mystery surrounding Richard Trevelyan, a prosperous Texas rancher acquitted of murdering his wife only because of the efforts of a stubborn lady juror. This is slowly but surely made plain to Shelley Carnes, a Broadway actress seeking a rest cure in the desert, who happens to stumble on Trevelyan and his circle of enemies and friends. And, it is made clearer by Liza McStringer, who turns out to be that juror, the owner of a dude ranch and a lady hopelessly in love with Trevelyan. Credit, of course, should be given to Lenore Coffee, whose script provides adult lines for them to speak. Although the surprise ending may not surprise too many viewers, it does justifiably end matters on a happy note.Richard Todd, who did nobly by his role in Warners' \"The Hasty Heart,\" is equally competent as Trevelyan, a man who would rather suffer from the wagging tongues of neighbors than speak his mind about his dead wife. Ruth Roman is properly emotional and fearful as the actress who falls for him despite her vague suspicions about his actions and past. Zachary Scott adds a few flip cracks as another of her admirers who, it turns out, dallied with Todd's dead wife, an obvious baggage. But outstanding among the principals is Mercedes McCambridge. In her unrequited love she is an extremely feminine artist, whose portrayal rises in intensity to a believable d√©nouement. \"Lightning Strikes Twice,\" in short, is not explosive fare, but it does crackle on occasion.\n\nLIGHTNING STRIKES TWICE, screen play by Lenore Coffee, from a novel by Margaret Echard; directed by King Vidor; produced by Henry Blanke for Warner Brothers.Richard Trevelyan . . . . .
