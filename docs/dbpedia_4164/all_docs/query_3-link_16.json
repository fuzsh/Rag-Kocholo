        "text": "Whenever we hear or read the term B movie, mostly negative thoughts come to our minds as this expression is often associated with cheapness. But remember that it is a designation generally used for low-budget films, productions often made quickly (due to lack of money). Sure, some B-movies are so technically awful that they even become cult films (think Ed Wood, for example). However, some of them are proof that low budget isn’t necessarily a synonym for low quality. Little gems can be made with little means.\n\nBlogger Brian from Films from Beyond has decided to celebrate the art of B-movies and Hollywood stars with his Second Annual Favourite Stars in B Movies Blogathon. It’s my first time participating in this blogathon, so I look forward to it! I’m sure I will make a lot of discoveries with the other entries!\n\nFor the occasion, I’ve decided to re-visit one of the most idealistic films noirs (in terms of understanding and applying the codes to perfection): Crossfire (Edward Dmytryk, 1947). The film stars Robert Mitchum, Robert Young, and Robert Ryan, the stars I will focus on for this article. The film also stars Gloria Grahame, who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress (she lost it to Celeste Holm for Gentleman’s Agreement).\n\n***\n\nCrossfire, like many films noir, starts with a murder. In a dark living room, a man is beaten to death by two other men whom we can’t identify. They then run away, leaving the poor victim lying on the floor, dead. He is a Jewish man named Joseph Samuels. Not long after, Captain Finlay (Robert Young) is at the apartment to start the investigation. Not long after, ex-cop Monty Montgomery (Robert Ryan) rings at the apartment, looking for Samuels. According to his story, he and Floy Bowers (Steve Brodie) met Samuel at a bar earlier. They then joined him at his apartment, where Cpl. Arthur “Mitch” Mitchell (George Cooper) was also present. When they left, Mitch was still there, and he might very well be the last person who saw Joseph Samuels alive.\n\nInevitably, Mitch becomes the prime suspect. On his side, Sergent Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum), after being informed of the situation by Finlay, decides to make his own investigation since he doesn’t believe Mitch could have done such a thing (and it is indeed difficult to believe) and also wants to clear his name. In all that chaos, the only person who could provide an alibi for Mitch is Ginny Tremaine (Gloria Grahame), who works at a dance hall and with whom Mitch might have spent the night after visiting Samuels. That won’t be as easy as it seems, and the person truly responsible is revealed to be an antisemite who committed a gruesome hate crime.\n\n***\n\nIt had been a long time since I had watched this film. Before my re-watch for the blogathon, I had only seen it twice, and the last time was quite a few years ago. Seeing it again after all this time allowed me to appreciate it in another light. Not only did I like it much more, but I would even label it as a masterpiece.\n\nThe three Roberts are nothing else than fascinating to watch. First of all, I personally love these three actors, and I think you’ll agree that Young and Ryan were pretty underrated actors of their times (especially Young). Mitchum, a little less, but I feel he didn’t quite get the recognition he deserved.\n\nIf we start with Robert Young, the first Robert introduced, I’ll start by saying that he’s the one whose performance surprised me the most. I’ve always liked Robert Young and thought he was a clever actor. However, we first think of him for his comedies or popular TV series like Father Knows Best and Marcus Welby. But he did have a pretty varied career in reality. So, when one thinks of detective in film noir, Robert Young isn’t necessarily the first actor that comes to mind. This title is often associated with people like Humphrey Bogart or Alan Ladd. Here, Young falls a bit in the same category as Dick Powell, who was better known for his Busby Berkeley musicals as the cute and fun partner of Ruby Keeler. At some point, he found himself playing in Murder, My Sweet, another film noir also directed by Dmytryk. However, while I feel that Dick was trying too hard to be taken seriously in the role of Philippe Marlow, Robert Youngas was more credible in the detective role. I was completely captivated by his performance while watching the film, and it seems the role had been custom-made for him, although he wasn’t the first choice for the role. Fun fact, Dick Powell was but had to bail out due to some schedule conflicts. With all respect for Powell, I’m glad Young got the role. There’s something very natural and very charismatic in his acting game. He’s there with his pipe and agilely imposes himself on the story and the situations. In other words, he puts a lot of credibility in his character. For those who have not seen the film yet, it’s make you look at him from a new perspective.\n\nIn his review of the film, journalist Bosley Crowther summarizes pretty well the perception we have of Young as a spectator: “Robert Young gives a fine taut performance as the patiently questioning police lieutenant, whose mind and sensibilities are revolted—and eloquently expressed—by what he finds.” I think patience is a quality that pretty much defines his character and meticulous performance. He is indeed shocked by his discovery. However, this is never done with exaggeration. His character remains a true professional. And just as Robert Young was. Indeed, according to IMDB, he was a favourite among many of his co-stars due to his reliable and professional acting, and he never tried to steal the spotlight. Maybe he should have, just a little bit!\n\nRobert Mitchum’s opinion of his role and performance was cynical. Indeed, he wasn’t enthusiastic about the part, claiming it could have been done by anybody. In a way, he was not completely wrong, but I think he was a bit hard on himself. Sergent Keeley is an in-between part that serves as a mediator and doesn’t necessarily require a particular type of acting. However, I don’t think every actor had the gift to be more natural and play regular guys. Robert Mitchum had it. Of course, we won’t remember this part as much as Reverend Harry Powell from The Night of the Hunter. I mean, we’re talking about a psychopath priest. You don’t cross paths with someone like that every day! But his performance and character in Crossfire, precisely by their nature, make a relevant contrast with Robert Young and Robert Ryan. That’s precisely why you need to see this trio of Roberts as a whole that completes each other. Ironically, Robert Mitchum probably became the biggest Hollywood star of the three Roberts, but he’s best remembered for different roles. However, Mitchum was on his path to glory, having received an Oscar nomination for The Story of G.I. Joe and about to star in Out of the Past, often considered a true blueprint of film noir.\n\nIncomprehensibly (because he certainly deserved more), Robert Ryan received his only Oscar nomination for the role of Montgomery. He lost it to Edmund Gwenn in Miracle on 34th Street. Ryan prints his performance in this film as this one is everlasting and stays engraved in our memory for a long time. You know Ryan, he had this undeniable talent for playing complex people and constantly managed to have the proper mannerism and intonation, revealing himself little by little, gradually removing his layers. I find the way he expresses the nervosity of his character particularly on point as it adds the tension necessary for the evolution of the story. His interactions with the other characters are also noteworthy as they unveil his true nature and define some aspects of his personality. Angst and nervosity are at the heart of his personality, which is expressed in key moments of the film and contrasts with the more demure nature of the two other Roberts.\n\nAlthough he delivered a noteworthy performance recognized by the Academy, Robert Ryan, the real man, preferred to distance himself from his character, whom he certainly couldn’t see as a role model, Ryan being a progressist and a pacifist. In a way, that reminds me a bit of Shelley Winter, who wasn’t too keen on her role as Rose-Ann in A Patch of Blue, being a supporter of the civil rights movement. But in a way, that’s what makes them great actors!\n\n***\n\nI had completely forgotten, but Crossfire was based on Richard Brooks’s 1946 novel The Brick Foxhole. If Brooks’s name doesn’t ring a bell (but it should), he was also a screenwriter and director and made some pretty well-remembered films. As a screenwriter, we owe him credits for films like Brute Force and Key Largo. As a director AND a writer, he made his mark with classics like Blackboard Jungle, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Elmer Gantry, The Professionals, In Cold Blood, etc. The main difference between his film and Dmytryk’s adaptation is that The Brick Foxhole revolved around homophobia, while Crossfire explored the theme of antisemitism.\n\nSince we are in the theme, let’s not forget that Crossfire was, interestingly, the first B movie nominated for the Best Picture Oscar (lost it to Elia Kazan’s Gentlemen’s Agreement, which also focuses on antisemitism). As said previously, it was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Actress. It also received a nomination for Best Director and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay (John Paxton). Sadly, it didn’t win anything. In the same line of ideas, the film made its mark at the Cannes Film Festival when it received the Prix du Meilleur Film Social (Award for Best Social Film).\n\nToday, Crossfire has its little group of fans, but I don’t feel it gets the recognition it deserves. Honestly, it’s a film worth seeing for its message, lesson in acting, and to see some different kind of noir, something precisely more social. If it doesn’t leave an impression on you the first time, I’m sure it will grow on you as it did for me.\n\nIt was a pleasure to contribute to Brian’s blogathon!
