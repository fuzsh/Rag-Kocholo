        "text": "Arthur Roberts was a black Scottish soldier who survived the first world war and ended his days in an old people’s home in Glasgow. His name would have been lost to us were it not for a remarkable sequence of events. In the autumn of 2004 a young couple found his diaries, letters and photographs in a house they had bought in the city a few years earlier. The diaries were written over the course of a single year: 1917. In his diary, he detailed his experiences of war and loss, of heavy shelling, blood-covered rations, of comrades he witnessed dying. Arthur, who had died in 1982, was miraculously returned, his voice brought back to life.\n\nThere were no black troops included in the Peace March of July 1919, a victory parade held in London to mark the end of the war. Allison O’Neill, one of the care workers in the home where Arthur spent the last of his days, said that he had felt forgotten on Remembrance Sundays. He would go and sit in his room and not watch the ceremonies on television. Perhaps he had tired of the “glory of war” and the “old lies”, and perhaps the wound cut deeper. It is one thing to make sacrifices; it is quite another thing to become the victim of a kind of national amnesia. Reading Arthur’s diaries and looking at his photographs, I felt compelled to save his face, commit him to memory.\n\nWhen Arthur came back from the war, he returned to his job at Harland and Wolff shipyard to work on the vessels that made the Clyde famous. In 1919, there were race riots in port cities across the country, including Glasgow. Arthur would have come home from a place where he was fighting alongside men to a place where the same men were effectively turning on him. The Aliens Restriction Act 1914, extended in 1919, effectively made Arthur a foreigner in his own country. In the shipyards, he was called a “black bastard” a few times.\n\nI got a very real sense of Arthur from reading his diaries – of his kindness, his empathy, his spirit, his pride, the ways he dealt with the horrors he had witnessed. At one point he writes: “The dead were so numerous it was impossible to proceed without walking on them.” When we put on our red poppies this year, we should be remembering, too, the soldiers like Arthur, who knew every type of loss yet whose dark faces were missing from the victory parades, whose stories have been lost.\n\nJackie Kay’s documentary A Scottish Soldier is on BBC Four on Monday at 10pm.\n\nThe Looks of Loss\n\nHe lost the party, or the party lost him;\n\nAnd the list of losses came almost nightly.\n\nHow already he’d lost his smile, his grace.\n\nHow at night, or under the morning mist, he lost face.\n\nHow for miles he plodded making his list of losses.\n\nHe knew the faces of loss as intimately as his own.\n\nHe knew loss’s husky voice, its strange frown.\n\nHe knew the way its hair fell out; the way loss fell down.\n\nHe knew loss. He’d been in loss’s town.\n\nAnd the next thing he was half lying against a wagon in the rain\n\nAnd who knew where he came from, or to where he would go?\n\nAfter the third Battle of Ypres, they were soon dispersed\n\nAnd he kept that loss close lest he should ever forget.\n\nHe knew the colour of loss, its park benches\n\nHe knew the smell of loss took him to the trenches.\n\nHe knew the glaikit gazes, the lost sons’ faces\n\nHe knew loss was not choosy: it could pick out any one.\n\nHe knew it carried no watch; grief keeps a different clock,\n\nThat to loss the morning or evening were all the same\n\nthat he could find loss stock-still, lame.\n\nOr that it could run behind in the rain.\n\nHe knew it could jog ahead in real time.\n\nHe knew loss’s game, its hiding places.\n\nHe knew he wasn’t the only one counting down.\n\nHe knew loss. He’d been in loss’s town.\n\nHe’d watched lost ships sail down the Clyde\n\nAnd listened to the noises from childhood loss\n\nThe bells and the jingles and midnight owls.\n\nAnd for years after the war, it seemed that all the losses\n\nFollowed him in their old dead boots\n\nAnd the losses still to come walked ahead in their old dead boots\n\nAnd everywhere around him was the thud of loss,\n\nHeavy-footed with trench feet, thickly coated in mud.\n\nSeeking the drowsy, the exhausted, the run-down.\n\nHe knew loss. He’d been in loss’s town."
