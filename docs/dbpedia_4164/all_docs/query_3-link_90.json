        "text": "The following is the opinion and analysis of the writer:\n\nAt an increasing rate, the United States is becoming less white, less religious, and less male-dominated. This trend does not portend well for a minority of misguided Americans who feel our nation should be controlled by only white Christian males. The desire for theocratic rule of American society is not new. It spans the years since our nation’s founding. It motivated earlier White Christian Nationalists (WCNs) to:\n\nterrorize Native Americans and later, immigrants.\n\nenslave, murder, and subjugate “Negroes.”\n\nmaintain women as secondary and powerless citizens.\n\nuse prejudice and violence against non-Christian citizens.\n\nNice legacy!\n\nWhile the current crop of WCNs know they can’t stop the inevitable cultural, demographic, religious, and political shifts in our country, they have strategized how to “have dominion” over our society and government.\n\nThe Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty listed their tenets as follows:\n\nAmerica is a divinely appointed nation by God that is Christian.\n\nAmerica’s founders, rather than wanting to disestablish religion as a unifier for the nation, were in fact establishing a nation based on Christian principles, with white men as the leaders.\n\nOthers (Native Americans, enslaved Africans, and immigrants) would accept and cede to this narrative of America as a Christian nation and accept their leadership.\n\nAmerica has a special place not only in world history, but in biblical Scripture, especially concerning the return of Christ.\n\nThere is no separation between church and state.\n\nReality check: Nothing in the Bible references America. To claim otherwise is religious “overenthusiasm.” Our Constitution and government are secular — by design. Any mention of “God” on currency, in our Pledge, on court houses, etc. is ceremonial. And yes, it’s troubling that recent judicial decisions have cited Christian dogma as justifying some rulings.\n\nSome background: The 1960s help us better understand why today’s WCNs consider themselves as the instruments of God who are assigned to replace our democracy with a theocratic autocracy. During this decade, civil and voting rights were given to Blacks; feminism began; no-fault divorce became an option; and the LGBTQ+ movement started. In 1964, Senator Barry Goldwater, who sought the Republican nomination for President against Lyndon Johnson, justified radical measures when deeply held conservative values were at stake. He famously stated in his acceptance speech, ““Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue!”\n\nThe 1980s saw President Ronald Reagan fuse evangelism, patriotism, and American exceptionalism to the Republican Party. He appeared to embrace Christianity as America’s de facto national religion. It was during his watch that Goldwater’s directive drove Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority and Pat Robertson’s Christian Coalition to became one with the Republican Party. Those types of fundamentalist, evangelical, WCN associations have swelled and solidified. It now seems that one is either a Democrat, an Independent or a Christian.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nRecent reputable surveys find “that 10% of Americans are avowed Christian nationalists ... while an additional 19% are sympathetic to Christian nationalist ideals.” Yes, a minority of zealots wants to control the majority of Americans. What chutzpah!\n\nAnd Project 2025 is their perverse WCN-inspired compendium detailing their “battle plans” for accomplishing that goal. And violently if necessary. Indeed, WCN Kevin Roberts (President of the conservative Heritage Foundation), said that the country is in the midst of a “second American Revolution” that will be bloodless “if the left allows it to be.” Read: “We will assault you if necessary!”\n\nMake no mistake. WCN and Project 2025 are both simply political power grabs in the name of religion.\n\nThey claim our country is “out of order.” For them, it’s not right that:\n\nA black man and his family lived in the “White” house.\n\nLbgtq\n\n+ people have been recognized as normal human beings and received rights given to all other U.S. citizens.\n\nWomen have control over their bodies.\n\nTheir religion is irrelevant in public schools.\n\nPeople are concerned with climate change (because their deity promised to handle that issue).\n\nNon-whites, non-Christians, and women are influencing public policies.\n\nAnd I could go on…\n\nI suggest confronting these fanatics and their sympathizers in the following way:\n\nDon’t initially challenge or rebut them with facts, data, and evidence. As has been said “You cannot reason someone out of something he or she was not reasoned into.”\n\nRather, begin by letting them vent their positive feelings towards WCN and the purported benefits of a Christian based government. Then ask them, in a thought experiment, to picture addressing an audience of millions of non-Christian Americans: How would they persuade this mixed gathering to accept living under Christian dogma? What arguments would they use? And how do they think that presentation would work out?\n\nPerhaps then, after they realize the idiocy, thoughtlessness, selfishness, and madness of their position, you can then share your feelings (and facts, if you must) about how and why a secular Constitution and government are the best frameworks for pluralistic societies. Good luck!\n\nGil Shapiro lives in Oro Valley. He was the spokesperson for Freethought Arizona from 2005 to 2016.
