        "text": "R.A. Roberts (born Richard Arthur Roberts, 1870) was an actor, impressionist, and, above all, quick-change artist — billed as the “World’s Greatest” in that line. A Liverpool native, he first achieved success in the music halls of that city before taking his act to London in the 1890s. 1903-1905 he enjoyed great success with a playlet called “Dick Turpin” (based on the life of a famous 19th century highwayman), in which he played five different characters, including two women.\n\nThe act was such a smash, he undertook a well-publicized tour of big time American vaudeville.\n\nWhile well regarded for his thespian abilities (especially his interpretations of Dickens’ characters), his act was highly physical, In a 1910 Variety interview with Sime he spoke of the many injuries he had sustained in smashing into rubberneckers who’d snuck backstage to see how he achieved his effects (hence his later policy of permitting no one backstage). Over the years, Roberts kept increasing the number of characters he portrayed in his act, from 5 to 6 to 8 to 19. Later turns bore titles like “Ringing in the Changes”, “A Comedy of Deception”, and “Lucinda’s Elopement”. The last credit I can find for him is at the Bristol (England) U.K. in 1919. Any info about his later life (and the year of his passing) would be most appreciated!"
