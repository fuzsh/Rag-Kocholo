        "text": "It's a very curious film noir with this fish out of water on vacation no less in a dry locale of a dude ranch and is played by Ruth Roman(Shelley Carnes) who randomly gets sucked into these locals lives full of money, land and lust and succumbs to be involved. It is a rather dizzying at times to the connections but I guess that's the charm of piecing the puzzle elements together. Almost has early horror elements to it hence the goth noir label cause when confronted people just shutdown on info to a ridiculous level but you know that they are building to a head and walls will shake when things come to the surface. Personally I enjoyed all…\n\n\"It frightened me at first, but I'm beginning to think that the desert and I are good friends.\"\n\nEvery so often Eddie Muller makes a particularly goofy choice for Saturday night's Noir Alley, and Lightning Strikes Twice has to be at the very bottom of that scraped barrel. Ruth Roman was an actress of limited ability even in the best circumstances (of which there were not many), so I don't think it's an understatement to say that she sinks this not-very-noirish melodrama harder than the Andrea Doria, which of course she'd know all about since she was one of the rescued passengers.\n\nThis is the totally bananas story of a New York theater performer (Roman) ordered by a doctor to…\n\nFor director King Vidor, Lightning Strikes Twice was his failed attempt at a film noir. For modern audiences, however, it's less that then it is a campy melodrama that's at its best when it's most unhinged.\n\nThe movie starts out with Richard Trevelyan (Richard Todd, whose jarring, Irish accent is explained away by, you know, boarding school!) miraculously not only escaping execution for killing his wife, but also being freed after a retrial ends in a hung jury (thanks, we later find out, to the presence of a devoted friend on the jury -- just go with it, ok). Complications arise when vacationing stage actress Shelley (the gorgeous Ruth Roman, who swings wildly between very good and not good at…\n\n\"I could have predicted the end of it but nobody asked me\"\n\nShelley Carnes (Ruth Roman), a stage actress ordered by her doctor to take some time in a warm dry climate, arrives on a ranch in Texas where she falls for Richard (Richard Todd), a man recently acquitted for the murder of his wife. Circumstances begin to erode her faith in Richard's innocence, and she soon finds herself snared in a web of doubt that not only undermines their burgeoning relationship but could also put her in personal danger.\n\nThe first act, where things are uncertain and Shelley is finding her footing in new surroundings is the most interesting. There are some nice shots of a raging storm at…\n\n“You’re fascinated by the smell of murder.”\n\nIf Ruth Roman is “all woman” as the tagline reads, then based on her character’s idiotic decision making in King Vidor’s Texas-set true crime noir, Lightning Strikes Twice, “all women” should not be allowed to operate heavy machinery.\n\nA real “red flag” film, and Ruth Roman’s Shelley Carnes ignores every one of them. She is a Desdemona actress (“I was tired of being murdered every night”) from the east coast sent west to convalesce. Instead of a single moment of rest, she ends up white-knuckling a rain storm, sleeping in an abandoned ranch house with a strange man, and meddling in a closed murder case involving the creepily handsome Richard Trevelyan (Richard Todd).…\n\nHello Letterboxd people. Chad here. Been taking it easy as far as doing reviews. Trying to move into a apartment building with civilized residents, and not residents that are a continuous cycle of crack heads. Bad knees during the winter sap the energy out of me too. But that's enough of the personal stuff.\n\nI'm still here, and it's time to visit noir alley.\n\nLIGHTNING STRIKES TWICE\n\nThis story begins with a priest that feels guilty about telling the truth. His testimony are the last few nails in his friend's coffin. You see Richard Trevelyan ( Richard Todd ) is convicted of killing his wife Loraine. Feeling that the end is coming soon, the priest asks for Richard's forgiveness. Richard…"
