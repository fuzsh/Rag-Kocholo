        "text": "Mr. Roberts was born in Whitman County, Washington in 1895. He graduated from the University of Washington College of Forestry in 1921, and worked for the Long-Bell Lumber Co., 1921-1922. In 1922-1927 he worked for the West Coast Lumbermen's Association, Seattle, and continued working in lumber promotion and advertizing for most of his career. Roberts also served as first secretary of the forest industry's Forest Conservation Committee, 1934-1935. He pioneered conservation education workshops on and off campus in Oregon and Washington, as well as edited movies, filmstrips, colored slide sets and booklets for regional and national distribution. Even after his retirement he participated workshops for teachers in Oregon and Washington on forestry."
