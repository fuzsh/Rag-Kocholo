        "text": "The 50th annual Mount Gretna Art Show is returning this summer with an exciting new feature: an inaugural film festival at Mount Gretna Playhouse.\n\nThe film festival on Sunday, Aug. 18, is open to filmmakers of all ages and includes a screening of selected films, followed by an awards ceremony. The goal of the festival is to showcase emerging and established filmmakers and promote their work as an all-encompassing art form.\n\nThe film festival coincides with Mount Gretna’s most celebrated event, the nationally ranked Outdoor Art Show. Lebanon County has declared 2024 as the “Year of the Arts” for the 50th annual show.\n\nThe awards for the film festival are possible through generous gifts made in memory of Mount Gretna artist Michael Evan Deitzler, who had a dream of starting a regional film festival in his hometown. The film festival this year is being held in his honor.\n\nDeitzler, according to a press release, “lived fully and passionately, loving family, friends, film and all things Mount Gretna – which has raised artists, like Evan, for generations.”\n\nThe film festival accepts only short (5 minutes or less in total run time) films for consideration. Entering filmmakers must be 14 years of age or above.\n\nCash prizes of up to $1,000 will be awarded for Best Drama, Best Comedy, Best Horror, Best Documentary/Video Essay, Best High School Entry, Hometown Spotlight (for Lebanon County filmmakers), and Best of Festival (the “Vita Maxima” award, “The Greatest Life” in honor of Michael Evan Deitzler). Craft awards will also be announced for Best Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Best Editing, Best Sound Design, Best Acting, and Audience Choice.\n\nDetails and entry information can be found at mtgretnaarts.com.\n\nThe 50th annual Mount Gretna Art Show runs from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 17-18. Admission is $15; children under the age of 12 are free. Discounted advance tickets are available through the show’s website until Friday, Aug. 16. Also available for purchase are limited edition 50th anniversary commemorative banners.\n\nTo celebrate this year’s milestone festival, a pre-show Chautauqua Summer Program will be held on the origins of the Art Show at 7 p.m. on Aug. 14. State Sen. Chris Gebhard will honor the show at the beginning of the program, and show founder Bruce Johnson and others who were instrumental to the inception of Lebanon County’s biggest annual art show will speak about its early days.\n\nThe art show features 200 exhibitors, as well as an “Emerging Artists” section. Parking will be at Soldiers Field on Timber Road (the fields near the lake), and shuttle service will be available from dedicated parking compliments of WellSpan Philhaven hospital.\n\nThe Kids Art Show, created with family in mind, is scheduled for both days from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Chautauqua Playground. Children will be invited to participate in make-and-take art activities, spin art, and more.\n\nEntertainment Schedule:\n\nAug. 17, 11 a.m.-1 p.m. – The Flatpick Earth Society (bluegrass trio)\n\nAug. 17, 1:30-3:30 p.m. – Andy Roberts Project (four-piece jazz and original band)\n\nAug. 17, starting at 4 p.m. – No Last Call (strolling music)\n\nAug. 18, 11 a.m.-1 p.m. – Tom Hillicker Quartet (jazz)\n\nAug. 18, 1:30-3:30 p.m. – Dirty 1/2 Dozen Jazz-Grass Ensemble (six-piece jazz/bluegrass band)\n\nA food court featuring local restaurants and craft beer and wine from Snitz Creek Brewery will be available during the show.\n\nRoute 117 will be closed during show hours. No pets are allowed on the festival grounds.\n\nMore details on visiting Mount Gretna and at art and film festival can be found online.\n\nRelated"
