According to an Aug FD news item, scenes for the production were to be shot in Santa Cruz, CA. The MPH reviewer complimented Carl Dreher, RKO sound department chief, for his contribution to this film. The exact nature of Dreher's work on this particular production is not known, however. RKO borrowed Frank Albertson from Fox and Bette Davis from Universal. According to modern sources, Davis was paid $300 per week for three weeks of shooting on the picture.\n\nLess\n\nIn the village of Jonesport, Maine, farmers Seth and Mother Parker care for their foster son Robbie, while farm hand David Clark, the son of \"Runaway\" Rose, secretly courts his employer's daughter, Mary Lucy Duffy.

When Seth discovers Turner's deed, he takes off in his buggy and, with help from the family Bible, catches and knocks out Turner as he is about to flee with Robbie on a train. Because Seth never had legally adopted Robbie, the boy is placed in a Bangor orphanage, pending a legal decision. While waiting for the court's verdict, Seth lectures the townspeople on the subject of tolerance and encourages them to accept Rose and her newly married son into their hearts. Moved by Seth's words, the townspeople embrace the newlyweds and Rose, just as Robbie returns from Bangor as Seth's legal heir.\n\nLess"
