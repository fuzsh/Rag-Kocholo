        "text": "AN ENGLISH CUBIST\n\nWILLIAM ROBERTS:\n\nCatalogue raisonné \n\nchronologicalresearched and compiled by\n\nDavid Cleall\n\nedited and with\n\nadditional research by\n\nBob DavenportLast revised 17 July 2024\n\nThis version of the catalogue is arranged chronologically. Within each year, works are listed alphabetically, with portraits being listed under the surname of the sitter, so that Ernest Cooper, Esq. appears under C. For a version of the catalogue arranged alphabetically throughout, click here.\n\nThis list demonstrates the scope, scale and themes of William Robertss work. It does not attempt to be a definite list of all of his paintings and drawings, but it is hoped it will encourage owners, enthusiasts and researchers to come forward with further information.\n\nSince the majority of William Robertss work is not dated, much of the exact chronology is speculative. The main sources of information that have been used are exhibition catalogues, sales catalogues and other publications. The details these provide are often vague, however, with some apparently dated works having been post-dated. When no date is available, I have usually assumed that a painting or drawing has been completed within a short time of its first exhibition. Where I have been able to refer to an image, stylistic development of Robertss work gives a clue as to the date of the work, and biographic information on the sitter, purchaser or patron is also helpful.\n\nTitles of works are a further problem. Drawings and watercolours used as studies for an oil painting are often given different titles from the oil painting. Works are often exhibited under more than one title, and on many occasions the same subject is revisited at a later date. Works with similar subject matter seem sometimes to have been confused in exhibitions after Robertss death. Also some of the works from the estate of John David Roberts which were accepted by HM Government in lieu of inheritance tax and allocated to Tate in 2007 appear on the Tate website with baldly descriptive titles taken from the police inventory of the works in the Roberts family home after the death of John David Roberts, rather than the titles under which they had previously been exhibited. I have tended to favour the last title used during Robertss lifetime.\n\nMeasurements are given height before width, in centimetres. Full details of exhibitions mentioned appear on a separate page. Full details of publications listed in short-title form can be found in the bibliography.\n\nAuction prices given are generally as quoted by the auction house concerned, and may not include all fees and taxes, such as VAT and Artists Resale Right charges.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1960 Roberts taught a life class at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. During that time he made many life drawings, some of which he kept and some of which were kept by his students (the latter group including drawings made on the edge of students own work). Being undated (and unsigned), these drawings are difficult to integrate into the chronology of the catalogue and so are listed at the end.\n\nIt would be very helpful if readers would notify me of any inaccuracies that they are aware of.\n\nDavid Cleall\n\nThe information in this catalogue and on the pages linked to it is provided in good faith, but the compiler and editor accept no responsibility for the consequences of any error, and cannot guarantee the authenticity of any work listed.\n\n*\n\nEarly in life Roberts discovered the narrow range of subjects he wished to represent.\n\nJohn Rothenstein, Modern English Painters, Vol. 2: Lewis to Moore\n\n*\n\nIf subjects taken from War, Rural Life, Modern Town Life, Greek Mythology, Christian Mythology can be called narrow, I would be interested to know Rothensteins definition of a wide range.\n\nWilliam Roberts, A Reply to My Biographer Sir John Rothenstein\n\n*\n\nAbove: William Robertss cover design for the catalogue of his 1965 retrospective exhibition\n\n1908\n\nBacchanal, c.1908 (signed and inscribed).

Red chalk, 55 x 37.9. Cyril Kendall Butler (18641936; he was not in fact knighted until 1920) was a commissioner in the Ministry of Food and a founder, treasurer and chairman of the Contemporary Art Society. In his posthumously published Early Years, Roberts wrote, In the summer vacations of the following year [1912], I received another invitation to spend a few weeks in the country; this time from Sir Cyril Butler  a friend of Prof. Tonks [of the Slade School, where Roberts was studying] and a patron of the group of artists, members of the New English Art Club. Bourton House, where Butler lived, was a large country mansion near Shrivenham in Berkshire, set in extensive parkland Following on my stay at Bourton, Sir Cyril commissioned me to do six drawings of London markets at two guineas each. But except for two markets, Billingsgate and Leadenhall, the drawings were never carried out. Several years after this, about 1919, I was living in an attic at 32 Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road, and being very hard up I wrote to Sir Cyril, hoping he might feel interested in buying a drawing or perhaps complete that set of London markets. He did not reply; instead, he called one evening; the visit was brief. After asking me what artists I associated with, and who my friends were, without mentioning the market drawings he departed, leaving me no better off than before. PROVENANCE: With the Mayor Gallery, 1969, from whom acquired by the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, with the University Purchase Fund, 1969. William Roberts wrote to the Fitzwilliam Museum in July 1969 confirming the attribution and describing the circumstances of the sitting (was done about 1911 or 1912 during my student days at the Slade). EXHIBITION HISTORY: Cambridge 1985\n\n1912\n\nCarpenters, The  study for mural (see Carpenters at Work 1912), 1912 (signed and dated). Pencil, 48 x 27. PROVENANCE: Dunedin Public Art Gallery (bequeathed by Dr Charles Brasch, 1973). EXHIBITION HISTORY: Leicester Galleries 1956, Leicester Galleries (2) 1957\n\nCarpenters at Work (aka The Carpenters Shop)  study for wall mural at Bishop Creighton House, London, 1912. Pencil and ink on buff paper, 34.1 x 19 (also described as 49.5 x 34.3  Cork, Art Beyond the Gallery in Early 20th Century England). [Slade professor Henry] Tonks was anxious to encourage our interest in mural painting, and to this end had obtained permission to decorate the walls of a girls club in Lillie Road, Fulham. About half a dozen students took part in the scheme. The compositions were done in egg tempera, on paper stretched on the walls. My contribution was a panel showing carpenters at work (Roberts, Early Years, p. 14). The murals were already in need of some restoration in 1923, and when they were further damaged during the Blitz in 1940 it was decided to paint over them (John Sheppard, Bishop Creighton House 19082008: One Hundred Years of Work in the Community (London: Bishop Creighton House / Fulham and Hammersmith Historical Society, 2008), p. 36). PROVENANCE: Anthony dOffay Gallery (1980) > Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester (Victoria & Albert Museum Purchase Grant). EXHIBITION HISTORY: Liverpool 1914 (as The Carpenters Shop), Anthony dOffay Gallery (1) 1980. REPRODUCED: Cork, Art Beyond the Gallery in Early 20th Century England\n\nDavid Choosing the Three Days Pestilence, 1912. Pencil and ink on paper, 47.8 x 41.8. And David said unto the Lord, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O Lord, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly. For when David was up in the morning, the word of the Lord came unto the prophet Gad, Davids seer, saying, Go and say unto David, Thus saith the Lord, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee. So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me. And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the Lord; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man. So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men (2 Samuel 24:1015). PROVENANCE: Professor Henry Tonks (1927) > ? > Tate Gallery (T06668, presented by Patricia Butchard, Valerie Bevis and Suzanne Tupper 1992). EXHIBITION HISTORY: University College 1927, Hayward Gallery 1974, Newcastle 2004, Tate Britain 2012. REPRODUCED: Cork, Bomberg\n\nDecapitations (aka Religious Subject), c.1912? Pen, ink and watercolour, ruled diagonally for transfer, the outlines pricked and incised, 61 x 61. On the left, three bearded figures in ankle-length tunics each hold up a severed bearded head. In the centre, a boy with a short sword in one hand gestures towards them with his other hand. An elderly bearded man bends down to him and also gestures towards the other three, apparently in anger; behind him a woman holds a baby, and to the right a figure with a sword in his right hand has his left hand in front of his lowered face. This may be the design that Roberts submitted under the title The Legend of Cuchulain (q.v.) for the competition held in connection with the Exhibition of Designs for Mural Painting and for the Decoration of Schools and Other Buildings held at Crosby Hall, Chelsea, in 1912; although if this is the case it seems to be a very free mixture of elements of the Cuchulain legend. PROVENANCE: Sir Cyril Butler > ? > Redfern Gallery > Sir Ralph Richardson > Sothebys 15 May 1985 (as Mythical Subject, £10,000) > ? > Lord and Lady Irvine of Lairg. EXHIBITION HISTORY: Crosby Hall 1912 (as The Legend of Cuchulain)?, New English Art Club (1) 1925 (as Decapitations), Australia and New Zealand 1954 (as Religious Subject), Barbican Art Gallery 1989 (as Unidentified Subject), The Fleming Collection 2009 (as Mythical Subject)\n\nLegend of Cuchulain, The  design for a wall painting, 1912. In 1912 an Exhibition of Designs for Mural Painting and for the Decoration of Schools and Other Buildings was held at Crosby Hall, Chelsea, in connection with which a competition was held for mural designs for specific locations, one of which was the proposed Gallery of Modern Art in Dublin. The warrior hero and demigod Cuchulain from Irish mythology may have been a suggested subject for this  other entries included The Meeting of Cuchulain and Emer by Colin Rae and Cuchulain at Rosnaill by Alfred Cooper  although the winning design for Dublin, by Frederick Cayley Robinson, showed The Coming of St Patrick to Ireland, A.D. 430. Roberts's entry, The Legend of Cuchulain, may have been the drawing later exhibited as Decapitations (q.v.), which has the same square format as the Rae, Cooper and Robinson designs and the same dimensions as the last of these. (The dimensions of the other two are not known.) But if this is the case it seems to have involved a very free mixture of elements of the Cuchulain legend. EXHIBITION HISTORY: Crosby Hall 1912\n\nPortrait of Slade Model (I assume this is Portrait of an Old Man), date unknown  suggest 1912. Oil on canvas, 46 x 35.5. Signed and inscribed A slade model who sat as a young man for Millais Speak! Speak! on the reverse. (The subject was an old grey-haired Italian model, who as a young man had posed for Millais painting, entitled Speak, Speak! [1895]. He was very proud of this, and would tell the students Me, Speak, Speak  Roberts, Early Years, p. 12.)

Pencil, 30 x 25. PROVENANCE: Private collection, London\n\nResurrection, The (Slade School Sketch Club subject), 1912 (dated). Pencil, pen and ink, 30.5 x 30.5. Richard Cork has pointed out a similarity between this composition and Michelangelos The Resurrection in the Royal Library at Windsor, but notes that by 1912 the seeds of abstraction had already been planted in [Robertss] work. A lingering debt to the Pre-Raphaelites is evident in the drooping Burne-Jones figure kneeling on the left But Roberts possessed an equally apparent urge to simplify his figures into massive, schematic units Christs figure has become a series of right-angles, shooting up out of the coffin until his outstretched arms cut through the geometric arc of the rainbow. And the coffin lid, flying back through the air away from the impact of this supernatural explosion, carries the abstract force of the vocabulary Roberts was to employ in his Vorticist work (Richard Cork, David Bomberg (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1987), p. 64). Although Cork identifies the resurrected figure with Christ, the central cross in the background seems to have someone hanging on the far side of it, and possibly someone kneeling at its foot. The picture may therefore refer to Matthew 27: 4552: Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose. PROVENANCE: St John Hutchinson > Leicester Galleries > Wilfrid Evill (Dec. 1945, 15 gns) > Miss Honor Frost (1963) > private collection, London (2011).

In Homers Odyssey, after a difficult ten-year journey back from the Trojan War the Greek hero Odysseus (or Ulysses in the Latin form) eventually arrives disguised as a beggar at his home of Ithica, where his faithful wife, Penelope, is besieged by unruly suitors, with strangers grossly maltreated, and men dragging the women servants about the house in an unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly, and bread wasted all to no purpose (Book 16, ll. 10811, tr. Samuel Butler, 1900). He reveals himself to his son, Telemachus (or Telemakhos), and together they plot the destruction of the suitors at a banquet in the palace. [The suitors] went inside and laid their cloaks on the benches and seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the heifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them round Telemakhos deliberately made Odysseus sit in the part of the room that was paved with stone; he gave him a shabby-looking seat at a little table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought to him, with his wine in a gold cup (ibid., Book 20, ll. 24861). Odysseus alone succeeds in the feat of archery that Penelope sets to determine whom she will give in to, and then (with the help of his son and two faithful servants) slays the suitors and reveals himself to his wife.

REPRODUCED: Williams, William Roberts, p. 21\n\nDancers, The  study, 191314. Tempera on board, 51.4 x 51.4, according to the Quinn sale catalogue  but the reproduction in New Age (see below) is not square. This drawing was published in the New Age in 1914 with an analysis by T. E. Hulme: This drawing contains four figures. I could point out the position of these figures in more detail, but I think such detailed indication misleading. No artist can create abstract form spontaneously; it is always generated, or, at least, suggested, by the consideration of some outside concrete shapes. But such shapes are only interesting if you want to explain the psychology of the process of composition in the artists mind. The interest of the drawing itself depends on the forms it contains. The fact that such forms were suggested by human figures is of no importance. Roberts challenges this final sentence in his introduction to Some Early Abstract and Cubist Work (1957), where he states, In an abstract design the concrete forms upon which it is based have greater importance than Hulme allows for  This drawing was probably exhibited at the Vorticist exhibition at the Doré Gallery in 1915 as Drawing. It was one of four works selected by Ezra Pound in London for John Quinn, the American art collector, and transported to New York in 1916 and exhibited in the Vorticist exhibition at the Penguin Club in New York in 1917. It was purchased by John Quinn for £6 at the time of the exhibition, and became part of his collection. John Quinn died in 1924, and his collection was sold in 1927 (Vivien Greene, Ezra Pound and John Quinn: The Penguin Club Exhibition 1917, in The Vorticists (London: Tate, 2011)).

Pencil, pen and ink, and collage, 60.5 x 53.5. The collage element of this work consists of a printed notice reading KID LEWIS v. JIM BERRY AT THE PREMIERLAND. In Some Early Abstract and Cubist Work (1957), Roberts wrote, I became an abstract painter through the influence of the French Cubists An additional stimulant to my interest in abstract art was the example of David Bomberg a friend and fellow pupil at the Slade School who had begun to produce some fine cubist compositions. Kid Lewis (n Gershon Mendeloff, aka the Aldgate Sphinx) was the British and European featherweight champion in March 1914 and was known to Bomberg through Bombergs brother Mo, himself a boxer. Roberts was particularly close friends with Bomberg  a fellow East Ender  in 1914, and the fight between Lewis and Berry, taking place in the Whitechapel venue Premierland, would have been a big attraction for both artists. However, in BLAST SPORT?: Vorticism, Sport, and William Robertss Boxers, Bernard Vere notes that he has been unable to find any mention of a fight between Lewis and Jim Berry in the boxing records, although these records are known to be incomplete.

EXHIBITION HISTORY: New English Art Club 1914 (The Futurist composition of Mr. Roberts is not meant to be humanly possible, but it is meant to arouse our human interest. It contains some eight or ten very scrappy, angular gesticulatory figures, all quite impossible in their anatomy  and for this reason, that all these figures represent the movements of a single pair of fighters. The artists has set out to represent the emotion or sensation of combative movement. Had he tried to do so by flinging together upon the canvas eight or ten well-articulated human forms he would only have given us a crowd of that number of combatants That was not his aim. His aim was, I take it, to give us visually the emotion and excitement produced by a single pair of boxers. To some extent he has done so. Anyway, that is the reason why he has drawn these figures as he has drawn them, and, whether we like the attempt or not, we get on these lines some understanding of his work and so some understanding of the work of other Futurists  Laurence Housman, The New English Art Club, Manchester Guardian, 23 May 1914), London Group 1915.

Alexander Stewart Gray (18621937), whom his London Times obituary described as the original hunger march leader in this country, was a Scottish solicitor who in 1908 led a march of unemployed men from the north of England and later fasted near Windsor Castle to draw attention to their plight. In 1914 he rented 8 Ormonde Terrace, by Primrose Hill and Regents Park, where he accommodated young painters and sculptors, including WR. In his Let There Be Sculpture (1940), Jacob Epstein described how there was a life class at which I sometimes drew, and sometimes the artists, among others Roberts and Bomberg, a mysterious Indian artist, and some models, would have parties (ch. 11).

The commanders of the 51st Brigade batteries arranged among themselves to try and salvage these guns. D.

On the night fixed for the undertaking, our salvage party having been given a double tot of rum, then set off with two six-horse teams, to do the job. The horses were left behind our own line while we crept out. Fortunately there was no barbed wire to tangle with and we endeavoured to free the gun wheels embedded in the hard earth.

The infantry also had their telephone cables. These thin insulated cables of different colours, with their identity tags, crisscrossed the ground in all directions. They were continually getting broken or cut by shell bursts. When this happened, the line was said to be diss, and this meant signallers turning out. Putting the broken ends together again was hard enough in daylight, especially with Jerrys shells dropping around.

Janko Lavrin (18871986) was born in Krupa in Slovenia. After studying in Prague and Susak (present-day Rijeka), on graduation he went to St Petersburg, where he studied archaeology and Slavic linguistics, before becoming a journalist, reporting from the Balkans during the First World War. When the Russian Revolution broke out he moved to London, where in the early 1920s he knew William Roberts in Fitrovia. From 1923 until his retirement in 1953 he was professor of modern Russian literature at the University of Nottingham, and he was also involved in organizing Slavic studies at universities in Glasgow, London and elsewhere. He published many books, mainly on Russian literature, and was married to the artist and engraver Nora Lavrin (née Fry).

In March 1919 Sacheverell Sitwell visited Modiglianis studio in Paris and decided to put on an exhibition of French art in London (Sarah Bradford, Sacheverell Sitwell: Splendours and Miseries (London: Sinclair-Stevenson, 1993), pp. 916). Leopold Zborowski, art dealer and friend of Modigliani, was to act as agent. The exhibition was held at the Mansard Gallery in Heals in AugustSeptember 1919, and included work by Picasso, Modigliani, Leger, Derain and Dufy. In his preface to the catalogue, Arnold Bennett described the exhibition as the first of its kind since the war, and the best of its kind since the celebrated exhibition at the Grafton Galleries many years ago [191011]. William Robertss poster design is a vertical composition against a yellow background. A group of stylised figures, viewed from a high perspective, are in an art-gallery context. It is similar in style to the three panels painted for the Hôtel de la Tour Eiffel in autumn 1919. The 1965 Tate Gallery catalogue notes that the typography was not done by Roberts.

Sarah Pregnant pre-June 1919\n\nTo the Lord of Song, c.1919 (also dated 191314 in the National Portrait Gallery 1994 catalogue). Pencil on paper, 10.0 x 9.8. The drawing shows Osbert, Sacheverell and Edith Sitwell presenting a laurel wreath to the Russian singer and actor Feodor Chaliapin at the Savoy Hotel. David Garnetts account of the event (in The Familiar Faces (London: Chatto & Windus, 1962), p. 24) describes William Walton (b. 1902) as being present, and this would indicate a date of later than 1918, as that was the year when Sacheverell and Walton met at Oxford. It is possible that the presentation of the wreath was to mark the return of Chaliapin to London following the end of the First World War. Honor Clerk in 1994 catalogue notes that neither Ediths nor William Roberts presence is recorded and the drawing is probably based on an account given to Roberts later. Sacherevell and Osbert Sitwell purchased and commissioned work from William Roberts in the period 191921, and it seems likely that the drawing was made at that time.

Other poets who appeared in Wheels included Nancy Cunard (whose poem in the first issue beginning I sometimes think that all our thoughts are wheels / Rolling forever through the painted world gave the series its title), Iris Tree and Aldous Huxley, and the 1919 volume was dedicated to the memory of Wilfred Owen, M.C., whose work it introduced, a year after he had died in the First World War.

Paul George Konody was born in Budapest in 1872 and educated in Vienna before settling in London in 1889. From 1900 to 1902 he was editor of The Artist, and he was later an art critic for The Observer and the Daily Mail before the First World War. In 1914 he was one of three critics to be blessed by Wyndham Lewis in Blast No. 1, and in 1917 he played an important role in Roberts being commissioned by the Canadian War Memorials Fund to paint the large-scale The First German Gas Attack at Ypres in 1918. He died in 1933. This portrait was presumably painted after Robertss war-artist work, and when exhibited at the Chenil Gallery in 1923 it was priced at £35. The painting has been in the Konody family since that date, although until recently art historians believed it to have been lost. PROVENANCE: P. G. Konody > Konody family collection.

The Cambridge 1985 catalogue described this Unidentified classical scene as perhaps a study for a Return of Odysseus, though it is possibly more likely that it depicts a simplified version of the start of Book 3 of the Odyssey, when Odysseus son, Telemachus, arrives at Pylus in search of information about his father, translated by William Cowper in the 1910 Everymans Library edition as follows:\n\nThe sun, emerging from the lucid waves,\n\nAscended now the brazen vault with light\n\nFor the inhabitants of earth and heavn,\n\nWhen in their bark at Pylus they arrived,\n\nCity of Neleus. On the shore they found\n\nThe people sacrificing; bulls they slew\n\nBlack without spot, to Neptune azure-haird.\n\nOn ranges nine of seats they sat; each range\n\nReceived five hundred, and to each they made\n\nAllotment equal of nine sable bulls.\n\nAnother possibility is that the picture depicts the point in the seventh labour of Hercules in Greek mythology when, having travelled to Crete to capture the bull that has been wreaking havoc on the island, Hercules has subdued the beast and is about to sail away with it. The Gillian Jason Gallery sold the picture as The Golden Calf, though the coastal setting and the boat seem to have nothing to do with the biblical story in Exodus 32.
