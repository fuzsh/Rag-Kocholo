        "text": "The Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Lenore J. Coffee\n\nBased on the novel “A Man Without Friends” by Margaret Echard\n\nDirector: King Vidor\n\nCast: Ruth Roman, Richard Todd, Mercedes McCambridge\n\nCinematographer: Sidney Hickox\n\nMusic: Max Steiner\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\nRelease: March 10, 1951\n\nPercent Noir: 50%\n\nI’ve probably written articles on 150-200 films noir at this point, so I need you to understand that I have a lot of context when I write the following statement: Shelley Carnes is the stupidest heroine I have ever seen in this genre of film. There isn’t a choice she makes during the 91 minute runtime of “Lightning Strikes Twice” which feels smart or, hell, even neutral. All you can do it shake your head watching her, then put your head in your hands, then finally shout helpful advice at her… knowing she wouldn’t take it even if she could hear you.\n\nRuth Roman plays Shelley, an actress who had a health scare while with a touring Shakespeare company. She’s been told to get some rest and relaxation and is trying to get to a desert ranch to do so when she is waylaid by a storm. Her borrowed car stuck in mud, she trudges to the nearest home to meet Richard (Richard Todd), who was on trial recently for murdering his wife and who basically screams at her and breaks logs menacingly in front of her for the entire night… but since he is handsome and gives her fried chicken she falls deeply and madly in love with him. Despite the fact that everyone, including Richard, tells her not to investigate the death of his wife, Shelley does so anyway. Is it Liza (Mercedes McCambridge), who owns the ranch Shelley is supposed to stay at and was the sole jury vote to clear Richard of the murder? (Also, isn’t it illegal to be on the jury if you know the person accused? Never mind.) Or Liza’s brother String (Darryl Hickman), who screams a lot about the murder and is named String, which is super suspicious in and of itself? Or maybe the mustachioed Harvey (Zachary Scott), who drives Shelley around at insane speeds while she begs him to stop for fun and has the aforementioned evil-man mustache?\n\nBehind the scenes were a bunch of really good filmmakers who should have known better than to make this movie. The screenwriter is the awesomely named Lenore J. Coffee, who penned several films noir including the excellent “Sudden Fear,” which netted star Joan Crawford an Oscar nomination. The director is King Vidor, who directed the all-time great “The Crowd” as well as “Duel in the Sun,” among many other well-remembered films. The cinematographer was Sidney Hickox, who lensed “Dark Passage” and “The Big Sleep.” How did no one stop and say “Uh, our main character is pretty terrible. Maybe we should rethink this.”\n\nTo be fair, Shelley’s macro arc appears to be lifted from Alfred Hitchcock’s “Rebecca,” where the main character falling in love with a man who may or may not have killed his wife. Falling in love with a probable murderer isn’t the smartest thing to do, but it is something you can forgive… especially in a genre like film noir. But Shelley’s stupidity goes far beyond this – there isn’t a scene that goes by without her making a dumb choice. There are small moments, like where she decides to pursue Richard by climbing across a perilous cliff’s edge despite having vertigo. Then there are the huge things. In the final act, she marries Richard and then, after a supporting character says something that throws some suspicion on him (but nothing more damning than anything she’s heard the entire movie about him), Shelley immediately forgets that she thinks he’s innocent, locks him in their bedroom and drives off to the home of the real murderer for safe haven. It’s taking all my inner strength not to throw multiple exclamation points at the ends of these sentences to underline her stupidity and my fury that the filmmakers allowed this to be their main character.\n\nAdding to my frustration is the fact that this is a damn good-looking movie. Vidor and Hickox collaborate beautifully, creating the barren world of the desert into everything foreboding. The first act storm that Shelley gets stuck in is beautifully realized, to the point where I would have been happy if the entire movie had taken place in that empty house as the rains raged outside.\n\nThe cast is filled with solid supporting players – McCambridge and Hickman are both outstanding in roles that could have easily been write-offs. After watching Roman suffer through the heinous “Five Steps to Danger,” it’s frustrating to see her again struggling with a terrible character. There are flashes where you see the good actress buried underneath the horrible Shelley, but they are honestly few and far between. If this had been my first movie seeing Roman, I wouldn’t walk away with the best impression. Todd and Scott excel at being blocks of wood, with Todd in particular not getting across any of the sexuality that should come with the danger… he just seems like a boringly handsome sociopath.\n\n“Lightning Strikes Twice” is the worst kind of bad movie. It insults your intelligence, is boring but there are flickers of goodness that serve as just enough to remind you that this could have been a decent film. I walked away frustrated and annoyed, and I have a feeling you will too. Avoid if you can."
