It was written by bassist Steve Harris and guitarist Dave Murray.\n\nLyrics[]\n\nI feel the breeze on my face in expectance Not very long before the storm reaches here Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again Feel something strong as the power draws near\n\nIs it the rolling thunder that scares you Is it the crashing of clouds that hold fear But all I know as I sit in a corner alone It takes me back to my childhood again\n\nAnd as I wait and look for an answer To all the things going round in my head I ask myself could it be a disaster and when It's maybe threatening to happen again\n\nAs the ominous light draws near There's a lone dog howls in the park All the people hurry inside As the lightning flash lights dark The storm is nearly here Only god will know\n\nYou're sitting alone you watch As the wind is blowing treetops And the swaying rusting of leaves Plenty all time to perceive As you wait for rain to fall Only god knows The whole sky glows\n\nMaybe lightning strikes twice Maybe lightning strikes Twice"
