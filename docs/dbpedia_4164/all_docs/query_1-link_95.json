        "text": "Our first set of \"lightning interviews\" were recorded on only the second day of this summer's Public Art Youth Employment program, when our Youth Apprentices were just starting to get a handle on their job responsibilities. We're now past the halfway point, so our young painters and videographers have some experience under their belts. They know their jobs. They know their projects have tight, non-negotiable, deadlines. They know that there are high expectations.\n\nAnd they are rising to the occasion.\n\nIn our latest blog post, we asked several of our Youth Apprentices and one of our valued clients questions about inspiration, aspirations and anticipation. One theme that came up repeatedly is that everybody is looking forward to their unveiling or premiere. Our Youth Apprentices are excited about their work, and they can't wait to show it to friends, family, their community, and you!\n\nThis summer, Creative Art Works Youth Apprentices are working at six locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn and The Bronx. Please follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for more interviews, as well as other news about this summer's Public Art Youth Employment programs.\n\nCreative Art Works has returned to Brookfield Place to paint four large canvasses for our supporter RBC. This summer, the crew is working in a very public setting – the north balcony of the Winter Garden at 230 Vesey Street.\n\nStop by the second floor overlooking the Winter Garden atrium to see this team at work. They will be painting from 9:30 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday through Thursday until August 7th. Join us for the official unveiling at 1:30 PM on August 8th.\n\nKimani REddick\n\nKimani is inspired by a wide range of music, from Marilyn Manson to acoustic guitar. While he has been painting for some time, this is his first job with CAW.\n\nWhat’s the hardest part about this job?\n\nA friend asked me, “Would you rather work hard all summer or would you rather have fun and paint?” And I said, “I think painting sounds hard!” But my grandfather was a really great artist, and he always wanted me to work on my art, so I signed up. I feel like if I put my time into it, it will become easier.\n\nWhat makes you nervous about this job?\n\nI’m nervous because going into things when you don’t know what to expect is always a little nerve-wracking, but I’m faking it with confidence!\n\nWhat excites you about this job?\n\nThe exciting part is going to be the unveiling of the art. That and the party afterwards. I’m going to make sure we throw down a dance challenge, and I’m going to convince everybody else to do it, because I’m a schemer. It’s called the “shoe challenge!” It will be fun for everybody.\n\nWhat’s your secret identity?\n\nYou mean the person behind my superhero persona? I guess a really, really, really, really nice kid who just wants to be kind to everyone.\n\nKoko Kabash\n\nKoko is 16. This is his first summer job ever. He was born in Senegal but moved to the US when he was six. He enjoys running along the FDR Drive. He plans to pursue computer programming when he graduates from high school.\n\nWhat was it like visiting Senegal?\n\nIt was like visiting a foreign country. I was too young to remember Senegal when I left.\n\nIf you could visit anywhere on earth, where would you go?\n\nJapan. I’ve wanted to climb Mount Fuji ever since I first saw a photo of it.\n\nIf you could have any super power, what would it be?\n\nSuper strength. It seems like a useful ability. Actually, no! Super speed, because I’m late to literally everything, and it would be nice to always be on time for a change.\n\nJulian Vasquez\n\nJulian previously worked for Read Alliance, tutoring early readers in underserved neighborhoods. This is his first job with CAW. He plans to become a carpenter and build houses.\n\nHow is painting different from carpentry?\n\nPainting is more delicate than carpentry. I’m learning to be gentler.\n\nWhat attracted you to this job?\n\nI get to work on something that will be seen for a while – I like leaving marks.\n\nWhat are some of the other ways you leave marks?\n\nEvery time I make a piece of furniture, I put my name on it. I’ve made wooden spoons, cutting boards, little stools, a jewelry box… I go to school for carpentry.\n\nWhat’s been the best part of working on this project?\n\nI enjoy the dynamic of my group. And I’m looking forward to the unveiling. I’ve given everybody in my family [invitations] and I’m expecting a lot of them to show up. I believe my parents will love the paintings. They appreciate art and they fully support me.\n\nThe Multimedia Team is divided into five productions teams, each working on a different short video. The following interviews all come from the Blue Jays, who are writing, shooting and editing a short documentary about The Audubon Mural Project, a collaboration between the National Audubon Society and Gitler &_____ Gallery to create murals of climate-threatened birds around Washington Heights, where John James Audubon spent the last years of his life. The project’s goal is to commission artists to paint murals of 314 species of birds listed in the Audubon Society’s groundbreaking Birds and Climate Change Report, which reports that at least half of all North American birds are threatened by a warming climate.\n\nJoin us for the world premiere of this and four other short documentaries on August 9th at 6:00 PM in the auditorium of A. Philip Randolph Campus High School in West Harlem. And stick around for the Grand Culminating Event afterwards. (Rumor has it that there's going to be a dance challenge)!\n\nNadiyah Timmons\n\nNadiyah would like to study architecture in college. This is her first job with CAW and her first time working on a documentary.\n\nWhy do you want to study architecture?\n\nI just like to draw. I like shapes, geometry.\n\nWhat do you want people to feel when they see your video?\n\nI want them to feel a sense of welcoming. I want the film to be open to interpretation. Some people may feel different about the murals in the community. We also get different points of view when we talk to people, and that's the same things I want to show in the documentary.\n\nWhat do you like about the program so far?\n\nI like how it's very hands-on. You’re always doing something, always busy. I like to talk to people in the community to understand how they feel about the [Audubon] murals.\n\nDid you have any difficulty learning to use the camera equipment?\n\nNo, it's pretty easy. They explained it one time, and I understood it. It looks harder than it is.\n\nHow do you like working with the group?\n\nI like everybody on my production crew and everybody on the whole Multimedia Team. It feels like everyone loves each other. It feels like another family.\n\nMarvin Matias\n\nThis is Marvin's third job working in video, but his first job with Creative Art Works. Marvin is going into his junior year, majoring in Sociology at CUNY York College in Jamaica, Queens. He enjoys writing poetry.\n\nYou've made films before. How do you think this one's going to come out? Are you excited about it?\n\nI feel about the same amount of anxiety that I had the last time I made a video. But this time, it feels more professional. I have executives, I have clients, I have people that I have to get approval from, people who want to make sure my group understands where we are going with our ideas. It feels like there are high expectations.\n\nHow do you think people will react when they see your team’s video?\n\nI think people will be excited. It's a topic that people should be talking about more. [This video] could spread the word, so more people will know about [the Audubon Mural Project].\n\nYou’ve got just under three weeks to finish your project. Are you nervous about the deadline?\n\nI am, because it does feel tight now, but as long as we manage our time well, then I think we will be okay.\n\nDo you have a favorite director?\n\nI'm not a film nerd, but if I were to pick any director it would be Quentin Tarantino. Django Unchained feels like some '70s cult movie I've seen.\n\nWhat kind of style do you want for your team’s video?\n\nI haven't really thought of that, honestly. It has to be natural. It won’t work if we force anything.\n\nArkella Mack\n\nThis is Arkella’s first job with Creative Art Works and her first time working in multimedia. Arkella is interested in art and design. She is considering cosmetology school in the fall.\n\nDid you ever imagine you’d be making a video documentary for your summer job?\n\nHonestly, no. It's definitely new and interesting, because it's fresh. That's something that I was hoping to get out of this summer. I like new experiences. I like new knowledge and being well-rounded.\n\nWhat's been the most interesting thing about the work so far?\n\nThe most interesting thing I would say is learning new things about my community. There are a lot of murals in this area that I didn't even notice. I didn't know the meaning behind them, but now I do. It definitely opened my eyes.\n\nWhat's been one of the biggest challenges so far?\n\nI'm not really a camera person or a tech person, so that was a little difficult for me. It’s a challenge coming out of my comfort zone, and being afraid to do things wrong.\n\nAre you comfortable talking to people and conducting interviews?\n\nPublic speaking has always been one of my fears, but it's definitely something that this project is helping me to overcome. I don't think it's going to be a problem for me anymore.\n\nHow do you think the project's going to turn out?\n\nI think it's going to be great. We already shot some good footage. There's definitely a lot more to come.\n\nAre you inviting any friends or family to the premiere?\n\nI'll invite my mom because, she's my biggest supporter. She would definitely love to be there to see my work.\n\nLucienny Aries\n\nLucienny just graduated from the Academy for Social Action. This is her first job with Creative Art Works and her first time working in multimedia.\n\nWhy did you want to work for Creative Art Works?\n\nI wanted to have a chance to be creative.\n\nSo far, how does your job hold up to your expectations?\n\nI thought we were going to paint! But it’s cool, because I still get to be creative and I’m learning new stuff. I started this job not knowing anything about filming. But now I'm learning how to edit videos and how to properly use a camera. I also learned how to do animations and voice overs.\n\nWhat do you hope people with take away from your project?\n\nI just want them to appreciate the art that's in their community. The murals bring color to the blocks.\n\nWhat is your impression of the Youth Apprentices working on the mural?\n\nI was struck by the fact that it was such a diverse group of students. Not just ethnically, but in terms of interests and abilities.\n\nWhat did you think of their client presentation?\n\nThey were all involved in the presentation. Every student took ownership of the design in some way. They really listened to the things [Principal Ben Lev] said he wanted to see in the mural and they obviously thought about it with intentionality and purpose and tried to reflect those things in their design. I could see around the room all the different iterations of ideas they created while brainstorming ideas. I thought they did an amazing job of capturing the vision of their clients.\n\nWhat do you think these apprentices will take away from their experience?\n\nAs someone who incorporates integrative education into my own teaching, I saw this confluence of skills coming together in one authentic task. It seemed like they are developing so many skills all at once. They are learning artistic skills, how to work as a team, even a bit of science. We want students to understand that the skills that we're teaching them are not for the sake of a test, but because these skills are going to help them be independent people when they go out into the world, so they can make the best possible decisions for themselves and their community."
