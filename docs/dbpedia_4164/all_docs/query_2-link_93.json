        "text": "While riding the bus in the early 1960s from the Columbia campus to dilapidated Baker Field on the tip of Manhattan for Ivy League football games, Arthur \"Archie\" Roberts never expected he would become the NFL's version of Archie \"Moonlight\" Graham.\n\nGraham, as played by Burt Lancaster, was a baseball player turned MD in the movie \"Field of Dreams.\" In his lone major league game, Graham, like the real-life player he is named for, had no fielding chances or at-bats. He left no proof behind that he had ever made the big time.\n\nIt almost was Roberts' life story. \"In the movie, he was a guy who loved sports, but devoted his life to medicine. So I can see the analogy,\" said Roberts, 70.\n\nA retired heart surgeon living in Little Silver, N.J., Roberts founded the non-profit Living Heart Foundation (LHF), which uses sophisticated medical screening to detect cardiovascular problems in retired NFL players.\n\nBut at one time, he was the best Columbia quarterback since Sid Luckman in the 1930s, although there hadn't been a lot of challengers for the honor with the perennially weak Lions. The New York Jets drafted him in the seventh round of the 1965 draft, but they had already taken Bob Schwikert of VPI (as Virginia Tech was called at the time) in the fourth round, Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte of Notre Dame in the second, and a fellow named Joe Namath at No. 1.\n\nPrudently, Roberts, who intended eventually to go to Columbia Medical School, never signed with the Jets.\n\nHe had entertained two dreams for years, having informed his astonished parents at the age of 12 that he intended to become a pro football quarterback and a heart surgeon. Neither dream went away with the sunrise.\n\nRoberts and officials at Columbia and Case Western Reserve reached an agreement with Browns owner Art Modell, in which Roberts would be the third-string quarterback in 1965-66 behind Frank Ryan and Jim Ninowski while attending medical school at CWRU. The task was made easier because the Browns practiced there at the time.\n\nDespite missing the occasional chalk talk or med school lecture, Roberts completed two years of the curriculum. The third year meant being \"on-call,\" and working day and night in a hospital. In 1967, he asked to take a one-year leave of absence from CWRU if he could be traded. \"I really would like a shot at playing for a year,\" he said.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins, one year old at the time and quarterback-deprived, seemed to be just the team. However, the Dolphins' No. 1 draft pick in 1967 turned out to be future Pro Football Hall of Famer Bob Griese. \"Even though it was the best of plans from my point of view to see if I could play, Griese quickly established that I would be back on the sideline, holding a clipboard,\" said Roberts.\n\nUnlike Moonlight Graham, however, Roberts has statistical proof that reached his game's highest level. In a 41-0 Dolphins loss in a driving rain at powerful Kansas City, he completed five of 10 passes for only 11 yards. He was intercepted once. \"In the scramble on that play, a receiver broke free down the middle. It would have been an easy throw and catch, but just as I threw the ball, I was hit. It was wet and windy, and the ball slipped and fluttered. What should have been an easy six points became an interception that was run back 30 or 40 yards,\" said Roberts.\n\nSometimes, life closes a door we don't have the strength to shut ourselves. Roberts returned to Case, finished his medical training, and later performed over 4,000 open-heart operations.\n\nEleven years ago, he was giving a speech to a cardiolgist conference in New Jersey. \"Right at that moment, I experienced garbled speech and weakness, in my right arm and hand, and that was the presentation of a small stroke,\" said Roberts.\n\n\"I was relatively a young man who had never been sick in his life, a former professional football player and a heart surgeon. That I had not realized enough to take care of myself while taking care of my patients was the thought that struck me at that time.\"\n\nAfter recovering with no residual effects, Roberts founded the Living Heart Foundation, aimed at helping others prevent cardiovascular problems. The key diagostic tool is the LipoScience NMR LipoProfile test, which has detected heart problems in the making even when cholesterol levels are normal.\n\nThe \"coming-of-age\" moment for LHF came when the foundation offered over 1,900 free screenings to the first responders and rescue workers who had been breathing toxic fumes at Ground Zero. Two weeks after the 9/11 attacks, the screenings began at the New York Police Academy, about two miles from the Twin Towers site.\n\nThe \"heroes,\" as Roberts calls the rescue workers, stood in line on the stairwells of every floor of the building and out the door. \"The smoke was still in the sky,\" said Roberts of the funereal plume that hung over the devastated Twin Towers site. \"Fires were still blazing. It was always smoky.\"\n\nIn cooperation with the NFL and the NFL Players Association, LHF now offers free screening to retired players. Concussions make the news today as the big health concern in contact sports. But heart disease never took a knee and left the field. \"The large-bodied men who play in the line are at particular risk,\" said Roberts. \"They tend to gain even more weight after they retire.\"\n\nAmong many who have been saved by the LHF screenings is former Ravenna, Kent State and Baltimore running back Don Nottingham, who was found to be suffering arterial blockage so severe that he needed a quintuple bypass.\n\nArchie Roberts didn't make his mark on the NFL record book. Just on its players' lives.\n\nTo reach Bill Livingston:\n\nblivingston@plaind.com, 216-999-4672"
