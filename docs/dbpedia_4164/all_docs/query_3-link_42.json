        "text": "On the line of the Offa‚Äôs Dyke Path to the north of Penycloddiau hillfort, a highlight of the Clwydian Range, one encounters a memorial of two components: one wood, one inscribed slate. It is a present-day memorial situated in a landscape location unlike any other I‚Äôve encountered.\n\nThe stile upon the fence dividing the hillfort from the lower ground is a memorial in itself, inscribed: ‚ÄòATR 1905-1991‚Äô on its north-facing (downslope) cross-beam.\n\nNext to it, loose and propped against the fence, is a tall, slender, polished slate memorial stone, inscribed in the Welsh language in remembrance of the same individual:\n\nEr cof am\n\nArthur\n\nRoberts\n\nMBE\n\nCeidwady\n\nwlad\n\na garodd\n\n1905-1991.\n\nCymdeithas\n\ny cerddwyr\n\nLlwybr Clawdd\n\nOffa ‚Äì Ramblers\n\nHolidays\n\nymgyrch dros\n\ndiogelu Cymru wledig.\n\nAccording to Coflein this translates as ‚ÄòConserver of the Countryside; Offa‚Äôs Dyke Trail; Ramblers Holidays; Council for the Protection of Rural Wales‚Äô.\n\nI enquired about this to Rob Dingle, the Offa‚Äôs Dyke National Trail Officer. He contacted Denbighshire County Council‚Äôs AONB Area Manager, David Shiel, who generously confirmed that Arthur Roberts MBE was a ‚Äòleading member of the Ramblers Association in the Midlands‚Äô as well as with the CPRW (Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales) and other countryside bodies.\n\nEvidently from the inscription, the Offa‚Äôs Dyke Path was itself one of the foci of his energies, and upon it his dual memorial is situated. Moreover, it has a broader context, not only comprising of multiple prehistoric hillforts and a cairn, but a walker‚Äôs cairn on the summit within the Bronze Age cairn. This itself has a memorial dimension focusing on its restoration.\n\nThe Offa‚Äôs Dyke Path thus incorporates monuments to its supporters and its own history, and the conservation efforts along its line.\n\nWhat is striking to me, however, it Roberts‚Äô memorial‚Äôs precarity. The stile will have to be replaced at some point to improve access, with a gate as elsewhere I suspect. Moreover, the stone itself is not earthfast, and is unusual as a product of a memorial mason placed in the landscape but ostensibly unfixed. It has evidently lasted over 28 years, but for how much longer before this commemorative stone and its stile will themselves ‚Äògo out in style‚Äô?"
