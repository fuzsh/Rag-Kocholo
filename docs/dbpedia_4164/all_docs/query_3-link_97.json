        "text": "It's a Christmas miracle! The Polar Express will chug through New Orleans again in 2024, bringing a beloved Yuletide tradition back after four long, sad years.\n\nBut it will need help. The production will hold auditions later this month for actors in New Orleans. Roles require singing and dancing, and the parts include a conductor and a trainload of elves along with (shhhhhh) Santa.\n\nThe rail experience, based on the hugely successful book and animated movie of the same name, includes music, onboard entertainment and a reading of Chris Van Allsburg's book. In New Orleans, the train rolls slowly from the Union Passenger Terminal in the CBD, while passengers drink hot chocolate and sing carols.\n\nA message on the nolathepolarexpressride.com website announced the Christmas comeback.\n\n\"The Magic Returns!\" the announcement said. \"The Polar Express Train Ride will return to New Orleans December 2024!\"\n\nThe Polar Express Train Ride is a live re-enactment of the 1985 children's book by Van Allsburg in which a Michigan child awakes on Christmas Eve to find a train outside his home and rides to the North Pole, where he and other pajama-clad passengers receive gifts from Santa Claus.\n\nThe story was made into a film with Tom Hanks in 2004.\n\nOnce a holiday staple in New Orleans, the train ride had not been offered in the Crescent City since 2019. Since then, a hurricane and the pandemic have derailed the attraction, although no reason was ever given for its absence in 2023.\n\nIn 2022, the Polar Express cited \"a systemwide shortage of passenger railroad equipment and certified crews\" for its failure to run.\n\nIn 2021, the business blamed \"extensive damage from Hurricane Ida at Union Passenger Terminal and elsewhere in the city,\" adding, \"we are unable to secure the space and permits required to host the event this year.\"\n\nIn 2020, during the COVID pandemic when most gatherings were banned, the Facebook page said: \"It was heartbreaking to learn that we were unable to host The Polar Express Train Ride in New Orleans this holiday season. However, it is certainly not an end to the magic.\""
