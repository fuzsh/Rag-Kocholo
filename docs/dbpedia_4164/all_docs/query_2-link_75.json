        "text": "Not of This Earth\n\n, a remake of Roger Corman's 1957 cult classic, tells the quirky story of a strange alien vampire (Arthur Roberts) that's come to our planet in search of suitable blood to harvest for his species. He hires a nurse (Traci Lords) to take care of him while he's here, but soon she starts to worry that her patient isn't who he says he is. A series of bizarre incidents ensue, complete with the usual exploitative flare.\n\nThe film, directed by Jim Wynorski, is all over the board – the seams of this low-budget production visible in every corner. There's stock footage from classic Corman pictures, wonky editing, wooden performances and serious holes in logic. But, once the film gets going, those errors mostly fade away into a sea of goofy, campy, downright strange B-movie nuttiness.\n\nTraci Lords is a hoot as our heroine, stretching her acting muscles outside the world of porn (her previous forte). And Arthur Roberts is just terrific as Mr. Johnson, our resident alien, whose matter-of-fact dialogue and demeanor is really quite funny.\n\nWhile Not of This Earth holds very few shocks and jolts, let alone any real alien mischief (most of the movie monsters in this film have been borrowed from other features), it's a pleasing cinematic diversion, an homage to Corman's B-movies from the '70s and '80s. The film is rarely great, by any definition, but it's a blast to watch regardless – if one finds silly exploitative B-movies appealing.\n\nIn keeping with Shout! Factory's other Roger Corman Collection releases, the transfer has been remastered using the best possible materials, likely the print from Roger Corman's vault. It's a shame, though, Shout! didn't pair this one with Corman's original film, or bring this quirky little movie to Blu-ray.\n\nAlas, the results are not as impressive as some of his other releases, but it's a solid effort overall. Black and white specks, along with other dirt and debris (including the occasional reel change marker) is present throughout, but most of the flaws appear to be damage to the film itself, and not the result of this digital remaster. When the print exhibits less dirt and grime, it actually looks pretty darn good, with fine shadows, great colors and a surprising amount of depth. Obviously, this print doesn't hold a candle to many big-budget catalog releases, but the dust and dirt here simply add character to the film's low-budget tone.\n\nThe film's 2.0 stereo mix is suitable, but hardly very engaging. Still, the mix rarely succumbs to many post-production distortions or crackles from the remaster and is mostly dampened by the film's obvious budgetary limitations. Like the transfer, the gritty mix suits the film rather well, adding to the picture's inherent grindhouse B-movie aesthetic.\n\nExtras on the disc include a brand-new audio commentary with director Jim Wynorski and actress Traci Lords, which delves into Traci's experiences on her first film, and how Wynorski re-imagined Roger Corman's original 1957 picture. It's a truly charming listening experience, especially the awkwardness the two share during the film's lengthy nude sequences. There's also a classic DVD commentary from director Wynorski. It's equally engaging, but far more technical, diving into the tumultuous world of working on a Corman picture, right down to why there's so much stock footage from other Corman pictures in the movie and how the footage was edited into the feature.\n\nAlso on the disc is an 11-minute interview with Traci Lords, who discusses working on her first \"real\" movie (following an extensive illegal underage porn career), her encounters with the cast and crew, and how the experience has impacted her. Good stuff overall, but there is some repeat from the audio commentary. Rounding out the disc is a photo gallery with stills from the film, and trailers for this film, the original film, as well as Starcrash and Galaxy of Terror -- all films are highly recommended, by the way.\n\nNot of This Earth is not going to be for everyone's tastes. It's a B-movie right down to its core, flaws and all. And there's a lot of stock footage in the feature, so if you've experienced any of Corman's '70s and '80s sci-fi/horror pictures (Battle Beyond the Stars, Galaxy of Terror, Hollywood Boulevard, Humanoids from the Deep, Piranha, Battle Beyond the Sun and Forbidden World), the movie might be a bit frustrating to watch at times. Or, it'll be a hoot – a spirited, funny homage to other classic low-budget cinema. It all depends on what you're looking for in your B-movie."
