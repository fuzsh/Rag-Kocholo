        "text": "I had never seen a storm like it. It was 20 July 1992, I was 24 years old, and I was on a 24-hour shift at the ammunition supply point at Fort Benning, Georgia. I had been serving in the US army for a year and a half, and was working that evening as an ammunition inspector.\n\nI was standing at the entrance to the small wooden guards’ building with another guard behind me. I watched the rainstorm blowing in when suddenly a bolt of lightning split a tree in half about 50 yards from where I was, making me jump. Another bolt of lightning flashed brightly, spinning and crackling around a nearby razor-wire fence. My heart pounded.\n\nThe rain arrived loudly, soaking my boots. A big flash of blue light hit me, lifting me off the ground and throwing me about 30ft away on to the concrete floor. Electricity passed through me and it felt like I was on fire. At the time, I felt myself leaving my body, looking down at myself as one of the guards tried to revive me. I felt I had a choice, to turn away or to face the pain. I made a conscious decision and was back in my body. And in agony.\n\nI later found out that the lightning had entered my feet and exited through my mouth, stopping my heart, damaging blood vessels, burning nerves and fusing my jaw. After five minutes, an ambulance crew arrived to resuscitate me. Doctors were shocked I had survived. I couldn’t speak or remember what words meant.\n\nI had met my partner, David, on the base. We had been dating for just six months and now he was my carer. I had to learn to read and write, walk and talk. I was learning stuff that David’s three-year-old daughter Angela had mastered. Trying to put the broken pieces back together was frightening. I was scared to go outside, and diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nA year to the day after I’d been struck by lightning, a big storm was brewing outside. After seeing how nervous I was, the psychologist at Fort Benning insisted I face my fears. “You are a soldier,” he said. “You need to go home, watch the storm and override your fear.”\n\nSo I stood on the metal threshold of our house. The rain fell, soaking my bare feet and splashing my legs. I saw the flash and heard the thunder at the same time. A lightning bolt burned through me and threw me back 9ft into the house where David and Angela were. It blew out the TV and lightbulbs. “Oh my God, oh my God!” I yelled. I’d been struck again.\n\nThe first time I was hit, I was told the odds of being hit and surviving as I had were one in 12m, though people have come up with lots of different numbers over the years. But what are the odds of being hit a year to the day, the same way, and surviving twice?\n\nI already lived with so much pain that we don’t know how much I was physically affected the second time. But I became more fearful than ever. It took years to feel comfortable leaving the house. David stood by me, and four months later, in November 1993, I was able to stand up with a stick at our wedding. The next year our son, Casey, was born, and I started the first of many surgeries. Casey spent much of his first decade on his mum’s wheelchair, as I underwent seven operations. I’ve had my jaw reconstructed; my feet, too. Because the blood vessels in my toes had been obliterated by the lightning, the tissue had died and all 10 of my toes had to be amputated – the last one this year.\n\nI couldn’t believe how life had turned out, how my military career had been replaced by being stranded in a wheelchair. But I learned to adapt. And after every surgery I learned to walk all over again. I started advising soldiers who suffered traumatic brain injuries, and I talk at PTSD and pain-management clinics. I still feel pain every day, but I’ve taught myself to tune it out. I won’t ever go out in a storm, but I’ve learned to come to terms with my fears. I can’t be afraid of living.\n\nAs told to Ben Gelblum"
