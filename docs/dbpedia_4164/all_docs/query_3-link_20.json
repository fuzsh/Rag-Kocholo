        "text": "This website was set up by the family of George Arthur Roberts to celebrate his life and legacy. Born in 1891 he came to the UK around 1914, fought in World War I and was a founder member of the British Legion in 1919 and the League of Coloured Peoples in 1931. He was the first black man to join the Auxiliary Fire Service in 1938 and received the British Empire Medal for his work setting up discussion groups within the fire service in 1944. As interest in his life has grown, his family continue to honour his memory and disseminate his work as widely as possible.\n\n​\n\nNorman Hepple's portrait of George Arthur Roberts\n\ndated July 1941.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFOLLOWING the extraordinary success of the television adverts for ancestry.com with 689,000 views on YouTube and featuring the voice of his great granddaughter, the genealogy website has again led its advertising campaign with this striking picture of George Arthur Roberts.\n\nThe image, originated from a photograph of Roberts taken during his World War Two work for the Auxiliary Fire Service, is already appearing in newspapers and magazines including the Radio Times and other publications nationwide.\n\nMeanwhile the television advert will be live for a second year and is already being featured on screens internationally. The advertisement can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/abWQZPf26Ew\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nGeorge Arthur Roberts was a founder member of the Royal British Legion in 1917 and the Royal British Legion are looking for anyone who may have memories of his work for the Camberwell Branch he founded in 1940. He wrote about his work for them in a 1961 edition of the legion magazine when he recalled \"The Battle of Westminster Bridge\". He was a president of the Camberwell branch and was made a life member of the branch in 1962.\n\nIf you have any information on George Arthur Roberts and his work for the British Legion, please use the contact sheet below to get in touch.\n\nPictures: The Royal British Legion makes brief mention of Roberts in its September 2020 issue commemorating VJ day.
