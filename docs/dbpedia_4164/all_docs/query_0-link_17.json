        "text": "This article examines Edgar G. Ulmer's Detour (1945) as an example of film noir's exploration of the affective dimension of early oil-regime America. Drawing on the work of energy-humanities scholars, the article finds the film, and by extension the genre, providing a much-needed ground-level perspective on the efforts of industry and government to stimulate oil consumption by creating desires in a public struggling with the inherent paradoxes of new technologies, foremost among them the car. The automobile gave rise to “automobility,” seemingly an expansion of democratic freedoms, yet that new way of life also entrapped its participants within destructive habits of consumption involving an entire suite of beliefs, practices, habits, and other technologies. These features of the new life, in turn, were understood within a racialized narrative of whiteness to be productive rather than extractive habits. The shadowy and fated network to which film noir gestures, the article thus argues, is not some abstract metaphysical contemplation or generalized conclusion on a period of war, but a felt recognition of the ways the rapidly expanding network of extraction, distribution, and consumption was compelling Americans to remake their lives in dramatic ways that felt beyond their control.\n\n3 Commonly recognized features of film noir include Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward's observation that noir “is essentially a translation of both character emotions and narrative concepts into a pattern of visual usage,” a pattern Janey Place and Lowell Peterson have explored as concentrated in low-key, high-contrast lighting, with prevalent shadows: see, for example, Pratt, Ray, Projecting Paranoia: Conspiratorial Visions in American Film (Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 2001), 52, 51Google Scholar. But most important to definitions of the genre has been a description of its effect, encapsulated by Isenberg as “a mood, a tone, or a sensibility” of “a lurid, cheapened, morally depraved universe.” Isenberg, Noah, Edgar G. Ulmer: A Filmmaker at the Margins (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2014), 169CrossRefGoogle Scholar. As reinforced by Belton, one of the most influential characterizations of noir has been the very first, which was Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton's 1955 insistence on noir's production of a “malaise” in the viewer. John Belton, “Film Noir's Knights of the Road,” Bright Lights Film Journal, 1 Nov. 2006, at https://brightlightsfilm.com/film-noirs-knights-road/#.XdQ0CldKiUk. Although many have debated whether noir is indeed a proper genre, I would like to use the term in this article as a way to track the “family resemblance” of a group of filmic texts that use a shared visual and emotional vocabulary to tackle a “slippery” subject.\n\n4 The debate around film noir's identification and definition is a long and storied one. My approach shares concerns similar to those of Dussere, Erik, America Is Elsewhere: The Noir Tradition in the Age of Consumer Culture (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014)Google Scholar, but it also adheres to what Dussere notes is “a rough consensus among critics that noir tends to position itself oppositionally, providing a critical viewpoint on American politics of the forties and fifties, portraying the underside of the American dream.” Ibid., 23.\n\n10 In this exploration, I am taking up the invitation implicit in Schuster's comment: “Let's face it, the absent presence of oil in modernist art is too compelling to not demand critical investigation, even as such inquiry is like the plot of a film noir, with the detective looking for the perpetrator who is everywhere woven into the fabric of the mise-en-scene but still confounds direct interrogation.” Schuster, Joshua, “Where Is the Oil in Modernism?” in Wilson, Sheena, Carlson, Adam, and Szeman, Imre, eds., Petrocultures: Oil, Politics, Culture (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2017), 197–213, 199Google Scholar.\n\n14 Isenberg, Edgar G. Ulmer, 77, 85, 123. So too does the film echo some of the trajectory of its screenwriter and the author of the film's source novel, Martin M. Goldsmith, who as a struggling writer worked a grueling job as a cross-country automobile driver for Americans headed west. Goldsmith, Martin M., Detour (Floyd, VA: Black Curtain Press, 2013)Google Scholar. Subsequent references are given parenthetically in the text. For a reading of the protagonist's trip as a reflection of the troubled Hollywood experiences of its main actors, Tom Neal and Ann Savage, see Kalat, David, “Detour's Detour,” in Herzogenrath, Bernd, ed., The Films of Edgar G. Ulmer (Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2009), 137–58, 155–57Google Scholar. For more on Detour's direct address of the viewer, and the common feature of film noir that it is a “readerly text,” see Belton, “Film Noir's Knights of the Road.” See also Modleski, Tonia, “Film Theory's Detour,” Screen, 23, 5 (1982), 72–79, 79CrossRefGoogle Scholar, on the element that the film's “spectator himself is treated as a persecutor by the hero.”\n\n20 Jones, Christopher, Routes of Power: Energy and Modern America (Cambridge, MA and London: Harvard University Press, 2014), 5CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Yergin, Daniel, The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power (New York: Touchstone, 1991), 87Google Scholar. The Texas crude that glutted the world market after the Spindletop gusher of 1901 was too low a quality to refine into kerosene, so it was repurposed away from lighting to “heat and power and locomotion,” spurring the immediate overhaul from coal-fired machinery to oil-powered engines that was to sweep across the globe. See also Keating, Patrick, “Film Noir and the Culture of Electric Light,” Film History, 27, 1 (2015), 58–84, 60CrossRefGoogle Scholar, on the electricity industries’ encouragement of increased consumption.\n\n33 Sachs, 112. As Mimi Sheller observes about “automotive emotions,” “The very passions that feed into certain kinds of love for the car or joy in driving may equally elicit opposite feelings of hatred for traffic, rage at other drivers, boredom with the same route, or anger at government transportation policies”; and with one's hands on the wheel, one had the power to make those emotions felt by others. Sheller, “Automotive Emotions,” 224.\n\n52 According to Brook, film noir afforded especially émigré directors such as Ulmer a way to perform cultural critique of the US along the lines of Horkheimer and Adorno; or, as he puts it, the style “offered exile filmmakers the nearest thing to dialectical exchange with the culture industry as was possible from within the belly of the beast.” Brook, Vincent, Driven to Darkness: Jewish Émigré Directors and the Rise of Film Noir (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2009), 5CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n58 Gas appliances were responsible for a high number of deaths annually in big cities (825 deaths in New York City in 1926), and the occasional catastrophe, such as the explosion that took the lives of 294 students and teachers in New London, Texas, on 18 March 1937. See Trichter, Jerome B. and Helpern, Milton, “Accidental Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Due to Domestic Gas Appliances and Gas Refrigerators: The Problem in New York City and Its Control,” American Journal of Public Health, 42 (March 1952)Google ScholarPubMed, 259–67; “The New London Texas School Explosion,” at http://nlsd.net/index2.html. Los Angeles was home to a high number of gas appliances, as 67.1% of its households contained such a source of heat in 1940, and films – and news stories about suicides and accidental deaths by asphyxiation – kept in public view gas's potential deadliness. See the relevant US Census data, at www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/census/historic/fuels.html.\n\n94 Dussere quotes Dean MacCannell as observing, “The best way to characterize noir sensibility is as a ‘false nostalgia’ or ‘constructed nostalgia.’ What is produced is a sense of loss of something that was never possessed, something that never was” – which sounds to me the perfect description of the effect of the thwarting of a manufactured desire. See Dussere, America Is Elsewhere, 11."
