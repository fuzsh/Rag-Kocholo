        "text": "Excerpt from interview in Computer Music Journal , 17:2, pp. 17-22 (Summer 1993) by Earl Dumour\n\nDumour: Tell us about your musical background.\n\nRoberts: I went to music school in New York City, where I was born and brought up. At the age of 15, after taking piano lessons from miscellaneous private instructors for nine years, I finally reached a place where I learned something, a school that is now known as the Manhattan School of Music. I started there in 1927, stayed there until 1933, when I graduated with a diploma in piano. That's also where I met my wife, Janice. I had several piano teachers, the last and most important of which was Rudolph Gruen. Of course, I had all sorts of classes in ensemble playing, theory, and counterpoint. I studied composition under Hugh Ross and Quincy Porter.\n\nThe same year I also received my master's degree in physics from Columbia University. At that point it became necessary to decide about my future career. Was I going to be a musician or a physicist? I decided that professionally I'd better be a physicist. I was a moderately good pianist, but not really good enough for the concert stage. It looked as if I would have to resort to teaching piano. Physics sounded like more fun that that, and I think it has been. One of the strongest arguments for going into physics was that I could still keep up with music as a physicist, but I couldn't keep up with physics as a musician. Ever since then, I've been a composer.\n\n...\n\nDumour: How was your musical work viewed by your colleagues at the Argonne National Laboratories?\n\nRoberts: Usually you'll find among scientists a great number of people who are very fond of classical music. I had lots of sympathy and admiration. The man who was in charge of scientific films at Argonne, George Treseel, asked me to write computer music for his films. So I did that. I wrote the title music for a short film called Link that had to do with the analysis of bubble chamber photographs. He then asked me to write the music for the full-length feature film they were doing called The Many Faces of Argonne, which I wrote for conventional instruments; it was recorded by members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. That film won an award later that year at a film festival in Belgium.\n\n...\n\nDumour: One of the most difficult pieces of equipment to find in the early days was a digital-to-analog converter.\n\nRoberts: Yes, they were rare and expensive; an 8-bit DAC cost several thousand dollars...\n\n...\n\nDumour: Much of your music has a humorous edge."
