        "text": "About the Book\n\nTackling some of the most common scientific myths still believed today, Brian Clegg blows these widely held misconceptions about the workings of our world out of the water in this engaging and entertaining book.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nA revealing and entertaining guide through some of the biggest misconceptions in science that many of us still believe.\n\nYou may well be familiar with the fact that lightning, contrary to the popular saying, often strikes the same place twice. But this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what many of us wrongly believe about the way the world works. Whether it's word of mouth, myths you've read about online, or misremembered facts from school, we're bombarded by misconceptions about the science we come into contact with every day - this book will uncover the most popular myths to help you avoid contributing to the perpetuation of these misunderstandings. Breaking it down into fifty of the most popular misconceptions in science, each chapter of this book will be headed up with a 'fact', followed by the real story, providing the science and theory that debunks the myth. From fears about the exponential growth of the human population to the embarrassment of always pointing out the north star as the brightest in the sky, this is the book to read if you want to separate the science fact from fiction.\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"Ingenious, often complex insights from an expert.\" - Kirkus Reviews on Ten Patterns that Explain the Universe \"This book is a valuable contribution to popular science, providing a kaleidoscope of visuals that will appeal to readers across generational divides\" - Science onTen Patterns that Explain the Universe \"Using beautiful illustrations and illuminating diagrams, the book is a feast for the eyes.
