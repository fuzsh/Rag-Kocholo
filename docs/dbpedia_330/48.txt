The National Library of Australia holds a similar, colour photo of this scene.

Varian Techtron was the result of a merger between the Australian company Techtron and the American firm Varian Associates in 1967. The Springvale Road site (then in Springvale North, but now in Mulgrave) was established by Techtron and is still in use, but now as Agilent Technologies (which acquired Varian in 2009). Techtron Appliances was established in 1938 and it and its successor companies have produced a variety of electronic and analytic equipment for industry and scientific research, notably including Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometers (AAS) to CSIRO specifications.
