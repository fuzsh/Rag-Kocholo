        "text": "Helios\n\nTTTBV supplied an integrated communication system for the HELIOS, consisting of an ACM telephone system and linked to it a SPA PA/GA public address / general system. In addition to the telephone and intercom / talkback functionalities of the ACM system, the possibility of PA/GA distribution via the devices is also used. By integrating ACM and SPA for PA/GA distribution, the number of speakers and amplifier power can be saved. Furthermore, the integration of both systems also has functional advantages, such as giving PA messages from authorized extensions.\n\nTTTBV leverde verder voor de Helios:\n\nSeematz | Window wipers\n\nSeematz | Searchlights\n\nVingtor Stentofon | Communication\n\nSpartacus\n\nThe Spartacus is a Cutter Suction Dredger (CSD). A cutter suction dredger is a specialized dredger equipped with a rotating cutter head at the suction inlet. The cutterhead is used to loosen and loosen the seabed material while the dredger pumps the material through a pipeline to a designated location for land reclamation disposal.\n\nThe Spartacus has impressive technical specifications. With a total known power of 44,180 kW, making it the most powerful CSD in the world at the time.\n\nIn addition, one of the revealing features of Spartacus is the ability to operate autonomously. The ship is designed to be remotely piloted while reducing the need for onboard personnel during specific operations, increasing security and increasing safety.\n\nFurthermore, the Spartacus is built with an emphasis on sustainability and reducing the impact on the environment. It uses advanced technologies to improve fuel efficiency and minimize emissions.\n\nBenguela Gem\n\n\"Benguela Gem\" is a diamond mining vessel owned and operated by Debmarine Namibia, a subsidiary of De Beers Group. Debmarine Namibia is a marine diamond exploration, mining, and diamond recovery company. The vessel is owned and operated by Debmarine Namibia, a joint venture between the Namibian government and De Beers Group. Debmarine Namibia is one of the world's leading marine diamond mining companies and plays a significant role in Namibia's diamond industry.\n\nBenguela Gem is equipped with advanced mining technology to efficiently extract diamonds from the ocean floor. This involves seabed crawling and underwater diamond mining operations. The diamonds are extracted from the seabed using specialized equipment, and the recovered material is brought onboard the vessel for processing. The diamonds are then separated from other materials using various techniques, including dense media separation and X-ray sorting.\n\nTTT leverde voor de Benguela Gem onder meer\n\nZenitel Vingtor | Geïntegreerd communicatiesysteem\n\nZenitel Vingtor | ACM draadloos communicatiesysteem\n\nVox Maxima\n\nThe trailing suction hopper dredger Vox Maxima with a hopper capacity of 31,200 m3 was declared Ship of the Year in 2010. The jury awarded the prize because this largest dredger ever built in the Netherlands is very well thought out and has excellent transport efficiency. IHC Dredgers has succeeded in achieving a high ship speed with a large hopper capacity and thus a full ship shape.\n\nFor the Vox Maxima, TTT has an integrated communication system and linked SPA public address / general alarm system, consisting of an ACM telephone system. In addition, TTTBV also supplied a Vingtor Marine TETRA wireless communication system. This system is integrated in the ACM system and can therefore use many specific properties of the ACM system.\n\nTTT leverde voor de Vox Máxima onder meer\n\nPesch Seematz | Searchlight\n\nZenitel Vingtor | Integrated communication system\n\nZenitel Vingtor | ACM wireless communication system\n\nMCT Brattberg | Waterproof cable transits\n\nFrank Bonnefaas\n\nAfter a renovation of three quarters of a year at Damen Shiprepair Vlissingen, the stern trawler SCH-72 Frank Bonefaas of Cornelis Vrolijk's Visserij Maatschappij has returned to its home port. During the renovation, the almost 120 meter long stern trawler from 1993 was completely emptied and rebuilt.\n\nA Vingtor Marine integrated communication system ACM E7 was supplied by TTTBV for the FRANK BONEFAAS SCH72. This system replaces the Vingtor Marine VMP system installed in new construction. Replacement and commissioning were carried out by TTTBV, the original telephones remained in use. An ASCOM paging system with personal security is also supplied. If the person falls or activates the handset manually, a spoken instruction will sound through the loudspeaker on predefined extensions so that help can be called in immediately.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci\n\nThe 121m Cutter Suction Dredger, from Jan de Nul, Leonardo da Vinci has been dredging for years on behalf of the construction of the Utah Point Berth in Port Hedland Harbour, Western Australia.\n\nTTTBV supplied a Vingtor Marine ACM system for the Leonardo da Vinci to replace the existing communication system. A DECT system has also been supplied for expansion, naturally integrated into the ACM system. After assembly by the ship's crew, the installation was commissioned by TTT on the basis of a construction plan carefully prepared.\n\nNeptune\n\nThe Neptune is a 60 by 38m self-elevating platform, which is mainly used in the construction of offshore wind farms. With a 2,750 tons pre-load per leg and a 600 tons crane of 26 m, it belongs to the larger DP2 installation vessels of GeoSea.\n\nTTTBV supplied an integrated Vingtor Marine ACM and SPA system for the Neptune. Together, these systems take care of the internal communication and distribution of public address and general alarm. The crew placed high demands on the integrated communication system and are therefore well aware of the extensive possibilities that this system offers. Based on specific and additional needs of the crew, a number of upgrades of the system have already been carried out on board by TTT engineers on board.\n\nStemat Spirit\n\nThe 90m long service workboat vessel, the Stemat Spirit of Stemat Marine Services, has high accuracy due to its high-tech Dynamic Positioning System. In addition, due to her low draft, the ship can also reach far on the beach, with which she can perform cable work onshore. For laying the cable, the Stemat Spirit uses the Hi-plough technique, which means that the cable can be buried deeper. The Stemat Spirit was used in multiple wind farms in the United Kingdom. An example of this was the Walney Wind Farm, consisting of two parts, Walney 1 + 2. The Stemat Spirit has both parts equipped with cables.\n\nTTT supplied an integrated Vingtor Marine ACM and SPA system for the Stemat Spirit. Together, these systems take care of the internal communication and distribution of public address and general alarm. TTT engineers have also been on board on this ship several times to adapt the configuration of the system to the specific requirements of the job, which the ship would start shortly afterwards.\n\nGroene Hart Ziekenhuis\n\nAt the beginning of 2012, the foundations were laid for the new construction of the Groene Hart Hospital in Gouda. This new construction took place in phases: outpatient clinics moved step by step to the new location, followed by the Intensive Care department. During the new construction, many transit windows of MCT Brattberg, of the RGB type, were used in the foundations to guarantee the watertightness of entry points for cables and pipes.\n\nInstaller ULC Elektra BV from Utrecht has installed gas and watertight cables for this complete new-build project. The MCT transit products can be found in the crawl spaces and in the underground bicycle shed of the new hospital.\n\nVSF Verzepingsfabriek\n\nFor the saponification factory VSF Veenendaal of Dishman Netherlands BV, the old factory was demolished in one year and a new one was built at the same location. This was done with the help of their own staff, so that they did not have to lose their jobs during the production stop. Thanks to MCT Brattberg, the cables are safe, watertight, fire-retardant and gas-tight.\n\nTon Valkenburg, maintenance specialist at Dishman, indicated early in the construction process that installer TechTron Projecttechniek BV had to work with the safe transit products from MCT Brattberg. He wanted to be able to guarantee the safety of the factory in this ATEX environment. Theunissen Technical Trading BV in Malden supplied the RGB frames and the filler blocks. Dishman Netherlands BV is once again fully confident that the company will have watertight, fire-retardant and gas-tight penetrations in the coming decades. MCT Brattberg gives a 25-year warranty on the products.\n\nTriton knoll\n\nThe Triton Knoll Offshore Wind Farm reached an important milestone over the weekend, April 12, when the first of two Siemens Offshore Transformer Modules® (OTM) - the offshore substation platforms - were transported and installed.\n\nThe wind farm will be built about 32 km off the coast of Lincolnshire, England, with a potential capacity of 856 MW. The wind farm will provide approximately 800,000 households with green energy.\n\nThe MCT Brattberg transit systems used ensure an airtight and fireproof transit of the cables in the OTM modules. The cable transits also help to minimize maintenance. If no adjustments are made, they do not need to be looked after for at least 25 years.\n\nHoogspanningsstation Boxmeer\n\nThe demand for energy in Brabant is growing and continues to grow. In order not to stand in the way of this development, the 150KV Boxmeer high voltage substation has been expanded. Installer SPIE (engaged by client Tennet) used the E-MCT transit systems from MCT Brattberg. These products are comparable to the standard transit products, but they also offer protection against all forms of EMC. In addition to the standard MCT protection, E-MCT also offers protection against electromagnetic interference (EMI) and electromagnetic pulses (EMP). EMP means that circuit currents are generated around the cables.\n\nEspecially in distribution stations such as these, safety and control of EMC is desirable. When converting 150 kilovolts to lower values, many eddy currents are released. The cables, each leading 10KV from the switch room to the control room, can interfere with existing computer equipment due to these currents.\n\nBecause E-MCT is based on the standard transit system, E-MCT is also relatively easy to install and is a durable shielding. Thanks to the baffle in each E-MCT block, unwanted influences on the cable's earth screen and the circuit currents around the cables are directly led away to earth.\n\nPrinses Beatrixsluis\n\nThe Princess Beatrix lock is the most important direct waterway connection between the ports of Rotterdam and Amsterdam. It is the only lock complex on the route. Ships have grown in size in recent years. With the increasing number of ships, the waiting times for locks increased. The lock complex also became a bottleneck on the route. There is therefore an extension of the complex with a 3rd lock chamber. It is longer, wider and deeper than the 2 first chambers.\n\nThe renovation of the existing lock chambers was done immediately after the opening of the 3rd chamber in 2019. An important part of the renovation was the restoration of the original lock complex from 1938. By converting the historic former service houses, they are now used as operating rooms with the latest techniques. The old control building and the footbridge from the 1990s have been demolished. The white houses and the lifting towers are now, just as in 1938, the eye-catchers.\n\nTridens\n\nThe Seematz type 'ocean' wipers supplied by TTT are equipped with a control panel, which has a large number of features that guarantee the safety of the wiper in use. In addition to the standard functions such as two continuous speeds and interval control, the following functions are also integrated in the OCEAN type panels:\n\n• Grouping different wipers\n\n• At the touch of a button, all wipers turn on for one run\n\n• Heating in the windscreen wipers\n\n• Button for spraying water and blowing the line with compressed air\n\n• All LEDs on the panel are automatically dimmed at night\n\n• Additional functions such as window heating and CVS can be integrated into the panel\n\nTTT supplied for the Tridens\n\nPesch Seematz | Searchlights\n\nSea Recovery | Reverse osmosis watermaker\n\nJun Yang 1\n\nThe Jun Yang 1 (167.5 x 31 m) has a draft of 8.75 meters and is equipped with two suction pipes with which it is possible to dredge up to 90 meters. The deadweight capacity is 31,500 tons and when loaded the ship must be able to reach a speed of 16.3 knots. Accommodation is available on board for 31 crew members.\n\nWith a maximum hopper capacity of 21,028 m³, this is the largest hopper dredger that shipbuilder IHC has built to date for the Chinese dredging company GDC (CCCC Guangzhou Dredging Co.).\n\nTTT has supplied eleven Ocean type Seematz wipers for the Jun Yang 1, in order to be able to continue to operate with the simple but very reliable wipers in the toughest conditions.\n\nTTT leverde voor de Jun Yang 1\n\nPesch Seematz | Searchlights\n\nPesch Seematz | Window wipers\n\nGlamox Aqua Signal | Lighting\n\nVingtor Stentofon | Communication\n\nMCT Brattberg | Cable Transits\n\nSefarina\n\nThe Sefarina was the first seagoing ship that can run entirely on LNG. Sefarina's truck-to-ship bunkering counts as a test case for the safety procedures that must be observed when bunkering sea-going vessels. While bunkering of LNG has been possible in the port of Antwerp since 2012, this has until now only been used for inland vessels.\n\nThe Seematz window wipers supplied by TTT are extremely suitable for maritime shipping because the high quality of the parts ensures that the wipers continue to function in every type. For example, the wipers are used on ships in polar regions as well as in areas with a subtropical climate. The robust construction ensures that the Seematz wipers can continue to do their job under all circumstances.\n\nMinerva\n\nThe commissioning of the dredger 'Minerva' took place at the end of 2016, making it the first dredger equipped with dual fuel engines, together with DEME's other trailing suction hopper dredger \"Scheldt River\", which will be built and put into service around the same time.\n\nLike the Scheldt River, the Minerva is also built according to a 'green' design, which has led to both ships being provided with a Green Passport and a Clean Design notation. The ships will be equipped with dual fuel engines and LNG tanks to meet both ecological (stricter emission standards) and economic challenges (fluctuating oil prices).\n\nThe Minerva and the Scheldt River are both equipped with Seematz rectilinear wipers. The rectilinear wipers are not only strong and very durable, but also guarantee a maximum wiping surface, so that the view from the wheelhouse remains optimal even in bad weather conditions.\n\nNeptune\n\nTTT has supplied an integrated Vingtor Marine ACM and SPA system for the Neptune. These systems together ensure internal communication and distribution of public address and general alarm. The crew placed high demands on the integrated communication system and is therefore well aware of the extensive possibilities that this system offers. Based on specific and additional needs of the crew, a number of system upgrades have already been carried out on board by TTT engineers.\n\nHelios\n\nThe 152m megacutter HELIOS allows dredging to a depth of 35 metres, but also to a minimum dredging depth of 6 metres. This makes the ship suitable for making landfalls for pipelines, among other things. Cutters with two different heights can be used, which are able to cut very hard ground. The cutter power is between 4,200 and 7,000 kW, the pump power is 3 x 5,200 kW.\n\nFor the Helios, TTT supplied a series of OCEAN tagefa rectilinear wipers from the Seematz brand.\n\nTTT supplied for the Helios\n\nPesch Seematz | Window wipers\n\nPesch Seematz | Searchlights\n\nVingtor Stentofon | Communication\n\nJFJ de Nul\n\nCutter suction dredgers are stationary dredgers, which means that they do not 'sail' while dredging. During dredging, the ship remains in the same location because a spud pole is moved downwards from the ship, until it is firmly fixed in the seabed. Through the use of winches and anchors, the dredger swings sideways and the cutter head fragments and removes the soil.\n\nTTT has supplied Seematz wipers for the J.F.J de Nul, among other things. The 'Ocean' wipers can withstand the harshest weather conditions and come with a control panel that is equipped with a number of useful functions, such as self-grouping of wipers, single sweep and heating.\n\nMustang\n\nThe Mustang is a 30m long 85t tugboat which can accommodate 8 personnel. This is the first vessel to have a complete line of LED lanterns, Series 65, installed. This happened shortly after the introduction of this new product line, marketed by Glamox Aqua Signal and provided with a Wheelmark certificate. This certification was based on extensive tests and studies, many of which could be performed in the manufacturer's own laboratory. Glamox Aqua Signal has been the world's leading manufacturer of marine and offshore lighting since 1868.\n\nThe Mustang was also equipped by TTT with complete work lighting and two electrically operated searchlights.\n\nIsland discovery & Island aurora\n\nThe Island Class ferries are a series of battery-hybrid ferries from BC Ferries. The ferries are 81m long with a capacity of 47 cars and 450 passengers. The ships are equipped with batteries and designed to operate fully electrically. In addition, they are also equipped with hybrid technology that bridges the gap until on-shore charging infrastructure is available. In the design of the ferries, shipbuilder Damen took into account the reduction of both harmful emissions and underwater noise.\n\nFull (LED) lighting of the Glamox brand has been supplied for these battery-hybrid ships. The navigation lighting, better known under the brand name Aqua Signal, also falls under this. Installer Van der Leun is responsible for the electrical installation. The high-quality fixtures with a long lifespan and a 5-year manufacturer's warranty help to minimize maintenance. The cable transits from MCT Brattberg have also been used to safely feed and seal all cables. If nothing is adjusted and is installed correctly, this will no longer be necessary for 25 years.\n\nBlack Pearl\n\nThe 106 m sailing yacht, built at Oceanco with construction number Y712, the Black Pearl has an aluminum housing and can accommodate 12 guests. The sailing ship, equipped with 60 meter high masts, is currently the largest sailing yacht ever built in the Netherlands.\n\nDuring construction it was decided to install LED navigation lighting directly. In order to also be able to use the series 65 LED lanterns on luxury mega yachts, it is also possible to have the standard black housing completely finished in white. The appreciated quality and appearance ensure that many mega yachts are now equipped with series 65 LED lanterns from Glamox Aqua Signal. In addition to the navigation lighting, Glamox Aqua Signal was also chosen for a large part of the technical lighting on board this yacht.\n\nFor example, the yachts Rock.IT - Madame Gu – Kahalani – Lady Britt – Nirvana – Seven Seas – Lady Dee – Sea Owl – Tango are equipped with series 65 LED lanterns.\n\nSea Owl\n\nThe Sea Owl is a 62m motor yacht with space for 12 guests and 18 staff. Built in 2013, the ship has a very eccentric design, inspired by the stories of Peter Pan.\n\nThe modern ship has focused on luxury and the latest techniques on board from the start. In terms of lighting, the series 65 LED navigation lighting from Glamox Aqua Signal was chosen. Compared to conventional navigation and signaling lights, the Series 65 LED sets new standards in terms of service life, efficiency and reliability. Aqua Signal, founded in 1868 and started with navigation lighting, has now grown into an important player\n\nin the market for the total lighting program for shipping and offshore. As a world market leader, Glamox Aqua Signal was the first to supply a fully approved program of LED lanterns with wheelmark certificate.\n\nIn addition to the navigation lighting, Glamox Aqua Signal was also chosen for a large part of the technical lighting on board this yacht.\n\nQueen of the Netherlands\n\nThe 'Queen of the Netherlands' is a 230 m long trailing suction hopper dredger from Boskalis and has been used in salvage and dredging activities, including the investigation into the crash of Swissair Flight 111 and in the 'Port Phillip Channel deepening project (DCP)'. The 'Queen of the Netherlands' is also called the world's largest floating vacuum cleaner.\n\nFor the Queen of the Netherlands, Boskalis has chosen to replace the conventional incandescent navigation lights with the 65 series LED navigation lights. The 65 series navigation lights from Glamox Aqua Signal are now well known in the (Dutch) shipping industry. TTT has therefore included all lanterns from the 65 LED series in its own 'Holland Standard' and supplies them all directly from stock.\n\nHelios\n\nThe 152m long megacutter HELIOS can be dredged to a depth of 35 meters, with a minimum depth of 6 meters. That makes the ship suitable for the making of landings of pipelines. There can be used two cutters with different heights, which are able to cut extremely hard soil. The cutter capacity is between 4,200 and 7,000 kW,\n\nFor Helios TTT supplied a series of straight line wipers Seematz brand type OCEAN tagefa.\n\nTTT supplied for the Helios\n\nSeematz | Window Wipers\n\nSeematz | Searchlights\n\nVingtor Stentofon | Communication\n\nSanta Maria T\n\nWith a length of more than 36 meters, the Santa Maria T is the largest yacht built by Van der Valk to date. The Santa Maria T has a steel hull and aluminum inner structure and is the first of a new generation of designs created by Guido de Groot.\n\nAs a result of a well-thought-out hull design, the Santa Maria T can withstand the harshest weather conditions. Due to the large fuel capacity, the Santa Maria T has the range for a transatlantic crossing.\n\nThe Aqua Matic watermaker from Sea Recovery, supplied and installed by TTT, certainly contributes to the comfort with which this crossing can be made. Without worrying about (sufficient) clean drinking water on board, the Santa Maria T can sail and go where she wants.\n\nMiranda\n\nVan Laar Maritime owns and operates a growing fleet of 30 watch, tracking and (seismic) support vessels worldwide. The 'Miranda' is a 37m long multipurpose support vessel that sails under the flag of the Bahamas.\n\nTTT has supplied and commissioned an Aqua Matic watermaker for the Miranda, so that on board the always available drinking water can be used without any worries. With over 30 years of experience, Sea Recovery has become a world leader in the design and production of reverse osmosis watermakers.\n\nHeliad II\n\nThe Dutch-built 33-metre Heliad II offers luxurious accommodation for up to 12 guests, in a layout typically found on 45-metre superyachts. Her interior, as well as the outside deck, offer enough space to the guests for a very comfortable, stylish and luxurious stay on board. Designed by Diana Yacht Design, the Heliad II offers a bright, modern interior with light woods and natural light as the main ingredients.\n\nTTT has supplied two Reverse Osmosis watermakers and water disinfection systems for the Heliad II. A watermaker on board provides great freedom and few worries about clean (drinking) water on board. The local intake of bunker water, the quality of which can vary considerably depending on the location, has become completely unnecessary.\n\nDefender II\n\nDefender II is of the fast crew supplier 3307 type from Damen Shipyards. These ships of Dutch origin are deployed worldwide. One of the characteristics of a fast crew supplier is that the ship is built as light as possible. Bunkering water in bottles or tanks is therefore not desirable. Damen Shipyards consciously chose a watermaker from Sea Recovery.\n\nTTT has supplied and commissioned an Aqua Matic watermaker system for the Defender II. In addition to commissioning, TTT is also a partner for maintenance, repair and spare parts.\n\nOcean Warrior\n\n“It is fast, modern, economical and affordable. A real game changer” according to Adam Meyerson, captain of Ocean Warrior. “This is the fastest ship Sea Shepherd has ever owned. And that is necessary to keep up with the Japanese whalers.” The maximum speed is above 30 knots. Two thirds of the ship is taken up by the 4 engines, machinery and fuel storage, allowing the ship to stay at sea for 3 months without intermediate stops.\n\nBecause the Ocean Warrior is out for months at a time, often in the Antarctic Ocean, far from the mainland, and also because there is limited space on board, a Sea Recovery automatic watermaker is a perfect match for this vessel.\n\nTTT supplied the Aqua Matic watermaker and put it into operation itself. This ensures optimal functioning of the system with minimal maintenance of personnel during the trip.\n\nDudward Knowles\n\nThe “Durward Knowles” is a Damen Stan Patrol Vessel 4207, built for the Royal Bahamas Defense Force (RBDF) to protect its territorial waters. Since the Bahamas has no army or air force, the navy is the only form of military protection for the Bahamas. The Durward Knowles is one of the patrol vessels of the RBDF and carries out its mission as a defender of the Bahamas, protector of its territorial integrity as well as patrolling, providing aid in times of disaster and maintaining law and order in cooperation with other authorities in the Bahamas .\n\nTTT has supplied and commissioned an Aqua Matic watermaker system for the Duward Knowles. Due to a high reliability and relatively compact housing, the fully automatic Aqua Matic from Sea Recovery is very suitable for the waters of the Bahamas.\n\nJFJ de Nul\n\nCutter suction dredgers are stationary dredgers, which means that they do not 'sail' while dredging. During dredging, the ship remains in the same location because a spud pole is moved downwards from the ship, until it is firmly fixed in the seabed. Through the use of winches and anchors, the dredger swings sideways and the cutter head fragments and removes the soil.\n\nTTT has supplied Seematz wipers for the J.F.J de Nul, among other things. The 'Ocean' wipers can withstand the harshest weather conditions and come with a control panel that is equipped with a number of useful functions, such as self-grouping of wipers, single sweep and heating.\n\nBona Fide\n\nThe WR-289 is a 24m shrimp cutter made for the Dutch shrimp fishery in the North Sea. The Bona Fide WR-289 is the first shrimp cutter with a covered processing deck. On board, shrimps are already sorted according to size, packed/sealed and, if desired, frozen. This approach is an important innovation for shrimp fisheries.\n\nA 230V 115W LED searchlight was delivered from TTT, which is mounted in the front of the mast. This can be controlled from the wheelhouse by means of a control panel. By choosing an LED searchlight, the owner has some advantages over a conventional halogen searchlight. The LED searchlight is more resistant to vibrations, is very energy efficient and has a much longer life.\n\nRotra Vente\n\nThe Rotra Vente is 141 meters long and over 20 meters wide cargo vessel. The Rotra Vente is made for the windmill industry in the North Sea, with the main purpose of transporting turbine heads for windmills (and possibly rotor blades). The bow of the Rotra Vente has been specially designed to maximize the use of space for the transport of the windmill turbine heads. The specially developed bow is equipped with an extendable 'ramp' (ramp). Both the bow and the ramp are set in motion by means of hydraulic systems. This gives the ship the \"roll-on/roll off\" property: cargo can be driven on and off board.\n\nFor the Rotra Vente, TTT supplied 2x a 1000W Halogen searchlight with control panel and 1x a 450W Xenon. Searchlights are used, among other things, to illuminate the quay when the ship is mooring, in man overboard situations and to illuminate objects at a great distance.\n\nVox Maxima\n\nThe trailing suction hopper dredger Vox Maxima with a hopper capacity of 31,200 m3 was declared Ship of the Year in 2010. The jury awarded the prize because this largest dredger ever built in the Netherlands is very well thought out and has excellent transport efficiency. IHC Dredgers has succeeded in achieving a high ship speed with a large hopper capacity and thus a full ship shape.\n\nFor the Vox Maxima, TTT has an integrated communication system and linked SPA public address / general alarm system, consisting of an ACM telephone system. In addition, TTTBV also supplied a Vingtor Marine TETRA wireless communication system. This system is integrated in the ACM system and can therefore make use of many\n\nspecific properties of the ACM system.\n\nTTT supplied for the Vox Máxima\n\nPesch Seematz | Searchlights\n\nZenitel Vingtor | Integrated communication system\n\nZenitel Vingtor | ACM wireless communication system\n\nMCT Brattberg | Cable Transits\n\nHelios\n\nThe 152m megacutter HELIOS allows dredging to a depth of 35 metres, but also to a minimum dredging depth of 6 metres. This makes the ship suitable for making landfalls for pipelines, among other things. Cutters with two different heights can be used, which are able to cut very hard ground. The cutter power is between 4,200 and 7,000 kW, the pump power is 3 x 5,200 kW.\n\nTwo 450W Xenon searchlights have been supplied by TTT for the HELIOS, which are used in, for example, man overboard situations and to illuminate objects at a great distance.\n\nTTT supplied for the Helios\n\nPesch Seematz | Window wipers\n\nPesch Seematz | Searchlights\n\nVingtor Stentofon | Communication"
