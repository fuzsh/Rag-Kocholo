        "text": "[Congressional Record (Bound Edition), Volume 148 (2002), Part 17] [Issue] [Pages 22807-22936] [From the U.S. Government Publishing Office, www.gpo.gov] [[Page 22807]] SENATE--Monday, November 18, 2002 The Senate met at 11 a.m. and was called to order by the President pro tempore (Mr. Byrd). ______ prayer The Chaplain, Dr. Lloyd John Ogilvie, offered the following prayer: Jehovah-Shalom, You have promised us a peace that passes all understanding. That is the quality of peace we need today. It is beyond our understanding that You can produce serenity in our souls when there is so much that is unfinished, unresolved, and unforgiven in us, in our relationships, in our work, and in our society. Sometimes we even deny ourselves the calm confidence of Your peace because we are so aware of what denies Your peace in us. Take from us strain and stress as our anxious hearts confess our need for You. Grant us Your incomprehensible, but indispensable, palpable peace so that we can be peacemakers. Give the Senators a fresh infusion of Your peace so that they may deal with disagreements and discord in the legislative process. Help them overcome problems and endure the pressure of these days. In the name of the Prince of Peace. Amen. ____________________ PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The PRESIDENT pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. ____________________ RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved. ____________________ RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip, the Senator from Nevada, is recognized. ____________________ SCHEDULE Mr. REID. The Chair will shortly announce that we will be in a period of morning business until 12 noon today, under a previous order issued by the Senate. At noon, the Senate will consider the nomination of Dennis Shedd to be a circuit judge. The time on that debate is 6 hours. Upon the use or yielding back of that time, but not before 5:15 p.m., the Senate will vote on or in relation to that nomination. Following disposition of that nomination, the Senate will resume consideration of the Homeland Security Act. I don't know if there will be used the full 6 hours on the Shedd nomination. I really doubt it. I would hope that people would have the opportunity, if they choose, to come and talk about this most important vote we will have tomorrow on the amendment pending on H.R. 5005. This is very important. And of course, after the judge is voted on, there will be time this evening. There will be a very limited amount of time in the morning for people to speak. As the Presiding Officer has educated the entire country, including the Senate, this next series of votes is extremely important. ____________________ MORNING BUSINESS The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, as the Democratic whip has already stated, there will now be a period for the transaction of morning business not to extend beyond the hour of 12 noon, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that we are now in a period of morning business. I wanted to come to the floor to spend a couple of minutes speaking about those Senators who are leaving the Senate at the end of this session. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct. The Senate is in morning business, and the Senator is recognized for not to exceed 10 minutes. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO DEPARTING SENATORS Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate, for all of the notice it gets in the national press, is nonetheless still a family of sorts. We are 100 men and women who come to this fashion of public service from different points on the compass, from all across the country, and from different backgrounds--Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals. We work together a great part of the year in this Chamber, and we spend a lot of time in our respective States. We have become friends. Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, nonetheless, are close personal friends in many cases. We are going to be saying good-bye to a number of Senators this year. I wish to, before we complete our work this week, say a word about a number of those who will be leaving. I actually threatened last week, I say to the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, for example, to say a word about him. I will do that today in a moment. I will start with Senator Jean Carnahan, if I may. I went to Missouri to campaign with Jean Carnahan. She was here a relatively short time because she filled a seat that was then filled by a special election in the State of Missouri. But I believe the first moment I met Jean was at the organizing session. She had suffered a great tragedy. The State of Missouri had suffered a great tragedy. The incumbent Governor of the State of Missouri had died in a plane crash. The Governor, his son, and others perished in that crash relatively close to the election. His name remained on the ballot. The folks from the State of Missouri, nonetheless, voted for his name on the ballot, and the Governor appointed Jean Carnahan, his widow, to come to the Senate. Jean stood up at the organizing session--and I am sure she would not mind if I indicated this publicly because she did it in an organizing session--and she said to members of our caucus and to the new Members coming into the Senate: You come here because of your win. I have arrived here because of my loss. She, of course, was speaking about the tragedy that had occurred in the State of Missouri, her having lost a husband, then a candidate for the Senate, and her son in that plane crash. I watched Jean Carnahan as she worked in the Senate. She did a remarkable job. She is someone with great courage. She is someone who has the capability to stand up in a very significant way and explain quickly what it is she has a passion about in public policy. I deeply admire Jean Carnahan, not only for aspiring to carry out that mission of public service that was begun by her husband, the Governor of Missouri, but also because she played a significant role and contributed in a significant way in the Senate. We all will miss Jean Carnahan as she moves on to other challenges and other opportunities. [[Page 22808]] My colleague, Max Cleland from Georgia, will not be with us in the next session. He will be leaving at the end of this session as well. Max Cleland is one of those heroes of mine. Max Cleland is a brave, remarkable American. He left three of his limbs on a battlefield fighting for this country. He is a person of great personal courage. I say to anyone who has not yet done so, read his book, ``Going to the Max.'' It is a story of great inspiration. Max Cleland has been a terrific legislator, a great representative of the State of Georgia in the Senate. More than that, he has been an inspiration to virtually all America. Our country owes him a great debt of gratitude for his service. Our colleagues owe him a great debt of gratitude for his companionship and service in the Senate. We also will not be joined next year by Senator Torricelli who indicated his decision not to seek reelection. Let me say about Bob Torricelli, I served with him in the U.S. House of Representatives. He is a passionate fighter, articulate, strong, assertive for the issues in which he believes and for the issues he feels are important to his home State of New Jersey and for our country. On the Republican side, I came here not knowing Jesse Helms. I only knew of him by reputation. His reputation was he was a hard-edged, tough guy who asked no quarter, gave no quarter, and never stopped fighting for the issues about which he cared. He planted himself sometimes far off the political spectrum and said: Here is where I stand. That was my impression of him as I came to the Senate. What I discovered in the Senate is he is quite a remarkable gentleman, and I use the term ``gentleman'' in every respect. He is one of the most courteous, kind people with whom I have had the opportunity to serve. I have on occasion gone over and sat with him in the Chamber of the Senate and talked about the house he will retire to and the front porch on which he will spend some time. While we might disagree on some issues very strongly, he is a legislator who contributed substantially to the public debate in this country and often with great courage on his part. I certainly thank him for his service to our country. Senator Strom Thurmond will be leaving the Senate. If you know his personal story, you just are almost out of breath when you understand what he has done over his lifetime. He not only has served with great distinction in public service in many venues--as a judge in his home State, in the Senate, running for President, and so many other positions--he also volunteered for service during wartime at age 42 and volunteered to climb into a glider to crash land at night behind enemy lines. This is a man of great personal courage and a man who served this country with great distinction in many ways. I have had the opportunity over the years I have been in the Senate to serve with him as well and visit with him about his public service. I deeply admire what Senator Strom Thurmond has given to this country, and we wish him well. Senator Murkowski is someone with whom I have worked on the Energy Committee, both as a chairman of the Energy Committee and ranking member. He is now off to become Governor of the State of Alaska. He is someone with great passion for his State. Almost every amendment coming from Senator Murkowski has something to do with Alaska. I have enjoyed the opportunity to get to know Senator Murkowski. He is a man of good humor, but also someone who feels very strongly and passionately about issues. Senator Hutchinson I have not known quite as well, but Senator Hutchinson and his brother Asa, who served in the House of Representatives while Tim served in the Senate--their family, obviously, has a great passion for public service. I have enjoyed the opportunity to know him, although not quite as well as others. Senator Smith from New Hampshire is one with whom I had the opportunity to serve on the Ethics Committee. I have grown very fond of Bob Smith. He is a big, tall man with a great passion to serve his State and country. One of the qualities I discovered about him on issues that are very important, such as the issues we confronted on the Ethics Committee, is there was not a partisan bone in his body. But Bob Smith was about fairness and doing things the right way. I have become a friend of Bob Smith's. I like him a great deal. I wish him very well as he moves on from the Senate. Finally, Senator Gramm from Texas. I mentioned the other day he is someone who, if you are going to be in a big fight--a really big fight--you want with you. He not only is smart and shrewd, but he does not ever quit, no matter what the time is on the clock. While we have had our differences from time to time with regard to public policy, I have never had a difference with him on personal issues. He is someone I deeply admire. His service to our country through the Senate and the House is substantial. In fact, early on in our career, I sat next to him on the Veterans Affairs Committee in the U.S. House. That is when he was a Democrat, as a matter of fact. That is eons ago. Senator Gramm is one of those people who makes a significant contribution in this Chamber because he is determined to make that contribution and he knows the rules, he is shrewd, and he is tough. If you are in a fight, you want someone like Senator Gramm with you in a fight. Mr. President, having said all that about those who are leaving, let me say again the reason I came today to speak is because I care very deeply about this institution. I still pinch myself every day after 10 years serving in the Senate. When I drive to this Capitol Building, I pinch myself that a man from a town of 400 people and a high school class of 9 had the opportunity to be elected to the Senate. This is an extraordinary honor. This body of 100 men and women who come with different passions and different visions for our country offer America the patchwork quilt of what America is about in its deliberations and the development of ideas and the approaches by which we try to move America forward. I know from time to time, as do all of my colleagues, I leave this Chamber perhaps despondent about what happened that day, despondent that we did not get something done which I thought we should have done, or despondent that we did something I thought we should not have done. But over a long time, I remain enormously proud of the opportunities to serve in the Senate. It is a remarkable, unusual, distinct privilege to serve in the Senate. This institution is still the greatest deliberative body in the world, and my colleague, Senator Byrd, the Presiding Officer, the President pro tempore, reminds us always of the place in history this Senate occupies. I wish to say to all of those who are leaving this institution: It has been a great privilege to serve with each and every single one of them. Their presence has contributed to this institution in a very significant way. Mr. President, I yield the floor. PHIL GRAMM Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my good friend and distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Texas, Senator Phil Gramm. Senator Gramm was first elected to public office in 1978. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat for 4 years. After becoming disenchanted with the Democratic party, he resigned his seat in January of 1983 and ran again in a special election as a Republican. He won back his seat and earned a new found respect for the honorable way in which he changed parties. In 1984, Senator Gramm was elected to the United States Senate. An economist by training, Senator Gramm has spent his entire public career fighting for the principles of freedom, particularly economic freedom, individual choice and limited government. We all know well of his ``Dickey Flatt'' test. Dickey Flatt is a small businessman in Texas who has served [[Page 22809]] as Senator Gramm's bell-weather on the Federal Government's tax and regulatory policies. It is for the Dickey Flatts of this country that Senator Gramm has fought to cut Federal tax rates, repeal the death tax and reduce the government's regulatory burden on small businesses. We also have heard often of Senator Gramm's ``momma.'' It is for her and the other senior citizens of our country that Senator Gramm has worked hard to strengthen and modernize the Medicare and Social Security programs. Perhaps Senator Gramm's most important legislative accomplishments are the 1981 ``Gramm-Latta'' tax cut, the Gramm-Rudman- Hollings balanced budget bill and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Act. Equally as important as the legislation he has supported is the legislation that Senator Gramm has chosen to fight over the years. If a bill did not pass the Dickey Flatt test, you could be assured that Senator Gramm would oppose it. He is probably most famous for successfully leading the opposition in 1994 to then-President Clinton's proposal for a Federal takeover of the Nation's health care system. I have had the privilege of serving with the Senator from Texas on the Senate Finance Committee for the past 4 years. I have learned much from him and enjoyed listening to him debate the important issues before the Committee. Senator Gramm has a plain-spoken, common sense way of explaining issues that will be sorely missed in this body. Senator Gramm has served his State of Texas and this country with great distinction. He is a skilled debater and legislator, who has held true to his conservative principles over the years. I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to work with him during my tenure in the Senate, and to call him my friend. I wish him and his lovely wife Wendy the best in their future endeavors. Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my friend and colleague Phil Gramm, who retires from the Senate, but will not soon fade from the memories of all those who worked with him in this body. Very simply, Senator Gramm is a straight shooter, a man who has a strong grasp of the issues, and who never fails to speak his mind. While we disagreed a good deal on the issues, I have always had the utmost respect for Senator Gramm's opinion, and for the way that he has conducted himself throughout his service in the Senate. There have also been many times when we have seen eye to eye, and when we have it has been a pleasure to work with the Senator from Texas. Together we have fought to reform our budget process and cut wasteful spending. Now as my colleagues know, cutting spending or reforming the way that the government spends Federal tax dollars is never easy. But Senator Gramm and I share the belief that only by reforming our budget process will we ensure the kind of fiscal discipline in Congress that the American people deserve. While we were never able to bring our budget process reform bill to introduction, we stood shoulder-to-shoulder on many votes to cut pork- barrel spending and apply fiscal discipline. I thank Senator Gramm for his tremendous leadership on these critical issues, and I wish him all the best as he ends his distinguished career in the U.S. Senate. TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JESSE HELMS Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, with the end of the 107th Congress, we wish the best to Senator Jesse Helms, who retires after serving five terms here in the U.S. Senate. Senator Helms will be long remembered, by his colleagues and by history, for his legendary service to the people of North Carolina. From the day I arrived in the Senate, and throughout our service together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms has been unfailingly cordial to me, and that is something I have always greatly appreciated. While Senator Helms and I more often than not disagreed on the issues of the day, I appreciated the chance to work with him on issues where we were able to find common ground. Together we fought against unnecessary fast-track procedures that bind Congress's hands on trade legislation. I also joined with Senator Helms to try to ensure that the export laws took national security sufficiently into account, rather than merely bend to the largest business interests. Finally, I have been proud to work with Senator Helms to call attention to human rights abuses in China. So as he leaves the Senate, I thank Senator Helms for the chance to work together on these important issues. I join my colleagues in paying tribute to him, and in wishing him all the best for his retirement. TRIBUTE TO SENATOR FRED THOMPSON Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to Fred Thompson, a colleague and friend who has left a lasting legacy here in the Senate. Senator Thompson has served the people of Tennessee well, standing on principle time and time again. He has been a champion of campaign finance reform since he first came to the Senate in 1994. He was among the original co-sponsors of the first McCain-Feingold legislation, and he has been an invaluable ally ever since. I am deeply grateful to him for his longstanding and steadfast support for reform. Fred Thompson was a central part of our effort, from the first days, when gaining the support of such a fair-minded and well-respected member gave a tremendous boost to our efforts, through to some of our most critical moments, as when he skillfully negotiated an agreement on hard money limits that the vast majority of this body could support. Without that agreement, we simply could not have moved the McCain-Feingold bill through the Senate. I also want to pay special tribute to Senator Thompson for the work he did investigating the 1996 campaign finance scandals. Senator Thompson cut his political teeth on another great scandal in our Nation's history, but his work in 1997 showed the Nation that the campaign finance is truly a bipartisan problem with a bipartisan solution. I will greatly miss his leadership on these issues. I also joined with Senator Thompson to try to ensure that the export laws took national security sufficiently into account, rather than merely bend to the largest business interests. And finally, I want to thank Fred Thompson for his leadership on States' rights. Senator Thompson has consistently spoken out against Federal mandates that hinder, rather than help, States and localities as they work to serve America's communities. These are just a few of the many reasons that Fred Thompson's presence in this body will be missed. He has been a true champion on many important issues, and a champion for the people of his state. I thank him for his leadership and his friendship, and I wish him all the best as he ends this chapter of his career. tim hutchinson Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the election campaign in Arkansas this year which involved Tim Hutchinson and Mark Pryor put me in an awkward position. Former Senator David Pryor was one of my best friends when he was in the Senate. Tim Hutchinson has been a hard working, successful Senator who deserved to be reelected. The voters of Arkansas made their decision and Tim Hutchinson was not reelected. During his 6 years in the Senate, Tim was a forceful, articulate, and effective spokesman for the interests of his State. I observed him at close range, as a fellow member of the Agriculture Committee, speak out for the farmers of his State. He made sure the best programs possible were included in the farm bill last year for the rice, cotton, and soybean producers of his State. He gave particular attention to the interests of the aquaculture industry and the unfair efforts of the Vietnamese basa fish exporters to undermine years of catfish promotion efforts and market development success. In every instance when Tim Hutchinson argued for the interest of the citizens of his State, he did so with conviction and a seriousness of purpose that was very impressive to me. Another example which I recall that made me sit up and take notice was in [[Page 22810]] a nationally televised debate of the William Buckley show which was broadcast from the law school at the University of Mississippi. The subject was the United States-China relationship. The panel included Henry Kissinger, Jim Barksdale, my colleague Trent Lott, and the new Senator from Arkansas, Tim Hutchinson. I was surprised that the young Arkansas Senator not only held his own during this program, but he was the star. He made compelling arguments for his points of view; he knew the facts; and he expressed them in an articulate and persuasive manner. Tim Hutchinson has been a very fine Senator for the State of Arkansas. He has upheld the finest traditions of this body, and we will miss him. I wish him much success in the years ahead. Max Cleland Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my dear friend and departing colleague Senator Max Cleland. Thomas Jefferson once said that ``a nation that rests on the will of the people must also depend on individuals to support its institutions if it is to flourish. Persons qualified for public office should feel an obligation to make that contribution.'' Max Cleland heard that centuries old call to duty and answered with a lifetime of service. Senator Cleland's dedication to his country stretches from the battlefields of Vietnam to the floor of this Senate. And the families of Georgia, and our entire Nation, are better for his leadership. Senator Cleland nearly lost his life serving his country in Vietnam. He returned home with injuries so grave that he spent a year and a half in various Veterans Administration Hospitals recovering. But Senator Cleland then battled and beat a depression so deep that it would have broken the spirit of many others and embarked on a remarkable 30-year career of public service. He began by speaking out for better treatment for veterans, a cause he would champion throughout his career. Then at the age of 28, he was elected to become Georgia's youngest State Senator. In 1977, Senator Cleland was appointed head of the Veterans Administration by President Carter, making him the youngest Administrator in the agency's history. In 1982, Georgia voters elected him Secretary of State, again, the youngest ever. And in 1996, Senator Cleland was elected to the United States Senate where he became a champion on issues like veteran affairs, health care and protecting our Nation's parks and natural treasures. I think Jefferson would be proud to see that our Nation still produces such leaders as Senator Cleland whose entire life embodies the spirit of patriotism, civic duty and self-sacrifice that has shaped our Nation since its very founding. I hope Senator Cleland will continue to speak out on the issues he cares about so deeply because his voice is still needed. jean carnahan Mr. President, I rise to express my admiration and respect for my departing colleague, Senator Jean Carnahan. Senator Carnahan and I entered the Senate in the same freshman class and we served together on the Special Committee on Aging. I quickly came to appreciate Senator Carnahan's hard work on behalf of the people of Missouri and our Nation. Senator Carnahan was a leader in the fight to make prescription drugs more affordable. Senator Carnahan authored the ``Classroom Quality'' provision of the ``Leave No Child Behind Act'', which will give our local schools the ability to offer qualified teaching specialists to all students who need them. Senator Carnahan worked to save thousands of airline jobs in Missouri and across the Nation also provide relief for those workers who lost their jobs in the wake of the travel slowdown after 9-11. Senator Carnahan was one of the first legislators to go to Afghanistan to see for herself that our troops had all they needed in the fight against terrorism. And Senator Carnahan fought tirelessly to make sure Social Security and Medicare remain strong for our present seniors and the generations to come. While her tenure was brief, her legacy will be long. But, beyond admiring her skills as a legislator, I came to appreciate Senator Carnahan's sincere warmth, quiet humor and inner strength. We are all too keenly aware that Senator Carnahan came to the Senate in the wake of the tragic plane crash that killed her husband, Governor Mel Carnahan, and her oldest son Randy. But Senator Carnahan turned the grief over her family's loss into a legacy of gains for families in Missouri and our Nation. Senator Carnahan was truly a fitting heir to the Senate seat once held by Harry Truman and I hope she will continue to speak out on the issues she cared about so deeply. Her voice will still be needed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized. Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of paying tribute to our colleagues who are leaving the Senate. There are some 10 of our colleagues who are leaving under various circumstances. I would like to speak about them and to express my deep appreciation for their friendship, for the years we have worked together, or opposed each other, as the case may be, on various matters that have come before this body. Mr. President, of course, we all have great affection for Senator Thurmond, who has served here for 54 years and is on the brink of celebrating his 100th birthday--a remarkable achievement in and of itself. As someone once said, if they had known they would have lived that long, they would have taken better care of themselves. And Strom Thurmond took very good care of himself over the years. Senator Max Cleland, a remarkable person, has served here for only 6 years, representing the State of Georgia. He has done a remarkable job during his years here. But he has had a distinguished record, of course, that has accumulated prior to his arrival in the Senate. Senator Jesse Helms, with whom I have served on the Foreign Relations Committee for my entire service, my 22 years in the Senate. He has served for 30 years here. We have been the best of colleagues serving together. Senator Bob Torricelli of New Jersey; Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, with whom I have served on the Banking Committee; Senator Jean Carnahan, who has had a brief service here but has done a wonderful job representing the State of Missouri; Senator Frank Murkowski, with whom I was elected to the Senate 22 years ago; Senator Fred Thompson from the State of Tennessee; Senator Bob Smith; Senator Tim Hutchinson-- these are the 10 Members who are leaving. Strom Thurmond Mr. President, regarding Senator Thurmond, I spoke back a number of weeks ago about Senator Thurmond in our wonderful tribute to him. He is truly an institution within this institution. I have known Senator Thurmond since I was very young. My father and he served together here for 12 years. I have served with him for 22 years. So for 34 years Senator Thurmond has had to serve with a Dodd in the U.S. Senate of his 54 years. I know of no one who has had as varied and as distinguished a career in public service. When you think of his contribution as an educator, as a Governor, as a combat war veteran--and not young at the time of D- Day, I might add, but nonetheless showed great heroism--and serving, as I mentioned, as a Governor of his State, and, of course, in the Senate for so many years, and as a judge--truly a remarkable individual--and elected to the Senate under various banners over the years--as a Democrat, as a Dixiecrat, as a Republican, as a write-in candidate-- truly a remarkable achievement. I've heard it suggested that they might have to rename the State of [[Page 22811]] South Carolina; there have been so many monuments to his public service. There are schools, roads, bridges, parks all through the State of South Carolina that bear the name of Strom Thurmond. That is because, of course, he is held with such incredible affection by the people of that State. We have had our differences on substantive matters, but he has always been a tremendous gentleman and a wonderful friend. He is a good friend to my family as well. I wanted to take a couple minutes to say thank you to a remarkable individual, a remarkable American. I know that he has great affection for this institution and its Members. I wish him the very best of health and, I want him to know we will all miss him very much. Max Cleland I also want to pay tribute to our colleague from Georgia, Max Cleland. I know very few people who have as many heroic qualities as Max Cleland does. It is not by pure circumstance that I mention Strom Thurmond and Max Cleland next to each other. I mentioned the fact that Strom Thurmond served his country with great distinction in military service during World War II. Max Cleland, of course, served his Nation with great distinction during the Vietnam conflict and, of course, paid a terrible price for that service. Just a month shy of completing his tour of duty, he suffered the terrible loss of both legs and an arm. Yet despite those physical injuries, and the obstacles they presented, Max Cleland has made a remarkable contribution to this institution, to the people of his home state of Georgia. Max Cleland is truly an American hero, not just because he wore the uniform of the United States and served in combat and suffered a terrible loss. He is an American hero because of his willingness and desire to serve the people of his country in a continuing fashion beyond that of a military uniform. He has done so in the State of Georgia, holding office there as well as here in the Senate. I don't know of anyone who is held in such a high regard and with such respect by all of us as Max Cleland. One of Senator Cleland's favorite poets, William Butler Yeats, once wrote: ``Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart.'' In the case of Max Cleland, his enormous sacrifice to his country only emboldened his golden nature, and increased his desire to dedicate himself to improving the lives of others. I will miss him very much. When the 108th Congress convenes, it just won't seem quite right that Max Cleland is not among us--he has a wonderful sense of humor, a great sense of history, a great love of his country. I deeply regret the people of Georgia didn't see fit to send him back to serve with us. I don't know his successor. I am sure he is a fine person. I am sure he won't mind if I say I am going to miss Max very much, but I know I have a lifelong friend in Max Cleland. Just prior to coming back to Washington, it was announced that Max and Nancy are going to be wed. My wife Jackie and I wish both of them the best in the years ahead. Jesse Helms I also want to pay tribute to my friend and colleague from North Carolina, Senator Jesse Helms. I don't know of anyone here I probably disagreed with more over the past 22 years than Jesse Helms. But I also don't know of anyone with whom I have had a better relationship over the last 22 years. I know that sounds somewhat of a contradiction to people who watch this institution, that people with whom you can have profound and significant disagreements can also be people you hold in high regard and respect. Senator Jesse Helms and I have fought tooth and nail on almost every issue I can think of. But I don't know of a finer gentleman, a more decent human being than Jesse Helms. And we have disagreed on policy matters over and over again--he is a passionate conservative, his voting record has scored a 100 percent rating from American Conservative Union throughout his 30 years here, and he is deeply proud of the fact that during those years he has one of the highest voting records of loyalty to the Republican Party, in excess of 95 percent. It is that passion which I admire. We don't have enough of it in politics today, in my view. And while I wish we had more of it on our side, I respect it when I see it in anyone. Jesse Helms certainly brings it to his public service. I will miss his service here. I will miss working with him. There were many occasions when we actually did find common ground, as we do so frequently here, on matters that don't achieve the high profile status as matters of disagreement do. He served his State of North Carolina well. He served and represented a point of view embraced by many. I will miss him on a personal level as a kind and thoughtful individual. Jackie and I wish he and Dot the very best in the years to come. Bob Torricelli Mr. President, Robert Torricelli is leaving the Senate. He made the decision this fall not to seek reelection in the midst of his election. A lot of attention has been focused on that decision, but for those us of who have known Bob Torricelli over his 20 years of public service-- 14 years in the House, 6 years in the Senate--Bob Torricelli is a lot more than an individual who decided to pull out of a race in New Jersey this year. He is a passionate fighter for things he believes and he has compiled a wonderful record of public service. I want the Record to reflect that Bob Torricelli was a fine Senator, a fine Member of Congress. He fought very hard on behalf of his constituents, fought very hard on the issues he cared deeply about. We had our disagreements over Cuban policy frequently. I always used to say, when Bob Torricelli came to the floor to take the other side, he was a formidable opponent. He was an excellent debater, one who embraced his views with a great deal of knowledge and a great deal of passion and feeling. He became active in Democratic Party politics at an early age. His passion for politics is something all of us came to appreciate in the Senate during his years. He was elected to the House at age 31 in 1982. He did a tremendous job there, serving on the House International Relations Committee, and rose to prominence as a House member, as a leading voice for advancing and expanding democracy and human rights worldwide. In 1996, he came to the Senate. His efforts on behalf of tax, employment, environmental, education, and health issues are things we are all well aware of. He has wonderful legislative skills and was a great battler on behalf of the Democratic Party. He led the Senate Democratic campaign committee during his first term in a cycle during which he raised a lot of money to support Democratic candidates across the country. It is a thankless job. But for those of us who stand for election or reelection, you have to have someone who will head up these committees and do so with a great deal of energy. Bob Torricelli certainly did that for a lot of people whose careers might have been terminated more briefly had it not been for his dedication to seeing to it that Democratic candidates would have a good chance to be heard. I would not want this session to end without expressing my gratitude to Bob Torricelli for his service in this body and his service to the people of New Jersey. Phil Gramm Mr. President, Phil Gramm is also leaving the Senate, going to work for UBS Warburg. Their offices are in Connecticut, so I will be looking forward, very carefully, at what Phil Gramm does as a new part-time constituent of mine. I say that somewhat facetiously of course. Phil Gramm has had a very distinguished career in public life. We have served together on the Banking Committee during his entire time in the Senate. We have worked together very closely on matters affecting the securities industry. We coauthored a number of bills together during our joint service. We were elected to the House together. Phil was a Democrat in those days, then became a Republican, was elected to the Senate as a Republican. [[Page 22812]] He has authored major pieces of legislation during his career. In fact, the Brookings Institution listed three of the bills that Phil Gramm authored or coauthored as among a handful of the most significant pieces of legislation in the 20th century, including the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget proposal which attracted a wide degree of attention during the 1980s. He made a mark here as a tenacious fighter for what he believes in. One of the most difficult opponents you could have on an issue is Phil Gramm. He doesn't take many prisoners, and he fights very hard for the matters in which he believes. I thank him for his service and wish him well in the years ahead. Jean Carnahan Mr. President, I want to mention Jean Carnahan, who had a short service in this body. All of us have a deep appreciation for the circumstances under which she arrived--one of the most tragic set of circumstances any of us can imagine. She did a remarkable job, coming in under difficult circumstances, and we owe her a debt of gratitude for the courageous and selfless service that she provided to the people of Missouri, the American public, and the sense of silent grace with which she handled those personal difficulties. She didn't just simply show up in the Senate--she thrived here. All of our colleagues would agree when I say that learning to navigate the ways of the Senate can be difficult for anybody, but for somebody who never served in public office, having, of course, been the first lady of her State of Missouri for 8 years, Jean Carnahan did a remarkable job during her time here. She made a difference on numerous pieces of legislation in which she helped to forge compromises. While her tenure may have been brief, she left a mark worthy of those with much longer service. All of us express nothing but our very best wishes to Jean Carnahan and to her family in the coming years. She has become a good friend to us here. I thank her for her service, and I am sure she will find other ways to contribute and provide services for the people of this country. Frank Murkowski Frank Murkowski and I were elected to the Senate together in 1980. He has now been elected Governor to the State of Alaska. He is moving on to other areas of public service. He has done a very fine job here and has made a significant contribution representing the people of Alaska. He had a successful career as a businessman in Alaska before coming to the Senate. He was President of the Alaska National Bank from 1970 to 1980. Since his arrival here, he has kept Alaska first and foremost in his mind. He has been an extraordinary defender of Alaska's interests. But he made many contributions, as well, to the national agenda. In fact, many of his biggest fights have greatly benefitted our Nation as a whole. In 1996, for example, Frank Murkowski led the congressional effort to pass the omnibus parks bill, which created or improved more than 100 national parks, forests, preserves and historic sites nationwide, including two in Alaska. And, for more than 25 years, Frank and his wife, Nancy, have been leaders in the fight against breast cancer in rural Alaska, and other areas where access to early testing is severely lacking. He also led a national effort against breast cancer here in Washington, and has been an integral part of securing increased Federal funding for breast cancer research and treatment nationwide. He has been a passionate advocate of oil and gas exploration in Alaska--one of the major debates in this body. I disagreed with Frank Murkowski about allowing drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but he certainly fought very hard on behalf of his beliefs, showing up with charts and graphs and pictures of wildlife and the like, day after day during that debate. The people of Alaska have now elected him as their Governor. I know all of us wish he and his wife Nancy well as they assume new responsibilities in Juneau, Alaska. Fred Thompson Mr. President, I pay tribute to and express my gratitude to Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, as well, for his service here. He has made a significant contribution to public life during his years here in the Senate, as well as prior to arriving here. Fred's career in politics has truly been one of life imitating art imitating life. How else can you describe a man who can be seen on the Senate floor debating, only to see him later that evening playing a district attorney on the television show ``Law and Order''? On just about any given Sunday, you can catch Fred Thompson on cable in a rerun of ``Die Hard II,'' or ``The Hunt for Red October.'' So he has had a distinguished career in film and television, also. But to suggest that was the sum total of Fred Thompson's life would be a tragic mistake. There is a lot more to it. He has made significant contributions in real life for over 30 years. He did serve as an assistant U.S. attorney at one point in his life. He has been a prominent public figure during some of the most critical moments in our Nation's history--not only as chairman of the Governmental Relations Committee, but also during the Watergate crisis in the early 1970s. Fred Thompson was just a few years out of Vanderbilt Law School when he was named minority counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee in 1973. He has been commended on many occasions for his role in the public disclosure of the Oval Office audio tapes, and that deserves mention here again today. Fred Thompson's early impact on the American political scene foreshadowed his later career and success in the Senate, and his ever- growing popularity in Tennessee. In 1994, he was elected by the people of that State to fill the seat left vacant by the election of Senator Al Gore as Vice-President. When he was voted in for a full Senate term in 1996, he received the highest number of votes cast for any candidate for any office in Tennessee history. Fred Thompson has compiled a distinguished career over the years, as I mentioned earlier, as an assistant U.S. attorney, as Watergate counsel and, of course, during his years in the Senate. We are going to miss him here. He and his wife Geri, I am sure, are going to have a bright future, and I have a feeling we will be hearing more about Fred Thompson in the years to come. Robert Smith Mr. President, Bob Smith from New Hampshire is also leaving the Senate. While, again, we have been on not only different sides of the aisle but on the different sides of many, if not most, issues that come before the Senate, I thank Bob Smith for his service to his State of New Hampshire and to the causes which he embraced very firmly. Bob Smith is a very conservative Member of this body. He has also become a leading advocate, during his latter years of service, on environmental questions affecting not only the State of New Hampshire, but also environmental issues across the country, including his work on helping to clean up and restore the Florida Everglades. He opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge despite strong support from the Bush administration and Senator Frank Murkowski. So Bob Smith was more diverse in his views than some might have otherwise believed. Again, I thank him for his service. We didn't agree on many substantive issues that came before this body, but he was a passionate fighter for views he held. My wife Jackie and I wish him and his wife Jo Ann all the best in the future. tim hutchinson Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend and colleague, Senator Tim Hutchinson, who will be leaving the United States Senate at the conclusion of the 107th Congress. Although Senator Hutchinson and I have not agreed on every issue that has come before us, I have always considered him a friend, and I have always respected his convictions. He has certainly served as a capable and loyal advocate for the people of his home state of Arkansas. Mr. President, I had the good fortune of getting to know Tim Hutchinson [[Page 22813]] very well during his six years in the Senate. We served together on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. And, in 2000, Senator Hutchinson and I co-founded the Senate Biotechnology Caucus, which has played an important role in educating Members of Congress and the public about recent developments in medical and genetic research. Throughout his 10 years in Washington--4 years in the House of Representatives and 6 here in the Senate--Tim Hutchinson has shown a deep commitment to improving the education of America's children, strengthening our national security, increasing access to healthcare, and safeguarding the often overlooked interests of rural America. Given his background, these priorities are not surprising. Tim Hutchinson himself was born on a small farm in rural Gravette, Arkansas. And he was educated as a minister at Bob Jones University in South Carolina. After graduating from college, he returned to Gravette, where he opened a Christian day school and taught history at nearby John Brown University. I have always believed that his background as an educator made Senator Hutchinson one of the most thoughtful and well-spoken members of this body. Tim Hutchinson's election to the Senate in 1996 was the culmination of a 10-year political evolution, which began with his election to the Arkansas Statehouse in 1985. While there, he gained a state-wide reputation as a tireless advocate of law enforcement. Tim Hutchinson was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1993, and in 1996 he became the first Republican in Arkansas history to win a popular election to the Senate. As a Senator Tim Hutchinson remained a committed advocate for conservative causes--consistently scoring over 90 percent for his voting record by the American Conservative Union. However, there were also several instances when Senator Hutchinson took the lead on important issues that crossed party lines. For example, he has always had an interest in improving public education in America, and was an integral part of the effort to create tax free education savings accounts. And, during the 107th Congress, Senator Hutchinson introduced the Nurse Employment and Education Development Act--a landmark piece of bi- partisan legislation to address the critical nursing shortage affecting rural Arkansas and the country as a whole. This year, the NEED Act was incorporated into the Nurse Reinvestment Act, which President Bush recently signed into law. This legislation stands as a fitting coda to Tim Hutchinson's tenure in the U.S. Senate--its positive impact will be felt across America for years to come. Mr. President, I will miss having Tim Hutchinson as a colleague. My wife Jackie and I wish him and his wife Randy, all the best in future year. I thank all 10 of these Members for their friendship. I look forward to seeing them in the years ahead, and I wish them and their families the very best in the years that come down the road. FRED THOMPSON Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to recognize my friend the Senior Senator from Tennessee. Fred Thompson will retire this year after eight distinguished years in the Senate. He has packed a great deal in those eight years. He has been a forceful leader who has made significant contributions to our country in a short amount time. Senator Thompson was born and raised in Lawrenceburg, TN, a little town sited by the great frontiersman and Congressman Davy Crockett. Like Crockett, Senator Thompson charted a path in life that has allowed him to use his character and great abilities for interests larger than himself. He received his undergraduate degree from Memphis State University and completed his law degree at Vanderbilt University in 1967. In 1973 and '74, Senator Thompson served as minority counsel to the vice chairman of the Senate Watergate Committee, his mentor, Senator, now Ambassador, Howard Baker. He served as Special Counsel to both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Senator Thompson is among the most junior Senators in the history of the Senate to have ever served as Chairman of a Standing Senate Committee. But Senator Thompson's skills and talents go far beyond his contributions to the Senate. He is also a very fine actor, not withstanding Senator McCain's critiques of his performances. He has an expansive list of movie and television roles that highlight his commanding presence and impressive style. We will continue to enjoy seeing him shine in his renewed acting career. He's had excellent real life practice in the Senate. We will miss Fred Thompson. We will miss his common sense, sharp wit and decency. All of his friends in the Senate wish Fred and his new bride, Jeri, all the best in their new lives together. I am proud to have served with him. PHIL GRAMM Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Senior Senator from Texas. Senator Phil Gramm will retire this year after 24 distinguished years in the U.S. Congress, three terms in the House and three terms in the Senate. He will be missed. Thirty-five years ago Senator Gramm received his Ph.D in Economics from the University of Georgia. After his time in Georgia, Senator Gramm began his college teaching career at Texas A &M University as an Assistant Professor of Economics in 1967. By 1973, he became the youngest Full Professor in the history of the Texas A&M Economics Department. His grasp and understanding of economics have been important factors in our Congressional debate and government policy over the last twenty-four years. I have had the privilege to serve with Senator Gramm on both the Senate Banking and Budget Committees. I have seen first hand the power of his intellect and grasp of the issues that have advanced free trade and strengthened our economy and the foundation of our democracy. His contributions to our country are many. He authored numerous major pieces of legislation during his career--and none more important than the Gramm/Rudman/Hollings Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act and the Gramm/Leach/Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act. All of his friends in the Senate wish Wendy and Phil much success as he takes on new responsibilities. He will now have more time to help R.C. Slocum coach the A&M Aggies. The Congress and America are stronger today for Senator Gramm having served in Congress. I am proud to have served with him. MAX CLELAND Mr. President, I rise to recognize my longtime friend the Senior Senator from Georgia. Max Cleland and I arrived in the Senate together in 1997. He quickly became a respected U.S. Senator. Max Cleland has been a role model for many people over the years. And, his years of selfless public service have made America a better and stronger nation. Senator Cleland joined the Army ROTC program at Stetson University in Florida and went on to earn a Masters Degree in American History from Emory University as a commissioned Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army. In 1967 he volunteered for service in Vietnam. The next year he was promoted to the rank of Captain and soon after he was seriously wounded losing both his legs and his right arm. Senator Cleland's determination and spirit turned his experience in Vietnam into a continuing passion for interests greater than his own. His service in Vietnam further motivated him to continue to help shape America. At the age of 28, he won a seat in the Georgia State Senate making him the youngest member and the only Vietnam veteran in that legislative body at that time. Seven years later, President Jimmy Carter appointed him Administrator of the U.S. Veterans' Administration. He was the youngest VA Administrator ever and the first veteran of Vietnam in that post. In 1982, he became the youngest Georgia Secretary of State and held that position for three terms until he began his campaign for the United States Senate in 1995. [[Page 22814]] Senator Cleland is an inspiration to all of us. We will miss his honesty, integrity, spirit and leadership in this body. We wish him well and thank him for his service and contributions to our country. I am privileged and proud to have served in the Senate with my friend and colleague Max Cleland. I salute you, Captain. You will be missed. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Who seeks recognition? The Senator from Missouri, Mrs. Carnahan. Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind and generous remarks. ____________________ FAREWELL TO THE SENATE Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, today I am reminded that 2 years ago when I came to the Senate, it was with a heavy heart. Life had not turned out the way it was supposed to. My husband, not I, was supposed to have been sworn in to the Senate, and I was to be seated in the gallery, beaming with delight at the shared victory we had won. As someone has pointed out, life is not the way it is supposed to be. Life is the way it is, and it is the way we cope with it that makes a difference. I had some difficult lessons to learn in that regard. It was not by chance when I stepped down from the dais, after being sworn in, that the first to welcome me was Senator Joe Biden. He had come to this Chamber many years ago after a tragic loss in his own life. He told me the story of having been greeted by Senator McClellan of Arkansas, who looked him in the eye and said: Work, hard work, it is the sure path to healing. Senator Biden said: I thought at the time how callous that advice was; he just does not understand the hurt I am feeling. He later found out Senator McClellan spoke from having experienced a family tragedy of overwhelming proportion. Joe Biden took the advice to heart and he passed it on to me. You were right, Joe, and I thank you for that wisdom. There has been much work to throw ourselves into during the 107th Congress. It has been a monumental period in our Nation's history, a time marred by unprecedented national tragedy, deep political divisions, economic upheavals, corporate corruption, continued threats to our national security, and now the gathering clouds of war. Through all of these disasters, we have seen the triumph of the American spirit. Yes, Americans have taken to heart the advice Louis Pasteur once gave to a group of young people. He said: Do not let yourselves be discouraged by the sadness of certain hours which passes over nations. Thankfully, the Congress has refused to be discouraged. We have endured anthrax attacks, dismantled offices, tighter security measures, major alterations to the Capitol complex, not to mention three shifts in legislative leadership. Through it all, we have managed to address a number of important issues. We passed a historic tax cut, reformed education, overhauled campaign finance laws, called corporate America to a higher standard, and prepared our Nation to respond to global terrorism. We have found that being the guardian of freedom is a relentless and consuming work. The immensity of our task would cripple a lesser people. Rather than be cowered by events, America and her institutions have always been emboldened during times of crisis. I am convinced the Author of Liberty, who has blessed and protected our Nation in the past, will enable us to meet the stern responsibilities of the present. As the 108th Congress takes on this new burden, I will not be among them but my prayers will be with them. I leave realizing that to have served in the Senate for even a short while is an honor afforded very few in their lifetime. I am forever grateful to the people of Missouri who have allowed me and my family to serve them for three generations. Reporters often ask me to reflect on those years. Most recently, I was asked what impressed me most during my time in the Senate. And I replied it was the diligence beyond duty shown by all who are part of this Chamber--Democrats, Republicans, and independents. Staff, parliamentarians, clerks, pages, security officers, maintenance workers, elevator operators, all spend long hours serving America. For the most part, their names, their selfless deeds will go unrecorded, but their life and work demonstrate a deep devotion to duty. In recognition of the loyalty and exemplary work of my own staff, I ask unanimous consent to have their names printed in the Record at the close of my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See exhibit 1.) Mrs. CARNAHAN. At this time I recognize sadly that two great towers of strength will be missed in this Chamber. My friend and colleague, Max Cleland, from his wheelchair stands taller than most men ever will. The Senate will be greatly diminished by his absence. And that we will no longer hear the spirited voice of Paul Wellstone summoning us to stand up and fight will likewise diminish the fervor of this body. Our Nation and my party have been further blessed by the courageous leadership of Senator Daschle and Senator Harry Reid. They have shown the grace under pressure that marks true greatness. I would be remiss if I did not mention the women of the Senate whose friendship has blessed and brightened my life. I am grateful, too, for the wholehearted and unwavering support of my Democratic colleagues in my every endeavor, and I especially appreciate those from the other side of the aisle, though far fewer in number, who graciously encouraged me as well. Tradition affords those of us who leave the Senate, either by our own will or the will of the electorate, the opportunity to reflect on the time in this historic Chamber, to perhaps even engage in some unsolicited advice. I could not pass up that opportunity. My advice comes not as a seasoned insider but as one who came for a season to serve among my colleagues. Mine are simple maxims that spring from the heart, a heart filled with love for the Senate and for my country. First, when my colleagues think on the role of government, seek a balance. Seek a balance between one that does everything and one that does nothing. And where there is talk of war, let there be the free and open debate that becomes our great Nation. And when there are judges to be appointed, let them be selected for their temperament and jurisprudence and not for political ideology that satisfies a special interest group. When we lay out our energy and environment policy, let it not be for short-term gain but for the well-being of our grandchildren and the survival of our planet. And when my colleagues speak of leaving no child behind, let that not be a mantra but a mission, fervent and funded. When health care is thought about, the health care needs of children, family, and seniors--and I hope that will be often--I urge my colleagues to lay aside partisanship and heed the plight of the hurting and the helpless in our society. I will vote for the homeland bill, as I have each step of the way, for we must make certain the information disconnect that allowed a 9/11 to occur never happens again. During an earlier global conflict, President Roosevelt called for stout hearts and strong arms with which to strike mighty blows for freedom and truth. Well, that is what I am hoping this consolidation and coordination of effort will help us to accomplish. As I vote for this bill, I do so with a caution. The pursuit of terrorists and the protection of basic freedoms will be our greatest challenge in the years ahead. In the quest to uproot terrorism, let us take care to preserve those precious liberties upon which our Nation is founded and upon which democracy depends. I have no doubt that in this good and godly work we will ultimately succeed. Let me conclude by saying that this farewell to the Senate is a bittersweet moment for me, one that churns up a mixture of memories and emotions. One such memory was of a visit I made [[Page 22815]] to the Corcoran Art Gallery to see the Jackie Kennedy exhibit. One of the displays was a handwritten letter that Mrs. Kennedy sent to a friend after completing an extensive project at the White House. She wrote: How sad it is . . . when a work we love doing . . . is finally finished. I know how she felt. I still believe, as did my husband, that public service is a good and noble work worthy of our lives. Perhaps a former Member of this Chamber said it best. He was not of my party, but he certainly was of my principles. Senator Lowell Weicker wrote: For all the licks anyone takes by choosing public service, . . . there is the elation of having achieved for good purpose what none thought possible. And such feelings far exceed . . . whatever the hurt . . . for having tasted the battle. I yield the floor.

The Senator gave the most eloquent statement. I can't say how much I appreciated being here. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. BYRD. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ ORDER OF PROCEDURE Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have a series of parliamentary inquiries. As I understand the situation on tomorrow, Tuesday, there will be 90 minutes of debate before a vote occurs at 10:30; during that 90 minutes of debate there will be 30 minutes under the control of Mr. Lott, 30 minutes under the control of Mr. Daschle, and 30 minutes under the control of Mr. Byrd; is that correct? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, at 10:30 it is my understanding--and I would like to inquire if I am correct in my understanding--the first vote will occur on the Daschle-Lieberman second-degree amendment No. 4953; a second vote will occur on the Daschle-Lieberman first-degree amendment No. 4911; a third vote will occur on the Thompson substitute, House bill No. 4901; the fourth vote will occur on cloture on H.R. 5005; am I correct? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair but let me continue. As I understand it, the Thompson substitute, House bill No. 4901, that is the substitute which was passed by the House of Representatives, sent to the Senate, and called up and laid before the Senate. That is the bill which first saw the light of day in the Senate, as I understand it, on or about the early morning hours of this last Wednesday, this past Wednesday of last week. Is that the amendment, the Thompson substitute amendment, that is the House bill which I, on a number of occasions, have referred to as being a bill of 484 pages? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment does contain that number of pages. Mr. BYRD. I just wanted to be sure to establish in my own mind and call to the Senate's attention that that will be the third vote, then, on that bill as we come to tomorrow morning, Tuesday of this week. Now, Mr. President, a further parliamentary inquiry: Am I correct in stating that cloture on the bill, H.R. 5005, is not vitiated by question of the adoption of the substitute? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture on the bill is not vitiated by that action. Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Further parliamentary inquiry: Is it not a fact that if cloture is invoked on H.R. 5005, under the rule, 30 hours then will ensue under that cloture measure? If cloture is invoked, there will be 30 hours on H.R. 5005, am I correct? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture under this consideration is 30 hours. Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. In this instance, if the Thompson substitute, the House bill No. 4901, if that substitute is adopted and cloture then is invoked on H.R. 5005, will amendments be in order during those 30 hours? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The adoption of the Thompson substitute precludes amendments. Mr. BYRD. I thought that was the case. The adoption of the Thompson substitute means as far as further amendments are concerned, the ball game is over; am I correct in putting it in that form? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Mr. BYRD. I say all that, Mr. President, to say this: On last Friday when the Senate invoked cloture, what was cloture invoked on, may I ask of the Chair? On what did the Senate then invoke cloture? I see my loss of memory is not too bad after all. It seems to be shared by others. Of course, I am 85--almost. The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are checking the record. Mr. BYRD. I say that with all respect, due respect and ample respect to the Chair, the Parliamentarian, and others. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture has been invoked on amendment No. 4901, the Thompson amendment. Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Now, Mr. President, the point I am trying to make here is--and I wanted it in the Record, and I wanted Senators to be aware of what they did when they voted to invoke cloture on last Friday. The distinguished occupant of the chair did not vote to invoke cloture, nor did this Senator, who now is speaking. There were 29 Democrats who voted against cloture last Friday. There were 17 Democrats who voted for cloture last Friday. As I note--and this may have been a cursory examination I have made--but I have noted, in a cursory examination, I believe two Republicans who were absent would have voted with me against cloture and I believe four Democrats who were absent would have voted with me against cloture. In any event, had 6 of the 17 Democrats who voted for cloture voted against cloture last Friday, we would not be under cloture at this point because the number of Senators voting for cloture on last Friday would have been only 59 and the number, therefore, would have fallen 1 vote short of cloture. [[Page 22816]] Now, I tried to get my fellow Democrats to vote against cloture because I felt that we ought to have more time to discuss this homeland security bill, which had been dropped on our desks virtually out of the shades of the early morning as they were lifting and the golden fingers of dawn were streaking across the land. I tried to get several Senators to vote against cloture, my plea being: ``Don't vote for cloture today. Give us a little more time. If we don't vote for cloture today, it will be voted next week ``--meaning this week, which we have now started. ``Don't vote for cloture today.'' One or two Senators listened to my importunings and voted against cloture. Mr. President, I ask for an additional 3 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is granted an additional 3 minutes. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, one or two Senators listened and voted against cloture. Some others listened and didn't vote against cloture but voted for cloture, which was their right to do. But let me just show what happened there. They voted for cloture. Cloture was invoked. Some of those Senators with whom I talked said: ``You have 30 hours in which amendments can be offered, and some of the problems that you outlined, you can get a vote on them, and possibly those can be amended and corrected.'' As we have seen, only one amendment--one amendment--was offered. It filled up that particular tree, so that no other amendments could be offered while that amendment was pending. But our good friends on the other side said: This far, no farther. You have offered an amendment-- meaning Mr. Daschle had offered an amendment on behalf of Mr. Lieberman; that amendment was pending--you have offered this amendment. That's the amendment we are going to vote on. You are not going to get to to offer any more amendments. The 30 hours will be run on that one amendment. So I hope Senators in the future will remember. Of course, I knew that could be done. But I have to say I think that is the first time in my memory--and I have been here during the great civil rights debates of the 1960s--I believe that is the first time--and I don't say it critically of the Republicans; they had that right, they played by the rules. Our problem is we don't all know the rules. But they played by the rules. We have one amendment. The 30 hours will be gone Tuesday morning, and that one amendment is it, and I mean ``it.'' Now, when cloture is invoked on H.R. 5005, as amended, if amended, we won't be able to offer any amendments. We can talk, but the ball game is over when we adopt the Thompson substitute. That substitute wipes out everything. It wipes out H.R. 5005, as far as that is concerned. So the point is, we voted cloture on ourselves. We did it to ourselves on this side. I knew every Republican would vote for cloture, but I hoped that at least enough Democrats would vote against cloture-- we only needed six more votes in opposition. But we did it. We did it to ourselves. We have had a chance to offer only one amendment. That is it. The Republicans say: That is it, no more amendments, and we will vote on Tuesday. I just say this so that our friends on my side of the aisle in particular will know what their vote for cloture on Friday has done to defeat our chances to have other amendments voted on. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the two leaders. There will be no cloture vote this afternoon, and likely no other votes this afternoon. Members will have all the opportunity they want to debate the Shedd nomination or, of course, the homeland security matter. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). The Senator from Texas. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what is the pending business? The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have 1 minute and a half left in morning business. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might have 10 additional minutes in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ HOMELAND SECURITY Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wish to talk for just a moment about where we are on the homeland security bill. I wish to talk about the amendment on which we will be voting tomorrow morning because I think it is important for people to look at the issue, in terms of understanding the full picture, at least given each of our abilities to see the full picture. We now have debated homeland security, I think, for seven or even eight weeks. It is obviously an important issue. When you are creating a new Department that will have 170,000 members--the largest reorganization of Government since the creation of the Defense Department--I think having a pretty extended debate is justified. I say to people who are opposed to the bill that I hope they will recognize that the debate has had an effect. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia, who has been perhaps the most outspoken opponent of the bill, I think would agree that a major problem with the bill has been changed--that being, it would have transferred to the President a substantial ability to change the appropriation levels set by Congress, and as such would have redistributed power from the legislative branch to the executive branch. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? I ask that 2 minutes of my inquiry not be charged against his 10. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I say right at that point that the Senator is correct. That was the major constitutional flaw. That was a major constitutional flaw. It dealt with the power over the purse which under the Constitution is vested here in Congress. Senator Stevens, I would have to say, was himself the foremost proponent of a change, backed by some degree of constitutionality. He is the major proponent on that side of the aisle of our veering away from that precipice and bringing us back to leaving control in the hands of the appropriations committees, and in the hands of Congress in large part. Second, I would say one of the foremost proponents of recognizing that constitutional flaw was the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm. I am convinced in my own mind--although I was not a little fly on the wall down at the White House listening in--that the Senator from Texas was a major, major proponent of bringing us back to our senses-- or at least the administration back to its senses--with respect to that constitutional flaw. I have to believe in my own mind that he argued with them to that effect. Listen, that is at least the one--that is the one in the Senator's mind, I would guess--unassailable point that the Senators from West Virginia and the Senator from Alaska make; that is, with respect to the power of the purse. You had better back off. Those are my own words. But I have reason to believe the Senator from Texas is responsible in great measure for what occurred down at the White House with respect to its backing off on that point. I thank the Senator. If I am correct, or if I have failed and my guesswork is incorrect, please say so. I thank the Senator for yielding. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the point I want to make--and I think it is a specific lesson of how government works--is that those who have followed this long debate, who have listened to the Senator from West Virginia, and know he has been on the losing side of vote after vote may say: What effect does he have? He has had a profound effect. Even though he is not a supporter of the bill today and won't be at the end of the day--and I have been in a similar position on many issues, as the distinguished Senator from West Virginia [[Page 22817]] knows--his major concern about the bill has been resolved. The debate and the clarity of the argument we have had on the issue of the power of the purse has had a profound effect on the bill. So you can be on the losing side of the votes and yet have a profound effect on the end product. That is the point I wanted to make. The Senator is right. I thought it was a change that should be made, and it is a change that has been made. I think it represents an improvement. I want to talk very briefly about the bill. I think I have a copy of it right here. Let me remind people what happened. I think everybody will understand the dilemma we were in. We adjourned for the election with this issue unfinished. The President came back from the election with what I believe and what I think the public perceives to be a strong mandate that this is the important issue that should be dealt with. The President could have said: Well, I will wait until the new Congress when my party will be in control, and I will write this bill exactly like I want to write it. He could have done that. He did not do that. And I believe that is wise. Instead, he sat down with three members of the opposition party and negotiated out additional clarifications in the bill. These clarifications are not profound, but they are important. As this reorganization process goes forward, and as 170,000 people are moved into one agency, these changes the President agreed to will assure that these workers and their representatives will have an opportunity to give input. They will have a due process procedure, but in the end the reorganization will go forward. The President will have the right to exercise the same national security waiver that every President--first through executive order, and from the Carter administration forward under law--since John Kennedy has been able to exercise. The next thing we had to do to get into a position to pass this bill is make clear what the final version of the bill would look like. We didn't want to end up with a week or two weeks of a conference with the House during this session where Congress is meeting after the election--sometimes referred to as a lame duck session. Many Democrats who are supportive of the bill wanted to be sure in negotiating with the President and in negotiating with the authors of the bill that they wouldn't end up having to negotiate again with Republican leaders in the House. Over the weekend--not this weekend, but the weekend before-- we sat down with the House leaders on this issue, and we negotiated out a final product. I would say of this 484 page bill, 98 percent of it is the Gramm- Miller substitute which we debated for weeks. There were several changes made that have been much discussed. I believe there is a more efficient way of characterizing those changes than the way they have been characterized. I want to try to explain them. Let me just first start by saying when the House writes a bill and the Senate writes a bill, there are often differences in the bill, and there is always give and take. Some have talked about extraneous material in the bill. I would have to say that in my 24 years in Congress, there are almost always issues dealt with in a bill that some people view as extraneous. I would say there are relatively few in this bill. But let me talk about the issues that are subject to the amendment Senator Lieberman has offered. This amendment strikes provisions in the compromise--I think there are seven of them. I don't have my notes with me, but I remember them well enough to talk about them. Three of these provisions have to do with liability. Let me remind my colleagues that since the Civil War, we have had provisions of law that have dealt with liability for people who were producing new products for war efforts. One of the ways of encouraging people to be innovative and one of the ways to get products from the drawing board to the battlefield quickly is to protect people from liability. There was a provision in the original Senate amendment, the Gramm- Miller amendment, that the Senators from Virginia were responsible for. That was a provision whereby the Federal Government would indemnify manufacturers of products that would be used in the war on terrorism, so that if a liability issue arose, the Federal Government would step in and basically cover the liability. I would have to say that was not my preferred option, but in putting the amendment together we accepted it. The House had another approach, which was to basically limit liability, require that lawsuits occur in Federal court, and set up a procedure to deal with liability that arose in these issues. In putting together the compromise with the House, we took something between the two that did not have the liability limits the House adopted but was a movement toward reducing runaway liability and removing the taxpayer from the line of fire. That accounts for three of the criticisms made. I want to address the one that is most discussed, and that is the one that has to do with mercury-based injections and smallpox vaccine. Under the bill, as it is now written, we are treating smallpox vaccine as an instrument of the war on terrorism. Before, we had dealt with it as a response to a disease. We had a liability fund for vaccines in the past, but now that we have eradicated smallpox, the only fear we have of it is the reintroduction by terrorist elements. So we bring smallpox vaccine under this liability limit. Those of my age will remember, if you get a smallpox shot, you get a skin reaction which produces a permanent scar. I say to my colleagues that this is pretty terrorism specific because no one would take a smallpox vaccination except for the terrorist threat because there are risks involved. Some small percentage of people have very negative reactions, some people die, and almost everybody has a scar from smallpox. This bill would require people who sue to enter into a negotiation with the Justice Department before they file suit, and to negotiate the possibility of a payment out of an indemnity fund. Some of our colleagues have said: Why did you make it retroactive? Wasn't that some kind of benefit to some vaccine producer? I remind my colleagues that nobody is taking smallpox vaccine now, nor would anybody take it unless there was an imminent threat. But we do have some of the vaccine stockpiled. Why would you make it retroactive to cover that stockpile that has already been produced? The reason you do that is, if you give a protection against liability for all vaccine produced in the future but not for what we have stockpiled, the manufacturers will destroy the stockpile and produce more vaccine. And if we had a sudden threat, we would not have the stockpile. So if this were a vaccine that was routinely taken, then I think the criticism would be well founded. But I think it is a total mischaracterization to say this is some kind of pharmaceutical bailout when it is targeted toward smallpox vaccine and the stockpile now has relevance only in terms of terrorism. In terms of manufactured products to use in the war on terrorism, I simply say, in every major conflict in modern history, we have had some liability limits for the people producing things for wartime use. The fourth provision that would be stricken has to do with the Wellstone amendment. Senator Wellstone offered an amendment to the bill that said, if you had a company that had ever been domiciled in the United States, and it was now domiciled anywhere else in the world, that company could not participate in contracts for the war on terrorism. In the bill that is before us, a couple of provisions were added to the Wellstone amendment that allows the President some flexibility in cases where the application of the Wellstone amendment would actually cost American jobs, where it might leave only a sole bidder, or where the absence of competition could drive up costs. You might say, how could it cost America jobs? Well, let's say you have a company that was once based in [[Page 22818]] America and still has very heavy presence in America but has its headquarters in France. Many companies are now international companies and where their home office is has ceased to have a lot of relevance, in my mind. In any case, the product made by the French-headquartered company might actually be produced in America. We could not buy it because the company is now domiciled in France but once was domiciled in America--maybe in 1812--but yet we could buy a product that was produced in another country by a company that never had an American presence. There might be national security reasons or job reasons to have a waiver. The amendment before us would strike that waiver. I think it is a good waiver. I think it is a good government provision. And I think it is one we should have. Another amendment has to do with advisory committees. I couldn't care less about advisory committees. I think sometimes they serve a productive purpose. I think in most cases they do not. But I think we are foolish to be striking advisory committees when the House has adjourned and may not come back to agree to the change if we make it. I do not think we ought to jeopardize this bill. Finally, there is a provision that establishes a broad authorization outline. No funds are appropriated for participating in the management of research. There is a definition that is written into the law that, as I understand it, would cover roughly 12 major research universities. I just ask my colleagues to look at these overall seven provisions, and to ask themselves a question: Would the bill be better off without all seven, because they are all stricken in one amendment? I think the answer is no. I think there is a logical justification for the amendments in general. And I urge my colleagues to get the whole story before they cast their vote. Finally--and I think this is of equal importance--this is an important bill. We are getting toward the end. This has been progress that has been hard coming. And I think we take a risk, one that we should not take, by making these changes. I do not think they are good changes. I think, overall, we are better off with these seven provisions in the bill than we are without them. I think, overall, they are defensible. Any changes you get in bringing the two Houses together in negotiation often are subject to criticism, but I think these are defensible. I think we would be taking an unnecessary risk by changing the bill. I hope we will not do it. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada. ____________________ EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that morning business be extended until the hour of 1 o'clock today. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST Mr. REID. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on the Shedd nomination be vitiated and that following today's debate on the nomination, the nomination be laid aside, and that upon the disposition of H.R. 5005, the homeland defense bill, the Senate proceed to executive session and vote, with no intervening action or debate, on confirmation of Dennis Shedd to be a United States Circuit Judge; further, that if the nomination is confirmed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate return to legislative session; that if the nomination is not confirmed, the Senate return to legislative session with no intervening action or debate. I extend my appreciation to the Presiding Officer with whom we worked for several hours Friday and this morning. I have spoken personally with the minority leader, and he has acknowledged that this is the best way to proceed. I ask that the consent be granted. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, I did not understand the distinguished whip's request with respect to H.R. 5005. Mr. REID. What I said is that when that debate is completed, we would move forward to vote on the Shedd nomination. Mr. BYRD. Even if that debate entails 30 hours in the train of a favorable vote on cloture on H.R. 5005? Mr. REID. That is right. Mr. BYRD. So that, indeed, the request has no impact whatsoever on H.R. 5005. Mr. REID. I would also ask that the previous order with respect to terrorism insurance remain in effect following the Shedd vote. The order in effect now is that we would do the terrorism bill immediately following homeland security. Now what we would like to do is dispose of the Shedd nomination and then finish terrorism. Mr. BYRD. Very well. I have no reservation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Texas. Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is my understanding that our staffs are talking. Someone just handed me this. If the Senator could wait for about 2 minutes, I think we are trying to run one more trap. I believe this is acceptable, and I am sorry to inconvenience him. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to do that. I withdraw the unanimous consent request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn at this time. The Senator from Wyoming. Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I understand we are still in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. ____________________ HOMELAND SECURITY Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I just listened to the two Senators who are probably most involved with the details of this homeland security bill--very interesting comments. I have been, frankly, disappointed that it has taken us as long as it has. We have been on this measure, I understand, now for about 7 weeks, and we are still not finished--a bill that needs to be finished. It needs to be there for security. Yet we continue to debate and worry over issues that are not as significant as the passage of this bill. I hope we are getting closer to passing a homeland security bill. It is our responsibility to do that. I am almost embarrassed that we are not. I am pleased that cloture was invoked and that we can move forward on this bill that gives the President the tools he needs to protect our homeland. We have talked about the details. That is good. On the other hand, there are provisions in there that generally most everyone would agree we ought to be moving forward with: Immigration, to change the reorganization of that department so that you have more emphasis on the immigration aspect with regard to terrorism; reorganization of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms so that it can work better in terms of terrorism as opposed to law enforcement activities. Personnel flexibility has been one we have talked about for a very long time. Certainly, the President ought to have as much authority for flexibility as others have had and as he has in other departments. We also need to have, obviously, some protection for the union representatives, and it is there; research and development, aiming it more toward terrorism, that is one of the amendments; critical infrastructure protection, of course, so that we get into helping with the private infrastructure such as dams, such as oil refineries, these kinds of things--important stuff to do--the Coast Guard, strengthening their position with respect to terrorism; the one on corporate inversion where there was concern about being offshore. The fact is it is only there to be used as long as it has specific economic security reasons to be used. I think that is reasonable. Airport security--all these things are there. [[Page 22819]] Again, I thought during the last month or so it became pretty clear that this session of the Congress has been exceptionally slow in moving forward. It has not accomplished many of the things we should have accomplished. I had hoped that with that in our background, we would be ready to move forward to accomplish this one that is so obvious in need. I hope we can do that. I am glad we do have Members on both sides who recognize the importance of doing this. We have carefully crafted language that will be there. It is time for us to move forward. Whether there is anything else that we really need to do in this lame duck session, I wouldn't argue that. We obviously have to have a CR. Apparently there is movement toward doing something with terrorism liability. But this is the one. This is what we need to do, and we need to move forward. I do appreciate the work that has been done. Particularly Senator Thompson and Senator Gramm have worked tirelessly in putting something together that will ensure homeland security and a department that will be capable of moving forward to do the things that everybody understands we need to do. Frankly, there are no more excuses to delay this bill. I certainly urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment and pass the compromise bill so the President can sign this into law. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is the Senate presently in a period for the transaction of morning business? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business until 1 o'clock. Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MAX CLELAND Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is sad and unfortunate that I and this chamber must say farewell to Senator Max Cleland. As a student, a soldier, a public servant, and a U.S. Senator, Max Cleland has always personified the best of this country. His has been a life of patriotism and sacrifice, of struggle and of triumph. After graduating from college, which included an internship on Capitol Hill, and receiving a master's degree in American history, Max Cleland volunteered for the Army and then volunteered for service in Vietnam. In that brutal conflict, he lost both of his legs and an arm in a grenade explosion. But Max Cleland never gave up. He refused to become simply a tragic symbol of an unwanted and unpopular war. At the age of 28, Max Cleland became the youngest State Senator in Georgia. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed him to head the Veterans' Administration, the youngest person ever to hold that post, and one of the best. In that position, among his many accomplishments, Max Cleland helped to improve the VA hospital system and reduce delays in paying veterans' benefits. After that, he was elected to four terms as Secretary of State of Georgia. In 1996, Senator Cleland was elected to the U.S. Senate. After being sworn into office, he told supporters: Your dreams can come true if you continue to believe in them long enough, hard enough, and never give up on them. What a role model Max Cleland is, not only for disabled Americans but for all Americans. His life demonstrates what overcoming adversity-- probably adversity at its worst, or almost that, at least--really means. As a triple amputee, life and work have not come easily. I have read it takes him 3 hours just to prepare for work each day. I would imagine it takes him longer than that, because it takes me that long many days. But I cannot imagine the amount of pure grit it takes for this man just to live. At times I get up from my bed at 1 o'clock in the morning, 3 o'clock in the morning, whatever, and adjust the temperature in my room. If it is a little too cold or a little too warm, I have to get up and go outside my room and adjust the temperature. I think of that poor man, Max Cleland, and how it is for him if he gets too cold or too warm and has to adjust the temperature in the room. He has to get out of bed with much more difficulty than I, and go to the thermostat and do that. So what grit it must take of him just to live. Well, one of Max Cleland's heroes is the great Franklin Roosevelt who, confined to a wheelchair because of paralysis, encountered many of the same obstacles and challenges that face Max. Still, Franklin Roosevelt was elected President four times and, as President, saw this country through the Great Depression and World War II. I am proud to point out that another one of Max Cleland's heroes is one of my heroes, a Senator who is one of my mentors in this Chamber, Senator Richard B. Russell of Georgia. Max Cleland met Senator Russell while serving as a congressional intern. When Max returned from Vietnam several years later, with both legs gone and only one arm, he met Senator Russell again. That grand old Senator was so impressed with the young soldier that he had his driver give the young man a tour of the Nation's capital. During his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Senator Cleland has used Senator Russell's old telephone number, and has often taken his visitors to see the statue of Senator Russell in the Russell Senate Office Building, telling them, ``So much of me is tied up in Dick Russell.'' Max Cleland truly knows the horrors of war. Knowing that ``war is hell,'' he has been one of the Chamber's leading skeptics about the use of military force abroad and has always proved cautious when it comes to committing American troops overseas. In the 106th Congress, for example, he was the first Democrat to call for a halt to the U.S.-led bombing campaign in Kosovo. He introduced legislation to update and improve the War Powers Resolution by erecting more safeguards before the deployment of our fighting men and women into situations of hostility. I must point out that I have not always been in agreement with Senator Cleland. I strongly opposed a balanced budget constitutional amendment, and I think Max Cleland supported it. I opposed the line- item veto, and I believe that Max supported the line-item veto. But I have never, never, not for a second, questioned his sincerity, his integrity, or his respect for our Government and his love of this country. Max Cleland is an outstanding Senator, a great American. He lost his Senate seat, at least for the foreseeable future, but he will never lose his integrity. Senator Cleland is a real winner. Just as his military buddies were proud to have served with Max Cleland in Vietnam, I am honored to have served with him in the Senate. Max Cleland is a hero. He will always remain so. May God bless Max Cleland. I wish him nothing but happiness and success in the future. God give us men! A time like this demands strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and ready hands. Men whom the lust of office does not kill; Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy; Men who possess opinions and a will; Men who have honor; men who will not lie. Men who can stand before a demagogue And brave his treacherous flatteries without winking. Tall m"
