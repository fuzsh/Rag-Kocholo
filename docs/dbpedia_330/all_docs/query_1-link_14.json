The eDesk platform powers 50 million+ conversations every month, resulting in billions of dollars of e-commerce transactions every year. They’d implemented HubSpot 4.5 years previously, but it wasn’t tailored to their business needs. Functions and capabilities were limited, and workflows were getting more and more complicated. It was costing their employees time, not saving it! We turned things around, shaping an intuitive, user-friendly CRM that cut workflows by 75% for less effort and better results.
