Are those welds I see on the aluminum rocker box? I like the idea of using aluminum. Is it rigid? Heavy enough?",

        "text": "Hi, Will\n\nno, these are made from steel and covered by Aluminium auto-adhesive foil.\n\nThe whole rigidity is fine except that the whole base has a slight wobble at powers >200x due to the axial movement system (initially made with GSO roller bearings and then replaced with 3 teflon pads which have better stability).\n\nThis is similar to the small wobble (4-6 seconds) that we see also on normal mounts when we mount such long (110 cm) and heavy (12 Kg) high momentum telescopes (Newton or refractors).\n\n25 years ago I bought a 10\" f/6 mirror from Nova Optics with the hopes of building a truss tube Dob. I had just finished a 6\" f/8 a few years earlier and had aperture fever so I bought the biggest mirror I could afford. Then life happened and I just couldn't seem to organize the time to get to it, so about 10 years ago I decided to buy a Telekit from Astrosystems thinking that might be the push I needed to build the telescope. Then life continued to happen, until my spouse gave me the push I needed and I started finally working on it last September. Now, nearly finished, I just need to centre spot the primary mirror, centre the focuser and install the secondary mirror, then collimate and check that the truss polls are the right length and that I can reach focus. Otherwise, everything else is complete and the scope is well balanced, with the counter weight system... Will install digital setting circles later.\n\nMy homemade 24\" f/3.5 in its latest and final incarnation. Upgrades from the original include full height UTA, a hinged tailgate with improved mirror support, composite rocker box, larger bearings, and both passive/active thermal management. The whole thing weighs ~140 pounds.\n\nIt's off to coastal California tomorrow, as I have access to a 32\" Tectron for the foreseeable future, I'm stuck in a 2nd-story apartment right now, and I'm redirecting my focus towards slightly smaller, faster instruments with meniscus mirrors. However, I will still miss it and getting rid of it was a hard decision to make.\n\nHi All, Here are some pictures of my recently constructed 10\" DOB I started in 1970. I never finished parabolizing after all these years because I did not have the knowledge or skills to do so. This past winter I spent 6 months regrinding and polishing, on my mirror-o-matic that I built, the 15\" mirror and 10\" mirror. The 15\" inch is F-4.617 and the 10\" is F-5.87. I had to learn how to use the MOM and how it cut. I also had to learn how to polish with the MOM. Along with this I built a Slit Image Test rig the I had to learn. Then figure out Image J to display the cross sectional image of the mirror in nanometers. To make this short the only thing I purchased for the 10\" scope was the secondary mirror and holder and the focuser and eyepieces. The rest is from my mechanical drawings and my brains. Many thanks to Mel Bartels, Waite Research, Bill Thomas, Lonnie, and Jeff for helping me along. I could not have done it without them all via the Net! Both mirrors finished out at 1/11th wave. However......the 15\" mirror took me 6 tries to get it correct and the 10\" took me 3 tries. Not bad the second time around. I am seriously considering a much larger project now that I understand grinding, polishing, and figuring on the MOM.\n\nBud\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc...0112-192654.jpg\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc...0405-123152.jpg\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc...0405-122924.jpg\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc...0331-172712.jpg\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc...0328-112614.jpg\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc...0318-120103.jpg\n\nEdited by forrestmohrman, 21 April 2022 - 07:33 PM.\n\nThis is my recently completed 8 inch F3 scope. I made the mirror on a mirror o matic style machine I built and tested it against an optical flat. I like to use an inclinometer and a degree circle to locate observing objects. There are some magnets embedded just below the wood surface above the handle to attach the inclinometer and again magnets underneath the rim of the mount baseboard so the position of the pointer can be adjusted. The scope has a wire spider and a Gary Seronik style double plate mirror cell.\n\nRod.\n\nPretty awesome scope you got there.\n\nI'm in the design phase on rebuilding a Orion 12\" Intelliscope. I have not used a scope with setting circles but I am interested in learning about them so I will have that option on my scope. Just a couple of questions if you don't mind.\n\nHow difficult is it to add setting circles to a scope? (As it is being built)\n\nAre setting circles worth it?\n\nWhen my Orion was new I got the option of digital setting circles and they just never seemed to work. I even had some very advanced guys to do the alignment and they still didn't work so they got removed as it was a hassle to deal with. I prefer star hopping but a little help every now and then would not be bad.\n\nAaron Scott\n\nEdited by Starseeker74, 22 April 2022 - 01:14 PM.\n\nPretty awesome scope you got there.\n\nI'm in the design phase on rebuilding a Orion 12\" Intelliscope.

I find them very useful and so low cost and easy to add I plan to use them on any dob I build. It’s best to get an inclinometer that measures absolute degrees and the one I have is illuminated which also helps. I added a red filter. You just need a metal strip somewhere on the tube for the inclinometer. I got the azimuth circle here:\n\nhttps://www.cloudyni...etting-circles/\n\nI had it printed and laminated at an office supplies shop. It’s then just glued to the top of the baseboard. Usually I add a metal strip to the rim of the bottom board of the rocker. The pointer is just a screw or a nail mounted inside one of those rare earth magnets with a hole in the centre. There are also leveling screws under the mount.\n\nTo set up I level the mount and set the pointer to 0 on the az scale and place the rocker so it is facing north. At dusk I look up the alt az coordinates of a bright star and compare them with those I am seeing on the scope. I move the pointer so it is showing the same reading as I see in my phone planetarium (sky safari).\n\nI use ES 100 degree eyepieces. I normally have little problem locating objects with this system. When I do have an issue it’s usually that the object is just too faint for the conditions or my ageing eyes. The object is somewhere in the field or very nearby. Objects near the zenith also harder to locate accurately.\n\nThe system works well enough that a few other members of my club have seen it and are also now using it.\n\nHope that answers your question.\n\nRod\n\nEdited by Rodastro, 23 April 2022 - 07:58 PM.\n\nFirst telescope ever, so it only makes sense to build one, right?\n\nWhat better way to get into the weeds....\n\nIt's an f/8-ish 114/900 spherical mirror, fully 3d printed (with a few obvious exceptions). The rods are 1/2\" solid aluminum.\n\nThe base is a lazy Susan project panel sandwich at the base with leveling feet and a brake.\n\nElevation is accomplished with a printed gearing system and its movement is kept smooth and firm with UHMW tape on the mating surfaces between plastic and wood.\n\nThe base comes apart into 2 (or 3 if you want) pieces all with easy-peasy thumb screws.\n\nAccessories are an eyepiece rack on the front side and holders for my cell phone and a battery brick to keep things powered up.\n\nAfter much trial and error at \"getting there\" I've been using the phone with Skyeye quite successfully as a \"push-to\" system. Poor mans go-to.\n\nIt started out based on a design posted on the Prusa forums and has evolved mightily from there.\n\nCurrently on my 3rd focuser version, for instance, a 2\" Crayford. The original was a big screw that I didn't care for much.\n\nI've been absorbing information like crazy and have used Newt extensively to make various little tweaks and dimensional adjustments, and to just learn how it all works.\n\nNewt is an excellent resource.\n\nCurrently printing out a filter system for solar viewing, including various sizes of aperture masks, the first \"lens\" for that system is the last thumbnail.\n\nThousand Oaks filter sheet sandwiched between two 5\" plexiglass discs with retention clips that'll all be captured in the front aperture retention system.\n\nI'll be making one of those with the Astro Solar white light filter element as well when it arrives.\n\nAnyway, y'all are very inspiring!\n\nI have posted this in other locations but missed this one so hear is my home made 34\" F2.89 fused quartz Mike Lockwood mirror with a 8\" secondary and 3.5\" Feather touch focuser with a Tele Vue 3\" Gig Paracorr Type 2 built into a sips system. All this is controlled by the Force 1 controller by Sitech with a big thank you to Dan Gray who helped me set it up. Everything worked grate at The Golden state star party and many great views were seen by many there. Still have some changes to make on the controller current flow at the direct drive motors but that is just part of a new scope."
