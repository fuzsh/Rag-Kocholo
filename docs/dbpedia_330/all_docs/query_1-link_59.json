        "text": "GM - Ignition Scandal: A known defect by GM that was hid for over a decade resulted in 124 deaths. 30 million cars were eventually recalled. Ultimately GM decided it was cheaper to pay off death victims than recall every vehicle\n\nVW - Emissions Scandal: VW promoted its \"clean diesel\" engines which cheated emission tests by being \"clean\" only during tests, but in the real world it switched modes completely.\n\nBMW was also complicit in this. However \"Daimler avoided a fine that would have totaled â‚¬727 million because it blew the whistle on the plot\"\n\nToyota - Accelerator Gate: Toyota paid $1.2B in fines because of a stuck gas pedal that affected 10 million cars worldwide. At least in this case someone was jailed..a man who killed three people because of the stuck gas pedal.\n\nFord - The exploding Pinto. Ford was fined $125M but was reduced to $3.5M in damages even though the court found they knowingly endangered lives."
