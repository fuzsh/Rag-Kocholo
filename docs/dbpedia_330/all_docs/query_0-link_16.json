        "text": "Terrestrial blood-sucking arthropods concentrate the nutrient portion of the blood meal by selective elimination of excess water. It has long been established that the Malpighian tubules are largely responsible for this water elimination in insects (Wigglesworth, 1931; Ramsay, 1955; Maddrell, 1964a,b). The argasid ticks excrete excess water via a pair of coxal glands (Boné, 1943), but until recently (Gregson, 1967; Tatchell, 1967b) the main excretory route employed by ixodid ticks was problematical.\n\nA major contribution to our understanding of water-balance mechanisms in ixodid ticks comes from the work of Lees (1946, 1947). He suggested for Ixodes ricinus (1946) that excess fluid of the blood meal might be excreted by evaporation from the integument, although Lees himself recognized some shortcomings of this hypothesis (e.g. ticks feeding in a saturated or near-satiirated micro-environment were still able to regulate body water content). A possible answer to this problem was suggested by Gregson ( 1967), who proposed that the salivary glands may function in osmoregulation. Tatchell (1967b) substantiated Gregson’s suggestion by demonstrating: (1) that the estimated total water loss from engorging Boophilus microplus was far greater than that measured through the integument, and (2) that tritiated water injected into the haemocoele of engorging ticks could be recovered from the blood and urine of the host. Tatchell inferred from the latter that the tracer could only have entered the host via the salivary glands. Belozerov (1967) also implicated the salivary gland as an important route for water excretion in two ixodid species (Ixodes ricinus and Derma-centor marginatus) largely on the basis of cuticular water-loss studies and the observation that the salivary glands increase in size during the progression of the feeding cycle. He points out that precedent has been set for such an hypothesis, since bloodsucking gamasid mites excrete water from the salivary glands after feeding (Belozerov, 1958).\n\nAlthough to date the ‘salivary gland hypothesis’ has been reasonably supported in one species of ixodid tick (Boophilus microplus-, Tatchell, 1967b, 1969), the latter species cannot be considered ‘typical’ of the family. First, it is a one-host tick (remaining on a single host throughout the larval, nymphal and adult feeds); secondly, and more important, it does not discharge fluid from the rectal sac throughout the feeding cycle (Seifert, Springell & Tatchell, 1968). Other ixodid species, such as Dermacentor andersoni, defaecate considerably during the feeding period, and so one must consider the possibility that a sizeable proportion of the total water loss may be excreted via this route. It was primarily for this reason that the relative importance of the integument, anus and salivary glands as sites of water loss was re-assessed in D. andersoni. We also hoped to estimate the relative importance of the salivary glands and the anus in eliminating monovalent ions.\n\nDifferentiating between the quantities of fluid lost via the anus and salivary glands proved to be difficult. Since the excreted saliva is injected back into the host tissues throughout most of the feeding period, it was not feasible to collect it and measure its volume directly. All attempts to collect wet faeces and measure their water content before evaporation occurred were also unsuccessful. It was finally decided to take advantage of information on salt concentrations in the fluids of the tick and host which permit one to calculate the probable fluid loss via the salivary glands. These calculations become possible because of the fortunate circumstance that once salivation has commenced the sodium concentration of saliva (161 ±3 m-equiv./l; mean±S.E.) collected in glass capillaries does not change with increasing size of tick (Fig. 1); the assumption was therefore made that saliva injected naturally into the host also showed little variation in sodium concentration with the phase of engorgement. The total amount of sodium ingested (Table 3 C) during the feeding period was calculated from the volume of imbibed blood (Table 1) and the measured sodium concentration of rabbit whole venous blood (101 ± 2 m-equiv./l; mean± S.E.). The total amount of sodium lost in the saliva by each tick during the feeding period was calculated from the following:\n\nIn order to estimate the net gain of sodium by the tick for the above calculation, the sodium content per mg unfed tick was determined (0·085 ± 0·007 μ-equiv.). The total volume of saliva secreted during the feeding period (Table 3E) could then finally be calculated knowing the amount of sodium excreted in the saliva, and the sodium concentration of the saliva. The actual data used in the above calculations are presented in Table 3, and show that the volume of salivary secretion accounts for 74 ± 1 % (mean ± S.E.) of the total water lost during feeding.\n\nA pictorial summary of the essential findings is presented in Fig. 5. The female tick excretes ions via both the anus and the salivary glands; however, most of the excreted sodium and probably chloride are lost in the saliva and most of the excreted potassium in the faeces. One explanation for the differing routes of excretion is that the major portion of the faeces is derived from host blood passing directly into the rectal sac from the midgut. If the midgut epithelium can transport sodium, chloride and water into the haemolymph but, is relatively impermeable to potassium, this would result in the observed high potassium and low sodium in the remains of the meal entering the rectal sac. There is some evidence for this hypothesis. Once the haemolymph has attained a stable composition 3 or 4 days after feeding has commenced, the sodium concentration in the haemolymph (160 m-equiv./l) is somewhat higher than the sodium concentration in the meal (100 m-equiv./l). Similarly, the chloride concentration in the haemolymph (125 m-equiv./l) is also higher than that in the meal (90 m-equiv./l). However, haemolymph potassium (7·5 m-equiv./l) is considerably less than that of the meal (42 m-equiv./l). These figures are consistent with the transport of sodium and chloride across the gut epithelium in excess of potassium. The relative impermeability of the gut epithelium to potassium has been suggested for the argasid tick, Ornithodorus moubata (S. E. Kaufman, 1971). Alternatively, one cannot rule out another plausible explanation. Since potassium is the major cation in the Malpighian tubule secretion of several insects (Ramsay, 1953; Berridge, 1968; Irvine, 1969; Maddrell, 1969; Pilcher, 1970) it might be absorbed from the midgut and then rapidly secreted by the Malpighian tubules of the tick. Provided that reabsorption of potassium in the rectal sac were lower than in insects studied to date, the net result would be a low potassium concentration in the haemolymph and a high concentration in the faeces. Although there is no clear-cut evidence which opposes the latter mechanism, there are some facts available which make it less attractive than the first explanation. On the basis of histological investigation, both Balashov (1958) and Till (1961) report that the Malpighian tubules do not become very active until after the tick detaches from the host. Most of the accumulation of guanine in the Malpighian tubules and rectal sac occurs at that time and is probably due to metabolism associated with egg development. This appears to be the situation in D. ander-soni as well (unpublished observations). However, more direct evidence on the quantity of fluid and potassium secreted by the Malpighian tubules during the feeding period is clearly desirable.\n\nOn dry-weight basis the sodium concentration in male faeces was about six times that in female faeces (217 m-equiv. Na/kg dry weight and 38 m-equiv. Na/kg dry weight, respectively). This finding suggests that males eliminate salt and water differently from females. Although there is little doubt now that the salivary glands are important for water regulation in the female of two ixodid species, for a variety of reasons it has not yet been necessary to postulate the same for the male. First, growth of the salivary glands during feeding is not as marked in the male as in the female (Till, 1961; Chinery, 1965). Secondly, the male imbibes only a modest amount of blood, and so it is not faced with the task of excreting large volumes of excess fluid. Finally, the paralytic factor (most probably carried in the saliva) is only rarely transmitted by the male (Gregson, 1943). One would suspect that anal and integumentary water loss might suffice to account for osmoregulation in the male.\n\nWhen one compares the ionic composition of haemolymph and saliva from Derma-centor andersoni and that from Boophilus microplus (Tatchell, 1969), some differences emerge. In Dermacentor the saliva to haemolymph (S/H) ratio for sodium and potas sium is insignificantly different from one: in Boophilus, however, the S/H ratio for sodium is greater than one, and that for potassium less than one, although Tatchell does not state whether the differences are significant. In both species the S/H ratio for chloride is I-I. The saliva of Boophilus is hyperosmotic to the haemolymph (S/H = 1·23), whereas in Dermacentor it is slightly (but significantly) hypo-osmotic to the haemolymph (S/H = 0·94). With the assumption that the primary secretion in Dermacentor is iso-osmotic or hyperosmotic to the haemolymph (i.e. that flow of fluid is driven by a local osmotic gradient), then reabsorption of solute relative to water may occur somewhere between the salivary acini and the oral cavity; micropuncture studies on vertebrate salivary glands demonstrate clearly that the ducts are responsible for solute reabsorption and hence the elaboration of a hypotonic saliva (Martinez, Holzgreve & Frick, 1966: Mangos, Braun & Hamann, 1966; Young & Schögel, 1966). Such may also be the case for Dermacentor. Since in Boophilus the saliva is hyperosmotic (as expected for a secretory system), this would suggest that in the latter species, either the ducts serve merely as a delivery system for the saliva, or that they possibly secrete solute as well. With this in mind it would be interesting to compare the ultrastructure of the ducts in these two species.\n\nDespite the large net flux of ions and water through the haemolymph compartment (in all, 9 to 12 times the haemolymph volume measured at repletion), the ratio of extracellular fluid to body weight remains constant throughout the feeding cycle (Fig. 3). This suggests that the rate of salivary secretion is correlated with fluid intake. Maddrell (1964c) concluded that the release of diuretic hormone (i.e. the stimulus to urine secretion by the Malpighian tubules) in Rhodnius is linked to fluid intake through abdominal distention via receptors in the tergo-sternal muscles. We have not performed the experiments necessary to reveal stretch-receptors controlling salivary gland activity in Dermacentor; but at least salivary secretion does not appear to be related in a straightforward way to haemolymph volume (Fig. 4).\n\nThis paper provides evidence that the salivary gland is the major route whereby excess NaCl and water are excreted in Dermacentor, and implies that as a result of this process control over the volume of haemolymph may be exercised. The mechanism of salivation (whether fluid is produced by a secretory or a filtration - resorption process) and the control (whether by nerves or hormones) are examined in a subsequent paper (Kaufman & Phillips, 1973 a)."
