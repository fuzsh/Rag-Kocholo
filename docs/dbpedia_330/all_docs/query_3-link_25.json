        "text": "SHODA TECHTRON CORPORATION was founded in 1957, in Japan. The company has years of experience supplying finishing equipment to the printed circuit board fabrication industry, with a staff of 70 in their Hamamatsu facility. In 1979, Shoda developed the world’s first V scoring machine for the PCB industry and has since added multilayer finishing equipment and panelization systems. Beginning in 1985, they have exhibited it in Chinese, European and in the North American trade shows with a good success.\n\nDirect recognition of the marking or tooling holes leads less deviation between V-score lines and the patterns of the panel\n\nθ offset after measuring markings or tooling holes\n\nEdge reference is available (Max. 6 panels can be load in 1 cycle)\n\nWithout Loader/Rotation/Unloader and PC rack, floor space can be saved\n\nHigh accurate jump score\n\nClamp the panel for stable pitch and web-thickness accuracy\n\nV-scoring on multi-pattern panels (before routing/punching) enables to produce various shapes of boards\n\nHigh-speed process of metal base PCB (aluminum, copper, etc) is available"
