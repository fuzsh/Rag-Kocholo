BY ROD LEE Viewers of programming on Northbridge Community Television (NCTV) are well aware of the station’s longstanding issue with cable service provided to the town by Charter Communications, also now known as Charter Spectrum. Bill Tartaglia, who has been director of the local-access channel for almost twenty-two years, certainly is. Mr. Tartaglia was front and center on the evening of January 24th at a public hearing held in the selectmen’s chambers at Northbridge Town Hall to run down by way of a video presentation how NCTV contributes to townspeople’s way of life—and to reiterate his concerns about Charter’s failings as a cable provider.

This overshadowed a revelation by Mr. O’Brien at around the same time of the latest steps he is taking as principal of Galaxy Development LLC to expand Pleasant <strong>Valley</strong> Crossing, just a few miles away on the eastbound side of Rt. 146. Asked what’s new with the complex, which has witnessed steady growth since its inception with a Market 32 and UniBank as major components, Mr. O’Brien said “there is an urgent care in planning right now for the parcel between Starbucks and the car wash.
