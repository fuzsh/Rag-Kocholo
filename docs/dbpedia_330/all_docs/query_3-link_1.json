        "text": "Superior Custom Electronics\n\nThe world of electronics has changed significantly since Techtron Systems opened its doors in 1971. Things are moving faster, the world has become smaller, and technology has become more and more advanced. At every step, Techtron Systems has remained steadfast in its commitment to producing cutting-edge products at competitive prices and in its dedication to the highest levels of quality and customer service. This means that we:\n\nOptimize the use of advanced manufacturing methods and technologies\n\nContinually improve the effectiveness of our management system\n\nProvide a safe and environmentally responsible workplace\n\nCustomer focused. Quality driven. That’s the Techtron Systems advantage.\n\nA History of Excellence\n\nWhen our founder, Paul Teel Sr., established Techtron, we were a small company in a basement. We have now grown to occupy a 70,000 sq. ft., state-of-the-art manufacturing facility that maintains the highest standards in the testing, manufacturing, and assembly process. Since those days in the basement, we’ve always made sure that our components are tested, proven, and produced efficiently and effectively. Throughout our history, that has been our staple.\n\nToday, Techtron is led by our president, Paul Teel Jr., and the mission is still the same: To provide the highest quality of products for our clients while pushing the envelope of innovation."
