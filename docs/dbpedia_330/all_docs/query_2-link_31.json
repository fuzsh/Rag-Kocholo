        "text": "We all see them, every day - little marks at the bottom of an ad or the back page of a brochure, little visual 'bugs' in a corner of a message signed by a much larger logo. They are called 'ingredient brands', and they are participants of and intending to add value to someone's proposition -- at times, in fact, a great deal of value. While small in size, they are complex business / marketing / co-branding relationships of many differing types with different structures and based on different intents, and play an important role in the consideration for, selection of, and loyalty to the proposition of which they are part. Most importantly, they can be an effective root for product expansion and related business growth.\n\nOver the years, I've had the opportunity to work on many such relationships. Intel Inside for example, perhaps the most well-known Ingredient ever and certainly the most game-changing in an industry. I could write a book about that program, a milestone in marketing history -- pure genius (or evil genius, according to where one sits). It was 1991, and microprocessors are tiny things inside a computer, in a market were all computer makers - already homogenized to a good extent by the commonality of the Microsoft operating system - were fighting over who had the better box. Intel decided to push on the public the value of the brain inside of those boxes and came up with a clever idea: basically, as it was explained to me by a Compaq client at the time, they offered to pay a great deal of a computer maker's advertising expenses in exchange for them placing the Intel Inside logo at the bottom of their ads (and then on their machines); and at the same time they started to run their own Intel-corporate market messaging. Every computer company jumped on it -- Compaq, Dell, Acer, Gateway, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Packard Bell, HP, IBM (but not completely) -- everyone got on the bandwagon. (not Apple, as their machines were powered by Motorola chips). The computer makers' management loved it and became addicted to the financials, while their marketing function was caught flat-footed and was slow in recognizing what all that meant to the public: computers are just dumb boxes and they are all the same, and what really counts is the brain inside. Even the smallest and most obscure computer maker could now compete, as long as the Intel Inside logo was on its communications and that little sticker on their machines. Financial gains vs brand equity - and brand lost. Intel had crafted the best Trojan Horse into industry dominance since ... well, the Trojan Horse into Troy.\n\nI know Intel pretty well as I served them while at Interbrand from 2005 to 2007, with and under my boss David Martin, in resetting their maddeningly complex Brand Architecture. Way too many cross-country trips from New York to Santa Clara (and way too many returns on the red-eye), but an immensely rewarding experience also because of the illuminated guidance of one of the greatest client team I’ve ever had the good fortune to work for and with: Kevin Sellers, John Travis, Rhonda Walker, and Lisa Bader (thank you all, memories are priceless). It all started with a first sales pitch presentation on Brand Architecture, where among many other things I mentioned to migrate their position from 'inside your computer' to 'inside your life' -- a direction that turned out to be in tune with what they were thinking, as proven by their work with the Centrino platform that was already under way - and combine their 'dropped e' corporate logo and the round Intel Inside swoosh into a single swoosh-unit. I went to David with the short draft presentation deck a few days before the meeting, he silently reviewed the fifteen pages, and then - in true davidmartinesquely nonchalant fashion, said \"well, they'll get to page 8 fine, and then after seeing page 9 they'll either love us or kick us out of the room\". They liked it, and we kept serving Intel for the next six years -- -- while my friend Paul Gardner and his FutureBrand team then designed the new beautiful logo and ID you see today.\n\nAnd indulge me for a moment -- a quick personal story. One of the first meetings I had with Intel was in May 2005; I check in at the front desk, get the entry badge, sit on the couch waiting for my escort to come and get me, and open my Mac -- keep in mind that at the time an Apple computer inside an Intel facility, and at HQ to boot, was ... sacrilege. I raise my eyes and there's a guy at the front desk with his back to me, sandals and a long-sleeve black T-shirt; he gets his badge and turns around -- even from twenty yards away I can see that he looks at my computer; he then looks up at me, breaks into a broad smile, and walks away toward the elevator. It was Steve Jobs -- and about a month later he publicly announced Apple's transition from Motorola PowerPC to Intel chips. I did work with Apple before, but that was with John Sculley, and this brief encounter with Greatness is near the top of my professional memories. But I digress.\n\nOver the years, I had clients asking \"can you give me something like Intel Inside?\" (in fact, as many who asked, before starting logo design work, \"I'd like something like the Nike Swoosh\"). Of course it's not that simple (on both counts), as defining the type of asset that's needed, how to deploy it, and who the right partner host(s) may be is complicated. Indeed, there are many different types of Ingredients, with different purposes, different desired outcomes, different types of hosts and levels of host acceptance, and different effects they have in the marketplace and with consumers -- plus, almost always, a variety of disadvantages.\n\nLet me start the examination with three overarching points:\n\n• the context of Ingredient Branding is Brand Architecture, within its specific subset of Third-Party Relationships; as Brand Architecture is at its core the foundational framework and codification of a go-to-market approach, any Ingredient-based initiative must be seen in that context and support & extend those perspectives;\n\n• the Ingredient strategy must be examined from the Ingredient owner's perspective as well as from the licensee host's standpoint - and the two must then converge in an optimal fashion, as there's no more powerful element for success than continuing shared interest; and\n\n• an Ingredient may be used both within the owner's overall proposition or given to a third party on a partnership or licensing basis; specifications on both counts must be exceedingly clear, as the two usages are typically not the same because the settings and intents may be different.\n\nDEFINITION\n\nAn ingredient is a component of a given market proposition (whether Corporate, Product, Service, Program, or Initiative), one that the ingredient's owner or the proposition's owner (which may be one and the same), or both, deem valuable enough to be made visible.\n\nINGREDIENT TYPES\n\nBased on their function vis-a-vis the host offering, there are four main types of Ingredients:\n\n• indispensable to functioning -- Intel\n\n• make the offering better -- Dolby, Gore-Tex, BASF (and its well-known campaign that spells out its intrinsic purpose: “We don't make the products you buy. We make the products you buy better\")\n\n• make the offering different (and yes, it may arguably mean 'better' as well) -- Nutrasweet, Lycra, Teflon (and in this last case, this brand may in fact be what a consumer looks for first)\n\nIn addition, there are elements that are 'ingredients' because they flank and at times contextualize the proposition itself. I’m listing them here just for completeness of the examination, but their usage and presence is usually straightforward as it's almost exclusively informational and promotional\n\n• denotes usability or compatibility -- HDMI, WI-FI, or Android-compatible\n\n• category marks - Ford's Alternative Fuels Road & Leaf, Energy Star\n\n• quality seals - Good Housekeeping\n\n• belonging to a group or alliance - Fair Trade\n\n• awards and recognitions\n\nKEY ASPECTS to address\n\nGenerally speaking, a choice needs to be made as to how the Ingredient is positioned and more often than not the nature of the ingredient provides the answer: either an overall Enabler (say, Lycra) which would be present in any and all communications, or a specific Engine (say, Intel) which would appear on certain Products communications but not in Service & Support messages, for example. If an integrated system is to be celebrated, making the ingredient into an Enabler could be more valuable than an Engine; but, treating it as an Engine could be more valuable in third-party licensed use. There's no cut & dried answer -- every business, industry, and market situation will have its own indicators, and in fact there are Ingredients that can be both Enabler and Engine, or perhaps appear as an Enabler in its owner’s communications at large but as an Engine when used within the third-party host's proposition.\n\nSeven key aspects to consider:\n\n1. Whether to visibly identify (and/or accept to use) an Ingredient. This business strategy decision may originate from the owner or from the host.\n\nFrom the owner's point of view, what's the strategic business intent? It's usually clear: Tempur-Pedic for example, who has patented a 'Tempur® material' and created a line of Office chairs in partnership with Raynor, marketing chairs \"featuring Tempur-Pedic technology\" -- a technology Ingredient version of its own corporate brand. Or Chevron and its Techron® fuel additive, a three-fold brand strategy: add value to Chevron's own product (as an ingredient brand), create new offerings (as a product brand umbrella), and join a public Top Tier list of clean fuels (as a branded proofpoint that can be messaged).\n\nConversely, from the host's point of view the surfacing of a third-party ingredient hinges on whether it adds marketing and/or perceptual value to and creates preference for the offering - and to what degree; and if does, then the questions is whether it also detracts from the proposition itself -- it certainly and obviously did in the case of computer makers' brands vs Intel Inside.\n\n2. How to identify the Ingredient. Creating those little marks you see at the bottom of an ad is an art in and of itself, separate and distinct from 'regular' logo design: they need to be small as they'll always be small, they can't overshadow the main signer of the piece, yet they need to be distinctive, unique, and most importantly visible at that small size (that's one key reason for the many bold holding shapes); in addition, a delicate strategic aspect of design here is surfacing the owner of the Ingredient in third-party use (that is, a Lycra by Dupont or even more strongly only by Dupont), as that host company may not wish to allow it).\n\nAs to naming an Ingredient, you can choose to 'brand' it or not and this decision usually hinges on how proprietary it is and on one's desire to trademark it. And there are cases where the same ingredient is branded when used by its owner but it's genericized or even rebranded when used by a third party.\n\n3. How to qualify the Ingredient in its relationships and function. Linking phrases, or 'straplines' are critically important: inside, powered by, solutions by, with, contains, compatible with, designed for, made for, works with, and more -- or even ... nothing, as Nutrasweet does. Here the most important aspect is message accuracy and immediacy of comprehension, not uniqueness or memorability, as the strapline must clearly define the function and context of the subject matter.\n\n4. How to use the identified Ingredient. If you own an Ingredient, you must have a set of tight and detailed guidelines about how third parties use it; in fact, such guidelines should be inserted in the legal contract between the two parties. And when a company uses its own ingredient in its own proposition(s), usage and related guidelines may be different than the one for use by third parties.\n\n5. Look at the future: are you creating an ingredient or a category? Look at Chemours' Teflon for example: the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) substance was accidentally discovered by a Roy Plunkett in 1938; it was patented in 1941 (Kinetic Chemicals) and trademarked with the Teflon name in 1945. Then in 1954 in France, the wife of an engineer urged him to try the PTFE material he had been using on fishing tackles on her cooking pans: he created the first non-stick pan and called it Tefal ('Tef' from Teflon and 'al' from aluminum), and many cookware manufacturers followed with proprietary PTFE-based formulas, including Swiss Diamond, Scanpan, All-Clad, and Newell Rubbermaid's Calphalon - among others. Teflon started as an ingredient, and ended up creating a Category. Was there a way to patent the whole of PTFE formulas to begin with? I'm no chemist and no global legal trademark expert and I may very well speaking out of turn, but you get my point.\n\n6. What support is needed. At times, the ingredient brand acquires such a pervasive life of its own that it needs a sub-environment, a custom ecosystem made of discrete personnel, specific facilities and micro-marketing, and dedicated customer support functions; to name one, such was/is the case for Dolby within the Dolby-enhanced products.\n\n7. The legal agreement. You've read a few legal references sprinkled in this article so far. In this #7 let me just summarize all that by saying that the agreement between the parties must be ironclad in its brand-related portion -- usage parameters of many kinds, size, color, verbiage, languages, and every other detail.\n\nAll in all, thread lightly and in a considered manner -- as an owner and as a host: Ingredient Branding is a highly strategic undertaking, one that can have a significant impact on corporate, product, and brand growth and related expansion, recognition, perception, and reputation.\n\nAnd if you are not in marketing and weren't quite aware of all of the above, next time you see an ad with one of these little 'bugs' do think sympathetically at us marketers and branders and about all the considered work that went into it. It'll make us feel better and prouder.\n\nA final thought for Clients: a few times I've been asked for a set of tenets (that is, not the 'pointers' I provided in this article) for creating an optimal Ingredient Brand. While I can make a list of sort, as so can many of my esteemed colleagues, Ingredient Branding has so many moving parts and interactions that it doesn't lend itself to generalizations. There will always be aspects that are unique to your specific situation that will impact, dictate, validate, or invalidate some or all of those tenets, and an approach that has worked for another company may in fact be exactly the worst thing you can do. Let an expert examine your specific situation, and then together make intelligent decisions.\n\n---"
