        "text": "Local IT industry leader Acer Philippines continues to expand its horizon in the commercial sector with the appointment of Techtron Systems Corporation as its newest partner.\n\nThe partnership with Techtron came at an opportune time for the tech giant as it aims to grow further its commercial line of computers.\n\n“Techtron had been a very supportive partner ever since. We appreciate their dedication and passion in selling Acer products, especially our Consumer line where they have been a partner since 2007. Now that they are a Commercial business partner of Acer, we look forward to grow with them even further,” says Manuel Wong, Managing Director of Acer Philippines, Inc.\n\nMr. Wong said they will even work closer with Techtron particularly in exploring business in potential growth sectors such as the small and medium-size businesses in the National Capital Region and in the provinces.\n\nTechtron is an aggressive business partner in selling Acer Consumer products and is a consistent top performer, bagging major awards during past Acer ePinnacle Awards, an annual event where Acer gives recognition to top Acer distributors and dealers.\n\nFor his part, Martini Assey Chua, Vice President for Sales and Marketing of Techtron Systems Corp., expressed elation over the appointment. “Since we partnered with them in 2007, we focused solely on selling Acer. That is our philosophy and we value the trust and total support Acer gave us in selling their Consumer line. That’s why we reciprocated that trust by being aggressive in selling Acer products,” Chua said.\n\nUnder the partnership agreement with Acer, Chua said that Techtron formed an entirely new team or business unit that will sell the Acer Commercial products. “We want to grow in other business areas aside from the government and the academe, and empower or encourage new dealers to carry the Acer brand.”\n\nFor more about Acer Philippines’ innovative products and other updates, go to www.acer.com.ph, follow Acer via Twitter (twitter.com/acerphils) or www.Facebook.com/AcerPH.\n\nAcer in a nutshell\n\nEstablished in 1976, Acer is a hardware + software + services company dedicated to the research, design, marketing, sale, and support of innovative products that enhance people’s lives.
