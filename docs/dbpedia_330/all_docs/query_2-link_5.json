        "text": "The Caltex® brand – Chevron’s main marketing brand in Asia – is managed from Singapore.\n\nChevron offers Caltex products, including Caltex gasoline with Techron® and Caltex Diesel with Techron D®, to consumers in Singapore. Through our Caltex stations and distributors, we also market Delo® and Havoline® lubricants and coolants, along with other lubricating oils and greases, to consumer and business customers. In addition, Havoline® engine lubricants and coolants for passenger cars and motorcycles and Delo® diesel engine oils, greases, other lubricating oils and Techron® Concentrate Plus fuel additives are marketed to consumer, commercial and industrial customers.\n\nChevron has 25 Caltex service stations, 24 Star Mart convenience stores and one mini mart in Singapore. In 2016, Chevron partnered with NTUC Link to join the Plus! loyalty program, which enables motorists to earn and use LinkPoints for eligible fuel transactions at Caltex stations.\n\nIn September 2018, Chevron introduced Singapore’s first fuel payment app that offers Caltex’s fastest and easiest mode of payment. Aptly named CaltexGO, the mobile payment app delivers an alternative, hassle-free refueling experience from the comfort of the motorist’s car. The integrated app helps consumers easily locate a service station and enjoy automatic loyalty LinkPoints collection, exclusive mobile offers and electronic receipts at their fingertips.\n\nChevron Singapore which operates the retail brand Caltex was recognized by the Building and Construction Authority in January 2020 as the first Company to launch a petrol station at Caltex Jurong Spring in Singapore. The petrol station has been awarded a BCA Green Mark Platinum (Super Low Energy) certificate – one of the highest sustainable building accolades by Building and Construction Authority (BCA). Designed to meet the fueling needs of its neighborhood with less environmental impact, the petrol station harnesses renewable solar energy, features greater efficiency in water resources management, and is expected to deliver total energy savings equivalent to powering almost 30 Singaporean households, per annum. In March 2021, SP Group and Chevron Singapore partnered to offer fast charging for electric vehicles at four Caltex service stations. These Caltex service stations are equipped with 50kW direct current (DC) fast chargers versus the more commonly available alternating current (AC) chargers.\n\nChevron Singapore launched the Caltex Carbon Offset Programme in March 2022. Customers enrolled in the Caltex loyalty program can choose to opt-in and use their loyalty points earned from their fuel purchase to offset a portion of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the combustion of the fuel purchased when they make payment for their fuel purchases via the CaltexGO app.\n\nChevron also markets asphalt and fuels to inland industrial and commercial customers.\n\nChevron is a major aviation fuel supplier in Singapore. We safely supply jet fuel to airlines at Singapore Changi International Airport.\n\nFrom Singapore, we also market marine fuels and lubricants to customers in Asia.\n\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND OTHER IMPORTANT LEGAL DISCLAIMERS\n\nThis website contains forward-looking images and statements relating to Chevron’s operations and lower carbon strategy that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other energy-related industries. Words or phrases such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “targets,” “advances,” “commits,” “drives,” “aims,” “forecasts,” “projects,” “believes,” “approaches,” “seeks,” “schedules,” “estimates,” “positions,” “pursues,” “progress,” “may,” “can,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “budgets,” “outlook,” “trends,” “guidance,” “focus,” “on track,” “goals,” “objectives,” “strategies,” “opportunities,” “poised,” “potential,” “ambitions,” “aspires” and similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, but not all forward-looking statements include such words. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control and are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Our ability to achieve any aspiration, target or objective outlined in this report is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: (1) sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; (2) laws, governmental regulation, policies, and other enabling actions, including those regarding subsidies, tax and other incentives as well as the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; (3) the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability-related standards; (5) evolving regulatory requirements, including changes to IPCC’s Global Warming Potentials and U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, affecting ESG standards or disclosures; (6) evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emissions reductions and removals; (7) customers’ and consumers’ preferences and use of the company’s products or substitute products; (8) actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations; and (9) successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions. Further, standards of measurement and performance set forth in this report made in reference to our environmental, social, governance, and other sustainability plans, goals and targets may be based on protocols, processes and assumptions that continue to evolve and are subject to change in the future, including due to the impact of future regulation. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nAmong the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude oil and natural gas prices and demand for the company’s products, and production curtailments due to market conditions; crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producing countries; technological advancements; changes to government policies in the countries in which the company operates; public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, and any related government policies and actions; disruptions in the company’s global supply chain, including supply chain constraints and escalation of the cost of goods and services; changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which the company operates; general domestic and international economic, market and political conditions, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict in Israel and the global response to these hostilities; changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; development of large carbon capture and offset markets; the results of operations and financial condition of the company’s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company’s joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects;

the potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; the ability to successfully integrate the operations of the company and PDC Energy, Inc. and achieve the anticipated benefits from the transaction, including the expected incremental annual free cash flow; the risk that regulatory approvals with respect to the Hess Corporation (Hess) transaction are not obtained or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated by the company and Hess; potential delays in consummating the Hess transaction, including as a result of regulatory proceedings or the ongoing arbitration proceedings regarding preemptive rights in the Stabroek Block joint operating agreement; risks that such ongoing arbitration is not satisfactorily resolved and the potential transaction fails to be consummated; uncertainties as to whether the potential transaction, if consummated, will achieve its anticipated economic benefits, including as a result of regulatory proceedings and risks associated with third party contracts containing material consent, anti-assignment, transfer or other provisions that may be related to the potential transaction that are not waived or otherwise satisfactorily resolved; the company’s ability to integrate Hess’ operations in a successful manner and in the expected time period; the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits and projected synergies of the potential transaction will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the company’s future acquisitions or dispositions of assets or shares or the delay or failure of such transactions to close based on required closing conditions; the potential for gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, taxes and tax audits, tariffs, sanctions, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; higher inflation and related impacts; material reductions in corporate liquidity and access to debt markets; changes to the company’s capital allocation strategies; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; the company’s ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent in operating in the global energy industry; and the factors set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” on pages 20 through 26 of the company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
