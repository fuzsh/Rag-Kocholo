Section E\n\nSECTION A -- FOREWORD\n\nIt continually remains a tragedy that many unique methods which were devised for specific purposes or problems and described in published research-related literature are overlooked, disregarded or otherwise ignored. One might somewhat rightfully conclude that the majority of such methods are nothing more than an unknowing duplication or modification of older known methods. Yet, the solution to any problem usually is dependant upon the investigative method selected. Thus it becomes of cardinal importance that applicable, cogent techniques are utilized and, preferably, remembered.\n\nMethodology long had been a favorite area of interest for me and one in which I and former co-workers had previously collaborated in compiling information. Unfortunately, that project was necessarily left unfinished in 1986. Hence, the inevitability of my pursuing a completion to that effort in year 2001 became pertinent\n\nAttempting to accumulate a potpourri of diverse methods proposed over a period of 60-years has become a Herculean task. Even my original plan of eventually releasing the undertaking in four sections has been abandoned. Instead, the work will be released in alphabetically sequential segments, the first being for methods beginning with A to D, the second from E to H, etc.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nMy thanks are extended to the people who, in the past, had contributed to this project, namely : Drs. B. A. Adams, R.P. Esser, J. H. O'Bannon and G. C. Smart, Jr. Dr. Zafar Handoo has been very helpful in submitting a considerable amount of information obtained from the U. S. Department of Agriculture Library. Dr. N. B. Khuong's input has been invaluable in transposing this work into HTML and S. E. Lasley, Senior Systems Programmer has also extended his expertise. I offer special thanks to Dr. J. L. Capinera, Chairman of the Dept. of Entomology & Nematology who has allowed me use of an office and laboratory, disregarding my \"emeritus\" status, and has encouraged the development of the present compilation.\n\nThere is nothing original about the present work other than it's mainly a compilation of various innovative techniques which other workers discovered or developed. Two sources have been very largely responsible for the information and the syntax, as presented herein. I can not praise too highly the thorough, meticulous work by E. J Cairns, 1960,. Methods in Nematology: a Review. Chapter 5, pgs.33-84 in J. N. Sasser :& W. R. Jenkins (eds.). Nematology fundamentals and recent advances with\n\nemphasis on plant parasites and soil forms. Univ. North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill. His work most closely approximates what I am doing, some four decades later. Accordingly I have used many of his descriptions of older work which is unavailable to me. Although my syntax, at times, may differ from his, it is his work that essentially is reproduced herein. The second publication on which I have relied most heavily is: the outstanding illustrated work edited by J. F. Southey, 1986. Laboratory methods for work with plant and soil nematodes. Reference Book 402, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, 202pp. This also is a storehouse of essential nematological methodology.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe inherent inadequacy of the present undertaking lies in the obscurity or relative unavailability of desired information on the subject of \"methods' . More often, when a method applicable to the task at hand isn't found, the investigator's ingenuity and resourcefulness must be called into play and a new method or technique is born. All too often, however, such novel techniques are either concealed or surrounded by a fortress of verbiage thus neatly obfuscating the reader. It is the purpose of the present work , in part, to resuscitate such methods from their relative obscurity. As additional information is located pertaining to alphabetical sections of this work already on the internet, the new material will be added as soon as possible\n\nOnly a part of the intended compilation has been completed. It now contains 2000 published methods pertaining to 124 subject headings as of Jan 1, 2005. The complete reference citation ,and usually a 2 to 3 sentence description of each novel method, is presented. In addition to the abstracts which constitute the bulk of the file, there is a Subject/Acronym section which coordinates with the Author/Reference section. Finally, there is a lengthy Publications File identifying the publications and scientific journals in which the methods have appeared. With the placement of the material on the internet, work primarily continues searching for applicable new methods for inclusion.\n\nIMPORTANT: There will be errors in this work despite the 'careful' formulation and reading of each entry. The author would appreciate being informed about such errors. Inevitably, some pertinent published novel methods have been overlooked. In such cases, if the complete citation AND accompanying abstract is sent to me, these will be included into this methods collection.\n\nArmen Charles Tarjan --- (tarjan@mail.ifas.ufl.edu)\n\nSECTION B -- ABSTRACTS ALPHABETICALLY ARRANGED\n\nACCORDING TO SUBJECT\n\nThe acronym or 3-letter \"identifier\" that follows each underlined subject category relates to the Author-Reference section. At the end of each listed reference, the reader gains immediate knowledge of the subject about which each author wrote by virtue of the acronym.\n\n----- A -----\n\nAERATION -- AER\n\nFlegg, 1967 -- Annals of Applied Biology 60: 429-437.\n\nUsing two Xiphinema species, the Baermann funnel method was compared with a dish method designed to provide enhanced oxygenation. The latter method produced more active nematodes than the funnel method.\n\nNicholas & Jantunen, 1963 -- Nematologica 9: 332-336.\n\nCaenorhabditis briggsae was cultured axenically in a biotin-free medium supplemented with chick embryo extract. The addition of avidin, which is known to combine with biotin, is an inhibiting factor. The effect of avidin is nullified by excess biotin. It was concluded that biotin is a vitamin required by the nematode.\n\nNicholas & Jantunen, 1964 -- Nematologica 10: 409-418.\n\nThe rhabditid nematode, Caenorhabditis briggsae, was studied under anaerobic conditions for effects on eggs, larval stages and adults. Such conditions were produced by exposing the eelworms, in drops of media, to a stream of carefully purified moist nitrogen or hydrogen. The nematodes were maintained under axenic conditions while anaerobic. It is concluded that swimming ablity is impaired by lack of oxygen, leading to complete paralysis.\n\nOostenbrink, 1960 -- in Sasser & Jenkins, Nematology Fundamentals and recent advances with emphasis on plant parasites and soil forms, Univ. North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, pgs. 85-102.\n\nNematodes are extracted from fine debris obtained by washing soil and afterwards placed on cottonwool filters. To facilitate an even distribution of nematodes in the suspension for counting, the nematode-water mixture is agitated using a small electro-magnetic air pump.\n\nTarjan, 1960 -- Plant. Disease Reporter 44: 574-577\n\nA test was designed to compare the utility of one-mil thick polyethylene bags versus glass jars as incubation chambers for extracting nematodes from citrus roots. The plastic bags proved to yield more nematodes from the roots. It was theorized that this may be due to the ability of the plastic to delay dissapation of soil gases and yet admit oxygen.\n\nWallace, 1956 -- Annals of Applied Biology 44: 57-66.\n\nThe rate of emergence of larvae from cysts of Heterodera schachtii increases with aeration. Studies on soil structure, rather than just an mechanical analysis of the soil should be emphasized.\n\nAGAR, CALLUS TISSUE -- ACT\n\nCorbett, 1970 --Nematologica 16: 156.\n\nTowards the goal of maintaining nematode cultures under mineral oil, Pratylenchus fallax and Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi were established on alfalfa callus in test tubes on agar. Tubes were inspected at the end of six and nineteen months with living nematodes being in evidence.\n\nKrusberg, 1961 -- Nematologica 6: 181-200.\n\nKrusberg used the medium proposed by White, 1943 (see below) for growing alfalfa callus on which Ditylenchus dipsaci, Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi, pratylenchu penetrans and P. zeae were cultured Details of nematode feeding and symptoms of injury are described.Sugars, organic acids and amino acids were subsequently examined in the alfalfa tissues.\n\nKrusberg & Blickenstaff, 1964 -- Nematologica 10: 145-150.\n\nAlfalfa callus tissue grown on agar media containing 2,4-D supported maximum numbers of Ditylenchus dipsaci, Pratylenchus penetrans, and P. zeae. Kinetin increased the reproductive rate of D. dipsaci, but reduced the rate of reproduction of P. penetrans and P. zeae.\n\nReidel, Foster & Mai, 1973 --- Journal of Nematology 5: 71-72.\n\nA simplified sucrose-yeast extract-2,4 D agar medium was beneficial in allowing reproduction of Ditylenchus dipsaci and Pratylenchus penetrans on onion and alfalfa callus cultured in 25x150mm tubes respectively. The average population of D. dipsaci was10.500/tube. For P. penetrans, populations averaged at 20,460 nematodes /tube.\n\nSchroeder & Jenkins, 1964 -- Nematologica 9: 327-331.\n\nFound that callus tissue is often a better host for nematodes than the differentiated tissue from which it is derived. They used agar slants of various media to produce callus from eleven crop plants and found that pea, alfalfa and cucumber callus were best for the reproduction of Pratylenchus penetrans.\n\nTamura & Mamiya, 1976 -- Nematologica 21: 449-454.\n\nThe authors discovered that Bursaphelenchus lignicolus successfully reproduced on alfalfa callus tissues. The simplified agar culture medium containing yeast extract, sucrose and 2,4-D reported by Reidel , Foster & Mai in 1973 was found to be the best.\n\nWebster & Lowe, 1966 -- Parasitology 56: 313-322.\n\nSix races of Ditylenchus dipsaci were cultured on alfalfa and red clover callus tissues on nutrient agar Red clover callus supported large populations of Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi while red clover seedlings did not.. Heterodera rostochiensis did not reproduce in callus tissue.\n\nWhite, 1943 -- A handbook of Plant Tissue Culture, Ronald Press Co., New York.\n\nAn agar medium which contains 20 different substances is described. It is suggested that the medium could serve as the basis for studies culturing callus tissue which, in turn, could support nematodes.\n\nAGAR, CULTURES -- AGA\n\nBingefors & Eriksson, 1963 -- LantbrHoegsk. Annlr. 29: 107-118.\n\nSterilized clover seed by soaking in concentrated sulfuric acid for 30 min, then washing with sterile water, then with a solution of streptomycin sulphate. The seeds were germinated on water agar.\n\nCohn, 1970.-- Journal of Nematology 2: 167-173.\n\nCohn studied the the feeding habits of Longidorus and Xiphinema spp. on grape seedlings, Urtica urens and Bidens tripartita. Both short-term and long-term symptoms were observed. All Xiphinema spp.caused a distinct thinning and darkening of root systems. Longidorus spp. caused stubby and swollen root tips.\n\n.Dallimore,1966 -- Phytopathology 56: 874-875.\n\nAseptic plugs of potato were embedded in potato-dextrose, corn meal or water agar and then inoculated with a piece of infested tissue from a young lesion of infested potato. Potato plugs prepared in this manner proved an excellent sourse of inoculum when placed in the soil near growing potato plants.\n\nDropkin & Webb, 1967 -- Phytopathology 57: 584-587.\n\nAxenic tomato seedlings were grown on agar slants of a modified 'White's medium' for studing resistance of the seedlings to species of Meloidogyne. It was found that plants resistant to M. hapla lacked necrotic responses and that larvae generally induced gall formation but the number of juveniles inresistant seedlings was much less than in susceptible plants.\n\nFeder & Feldmesser, 1957 -- Phytopathology 47: 11.\n\nThe burrowing nematode, Radopholus similis, was cleaned by soaking nematodes in mercuric chloride 1/1,000 for 5 minutes followed by 3 serial washings and centrifugations in sterile distilled water. The cleaned animals were fully infective when placed on citrus roots and retained their motility when placed on various types of sterilized agar media such as potato-dextrose, nutrient, potato-dextrose-peptone, and yeast extract.\n\nGoodrich, Hechler & Taylor,1968 -- Nematologica 14: 25-36.\n\nTwo predacious species of Mononchoides were cultured on water agar using Aphelenchus avenae as the food source. The article deals primarily with the morphology and systematics of Mononchoides changi n. sp. and M. bollingeri n. sp.\n\nHechler, 1963-- Proceedings Helminthological Society of Washington 30; 182-185.\n\nThe biological development of the predacious nematode Seinura tenuicaudata was studied on potato dextrose agar cultures using Aphelenchus avenae as the food source.\n\nKhera & Zuckerman, 1963 -- Nematologica 9: 1-6.\n\nStudied feeding habits of seven different nematode species on roots of different plants growing in 1% water agar. Concentrated extracts of the nematodes from soil or hand-picked, sterilized specimens were placed close to the roots of the 3 to 7-day-old seedlings. Hemicycliophora similis. Trichodorus christiei and Tylenchorhynchus claytoni fed on most of the thirteen plants tested.\n\nRussell & Perry, 1966 -- Phytopathology 56: 357-358.\n\nThe behavior of Trichodorus christiei (=Paratrichodorus minor) on wheat roots growing in agar. was studied. An agar block containing nematode eggs, and a section of root was placed on a cover slip and inverted into the concavity of a microculture slide. The cover slip was ringed with petroleum jelly. This allowed for close oservation of nematode activity.\n\nWyss, 1970 -- Nematologica 16: 55-62.\n\n0bserved the feeding of Pratylenchus penetrans, Rotylenchus robustus, Tylenchorhynchus dubius and Longidorus elongatus on strawberry seedlings growing in water agar. L. elongatus was found to be highly pathogenic in contrast to damage caused by the other three species. Plants attacked by L. elongatus show characteristic root deformations and suppressions of growth.\n\nAGAR, SPECIAL METHODS -- ASM\n\nCulbreath, Rodrigues-Kabana & Morgan-Jones, 1984 -- Nematropica 14: 145-154.\n\nAn agar-disc method was developed for estimating the level of fungal colonization of nematode eggs in soil and for isolation of involved fungi. A field study demonstrated a significant level of egg colonization by fungi in a soil with five different fertilizer treatments. Soils deficient in nitrogen had a higher level of egg colonization than those with adequate nitrogen fertilization.\n\nden Ouden, 1958 --Tijdschrift voor Plantenziekten 64: 269-272.\n\nA method for growing plants in thin layers of agar is described. Enough agar is introduced into polyethylene bags under sterile conditions to form a thin, even layer containing numerous air bubbles. Sterile germinated seeds are inserted through a cut in the bag which is then resealed . Cuts are subsequently made for the shoots to emerge. Sterile nematodes are introduced as is water, from time to time. The method can be used for the observation of nematodes and other root paprasites while attacking growing roots.\n\nden Ouden, 1960 -- Nematologica 5: 255-259.\n\nAn improved agar medium for making thin agar layers in polyethylene bags was presented. The medium is prepared by mixing one part of a 1% solution of methylcellulose in water (prepared 12 hours before mixing) with one part of 5% agar dissolved in a double concentration of a suitable nutrient solution. Seedlings are introduced ito the bags and subsequently inoculated with nematodes.\n\nFeldmesser, 1967 -- Nematologica 13: 141-142.\n\nPlants were grown on an agar medium contained in Petri dishes the lids of which\n\ncontained holes through which the stem grew. Meloidogyne incognita inoculum consisted of 100 to 200 surface-sterilized nematodes. This technique was devised to test the effect of stem- and foliage-applied nematocides on the nematodes in or near the roots .\n\nGrewal, 1990 -- Revue de Nematologie 13: 121-122.\n\nThe use of agar as a cover-glass support for quick preparation of mounts of nematodes is described. The described agar method removes the need for coverglass supports when the area occupied by the mountant exceeds a quarter of the cover glass area.. The method is simple, quick and inexpensive.\n\nMountain, 1955 -- Proceedings Helminthological Society of Washington 22: 49-52.\n\nA technique of rearing plant parasitic nematodes under aseptic conditions on root tissiue cultures is described. White's culture medium (White, 1973) is used without modification except that the solution is made up into a 0.75% agar medium on which seeds of corn, tobacco and red clver were planted. Once germinated, the root tips were severed and transferred to nutrient agar and inoculated with nematodes.\n\nO'Bannon & Taylor, 1968 -- Phytopathology 58: 385.\n\n2-4mm carrot discs from carrots previously cut, washed, dipped in 95% ethanol then flamed. were placed on 1% water agar. Pratylenchus brachyurus or Radopholus similis were pippetted onto the agar beside the discs or first added to the agar then the discs were placed on top.. This proved to be a rapid method of obtaining large nematode populations for greenhouse experiments.\n\nTiner, 1961 -- Experimental Parasitology 11: 231-240.\n\nPratylenchus penetrans from corn roots are treated 1 hr. with 0.2 mg/ml aqueous mercurochrome and suspended in sterile water. Roots from agar-flask cultures are placed in special \"trap units\". Quantitative studies included infection buildup in excised roots, abandonmenmt of damaged roots by the parasites, and toxicologic experiments.\n\nAGAR, SPECIAL PREPARATIONS -- ASP\n\nChen, Kilpatrick & Rich, 1961 -- Phytopathology 51: 799-800.\n\nAxeniic cultures of Pratylenchus penetrans were established on roots of white-clover seedlings which were growing under flourescent light in tubes on agar containing modified Hoagland's and Knop's nutrients. The method provided a pure culture technique for studying damage to the plants caused by the nematodes alone.\n\nGrootaert & Jaques, 1979 -- Nematologica 25: 203-214.\n\nButlerius degrissei n. sp., a predatory diplogasterid, was maintained in xenic culture on 0.8% bactoagar using Panagrellus redivivus as its food source. Details on its culture, reproduction, feeding habits, and life-cycle are presented.\n\nGrootaert & Maertens, 1976 -- Nematologica 22: 173-181.\n\nMononchus aquaticus was cultivated on dishes of 1% bacto-agar using Panagrellus redivivus as its. food source. Optimum temperature for mass cultivation was found to be 22C. The role of the excretory gland during ecdysis was discussed, and information was presented on feeding behaviour, embryology and moulting.\n\nNigon, 1949 -- Annales Scientifique Naturelle 11: 1-132.\n\nThe author used an agar medium containing magnesium sulphate, potassium phosphate sodium chloride, potassium nitrate, peptone, lethicin and water. His studies determined that the agar medium could be used with success for agnotobiotic cultures of families of non-parasitic soil nematodes.\n\nPillai & Taylor, 1968 -- Nematologica 14: 285-294.\n\nThe authors cultured the predacious Demaniella basili n. sp. on a buffered sucrose-tryptose-agar medium in mixed culture with an intermediate coliform bacterium and the amoeba, Naegleria gruberi. The paper essentially is a population study.\n\nThornton, 1922 -- Annals of Applied Biology 9: 241-274.\n\nThe author recommended the use of an asparagine-mannitol agar for culturing the bacterial-feeding nematodes occurring in environments poor in putrifying materials.\n\nAGING -- AGE\n\nBollinger & Willett, 1978 -- Nematologica 24: 398-403.\n\nA method for age synchrony of Panagrellus redivivus in xenic culture is described. Synchronous cultures are begun with 1-2 day old larvae and resynchronized at 7 days of age and every 3 days thereafter. Synchrony is obtained by separating parents from their progeny, and females from males, on sucrose gradients.\n\nBollinger & Willett, 1981 -- Nematologica 26: 491-493.\n\nIn a second paper suggesting a method for synchrony of adult Caenorhabditis elegans, the authors propose a method that uses settling and filtration to obtain synchronized populations of adults in sufficient quantity for life history studies. The synchrony method suggested allows for an adequate number of individuals in each of the adult phases to be obtained for comparison.\n\nGiovanola, 1936 -- Journal of Parasitology 22: 207-218.\n\nTo distinguish glycogen from other polysaccharides, control slides were placed in a solution of filtered saliva in distilled water for an hour @37C. This destroyed all of the glycogen present by the action of glycolitic enzymes.\n\nRogers, 1939 -- Journal of Helminthology 17: 195-202.\n\nThese tests were designed to investigate at regular intervals the activity, infectivity, and fat content of ageing infective juveniles of Ancylostoma caninum. Two lots of juveniles were stored in jars containing water. One jar was stored at 37C and one at 7C Each week nematodes from each lot were examined for the presence of glycogen and fat, infectivity and activity.\n\nRogers, 1940 -- Journal of Helminthology 18: 183-192.\n\nThe infectivity, fat content and activity of Haemonchus contortus juveniles was examined. Forms in which the line of fat along the intestine was well marked, broad, and in which activity was over 70 moves per minute are regarded comparatively as highly infective. Juveniles in which fat globules were smaller, separated, and round and the nematodes had an activity of 40 moves per minute had low infectivity.\n\nANAESTHETIZING -- ANS\n\nEllenby & Smith, 1964 -- Nematologica 10: 342-343.\n\nPanagrellus redvivus and Globodera rostochiensis juveniles were immobilized within 1/2 hr when placed in the lower strengths of a 0.5 to 1.0% soln. of propylene phenoxetol in tap water.\n\nGoodey, 1957 -- Technical Bulletin 2, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, 47pp.\n\nAdd 50ml of water into a small stoppered bottle and add 2 drops of dichlorethyl-ether. Shake well and allow the contents to clear. Nematodes placed in the solution will become immobilized but will recover quickly when placed in fresh water.\n\nNelson, Albert & Riddle, 1983 -- Journal of Ultrastructural Research 82: 156-171.\n\nNematodes quickly became anaesthetized after being immersed in 0.01M concentration of sodium azide. They were reactivated after rising with fresh water.\n\nNoel & Maggenti, 1976 -- Journal of Nematology 8: 271-272.\n\nNematodes were immobilized by carbon dioxide perfusion. The specimens were placed in a drop of water on a slide next to the \"dry ice\" (frozen CO2) beneath an inverted beaker.\n\nPeters, 1955 -- in Soil Zoology, ed D.K.M. Kevan, London, Butterworth, pg. 417.\n\nActive nematodes can be immobilized by immersion into a solution of bis-chloroethyl ether (25 dps/ 100ml) and killed by a solution of 0.1% iodine solution.\n\nTownshend, 1984 -- Journal of Nematology 29: 357-360.\n\nThe effects on three nematode species of four concentrations of propylene phenoxetol, as well as a weak solution of dichlorodiethyl ether, were observed. The immobilized nematodes recovered when placed in fresh water.\n\nANALYSIS -- ANA\n\nBird & Rogers, 1956 -- Experimental Parasitology 5: 449-457.\n\nThe chemical composition of the cuticle of third stage nematode larvae was investigated.\n\nJuveniles of Haemonchus contortus, Trichostrongilus spp, and Nippostrongylius muris\n\nwere found to be soluble in boiling water, 0.2 N NaOH, and 10% sodium hypochlorite.\n\nAn extensive further analysis was done.\n\nDeubert & Gray, 1975 -- Nemtologica 20: 365-366.\n\nA new technique which enables workers to quantify chemical components in individual nematodes was reported. Analyses were conducted with a Varian-Techtron AA5R atomic absorption spectrophotometer equipped with a Model 61 carbon rod atomizer with Mini-Massmann type rods. The technique requires two attendents. One analysis could be carried out in 6-8 minutes.\n\nFenwick, 1952 -- Annals of Applied Biology 39: 457-467.\n\nThe effect of diluting potato root diffusate was investigated. It was found that hatching ability was inversely proportional to the logarithim of its dilution. There is a \"threshold value\" of dilution for each sample beyond which it becomes inactive. The slopes of the dilution curves for the diffusates were all parallel. These relationships can be used for determining sample strength.\n\nKaul, 1962 -- Nematologica 8: 288-292.\n\nStudies were conducted on a phenolic complex obtained from the cysts of Heterodera rostochiensis. The material studied, a pigment, was obtained from the cyst walls of the nematode. It was extracted with ethanol and later with carbon tetrachloride to free it from fat and other liupids. It was concluded that the cyst wall contained no tannin group substance and that the cysts contained a hydrostable condensed catechin substance.\n\nMarlatt, Morton & McKittrick, 1959 -- Plant Disease Reporter 43: 1073-1077.\n\nThe authors sought to determine if a relationship existed between plant parasitic nematodes and cantaloupe (muskmellon) vines suffering from \"crown blight\", a disease of unknown origin. Cantaloupe vines were planted in greenhouse pots in soil from both diseased and healthy areas. No relationship was found between nematodes which might be parasitic and crown blight\n\nMorgan & McAllan, 1962 -- Nematologica 8: 209-215.\n\nA simple viscometer is depicted for analysis of enzymes in nematodes. The viscometer is a capillary tube of 1mm bore with a central reservoir of 1.5ml capacity. The time for the reservoir to empty between two scratch marks is recorded by a stopwatch calibrated in tenths of seconds. The water bath has temperature fluctuation of +/- 0.01C and pumps 10L/min thru a water jacket so as to maintain a constant temperature in the viscometer.\n\nNoel & Maggenti, 1976 -- Journal of Nematology 8: 271-272.\n\nThe authors proposed a method using vaporphase perfusion of carbon dioxide for the anesthetization of nematodes. The method allows for the starting of greenhouse cultures with large, pure populations of the desired species.\n\nTastet, Bossis Gauthier, Renault & Mugniery, 1999 -- Nematology 1: 301-314.\n\nStudies were conducted determining the variation of total soluble protein extracts from females of Meloidogyne chitwoodi and M. fallax using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The results from a clustering analysis allowed differentiation between both species and showed intraspecific variation among the M. chitwoodi isolates to be equal to that among the M. fallax isolates.\n\nYe & Robinson, 2004 -- Journal of Nematology 36: 207-218.\n\nFor a new approach in species identification, a cluster analysis of Longidorus species is suggested. Cluster analysis dendograms visually illustrate the grouping and morphometric relationships of the species and populations. It provides a computerized statistical approach to assist by helping to identify and distinguish species, by indicating morphometric relationships, and by assisting with new species diagnosis.\n\nAXENIZATION -- AXE\n\nBolla & Jordan, 1982 -- Journal of Nematology 14: 377- 381.\n\nThe pine wilt nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, was cultured axenically in vitro on\n\nsoy peptone/yeast extract or modified Caenorhabditis medium supplemented with cholesterol and hemoglobin. This medium was best for nematode growth and reproduction.\n\n.\n\nBuechner & Hansen, 1971 -- Journal of Nematology 3: 199-200.\n\nMass culture of axenic nematodes using continuous aeration was reported. The nematode species Caenorhabditis elegans, Turbatrix aceti, Panagrellus redivivus, Neoaplectana glaseri, and N. carpocapsae were tested for growth under continuous aeration. Each species went through one or two generations. Counts were up to more than 10 times greater than in control testtube cultures. and increased up to 600-fold over the inoculum.\n\nBuecher, Hansen & Myers, 1970 -- Journal of Nematology 2:189-190.\n\nContinuous axenic culture of an Aphelenchoides species is reported. It is suggested that development of large populations of the nematode in a medium composed of commercially available ingredients, and establishment of continuous axenic cultures on glass wool columns will facilitate study of nutritional requirements of the nematode.

Microchemical tests on solutions in which Ditylenchus triformis was incubated were positive for amino acids, amines ammonia, proteins, 1,2-diboxylic acids and aldehaydes but negative for primary alphatic amines, formic acid, methanol, alcohols, and a number of other substances.\n\nNicholas, Hansen & Dougherty, 1962 -- Nematologica 8: 129-135.\n\nSo as to determine which of the B vitamins are required by the free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis briggsae, it was cultured axenically in a known medium together with chick embryo extract. The concentration of each vitamin added to the medium was varied, and each was omitted in turn. It was found that the omission of thiamine, riboflavin, folic acid, calcium pantoythenate, niacinimide and pyroxidine was deleterious.\n\nNicholas & Jantunen, 1963 -- Nematologica 9: 332-336.\n\nCaenorhabditis briggsae was cultured axenically in a biotin-free medium supplemented with chick embryo extract. The addition of avidin, which is known to combine with biotin, is an inhibiting factor. The effect of avidin is nullified by excess biotin.It was concluded that biotin is a vitamin required by the nematode.\n\nPeters, 1928 -- Journal of Helminthology 6: 1-38.\n\nIn this lengthy article, Peters conducted a thorough investigation of the vinegar eelworm, Turbatrix aceti.The work on this subject of other authors was also reviewed and new procedures were devised for obtaining additional information. Some of the conclusions arrived at by the author were that the worm has very little need for oxygen and displays a negative geotaxis which is independent of dissolved oxygen as a stimulus. The nematode also is very susceptile to drying, and very sensative to iodine, ammonia, and chloroform, but extraordinarily resistant to most chemical substances. Re the vinegar industry, it was demonstrated to be harmful only when it occurs in the acetifiers, from which it can be eliminated by a suitably high temperature of 40C.\n\nPopham & Webster, 1979 -- Nematologica 25: 67-75.\n\nThe use of osmium tetroxide-salt mixtures in localizing ions in Caenorhabditis elegans was employed so as to precipitate ions in situ and to further clarify the problem of ion regulation.

This implicitly suggests that an increased oxygen supply to cysts will stimulate increased emergence.\n\nWebster & Lowe, 1966 -- Parasitology 56: 313-322.\n\nThe effect of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was investigated using nematodes in monoxenic culture. It was found that some callous tissue was induced by 2,4-D. Some plants normally resistant to plant parasitic nematodes lost that resistance. Studies were conducted on Aphelenchoides ritzema-bosi, Ditylenchus dipsaci, and Heterodera rostochiensis raised on callous tissue in agar culture.

Five or more chambers can be accomodated in a single unit, thus considerably expediting the counting of a large number of samples. Extensive experimentation with the new slide revealed that counts from different samples from a suspension of Heterodera eggs and larvae have been found to conform to a Poisson distribution.\n\nFenwick, 1967 -- Nematologica 13: 467-468.\n\nA counting slide was constructed consisting of three sheets of 1.5mm thick perplex which are cemented together. The lower sheet is marked with lines 3mm apart, the middle sheet is a spacer, while the upper sheet is unmarked.\n\nFenwick & Mohammed, 1967 -- Journal of Helminthology 18: 155-172.\n\nIn a paper dealing with the recovery and counting of cysts of Heterodera schachtii from soils containing less than 115 moisture, the author described a new type of cyst counting slide. A modification of the usual method for counting cysts was proposed The optimum weight of a soil sample for these procedures was found to be 1/2 lb.\n\nFerris, Mai & Lyon, 1956 -- Plant Disease Reporter 40: 182-183.\n\nA new method for counting golden nematode cysts was developed by use of small rectangular plastic boats which are made in the laboratory. The size and design of the boat make it possible to count cysts quickly and accurately. The boats are partly filled with water, the cyst material is placed within them, and all clumps are broken up.\n\nJimenez, 1972 -- Nematropica 2: 6.\n\nA rapid method for building nematode counting chambers promises highly satisfactory results because of convenience in cleaning and operation. Plexiglass 3x1mm thick is used to construct chambers which are a small reticulum engraved on a flat bottom, retangular in shape of 8.0 x 5.0 x 0.1 cm to which a frame of the same dimensions is fixed.\n\nJohnson, 1957 -- Plant Pathology 6: 75.\n\nIn a paper only two paragraphs in length, details for an improved cyst counting tray are based on a modification of an earlier described counting tray (Fenwick, J. Helminth 18:155-172. 1940).\n\nPeters, 1952 -- Journal of Helminthology 26: 97-110.\n\nFor use in tests with the vinegar eelworm, Turbatrix aceti, a novel counting slide was deveoped. A detailed description of the slide and also of the counting method which gave replicate counts in agreement with Poisson expectations.\n\nSingh & Menon, 1968 -- Indian Phytopathology 21: 451-453.\n\nAn easy-to-make counting dish for nematological work is reported using 2mm thick perspex.The dish has sides sloping at an angle of 45 degrees to permit examination and manipulation of nematodes lying in the peripheri. The inside bottom surface is divided into sections by raised ridges 1mm high. The underside of the dish has 3 small lugs which prevent the scoring of the base when the dish is slid over the microscope stage.\n\nTarjan, 1950 -- Phytopathology 40: 1111-1124.\n\nSyracuse watch glasses was specially divided so as to facilitate relatively accurate determinations of all the nematodes in the dish, based on the careful counting of the nematodes in specified sectors.\n\nvan Bezooijen, 1970 -- Nematologica 16: 457-458.\n\nA modification of Cobb's syracuse watch glass is suggested whereby the counting dish which holds 10ml is a modification of Cobb's engraved watch glass and is made of polymethylacrylate plate. It has engraved concentric rings which are separated into 12 lined sections.\n\nWilliams & Winslow, 1955 -- in Soil Zoology, Proceedings University Nottingham Second Easter School in Agric., Science, Butterworth, pp 375-384.\n\nUnder the heading \"Estimation of Cyst Contents\" a counting slide is decribed and figured After the cysts are squashed from pressure exerted by a microscope slide, the material is washed into a small contained with tap water. The suspension is then homogenized by blowing using a 10 ml pipette for 10-20 sec, quickly drawing up 10ml, and injecting the suspension into the first chamber of a perplex counting slide. Counting methods are discussed.\n\nCOUNTING METHODS --CNM\n\nBarker & Sasser, 1959 -- Phytopathology 49: 664-670.\n\nIn order to assay Ditylenchus dipsaci in roots, young seedlings were boiled for 4-5 min in a cotton blue-lactophenol solution. The seedlings are then crushed between 2 slides and the stained nematodes are counted.\n\nBaxter, 1968 -- Nematologica 14: 599-600.\n\nAn intermittent or continuous counter is described and figured for use in nematolgical investigations. An illustration of the counter and a detailed diagram of the contained circuitry are provided.\n\nBeaver, 1950 -- Journal of Parasitology 36, 451-456.\n\nEggs of Ascaris lumbricoides or Trichuris trichiura in fecal smears were counted. Fecalsmears of varying density were evaluated using just a drop of a barium sulphate solution for each of the smears.\n\nByerly, Cassada & Russell, 1975 -- Review of Scientific Instruments 46: 517-522.\n\nA counter is used to detect changes in the electrical current produced when a suspended particle (such as a nematode) passes between the two electrodes of a small transducer. Microprocessors compile the results for a direct reading.\n\nCobb, 1918 -- Estimating the nema population of the soil, Agricultural Technology Circular 1, pp 1-48.\n\n(1) So as to obtain an even distribution of nematodes within a suspension to aid subsequent counting, it is suggested that air be bubbled through the suspension. A small propeller driven by an electric motor also can be employed for agitating the liquid.\n\n(2) The counting of nematodes using a microscope is facilitated by use of a two-dimensional mechanical stage and by using 2/3 and 1/6 inch objectives.\n\n(3) The use of a spider web for making cross-hair eyepieces is described. It is claimed that when such eyepieces are properly constructed using webs with threads of sufficiently large diameter, the diaphrams can last for years.\n\nDijkstra, 1956 -- Euphytica 5: 298-307.\n\nMethods used for working with Ditylenchus dipsaci infecting red clover are given. Varieties of red clover which are susceptible or resistant to the nematode in a given origin within the Netherlands were susceptible or resistant in about the same degree to nematodes from a different part of the country. Intercrossing local Dutch varieties and selections and the progenies resulted in fairly resistant families.\n\nDimock & Lear, 1950 -- Phytopathology 40: 460-463.\n\nRoot galls caused by Meloidogyne spp.can be counted by floating the washed roots in one inch of water in a moist chamber which then is placed on a black background which adequately reveals the contained galls.\n\nDoncaster, 1962 -- Nematologica 7: 334-336.\n\nBecause active nematodes often move from on division to another of a counting dish, a dish in which the divisions are made by ridges instead of engraved troughs is described. The dish has ten flat-bottomed concentric channels separated by narrow rounded ridges.Nematodes settling on the dividing rided soon fall off into the channels.\n\nDoncaster, Edwards & Shepherd, 1966 -- Nematologica 12: 644.\n\nA labor-saving method for making Fenwick multi-chamber counting slides for nematode counts is presented.
