CEO Revenue Employees 3.1 million 1909 London, UK No Bob Dudley US$ 388.285 Billion (2012) 85,700 (2012) Although founded in 1954 British Petroleum’s roots go back much further. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company was formed in 1909, itself an offshoot of the Burmah Oil Company. It later rebranded to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and then finally to BP. 11 years later the company became the first to strike oil in the north seas Other notable mergers and acquisitions following its privatisation in 1979 / 1987 include Amoco in 1998 and ARCO and Burmah Castrol in 2000. Thanks to its 20,000 plus service stations, BP is one of the most recognisable oil and gas companies. The company rebranded in 2001, dropping its green shield logo in favour of the “Helios” symbol – designed to represent event in all its forms. The company also adopted the slogan \"Beyond Petroleum\" – highlighting their focus on all types of energy and stressing their commitment to a lower carbon future. BP hit rock bottom when the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster became a major global talking point and led to the company pleading guilty on 11 counts of manslaughter, two misdemeanours, and one count of lying to Congress resulting in $4.5 billion in fines- the largest criminal resolution in US history. visit www.OilandGasIQ.com Current CEO Bob Dudley is delivering on his new strategy of selling assets (including its stake in the TNK– BP venture), resolving lawsuits and enhancing efficiency.
