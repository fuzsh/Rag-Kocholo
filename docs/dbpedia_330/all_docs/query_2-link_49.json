        "text": "Introduction\n\nGrape juice from some Australian wine regions (e.g. Sunraysia and Riverland) tends to have high pH (e.g. ≥3.8), which without the process and added cost of pH adjustments during winemaking (Rankine 1998) results in wines with high pH. A high pH of grape juice and wines often results in wine of low quality, such as reduced colour stability and taste (Rühl 1989), and is related to the concentration of potassium (K) in grape juice (Hale 1977, Rühl 1989). The pH of grape juice can be regulated through rootstocks, which restrict the accumulation of K in grapevines (Whiting 2003).\n\nK is an essential nutrient, and plant genotypes, including grapevines, differ in the uptake, transport, accumulation and requirement of K. The differences between rootstocks in the concentration or content of K in the juice of the scion could result from differences in K uptake, transport of K from roots to shoot (Rühl 1989), plant vigour (Hale and Brien 1978) and/or interactions between ions. Although plants adopt multiple mechanisms for K uptake from soil and transport to various tissues (Ahn et al. 2004), the mechanisms/factors responsible for differential K uptake, transport and accumulation into the shoot (or shoot parts) of grapevine rootstocks are not fully understood. The pattern of accumulation of dry weight (as a result of plant growth) and the shoot : roots dry weight may show the transport of particular nutrients and the partitioning of dry weight in the long term (Geiger and Conti 1983). Similarly, plant roots play a predominant role in the absorption and transport of water and nutrients including K. On the other hand, water absorption and transpiration rates have been related to chloride accumulation in Citrus genotypes (Moya et al. 1999). Studies have also shown that rootstocks and graft combinations can affect the hydraulic conductivity and nutrient uptake in grapevines (Bavaresco and Lovisolo 2000). Therefore, the current glasshouse study aimed to determine (i) differences between rootstocks (on own-roots) in total K uptake and accumulation into the roots and shoot, and (ii) possible mechanisms or factors (related to growth, dry matter partitioning, root traits and transpiration) that regulate such differences.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nCutting propagation and establishment\n\nOwn-rooted grapevines of Freedom, Schwarzmann, 1103 Paulsen (1103 P), 140 Ruggeri (140 Ru), 110 Richter (110 R) and 101-14 Millardet et de Grasset (101-14) were propagated from dormant cuttings (four nodes) in a heated sand bed. The clones used were D11V1, R1A2S10, R2A19S4, A5V19, Q45-3A and 2-5-84, respectively. Once the roots had formed (3–4 weeks), rooted cuttings were placed in separate paper bags containing rooting mix, kept in a shade house (25°C) for 3–4 weeks. Lateral shoots from the top two nodes were then allowed to grow. Lateral shoots are referred to here as the fresh measurable shoot growth (whereas the ‘shoot’ referred to the above-ground portion in general, including the main stem and lateral shoots). Each day, cuttings were sprayed with a fine mist of water. Uniform grapevines were then selected for the experiment, based on their stem thickness (5–8 mm), lateral shoot length (15–20 cm) and general size of the grapevine (visual judgement). Selected grapevines were planted in black plastic pots (8 L) containing washed river sand of fine texture, and transferred to a temperature–light controlled glasshouse (25/20°C day/night; 14 h light/10 h dark). To prevent the loss of sand particles from holes in the base of the pot and to allow adequate drainage of nutrient solution, the base of each pot was lined with nylon mesh. The surface of the sand in each pot was completely covered by a thick layer (2–3 cm) of white plastic beads to prevent the evaporative loss of water. Treatments were imposed 1 week after the grapevines were transferred to pots in the glasshouse.\n\nExperimental design\n\nTreatments included the following rootstocks (on own-roots): (i) Freedom, (ii) Schwarzmann, (iii) 1103 P, (iv) 110 R, (v) 140 Ru, and (vi) 101-14. There were six replicates in a completely randomised design.\n\nWatering and nutrition\n\nGrapevines were watered daily with a half strength Hoagland #1 solution (Hoagland and Arnon 1938) containing K at 3 mM. A high concentration of K (>1 mM) in the nutrient solution was chosen to distinguish the accumulation of K between rootstocks (Rühl 1989). This nutrient solution also contained adequate concentration of Ca (1 mM) for the maintenance of functional integrity of the membranes of root cells (Lauchli and Epstein 1970). The nutrient solution was applied in excess (from 1 L on Day 1 up to 2.5 L on Day 56) daily throughout the experiment; the soil was completely saturated with nutrient solution, and then drained. Each day, before nutrients were applied, each pot was flushed with tap water to remove any nutrients (held in free spaces between the sand particles) that remained from the previous day. This avoided differences between treatments in nutrient availability.\n\nWater use (transpiration by the whole grapevine)\n\nTo determine the effect of transpiration by the whole grapevine on K uptake, water use in each treatment was measured weekly, from Day 7 to Day 56 (end of the experiment). Each pot was weighed after complete drainage, and then re-weighed before the next watering. Total water use (total transpiration by the whole grapevine) in each treatment was calculated as the sum of water use from Day 1 (beginning of the experiment) to Day 56.\n\nLateral shoot length and lateral shoot number\n\nThe total length and number of lateral shoots of each rootstock was measured at 14-day intervals from Day 1 to Day 56. The length of lateral shoots (15–20 cm) was similar between the rootstocks when the experiment began (Day 1).\n\nTranspiration rate and photosynthetic rate\n\nTranspiration rate was measured to determine the effect of transpiration by unit laminae on the accumulation of K into the unit shoot, whereas photosynthetic rate was measured (along with transpiration rate) to determine the effect of gas exchange in general on the accumulation of K into the unit shoot. Transpiration rate and photosynthetic rate of laminae were measured for each rootstock replicate on one intact, fully expanded and exposed lamina at Day 56 between 9 am and 11 am with an LCi Portable Photosynthesis System (ADC BioScientific Ltd., Hoddesdon, England, UK).\n\nDestructive sampling\n\nWhen the experiment began (Day 1), three extra replicates of each rootstock were destructively sampled to determine the initial status of K and dry weights of shoot and roots. The experiment ran for 56 days, which was sufficient to distinguish the growth, vigour and accumulation of nutrients between the rootstocks without any major difficulties in handling and maintenance of the grapevines. At Day 56, the shoot portion was cut on a slant with a sharp knife at 10 cm above the base. Each harvested shoot portion was separated into the stem (the woody part), lateral shoots (excluding leaves) and leaves, and then stored in a cold room (7°C). Each pot containing roots plus the remaining stem portion was allowed for the collection of xylem sap by placing under uniform shade (to prevent the xylem sap from drying). Xylem sap was collected from the decapitated stem of each rootstock to enable the measurement of K concentration as a rough estimate of accumulation of K because of root pressure. Sap exudation began roughly half an hour after the stem was cut, and xylem sap was collected for 3 h with the help of a transfer pipette (Samco Sci. Corp., San Fernando, California, USA) from each rootstock. Xylem sap was not sampled after 3 h as some of the rootstocks showed signs of slower exudation. The xylem sap collected from each rootstock was bulked into individual 2-mL eppendorf tubes, and the sap volume was recorded. The xylem sap was then stored at 7°C for nutrient analysis. The remaining stem portion plus the root system were then removed from the pots, and roots were carefully washed with tap water followed by distilled water to remove the adhered sand particles. Washed roots were transferred to the laboratory, and root traits were analysed. Roots and the stem portion were then placed in a cold room with the other harvested parts of grapevines.\n\nAll grapevine parts were then oven-dried (65°C) for at least 3 days. The dry weights of individual parts were recorded, and the samples were then subjected to nutrient analysis. We used shoot : roots dry weight and shoot demand for K per unit root weight (an index for rough estimation of K requirement by the shoot per gram of roots) as estimates of factors responsible for dry matter partitioning, and compared these two factors with the content of K in each of the shoot and roots. Similarly, total length of lateral shoot and relative growth rate (RGR) were used as an estimate of grapevine vigour (Dry and Loveys 1998). There was no apparent measurable growth in the stem (e.g. length or girth increment; data not shown), hence the stem was not considered for any measurements related to vigour. For weight and nutrient determination, lateral shoot referred to the portion excluding the laminae and petiole. Dry weights of the shoot and the whole grapevine, shoot : roots dry weight, RGR and shoot demand for K per unit root weight were determined as follows. Dry weight of the shoot = dry weight of (laminae + petioles + lateral shoots + stem). Dry weight of the whole grapevine = dry weight of the shoot + dry weight of the roots. Shoot : roots dry weight = dry weight of the shoot/dry weight of the roots. RGR = (ln W2 – ln W1) × 1000/(t2 – t1), where W1 and W2 are the initial and final dry weight (each in grams) of the whole grapevine at time t1 (Day 1) and t2 (Day 56), respectively. Shoot demand for K per unit root weight = (S2 – S1) × 1000/(t2 – t1) × ln (W2/W1)/(W2 – W1), where S and W are shoot and roots dry weight (each in grams) at time t1 (Day 1) and t2 (Day 56), respectively (Engels et al. 1992).\n\nRoot traits\n\nThe washed roots for each rootstock were scanned with a flatbed scanner, saved as images (TIFF or JPG format) and then analysed with the software package WinRHIZO.pro v.2003b (Regent Instruments Inc, Quebec, Canada). This root-scanning software determined (i) total root length; (ii) total root surface area; and (iii) the percentage of each of total root length, total root surface area and total number of root tips in each of three classes of root diameter (0.0–0.5 mm, 0.6–1.0 mm and 1.1–4.5 mm). To identify the extent of availability of root length and root surface area to supply K to the whole grapevine, root length and root surface area per unit grapevine weight were each determined as follows. Root length per unit grapevine weight (cm/g) = total root length (cm)/dry weight of the whole grapevine (g). Root surface area per unit grapevine weight (cm2/g) = total root surface area (cm2)/dry weight of the whole grapevine (g).\n\nDetermination of laminae surface area, water use per unit laminae area and water use per unit grapevine weight\n\nEach leaf from each rootstock was further separated into lamina and petiole, and the total laminae area for each rootstock was measured with an area measurement system (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Burwell, Cambridge, UK). Water use per unit laminae area (mL/cm2) was determined as the total water use (mL)/total laminae area (cm2). Water use per unit grapevine weight (mL/g) was determined as the total water use (mL)/total dry weight of the whole grapevine (g).\n\nTissue analysis\n\nOven-dried samples of laminae, petioles, lateral shoots, stem and roots were powdered with a hammer mill (mesh size of 1 mm). Powdered samples were weighed and digested with a 3:1 volume mixture of nitric acid and perchloric acid. The concentration of K in each tissue sample was determined with a flame photometer (Corning, Halstead, Essex, England, UK) and expressed as mg/g dry weight. The concentration of Ca (determined to identify whether the effect of transpiration by rootstocks was specific to K) in each laminae sample on a dry weight basis was determined with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Varian Techtron Pty Ltd., Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia). The xylem sap was diluted 1:10 with distilled water, and the concentrations of K and Na (Na was included to identify whether the effect of root pressure by rootstocks was specific to K) in the xylem sap were each determined with a flame photometer.\n\nCalculations related to K are as follows. Content of K in tissues (mg/tissue) = concentration of K in tissue (mg/g) × dry weight of tissue (g). Content of K in shoot (mg/shoot) = content of K (mg) in (laminae + petiole + lateral shoots + stem). Concentration of K in shoot (mg/g shoot) = content of K (mg) in shoot/dry weight of shoot (g). Total K uptake (mg/whole grapevine) = content of K (mg) in (shoot + roots) at Day 56 – content of K (mg) in (shoot + roots) at Day 1. Translocation efficiency of K = content of K (mg) in shoot/content of K (mg) in (shoot + roots).\n\nStatistical methods\n\nOne-way analysis of variance and correlation analysis of data were performed with SPSS V.12.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Correlation analysis was performed from all the values (n = 36). Means of treatments were compared using the least significant difference test at P = 0.05.\n\nInterpretation of the results\n\nTo determine whether transpiration affects total K uptake in grapevine rootstocks, total water use by each rootstock was compared with total K uptake. Similarly, to determine whether accumulation of K into unit laminae or unit shoot is affected by transpiration, transpiration rate by laminae of each rootstock was compared with the concentration of K in laminae and/or in shoot.\n\nResults\n\nGrapevine growth and/or vigour\n\nThere were significant differences in the dry weights of roots, shoot and whole grapevine, and shoot : roots dry weight at Day 56 (end of the experiment) (Table 1). The differences between the rootstocks in lateral shoot length and lateral shoot number were significant from Day 32 onwards (Figure 1). At Day 56, 1103 P had higher total lateral shoot length (Figure 1), and higher RGR (Table 1) than did 110 R. The pattern of shoot demand for K per unit root weight between rootstocks (Table 1) was similar to that of shoot : roots dry weight (Table 1), and shoot demand for K per unit root weight was higher for 101-14 and 1103 P compared with 140 Ru. There was a positive correlation between RGR and shoot demand for K per unit root weight (r = 0.61, P = 0.05).\n\nRootstock Shoot (g) Roots (g) Whole grapevine (g) Shoot : roots RGR † (mg/g § day) SD/RW ‡ (mg/g § day) Freedom 20.5 4.90 25.4 4.35 18.5 136 Schwarzmann 25.3 4.95 30.3 5.11 19.1 156 1103 P 36.0 6.11 42.1 5.93 26.1 211 110 R 20.2 3.66 23.9 6.71 15.5 146 140 Ru 21.5 4.86 26.3 4.55 16.1 110 101-14 25.5 4.22 29.7 6.29 19.2 187 LSD (P = 0.05) 5.1 1.32 5.8 2.01 4.4 46\n\nWater use, transpiration rate and photosynthetic rate\n\nSignificant differences in the water use by various grapevine rootstocks were apparent from Day 21 of the experiment (Figure 2). The patterns of water use were consistent between the rootstocks throughout the sampling days of the experiment, and the water use was highest for 1103 P and Freedom from Day 21 through to Day 56. As a result, the total water use was higher for 1103 P and Freedom compared with that for 110 R (Table 2). Total water use was correlated with dry weight of the whole grapevine (r = 0.73, P = 0.01).\n\nRootstock TWU † (L/56 days) TLA (cm2) WU/LA (mL/cm2) WU/GW ‡ (mL/g) TR (mmol/m2/s) Freedom 9.14 1095 8.40 364 3.26 Schwarzmann 8.12 1061 7.75 272 2.14 1103 P 10.30 1387 7.73 247 2.36 110 R 7.03 819 8.83 297 2.74 140 Ru 7.98 1125 7.17 306 3.02 101-14 8.06 980 8.37 275 2.37 LSD (P = 0.05) 1.33 254 1.60 50 0.63\n\nDifferences in water use per unit laminae area between most of the tested rootstocks were not significant (Table 2). This is because (i) rootstocks with higher total water use (e.g. 1103 P) also had higher total laminae area (Table 2), and (ii) total water use by grapevines was positively correlated with the total laminae area (r = 0.70, P = 0.01). Rootstock 1103 P had significantly lower water use per unit grapevine weight than did Freedom and 140 Ru (Table 2).\n\nFreedom and 140 Ru had significantly higher transpiration rate (at Day 56) compared with Schwarzmann, but not the other rootstocks (Table 2), whereas there were no significant differences (P = 0.05) between the rootstocks in photosynthetic rate at Day 56 (6.0–8.1 µmol/m2/s). In addition, transpiration rate and photosynthetic rate of laminae were not related to dry weight of shoot (Table 1) and water use per laminae area (Table 2).\n\nRoot traits\n\nBy Day 56, rootstock 101-14 had significantly higher total root length than did 110 R and 140 Ru, whereas 101-14, 1103 P and Freedom had significantly higher total root surface area than did 110 R (Table 3). Rootstocks 101-14 and Freedom also had higher root length per unit grapevine weight (cm/g) and higher root surface area per unit grapevine weight (cm2/g) than did 1103 P (Table 3).\n\nRootstock TRL (cm) RL/GW † (cm/g) TRSA (cm2) RSA/GW † (cm2/g) Freedom 6371 252 1625 64 Schwarzmann 5633 186 1495 49 1103 P 6453 156 1627 39 110 R 4597 193 1023 42 140 Ru 5343 203 1304 49 101-14 7112 239 1550 53 LSD (P = 0.05) 1547 49 371 11\n\nOn the one hand, at Day 56, almost 50% of the total root length (Figure 3a) and 90% of the root tips (Figure 3c) were in the smallest diameter class (0.0–0.5 mm). On the other hand, >50% of the root surface area (Figure 3b) was in the largest diameter class (1.1–4.5 mm). Rootstocks 101-14 and 110 R had significantly higher percentage of total root length and total root surface area in the smallest diameter class compared with that in all other rootstocks. Furthermore, 101-14 also had a significantly higher percentage of root tips in the smallest diameter class than did Freedom, 140 Ru and 1103 P.\n\nAccumulation of K and Ca\n\nAt Day 56, 1103 P and 101-14 had a significantly higher total K uptake and higher shoot content than did Freedom or 110 R (Table 4). However, the high content of K in the shoot of 1103 P was mainly due to its high shoot dry weight (Table 1). Rootstocks 1103 P, 110 R and 101-14 had a higher translocation efficiency of K compared with 140 Ru (Table 4). Rootstock 140 Ru, on the other hand, had a significantly higher content of K in roots than did Freedom, 110 R or 101-14 (Table 4).\n\nRootstock Shoot (mg/shoot †) Root (mg/roots †) Total K uptake (mg/grapevine †) Translocation efficiency of K ‡ Freedom 169 78.8 195 0.68 Schwarzmann 233 84.4 259 0.73 1103 P 350 97.0 391 0.78 110 R 187 65.8 197 0.75 140 Ru 183 107 242 0.63 101-14 257 75.2 280 0.77 LSD (P = 0.05) 56.7 27 65 0.07\n\nAt Day 56, the concentration of K in laminae was significantly higher for 110 R and 101-14 compared with Freedom (Table 5). On the other hand, the concentration of Ca in laminae was significantly lower for Schwarzmannand 1103 P compared with all other rootstocks (mean (in mg/g laminae dry weight): Freedom = 17.4, Schwarzmann = 12.8, 1103 P = 12.7, 110 R = 16.2, 140 Ru = 15.8 and 101-14 = 16.3; least significant difference (P = 0.05) = 1.61). Rootstock 101-14 had significantly higher concentration of K in shoot than did Freedom (Table 5), whereas 140 Ru had a significantly higher concentration of K in roots compared with all other rootstocks (Table 5). As a result, 1103 P and 101-14 had higher shoot : roots concentration of K than did 140 Ru (Table 5).\n\nRootstock Laminae (mg/g laminae †) Shoot (mg/g shoot †) Roots (mg/g roots †) Shoot : roots concentration Freedom 11.3 8.34 16.1 0.55 Schwarzmann 12.4 9.28 17.0 0.55 1103 P 14.0 9.69 16.0 0.61 110 R 16.8 9.31 18.4 0.53 140 Ru 13.8 8.51 22.2 0.39 101-14 15.7 10.20 18.1 0.57 LSD (P = 0.05) 3.46 1.75 3.37 0.15\n\nTotal K uptake was correlated with (i) the dry weight of the whole grapevine (r = 0.90, P = 0.01), (ii) total lateral shoot length (r = 0.65, P = 0.01), (iii) RGR (r = 0.90, P = 0.01), (iv) total root length (r = 0.53, P = 0.01), and (v) total root surface area (r = 0.55, P = 0.01).

There was a significant correlation between the concentration of Ca in laminae (but not for K in laminae or shoot) and transpiration rate (r = 0.55, P = 0.01).\n\nConcentrations of K and Na in the xylem sap and the xylem sap volume\n\nAt Day 56, the concentration of K in the xylem sap was significantly higher in 101-14 than that in 1103 P and 140 Ru (Table 6). There was a significant correlation between the concentration of K in the xylem sap and the concentration of K in the shoot of intact grapevines (r = 0.44, P = 0.05). However, the concentration of Na in the xylem sap was not significantly different between the rootstocks (Table 6). However, the volume of xylem sap was significantly higher for 1103 P than for 110 R (Table 6).\n\nRootstock K (mM) Na (mM) Xylem sap volume (mL/grapevine) Freedom 4.65 0.52 0.40 Schwarzmann 4.55 0.45 0.50 1103 P 3.55 0.32 0.57 110 R 5.31 0.31 0.36 140 Ru 4.08 0.44 0.49 101-14 5.52 0.57 0.52 LSD (P = 0.05) 1.41 NS 0.20\n\nDiscussion\n\nUptake and accumulation of K\n\nThe results (Tables 4, 5) show significant differences between rootstocks on their own-roots in total K uptake and accumulation of K into the roots and shoot. Similar differences between grapevine rootstocks in accumulation of K (Downton 1985, Scienza et al. 1986, Rühl 1989) substantiate the genetic differences between rootstocks in the regulation of K within the plant. Rootstocks 1103 P, 110 R and 140 Ru originated from the same parents. However, total K uptake and accumulation into the roots and shoot differed between these rootstocks, and hence show the highly heterozygous nature of grapevine rootstocks.\n\nA higher concentration of K in roots and a lower translocation efficiency of K in 140 Ru compared with that of 101-14 show restricted movement of K from roots to shoot in 140 Ru. A restricted accumulation of K in the shoots of 140 Ru was also reported by Rühl (1989, 1991). Based on the analysis of K in roots, Rühl (1993) predicted that 140 Ru vines retain more K in vacuoles of roots. Differences between the rootstocks in the content of K in shoot and roots show that the mechanisms of transport of K from roots to the shoot differ between rootstocks.\n\nAccumulation of K into the roots and shoot as affected by dry weight partitioning\n\nThe pattern of dry weight partitioning between roots and shoot of the rootstocks affects the pattern of accumulation of K into the roots and shoot. A link between shoot : roots dry weight and content of K in the shoot of rootstocks (Tables 1, 4) suggests the importance of size of the shoot system relative to size of the root system in the accumulation of K in shoot (i.e. larger the shoot/unit root, higher the increased accumulation of K in shoot). An increase in the content of K in shoot as a result of increase in the shoot : roots dry weight in rootstocks was because of an increase in the translocation efficiency of K (Table 4). A positive correlation between shoot : roots dry weight and translocation efficiency of K in rootstocks supports this view.\n\nThe accumulation of K into the roots and shoot of rootstocks was also affected by the shoot demand for K and the ability of the root system to meet such demand (shoot demand for K per unit root weight). Rootstocks that had higher shoot demand for K per unit root weight also had higher translocation efficiency of K and vice versa. This explains why 101-14 and 1103 P translocated more K from roots to shoot and accumulated more K in the shoot when compared with 140 Ru. A similar increase in the transport of K with increase in the shoot demand for K was reported for maize (Zea mays L.) (Engels et al. 1992). An increase in the shoot demand for K may necessitate higher transport of K from roots and accumulation into the shoot to regulate the shoot metabolism that requires K. On the other hand, the difference between the rootstocks in the corresponding increase in root size (dry weight) is equally important to meet such shoot demand for K and may depend on the ability of the root system to supply K to the shoot. Retranslocation of K from the shoot back to the roots may also depend on the shoot demand for K, that is, when shoot demand for K is low, retranslocation of K from shoots back to the roots is high (Marschner 1995). If this were the case, the greater retention of K in the roots of 140 Ru (compared with other rootstocks) could also result from higher retranslocation of K from shoots back to the roots, in addition to restricted upward transport of K from roots to shoot.\n\nK uptake and accumulation of K into the roots and shoot as affected by growth\n\nUptake of K in the rootstocks (Table 4) depends on the growth and/or vigour of grapevines. Total K uptake in rootstocks was positively correlated with total lateral shoot length and RGR, showing the positive effect of grapevine vigour on K uptake. In the current study, all the rootstocks had increased their total dry weight by four to five times by Day 56 from Day 1 (data not shown), and total K uptake was also positively correlated with the dry weight of the whole grapevine. This suggests the importance of growth and subsequent increase in size of grapevines in total K uptake. However, a higher total K uptake in 101-14 compared with those of Freedom and 110 R, but similar dry weights between these rootstocks, suggests that K uptake is affected by other factors as well.\n\nAn increase in the growth and vigour of rootstocks can increase (i) the shoot demand for K per unit root weight and (ii) shoot : roots dry weight. Therefore, differences between rootstocks in growth and vigour can affect the translocation efficiency of K as well. For example, 101-14 was a more vigorous rootstock compared with Freedom, as measured by lateral shoot length and RGR (Figure 1, Table 1), and also had higher shoot demand for K per unit root weight and higher shoot : roots dry weight. The significant positive correlations between RGR and (i) shoot demand for K per unit root weight and (ii) shoot : roots dry weight support this view. The positive effect of growth and/or vigour on shoot : roots dry weight in rootstocks was mainly because of a greater increase in the shoot weight than that of root weight. For example, from Day 1 to Day 56, 101-14 increased its shoot dry weight more than did Freedom (1.4 times), while the increase in the root dry weight was similar between these rootstocks.\n\nK uptake as affected by root traits\n\nRootstocks that had higher total K uptake (e.g. 1103 P and 101-14) were associated with higher total root length and total root surface area (Table 3). The positive correlation between total K uptake and both total root length and root surface area suggests a role of these root traits in affecting K uptake in rootstocks. Root traits are important for the acquisition of nutrients and water (Bruck et al. 2003). Differences between rootstocks in their density of rooting in the soil profile can create differences between rootstocks in the K uptake capacity (Swanepoel and Southey 1989). A higher root length can lead to greater access of K from soil, thereby enabling greater accumulation of K into the grapevines. Similarly, an increase in root surface area may facilitate higher absorption of K from soil into the roots, as a result of availability of higher absorption surface area for entry of K into the roots.\n\nA higher root length and root surface area in grapevine rootstocks can be the general result of increased size of whole grapevines (e.g. 1103 P) as a result of increased growth, or higher root length and root surface area each per unit grapevine weight (e.g. 101-14). The latter results imply a greater efficiency of 101-14 root systems relative to 1103 P in K uptake. Nevertheless, an increase in the root length and root surface area does not necessarily increase the K uptake (as seen in Freedom), showing the involvement of other mechanisms or factors in the roots in efficient K uptake in rootstocks. For example, 101-14 also had higher percentage of roots in the smaller diameter class (Figure 3). This class (diameter 0–0.5 mm) comprises fine roots that could contribute to most of the water and nutrient uptake of root systems (Tyree et al. 1998). The positive effect of fine roots in increased exploration of soil water and nutrient reserves in woody perennials was similarly reported by Richards (1983).\n\nTranspiration versus K uptake and accumulation of K into the shoot\n\nTables 2 and 4 show that total water use alone does not account for the total K uptake or the accumulation of K into the shoot. On the one hand, a similar total K uptake in some rootstocks (e.g. Freedom and 110 R), but differences in their water use, or water use per unit laminae area, shows that differences in transpiration by (i) the whole grapevine or (ii) the laminae of rootstocks did not lead to differences in total K uptake. On the other hand, a similar water use between rootstocks (e.g. Freedom and 101-14), but differences in total K uptake, as well as K uptake into the shoot, suggests that K uptake depends on other factors that are not related to water use.\n\nThe similarities between the patterns of water use and of total K uptake in rootstocks (in particular 1103 P) were because of the general effect of grapevine size on both total K uptake and total water use, but not because of a direct effect of total water use on total K uptake. The significant correlations between total laminae area and total water use, and between dry weight of the whole grapevine and total K uptake or total water use support this conclusion. That is, the relative differences in K uptake between rootstocks were because of the differences in either (i) the dry weight of the grapevine or (ii) other factors that are independent of transpiration.\n\nSimilar to the effects of water use on K uptake, a poor relationship was observed between transpiration rate (at Day 56) and the accumulation of K into the shoot and/or laminae (at Day 56) of rootstocks (Tables 2,5). These data were further supported by the lack of significant correlation between transpiration rate (at Day 56) and (i) concentration of K in both shoot and laminae, and (ii) shoot : roots concentration of K (at Day 56) of rootstocks. In contrast, the positive relationship between transpiration rate and concentration of Ca in laminae (each at Day 56) shows the importance of transpiration for the accumulation of Ca into the shoot parts. The positive effect of transpiration on the accumulation of Ca was previously observed by Rühl (1992) in grapevine rootstocks on own-roots. We conclude that transpiration rate by laminae is less important for the accumulation of K than for the accumulation of Ca into the shoot or laminae.\n\nThe effect of rootstocks on transpiration and effects of transpiration on transport and accumulation of K into the shoot parts in own-rooted rootstocks are not clearly understood. No similar study on grapevine rootstocks appears to be available, and the results from other crop species have not always agreed with our study. For example, Brag (1972) found a negative relationship between transpiration rate and concentration of K in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and in pea (Pisum sativum L.) grown in nutrient solution, while transpiration was closely related to the influx of Rb (tracer for K) (Jensen and Petterson 1980). On the other hand, entry of K into the roots of intact barley plants was independent of transpiration rate (Hooymans 1969). These results on other crops and the results in the current study suggest that water use or transpiration rate does not account for the accumulation of K (in the whole grapevine or whole shoot, unit laminae or unit shoot) in rootstocks grown on own-roots.\n\nPhotosynthesis versus accumulation of K into the shoot\n\nTransport of K and subsequent accumulation of K into the shoot of rootstock were not affected by the photosynthetic rate. A lack of significant relationship between photosynthetic rate and (i) shoot : roots concentration of K, or (ii) concentration of K in laminae or whole shoot, further supports this conclusion. A similar non-significant effect of rootstocks on the photosynthetic rate of scions was previously reported in grapevines (Williams and Smith 1991). However, rootstocks can affect the photosynthesis of scion varieties in woody perennials (Schechter et al. 1991, During 1994). Nevertheless, irrespective of rootstocks, the poor relationship between concentration of K in shoot and photosynthetic rate shows that photosynthesis rate is of little importance in the accumulation of K into the shoot of grapevine rootstocks on own-roots.\n\nRoot pressure versus accumulation of K into the shoot\n\nThe positive relationship between the concentration of K in the xylem sap (Table 6) and the concentration of K in the shoot (Table 5) suggests a possible role of root pressure in the accumulation of K in the shoot. The differences between rootstocks in the concentration of K (but not Na) in the xylem sap show the relative differences in their xylem loading of K. The volume of xylem sap collected, on the other hand, shows the net transport efficiency of nutrients (Marschner 1995) and reflects the relative differences in the root pressure exerted by rootstocks on upward transport of K from roots. In the current study, rootstocks with a higher content of K in the shoot (Table 4) also had a higher total xylem volume (Table 6). Therefore, root pressure appears to influence net transport and accumulation of K to the shoot. The xylem sap was collected from the cut stem, so transpiration was prevented. Therefore, it seems that transport of K from roots to shoot depends on root capacity in xylem loading (Tanner and Beevers 2001). The results in the current study highlight the lack of significance of transpiration, but possible role of root pressure, in the accumulation of K in the shoot of grapevine rootstocks on own-roots at the end of the experiment (Day 56). Further studies with more frequent measurements (e.g. weekly) on these factors would be highly beneficial and would quantify the extent of involvement of both transpiration and root pressure in the accumulation of K into the grapevine rootstocks at various stages of growth and development. Further studies are also needed to understand the role of each rootstock in the regulation of K in grapevine when grafted to a scion, and the mechanisms related to such regulation."
