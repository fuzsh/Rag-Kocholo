        "text": "Post-diapause embryos (cysts) of the brine shrimp Artemia continue to be one of the most intensely studied anhydrobiotic systems (for reviews, see Crowe & Clegg, 1973; Clegg, 1981, 1984). In a previous communication, we examined mechanisms involved in the cessation of carbohydrate catabolism in dehydrated Artemia cysts from the Great Salt Lake (Glasheen & Hand, 1988). When hydrated, developing embryos were dehydrated by immersion in 5·0 mol 1−2 NaCl, trehalose metabolism was inhibited at the series of reactions catalyzed by trehalase, hexokinase and phosphofructokinase. Intracellular pH (pHi) appeared to play no part in these metabolic transitions, in contrast to its pronounced regulatory role in Artemia embryos undergoing transitions into anaerobic dormancy (Busa et al. 1982; Busa & Crowe, 1983; Carpenter & Hand, 1986; Hand & Carpenter, 1986; Utterback & Hand, 1987; Hand & Gnaiger, 1988). Thus, entry into the quiescent state of anhydrobiosis in Artemia seems to be a strict function of cellular water content, as initially proposed by Clegg (1964, 1974, 1976a,b).\n\nOne deficiency currently preventing investigators from testing various mechanisms involved in dehydration-induced arrest of metabolism is the lack of a comprehensive analysis of the internal osmolyte system for Artemia embryos. Without such information, it is impossible to estimate the ionic and organic solute concentrations present in the embryo at the onset of metabolic arrest. Yet, in over two decades of research into the Artemia system, many of these important constituents of the intracellular milieu have never been quantified. The few values available (amino acid, trehalose, glycerol, sodium content; Emerson, 1967; Clegg, 1967 ; Conte et al. 1977) are taken from different populations of embryos and are often expressed in ways that make it difficult to estimate internal concentrations (e.g. per mg protein).\n\nWith the use of open-flow microcalorimetry, we characterize in this paper the dehydration-induced metabolic arrest in Artemia embryos from the Great Salt Lake population. Metabolic heat dissipation is a sensitive measure of total energy flow in the embryo (see Hand & Gnaiger, 1988) that can be applied in experiments where dehydration is accomplished with concentrated salt solutions. Use of calorimetry avoids the technical difficulties that arise when oxygen consumption is chosen as a means to estimate aerobic metabolism in solutions approaching saturation with NaCl; electrolyte solutions within the polarographic oxygen electrodes dehydrate under such conditions (Hale, 1983).\n\nWe relate the measured transitions in energy flow to the values for internal water content of embryos determined under identical experimental conditions. When the hydration values are coupled to the quantitative analyses of all major intracellular solutes, it is possible to estimate the composition of the internal milieu of these embryos at any point along the graded series of dehydration. Potential mechanisms for metabolic arrest are considered in the light of these new findings. Metabolic arrest may possibly be the result of disruption of macromolecular assemblies (e.g. enzyme-cytostructural interaction) owing to the elevated ionic strengths of intracellular contents in dehydrated embryos.\n\nMetallic ion content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Cysts were washed and then dechorionated to eliminate artifacts due to ion entrapment in the porous, acellular chorion. Embryos were filtered onto Whatman no. 41 paper, samples placed in tared crucibles, and dried to constant mass (24 h in a 60°C oven). Cysts dried in a 60°C oven exhibited little additional mass loss over embryos dehydrated 72h over CaSO4. Additional mass loss = 0·85 ± 0·17% (S.E.M., N = 18). Dry mass was measured, and embryos were placed in a Lindberg muffle furnace overnight at 550 °C. The resultant ash was suspended in 5 % HNO3. After addition of lanthanum oxide and cesium chloride, solutions were brought to a final concentration of 7·5mmol1−2 CsCl, 1% La2O3 and 0·5% HNO3. The suspension was then centrifuged at 4000g for 10 min. Supernatants were decanted and analyzed for ions. An additional wash of the pellet was not necessary for complete ion extraction.\n\nSodium was measured in a Varian Techtron atomic absorption spectrometer at 589·0 nm using an air-acetylene flame. Potassium was determined at 766·5 nm using the air-acetylene mixture. Magnesium was quantified at 285·2 nm with acetylene-N2O as fuel-oxidant, and calcium was measured at 422·7 nm, again with nitrous oxide as oxidant. Calibration curves were generated from standard solutions (Environmental Protection Agency, US).\n\nFor inorganic phosphate and chloride analyses, the dechorionated cysts were filtered onto Dura Wipes and excess moisture wicked away. Two samples of approximately equal mass were removed and wet masses obtained. One sample was used for ion analysis, while a similar portion was dried to constant mass. For phosphate analyses, samples were homogenized in 5 ml of 6 % perchloric acid and centrifuged at 10000g for 15 min. Supernatants were neutralized with 5 mol 1−2 K2CO3 and centrifuged again to remove perchlorate salts. Inorganic phosphate was determined with a modified version of the Piper & Lovell (1981) method. The colorimetric reagent was made by adding 37·5 g of guanidine-HCl to 25 ml of a 7·5% ammonium molybdate/2·5mol1−2 H2SO4 solution. This mixture was brought to a final volume of 100 ml with a 20 mg m1−2 bovine serum albumin solution. The reagent was added 3:1 (v/v) to both samples and standards, and after 30 min the absorbance was measured at 370 nm. For chloride measurement, samples were homogenized in deionized water and centrifuged at 10000 g for 15 min. After addition of Ba(OH)2 and ZnSO4 to final concentrations of 0·025 mol 1−2 and 1 %, respectively, supernatants were then left at room temperature for 48h to precipitate interfering materials. Following centrifugation, supernatants were analyzed with a Haake-Buchler digital chloridometer.\n\nResults of hydration studies are presented in Table 2 (series I) and Table 3 (series II). For series I data, our Great Salt Lake cysts were prepared identically to the San Francisco Bay embryos in the studies by Clegg (1974); i.e. embryos were hydrated in the experimental solutions directly from the dry state. Differences in hydration behavior in response to external salinity exist between the two populations. The differences occurred primarily in the 1·0 and 2·0 mol 1−2 NaCl incubations (Table 2); values were identical at the higher NaCl concentrations. These observations become particularly important when comparing the metabolic responses to dehydration between the two populations (e.g. relating microcalori-metric results with previous measurements of respiration).\n\nSeries II data are from embryos pre-hydrated in 0·25 mol1−2 NaCl and then exposed to the increasing salt series (Table 3); this approach is the more practical for our metabolic studies. Note that in series II, embryos were effectively being dehydrated in order to reach the final hydration values, while in series I, the embryos were initially dry and gained water to reach the final hydration values. This directional difference in water movement apparently altered the final hydration levels obtained at 24 h; the water content was higher in embryos from series II. The reason for this difference has not been determined, but we suspect that numerous air spaces and channels in the chorion influence in some way the rate of embryo hydration versus dehydration. Preliminary studies indicated that hydration properties are markedly different with dechorionated embryos (data not shown).\n\nFinally, the ‘corrected’ hydration levels presented in Table 3 represent estimates of the actual water content of the metabolically active embryonic tissues. These data, in combination with the microcalorimetry results, showed that energy flow was severely disrupted when embryo water was reduced to 70–85 g H2O 100 g−2 dry mass. This water content compares well with critical hydration levels required for the onset of carbohydrate catabolism and respiration, when corrected in a similar fashion (70 g H2O 100 g−2 dry cyst; Clegg, 1976a,b).\n\nThe results of the present study characterize more fully the metabolic arrest and the alterations in internal solute composition that occur as Artemia embryos enter and exit the state of anhydrobiosis. The use of microcalorimetry improves our understanding of these transitions by providing an estimate of total energy flow in the embryo. The comprehensive inventory of intracellular solutes, in conjunction with embryo hydration values, offers an opportunity to estimate more precisely the status of the internal milieu at the critical hydration point where metabolic arrest begins. Considering the numerous metabolic studies performed with Artemia embryos, it is surprising that a complete characterization of the internal osmolyte system has not been available until now. We will discuss below selected possibilities as to how changes in intracellular solution conditions might bring about the metabolic arrest observed during restricted water availability.\n\nOur measurements of heat dissipation show that total energy flow is acutely suppressed when water content of the metabolically active tissue falls to 85 gH2O 100 g−2 dry mass. At 70gH20100g−2 dry mass and below, heat dissipation has dropped to only a few percent of the control (0·25 mol1−2 incubation) values or, in absolute terms, 0·14–0·26 mW g−2 dry mass. During the quiescent state induced by anaerobiosis, Artemia embryos exhibit similar values during short-term (several hour) experiments (Hand & Gnaiger, 1988), although the mechanism of the arrest is apparently quite different. Substantial evidence supports a primary role for acidotic pHi in anaerobic dormancy; but during dehydration, metabolic arrest proceeds normally under conditions where pHi does not change (Glasheen & Hand, 1988). Both these forms of hypometabolism are fully reversible. Upon restoration of intracellular water, energy flow in embryos rises rapidly and dramatically to levels comparable to those in fully hydrated, developing embryos (Figs 1, 2). In previous studies, embryo respiration and trehalose usage displayed similar patterns (Clegg, 1976a,b;Glasheen & Hand, 1988).\n\nTraditional views regarding this metabolic arrest in Artemia entering anhydrobiosis have centered upon the role of water in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of metabolic pathways. Minimum water content has been established for San Francisco Bay embryos that permit the onset of various metabolic functions (for a review, see Clegg, 1981). Hydration values for Great Salt Lake embryos have not been available heretofore, but now some interpopulation comparisons can be made. Critical hydration levels necessary for the onset of major metabolic events are similar for each population. A water content of 70 g H2O 100 g−2 dry mass is needed for respiration in the San Francisco Bay population (Clegg, 1974), while 70–85 g H20100 g−2 dry mass is required for substantial heat dissipation in Great Salt Lake embryos (Table 2; Fig. 1). However, differences in hydration response are seen in solutions of low ionic strength. This metabolic shutdown observed during progressive dehydration/re-hydration has been explained by perturbation of ‘vicinal’ or protein-associated water (Clegg, 1984). Cellular regions of vicinal versus bulk water were described by Porter (1986) as ‘protein-rich’ and ‘water-rich’ phases, and this distinction was suggested by experiments performed as early as 1938 (Kopac, 1938; Chambers, 1940). In the present study, there is at least indirect evidence that the properties of intracyst water may be quite different from those of the external medium. For example, the difference between external and internal osmotic pressure for embryos incubated in 5·0 mol 1−2 NaCl approaches 10000 mosmol kg−2H2O. It is unlikely that a lack of osmotic equilibrium can explain this discrepancy, but rather that much of the intracellular water is restricted and not osmotically available.\n\nWhile interpretations based on solvent status have proved highly useful, the important corollary of intracellular solute content has been relatively neglected vis à vis metabolic organization and control in Artemia. As a direct consequence of reductions in cell-associated water, intracellular solute concentrations rise dramatically. In Artemia, as water activity decreases to the critical level (as demonstrated by metabolic arrest), the concentration of inorganic ions approaches 500 mmol kg−2 H2O. In most marine species studied, levels above 100–200 mmol kg−2 H2O of univalent ions are severely deleterious to enzyme function, as judged by lowering of reaction velocities as well as elevation of Km (Borowitzka & Brown, 1974; Bowlus & Somero, 1979; Yancey et al. 1982). In addition to these direct influences on enzyme function, evidence suggests that protein binding to subcellular components may be disrupted by elevated levels of inorganic ions. In mammalian muscle, the adsorption of the glycolytic enzymes aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase to an F-actin-tropomyosin-troponin complex was significantly reduced in 150 mmol 1−2 KC1 (Clarke & Masters, 1975). Likewise, 150 mmol 1−2 NaCl resulted in desorption of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Band 3 protein in erythrocytes (Yu & Steck, 1975). Mammalian brain hexokinase, in its more active ‘bound’ form, is almost completely solubilized in 350 mmol 1−2 KC1 or NaCl (Wilson, 1968). Partitioning of enzymes into soluble and particulate fractions (with differing kinetic properties) or altering the cohesiveness of metabolons (multienzyme associations) are attractive models for effective means of metabolic regulation (for reviews, see Welch, 1977; Kurganov, 1985; Welch & Keleti, 1981; Srere, 1987; Ovadi, 1988; G. N. Somero & S. C. Hand, in preparation).\n\nThus, in dehydrated Artemia, ionic perturbation of protein-protein or protein-cytoskeletal interactions may account for at least part of the observed metabolic arrest. Previous experiments have indicated simultaneous inhibition of three major enzymes during the glycolytic shutdown in dehydrated embryos, namely trehalase, hexokinase and phosphofructokinase (Glasheen & Hand, 1988). The catalytic properties of Artemia trehalase are significantly altered by modifications of macromolecular assembly state (Hand & Carpenter, 1986). While Artemia hexokinase does not reversibly associate with isolated mitochondria (Rees et al. 1989), as does the rat brain homologue, we have preliminary evidence that phosphofructokinase does bind to a particulate fraction in homogenates of these embryos (J. S. Glasheen & S. C. Hand, unpublished observations). The fact that the dehydration-induced metabolic shutdown in Artemia is fully reversible is consistent with the above view of metabolic organization. Such non-covalent assembly/disassembly transitions could alter enzymic function without compromising native protein structure. Indeed, it seems reasonable to suggest that conservation of macromolecular integrity is an important prerequisite for organisms capable of undergoing such drastic reductions in cell-associated water.\n\nIt is well established now that many organisms that frequently face water stress possess systems of ‘compatible’ solutes (Brown & Simpson, 1972), i.e. compounds either non-perturbing or actually stabilizing to macromolecular structure and function (Yancey et al. 1982; Somero, 1986). Generally, these organic solutes are either uncharged or zwitterionic, and quite often structurally resemble the stabilizing ions of the Hofmeister series (Clark & Zounes, 1977). Our analyses of intracellular solutes in Artemia reveal significant levels of methylamines (50-127 mmol kg−2 H2O, depending on hydration state), a family of compatible solutes known to exert stabilizing influences at concentrations as low as 50mmolkg−2H2O (e.g. Hand & Somero, 1982). In addition, as dehydration reaches critical levels in the Artemia embryos, concentrations of the osmolytes trehalose and glycerol exceed 1000 mmol kg−2 H2O. In the case of biological membranes, Crowe et al. (1987) have suggested that trehalose serves a ‘water replacement’ function, stabilizing membrane structure through physical intercalation with phospholipids. In combination with transition metal ions, trehalose also protects proteins against denaturation incurred during freezing (Carpenter et al. 1986) and drying (Carpenter & Crowe, 1988).\n\nBased on the comprehensive inventory of embryo solutes presented herein, we suggest that the role of intracellular osmolytes should be more fully integrated into hypotheses explaining the dehydration-induced arrest of Artemia metabolism. At low water activities, concentrations of inorganic ions rise appreciably, which could result in the disruption of protein-protein associations and the attendant loss of metabolic function. The substantial quantities of the organic solutes trehalose, glycerol and the newly detected methylamines may be involved in fostering reversibility of these anhydrobiotic bouts by preventing macromolecular denaturation during drying. Our current in vitro studies are incorporating these solute data to quantify the relative influences of inorganic and organic osmolytes on protein assembly state. The eventual goal is to clarify the importance of the internal milieu in regulating metabolic events, not only in terms of solvent interactions but also in terms of the nature and quantity of critical solutes."
