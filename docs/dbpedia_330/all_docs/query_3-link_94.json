        "text": "My wife and I own a 2005, currently with 145K miles. At 130K, it began to burn oil, maybe 1 quart per 2K miles. That rapidly deteriorated, to 1 quart of oil per 800 miles, by 142K miles. No leaks. No (e.g.) smoke upon startup, or smoke upon hard acceleration.\n\nWent to the dealer, hoping it might be something simple, such as a bad PCV valve.. What we heard back was \"the rings are so carboned up they hardly make contact with the bore, and there is lots of blow-by\". Dealer's advice was either a) $5400 for an engine rebuild, or b) start saving for a new car.\n\nI had never heard of rings being carboned up that badly. Carbon? We'd had what I thought was a problem with knock (pre-ignition) around 120K, but the dealer said otherwise. Barring that, this was the first inkling of upper-cylinder carbon issues on this engine.\n\nBefore trashing the car, I decided to try whatever seemed reasonable to decarbon the upper cylinder. Lined up my options. Of the options available, dumping Techron concentrate into the gas tank seemed a) cheap, b) had some evidence of effectiveness, and c) was easy. Other options (Seafoam, various oil additives) were either a lot more work, or seemed like a lot more risk.\n\nUnderstanding that Techron worked slowly, I bought enough for ten tanks. I figured, ten tanks of Techron, and if that didn't do it, I'd throw in the towel.\n\nSix tanks later, I can say, this worked. Over the last 1K miles, oil went from full, to a hair under full. That is, oil consumption ( 5 w 20, did not move to thicker oil) has stopped.\n\nGas mileage remains at near-new levels. Recent round trip, Washington DC to Richmond, averaged 49 MPG, with a considerable fraction of that at 75 MPH with no drafting.\n\nSo, this worked. I don't really understand why it worked. I am just attesting to the fact that it did. I completely realize that the oil control ring is at the bottom of the piston body. I don't really understand why de-carbonizing the upper cylinder could possibly matter that much for oil consumption.\n\nI just want to say that, if you are in this situation, you might consider a few tanks with Techron concentrate, before tossing in the towel on your high-oil-consumption Prius.\n\nIn summary:\n\nWe went from modest oil consumption (1 quart / 2K miles) to high oil consumption (1 Q/800 miles) in short order. There was no obvious smoking at startup or on hard acceleration. There were no leaks. The dealer said \"carboned rings\", but offered no further useful advice. We tried consecutive tanks of gas with Techron concentrate added. Not because it was the obvious choice, but mostly because it was easy. And that appears to have resolved the problem.\n\nObviously, if you're burning oil due to worn rings, bore, or valve guides, this isn't going to help. But in our case, it was due to upper cylinder carbonization. Really, to carbonization of the rings. And Techrnon appears to have fixed that. For us.\n\nIn the U.S. Gen 2 is spec'd for 5W-30, Gen 3 for 0W-20. Generally it's not a problem to go up in viscosity of oil (as long as it's not extreme, e.g. putting 20W-50 in a Gen 3). The thicker oil will slow oil leaks, though not cure them. The price you'll pay is harder cold starting and slightly reduced fuel economy (on the order of 1-2%). However often oil leaks get gradually worse over time, so doing so is an engine life extender, and usually not a cure. However if you can squeeze another 20-50k miles out of an engine just from using thicker oil, I'd consider that worth it. For a high mileage Prius leaking oil, I'd try 10W-40 on a 2nd gen or 5w-30 on a 3rd gen for an oil change and see if it slows the leak, and perhaps change back to the recommended grade for wintertime, depending on the climate.\n\nKeep in mind a lot of oil leaks/burning are caused by gasket leaks, and using Techron won't solve oil leaks with this cause."
