Event is scheduled from 10 am – 2 pm\n\nStart Time: 10\n\nDate: 2013-5-18\n\nThe Natchez Trace Parkway Association commemorated the bicentennial of the 1813 Natchez Expedition on the Natchez Trace Parkway through a ten-day living history event from Natchez to Nashville. The event re-created events from the landing of the troops at Natchez and the parade through the city, the encampment at Fort Dearborn, camp sites at Brashears’ Stand and the Choctaw Agency, a ceremonial crossing of the Tennessee River at Colbert Ferry and the dismissal of the troops at Grinder’s Stand. Along the way, ceremonies were held in the Old Mississippi State Capitol building and at the War of 1812 Memorial Site, Tuscumbia and the Hermitage. A period reception for the troops was held at the Natchez Prentiss Club and a period dinner was hosted at the Eola Hotel. Ladies held an 1813 tea at Auburn Historic House. Education camps reached about 2,000 students in Mississippi.\n\nTupelo, MS: Join a Park Ranger for a Wildflower Walk on Saturday, May 4, 2013, at 10:00 am at the Chickasaw Village Site (milepost 261.8 on the Natchez Trace Parkway near Tupelo, Mississippi).

During the Parkway’s 75th anniversary celebration on May 18, 2013, musicians will lead visitors on a musical journey from the Appalachians to rock ‘n roll.\n\nThe morning will begin with the National Anthem, sung by Jackson, Mississippi’s Dr. Lester Senter, Mezzo Soprano. Dr. Senter’s vocal repertoire extends to over 60 roles, and she has appeared with leading opera companies and symphonies across America and abroad.\n\nThe North Mississippi Dulcimer Association will lead off the musical sets showcasing the first stringed instrument developed in the United States. The dulcimer, a name that means “sweet sound,” has roots that can be traced back to the early 1800s. The group is dedicated to preserving the arts of making and playing the instruments.\n\nPickin’n Grinnin’, a Tupelo bluegrass band from St. Luke United Methodist Church, will play a style of American-roots music inspired by the sounds of Appalachia. With fiddles, banjos, guitars, bass, and vocals, the group will have visitors tapping their toes.\n\nRedoak Grove Missionary Baptist Church choir, an 18-person group directed by Choir President Mary Rainey, will perform a variety of traditional gospel songs. The spiritual movement has had a strong influence on music—past and present.\n\nTo round out the musical talent, Jack Curtis, an Elvis Presley stylist, will present “The Wonder of Elvis.” Curtis will recreate the energy and excitement of Elvis’ hits in a tribute that will have everyone reminiscing about a special period in Parkway traveling days. Curtis has been performing for over 20 years, and placed in the top five in the “World Images of Elvis” competition.\n\nVisitors are encouraged to bring blankets or chairs for the free open air concert. Music will be presented from 11:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m.\n\nThe Natchez Trace Parkway was established as part of the National Park System on May 18, 1935.

It’s a 444 mile historic road from Natchez, MS to Nashville, TN through beautiful scenery, curvy roads, history, interesting stops, minimal traffic, places to stay and good restaurants. What else could you ask for?\n\nDuring this time of year, spring is the perfect time to hop on a motorcycle and take a relaxing drive on the Trace. The wildflowers are blooming and the trees and grass are a beautiful, bright green color. The weather is just right during the spring–warm enough to ride but not too hot yet.\n\nTraffic is generally light and there are often more motorcycles on the road than vehicles. You don’t have to worry about stop signs or stop lights… just keep cruising, enjoy the scenery and the wind blowing through your hair. The Parkway is clean and smooth, so you won’t be tackling bumpy roads.\n\nAll along the Trace in Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee you’ll find historical and nature attractions. Take a break, notice the gorgeous nature that surrounds you and learn a little history at the designated mileposts. Numerous side roads take you past antebellum and victorian homes, sunken roads, civil war battlefields and southern towns.\n\nIf you’re feeling hungry, restaurants are located just off the Trace in our corridor communities.

Special honor was given to Roane Fleming Byrnes, who served as president of the Association from 1934 to 1969. A plaque was unveiled at her grave. The Natchez Trace Ball, a popular fundraiser in the early years, was recreated at the Natchez Eola Hotel, with music from the period. Returning to the same porch at Brandon Hall where the ceremony was held in 1937, the Association honored its early founders whose vision and persistence made the parkway dream a reality. The Memorial Park area on the parkway, created during the 1937 inaugural event with treess planted by the states and by the U.S. and Mexican governments, was restored. A 75th Anniversary tree was planted near the remaining 1937 tree, planted by New Orleans Times-Picayune editor George Healey in 1937, Mrs. Byrnes neices,, and Mr. Hollis, who was present at the 1937 ceremony, assisted in the planting. Also, as in 1937, a barbeque at Brandon Hall concluded the event. Thanks to the Garber family for their hospitality at Brandon Hall.\n\n.\n\nOn the bicentennial of U.S. declaration of war against the British, the U.S. Daughters of 1812 dedicated a monument honoring the soldiers who marched and died on the Natchez Trace during the war. Superintendent Cam Sholly announced that the site would be renamed the “War of 1812 Memorial Site.” A large stone wall separates the site from the parkway and creates a contemplative space on the hilltop. The visitor is guided by the road and a sidewalk to the crest of the hill along a section of the old trace where the monument may be viewed.\n\nThe Natchez Trace Parkway Association, in partnership with the 7th U.S. Living History Association and the National Park Service, began a four-year living history program on the parkway to re-enact events associated with its role in the War of 1812. Captain John Gordon’s house and ferry site was the location of the Memorial Day 2012 event “Muster on the Natchez Trace 1812.” As in the spring of 1812, a muster was held of volunteer militia, when word arrived that a settler had been taken hostage. A debate ensued over whether the nation should go to war. Military recruiters enlisted volunteers, as fife and drum musicians created a patriotic mood. A period church service was held before the soldiers marched from their families to meet the enemy. A memorial was held for Captain Gordon. Members of his family were present. Captain Gordon was the Captian of the Company of Spies for Andrew Jackson. General Jackson sent Gordon as the sole spy into Spanish-held Pensacola. Based upon the intelligence that Captain Gordon provided, Jackson attacked Pensacola. Jackson noted that Captiain Gordon frequently moved to the front of action during battle. Gordon moved with his family from Nashville to the ferry site in 1812, as war was threatened.\n\nThe Natchez Trace Parkway includes about 65 miles of completed Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail in five segments. The Natchez Trace Parkway motor road is part of the National Bike Trails System. In addition, there are miles of multi-use trails for cycles.\n\nHiking trails range from short distances over generally level surfaces to trails several miles in length through hilly terrain. Both provide good opportunities to experience the distinctive topography and nature of each state, to relax and to get fit.\n\nBoating is available on the Tennessee River and canoeing is popular on the Buffalo and Duck rivers. Sail boating and other boating are popular on the Ross Barnett Reservoir.\n\nSelect specific topics to learn more about recreation on the Natchez Trace Parkway.\n\nThe Association is a member of the Partnership for National Trails Systems, a non-profit organization comprised of over 33 national parks and national scenic trails.\n\nThe Association is developing a traveling exhibit that tells the fascinating story of the Natchez Trace and Natchez Road. The exhibit will be available to non-profit organizations in towns along the parkway. The exhibit will form the core of a larger display that incorporates the history of the town and its association with the road. Participants will be encouraged to develop some of their own Trace-related displays that will last beyond the temporary exhibit.. To learn more about participating in the exhibit, contact info@natcheztrace.info.\n\nMuch of the history of the Natchez Trace is yet to be uncovered in archives, court houses and attics. A long- range Association goal is to create a digital collection of original source materials to enhance the understanding and interpretation of the Parkway. To participate in the program, please contact info@natcheztrace.info\n\nThe best introduction to history is to experience it. The Association supports the National Park Service living history program, and it is developing a new program, through which it often partners with the parkway to bring history to life. Throughout the year, historic sites such as the Gordon House, Colbert’s Ferry, Mount Locust and Grinder’s Stand come to life with the sights and sounds of the period when the Natchez Trace and Natchez Road were important transportation corridors. The National Park Service began a living history program on the parkway in the 1970’s. The annual Meriwether Lewis Arts and Crafts Festival, which includes living history demonstrations, is approaching its 40th year. Encampments at Mount Locust have focused on portrayals of life in the southern Mississippi area along the Natchez Trace. Regular living history events are scheduled at headquarters .\n\nThe association is developing a new living history program to provide additional living history events along the parkway. In 2012, we entered into a partnership with the National Park Service and the 7th U.S. Living History Association to begin a four- year commemoration of the bicentennial of the War of 1812. Those events have prevented education stations to a few thousand school children in the three Natchez Trace states.\n\nMany of those school children gave the event their “awesome” stamp of approval.\n\nWe are also developing relationships with the Chickasaw Nation and the Choctaw Nation to present accurate portrayals of their historic homelands. We support the annual Oka Kapasa Festival in Tuscumbia. Each September, they bring together Creeks, Chickasaws, Choctaws, and other American Indians to celebrate their American Indian heritage, and the close relationship the Tuscumbia community along the old Natchez Trace developed with the American Indians.\n\nAn active living history program along the parkway will make history real for younger generations and utilize the rich historic resources that relate to the old road and its communities.

The U.S. War Department authorized Jackson to appoint an engineer and procure equipment in 1816 and Congress appropriated $5,000 to begin construction. The Military Road was built by about 300 American soldiers over a three-year period at a construction cost of $300,000. When completed on May 17, 1820, the new road was 483 miles long and 200 miles shorter than the old Natchez Trace route. Crossing the Tennessee River at Florence, it entered Sheffield (first known as York Bluff) at “Jackson Hollow.” The road then passed near Atlanta and Columbia Avenues as it moved southwest. The Military Road entered Tuscumbia on Dickson Street and passed near this site.The nearby single-pen hewn-log cabin is a vestige of Tuscumbia’s pioneer period. It originally stood on the opposite side of the street and reputedly served as a stagecoach stop on the Military Road. Dickson Street was named for early Tuscumbia settler Michael Dickson. A U. S. Mail line was established and John Donley Sr. of Tuscumbia was given the contract for carrying the mail. Stagecoaches could travel the Military Road in 17 days and stands were built along the way to accommodate travelers. The road became the route over which pioneers poured into northwest Alabama and Mississippi.\n\nIts the Bicentennial of the building of the road. We are trying to assemble a small group of like minded Living Historians to depict the actual surveying and building of the road. Possible persons needed are:\n\n-District of Nashville Soldiers from the 1st and 8th infantry\n\n-An artillery detachment who supplied the labor\n\n– Civilians portraying the Dickson family, the first settlers\n\n-Captain H. Young surveyed the route\n\n-Chickasaw guides\n\nChief Tuscumbia\n\n-Hugh Finley Blacksmith\n\n-David Keller\n\n-Col. James McDonald\n\n– William Russell\n\n-Gen John Coffee\n\n– Ferdinand Sannoner\n\nPlans are for there to be being Living history programs through out the day on Friday April 22, 2016 in Spring park to school groups. Afterwards A period seated dinner , by candlelight, for the Living Historians in a Homestead of this era with costumed servants. After the evening meal, perhaps music and dance of the time frame, then a discussion on how to grow this living history event into a full blown events for the upcoming year 2017-20. On Saturday April 23, 2016, demonstrations at the log cabin, which is located on the original Military Road, on surveying and public interactions discussing the Military road construction.\n\nContact Tony Turnbow, Annie Perry, or Lisa Pace at info@natcheztrace.org.\n\nFor more information on Natchez Trace Parkway Association Living History, contact info@natcheztrace.org\n\nTUPELO, MS – The Natchez Trace Parkway will recognize National Park Week, April 20-28, 2013, and National Junior Ranger Day with the annual “Celebrate Wildlife Weekend” on Saturday, April 20, at the Natchez Trace Parkway Visitor Center from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.\n\nAll exhibitors and events will be outdoors and include:\n\nTerry Vandeventer’s educational, fun, live snake program: “Snakes of Mississippi” at 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m.\n\nOther exhibitors include the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Mississippi State University, the Bear Education and Restoration Group of Mississippi, and the Mississippi Bat Working Group\n\nWildlife Discovery hike along the Beech Springs Nature Trail\n\nA special Junior Ranger Day Scavenger Hunt\n\nThis program is free to the public.

The bicyclist was hospitalized with severe injuries and his bicycle was also damaged.\n\nRangers are seeking the community’s assistance in identifying the assailant. The suspect vehicle is described as a late model white crew cab pickup truck, possibly a Dodge, and the suspect was a white male in his 40s to 50s with short gray hair and a stocky build. The suspect would have been traveling south along the Parkway on Sunday afternoon about 4:00 p.m. The assault occurred in the northeastern corner of Lee County between Saltillo and Mantachie near mile marker 276.\n\nA reward of $500 is now being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect involved in this assault. Anyone with information should contact 662-680-4002.\n\nRangers would also like to talk with a witness driving a possibly dark colored four door sedan who was seen at the scene. This person may have important information that could assist with the investigation.\n\nThe Natchez Trace Parkway is a National Scenic Byway, which encourages multiple uses and recreational activities, including scenic motoring, bicycling, hiking, running and other activities.\n\nOn May 18, 1938, the Natchez Trace Parkway was created to commemorate a historic travel route that had existed for about 10,000 years–and is still going strong. Come celebrate!\n\n75th Anniversary Celebration on Saturday, May 18, 2013\n\nThe Natchez Trace Parkway will be celebrating its 75th anniversary on Saturday, May 18, 2013.

At the Battle of New Orleans, American militiamen and U.S. Army Regulars fought side by side with American Indians and free men of color to defend their common homeland. General Jackson insisted that American Indians and men of color be paid the same amounts as the militiamen, and some held positions of high rank.\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, leaders of the new American republic preferred to rely on volunteer militias rather than a large standing army. All men were expected to muster and train throughout the year to be prepared to defend their homes and their country. Cavalry officers were generally farmers, professionals and businessmen. Officers wore uniform similar to those worn by officers in the U.S. army. Most soldiers in the War of 1812, like today’s military, were in their late teen and early twenties; however, each company was led by a group of musicians, and drummers were sometimes as young as twelve. The drummer’s beat served as a form of communication.\n\n1812 A NATION ON THE BRINK OF WAR\n\n1813 EXPEDITION NATCHEZ\n\n1814 PREPARING TO ENCOUNTER THE BRITISH\n\n1815 VICTORY AT NEW ORLEANS AND RETURN MARCHES ON THE NATCHEZ ROAD\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF WAR OF 1812 SITES ALONG THE PARKWAY\n\n0. Natchez- Andrew Jackson’s infantry landed in a flotilla on the Mississippi River on Feb. 15, 1813, and marched through the town to Fort Dearborn to join the cavalry which had marched down the Natchez Road. In 1814 and 1815, Natchez served as a supply depot and hospital for the war effort. A victory ball was held for Jackson in Natchez at the end of the war.\n\n5.1 Camp Jackson – Just south of this site in 1813, Andrew Jackson established Camp Jackson, an encampment for the 2,070 Tennessee volunteers called to aid in the defense of the Gulf Coast. The men trained here to prepare to meet the enemy in New Orleans. In early March, Jackson received a letter from the War Department ordering him to dismiss his men in the field. Jackson disobeyed the order and borrowed funds to return his men home. That decision and the determination Jackson demonstrated on the return march earned Jackson the nickname “Old Hickory” (as in “tough as an old hickory tree”), a nickname which he later used to win the presidency.\n\n8.0 Historic Jefferson College- (off parkway on Hwy. 61). The site of Washington, the capital of the Mississippi Territory, and Fort Dearborn. Mississippi dragoons mustered there in September, 1812. Jackson’s troops camped there before moving to Camp Jackson. British Prisoners of War from the Battle of New Orleans were housed there before being exchanged. A victory ball was held for Jackson in Washington at the end of the war.\n\n15.5 Mount Locust- In 1813, Natchez Expedition troops fell ill soon after departing Camp Jackson, and they made an emergency encampment at Selsertown, across from Mount Locust. The Ferguson family tradition held that Jackson stayed in the house now known as “Mount Locust.” In 1815, a hospital for infirm troops was established at Selsertown. A victory ball for Jackson was held in nearby Greenville.\n\n100.7 Choctaw Agency- Troops camped near the agency complex on all marches. In 1815, Jackson’s aide-de-camp purchased 200 horses from the agency for the return marches. Choctaw Chief Pushmataha refused Shawnee Chief Tecumseh’s proposal to form an alliance against the Americans. The Choctaw Nation supplied soldiers to serve under Jackson’s command in the Creek Wars, at Pensacola, and at the Battle of New Orleans.\n\n104.5 Brashears’ Stand- In 1814, a shortcut road was cut from the Natchez Road near this point as a direct route to Lake Pontchartrain and New Orleans. Colonel Coffee attended courts martial at the stand in October, 1814. In 1815, about 300 infirm soldiers were treated at the stand until they were well enough to march. Six rooms were rented to physicians.\n\n108.7 French Camp- Louis LeFleur’s inn provided accommodations to detachments of soldiers, and some soldiers died at the inn. They were buried at French Camp. The DAR marker on the parkway commemorates the site for its role in the War of 1812.\n\n175.6 Cole Creek- The swamp a Cole Creek is typical of the swamps troops encountered during the rainy winter and spring marches. One wrote that they sometimes walked for miles in water up to their waists.\n\n241.4 Chickasaw Agency – At the Chickasaw Agency in 1813, Colonel Coffee discovered that government contractors had not supplied food as planned. Chickasaw Chief George Colbert drew on his nation’s winter food supply to feed the soldiers. Coffee wrote, “I find that we shall want for nothing while traveling through the nation.” Soldiers began to rely on the Colberts to provide corn for food for soldiers and horses. On the 1813 return, the even greater number of soldiers began to run out of food. When Jackson’s request for support from the Tennessee governor was denied, he wrote an angry reply about 13 miles south of the agency, “are these brave men…. to be left a pray (sic) to the Vultures…” Nashville citizens borrowed funds to buy food for the soldiers. They would be greeted with wagons loaded with food and horses near the Tennessee line.\n\n261.8 Chickasaw Village Site- Soldiers camped near the Chickasaw Old Town. A second prong of the Natchez Road, built through Tennessee toward Fort Massac, intersected near this point. Some returning soldiers formed separate detachments near this point and marched northwest along the new route.\n\n283.3 Donivan Slough/Brown’s Bottom- This wetland area challenged wagon travel on the road during wet seasons. In 1815, wagons carrying food supplies south on the road to give relief to the soldiers could not pass Brown’s Bottom. Soldiers often went hungry on the marches.\n\n320.3 Buzzard Roost- Chickasaw leader Levi Colbert maintained an inn at Buzzard Roost. Chickasaw tradition holds that Levi Colbert fought in the Battle of New Orleans. It was near this point at the mouth of Bear Creek in spring 1812, Creek rebels brought Martha Crawley, a settler, as hostage from Tennessee. George Colbert intervened with the Creeks to seek the rebels’ arrest. The incident spurred a war fever in Tennessee, and Tennessee federal legislators became part of the War Hawks to seek a proclamation of war. In the 1813 southbound march, Coffee told his men at Bear Creek, “We are a band of brothers who are to share and share alike.”\n\n327.3 Colbert Ferry- Shawnee Chief Tecumseh met with the Chickasaw Chiefs at Colbert Ferry in 1811 to seek their alliance in a war on the Americans. The Chickasaw king told Tecumseh that if his American friends died, he would die too. Another counsel was held here in spring 1813 among the Chickasaws, Choctaws and Cherokees to determine which side they would support in the upcoming war. Colbert made his friendship to the Americans clear. Colbert ferried troops across the river throughout the war, and troops stayed at his inn. In 1814, the U.S. Army occupied the ferry to defend it against a possible attack from Creek rebels. Also in 1814, Colonel Coffee met with Levi Colbert here to recruit Chickasaw volunteers. Chickasaw warriors joined the U.S. war effort and served to patrol the former Creek nation.\n\n327.8 Tennessee River- Crossing the Tennessee River was one of the primary challenges for the troop marches. The small ferry accommodated only a few of the hundreds of troops at a time, and divided troops were more vulnerable to attack. Colonel Coffee, who led the march of the cavalry in the 1813 expedition, and for whom this bridge is named, ordered troops arriving on the south side of the river to line their tents along the bank of the river, apparently to make it appear to potential attackers that the force was larger in number.\n\n382.8 McLish’s Stand- George Colbert’s son-in-law John McLish operated a inn for travelers and a mill at this site. McLish provided food for soldiers. On Jackson’s return in 1815, he stayed at McLish’s. A postal road to Columbia intersected the Natchez Road at this point in 1812.\n\n386 Grinder’s Inn- A soldier on the return march in 1813 noted that the Chickasaw boundary was located about ten paces from the door of Robert Grinder’s cabin. Once troops crossed that border, they had returned home. Tennessee histories state that a number of troops were dismissed here, and some soldiers who did not survive the marches are buried here. The returning soldier in 1813 recorded that his detachment enjoyed breakfast at Grinder’s Inn and then walked to Meriwether Lewis’s grave.\n\n390.7 Dobbins Stand/Swan Creek- Captain David Dobbins operated a stand near this point, where the 1808 Columbia Turnpike intersected the Natchez Road. In 1813, the cavalry camped at Dobbins Stand on the southbound march and the men spent the evening shelling corn to provide food for their horses until they reached the Tennessee River. Troops traveling east toward Columbia on the return likely exited the Natchez Road at this point. Andrew Jackson traveled immediately to Columbia on the 1813 return to make arrangements to pay the troops. A number of troops were dismissed in Columbia.\n\n400.2 Sheboss/ Kegg Stand- A widow maintained an inn at Kegg Springs. Returning chaplain Learner Blackman wrote of her hospitality.\n\n407.7 Gordon Ferry- Captain John Gordon moved his family to this site in 1812 near the outbreak of war. He was a military man, and he became the captain of Jackson’s Company of Spies. He ferried about 5,000 Tennessee and Kentucky soldiers across the Duck River. In 1814, when Jackson faced a mutiny of his volunteers, Gordon spoke first to quell the mutiny, and helped save Jackson’s career. Gordon was sent as the sole spy into Pensacola. The intelligence he reported led to Jackson’s invasion of Pensacola, which was then held by the Spanish.\n\n426.3 War of 1812 Memorial- This site is one of the largest War of 1812 memorials in the nation. It was designated as the War of 1812 Memorial site on the bicentennial. The stone wall separates the area from the parkway to provide a contemplative space. The loop and walk lead to a preserved section of the old Natchez Road and a monument placed on the bicentennial of the War of 1812 by the U.S. Daughters of 1812. The monument honors all soldiers who marched during the war and pays particular honor to those who did not survive the marches. Soldiers are buried in unmarked graves along the old road. As Jackson returned in 1815, the citizens of Franklin met him on the road and asked him to give a speech. He proclaimed the meaning of the victory that foreign powers would henceforth respect the rights of Americans.\n\n428. Leiper’s Fork- Originally known as Benton Town and Hillsboro, the town was founded along the Natchez Road by the mother of Jackson’s 1813 aide-de-camp Thomas Hart Benton. The Benton home site is marked. Benton or his brother shot Jackson (both claimed credit) in a brawl on the streets of Nashville soon after the 1813 return. Jackson suffered the effects of the wound throughout the remainder of the war. Benton served under Jackson again in 1814, and their friendship later renewed. When Benton became a U.S. senator from Missouri, he cast an important vote against President Jackson’s impeachment.\n\n444. Nashville- The Natchez Road ran east of the terminus by the Belle Meade Plantation (off parkway on Hwy. 100). The Belle Meade Planntation property contains the cbain that was Natchez Trace Post Rider Benjamin Joslin’s Natchez Trace stand, before it was sold to John Harding. Cavalry marching south stopped at the stand and used the services of Harding’s blacksmith. The December 10, 1812 rendezous of Andrew Jackson’s volunteer militia took place near the Broawday and Seventh Avenue area, and campsites stretched as far north as Sulphur Dell. Jackson reviewed troops on the Public Square, and he spoke there on his return from the Natchez Expedition. A victory dinner was held for Jackson at a tavern on the Public Square in 1815.\n\nThe Natchez Trace Parkway was created, in part, to preserve the story of the Natchez Road in the War of 1812. The military road built by the U.S. army provided for the movement of soldiers and supplies from the settled areas of Tennessee and Kentucky to the Gulf Coast.\n\nRecognizing the need to protect access to ports in Natchez and New Orleans, President Thomas Jefferson instructed the military to build a federal wagon road along the old Natchez Trace in 1801. President Jefferson sent the first militia down the road in 1803 to ensure Spain’s acknowledgement of the Louisiana Purchase.\n\nThe road proved its utility when British forces threatened to invade New Orleans in 1812. General Andrew Jackson mustered volunteer militias. Cavalry under the command of Colonel John Coffee marched down the Natchez Road to Fort Dearborn near Natchez. Jackson’s troops were dismissed by the War Department, and he borrowed funds to return them home. It was on that return journey that Jackson earned the name “Old Hickory.”\n\nThe road continued to be developed for military use. A shortcut road was cut from the Natchez Trace to Lake Pontchartrain above New Orleans. During 1814, the Chickasaw and Choctaw nations supplied volunteers to aid the American war effort. In fall 1814, when Jackson learned that the British were sailing toward the Gulf Coast with over 12,000 troops, he ordered fresh recruits be sent from Kentucky and Tennessee, and that they be marched down the Natchez Road to defend New Orleans. Because of the difficulty the troops experienced in the marches in 1813, Jackson’s aid-de-camp made a late decision to send most of the recruits to New Orleans by river; however, detachments of cavalry marched down the Natchez Road toward New Orleans.\n\nThe decisive Battle of New Orleans and the war itself forged a new American spirit and led to the settlement of what became the American South. Many of the officers in that battle became southern political leaders, and the victory propelled Jackson to the White House.\n\nThe Association has partnered with the National Park Service and the 7th U.S.Living History Association to commemorate the War of 1812. We are telling the story of the Natchez Trace and the years when those who lived near it were called on to defend their homes. The information we gather and the programs we create will last beyond the bicentennial to become a permanent part of the information available to visitors. The stories of heroism and sacrifice in what has been called the “forgotten war,” will serve as a catalyst to give new life to the history of the Natchez Trace and a better understanding of the important role it played in the independence and development of the United States.\n\nFor more information on upcoming and past events, click on the War of 1812 Bicentennial tab again and select the Events box that will appear to the right.\n\nFor more history about the War of 1812, including highlights for a driving tour, click on the “More History- War of 1812 Bicentennial” tab on the right.\n\nThe Tombigbee Pioneer Group will perform living history demonstrations that show the challenges faced and creative solutions developed by those Americans who lived in the area from the 1700s to 1840. The demonstrations will take place at the Natchez Trace Parkway Visitor Center (located at milepost 266 near Tupelo, Mississippi) from 10:00 a.m. – 3:00 p.m. on Saturday, March 23, 2013. The public is invited to watch pioneer lifestyle activities that often include corn-shuck doll making, basket weaving, beading, and quill pen demonstrations. Leatherworking and mountain dulcimer demonstrations will also be offered throughout the day. Children are invited to participate by dressing up in pioneer clothes and trying these activities firsthand.\n\nThis program is free to the public. For additional information, please call the visitor center at: 662-680-4027 or 1-800-305-7417.\n\n-NPS-\n\nThe parkway contains about 65 miles of trails that are part of the Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail.

The soil was carried by wind to the area from the banks of the Mississippi River. Because the land surrounding the trail is private, please stay on the trail. The southern trail head at mile post 17 is not recommended for RV’s because of the narrow access road and lack of turnaround space. Hikers will walk through water at stream crossings.
