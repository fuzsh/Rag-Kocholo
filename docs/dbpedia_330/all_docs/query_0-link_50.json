        "text": "What Is Mylar Film?\n\nMylar film is a colorless, transparent plastic film.\n\nIt is manufactured by biaxially stretching a polymer resin called polyethylene terephthalate (PET).\n\nA mylar film has excellent chemical and water resistance, high strength against mechanical deformation, and insulating properties.\n\nMylar film is also highly transparent and hardly expands or contracts at room temperature. It is used not only as a film for design and drafting but also as an insulating material and as a window material for vacuum equipment.\n\nUses of Mylar Film\n\nMylar film has excellent chemical and water resistance, high tensile and bending strength, and insulating properties.\n\nMylar films are used as a highly reliable film for designing and drafting because it is less likely to be damaged, torn, or ripped by water, chemicals, etc., and because they hardly expand or contract at room temperature, they do not shift or deform.\n\nIn addition, its high mechanical strength is utilized as a window material for vacuum equipment used in scientific experiments.\n\nMylar films are also used as electrical insulation film, capacitor material, and chemical insulation film.\n\nPrinciple of Mylar Film\n\nMylar film is produced by biaxially stretching polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a polymer resin made by polymerizing ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid. The product is manufactured by biaxially stretching polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer resin.\n\nThe name \"mylar film\" was originally a trade name for a plastic film commercialized by DuPont in the United States in 1954.\n\nToday, many other companies' products are in circulation, including not only \"mylar film,\" but also \"polyester film\" and \"PET film,\" as well as \"Lumirror,\" which was commercialized by Toray Industries, Inc. of Japan. Lumirror\" commercialized by Toray (Japan) is also available as an equivalent material.\n\nIt has excellent chemical and water resistance, high tensile and bending strength, and insulating properties.\n\nThe greatest advantage of this material is that these properties are stable over a wide temperature range of -76°F to 302°F (-60°C to 150°C) without loss of stability."
