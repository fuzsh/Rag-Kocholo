In a reverberant room, two similar sounds reach a subject’s ears from different directions, with one sound following the other after a short delay; yet the subject fuses them into a single sound and localizes this sound based on the source of the first sound to reach the ears. The authors study this perceptual phenomenon, which they term the “precedence effect,” and which is also referred to as the “Haas effect” or the “law of the first wavefront.”\n\nZwicker, E. (1957).

Perception & Psychophysics, 35 (1984): 565-569. Using a display that combined a stimulus for auditory stream segregation with its visually apparent movement analog, these Stanford University researchers demonstrated cross-modal influences between vision and audition on perceptual organization. Subjects hearing the same auditory sequence perceived it as two tones if a concurrent visual sequence was presented that was perceived as two moving dots, and one tone if a concurrent visual sequence perceived as a single object was presented.\n\nPatterson, B.

A curious phenomenon which has surfaced repeatedly since the late Baroque era has come to be known as synaesthesia. It was used by the Romanticists of the nineteenth century as an effective means to enrich their accounts of sensuous impressions. Other names for the phenomena include chromesthesia, photothesia, synopsia, color hearing, and color audition. People who have this characteristic experience a crossover between one or more sensory modes. Thus, they might be blessed with the ability to hear colors or odors, or see sounds. People who habitually perceive stimuli in this manner are often surprised when told that not everyone shares this faculty. Color hearing, though only one form of synaesthesia, is probably the commonest.\n\nSeashore, C. E. (1938). The Psychology of Music. New York: McGraw-Hill.\n\nYates, A. J. (1963).
