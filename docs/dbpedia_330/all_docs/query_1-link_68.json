        "text": "Forest soils of the Moravian-Silesian Beskids are exposed to increasing acidification and podzolization. These conditions developed historically due to climate and parent rock material but also as a result of changes in forest management practices. Recently, acid depositions appear as a crucial factor. Predominating soil types are typical Cambisol or dystric Cambisol, acid or podzol varieties. Soil pH is acid up to very acid with the lowest values in the Oh layer (pH/H2O 3.5â€“3.8). pH values of the B horizon range between 3.9 and 4.5. Base saturation of the soils amounts to about 10%. So far conducted studies in the region have not proved the hypothesis on the relationship between the degree of forest stand damage and soil conditions but indicate that the soil conditions can act as a long-term predisposing stress factor particularly when Mg, Ca or N are in deficit."
