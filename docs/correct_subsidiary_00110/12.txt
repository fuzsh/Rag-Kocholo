Sun Microsystems paid $224 million for three companies in the second half of 2003 as part of its push into software, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company spent $23 million for Pixo, $65 million for CenterRun and $136 million for Waveset, according to Sun's quarterly report filed Thursday. The acquisitions were all announced and closed in the second half of the year.

The acquisition costs of Pixo and Waveset were not stated earlier, while CenterRun had previously been pegged at $66 million.

The SEC filing also reiterates the difficulties Sun has been facing. In the second half of 2003, revenue declined to $5.4 billion from the $5.7 billion reported in the second half of 2002. Net losses came to $411 million, compared with a $2.4 billion loss for the second half of 2002, a figure that included several charges.
