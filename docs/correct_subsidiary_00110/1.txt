Sun Microsystems Inc. before the end of this quarter plans to release its own version of the CenterRun provisioning technology it acquired last year.

Sun officials said last week that the first release won’t have a major feature enhancement, but instead will give the provisioning software, which is key to Sun’s N1 strategy, the look and feel of other Sun products. It will also serve as a bug fix and provide improved integration, they said. Sun gained the technology when it acquired Redwood City, Calif.-based CenterRun in August.

Meanwhile, Sun’s effort to simplify data centers received a key user endorsement last week from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts.

The Boston-based health care provider is adopting Sun’s Java Enterprise System (JES), which for an annual set fee of $100 per employee delivers an integrated software stack that includes Sun’s directory, application and portal servers .

BCBS of Massachusetts has about 3,300 employees.

Frank Enfanto, vice president of operations delivery and information security at the health care organization, said JES “gives us the ability to be predictable in what our costs are and simplifies our software purchases.” The alternative was to work with individual vendors and then try to integrate the applications, he said.
