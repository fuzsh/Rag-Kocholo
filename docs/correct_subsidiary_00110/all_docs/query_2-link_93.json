        "text": "Lake Center Run near Turkey Creek is temporarily closed in both directions and expected to reopen around 1:30 pm this afternoon.\n\nA low pressure gas line was hit, but no injuries occurred. Centerpoint did not mark the line as required which led to this incident. Centerpoint is on-site and in the process of repair right now. Only one home has lost gas service and Centerpoint will restore that individual.\n\nAs soon as the repair is completed, road service will reopen.\n\nThank you for your patience.\n\nHC MUD 341"
