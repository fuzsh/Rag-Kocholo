        "text": "MEET Aaref\n\nAaref Hilaly joined Sequoia as a partner in 2012 after founding CenterRun and Clearwellâboth of which attracted Sequoia as the lead investor. From Pakistan and raised in England, he moved halfway across the world to Silicon Valley because, he says, âI just wanted to try building something of my own.â\n\nWhat is something youâve learned that you lean on daily?\n\nTo be present. Iâve learned to train my mind to focus on what Iâm doing in the momentâbecause if I donât, it tends to wander. Iâll find myself composing emails while Iâm reading a bedtime story or thinking through an unrelated problem when I should be listening to a presentation. Without focus, I end up running harder and not getting nearly as far. Plus, staying present forces me to be more disciplined about how I choose to spend my time in the first place. If youâre going to give something 100 percent of your attention, it had better be worth it.\n\nTo keep myself focused, I try to develop healthy habits like turning off notifications and resisting the urge to compulsively check my email. I also take a moment before meetings to think about how I want to approach it and what Iâd like to learn. I think the key is to see your mind as a separate entity from yourself that can be trained, just like you train your body.\n\nWhat one piece of advice would you give someone starting a company?\n\nDonât do itâunless you have to. Everything about starting a company is hard. When I co-founded CenterRun with Schrep and Basil, there were so many obstacles. Even worse were the doubts about whether anyone will see the value in it or want to join us. And the second one, Clearwell, was just as tough. I remember telling my wife, âIf I hadnât already done this once, Iâd think it was impossible.â So starting a company should be less a choice and more something you do because youâre compelled toâbecause thereâs something that you believe has to exist, and starting a company is the only way you can make it happen.\n\nOnce youâve decided to go for it, though, Iâd say, âDonât overthink it.â Some things are must-haves, like co-founders with whom you share values, and an unmet need that can give you a foothold in the market. But beyond those basics, you have to get comfortable with uncertainty. The future is complex and impossible to predict, and you just have to let things play out and see what happens.\n\nWhat small change has made a big difference in your life?\n\nGoing to bed 30 minutes earlier. A while back, I listened to a podcast about sleep and the things you can do to improve itâlike sensory deprivation, going to bed at the same time every night and keeping the room cold. For me, the one that worked was going to bed at 10:30 p.m. instead of 11 and getting seven hours of sleep instead of six and a half.\n\nThe better I sleep, the sharper and more engaged I feel and the more I enjoy my day. It helps me make the most of that golden time in the morning, when itâs easier to think clearly about difficult things. For me, sleep is a performance-enhancing drug.\n\nWhat don't you know that you wish you knew?\n\nOn a personal level, I wish I knew more about how to engage with each person I care about at each stage of their life. Weâre all constantly changing, and so are the people we love. With kids, for example, you engage with a 5-year-old much differently than a 15-year-old, and feeling out those transformations can be a challenge.\n\nIn the context of work, I wish I always knew the correct level of knowledge I should gather and analyze before I make a decision. When you go too deep, everything looks hard. After we sold CenterRun, for example, I knew the data center space so well that I overestimated the difficulties of other opportunities, like open-source virtualization, and I think that held me back from dreaming as much as I should have. But there are also times when you donât go deep enough and miss things that should be obvious. The necessary depth depends on the issue, and itâs a difficult thing to get it right, but Iâm always working on it. No matter your role, I think exercising good judgment and making good decisions is the most important thing you can do.\n\nWhat books are on your nightstand right now?\n\nI just finished Being Mortal, by Atul Gawande, which is essentially about dying and how to think about it in the same way we think about health and life. Now Iâm rereading Sapiens, by Yuval Noah Harari, because thereâs so much good stuff in that book that I couldnât take it all in the first time aroundâfrom how humans have moved up the food chain as every other animal moved down, to how humanity and our four primary sources of protein literally outweigh everything else on the planet. Iâm also starting How to Change Your Mind, by Michael Pollan, which examines psychedelic drugs and how they came to be associated with the counterculture. I like books that challenge conventional wisdom. You often find itâs only been conventional for a short period of time.\n\nI also like to do what I call âcommunal reading.â Right now, my nine-year-old and I are working our way through the Harry Potter books together, and my wife and I are both reading Small Great Things, by Jodi Picoult. My wife picked that one out, which is part of the funânot only do we get to talk about it as we go, but Iâm reading something I wouldnât otherwise choose.\n\nWhen did you realize you were wrong about something?\n\nIâve been wrong about plenty of specific decisionsâthe future is so hard to predict; I donât know how anyone could possibly be right all the time. What comes to mind for me is a more fundamental change in the way I think. I used to see things in pretty black-and-white, binary terms. âThis will work,â or âThat wonât.â Now, I think more in terms of probability. âHow likely is a version of a future in which this product will be significant, or that things will break a certain way?â\n\nThinking probabilistically reinforces a sense of humility that I believe is part of being a VC, because none of us knows the future. When you recognize that fundamental uncertainty, it eliminates absolutist thinking.\n\nWhat unit of time matters the most and why?\n\nFor an entrepreneur, I think itâs the shortest unit of time from which you can get meaningful data that could lead you to change course. In an enterprise business where deals could take six months to close, we judged ourselves in 90-day increments. A consumer business might be monthly or weekly.\n\nPersonally, I find it most helpful to think in terms of weeks, because thatâs the unit within which I try to balance my time. When it comes to work, Iâm balancing meetings and email with taking time to read and exploreâbeing proactive rather than just reactive. But Iâm also balancing work with personal time, whether itâs talking with my 15-year-old on the way to school or calling my mother. If you havenât had a meaningful conversation with someone you care about in more than a week, that should give you pause."
