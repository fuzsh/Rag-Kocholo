        "text": "What is a virtual race?\n\nA virtual race is an event where you sign up and participate on your own by selecting your own course anywhere you'd like! You can run, jog, or walk on the road, on the trail, on the treadmill, at the gym, or on the track. You get to run your own race, at your own pace, and time it yourself.\n\nThe event will feature a leaderboard so you can still see how you stack up against your fellow competitors!\n\nDo I have to run at a certain time?\n\nYou have between Sat June 15 - Sat June 22, 2024 to complete your run. Of course, you can run at the same time the rest of us will be running (8:00 AM) on Saturday, June 22 from anywhere you'd like!\n\nWhen do I need to submit my results?\n\nYou should submit results right after completing your run. Remember, you will be timing yourself, so you must have a device capable of doing so at the time you begin.\n\nHow do I submit my results?\n\nYou will receive an e-mail on race weekend with instructions on how to submit via e-mail or text. You will also be able to submit your results right on our race website by going to the Race Results page, then clicking the Submit Virtual Results button.\n\nWhen will I get my swag?\n\nWe want to see you, and we'd like you to visit the centers! So, stop by whichever center you live closest to (Kinston or New Bern) and pick up your goodies and/or race medals on Tuesday, April 20. If you can not get to us we are prepared to mail your swag and/or winnings!\n\nHow do I get my finisher certificate?\n\nGreat job on finishing the race! Once you've run and submitted your results, there will be a button on your results page that says \"Certificate\".\n\nWhat charity does the event support?"
