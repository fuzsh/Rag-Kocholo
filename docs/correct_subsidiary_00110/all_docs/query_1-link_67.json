        "text": "The career aisle on Amazon is flooded with career advice. I’ve sifted through much of it, but the climate of the job market can change quickly. What was once good advice is now outdated like spoiled milk.\n\nAs I’ve been reflecting on my own career, I’ve taken inventory of my strengths and weaknesses. The reflection breeds questions. Should I get an MBA? What criteria should I consider as I’m planning my career? I need to make informed decisions to make the right investments in my career.\n\nI asked Greylock’s Dan Portillo for career advice because he’s been helping startups build amazing teams at a leading venture capital firm based in Silicon Valley. Greylock manages over $2 billion dollars and they’ve invested in consumer internet companies like LinkedIn, Facebook, and enterprise software companies like Cloudera and Skyhigh Networks.\n\nPrior to Greylock, Dan led recruiting at Mozilla and eventually ran all of HR while growing the company from 20 to over 300 employees. He’s worked at several early stage startups, including CenterRun, which was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 2003. Uniquely, they had a high density of talent that included Aaref Hilaly (previously CEO of Clearwell and now Partner at Sequoia) and Mike Schroepfer (CTO of Facebook). The company was incubated by Reactivity where Dan met John Lilly (previously CEO of Mozilla and now Partner at Greylock). Dan acknowledges that the network he’s cultivated early on in his career has been incredibly valuable over time.\n\nWatch on Forbes:\n\nThink of your career over an extended period of time.\n\nMany people make reactive career moves and only think about the next job. He strongly advises to think about your end-state and long-term goal and how you can fill in the gaps over time.\n\n“If you make short-term trade-offs you’re going to pay for it later,” he says. You should be focusing on investing in your skill set and making yourself as valuable as possible, some candidates make a mistake by the focusing on the difference of 10% in compensation early on. Dan explains that it’s a delayed gratification with pay. If you’ve invested in yourself your money making years are in your late 30s and 40s. “Make sure you’re not artificially setting a cap by making the wrong decision too early,” he says.\n\nHow long should you be in your job?\n\n“In The Alliance, Reid Hoffman discusses the contract between the employee and the employer. Your tour of duty should be between one to three years in the role. You should explore changing your job, not necessarily your company after that time,” Dan explains.\n\nThe reason to make the change is because around the three-year mark it’s often diminishing returns in regards to the additional skills or value you’re going to gain by staying in the role. This could vary depending on the role.\n\nDan setup a leveling system as Mozilla to progress people through the organization often leaving at the top. They were able to keep people between four to five years on average which was extraordinary. As a result, someone like Mike Schroepfer exited the company to become the VP of Engineering at Facebook (now CTO).\n\nThree questions to ask yourself.\n\nAm I on the right team?\n\nIn some cases, the team you’re on is more important than the company you work for. The team may have autonomy from the rest of the organization, and possibly more visibility depending on the responsibility. If you’re on the wrong team it’s hard to win. Vet future team members not only by reviewing their social presence but by requesting to speak with them during the interview process.\n\nAm I working for the right manager?\n\nSimon Sinek says we’ve confused rank and leadership. They are not the same thing. He explains that he knows many people who sit at the highest levels of an organization who are not leaders. We do as they say because they have authority, but we would not follow them voluntarily.\n\nDo as much homework as humanly possible to understand what kind of leader or manager you’d be working for. Make sure to create a list of qualities you’re looking for to understand if that manager is a match for you. I was once doing preliminary research about a potential manager. The recruiter described traits of the manager that were red flags for micromanagement. Take it with a grain of salt, but have a clear vision of the kind of leader you want to work for.\n\nAm I solving the right problem?\n\nI’ve seen startups that have had multiple rounds of funding who are solving the wrong problem. Often times they are looking at their industry with a blind spot and should have pivoted long ago. Solving the wrong problem for too long can be catastrophic.\n\nHow should you assess the next company to work for?\n\nWhile attending UCLA (with 35,000 students) Dan realized that he probably would have thrived in a smaller environment. At work, it’s also important to understand what environment best suits you. For example, Dan explains that Google and Facebook are almost extensions of a college because they are now large companies with much structure.\n\n“For those out of college it's optimal for some structure and some level of ambiguity. At large companies you’re often waiting in line for long promotion cycles. At a smaller company if there’s a business need to help launch the company in a new market, you just do it,” Dan declared.\n\nMid-stage company defined.\n\nMany candidates I speak with are looking to work for a mid-stage company that’s mature enough to have job security and upside for growth potential. Mid-stage does not mean having 250 employees necessarily.\n\n“A mid-stage company has product/market fit where they have demonstrated sustained growth. They have a reasonable idea of what needs to happen, but they don’t exactly know how it’s going to happen,” he explains. It was becoming clear to me hearing Dan’s philosophy. The mid-stage company has a proven product but typically hasn’t expanded globally. They have plenty of upside, but are probably a few years away from recognized their potential.\n\nSubsequently, Dan debunked my myth about employee size. “The team size matters more than the size of the organization in some cases. The funding round doesn’t give you much clarity. I know companies with seed funding that are further along in business maturity than companies that have raised multiple rounds of funding.”\n\nHow to gauge leadership and company culture.\n\nWhen Dan joined Mozilla in 2005, John Lilly (CEO at the time) stated, “You can do any job here except write code. We’ll figure out what you want that job to be.” From then on, John has been the most influential leader in Dan’s career. He provided air cover when needed and deflected bullets for Dan like an extraordinary leader should.\n\nIt can be hard to gauge the leadership unless you’re interviewing with a CEO. Dan advises to ask how strategic decisions get made in an organization. He’s seen CEOs make crucial decisions without a care for what other employees thought. “A heavy handed CEO is fine, as long as that CEO makes good decisions,” he declared.\n\nThere’s a quote by Tanium’s CEO, Orion Hindawi, from a recent interview with Re/Code Decode's Kara Swisher that’s epitomizes when candidates misunderstand culture:\n\n“I have friends who have quit companies in San Francisco because, literally, they didn’t have the nap pod close to their desk,” he said. “My people came to us because they want to build something that matters. They don’t give a shit about the coconut water.”\n\nYour decision should not be based off ping pong tables or nap pods. Dan suggests asking what the company values are and most importantly, how they translate on a day to day basis. How is conflict handled, is their constructive dialogue?\n\n“At Mozilla you could write in forums and you'd get scathing responses. One person was causing issues with others. I pulled them aside and asked them if they recognized their behaviors and effects on the company. This person used to run this team and was now overstepping his boundaries with the new manager. He said he never thought of it that way. He apologized to the new manager and we were able to move forward,” Dan said.\n\nTreat every interview like it’s your dream job.\n\nI once interviewed at a company and didn’t follow up after the interviews. In fact, I went on vacation. To my surprise when I returned I received this e-mail response from the recruiter:\n\n“Although they were really excited about your background, and really enjoyed their meetings with you, they didn't sense enough excitement or interest in ACME Company or the role, which is something they put a lot of weight on.”\n\nNeedless to say, I didn’t treat the entire process like it was my dream job. Dan’s strongly suggests to put your best foot forward in order to receive an offer. Prep in advance, come with intelligent questions, and follow up like a rock star.\n\nShould you get an MBA?\n\nDan left UCLA to chase the startup dream and never finished university. He’s never been to business school, but he sure does have a unique vantage point because of his real-life experience. He’s observed that most people who earned an MBA from exceptional schools are quite happy with their experience. The most important criteria to discern is ‘why’ you want the MBA and to determine how the curriculum will help you achieve your goals. It’s not necessarily the golden ticket that candidates are lead to believe.\n\nOne on Ones: Dan’s go-to management tool.\n\nOne of my favorite LinkedIn posts from Dan is about his framework for one on one meetings. What I love most is that only 5-10 minutes are slated for status updates – or things you can review in an email. He provides responsibilities for the manager and their direct report, and most importantly outlines potential outcomes you want from the meetings. In one of the outcomes he highlights that everyone should come out of the meeting with more energy than they came in with. It’s a progressive framework every manager should consider.\n\nBe worth more than you cost.\n\n“Be aware of your cost to the organization and the value that you bring. If you ever cost more than your worth you should be aware if those lines start to blur,” Dan stated.\n\nAt one point in my career I felt like I was standing in the end-zone and I couldn’t see the 20 yard line. Talking to Dan provided clarity and advice I could immediately apply. As I’m looking at my career through a new lens, I know I have to continue to re-invest in myself while remembering to think about how my decisions will impact my career over an extended period of time."
