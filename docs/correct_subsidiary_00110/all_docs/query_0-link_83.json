        "text": "THE INNOCENT BLOOD OF ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE ON THE HANDS AND HEADS OF FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG AND COO SHERYL SANDBERG, THEIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ALL EMPLOYEES OF FASCISTBOOK.\n\nA nationwide review conducted by ABC News has identified at least 36 criminal cases where Trump was invoked in direct connection with violent acts, threats of violence or allegations of assault.\n\nIn nine cases, perpetrators hailed Trump in the midst or immediate aftermath of physically attacking innocent victims. In another 10 cases, perpetrators cheered or defended Trump while taunting or threatening others. And in another 10 cases, Trump and his rhetoric were cited in court to explain a defendant’s violent or threatening behavior.\n\nThe 36 cases identified by ABC News are remarkable in that a link to the president is captured in court documents and police statements, under the penalty of perjury or contempt.\n\nIn many cases of assault or threat, charges are never filed, perpetrators are never identified or the incident is never even reported to authorities. And most criminal acts committed by Trump supporters or his detractors have nothing to do with the president. But in 36 cases, court records and police reports indicated some sort of link.\n\nThe perpetrators and suspects identified in the 36 cases are mostly white men — as young as teenagers and as old as 75 — while the victims largely represent an array of minority groups — African-Americans, Latinos, Muslims and gay men.\n\nFederal law enforcement authorities have privately told ABC News they worry that — even with Trump’s public denunciations of violence — Trump’s style could inspire violence-prone individuals to take action against minorities or others they perceive to be against the president’s agenda.\n\n“Any public figure could have the effect of inspiring people,” FBI Director Chris Wray told a Senate panel in July. “But remember that the people who commit hate fueled violence are not logical, rational people.”\n\nBeating of homeless man because Trump psychos thought he was an illegal.\n\nAug. 19, 2015: In Boston, after he and his brother beat a sleeping homeless man of Mexican descent with a metal pole, Steven Leader, 30, told police “Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported.” The victim, however, was not in the United States illegally. The brothers, who are white, ultimately pleaded guilty to several assault-related charges and were each sentenced to at least two years in prison.\n\nAnother Trumpanzee psycho threatening to put bullets in the heads of colored people.\n\nDec. 5, 2015: After Penn State University student Nicholas Tavella, 19, was charged with “ethnic intimidation” and other crimes for threatening to “put a bullet” in a young Indian man on campus, his attorney argued in court that Tavella was just motivated by “a love of country,” not “hate.” “Donald Trump is running for President of the United States saying that, ‘We’ve got to check people out more closely,'” Tavella’s attorney argued in his defense. Tavella, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to ethnic intimidation and was sentenced to up to two years in prison.\n\nThreatening to murder President Barack Obama and other federal officials. Posts threatening messages on Twitter and Facebook and they do nothing about his hate speech.\n\nApril 28, 2016: When FBI agents arrested 61-year-old John Martin Roos in White City, Oregon, for threatening federal officials, including then-President Barack Obama, they found several pipe bombs and guns in his home. In the three months before his arrest, Roos posted at least 34 messages to Twitter about Trump, repeatedly threatening African Americans, Muslims, Mexican immigrants and the “liberal media,” and in court documents, prosecutors noted that the avowed Trump supporter posted this threatening message to Facebook a month earlier: “The establishment is trying to steal the election from Trump. … Obama is already on a kill list … Your [name] can be there too.” Roos, who is white, has since pleaded guilty to possessing an unregistered explosive device and posting internet threats against federal officials. He was sentenced to more than five years in prison.\n\n“Donald Trump will fix them” as Trumpanzee psycho attacks African American neighbor with knife.\n\nJune 3, 2016: After 54-year-old Henry Slapnik attacked his African-American neighbors with a knife in Cleveland, he told police “Donald Trump will fix them because they are scared of Donald Trump,” according to police reports. Slapnik, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to “ethnic intimidation” and other charges. It’s unclear what sentence he received.\n\nAttack of bi-racial couple with knife by Trump psycho who then said he was going to Trump rally to stomp out more Black Lives Matter group.\n\nAug. 16, 2016: In Olympia, Washington, 32-year-old Daniel Rowe attacked a white woman and a black man with a knife after seeing them kiss on a popular street. When police arrived on the scene, Rowe professed to being “a white supremacist” and said “he planned on heading down to the next Donald Trump rally and stomping out more of the Black Lives Matter group,” according to court documents filed in the case. Rowe, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to charges of assault and malicious harassment, and he was sentenced to more than four years in prison.\n\n“Donald Trump is the last hope for white people.” says Trump psycho assaulting African American teen.\n\nSept. 1, 2016: The then-chief of the Bordentown, New Jersey, police department, Frank Nucera, allegedly assaulted an African American teenager who was handcuffed. Federal prosecutors said the attack was part of Nucera’s “intense racial animus,” noting in federal court that “within hours” of the assault, Nucera was secretly recorded saying “Donald Trump is the last hope for white people.” The 60-year-old Nucera has been indicted by a federal grand jury on three charges, including committing a federal hate crime. Nucera, who is white, has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. He retired two years ago.\n\nTrump psycho threatens to blow up mosque on Facebook but Facebook does nothing about his hate speech.\n\nSeptember 2016: After 40-year-old Mark Feigin of Los Angeles was arrested for posting anti-Muslim and allegedly threatening statements to a mosque’s Facebook page, his attorney argued in court that the comments were protected by the First Amendment because Feigin was “using similar language and expressing similar views” to “campaign statements from then-candidate Donald Trump.” Noting that his client “supported Donald Trump,” attorney Caleb Mason added that “Mr. Feigin’s comments were directed toward a pressing issue of public concern that was a central theme of the Trump campaign and the 2016 election generally: the Islamic roots of many international and U.S. terrorist acts.” Feigin, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of sending harassing communications electronically. He was sentenced to probation.\n\nPlot to bomb apartment complex full of Somali immigrants.\n\nOct. 13, 2016: After the FBI arrested three white Kansas men for plotting to bomb an apartment complex in Garden City, Kansas, where many Somali immigrants lived, one of the men’s attorneys insisted to a federal judge that the plot was “self-defensive” because the three men believed “that if Donald Trump won the election, President Obama would not recognize the validity of those results, that he would declare martial law, and that at that point militias all over the country would have to step in.” Then, after a federal grand jury convicted 47-year-old Patrick Stein and the two other men of conspiracy-related charges, Stein’s attorney argued for a lighter sentence based on “the backdrop” of Stein’s actions: Trump had become “the voice of a lost and ignored white, working-class set of voters” like Stein, and the “climate” at the time could propel someone like Stein to “go to 11,” attorney Jim Pratt said in court. Stein and his two accomplices were each sentenced to at least 25 years in prison.\n\n“Gonna burn your house down” says Trumpanzee psycho to Muslim family who bought house next door to him.\n\nNov. 3, 2016: In Tampa, Florida, David Howard threatened to burn down the house next to his “simply because” it was being purchased by a Muslim family, according to the Justice Department. He later said under oath that while he harbored a years-long dislike for Muslims, the circumstances around the home sale were “the match that lit the wick.” He cited Trump’s warnings about immigrants from majority-Muslim countries. “[With] the fact that the president wants these six countries vetted, everybody vetted before they come over, there’s a concern about Muslims,” Howard said. Howard, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights violation, and the 59-year-old was sentenced to eight months in prison.\n\nAssault of a hispanic man. “This is for Donald Trump.”\n\nNov. 10, 2016: A 23-year-old man from High Springs, Florida, allegedly assaulted an unsuspecting Hispanic man who was cleaning a parking lot outside of a local food store. “[H]e was suddenly struck in the back of the head,” a police report said of the victim. “[The victim] asked the suspect why he hit him, to which the suspect replied, ‘This is for Donald Trump.’ The suspect then grabbed [the victim] by the jacket and proceeded to strike him several more times,” according to the report. Surveillance video of the incident “completely corroborated [the victim’s] account of events,” police said. The suspect was arrested on battery charges, but the case was dropped after the victim decided not to pursue the matter, police said. Efforts by ABC News to reach the victim for further explanation were not successful.\n\nEthnic intimidation by a Trumpanzee who attacked a cab driver.\n\nNov. 12, 2016: In Grand Rapids, Michigan, while attacking a cab driver from East Africa, 23-year-old Jacob Holtzlander shouted racial epithets and repeatedly yelled the word, “Trump,” according to law enforcement records. Holtzlander, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to a charge of ethnic intimidation, and he was sentenced to 30 days in jail.\n\nAttack of a Muslim woman wearing a hajib. “Trump is here now. He will get rid of all of you.”\n\nJan. 25, 2017: At JFK International Airport in New York, a female Delta employee, wearing a hijab in accordance with her Muslim faith, was “physically and verbally” attacked by 57-year-old Robin Rhodes of Worcester, Mass., “for no apparent reason,” prosecutors said at the time. When the victim asked Brown what she did to him, he replied: “You did nothing, but … [Expletive] Islam. [Expletive] ISIS. Trump is here now. He will get rid of all of you.” Rhodes ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of “menacing,” and he was sentenced to probation.\n\nTrump psycho calls a mosque and threatens to shoot them all after Trump falsely claimed on Facebook and Twitter that Muslim terrorists launched an attack in Sweden.\n\nFeb. 19, 2017: After 35-year-old Gerald Wallace called a mosque in Miami Gardens, Florida, and threatened to “shoot all y’all,” he told the FBI and police that he made the call because he “got angry” from a local TV news report about a terrorist act. At a rally in Florida the day before, Trump falsely claimed that Muslim refugees had just launched a terrorist attack in Sweden.\n\nWallace’s attorney, Katie Carmon, later tried to convince a federal judge that the threat to kill worshippers could be “protected speech” due to the “very distinctly political climate” at the time. “There are courts considering President Trump’s travel ban … and the president himself has made some very pointed statements about what he thinks about people of this descent,” Carmon argued in court.\n\nWallace, who is African American, ultimately pleaded guilty to obstructing the free exercise of his victims’ religious beliefs, and he was sentenced to one year in prison.\n\nTrump homophobe attacks gay couple. “You live in Trump country now.”\n\nFeb. 23, 2017: Kevin Seymour and his partner Kevin price were riding their bicycles in Key West, Florida, when a man on a moped, 30-year-old Brandon Davis of North Carolina, hurled anti-gay slurs at them and “intentionally” ran into Seymour’s bike, shouting, “You live in Trump country now,” according to police reports and Davis’ attorney. Davis ultimately pleaded guilty to a charge of battery evidencing prejudice, but in court, he expressed remorse and was sentenced to four years of probation.\n\nTrumpanzee hater on Muslims.\n\nMay 3, 2017: In South Padre Island, Texas, 35-year-old Alexander Jennes Downing of Waterford, Connecticut, was captured on cellphone video taunting and aggressively approaching a Muslim family, repeatedly shouting, “Donald Trump will stop you!” and other Trump-related remarks. Police arrested downing, of Waterford, Connecticut, for public intoxication. It’s unclear what came of the charge.\n\nAnother Trumpanzee psycho threatening to murder Congresswoman Maxine Waters due to the twisting of her words via lies spread on Facebook by Trump and his Trumpanzees.\n\nOct. 22, 2017: A 44-year-old California man threatened to kill Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., for her frequent criticism of Trump and her promise to “take out” the president. Anthony Scott Lloyd left a voicemail at the congresswoman’s Washington office, declaring: “If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine. Cause we’ll kill you.” After pleading guilty to one count of threatening a U.S. official, Lloyd asked the judge for leniency, saying he suffered from addiction-inducing mental illness and became “far too immersed in listening to polarizing political commentators and engaging in heated political debates online.” His lawyer put it this way to the judge: “Mr. Lloyd was a voracious consumer of political news online, on television and on radio … [that are] commonly viewed as ‘right wing,’ unconditionally supportive of President Trump, and fiercely critical of anyone who opposed President Trump’s policies.” The judge sentenced Lloyd to six months of house arrest and three years of probation.\n\nDeath threats against the Boston Globe, but Facebook does not care about Trump’s hate speech and practical death speech against the Boston Globe, NYT or any other news media as long as he keeps bring in the money to them. I wonder how Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg would love to get constant death threats like these?\n\nAugust 2018: After the Boston Globe called on news outlets around the country to resist what it called “Trump’s assault on journalism,” the Boston Globe received more than a dozen threatening phone calls. “You are the enemy of the people,” the alleged caller, 68-year-old Robert Chain of Encino, California, told a Boston Globe employee on Aug. 22. “As long as you keep attacking the President, the duly elected President of the United States … I will continue to threat[en], harass, and annoy the Boston Globe.” A week later, authorities arrested Chain on threat-related charges. After a hearing in his case, he told reporters, “America was saved when Donald J. Trump was elected president.” Chain has pleaded guilty to seven threat-related charges, and he is awaiting sentencing.\n\nAnother Trump psycho threatens to kill Democratic office holders, members of their family and members of both local and federal law enforcement, but Facebook and Twitter did nothing to stop his psycho hate rants on his profile.\n\nOct. 4, 2018: The Polk County Sheriff’s Office in Florida arrested 53-year-old James Patrick of Winter Haven, Florida, for allegedly threatening “to kill Democratic office holders, members of their families and members of both local and federal law enforcement agencies,” according to a police report. In messages posted online, Patrick detailed a “plan” for his attacks, which he said he would launch if then-nominee Brett Kavanaugh was not confirmed as a Supreme Court justice, the police report said. Seeking Patrick’s release from jail after his arrest, Patrick’s attorney, Terri Stewart, told a judge that her client’s “rantings” were akin to comments from “a certain high-ranking official” — Trump. The president had “threatened the North Korean people — to blow them all up. It was on Twitter,” Stewart said, according to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. Patrick has been charged with making a written threat to kill or injure, and he has pleaded not guilty. His trial is pending.\n\n15 bombs sent by Trump psycho to prominent critics and members of news media but Facebook did not care about his hate speech he posted there.\n\nLate October 2018: Over the course of a week, Florida man Cesar Sayoc allegedly mailed at least 15 potential bombs to prominent critics of Trump and members of the media. Sayoc had been living in a van plastered with pro-Trump stickers, and he had posted several pro-Trump messages on social media. Federal prosecutors have accused him of “domestic terrorism,” and Sayoc has since pleaded guilty to 65 counts, including use of a weapon of mass destruction. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. “We believe the president’s rhetoric contributed to Mr. Sayoc’s behavior,” Sayoc’s attorney told the judge at sentencing.\n\nTrump psycho tells Senator “I’m going to put a bullet in ya for your constant lambasting of President Trump.”\n\nDec. 4, 2018: Michael Brogan, 51, of Brooklyn, New York, left a voicemail at an unidentified U.S. Senator’s office in Washington insisting, “I’m going to put a bullet in ya. … You and your constant lambasting of President Trump. Oh, reproductive rights, reproductive rights.” He later told an FBI agent that before leaving the voicemail he became “very angry” by “an internet video of the Senator, including the Senator’s criticism of the President of the United States as well as the Senator’s views on reproductive rights.” “The threats were made to discourage the Senator from criticizing the President,” the Justice Department said in a later press release. Brogan has since pleaded guilty to one count of threatening a U.S. official, and he is awaiting sentencing.\n\nTrump psycho threatens to murder Congresswoman Maxine Waters thanks to the lies Facebook and Twitter allowed Trump to spew against her on those sites.\n\nJan. 17, 2019: Stephen Taubert of Syracuse, New York, was arrested by the U.S. Capitol Police for threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and for threatening to “hang” former President Barack Obama. Taubert used “overtly bigoted, hateful language” in his threats, according to federal prosecutors. On July 20, 2018, Taubert called the congresswoman’s Los Angeles office to say he would find her at public events and kill her and her entire staff. In a letter to the judge just days before Taubert’s trial began, his defense attorney, Courtenay McKeon, noted: “During that time period, Congresswoman Waters was embroiled in a public feud with the Trump administration. … On June 25, 2018, in response to Congresswoman Waters’ public statements, President Trump tweeted: ‘Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has … just called for harm to supporters … of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!'” As McKeon insisted to the judge: “This context is relevant to the case.” A federal jury ultimately convicted Taubert on three federal charges, including retaliating against a federal official and making a threat over state lines. He was sentenced to nearly four years in prison.\n\nTrump will handle it and we will get rid of all these Muslims\n\nJan. 22, 2019: David Boileau of Holiday, Florida, was arrested by the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office for allegedly burglarizing an Iraqi family’s home and “going through” their mailbox, according to a police report. After officers arrived at the home, Boileau “made several statements of his dislike for people of Middle Eastern descent,” the report said. “He also stated if he doesn’t get rid of them, Trump will handle it.” The police report noted that a day before, Boileau threw screws at a vehicle outside the family’s house. On that day, Boileau allegedly told police, “We’ll get rid of them one way or another.” Boileau, 58, has since pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of trespassing, and he was sentenced to 90 days in jail.\n\nI am going to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country says psycho Trump supporter.\n\nFeb. 15, 2019: The FBI in Maryland arrested a Marine veteran and U.S. Coast Guard lieutenant, Christopher Paul Hasson, who they said was stockpiling weapons and “espoused” racist and anti-immigrant views for years as he sought to “murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.” In court documents, prosecutors said the 49-year-old “domestic terrorist” compiled a “hit list” of prominent Democrats. Two months later, while seeking Hasson’s release from jail before trial, his public defender, Elizabeth Oyer, told a federal judge: “This looks like the sort of list that our commander-in-chief might have compiled while watching Fox News in the morning. … Is it legitimately frustrating that offensive language and ideology has now become part of our national vocabulary? Yes, it is very frustrating. But … it is hard to differentiate it from the random musings of someone like Donald Trump who uses similar epithets in his everyday language and tweets.” Hasson faces weapons-related charges and was being detained as he awaits trial. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nA case of murder\n\nMarch 16, 2019: Anthony Comello, 24, of Staten Island, New York, was taken into custody for allegedly killing Francesco “Franky Boy” Cali, the reputed head of the infamous Gambino crime family. It marked the first mob boss murder in New York in 30 years, law enforcement officials told ABC News the murder may have stemmed from Comello’s romantic relationship with a Cali family member. Court documents since filed in state court by Comello’s defense attorney, Robert Gottlieb, said Comello suffers from mental defect and was a believer in the “conspiratorial fringe right-wing political group” QAnon. In addition, Gottlieb wrote: “Beginning with the election of President Trump in November 2016, Anthony Comello’s family began to notice changes to his personality. … Mr. Comello became certain that he was enjoying the protection of President Trump himself, and that he had the president’s full support. Mr. Comello grew to believe that several well-known politicians and celebrities were actually members of the Deep State, and were actively trying to bring about the destruction of America.” Comello has been charged with one count of murder and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon. His trial is pending, and he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThreatening to murder Congresswoman Ilhan Omar\n\nApril 5, 2019: The FBI arrested a 55-year-old man from upstate New York for allegedly threatening to kill Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., one of the first two Muslim women elected to the U.S. Congress. She is an outspoken critic of Trump, and Trump has frequently launched public attacks against her and three other female lawmakers of color. Two weeks before his arrest, Patrick Carlineo Jr. allegedly called Omar’s office in Washington labeling the congresswoman a “terrorist” and declaring: “I’ll put a bullet in her f—-ing skull.” When an FBI agent then traced the call to Carlineo and interviewed him, Carlineo “stated that he was a patriot, that he loves the President, and that he hates radical Muslims in our government,” according to the FBI agent’s summary of the interview. Federal prosecutors charged Carlineo with threatening to assault and murder a United States official. Carlineo is awaiting trial, although his defense attorney and federal prosecutors are working on what his attorney called another “possible resolution” of the case.\n\nThreatening to murder Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib.\n\nApril 18, 2019: The FBI arrested John Joseph Kless of Tamarac, Florida, for calling the Washington offices of three prominent Democrats and threatening to kill each of them. At his home, authorities found a loaded handgun in a backpack, an AR-15 rifle and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. In later pleading guilty to one charge of transmitting threats over state lines, Kless admitted that in a threatening voicemail targeting Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., he stated: “You won’t f—ing tell Americans what to say, and you definitely don’t tell our president, Donald Trump, what to say.” Tlaib, a vocal critic of Trump, was scheduled to speak in Florida four days later. Kless was awaiting sentencing. In a letter to the federal judge, he said he “made a very big mistake,” never meant to hurt anyone, and “was way out of line with my language and attitude.”\n\nThreatening to murder a college professor and how all Democrats must be eradicated.\n\nApril 24, 2019: The FBI arrested 30-year-old Matthew Haviland of North Kingstown, Rhode Island, for allegedly sending a series of violent and threatening emails to a college professor in Massachusetts who publicly expressed support for abortion rights and strongly criticized Trump. In one of 28 emails sent to the professor on March 10, 2019, Haviland allegedly called the professor “pure evil” and said “all Democrats must be eradicated,” insisting the country now has “a president who’s taking our country in a place of more freedom rather than less.” In another email the same day, Haviland allegedly wrote the professor: “I will rip every limb from your body and … I will kill every member of your family.” According to court documents, Haviland’s longtime friend later told the FBI that “within the last year, Haviland’s views regarding abortion and politics have become more extreme … at least in part because of the way the news media portrays President Trump.” Haviland has been charged with cyberstalking and transmitting a threat in interstate commerce. His trial is pending.\n\nCalling US Capiton over 2,000 times threatening to murder Democratic lawmakers.\n\nJune 5, 2019: The FBI arrested a Utah man for allegedly calling the U.S. Capitol more than 2,000 times over several months and threatening to kill Democratic lawmakers, whom he said were “trying to destroy Trump’s presidency.” “I am going to take up my second amendment right, and shoot you liberals in the head,” 54-year-old Scott Brian Haven allegedly stated in one of the calls on Oct. 18, 2018, according to charging documents. When an FBI agent later interviewed Haven, he “explained the phone calls were made during periods of frustration with the way Democrats were treating President Trump,” the charging documents said. The FBI visit, however, didn’t stop Haven from making more threats, including: On March 21, 2019, he called an unidentified U.S. senator’s office to say that if Democrats refer to Trump as Hitler again he will shoot them, and two days later he called an unidentified congressman’s office to say he “was going to take [the congressman] out … because he is trying to remove a duly elected President.” A federal grand jury has since charged Haven with one count of transmitting a threat over state lines. Haven pleaded not guilty and was awaiting trial.\n\nMark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg should be charged with 22 counts of being accessories to first degree murder and 24 counts of being accessories to attempted first degree murder.\n\nAug. 3, 2019: A gunman opened fire at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, killing 22 people and injuring 24 others. The FBI labeled the massacre an act of “domestic terrorism,” and police determined that the alleged shooter, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, posted a lengthy anti-immigrant diatribe online before the attack. “We attribute that manifesto directly to him,” according to El Paso police chief Greg Allen. Describing the coming assault as “a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas,” the screed’s writer said “the media” would “blame Trump’s rhetoric” for the attack but insisted his anti-immigrant views “predate Trump” — an apparent acknowledgement that at least some of his views align with some of Trump’s public statements. The writer began his online essay by stating that he generally “support[s]” the previous writings of the man who killed 51 Muslim worshippers in New Zealand earlier this year. In that case, the shooter in New Zealand said he absolutely did not support Trump as “a policy maker and leader” — but “[a]s a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose? Sure.” Crusius has been charged with capital murder by the state of Texas.\n\nNOW MARK ZUCKERBERG AND SHERYL SANDBERG YOU WANT US ATHEISTS AND LGBT USERS PUT TO DEATH?

She’s the 17th trans person killed this year.\n\nhttps://www.lgbtqnation.com/2019/09/transgender-teen-shot-death-baltimore-shes-17th-trans-person-killed-year/\n\nExample Four: Gay Facebook co-founder blasts Mark Zuckerberg for allowing Trump to lie in campaign ads\n\nhttps://www.lgbtqnation.com/2019/10/gay-facebook-co-founder-blasts-mark-zuckerberg-allowing-trump-lie-campaign-ads/\n\nThe company recently announced a policy allowing Trump to lie to millions while paying Facebook for the privilege.\n\nGay Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes has blasted the company’s co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg for allowing President Donald Trump to run campaign ads with outright lies in them.\n\nLate last month, Facebook announced that it will not subject politicians to its policies prohibiting “false or misleading content.” (It already had a 2016 policy of allowing public figures to lie if the speech’s “newsworthiness” and the public interest outweighed the risk of harm.)\n\nNevertheless, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren criticized the policy, and Hughes retweeted her criticism with some choice words of his own.\n\nWarren’s tweets criticizing Facebook’s policy mentioned that other TV news networks have refused to run some of Trump’s campaign ads because of their deliberate lies. In several tweets she also stated:\n\n“Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once because they were asleep at the wheel while Russia attacked our democracy. In fact, this time they’re going further by taking deliberate steps to help one candidate intentionally mislead the American people, while painting the candidacy of others (specifically: mine) as an ‘existential’ threat.”\n\nWarren has since purchased Facebook ads that falsely state that Zuckerberg has endorsed Trump for president. The ads then accurately state that Facebook allows such lies in candidates’ political ads.\n\nFacebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they’re deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people.\n\nThis is a serious threat to our democracy. We need transparency and accountability from Facebook. https://t.co/anu0pWSqS5\n\n— Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 9, 2019\n\nAfter that meeting, Facebook quietly changed its policies on “misinformation” in ads, allowing politicians to run ads that have already been debunked by independent, non-partisan fact-checkers. Put another way, Facebook is now okay with running political ads with known lies.\n\n— Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019\n\nRetweeting Warren’s tweet, Hughes commented:\n\n“I have a feeling that many people in tech will see Warren’s thread implying FB empowers Trump over Warren as unfair. But Mark, by deciding to allow outright lies in political ads to travel on Facebook, is embracing the philosophy behind Trumpism and thereby tipping the scales.”\n\nIn a separate tweet, Hughes wrote, “There is a higher calling — to be a platform that won’t allow political lies to spread. Employees should demand that kind of policy. It isn’t partisan — it’s the right thing to do.”\n\nIn May of this year, Hughes wrote an op-ed saying that Facebook should be broken up and monitored by the U.S. government to address user privacy concerns. In recently leaked audio from a company meeting, Zuckerberg said he worried that Warren would try to break up the company if elected president, and pledged to sue if her administration tried such a thing.\n\nWhen recently announcing the company’s policy allowing politicians to lie in their political ads, Facebook’s Vice President of Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg said, “We have a responsibility to protect the platform from outside interference, and to make sure that when people pay us for political ads we make it as transparent as possible. But it is not our role to intervene when politicians speak.”\n\nExample Five: Killing Atheists\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-secular-life/201606/killing-atheists\n\nHis name was Menocchio. He lived in a small town in Italy in the 16th century. A husband, a father, a miller, and a well-liked member of his community, he was also a non-believer. He publicly declared that it was impossible for Jesus to have been born of a virgin mother, that Jesus was not divine, that much of the Gospel stories were fabrications, that immortality was impossible, and that God may be no more than a figment of human imagination. He was tried for heresy, convicted as an atheist, and burned at the stake.\n\nAnother Italian from the 16th century, Giulio Casare Vanini, denied the immortality of the soul, believed that humans evolved from apes, and insisted that religious teachings are false. He had his tongue cut out, was strangled, and then burned to death.\n\nIn the 17th century, Casimir Liszinksi of Poland, was harshly critical of priests, argued that the Bible was false, and wrote a treatise called The Nonexistence of God. As a result of his atheism, he had his tongue and mouth burned with hot irons, his hands burned over a slow fire, and finally his whole body was torched.\n\nAlso in the 17th century, Thomas Aikenhead, a 20-year old student in Edinburgh, Scotland, was executed because he “maintained…that theology was a rhapsody of ill-invented nonsense…that the Holy Scriptures were stuffed with such madness, nonsense, and contradictions” and that Christ was an “imposter,” etc. For such utterances, this first-time offender with no criminal record, was hanged.\n\nThese men are just a random few heretics from centuries past who were killed for nothing more than their lack of belief in God. They never harmed anyone. They just had the courage to doubt theological claims. And for that, they were tortured and killed. Countless others met a similar piously pernicious fate.\n\nToday, atheist blood continues to flow.\n\nIn Bangladesh, on Feb. 15, 2013, Ahmed Rajib Haider, an atheist blogger, was attacked by religious henchmen just outside of his home; his body was so badly mutilated that his friends could not recognize his corpse. On Feb. 26, 2015, Avijit Roy, another secular blogger, was hacked to death my machete-wielding assailants in the streets of Dhaka. On Match 30, 2015, Oyasiqur Rhaman, another secular blogger, was butchered by religious assailants using meat cleavers. On May 12, 2015, atheist blogger and science promoter Ananta Bijoy Das was hacked to death in Sylhet. On August 7, 2015, Niloy Chatterjee — a leader of the Science and Rationalist Association of Bangladesh — was killed in his home by a group of men armed with machetes. On October 31, 2015, Faisal Arefin Dipan – a publisher of atheist literature — was stabbed and chopped to death in his office. On April 23, 2016, Professor Rezaul Karim Siddique was killed by men with machetes. And on and on. To be sure, it isn’t just the secular who are being cut down, but Hindus and Christians, as well. And yet it is atheists that are being targeted most aggressively.\n\nAnd it isn’t just Islamic fundamentalist gangs in the streets of Bangladesh that atheists must be wary of. In many countries around the world – all of them being Muslim majority nations, as it were – atheism is illegal. Indeed, our dear ally Saudi Arabia officially classifies atheism as terrorism, and those found guilty of this crime can face lengthy imprisonment, state-sanctioned and state-enforced torture, and even execution. Along with Saudia Arabai, twelve other nations today – including Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Qatar, and Nigeria – legislate that atheism warrants the death penalty. Can you imagine: killing some because they don’t believe in God? Insane. It was insane in Italy back in the 16thh century, insane in Scotland back in the 17th century, and it is insane in Nigeria and Iran today.\n\nWhy were atheists persecuted throughout much of the Christian world for so many centuries? Why are atheists persecuted throughout much of the Muslim world today?\n\nAll such persecution – be it of Muslims who are currently persecuted in Myanmar, along with the Karen, or Baha’is in Iran and Pakistan, or the Hazara in Afghanistan, or Palestinians in Occupied Palestine, or Indigenous peoples in Brazil, or African Americans in Missouri, or Latinos in Trumpland, or gays and lesbians throughout the world — all of it is rooted in irrational fear on the part of the persecutors. Fear of difference, fear of losing power, fear of differing worldviews and values.\n\nIn the specific case of atheists, the strongly religious fear our capacity for moral reasoning that does not require a magical, invisible deity. They fear our ability to be ethical without the threat of hell or the reward of heaven. They fear that our allegiance is not to this or that country, or this or that prophet, or this or that guru, but to humanity as a whole. They fear our emphasis on empiricism and evidence. They fear our skepticism and persistent questioning and doubt, for they can lead to ambiguity, uncertainty, debate, wonder, responsibility, and humility.\n\nAt the heart of atheism is an acceptance of the reality that we are here on this planet, alone together, and no magic will save us: no gods, no avatars, no angels, no mantras, no prayers, no prophets, no deities. Just us. We can and will save ourselves. This fact is so terrifying to some, that they wield machetes to try and murder it.\n\nFortunately, for most of humanity, the promise of atheism does not breed fear and terror, but hope and optimism. And as the world continues to secularize, the forces of violent religion will fade.\n\nIf I have faith in anything, then I suppose it is that.\n\nExample Six: Atheist Murdered in Coimbatore Because of Spreading Rationalism\n\nhttps://www.atheistrepublic.com/news/atheist-murdered-coimbatore-because-spreading-rationalism\n\nCoimbatore (Tamil Nadu): Farook was a scrap dealer and a member of the Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam (DVK), a political party dedicated to social reform based on activist and Dravidian leader Periyar EV Ramaswamy’s ideology. Periyar was an Indian social activist and politician who spent over fifty years giving speeches, propagating the realization that everyone is an equal citizen and the differences on basis of caste and creeds were man-made to keep the innocent and ignorant as underdogs in the society. Periyar viewed reasoning as a special tool. According to him, all were blessed with this tool, but very few used it and that is obviously the truth.\n\nIn a Facebook post on March 13, Farook had said: “I am an enemy of god, enemy of religion and enemy of caste. But I am not an enemy of humans who believe in humanity.” His open atheism and the promotion of the same have led to his death.\n\nAccording to the police, four people waylaid him and hacked him to death on March 16. He was stabbed 18 times at Ukkadam, Coimbatore. On Friday, one day after Faook’s murder, six people surrendered before a local court in connection with the crime – Anshanth, Saddam Hussein, Shamsudeen, Abdul Munaf, Akram Jinda and Jaffar. They all were friends and neighbors to Farook for nearly 15 years. Farook is survived by his parents Hameed and Nafisa, his wife Rasheeda, brother-in-law Shahjahan, 11-year-old son Afrid, and six-year-old daughter Anafa.\n\nFarook was an atheist and rationalist. He was also the administrator of a WhatsApp group called ‘Allah Murdad,’ meaning ‘There is no God’. “This murder could be a warning to those who are against religion,” said a senior official investigating the case on the condition of anonymity. “Farook had refused to exit from this WhatsApp group. The murder could be a warning to other Muslims who are part of that group. In this group, Farook had even posted a picture of his daughter holding up a placard that reads ‘There is no God’,” he said.\n\nAfter his son Farook was murdered, Hameed decided to join Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam, a splinter group of Dravidar Kazhagam founded by Periyar to propagate rational ideas. According to Indiatimes, DVK members expressed concern about Hameed’s safety. “For now, our concern is to educate the two children of Farook. One of them wants to be an advocate. So we are not very keen on involving Hameed in ideological activities,” said Nehrudass, district president of DVK. “If my son had agreed to follow diktats of his murderers to give up his ideology, he would have lived. But he stood up for his principles. I feel proud of my son,” says Hameed.\n\nExample Seven: Lies and Hate Fascistbook allows Faux Nitwit Newsless to spread against atheists on Fascistbook. This was allowed on Fascistbook and not deemed hate speech against atheists.\n\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/opinion/todays-atheists-are-bullies-and-they-are-doing-their-best-to-intimidate-the-rest-of-us-into-silence\n\nThere’s no polite way to say it. Atheists today are the most arrogant, ignorant and dangerous people on earth.\n\nWe’ve all seen how these pompous prigs get offended by the slightest bit of religious imagery in public and mortified if even a whisper of “Merry Christmas” escapes the lips of some well-meaning but naïve department store clerk during the “holiday season.”\n\nTo cite a few recent examples: Last December, the group American Atheists launched its annual billboard campaign with the slogan: “Just Skip Church — It’s All Fake News.” In February, the American Humanist Association became furious when President Trump had the gall to mention Christianity and Jesus Christ without also mentioning atheists—at the National Prayer Breakfast! (How dare he!) And just this month, the Freedom From Religion Foundation raised holy hell because the Reverend Billy Graham was laid out in state in the Capitol Rotunda before his burial.\n\nYes, these atheists are loud, nasty, unapologetic and in-your-face.\n\nBut while their arrogance is annoying, it’s nothing compared to their ignorance. Atheists believe that the vast majority of human beings from all periods of time and all places on the Earth have been wrong about the thing most important to them. They basically dismiss this vast majority as being either moronic or profoundly naïve. What they don’t seem to know – or won’t admit – is that the greatest contributions to civilization have been made, not by atheists, but by believers.\n\nToo many Christian authors have tried to be kind and amiable in an effort to demonstrate that believers don’t have to sink into the mud in order to defend the faith. That tact is very charitable, but unfortunately, it just doesn’t work with bullies.\n\nAristotle, Francis Bacon, Leonardo Da Vinci, and Isaac Newton all believed in God. Nobel-prize winner Wilhelm Rontgen, the discoverer of X-rays; Antoine Lavoisier, the father of modern chemistry; William Keen, the pioneer of brain surgery; rocket scientist Wernher von Braun; and Ernest Walton, the first person to artificially split the atom—all believed in God.\n\nAnd speaking of pioneers of science, who do you think coined the term “scientist” in the first place? William Whewell, an Anglican priest and theologian! He also came up with words “physicist,” “cathode”, “anode” and many other commonly used scientific terms. Essentially, the very language used by scientists today comes from the brain of a believer.\n\nEven the Big Bang Theory itself – which atheists mistakenly think bolsters their arguments against God – was proposed by Fr. George Lemaitre, a Belgian astronomer and Roman Catholic priest! And the father of genetics—which provides the basis for the whole theory of evolution—was Gregor Mendel, an Augustinian monk!\n\nYes, the new atheists have an ignorance of history bordering on madness.\n\nBut are they really dangerous, too?\n\nYou bet they are. The truth is, the atheist position is incapable of supporting any coherent system of morality other than ruthless social Darwinism. That’s why it has caused more deaths, murders and bloodshed than any other belief system in the history of the world.\n\nAtheists, of course, are always claiming hysterically that Christianity has been responsible for most of the world’s wars, but that’s just another example of atheistic ignorance. The main reasons for war have always been economic gain, territorial gain, civil and revolutionary conflicts. According to Philip Axelrod’s monumental “Encyclopedia of Wars,” only 6.98 percent or all wars from 8000 BC to present were religious in nature. If you subtract Islamic wars from the equation, only 3.2 percent of wars were due to specifically Christian causes. That means that over 96 percent of all the wars on this planet were due to worldly reasons.\n\nIndeed, in the last 100 years alone, upwards of 360 million people were killed by governments—and close to half of those people were killed by atheist governments!\n\nYes, there is a profound and frightening connection between atheism and death. Atheist leaders like Stalin, Mao Zedong, Hideki To ̄jo ̄, Pol Pot and many others bear the blame for the overwhelming majority of deaths caused by war and mass murder in history. And while many atheists make the preposterous claim that Adolf Hitler was a Christian, his private diaries, first published in 1953 by Farrar, Straus and Young, reveal clearly that the Fuhrer was a rabid atheist: “The heaviest blow that ever struck humanity,” Hitler stated, “was the coming of Christianity. Bolshevism is Christianity’s illegitimate child. Both are inventions of the Jew… Our epoch will certainly see the end of the disease of Christianity.”\n\nThe facts are incontrovertible. Between the years 1900 and 2017, approximately 150 million people were killed by atheistic political regimes. 150 million!\n\nAnd it makes perfect sense, doesn’t it? Atheists don’t believe in God, so they don’t believe in any transcendent, objective moral law. Nor do they believe that human beings are made in the image of God, and so they don’t believe humans possess infinite value and dignity. When you put these two beliefs together, you have a deadly recipe that makes killing “problematic” human beings quite easy and defensible.\n\nOne has only to look at the growing numbers of abortions, suicides, homicides, and cases of state-sponsored euthanasia, and infanticide, to see the atheist-death connection. As a thoroughly secular and functionally atheistic culture, we are fast becoming accustomed to “killing” our problems rather than dealing with them in a compassionate, loving, and sacrificial way.\n\nSo yes, the modern breed of atheist is arrogant, ignorant and dangerous. Too many books written in response to these pseudo-intellectual hatemongers have been altogether too nice. Too many Christian authors have tried to be kind and amiable in an effort to demonstrate that believers don’t have to sink into the mud in order to defend the faith. That tact is very charitable, but unfortunately, it just doesn’t work with bullies.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what modern-day atheists are—bullies; bullies who are doing their best to intimidate the rest of us into silence.\n\nWell, we can’t allow that to happen. As I say in my book, “Inside the Atheist Mind: Unmasking the Religion of Those Who Say There is No God,” there is only one way to deal with bullies, even in this politically correct world—and that is to stand up to them and fight them; to fight them in a bold, aggressive, and fearless way, and to fight them now.\n\nTime for Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg and all the Management and Board of Directors of Facebook be brought to justice for allowing hate and bigotry to be spewed on Fascistbook by ChristoFascists, MuzzieFascists and TrumpFascists and be executed for their Crimes Against Humanity so they can put some money in their pockets and get rich off of all the hate, death and murder they pedal on Fascistbook.\n\nManagement\n\nMark Zuckerberg Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nMark Zuckerberg is the founder, chairman and CEO of Facebook, which he founded in 2004.
