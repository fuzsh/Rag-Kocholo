        "text": "During the horrible heat spell I lost power for nearly 3 days and due to a million circumstances couldn’t move my NxStage somewhere with power so needed an “emergency” treatment after missing two days, so I did in center for the first time.\n\nWow, the heatwave really got you hard over there! I was thinking…perhaps if you had a generator maybe you could have still dialyzed at home?..But with such a HOT HOT weather I think itys still impossible to survive without air-conditioning\n\nI must say it was nice not to do much. I did self cannulate, although the center does buttonholes and was willing to do it, and I did remove the needles myself as my tech knew someone who was interested in self cannulation and wanted to tell him how I did it.\n\nVery interesting indeed, so do they do home training there?\n\nI went to DaVita in Concord and I must say everyone was real nice, very curious as to the home modality, and it was a nice break. But the reality was the next day as I got on I realized it really isn’t all that much work with the NxStage, (I take some time hanging my bags so when I am ready to get on all I have to do is insert cartridge and connect bags). I was much more comfortable at home.\n\n:)…No where like home sweet home!\n\nI did meet their director and spoke to him at length and did compliment him on the cleanliness of his facility and the fact that everyone seemed to follow the various protocols. They must go through boxes and boxes of gloves a day, but I never saw anyone use the same gloves going to machine to machine except when they were cleaning them down at the end with bleach.\n\nCathy\n\nhome hemo 9/04\n\nwho can no longer say I’ve never dialyzed incenter\n\nWell, now you experienced your first in-center session and glad it was a good one…for them I guess they earned themselves more good points…\n\nI did PD for several years while working full time (traveling too) and had a gallbladder surgery go terribly wrong. That was a really hard hit. 3 Months in the hospital, very very sick with peritoneal candidasis, and now too many adheasions and scarring in there. Probably some hidden pockets of candida remain too. I try not to think about what that could mean.\n\nA cadaver transplant in 1988 didn’t work (not even for a day). 3 months in the hospital at MUSC trying radical treatments. Since 1994, I’ve had a St. Jude aortic valve, and so I am reluctant to become immune-suppressed again. My current situation works for me, and I’m able to vacation a couple of times a year and run at a clinic at the beach or wherever. But I’m thinking I probably wouldn’t live any longer with another transplant.\n\nMy wife has done so much to nurse me back to life, literally, and she works very hard. I do not wish to burden her with the responsibility of having to support me on home hemo. Our son, born a week before I got my fistula, is somewhat grown now… Working and going to college but living at home in our small house. That was a long haul, but very well worth it. I just turned 50, she’s 48 and still hot! We still have fun. Anyway, we’re beginning to be a little more free and able to relax now. Life is good. Don’t want to fix what ain’t broke.\n\nThanks for the link, I know I really should be more pro-active. I’ve watched out for myself for so long, I guess I’ve become complacent, but it really would be helpful for those that cannot watch out for themselves.\n\nI guess I should try to find a forum for in-center patients. Meanwhile I’ll just lurk around here.\n\nRusty"
