Grid Middleware (the glue) Managing . . . Networked Distributed Resources\n\nWhy Should We Care about Grids ? “ It’s the next big thing ! “ Grid technologies advance Science and Education in that we can do things which haven’t been possible before. Grid infrastructure attracts and enables new businesses and creates new jobs, especially in today's rural areas. Grids make us more competitive by better utilizing resources, bringing results ‘to market’ faster, and delivering with higher quality.\n\nGrid Benefits Department, Enterprise, and Global Grids • Access: transparent, remote, secure, wireless • Sharing:enable collaboration over the network • Failover: migrate/restart applications automatically • On Demand: get resources, when you need them • Productivity:more work done in shorter time • Virtualization: access compute services, not servers • Heterogeneity:platforms, OSs, devices, software • Resource Utilization: increase from 20% to 80+% • Virtual Organizations: build & dismantle on the fly\n\nHowever, There is Still a Long Way to Go ! • Grids are over-hyped: currently, they promise much more than they can really offer. • Grid technology is far from mature and complete. • Grid standards are (mostly) still missing. • Grids are very complex IT infrastructures. • Grids bring new challenges: sharing resources, loosing direct control, security, intellectual property, legal, social, political issues . . .\n\nGrid Architecture, Technology, Standards\n\nArchitectural Requirements • Data Distribution • Location, volume, refresh • Security of data • Usability • Administrative Skill set and • Client environment • Psychological factors important • Operations Management • 100s CPUs / SA • Resources added in large blocks • Change control is critical • Availability • Downtime impact • Individual jobs • Maintenance windows • Scalability • Growth 1-3-5 years • Scaling strategy and • Response to peak loads • Technology refresh, evolution • Manageability • Skill set / workload of SA • Expected stability • Code management, software distribution • Security • User authentication • Internet access • Data Security requirements\n\n... other interfaces Grid Service Service Data Element Service Data Element Service Data Element Implementation / Interfaces Hosting Env/runtime: C, J2EE Systems Infrastructure The Globus Toolkit and the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) • Integration of Grid technologies and Web Services • OGSA defines a “Grid Service” • In terms of WSDL interfaces, defines mechanisms: • creating distributed systems • lifetime management • change management • credential management • notification Notification Authorization Service Creation Service Registry Manageability Concurrency\n\nGlobal Grid Forum (GGF) • Community-driven set of working groups that are developing standards and best practices for distributed computing (\"Grids\" and \"Metacomputing\") efforts • Formed in 2001 (merger of US, APAC, Euro efforts) • Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA)\n\nEnterprise Grid Alliance (EGA) • Industry-driven consortium to implement standards in industry products and make them interoperable • Founding members: Oracle, Sun, Fujitsu, • ‘Enforce’ complementary position in pushing GGF into the academic corner\n\nSys Mgmt The Changing Grid Landscape Developer View: Write here Run anywhere Service Composition Utility Computing HPTC Grid OnDemand Web Svcs “Compute Power from the wall socket” Standards Public SOA Outsourcing/Hosting Software as a Svc . . .

Like electricity, water, gas, heat, telephony\n\nTime-to-market Pressures vs. Quality Products • Multiple, concurrent projects • Projects with different schedules and milestones • Overlapping demands for resources • Large and growing data sets • Larger, more complex product designs • Not enough throughput • Low utilization of compute resources • Insufficient in-house IT expertise • Increasingly complex operations management • Heightened focus on budget/TCO/ROI Customer Challenges\n\nMore Compute Power • Improved Resource Access • Increased Productivity • Better Utilization of Existing Resources • Reduced Costs • Reduced Management Complexity Critical Customer Requirements\n\nWho Uses Department and Enterprise Grids? • Life Sciences • Startup and cost efficient • Custom research or limited use applications • Multi-day application runs (BLAST) • Exponential Combinations • Limited administrative staff • Complementary techniques • Electronic Design • Time to Market • Fastest platforms, largest Grids • License Management • Well established application suite • Large legacy investment • Platform Ownership issues • Financial Services • Market simulations • Time IS Money • Proprietary applications • Multiple Platforms • Multiple scenario execution • Need instant results & analysis tools • High Performance Computing • Parallel Reservoir Simulations • Geophysical Ray
