For a failover configuration store them on the shared storage. The parameter files cannot differ for a specific instance of N1 Grid Service Provisioning System Master Server on the various nodes. For a zone you must install it on the shared storage of this zone.\n\n# cd /opt/SUNWscsps/master/bin # cp pfile desired place\n\nChoose a location on the shared storage for the pfile. Edit the parameter file pfile and follow the comments within that file. For example:\n\nNote –\n\nIf you configured your master server to answer https requests, you need to install a https capable wget. Follow the comments in the parameter file to configure the TestCmd variable.\n\nThe following is an example for a N1 Grid Service Provisioning System 4.1 Master Server."
