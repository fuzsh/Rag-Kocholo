        "text": "The military mission is the driving force behind the assignment process, but enrollment in the EFMP ensures that family members' documented needs are considered in the process. Assignment coordination occurs when the personnel command requests that Department of Defense medical or educational professionals review a family member's documented needs to determine availability of services at a projected location. Assignment coordination is important because access to appropriate medical and educational services may be limited in some areas, especially in overseas and remote locations.\n\nIn addition to the support available from the installation Military and Family Support Centers and Military OneSource consultants, MilitaryINSTALLATIONS provides some suggestions for making the transition easier as your child enters a new school system following a move to a new duty station. The article, \"Preparing for Your Move,\" provides tips for what to do prior to and after your move to help create a smooth transfer between schools.\n\nAdditionally, military families can learn about the Education Directory for Children with Special Needs for information on special-needs issues and listings of national and local resources for early intervention (for infants and toddlers) and special education (for school-age children) services."
