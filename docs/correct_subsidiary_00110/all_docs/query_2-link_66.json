        "text": "Project facts\n\nLocation: Roosevelt Station\n\nSite area: 1.2 acres\n\nDevelopment partners: Bellwether Housing and Mercy Housing NW\n\nArchitect: VIA and Perkins Eastman\n\nContractor: Walsh Construction\n\nProgram: 254 affordable homes, 14,000 square feet of retail space\n\n6,000 square foot early learning center\n\nProject cost: $105 million\n\nOpened: 2022\n\nOverview\n\nCedar Crossing is an affordable housing project in Seattle’s Roosevelt neighborhood. It provides 254 housing units, including 91 two-and three-bedroom units for families on 1.2 acres of land directly adjacent to the north station building at Roosevelt Station. In partnership with Children’s Hospital, Mary’s Place, and the Ronald McDonald House, 20 homes are set aside for families simultaneously experiencing homelessness and caring for children with complex medical issues.\n\nThe project sets aside housing for children with intense medical needs and their families through a partnership with Seattle Children's and Mary’s Place, and offers housing to veterans, seniors, and their families. On the ground floor is an all-ages playground for residents, a bilingual childcare center run by El Centro de la Raza, several retail spaces, and a public plaza, providing services for residents, transit riders, and the broader neighborhood.\n\nSound Transit and the Seattle Office of Housing partnered to create affordable housing at the station by offering the property at a discounted land price, as well as $15 million in pre-committed affordable housing financing from the City of Seattle. The project was made possible in part by a Joint Development Agreement with the Federal Transit Administration. Bellwether Housing and Mercy Housing Northwest developed the project, which opened in June 2022.\n\nCedar Crossing meets Washington State Evergreen Sustainable Development Standards and includes a green roof with solar panels. It offers fewer than 75 parking stalls and provides storage for at least one bicycle per apartment."
