        "text": "For years, tech industry insiders and analysts have marvelled at the success and influence that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has achieved even though he’s just 27 years old. But Zuckerberg isn’t the only member of the Facebook team to rise to a high-level job at a remarkably young age.\n\nAs documents filed with the SEC on Wednesday show, Facebook's core leadership team is entirely comprised of workers younger than 45.\n\nSheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, is 42. As Bloomberg News recently reported, Sandberg is playing a critical role in making sure the IPO is a success. She will be charged with expanding the company's investor base and serving as a liaison to Wall Street analysts, and likely will leverage her deep business and political connections to do so.\n\nBloomberg reports, \"Sandberg serves as the outgoing and more seasoned foil to Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, a 27-year-old coder who sets the company's strategy even as he shuns publicity. During a career that has spanned Google Inc., McKinsey & Co. and the U.S. Treasury Department, Sandberg has honed what friends, colleagues and former employees say is a penchant for brokering alliances, fostering loyalty and setting priorities.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Ebersman, 42, is Facebook’s chief financial officer. Prior to joining Facebook in 2009, Ebersman worked at Genentech and Oppenheimer & Company.\n\nDavid Fischer, Facebook’s vice president for marketing and business partnerships, is 39. Fischer arrived at the social-networking company after a stint as a vice president at Google. Before that, he worked for the U.S. Treasury Department and U.S. News and World Report.\n\nFacebook’s vice president for engineering is 36-year-old Mike Schroepfer. He is a veteran of Mozilla and Sun Microsystems and co-founded a firm called CenterRun.\n\nTheodore Ullyot, 44, is the company’s general counsel and one of its three vice presidents. Before coming to Facebook, he practiced law at two private firms and, prior to that at the Justice Department under President George W. Bush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s interesting to note that none of these individuals have been with Zuckerberg since the beginning of his enterprise. Of this inner circle of executives, Sandberg has been with Facebook the longest, and even she has only been with the company since 2008.\n\nMore from The Washington Post:\n\nFacebook files for IPO worth $5 billion\n\nHow does Facebook make its money?\n\nThe succession plan if Zuckerberg were to die\n\nWill Facebook create 1,000 millionaires overnight?"
