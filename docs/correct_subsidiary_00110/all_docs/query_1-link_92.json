UR license supports redundant hot backup and minimize the network down time. PIX firewall with R numbering is limited to support interface quantities and memory. It does not support redundant networking. PIX firewall with FO numbering linked with another firewall with UR license provides hot redundant backup structure. FO license provides fault tolerance function based on status, which improves network structure performance. PIX firewall with UR and FO numbering composed of failover networking need the same type (515E or 525) and same hardware configuration. Security protection between soft switch and bearer network is suggested.\n\nConfidential and Proprietary Information of ZTE CORPORATION\n\n9\n\nNetNumen N31 (V4.2.0) Network Management System (General) User Manual (Volume I)\n\nNote: R and FO numbering cannot work together\n\n\n\n\n\nPIX firewall with R and UR numbering can be used separately. PIX firewall with R and UR numbering are normally used for security protection between soft switch and management network such as DCN. Juniper firewall port is consolidated. It usually adopts same equipment to compose master/slave, master/master, master/master safe full networking mode. NOTE: N-25 networking mode only provides synchronized configuration instead of synchronized talking and tunnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\nThe dual system firewall adopts CISCO PIX to networking as failover mode. It also can adopt two Juniper firewalls to build up master/slave networking mode. The single system firewall can use Cisco firewall with UR and R numbering, or Juniper firewall. Cisco firewall usually configures two Ethernet interfaces and increases the number of interfaces as required. Juniper firewall usually configures fastness port; therefore, it only demands to select type number.\n\nConfidential and Proprietary Information of ZTE CORPORATION\n\nChapter\n\n2\n\nDatabase Installation This chapter covers the following topics: \n\nOracle Database Installation\n\n\n\nSQL Server Database Installation\n\nOracle Database Installation This section describes the hardware and software requirements for Oracle 9i installation and configuration on Sun Solaris operating system.

The decompressed contents are saved in patch saving directory. $ unzip p4163445_9207_solaris64.zip 2. Guarantee the establishment of environment parameter ORACLE_HOME and ORACLE_SID is correct. Login the account as oracle. Confirm the environment parameter set is correct, check result by executing env command. 3. Stop oracle database and relevant process instances. i.\n\nShutdown the current normal and direct prior-level oracle server instance. Stop all monitoring program, agency and other programs in ORACLE_HOME.\n\nii. Shutdown oracle example in oracle user account. Run sqlplus /nolog, and link by connect /as sysdba, then execute shutdown command. iii. Shutdown oracle monitoring method is: Start-up lsnrctl as oracle account, and execute stop command. 4.

Log table for log policy includes Log_Cmd_Table and Log_Scrt_Table.\n\nParameter Instructions\n\nLog_Sys_Table,\n\nThe related policy parameters need to be configured in config center as shown in Figure 61. The parameter instructions are as follows: 1. BackupPath: Saving path of database backup file\n\nConfidential and Proprietary Information of ZTE CORPORATION\n\n97\n\nNetNumen N31 (V4.2.0) Network Management System (General) User Manual (Volume I)\n\nFor example, BackupPath=d:/dbbackup or /export/home/oracle/backup 2. MysqlBinPath: abandon. 3. AlarmLogBackupPath_Table: Saving path of alarm and log backup file. For example, AlarmLogBackupPath_Table =d:/logbackup or /export/home/logbackup Notes: If the configured path does not exist, NM server creates it automatically. (Recommended this method) 4. isSaveByTime: Whether NM only save log in certain time or not. (Alarm log, operation log) Default: true\n\nRecommended: true\n\nWhen parameter value is true, the exceeding threshold log decides whether to backup them to AlarmLogBackupPath_Table according to Lock_BackupAlarm configuration and then delete these logs in NMS database. 5. The following parameters are used for appointing detailed saving time. \n\nHisAlarmSaveTime (day)\n\n\n\nLogSaveTime (day)\n\nDefault: 90 Recommended: 30\n\nDefault: 90\n\nRecommended: 60\n\n6. The following parameters are used for whether backup exceeding logs. Lock_BackupAlarm:\n\nTrue (Backup)/False(Doesn’t backup)\n\nLock_ BackupLog:\n\nTrue (Backup)/False(Doesn’t backup)\n\nisSaveByCount: Whether NM save certain quantity logs ( Alarm log, operation log) When parameter value is true, the exceeding threshold log decides whether to backup them to AlarmLogBackupPath_Table according to Lock_BackupAlarm configuration and then delete these logs in NMS database. 7. The following parameters are used for appointing detailed saving time. \n\n\n\nHisAlarmSaveCount:\n\nalarm quantity restriction.\n\nDefault: 300,000\n\nRecommended: 300,000\n\nLogSaveCount:\n\nOperation log quantity restriction.\n\nDefault: 100,000\n\nRecommended: 100,000\n\n8. The following parameters are used for backup exceeded logs.  \n\n98\n\nLock_BackupLog: True (Backup)/False (Doesn’t backup) Lock_BackupAlarm: deleted conditions.\n\nWhether\n\nConfidential and Proprietary Information of ZTE CORPORATION\n\nbackup\n\nalarms\n\nthat\n\nmeet\n\nChapter 3 NMS Installation\n\nDefault: true\n\nRecommended: true\n\nFor those alarms that meet deleted conditions (Time threshold and quantity threshold), backup before deleting from database. When the parameter value is true, backup the alarms before deleting that meet the conditions. When the parameter value is false, delete alarms directly without backup"
