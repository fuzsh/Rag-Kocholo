        "text": "ASHLAND The city's Center Run (also known as Town Creek) turned a florescent green in honor of St. Patrick's Day Wednesday to the delight of many who gathered to watch.\n\nMore: Ashland's Town Creek to go green for St. Patrick's Day\n\nCrowd gathers in Ashland to watch Town Creek go green\n\nA crowd of all ages cheered as Mayor Matt Miller, Assistant Fire Chief Gabe Campbell and Brad Bryan, owner of Ohio Fire Pizza and O'Bryan's, methodically poured green cups of dye into the creek. Some onlookers remarked how \"pretty\" it looked as they watched the dye swirl instantly transforming the water to a bright green.\n\nCampbell sported a traditional kilt to show off his Scottish history.\n\n'Everyone's Irish' on St. Patrick's Day\n\n\"We don't have a Scottish holiday, so everyone's Irish today,\" Campbell said with a laugh.\n\nPam Mowry, 62, of Ashland, has lived in the city for 30 years and was excited to see the city \"showcase the creek and its restorations.\"\n\nMiller recited an Irish blessing before adding the biodegradable agent to the water.\n\n\"May the road rise up to meet you.\n\nMay the wind always be at your back.\n\nMay the sun shine warm upon your face, and rains fall soft upon your fields.\n\nAnd until we meet again, may God help you and hold you in the palm of His hand.\"\n\nMiller had planned to check the creek throughout the day and add more dye as necessary, just to keep the St. Patrick's Day fun lasting a while longer.\n\nTen-year-old Jackson Vuttil, was \"excited because they were going to turn the creek green.\"\n\nDay for specialty items like leprechaun drinks\n\nBryan, whose Irish pub is a town favorite, continued his tradition of serving specialty items, such as leprechaun drinks, corned beef and cabbage and Irish stew.\n\n\"It's grown over time, we've been here 20 years in November, it's amazing,\" Bryan said. \"Ashland's really coming along. It's impressive, the number of restaurants that have come into town, we're all busy.\"\n\nLifelong Ashlander, Steve Huber, 70, was dressed in green from head to toe.\n\n\"It's awesome,\" Huber said. \"I'm an environmentalist. I love the land, love nature and all that, but this is fun.\"\n\nHuber agreed with Mowry and Bryan: Ashland is growing and changing for the better.\n\n\"I think in a sense, this means Ashland is really trying to make it a fun place,\" Huber said. \"Come to Ashland, we're having fun here.\"\n\nCoronavirus pandemic cancels 2020 plan to turn Ashland creek green\n\nMarch 15, 2020 was the beginning of lockdown for bars and restaurants. Due to this, the mayor canceled his plans to turn Center Run green.\n\n\"Last year stunk because they shut everything down, I don't think there's ever been a morning I haven't been at O'Bryan's for breakfast,\" Campbell said.\n\nThe atmosphere at Center Run never wavered, even after the dye was poured.\n\n\"Of course, don't we all need and love a holiday, especially after the year we've had?\" Mowry said.\n\n\"Anything that gets the community out is important,\" Bryan said. \"It's nice to be together, it's nice to have the community spirit, it's us against everything.\""
