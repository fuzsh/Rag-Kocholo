        "text": "Time was when dreams lay on other shores. Downtown New York, Seattle,\n\nCalifornia, and of course the Silicon Valley–these were the sole symbols of\n\nhope for an Indian technology professional. Want to work on core digital signal\n\nprocessing technologies or ASIC design? An engineer born to middle-class\n\nsalaried parents wanting to make big money? A technology professional wanting to\n\nmake a difference? Time was, when dreamers left home.\n\nNot anymore. It began in 1985 when Dallas-based Texas Instruments opened a\n\nsmall center in Bangalore–16 people working on design automation tools for IC\n\ndesign. Through most of the eighties, it remained a trickle. That changed\n\ndramatically in the mid-nineties–both qualitatively and quantitatively. More\n\nand more international IT companies began setting up development centers in\n\nIndia, and the kind of work they did here began to outgrow the\n\n\"Y2K-Fix\" stage, toward more cutting-edge technologies (see company\n\nboxes).\n\nIBM\n\nGlobal Services India\n\nEstablished:\n\n1997\n\nHeaded by:\n\nAbraham Thomas\n\nDevelopers/Engineers:\n\n3100\n\nPatents filed: 85\n\nMajor areas of work:\n\nIs IBM’s largest Global Resource Center outside the US.

The\n\ncenter at Noida is now the largest site of Cadence outside North America.\n\nCadence India is responsible for developing several critical and\n\nmainstream technology products across the entire spectrum of electronic\n\nand system design automation. Cadence India has evolved to be\n\ntechnological leader at the international level through representation in\n\nforums like the VITAL TAG, the IEEE Timing sub-committee, which is\n\nresponsible for defining the VITAL standard (VHDL initiative Towards ASIC\n\nLibraries) and in the Synthesis Inter-operability Working Group(SIWG)\n\nsetup under the auspices of VHDL international Motorola\n\nIndia\n\nYear of start up:\n\n1987\n\nHeaded by: Pramod\n\nSaxena\n\nMajor areas of work:\n\nFor almost 11 year now India has been a major hub for Motorola’s R&D\n\nefforts–the company set up the internal software development division or\n\nglobal software group (GSG) as Motorola India Electronics Limited (MIEL)\n\nin 1991 and has centers in Bangalore and Hyderabad. Besides, Motorola also\n\nestablished its chip development operations in the country in 1998 and has\n\nchip design labs at Noida and Gurgaon as part of Motorola’s\n\nsemiconductor products sector (SPS) division. The development center in\n\nBangalore focuses on software development for all Motorola handsets as\n\nwell as cutting edge research on wireless technologies. The software used\n\nin the Motorola Accompli PDA-cum-GSM Phone that was launched globally in\n\nmid 2001 was developed entirely in India Cognizant\n\nTechnology Solutions\n\nEstablished in:\n\n1994\n\nHeaded by: N\n\nLakshmi Narayanan\n\nNo of patents filed:\n\nNone\n\nMajor areas of work:\n\nCognizant Technology Solutions, a SEI — CMM level 5 company based in the\n\nUS, provides custom software development, integration and maintenance\n\nservices that link e-business with core information systems for companies\n\nworldwide. For Cognizant, India is the nerve center of its operations with\n\nmajor development centers located in Chennai, Kolkota, Pune and Bangalore.\n\nHowever, Chennai is its India headquarters and major operations and\n\ndevelopment activity happens here. Cognizant’s Chennai development\n\ncenter executes large scale off shore projects in areas like eBusiness\n\ndevelopment and integration, middleware technologies, CRM, ERP, mobile\n\ncommerce and focused vertical solutions in healthcare, banking and\n\ninsurance segments\n\nToday, Dataquest estimates the number of MNC IDCs in the country at over 50,\n\nmaking up a total of 35,000 developers, and a conservative Rs 6,000 crore in\n\nrevenues (estimated on a cost-plus basis). The Top 20 MNC IDCs alone (see DQ Top\n\n20 Volume 1–July 15, 2002) account for 25,000 developers and engineers, and\n\nabout Rs 4,500 crore in revenues.\n\nMore importantly, they cover the entire spectrum–service companies, ISVs,\n\nresearch centers, and even IT arms of international enterprises like Delphi and\n\nCanon, which have fanned out their IT needs to their India centers. All the Big\n\nFive are here (though after the IBM-PwC merger comes through, that will become\n\nthe Big 4)–as are 16 of the top 20 independent software vendors of the world.\n\nAs a phenomenon, the mushrooming of MNC development centers in the country\n\nhas largely gone unnoticed. For various reasons–information was fragmented,\n\nmost IDCs came in different stages, and even those that were obviously visible\n\nstarted small. Texas Instruments started with 16 people. Sun Micro’s India\n\nEngineering Center started with 30 developers. Adobe had three people to begin\n\nwith. These were experimental projects–low headcount, low investments and low\n\nrisk.\n\nBut not anymore. In a first focus of its kind, Dataquest looks at this\n\nfast-growing segment of the industry in a comprehensive manner, at the kind of\n\nwork these centers do, and at what this means for the Indian IT industry.\n\nCutting edge\n\nThe upsides are plenty. The most important is that MNC IDCs have brought to\n\nIndian shores work on some really cutting-edge technologies that will drive\n\nintellectual property growth from the subcontinent in the years to come. Texas\n\nInstruments alone has filed nearly 200 patents from India so far, the largest by\n\nany IT company in the country. Next in line is IBM Global Services India, with\n\n85.\n\nMore important than the number of patents filed, perhaps, is the fact that\n\nsome of these centers have become key drivers of technologies and products for\n\ntheir parent companies. Texas Instruments India, for one, will be driving TI’s\n\ncritical system-on-a-chip design projects in DSL and wireless LAN, both of which\n\nrequire a high degree of integration of analog energy management with RF and\n\ndigital technologies. Says Dr Biswadip (Bobby) Mitra, managing director of TI\n\nIndia, \"We started analog design early–in 1988. This is key because it\n\nhas given us 14 years of experience in this very experience-critical\n\ndomain.\"\n\nIGSI’s exports division is IBM’s largest global resource center outside\n\nthe United States. Says IGSI head Uday Shukla, \"We are at least three times\n\nas big as the second-largest IBM GRC, which is in Mexico.\" The India center\n\ntoday \"owns\"–read that as \"drives all development, new\n\nreleases, support and testing\"–IBM’s OS2, MQ Series and its transaction\n\nprocessing software, the TX Series.\n\nSimilarly, Sun Microsystems’ India Engineering Center, which started three\n\nyears ago with less than 30 people, mostly working on Solaris maintenance\n\nprojects, is now 450-strong. Today, 25% of the company’s workforce on SunONE–its\n\nWeb services platform–is based out of India. Large chunks of SunOne–Version\n\n6 of its app server, meta directory products, mail and calendar service–were\n\ndeveloped in India. Part of the SunMC–the management console for Solaris–was\n\ndesigned here. Says Vijay Anand, the IEC’s new site director who has come down\n\nfrom Santa Clara on a two-year assignment, \"The turning point for the IEC\n\ncame in 2000 when the company decided that India had product development and\n\nownership capabilities. We’ve filed for 10 patents already, most of which are\n\nin an advanced stage of approval. And you should see a lot more happening after\n\nthe recently-formed centralized software group sets its agenda. We are already\n\ndelivering Linux versions of many of SunOne’s products, and there’s a good\n\nchance that Sun’s Linux product line will come to India.\"\n\nAdobe is one of those rare product companies doing complete product shipment\n\nfrom India, including its PageMaker 7 in July last year (an upgrade) and Acrobat\n\nReader for Palm OS, this last conceived, designed and developed at its India\n\ncenter. The center started with three people in 1997–today, it staffs over 10%\n\nof Adobe’s worldwide engineering resources. Intel’s development center in\n\nIndia is among the fastest-growing in recent times and drives the company’s\n\n100% e-corporation initiative, among other things. Microsoft’s center in\n\nHyderabad–its second-largest R&D setup outside of Redmond–drives the\n\ncompany’s initiatives in inter-operability and Java support for Visual\n\nStudio.NET. The list could go on.\n\nRipple effects\n\nWhile this in itself is something to write home about, the phenomenon also\n\nhas other crucial fallouts.\n\nOne, it contributes to accelerated technology dissemination in the Indian IT\n\nindustry, in both structured and unstructured ways. An Oracle employee working\n\non its 9i database server leaves his job for another. And he takes with him all\n\nhis knowledge and its history with him. Cisco formally ties up with Wipro, HCL\n\nand Infosys–and the joint research centers contribute to a growing pool of\n\nknowledge in all three Indian companies. Nokia sponsors PhD students in IIT\n\nDelhi and sets up a fellowship in high-speed networking, driving research in\n\nthat area. Intel and Nokia tie up with the Indian Institute of Science,\n\naccelerating work in many domain areas. It’s a shattered glass effect.\n\nTwo, this has given Indian developers and engineers the kind of work and\n\nliving conditions that they would normally have had to go to the US for. They\n\nget to work on the technology they want, at the salaries they want.\n\nThree, its brought back a lot of Indians who’d gone abroad earlier. Most\n\nMNC IDCs are headed by Indians who’ve worked in the parent multinational in\n\nthe US for several years and who see this as an opportunity to come back home\n\nwithout jeopardizing their careers.\n\nFour, it has led to the inflow of a fair amount of foreign direct investment\n\nand the introduction of some world-class processes in companies–which,\n\notherwise, may have taken a little longer to happen.\n\nFive, it builds brand equity. For too long, India has been synonymous with\n\ncheap labor, and Indian IT services companies with bargain bazaars. This has\n\noften obscured the technology capability of Indian programmers and companies\n\ndespite some really competitive work from the likes of Wipro and HCL\n\nTechnologies. While many believe that India will never live down its core\n\n\"low-cost\" branding, MNC IDCs may well help change that perception in\n\nthe future.\n\nThe downsides\n\nThere are a few. The ability to put up their own offshore centers in India\n\nhas allowed both global IT companies and non-IT enterprises to bypass the Indian\n\nIT industry if they choose to do so. Normally, the pain factor has rarely been\n\nworth the effort. But the slowdown of the last year-and-a-half has made it worth\n\nthe effort, and Indian companies have often complained of being blackmailed–\"Lower\n\nyour billing rates or we’ll put up a development center of our own.\" This\n\nmakes the competitive landscape that much more difficult for Indian companies.\n\nMore importantly, it cuts into their outsourcing pie.\n\nSome Indian companies can deal with the challenge. Says Vivek Paul, CEO of\n\nWipro Technologies, \"Global IT services companies have not been a threat to\n\nus so far. They may move some of their IT work to India, but they don’t yet\n\nhave the concept of a global delivery model bang on, like we do. Global delivery\n\nis a disruptive process. I’m not sure that many of these companies are up to\n\nit.\" But there will be many Tier 2 companies that find it increasingly\n\ndifficult to compete.\n\nSecondly, the presence of these IDCs in India is subsidized. They come under\n\nthe ambit of software technology parks, with subsidized import duties and\n\nminimal export obligations. Often, export obligations are met through a minimal\n\ninternal billing rate mechanism (Indian arm does a minimal billing to the parent\n\ncompany)–and the money that comes in mostly goes for payment of salaries and\n\ninfrastructure costs. As such, though 35,000-odd developers contribute to the\n\nincome tax coffers, exports from IDCs are not \"true exports\", and\n\ntheir economic value add is minimal.\n\nWhich brings us to the final issue–that of \"value\" itself. As of\n\nnow, there’s no way to judge the true value of work done in the India\n\ndevelopment centers. While there may be some estimates possible on how much\n\nPageMaker 7.0 made for Adobe, for instance, most IDCs work on components of a\n\ntechnology or product whose final value will be many times higher than the\n\ncost-plus remittances made in India. The question then arises–is India getting\n\nthe true value of work being done here? More fundamentally, is this a valid\n\nquestion to ask?\n\nSome of this might change with the new tax regime under which 10% of all\n\nprofits of software companies are being taxed w.e.f. from April 1 this year.\n\nChances are that all IDCs will be subject to OECD norms on transfer-pricing\n\nmechanisms that will require them to restructure their remittances. These are\n\nemerging opportunities and threats of an emerging phenomenon. With a little time\n\nand a little wisdom, it is possible to make the best of both. Either way, as\n\noffshoring becomes increasingly important, this is a trend that's here to stay."
