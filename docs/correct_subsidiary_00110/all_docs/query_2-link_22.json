        "text": "The electronic exchange of data is now required for nearly every business and personal interaction. Even traditional tasks such as making a phone call, reading a book, or watching TV are now largely digital. This ever-growing demand for new digital information requires vast amounts of computing and networking equipment, which are stored in data centers.\n\nData centers have existed since the early days of computers but have evolved dramatically as technology becomes cheaper, smaller, and more advanced. The early data centers were typically comprised of one huge supercomputer, but modern versions are now home to thousands of servers connecting to various communication networks.\n\nThis shift is largely being driven by an exponential growth in data volumes. For example, IDC’s Data Age paper predicted a tenfold increase in data levels between 2018 and 2025. It predicts 175 zettabytes of data will be in existence by 2025 which, if you attempted to download at the current average internet speed, would take 1.8 billion years to download.\n\nThis mass of data now connects across multiple data centers, at the edge, and on public and private clouds. But it still has to be stored somewhere. So the modern data center remains as crucial as ever. However, it has to evolve to communicate across main on-premises facilities, various cloud locations, and cloud providers. As a result, the modern data center infrastructure has developed from on-premises physical servers to virtual infrastructures that support applications and workloads in multi-cloud environments.\n\nGiven the importance of the vast amounts of customer data businesses now have, as well as the applications and server resources they power, data centers now have dedicated data center firewalls to protect them.\n\nThe essential components of any data center often include cybersecurity systems, firewalls, routers, servers, storage systems, and switches.\n\nA core commonality of all data centers is servers. A data center server is a high-performance computer that is packed with a lot more memory. It is vastly faster and a more powerful processor. A server or group of servers may be dedicated to a single task, multiple applications, or a specific client.\n\nStorage devices, such as hard-disk, solid-state, and robotic tape drives are important to helping any data center run these servers. Another vital component is networking and communication equipment, which is necessary to maintain a high-bandwidth network between servers. This is comprised of routers, switches, network interface controllers, and endless miles of cables that help information to flow through the data center.\n\nIn addition to this hardware, data centers rely on software to run it. This includes various operating systems and applications that run on their servers, clustering framework software like MapReduce or Hadoop, and virtualization software to reduce the number of physical servers."
