        "text": "It did however make me curious about whether or not people are using UPS/Surge protectors for their TV's.\n\nA majority will do what the party's central committee orders them to believe. Only the fewest actually know what does and does not work by first learning how things work - with numbers.\n\nWhen is power to your TV 'dirtiest'? When that UPS is in battery backup mode. No problem. Since, as another has noted, best protection is already inside the TV. Necessary to even protect from UPS power.\n\nOr read UPS specification numbers. Where is one number that claims to protect TV hardware? Good luck finding one. Most only tell you that advertising and hearsay is truth. Facts, numbers, basic engineering principles, and over 100 years of experience must be wrong. Where does one even provide a reason why he should be believed? None do because that is called brainwashing.\n\nHow many joules does that UPS claim to 'block' or 'absorb'? Hundreds? Near zero. Even power strip protectors cite more robust protection. Why do so many recommend less protection from a UPS? Again, the naive are easily brainwashed by subjective reasoning. Many only believe a first thing they are told to believe. Many believe a UPS must be better because it is more expensive. Not one technical fact or number say that. Tiniest protection is in a UPS.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Post every number listed in UPS's category called \"Surge Protection\".\n\nWe design this stuff. Even replaced damaged semiconductors to trace that surge path - to discover why damage happened. In one case, protection that was too close to electronics and too far from earth ground earthed a surge destructively through a network of powered off computers. Does not matter electronics were on or off. That surge was all but invited inside by a naive homeowner. It then went hunting for earth ground via all household appliances. It was given a best and destructive path by a plug-in protector through nearest electronics - powered on or off\n\nThat protector did exactly what its manufacturer claimed it would do.\n\nNothing in that TV damage says the UPS did anything useful. Just as likely - dirtiest power from that UPS compromised a ribbon cable. Then motion (vibration) means that damage caused a failure. Correlation can only report coincidence.\n\nThat summary only says the UPS did exactly what it says it would do - ineffective hardware protection.\n\nMeanwhile, the fewer and informed what to protect best protection inside all appliances from a rare and actually destructive anomaly? The informed spend about $1 per appliance for superior, effective, and proven solutions. A properly earthed 'whole house' solution is how protection (even from direct lightning strikes) was done over 100 years ago. So many today don't know anything about it. Subjective reasoning, hearsay, and advertising forgot to mention well proven science.\n\nAnother wondered if his protector had expired. Quite possible. Anyone can read specification numbers. Near zero protectors quickly degrade or completely fail on a first surge. Meanwhile, the informed properly earth that 'whole house' solution so that protectors do not fail or degrade for decades - even after multiple direct lightning strikes. Discussed are two words: ineffective and effective.\n\nWhy would anyone spend tens or hundreds of dollars on near zero (ineffective) protection? Best protection, absolutely necessary to even protect that near zero UPS or power strip, costs about $1 per. Numbers followed by more numbers contradict what most were told to believe by the central committee. Most never learn that a protector is only as effective as its earth ground. These well proven solutions come from other companies well known by any guy for integrity.\n\nSame here. I don't have any antenna connected either.\n\nDirect strikes to antennas are routine and not destructive IF earth ground is done properly. Two case studies demonstrate this.\n\nFirst was a Nebraska radio station where engineers also did not understand protection (probably educated by those magic boxes sold in stores). They even disconnected earth grounds on speculation that ground was making direct strikes happen more often.\n\nSolution was obvious and easy. Earth grounds were restored, upgraded, and even interconnected. Each earth ground (not any protector) is the layer of protection. Even the outer protection layer was upgraded. Upgraded was earth ground on a telephone pole and incoming AC electric:\n\nhttp://www.copper.org/applications/elec ... raska.html\n\nIn Orange County Florida, 911 emergency response centers suffered damage due to lightning. Direct strikes without damage to anything is normal, easily done, and only causes damage when a human makes mistakes. These facilities stopped having damage when earth grounds were upgraded. No protectors were installed. Again, protectors do not do protection. Protectors are effective only when installed as a connecting device to earth ground:\n\nhttp://www.psihq.com/AllCopper.htm\n\nElectronics atop the Empire State Building suffer about 23 direct strikes annually without damage.\n\nSimilar protection can exist in any home. First that antenna must connect as short and direct as possible to earth. Second, the incoming coax cable must route to single point earth ground (service entrance) before entering a building. That coax cable often does not and need not have a protector. A hardwire must connect that cable low impedance (ie less than 10 feet) to single point earth ground. The same earth ground that also makes irrelevant a most common incoming path surges: AC electric.\n\nLightning (or some other surge) striking many blocks down the street is a direct strike incoming to every household appliance. Surges hunt for earth ground. If not earthed before entering a building, then that surge will find appliances to make a connection to earth. Adjacent protector can even make that damage easier. No way around over 100 years of well proven science.\n\nEvery wire inside every incoming cable must connect low impedance (ie less than 3 meters) to a common (single point) earth ground. Telco installs an effective protector for free - as required by code. Cable TV coax must make a same low impedance (ie hardwire has no sharp bends) connection without any protector. If any wire (underground lawn sprinkler, invisible dog fence) enters without first making that low impedance (ie hardwire has no splices) connection, then appliance damage is direct traceable to homeowner mistakes.\n\nNo UPS or plug-in protector does or even claims to provide effective protection. But most listen to hearsay, wild speculation, advertising, salemen, and subjective reasoning. Many eyes glaze over with science and specification numbers. Those people (not lightning) are a reason for damage.\n\nAn effective solution will always answer this question. Where do hundreds of thousands of joules harmlessly dissipate? No UPS or plug-in box (a profit center) can answer that question. If a surge is not inside a building, then best protection already inside every appliance is not overwhelmed. A protector is and always was only as effective as its earth ground.\n\nTV in the office is on a dedicated outlet with a ZeroSurge surge protector wired directly to house ground.\n\n...\n\nSurges appear to be very rare around here, but brown outs more common. My electronics seem to have a much longer life if plugged into a decent UPS.\n\nThat dedicated outlet with a Zerosurge \"series mode filter\" (it is not a surge protector) is not even connected to safety ground. If a tiny 100 amp surge tried to get to earth, impedance means that receptacle would be at something less than 12,000 volts. Where is protection (reason one)?\n\nSecond, a series mode filter does not try to connect a surge to any ground. As even stated in its advertising. A Series mode filter can only 'block' *and* 'absorb' a surge. Combine its specifications number using some engineering concepts. It can only 'absorb' about 600 joules.\n\nAs a series mode filter, when its components reach saturation, then it stops 'absorbing' or 'blocking'; start acting like a wire connected directly to appliances. A 600 joule surge typically does no damage. So you spent massive sums on a protector that can only protect from surges that are near zero. Destructive surges easily blow right through.\n\nThird, Zerosurge discovered sales increase massively by selling what was only as series mode filter as a surge protector. Zerosurge knows eyes glaze over with spec numbers. By simply calling it a surge protector in advertising (making subjective claims), then profits have increased massively. The scam works because, for example, so many here ignorantly ignore electrical facts and numbers. Then claim to be experts using their emotions and insults.\n\nFour, a ground wire inside that series mode filter does not make any connection to ground. They even say that in their advertising. Earth ground only connects through that filter directly to the appliance.\n\nZerosurge says their filter has no connection to earth. Their filter can only 'absorb' about 600 joules. And wire impedance (to wall receptacle) is so massive as to all but not connect to earth. Every one of four reasons say why it is virtually no protection.\n\nMeanwhile where is the Zerosurge connection that must also filter the incoming TV signal. If any wire connects to that TV without going through a common protector, then all protection is compromised. Reasons five.\n\nBrownouts did not damage electronics as defined by international design standards even long before PCs existed. For example, voltage can drop so low that incandescent bulbs dim to 40% intensity. A computer must work safely and normally even when AC voltage drops that low. As even defined in the original Intel ATX specifications.\n\nSecond, if a brownout is destructive, then one can list an at risk part. Nobody does (which is why they post insults). Good luck citing numbers from any part's datasheet that says a low voltage is destructive. That myth is unsupported by facts from reality. That myth only exists because emotion creates a conclusion. They assume. If a brownout is potentially harmful to motorized appliances, then it must be destructive to electronics. It is not.\n\nThird, how often have your incandescent bulbs dimmed to 40% intensity? That is potentially harmful to motors. And perfectly good power for computers. We test electronic designs by intentionally lowering voltages. To learn the voltage at which electronics always power off (without damage). As we designers routinely did even 40 years ago.\n\nTom MacIntyre demonstrates this in \"Motheboard Problem? Post Problem?\"\n\nWe operate everything on an isolated variac, which means that I can control the voltage going into the unit I am working on from about 150 volts down to zero. This enables us to verify power regulation for over and under-voltage situations. ...\n\nSwitching supplies ... can and will regulate with very low voltages on the AC line in; the best I've seen was a TV which didn't die until I turned the variac down to 37 VAC! A brownout wouldn't have even affected the picture on that set.\n\nNot die as in damage. Die as in power off. Brownouts only cause power off. That power off is only a threat to unsaved data.\n\nThree reasons why brownouts are not destructive. Fourth, if a brownout is destructive, then power off is also destructive. On power off, internal voltages slowly drop. Every power off is only a slow brownout. How often have you destroyed electronics by powering off? Good. Name the damaged part. A fourth reason why brownouts do not damage electronics.\n\nIf brownouts are feared, then a UPS is on your refrigerator, furnace, dishwasher, garage door opener, vacuum cleaner, and central air. Brownouts do not even damage the 'at greatest risk' appliances. That standard existed long before transistors existed; before you or I even existed. To protect those appliances, a utility must provide sufficient voltage or cut off all power. A fifth reason why brownouts are not destructive.\n\nYour concern is a rare transient, maybe once every seven years, that is an actual threat to appliances. Even a UPS needs that effective protection. One protector that does something useful (and costs about $1 per protected appliance) must be properly earthed where all wires enter a building. This well proven solution comes from other companies well known for integrity. And it is effective because a protector is only as effective as its earth ground.\n\nEarth ground clearly is not found in any wall receptacle. Appliance protection is always about connection to and quality of single point earth ground. As well understood even over 100 years ago.\n\nI will admit that my emphasis was in telecommunications and I really, really didn't like power/control classes and that it's been 25+ years since I've done any real EE (my expertise lies in other areas of Engineering), but the gist of what I read was that voltage sags can end up destroying the capacitors in Switching Mode power supplies eventually - basically decreasing MTBF. I've also worked with a number of MOTS (Military of the Shelf) computer system vendors that indicated Voltage Sags could be problematic. I do not have a detailed understanding of the specifics, but am using what I've learned through the years. The spec sheet sheet indicates unlimited Joule rating due to current limiting (although the max voltage seems very low to me at 6000 volts).\n\nHonestly westom, I have a hard time following your train of thought/explanation. Secondly, it's not me posting insults. All I said was that \"Surges appear to be very rare around here, but brown outs more common. My electronics seem to have a much longer life if plugged into a decent UPS\". Where is the insult? I also said seems, no definitive assertion. Honestly both you and Jim Z come across as condescending and thus ultimately not helpful. I want to be clear on this, that is what I infer from reading your posts, it may not be intent, but it feels that way. I will also state that I come across that way sometimes unintentionally.\n\nForgive me, but I've some pretty significant medical issues and sometimes the pain impacts my ability to think clearly (i.e. no focus) and can increase irratabilty. Most of the issues I've seen mitigated with my UPSs are what I would call power bounces (honestly not moving goal posts, just thinking more clearly) - were the power cuts off, back on, and off, all under a minute. Anecdotally, this particular sequence killed more of my hard drives that I care to admit. I've had much less incidence of hard drive failure after the UPS have been installed (RAIDS still using spinning rust, most of my computers are SSD now). I know it's circumstantial, but when hard drives die immediatly following a \"bounce\" then the \"bounce\" is a likely contributor. \"Bounces\" were a frequent occurrence around here for years, but seem not to occur as much lately.\n\nCurrently I have 26 drives in RAIDs at the house currently (with another 6 or 7 scattered around as external or internal back drives), not nearly enough for statistical evidence, but enough I want them on UPS.\n\nSecondly, ... All I said was that \"Surges appear to be very rare around here, but brown outs more common. My electronics seem to have a much longer life if plugged into a decent UPS\".\n\nAn engineer never makes conclusions from observation. Some saw light bulbs fail when switched on. Then wild speculation assumed power cycling destroys a light bulb. It never did. Obvious when one first learns facts (such as how a bulb fails). That conclusion was / is classic junk science. A conclusions made without a valid hypothesis can only be junk science.\n\nSame applies to speculation that voltage variations cause increased wear or failure. To make that conclusion means numbers. Conclusions from observation are contradicted by underlying science and how failures actually happen. So no hypothesis exists. No hypothesis creates a junk science conclusion.\n\nHow often do your incandescent bulbs dim to 50% intensity? Even that is perfectly normal voltage for electronics. If brownouts are causing damage, then failures are first observed in a refrigerator, furnace, dishwasher, vacuum cleaner, washing machine, or central air. Long before electronic damage, motorized appliances are failing. We know from EE what causes that damage. Even news reports state that motors suffer when voltage is too low. So an AC utility cannot lower voltage by more than 5%. Where is a list of so many motorized appliances damage by a destructive low voltage?\n\nAnother EE concept. Inductors will saturate. Then that inductor acts like a wire. How does Zerosurge do protection once inductors saturate - have absorbed too much energy? It doesn't. A ZeroSruge may saturate at about 600 joules - near zero protection. ZeroSurge advertising says it does not fail catastrophically like MOVs. From basic circuit theory, a saturated coil is not destroyed. So Zerosurge says their protector does not fail. Of course. It simply lets a surge pass directly into attached appliances once a tiny 600 joules saturate the filter. Fortunately, electronics are more robust - will easily consumer a 600+ joule surge without damage. Wild speculation (a conclusion only from observation) assumed a Zerosurge did what the electronics actually did.\n\nZeroSurge advertises that is does not '*contaminate*' ground. Of course. A series mode filter obviously need not connect to safety ground. A Zerosurge does same with or without a safety ground wire - as even their advertising states.\n\nHow does Zerosurge protect from a surge that is hundreds of thousands of joules? They forget to mention what must always exist in honest discussions: reasons why with numbers. Subjective claims are akin to a lie. It is only a series mode filter - a superb device to filter out noise. As a protector, it is tens of times too expensive and near zero protection. That protection claim is only made subjectively - by them and now by you.\n\nWhere are numbers that define each potentially harmful anomaly? No numbers claim protection. Your Zerosurge will conduct 100,000 amps but only absorb maybe 600 joules. Zerosurge is not damaged. Attached appliances must absorb that hundreds of thousands of joules - catastrophically. Effective protection always answers this question. Where do hundreds of thousands of joules harmlessly dissipate? Not in that Zerosurge - that can connect 100,000 amps into attached appliances - as spec numbers state.\n\nThat question is routinely answered in telco COs many decades before transistors existed. A question asked and answered even in 1950s papers in a legendary Bell System Technical Journal.\n\nBest protection means a potentially destructive current found earth ground BEFORE entering a building. As was well understood over 100 years ago. Then no destructive current is inside. As standard in all facilities that cannot have damage - including COs, radio stations, rocket launch facilities, power distributions systems, and munitions dumps. Even defined in Sun Microsystems' \"Planning guide for Sun Server room\" and Mil-Spec documents.\n\nEquipment used in modern industrial plants, such as process controllers, PLCs, adjustable speed drives, and robots, becomes more sensitive to voltage sags as the complexity of the equipment increases.\n\nThat quote is subjective. What was *assumed* to be hardware damage is simply operational interruption. Early microprocessors (ie Microchip) one used the classic resistor and capacitor to detect power anomalies. That has long been insufficient to determine when voltage is too low. For decades, voltage supervisors (ie Dallas Semiconductor, Maxim) were required so that electronics will properly power off when voltage gets unstable. Again, nobody said that causes hardware damage. But it could create operational failures that were acceptable generations ago and never acceptable today.\n\nNone of that says anything about electronics hardware damage. If that citation was discussing hardware damage, then perspective (ie numbers) also were provided. The quote was only subjective. Good enough for easily manipulated and deceived business school graduates. Woefully insufficient for an engineer.\n\nView international design standards that define electronic operation over all voltages. For example, the CBEMA standard (that existed before PCs existed) defined (in a graph) all brownout voltages with this expression in all capital letters: \"*No Damage Region*\". They (engineers) define that with numbers. Low voltage must not damage properly designed electronics ... even before PCs existed.\n\nIf a brownout causes capacitor failure, then I was reading what inside that capacitor failed; with numbers that say how much. Nothing posted - only subjective speculation. Subjective is akin to a fable or scam. I have yet to see one fact that says a brownout is destructive. And have yet to see numbers that define a Zerosurge as effective (it is only a superb noise filter).\n\nFor over 100 years, protection has always been about where hundreds of thousands of joules harmlessly dissipate. A protector is only as effective as its earth ground - which clearly is not a wall receptacle safety ground.\n\nTwo completely different and unrelated anomalies (surge and brownout) are defined in blunt technical terms - with numbers."
