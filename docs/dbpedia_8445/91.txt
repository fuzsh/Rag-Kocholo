Burkina Faso is a landlocked country in Western Africa with a population of 21.3 million. The majority of the population live in rural areas, with 80% of people working in agriculture. Urbanisation is estimated to reach 35% by 2026 (CIA World Factbook, 2021).

Burkina Faso is one of the countries with the lowest Human Development Index in the world. As of 2019, it is ranked 182 out of 189.

Living in a landlocked country, climate change, landscape degradation and slow economic development makes the country’s population particularly vulnerable to economic shocks, which limit vulnerable people’s access to food, as well as housing.

Forced eviction is a common problem in the country with people forced to leave their homes to make way for infrastructure projects (Source: Habitat World Map).

Access to sanitation and electricity is poor, while insufficient investment in education and infrastructure make any development gains hard to maintain. (World Food Programme, 2018).

As of 2021, More than 1.2 million people were internally displaced because of violent conflict, with an additional 20,000 displaced because of natural disasters. The country has been affected by climate change leading to increased flooding, landslides and droughts (Internal Displacement, 2021).
