        "meta_description": "These geotiff rasters, at a spatial resolution of 3 arc-seconds (approximately 100m at the equator), contain estimates of the total population of persons aged under 18 (0-17), 18 to 45 (18-45) and over 45 (46+) per grid cell across Burkina Faso, to support vaccination planning. These estimates were calculated from the existing 2019 gridded population estimates (WorldPop and Institut National de la Statistique et de la Demographie du Burkina Faso, 2020) which included age- and sex- structured population estimates for 5 year age classes, based on the age and sex breakdown of population totals at the national level, from the preliminary census results.",
