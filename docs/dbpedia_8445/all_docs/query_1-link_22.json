        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nMany of Burkina Fasoâs ethnic groups arrived in the region between the 12th and 15th centuries. The Gurma and Mossi peoples established several of the largest kingdoms in the area and used horse-mounted warriors in military campaigns. Of the various Mossi kingdoms, the most powerful were Ouagadougou and Yatenga. In the late 19th century, European states competed for control of the region. France eventually conquered the area and established it as a French protectorate.\n\nThe area achieved independence from France in 1960 and changed its name to Burkina Faso in 1984. Repeated military coups were common in the countryâs first few decades. The last successful coup occurred in 1987 when Blaise COMPAORE deposed the former president, established a government, and ruled for 27 years. In October 2014, COMPAORE resigned following protests against his repeated efforts to amend the constitution's two-term presidential limit. An interim administration led a year-long transition period organizing presidential and legislative elections. In November 2015, Roch Marc Christian KABORE was elected president; he was reelected in November 2020.\n\nTerrorist groups - including groups affiliated with Al-Qaâida and the Islamic State - began attacks in the country in 2016 and conducted attacks in the capital in 2016, 2017, and 2018. By late 2021, insecurity in Burkina Faso had displaced 1.4 million people and led to significant jumps in humanitarian needs and food insecurity. In addition to terrorism, the country faces a myriad of problems including high population growth, recurring drought, pervasive and perennial food insecurity, and limited natural resources. It is one of the worldâs poorest countries.\n\nÂ\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nWestern Africa, north of Ghana\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n13 00 N, 2 00 W\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 274,200 sq km\n\nland: 273,800 sq km\n\nwater: 400 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 76\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly larger than Colorado\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 3,611 km\n\nborder countries (6): Benin 386 km; Cote d'Ivoire 545 km; Ghana 602 km; Mali 1325 km; Niger 622 km; Togo 131 km\n\nCoastline\n\n0 km (landlocked)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nClimate\n\nthree climate zones including a hot tropical savanna with a short rainy season in the southern half, a tropical hot semi-arid steppe climate typical of the Sahel region in the northern half, and small area of hot desert in the very north of the country bordering the Sahara Desert\n\nTerrain\n\nmostly flat to dissected, undulating plains; hills in the west and southeast; occupies an extensive plateau with savanna that is grassy in the north and gradually gives way to sparse forests in the south\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Tena Kourou 749 m\n\nlowest point: Mouhoun (Black Volta) River 200 m\n\nmean elevation: 297 m\n\nNatural resources\n\ngold, manganese, zinc, limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice, salt\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 44.2% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 22% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 37% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 21.93% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 19.3% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 36.5% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n550 sq km (2016)\n\nMajor rivers (by length in km)\n\nVolta river source (shared with Ghana [m]) - 1,600 km\n\nnote â [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\n\nMajor watersheds (area sq km)\n\nAtlantic Ocean drainage: Niger (2,261,741 sq km), Volta (410,991 sq km)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nMost of the population is located in the center and south.

More than 65% of the population is under the age of 25, and the population is growing at 3% annually. Mortality rates, especially those of infants and children, have decreased because of improved health care, hygiene, and sanitation, but women continue to have an average of almost 6 children. Even if fertility were substantially reduced, todayâs large cohort entering their reproductive years would sustain high population growth for the foreseeable future. Only about a third of the population is literate and unemployment is widespread, dampening the economic prospects of Burkina Fasoâs large working-age population.\n\nMigration has traditionally been a way of life for Burkinabe, with seasonal migration being replaced by stints of up to two years abroad. Cote dâIvoire remains the top destination, although it has experienced periods of internal conflict. Under French colonization, Burkina Faso became a main labor source for agricultural and factory work in Cote dâIvoire. Burkinabe also migrated to Ghana, Mali, and Senegal for work between the world wars. Burkina Faso attracts migrants from Cote dâIvoire, Ghana, and Mali, who often share common ethnic backgrounds with the Burkinabe. Despite its food shortages and high poverty rate, Burkina Faso has become a destination for refugees in recent years and hosts about 26,000 Malian refugees as of July 2022.\n\n(2018)\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 43.58% (male 4,606,350/female 4,473,951)\n\n15-24 years: 20.33% (male 2,121,012/female 2,114,213)\n\n25-54 years: 29.36% (male 2,850,621/female 3,265,926)\n\n55-64 years: 3.57% (male 321,417/female 423,016)\n\n65 years and over: 3.16% (male 284,838/female 374,057) (2020 est.)\n\n2022 population pyramid\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 87.4\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 82.6\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 4.8\n\npotential support ratio: 20.9 (2021 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 17.9 years\n\nmale: 17 years\n\nfemale: 18.7 years (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 216\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n2.53% (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 20\n\nBirth rate\n\n33.57 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 19\n\nDeath rate\n\n7.71 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 103\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-0.61 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 127\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nMost of the population is located in the center and south.

this means it can be spread more easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an âinfectedâ person who received oral polio vaccine; the CDC recommends that before any international travel, anyone unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, or with an unknown polio vaccination status should complete the routine polio vaccine series; before travel to any high-risk destination, the CDC recommends that adults who previously completed the full, routine polio vaccine series receive a single, lifetime booster dose of polio vaccine\n\nObesity - adult prevalence rate\n\n5.6% (2016)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 175\n\nAlcohol consumption per capita\n\ntotal: 7.28 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nbeer: 1 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nwine: 0.08 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nspirits: 0.31 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nother alcohols: 5.88 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 57\n\nTobacco use\n\ntotal: 14.3% (2020 est.)\n\nmale: 22.1% (2020 est.)\n\nfemale: 6.4% (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 108\n\nChildren under the age of 5 years underweight\n\n16.4% (2019)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 32\n\nEducation expenditures\n\n5.5% of GDP (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 55\n\nLiteracy\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 39.3%\n\nmale: 49.2%\n\nfemale: 31% (2018)\n\nSchool life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)\n\ntotal: 9 years\n\nmale: 9 years\n\nfemale: 9 years (2020)\n\nYouth unemployment rate (ages 15-24)\n\ntotal: 8.6%\n\nmale: 8.9%\n\nfemale: 8.4% (2018)\n\nEnvironment\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\nrecent droughts and desertification severely affecting agricultural activities, population distribution, and the economy;

in Centre-Nord and Sahel regions, insecurity continues to cause population displacements and, as of March 2022, about 1.85 million people had been displaced and required assistance; domestic cereal production in 2021 was estimated at a below-average level due to effects of adverse weather and civil conflict, further aggravating conditions; abnormally high prices of food are also a contributory factor that have constrained access to food; the coup dâÃ©tat that occurred in January 2022 is an additional factor that could increase civil insecurity and further stress food insecurity conditions (2022)\n\nWaste and recycling\n\nmunicipal solid waste generated annually: 2,575,251 tons (2015 est.)\n\nmunicipal solid waste recycled annually: 309,030 tons (2005 est.)\n\npercent of municipal solid waste recycled: 12% (2005 est.)\n\nMajor rivers (by length in km)\n\nVolta river source (shared with Ghana [m]) - 1,600 km\n\nnote â [s] after country name indicates river source;

Irregular patterns of rainfall, poor soil, and the lack of adequate communications and other infrastructure contribute to the economyâs vulnerability to external shocks. About 80% of the population is engaged in subsistence farming and cotton is the main cash crop. The country has few natural resources and a weak industrial base.\n\nÂ\n\nCotton and gold are Burkina Fasoâs key exports - gold has accounted for about three-quarters of the countryâs total export revenues. Burkina Fasoâs economic growth and revenue depends largely on production levels and global prices for the two commodities. The country has seen an upswing in gold exploration, production, and exports.\n\nÂ\n\nIn 2016, the government adopted a new development strategy, set forth in the 2016-2020 National Plan for Economic and Social Development, that aims to reduce poverty, build human capital, and to satisfy basic needs. A new three-year IMF program (2018-2020), approved in 2018, will allow the government to reduce the budget deficit and preserve critical spending on social services and priority public investments.\n\nÂ\n\nWhile the end of the political crisis has allowed Burkina Fasoâs economy to resume positive growth, the countryâs fragile security situation could put these gains at risk. Political insecurity in neighboring Mali, unreliable energy supplies, and poor transportation links pose long-term challenges.\n\nReal GDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$45.16 billion (2020 est.)\n\n$44.27 billion (2019 est.)\n\n$41.88 billion (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 114\n\nReal GDP growth rate\n\n6.4% (2017 est.)\n\n5.9% (2016 est.)\n\n3.9% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 24\n\nReal GDP per capita\n\n$2,200 (2020 est.)\n\n$2,200 (2019 est.)\n\n$2,100 (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 208\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$14.271 billion (2018 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices)\n\n-3.2% (2019 est.)\n\n1.9% (2018 est.)\n\n1.4% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 1\n\nCredit ratings\n\nStandard & Poors rating: B (2017)\n\nnote: The year refers to the year in which the current credit rating was first obtained.\n\nGDP -
