It is estimated that between 600,000 and 1.3 million people work in the sector.\n\n2002 – The government introduced a law on pastoralism that guarantees herders “the right of access to pastoral areas, the right of equitable use of natural resources and the mobility of herds”[13] . To support this sector, the government has also created 27 pastoral zones covering thousands of hectares, of which about ten are actually operational.\n\n2011 – Months of unrest, including a mutiny.\n\n2012 – Between 2000 and 2012, it is estimated that domestic and foreign investors obtained 288,044 hectares of land in Burkina Faso. Of these, the bulk (131,442 hectares) was for mining, 43,102 hectares for agribusiness and 113,500 hectares for biofuels.\n\n– Substantial revisions to the 2009 Rural Land Law were adopted in 2012, to the long-standing framework land tenure law, the Réorganisation Agraire et Foncière (RAF)\n\n2014 – President Compaore steps aside following massive protests against plans to extend his rule. A transitional government takes charge.\n\n2015 – Acting President Kafando faces down a coup attempt by presidential guard allies of Blaise Compaore. In November, former Prime Minister Roch Marc Christian Kabore won the presidential election.\n\n2020 – Burkinabe government is making significant efforts to promote women’s access to irrigated plots. In 2020, the government allocated 45.94% of the new developed areas to women, thus exceeding its target of 30% . In addition, the government seeks to promote women’s access to agricultural inputs and equipment. A study reveals that these policies have positive effects and contribute to “food security, economic growth and improved living conditions for women”.\n\nJune 2021 -At least 160 people were killed in an artisanal gold mine in the village of Solhan, claimed by JNIM (an al Qaeda-affiliated Salafi-jihadist insurgent organization) Four months later, 53 gendarmerie and three civilians were killed.\n\n23 January 2022 – a coup d’état, initiated by military leaders (similar to Mali and other West African countries) overthrows the president of the country, Roch Marc Christian Kaboré. The coup d’état was based on the increased Islamic insurgency and increased insecurity and the president’s inability to handle the situation. ECOWAS and the African Union have, due to the coup, suspended Burkina Faso’s membership. Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba has been appointed interim president.\n\n1984: Promulgation of Ordinance No.o 84-050/CNR/PRES of 4 August 1984 on agrarian and land reorganization in Burkina Faso.\n\nThe law establishes the State as the eminent owner of the land following the Sankarist revolution.\n\n2002: Law no 034-2002/AN of 14 November 2002 on the orientation law relating to pastoralism\n\nThis law aims to secure the practice of pastoralism in Burkina Faso.\n\n2009: Adoption of Law No.o 034-2009/AN of 16 June 2009 on rural land tenure in Burkina Faso\n\nThis law aims to recognize and formalize customary land rights.\n\n2012: Adoption of Law No.o 034-2012/AN of 2 July 2012 on agrarian and land reorganization in Burkina Faso\n\nThis law establishes a land domain for municipalities and individuals. The State is therefore no longer the sole holder of the national land estate.\n\n2015 : Adoption of the Law n° 036-2015/CNT on the mining code of Burkina Faso\n\nThis law revises the previous mining codes in order to increase the profits from industrial gold mining."
