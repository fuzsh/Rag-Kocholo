The July 2019 population estimate by the United Nations was 20,321,378.[10] The country's official language of government and business is French. Roughly 50% of the population speaks the Mossi language natively.[11] Formerly called the Republic of Upper Volta (1958–1984), the country was renamed \"Burkina Faso\" on 4 August 1984 by erstwhile President Thomas Sankara. Its citizens are known as Burkinabé (/bɜːrˈkiːnəbeɪ/ bur-KEE-nə-bay). Its capital is Ouagadougou."
