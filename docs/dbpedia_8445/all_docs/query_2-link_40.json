        "text": "All figures are from the years 2021 to 2024.\n\nInfluences on the average age\n\nVarious factors have an influence on the age of a country's population. In economic nations and highly developed countries in particular, reliable nutrition and medical care leads to higher life expectancy and thus to an increase in the age of the population. A higher proportion of women also results in a slight increase, as women generally have a higher life expectancy.\n\nHowever, the birth rate has the greatest influence. In almost all countries with higher incomes, the birth rate is remarkably low (cf. Population growth by country) and very high in poorer countries.\n\nIn most industrialized countries, for example, the lack of young people is currently causing the average age to rise, while in less developed countries, the age is stagnating or even falling.\n\n* The marked countries are not independent and sovereign states, but dependent territories of other states. Cf. also our article What is a country?\n\nData sources\n\nMedian age is published every five years by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. The CIA's Factbook also lists these data. Life expectancy is based on data from the Population and Vital Statistics Report of the United Nations. All data are projections or estimates based on available population figures."
