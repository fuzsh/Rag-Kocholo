Since, infrastructure projects are typically capital intensive, conventional form of financing like budgetary allocation by Burkina Faso government cannot meet this requirement. The most obvious option to create the infrastructure at fast pace is to involve the Private Sector through PPP (Public Private Partnership). There are various modes of engagement between the private sector and the government of Burkina Faso. TendersOnTime covers all types of PPP models in Burkina Faso. Some of these models are:\n\nBurkina Faso Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) Projects\n\nBurkina Faso Build-Own-Operate (BOO) Projects\n\nBurkina Faso Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) Projects\n\nBurkina Faso Build-Operate-Lease-Transfer (BOLT) Projects\n\nBurkina Faso Lease-Develop-Operate (LDO) Projects\n\nBurkina Faso Rehabilitate-Operate-Transfer (ROT) Projects\n\nBurkina Faso Design, Build, Finance and Operate (DBFO) Projects\n\nIn order to assess Government Capability to Prepare, Procure and Manage projects on PPP basis, The World Bank has prepared a benchmarking report in 2017 and have evaluated various countries on the basis of below parameters:\n\nPreparation of PPPs\n\nProcurement of PPPs\n\nUnsolicited Proposals\n\nPPP Contract Management\n\nTo know how Burkina Faso performs on these parameters please view the full report: Benchmarking Public-Private Partnerships Procurement\n\nInformation on Funded Tenders and Projects in Burkina Faso:\n\nMultilateral development banks or Multilateral Funding Agencies plays an important role in nation building by providing loans and grants at a concessional rate to developing countries.
