        "text": "Burkina Faso People Stats\n\nDefinitions\n\nAge distribution > Median age: The median age of the country's residents. This is the age most people are in the country.\n\nAge distribution > Population aged 0-14: Percentage of total population aged 0-14.\n\nAge distribution > Population aged 0-14 > Total: Number of people aged 0-14.\n\nAge distribution > Population aged 15-24 > Percent: Percentage of total population aged 15-24.\n\nAge distribution > Population aged 15-24 > Total: Number of people aged 15-24.\n\nAge distribution > Total dependency ratio: Percentage of dependant persons out of total population aged 15-64. A dependant person is a person aged 0-14 and those over 65 years old.\n\nBirth rate: The average annual number of births during a year per 1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both the level of fertility and the age structure of the population.\n\nDeath rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The death rate, while only a rough indicator of the mortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current mortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly affected by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show a rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in mortality at all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging population.\n\nEthnic groups: This entry provides a rank ordering of ethnic groups starting with the largest and normally includes the percent of total population.\n\nGender > Female population: Total female population.\n\nMother's mean age at first birth: This entry provides the mean (average) age of mothers at the birth of their first child. It is a useful indicator for gauging the success of family planning programs aiming to reduce maternal mortality, increase contraceptive use â€“ particularly among married and unmarried adolescents, delay age at first marriage, and improve the health of newborns.\n\nPopulation: Population, total refers to the total population.\n\nPopulation > Population growth, past and future: Population growth rate (percentage).\n\nPopulation growth: Percentage by which country's population either has increased or is estimated to increase. Countries with a decrease in population are signified by a negative percentage. Future estimates are from the UN Population Division.\n\nPopulation growth rate: The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative. The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.\n\nSTAT AMOUNT DATE RANK HISTORY Age distribution > Median age 34.61 years 2100 182nd out of 196 Age distribution > Population aged 0-14 21.74% 2100 13th out of 196 Age distribution > Population aged 0-14 > Total 16.37 million 2100 28th out of 196 Age distribution > Population aged 15-24 > Percent 14.55% 2100 15th out of 196 Age distribution > Population aged 15-24 > Total 10.95 million 2100 28th out of 196 Age distribution > Total dependency ratio 53.34% 2100 178th out of 196 Birth rate 42.81 births/1,000 population 2013 4th out of 223 Death rate 12.21 deaths/1,000 population 2013 27th out of 223 Ethnic groups Mossi over 40%, other approximately 60% (includes Gurunsi, Senufo, Lobi, Bobo, Mande, and Fulani) 2013 Gender > Female population 37.61 million 2100 34th out of 196 Mother's mean age at first birth 19.4 2013 36th out of 40 Population 17.81 million 2013 60th out of 251 Population > Population growth, past and future 0.679 2100 13th out of 227 Population growth 0.679% 2100 13th out of 227 Population growth rate 3.06% 2013 8th out of 231\n\nSOURCES: United Nations Population Division.
