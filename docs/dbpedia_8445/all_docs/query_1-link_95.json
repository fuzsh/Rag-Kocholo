Through ingegrating cencus, survey, satellite and GIS datasets in a flexible machine-learning framework, high resolution maps of population counts and densities for 2000-2020 are produced, along with accompanying metadata.\n\nDATASET: Alpha version 2010 and 2015 estimates of numbers of people per grid square, with national totals adjusted to match UN population division estimates (http://esa.un.org/wpp/) and remaining unadjusted.\n\nREGION: Africa\n\nSPATIAL RESOLUTION: 0.000833333 decimal degrees (approx 100m at the equator)\n\nPROJECTION: Geographic, WGS84\n\nUNITS: Estimated persons per grid square\n\nMAPPING APPROACH: Land cover based, as described in: Linard, C., Gilbert, M., Snow, R.W., Noor, A.M. and Tatem, A.J., 2012, Population distribution, settlement patterns and accessibility across Africa in 2010, PLoS ONE, 7(2): e31743.\n\nFORMAT: Geotiff (zipped using 7-zip (open access tool): www.7-zip.org)\n\nFILENAMES: Example - AGO10adjv4.tif = Angola (AGO) population count map for 2010 (10) adjusted to match UN national estimates (adj), version 4 (v4). Population maps are updated to new versions when improved census or other input data become available."
