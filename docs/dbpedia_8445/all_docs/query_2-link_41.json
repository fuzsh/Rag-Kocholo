        "text": "Factors that Affect Life Expectancy\n\nJust like any other region or country, Burkina Faso's life expectancy is influenced by a variety of factors, that include both individual and population-level factors. Broadly speaking, life expectancy is most affected by fertility rate, deaths, immigration and emigration. Some of the individual and population-level factors listed below can get you a better insight into its causes and affects of life expectancy.\n\nHealthcare and Medical Advances\n\nAccess to quality healthcare, advancements in medical technology, and improvements in disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment play a significant role in increasing life expectancy. This includes vaccinations, antibiotics, surgical procedures, and the management of chronic conditions can greatly increase life expectancy of a country or region.\n\nSocioeconomic Status\n\nIncome, education, and occupation are strongly correlated with life expectancy. Higher socioeconomic status typically provides individuals with better access to healthcare, healthier living conditions, and improved overall well-being, contributing to longer life expectancy of a country or region.\n\nEnvironmental Factors\n\nEnvironmental conditions can impact life expectancy. Access to clean air, water, and sanitation, as well as exposure to environmental pollutants and hazardous substances, can affect health outcomes and life expectancy.\n\nSocial Support and Relationships\n\nStrong social connections, supportive relationships, and community engagement has also been linked to improved health outcomes and increased life expectancy. Social isolation and loneliness, on the other hand, can have negative effects on health and decrease life expectancy.\n\nAccess to and Quiality of Education\n\nEducation is associated with better health outcomes and increased life expectancy. It promotes healthier behaviors, improves health literacy, and provides individuals with opportunities for better employment and income.\n\nPublic Health Measures\n\nEffective public health measures, such as disease surveillance, prevention programs, and health education campaigns, can have a significant impact on life expectancy by reducing the incidence and impact of infectious diseases, promoting healthy behaviors, and improving overall population health.\n\nImmigration and Emigration\n\nLife expectancy of a region or country is also affected by immigration of emigration. If healthier people immigrate or emigrate from a country, the life expectancy numbers of those two regions will be influenced by the movement of said people.\n\nCauses of Positive Life Expectancy in Burkina Faso\n\nCauses of Negative Life Expectancy in Burkina Faso"
