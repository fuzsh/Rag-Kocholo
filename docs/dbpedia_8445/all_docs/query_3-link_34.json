        "text": "What the World Food Programme is doing in Burkina Faso\n\nCrisis response\n\nWFP provides emergency food and nutrition assistance to crisis-affected women, men and young children. Emergency response activities include general food distributions to acutely food-insecure people (including internally displaced persons, refugees and host communities).\n\nSchool meals\n\nAs part of its school-based programmes, WFP provides on-site nutritious breakfasts and lunches to children in 1,000 schools, including those with large numbers of internally displaced children. Monthly, family take-home rations are provided to schoolgirls attending the last two years of their primary education, who reach the required attendance during the month. WFP also assists schools in transitioning to a home-grown school feeding model, where canteens are supplied with locally grown, nutritious and diversified food produced by smallholder farmers.\n\nNutrition\n\nWFP implements nutrition programmes to address wasting (low weight for height), stunting (impaired development due to malnutrition) and micronutrient deficiencies. This includes specialized nutritious food to prevent and treat malnutrition among children aged 6-59 months, as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women and girls. WFP also promotes good nutrition and hygiene practices and supports mothers' groups in raising awareness about appropriate infant and young child feeding practices. Additionally, WFP aims to increase the availability and affordability of nutritious foods by supporting the local production of fortified infant flour.\n\nResilience building\n\nWFP builds the resilience of vulnerable households and communities to better withstand shocks and stressors, such as the impact of the climate crisis. These initiatives involve people restoring degraded land, developing lowland for rice production, producing organic fertilizers and building reservoirs for irrigation and boreholes to extract groundwater. The assets created and restored contribute to reducing community tensions over natural resources, thereby fostering social cohesion. WFP assists smallholder farmers by providing training, agricultural inputs, tools and equipment to improve agricultural productivity, reduce post-harvest losses, address crop contamination, and facilitate access to markets and climate insurance.\n\nCapacity strengthening\n\nWFP has been strengthening the capacities of national institutions, particularly the National Council for Emergency Relief and Rehabilitation (CONASUR) and the National Food Security Stock Management Company (SONAGESS). This includes increasing storage capacities, providing laboratory equipment and conducting training on logistics, food handling, storage, pest control, food safety and quality assurance. Additionally, WFP provides technical support to the country’s social protection system, including the national social protection strategy, the national social protection programme, and the expansion of the single social registry.\n\nCommon services\n\nWFP plays a crucial role in the broader humanitarian response through the WFP-managed United Nations Humanitarian Air Service, as well as the WFP-led Logistics Cluster and Information Technology Common Service sector.\n\nIn focus\n\nAs thousands flee Sahel conflicts, a UN plan strengthens resilience in host countries\n\nStory\n\nAs Niger’s men emigrate, women work to outwit a changing climate\n\nStory\n\nFor Burkina Faso’s cut-off communities, WFP food airlifts can be lifesavers\n\nStory\n\nHunger and malnutrition surging across West and Central Africa, says report\n\nStory\n\nFighting hunger, building peace: How farmers are sowing the seeds of change in Burkina Faso\n\nStory\n\nHunger grows as Sahel crisis spills into coastal West Africa\n\nStory\n\nBurkina Faso news releases\n\nGo to page"
