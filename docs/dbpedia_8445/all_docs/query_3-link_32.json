Looking at the population pyramids of Burkina Faso, not much change to age structure is anticipated until between 2030 and 2050.\n\nThe broad bases of the pyramids “Burkina Faso 1970”, “Burkina Faso 1990”, “Burkina Faso 2010”, represent a large number of children in relation to the working age population. The shape of these pyramids is also characteristic of a population with high mortality. Indeed, total fertility in Burkina Faso has remained high over the last four decades. Fertility actually slightly rose from 1970 when the average woman had 6.7 children over the course of her life to 6.9 children per woman in 1990. By 2010, total fertility rates dropped mildly to 6.1 children per woman and was 5.3 children per woman in 2019. “Burkina Faso 2030” is the United Nations projection of Burkina Faso population age structure if fertility declines at a moderate rate. This pyramid assumes that by 2030, fertility will decline to an average of 4.5 children per woman over the course of her lifetime, which will require significant commitment on the part of the government of Burkina Faso and civil society. In “Burkina Faso 2050,” projections show the base of the population pyramid narrowing, representing a lower fertility rate estimated at 3.3 children per woman and the age structure of the population beginning to change.\n\nWorking Towards a Demographic Dividend in Burkina Faso\n\nIf Burkina Faso makes substantial investments in reproductive health, family planning, and girls’ education, a fertility decline will likely occur, and children will be more likely to achieve better basic levels of health. With additional investments in health and education and economic initiatives to facilitate job creation, Burkina Faso may be able to experience the rapid economic growth known as a demographic dividend.\n\nHowever, this will need substantial efforts and investment because the population of Burkina Faso between 0-14 years of age will remain close to half of the population for the next few decades.\n\nPopulation Reference Bureau, 2019 World Population Data Sheet, (Washington, DC: Population Reference Bureau, 2019).\n\nUnited Nations Population Division, World Population Prospects: The 2019 Revision, (New York: United Nations, 2019).\n\nWorld Bank Group.

Thus, a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.\n\nDependency ratio is the ratio of dependents–people younger than 15 or older than 64-to the working-age population–those ages 15 to 64. Although each country’s experience is different, countries that have realized a demographic dividend typically have a dependency ratio of less than 50 dependents for every 100 working-age adults.\n\nWorldwide Governance Indicators are measured on a scale from -2.5 to +2.5. The closer to 2.5 the rating is, the stronger the governance. Government Effectiveness is a composite governance indicator with data from multiple sources. Political stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism is a composite governance indicator with data from multiple sources More information on methodology available at: http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/index.aspx#home\n\nGlobal Competitiveness Index defines competitiveness as the set of institutions, policies and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country. The level of productivity, in turn, sets the level of prosperity that can be earned by an economy. The different aspects of competitiveness are captured in 12 pillars, ranging from institutional strength to market size. http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015/"
