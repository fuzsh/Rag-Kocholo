Now, it is home to one of the fastest growing displacement crises in the world: over 1 million people have had to flee their homes.\n\nThe escalating conflict is driving steep increases in humanitarian need and - with the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis - the risk of famine. 1.6 million are facing crisis or worse levels of food insecurity.\n\nNearly 300 local health centres are closed or are restricting services due to the conflict, limiting the health care that 1.1 million people can obtain.\n\nAttacks on schools have forced children out of classrooms. As many as 350,000 students have been affected by closures of schools."
