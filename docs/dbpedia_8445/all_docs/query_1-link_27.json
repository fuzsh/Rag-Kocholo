        "text": "Population of Western Africa (2024 and historical)\n\nWestern Africa Population Forecast\n\nNotes\n\nThe Western Africa Population (Live) counter shows a continuously updated estimate of the current population of Western Africa delivered by Worldometer's RTS algorithm, which processes data collected from the United Nations Population Division.\n\nThe Population of Western Africa (1950 - 2024) chart plots the total population count as of July 1 of each year, from 1950 to 2024.\n\nThe Yearly Population Growth Rate chart plots the annual percentage changes in population registered on July 1 of each year, from 1951 to 2024. This value can differ from the Yearly % Change shown in the historical table, which shows the last year equivalent percentage change assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period.\n\nDefinitions\n\nYear: as of July 1 of the year indicated.\n\nPopulation: Overall total population (both sexes and all ages) in the sub-region as of July 1 of the year indicated, as estimated by the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division.World Population Prospects: The 2024 Revision. For forecasted years, the U.N. medium-fertility variant is used.\n\nYearly % Change: For 2024: percentage change in total population over the last year (from July 1, 2023 to June 30 2024). For all other years: latest year annual percentage change equivalent assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period, calculated through reverse compounding.\n\nYearly Change: For 2024: absolute change in total population (increase or decrease in number of people) over the last year (from July 1, 2023 to June 30 2024). For all other years: average annual numerical change over the preceding five year period.\n\nMigrants (net): The average annual number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants over the preceding five year period (running from July 1 to June 30 of the initial and final years), or subsequent five year period. A negative number means that there are more emigrants than immigrants.\n\nMedian Age: age that divides the population into two numerically equal groups: half of the people are older than the median age indicated and half are younger. This parameter provides an indication of age distribution.\n\nFertility Rate: (Total Fertility Rate, or TFR), it is expressed as children per woman. It is calculated as the average number of children an average woman will have during her reproductive period (15 to 49 years old) based on the current fertility rates of every age group in the countries within Western Africa, and assuming she is not subject to mortality.\n\nDensity (P/Km²): (Population Density) Population per square Kilometer (Km²).\n\nUrban Pop % : Urban population as a percentage of total population.\n\nUrban Population: Population living in areas classified as urban according to the criteria used by each country.\n\nWestern Africa's Share of World Pop: Total population as a percentage of total World Population as of July 1 of the year indicated.\n\nWorld Population: Total World Population as of July 1 of the year indicated.\n\nRank within Africa: Position held by Western Africa in the list of all regions within Africa ranked by population (from the highest population to the lowest population) as of July 1 of the year indicated.\n\nSee also"
