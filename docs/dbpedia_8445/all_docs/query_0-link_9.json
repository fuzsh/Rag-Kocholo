Burkina Faso shares its land boundary with six neighboring countries namely Niger in the east, Mali in the north, Togo and Ghana in the south, Benin in the southeast, and Ivory Coast in the southwest. Burkina Faso covers a total area of 274,200 sq. km. and is situated between 9° and 15°N latitudes and 6°W and 3°E longitudes.
