        "text": "Located in Africa's Sahel region, Burkina Faso is currently grappling with one of the world’s fastest growing displacement crises. Notably, it holds the fourth position on the IRC's 2024 Watchlist, an analysis identifying countries most susceptible to a deteriorating humanitarian situation in 2024.\n\nThe central government’s “Security-First” approach prioritizes reclaiming territory controlled by nonstate armed groups, taking precedence over funding other state functions. Consequently, basic health and education services suffer from inadequate funding while 40% of the population live under the poverty line.\n\nMali, Burkina Faso and Niger announced their withdrawal from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on 28 January 2024, adding uncertainties to the political landscape.\n\nThe IRC is on the ground in Burkina Faso delivering a wide range of critical support including health, nutrition, safety, education, economic recovery and power services.\n\nRead on to learn what is happening in Burkina Faso.\n\nArmed groups have besieged towns, affecting one million people\n\nFollowing a 2022 coup, Burkina Faso's current central government controls roughly half of the nation's territory. The other half is controlled by armed groups that are increasingly blockading cities and towns, including major population centers that lie outside Burkina Faso’s capital, Ouagadougou.\n\nThese sieges have affected over one million people across 46 locations and are continuing to spread across the countries. The blockades severely disrupt access to critical services and have curtailed trade and farming, destroying livelihoods. In some towns, the lack of new supplies over several months has led to alarming levels of food insecurity.\n\nCivilians at risk as violence spreads\n\nHumanitarian needs are on the rise with no end in sight to the violence that has left more than 2 million people internally displaced across Burkina Faso. In just the first 18 months since Burkina Faso’s coup in January 2022, the number of killings by nonstate armed groups has tripled.\n\nCivilians are becoming increasingly entangled in the escalating violence involving nonstate armed groups, the government and self-defense militias aligned with the government. These militias, known as VDPs, have faced accusations of grave human rights violations. They’re alleged to have killed at least 150 civilians in Yatenga province in April 2023, in one of the deadliest incidents since the conflict began in 2015.\n\nMillions in Burkina Faso continue to endure the grim reality of severe violence and displacement on a daily basis.\n\nPoor harvests set to exacerbate food insecurity and poverty\n\nOver 40% of people in Burkina Faso live below the poverty line. The escalation of conflicts, rising insecurity and increasing climate vulnerability are significantly affecting the limited economic prospects that still exist.\n\nWeak rainfall throughout 2023 will limit crop yields and the amount of pasture available for livestock, reducing food supplies in 2024. Meanwhile, insecurity threatens to disrupt the markets and food production that remain. Amidst rising demand, tensions may heighten over scarce resources like grazing lands, potentially leading to localized violence.\n\nPublic services, including education and health sectors, are overwhelmed\n\nBurkina Faso’s government continues to divert public spending towards defense, leaving public spending unable to meet the country's growing poverty and humanitarian needs. This situation has particularly impacted the education and health sectors.\n\nAt least 6,000 schools, — approximately 1 in 4 — have closed, adversely affecting the education and protection of one million students who no longer attend school. Meanwhile, a major dengue outbreak is set to strain Burkina Faso’s healthcare system, which is already on the verge of collapse. Over 370 healthcare facilities are at risk of closure due to the conflict and disruptions in aid deliveries, significantly impacting healthcare services to 3.5 million individuals.\n\nAccess to humanitarian aid is severely restricted\n\nDespite the immense needs, humanitarian action in Burkina Faso encounters substantial challenges. Burkina Faso’s 2023 humanitarian response plan received just 36.8% of its necessary funding.\n\nAid workers face several barriers related to the growing conflict, which has led ACAPS to rate humanitarian access constraints as “Extreme” (5 of 5). The killing of two aid workers in February 2023 led to the suspension of some humanitarian operations in the country and underscores the growing threat to humanitarians in Burkina Faso.\n\nHow is the IRC responding to the crisis in Burkina Faso?\n\nSince 2019, the IRC has been actively assisting civilians in Burkina Faso, focusing on providing aid to internally displaced individuals affected by the country's security situation. Our efforts aim to support and alleviate the challenges faced by those affected by the ongoing crisis.\n\nThe IRC provides lifesaving interventions and emergency assistance in health, nutrition, safety, education, economic recovery and power. This provision is accomplished by placing a dedicated emphasis on collaborating with local partners, particularly women-led organizations.\n\nLearn more about the IRC’s response in Burkina Faso.\n\nHow can I support the people of Burkina Faso?\n\nDonate now to support the IRC's life-changing work in Burkina Faso and worldwide. We are on the frontlines providing critical aid to crisis-affected people in more than 50 countries, including places on the 2024 Emergency Watchlist."
