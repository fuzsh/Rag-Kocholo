        "text": "Help Children in Burkina Faso\n\nBurkina Faso, which means “land of honest men,” is a small, very poor, landlocked country in Western Africa, home to over 20 million people. A former French colony, it gained independence as Upper Volta in 1960.\n\nYears of political instability led to the crumbling of a 27-year regime in 2014. Since then, the country has suffered recurrent attacks, including on schools, by armed groups. As the security situation deteriorates, some 900,000 people have become internally displaced. Burkina Faso also faces challenges in infant mortality, malnutrition, education, employment, food security and limited natural resources.\n\nIn Burkina Faso, over 2.2 million people are now in need of humanitarian assistance, almost half of them children.\n\nOur Work for Children in Burkina Faso\n\nResponding to the great drought of the 1970s, Save the Children’s teams began working Burkina Faso in 1982.\n\nToday, Save the Children is a leading charity for children in Burkina Faso, with programs in child health, education and protection. These programs focus on improving maternal and child health, addressing malnutrition and food insecurity, promoting school enrollment, particularly for girls, ending child marriage and keeping children safe, as well as raising awareness of children’s rights.\n\nWe work closely with government ministries and other partners to assess children’s needs and successfully address them. Save the Children also helps families and communities make pivotal decisions about village health, school management and economic opportunities that positively affect the quality of life for themselves and their children.\n\nHere are some recent examples of our work:\n\nA healthy start in life\n\nWe’re advocating for universal access to health care and an increase in the health budget\n\nTo combat malnutrition, we’re screening, treating and providing long-term care for affected children and their families\n\nWe’re implementing food assistance programs to address undernutrition and chronic food insecurity, including promoting healthy infant feeding, healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies and improving water, sanitation and hygiene practices\n\nWe’re supporting parents’ ability to care and provide for their children through cash transfer, livelihoods and budget management projects\n\nWe’re partnering with Burkina Faso’s ministry of health on the quality and effectiveness of health care\n\nThe opportunity to learn\n\nEducation is a cornerstone of our work in the country, including opening literacy centers to boost children’s school success and working with teachers to ensure quality learning environments\n\nWe’re also supporting alternative, non-formal education in places where schools are closed, as well as for internally displaced people through our Youth In Action program for vulnerable youth, including literacy, financial literacy and related life skills development\n\nThrough our Model Husband School approach, we successfully used community approaches to address gender norms, especially with adolescents, and promote male engagement\n\nProtection from harm\n\nWith 42% of children engaged in the workforce, we’re creating apprenticeships through our Youth in Action program to steer children away from dangerous jobs\n\nWe’re implementing child protection programs involving parents to create a greater common understanding of existing child protection issues\n\nWe’re working with communities to prevent, identify, address and refer child protection cases\n\nWe’re actively promoting the use of positive parenting approaches for caregivers\n\nWe’re working to strengthen regional civil society organizations and empower youth networks to expand young people’s options and end child marriage"
