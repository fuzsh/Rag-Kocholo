        "text": "This page contains all the latest data, insights, and trends you need to help you understand how people in Burkina Faso use digital devices and services in 2024.\n\nIf you want to check whether this is our most up-to-date report for Burkina Faso, or if you’re looking for data on digital trends and behaviours in Burkina Faso for previous years, you can find DataReportal’s full collection of reports on Burkina Faso by clicking here.\n\nYou’ll also find the complete Digital 2024 report for Burkina Faso in the “full report” section below, but we’ll start by taking a look at the essential headline numbers for Burkina Faso this year.\n\nJust before that, we’d like to thank We Are Social and Meltwater for making the 2024 Global Digital Reports series possible.\n\nOK, let’s get into the data…\n\nThe state of digital in Burkina Faso in 2024\n\nHere are DataReportal’s essential headlines for digital adoption and use in Burkina Faso in early 2024:\n\nThere were 4.69 million internet users in Burkina Faso at the start of 2024, when internet penetration stood at 19.9 percent.\n\nBurkina Faso was home to 2.85 million social media users in January 2024, equating to 12.1 percent of the total population.\n\nA total of 27.10 million cellular mobile connections were active in Burkina Faso in early 2024, with this figure equivalent to 115.1 percent of the total population.\n\nThese headline stats offer a great overview of the “state of digital” in Burkina Faso, but in order to make sense of how digital trends and behaviours are evolving, we need to dig deeper into the data.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at what the latest numbers tell us, starting with some valuable context relating to the population of Burkina Faso.\n\nPopulation of Burkina Faso in 2024\n\nThe population of Burkina Faso stood at 23.54 million in January 2024.\n\nData shows that Burkina Faso’s population increased by 584 thousand (+2.5 percent) between early 2023 and the start of 2024.\n\n50.2 percent of Burkina Faso’s population is female, while 49.8 percent of the population is male.\n\nAt the start of 2024, 32.8 percent of Burkina Faso’s population lived in urban centres, while 67.2 percent lived in rural areas.\n\nNote: gender data are currently only available for “female” and “male”.\n\nBurkina Faso’s population by age\n\nThe median age of Burkina Faso’s population is 17.0.\n\nHere’s how Burkina Faso’s total population breaks down by age group:\n\n15.6 percent is between the ages of 0 and 4.\n\n22.4 percent is between the ages of 5 and 12.\n\n12.0 percent is between the ages of 13 and 17.\n\n13.3 percent is between the ages of 18 and 24.\n\n14.0 percent is between the ages of 25 and 34.\n\n10.1 percent is between the ages of 35 and 44.\n\n6.2 percent is between the ages of 45 and 54.\n\n3.7 percent is between the ages of 55 and 64.\n\n2.5 percent is aged 65 and above.\n\nNote: percentages may not sum to 100 percent due to rounding.\n\nInternet use in Burkina Faso in 2024\n\nThere were 4.69 million internet users in Burkina Faso in January 2024.\n\nBurkina Faso’s internet penetration rate stood at 19.9 percent of the total population at the start of 2024.\n\nKepios analysis indicates that internet users in Burkina Faso increased by 116 thousand (+2.5 percent) between January 2023 and January 2024.\n\nFor perspective, these user figures reveal that 18.85 million people in Burkina Faso did not use the internet at the start of 2024, suggesting that 80.1 percent of the population remained offline at the beginning of the year.\n\nHowever, complexities associated with the collection and analysis of internet user data mean that it can often take several months before research is ready for publication. As a result, the latest published figures for internet use invariably under-represent reality, and actual adoption and growth may be higher than the figures shown here suggest. Please see our comprehensive notes on data for further details.\n\nDig deeper: for the latest insights into internet adoption and use around the world, follow our regular Global Statshot reports.\n\nGo global: see how Burkina Faso’s current “state of digital” compares with connectivity in other countries by reading our flagship Digital 2024 Global Overview Report, which includes hundreds of slides of global digital data, and our in-depth analysis of what these numbers might mean for you.\n\nInternet connection speeds in Burkina Faso in 2024\n\nData published by Ookla indicate that internet users in Burkina Faso could have expected the following internet connection speeds at the start of 2024:\n\nMedian fixed internet connection speed: 42.46 Mbps.\n\nOokla’s data shows that fixed internet connection speeds in Burkina Faso decreased by 2.36 Mbps (-5.3 percent) in the twelve months to the start of 2024.\n\nSocial media statistics for Burkina Faso in 2024\n\nDataReportal’s figures show that there were 2.85 million active social media user identities in Burkina Faso in January 2024.\n\nNote: over the past year, we’ve made some important changes to how we calculate social media user numbers, and the data sources that we use to inform these calculations have also made significant and wide-ranging revisions to their published figures during that period.\n\nAs a result, our latest figure for social media use might appear to be quite different to the values that we published in previous years.\n\nBecause of this, we advise caution when comparing the social media user values published in this year’s reports with those published in previous years, especially because changes in reported values may be the result of “corrections” in the source data, as well as changes in actual user behaviour.\n\nFor clarity, Kepios analysis shows that social media users in Burkina Faso increased by 900 thousand (+46.2 percent) between early 2023 and the beginning of 2024.\n\nThe number of social media users in Burkina Faso at the start of 2024 was equivalent to 12.1 percent of the total population, but it’s important to stress that social media users may not represent unique individuals (see our detailed notes on data to learn why).\n\nMeanwhile, data published in the ad planning tools of top social media platforms indicates that there were 2.85 million users aged 18 and above using social media in Burkina Faso at the start of 2024, which was equivalent to 24.3 percent of the total population aged 18 and above at that time.\n\nMore broadly, 60.8 percent of Burkina Faso’s total internet user base (regardless of age) used at least one social media platform in January 2024.\n\nAt that time, 30.4 percent of Burkina Faso’s social media users were female, while 69.6 percent were male.\n\nNote: gender data are currently only available for “female” and “male”.\n\nGet fresh insights: our handy social media overview page helps you stay up to date with global social media trends, offering essential headlines for social media adoption, as well as the latest user figures for the world’s most widely used social media platforms.\n\nFacebook users in Burkina Faso in 2024\n\nData published in Meta’s advertising resources indicates that Facebook had 2.85 million users in Burkina Faso in early 2024.\n\nHowever, Meta has made important changes to the way its advertising resources report audience reach data over recent months – including making significant revisions to its base audience data for Facebook – so the figures shown here may not be directly comparable with figures published in our previous reports.\n\nTo learn more about these changes, please see this article, as well as our comprehensive notes on data.\n\nFacebook user growth in Burkina Faso\n\nFigures published in Meta’s own tools indicate that Facebook’s potential ad reach in Burkina Faso increased by 900 thousand (+46.2 percent) between January 2023 and January 2024.\n\nFor more recent context, the same data show that the number of users that marketers could reach with ads on Facebook in Burkina Faso decreased by 100 thousand (-3.4 percent) between October 2023 and January 2024.\n\nHowever, it’s important to stress that these advertising reach figures are not the same as the monthly active users figures that Meta reports in its investor earnings announcements, and they should not be interpreted as such.\n\nAs the company states within its ad planning tools,\n\n“Estimated audience size is not a proxy for monthly or daily active users, or for engagement. Estimates aren’t designed to match population, census estimates or other sources, and may differ depending on factors such as how many accounts across Meta technologies a person has, how many temporary visitors are in a particular geographic location at a given time, and Meta user-reported demographics.”\n\nAs a result, changes in ad reach may not necessarily indicate any change in the platform’s overall user base.\n\nBut despite these caveats, Meta’s ad reach data still offers valuable insights into how Facebook use is evolving.\n\nFacebook adoption in Burkina Faso\n\nFacebook’s ad reach in Burkina Faso was equivalent to 12.1 percent of the total population at the start of 2024.\n\nHowever, Meta only allows people aged 13 and above to use Facebook, so it’s worth highlighting that 19.5 percent of the “eligible” audience in Burkina Faso uses Meta in 2024.\n\nFor additional context, Facebook’s ad reach in Burkina Faso was equivalent to 60.8 percent of the local internet user base (regardless of age) in January 2024.\n\nAt the start of 2024, 30.4 percent of Facebook’s ad audience in Burkina Faso was female, while 69.6 percent was male.\n\nNote: Meta’s advertising resources only publish audience gender data for “female” and “male” users.\n\n▶ Looking for more Facebook stats?

Click here to explore our in-depth Instagram data for every country in the world.\n\nFacebook Messenger users in Burkina Faso in 2024\n\nData published in Meta’s advertising resources indicate that ads on Facebook Messenger reached 322.9 thousand users in Burkina Faso in early 2024.\n\nThe company’s frequently revised audience numbers suggest that Facebook Messenger’s ad reach in Burkina Faso was equivalent to 1.4 percent of the total population at the start of the year.\n\nMeta only allows people aged 13 and above to use Facebook Messenger though, so it’s worth highlighting that 2.2 percent of Facebook Messenger’s “eligible” audience in Burkina Faso in 2024.\n\nFor additional context, Facebook Messenger’s ad reach in Burkina Faso is equivalent to 6.9 percent of the local internet user base (regardless of age).\n\nAt the start of 2024, 28.0 percent of Facebook Messenger’s ad audience in Burkina Faso was female, while 72.0 percent was male.\n\nNotes: Meta’s advertising resources only publish audience gender data for “female” and “male” users.\n\nFacebook Messenger user growth in Burkina Faso\n\nData published in Meta’s planning tools show that Facebook Messenger’s potential ad reach in Burkina Faso increased by 100 thousand (+44.6 percent) between January 2023 and January 2024.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, the company’s data reveal that the size of Facebook Messenger’s ad audience in Burkina Faso increased by 6,100 (+1.9 percent) between October 2023 and January 2024.\n\nHowever, as we noted in the Facebook section above, changes in the audience reach figures published in Meta’s ad planning tools do not necessarily correlate with overall changes in its platforms’ active user bases.\n\n▶ Looking for more Facebook Messenger stats?
