        "text": "King Felipe of Spain put on a united front with his wife, Queen Letizia, as the pair stepped out with their teen daughters for a joint royal engagement.\n\nThe pair’s official outing comes just weeks after a prominent royal author claimed the monarch was “crushed and destroyed” over his wife’s alleged infidelity with her ex-brother-in-law Jaime del Burgo.\n\nThe pair, who have been married since 2004, appeared in good spirits alongside their daughters Princess Leonor and Infanta Sofia in Barcelona earlier this week.\n\nThe family attended a meeting with winners of the esteemed Princess of Girona Foundation Awards in honor of the organization’s 15th anniversary.\n\nThe event, held at the swanky 5-star Melia Lloret de Mar Hotel, saw Letizia stun in an elegant cream dress that featured a split and unique neckline.\n\nShe topped off her classy look with a pair of white heels and a matching handbag.\n\nFelipe, for his part, looked dapper in a cream blazer atop a blue shirt and a pair of navy pants.\n\nBoth Princess Leonor, 18, and Infanta Sofia of Spain, 17, opted for a summery look for the outing, consisting of flowy white shirts paired with white pants and matching espadrilles.\n\nThe family later made a special visit to renowned artist Jaume Plensa’s studio located in the city.\n\nFelipe and Letizia’s outing comes after they were rocked by a slew of claims by journalist Jaime Peñafiel, who has covered the royals for decades.\n\nIn his book “Letizia’s Silences,” released in May, Peñafiel, 91, claimed the king of Spain was “aware that Letizia was cheating on him in real time” as her bodyguards must report on her whereabouts.\n\nThe royal author alleges that bodyguards joined the queen on a trip to New York back in 2011, during which she was accompanied by her rumored “lover” del Burgo.\n\nLetizia, 51, reportedly dated del Burgo before meeting King Felipe in 2002.\n\nPeñafie alleged that Letizia and King Felipe had a rocky relationship in the years before the alleged affair began.\n\nLetizia would “test” her husband’s feelings for her by frequently traveling to Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica during the early stages of their relationship, Peñafiel wrote in his book, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nDel Burgo — who was married to Letizia’s sister from 2012 to 2014 — has since claimed that he is still in touch with the Queen in an interview with Argentinian newspaper Clarín.\n\n“We have shared many years of our lives together,” he told the outlet. “We have been a family. As I have always said, ours was not a relationship of lovers. The lover would be him, in any case. I mean Felipe.”"
