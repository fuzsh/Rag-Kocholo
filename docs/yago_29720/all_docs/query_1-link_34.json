        "text": "The Wedding of Juan Carlos of Spain\n\nand Sophia of Greece\n\nBy Arturo Beéche\n\nThe skies over Athens were of a deep oceanic blue on May 14, 1962. Only those who have been lucky enough to visit this wonderful country can recall the beauty of the blue seas surrounding this beautiful country. On this happy date, two descendants of Queen Victoria were joining their lives in matrimony. Such was the commotion created by the impending wedding that many chroniclers of the time called it the most important royal marriage of the century. What is certain is that the two extremes of the Mediterranean Sea were brought closer by the marriage between Prince Juan Carlos of Spain and Princess Sophia of Greece.\n\nJuan Carlos and Sophia are related several times. Juan Carlos is a grandson of Queen Victoria-Eugenia of Spain, born a Princess of Battenberg. Victoria-Eugenia was the only daughter of Prince Henry of Battenberg and Princess Beatrice of Great Britain. Beatrice was Queen Victoria's youngest child. Victoria-Eugenia of Battenberg had the distinct honor of being a favorite of Empress Eugenie of the French, Napoleon III's widow. The closeness between the family of Queen Victoria and her friend Empress Eugenie's led to Beatrice naming her daughter in honor of the two older ladies. Some have also rumored that this friendship between Beatrice and Eugenie was the result of the English princess' love for Eugenie's unfortunate son, the Prince Imperial who died in Africa during the Zulu Wars in 1879.\n\nSophia is a descendant of Queen Victoria through both her parents. King Paul I of the Hellenes was the youngest son of King Constantine I and Queen Sophie, born a Princess of Prussia. Sophie was the third daughter of Kaiser Friedrich III and Kaiserin Victoria, who was Queen Victoria's eldest child. Sophia's mother, Frederica of Hanover, was the only daughter of Duke Ernst-August of Brunswick and Princess Victoria-Luise of Prussia, Kaiser Wilhelm II's only daughter. Wilhelm II and Queen Sophie of Greece were siblings, both being children of Kaiser Friedrich III and Kaiserin Victoria. Duke Ernst-August was closely related to the English royal family, as the head of the old Hanoverian royal family. Ernst-August was the grandson of King George V of Hanover, only son of King Ernst-August of Hanover and Duke of Cumberland. Ernst-August was the younger brother of Edward, Duke of Kent, Queen Victoria's father.\n\nMany years had passed since Athens witnessed a royal celebration of this magnitude. More than 150 members of Europe's royal families were invited to the wedding of the eldest daughter of the King of Greece and the future King of Spain. Among them were members of the royal houses of Greece, Spain, Great Britain, Bavaria, Parma, Brazil, Denmark, France, Hanover, Baden, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Bulgaria, Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Sweden, Württemberg and Yugoslavia. Europe had not seen such a large gathering of royalty since the days prior to the great war in 1914.\n\nThe city's streets were gaily decorated. The flags of Greece and Spain seemed to be everywhere, hanging from balconies, along the streets, in ever single light post. The route from the royal palace to the church was lined by well-wishers who had stood in place for hours to have a good view of the marvelous royal pageantry. Several Athenians made a handsome profit by renting their balconies to the highest bidder. Not one person in the city seemed willing to avoid being a witness to this most joyous occasion. It had been almost a quarter of a century since a Greek royal had married and Athens, Greece for that matter, made sure Europe witnessed the high regard in which Princess Sophia was held.\n\nThousands of Spaniards traveled to Athens to participate in this historic event. Juan Carlos and Sophia recognized their efforts by hosting a large garden party at the Hellenic Tennis Club. The contagious enthusiasm demonstrated by Juan Carlos' future subjects was appreciated by both royal families.\n\nAt eight in the morning of May 14, five cannon blasts announced the beginning of the day's festivities. Dignitaries were the first to arrive at the Church of Saint Dyonisius, among them Prime Minister Karamanlis and Spain's Ambassador Extraordinary, Minister of the Navy Abárzuza. Following closely were the over 150 royal guests of King Paul and Queen Frederica, amid the most renowned were: King Olav V of Norway, Franz-Josef II of Liechtenstein, King Umberto II of Italy, Queen Juliana of The Netherlands, Queen Ingrid of Denmark, Grand Duke Jean of Luxemburg, Michael I of Romania, Rainier III of Monaco and Queen Victoria-Eugenia of Spain. Other royal guests of note were the Count and Countess of Paris, Henri and Isabelle; Philip I of Württemberg; Tomislav of Yugoslavia; Duarte II of Braganza; Friedrich-Franz V of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; Kraft of Hohenlohe-Langenburg; Amadeo, Duke of Aosta; Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse; Ernst-August V of Hanover; Luis, Prince Imperial of Brazil; Franz of Bavaria; Berthold I, Markgrave of Baden; Marina, Duchess of Kent; Alfonso, Duke of Calabria; Robert, Duke of Parma; Friedrich of Windisch-Graetz; and Lord Louis Mountbatten, Earl Mountbatten of Burma.\n\nThe royal cortege left the royal palace at 9:20 am. As the motorcade progressed along the beflagged route Athens went wild with ovations and demonstrations of support for the Greek royal family. Heading the royal cortege was the Athenian Chief of Police, followed closely by a limousine carrying Queen Juliana of The Netherlands and King Olav V of Norway. Juliana astonished the gathering royal mob with a diamond parure said to be worth millions. It was a fitting adornment for the richest woman of the world. Following next were Queen Victoria-Eugenia of Spain with Queen Ingrid of Denmark; Bernhard of The Netherlands with Helen, Queen Mother of Romania; Umberto II and Marie-José of Italy; Michael I and Anne of Romania; Franz-Josef and Gina of Liechtenstein. After a short period of quiet enthusiasm, Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco made a triumphant arrival. She looked fabulous and the crowds loved her wildly. The list of arriving royals was completed by Grand Duke Jean and Grand Duchess Josephine-Charlotte of Luxemburg.\n\nOnce the foreign royals were seated inside the church it was the turn for the Spanish and Greek royal families to make their entrance. Four cars transported the maids of honor: Irene of Greece, Irene of The Netherlands, Alexandra of Kent, Benedikte and Anne-Marie of Denmark, Anne of France, Pilar of Spain and Princess Tatiana Radziwill. The best men chosen by the couple were Prince Michael of Greece, the Duke of Aosta, don Alfonso de Bourbon and Infante Alfonso of Orleans.\n\nPreceded by six mounted guards, Queen Frederica and don Juan, Count of Barcelona, arrived at the church. They were followed by Prince Juan Carlos who was accompanied by his mother, the Countess of Barcelona. Escorted by his proud mother, Juan Carlos' entry into the church sent the adoring crowds into boisterous rapture. Once inside the church, the Countess of Barcelona sat next to her husband. Queen Frederica waited patiently for the arrival of her husband, son and daughter. The noisy clamor filling up the church announced the bride's arrival.\n\nOutside, the crowds went simply wild. Seated inside the majestic golden royal coach, Sophia, accompanied by her father and brother Constantine, arrived at Saint Dyonisius. Her bridesmaids waited patiently as the royal bride descended from the carriage. Within minutes they had managed to straighten the bride's long train. Sophia's entrance into the church was tremendously emotional for bride, family, guests and crowd. Greece, royal Europe in fact, had not seen such outpouring of love in many decades. For a moment it seemed as if all worries were thrown to the wind.\n\nSophia was an enchanting sight. Her coiffured head was topped by a beautiful tiara given to her by Queen Frederica. This fantastic jewel kept the fifteen foot long veil in place. It was the same veil used a quarter of a century before by Frederica of Hanover when she married Prince Paul of Greece. Her wedding dress was designed by Jean Dessés, a beautiful creation in lamé with ancient brocade.\n\nThe day's emotions finally got to Sophia by the time she reached the altar. As tears fell down her cheeks, a concerned Juan Carlos gallantly offered her his handkerchief. He held her arm to comfort her and demonstrate his intense care. Everyone present at the church witnessed this demonstrations of love with great satisfaction.\n\nThe Catholic ceremony lasted almost an hour. The doubling of bells announced to the entire city that their princess was no longer so. From that moment forward she would be the future Queen of Spain. Once the nuptials were finished, mass was celebrated. The beautiful notes of Mozart's Coronation Mass, along with Perosi's Magnificat, kept the church filled with joyful melodies. As Haendel's Alleluia filled the church, Juan Carlos and Sophia walked out of the church to be greeted by the rapturous crowds.\n\nThe magnificent carriage pulled by six horses took them to the royal palace where the couple rested for a short while. After the royal palace in downtown Athens, everyone headed to the Orthodox Metropolitan Cathedral of the Virgin Mary. Decorated with 30,000 roses, the Orthodox cathedral was a sight to behold. The crowds were terribly pleased as the entire royal guest list once again made a triumphant entrance.\n\nOnce finished with the Orthodox ceremony, the newlyweds returned to the royal palace. After a brief civil ceremony held inside the royal realm, a fantastic banquet was held in honor of Juan Carlos and Sophia. More than one thousand guests attended the celebration. Photos were taken, anecdotes shared of a day that would forever remain the most impressive royal occasion in Greece's history. Once the banquet was concluded, Juan Carlos and Sophia left for the royal retreat in the island of Corfu. From this Ionic paradise they left for a honeymoon that took them around the world.\n\nThirteen years later, and surrounded by their three young children, Juan Carlos and Sophia ascended to the restored throne of Spain. Juan Carlos and Sophia are the parents of the Infantas Elena and Cristina, and Prince Felipe of the Asturias. Elena and Cristina are married now. And the royal couple await the birth of Elena's first child in August of 1998. Today Juan Carlos and Sophia enjoy the respect and considerable love of their Spanish subjects. They are also held in high regard by politicians and leaders throughout the world. King Juan Carlos' efforts in restoring democracy to his country are not only admired, but also a source of inspiration to many of his exiled Eastern European cousins.\n\nFrom: European Royal History\n\nAn article about the wedding dress of Sofia in spanish.\n\nhttp://www.larazon.es/boda/noti_nac39.htm\n\nUn vestido clásico en lamé plateado\n\n​\n\nJean Dessés confeccionó el traje de novia de Doña Sofía.
