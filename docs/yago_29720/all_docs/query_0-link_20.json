The bride, Princess Sophia, was the daughter of the Greek king; the groom, Infante Juan Carlos, was the son of the Spanish pretender. When the two married on May 14, 1962, few might have guessed that they would go on to reign on a restored Spanish throne for nearly four decades, or that their son would still occupy that throne today. Here’s a look at the jewels worn by Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark—who changed her name to the Spanish spelling, Sofia, when she converted to Catholicism—on her wedding day."
