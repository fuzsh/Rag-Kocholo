        "text": "Juan Carlos was born in Rome in 1938, the eldest son of an exiled heir to the throne in the midst of Spain’s civil war. A year later General Francisco Franco emerged as the victor and installed himself as dictator, quickly dashing the hopes Juan Carlos’s father, Don Juan, had of becoming king. Juan Carlos endured a difficult childhood, moving from Italy to Switzerland and Portugal with his parents, and then to Spain at the age of just 10 to become Franco’s protégé, schooled in the regime’s National Catholic doctrines, and groomed by the dictator to become his loyal successor. When he was 18, Juan Carlos’s brother Alfonso, four years his junior, was accidentally shot and killed while they were messing about with a gun. He has never talked publicly about the guilt he must have felt about the shooting, nor about betraying his father by skipping over him in the line of succession.\n\nWhat is clear is that when Franco died in November 1975, Juan Carlos seized his chance to do something extraordinary, driving forward a delicate transition to democracy. His deeds made him and, by extension, his wife Queen Sofía heroic figures in a young democracy making up for lost time with an Olympic Games in Barcelona and new-found chic it could export in the form of Pedro Almodóvar films and Zara fashion stores.\n\nJuan Carlos won regattas and people’s hearts, deploying a joke here and a folksy turn of phrase there. He also had an eye for beautiful women. After making a documentary about him in 1992, in which he joked that he had ‘probably’ tried to avoid paying taxes, presenter Selina Scott described the Spanish King as ‘tactile’ and noted that Diana, Princess of Wales was also said to have been on the receiving end of his flirtatious character. The Prince and Princess of Wales, along with their sons, used to holiday with the Spanish royals.\n\nThroughout his reign, rumours were rife about his relationships with women other than his wife. But for years the Spanish press maintained a loyal silence, in part out of respect for Sofía. What has kept Sofía going is love for her son Felipe, and personal knowledge of how a royal family can crumble in the face of public hostility – she is from the same royal House of Glücksburg as the Duke of Edinburgh, and her brother was deposed as King of Greece in 1973.\n\n‘She has put up with things that no woman should have to put up with, due to her determination that her son would be king and not to endanger Spain’s monarchy,’ says Mábel Galaz, a veteran royal correspondent for the newspaper El País.\n\nJuan Carlos and Sofía are said to have long lived separate lives in different annexes of the Zarzuela palace, part of the complex outside Madrid where King Felipe and his wife, Queen Letizia, also live. ‘They don’t even see each other at breakfast, only when they have to do an appearance together. For many years they weren’t on speaking terms and messages had to be passed via aides,’ says Galaz.\n\nThe public image of unity was finally shattered by the debacle of an elephant shooting safari in Botswana in April 2012. Juan Carlos, then still King, fell and broke his hip, and had to be flown to Madrid for surgery. Finally, the full glare of a previously acquiescent media fell on a royal family that was falling apart while Spaniards grappled with 23 per cent unemployment.\n\nPhotographs of Juan Carlos posing with a dead elephant on a previous occasion were beamed around the world, sparking outrage, and the local media broke with tradition in identifying the King’s female companion on the trip, albeit coyly. Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein was brought to the Spanish public’s attention as Juan Carlos’s ‘charming friend’.\n\nJuan Carlos had met zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, now 56, a twice-divorced Danish businesswoman domiciled in Monaco, at a shooting party eight years earlier. The attractive blonde surprised the King by helping him with his shotgun. Zu Sayn-Wittgenstein knew her way around a firearm as she organised hunts and safaris for Boss & Co of London. Of all the women in his life, sources close to Juan Carlos concur that Corinna was his greatest passion. He lost his head. In the five years between 2004 and 2009, zu Sayn-Wittgenstein was often seen in his company, even accompanying the King on official visits.\n\n‘Juan Carlos’s abdication process began in Botswana, although it would take two years. His star fell,’ recalls Galaz. Leaning unsteadily on a pair of crutches, he rose from his bed after the hip operation to mumble in front of reporters: ‘I’m very sorry. I made a mistake and it won’t happen again.’ But Botswana had broken the seal of royal secrecy; Spaniards soon found out that the trip had been paid for by a Syrian businessman with links to the Saudi royal family, the first ominous rumbling of such unexpected connections.\n\nAdding to concerns about Juan Carlos’s image, the ageing King was beset by a series of health problems. Two years before the safari, he underwent surgery to have a benign tumour removed from his lungs. It was the first of a dozen operations including heart surgery in 2019. Insiders say the cancer scare jolted Juan Carlos into a realisation that he wanted a life more to his liking, at one point telling his children over dinner at a Madrid restaurant that he wished to divorce Sofía and marry zu Sayn-Wittgenstein. The Corinna o Corona (Corinna or the Crown) dilemma became a hot topic of conversation among the highest circles of the Spanish state, but the divorce and remarriage did not take place: either because the King was dissuaded, or because, according to zu Sayn-Wittgenstein’s version, she had already ended the relationship in 2009 when she found out he had been unfaithful to her. She has said the hunting trip to Botswana was a 10th-birthday present from the King to her son, who was on the safari, as was her first husband, Philip Adkins.\n\nFor Queen Sofía, the outing of the King and his erstwhile lover was the ultimate humiliation as she dutifully trooped through the media scrum in and out of the Madrid hospital where Juan Carlos was being treated. Galaz says that on her first two visits Sofía refused to enter the room where her husband lay, until advisors insisted the couple had a face-to-face talk about how to manage the PR disaster. ‘Having an unfaithful husband is one thing; literally the whole world knowing about it is quite another.’\n\nIn-house polling by the royal household showed Juan Carlos’s popularity flatlining. Among members of Spain’s political elite, the sense was that he had become a danger to the monarchy he himself refounded, and there was no option but for him to abdicate, which he did in June 2014. For Juan Carlos, now known as Spain’s Emeritus King, far worse ignominy was to come.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, tapes of zu SaynWittgenstein speaking to a former secret police officer emerged in the Spanish media, revealing a murky world of alleged kickbacks, offshore funds and covert intelligence operations. Her interlocutor was José Manuel Villarejo, who posed as an investigator who could help with complex legal matters. Villarejo, now awaiting trial in a Spanish jail, on suspicion of illegal espionage, was in the habit of secretly recording his conversations. ‘The King has no concept of what is legal and what isn’t,’ zu Sayn-Wittgenstein can be heard remarking casually, describing how Juan Carlos had used a Swiss lawyer to place assets under her name and then, after the relationship had broken down, demanded she return these assets. In the conversations, taped in London in 2015, zu Sayn-Wittgenstein said her life after Juan Carlos had become a ‘nightmare’ as agents of the Spanish state were pressuring her to give money back to the former king. In an affidavit sent to a Spanish court, she has accused Félix Sanz Roldán, the then director of Spain’s CNI intelligence service, of threatening her.\n\nJuicy as the taped allegations were, a Spanish court initially decided that the former king could not be investigated as he had enjoyed immunity from legal proceedings that covered the period up to his abdication in 2014. But in Geneva, a prosecutor called Yves Bertossa began to probe Juan Carlos’s affairs, placing zu Sayn-Wittgenstein and the former king’s Swiss lawyer and financial advisor under investigation for alleged money laundering. In particular, Bertossa was interested in a $100 million ‘donation’ received by Juan Carlos from the late King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in 2008. A structure called the Lucum Foundation was set up in Panama to hold the money, linked to a Swiss bank account – until 2012, when most of the remaining funds were signed over to zu Sayn-Wittgenstein as an ‘irrevocable gift’.\n\nWith the launch of judicial investigations, more stories of Juan Carlos’s dubious financial dealings began to appear in the media, apparently confirming a long-rumoured but never previously exposed penchant for kickbacks. His Swiss financial advisor told Bertossa that one day Juan Carlos had flown into Geneva and called at his home unexpectedly to hand him a briefcase containing $1.9 million from another foreign ruler.\n\nThat the murkier side of Juan Carlos’s reign should come to light was bad enough, but when King Felipe was linked to possible financial impropriety, the former monarch had to be sacrificed in the interests of the Crown. On 15 March, the day Spain entered a nationwide lockdown as Covid-19 began to spread uncontrollably, The Sunday Telegraph revealed that before Felipe had become king, he had been named as a hereditary beneficiary of two offshore funds used by Juan Carlos, including the Panama-based Lucum Foundation.\n\nThat evening King Felipe announced he would reject any eventual inheritance from his father and cut Juan Carlos off from his €200,000 annual stipend. In a paragraph at the end of that same communiqué, Juan Carlos informed his once-adoring subjects that he had appointed a lawyer to defend him in the battles to come. In June, Spain’s Supreme Court began to consider whether he could be accused of any wrongdoing. Though now abroad, his lawyer has declared him ‘at the disposal’ of the public prosecutor.\n\nKing Felipe had put clear water between himself and his father – but at a huge personal cost to his family and with no guarantee that he can quell the anger over Juan Carlos’s indiscretions. Felipe’s televised speech to the nation during the Covid crisis was marked by a noisy pot-banging protest on balconies around Spain, amid a social-media campaign demanding Juan Carlos donate his Saudi money to the Spanish health service.\n\nWhile Juan Carlos’s nickname is el campechano, the hearty one, Felipe is el preparado, the prepared one, on account of his possessing a law degree and an MA in international relations from Georgetown University, Washington. In easier times, long before his accession, Felipe had also shown a certain liking for female company, with a string of girlfriends including a rumoured fling with Gwyneth Paltrow. In May 2004, he married Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano, a former newsreader who, while a commoner, has failed to generate much sympathy among Spaniards. Despite her professional background as a journalist, Letizia largely eschews any direct communication with the nation. While the couple can still on occasion be glimpsed sneaking around Madrid incognito to see a film or visit friends, they are deeply private and precious little of their lives is shared with the public.\n\nWhat no one can doubt, however, is Felipe’s sense of duty towards his country. Even before the decision to distance himself from his father, he had shown a ruthless streak regarding family scandals. When his sister Princess Cristina and her husband, Iñaki Urdangarin, were ordered to stand trial for fraud, Felipe withdrew her title of Duchess of Palma over her connection to the affair. Cristina, the first royal to go on trial in modern Spain, was later acquitted, yet inevitably tension contaminated family relations. Once seen as the most grounded of her siblings with her relatively normal life working for a bank in Barcelona, she now lives in Geneva, reportedly battling depression as her husband serves his sentence of almost six years.\n\nPrincess Elena – the eldest of the siblings but not to be queen as Spain maintains male primogeniture – has kept a low profile and buried herself in her preferred charities since divorcing her aristocratic husband, Jaime de Marichalar, in 2009. Never a city slicker like Cristina, Elena’s closest connection in the family was always her father, Juan Carlos, with whom she shares a passion for the great outdoors and a good bullfight.\n\nEven if Felipe and his sisters could roll back the years and keep their childhood bonds, insiders note that Letizia has ruffled the feathers of the entire family, not least because of her obsession with protecting her two daughters from publicity. During an attempt to show a united family front in Palma de Mallorca two years ago, Letizia broke with any sense of protocol by publicly grappling with her mother-in-law in an apparent bid to prevent a photo opportunity with Princesses Leonor, 14, and Sofía, 13. ‘The family no longer exists as such. It has been dissolved,’ says Jaime Peñafiel, Spain’s best-known royal observer. ‘It’s not right that a son should ignore the presumption of innocence of his own father and allow open season so that anyone can get stuck into the personal life of Juan Carlos. This is something that will haunt Felipe for the rest of his life, just as Juan Carlos was haunted by betraying his own father when he agreed to be Franco’s heir.\n\n‘Juan Carlos was a magnificent king who piloted in Spain’s democracy from the Franco dictatorship. He was very much loved by Spaniards, but money was his undoing. We don’t know why. His love life was not the problem; he is a Bourbon and the Bourbons have always been womanisers.’\n\nAccording to Carlos Espinosa de los Monteros, a longtime friend of the former king, Juan Carlos understood the pressure on his son to distance himself from scandal. ‘In that family’s relations, there is the normal affectionate side, and then there is this extra component in which the key is a responsibility to defend and conserve the continuation of the Crown.’\n\nMany predict that Felipe VI will be Spain’s last king, faced with the almost impossible task of restoring popularity to an institution his father made – before he squandered the precious capital of public goodwill. ‘Felipe is a nice lad, easygoing, but he doesn’t have half the charisma of his father. People don’t empathise with him,’ says Peñafiel.\n\nMábel Galaz believes that Felipe could do a great job for Spain as an ambassador for his country in the fields of business and diplomacy. ‘But it is an uphill battle. The British royals also have great scandals to deal with, but the big difference is that in the UK the monarchy as an institution is held on high, above all things. But not here. Spain was a country of Juan Carlistas, not monarchists.’\n\nAs the weeks pass, sources close to Juan Carlos say he is beginning to feel bored in his suite at the Emirates Palace, a gilded cage laid on by Mohammed bin Zayed, Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince and one of the former monarch’s many royal pals on the Arabian Peninsula. Having received only a couple of visits since his arrival, the former king has had plenty of time to ruminate over his predicament as he awaits the result of the investigation into his affairs at Spain’s Supreme Court. In London, Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein’s lawyers are preparing a suit accusing Spanish security agents of harassment, alleging that Juan Carlos’s former mistress has been spied on and intimidated on British soil for several years. The Swiss probe seems to have slowed, but he has no immunity in that country if it cranks back into life. ‘For Spaniards under 40, I’ll be remembered for Corinna, the elephant and briefcases [of cash],’ Juan Carlos reflected to friends recently.\n\n‘I think Juan Carlos has had cause to regret the relationship with Corinna several times over recent years,’ says Carlos Espinosa de los Monteros. ‘If he had died three years ago, then virtually everyone in Spain would have sung his praises. Clearly, if his obituary were written today, it would be very different and much darker. But he still intends to die in Spain."
