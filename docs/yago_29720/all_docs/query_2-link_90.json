Beforehand, I had forgotten about the formerly-Orthodox queen, but as soon as I saw her, my memory became clearer. I must admit, inwardly I was beeming at such a high-profile Orthodox figure embracing the Catholic Faith. (ooohh, I'm gonna get hell for this!)\n\nOh, BTW, Griego, there was a thread on this very topic awhile back (though I don't think it began as such...thus the problem with changing topics in one thread); I believe around Sep-Oct of last year. You could try and find it in the long-lost back pages.\n\nLogos Teen\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 1,252\n\nQuote\n\nOriginally posted by griego catolico:\n\nWith the visit of His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, to Spain this past weekend, my thoughts focused on Queen Sophia of Spain.\n\nQueen Sophia is originally a Greek princess of the now exiled Greek royal family.

We hear almost nothing about them in the U.S.\n\nI have a photo of their crowning, but it is not of good enough quality to scan in.\n\nAs you said about their modesty they must not attract the media's twisted attention.\n\nAs Logos Teen said there was a thread on the forum about them some time back, As I recall there was not alot of detail about the Spanish royal couple.\n\nOur friend from Spain, Francisco, could be of help. I hope he still checks in with the forum.\n\nI will stay tuned.\n\nChrist's peace,\n\nPaul\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 441\n\nActually, Queen Sophia was required to become Catholic in order to marry Prince Juan Carlos. It was the same with Prince Philip in the UK, when Archbishop Temple (I think) insisted on his conversion to the Anglican faith. The same can be applied with Dagmar and Alex of Denmark upon their marriages into the Russian Royal Family (or lest we forget that grand-dame Catherine the Great). Logos may be happy that such a high ranking Orthodox person converted [ ] but equally, we can can praise Tsar \"Foxy\" Ferdinard of Bulgaria for baptising Prince Boris into the correct faith.........even though the Pope was spluttering in anger!\n\nAnton\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 589\n\n&#935;&#929;&#921;&#931;&#932;&#927;&#931; &#913;&#925;&#917;&#931;&#932;&#919;\n\n&#913;&#923;&#919;&#920;&#937;&#931; &#913;&#925;&#917;&#931;&#932;&#919;\n\n1. Princess Sophia of Greece became member of the Catholic Church after his arrival to Spain after her weding in Athens with prince Juan Carlos of Spain in 1962.\n\n2. Her \"convertion\" to Catholicim took place in a privaze ceremony at the chapel of their residence of the Palacio de la Zarzuela. The ceremony was presided by the Archbishop of the Armed Forces if I am not wrong.\n\n3. She is member of the (Latin) Church of Spain and she does not belong to any Eastern Catholic Chuch.\n\n4. There is no reference to the 'Privilege de Blanc' in the democratic Spanish Constitution of 1978\n\n5. The spiritual and catechetical praparation for the royal wedding was assumed by the for 30 years chaplain of the Spanish embassy in Athens, father Irineos, a Greek byzantine rite priest and hero of the resistence during the II European War who found refugee for a lot of of Hebrew families during German ocupation.\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nDear Friends,\n\nRoyalty have intermarried for centuries and have changed Churches for that long too.\n\nSt Yaroslav the Wise of Kyiv's daughters were all married to Western European Royalty - one daughter was Queen of France, married, I believe, to King Henri I.\n\nOne of the patrons of Bavaria is St Edigna who happens to be the great granddaughter of St Volodymyr of Kyiv.\n\nPrince Philip himself embraced Anglicanism when he married you-know-who .\n\nToday he has returned to Orthodoxy and Prince Michael of Kent is Orthodox too.\n\nBut Prince Philip's royal family was not \"Greek\" even though the Hohenzollerns were invited to assume the Throne of Greece for a while.\n\nHe was of Germanic background, as was St Alexandra and St Elizabeth Romanov, both former Lutherans.\n\nRoyalty has never made a tremendous fuss over these issues.\n\nWhen a Protestant future King of France was offered the throne on condition he become a Catholic, he agreed saying that \"Paris is worth a Mass.\"\n\nQueen Sophia became a formal Roman Catholic, just as the daughters of St Yaroslav the Wise did when they married into Western European Royalty.\n\nAlex\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 351\n\nQuote\n\nLogos may be happy that such a high ranking Orthodox person converted [ ] but equally, we can can praise Tsar \"Foxy\" Ferdinard of Bulgaria for baptising Prince Boris into the correct faith.........even though the Pope was spluttering in anger!\n\nDear AntonI:\n\nPoor prince Boris was terrified beyond words at his Orthodox confirmation.\n\nHe cried throughout the service and at the end ran home to his mother who was in utter despair at the situation.\n\nBoris had been originally Baptized in the Roman Catholic faith of his Parents.\n\nHis mother who was a very pious Italian Princess was extremely aggrieved that his father was forcing this thing upon the child.\n\nShe sincerely believed that he was imperiling her son's soul.\n\nShe had a difficult marriage to Ferdinand and died heartbroken at an early age.\n\nI believe that if Ferdinand had made clear his intentions beforehand she would never have married him.\n\nFerdinand tried to get Pope Leo XIII to agree to the Orthodox confirmation, but the Pope could not in any conscience (in his words) \"allow his child to fall into schism\".\n\nFerdinand left the Pope's presence in an angry rage, swearing obscenities in a laud voice as he left the Vatican.\n\nHe was excommunicated by the Church for forcing the confirmation.\n\nFerdinand in exile was later reconciled to the Church after Boris, who was now an adult, was seen to accept the Orthodox faith of his own accord.\n\nAll in all hardly a praiseworthy occurrence.\n\ndefreitas"
