        "text": "For the first time in modern Spanish history, a member of the royal family has been put on trial.\n\nPrincess Cristina, the 50-year-old elder sister of King Felipe VI and sixth in line to the Spanish throne, was accused of tax fraud, after a lengthy inquiry into her husband's business activities.\n\nShe has been stripped of her title as duchess, and if convicted could face eight years in jail.\n\nShe was questioned in court and denied all knowledge of criminal activity, telling the magistrate she trusted her husband.\n\nBut the magistrate, Jose Castro, wrote in an indictment in 2015 that there were indications the princess had profited \"through silent collaboration and a 50% stake\" in her husband's business.\n\nIn a sign of how far the princess has fallen, the princess will sit at the back of the courtroom alongside the press.\n\nPrincess Cristina is accused of collaborating in her husband's crimes but she has not been charged by a state prosecutor.\n\nShe is on trial because of a private prosecution brought by anti-corruption group Clean Hands (Manos Limpias).\n\nThe princess and her husband co-owned a company called Aizoon. The central allegation is that Aizoon received more than â¬1m from Mr Urdangarin's Noos foundation, and that the princess and her husband used some of that money for personal expenses.\n\nBefore the investigating magistrate looked into the case and said the princess had a case to answer, an anti-corruption prosecutor decided there was no evidence that she had committed crimes.\n\nHer defence lawyer, Miquel Roca, has said she is innocent and asked the three judges to apply the \"Botin doctrine\", under which a private tax prosecution can be rejected if the case has not been filed by state prosecutors or tax authorities.\n\nBut like a previous attempt by her lawyers in another court in Palma in November 2014, the appeal failed and the judges ruled in January 2016 that the princess must stand trial.\n\nSpain's royal family has in effect washed its hands of Princess Cristina.\n\nAfter the scandal broke, in late 2011, the couple were excluded from any official royal events or duties, as the then King, Juan Carlos, tried to protect the royal reputation.\n\nIn 2013, the couple moved to Geneva with their four children, in an attempt to spare the royal family further embarrassment. But even that move was poorly judged, as the Spanish taxpayer had to pay for their private security.\n\nJuan Carlos's reputation did suffer from the scandal, and took a further hit when it emerged that he had broken a hip on a lavish elephant-hunting trip. At the time Spain was in the grip of the eurozone debt crisis.\n\nA German princess had been with the king in Botswana - so there were rumours of an affair. On his return, the king's wife, Queen Sofia, visited him in hospital only briefly.\n\nIn June 2014, Juan Carlos abdicated and was succeeded by King Felipe VI.\n\nA year later, by royal decree of the new king, the Duke and Duchess of Palma de Mallorca were stripped of the titles given to them when they married in 1997.\n\nDays later the couple sold their mansion in Barcelona, removing one of their few remaining links with Spain.\n\nThe princess was now referred to in court documents as Cristina de Borbon y Grecia.\n\nAfter a year on the throne, he was given the thumbs-up by 81% of Spaniards, according to one opinion poll. Queen Letizia had ratings almost as high.\n\nBut he also faces a constitutional crisis, with pro-independence parties in Catalonia spearheading a move to separate the region from Spain.\n\nA Catalan speaker himself, Felipe visited the region last year and called for \"respect, understanding and co-existence\". His Christmas message in 2015 made a direct appeal for \"national cohesion\".\n\nThe monarchy will survive the trial of Princess Cristina, but will have further crises to come.\n\nKing Felipe calls for national unity"
