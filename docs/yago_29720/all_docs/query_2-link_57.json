        "text": "Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQueen Letizia of Spain’s unusual rise to royalty: before she married King Felipe, she was a TV journalist who was once married to a high school teacher …\n\nSTORYLeah Simpson\n\nSep 8 , 2021\n\nShe might be one of the most glamorous royals of Europe now, but Queen Letizia of Spain hasn’t always been about that opulent life. So how exactly did she get to where she is today?\n\nLetizia’s humble roots\n\nLetizia Ortiz Rocasolano grew up in a middle-class family with her parents – a journalist and a nurse – and her two sisters. Letizia studied journalism at university and went on to follow in her father Jesús José Ortiz Álvarez’s footsteps.\n\nShe scored jobs at popular TV station 24 Horas and even worked for CNN+ before reporting on massive events such as September 11 and the US presidential elections for Spanish agency news. Little did she know at the time that one day, as queen, she’d be hosted at the White House by former US presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump …\n\nLetizia’s first husband\n\nLetizia and Meghan Markle have more in common than just being pictured outside some of the world’s most famous houses (such as Buckingham Palace and the White House) and being wined and dined inside them after marrying into some of the most powerful families on the planet. They both have ex-husbands who have interesting stories to tell about their former spouses, too.\n\nMeghan’s ex, producer Trevor Engelson, signed on for a Fox pilot comedy show about a man whose ex-wife is now married to a British prince. Letizia’s ex-husband, meanwhile, high school literature teacher Alonso Guerrero Pérez, wrote El Amor de Penny Robinson (The Love of Penny Robinson) and has admitted that it’s based on their marriage, split and Letizia’s second marriage. However, both projects are classed as fiction.\n\nPrincess Letizia\n\nLetizia – who dated Guerrero Pérez for 10 years – was only married to the writer for one year, until 1999. She met Spain’s King Felipe VI in 2002 when he was a prince of Asturias, and she was covering the Prestige tanker oil spill in Galicia, Spain. The pair secretly dated and Letizia eventually quit her job before they announced their engagement in November 2003. The prince popped the question with a 16 baguette diamond ring with white gold trim and Letizia gifted him white gold and sapphire cufflinks, as well as a classic book.\n\nAs her first marriage was only a civil one, the Catholic Church allowed her to marry Felipe in 2004 and they went on to have two children – Leonor, Princess of Asturias, and Infanta Sofía.\n\nRoyal scandals\n\nIn 2014, a series of scandals ended the 40-year reign of Juan Carlos I, who abdicated the throne. Felipe became the new king, making Letizia the new queen – and the first commoner to take on the role.\n\nHer journey to the throne has not been without rumours, however, which range from her supposedly getting an abortion during her first marriage, to a nose job. Letizia eventually admitted she had surgery, but claimed it was to help with a respiratory issue due to a deviated septum.\n\nA common queen?\n\nDespite her royal status, the 2015 book The Court of Felipe VI claims that the former king Juan Carlos wasn’t keen on having her around due to her past as a journalist. His aristocratic friends would even apparently refer to her as “the maid” when joking about her commoner roots. He said his soon-to-be daughter-in-law at the time was “the worst thing to happen” to the royal family, according to The Daily Mail.\n\nHowever, for much of the Spanish public, the high street brand-wearing monarch and her laid-back king have been a breath of fresh air that have reignited the country’s love for the public figureheads.\n\nWant more stories like this?
