        "text": "When choosing the wedding day, it was taken into account that, according to the meteorological records, May 22 had not registered rain in Madrid for decades. The forecasts failed, and the wedding of Felipe de Borbón and Letizia Ortiz will be remembered for the merciless downpour that fell on the capital of Spain. However, while the rain dampened the celebrations, an inner sun shone upon the couple as they starred in a wedding in front of millions of people and also experienced an intimate celebration with codes that only they knew.\n\nThis Wednesday, twenty years later, the now King and Queen celebrated the anniversary in privacy, remembering the day the world watched them as they looked at each other.\n\nThe bride and groom didn't get much sleep the night before their wedding. The dinner offered to the royal guests at the El Pardo Palace ended late, and both Letizia and Felipe woke up before 6 a.m. to get ready for the big day. The bride, who needed hours for makeup and hairdressing, was calmer than the Prince, with whom she exchanged messages until each started to get dressed for the occasion. Letizia did so at the Royal Palace and Felipe at the Zarzuela.\n\nThe wedding dress, by Pertegaz, was carefully arranged and closely monitored since it arrived on a special flight from Barcelona. The maids of the Zarzuela and an assistant of the deceased designer helped the bride get dressed. She was left alone with them, after her mother, Paloma Rocasolano, briefly hugged her daughter who would soon head to the Almudena to become the Princess of Asturias.\n\nPrince Felipe's courtship also focused on the Royal Palace; the space is large enough to protect the bride's view of the surroundings. At 10:42, when the rain was already threatening, the Dukes of Calabria, the Dukes of Soria (Infanta Margarita and Carlos Zurita), Infanta Cristina and Iñaki Urdangarín, Infanta Elena and Jaime de Marichalar, King Juan Carlos with Infanta Pilar on his arm, and finally, Prince Felipe with Queen Sofia, left through the Puerta del Rey of the Royal Palace towards the Almudena Cathedral. The arrival of the groom and his mother at the cathedral's entrance coincided with the beginning of a downpour, although they could still do without umbrellas.\n\nJust as the Prince and Queen Sofía entered the cathedral, it was planned for Letizia, along with her father, Jesús Ortiz, and the boys and girls acting as pages and ladies-in-waiting, along with the two young ladies serving as maids of honor, to leave the entrance of the Royal Palace and cross, walking in procession, the Armory courtyard towards the Almudena. It was impossible, as the rain began to fall with such intensity that it forced them to put Plan B into action, which involved using the Rolls Royces, already prepared, for both the bride and her father as well as for the children. However, the downpour made it practically impossible for the bride to step out of the car by the cathedral stairs, even though the entrance had been covered, to prevent the rain from not only spoiling but almost ruining that moment.\n\nInside the cathedral, all the guests, including the groom and the royal family, shuddered at each thunderclap, and minutes passed with no sign of the bride. The security and protocol services could only look up at the sky, hoping for a clearing long enough for the bride to climb the steps of La Almudena with the least possible risk. Finally, at around 11:30, thirty minutes later than scheduled, Letizia got into the Rolls Royce and arrived at La Almudena. She stepped out of the car, soaked her Manolo Blahnik shoes, a gift from Jaime de Marichalar, and climbed the stairs, leaving behind journalist Letizia Ortiz to walk towards her new life.\n\nAfter crossing the main nave of the cathedral, among kings, princes, politicians, authorities, and friends, Letizia arrived in front of Felipe. “Everything is so beautiful,” read the bride's lips as their gazes met, just as their hands had intertwined during the ceremony. Through firm grips, they spoke in a code only known to them, a language that had been meaningful throughout their own wedding."
