        "text": "Reaching the age of maturity and taking this oath now means that she can officially act as regent in the event that her father, King Felipe, is incapacitated or steps down. It will not surprise onlookers that the former King, now 85, along with his wife, Queen Sofia, also 85, were excluded from the ceremony. The vast spectrum of controversies he has attracted may well have unduly clouded the integrity of Leonor’s swearing to be faithful to Spain’s constitution.\n\nIt truly was a flying visit – with Spanish media reporting that Juan Carlos, who now lives in the UAE, was in Madrid for just seven hours. This must surely mean that his presence was seen as a necessary politeness, but was also perceived seen to be disruptive and to be minimised.\n\nRead More\n\nAs Princess Leonor turns 18, Tatler charts her sartorial ascendency\n\nTatler looks at how the young royal has crafted her public persona through shrewd fashion choices on the cusp of her 18th birthday\n\nIn previous years, Carlos was considered one of Spain’s most respected public figures, particularly as he helped the country return to democratic government after the death of Francisco Franco in 1975. However, the later years of his reign were blighted by a string of ugly scandals. He became embroiled in a court battle with an ex-lover (one of many), who accused him of mentally torturing her by spying and harassment.\n\nHis libidinous living was a constant source of upset for the Spanish royal family. He was also involved in a money-laundering scandal in the early 2020s, leaving behind an ugly hush money trail involving Bahrainian royalty and Swiss bank accounts. This affair utterly rocked the foundations of the Spanish royal family, though it should be noted that a number of the allegations have now been dropped.\n\nJuan Carlos remains married to his wife Queen Sofia, in spite of uncountable extramarital affairs. The former Queen was spotted broken down in tears earlier this week, during a different royal engagement in Madrid, as rumours abounded as to whether the grandparents would attend Princess Leonor’s historic swearing in.\n\nRead More\n\nSpain descends into ‘Leonormania’ as the Princess celebrates her 18th birthday with an oath of loyalty to the Spanish constitution\n\nThe future Queen's status and significance was cemented in a covenant with the country's parliament\n\nAs for Leonor, when she ascends the throne, she will become Spain’s first Queen Regent for 150 years. Her reputation continues to go from strength to strength. She is clearly viewed as a pioneer of renewal for the Spanish monarchy, as it continues to distance itself from the disrepute bred by King Juan Carlos. The swearing in ceremony proceeded accordingly, and was a definite success – to which the crowds in the streets of the capital and the profusion of Spanish flags were an obvious testament (dubbed ‘Leonormania’ by the media)."
