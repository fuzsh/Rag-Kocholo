        "text": "The stately, orderly preparations for the royal wedding a week from tomorrow were disrupted tonight when the Spanish Government announced that King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia had declined their invitation to the ceremony as an act of protest.\n\nTheir decision resulted from the plan of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer to board the royal yacht Britannia at Gibraltar for a two-week honeymoon cruise in the Mediterranean after spending their first two nights as husband and wife at Broadlands, the country estate of the late Earl Mountbatten of Burma at Romsey in Hampshire.\n\nGibraltar, a two-square-mile enclave near the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula, has been a British naval base and crown colony since the early 18th century and has long been a subject of dispute between the two nations. It is one of Spain's most emotional political issues, with leaders of most political parties demanding that the British withdraw.\n\nTrip Is Called 'Gratuitous'\n\nA spokesman for the Spanish Foreign Ministry described the plan to have the Prince of Wales and his new Princess travel to ''The Rock,'' as it has been known for centuries, as ''inopportune, gratuitous and mistaken.'' The Spanish Government and royal family, he said, had decided jointly that the King and Queen should cancel plans to attend the wedding at St. Paul's Cathedral.\n\nBuckingham Palace said tonight that it could confirm the decision but would decline to comment further. It was not known whether the British Foreign Office, which has been trying to negotiate a settlement of the Gibraltar dispute as part of the preparation for Spain's entry into the Common Market, had warned the palace of the uproar the honeymoon plans might cause in Spain.\n\n''I find it inconceivable that the palace would have ignored political advice if such advice had been given,'' a source close to the royal family said tonight.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
