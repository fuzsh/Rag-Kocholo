Queen Sofia still lives in Spain.\n\nItâ€™s the second time in weeks that Juan Carlos and Sofia have been seen together in past weeks. At the start of June, they attended the wedding of Crown Prince Hussein and Princess Rajwa in Jordan.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nIt was also a rare public appearance for Infanta Cristina and Inaki Urdangarin. They separated after he was photographed with another woman as the supervised release period of a prison sentence for embezzlement began.\n\nIrene Urdangarin is the only daughter of Infanta Cristina and Inaki Urdangarin. She was born in June 2005 and is now tenth in line to the throne of Spain."
