        "text": "MADRID — Spain has been magnificent at giving birth to painters and poets, impressive at minting novelists, chefs and soccer players, but thoroughly inept at producing good kings.\n\nApart from Ferdinand and Isabella, Philip II, Charles III, and for the sentimental, Alfonso XII (who died at 27 in 1885), no Spanish monarch can indisputably be called “great.” This scorecard dates back to 1492, the year in which, most historians would agree, it became meaningful to talk of “Spain” in anything resembling the modern sense.\n\nOn a recent afternoon here, I lunched with two experts in Spanish kingship, at one of those masculine restaurants where no patron of good repute starts to eat before two in the afternoon (and only those of ill repute finish earlier than 4:30 pm).\n\nIn between sips of manzanilla and mouthfuls of jamon iberico, both experts staunchly insisted that a sixth name be added to that short list: Juan Carlos I, the king who abdicated last year in favor of his son, and who did more than any man alive to ensure that democracy took root in Spain after the death in 1975 of Francisco Franco.\n\nJuan Carlos ceded the throne to his son, Felipe — now King Felipe VI — who at 6 feet 6 inches stands a head taller than his father (who stands two heads taller than most Spaniards of his own generation). It is apt that the Spanish for “Highness” is alteza, a word that also means loftiness in a physical sense. As we talked of Felipe, my lunch companions expressed the view — guardedly, because he’s reigned for less than a year — that the young king could one day not merely match his father in monarchical consequence, but possibly exceed him. This was high praise indeed from two very discerning palace-watchers.\n\n* * *\n\nFelipe VI, just 47, is a remarkable man, not least because he’s the first Spanish monarch to marry a commoner, and a divorcee at that. Queen Letizia — whose name, as she is wont to explain to English speakers, means “happiness” — was a news anchor. In fact, Felipe first saw her on TV, fancied her greatly, and asked an aide to set up an informal dinner at a friend’s home. “And boom,” says Ramon Perez-Maura, deputy editor at ABC, Spain’s leading conservative newspaper, and one of my lunch companions. Felipe and Letizia hit it off, to the consternation of Spanish traditionalists, who’d have preferred their Crown Prince to cast his eye on a woman from the aristocracy. And as we all now know, they married.\n\nIf there were fears that a plebeian would be a misfit as a king’s consort, they have been laid to rest. “You can see how Letizia has evolved from being insecure when seated at a banquet table for dinner, to being fully in control,” says Perez-Maura. “She has become far more comfortable since she became queen.”\n\nMy other lunchmate, Charles Powell, author of the first English-language biography of Juan Carlos, adds that “Felipe married for love, which shows character on his part. She keeps him grounded, a lower-middle-class woman who is part of the meritocracy that characterizes the Spanish transition to democracy. She is the first queen of Spain who’s done a serious day’s work, and has earned a salary.” She has also been resolute in severing ties with her former journalist colleagues and associates. “She can’t have done otherwise,” says Powell.\n\nLetizia offers an obvious contrast to Queen Sofia, her mother-in-law. Although she has lived in Spain since 1962, Sofia has always spoken Spanish with a mild German accent. This may be the result of her having been born into the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg; but she is also vegetarian, non-nocturnal and opposed to bullfighting. The thoroughly Spanish Letizia, by comparison, is an excellent public speaker, with a limpid anchorwoman’s diction — and undeniable wattage. “Remember,” says Powell, “that Felipe first noticed her on the TV screen.”\n\n* * *\n\nPowell explains that Felipe “has had the benefits of a formal education, at university in Madrid and at Georgetown in the US. This is something his father never had, poor man. He went to Spanish military academies in the 1960s!” The young king is “the first university-educated king Spain has ever had, and that implies discipline, rigor, and the ability to listen. It also makes him capable of improvising intelligently.” Felipe’s years in college, Perez-Maura adds, “make him someone who has a capacity to study issues. His father’s main strength as king was his warmth, and his capacity to seduce people.”\n\nJuan Carlos sought to make up for his lack of formal education by being very — some would say excessively — colloquial in his informal conversations with journalists and the like. “This was fun at first,” says Powell, “given the contrast with Franco. In later years, however, it often made him sound rather paternalistic. He came over as a little too folksy, something Felipe is careful to avoid. Paradoxically, Felipe is more respectful — and formal — in his informal contacts.”\n\nThis is just one of many contrasts between Felipe and his father, who was a bon vivant with a mastery of seduction that — it is no secret — extended beyond matters of state. Juan Carlos was, as Powell puts it, “a self-made monarch.” The monarchy in Spain is “under-institutionalized. It’s the monarchy as a ‘crowned republic.’” After 36 years of Franco’s dictatorship, “everything about the monarchy rested on Juan Carlos’s charisma, and when he lost that charisma, he had to go.”\n\nThe story of the old king’s fall from grace is almost operatic. It wasn’t the string of mistresses that eroded his stature in the eyes of Spain: Spain is not that sort of country. Juan Carlos was damaged by the financial scandal that swirled around the royal household in a time of severe economic crisis. His son-in-law — Iñaki Urdangarin, the Duke of Palma, husband of Princess Cristina — became mired in allegations of major corruption and money laundering.\n\nAmid all of this, the king himself — who bore no personal responsibility for Urdangarin’s shenanigans — angered Spanish public opinion by shooting an elephant dead for sport while on vacation in Botswana. The kill came to light because the king broke his hip while hunting. To ram home the decadence of it all, Spanish newspapers did the math, and estimated that his hunting holiday had cost twice the average annual salary in Spain. Official explanations that the trip was paid for by a Syrian businessman and not by the Spanish taxpayer served only to diminish the king’s majesty still further. The story went global, and Vanity Fair ran a piece titled “The Reign in Spain is Mainly on the Wane.”\n\nJosé Antonio Zarzalejos had been editor of the avowedly monarchist ABC until 2008, so he induced gasps in Spain by effectively calling for the king’s abdication in a widely read blog in February 2013. He is still a monarchist, and as impressed with Felipe VI as he was unimpressed with the late-era Juan Carlos.\n\n“The present king is the politician with the highest reputation in Spain today,” he says. “He has won the respect of public opinion, especially in Catalonia — something which Juan Carlos had lost.” Of Queen Letizia, Zarzalejos says that “she connects very well with those Spaniards who have no connection with the aristocracy or the world of money. We’ve never had a queen in Spain with her life experience. You can see that she’s a very good influence on Felipe. She’s made him less rigid. She’s humanized him enormously.”\n\nFelipe, says Zarzalejos, is constructing “a new royal family for Spain, and making a personal effort to be financially austere, in keeping with the times.” Politically, he is a king who knows that he “has to legitimize himself by doing the quotidian things right, doing his job day in and day out — unlike his father, who derived his legitimacy from his role in great events of state and history.” This is a point amplified by Perez-Maura, the ABC newspaperman. “The monarchy has developed over the last 40 years with Juan Carlos as king. Modern, democratic Spain has only had one king — one model. The model could change if Felipe succeeds in making an enduring institution of the monarchy.”\n\nIt seems likely that Felipe will succeed. The Spanish royals have lived in much less of a bubble than their English counterparts. Spain now has a nuclear royal family: dad, mom and two kids, who like to spend time together. The king and queen have gone to college. As Spain strains to resist the secession of Catalonia and to quell a recession that has robbed its youth of employment, it helps to have a monarchy that seems so thoroughly “in touch.” Sometimes, the appearance of normality is as comforting as normality itself — perhaps never more so than in the case of kings."
