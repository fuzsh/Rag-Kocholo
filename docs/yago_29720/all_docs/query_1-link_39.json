        "text": "Felipe VI (born January 30, 1968, Madrid, Spain) is the king of Spain from 2014.\n\nFelipe was born in the latter years of the Francisco Franco regime, as the dictator’s health was declining and the government was taking halting steps in the direction of greater political and economic liberalization. On November 22, 1975, two days after Franco’s death, Felipe’s father, Juan Carlos, became king. Two years later his only son and heir apparent, Felipe, was named prince of Asturias. In 1981 Felipe was made a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece. From 1984 to 1985 he studied at a private school in Lakefield, Ontario, Canada. In 1986, on his 18th birthday, Felipe swore allegiance to Juan Carlos and was officially named heir to the throne. Having received training (1985–88) at each of Spain’s armed service academies, Felipe was commissioned as an officer in the army, navy, and air force and was certified as a helicopter pilot. He was a member of the Spanish Olympic sailing team at the 1992 Games in Barcelona, where he finished sixth in the Soling event. After earning a law degree (1993) from Madrid’s Autonomous University, he received a master’s degree (1995) in international relations from Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nThroughout the 1990s Felipe took a more active role in representing the Spanish monarchy both domestically and abroad. In 2004 he married Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano, a popular television news presenter, and the pair became known for their relatively modest lifestyle. Upon Felipe’s rise to the throne, she became the first commoner in Spanish history to be named queen. The couple had two children: Leonor, born in 2005, and Sofía, born in 2007. Leonor became princess of Asturias and heir presumptive when her father was proclaimed king, a position that she would retain barring the birth of a son to her parents."
