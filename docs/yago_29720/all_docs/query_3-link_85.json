        "text": "Former king of Spain Juan Carlos was an unexpected attendee at Windsor Castle on Tuesday.\n\nMembers of the Spanish royal family joined members of the British royal family for a thanksgiving service at St George's chapel in honour of the late King Constantine of Greece.\n\nThe disgraced Spanish royal – who remains in a self-imposed exile in the UAE following a corruption scandal and being sued by a former lover – joined son King Felipe VI and his wife, Queen Letizia.\n\nCOMPETITION: Win a $15,000 cruise holiday to see the Northern Lights\n\nQueen Sofia of Spain, Juan Carlos' wife and King Constantine's sister, was also in attendance though the pair didn't sit together.\n\nQueen Sofia, who is still married to the former king, was seen sitting with Princess Theodora of Greece, Prince Philippos of Greece and Princess Irene of Greece inside St George's Chapel.\n\nREAD MORE: Kate 'doing well' as Prince William pulls out of royal engagement last minute due to 'personal matter'\n\nKing Felipe, 56, was seen helping his frail father as Juan Carlos walked with a cane in hand.\n\nThe former king was seen holding his son's arm as he made his way to his seat inside the church and when they left the chapel.\n\nQueen Letizia stood back, near her mother-in-law, as the women allowed the men to walk ahead of them as they exited the service.\n\nJuan Carlos isn't seen very often and was last spotted in public at the Jordanian royal wedding in Amman last June, where he was being pushed in a wheelchair.\n\nBefore that, the 86-year-old made an appearance in Athens in January 2023 for King Constantine's funeral.\n\nJuan Carlos is believed to have made a flying visit to Madrid last November for his granddaughter Princess Leonor's 18th birthday, staying in the country for just seven hours.\n\nWhile he's reported to have attended a private family gathering for the milestone birthday, he was not part of official ceremonies and didn't attend the future Queen's historic oath-taking ceremony at the Spanish parliament.\n\nJuan Carlos abdicated the Spanish throne in 2014 following two years of scandals that saw his popularity plummet.\n\nAfter 39 years as King, he made way for his son to take over on June 19, 2014."
