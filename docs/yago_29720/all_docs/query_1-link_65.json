        "text": "Besieged by allegations, investigations and scandal around his financial arrangements, and weeks after he was linked to an inquiry into alleged corruption that has further harmed the already embattled Spanish monarchy, former king Juan Carlos has gone into exile abroad, the Casa Real (Royal House) has confirmed.\n\nThe 82-year-old ex-monarch officially announced his decision on Monday, August 3, in a letter to his son, King Felipe, in whose name he had abdicated the throne six years ago, adding that he would be available to prosecutors.\n\nIn Spain, the first reactions to the royal announcement have been divided between those who think the aged king, who was a prominent figure in the transition to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco Franco, should have stayed to face justice and those who think his presence in the country has become toxic and an embarrassment to his son’s reign.\n\nForbesSpanish Monarchy Under Fire: Lies, Unsolicited Gifts And A New Criminal Investigation\n\n“King Juan Carlos Abandons Spain Because Of His Scandals” the Spanish newspaper Vanguardia headlined its main story.\n\n“Juan Carlos I has left Spain,” the daily newspaper El Pais reported. “The king emeritus communicated to his son, Felipe VI, his ‘thoughtful decision’ to move abroad in the face of the ‘public repercussions’ of the news about his accounts in tax havens and to help the head of the state to carry out its function ‘from the tranquility’ that the position requires.”\n\nSecret Whereabouts\n\nRumors abound on the destination chosen by the embattled ex-monarch, with the latest reports from the Spanish pro-monarchy newspaper ABC placing him Abu Dhabi.\n\n“The 82-year-old boarded a private jet on Monday from Vigo in northwestern Spain along with one aide and four bodyguards, seven hours later, the plane landed at a business airport in the capital of the United Arab Emirates,” wrote The Local.\n\nLa Vanguardia and ABC had wrote that Juan Carlos had first gone to Portugal by car on Monday morning, and then “flew from there to the Dominican Republic, where he plans to stay for a few weeks with a family who made their wealth in sugar plantations, before looking for a new destination,” according to Reuters.\n\nThe Spanish royal palace hasn’t confirmed his whereabouts.\n\nJuan Carlos abdicated in 2014 after nearly 40 years serving as a highly popular king, in the wake of a corruption investigation involving his daughter, Infanta Cristina, and her husband, Iñaki Urdangarí (who is still in jail), and a controversial elephant-hunting trip to Botswana as Spain was suffering the worst of a financial crisis.\n\n“In recent years, the revelations about his private life and financial affairs have tarnished what was once seen as one of Europe’s model monarchies,” The Guardian explains.\n\nMoving From The King’s Shadow\n\nThe allegations of impropriety have now followed the former monarch for years, negatively affecting the efforts by his son, King Felipe, to move the monarchy out of his father’s shadow.\n\nIn March, amid rumors about the former king’s finances and allegations of bribes linked to a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia, King Felipe had cut his father’s annual stipend that amounted to $228,000 and “renounced his own personal inheritance from his father after reports that he was in line to receive millions of euros from a secret offshore fund with ties to Saudi Arabia,” The Guardian wrote.\n\nIn the letter to his son, the embattled king wrote that “in the face of the public repercussions that certain past events in my private life are generating,” he made the decision to leave the royal palace and the country to help Felipe “exercise his responsibilities” as king, with \"tranquillity.\"\n\n\"Guided by the conviction to best serve the people of Spain, its institutions, and you as king, I inform you of my decision at this time to leave Spain.\"\n\nJuan Carlos added: “This is a very emotional decision, but one I take with great serenity.”\n\nThe statement was released hours after the emeritus king had left the Zarzuela palace, where he has resided for the past 58 years, and reportedly after he was already outside Spain, El Pais reported.\n\nHis wife, Queen Sofia, will remain in Spain, living in the Zarzuela Palace and “following her institutional work” at the Foundation named after her, Casa Real, @CasaReal, said in a statement.\n\nFollowing the ex-king’s letter, the Zarzuela also released a statement from King Felipe relating \"heartfelt respect and gratitude\" to his father for his decision.\n\nInvestigation And Corruption Charges\n\nThe exile announcement comes three months after the Spanish supreme court launched an investigation to establish the former king’s involvement in a €6.7 billion deal with Saudi Arabia for the construction of a high-speed rail line between the Saudi cities of Medina and Mecca by a Spanish consortium.\n\nSpanish and Swiss anti-corruption officials are also investigating a number of accounts held in Switzerland by Juan Carlos and his alleged associates. “The enquire intends to define or discard the criminal relevance of events that occurred after June 2014, when Juan Carlos abdicated,” The Guardian explains.\n\nAfter his abdication in June 2014, Juan Carlos lost his immunity from prosecution. Recent reports in British, Swiss and Spanish press have increased the pressure on the royal family to avoid interference with the investigation.\n\n“Documents from the Swiss prosecutor allegedly show that the former king received a $100 million ‘donation’ from the king of Saudi Arabia that he put in an offshore account in 2008. Four years later, he allegedly gifted €65 million from the account to his former lover, Corinna Larsen,” The Guardian adds.\n\n“Not Evading Justice”\n\nThe Spanish government has said that \"justice is equal for all\" and it would \"not interfere\" in the inquiry.\n\nTo make clear that the ex-monarch’s departure “is not an attempt to evade the action of the justice system,” his lawyer, Javier Sánchez-Junco, published a note in which he assures that his client “remains at the disposal of the Public Prosecutor at all times for any procedure or action deemed appropriate’,” El Pais reported.\n\nThe former monarch won’t lose the honorary title of king, which was granted to him by a royal decree in June 2014, several days before his abdication.\n\n\"I have been King of Spain for 40 years and for all of them I have always wanted the best for Spain and for the Crown,\" concludes the farewell letter from King Juan Carlos I to his son, Felipe VI.\n\n\"With my loyalty as always. With my affection as always, your father. ”"
