        "text": "There has been many, many rumours about King Juan Carlos infidelities. I'll just drop by some names mentioned in the Spanish press about the king's mistresses. Of course, feel free to disbelieve it:\n\n- Marta Gay√°; This is the most talked about, She lives in Mallorca and supposedly is his longtime mistress.\n\n- Anne Igartiburu: Veeery beautiful tv presenter. Astonishingly beautiful. Her name was mentioned briefly, then she got married and no more rumours.\n\n- Barbara Rey: (No kidding) A third rate Spanish actress, her name has been mentioned several times, I don't know if it's true or not, but I can tell she enjoys a lot these rumours. Once her house was robbed and she implied the burglars were looking for some material that could be dangerous for some very important person in the country blah blah blah.\n\n- Nadiuska: A romanian actress based in Spain, hugely famous in the late 70s early 80s, in which she starred in many semiporn flicks. She used to be very beautiful, but now she's homeless, drug addict, psycologically damaged, a total wreck. Lives in the streets of Madrid from the charities of strangers. She appeared on tv some time ago saying something like she was involved with very important people and they are guilty of their situation now. Well, whatever. Maybe they had something when she was beautiful 25 years ago.\n\n- Sandra Mozarewsky: Another semiporn actress (the profile repeats itself). She commited suicide in 1977 when she was pregnant. Well do the math.\n\n- Carmen Cervera (the Baroness Thyssen herself). Some point the very borbonic features of her son Borja, whose father she has always refused to name. She was also a third rate actress in the 60s, etc, etc.\n\n- Olghina de Robillant: An italian noble, she was the kings lover when he was in his early 20s. They broke up when he got engaged to Sofia. Later on, she sold the love letters Juan Carlos sent him. She has a daughter she has implied (not openly) that is Juan Carlos'.\n\nThose are the ones I can remember. Of course feel free to believe whatever you want, you won't be wrong. I tend to believe Robillant's story, not the daughter's part. Marta Gaya has been mentioned several times. The rest is pure internet speculation (especially Carmen Cervera's son).\n\ntiaraprin said:\n\nI have heard many of these stories over the years and IMHO I think the majority of them are true. I don't think Juan Carlos ever really loved Sophia; he just made a dynastic marriage so one day his crown would be returned to him. I feel bad for Sophia, she has just been another royal woman who has had to put up with a philandering husband.\n\nI wonder how the King can look his cheating son-in-law Jaime de Marichalar in the face?? I wonder if he has scolded Jaime for his behavior??\n\nAnybody who watches JC and Sofia together can clearly see they have a very strong relationship, an infinite tenderness and admiration for each other. If that is love or not, I don't know, nor do any of us. But in my opinion, if JC has ever cheated Sofia that doesn't mean he didn't ever love her. To tell the truth, I can not imagine them together without loving each other. If a marriage goes through one (or many) crisis, it doesn't mean they are a fake couple, who had never fall in love for each other... it only means that they went through situations that are hard for any woman to bear (specially when you're married to the King and you can't ask for divorce, without losing your children), and it may also mean that JC is perhaps a typical Spanish D. Juan, a nice heartthrob whose fault is to like women more than perhaps he should. But I'm sure that, if some of those cheatings ever happened, JC and Sofia still have a very caring and strong relationship... perhaps a strange one, for most of us, but I'm sure they really love (whatever that means) each other.\n\nNow, regarding Jaime de Marichalar, I never heard anything about it...\n\nElsa M. said:\n\nAnybody who watches JC and Sofia together can clearly see they have a very strong relationship, an infinite tenderness and admiration for each other.

Maybe JC and Sofia don't 'love' each other the way we think love should be, but it's obvious they respect each other and have a good close relationship. I mean if we look at pictures of them together like, for example, the one below, we can see this. Also, as someone else has said, if JC had/has cheated, and you've been married as long as these 2 have, it must be hard for Sofia to feel such anger towards her husband as they've been through so much together. (But like we said, you never know what goes on in private)\n\nWell... there you go, I said it and now I'm out of breath\n\nAttachments\n\nj&s1.jpg\n\nMarengo said:\n\nWasn't there a woman seeking press attention a few years ago, who claimed to be the daughter of this couple & who said that she was adopted after birth?\n\nYes, a woman who lives in Paris, she insisted that JC would take a blood test to prove that he is her father. I don't think he did though.. This is all I could find on the net. I'm sure I once saw a photo of her but I can't find it anymore.\n\nhttp://www.nettyroyal.nl/newsmay02.html\n\nMay 28th 2002\n\nMarie-Jos√© de la Ruelle has lost her lawsuit against Princess Maria Gabriella of Italy at court in Bordeaux. Ms de la Ruelle claims to be the daughter of the princess and of King Juan Carlos of Spain.\n\nhttp://www.royalsportal.de/news/news2001-09.php\n\nSeptember 20 2001\n\n63-year-old SM Rey Juan Carlos de Espa√±a should be father of a 47-year-old French woman Marie-Jos√© de La Ruelle who went to court in Bordeaux. She said to the press that she is the daughter of the Spanish king and 61-year-old Principessa Maria Gabriella di Savoia, herself daughter of the last Italian king. According to La Ruelle her \"parents\" had an affair during a cruise aboard the \"Agamemnon\" in 1953. The court will decide about a motherhood test next spring. The complainant was born in 1954 as Brigitte-Odile Gervais in a military hospital in Blida, Algeria, and was adopted in 1955.

[dpa]\n\nAccording to this, JC and MG would have been 16 and 14, respectively when they had the child.\n\nI think Juan Carlos has always had an eye for beautiful women--which makes him pretty much like the majority of men! Whether or not he acts on it is anyone's guess. I do know Princess Diana told a friend she was very uncomfortable being around him on that last family holiday in Spain as he gave her a very costly watch and was a bit more touchy feely than she liked. I'll have to peruse my collection of Diana books (no small task.....) but that comment did stand out as I remember thinking that could be the reason she looked so uncomfortable there and returned saying she had had a lousy time. But, while I like Diana very much, she wasn't always accurate in her comments. And there are a lot of people who don't like people \"invading their space\" so that could've been the issue with her. As for the watch, she showed it to friends and it was a costly patek philippe, I believe, but he's wealthy and perhaps it was just meant as a gift for a visiting member of the British royal family, who enjoys a particularly close relationship with the Spanish royal family.\n\nThe rumors about Elena's husband are new--to me. I don't know quite what to make of them. I mean, he's been a sick man, having had a stroke..... It just sounds odd but who knows? Anything's possible, I guess."
