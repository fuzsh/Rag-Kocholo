        "text": "Spain has one of the most balanced royal families in recent times. King Felipe VI was introduced to his wife by a journalist friend at a dinner. He hosts many official events in Spain and participates in all events from different sectors and aspects of Spanish public life. He is a travel and sailing enthusiast and is known to connect with Spaniards from all walks of life.\n\nFelipe Juan Pablo Alfonso de Todos los Santos de Borbón y de Grecia, born on January 30, 1968, ascended the throne in 2014 after the abdication of his father, King Juan Carlos I. The king and his wife, Queen Letizia, from Spain have two daughters, the Princess of Asturias Leonor and the Infanta Sofia of Spain.\n\nHeir to the throne\n\nAlthough her two daughters, Leonor and Sofia, were born less than two years apart, Leonor, the eldest, is prepared to be the youngest heiress to the throne in Europe. Since Spain has not had a queen since 1868, this will be another turn that will guarantee the continued affection of the Spanish royal family with the public.\n\nTitles of Spanish royalty\n\nIn Spanish royalty, almost all women have been called Her Royal Highness the Infanta, a title dating back to the 1200s. Infanta Sofia, second in line to the Spanish throne, also received her name from her paternal grandmother, the queen Sofia.\n\nThe House of Borbón-Anjou is a modern monarchy, but originally it is a European royal house of French origin. Borbón (the French name of Bourbon) the kings ruled France for the first time in the 16th century, but in the 18th century they had thrones in Spain.\n\nZarzuela Palace\n\nLike many royal families who face the ever disapproving eye of the media, they have had to cut spending habits. They need the approval of their expense accounts by the Spanish Parliament, but they continue to live in the Zarzuela Palace, which is on the outskirts of Madrid, as in a fairy tale. Located on the hill of Monte El Pardo, the palace has been the official residence of the Spanish monarchs since 1975.\n\nOn the other hand, King Felipe has forbidden members of the royal family to accept extravagant gifts, since \"he would compromise the dignity of the Institution.\"\n\nLinks of interest\n\nYou may also be interested in the following resources::"
