        "text": "Before dawn on Friday, April 13, 2012, King Juan Carlos of Spain took a fall while on an elephant-hunting safari in Botswana and was immediately flown home to Madrid, where he underwent emergency hip-replacement surgery the next morning. Were it not for the injury, His Majesty’s African adventure would have no doubt remained a secret, as had almost everything to do with his private life since he took the throne, in 1975, upon the death of Generalissimo Francisco Franco, the long-ruling dictator who had arranged for the restoration of the monarchy. Instead, the 75-year-old King—long accustomed to stratospheric popularity ratings and deferential treatment from the press for his role in securing Spain’s democracy—was confronted with an avalanche of scathing criticism. “The spectacle of a monarch hunting elephants in Africa while the economic crisis in our country causes so many problems for Spaniards transmits an image of indifference and frivolity,” thundered El Mundo, Spain’s leading conservative newspaper. The country’s largest paper, El País, calculated that a luxury safari like the King’s would cost nearly $60,000 (including $15,000 for the permit and fees to kill an elephant)—twice the average annual salary in a country suffering through the worst depression in Europe after Greece’s.\n\nNearly every Spanish newspaper, TV channel, and online news site ran the now infamous photograph of Juan Carlos standing proudly in front of a dead elephant, which he had killed on a previous undisclosed big-game shoot. Compounding the embarrassment, four days before the King’s fall, his 13-year-old grandson—the son of his older daughter—had shot himself in the foot during target practice at one of the royal family’s country houses, and police were investigating the incident because in Spain the use of firearms by those under the age of 14 is illegal. This in turn had allowed the press to bring up a family tragedy that had occurred 56 years earlier, when Juan Carlos, then 18, accidentally shot and killed his 14-year-old brother, Alfonso.\n\nIt soon came out that the King’s hunting party had included Princess Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, a glamorous, 46-year-old, twice-divorced German businesswoman based in Monaco, and that she had flown with him on the plane of Mohamed Eyad Kayali, a Syrian-born Saudi deal-maker, who paid for the safari. Although Sayn-Wittgenstein denied any “improper relationship” with the King, it was reported that Queen Sofía, who had flown to Athens Friday, to spend Greek Orthodox Easter with her brother, former king Constantine, was informed of her husband’s fall upon her arrival there, and decided to stick to her plan to return to Madrid on Monday.\n\nThe first call for the King to step down in favor of his son, Crown Prince Felipe, came that weekend, when Tomás Gómez, Madrid’s regional Socialist Party leader, told the press, “The moment has arrived for the head of state to decide between his obligations and public responsibilities and an abdication that would allow him to enjoy a different life.” Such a suggestion would have been unheard of a week earlier, and it shocked most Spaniards. Three days later they were stunned again. Leaving the hospital on crutches, Juan Carlos addressed the waiting journalists and TV crews with a statement about the ill-timed safari. “I am very sorry,” he said. “I made a mistake. It won’t happen again.”\n\nFrom Bad to Worse\n\nUnfortunately for the King, the Botswana fiasco followed by only a few months another messy royal scandal. In November 2011, the Spanish people learned that Iñaki Urdangarín, the husband of the King’s younger daughter, Infanta Cristina, was under investigation for allegedly embezzling millions of euros from his nonprofit sports foundation, the Nóos Institute. A former Olympic handball champion, Urdangarín, who had been given the title Duque de Palma de Mallorca upon marrying Cristina, in 1997, denied all charges. Nevertheless, the royal household announced that Urdangarín would not participate in official family functions while under investigation, and in his annual Christmas address Juan Carlos made a point of stating, “Justice is for everyone.”\n\nOn December 28, the royal household published for the first time its earnings and expenses. In 2011, the King had received close to $400,000 from the state, almost evenly divided between salary and expenses; he paid 40 percent income tax on his salary. Crown Prince Felipe received nearly $200,000, and the royal women—Queen Sofía, the Infantas Elena and Cristina, and Felipe’s wife, Princess Letizia—shared some $500,000. The total budget for the royal household, including a staff of about 500, was approximately $11.34 million, a relatively modest sum compared with other European monarchies.\n\nYet questions remained as to how Juan Carlos had amassed a personal fortune said to be about $2 billion. And the royal lurch toward openness would prove futile as developments in the Nóos imbroglio threatened to ensnare the King, and as the press dug deeper into his private affairs. In February 2012, Urdangarín testified for the first time before Judge José Castro, the Majorca magistrate presiding over the Nóos case. He admitted under questioning that he had defied an order from his father-in-law in 2006 to disassociate himself entirely from the Nóos Institute. Though he resigned as president, he continued for two years to be involved in its activities. His testimony raised new questions concerning the King; for example, if he knew of shady business at Nóos, why didn’t he inform the authorities?\n\nMeanwhile, in a book titled The Solitude of the Queen, Spanish author Pilar Eyre called the King a serial womanizer and alleged that he had even made a pass at Princess Diana while she and Prince Charles were vacationing on King Constantine’s yacht with the Spanish and Greek royal families. Within weeks of the monarch’s apology for the Botswana safari, Spanish Vanity Fair caused a sensation by putting Sayn-Wittgenstein on the June 2012 cover as “The Mysterious Friend of the King.” Lourdes Garzon, the editor in chief, told me, “Everyone more or less knew about this woman, but it was impossible to find anything written about her. Because to write about the monarchy was the biggest taboo in our society.”\n\nThings just kept getting worse. The Palace announced that the King and Queen would not be celebrating their golden wedding anniversary. In February of this year, Diego Torres, Urdangarín’s former business partner, testified that the King’s son-in-law never made a move without Palace approval, and that his wife, Cristina, as an officer of the Nóos Institute, was involved in the running of it. To support his claims, Torres submitted more than 200 e-mails to the court. They revealed that, as early as June 2004, the King had asked Sayn-Wittgenstein to help Urdangarín find a new job, which suggested that her role in royal matters was even larger than suspected. When Urdangarín arrived at the Palma de Mallorca courthouse, he was taunted by protesters shouting, “Down with the monarchy! Down with corruption!” In sworn testimony he insisted, “The royal family did not give its opinion on, advise or authorize the activities of Nóos.” Several weeks later, however, Judge Castro subpoenaed Infanta Cristina—the first time in history that a member of the royal family had been ordered to appear in court.\n\nOn March 3, Juan Carlos returned to the hospital for back surgery, his fourth operation in less than a year. The previous week Sayn-Wittgenstein had given an interview to El Mundo. She told investigative reporter Ana Romero that she had met the King nine years earlier, at a shooting party at the Duke of Westminster’s estate in England, and that they had become “close friends.” She further confided that she had performed “sensitive and confidential” assignments for the Spanish government, adding, “These were specific classified matters and I helped for the good of the country.” On March 19, Reuters reported that Félix Sanz Roldán, the head of Spain’s National Intelligence Center, had been questioned by a parliamentary committee “probing whether Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein … had ever benefited from a Spanish security detail or received any payments from the state as a lobbyist for Spanish firms abroad.” In early April, El Mundo alleged that Juan Carlos had secreted in Swiss accounts millions of dollars that he had inherited from his father, Don Juan de Borbón, who had lived in exile during the Franco years (and would have been king had the Generalissimo not chosen his son as his successor instead).\n\nAll this was happening as increasingly harsh austerity measures imposed by the conservative government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and an epidemic of political-corruption scandals had Spaniards feeling beleaguered and angry. With Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands announcing her abdication in favor of her son in January, and an ailing Pope Benedict XVI resigning in February, the idea of an ill and embattled Juan Carlos giving up his throne suddenly seemed plausible. By mid-April, when I first traveled to Madrid to explore the situation for Vanity Fair, the King hadn’t been seen in public for six weeks, his approval rating had plummeted below 50 percent—both the Queen and Prince Felipe were polling higher—and talk of abdication had reached a fever pitch across all of Europe. SPAIN’S KING JUAN CARLOS IS ENGULFED IN SCANDAL, declared The Guardian of London. Germany’s Der Spiegel went further: IS IT TIME FOR SPAIN TO DISSOLVE THE MONARCHY?\n\nThe Defense Team\n\n‘If the King leaves, it would be a disaster. He’s the center of everything. It’s not only that we love him, we need him.” So said Doña Blanca Martinez de Irujo, a grande dame of the Spanish aristocracy, as she passed me a plate of finger sandwiches in her Madrid apartment. She and her sister, Doña Victoria, Marquesa de Tamarit, had agreed, reluctantly, to talk about Juan Carlos, who is both their friend and relative. “We have known him since he was a young boy in short pants,” said the marquesa.\n\nA full-length portrait of Queen Isabella II, the great-great-grandmother of Juan Carlos and the sisters, hung over the mantelpiece. The ladies’ mother was a princess of the Borbón dynasty, which has produced Spanish monarchs since 1700 and French kings from the 16th to the 19th century. Their grandfather the Count of Romanones was a prime minister under King Alfonso XIII, the last Borbón ruler before the monarchy was replaced, in 1931, by the Second Spanish Republic, which in turn was vanquished by Franco in the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39.\n\n“I think the best thing we have in Spain is the King,” continued the Marquesa de Tamarit. “We don’t have to criticize him. We—all of us who are not Communists—have to help him. He has done things, maybe, that people can think are not so good. But he’s a human being.”\n\nFormer king Simeon II of Bulgaria, who was exiled as a boy after the Communist takeover of his country, in 1946, more or less grew up with Juan Carlos after Spain granted his family asylum in 1951. He told me that abdication had suddenly become a buzzword, which he was not happy about. “One has to put the King’s whole life in context and not focus on things that are accidental or incidental and, finally, trivial,” he said. “And looking on the balance at what the monarchy itself and the King personally have contributed to Spain’s contemporary history, I would think it’s absurd to blow up these unpleasant situations. The definition of monarchy is a lifetime job. It’s a dedication. All of a sudden, because the King has had four operations in a row, he’s got to abdicate? Give me a break.”\n\nEven one of Juan Carlos’s toughest critics, Pedro J. Ramírez, the editor in chief of El Mundo, the paper that has been most aggressive in pursuing the royal scandals, had nice things to say about him. Ramírez told me of an exchange he had had with Juan Carlos in 1990, after being fired from his previous job as editor of Diario 16 because the King had complained to the owner about stories he didn’t like. “The King said, ‘I know you know that I told your boss to get rid of you. But I didn’t think he was going to be such an asshole as to accept my suggestion,’ ” Ramírez recalled. “I thought, O.K., this is Juan Carlos, a guy who always tries to be nice with everyone. I would not say he’s intelligent. He is shrewd like a fox. Well, now he is an old man with a lot of health problems and personal problems. But I think, on the whole, he has been a great king.”\n\nThat was clearly the consensus among Madrid’s political, media, and society circles. Laurence Debray, the author of an unauthorized French biography, Juan Carlos d’Espagne, called the King “a real political animal,” who deserved enormous credit for declining to become the absolute monarch Franco had set him up to be, and for refusing to go along with the attempted coup staged in his name by right-wing military officers in 1981. “That was the moment when he really won his crown,” she said. “To my mind, he is one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century.”\n\n“King Juan Carlos is really the founding father of Spanish democracy,” noted historian Charles Powell. “That’s why people feel this could have massive political consequences,” he added, referring to the King’s present predicament. “If this goes wrong for him, it isn’t just the head of state who’s in trouble; the whole political system will be called into question. Some people argue that it’s high time, that the model that was created in the 1970s is exhausted, that political institutions—including the monarchy itself—need to be revisited in a fundamental way.”\n\nOne afternoon in Madrid, I had drinks at the Ritz with Luis Venegas, the editor of the hip fashion magazine Candy, and his friend Leo Rydell Jost, a design student. “It’s true King Juan Carlos did many things to assure that democracy came to the country,” said Venegas, “but more than 30 years have passed since then.” Rydell Jost added, “With everything that has happened recently, you see the whole monarchy thing as a joke. Most people under 30 want a republic.”\n\nDetractors of the monarchy were generally reluctant to talk. One disillusioned baby-boomer royalist, however, had a lot to say: “This King has had the biggest red carpet in the world forever. No leader has ever gotten such an amount of protection, adoration, and schmoozing. And he took it all, went all the way with it. You cannot feel sorry for him. He did it to himself. He’s like a spoiled brat who has had everything, and one day it’s taken away.”\n\nThe King’s Lady Friend\n\n‘For the King it’s been like a bomb to his brain,” said the Condesa de Toreno, a prominent Madrid hostess. “Imagine, his illness and then this thing of—let’s call it la petite fiancée.” The condesa was obviously referring to Princess Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein.\n\nVirtually everyone I talked to for this article seemed to take it for granted that the King and Sayn-Wittgenstein have had a romantic relationship, but almost no one wanted to be quoted saying so. “They say the King is very much in love with her,” confided one of his American friends. “And I think he’s right to be, because she’s very beautiful.” A well-placed jet-setter was less kind: “She’s a bad-news girl. And he’s such an old fool. She knows exactly how to play him.”\n\nWhen Sayn-Wittgenstein learned that I was writing about her, she offered through a mutual friend to give me an interview. “I’m doing O.K.,” she told me at the start of our conversation in June. “I’m trying to ride out the storm.” In her rapid, straightforward English, she hardly sounded like the cunning femme fatale the press has made her out to be. (“She’s not a bimbo,” said a Spanish source. “If she was a bimbo, we wouldn’t have such a problem.”) I asked her when she had last been in Spain. “Not since December last year, and I’m not planning on going back, because that would not be very appropriate or very smart.” Does she keep in touch with the King? “Yes. We are close friends. Some people don’t understand that things can happen at a certain point in time, and then they end, but the friendship doesn’t end. He is now an elderly gentleman struggling with his health, and I think he needs all the support he can get. . . . People are expecting something big to happen, one way or the other. Nothing is going to happen, minus he can’t go hunting and I won’t go to Spain. He keeps in touch. He calls my children on a weekly basis to see how they’re doing. He behaves like you and I would behave with a friend.”\n\nWhen she met the King with the Duke of Westminster in 2004, she had recently broken with her second husband, Prince Casimir zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn, whom she had married four years earlier. (“His family was aghast,” said the jet-setter.) Her father, the Danish-born Finn Bonning Larsen, was the European director of Varig, the Brazilian national airline; her mother, Ingrid Sauer, was from Frankfurt, where Corinna was born on January 28, 1964. She told me that she grew up between Frankfurt and Rio de Janeiro and attended girls’ schools in Germany and Switzerland. After graduating from the University of Geneva, in 1987, she went to work for L’Oréal in Paris. That led to a job with Compagnie Générale des Eaux, the utilities-and-construction giant, she said, where she did public relations for the opening of La Grande Arche in La Défense, in Paris, an event attended by François Mitterrand, Margaret Thatcher, and Helmut Kohl. “And that’s largely what I do today. I manage relationships on a long-term basis between institutions, government institutions, or large corporate institutions.”\n\nShe met her first husband, Philip Adkins, a graduate of Columbia and Harvard, in Paris in 1989; they married the following year and set up house in London. They were divorced three years later, but they remain the closest of friends and business partners. In fact, Adkins was on the safari in Botswana, as was Corinna’s 10-year-old son from her marriage to Sayn-Wittgenstein. “I was in my tent with my son,” she told me. “My ex-husband was in his tent, and the King was in his tent. There was no hanky-panky.”\n\nCorinna’s relationship with the King apparently started on a professional basis, when he called and asked her to arrange the May 2004 honeymoon trip of Prince Felipe and Princess Letizia to Jordan, Thailand, and Fiji. She had been working the past four years at Boss & Co., the London bespoke gun-makers, organizing hunts for high-profile clients. According to Spanish Vanity Fair, she put together two safaris in Mozambique for the King, in 2004 and 2005, and on the first was “by his side all the time.” Since then, a royal insider said, she has been a regular guest on the partridge-shooting weekends Juan Carlos hosts every spring at his country estate, south of Madrid. According to that person, “The King is still in love with her.”\n\nBoris Izaguirre, a popular young TV personality in Madrid, recalled that the rumors about the King’s girlfriend started four or five years ago: “Apparently, Corinna took the manicurist that all the big Madrid ladies use on trips with the King, and people started asking, ‘Who is this German woman who travels with the King?’ Then came the stories about the house in the El Pardo palace compound. The King refurbished it, and people said that it was Corinna’s house, and that he was always there with her and her kids. It has two pools—one indoor—and subterranean parking. El Mundo published all of these things, and questions were asked in parliament about who paid for the refurbishment. The royal household replied that the house was used for foreign guests.”\n\nMore seriously, the press began to ask why Sayn-Wittgenstein—who left Boss & Co. in 2006 to start her own consulting firm, Apollonia Associates—accompanied the King on trips to foreign countries, including Germany, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. Suspicions were raised after the Botswana story broke, when El Mundo reported that Mohamed Eyad Kayali, the King and Corinna’s safari host, was the “right-hand man” of Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the Saudi defense minister, who had “fixed” the $9 billion deal for a consortium of Spanish companies to build the high-speed railway between Mecca and Medina.\n\n“In the Corinna affair, there are two aspects,” said Pedro Ramírez. “One is the personal relationship. I would say in Spain this is not important, that the King has a lover or a very close friend. What is embarrassing in the affair is the financial implications.” A few days before I interviewed Ramírez, his newspaper had linked Sayn-Wittgenstein to the Saudi-Spanish Infrastructure Fund, which had been dedicated at the El Pardo palace in 2007 by King Juan Carlos and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. “Spanish companies committed $200 million, but the fund collapsed when the Saudis didn’t come through with their $800 million,” Ramírez explained. “The only money spent was $15 million, which went to the fund managers, Cheyne Capital, who were friends of Corinna, who got close to $5 million.”\n\nWhen I asked Sayn-Wittgenstein about the extent of her involvement in the King’s official business, she responded firmly, “I have never done business for the King, or collected any money on his behalf… Business in Spain has been conducted for the last 30 or 40 years in a particular manner… Whenever there are large deals for Spanish companies in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, or Latin America, the person that politicians and the business community call is the King, and he makes the calls.”\n\nShe said that she had had “absolutely nothing to do” with the Saudi high-speed train deal, that Shahpari Khashoggi, the third ex-wife of Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, “was the agent for the Spanish side on that.” She also told me, “Yes, I was involved in the Saudi-Spanish Infrastructure Fund, and I was paid, because I worked for two years giving advice to the fund manager.” She concluded, “My message is I don’t have an agenda, other than huge respect for the King and Prince Felipe.” Had she met the Queen? “I bumped into her once, accidentally.”\n\nA Tough Life\n\nAll requests for interviews with the royal family were being declined, but the King authorized his friend Pepe Fanjul, the Cuban-American sugar baron, to speak to me on his behalf. “The King and I became very good friends back in the 60s, when he was still Prince,” said Fanjul. “He is certainly one of the most charismatic individuals I’ve ever met. He’s a people person, like Ronald Reagan. Without a doubt he has been Spain’s No. 1 ambassador to the world, and he has gotten huge contracts for Spain.”\n\nFanjul told me that he had met Corinna and Casimir zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn shortly after they were married, and that he had come to know her over the years. “We have mutual social friends, and she was involved in the shooting world. I’ve shot with her in different parts of the world. She’s a brilliant, hardworking businesswoman. The King feels it would be unfair if her business were ruined, as she’s really an innocent bystander. He considers her to be a dear and loyal friend, who has always been very respectful to the royal family.” He added, “People think the King has had a charmed life. I would say it’s one of the hardest lives of anybody I know.”\n\nJuan Carlos Alfonso Víctor María de Borbón y Borbón-Dos Sicilias was born on January 5, 1938, the second of four children, to Don Juan de Borbón and Princess María de las Mercedes de Borbón-Dos Sicilias. He is a direct descendant of King Louis XIV of France from both of his parents, and of England’s Queen Victoria through his father. The royal family was living in exile in Rome during the Spanish Civil War, but they left Mussolini’s Italy for neutral Switzerland in 1942. When Juan Carlos was eight, his parents settled in Estoril, Portugal, leaving him behind at a boarding school for boys run by Marian fathers. “I was really very miserable,” he later said.\n\nIn November 1948, according to Paul Preston’s biography Juan Carlos: Steering Spain from Dictatorship to Democracy, a “tearful ten-year-old Juan Carlos was waved off by his tight-lipped parents” as he boarded an overnight train from Portugal to Spain, where, for the next 27 years, every aspect of his existence would be overseen by Franco. For Don Juan, delivering his son to the dictator was the only way to keep alive the hopes of a Borbón restoration, but for Juan Carlos it meant becoming something between a pawn and a hostage. He was sequestered at a country estate near Madrid, where a private school was set up for him and eight boys from the aristocracy and rich right-wing families. In 1950 the school was relocated to a former royal palace in San Sebastian, where Juan Carlos’s brother, Alfonso, and eight boys of his age joined the student body. In 1955, Juan Carlos, then 17, was moved to Madrid to prepare for the Military Academy of Zaragoza. He lived in the Duke de Montellano’s mansion, under the watchful eyes of a general, a major, and a priest from the Opus Dei, the conservative Catholic movement.\n\n“He was not allowed to go out to anything, not even to the theater,” said Doña Blanca Martinez de Irujo, adding that occasionally his riding instructor “would help him escape” for half an hour to see a girl. Her sister, Doña Victoria, volunteered, “He always loved girls, our King, and he loved dancing, especially the waltz.”\n\nOn Holy Thursday 1956, while on Easter vacation in Estoril, Juan Carlos and Alfonso were playing around with a gun in the game room of their parents’ villa. What happened next is not clear, but it resulted in Alfonso’s death. The following day the Spanish Embassy in Lisbon, at Franco’s direction, released an ambiguous statement: “Whilst his Highness the Infante Alfonso was cleaning a revolver with his brother, a shot was fired hitting his forehead and killing him in a few minutes.” Subsequent comments, however, from the boys’ mother, Doña María, her dressmaker, and a family friend, suggested that Juan Carlos had been holding the gun, which he thought was not loaded. The King has never denied his responsibility or offered an explanation, but as Reinaldo Herrera, a Vanity Fair contributing editor and a longtime acquaintance of his, said, “It marked him for life.”\n\nThe following summer Juan Carlos graduated from Zaragoza, and then spent a year each at the national naval and air-force academies. In 1960 he entered the Complutense University of Madrid, where he studied law, economics, and taxation. Franco’s wife, Doña Carmen Polo, personally decorated his new residence, the Palacio de la Zarzuela, a hunting lodge built in the 17th century for King Philip IV. “It’s a palace in name only,” noted Pepe Fanjul of the 20-room villa, where King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofía live to this day.\n\nThey were married on May 14, 1962, in Athens, first in a Catholic cathedral, then in a Greek Orthodox ceremony (she would later convert to Catholicism). The wedding was attended by more than 150 members of 27 royal houses. “It was a marriage of convenience, and it was largely Queen Frederica’s doing,” one friend of the royals told me, referring to Sofía’s mother. But Paul Preston, among others, believes the couple were in love, at least initially. Their three children, Infanta Elena, Infanta Cristina, and Prince Felipe, were born over the next six years. Most importantly, Franco gave his stamp of approval to the prim and deferential Sofía. On July 22, 1969, Franco officially designated Juan Carlos as his successor, and the Prince swore fealty to the Fundamental Principles of the National Movement, the sole political party under the dictatorship.\n\nThe Enlightened Monarch\n\nKing Juan Carlos began his reign in 1975 in the most modest way possible. There was no elaborate coronation, only a high mass. He and his family remained at La Zarzuela rather than move into the 2,800-room Royal Palace. And they eschewed the traditional trappings of a court. In all of this Juan Carlos had the support and encouragement of his wife, who had seen her brother, King Constantine, driven into exile in 1967.\n\n“I think one of the cleverest things Juan Carlos did was to avoid the old aristocracy,” said Charles Powell. “They thought, Oh, great, our time is back. But Juan Carlos realized these people were the kiss of death. They had been largely responsible for the crash of the monarchy in 1931. They had isolated Alfonso XIII from public opinion, from the political elite, and from the intellectual world.”\n\nIn any event, nobody thought Juan would reign for very long. To everyone’s amazement, however, the King took charge. Within months of his coronation he appointed Adolfo Suárez, one of the few moderate officials of the National Movement, as prime minister. In 1977, Juan Carlos outraged Francoist loyalists by supporting the legalization of the Socialist and Communist parties.\n\nMost significantly, he was instrumental in the writing of a new constitution to replace the one left by Franco, which envisioned an extension of the authoritarian system in the guise of an absolute monarchy. Generally referred to as Spain’s Magna Carta, the 1978 constitution was overwhelmingly approved by the Spanish people in a referendum. King Simeon II recalled visiting Juan Carlos while the new document was still being written. “In his room he had a whole lot of pages strewn on the table and even on the bed. I said, ‘What on earth is this?’ He told me, ‘This is the draft of the constitution.’ I noticed there were a lot of cross-outs—literally paragraphs. He said, ‘These are the prerogatives I have.’ And I said, ‘But you are striking all these prerogatives out?’ And he said, ‘Yes, I don’t see why I should have so many powers.’ ”\n\nOn February 23, 1981, 200 armed officers of the Guardia Civil, or federal police, led by Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Tejero, seized control of the lower house of the Spanish parliament. Almost at the same time, Lieutenant General Jaime Miláns del Bosch, a die-hard Francoist, sent tanks into the streets of Valencia. The rebels announced that they were acting in support of the King, but early the next morning he went on national TV and denounced them, declaring, “The crown, symbol of the permanence and unity of the fatherland, cannot tolerate actions or attitudes by those who aim to interrupt by force the democratic process.” Three days later, three million people marched through Spain’s cities in support of democracy and the King.\n\nThe following year, Spain elected 40-year-old Felipe González, the son of a livestock handler from Seville, as its first Socialist head of government since the Civil War. He would be re-elected twice, and over the next 14 years he and Juan Carlos would form what Charles Powell called “the most fruitful political partnership in 20th-century Spain.” By 1986 the country had joined both the European Economic Community and NATO. The González government gave the country free universal education, a social-security system, and new infrastructure. The economy took off, and terrorist attacks by the Basque-separatist group ETA were temporarily reduced. All this reflected well on Juan Carlos, who came to be seen as an enlightened monarch with a common touch.\n\nToday, González is still one of the King’s most fervent admirers. “[King Juan Carlos] has decisively represented and protected Spanish interests for nearly four decades now,” he wrote in an e-mail statement. “I have frequently said, even having republican roots, I believe the role of the monarchy to be vital for Spain.”\n\nIn a surprising turnaround, it is now Queen Sofía whom the Spanish people seem to love. “Wherever she goes, people stand up and applaud for minutes on end,” said Charles Powell. It wasn’t always that way. Indeed, until Corinna became a household name, the consensus was that Sofía was cold, distant, too Germanic—like her mother, Queen Frederica, the granddaughter of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Prussia. “She hates bullfighting, she hates soccer, she hates flamenco,” complained one Madrid socialite.\n\nPeople admire her for stoically enduring her husband’s affairs, some allegedly having lasted for years. For all intents and purposes, the King and Queen lead separate lives. Sofía is said to spend weeks at a time in London, visiting King Constantine and Queen Anne-Marie, and she frequently flies to Paris to see her favorite cousin, Princess Tatiana Radziwill. Close friends said that the King grew tired of playing host to the former Greek royals for two months every summer in Majorca. Sofía’s spinster sister, Princess Irene, has lived at La Zarzuela since the death of their mother, in 1981. “He fled to get away from his in-laws,” said one male friend.\n\nFew can find fault with the Queen’s tireless promotion of worthy causes, from fighting drug addiction at home to combating sex trafficking in Cambodia. She shows up at almost every opening of her namesake Reina Sofía art museum and, according to Charles Powell, “she has an ongoing seminar program. She will invite academics to serious debate, at Zarzuela, about the Arab Spring, for example. She loves classical music. The King is tone-deaf.” Powell added, “I think she’s incredibly brave and resilient, and very lonely, I would imagine.”\n\nMany among the old aristocracy have never forgiven the Queen for not encouraging marriages between her children and theirs. One royal-family friend said, “She’s been very weak with the children. None of them married correctly. There’s a law in Spain called the Edict of Carlos III, which forbids the royal family from marrying outside of royal families. If they do, they lose their succession rights. For some reason, it seems to have been forgotten.”\n\nThe Infantas and Their Spouses\n\nInfanta Elena was the first to marry, in 1995, to Jaime de Marichalar, a member of the minor nobility from Soria, who thereupon became the Duke of Lugo. Marichalar had studied economics, but his real interest was fashion. “He started dressing her up, to the point where she was competing with Caroline of Monaco as the most elegant princess in Europe,” said Boris Izaguirre. Jaime himself was quite the dandy with his slicked-back hair, fur coats, and stacks of bracelets. According to Antonio Camuñas, a Madrid corporate consultant who knows the royal family well, “The guy would ride his Segway down Avenida Serrano, where all the fancy shops are, with his bodyguards running after him, which people saw as extravagant.” Yet the couple seemed happy and produced a boy and girl, in 1998 and 2000, respectively. But things were never the same after Jaime suffered a stroke. In 2009 the couple ended their marriage, making Elena the first child of a reigning Spanish monarch to divorce. Marichalar lost his royal title. “He became a black sheep,” said Izaguirre. However, as scandal enveloped his former brother-in-law, Iñaki Urdangarín, Jaime came to be seen in a more favorable light.\n\nInfanta Cristina and Urdangarín met at the 1996 Summer Olympics, in Atlanta, where he was competing as a member of the Spanish handball team. They married in 1997 and had four children over the next eight years. The son of a wealthy Basque businessman and a Belgian mother, Urdangarín grew up in Barcelona, where he and Cristina settled after their marriage. The Queen was said to be very fond of the young sportsman. “We all loved Iñaki,” said Antonio Camuñas, “because he seemed so perfect and very normal. Iñaki always made Infanta Cristina very happy. He’s a great father. He cooks. He takes care of all the help.”\n\nUrdangarín retired from professional handball after the 2000 Summer Olympics, having earned a degree from Barcelona’s elite Escuela Superior de Administración y Dirección de Empresas (ESADE). That was where he met Diego Torres, an associate professor in the school’s department of policy and business. In 1999, Torres founded a consulting firm, the Institute of Applied Investigations, which Urdangarín joined in 2003, whereupon it was reconstituted as a nonprofit foundation and renamed the Nóos Institute (nous being the Greek word for “mind”). Urdangarín was president and Torres vice president, and they were joined on the five-member board by Cristina, her royal secretary, Carlos García Revenga, and Miguel Tejeiro, a relative of Torres’s wife, Ana María Tejeiro, who was employed as an executive, as was her brother, Marco Antonio Tejeiro. The foundation quickly established lucrative relationships with the provincial governments of the Balearic Islands and Valencia, which between 2004 and 2006 awarded Nóos no-bid contracts reportedly worth more than $7 million, to produce annual sports and tourism “summits.”\n\nProvincial politicians may have been eager to do business with a member of the royal family, but the foundation’s overnight success apparently caused unease inside the palace. By late 2004, Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, acting on the King’s request to find a new job for his son-in-law, had secured what she thought was the perfect position: president of the new Spanish branch of the multinational Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, which provides outreach programs for needy children and presents annual awards to prominent athletes. “They are like the Oscars for sports,” Sayn-Wittgenstein told me, explaining that Laureus is supported by the Richemont luxury-goods group and Mercedes-Benz. Urdangarín’s salary for the part-time job would have started at $66,000, but he could have earned up to $260,000 as additional corporate sponsors came aboard, according to e-mails leaked to the press. “I was surprised when Iñaki turned it down,” Sayn-Wittgenstein said.\n\n‘The whole thing started going wrong in 2005,” said Boris Izaguirre. “Iñaki and Cristina bought a house in the best part of Barcelona, Pedralbes, for $8 million, and people started asking how they could afford it.” They left the Nóos board in 2006, along with Carlos García Revenga. That same year El Mundo ran its first investigative piece about dubious financial transactions at the foundation. In 2009 the couple moved to Washington, D.C., where Urdangarín worked for the international subsidiary of Telefónica, the Spanish telecommunications monopoly. They returned to Spain after the scandal broke, when—as a friend put it—“they were molested by a TV crew in the Whole Foods Market in Georgetown.”\n\nAccording to Spain’s Anticorruption Bureau, Urdangarín and Torres were under investigation for suspected misappropriation of public funds, falsification of official documents, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud. Documents were leaked suggesting that Nóos grossly over-billed the Valencia and Balearic Islands governments and diverted the excess sums it collected to tax havens in Belize, Luxembourg, and Andorra. According to The New York Times, some of this public money was alleged to have gone to “a real estate firm jointly operated by Mr. Urdangarín and his wife.” This past February, Diego Torres, embittered by the royal family’s attempts to place most of the blame on him, testified that, even after leaving the board, Urdangarín continued to make the majority of decisions at Nóos. In the same hearings, Revenga, the foundation’s former treasurer, testified that his role and Cristina’s were largely symbolic. But some of the e-mails that Torres had released seemed to indicate that Revenga had helped organize business meetings for Nóos. And Torres announced that he had dozens more e-mails, which, he alleged, showed that the King tried to help Urdangarín land big contracts. Both Urdangarín and Torres have denied wrongdoing. In July, Urdangarín filed suit against Torres concerning the authenticity of the e-mails.\n\nInfanta Cristina was due to appear in Judge Castro’s court in late April, but Pedro Horrach, the anti-corruption prosecutor, argued that there was insufficient evidence to link her directly to the alleged fraud at Nóos, and her appearance was postponed. In May a higher court suspended the subpoena. Judge Castro then announced that he would investigate whether Cristina had engaged in tax evasion or money-laundering.\n\nThis spring Urdangarín thought he had a job in Qatar as assistant coach to its new handball team, but it fell through amid speculation that the King had personally arranged it with the Emir of Qatar to get his son-in-law out of the country for a while. The Palace denied that, saying phone conversations between the two monarchs at the time had been about trade relations. “It’s too bad, because my cousin Cristina and Iñaki barely have an income, as he can’t get a job in Spain,” said Prince Pavlos of Greece. “They’re living in the middle of total chaos in Barcelona, hounded by journalists and photographers. And it isn’t even a proper case—just an investigation to create a case. I think if Iñaki has done something wrong he was misguided.”\n\nIn August, Infanta Cristina and the couple’s four children moved to Geneva, where her longtime employer, Caixa Foundation, transferred her to coordinate its social-welfare program with United Nations agencies based there. Urdangarín will make visits to Switzerland while remaining in Barcelona to sell their house and deal with his legal problems. According to knowledgeable sources, Urdangarín may be indicted in September, which will no doubt bring about another barrage of daunting headlines for the royal family.\n\nThe Crown Prince and His Wife\n\nAll eyes are now on 45-year-old Crown Prince Felipe and the woman he fell in love with while watching her recite the news on TV, his wife, Princess Letizia. His Royal Highness and Ms. Ortiz Rocasolano were married on May 22, 2004, in the biggest royal wedding since that of Prince Charles and Diana, in 1981. Letizia became the first commoner in Spanish history to be in line to be Queen, and the first in that position to have been divorced. The King, apparently, was not very happy with his son’s choice. According to a member of another European royal family, “Felipe went to his father to ask permission to marry Letizia with a letter renouncing his right to the throne in his pocket. And when his father suggested that he wait a year or so to make sure that she really was the right girl, he handed him the letter. Juan Carlos asked Sofía what they should do. She told him, ‘You have no choice. If you don’t acquiesce, it will be the end of the monarchy.’ ”\n\nLetizia Ortiz Rocasolano was born in Oviedo, in northern Spain, on September 15, 1972, and raised in a liberal, secular, middle-class environment. Her father is a journalist. Her mother is a registered nurse and hospital-union organizer whose father was a taxi driver and whose mother is half Filipino. Letizia’s parents divorced in 1999.\n\nWhen Letizia was 25, she married Alonso Guerrero, a professor and author. After earning a journalism degree from the Complutense University of Madrid and a master’s from the Institute for Audiovisual Journalism Studies, she went to work at a newspaper in Mexico. Upon returning to Spain, she rapidly rose to the position of anchorwoman at TVE, the state-owned network. She covered the 2000 presidential election from Washington, broadcast live from Ground Zero following 9/11, and reported from Iraq in the wake of the American invasion.\n\n“Some aristocrats were outraged when Felipe married Letizia,” said a royal observer. “They make fun of her behind her back, but they won’t say it publicly, because they’re monarchists. Letizia knows it, and she can’t stand them. I think she’s in a difficult situation. She is a nervous person, worried, uptight, very tense and intense.”\n\nThe crown couple’s first child, Infanta Leonor, born in 2005, is second in line to the throne. Their second daughter, Infanta Sofía, followed in 2007. The family lives in a large house next door to La Zarzuela that was built for Felipe before his marriage. According to a royal insider, “Theirs is obviously not an easy relationship. She is desperately trying to prove that she is a person in her own right. For example, they rarely show up together. She will normally come later, and they will leave separately. Sometimes it’s a bit awkward. But the look on his face when she behaves like that is of deep affection. He is very protective of her.”\n\n‘I personally believed that it would have been better if Prince Felipe had married a royal princess,” said Ramón Pérez-Maura, the assistant editor of ABC, the monarchist daily. “Having said that, and having seen Princess Letizia act over the last nine years, I think she’s done a fantastic job. She’s helped Prince Felipe meet groups of society he wasn’t familiar with, such as people in the media. And I like the fact that when they got married they started their honeymoon trip around Spain in a car, which nobody knew they were going to do. That was something that came out of her. And that’s brilliant.”\n\nPérez-Maura observed of Felipe, “He’s more like his mother than his father. He doesn’t have the warmth, the charm, that his father has. He never tries to be the center of attention, which the King, in his way, does.”\n\n“Prince Felipe is perhaps the best-prepared man of his generation in Spain,” said Antonio Camuñas, citing an education that took him from boarding school in Canada, through the Autónoma University of Madrid, Spain’s three military academies, and Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service.\n\nCarlos García-Calvo, *El Mundo’*s fashion and society editor, is equally high on Princess Letizia, although he thought it was a joke when a friend told him that Felipe was marrying an anchorwoman. “Well, he did what all the other crown princes in Europe are doing—marrying commoners. I now think he did the right thing. I think she’s great. She’s witty and very endearing.”\n\nThe controversial Letizia has made some enemies. A book by her cousin David Rocasolano made headlines in April with its claim that she had had a secret abortion before she met Felipe. (Her supporters vehemently disputed this account, viewing it as an act of treason.) According to another book published earlier this year, Urdangarín, a Hustler in the Court of the King, Letizia’s embattled brother-in-law blames his troubles on her. “She wanted to shine and leaked documents to the press to reveal Urdangarín’s bad moves,” wrote Eduardo Inda and Esteban Urreiztieta, who also alleged that Iñaki and Cristina “resented that they were treated differently at the palace in comparison” with Felipe and Letizia.\n\n“The most important thing about Felipe and Letizia is that they are not linked in any way to any kind of corruption,” said Laurence Debray. “They were ambitious enough to stay away from it all. They cut off any relationship they had with Iñaki and Cristina. Felipe’s a good family man. He doesn’t have mistresses. He doesn’t go hunting. He’s very modern. The younger generation doesn’t care about Franco, or the Civil War, or the coup. For them, most of the royal family seems corrupt. They don’t work, and they have plenty of money. So Felipe is looking better every day, and so is Letizia.”\n\nThe Royal Road Ahead\n\nFor the King, the most damning rumor is that Queen Sofía would prefer to see Prince Felipe take the throne sooner rather than later. According to the Queen’s friend Covadonga O’Shea, a conservative writer, “She gets along very well with Letizia. And I think Letizia is very close to the Queen.” Others say the Princess can’t wait to be Queen. “She is expecting it every day,” said an editor in the know.\n\nBy this past January, support for the monarchy had fallen to a historic low of 54 percent. In February a Palace official was compelled to tell the press that Juan Carlos had no plans to abdicate, and that no plan existed to fast-track the succession of Felipe. The following month a new poll showed that an astounding 85.9 percent of Spaniards felt Prince Felipe was well prepared to assume the throne.\n\nEven when Juan Carlos tried to do something right, it seemed to turn out wrong. In May the royal household announced that the King, “for austerity reasons,” was going to turn over to the government his $27 million, 136-foot yacht, Fortuna (each refueling of which reportedly costs more than $30,000). “The National Heritage board must now approve the transfer to the government,” announced a spokesman for that institution, “which could decide to keep it or sell it.” There was only one problem: the group of Majorca businesspeople—operating as the Tourism and Cultural Foundation of the Balearic Islands—who had given the King the boat 13 years ago to replace a previous yacht given to him by the late Saudi King Fahd, wanted it back. The matter has still not been resolved.\n\nFor the most part, Spain’s political and media establishments would prefer that the King stay, fearing a shock to the system were he to leave while the nation is in such dire straits. “We are very clear against abdication,” said Pedro Ramírez. “You ask for the resignation of the minister of health or foreign affairs if he has done something wrong. But you don’t ask for the abdication of the King, just because he has been out of the country on a weekend in Botswana with a blonde woman. El Mundo is saying the only two scenarios in which we would ask for abdication would be, first, if he has a serious health problem—mainly mental incapacity. And, second, if there were not circumstantial evidence but real proof of wrongdoing.”\n\nPepe Fanjul told me, “Abdication is not going to happen. Felipe is a wonderful and very well-prepared young man, but everything has its time and place. And I think it’s still King Juan Carlos’s time.” Fanjul said the King’s days were now “half work, half rehabilitation. He’s off pain medication. He’s putting the past behind him and looking forward to the future.” In mid-July, Juan Carlos made his first trip outside Spain since his hip operation, to Morocco for a three-day state visit to King Mohammed VI. He arrived in Rabat walking with two canes.\n\nAs Vanity Fair went to press, friends of the King stepped forward with declarations of support. The Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, who meets up with Juan Carlos at international soccer matches, called to pass along Vladimir Putin’s high regard for the King and to praise “a very special human quality he has—he gives you his unconditional attention and consideration. I can tell you, not every head of state does that.” Even Bill Clinton, in an e-mail, weighed in on whether Juan Carlos should go or stay: “This is the King’s decision. We have been friends for more than two decades. I believe that he will do what he thinks is best for the people of Spain and that, whatever he does, he will find a way to be of public service. I also know that his son is able, patriotic, and has been well prepared by his parents.”"
