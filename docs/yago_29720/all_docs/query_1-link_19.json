        "text": "Juan Carlos is paying his respects to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe exiled ex-King of Spain, 84, attended the monarch's funeral Sept. 19 alongside his son, reigning monarch King Felipe VI, and Felipe's wife Queen Letizia. The outing marked the first time Juan Carlos has been seen in public alongside his family since his self-imposed exile began two years ago. Privately, he reunited with them in May of this year.\n\nAfter nearly 40 years in power, Juan Carlos stepped down from the monarchy in 2014 after a series of scandals—including a corruption investigation involving his daughter Princess Cristina's husband Iñaki Urdangarín and a controversial elephant hunting trip he took during Spain's financial crisis. In 2020, he left the country for Abu Dhabi when he was accused of having improper ties to business deals in Saudi Arabia, though all three charges against him have since been dropped due to lack of evidence."
