        "text": "Considering Australia is a part of the Commonwealth, it’s understandable that most of us immediately think of the British royal family when we hear the word ‘royals’.\n\nBut, obviously, there are many royal families in existence around the world. The Danish royal family, for instance. Not to mention the Spanish royal family…\n\nIf you’re not super familiar with the latter, never fear!\n\nRead on to learn everything you need to know about the Spanish royals.\n\nWho are the Spanish royal family members?\n\nThe current Spanish royal family is made up of:\n\nKing Felipe VI\n\nFelipe is the third and only son of King Juan Carlos I. He became King of Spain in 2014 when Juan Carlos abdicated the throne.\n\nQueen Letizia\n\nLetizia Ortiz Rocasolano worked as a journalist before she married into royalty. Most notably, she was a news anchor at CNN+ and Televisión Española.\n\nIn 2004, she married Felipe, the then-Prince of Asturias. Her marriage made her the Princess of Asturias, and now that her husband is King, she is Queen of Spain.\n\nLeonor, Princess of Asturias\n\nPrincess Leonor is the eldest child of Felipe and Letizia. She was born on October 31, 2005 and became the heir apparent when her father ascended the throne in 2014.\n\nInfanta Sofía\n\nInfanta Sofía is the youngest child of Felipe and Letizia. She was born on April 29, 2007.\n\nKing Juan Carlos I\n\nJuan Carlos is the former King of Spain. He became king in 1975 following the death of General Franco (former Caudillo of Spain) and reigned right up until 2014, when he chose to abdicate the throne.\n\nQueen Sofia\n\nSofia was born Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark to King Paul and Queen Frederica of Greece. In 1962, she married Juan Carlos and, upon his accession, became Queen of Spain in 1975.\n\nWhat are Spanish royals called?\n\nThe King (el Rey in Spanish) and Queen (la Reina in Spanish) are the occupants of the Spanish throne. They can also be called His Majesty and Her Majesty.\n\nThe King’s heir apparent bears the title of Prince or Princess of Asturias.\n\nAny other children of the monarch bear the title Infante or Infanta. The children of the Prince or Princess of Asturias also bear the title Infante or Infanta.\n\nAny children an Infante or Infanta have have the rank – but not the title – of Grandee, an official aristocratic title conferred on some Spanish nobility.\n\nWho is the most popular Spanish royal?\n\nPeople love a princess. Just look at Princess Catherine; crowds adore her.\n\nTherefore, it’s not super surprising that Princess Leonor has many fans.\n\nThe eldest daughter of King Felipe, and the heir apparent to the Spanish throne, is extremely popular both in Spain and abroad.\n\nAre the Spanish royals related to the British royal family?\n\nYes, albeit distantly.\n\nJuan Carlos and Sophia are great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria of England. And the late Queen Elizabeth II and the late Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh were also great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria of England.\n\nMeaning Juan Carlos, Sophia, Elizabeth and Philip are all third cousins.\n\nThe families have a close relationship; reportedly, Felipe, called the late Queen Elizabeth II (and his third cousin once removed) ‘Auntie Lillibet’."
