        "text": "His attendance, alongside his son Felipe, has caused some controversy. Here's what you need to know.\n\nWho are the two kings?\n\nSpain's official delegation is led by King Felipe VI, 54, and his wife Queen Letizia, 50.\n\nJuan Carlos I, 84, the former king, was related to Queen Elizabeth as they were both great-great-grandchildren of Britain's Queen Victoria.\n\nKing Felipe VI came to the throne when his father abdicated in 2014 amid a series of scandals.\n\nWhy did the former king abdicate, and why is he seen as a disgraced figure?\n\nOnce revered for his role in Spain's transition to democracy, the popularity of Juan Carlos fell drastically amid financial scandals, affairs, and public disgust at an expensive elephant-hunting trip in Botswana in 2014 while the country was suffering a recession.\n\nHe fled Spain in 2020 as Spanish prosecutors investigated allegations of fraud in Spain and Switzerland during the latter years of his reign (1975 - 2014), but the probe was dropped due to insufficient evidence and the statute of limitations. Juan Carlos has declined to comment on the various allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nHe is also awaiting trial in Britain in a harassment case brought against him by his former lover, Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein. He has denied the allegations.\n\nWhy is it controversial that the former king is attending?\n\nWhen he stepped down from the throne, polling showed some two-thirds of the Spanish public wanted him to abdicate the throne, so clearly, he wasn't a very popular figure.\n\nHe has since moved to Abu Dhabi where he has lived in self-imposed exile, though he returned to Spain for a visit earlier this year.\n\nSpanish outlet, El Debate, has reported that the former king was privately contacted by the Spanish government and asked not to attend the funeral service today after learning he had been personally invited by the British monarchy.\n\nIt's the first time the king has attended an official royal event since 2014."
