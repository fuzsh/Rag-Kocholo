        "text": "Juan Carlos I of Spain, the country’s king until his abdication in 2014, was supposed to go down in the history books as a hero. Ascending to the throne in 1975 as the appointed successor to dictator Francisco Franco, Juan Carlos at first had the ability to select political leaders without holding elections. Eventually he let go of those autocratic powers and helped guide the country toward democracy, becoming a historical oddity: The rare person in power who wanted less to do.\n\nBut in 1981, when he defended the fledgling democracy against a well-organized military coup, he became something more like a living legend. By outsmarting a group of military leaders who had taken the country’s parliamentarians at gunpoint, he helped to establish Spain as a country that could deliver peace and prosperity to citizens who had long been deprived of it.\n\nIn 1992—the year Spain celebrated its political and economic transformation by hosting the Summer Olympics—Vanity Fair spoke to a source who was at the palace with Juan Carlos that night. The source said that the event had only strengthened his bond with his country. “The king was born in exile,” he said. “He is determined to die in Spain.”\n\nOn Monday, the Casa Real made an announcement that showed just how much things had changed in the 28 years since Barcelona 1992. Juan Carlos wrote a letter to his son, King Felipe VI, saying that he would be leaving the country due to “the public repercussions that certain past events in [his] private life are generating.” Later reports speculated that he had either gone to Portugal, where his father, Don Juan de Borbón, lived in exile for part of his life, or to the Dominican Republic, which he has visited multiple times. It’s a sign that the figurehead of Spanish democracy understands that he has endangered his legacy—and the monarchy itself.\n\nThe simple explanation for Juan Carlos’s apparent self-exile has to do with an investigation into his ties with Saudi Arabia. In March, reports alleged that the former king got a kickback when Spanish companies secured a contract to build a rail line from Mecca to Medina, and the Spanish Supreme Court launched a probe in June. According to the New York Times, it specifically deals with his connection to two overseas foundations, one based in Liechtenstein, which was set up by his cousin, and the other based in Panama, which took in a $100 million “donation” from the king of Saudi Arabia in 2008.\n\nYet the development is also just the next beat in a scandal which lasted more than a decade. His reputation began to suffer in 2011 when financial impropriety embroiled his daughter Princess Cristina and son-in-law Iñaki Urdangarín, bringing new scrutiny to the family’s wealth. In 2012, on an unpublicized trip to Botswana with his business associate and rumored mistress, Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn, Juan Carlos suffered a fall while on an elephant-hunting safari. The trip, which, according to officials, was paid for by a businessman close to the Saudi royal family, led to public anger and a level of media attention that he had eluded for most of his public life. The fall also damaged the then 74-year-old’s health; he underwent emergency hip surgery in the days that followed, and would have three more operations over the next year.\n\nWhen he abdicated the throne in June 2014, he cited hope for a new generation to take over the country, but commentators noted that his health issues and growing unpopularity might have forced his hand. At the time, the criticism was that his relationship with international wealth was improper in a country with a very high unemployment rate. Now, with this spring’s reporting on his offshore accounts, the concern is that these relationships might have constituted a crime.\n\nIn the years since the country became a constitutional monarchy in 1978, Juan Carlos tried to settle into a role similar to his fourth cousin Queen Elizabeth. He acted as a figurehead, met with Spanish citizens, and devoted his attention to causes that were important to him. But while this was going on, he also set his mind toward acquiring wealth in ways that would likely be considered untoward if pursued by the queen or her son Prince Charles.\n\nEven after the more formal limitation of his powers, Juan Carlos continued to play an active role in managing some of the country’s economic affairs. “Whenever there are large deals for Spanish companies in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, or Latin America, the person that politicians and the business community call is the King, and he makes the calls,” Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn told V.F.’s Bob Colacello in 2013.\n\nThe main difference between the Spanish royal family and the British comes in their financial relationship to the state. Because his grandfather King Alfonso XIII was exiled at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, Juan Carlos has fewer jewels and heirlooms that Queen Elizabeth, for example, has turned into a modern nest egg. From the beginning of his reign, Juan Carlos paid taxes on his income and was never the personal owner of any of the royal art collection, regalia, or palaces. And still, he has built his fortune.\n\nIn 2013, V.F. estimated that his net worth was about $2 billion, all acquired in the years since he made his return to Spain in 1948. Alfonso and his son Juan left with little wealth, and the family would spend most of Juan Carlos’s childhood dependent on support from other Spanish aristocrats who had also found themselves in exile in Italy, where Juan Carlos was born. When he was educated in Spain as a child in the 1950s, some of his expenses were provided for by the dictator Franco, who wanted to groom him as a successor.\n\nUltimately that experience shaped his approach toward making money. “He wants to guarantee during his own lifetime that his children and his children’s children will never know the financial humiliations his parents and grandparents knew,” a person acquainted with Juan Carlos’s finances told V.F. in 1992.\n\nIncreasingly, offshore accounts are used by the world’s rich to drive a defensive tax strategy. (Even the queen reportedly has a few.) But using the connections from an official role to enrich yourself while building a system of foreign bank accounts doesn’t sound like the behavior of a democratic hero. It’s more reminiscent of Vladimir Putin or Robert Mugabe, rulers who became unimaginably wealthy on the backs of struggling nations.\n\nThrough the legend of Juan Carlos’s return, the Spanish royal family became a metonym for a changed Spain, but the 21st century has battered the myth’s appeal. Though Spain was able to join the European common market, the Great Recession caused a housing crisis that did extensive damage to the country’s economy and standard of living. In 2017, the province of Catalonia held an independence vote that was technically illegal, and the national police forces responded with violence. The democratic prosperity that the country hailed in the 1990s now appears to be less democratic and less prosperous than many believed.\n\nAt this point, it’s not clear exactly why Juan Carlos found it necessary to leave the country, but it seems possible that he no longer retains the same prosecutorial immunity he held as monarch. His son, the current king, has already rebuked him, stripped him of his annual government income of €194,000, and renounced any future inheritance from him. Currently, the larger threat is to the monarchy as an institution rather than to Juan Carlos as a person. A recent poll showed that 52% of citizens would prefer that Spain became a republic. Independence movements have already seized on the newest round of scandal, and one of the parties sharing power in the country’s coalition government is anti-monarchy."
