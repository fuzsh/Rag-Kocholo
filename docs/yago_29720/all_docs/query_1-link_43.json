        "text": "Queen Elizabeth II of England died at the age of 96 at her Balmoral residence last week. She passed away after being on the British throne for 70 years. After her death, perhaps there are some who are surprised to learn of Elizabeth II’s kinship with the Spanish royal house.\n\nThe Spanish and British monarchies share blood ties. The Bourbon family and the Windsors have always maintained very close relations, and with good reason. The King Emeritus, Juan Carlos I, had a direct blood relationship with the recently deceased British monarch on his paternal side - his grandmother Victoria Eugenia was the granddaughter of Queen Victoria, who was also the great-great-grandmother of Elizabeth II.\n\nPrince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, who died last year, and Doña Sofía had a similar relationship. The Queen’s father was a first cousin of George I, Philip’s grandfather. In other words, Philip of Edinburgh was Doña Sofía’s second uncle.\n\nFelipe VI says goodbye to his ‘Aunt Lilibet’\n\nWith all this network of kinships, it is important to highlight the way in which Felipe VI, the current monarch of Spain, called Elizabeth II, Aunt Lilibet. In this affectionate way, Felipe bid farewell to the British monarch: “I would like to offer Your Majesty and the British people, on behalf of myself and the Government and people of Spain, our deepest condolences.”\n\nRelated news\n\nIn a statement, the Spanish monarch expressed how he was “deeply saddened by the sad news of the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II”, and has assured that “we will miss her very much”. “Queen Letizia and I send Her Majesty and the whole family our love and prayers. You are all in our hearts and thoughts. We will miss her very much."
