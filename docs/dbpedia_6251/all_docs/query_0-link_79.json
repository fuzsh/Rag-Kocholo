        "text": "As the UK’s 10th largest city, Leicester is increasingly becoming a hotspot for homebuyers – particularly those seeking new-build properties. Indeed, according to our recent data, demand for new-build houses in the area has surged by 33% within the last year, highlighting Leicester as one of the country’s most popular living locations.\n\nConnected and accessible\n\nOffering the perfect blend of urban vibrancy and scenic surroundings, Leicester is a city that offers its residents the best of both worlds. It’s large enough to provide all the amenities and cultural experiences you’d expect, yet compact enough to maintain a sense of accessibility and community. Combined with the city’s walkability, this makes it convenient for residents to get around and enjoy Leicester.\n\nSurrounded by rolling countryside, Leicester also gives residents the opportunity to escape the hustle and bustle, whilst remaining close to the action. The city’s central location within the UK means nothing is too far away, with commuters benefiting from fast transport links to Birmingham and London.\n\nA thriving business hub\n\nOf course, Leicester’s own business hub is thriving, with strong local industries and transport links enhancing its appeal. The city’s proximity to two international airports within an hour’s drive, as well as superior rail and motorway connections, make it an attractive location for businesses and workers alike.\n\nA vibrant city\n\nPracticalities aside, Leicester’s cultural heritage is rich and varied, making it a fun and exciting city to explore. Famous for being the resting place of Richard III – whose remains were discovered in 2012, before being reinterred in Leicester Cathedral in 2015 – history is just one of many fascinating aspects of the city.\n\nLeicester is a city of culture and leisure, with, for example, the Jewry Wall Museum taking visitors from prehistory to medieval times. Meanwhile, the New Walk Museum and Art Gallery is home to everything from Egyptian mummies to works by Picasso, Degas and Turner, whilst the National Space Centre offers a great day out for families.\n\nThe city’s nightlife and culinary scenes are both enriched by its diverse, multi-lingual population, whilst the Cultural Quarter – home to the Curve Theatre, independent music venue – the Soundhouse – and Phoenix Leicester acts as a hub for art, cinema and digital culture.\n\nEducation in Leicester is equally strong, with the city boasting 104 state-funded and 22 independent schools, in addition to two prestigious universities – namely Leicester University and De Montfort, both of which rank within the country’s top 75. This makes Leicester a top choice for families prioritising education.\n\nAn affordable housing market\n\nWith so much on offer, one could be forgiven for thinking that life in Leicester is somewhat pricey. However, in addition to falling in middle ground in terms of cost of living, the city’s affordability is another significant draw for homebuyers.\n\nAccording to newhomesforsale.co.uk data, new-build houses in Leicester are actually £35,000 less than the national average, with prices starting at £249,995. Moreover, despite volatile mortgage rates, 73% of those searching for new-build properties on the site are first-time buyers, highlighting a strong desire to get onto the property ladder in Leicester. In order to benefit from the city’s lower prices, however, prospective buyers are advised to act swiftly.\n\nLeicester’s allure\n\nWith its unique combination of affordable housing, rich cultural heritage and vibrant business environment, Leicester is an increasingly popular choice for those looking to buy a house. The city’s growing demand for new-build properties only consolidates this, underscoring the mid-sized city’s appeal as a top destination for those looking to invest in the property ladder.\n\nWith everything within approximately two hours’ reach, on top of the city’s walkable layout, Leicester offers a high quality of living and a welcoming community, without the big-city price tag. Whether you’re drawn in by its history, opportunities or diverse culture, it’s certainly a place to call home.\n\nSo, why wait? Explore the many wonderful new-build properties Leicester has to offer on the newhomesforsale.co.uk platform today.\n\nVernon Pethard, newhomesforsale.co.uk"
