        "text": "Leicester\n\n652 Reviews by Students&nbsp#37 out of 218 University locations\n\nLeicester has many options for food and for shopping. With the Highcross in the city and fosse park about 30 mins away via Bus (of which there are many running). Both have lots of options. The city has added bikes which can be hired out to get around the city on. And buses are available to get from the city to the surrounding towns and cities. And trains can get you to Nottingham within the hour. There is plenty of pubs and eateries dotted around the city.\n\nBy member1090278 On 20th August 2023\n\nStudy in Leicester\n\nSituated in the East Midlands region, Leicester is home to a wide variety of cultures and some famous sports teams, as well as the University of Leicester and De Montfort University (DMU).\n\nUniversity of Leicester\n\nUniversity of Leicester was founded in 1921 and is known for its high-quality teaching and world-leading research. The main campus is just south of the city and is currently undergoing a £300 million campus redevelopment programme. Two of the university’s claims to fame are that it is where genetic fingerprinting was invented in 1984 and home of the team who found King Richard III.\n\nFind out more\n\nDe Montfort University (DMU)\n\nDe Montfort University boasts high-quality facilities and is committed to providing it’s 20,000 students career-leading skills thanks to its strong industry links. The university offers over 400 courses and is particularly well known for its professional, design and creative courses.\n\nFind out more\n\nStudy in Leicester? Review your location\n\nLeicester Student Life\n\nLeicester isn’t massive but it has a very large student population and therefore there’ll be something for everyone in this friendly, colourful and lively city. Leicester is a melting pot of languages, races, foods and people, making for a unique university experience.\n\nCost of Living\n\nLeicester is one of the most affordable cities to live in as a student.\n\nAccommodation\n\nStudent accommodation costs range from £87.50 - £243 per week; the average is £142 per week.\n\nCompare the average elsewhere: Nottingham: £166/week, Birmingham: £173/week, London: £287/week.\n\n(prices are for all purpose-built student accommodation (both private and university-owned) over the last 12 months, as listed on StudentCrowd)\n\nThe average price for:\n\nA cheap meal at a restaurant: £11.50\n\nA pint of beer: £3.20\n\nA regular takeout coffee: £2.54\n\n1L of milk: £0.88\n\nA loaf of white bread: £0.89\n\nThe cost of living is about the same as Leeds but lower than Lancaster by 7.5% and London by 31%!\n\n(Source: Numbeo)\n\nNights Out\n\nMOSH\n\nMOSH takes its place as one of the legendary clubs for Leicester students. With events on most nights of the week featuring indie and pop music, expect to bump into your mates on one of the three floors.\n\nClub Republic\n\nClub Republic is well located for both unis and offers cheap entry and cheap drinks. Expect to get lost exploring the five different bars/rooms or treat yourself to the VIP room experience.\n\nThe Phoenix Cinema\n\nThe Phoenix is a ideal place to catch the latest films and blockbuster movies. Showing both local and global films, head here for a cinema evening of entertainment.\n\nPublic Transport\n\nThe public transport is ok. I've only experienced it as a first year student, with the uni shuttle bus system. The bus pass was a good price for the year and the buses were usually on time and came frequently.\n\nBy member545558 On 11th February 2020\n\nEating Out\n\nCurry Houses\n\nEmbrace the cosmopolitan vibes and try a few curry houses (Leicester’s famous for its currys). Top picks are Kayal, Pamson Grill, Spice Bazzar and Nawaaz. If you’re looking for vegetarian curries, try Herb or Shivalli.\n\nIndependent Restaurants\n\nYou will find all of the regular chain restaurants in Leicester but if you fancy supporting an independent establishment, we have heard good things about OGGI Simply Italian (serving more than the usual pizza/pasta fare of some chains we won’t mention), Kuru Kuru Sushi (authentic Japanese food) and Craft Burger (a pop-up burger restaurant that’s only on Thursdays - Saturdays in St Martin’s Coffee Shop and Kitchen).\n\nBrunch\n\nHere are some local spots to head for brunch if you’re meeting a friend or recovering from a big night out. The Tiny Bakery in Clarendon Park serves up pastries and all kinds of baked deliciousness. 6 Degrees Coffee House in Highfields is the spot to go for a simple breakfast and students get 10% off! In the city centre, there are numerous brunch hot spots: James’, Grays, Hollys or Hughie’s!\n\nShopping\n\nmember846050\n\nIf you don't enjoy drinking and shopping…\n\nIf you don't enjoy drinking and shopping, Leicester isn't the city for you as there is little to do beyond that.\n\nmember947066\n\nPractically every shop…\n\nThe Campus is so, so close to the city centre. Practically every shop you could need is there, as well as some cool independent businesses. The fruit and veg market is particularly cheap and ideal for students!\n\nmember1045392\n\nIt’s a small shopping centre…\n\nIt’s alright living in Leicester... The only good shops is the high cross shopping centre, its a lot smaller than the variety of shops in my home city. It’s a small shopping centre for the size of the city.\n\nBath_Time_Duck\n\nTake advantage of the fruit and vegetable market…\n\nIf you take advantage of the fruit and vegetable market in town then you could save yourself A LOT of money, even £1 can go a long way. There are a good amount of restaurants and retail shops... (M&S, Sainsburys, New Look, Topshop/man, Miss Selfridge, Office, Iceland, Tinsel Town, Nandos, TGI Fridays etc)\n\nStudy in Leicester? Review your town\n\nTop 10 Tips\n\n1\n\nComedy\n\nLeicester is home to the Leicester Comedy Festival which is the biggest of its kind in the UK. It takes place every February. Don’t miss it!\n\n2\n\nCulture\n\nMake some time while you’re in Leicester to visit the National Space Centre (students get a discounted entry) and the New Walk Museum (which is free).\n\n3\n\nShopping\n\nFor shopping you’ll find everything you need in the Highcross Centre and the Melton Road area. Also try Leicester Market; it might take a little longer to find what you’re looking for but you’re likely to save a few quid.\n\n4\n\nEntertainment\n\nIf you’re looking for live entertainment Leicester has plenty of options. There are the obvious venues such as the Leicester O2 Academy and DeMontfort Hall, but try out some of the smaller places like the Soundhouse for cheaper tickets and less mainstream bands.\n\n5\n\nPublic Transport\n\nDon’t fancy walking? There are Arriva bus services to both De Montfort and University of Leicester campuses. If you’re going to be using the bus a lot, an Arriva Student Saver ticket could be worth looking into.\n\n6\n\nVisitors?\n\nParents will love the Leicester Botanic Gardens or the Museum and Art Gallery on New Walk. Or perhaps gin is more their cup of tea. If so, check out the awesome 45 Gin School.\n\n7\n\nGreen spaces\n\nLeicester isn’t short of relaxing parks. Check out Abbey Park, Victoria (Vicky) Park and, for some delightful deer and wildlife a bit further afield, Bradgate Park.\n\n8\n\nFast Food\n\nThe Food Factory van is your one-stop-shop for a cheeky fast food fix after an epic night at the O2 Arena.\n\n9\n\nMulti-cultural\n\nLeicester is renowned for its multi-ethnic heritage. Make the most of it by enjoying the colourful, multi-cultural events such as the massive Diwali celebrations.\n\n10\n\nHistory\n\nLeicester has a rich and fascinating history. The remains of Richard III, the last King of England to be killed in battle, were uncovered under a city centre car park in 2012. Explore the history yourself at the King Richard III Visitor Centre (discounted for students).\n\nTop 10 Leicester Accommodation\n\n4.76 /5\n\n(22 reviews)\n\nLeicester One 4.76 /5\n\nWould recommended living here to anyone, the place is always clean and the rooms are amazing.

The cost of living has gone up by a lot and it is very expensive nowadays to even shop for usual groceries which is inconvenient but as a Romanian I am used to managing and getting creative with what I have, especially for cooking. The city is relatively boring to me in terms of shopping and going out as there isn't much to do in my eyes, aside from me being relatively introverted, like for example going out to eat with my girlfriend, the restaurants are pretty average and the only food that has proved to be very good is only in a small bunch of restaurants. For public transport I consider it to be too expensive, which is why I bike everywhere. The recent 2£ per ticket for any bus ride has been the only reason why I have used the bus network. read more\n\nCost of Living\n\nEating Out\n\nNights Out\n\nShopping\n\nPublic Transport\n\nAll reviews are the views of StudentCrowd members, not of StudentCrowd Limited problem with this review?\n\nmember981389\n\nI’ve never used t...\n\nI’ve never used the public transport here apart from the train, everywhere us short to get to.

Admittedly the nightlife when it comes to clubs isn’t the greatest but if you go out with a good group of friends then it’s always a good laugh, on the other hand the bars are great if you fancy a chill vibe with a few cocktails/pints of beer. There are so many different restaurants offering different types of cuisine due to the demographic diversity here (which is one of my favourite parts personally). The shopping centre has something for everyone and there are also loads of small independent shops too. If you like charity shopping you won’t be disappointed with the selection in Leicester. There are trains from Leicester to pretty much anywhere in the country at a good price if you invest in a student railcard & you can get a coach direct to London for just £10. I really enjoy living in Leicester and I’m really glad I chose to study here. read more\n\nCost of Living\n\nEating Out\n\nNights Out\n\nShopping\n\nPublic Transport\n\nAll reviews are the views of StudentCrowd members, not of StudentCrowd Limited problem with this review?\n\nmember881174\n\nLeicester is a ni...\n\nLeicester is a nice place, but cost of living crisis is kickin me in the butt rn. read more\n\nCost of Living\n\nEating Out\n\nNights Out\n\nShopping\n\nPublic Transport\n\nAll reviews are the views of StudentCrowd members, not of StudentCrowd Limited problem with this review?\n\nmember781172\n\nLoads of differen...\n\nLoads of different cultures and food places and feels fairly safe read more\n\nCost of Living\n\nEating Out\n\nNights Out\n\nShopping\n\nPublic Transport\n\nAll reviews are the views of StudentCrowd members, not of StudentCrowd Limited problem with this review?\n\nmember1081149\n\nNice city everyth...\n\nNice city everything is quite within walking distance read more\n\nCost of Living\n\nEating Out\n\nNights Out\n\nShopping\n\nPublic Transport\n\nAll reviews are the views of StudentCrowd members, not of StudentCrowd Limited problem with this review?\n\nmember1081150\n\nI really enjoy li...\n\nI really enjoy living in Leicester it’s different from where i am from read more\n\nCost of Living\n\nEating Out\n\nNights Out\n\nShopping\n\nPublic Transport\n\nAll reviews are the views of StudentCrowd members, not of StudentCrowd Limited problem with this review?\n\nmember981137\n\nGreat city with a...\n\nGreat city with a plenty of stuff to do.

The bus faires are less £3 as of now so i feel that it is really good for students as the price is £2 . With regards to the nights out i feel that it is average as there isn't many options compared to other cities as well as this i feel that there isn't enough student ones . As i live in the city there is only one really good student club and that is 02 Academy leicester . read more\n\nCost of Living\n\nEating Out\n\nNights Out\n\nShopping\n\nPublic Transport\n\nAll reviews are the views of StudentCrowd members, not of StudentCrowd Limited problem with this review?\n\nmember781013\n\nBeen good so far....\n\nBeen good so far.
