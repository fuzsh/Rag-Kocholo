        "text": "They say â€˜thereâ€™s no such thing as bad weatherâ€™, but there are days that itâ€™s just sometimes just too wet, too cold or too windy for an outdoor adventure â€“ and no one likes grumpy kids (or parents!).\n\nSo if youâ€™re looking for rainy day out ideas with indoor activities (not just soft play!), that are easily reachable from Leicester, somewhere to escape the sun, or something different to do at weekends or the school holidays, check out some of our favourites below.\n\nPlease note, some of our reviews were visited pre-Covid, as weâ€™ve only just started returning to indoor attractions. Please visit their website for the latest information.\n\nNinja Warrior UK Adventure Park\n\nThe Ninja Warrior UK adventure park is suitable for kids 5 years and over, with a Ninja Warrior obstacle course with climbing walls, nets and more, as well as a huge inflatable Air Park.\n\nThere are sessions for kids under 5 years and it is suitable for adults too â€“ the kids donâ€™t always get to have all the fun ðŸ™‚\n\nThere is a great cafe area with spectator gallery, plus parking is free for 3 hours in the St Georgeâ€™s Retail Park, so you can enjoy a quick bit of shopping while there too!\n\nCheck out our full review here or book your session here.\n\nNational Space Centre, Leicester\n\nIt may be an obvious choice, but the National Space Centre is a great place to visit with the kids.\n\nThe whole centre has recently been refurbished, with a great deal of investment in the entrance area and galleries too. It really looks fantastic, and is a welcoming entrance for visitors.\n\nFor the younger ones, thereâ€™s dressing up areas available on your way round, such as stars and space rockets, as well as plenty of sensory opportunities â€“ from space rubbings in the rocket tower, to puzzles, buttons to press, and little tunnels to crawl through as you go round.\n\nItâ€™s also pram and wheelchair-friendly, with wide, open paths between galleries, and lifts to go up between the floors.\n\nFor the older kids, itâ€™s a pure learning and sensory experience, with plenty of interactive features, such as launching space rockets and going into weather tunnels, helping them learn about space in a fun and interactive way.\n\nCheck out our full review here or visit their website here\n\nBoost Trampoline Park â€“ Leicester and Northampton\n\nBoost Trampoline Parks are in both Northampton and Leicester. Lily has bounced at Boost since she was 2 years old, and was really excited to head back upon reopening.\n\nWith trampolines, foam pits, balance beams and more, we really do recommend a visit to Boost Trampoline Park.\n\nCheck out our review here or visit their website here for session details.\n\nTamworth SnowDome\n\nThere is so much fun to be had at Tamworth SnowDome, whatever the weather. From their amazing snow fun park to their climbing walls and tobogganing too, weâ€™ve always loved our visits to SnowDome.\n\nWe recommend signing up to their newsletter for huge discounts on all their activities, but we canâ€™t recommend it enough for an adventure with the family!\n\nFind out more here or check out our review here.\n\nWest Lodge Farm Park, Kettering\n\nWeâ€™ve enjoyed West Lodge Farm Park in every weather condition, whether itâ€™s visiting after school, for Lilyâ€™s birthday or one of their fantastic events, and weâ€™ve had a fantastic time every single time.\n\nMost of the farm is outdoors, however their walking trails are sheltered by trees for a bit of a break from the rain outdoors, and they have the most amazing wooden indoor play barn too around a huge tree, with slides, bridges and more.\n\nFor smaller kids, thereâ€™s even a dedicated area with interactive light-pond and smaller climbing area with slide.\n\nWhatâ€™s more, youâ€™ve the cafÃ© here, so you can enjoy lighter snacks and hot / cold drinks indoors, with plenty of seating, and easy access to the toilets (including a disabled toilet). It is warm, bright, safe and friendly, and was definitely a very welcome escape from the rain with a hot drink!\n\nPlus, if youâ€™re attending any of their seasonal events, most of the event areas take place in barns, such as Santaâ€™s workshops and their spooky walkway, so you can still enjoy the events, even if the weather turns really bad!\n\nWe canâ€™t recommend West Lodge Farm Park enough to families and the friendly, helpful staff always brighten up any day.\n\nFind out more about West Lodge Farm Park here.\n\nSocial Climbing, Leicester\n\nFor kids over 5, Social Climbing is a great activity in Leicester city centre, based at Highcross shopping centre.\n\nYou donâ€™t need to prebook, but signing the forms online saves you time when you arrive.

The floors are bouncy too, so easy to jump onto from the floor. They also have drop-off sessions at weekends for different age groups where you can leave the kids for an hour!\n\nYouâ€™re also not limited to time, so can spend as long as you like there once youâ€™ve booked in for the day.\n\nYou can find out more about Social Climbing here.\n\nLittle Avenue, Leicester\n\nLittle Avenue is a childrenâ€™s role play centre built during lockdown within the Go Kids Go soft play centre.\n\nPlease note, Little Avenue is upstairs within the building and there is no lift access, so it is not accessible, however there is baby changing and disabled toilet within the Go Kids Go play area.\n\nLittle Avenue features 12 separate child-sized play areas, including a vet, supermarket, fire station, cafÃ© and more.\n\nThere is also a seating area with drinks and refreshments.\n\nLily really enjoyed playing at Little Avenue and had a really great time.
