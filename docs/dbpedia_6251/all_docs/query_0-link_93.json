The last English king to die in battle.\n\nIncredibly, the excavation uncovered not only the friary of Grey Friars but also a battle-scarred skeleton with spinal curvature. On 4th February 2013, the University announced to the world's press that these were the remains of King Richard III.\n\nThis journey is rural and even remote at times, yet flings in and out of colourful hubs that tell gripping stories of canal-life to the passing traveller. The East Midlands or Leicester Ring is an idyllic rollercoaster sweeping through wide open views and some of the best-loved highlights of England's canals. With peaceful disregard for boundaries, the route meanders through five counties, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Derbyshire. And with rivers, aqueducts, lock staircase flights and 5 tunnels to navigate, this ring is a challenge to test the helmsman's skills.\n\nRoute Info\n\nRoute Facts & Figures\n\nRecommended Holiday\n\nDuration : 14 nights.\n\nTotal Cruising Days : 15.00\n\n(Partial or full days)\n\nTotal Cruising Time : 88.00 hours\n\nTotal Distance : 180.00 miles\n\nNumber of Locks : 115\n\nNumber of Tunnels : 5\n\nNumber of Aqueducts : 0\n\nRead the Cruising Notes\n\nRead our cruising notes to help you plan your canal boat holiday\n\nRead our cruising notes.\n\nCruising Notes\n\nDay 1\n\nHead back down the Northampton Arm of the Grand Union to Gayton Junction.(Turn right out of the marina).\n\nAt Gayton Junction turn right down the Grand Union Canal.

It is 5 hours 20 minutes from Gayton marina to here, or 3 hours from Weedon to here. At Norton Junction you can then go down the Grand Union west towards Braunston.From Norton Junction to Braunston the canal runs westward through hills and wooded country, then into a wooded cutting which leads to Braunston Tunnel.\n\nOff to the north on your right you will pass the small village of Welton on a hill. At Bridge 6 ¾ mile from the Canal you can find a 400 yr old pub – The White Horse Inn.\n\nBraunston Tunnel was opened in 1796 & is 2042 yards long.\n\nLong rows of moored craft flank the canal, but there is usually plenty of places to moor, as it is worth strolling into Braunston as there are a fine selection of old buildings here.
