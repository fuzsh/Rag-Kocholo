        "text": "It's official - Leicester is the best place in the East Midlands to live and work. The findings come in new data which shows that the city was above the national average in several areas which contribute to economic growth.\n\nThe top ranking was revealed in the Demos-PwC Good Growth for Cities Index which compared Leicester against its East Midlands rivals Derby, Nottingham, Lincoln, Peterborough and Northampton. Across 14 economic measures including jobs, health and housing, it found Leicester was the region’s best performer - and the UK’s 16th best city overall.\n\nThe Index, which ranks the 50 largest cities in the UK, found Leicester out-performed the rest of the East Midlands and much of the country on its work-life balance as well as skills - both up more than one per cent. Leicester’s biggest index growth in the last 12 months was skills among 16-24-year-olds, with PwC saying the sector had grown by nearly one per cent since 2022 - a rate of growth only beaten by Peterborough in the region.\n\nREAD MORE: Meet Miss Maguire, the Leicester teacher named by Times Educational Supplement as one of UK's best and her pupils agree\n\nLeicester’s good news was also seen on the overall economic picture, with the data showing that it scored above the UK average for the number of new businesses and for its transport links. Income distribution was also seen to be significantly up (1.3 per cent) on national figures, while levels of safety also saw a rise too.\n\nThe city also recorded a number of scores in line with those seen across the UK. Its number of jobs and owner-occupied rates remained in line with much of the country, but it was not all good news for Leicester though. The Index found its levels of affordable housing and the state of high streets saw it fall below the national average, but not by enough to dethrone it from the top spot of the East Midlands.\n\nAlex Hudson, market senior partner for PwC East Midlands, said: “The outlook in the East Midlands is a positive one, and it’s pleasing to see our cities generally fairing well in our analysis this year. Aligned with the government’s Levelling Up agenda, local government and employers have a part to play in providing opportunities for people to grow their businesses, careers and skills right across the region.”\n\nPwC’s belief in the Midlands was displayed in its rankings of the other cities, with Peterborough the next best performer in 23rd out of the 50 cities, just edging out Derby in 24th. Both were praised for their transport and income distribution, but fell short on high streets and new businesses respectively.\n\nElsewhere, Lincoln and Nottingham followed in 35th and 36 respectively, while the worst performing city in the East Midlands is Northampton. PwC say this is unlikely to remain the case as the city is expected to grow the most over the next two years.\n\nDespite that positive outlook, Mr Hudson said the East Midlands needed to be wary as the region’s economy is expected to contract by 0.06 per cent in 2023 - compared to growth of 0.05 per cent in the UK as a whole. Where current issues are seen in the Index, he believed work could remedy that.\n\nHe said: “The report highlights some areas in which the East Midlands performs behind the UK average, including income and house prices, as well as weaker predicted economic growth. This should be used as a map of opportunity, showing where continued support can have a real impact on improving aspects identified by the public as priorities. The East Midlands will also benefit from the recently announced investment zones, where we will receive £80m of support over five years.”\n\nNationally, the top performers were Oxford, Bristol, Exeter, Swindon and Southampton. Worst performing cities according to the data are Bradford, followed by London (boroughs only), and Middlesbrough and Stockton.\n\nFor top stories from across Leicestershire and Rutland, sign up to our newsletters here.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
