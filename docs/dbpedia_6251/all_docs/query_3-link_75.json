        "text": "De Montfort University (DMU) is located in the welcoming and multicultural city of Leicester, just over an hour from London and offers more than 300 courses at foundation, undergraduate and postgraduate, many of which offer professional accreditations, links to industry or work experience.\n\nEach year more than 2,700 international students from more than 130 countries choose to study with at DMU.\n\nDMU also has a wide range of accommodation within walking distance of the campus. Situated on the edge of the city centre, this also means Leicester’s many attractions are only minutes away.\n\nIn 2021, DMU was named the best university in the UK for our careers and employability service, at the National Undergraduate Employability Awards. Previous DMU graduates have gone on to work on Oscar-winning films and with organisations such as the BBC, HSBC, Nike, BMW and the NHS.\n\nBased in the East Midlands of England, Leicester is described by many as one of the most diverse cities. It is home to Britain’s largest Caribbean festival outside London, as well as the biggest Diwali celebrations outside India. Combined with this is the undying sporting spirit and its solid reputation for creative energy and innovation.\n\nIf that did not convince you, here are other top reasons to study in Leicester:\n\nAffordable: The cost of accommodation, grocery shopping and social activities in Leicester combined was far more wallet-friendly than Birmingham, Coventry and neighbouring Nottingham.\n\nWell-connected: At a speedy 1-hour journey from London, Leicester’s location means you’re never too far from the capital’s action.\n\nDiverse: Leicester is home to several communities with different backgrounds and ethnicities.\n\nAt DMU, there is a place for all types of students. With a wide range of modern facilities, lecture theatres, specialist equipment and extracurricular activities, it is difficult to find something missing.\n\nAlong with this, DMU aims to broaden cultural horizons, improve students’ ability to communicate and develop other key skills valued by employers.\n\nThe university’s award-winning DMU Global programme is offering students hundreds of overseas, on-campus and online opportunities to experience different cultures and ways of learning to boost their job opportunities and help them develop a range of key skills.\n\nSince its launch, more than 14,000 students have gone overseas with DMU Global, visiting over 65 countries and 60 universities."
