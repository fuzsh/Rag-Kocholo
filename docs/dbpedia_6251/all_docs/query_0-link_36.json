        "text": "The match will be played between the two in the Premier League on Saturday.\n\nThe East Midlands Derby is the most eagerly anticipated rivalry in the Premier League since both Leicester City and Nottingham Forest are East Midlands-based teams. There have been 108 meetings between the two clubs, with the first one occurring in 1903.\n\nThese two are the most prosperous clubs in the East Midlands because Leicester has Coventry City as its closest neighbour and Forest is closer to Notts County and Derby County.\n\nSince their first-ever encounter took place in 1903, the clubs' rivalry has grown in importance in Europe and the Premier League as a result of frequent, intense matches between the two teams, which occasionally end in fan clashes and a lot of racial chanting that prompts an investigation.\n\nForest, who was recently promoted to the Premier League for the first time since 1999, will play Leicester tomorrow night in what will be a significant clash between the two clubs.\n\nHow did the rivalry between East Midlands clubs intensify?\n\nThere have been some games that have affected the rivalry, like the humbling meeting on April 21, 1909, when Forest defeated Leicester by a score of 12 goals. Due to the foxes' dismal performance, the game sparked an investigation, and it was revealed that the players had been drinking too much at a teammate's wedding the night before the game.\n\nThe most exciting game in their history took place when Leicester and Forest squared off in the Football League Championship, giving both clubs a chance to advance to the play-off round for a place in the Premier League in the 2012–13 season. The score stayed 2-2 until the last minutes when Anthony Knockaert's goal gave the Foxes the play-off position and gave City its first league victory since 1972.\n\nBesides games, there have been horrific incidents\n\nA rivalry without fights and controversy is always incomplete, and these included every sort of incident that a football fan could witness.\n\nFoxes and Forest had seen their fans indulging in fights in the games, the first occurred in 1977 when both club’s fans were arrested in connection with the incident. And racist chants have also been part of their history, as fans have also thrown objects at each other. And most recently, in the 2012 FA Cup, there were eleven arrests.\n\nWhile some supporters were detained for sending racial slurs to Leicester supporters in tweets, And on Boxing Day between Leicester and Forest in 2018, there was a fight between two fans.\n\nThe saddest part about these instances is that, despite the arrests, their supporters continue to chant in a racial manner, degrading the stature of the derby.\n\nTrophies won by each club\n\nAlthough both teams have won the same number of Premier League championships, Nottingham Forest has won more trophies than Leicester. To see how many trophies each team has won, see the table below.\n\nNottingham Forest Trophies\n\nPremier League: 1\n\nFA Cup: 2\n\nLeague Cup: 4\n\nCommunity Shield: 1\n\nChampions League: 2\n\nUEFA Super Cup: 1\n\nLeicester City Trophies\n\nPremier League: 1\n\nFA Cup: 1\n\nLeague Cup: 3\n\nCommunity Shield: 2\n\nChampions League: 0\n\nUEFA Super Cup: 0\n\nIn October, Foxes and Forest played each other in a top-flight match for the first time in 23 years, with Leicester winning 4-0. Both teams are now in the relegation battle, with Leicester in 13th place and Nottingham in 15th place, respectively. The teams will face off again tomorrow evening, which will further decide their chances of staying in the top flight."
