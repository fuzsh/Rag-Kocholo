        "text": "Sector Profiles for Leicester and Leicestershire\n\nThe Leicester and Leicestershire economy is diverse, with representation across a variety of sectors ranging from traditional strengths such as manufacturing and logistics through to high-growth areas such as space and low carbon.\n\nThe outlook for all sectors has shifted in recent years.\n\nWith this in mind, we have conducted research on 15 key sectors of interest to the local economy, to better understand the impact of both Covid-19 and EU Exit across our sectors and what the future could look like in the short, medium and longer term. We recognise that although all sectors are affected, the impact on each will differ substantially.\n\nOur sector profiles cover various topics including economic and growth indicators and future skills challenges."
