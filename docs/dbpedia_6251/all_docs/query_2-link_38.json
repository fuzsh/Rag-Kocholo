A great leadership team with big ambitions. Melton Borough Council is in search of a Director for Place and Prosperity. Melton Borough Council is known \"punching above its weight\" and has a new and ambitious corporate strategy based on a clear mission: Helping People – Shaping Places. The Local Plan is delivering hundreds of new homes annually, and construction of a game-changing relief road is underway. In recent years, the council has also secured significant funding to allow regeneration of Melton Mowbray town centre, building upon its reputation as the Rural Capital of Food, and supporting sustainable growth across the borough. The new Director for Place and Prosperity will work with council members, partners, and the senior leadership team to bring fresh momentum to the council, delivering the many exciting projects in the pipeline and driving forward long-term strategic growth ambitions. Candidates will need a significant track record of success in delivering growth and development projects, securing funding streams, building strong and productive partnerships, and place shaping to ensure Melton's place and communities can thrive. An understanding of the particular challenges and opportunities facing a rural authority like Melton would also be highly desirable.
