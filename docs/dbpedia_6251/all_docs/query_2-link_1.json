        "text": "Employment in Leicester has decreased compared with the previous year\n\nLeicester's employment rate was lower than across the East Midlands as a whole in the year ending December 2023.\n\nOf people aged 16 to 64 years living in Leicester, 65.1% were employed in the year ending December 2023. This is a decrease compared with the year ending December 2022 when the local rate was 69.7%.\n\nAcross the East Midlands in the year ending December 2023, 75.5% of people aged 16 to 64 years were employed. This was slightly higher compared with the previous year, when 75.2% of people were employed.\n\nUnemployment rose in Leicester compared with the previous year\n\nUnemployment estimates are modelled to improve their precision compared to those based only on responses provided via the Annual Population Survey.\n\nAround 11,600 people aged 16 and over in Leicester were unemployed in the year ending December 2023. This is a rate of 6.7%.\n\nThis was an increase compared with the year ending December 2022 when the unemployment rate was 4.4%.\n\nAcross the East Midlands, from the year ending December 2022 to the year ending December 2023, there was an increase in the unemployment rate from 2.9% to 3.7%.\n\nYear on year, the number of people unemployed in the East Midlands rose from around 68,700 to around 90,200 over the same period.\n\nUnemployment across Great Britain rose slightly between the year ending December 2022 and the year ending December 2023, going from around 1,180,000 people (3.6%) to around 1,240,000 (3.7%).\n\nUnemployed people are those without jobs who are actively seeking work and available to take up a job. Some jobless people may not seek work or be able to work for various reasons, such as retirement, sickness, or study, and are called \"economically inactive\".\n\nThis means that the employment rate and the unemployment rate can both go up at the same time as people move into the labour market and become job seekers.\n\nThe unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people out of everyone \"economically active\" in the labour market, that is, everyone who is employed or looking for work. The employment rate is out of the working-age population including \"economically inactive\" people.\n\nEconomic inactivity has increased in Leicester compared with the previous year\n\nAround 66,400 people or 28.1% of the population aged 16 to 64 years in Leicester were \"economically inactive\" in the year ending December 2023. This compares with around 63,200 people (26.7%) in the year ending December 2022.\n\nPeople are classed as \"economically inactive\" if they are not in employment but don't meet the criteria for being \"unemployed\". This means they have not been seeking work within the previous four weeks or were unable to start work within the next two weeks. Common reasons include being retired, looking after the home or family or being temporarily or long-term sick and disabled.\n\nEconomic inactivity in Leicester is higher than across the East Midlands and Great Britain.\n\nAcross the East Midlands, 21.6% of people aged 16 to 64 years were economically inactive during the year ending December 2023, a decrease compared with the year ending December 2022 when 22.6% were economically inactive.\n\nOverall in Great Britain, 21.2% of people aged 16 to 64 years were economically inactive, compared with 21.5% in the previous year."
