The staff, from Shaaban to Keshvi and Isabela, are phenomenal. The location is perfectâ€”I can walk everywhere due to its central location. The common area is great for hosting dinners, and the facilities provided are very convenient. One of my favorite aspects of the building is the view towards the cathedral. Additionally, they organize fun parties and events with free food and drinks, which are always a hit.\n\nPlease share one thing (or more) which you wish you had known before you moved in:\n\nSome flats require more heating due to poor insulation or high ceilings but I personally only found it inconvenient in one winter out of the three\n\nHow has the building management responded to any problems or issues you have raised:\n\nThey immediately look into it and provide a solution. They are truly brilliant\n\n5\n\nFacilities\n\n5\n\nDesign\n\n5\n\nLocation\n\n5\n\nValue\n\n5\n\nManagement\n\nRead all Read less\n\nThe best place to rent in Leicester\n\nEsquires coffee shop just by the entrance, residents can have a discount too. The Management team was kind to provide a parking space as soon as they could. Absolutely loved the concierge team. Great place to live.\n\nPlease review your development:\n\nThe best place to rent in Leicester. Modern and great facilities (rooftop, BBQ area), facilities are always clean. The management team constantly strived to update facilities (e.g. new chairs). Parking is very convenient and safe for tenants and guests.\n\nPlease share one thing (or more) which you wish you had known before you moved in:\n\nYou can get a single Paxton access key fob for GBP10 on Amazon, and the concierge can grant you access on this fob for free. This is less likely to get lost compared to the key fob card given to you at the start of your tenancy, especially when you can hang it with your keys.\n\nHow has the building management responded to any problems or issues you have raised:\n\nFew days of delay in fixing cold water in the shower, but this occurred during Christmas and New Year bank holiday. Once this was raised with the concierge team, this was promptly addressed after the bank holiday.\n\n5\n\nFacilities\n\n5\n\nDesign\n\n5\n\nLocation\n\n5\n\nValue\n\n5\n\nManagement\n\nRead all Read less\n\nNice place to live!\n\nVerified Resident\n\nVerified Resident\n\nGreat location, near to the train and bus station which helps with travelling to work. I am happy with fact that building offers car parking spaces as when I am having visitors, I donâ€™t need to worry about looking for the car parking options nearby. There is so many different restaurants and pubs in this area.\n\nPlease review your development:\n\nThe management team is lovely! Always here to help for the residents. Building 21 needs some upgrade, however management team has arranged some works to improve corridor areas already. The communal area is one from the biggest advantage. The pool, gym or the residents lounge are always kept clean and tidy by lovely cleaner Karen.\n\nPlease share one thing (or more) which you wish you had known before you moved in:\n\nI believe all have been clearly explained and shown either on the viewing or move in day.\n\nHow has the building management responded to any problems or issues you have raised:\n\nAlways responds are quick and staff is very helpful!\n\n4\n\nFacilities\n\n5\n\nDesign\n\n4\n\nLocation\n\n4\n\nValue\n\n5\n\nManagement\n\nRead all Read less"
