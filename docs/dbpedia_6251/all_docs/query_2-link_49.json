We work in partnership with organisations that can back community businesses to thrive in challenging conditions.\n\nOur partners come from across sectors, including regional and local authorities, think tanks and research institutes.We also work closely with organisations that can provide tailored support to directly develop and support community businesses.\n\nTogether we do, test and learn what works.\n\nTogether we can create better places\n\nWe know community business works to build stronger communities and better places to live. We’ve seen people create resilient and prosperous local economies when power is in community hands. We also know the barriers that stand in the way of their success.\n\nWe’re using our experience in the sector to tackle those barriers. We’d love you to join us to turn bold ideas into action.\n\nLet’s talk about how we can work together."
