        "text": "Leicester Cathedral has been embedded in the public, economic, cultural and religious life of this community for over 900 years. Since 1927, as the seat of the Bishop of Leicester, we now gather people together for worship, celebration, lament, debate and service of the poor and vulnerable.\n\nThe Cathedral is open daily and all are welcome.\n\nAdmission to the Cathedral is by a suggested voluntary donation of £5 per adult (some events and activities have a separate charge)\n\nVisiting Hours\n\nDaily visiting times:\n\nMonday to Friday\n\n9.00am – 5.00pm\n\nSaturday\n\n10.00am – 5.00pm\n\nSunday\n\n12.00pm – 3.00pm\n\nThe Tomb of Richard III can be visited between 10.30am–4.30pm from Monday to Saturday, and between 12.30–3.00pm on Sundays.\n\nSome parts of the building are inaccessible for general visiting while a service is taking place. Our daily pattern of services can be found here.\n\nOccasionally, there are special services or events which may affect our opening hours or access to parts of the building. These will be announced on our Closures page.\n\nEntrance\n\nThe current main entrance to the Cathedral is the North Porch, located on Guildhall Lane, while building works take place for the final stage of the Leicester Cathedral Revealed project\n\nThe main entrance will return to the South Door (Vaughan Porch) when Cathedral Gardens re-open later in 2024.\n\nThe Cathedral is open daily, entry is free with encouraged donation, and all are welcome.\n\nHow to find us\n\nBY TRAIN\n\nThere are good rail links to Leicester from Birmingham, Sheffield and London.

The facilities include baby changing and an accessible toilet.\n\nDog Policy\n\nWe're happy to say that our warm welcome extends to well-behaved dogs. In order to ensure that the Cathedral remains a safe and enjoyable place for everyone we ask that you are mindful of other visitors – particularly those who might be using the space for quiet prayer or reflection – and ensure your dog is well-behaved, on a short lead at all times and not disturbing others.\n\nOwners will need to clean up after their dog in the case of an unfortunate accident. And in order to ensure maximum enjoyment for all, dogs are not currently permitted on guided tours or to attend events (unless otherwise stated).\n\nGuide dogs, hearing dogs, assistance dogs and well-behaved dogs are permitted to attend services."
