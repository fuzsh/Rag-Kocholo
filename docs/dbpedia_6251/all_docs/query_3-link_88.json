        "text": "Leicester’s marvellous market\n\nNo list about Leicester is complete without a nod to its famous market, thought to be the biggest covered market in Europe. In the heart of the city centre, just south of the clock tower, you’ll find the 700-year-old site bustling with outdoor traders and a light and bright indoor food hall selling everything you can imagine. It is the largest outdoor covered market in Europe.\n\nPick yourself up a block of Red Leicester, a Melton Mowbray pork pie or enough fruit and veg for the week for about £3 – we’re really not exaggerating on that one! It is open from Monday to Saturday 7am – 6pm and has over 270 stalls.\n\nThe birthplace of modern English\n\nDid you know the English language as we now know it is believed to have originated in Leicester? This fact proves that Leicester has made its presence felt across the world!\n\nWith a history spanning over 2,000 years, it’s thought that warring Anglo Saxons and Vikings set aside their differences long enough to establish a shared language that formed English, spoken by over 1 billion people, as we know it today – that’s one for your next pub quiz.\n\nSuffragette city\n\nYou’ve inevitably heard of the Pankhursts and probably also Emily Davidson who was run down by King George V’s horse. But given that there were so many women who risked their lives and liberty for the right to vote, it’s surprising how few suffragettes most people could name Just outside the market, you’ll find a statue of Alice Hawkins – a leading English suffragette among the boot and shoe machinists of Leicester (also a famed textile industry location). She went to prison five times for acts committed as part of the Women’s Social and Political Union militant campaign, and her statue was erected near the spot it’s believed Hawkins would’ve stood when she addressed the public.\n\nAlice Hawkins’ statue is located in Green Dragon Square, Leicester.\n\nThe birthplace of crisps\n\nLeicester-born Henry Walker created one of the world’s most recognisable (and delicious) crisp brands and has kept it in the city for over 70 years. Walkers Crisps has a large 47% share of the British crisp market and the Walkers site is arguably one of the largest crisp production plants on the planet, producing over 11 million bags per day and using about 800t of potatoes (that’s 280,000t a year)!\n\nIn fact, if you head over to the district of Beaumont Leys, you can smell the Walkers factory before you see it. During the peak season of March to October, potatoes arrive at the factory from the fields. For the rest of the year they are stored in an environmentally-controlled environment.\n\nA true place of celebration\n\nLeicester is known for its diversity and as a result, it’s a city that knows how to throw a good party. The annual Carribbean Carnival is said to be the second largest in the UK, just behind Notting Hill. It has been celebrated for over 30 years after first being held in 1985 to commemorate the emancipation of slavery in the West Indies, which happened on the 1st August 1834. The celebration has since evolved from the city’s unique mix of Caribbean cultures and is a celebration of all things Caribbean – food, music, dance, arts, crafts and more!\n\nThe Diwali celebrations are the biggest outside of India, thanks to the city’s thriving Indian population and renowned ‘Golden Mile’. Diwali, the Festival of Light, is one of the most significant festivals in Indian culture and is celebrated each autumn between mid-October and mid-November. It represents new beginnings, the triumph of good over evil, light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance.\n\nLeicester’s epic Christmas market also brings cuisines from all over the world. There’s no shortage of music, dancing, food, fireworks and lights whatever the occasion in Leicester.\n\nA place for history buffs\n\nThose with a passion or curiosity for history will be spoilt for choice in Leicester city. Find out how Leicester’s social and built heritage plays a key part in the city today and into the future. You’ll find some of the best museums and galleries in Leicester to explore, offering everything from the discovery of King Richard III (the king in the carpark) to Leicester’s rich Iron Age history.\n\nMany of the exhibitions and heritage sites are free and easily accessible on foot.\n\nLeicester’s comedy festival\n\nStep aside, Edinburgh because Leicester is home to the largest and longest-running comedy event in Britain. The festival started in 1994 with 40 events in 23 venues over 7 days throughout Leicestershire, attracting 5,000 people. The festival now attracts over 60,000 people from all over the world. When it began, the festival lasted for just a week. In 2010 the duration increased from 10 days to 17 days, then partnering with comedy connoisseurs Dave, the last event boasted 640 gigs across 47 venues over 19 days.\n\nWith a choice of intimate gigs in bars to larger-scale events at the city’s O2 arena and featuring comedy from the likes of Johnny Vegas, Jimmy Carr, Russell Howard and Sarah Millican, it’s no wonder the Guardian dubbed it ‘one of the best comedy festivals in the world.’\n\nNarborough Road\n\nNamed the UK’s “most diverse” road in a 2016 research project by the London School of Economics, Leicester has well-earned bragging rights over diversity and the gateway to the city, Narborough Road. Its one mile length road is home to at least 23 different nationalities, from countries such as Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia as well as Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. Known to locals as ‘The Narb’, it boasts over 200 shop units with owners hailing from many different countries across four continents. There you’ll also find a variety of bars, food outlets and shops that sell, quite literally, everything.\n\nIt was once said that England is a nation of shopkeepers. Today, those shopkeepers come from all corners of the globe.\n\nGet some green space\n\nFor a busy and built-up city like Leicester, it’s surprising just how much green space there is within and surrounding its boundaries. There’s a huge choice of tranquil parks to provide you with the perfect escape from the generally indoor lives that studying brings.\n\nAlongside the food, music and history, there are some of the best parks in Leicester to enjoy, offering plenty of space to get away from it all. Take a study break in the city’s Abbey Park, or the riverside Castle Gardens a mere five minute walk from De Montfort University or Victoria Park which is a stone’s throw from Leicester University sites. If you get the chance to explore a little further afield, check out the beautiful wildlife at Bradgate Park or stunning views of Watermead Park."
