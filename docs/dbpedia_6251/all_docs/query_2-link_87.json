        "text": "Nottingham has overtaken Derby to become the fastest-growing city economy in the East Midlands, according to a new report.\n\nThe UK Powerhouse report showed Nottingham’s economy grew by 0.7 percent in the 12 months to June 30 this year – ahead of Derby at 0.6 percent and Leicester’s 0.5 percent.\n\nIt found the annual rate of job creation in Nottingham was 1.4 percent, higher than Leicester at 1.2 percent and Derby at 1.1 percent.\n\nBut no Midlands cities made the top 10 of the fastest-growing locations in the UK, with cities in the South East and East of England dominating.\n\nChris Hobson, director of policy at East Midlands Chamber, said: “Growth patterns ebb and flow and, right now, Nottingham is in the ascendancy, which is very positive for the city.\n\n\"It is enjoying growth in the life-sciences sector, for example, and has very strong universities, which don’t just provide a strong student economy but also encourage spin-out companies and entrepreneurialism.\n\n“Following the 2016 Brexit vote, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire and the wider region have proved incredibly robust.\n\n\"Indeed, at the start of 2017 some areas saw growth at levels not seen for many years, with manufacturing in the region, in particular, on the front foot and taking advantage of opportunities coming from a weaker pound.”\n\nThe UK Powerhouse report is produced by Sheffield-based Irwin Mitchell Solicitors with economic consultancy, the Centre for Economics and Business Research, providing a quarterly estimate of GVA – the value of goods and services produced – and job creation within 45 UK cities, 12 months ahead of the Government’s official figures.\n\nLooking ahead to 2027, it has estimated Derby will have marginally the fastest growing city economy across the East Midlands, with GVA increasing by 14.9 percent over the next decade.\n\nNottingham’s economy is expected to grow by 14.8 percent, while it is predicted Leicester’s economy will lag far behind at 12.9 percent.\n\nAre you looking for a job in Nottingham? Check out our jobs listings here.\n\nUK Powerhouse also examines the impact that technology has on city economics, with Nottingham leading the pack regionally and above the 14 percent UK average growth.\n\nThe sector had grown by 18 percent in the city, ahead of Leicester at one percent – while the contribution of technology to Derby’s economy has actually fallen by nine percent.\n\nIt is further predicted that the UK-wide number of jobs in the technology sector will increase by 24 percent in the next 10 years. However, the report raises concerns that the true potential might not be realised.\n\nTo ensure all cities in the East Midlands benefit from the available opportunities in the tech sector, the report recommends a holistic approach and makes a number of recommendations.
