        "text": "1. King Richard III Visitor Centre: A Dramatic Royal Attraction\n\nIn 2012, academics made an incredible discovery underneath a Leicester car park when they unearthed the remains of King Richard III. Made famous by Shakespeare (who portrayed Richard in an unflattering light), the king defeated at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 has now been given a royal setting where visitors can discover everything about his life and times. Filled with tales of murder and war, the Visitor Centre offers a unique window into England's turbulent past and one of its most controversial rulers.\n\n2. Leicester Cathedral: A Fitting Royal Burial Site\n\nAfter visiting the Richard III Visitor Centre, head to the Cathedral, where the legendary king was reburied in 2015, and stay to see one of England's most beautiful churches. Highlights include the solemn East Window, which remembers the dead of World War I, the stone statues of saints crowning the Vaughan Porch, and the tower, which contains 13 bells that ring on Thursday evenings and Sunday mornings (as well as the king's tomb, of course).\n\n3. National Space Centre: An Out of this World Attraction\n\nLocated in the northern part of the city by the River Soar, the National Space Centre offers something completely different from long-dead kings. The UK's premier space museum allows visitors to cruise the surfaces of Venus, explore the origins of the universe, inhabit a module of the International Space Station, or stare up at the Thor Able rocket in the 42 meter tall Rocket Tower. Everything here is geared towards the needs of youngsters, with plenty of hands-on installations and even the chance to try on space suits, so any budding astronauts young or old will adore it.\n\n4. New Walk Museum and Art Gallery: See Some Fantastic Fossils\n\nLocated just south of the city center, the New Walk Museum and Art Gallery has hosted a superb collection of scientific and artistic exhibits since 1849. From fully reconstructed skeletons of plesiosaurs to one of the world's oldest fossils, it houses one of the finest natural history collections around. You'll also find a marvelous collection of German Expressionist art, and four eerie Egyptian mummies as well. Admission is free, making it an affordable yet unmissable Leicester attraction.\n\n5. Newarke Houses Museum: Bringing Leicester's History to Life\n\nA couple of hundred meters south of the Cathedral, Newark Houses Museum is a quirky, varied, and fun museum of Leicester's history. Find out about larger-than-life figures like Daniel Lambert (once Britain's largest man), see an enchanting collection of toys that stretch back to Tudor times, and experience what life was like in the First World War trenches, where local soldiers fought and often died. A neat complement to the Richard III exhibits, this child-friendly museum is a fascinating testament to the city's history."
