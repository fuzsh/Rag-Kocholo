        "text": "Sector and market opportunity\n\nLeicestershire and the East Midlands provide essential infrastructure and expertise at Space Park Leicester, creating a clear pipeline of opportunity in both upstream and downstream markets.\n\nThe region offers a location for satellite manufacturers and data businesses to collaborate and access customised data to fit business needs. Opportunity exists to increase market penetration through building better space data-driven products.\n\nSpace Park Leicester – at the heart of the UK – combines on-site downstream applications with on-site, upstream engineering.\n\nLocation\n\nThe East Midlands boasts a strong and vibrant space cluster with a broad range of capabilities.\n\nThe University of Leicester has helped to make the area one of the hot spots of national space activity since the 1960s, with a strong track record in flight instrumentation and upstream space technologies.\n\nThe region is home to 116 space companies, with over £100 million of investment into Space Park Leicester alone. Space Park Leicester is run by the University of Leicester with regional, national and international partners, including the National Space Centre, European Space Agency, Airbus and Thales Alenia Space. The centre also hosts the national headquarters of the NERC (National Environment Research Council)-funded National Centre for Earth Observation.\n\nConnectivity\n\nThe region has the UK’s second-largest freight airport (East Midlands Airport) with two international passenger airports less than an hour away.\n\nLeicestershire’s road network is well connected with easy access to the M1, M69 and M6.\n\nEast Midlands Freeport will focus on clean growth and multimodal connectivity. The key aims are to boost international trade in high-value manufacturing goods and to work with global industrial brands located regionally.\n\nLocal talent and skills\n\nMore than 200 academics are within the East Midlands Space sector.\n\nOver 20,000 students here are studying relevant subjects including physics and astronomy, mathematics, mechanical engineering and computer science.\n\nMidlands Innovation is a collaboration between 8 research-oriented universities, within which 3 regional higher-education institutes (Leicester, Loughborough and Nottingham) collaborate with counterparts in the West Midlands.\n\nResearch and expertise\n\nFrom fundamental research to commercialisation, Leicester and Leicestershire have everything to take your technologies from concept to market, including product accelerators ESA Business Incubation Centre (BIC) UK and the Space Commercialisation Engine from The Satellite Applications Catapult.\n\nSpace Park Leicester’s combination of facilities – including laboratories, workshops, cleanrooms, a concurrent design facility and a virtual reality cave – will provide an essential support infrastructure to those collaborating on research and development projects.\n\nCompanies based at Space Park Leicester will be plugged in to the UK’s wider space ecosystem including launch expertise in Scotland and Cornwall."
