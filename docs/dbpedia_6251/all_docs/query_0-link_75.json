In addition to showcasing the evidence, the CISO has been developed to be used as a live tool to help educators, businesses and citizens better understand the skills landscape in Leicester and Leicestershire, helping people to make better informed decisions in support of the LSIP’s goal.\n\nThe CISO, which also includes details of the Trailblazer and interim report, should be viewed alongside this document and can be accessed here:"
