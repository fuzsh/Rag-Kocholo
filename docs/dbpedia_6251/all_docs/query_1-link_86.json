Situated on the banks of the River Trent, Nottingham and its modern-day charms aren't only a top choice for aspiring students but also professionals and families looking for vibrant city life.\n\nWhat Makes Nottingham Unique?\n\nNottingham’s Popular Attractions\n\nNightlife In Nottingham\n\nSport In Nottingham\n\nFood In Nottingham\n\nShopping In Nottingham\n\nFestivals And Events In Nottingham\n\nCost Of Living In Nottingham\n\nGetting Around Nottingham\n\nExplore The UK From Nottingham\n\nPhoto credit: via Google\n\n1. What Makes Nottingham Unique?\n\nThe City Has A Huge Student Population\n\nDuring each academic year, more than 60,000 students attend the city's three biggest universities: the University of Nottingham, the University of Law and Nottingham Trent University.\n\nThis huge concentration of people under 30 makes Nottingham bustles with youth. And if you are currently in your 20s, it will be hard to run out of places to have fun with friends.\n\nInnovation Is Roots In The City's Spirit\n\nMany important inventions and ideas of our time can be traced back to Nottingham, including public water supply, traffic lights and video recorders, among others.\n\nHome Of English Sport\n\nVisitEngland named the city Home of English Sport following a campaign in 2015, underlining its contributions to the broader British sporting culture.\n\nNottingham has several renowned sportspeople and clubs associated with it, including legendary footballer Brian Clough, ice skaters Torvill and Dean and former European champions Nottingham Forest.\n\nThe Country's Geographic Heart\n\nNottingham is part of the East Midlands region, which has the best position to explore England in all directions. A trip to London doesn't take too much time, so do Manchester, Sheffield, Leicester and Birmingham.\n\nLinks To The Robin Hood Folklore\n\nModern Nottingham is alive and bustling, but the legend of Robin Hood is one of its biggest draws. Many venues and events in the city have borrowed the name of this hero to highlight the city's history.\n\nPhoto credit: via Google\n\n2. Nottingham’s Popular Attractions\n\nHockley\n\nOften dubbed as “the Soho of Nottingham”, this area in the city centre has been at the heart of its commercial and cultural life since the 13th century. With many clothes shops, galleries, restaurants, bars and well-preserved Victorian buildings, Hockley never fails to impress visitors with its charming atmosphere.\n\nThe Arboretum\n\nThis Green Flag-winning park is Nottingham's oldest public park and one of its green lungs. Generations of writers and artists have gotten inspiration from this serene space, be it the pleasing winter snowscapes or stunning springtime blossoms.\n\nWollaton Park\n\nThis huge park is another lovely choice for nature lovers. It hosts several historic buildings, is home to fallow deer and red deer and has served as the venue for many cultural events, including many iconic scenes in The Dark Knight Rises - the third instalment of the Batman film series directed by Christopher Nolan.\n\nCity of Caves\n\nThis extensive network of man-made caves sits deep below the city centre, offering one of the most unique and unforgettable experiences beyond anyone's wildest imagination.\n\nNottingham Castle\n\nThis historical building and former royal residence is a great starting place to have a grip on the city's remarkable history. Perched atop a small hill overlooking the Nottingham skyline, the castle also houses an art gallery and museum.\n\nPhoto credit: Ruben Ramirez via Unsplash\n\n3. Nightlife In Nottingham\n\nWith its young population, it doesn't come as a surprise Nottingham is an amazing place to have a night out, whether you are craving for a tranquil atmosphere or can't wait to dance to the loud dancing music in a club. Escape to one of the cocktail bars hidden in some quieter corners of Hockley if you need a new experience other than this area's bustling backstreets.\n\nThe city centre has plenty of places to energise your nights, ranging from karaoke bars, alternative clubs to multi-floor nightclubs. Start at the Rock City or Ocean, then head over to Pryzm. There is an abundance of choices to plan your night out.\n\nTraditional pubs are never out of fashion either. In fact, people of Nottingham often claim Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem at Brewhouse Yard to be the oldest inn in England.\n\nWhether you believe it or not, pay a visit, warm up your stomach with a pub meal and beer next to the fire, and you will understand why the locals treasure it so much. The Bell Inn and Ye Olde Salutation Inn are similar ancient refreshments if you continue to explore Nottingham's past.\n\nBut the real highlight here is the Purple Flag award the city has won for several years in a row. This achievement provides the clearest proof of its excellence in nightlife management.\n\nPhoto credit: Alliance Football Club via Unsplash\n\n4. Sport In Nottingham\n\nNottingham is a paradise if you are into sport. Watching, playing, or coaching - there is always a team, club, leisure centre, or grassroots facility you will be fond of. Football is a serious matter here in Nottingham and has always been. The city's two professional clubs - Nottingham Forest and Notts Country - both have important roles in the development of football in England. Located on opposite sides of the River Trent, Notts Country is the oldest professional football club in the world, while its local rival is two-time European champions.\n\nNottingham Rugby Club plays in the English's second-tier rugby union league, and the English National Basketball League (NBL) also has two competitors from the city.\n\nWater sports are thriving as well, with plenty of canoeing, rowing, water polo, swimming and sailing teams. If you want to try your hand at one of them, the National Water Sports Centre is just ten minutes from the city centre.\n\nPhoto credit: Louis Hansel via Unsplash\n\n5.

The diverse range of cuisines highlights the city's multicultural nature. Nottingham is bursting at the seams with exciting new tastes and flavours from all over the world, including American-style greasy burger joints, rustic Italian pizzerias and fabulous Thai food in bustling streets.\n\nThe independent food scene is thriving with its own personality as well.

Shopping In Nottingham\n\nDying for a dose of retail therapy? Nottingham is certainly a perfect place to cure your urge. With a thrilling blend of independent boutiques and high street shops, the city is a prime shopping destination of not just Nottinghamshire but also the East Midlands region.\n\nThe city centre benefits from its pedestrianised streets and compact size, where people can comfortably walk and check out different stores until they drop.\n\nDeveloped in the site of a former railway station, the Victoria Centre is Nottingham's main shopping centre. It can provide enough parking space for 2,400 cars and hosts several high street chain shops like House of Fraser and John Lewis as well as restaurants, cafes and a fitness centre. The Exchange is another prominent upmarket shopping outlet, mostly catering for women's fashion.\n\nDotted throughout the city are many hubs for independent shopping.

Meanwhile, you should mark the Film and Food Festival in your calendar if you love to enjoy live comedy, local street food and open-air cinemas.\n\nAnd there are also Goose Fair, the travelling funfair that dates back to several centuries, parades on St Patrick's Day, a British African-Caribbean carnival and celebrations of Holi - the Hindu spring festival.\n\nPhoto credit: Sharon McCutcheon via Unsplash\n\n8.
