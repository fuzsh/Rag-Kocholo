        "text": "Somewhat bludgeoned by the Luftwaffe during WWII, and rebuilt by city planners with a Brutalist streak, Leicester doesn’t often appear on lists of the UK’s most beautiful cities, so can easily get overlooked. But it’s big and lively, with an incredible history stretching back beyond the Romans. Our pick of the best places to stay in Leicester features a chic city centre hotel next to the cathedral and a stately mansion conversion on the outskirts of town.\n\nLeicester is where King Richard III was found under a car park — he’s since been reburied in the cathedral and has a rather beautiful visit centre; it has a castle, the National Space Centre, and the largest outdoor covered market in Europe. It also has ancient city walls, Roman ruins and a very healthy list of museums, galleries and arts centres.\n\nContemporary Leicester is also known for its shopping and food and drink culture. St. Martin’s Square and The Lanes are both elegant, and known for their boutiques and specialty shops, and there are several large shopping centres and malls too. Leicester has a vibrant Indian community, and the Golden Mile is a wonderful place to try Indian food — and to celebrate Diwali. All more great reasons to consider the best places to stay in Leicester for your next city mini break!\n\nThe Best Places to Stay in Leicester\n\nFor a City Break\n\nSt Martins Lodge has been converted from an elegant Grade II listed Georgian building, and is ideally located for a city break, in the centre of historic Leicester, overlooking the gardens of Leicester cathedral.
