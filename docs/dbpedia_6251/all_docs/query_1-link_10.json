        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nMany people will pass through the East Midlands to reach Yorkshire or South East England without ever stopping to explore the region. This means that they are missing out on experiencing six counties with a unique yet diverse culture, stunning natural scenery and a fascinating history.\n\nDespite being influenced by the culture of the region's northern and southern neighbours, the East Midlands has a distinct identity which also distinguishes it from the adjacent West Midlands. The historical basis for the region dates back to the 1st century AD when the territory of the Corieltauvi tribe roughly fit the boundaries of the current East Midlands. Similarly, the region corresponds with the territory of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw from the 10th century, which significantly influenced the distinct East Midlands accents heard today. The medieval legend of Robin Hood — who was based in Nottinghamshire's Sherwood Forest — is famous worldwide and, while the outlaw's historicity is fiercely debated, many in the region are proud of its association. East Midlands history dating back centuries can be seen in historic buildings across the region, ranging from the medieval Lincoln Cathedral to traditional stately homes such as Derbyshire's Chatsworth House or Nottingham's Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem, which claims to be Britain's oldest pub.\n\nStarting in the 18th century industrial development in the region helped the East Midlands to define itself as an industrial powerhouse, when the world's first mechanised factory was established in Cromford, Derbyshire, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The region became famous for lace produced in Nottingham's Lace Market district and steel produced in Corby while many communities were centered around the mining of coal, although the decline of industry in Britain has meant that the region has sought to redefine itself. Its location in the middle of the country and easy access to the M1 motorway means that logistics represent a growing proportion of the East Midlands economy today. As a largely agricultural region, it has also historically been known for its food, which is exported around the world. Visitors can enjoy popular produce from the region, such as red Leicester and stilton cheeses, Lincolnshire sausage, Melton Mowbray pork pie, and Bakewell tart and pudding.\n\nDespite a fierce pride of the East Midlands identity (as distinct from being 'Northern' or 'Southern'), visitors to the region will find significant diversity. While the East Midlands English dialect is common, significant variations exist across the region, often just miles apart from each other. Dialects, along with political attitudes and outlooks, are also influenced by location within the region, with considerable differences between rural agricultural areas and industrial/mining towns. At the same time, immigration into the region in the 20th century means that the distinctive culture of the South Asian communities is apparent in the cities, particularly Leicester. Strong rivalries also exist between the different cities, particularly with regard to football (Nottingham Forest and Derby County FC have a particularly strong rivalry).\n\nThe region's geography is also diverse, covering three major landscape areas: the relatively flat coastal plain of Lincolnshire to the east, the river valley of the Trent which contains the large cities, and the southern end of the Pennine hill range in western Derbyshire that makes up the Peak District National Park. Protection by the Pennines in the west means that the East Midlands is one of the driest regions of England.\n\nThis mixture of strong local identities, different cultures, extensive history, industrial heritage and stunning scenery make the East Midlands both a unique place to visit but also a microcosm of Britain off the beaten track. Within easy reach of London, the region offers the quaint English towns, villages and countryside that many visitors seek but it also provides an accurate representation of modern Britain outside of South East England while giving a glimpse of the country's famous industrial past, often at a cheaper price than other destinations in the UK.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nPublic transport in the East Midlands is reliable and frequent for intercity travel and for travelling to major towns. The network becomes less extensive when venturing into rural areas and car hire or taxis might be a more convenient option.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nThe region's intercity train network is extensive, meaning that travel between the main cities is easy. The exception is trains to/from Northampton, which is on the separate West Coast Mainline and thus requires a change in Birmingham New Street.\n\nFrom Nottingham: Direct trains to Lincoln, Leicester, Derby.\n\nFrom Leicester: Direct trains to Nottingham, Derby. For Lincoln, change in Nottingham.\n\nFrom Derby: Direct trains to Nottingham and Leicester. For Lincoln, change in Nottingham.\n\nFrom Lincoln: Direct trains to Nottingham. For Derby or Leicester, change in Nottingham.\n\nFrom Northampton: Change at Birmingham New Street for trains to Leicester, Nottingham or Derby.\n\nMost of the large towns and even some villages in the region are also located on the railway network, with direct access to one (or more) of the big cities.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the cities and towns, bus cities are generally extensive and are an inexpensive way of travelling throughout the city. As most cities don't have metro services, the bus is the primary form of public transport for most locals and this can mean that they are busy during the rush hour. Intercity buses are also available between most cities and large towns.\n\nIn rural areas, bus services are often the only public transport links available to most villages. Despite this, the rural services are often infrequent and may take a long route meaning that you will reach your destination slowly. In some cases, a village might only have one bus service per day. It may be more useful to get the bus as close as you can to your destination before ordering a taxi.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nThe East Midlands has an extensive road network, which is typically in good condition. Its location in the centre of the country means that several major motorways run through the region, making north-south travel particularly efficient. In many cases, it might be the case that travelling by car is faster than public transport and may be the only option when visiting the most rural areas. Be aware however, that car parking charges in city centres can be high. Car rental will be available in all the cities and from East Midlands Airport.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe region's industrial past means that there are a number of canals crossing the county. These provide the opportunity to travel via narrow boat, although this is typically done for enjoyment rather than for speedy movement. It is often possible to hire narrow boats in advance for a number of nights.\n\nDrink\n\n[edit]\n\nThe East Midlands is dotted with numerous traditional pubs, particularly in rural areas. In some cases, these can be hundreds of years old and Nottingham is one of many cities which claims to be home to the country's oldest pub (Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem was allegedly established in 1189). As with anywhere in the UK, the quality of pubs can vary greatly with some being particularly unpleasant while others could be mistaken for posh restaurants at the other end of the spectrum. Locals should be able to provide you with advice on which pubs are the best nearby, although bear in mind that a good pub for one person might mean a quiet place to enjoy a pint with friends while someone else wouldn't be happy if there wasn't loud music and a big crowd.\n\nPubs will often serve some local beers brewed in the East Midlands. Real ale is brewed across the region and some brands are exported internationally. While lager will typically remain consistent in a pub, the real ale often changes and many establishments have a different 'guest ale' each month. You can often ask for a small taste of an ale before committing to buying a full pint.\n\nPubs in the region have improved their food offering and many offer a full menu. While the quality of pub food will vary, in many places the village pub might be the best place around for a meal. This can range from a simple menu offering sandwiches chips to meals that wouldn't go amiss in a high quality restaurant.\n\nBars and nightclubs can be found in the cities and large towns. Although the 'clubbing' scene in some towns will consist of some fairly low quality nightclubs, the major cities are destinations in themselves for a night out with dancing and drinks. Nottingham is a particularly well known destination for those looking to frequent nightclubs, which are in abundant supply due to the two large universities in the city."
