        "text": "Business has grown faster in the East Midlands than any other English region this year, according to a Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) report.\n\nIts economy expanded by 4% in the last 12 months and it is one of only four regions where the economy has returned to pre-recession levels.\n\nLeicestershire's Local Enterprise Partnership said manufacturing was one reason for the region's success.\n\nUnemployment also fell faster than in any other region last year.\n\nThe RBS regional growth tracker for the past quarter said distribution and retail industries, which make up a fifth of the the region's economy, had contributed \"substantially\" to its success.\n\nThe economy is almost 4% bigger than a year ago - London's economy grew by 3.5% - and growing twice as fast as it was last year. A total of 104,000 jobs were created last year, it said.\n\nNorth Northamptonshire and Leicestershire and Rutland were the highest-performing areas in the East Midlands, which also includes Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire.\n\nHead of Leicester and Leicestershire's LEP said Mandip Rai said the region's economy was \"resilient\".\n\n\"We don't rely on one particular sector within manufacturing - there's a broad range,\" he said.\n\n\"Also being in the centre of the country helps us and having the largest cargo airport in the country in the region.\""
