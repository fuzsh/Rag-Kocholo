        "text": "Leicester is not as expensive as cities like London and Birmingham; however, you might consider getting a job. Many students find a job within the university as student ambassadors or university application mentors. Apart from gaining some relevant skills such as learning how to handle groups, working under pressure, and managing other students, you’ll gain some extra money that’ll help you to better enjoy your university experience.\n\nNeed a side-hustle with maximum flexibility? You could try part-time tutoring or becoming a web writer. Since the pandemic, opportunities to work remotely are now plentiful; the content creation and writing industry are always looking for people for just a few hours per week. According to The Balance (2022), the best platforms to find a job are Indeed (overall) and LinkedIn (best for connecting directly with recruiters). You can also check out StudentJob specifically for jobs suitable for students.\n\nLeicester, apart from its multiculturality and history, is one of the best cities to find work and has been recognised among the country’s start-up hotspots (Capital on Top), and we just know how important it is for you to get right into the world of work after you’ve graduated!"
