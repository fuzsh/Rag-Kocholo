        "text": "Eyam Hall, built in 1672, just six years after the plague in Eyam, is a wonderfully unspoilt example of a small Jacobean Manor House.\n\nHome of the Wright family for eleven generations, visitors can enjoy family portraits and furniture belonging to each generation. The craft centre in the Hall’s stable yard offers a vibrant hub from which to explore the wider village of Eyam and its captivating stories.\n\nHome to Lord and Lady Edward Manners, Haddon Hall is one of the country’s most elegant stately homes.\n\nHaddon invites visitors to immerse themselves in centuries of history, art and craftsmanship, and stroll around the Hall’s magnificent cascading gardens, enjoying uninterrupted views of the Peak District.\n\nAlthough steeped in history, Melbourne Hall retains a family feel and makes it one of the most fascinating visitor attractions in the area.\n\nOriginally the house was a 12th-century rectory owned by the Bishops of Carlisle, who worshipped in the magnificent Norman Parish Church adjacent to the Hall. Sir John Coke was the first member of the family to make his home at Melbourne, restoring parts of the house around 1628.\n\nHome to the Sitwell family for nearly 400 years. The famous literary trio, Edith, Osbert, and Sacheverell Sitwell were all patrons of the arts and played a significant part in the artistic and literary world at the beginning of the 20th-century.\n\nRenishaw is still very much a family home which adds to its unique atmosphere. Over 115 years ago Sir George Sitwell created what is today one of the most important classical Italianate gardens in Britain.\n\nTissington Hall was built in 1609 by Francis FitzHerbert to replace the moated fortification that guarded the Norman Church of St Mary’s in the centre of the village.\n\nFor over 400 years the Hall has presided over this picturesque Estate Village which is five miles north of the delightful market town of Ashbourne at the southern tip of the Peak District.\n\nCrowning a hill in rural Leicestershire, Belvoir Castle has been the home to the Duke of Rutland’s family since 1067. With extraordinary views the castle remains as one of the most magnificent and beautiful Regency houses in England.\n\nThe current family take great pleasure welcoming visitors and sharing its grand historic beauty which can be seen in the popular Netflix series ‘The Crown’ as it doubles up as Windsor Castle, as well as films such as ‘The Young Victoria’ and ‘Victoria & Abdul’ starring Judi Dench.\n\nRockingham Castle has stood on this wonderful escarpment position for almost 950 years. There are very few homes that have been owned by just one family since being relinquished as a royal Castle.\n\nWhether it is images of Knights in shining armour, a Tudor house, a Victorian home staffed with servants, or contemporary art, Rockingham has it all.\n\nStanford Hall was built in the time of William and Mary. It is surrounded by ancient parkland rich in natural history and beauty and a further 900 acres. We are a grade 1 listed private stately home that has been in the same family for over 300 years.\n\nIn the Hall, itself, we have a magnificent ballroom with a beautifully restored fresco ceiling and portraits of the Stuart Kings of England. There is also a splendid Norman church a short walk away through the park.\n\nWhatton House and Gardens has a sense of serenity and charm that draws you in.\n\nVisitors to our gardens and those who choose to celebrate their wedding day here never fail to be taken in by the welcoming and familiar feel of the gardens and the sense that Whatton is a much-cherished family home.\n\nBuilt and mostly designed by William Cecil, Lord High Treasurer to Queen Elizabeth I, between 1555 and 1587, the main part of the House has 35 major rooms on the ground and first floors.\n\nThere are more than 80 lesser rooms and numerous halls, corridors, bathrooms and service areas. The lead roof extends to three quarters of an acre, restoration and rebuilding of which began in 1983 and took nearly ten years to complete.\n\nDoddington is a much-loved family home, built between 1593 and 1600 by Robert Smythson for Thomas Tailor, who was a lawyer, the Recorder to the Bishop of Lincoln.\n\nVisitors are able to explore not only the Hall and Gardens but also the Bike Shop, Café, Restaurant, Coffee Shop, Home Store, Farrow & Ball and Country Clothing Store.\n\nSince 2001, Ursula and Fred Cholmeley have restored this ancient garden from an overgrown wilderness to the nationally important garden it once was.\n\nThe restoration continues year on year with innovative new planting schemes and currently includes herbaceous borders, roses, sweet peas, spring bulbs, cutflower and vegetable gardens set off by limestone buildings and surrounded by beautiful parkland.\n\nElsham Hall Gardens and Country Park offers beautiful lakeside gardens, a contemporary walled garden, an adventure playground and a variety of animals and birds.\n\nThe Walled Garden is a magnificent 4 acre site which has been excitingly re-landscaped. Originally a private garden for cultivating flowers, fruit and vegetables for the ‘big’ house it is now a contemporary garden to be enjoyed by all.\n\nGrimsthorpe Castle sits amongst rolling Lincolnshire countryside surrounded by gardens, extensive historic woodland and a 50-acre lake.\n\nDescendants of the deer that King Henry VIII hunted now roam the parkland, grazing under ancient oaks. Enjoy the chance to soak up the atmosphere and ‘Spirit of Place’ in a Castle that has been home to the same family since 1516 and is filled with fine furniture, paintings and tapestries.\n\nScawby Hall is a Grade 1-listed, Jacobean manor house that was first begun by Richard Nelthorpe (1569-1640) in 1603 and has been lived in by members of the Nelthorpe family ever since.\n\nThe house has been expanded and remodelled by successive generations. In 1792, upon the sale of Baysgarth Hall in Barton-upon-Humber, Scawby Hall became the main residence in Lincolnshire of the Nelthorpe family.\n\nAlthorp is a Grade I listed stately home and estate in the civil parish of Althorp, in Daventry District, Northamptonshire, England of about 13,000 acres. By road it is about 6 miles northwest of the county town of Northampton and about 75 miles northwest of central London.\n\nBoughton is both a family home and one of Britain’s grandest and best-preserved stately homes. The house is renowned for its outstanding collections of fine art, furniture, tapestries, porcelain and carpets.\n\nVisitors can view a magnificent range of paintings by great artists, including The Adoration of the Shepherds by El Greco, Gainsborough’s, more than forty grisailles and portraits by Van Dyck, and Breaking Cover by John Wootton to name but a few.\n\nCottesbrooke Hall is a fine red brick and stone Queen Anne house, begun in 1702. It contains English and Continental furniture and porcelain, and a renowned picture collection – particularly of sporting and equestrian subjects.\n\nIn the tranquil Wild Garden, laid out around a stream, you can enjoy wild flowers, specimen acers, bamboos and gunneras. The more formal gardens surrounding the Hall are a series of individually planted ‘rooms’.\n\nDeene Park has been the home of the Brudenell family for 500 years since 1514 and was the seat of the 7th Earl of Cardigan who led the Charge of the Light Brigade in 1854.\n\nThe house has grown in size as generations have made their own mark through the years, providing the visitor with an interesting yet complementary mixture of styles.\n\nOnce the largest private house in England and subsequently the palace of James I and prison of Charles I, Holdenby has appeared in the BBC’s acclaimed adaptations of Great Expectations and The Woman in White.\n\nSitting on a hill overlooking 2,000 acres of rolling countryside, its suite of elegant state rooms open onto beautiful Grade I-listed gardens making it an enchanting and ever popular venue for weddings.\n\nBuilt in 1732, successive owners and influences have left their imprint on this elegant Palladian style home.\n\nFrom noted antiquarian William Hanbury to banker and horse-racing enthusiasts Richard Naylor, each resident’s stories can be found within the hall; but none more so than Nancy Lancaster, ‘doyenne of the Country House style’ or the servants working and living ‘below stairs’ and in the laundry.\n\nSulgrave Manor was built in 1539 for Tudor wool merchant Lawrence Washington, a direct ancestor of George Washington, the future first President of the United States.\n\nIt remained in the ownership of the Washington family for only two generations, and was sold out of the family in 1659. Substantial alterations were made to the house in the 18th century and during the following century it was inhabited by a succession of tenant farmers.\n\nHolme Pierrepont Hall is the earliest brick building in Nottinghamshire, built by Sir William Pierrepont in 1500 and still lived in by his descendants.\n\nThe house is set in Parkland and Gardens, ten or so minutes from the middle of Nottingham, yet in a rural setting, as part of a hamlet that once was the centre of a large estate."
