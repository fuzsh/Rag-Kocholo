        "text": "LOS ANGELES: Actor Bill Nunn, known for his role in 1989 comedy-drama 'Do the Right Thing', has died. He was 62.\n\nFilmmaker Spike Lee, who directed 'Do The Right Thing', confirmed Nunn died yesterday, reported Us magazine.\n\n\"My Dear Friend, My Dear Morehouse Brother- Da Great Actor Bill Nunn As Most Of You Know Him As Radio Raheem Passed Away This Morning In His Hometown Of Pittsburgh,\" Lee, 59, wrote via Instagram.\n\n\"Long Live Bill Nunn. Radio Raheem is now resting in power. radio raheem will always be fighting da powers dat be. may god watch over Bill Nunn.\"\n\nThroughout Nunn's career, he starred in several iconic films, including 'Sister Act', 'New Jack City' and 'School Daze'. He also famously played Joseph 'Robbie' Robertson in the 'Spider-Man' trilogy directed by Sam Raimi.\n\nLee, who produced, wrote and directed 'Do the Right Thing', posted a second tribute to the late actor via Instagram, sharing one of Nunn's character Radio Raheem's most memorable quotes from the controversial 1989 film.\n\n\"Let me tell you the story of Right Hand, Left Hands. It's a tale of good and evil,\" the director wrote before adding, \"Raheem I love you bruh.\"\n\nRadio Raheem famously wore \"Love\" and \"Hate\" brass knuckles in \"Do the Right Thing\" as he carried a boombox (playing Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\") while walking around Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.\n\nNunn is survived by his wife, Donna, and their two children. A cause of death has yet to be released."
