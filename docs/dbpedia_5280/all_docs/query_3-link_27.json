        "text": "HOUSTON — Once upon a time, after graduating from Howard University, a San Diego Union editor told Jim Trotter that he \"would never be anything more than a journeyman.\" Then he crudely criticized the PFWA 2023 Bill Nunn Jr. Award winner saying that his \"writing lacked passion.\" He was wrong. A few years later, a new sports editor joined the newspaper and \"saw something in me and gave me an opportunity,\" Trotter noted. \"The rest is history.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Howard University Alumnus and former Pro Football Writers Association president, Jim Trotter, told me he was \"humbled\" when he was named the PFWA 2023 Bill Nunn Jr. Award recipient.\n\nTrotter recently joined The Athletic after several years at the NFL Network. He is the second black journalist to win the prestigious award in consecutive years — Jarrett Bell won in 2022.\n\n\"It's humbling to be truthful,\" Trotter reflected during our conversation after his nomination. \"I've never thought of myself in that vein or in that light if I can be 100% candid. I was thrilled when Jarrett Bell won the award and became the first black to win the award. I feel like there have been so many who have come before us [black journalists] who were deserving and never won the award. I'm speaking about people like Ralph Wiley, Brian Burwell, and Bill Rhoden. So when I saw JB [Jarrett Bell] win it, I was overjoyed. Hearing my name mentioned as a finalist and being in such a distinguished group is humbling, truthfully.\"\n\nSteve Wyche, Jim's friend and former colleague at the NFL Network commented, \"To think that his peers voted for Jim to receive the award speaks volumes about his work.\"\n\nTrotter had stiff competition from notable finalists, including a fellow Howard University alumnus D. Orlando Ledbetter of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \"Yeah, to have two Howard grads in there is phenomenal. So, I'm loving that,\" Trotter said. The other competitors were Mary Kay Cabot (Cleveland Plain Dealer), Barry Wilner (Associated Press), and Gary Myers (Author).\n\nOne primary element Trotter sought in his subsequent employment after the NFL Network was journalistic freedom. He explained, \"It's all free. It's a national columnist gig, which means I can write about whatever I want, whatever sport I want, and whatever topic I want. But look, my expertise is in the NFL. And so there will be a heavy focus on that. And there's no reason not to utilize the expertise, contacts, and things I have within the NFL. Truthfully, I've got some untold stories I want to tell as it relates to the NFL. So the beauty about the athletic and why I'm so excited besides the fact that I get to work with such a tremendous staff that I've known. The writers and editors that I've respected from afar for their careers. There is a freedom now to be able to pursue stories without interference from the NFL, and that's incredibly exciting and incredibly liberating. I look forward to doing the work.\"\n\nAccording to the PFWA, \"The Nunn Award is given to a reporter who has made a long and distinguished contribution to pro football through coverage. The award is named for Bill Nunn Jr., who prior to his Hall of Fame scouting career with the Pittsburgh Steelers, worked for 22 years at the Pittsburgh Courier, one of the most influential Black publications in the United States. Nunn, who started with the Courier as a sports writer in 1948, regularly covered HBCU events and athletes. He compiled the definitive Black College All-America team for the Courier starting in 1950. Nunn became the sports editor and later the paper's managing editor when the Steelers hired him as a part-time scout in 1966. He was hired as the Steelers' assistant director of player personnel in 1970, and he stayed with the organization as a scout and personnel executive until his death in 2014. Nunn helped build the Steelers' dynasty of the 1970s and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a contributor in 2021. The PFWA's award was renamed for Nunn in 2021.\"\n\nJim Trotter, an HBCU graduate from Howard University, finished with a broadcast communications degree in 1986.\n\nWinning the honor in many ways legitimizes Jim's fight against discrimination inside of media news organizations across the globe. He's never forgotten nor relinquished his HBCU roots. Also, he's always helped young journalists, never thumbing his nose down on those striving to make a name for themselves in the media.\n\nMany appreciate Jim Trotter. Once, when I was at a crossroads, he answered a DM, took my call, and made a difference in my career. We need more Jim Trotters."
