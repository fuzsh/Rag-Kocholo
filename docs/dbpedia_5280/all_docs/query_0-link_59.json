        "text": "D. Orlando Ledbetter, who writes about the Atlanta Falcons for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and has covered the NFL since the late 1980s, has been selected as the 2024 Bill Nunn Jr. Award winner by the Professional Football Writers of America (PFWA).\n\nLedbetter, the 56th Nunn Award honoree, is the first journalist who primarily worked at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution to win the award.\n\nThe Nunn Award is given to a reporter who has made a long and distinguished contribution to pro football through coverage. The award is named for Nunn, who prior to his Hall of Fame scouting career with the Pittsburgh Steelers, worked for 22 years at the Pittsburgh Courier, one of the most influential Black publications in the United States. Nunn, who started with the Courier as a sports writer in 1948, regularly covered HBCU events and athletes. He compiled the definitive Black College All-America team for the Courier starting in 1950. Nunn became the sports editor, and he was the paper’s managing editor when the Steelers hired him as a part-time scout in 1966. He was hired as the Steelers’ assistant director of player personnel in 1970, and he stayed with the organization as a scout and personnel executive until his death in 2014. Nunn helped build the Steelers’ dynasty of the 1970s, and he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a contributor in 2021. The PFWA’s award was renamed for Nunn in 2021.\n\nOther 2024 finalists for the Nunn Award were Mary Kay Cabot (Cleveland Plain Dealer), Vic Carucci (The33rdTeam.com/SiriusXM), Jeff Legwold (ESPN.com) and Barry Wilner (Associated Press).\n\nLedbetter joined the AJC in 2003, and he moved to the Falcons beat in 2005. During his time covering the Falcons, he was one of the lead writers in the AJC’s coverage of the Michael Vick dog fighting federal case in 2007 and described the Falcons run to the NFC title and a berth in Super Bowl LI. He also hosts a podcast for the AJC, the “Bow Tie Chronicles”.\n\nAmong his other professional honors, Ledbetter was selected as the 2022 Georgia Co-Sportswriter of the Year by the National Sports Media Association to go with three Associated Press Sports Editors writing awards and a PFWA Dick Connor Writing Awards category first-place honor while covering the Falcons and the NFL.\n\nPrior to Atlanta, Ledbetter spent eight years (1992-2000) at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, seven as a writer covering the Green Bay Packers, the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette University basketball, and his final year as a columnist for the newspaper.\n\nLedbetter worked for seven years (1985-92) with the Cincinnati Enquirer, covering the Cincinnati Bengals, Ohio State football and basketball and high school sports. He started his journalism career at the Charlotte Observer (1984-86), writing about high school athletics.\n\nDuring his time in Cincinnati, Ledbetter graduated with a Juris Doctorate from the University of Cincinnati College of Law in 1990. After moving to Milwaukee, he passed the State Bar of Wisconsin and became a practicing attorney while writing for the Journal Sentinel. He has also practiced law in the Atlanta area.\n\nHe is currently an adjunct professor at the University of Georgia’s Carmical Sports Media Institute, was an adjunct professor at Clark Atlanta University and he has lectured at the Marquette University National Sports Law Institute.\n\nLedbetter is a longtime member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee, including the Hall’s seniors selection committee. He served as the 26th president of the Pro Football Writers of America during the 2013-14 seasons.\n\nBorn in St. Louis, Ledbetter graduated from Howard University in 1984 with a degree in journalism.\n\n“I am honored and humbled to be named as the Nunn Award winner this year, and it is always wonderful to be cited by a group of your peers. As a product of a HBCU at Howard, it is a particular pleasure to me to receive an award named for Bill Nunn Jr.,” Ledbetter said. “It has been an honor to serve the Pro Football Writers of America as a vice president, president and member of the board over the past several years. It is a joy to cover the NFL along with the people and stories that make the game what it is today. I look forward to receiving this award in Canton, and share my joy with my family, friends, co-workers and fellow NFL writers.”\n\n“This award affirms what we in Atlanta have known for years,” said Leroy Chapman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution editor-in-chief. “Darryl is an extraordinary talent and a first-rate journalist. He belongs in Canton.”\n\nLedbetter will be honored by the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio later this summer.\n\nBILL NUNN JR.
