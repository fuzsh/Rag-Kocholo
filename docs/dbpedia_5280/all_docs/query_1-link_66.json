He loved each and every one of them with his whole heart, and he made sure they all knew it.\n\nHis hobbies included fishing, boating, and a good BBQ.\n\nBilly had a passion for caring for his beloved dog, Bear. If you saw Billy somewhere, Bear was always close by.\n\nHe loved stepping up and caring for family, especially his wife, Louise. She was his whole world, and he was hers. Anyone who knew them knew that. He referred to Louise as his “Angel” and that’s how she was named in his phone. He loved being married to her, and he was never afraid to show it.\n\nBilly taught us all a lot about unconditional love and support. Family meant the world to him. The one thing he didn’t teach us is how to live in this world without him.\n\nUntil we meet again…. I love you more!"
