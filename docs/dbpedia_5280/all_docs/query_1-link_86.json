        "text": "by Lawrence Vos (@NFLFANINENGLAND)\n\nEven seven years after leaving us, one man still managed to break new ground in 2021, becoming the first black person to gain a place in the hallowed halls of Canton as as a non-playing or non-coaching contributor.\n\nWhen Tom Brady earned his third Super Bowl winners ring in 2005 this same man already had accumulated six Super Bowl rings, stored somewhere safe.\n\nThis person, immensely gifted as an athlete, turned down the offer to be a member of the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team, instead opting to use a pen and a typewriter as his tools instead of a basketball and a pair of Chuck Taylor’s.\n\nHis siblings have gone on to have incredible influential lives in their own right. One was an actor who appeared in ‘Spiderman (2002)’, ‘Sister Act’ and Spike Lee’s iconic ‘Do The Right Thing’, and another used to be a U.S. Attorney.\n\nWithout this particular gentleman it is genuinely debatable if the Pittsburgh Steelers became the ‘Team of the 1970s’, a franchise that won four Super Bowls in six years.\n\nWilliam Goldwyn Nunn Jr, better known as Bill Nunn Sr, didn’t play a snap for the Steelers nor did he call a single play, yet without his foresight and insight there would likely be less pressure on the shelves of the Black and Gold’s trophy cabinet.\n\nHis career journey is akin to a black Forest Gump, having touched the lives of millions, without ever truly realising his own overwhelmingly significant contribution to the historic breaking down of societal and sporting segregation.\n\nThe beginning\n\nBill was born in Homewood, Pennsylvania, now a predominantly African-American Pittsburgh neighbourhood, in 1924.\n\nGrowing up his father William G Nunn Sr was the managing editor at the Pittsburgh Courier, a black owned and run newspaper, that in the 1920s, had a weekly circulation of 55,000.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Courier was founded in 1910 by Edward Nathaniel Harleston. Harleston had moved from Atlantic City three years earlier and had started to write, print and circulate a news sheet, one of the first African-American papers of its kind in North America. At its peak in the 1940s the Courier was selling 350,000-400,000 copies a week and had 14 regional editions across the USA.\n\nAs well as being the managing editor Nunn Sr was a sports reporter, famously covering the rise of boxer Joe Louis in the 1930s.\n\nThe love of sports, equal rights, and journalism were all rife in Nunn’s childhood, and with such a strong role model at home it was inevitable he would explore a combination of those worlds as he turned from a boy to a man.\n\nNunn attended Westinghouse High School, a place that now sees his and his father’s face displayed proudly on the school’s Wall of Fame. Both were enshrined in 2009 for their services to arts and entertainment.\n\nA gifted athlete, Nunn was an excellent football and basketball player, and he and high-school team-mate Chuck Cooper both went on shoot hoops for the University of West Virginia State Yellow Jackets. Nunn captained the 1948 basketball team to a 26-0 record, the only undefeated team in the country, but he was unable to fight for a national title.\n\nFrom the early 1930s until 1959, as part of a segregated society, black high schools were barred from competition in the West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission, so WVSU sponsored their own unofficial ‘state colored championship’ during that period.\n\nRemarkably Nunn’s high-school team-mate Chuck Cooper became the first African American to be drafted in the NBA (14th pick to the Boston Celtics in 1950) and his college team-mate Earl Lloyd was the first African American to play in the NBA, on Halloween in 1950. Lloyd went on to become only the second black coach in NBA history.\n\nHaving impressed in college Nunn was given the opportunity to tour with the Harlem Globetrotters or sign with the New York Knicks (which at the time was all-white), but instead elected to follow his father into the noble art of journalism, joining the Pittsburgh Courier as a sports reporter.\n\nHe had spent his early youth getting a taste for news gathering and distribution, both as a paper boy and a ‘fly-boy’, wriggling underneath the giant presses at the Pittsburgh Courier to muck out excess ink.\n\nNunn worked his way up from sports reporter to editor to managing editor at the Courier, taking the mantle from his father when he retired in the mid 60s.\n\nThe road to the top job was not without struggles, that today would be seen as undoubted racism. Having shunned playing sports, as part of his reporting role in the late 40s, Nunn would attend Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games as part of the press gang.\n\nIn April 1947 Jackie Robinson had broken the colour barrier, becoming the first black player to start a Major League Baseball game, but at that time Nunn was not allowed to sit in the press box. It was not until May 1950, and only on the condition that the road team fielded a black player, was he allowed to integrate in the Pirates press room. The Pirates team at the time had no black players.\n\nForging links with the Steelers\n\nBill Nunn was only 9 years old when the Pittsburgh Pirates football team was born, the team that went on to become the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1940 (and even the Steagles in 1943 during WWII).\n\nThe Steelers first black player, Ray Kemp, #88, suited up in the team’s inaugural season in 1933, having been coached in college by Elemer Layden, one of legendary coach Knute Rockne’s ‘Four Horsemen’. Kemp, one of only two black players in the NFL in 1933 was cut during the season, became a steel mill worker, and was then recalled by owner Art Rooney following 5 losses in 7 games.\n\nPrior to the 1970s the Steelers were historically a pretty awful team, registering zero division titles, achieving only eight winning seasons between 1940 and 1970, and just one playoff game, a 21-0 loss to the Eagles in 1947.\n\nThree years after that brief flirt with the post season, Steelers fans who read the Pittsburgh Courier in 1950, when Nunn’s birthplace of Homewood was 22% black, the paper began a ‘Black College All-American Team’, recognising those black football players who were woefully under represented in mainstream newspapers.\n\nAs the likes of Babe Parilli and Les Richter (a guard/linebacker/kicker who went on to become a Hall of Fame enshrined himself in 2011) were gaining recognition in 1950 in newspapers across the land, equally gifted athletes were being snubbed because they were black.\n\nOriginally selected by his father, the Courier’s Black College All-American Team, credited players from HBCUs (historically black colleges and universities), giving future NFL players perhaps their only opportunity to appear in print as part of an All-Star team.\n\nBy the 1960s, when six in every 10 Homewood residents was black, Bill Nunn took over the responsibility from his father of selecting the Courier’s All-Star team, meaning he would travel 15,000 miles a year to watch prospects, suffering from segregation in hotels in the South, often having to stay with team presidents.\n\nHaving done this for most of the 60s Nunn helped to raise the profile of college football players such as Art Shell from the then named Maryland State College. Shell went on to be drafted by the Oakland Raiders, and also became the first black head coach in the modern era of the NFL, along with a place in Canton.\n\nNunn even scouted and wrote about a guy called Ed Tomlin, a talented halfback who was selected in the 10th round of the 1968 NFL draft by the Baltimore Colts. Ed ended up signing with the Montreal Allouettes of the CFL where he played just one season, scoring two tds and a kicked extra point.\n\nEd may not have moved mountains as a professional, but his son Mike, has, as he is the current head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers. ( Just on a side note we wish Mike a speedy recover from Covid-19).\n\nWith Nunn watching, timing, talking to and writing about black college football players, his network of contacts spun out like a giant spiders web across campuses and locker rooms throughout the country.\n\nIn 1967, sick of reading stories of excelling black college football players and opinion shared by Bill Nunn in the Pittsburgh Courier’s sports pages, Dan Rooney, son of Steelers founder Art Rooney, approached Nunn to see if he would like to join the team as a part-time scout.\n\nAfter initially declining the offer made br Rooney, By 1969 Nunn was full-time, and in 1970 he was the Steelers Assistant Personnel Director.\n\nBuilding a dynasty\n\nBetween 1972 and 1979 the Pittsburgh Steelers won fourteen playoff games and four Super Bowls, in a span of just six years. The NFL’s first ever post-merger dynasty, and still to this day a team that is synonymous with 70s football, the Steelers personified an industrial era of steel workers, dirt under your finger nails, lost teeth, hard hitting and no-nonsense play.\n\nThe 70s Steelers were built on the foundations of their ability to draft outstanding prospects year after year, a strategy that went on to yield the greatest single set of selections ever in 1974, when four Pittsburgh picks all eventually wound up in the Hall of Fame.\n\nThose drafts were heavily influenced and orchestrated by Bill Nunn, who used his knowledge, his connections and his sheer will to make the Steelers draft players from HBCUs, when other NFL teams were not.\n\nSome of the examples of Nunn’s draft gems include:\n\nJohn Stallworth – 1974 Draft – Round 4 from Alabama A&M\n\nWR – 4 x Super Bowl winner and Hall of Fame inductee (2002)\n\nStats – 8,723 yards 63 touchdowns\n\nMel Blount – 1970 Draft – Round 3 from Southern\n\nCB – 4 x Super Bowl winner and Hall of Fame inductee (1989)\n\nStats – 57 interceptions and place on NFL 100th Anniversary team\n\nDonnie Shell – 1974 undrafted free agent from South Carolina State\n\nS – 4 x Super Bowl winner and Hall of Fame inductee (2020)\n\nStats – 51 interceptions and 201 career games\n\nL.C. Greenwood – 1969 Draft – Round 10 from Arkansas AM&N\n\nDE – 4 x Super Bowl winner\n\nStats – 170 games and 1970s NFL All-Decade Team\n\nDwight White – 1971 Draft – Round 4 from East Texas State\n\nDE – 4 x Super Bowl winner\n\nStats – Scored the first ever Steelers Super Bowl points – a safety.\n\nThe list goes well beyond the names above, but the thread that brings these particular legends together is that they all played college ball in historic black colleges. Colleges Bill Nunn visited, and travelled in the back of coaches to get there. Colleges that did not get the opportunity to play against teams they could have beaten but were not allowed to compete against.\n\nBill Nunn makes more history\n\nBill Nunn never got to wear the yellow Pro Football Hall of Fame jacket when he was alive, as he passed away in May 2014.\n\nThe NFL was late in recognising Nunn for his contribution to the rich historical tapestry of the league. The Pro Football Hall of Fame established the ‘non-playing’ contributor category way back in 1963, 58 years later, in 2021, Bill Nunn became the first black contributor to be enshrined.\n\nIt was not until 2014 that the Hall of Fame selectors moved the contributor category outside of the same grouping at the modern-era finalists, otherwise it is likely Nunn would have been recognised at an earlier point we hope.\n\nNFLFANINENGLAND spoke to one of the Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee members, famed investigative reporter and author, Jason Cole, just before the NFL Class of 2021 was announced.\n\nJason explained: “Fortunately we have this contributors category which we have leaned on heavily in the past few years that differentiates a person who has been a referee, a scout, an owner, or a league executive.\n\n“Bill Nunn is this transcendent figure in the league that people don’t know about in the league because he worked in the trenches going to find players.\n\n“As a reporter he covered historical black colleges like Grambling and Howard University. He would pick out the All-Star teams because he thought these players deserved as much attention as ones on white teams like Alabama and Mississippi and Florida. He did a lot to promote these players so they got the attention.\n\n“At a certain point he went to the Rooney family that owned the Steelers and said ‘you aren’t paying attention – you need to do more of this. They said he was right and said ‘do you want to scout for us?”\n\nFrom 1967, right up to his passing in 2014, Bill Nunn remained with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Rooney family. Whilst his formal director role went away in the late 80s, Nunn remained a scout for the Black and Gold until he was no longer with us, still coming to the stadium to help new players and give advice to the personnel directors in his late 80s.\n\nThere will never be another Bill Nunn, because there will never be another 1970s.\n\nWe know that society in America is still not on an equal footing, despite experiencing a black President, a first female black vice President and the eradication of blatant segregation in hotels, in press rooms and on public transport.\n\nWithout the foresight of Dan Rooney inviting Bill Nunn to bring his generations of football knowledge to the Steelers organisation it is doubtful the Steelers have six Vince Lombardi Trophies.\n\nTo be the man who scouted the father of the first black Steelers head coach way back in the 60s is remarkable, and for the Nunn family, seeing their father or grandfather in the Hall of Fame is far more than a bronze bust, it is recognition of a man who helped shape professional football without waving money at it, without the use of social media, and without the majority of the football elite behind him.\n\nBill Nunn may you rest in peace knowing you were a pioneer.\n\nIf life is indeed, a box of chocolates, Bill Nunn is the smoothest caramel, coated in the finest chocolate, wrapped in a casing of diamond encrusted (black and) gold."
