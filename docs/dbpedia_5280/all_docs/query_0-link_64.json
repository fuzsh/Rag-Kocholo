        "text": "William \"Billy\" Nunn Jr. (1948-2024)\n\nIn the halls of music history, the keys have lost their maestro as William \"Billy\" Nunn Jr., famed organist, songwriter, and producer, bid his final adieu on March 9, 2024, in Las Vegas, NV. Born on June 15, 1948, in the vibrant city of Buffalo, NY, Billy's life was an opus of laughter, love, and unforgettable melodies. Billy was preceded in death by his beloved parents, William Nunn Sr. and Helen Ross Nunn.\n\nBilly's journey into the realm of music began with a serendipitous encounter with the organ during his senior year at Hutchinson Central Technical High School in 1966. Inspired by the legendary Jimmy Smith's \"A Walk on the Wild Side,\" he embarked on a musical odyssey that spanned continents and genres.\n\nA true son of Buffalo, Billy's roots ran deep in the city's musical soil. His father's establishment, Jan's Supper Club, echoed with the sounds of jazz legends, igniting Billy's passion for rhythm and blues. From the streets of Buffalo to the stages of the world, Billy's fingers danced across the keys, leaving behind a trail of unforgettable melodies.\n\nBilly's talents found a home in the Stone City Band, where he collaborated with icons like Rick James, co-writing hits like \"Mary Jane\" that etched their place in the annals of music history. His virtuosity graced albums, stages, and screens, earning him accolades and adoration wherever he went. Beyond the glitz of Hollywood and the neon lights of Las Vegas, Billy remained a Buffalo boy at heart. His return to his roots was not just a homecoming but a testament to the enduring spirit of his beloved city.\n\nIn his final years, Billy continued to enchant audiences with his soulful performances, weaving magic with each note. Whether it was the smooth jazz of the West or the vibrant rhythms of the East, Billy's music transcended boundaries, touching the hearts of all who listened.\n\nLeaving behind a legacy woven with love and laughter, Billy is survived by his loving wife, Beverley Jelks Nunn of North Las Vegas, NV, who stood by his side through every note played and every melody composed. His brother, Robert W. (Ingrid) of West Hills, CA, remains a steadfast companion in both joy and sorrow, a testament to the enduring bond of brotherhood.\n\nIn his extended family, Billy was blessed with the love and support of his father-in-law, Daniel Jelks (preceded in death), and Lula Jelks of Buffalo, NY. His step-children, Melvin Damone Garrett (preceded in death) and Kimberly (Delando) Prince, carry forward his legacy of love and music.\n\nAmong his relatives, Billy's brother-in-laws, Danny and Richie Lamar, and sister-in-laws, Sheila (Donald) and Linda (Romeo), stand as pillars of strength and solidarity. His nieces, La Trisa, Tigre Nicole, Crystal, and Ameenah (Dean), and nephews, Robert Jr. and Daniel Jelks III, will forever cherish his memory.\n\nIn the lineage he nurtured, Billy's grandchildren, Emani, DeShawn, Elijah, Prince, Kendrick, Eva, Isaiah, and TJ, reflect his enduring love and devotion. His great nieces, Markita, Jaedyn, Khalia, Embry, and Leilani, and great nephews, Imari Sr, Christopher Jr, and Khiry, carry forward his legacy with pride and reverence.\n\nIn addition to his earthly family, Billy was embraced by his God-family: Josyah (Jen), Kelley, and Kaja. Their bond, forged through faith and friendship, remains a testament to the power of love and kinship.\n\nIn the words of the maestro himself, \"LOVE LIFE, IT'S SHORT.\" Indeed, but his life was a melody, sweet and fleeting, but oh so beautiful. Your music will live on forevermore."
