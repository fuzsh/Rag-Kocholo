        "text": "History was made the evening of February 6, when Bill Nunn officially was announced as a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s Class of 2021.\n\nNunn, already a trailblazer in a career that spanned over five decades with the Pittsburgh Steelers, became the first Black elected to the Hall in the Contributor category.\n\nA graduate of a Historically Black College and University, West Virginia State, Nunn’s enshrinement will come the same weekend as one of the men he is credited with finding for the Steelers in his role as a scout: Donnie Shell.\n\nShell was a standout of South Carolina State, one of the many HBCUs where Nunn cultivated relationships that paid off in the Steelers drafting or signing players other organizations were overlooking. He was a free agent signee for Pittsburgh in the same year the Steelers, under Nunn’s guidance, drafted Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, John Stallworth and Mike Webster – far and away the most productive draft in National Football League history by one team.\n\nWatch 'The Knock' for Bill Nunn's Family:\n\nNunn’s accomplishment in reaching the Pro Football Hall of Fame is merely the latest in a long list of historical firsts for Blacks in professional football.
