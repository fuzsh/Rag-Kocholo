        "text": "The Nunn-Wooten Scouting Fellowship, created by the NFL in January 2015, exposes interested and qualified candidates to a career in professional scouting.\n\nThe program will give participants a unique glimpse into Player Personnel by introducing them to various areas related to college and pro scouting within a club.\n\nFormer collegiate and professional football players have a unique understanding of the characteristics shared by athletes who succeed in the sport. They often have an ideal skill set for evaluating future NFL players.\n\nThe fellowship, named in honor of Bill Nunn, longtime personnel director for the Pittsburgh Steelers, and John Wooten, a former NFL player and front-office executive, is part of the NFL’s Football Development program under NFL Football Operations.\n\n“The Nunn-Wooten Scouting Program offers a unique opportunity for former players to learn more about this important profession,” said Troy Vincent, the NFL’s Executive Vice President of Football Operations. “Scouting is a critical function for all NFL teams. Identifying talent and building rosters strategically are keys to every team’s success.”\n\nThe NFL recognizes that both former college and professional players bring a unique drive and passion to the game. Helping former players succeed after their playing careers end — whether they stay in football or follow another path — gives back to those who make the sport great and strengthens the game for future generations, ensuring that football remains a vibrant aspect of American culture. Additionally, those who have exposure evaluating and recruiting players at the college level possess key transferable knowledge that will help them transition to an NFL personnel office.\n\nApplicants must meet one of the following prerequisites to be considered for the fellowship:\n\nFormer NFL player\n\nFormer college football player\n\nCurrent college football employee working in recruiting/personnel\n\nThe Process: Applicants will fill out the online application and select the top 5 NFL clubs they have an interest in completing a fellowship with. Clubs will be alerted of the application submission and will reach out to the applicant individually for further steps if they so choose.\n\nTiming: Most fellowships take place during Training Camp (July-August) and the length of the fellowship ranges from a few days to a few weeks. In select cases, clubs have extended a fellow to work on staff with them for a year."
