        "text": "Bill Nunn, the towering actor best known for his role as Radio Raheem in Spike Leeâ€™s Do the Right Thing, is reported to have died aged 63.\n\nDirector Spike broke the news on Instagram , seemingly being the first to confirm that Nunn had passed away, and paid a touching tribute.\n\nAccording to reports, Big Bill, as he was known to some friends for his 6ft 3in height, died in his hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nSpike commented: \"My Dear Friend, My Dear Morehouse Brother- Da Great Actor Bill Nunn As Most Of You Know Him As Radio Raheem Passed Away This Morning In His Hometown Of Pittsburgh.\n\n\"Long Live Bill NUNN. RADIO RAHEEM Is Now RESTING IN POWER. RADIO RAHEEM WILL ALWAYS BE FIGHTING DA POWERS DAT BE.\"\n\nHe concluded the message by adding: \"MAY GOD WATCH OVER BILL NUNN.\" Spike and Bill both were Morehouse College alumni, with Nunn graduating in 1976.\n\nBill's career span nearly 30 years and although his boom box carrying Radio Raheem has become iconic, he also acted opposite big screen greats including Al Pacino, in Lockdown, and Whoopi Goldberg in Sister Act.\n\nFans of Wesley Snipes' New Jack City will remember him as the Duh Duh Duh Man playing the personal bodyguard to Nino Brown.\n\nNunn's talents also saw him take on Broadway with a 2004 turn in Raisin In The Sun with Sean 'Puff Daddy' Combs and Audra McDonald.\n\nHe diversity knew no bounds as he recently displayed his comedic side in the television sitcom Sirens having previously starred in comedy drama The Job with Denis Leary.\n\nAs well as having a pivotal role in Do the Right Thing, Bill also starred in Sister Act, and made the role of Joseph 'Robbie' Robertson his own in the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man trilogy.\n\nIn a later post, Spike shared a small part of Radio Raheem's now legendary speech in Do the Right Thing.\n\nHe wrote: \"Radio Raheem. Let me tell you the story of Right Hand, Left Hand. It's a tale of good and evil. Hate! It was with this hand that Cane iced his brother. Love! These five fingers, they go straight to the soul of man. The right hand: the hand of love.\n\n\"The story of life is this: static. One hand is always fighting the other hand, and the left hand is kicking much ass. I mean, it looks like the right hand, Love is finished. But hold on, stop the presses the right hand is coming back.\n\n\"Yeah, he got the left hand on the ropes, now, that's right. Yea, Boom, it's a devastating right and Hate is hurt, he's down. Ooh! Ooh! Left-Hand Hate KOed by Love. If I love you, I love you. But if I hate you...Mookie: there it is, Love and Hate. Raheem I love you bruh...\"\n\nRadio Raheem dies from a police chokehold in the film, and the scene echoed many experiences in black neighbourhoods at the time which even today still feel similar with the Black Lives Matter movement highlighting the struggle.\n\nNunn helped establish the August Wilson Monologue competition in Pittsburgh, where students performed to win acting scholarships.\n\nBill is survived by his wife, Donna, and their two children.\n\nAlthough no cause of death has been made public yet, in his later years, he could be seen walking with a cane."
