        "text": "Alumni Theater Company's new location is at 6601 Hamilton Ave., just off Washington Blvd. at the border between Homewood and Larimer. The entrance is in the back of the building on Kelly St.\n\n​\n\nNote that the section of Kelly St. at our building does not connect to Kelly St. in Homewood. Note also that Torrens St. is one-way between Hamilton & Frankstown Rd.\n\n​\n\nThere is plenty of street parking nearby, particularly nights and weekends.\n\n​\n\nThe theater is very transit accessible. Routes with nearby stops include: P10, P17, 71 C, 71D, 75, 77, 86, 88.\n\nWilliam Goldwyn “Bill” Nunn III\n\nOctober 20, 1952 - September 24, 2016\n\nBill Nunn is an American actor. Born in Pittsburgh, his best-known role is Radio Raheem in Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing. Bill graduated from Schenley High School in 1970 and Morehouse College in 1976.\n\nIn 2007, Bill returned to Pittsburgh to give back. Through the Bill Nunn Theatre Outreach Project, he provided thousands of underserved students access to theatre arts training with seasoned professionals and brought the August Wilson Monologue Competition to Pittsburgh.\n\nBill believed in Alumni Theater Company. He gave us his talent, time, praise and no-holds-barred, down-to-earth advice. Bill inspired and mentored us. He taught us to be Wilsonian soldiers, to be role models to our peers, and to let a performance “sauté on their ass”.\n\nWe proudly fill this theater with work that commemorates his vibrant, tough, honest, demanding, kind and loving spirit.\n\nRenting the ATC Space\n\nOur theater is delighted to offer its versatile space for rental, accommodating a wide range of events including corporate meetings, private gatherings, and small to mid-sized events. Whether you're looking to host a workshop, seminar, or even a special celebration, our venue provides a unique and inspiring setting.
