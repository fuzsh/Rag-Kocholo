        "text": "Who can forget Radio Raheem? His peaceful, charismatic persona is one for the books. But today, we say goodbye to longtime actor Bill Nunn, who died this morning in his Pittsburgh home, reports the NY Daily News.\n\nThe news broke when good friend Spike Lee announced Nunn’s death via Facebook with a post that read, “My Dear Friend, My Dear Morehouse Brother- Da Great Actor Bill Nunn As Most Of You Know Him As Radio Raheem Passed Away This Morning In His Hometown Of Pittsburgh. Long Live Bill NUNN.”\n\nThe two met during their school days at Morehouse College.\n\nSince revealing the news around 2:00 pm EST, Lee has since shared several posts if remembrance of his “dear friend,” both on and off the screen. The film director’s second post eloquently honored Nunn by reciting Raheem’s famous “Love/Hate” monologue. Lee’s third and most recent post shares a poem about Radio Raheem by American poet Lemon Andersen.\n\nWANT MORE FROM ESSENCE?
