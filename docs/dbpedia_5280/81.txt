Actor William Nunn III, also known as Bill Nunn, has passed away, according to an Instagram post by his friend and longtime collaborator, Spike Lee.

He has died in his hometown of Pittsburgh, at the age of 62. Through his life Nunn has acted in several notable films, including New Jack City, Sister Act, Money Train and the first three installments of the Spider-Man franchises.

However, he will likely be best remembered for the roles that he had played in films directed by Lee. They went to the same college and through that time they have made their mark together in films like School Daze, Mo Better Blues and He Got Game.
