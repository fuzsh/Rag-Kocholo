        "text": "'And the Academy Award for Best Actor goes to ... \"\n\nEvery year, this sentence is completed with the name of a talented performer for an excellent acting job. But isn't necessarily the BEST actor who wins. Most movie critics ignore the fact that the Academy is nothing but a large group of Hollywood insiders who vote for the winner, making the Awards more political in nature than merit-based. Sort of like Congress, or the Presidency.\n\nMost years, the Academy does a decent job of choosing nominees and electing a winner. This year, the winner was Sean Penn in \"Milk,\" beating the acting powerhouses Frank Langella, Richard Jenkins, Mickey Rourke and (cough cough) Brad Pitt. Like I said, most years they do a good job choosing nominees.\n\nNow \"Milk\" is fresh on DVD, and we all have the opportunity to study his performance and decide if the Academy made the right choice, or if they were just being politically correct.\n\nPenn stars as Harvey Milk, a gay man who comes out of the closet with such force he immediately becomes an activist, and seeks to change the way the country views and treats gays and lesbians. Milk is not a movie character but was a real-life revolutionary who became the first openly gay man elected to a major public office.\n\n\"Milk\" is part drama, part social commentary and part history lesson. For those youngsters who think America today is intolerant of gays, this movie will come as a sharp slap to the face, because Milk really made a huge impact in the legal - and social - status of gays.\n\nPenn is surrounded by a smart, talented cast including Emile Hirsch, Joseph Cross, James Franco, Victor Garber and Josh Brolin (who turns in his third stunning performance in two years, after \"W\" and \"No Country for Old Men,\" and who cements his place as one of the great actors in the business). Together, they weave a delicate drama that works on every level.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is definitely a movie with a message, but the message never gets in the way of the movie. Some movies get too preachy but \"Milk\" is confident in itself and knows the story speaks loud and clear; and no preaching is necessary.\n\n\"Milk\" is great and Penn is great in it, but how does he stack up to the best Best Actors of all time? Well, as good as he is, his performance isn't the type that knocks you off your seat. Twenty years from now, people won't look back and think that his acting changed the way they watched movies. It may change the way you view gay men, but it isn't one of the best acting jobs ever recorded.\n\nAnd so who are the best Best Actor winners of all time? Here's a have a list for your perusal.\n\n5. George C. Scott in \"Patton\": In a famous Oscar moment, Scott refused this award - but that doesn't mean he didn't deserve it. As Gen. George S. Patton, Scott is a fiery, scenery-chewing force of nature. Truly an awe-inspiring piece of work.\n\n4. Anthony Hopkins in \"The Silence of the Lambs\": Based on his screen time, Hannibal Lecter should have been considered a supporting character. But the raw power of Hopkin's performance turned the cannibal into a legendary, iconic figure.\n\n3. Gregory Peck in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\": If the words \"Atticus Finch\" don't make your heart skip a beat, then you've never seen this amazing Peck performance. This film truly embodies the best and worst of what America is all about, and should be seen by everyone - not just because you're a student trying to avoid reading the book for class.\n\n2. Marlon Brando in \"On the Waterfront\": Brando won another Oscar for \"The Godfather\" but as good as that role is, it doesn't compare to his work in this film. Searing and unforgettable, this is truly one of the best acting jobs in movie history.\n\n1. Robert De Niro in \"Raging Bull\": Arguably the best performance by anyone ever, this is the movie that aspiring actors need to study to learn what acting really is all about. De Niro has led an amazing career but playing Jake Lamotta may be his finest hour.\n\nWhen it comes to the Best Actor award, there are some very high standards involved. The following are the guys who I think never should have won the Oscar - it doesn't mean the performance was terrible. In fact, most of these acting jobs were good. But \"good\" isn't good enough to be called the best of the year now is it?\n\n5. Russell Crowe in \"Gladiator\": Crowe is a good actor and \"Gladiator\" was a decent action movie. But how he got nominated for his one-note performance is puzzling. Perhaps it was his chiseled good looks. If this role is good enough for an Oscar, however, so is Daniel Craig as James Bond, or Sylvester Stallone as Rambo.\n\n4. Art Carney, in \"Harry and Tonto\": Carney was a very good actor, who was given this award for his lifetime of service to the industry. The performance itself is sweet, touching and very good but not great. In winning it, he beat Jack Nicholson in \"Chinatown\" and Al Pacino in \"The Godfather Part II.\"\n\n3. Tom Hanks in \"Forrest Gump\": The Academy has always been prejudiced towards actors playing mildly retarded characters. Cliff Robertson for \"Charly,\" Dustin Hoffman in \"Rainman,\" and this movie, where Hanks gives a decent but highly overrated performance.\n\n2. Al Pacino in \"Scent of a Woman\": There's no denying Pacino was an amazing actor in his prime. This is the movie that showed the world he was past his prime, and thusly, he was rewarded with the award he should have won twice before for a movie that shouldn't have even been on the ballot.\n\n1. Roberto Benigni in \"Life is Beautiful\": Without question, the biggest embarrassment in the history of the Academy Awards. His performance managed to be touching - despite the fact he was using physical comedy in the context of the Holocaust - and yet it is entirely forgettable. The only memorable thing about Benigni is winning an award he didn't deserve.\n\nMilk – Rent It Raging Bull – Buy It On the Waterfront – Buy It To Kill a Mockingbird – Buy It\n\nNate rates it:"
