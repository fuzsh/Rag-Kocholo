And the Academy more than made up for this by rewarding Brando twice. Thankfully everyone got their due!\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nIn an odd way Brando losing that Oscar - the single most influential performance on film in male American history imo - established a whole differet parameter of \"alternative\" ideas / theory in film......that The Academy ALWAYS gets it wrong.....when Pacino didn't win in the 70s there was that precedent that his fans could argue - and Newman not winning in the 60s etc also........\n\nThat idea - the actor as a sort of outsider to an establishment as a kind of \"Punk Rock\" iconoclast has its roots in that specific performance - even if he did win 2 eventually also subsequently.....\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nThat idea - the actor as a sort of outsider to an establishment as a kind of \"Punk Rock\" iconoclast has its roots in that specific performance - even if he did win 2 eventually also subsequently.....\n\nhim accepting his second one *like that* was also pretty punk... Clint made it clear right away like he was still shooting Dirty Harry )\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nThis wouldn't be my list - I certainly would have a 50s Brando performance as his worst but.......interest revisionist blah blah blah from Woke scolds IndieWire....\n\nAll 40 Marlon Brando Film Performances Ranked, in Honor of His 100th Birthday\n\nBrando was a singular titan of the film screen, but he left behind a smaller filmography than you might expect.\n\nwww.indiewire.com/gallery/best-marlon-brando-movies-ranked/\n\nPost by HELENA MARIA on\n\nThe greatest actor of all time .

His filmography in the 50's and early 70's was\n\nWent on certain forums and some people keep reminding everyone about the whole \"Last Tango/Maria Schneider\" affair. pacinoyes\n\nJust putting this under a spoiler since I wasn't sure why you did that buddy or anything and I don't want to speak out of turn\n\ndoesn't bother me, doesn't affect my assessment of an amazing performance and at times an amazing film in any way at all .......everybody is an adult and they were creating adult Art.....that was then.........now is now......the circmstances are no longer the circumstances so to speak\n\nPost by finniussnrub on\n\nMisleading headline, he praises his early work (as most do), and notes his indulgences later on (as many do who have actually seen more than just his iconic performances).\n\nPost by pupdurcs on\n\nDamn.....actors today really want all the smoke .I love it!\n\nWe all know how Brian Cox will say anything about any actor ( Joaquin Phoenix being his most recent victim) but Waltz is not someone who has a rep for smack talking other actors, so this is an interesting development.\n\nWaltz isn't wrong, imho. His legacy is overbearing and annoying. And he was a terrible and lazy ham for large portions of his career. I like that Waltz also acknowledges that he did start out as a special actor, but yeah, he's always been overrated, imho. Extremely talented, but could also be ridiculously indulgent and at times hard to watch.\n\nCaleb Landry Jones (who was in conversation with Waltz) also came for Jack Nicholson being a ham in Missouri Breaks as well as Brando being a ham in the same film. I don't know what's suddenly gotten in to actors not being afraid of candour or criticising acting sacred cows and icons, but I'm here for it. Makes things a lot more spicy.\n\nPost by pupdurcs on\n\nMisleading headline, he praises his early work (as most do), and notes his indulgences later on (as many do who have actually seen more than just his iconic performances).\n\nIt's not really misleading. Yeah, he does praise him as being a special actor early on, but the gist that he considered Brando to be a ham and finds his legacy annoying and overrated is pretty much accurate to what he said. The whole interview with Caleb Landry Jones is quite interesting.\n\nPost by finniussnrub on\n\nMisleading headline, he praises his early work (as most do), and notes his indulgences later on (as many do who have actually seen more than just his iconic performances).\n\nIt's not really misleading. Yeah, he does praise him as being a special actor early on, but the gist that he considered Brando to be a ham and finds his legacy anything and overrated is pretty much accurate to what he said. The whole interview with Caleb Landry Jones is quite interesting.\n\nThe title suggests no praise whatsoever, so yes it is misleading."
