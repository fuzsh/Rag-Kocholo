Cobb was 5 feet 11 inches tall.\n\nRod Steiger was 5 feet 10 inches tall.\n\nKarl Malden was 6 feet 1 inches tall.\n\nMarlon Brando, who appears opposite these three actors in the movie On the Waterfront, was 5 feet 9 inches tall.\n\nKeep that in mind when you re-watch this peerless 1954 masterwork about corruption and redemption on New York City’s docks. It’s a vertical city, and in every sense, this is a story about who looks down on whom.\n\nTerry Malloy (Brando), a once up-and-coming prizefighter turned mob flunky, spends his life in the shadow of big scary Alphas.\n\nThere’s his brother Charley “the Gent” Malloy, (Rod Steiger) a beefy mob fixer with dead eyes and a sharp suit who bullies him as only an older brother can.\n\nThere’s Johnny Friendly, a terrifying, toxic slab of a dock boss who, as played by Lee J. Cobb, ranks high amongst the most intimidating movie rageholes of all time.\n\nEven the reforming priest trying to clean up the corrupt waterfront is a two-fisted badass. Karl Malden’s Father Barry has Jesus as a corner man — sinners, say your prayers."
