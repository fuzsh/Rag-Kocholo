        "text": "Dana and Tom discuss the last of their month of Best Picture winners with one of the great Crime Dramas in American Cinema with On the Waterfront (1954): directed by Elia Kazan, written by Budd Schulberg, starring Marlon Brando, Eva Marie Saint, Karl Malden, Rod Steiger, and Lee J. Cobb.\n\nPlot Summary: Dockworker Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) had been an up-and-coming boxer until ordered to throw a fight by powerful local mob boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). Terry, now working for Friendly, helps set up another longshoreman, Joey Doyle, who is talking to the Waterfront Crime Commissioner. Not knowing that he was helping Friendly in Joey’s murder, Terry’s conscience is disturbed, and he starts questioning his involvement. Circumstances place Terry around Joey’s sister, Edie (Eva Marie Saint) and a romance develops. This relationship, together with the advice and support of streetwise priest Father Barry (Karl Malden), pushes Terry to decide his path. Does he stand up to Friendly and turn his back on Friendly’s right-hand man, Terry's brother Charley (Rod Steiger), risking his own life and safety, or does Terry \"follow the code\" and remain silent?\n\nYou can now follow us on Instagram, Twitter, or TikTok (@gmoatpodcast) or find our Facebook page at Greatest Movie of All-Time Podcast.\n\nFor more on the episode, go to: https://www.ronnyduncanstudios.com/post/on-the-waterfront-1954\n\nFor the entire rankings list so far, go to: https://www.ronnyduncanstudios.com/post/greatest-movie-of-all-time-list"
