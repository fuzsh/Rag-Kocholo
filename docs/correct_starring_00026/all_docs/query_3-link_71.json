        "text": "you should have looked out\n\nThe backdrop for this classic movie is the world of New Jersey longshoremen s docks, stronghold of corrupt unions and organized crime. The main character is Terry Malloy, a former boxer and errand boy for the local union boss, Johnny Friendly. Terry is an uneducated, brutal man perfectly willing to do the bidding of the union higher-ups without question. Spared the backbreaking work of the docks due to his brother Charley s influence, Terry does not question the cruelty and inequity he sees daily. He simply does as he is told. Painfully aware that he is not suited for anything else, he accepts his lot in life. Though Terry feels a deep uneasiness within himself, he cannot articulate it and does not attempt to explore it until he meets Edie Doyle, sister of a man murdered orders from the union leader. Terry is used as a decoy in the murder but is not aware of the part he has played until it is too late. Knowledge that he contributed to the man s death plants the seeds of guilt in Terry. The action of On the Waterfront explores how this man comes to terms with this knowledge and how he emotionally deals with it. Terry's relationship with Edie starts out of his guilt, although he is reluctant to admit responsibility for his actions. He tries to convince himself and the girl that her brother s murder is just something that happens when people try to go against the system. However, as he falls in love with Edie, he begins to realize that the life he has chosen to accept might be a mistake. For the first time, he questions the quality of an existence that has no honor or morality. His love for Edie leads him to feel emotions and come to terms with ideas that he was not aware he had within him. Ultimately, he is lead to make a life-changing decision. The performance of Marlon Brando, method actor extraordinaire, is what raised this film to the classic status it enjoys. He dominates every scene in which he appears, infusing the film with dramatic power. His body movements along with his controlled voice inflections spell sheer dramatic excellence. He is able to convey the torturous ambivalence that Terry feels, even though his character is painfully inarticulate. Elia Kazan originally planned to cast Frank Sinatra in the role of Terry Malloy but the box-office appeal of Brando won out with studio executives. Although Sinatra did have considerable dramatic skill (From Here to Eternity, etc.), it is difficult to imagine any other actor in the part. On the Waterfront is not without other excellent performances. Lee J. Cobb is wonderful as the totally amoral union boss, Johnny Friendly. Rod Steiger, in another strong performance, does not disappoint in his role as Charley Malloy, a man torn between loyalty to his brother and the dark reality of his own life as part of a criminal organization. Steiger s scene in a taxi with Brando is one of film s most memorable, as Brando recounts the fateful decision to throw the fight that could have meant respectability for him I coulda been a contenda. . . . . Steiger s face as he listens to his brother s sadness overflow is priceless. Amazingly, this memorable scene was improvised by the actors. In her film debut, actress Eva Marie Saint lends just the right air of genteel respectability as a contrast to the brutality of her environment. She is perfect type to awaken not only love but also Terry s sense of decency. Karl Malden as Father Barry is great casting, with Malden displaying great energy in the rRead full review\n\n2011 story is still a good one. Brando is a looker\n\nTrying to increase my knowledge of film, I've been watching some oldies. This is still a worthy film worth watching. First off, Brando is darn easy to look at. I'm amazed at how much soul he portrays in just his face. And this is a fine gangster flic to boot. Brando helps facilitate a guy getting knocked off, and he has remorse. He's part of a rough and tough day worker slave trade on the water front shipping docks of New Jersey, and just like today, wise guys are running the black market. Some of Kazan's scenes are artfully cinematic or vise a verse... Either way, even though it's an old film it's pretty to look at, and I mean that in a good way. If you appreciate b/w photography, you'll like the cinematographic elements. It has a Hollywood ending, and I may watch it again just to look at Brando. I give it a good to excellent rating, only because cinema has come so far since the old days. This film relies on good story, not great special effects. And I do prefer color. Oh well. Watch it.

Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ Thanks + Blessings, Max Rainet !Read full review\n\nOn the Watefront - special edition dvd review\n\nI decided to buy this movie because I had heard a lot about it, and I am a fan of Marlon Brando (before he went weird). This is a good movie and worth watching if you like gangster/noir movies, but it is not quite as good as I thought it would be. The acting is mostly excellent. Although some of the performances are a little dated by today's standards (not Brando's). Also the ending is bit too hokey and upbeat to fit the movie. This movie was directed by Elia Kazan, and I read that it was in response the the communist inquiries and hearings going on at the time. Kazan used the movie to defend his decision to testify and name communists he knew. Anyway, despite all this, the movie is very good. There are several wonderful scenes in it, including the classic \"coulda been a contender\" scene. The core story behind the movie is also very good and moving, if a little misguided. As far as Brando's performance, it is exceptionally good, and he certainly deserved the oscar. But I still think that his performance in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" was his best and the most influential even though he didn't win the oscar for it. All in all, if you are a fan of gangster/noir films, Marlon Brando, or just are an enthusiast of classic films, you should definitely watch this film. Just be prepared to take it with a grain of salt.Read full review"
