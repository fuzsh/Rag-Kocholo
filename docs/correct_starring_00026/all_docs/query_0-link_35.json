        "text": "Original Columbia Pictures U.S. One-Sheet Poster (27x41). Linen-Backed. Fine Plus Condition\n\nOriginal U.S. One-Sheet Poster (27x41), linen-backed, for the Elia Kazan iconic crime drama, ON THE WATERFRONT (1954) starring Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger, and Eva Marie Saint. This powerful drama tells the story of ex-prize fighter Terry (Brando) who becomes a longshoreman and struggles to stand up to his corrupt union bosses. This is certainly one of the great American films concerning the horrors of corruption and injustice and the willingness of one brave man to stand up to instituionalized evil. Nominated for twelve Academy Awards, the film won eight Oscars , including Best Picture, Best Actor to Brando, Best Supporting Actress to Saint, Best Screenplay to Budd Schulberg, and Best Director to Kazan. The film also featured a wonderful score by Leonard Bernstein. This original one-sheet was used in a theater and when we acquired the poster, it was showing some tears and signs of wear. Colors were vivid, however, and we had the poster professionally restored. It now presents beautifully. MovieArt Austin guarantees that this poster is an authentic U.S. one-sheet poster for this film. MovieArt Austin does not sell reproductions.\n\nMARLON BRANDO - Actor\n\nELIA KAZAN - Director\n\nKarl Malden - Actor\n\nEva Marie Saint - Actor\n\nLee J.
