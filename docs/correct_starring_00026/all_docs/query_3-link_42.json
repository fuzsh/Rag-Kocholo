        "text": "Both Elia Kazan’s 1954 film, On the Waterfront, and Orson Welles’s 1941 film, Citizen Kane, explore the concept of how a human being and who they are can be an amalgam of constructs. While the former argues through Marlon Brando’s employment of “the Method” as his acting style in the film that an actor and the character they portray can be one through shared experiences and emotions, the latter argues through its narrative structure, camera work, and protagonist that the sum of an individual’s experiences can make them into a fractured, hollow being.\n\n“The Method,” the acting style practised by Brando in On the Waterfront, is one which encourages actors not to act as someone else, but rather to bring themselves and their life experiences to a role in order that there be little to no delineation between the role the actor adopts and the actor themselves. This style “promotes intimate communication between actors in a scene, thus striving toward the performance ideal of true, unified ensemble acting” (Penney, “Teaching Acting Technique and Building a Character Through Cinema”).\n\nSimilar to the way in which an individual can change who they are through self-examination, “the Method” encourages “a pragmatic way of working to create both the interior life and the logical behavior of a character, a way that can be taught, practiced, monitored, and corrected” (Penney, “Teaching. . .”). As is evident in Brando’s portrayal of Terry in this film, the central tenants of the Method are summarised succinctly as follows: “In acting everything comes out of what you are or some aspect of who you are. Everything is a part of your experience. We all have a spectrum of emotions in us. It is a broad one, and it is an actor’s job to reach into this assortment of emotions and experience. . . the ones that are appropriate for his character and the story” (Penney, “Teaching. . .”).\n\nThis concept, that acting is a process of reaching into one’s inner self and digging up the emotions necessary to a scene and a character is something which transcends the misconception that a skillful actor simply “‘plays’ a character well,” is one which is best exemplified by Brando in that scene at approximately the 1:10:00 mark of the film (Penney, “Teaching. . .”). In this scene, Terry and his brother, Charlie, ride together in the back of a car as Charlie attempts to convince Terry not to testify against the gang which controls the neighbourhood. At the outset of this scene, Rod Steiger’s voice reaches a feverish pace as it crescendos; in response, Marlon Brando, his eyebrows furrowed, appears to choose his words carefully, unlike Steiger. His tone becomes increasingly pained and his voice quiets the louder Steiger becomes. Finally, in a moment which pivots both the film and the relationship between the brothers, when Brando says that he has not made up his mind as to whether or not he will testify, Steiger bellows inches away from Brando’s face: “Well, make up your mind before we get to 437 River Street.” Suddenly, the car is silent. In the medium close-up shot Steiger and Brando share, Brando’s facial expression stays pinched, his eyes fixed on Steiger. When the camera cuts to a close-up shot of Brando’s face, his face is relaxed and his eyes appear clear with clarity, with an understanding of the situation. After a moment, Brando, like the birds his character cares for, suddenly jerks his head in the opposite direction then scans the area carefully with his eyes, as if attempting to anticipate what will come next. In this moment, Brando looks to be a wild animal that knows they have been caught and fears they cannot escape. Softly, Brando replies, “Before we get to where, Charlie?” There is silence. The camera cuts back to a medium close-up shot which Steiger and Brando once again share. Eventually, Brando begins to repeat the question, slower and more deliberately as he stares at Steiger, whose face is cold and whose eyes are fixed blankly ahead. Before Brando is able to finish his question, Steiger turns quickly to him, angrily demanding that he take the job offered by the gang. The camera cuts to a medium shot of the two as Steiger finishes his line to reveal that he holds a gun to Brando, his brother. Brando appears disgusted and in disbelief as he painfully and repeatedly asks in a high-pitched voice, “What?” As Steiger attempts to plead with him, Brando shakes his head in pity and revulsion as he says Charlie’s name. When Brando later delivers his impassioned monologue, saying “I could’a been a contender,” he speaks as if he is finally saying aloud the frustrations he has harbored towards his brother for years, gesturing with open palms and gentle pats on Steiger’s chest as he emotes, showing kindness to his brother as a direct foil to Steiger’s manic state, as if he empathises with him and his misplaced anger.\n\nInitially, when trying to understand what the Method was in practise, I was totally confused. I did not understand why the Method needed to be its own definable style when it did not really seem as if Marlon Brando was doing anything besides simply existing within the film.\n\nIt was at this point, when I asked myself what was so special about Brando’s simply existing within the film, that I discovered why the Method is so unique to acting and film discourse. After researching the Method, I found that its tenants came to life while intensely watching Brando’s performance in this film and seeing how it did not appear as if he was acting, it appeared as if he truly was Terry existing organically within the environment and narrative of the film.\n\nWhile Brando may not have had the same specific life experiences as Terry in On the Waterfront, what is unique about the Method is that it does not rely on acting being selective to one’s having experienced specific life events. Rather, the Method draws on the universal experiences we as human beings have. I believe this idea of universality is best exemplified by one of the ways the Method is taught; as Carol Penney states in “Teaching Acting Technique and Building a Character Through Cinema,” “Stanislavski developed exercises with which the actor, by recalling the sensory details that accompanied an emotional experience, could entice the emotion from his subconscious and re-experience it” (Penney).\n\nFinally, I believe that in writing and in acting, one has to become what some may view as uncomfortably close with one’s material. In order that any art is truly influential and significant, I argue that, as the Method teaches, it must come from a place deep within an individual, even if those specific ideas and events explored within a work are not experiences that the author or actor has specifically had, in order that their work convey the type of universality of the human condition that has allowed works of art to persist in the collective social and cultural consciousness to this day.\n\nI believe that in order to understand excellent writing and acting, one must watch the worst writing and acting. I believe a way to define the Method for one’s self aside from reading the definitions or taking acting classes is to watch a film like Tommy Wiseau’s 2003 strange and surreal work, The Room, and juxtapose the acting of Tommy Wiseau against that of Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront. While it can be difficult to understand what the Method means in practise by reading about it, I argue that watching someone utterly fail at the Method, such as Wiseau, and juxtaposing that against someone who excelled at the Method, such as Brando, can make more clear through juxtaposition the tenants of the Method and bring to life its ideas.\n\nI argue that it is easy to mock and ridicule those like Wiseau who fail to portray acting styles such as the Method, but it is much more difficult to define what it is in practise. Therefore, I believe that engaging in these “bad movie” exercises can prove to help one be able to better identify and understand more sophisticated acting styles and filmmaking techniques.\n\nThe concept that an individual, as both an actor and a character, is pieced together from a lifetime of experiences is something which is again explored in Citizen Kane. The narrative structure of this film is one which drives to discover and define who Charles Foster Kane is, a name that is said many times throughout the film, when in reality, the film is the pasting together of other people’s experiences with him. The one true look into who Charles Kane was is through the newsreel at the beginning of the film, wherein he says at approximately the 07:50 minute mark of the film, “I am, have been, and will be only one thing - an American” and later at approximately the 11 minute mark says a slightly different version of the previous statement, stating confidently, “I’m an American. I’ve always been an American.” These brief moments parallel the overall narrative of the film and the drive of those reporters and those who knew Kane to piece together a unified and distilled version of who Kane was, to find an identity to associate with a name. Each time Kane bellows out his full name, with pride, each time it rings more hollow as Welles proves it means nothing. There were many different, opposing versions of Kane: the young boy who was sent off to live with Mr. Thatcher, a rich man who could offer him a better life than what his parents could; the young man at 25 who insists to his guardian at approximately the 25 minute mark of the film, “The trouble is you don’t realise you’re talking to two people: As Charles Foster Kane who owns 82,364 shares of public transit. . . I sympathise with you; Charles Foster Kane is a scoundrel. . . On the other hand, I am the publisher of the Inquirer, as such it’s my duty,. . . it’s also my pleasure to see to it that decent, hardworking people in this community aren’t robbed blind by a pack of money-hungry mad pirates;” and the lonely man at the end of the film who had been left by his second wife. There are so many different Kane personas offered by the film’s narrative and the characters within it that Welles’s assertion is clear: Kane is not a person, he is a construct.\n\nThis idea, that Kane, and therefore Citizen Kane, is a construct, is exemplified by the ways in which Welles reminds the audience that they are present and watching a film. For instance, at approximately the 39 minute mark of the film, Leeland looks into the camera and speaks to the audience as Kane stares at him, confused, stating in regards to Kane’s document, “My Declaration of Principles,” “I have a hunch it might turn out to be something pretty important,” something which is revealed to have been true as the film progresses.\n\nBoth Citizen Kane and On the Waterfront assert that as individuals, we are capable of creating something that exists outside of ourselves. While On the Waterfront asserts through Marlon Brando’s acting style that this construct can exist as an extension of ourselves, Citizen Kane argues that in creating a construct, we run from the truth as we attempt to be someone entirely different, and in some cases, better, than who we truly are.\n\nWhen I first watched Citizen Kane, I found myself consumed by the narrative at the forefront of the film, that of attempting to understand who Kane was and what Rosebud meant to him, something which is still debated in popular culture today, I believe most humorously in the U.S. version of the Office. Though what I later realised is so ingenious about this film’s narrative and its characters is that it is all a distraction from the fact that none of them matter; all that matters in the narrative is what is continuously asserted to be of importance to many characters of the film, such as Kane, his guardian, and his wives: monetary gain and the upward mobility and allowances it provides for an individual.\n\nEven if Welles’s characters do not explicitly say that their motivations are monetary, it is a theme which lurks underneath the film.\n\nSomething which I find most striking is the importance that “Rosebud” has to the film; at the forefront of the entire film is a search in understanding what it means and why these were Kane’s last words. On a surface level, the film reveals the answer to these questions ends as it ends on the image of Rosebud being burned. I believe that this final frame of the film is most poignant because it asserts Welles’s overall thesis that in a capitalist society, money is more important than people and their memories. In comparison, Kane’s son is only seen for an extremely brief moment of the film, is provided no character arch or personality, and is quickly forgotten in the film’s narrative as the story moves on to Kane, his next wife, and his acquisition of an opera house where she can perform. In Kane’s narrative, people do not matter; the new, younger wife he abandons his ex-wife and son for and the opera house he purchases are simply a objects by which he can prove a point, as one of his associates recounts. Therefore, the lingering close-up shot on the sled, while initially may appear to be sentimental, in actuality asserts the meaninglessness of human existence in a capitalist society defined by the acquisition of material.\n\nBibliography\n\n“Citizen Kane (1941).” AMC Filmsite, www.filmsite.org/citi.html.\n\nKazan, Elia, director.
