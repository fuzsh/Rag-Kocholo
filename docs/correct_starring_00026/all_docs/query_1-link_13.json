He embodied the character with gravitas, wisdom, and a quiet but imposing authority that left an indelible mark on cinema history. Brando’s use of prosthetic makeup, including the famous cotton ball-filled cheeks, transformed his appearance, allowing him to disappear into the role.

It defined indefinite gangster performances in its wake.\n\nTHE GODFATHER | 50th Anniversary Trailer | Paramount Pictures\n\nThe making of “The Godfather”\n\nApocalypse Now\n\nIn the 1979 war epic directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando took on the role of Colonel Walter E.
