Toole discusses his life and writings\n\nBARBARA BOGAEV, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Barbara Bogaev in for Terry Gross.\n\nF.X. Toole learned to box when he was in his late 40s. It was too late to\n\nmake it as a boxer, but he stayed in that world as a cut man. In between\n\nrounds, the cut man stops his boxer's bleeding so that he can get back into\n\nthe ring. At the age of 70, Toole wrote a collection of short stories called\n\n\"Rope Burns.\" It's now out in paperback. The review in the LA Times\n\ndescribed it as a book of chillingly authentic short stories about fighters\n\nand fighting written from as far inside as you can get. Although Toole had a\n\ntrunk full of novels, stories and plays, this was his first published book.\n\nHe didn't want his boxing friends to know that he was writing stories set in\n\ntheir world, so he used the pen name F.X. Toole, but the good reviews blew\n\nhis cover. His real name is Jerry Boyd.\n\nTerry spoke with F.X. Toole last year. He started with a reading from the\n\nfirst story in \"Rope Burns\" about a cut man.\n\nMr. F.X. TOOLE (Author): (Reading) I stop blood. I stop it between rounds\n\nfor fighters so they can stay in the fight. Blood ruins some boys. It was\n\nthat way with Sonny Liston, God rest his soul. Bad as he was, he'd see his\n\nown blood and fall apart. I'm not the one who decides when to stop the fight\n\nand I don't stitch up cuts once the fight's over. And it's not my job to\n\nhospitalize a boy for brain damage. My job is to stop blood so the fighter\n\ncan see enough to keep on fighting. I do that, maybe I save a boy's title. I\n\ndo that one thing and I'm worth every cent they pay me. I stop the blood and\n\nsave the fight, the boy loves me more than he loves his daddy.\n\nBut you can't always stop it. Fight guys know this. If the cut's too deep or\n\nwide or maybe you've got a severed vein down in there, the blood keeps coming.\n\nSometimes it takes two or three rounds to stop the blood; maybe more. The\n\nboy's heart is pumping so hard or he cuts more. Once you get the coagulant in\n\nthere, sometimes it takes another shot from the opponent right on the cut,\n\nitself, to drive the blood far enough from the area so the stuff you're using\n\ncan start to work.\n\nWhat I'm saying is there are all kinds of combinations you come up against\n\ndown in the different layers of meat. When a good cut man stays ahead of the\n\ncombinations, he can stop most cuts, but not every one.\n\nTERRY GROSS reporting:\n\nAnd that's F.X. Toole reading from his new collection of short stories \"Rope\n\nBurns.\"\n\nLet's talk a little bit more about what you do as a cut man. What are some of\n\nthe medicines that you have to stop bleeding?\n\nMr. TOOLE: Well, there's several--there's a lot of stuff that's illegal, but\n\nmost of the time you're using--and I say most of the time. I'm\n\ngeneralizing--but you use adrenaline 1:1000. It's a topical and it's a basal\n\nconstrictor, not the kind you inject. Then there's Thrombin, which is a\n\ncoagulant rather than a basal constrictor. There's stuff called Atervine(ph).\n\nMuch of this stuff is used in--during surgery.\n\nGROSS: What's your training like to do this? Do you study medicine at all or\n\ndo you just study another cutter?\n\nMr. TOOLE: You study with other guys. You pick their brains. You have to\n\nremember that what you're working on is a restricted area and the tissue's not\n\nvery deep, OK. It's not as if you're trying to work on someone who's\n\nsuffering a stab wound in the liver. It's shallow tissue. Sometimes it looks\n\nlike--during the fight sometimes you think you're looking down into a volcano,\n\nbut it's--you know, that's obviously not the case, so you're working on the\n\nface; primarily the forehead, the scalp, maybe. And so you learn how to stop\n\nthat blood. You don't learn how to deal with stab wounds.\n\nGROSS: Tell me more about what goes on in the corner during the period\n\nbetween rounds if the fighter is tired and he's bleeding. Who's paying\n\nattention to him? What's everybody doing? Who's competing for his time\n\nthere?\n\nMr. TOOLE: Well, there's--what you do is you get him--you get him breathing\n\ndeeply from the diaphragm, number one. And you water him down. You put ice\n\npacks on him and you get him breathing, breathing, breathing. Now if he's\n\ncut, you've got to do all of that and get the blood stopped at the same time,\n\nbut the fighter is completely focused on you. And he trusts you. He's put\n\nhis life in your hands, which is one of the reasons I'm so careful about what\n\nI do with these kids. And so he's focused on you and he's learned through\n\nthe whole training process to listen to you. While the crowd is roaring, he\n\nwill hear your voice above them all, if you shout instructions up to him.\n\nBut now he's cut and now he's tired. You get him breathing. You get him\n\nbreathing. You get him breathing. You cool him down and you'll be surprised\n\nhow someone in good condition--and I'm speaking cardiovascular now--will\n\nrevive in just that time. Now if he's terribly hurt, you know, I've called\n\nfights off, but that's the last resort. You don't want to do that because,\n\nagain, his future is in your hands, but you don't want to make a decision to\n\nmake his future his past, either.\n\nGROSS: As the cut man, it's your job to stop the blood when a boxer's\n\nbleeding--when your boxer's bleeding. And I'm wondering how the whole idea\n\nof bleeding has changed in the HIV era?\n\nMr. TOOLE: Well, you know, when HIV really hit and AIDS was rampant and it\n\nfirst hit--you know, got the publicity it did--What?--10 years or so ago, we\n\nwere--first of all, we were instructed to wear gloves--rubber gloves. The\n\nfighters at that time and since have had to take AIDS tests, so it--at that\n\ntime it was a much bigger problem than it is today. Now I don't even think\n\nthey hand out rubber gloves anymore because there are--you know, the AIDS test\n\ncomes along and it's yesterday. You follow? And so they know whether or not\n\nthese guys are infected. There was a heck of a heavyweight here not too long\n\nago whose test proved positive for AIDS. And here was a big monster of a guy.\n\nThe odds are he got it using steroids because he was a tall, thin kid at one\n\ntime and two years later he's a monster heavyweight.\n\nGROSS: How would you get AIDS by using steroids?\n\nMr. TOOLE: The needle.\n\nGROSS: Oh, oh. I see. Got it. Got it.\n\nMr. TOOLE: So these guys might be in the gym and say, `Here. You use the\n\nneedle. I'll use the needle. You use the needle.'\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. TOOLE: People often are quite foolish in terms of what they do.\n\nGROSS: Hmm. You know the expression `punch drunk,' where somebody seems to\n\nhave lost some of their senses, some of their capacity to think and speak\n\nbecause they've been knocked around too much.\n\nMr. TOOLE: Sure.\n\nGROSS: Do you see boxers who actually have that condition?\n\nMr. TOOLE: Sure. Yes. I work with one right now who talks like this. He\n\ntalks through his nose and he walks with a limp and you have to say, `What?\n\nWhat did you say? What?' Now why did that happen? It happened because he\n\nwas a great, young fighter who never got into shape. He tells a great story.\n\nHe says he prayed before every fight. He said, `God, please let me get\n\nthrough this fight and I promise next fight I'll be in shape.' And he said,\n\n`And I never got in shape.' So he fought too long. He got hit too much.\n\nOne of the reasons he's talking that way is because his nose is broken. It\n\ngoes off at an angle, but, indeed, there's an example. And you know what?\n\nHe has no regrets whatsoever. He'll joke about the whole show.\n\nGROSS: In your book you write `boxing is an unnatural act. Everything in\n\nboxing is backwards to life. Instead of running from pain, which is the\n\nnatural thing in life, in boxing you step to it.' You've boxed as well as\n\nworked as a cut man. What's it like to try to get over those natural\n\ninstincts and replace them with boxing instincts?\n\nMr. TOOLE: Well, I boxed. You have to understand. My boxing began when I\n\nwas 48, and I sparred in the gym. I worked out in the gym. I did what we\n\ncall `worked.' And I didn't do it as long as I would have, but--and you also,\n\nif you can imagine--I wear glasses so when I was sparring I was throwing\n\npunches at shadows, so I probably took more shots than I would have.\n\nThe--what happens to you is you become focused on the idea of landing your\n\nshots to the other guy; of doing damage to your opponent. And so you take\n\nshots and you have to understand that you're in what's called--you know,\n\nHemingway called `hot blood.' And so the shots don't hurt you as much while\n\nyou're excited because adrenalin is part of the formula. It's later on that\n\nfighters, you know, for a day or so afterwards will be holding their ribs, or\n\nyou know, you'll see fighters wearing dark glasses for a couple days; that\n\nsort of thing.\n\nGROSS: I imagine it was a little harder for you to take blows or heal from\n\nwounds in your late 40s.\n\nMr. TOOLE: Oh, sure. And I had teeth cracked. I had my nose broken before,\n\nbut I had it broken again. And I would have kept on boxing. I had to quit\n\nbecause I developed a jaw problem and I was told that I had to wear braces.\n\nSo you can't box and wear braces, so that's a regret that I have, but,\n\nnonetheless, a necessary thing for me to have done. Along the way I found\n\nthat I was able to do this stuff. I was able to focus. I was able to\n\nremember the mechanics; first of all, do the mechanics--the mechanics for\n\nyour mind.\n\nNow how do you hit this other guy? In a street fight you can rush up and\n\ngrab someone by their shirt, by their throat, by the neck, by the head, trip\n\nhim, knock him down, kick him and all of that good stuff, but in the ring\n\nit's very hard to hit an opponent who's not going to stand there and fight\n\nyou back. If he just moves, you're probably not going to be able to do much\n\nmore than tap him on the shoulder. So, you know, I learned how to do all of\n\nthis stuff, how to cut off the ring, how to throw punches correctly, how to\n\nprotect myself. And so, you know, it became a way of life for me to the\n\ndegree that I actually quit writing. I said, `Why am I ruining my life\n\nwriting when I can do this other thing?' I can be--I can participate in it\n\neveryday instead of being an outsider; instead of being, you know, someone\n\nhowling in the woods for all those years. And so writing became unimportant\n\nto me and I said, `Forget it. I'm not gonna hurt like that anymore.' And so\n\nI know about hurt outside of the ring as well as inside of the ring.\n\nGROSS: You're talking about the hurt of rejection?\n\nMr. TOOLE: Absolutely. That would destroy me. It would just put me flat on\n\nmy face, so I...\n\nGROSS: That hurts more than the broken nose?\n\nMr. TOOLE: Oh, absolutely; no comparison. I'd take a broken nose any old\n\nday. To sit there, you know, with that brown envelope in your lap and your\n\nhead in your hands and you say to yourself, `How--who am I kidding? I'm no\n\ngood. If I was any good, somebody would have bought this. I'm just kidding\n\nmyself. I've wasted my life. I've thrown it away. What I--I thought it was\n\nthe muse who kissed me, who tapped me on the shoulder, and it was a whore that\n\ndid. And I've been drained of all my resources. Here I am a complete fool.\n\nWhy am I doing this? I've just kidded myself.' And I'd go through that and\n\nthen, suddenly--not, suddenly, but slowly I'd get back to my feet. Suddenly,\n\nanother story would play before my eyes. And I'd be back at it again.\n\nBOGAEV: F.X. Toole speaking last year with Terry Gross. His collection of\n\nshort stories, \"Rope Burns,\" is just out in paperback.\n\nWe'll hear more after the break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nBOGAEV: We're back with Terry Gross' interview with F.X. Toole. His\n\ncollection of short stories about life in the boxing ring, \"Rope Burns,\" is\n\nnow out in paperback.\n\nGROSS: Now I know as a young man you studied acting with Sanford Meisner, the\n\nfamous acting teacher at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York.\n\nMr. TOOLE: Yes.\n\nGROSS: You had written plays that weren't produced, but you wrote them. Any\n\nconnection between boxing and theater?\n\nMr. TOOLE: Oh, there's--yeah, there's a lot of performance in boxing. In\n\nfact, when I see fight movies--and they try to train fighters to be--perform\n\nlike fighters, it usually doesn't work. Oftentimes, they don't take enough\n\ntime because it takes a long time to learn how to do this stuff. And so I\n\nwould say that they probably should take fighters and train them to be actors.\n\nIt would probably shorten the process. But, indeed, there's a lot of show biz\n\nin the game and the audience is there to be entertained. You entertain\n\ndifferently than, say, in the theater and, yet, the drama is there. It's real\n\ndrama. It's going on right before their eyes.\n\nGROSS: Of course, in boxing it's not stage blood. It's real blood.\n\nMr. TOOLE: It's the real deal.\n\nGROSS: And you like that.\n\nMr. TOOLE: Sure.\n\nGROSS: Why do you prefer real blood to stage blood?\n\nMr. TOOLE: Well, because it's real. You know, I was a bullfighter and I was\n\ngored three times. And so for me to see blood pumping out is not that big a\n\ndeal. I've--you know, I had one--you know, I was gored in the bladder. I was\n\ngored in my left leg a couple of times. One of the times there were three\n\ntrajectories that were as long as your hand. And at the time I weighed\n\nprobably 140 pounds. I'm 6' tall, so you can imagine how thin my leg was.\n\nIt's part of the territory. It's the price of doing business. It's being\n\nthere at the time when the greatest challenge is met. And then it's also\n\nbeing there when that challenge is met in a positive or a negative way. And\n\nso, again, it's real drama. It's not playing. It's not, `Well, I can go home\n\nafter the theater or go to a local bar and have a few pops and forget about\n\nit.' This is stuff that you take for the rest of your life--with you for the\n\nrest of your life. And that's what I see life as, a series of experiences\n\nthat should be lived and not nullified, not anesthetized with drugs, etc.\n\nGROSS: What about street fighting? Were you ever into that? I mean, it's\n\nnot in an arena, but there's certainly a lot of theatrics in a lot of street\n\nfighting, and a lot of posturing, as well.\n\nMr. TOOLE: Well, I've been in a few street fights. When I was 49 or\n\nso--something like that, I was in a street fight, and I had part of my right\n\near bitten off, as a matter of fact, but my opponent was about to go blind and\n\nthe only thing that saved him was his girlfriend pulling me off of him, so\n\nstreet fights are nasty and ugly. And the goal is to do maximum damage in a\n\nminimum amount of time, so you know how you get your adversary down and you\n\nwant to make sure he cannot get up. And if he does get up, he's never gonna\n\nwant to come looking for you again.\n\nAnd in boxing, winner or loser, they go across the ring and they embrace and\n\nsay, `Good fight.' And the loser says, `Well, he was the better man today.'\n\nIf he has talent and ability in one thing and another, that may well be the\n\ncase, so he'll come back and fight another day. Street fights you don't\n\nordinarily fight the second or third or fourth or 20th time afterwards.\n\nGROSS: Who was the first person who read one of your stories and said, `I'm\n\ngoing to publish this'?\n\nMr. TOOLE: It was Howard Junker, God bless him, at a literary magazine out\n\nof San Francisco called Zyzzyva and--Z-Y-Z-Z-Y-V-A. And one day I got a phone\n\ncall and he introduced himself. And he said, `This is a terrific story. I\n\nwant to publish it.' And I said, `You're kidding?' And he said, `No, no. I\n\nwant to do it.' And we chatted a moment and I think for the first time in my\n\nlife I used the word flabbergasted because I--really, I've never used that\n\nword before because I usually have plenty to say, right? But I just could not\n\nbelieve it. I was--at that moment I was vindicated, if you will. At that\n\nmoment I was a successful writer.\n\nGROSS: Had you sent him the story?\n\nMr. TOOLE: I had sent him the story through the mail, like I always have. I\n\nnever put any blurb about myself. I just submit the story. And I was always\n\nvery selfish about writing. If I was going to have any success in writing or\n\nbe published at all, I wanted it to be absolutely on the merit of the work, as\n\nread by someone anonymous reading an anonymous writer. And that's what\n\nhappened, finally, after 40 years.\n\nGROSS: You're somebody who, in a way, starts things or accomplishes things\n\nlate in life. Now you started boxing at the age of 48. You're about 70 now.\n\nIs that right?\n\nMr. TOOLE: Seventy, yeah.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. And your first book has just been published. This is\n\nsomething you wanted your whole life. What's it like to get something that\n\nyou've always wanted, but get it at the age of 70 when, you know, you're not\n\nlooking ahead at your whole life any longer?\n\nMr. TOOLE: Well, it's sweet, indeed. It--I will also tell you that if this\n\nhad happened to me at 35, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation\n\nbecause I was, let's say, something of a wild man. I would probably have\n\ndestroyed myself along the way because I--given--let's--I'm hoping to make\n\nsome money on this, but let's assume that I would have made some money. I\n\nwould have probably squandered it and squandered everything else along with\n\nit because I would have wanted to push the envelope on principle, but also in\n\nterms of understanding the world and, if nothing else, to have more things to\n\nwrite about. So it's probably the best thing that could have happened to me.\n\nindividually. I look around and I see so many young people who get success\n\nearly on, fold in the stretch, if you will, and destroy themselves and\n\ndestroy a lot of people around them. And what a great tragedy that is\n\nbecause I think many of them end up with success that they don't feel they've\n\nearned. I've earned every bit of it. However much I get, I will have earned\n\nit. And I don't say that as some kind of a nut puffing myself up. I'm just\n\nsaying I paid my dues. Here it is. Thank God it's here and I'm gonna\n\nprotect it and nurture it to the best of my ability.\n\nGROSS: You saved all your earlier writing and do you like some of that stuff.\n\nMr. TOOLE: Some of it I do. I will tell you the first thing I really wrote\n\nseriously was a bullfight novel after I had been blown out of the game and I\n\nreturned to California to Los Angeles. And I was working in the Good Humor\n\nice cream factory, the swing shift. I was climbing down in the stainless\n\nsteel vaults--vats with live steam--and go home at midnight, 1 in the morning.\n\nMy wife and baby were asleep. I was still charged up and someway or another I\n\nhad the idea that I wanted to write a bullfight novel. So I did. And I still\n\nhave it. It's wrapped up in the brown paper, you know, and the stamp that I\n\nsent it to myself. I think the date is February something in 1958. I'm\n\nterrified to open those pages to go back and read how terrible it must be. On\n\nthe other hand, there's some great material in there, OK? And if I live long\n\nenough, maybe I can go back and use some of that.\n\nGROSS: Well, F.X. Toole, Jerry Boyd, I want to thank you very much for\n\ntalking with us.\n\nMr. TOOLE: It's been a great delight to be with you.\n\nBOGAEV: F.X. Toole's collection of short stories, \"Rope Burns,\" is out in\n\npaperback. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nReview: New film \"The Man Who Wasn't There\"\n\nBARBARA BOGAEV, host:\n\n\"The Man Who Wasn't There\" is the new movie from Joel and Ethan Coen. Billy\n\nBob Thornton stars, along with Frances McDormand and two well-known TV actors,\n\nMichael Badalucco from \"The Practice,\" and James Gandolfini from \"The\n\nSopranos.\" John Powers has a review.\n\nJOHN POWERS:\n\nNo filmmakers alive would seem to be more in love with film noire than Joel\n\nand Ethan Coen, who began their career with \"Blood Simple,\" a Texas update of\n\n\"James Cain.\" Copy Dashiell Hammett in \"Miller's Crossing\" and did a goofy\n\nriff on Raymond Chandler in \"The Big Lebowski.\" But while the Coens obviously\n\nadore film noire, they adore it like a husband who insists that his wife dress\n\nexactly the way he likes. They make everything fit their own sensibility,\n\nwhich is profoundly un-noirish; cool, clever, totally under control.\n\nAll those qualities are on display in \"The Man Who Wasn't There,\" a drifty new\n\ncrime story set in a small California town in 1949. Billy Bob Thornton stars\n\nas the story's taciturn narrator, Ed Crane. Ed works unhappily as the second\n\nbarber in a shop owned by his yakety brother-in-law, played by Michael\n\nBadalucco.\n\nEd's unenthusiastically married to Doris, that's Frances McDormand, who he\n\nsuspects is carrying on with her boss, Big Dave, who's played by James\n\nGandolfini. In hopes of a new life, Ed decides to blackmail Big Dave for 10\n\ngrand and invest it in a dry cleaning operation run by a shifty toupeed\n\nhuckster. Naturally, his plans go awry, unleashing murder and suicide and\n\nlegal insanity. Ed finds his only solace in a teen-age girl, Birdy Abundas,\n\nwho he overhears practicing Beethoven on the piano. Played by Scarlett\n\nJohansson, Birdy becomes a beacon of purity, a possible source of escape from\n\nthe small town hell that Ed at least partly created for himself. Here he\n\ntells her about his plans for her music career.\n\n(Soundbite of \"The Man Who Wasn't There\")\n\nMr. BILLY BOB THORNTON (As Ed Crane): There's this guy in San Francisco.\n\nI've made inquiries. Everybody says he's the best. He trained people who've\n\ngone on to big concert careers in symphony orchestras, the works. His name is\n\nJacques Carcanogues--I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a\n\nFrenchman.\n\nMs. SCARLETT JOHANSSON (As Birdy Abundas): Oh, boy, a Frenchman, huh?\n\nMr. THORNTON: You've got talent, anybody can see that; and he's the best.\n\nIf he sees a student that he thinks has talent, he takes them on for next to\n\nnothing, so you're a cinch to be accepted. I could cover the cost of the\n\nlessons. Like I said, it's pretty modest.\n\nMs. JOHANSSON: Oh, jeez, Mr. Crane.\n\nMr. THORNTON: No, I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch any more\n\nthings go down the drain. You're young. You don't understand.\n\nMs. JOHANSSON: Well, jeez, Mr. Crane, I hadn't really thought about it. A\n\ncareer and stuff.\n\nMr. THORNTON: Well, I know you haven't. Look, just go see him as a favor to\n\nme. I talked to this guy. He loosened up a little bit when I told him how\n\ntalented you are. He's agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you're\n\na diamond in the rough.\n\nPOWERS: At first, \"The Man Who Wasn't There\" seemed like a sly, beautifully\n\nmade pastiche shot in ravishing black and white by the great Roger Deakens.\n\nThe Coens really know their Hollywood classics. There are allusions to, among\n\nother things, Hitchcock's \"Shadow of the Doubt\" and Billy Wilder's \"Double\n\nIndemnity.\" But they also know the rhythms of film noire, briskly setting up\n\nthe pallid Ed as a kind of ghost in his own life, an ordinary man carried\n\nalong to a destiny he doesn't want. And for one glorious stretch, before the\n\nfirst murder and Ed's master plan for Birdy, the movie promises to be the\n\nmost resonant works the Coens have ever done.\n\nAlthough the story's set more than 50 years ago, it captures a distinctively\n\ncontemporary kind of melancholy, an odd, slightly glib passivity that made me\n\nthink of the Japanese novelist Faruki Mordicami(ph). Like a Mordicami hero,\n\nEd is a born observer whose occasional bits of enterprise engender events far\n\nvaster than any he could anticipate. Yet, just when you expect Ed's story to\n\nget really excited and the emotions to deepen, the story gets Coenized. It\n\nloses its way in jokes and mere cleverness. The melancholy is devoured by the\n\nappearance of a comically vainglorious lawyer played by Tony Shalhoub, who\n\nuses Heisenberg's uncertainty principle as a legal defense. And then there's\n\na car crash, which is filmed with such preening self-satisfaction that it\n\ncrushes what we've been feeling for the characters.\n\nThis is, of course, one of the Coens' great problems. Just when you want them\n\nto carry you into the heart of their story, they start giving you free samples\n\nof their brilliance. Absolute control freaks, they're so busy shaping every\n\nsingle image and sound that they lose touch with their deepest emotions and\n\nthemes. This happens in film after film. But why? I've begun to wonder if\n\nthe problem isn't that they're a team. They talk through everything so\n\ncompletely that no messy feelings can ever emerge, and messiness is the stuff\n\nof film noire. Or could the problem be that they're brothers caught in some\n\npeculiar form of arrested adolescent giddying? Then again, maybe they're just\n\nshallow entertainers leery of real emotions, which isn't to say that this new\n\nfilm is as bloodless as, say, \"The Hudsucker Proxy.\"\n\nFor Billy Bob Thornton, who here looks a bit like an exhumed Humphrey Bogart,\n\nplays Ed with a spectral gravity that keeps hinting at depths the movie itself\n\nnever plumbs. Thornton is the very incarnation of an ordinary man's feeling\n\nof entrapment, and watching his odd blend of boredom, disdain, desire and\n\nsadness, you find yourself feeling things that the the Coens glibness keeps\n\ndistracting you from. What breathes life into \"The Man Who Wasn't There\" is\n\nthe actor who so emphatically is.\n\nBOGAEV: John Powers is executive editor of LA Weekly.\n\n(Credits)"
