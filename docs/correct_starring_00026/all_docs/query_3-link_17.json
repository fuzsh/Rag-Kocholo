        "text": "Does the truth always set you free? On the Waterfront is a film that touches on the complexity of this question while exposing power, corruption, and its consequences. The main character, Terry Malloy deals with a personal battle between his morality and what is safest to do. Malloy struggles in finding his own identity that isn't connected to the mob. He struggles with the insecurity of having an identity and what that details. Throughout the film, Malloy startes to uncover his identity and the values in which he believes in.\n\nIn the start of the film, Terry has no identity. Everyone thinks of him as a bum. He is an ex-fighter whose glory days are behind him. He is angry and relies on his tough exterior as a safety net. His identity is controlled by Johnny Friendly, known mob leader. In one of the early scenes, the audience is introduced to Terry and Johnny Friendly in a bar. Johnny Friendly is hitting some man because he tried to cheat Johnny of the money that he owed him. It is obvious that Johnny, the intimidating mob leader has much effect on Terry and everyone else. Throughout the altercation, Terry sits in the bar quietly, acting submissive to Johnny after witnessing the extend in which Johnny induces fear in people. Johnny knows of his power and reminds the other members of their place. Terry accepts his place as a yes man and doesn't dare to stand up to Johnny. His eyes are fearful of Johnny’s power and the consequences of acting against Johnny. After Joey Doyle’s death, the Waterfront Crime Commission approaches Terry to see if he knows of what happened to Joey. Terry is defensive and hard with the officers. He mentions that he has no involvement in the death. Even though Terry is reeking of guilt about setting up Joey, he doesn't tell the officers because of the fear of retaliation by Johnny. He isn't ready yet to stand up to Johnny Friendly.\n\nTerry’s guilt begins to be harder to bear as he gets closer to Edie. He is starting to look at Johnny Friendly as a criminal, a man that shouldn't get away with murder, instead of a powerful man in which he should fear. Terry’s values are shifting as he starts to ponder testifying. He sees the pain in Edie as she wants answers of who killed her brother."
