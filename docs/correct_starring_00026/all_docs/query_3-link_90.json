        "text": "Let me just say On the Waterfront is by far the best black and white movie Ive watched so far. I re-watched most of the movies last night so I can write posts on them and this was my favorite. It had amazing actors, the plot was good and the way it was shot, definitely one of those movies ill watch over and over again when Friday movie night comes. SO back to the blog post and enough of my ramblings of my love for this movie, it was all about that Criminal life of the gangsters of New York City. Something that sounds cool to have but not good to have. So these gangsters owned the city, of course in the illegal way. Its all about that underground world at the docks and the criminals who run the game and the people who were stuck with these criminals, the average working class person. We saw that it sucks to be a snitch regardless of the time era, then and now, you snitch, well its not going to work out for you, even though its the right thing to do. These criminals really had people scared for being a good person. Just look the other way and you’ll be good. If you see something, you don’t say something, it gets you missing.\n\nMy favorite part was the scene in the car with Rod and Brando. Brando blew my mind when he just pushed the gun down because that was not scripted, i mean it made sense because of the way his character was but when actors improvise and they are really in character, the audience cant help but be wowed and touched during those scenes. I love when actors know the character better than the writer. Maybe I am just being biased because I loved Brando from the Godfather.\n\nOn the Waterfront” was, among other things, Kazan’s justification for his decision to testify. In the film, when a union boss shouts, “You ratted on us, Terry,” the Brando character shouts back: “I’m standing over here now. I was rattin’ on myself all those years. I didn’t even know it.” That reflects Kazan’s belief that communism was an evil that temporarily seduced him, and had to be opposed. Brando’s line finds a dramatic echo in A Life, Kazan’s 1988 autobiography, where he writes of his feelings after the film won eight Oscars, including best picture, actor, actress and director: “I was tasting vengeance that night and enjoying it. `On the Waterfront’ is my own story; every day I worked on that film, I was telling the world where I stood and my critics to go and – – – – themselves.”You can feel the passion that was ignited by the HUAC hearings and the defiance of those who named names, or refused to. For some viewers, the buried agenda of “On the Waterfront” tarnishes the picture; the critic Jonathan Rosenbaum told me he could “never forgive” Kazan for using the film to justify himself. But directors make films for all sorts of hidden motives, some noble, some shameful, and at least Kazan was open about his own. And he made a powerful and influential movie, one that continued Brando’s immeasurable influence on the general change of tone in American movie acting in the 1950s. The gangsters push Doyle off the roof to his death, implicating Malloy in the murder as an accomplice. A shocked Malloy had fooled himself into believing Doyle would only be roughed up a little.The neighborhood gathers over Doyle’s body. Pops Doyle, a longshoreman for four decades, tells everyone he had advised his son to be quiet, since his testimony would risk the jobs and lives of all the stevedores. Joey Doyle’s sister Edie, a buttoned-up Catholic teacher trainee who is home visiting from her school, screams passionately for justice over her brother’s corpse. Finally, the local priest Father Barry kneels over Doyle, praying. Besides Edie, the entire waterfront knows what really happened, but no one will speak. At Johnny Friendly’s smoky barroom hangout, Charlie “the Gent” Malloy, Terry’s brother, who serves as Friendly’s right-hand man, is introduced. Terry’s hot temper in this scene indicates that his conscience is wrought by his role in Joey’s death.\n\nI like this realism film that was filmed at New Jersey. Because of shooting on real locations such as docks, workers’ slum dwellings, bars, littered alleys, rooftops etc., I can get some ideas of local conditions at that time. The film attempts to close the life as possible, showing in a neutral style with as little distortion and interference. Distortion means that a change that makes something no longer true or accurate. Therefore, the camera tends to take long, deep focus shots. For example, in the ending, Terry successfully helps to have the mob overthrown, wins the respect of the people, and gets everyone back to work. In a long, deep focus shot, insert close –up, the editing is very classical. I regard it as a classical editing.\n\nThe film conveys a clear message – conscience awakening. This film sets in working class life. It’s not easy to awaken conscience in the struggling of living. In the film, we can see Terry was suffering by his awakening conscience. When he tends to testify, he faces being killed. Friendly wants to kill him unless his brother Charley can intimidate him into keeping quiet. The film deeply reflects the reality, dealing with the social and political issue at that time.\n\nIn my opinion, “on The Waterfront” is one of the best Black and White movies, great shoots, an intriguing script and an amazing casting, Having one of the best actors of all times. This movie is basically based on the criminal life of New York city. gangsters, the band of criminals who owned the city in an illegal way. It portrays the underworld of New York docks and the control the criminals had over other bands in crime, also show the other side of the situation of the people around, the working class people that had to be subjected to these criminal groups. It Talks about how bad it is seen to be a snitch even when you know it’s for something good. No matter what better keep your mouth shut.\n\nThe love story of the movie, he Terry Malloy and Eddie Doyle are two people trying to survive and struggle of helplessness, and despair, and walking towards awareness of it and forgiveness through the love of it Kazan with his keynote offers an extraordinary film that is based on a true story, a great script, The cast all of them wonderful. Marlon Brando Characterized as unique an artist , his avility to improvize With the scrip giving every scene of the movie a more realistic experience. The Most Talked scenes is the one in the cab ride, The lightning, set and the acting of Both actors Were impresive . Also the selection of places of new york city and parts of hoboken NJ fitted perfectly to the plot. in his brilliant debut film, Marlon Brando the main character rewarded for what is probably the best performance any actor has ever captured on a movie screen . The sublime sequence Brando talking to his brother in the car, or some modestly intimate sequences between Brando and Eva Marie Saint in which the actor reaches a unique acting experience.\n\nMost people think that in this movie, Elia Kazan tried to justify his denouncement against his old comrades of the communist party to The House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC). In the movie “On The Water Front”, he portrays the dockworkers union as a mob, making the audience believe that unions, communists and the mob are the same thing. Despite the political connotations, director Elia Kazan creates a masterpiece. This movie won eight academy awards including, best director, best motion picture, best actor and best supporting actress.\n\nIn this film, the director wants the audience to witness a community dominated by fear, where fear has become part of its inhabitants. Even though Marlon Brando interpretation stands above the rest, all the characters are well directed and they add much to the movie. One of my favorite scenes is when the boss is choosing who will work for the day. I like this scene because you can see a close up of the faces of all the workers. By looking at the faces of the workers you can tell that the corrupted union dominates them and they are afraid they will not get selected to work. Another scene that I enjoyed is the conversation between Terry and his brother Charlie in the back seat of a car. In this conversation, Charlie tells his brother Terry that he is a loser and he could have been a great boxer. Even though the scene is shot in a steady car, the director makes the car look like it is moving through lighting and different camera angles.\n\nOn the Waterfront is a 1954 American crime drama film directed by Elia Kazan and written by Budd Schulberg. This is a powerful film that deals with values such as a belief that honesty is always the best policy. This is what the main character Terry does when he stands up to the mobsters who have iron-fist control of the waterfront. He’s done what no man would do because of the risk of being seriously hurt or even killed. Due to him testifying against the mobsters it was very unlikely he would be able to find employment anywhere on the waterfront. When he shows up during recruitment at the docks he gets beaten nearly to death. What happened in the film is similar to what happened with the director Elia Kazan. He named eight former group theater members who he said had been Communists and was labeled a rat like Terry in the film. I believe Elia Kazan did the right thing because he gave people hope to stand up against the wrong and evil just like how On the Waterfront portrays it.\n\nOn the Waterfront is about a young man (Terry) who struggles with the death of his best friend who was killed by the mob, and the conflict in interest between his allegiance to the mob and the future love of his life. After the mob killed Joey, Johnny Friendly – the leader of the mob and union boss of the waterfront – told the rest of the waterfront to keep quiet and threatened them by telling them they would suffer the same fate as Joey. Terry eventually overcomes Friendly’s iron-fist and gets through his ambivalence by getting closer to Joey’s sister. Ultimately, she gets through to Terry’s consequence and urges him to testify in court against Friendly, saying that that is the only way he would earn back his dignity.\n\nIronically the director, Elia Kazan was put in the same predicament in the early 1950s regarding the “Hollywood Blacklist” scandal. He was a key witness during the trials that eventually ousted some of Hollywood’s elite because of the general public’s fear of communist expansion in the western world during the Cold War. His testimony helped destroy many people’s careers, regardless if they were innocent, at the cost of his own career. His testimony was frowned upon by his friends and colleagues in the movie industry and cost the famed director at achieving the same type of success he had in earlier years.\n\nOne of his closest friends and colleagues was famed screenwriter and author Arthur Miller. At the time of the scandal, Miller and Kazan were already known for frequently collaborating together in many projects however, after news of Kazan’s testimony broke out Miller was outraged and rejected his friendship with Kazan. Their friendship was viewed in the same light as the brothers in the film. Terry and his brother, Charley “The Gent” were both very close in the mob but when Terry started getting cold feet and considered testifying against Friendly, the mob ordered Charley to kill his brother. This did not sit well with Charley as he was conflicted with the idea of killing his brother as well as keeping his allegiance to the mob. Kazan used the relationship between Terry and Charley as a metaphor for his relationship with Miller. He considered Miller to be a close enough friend and regarded him highly enough to be his “brother” but when he was being ousted in the same manner as Terry, both Charley and Miller stuck to their unions and turned their backs on their brother when they needed them most.\n\nOn the Waterfront (1954) is a mob drama about exploitation. I think that the movie was great, but it was a little hard to follow in the beginning. This film showed that you can stand up to corruption and evil without a big battle ending in tons of bloodshed. I believe that this movie has the theme of human dignity. Terry Malloy standing up to the mob was inspirational. The fact that he changed his way at the end was amazing. He went from wanting to kill Johnny Friendly to just simply stand up to show him that he was the stronger man.\n\nThe film was a success for director Elia Kazan, receiving 12 Academy Award nominations, of which it won eight including awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), Best B&W Cinematography and Best Art Design.\n\nWhat can I say about this film? I loved it! Movies involving the mob instantly grab my attention. On the waterfront starred Marlon Brando as Terry, who witnesses the murder of Edie’s brother, who he later falls in love with. As Terry and Edie get closes together, Edie asks Terry if he would be able to testify against the people who were responsible for the death of her brother, the mob. The mob was led by Johnny Friendly who took in Terry, and used Terry to run errands. As Johnny Friendly finds out that Terry might testify against him, he makes Terry’s brother, Charley, to give Terry an ultimatum. Either work for Johnny Friendly or not see the light of day again. Terry declines the offer after Charley pulls a gun on Terry in a taxi, but does not shoot. Charley lets him go and takes the blame for after Terry pours his heart out, blaming Jimmy for being responsible of how Terry turned out to be as he grew older. After seeing the death of Charley due to him not fulfilling his duties of controlling the situation with Terry, Terry becomes frustrated and marches down to Johnny Friendly. The quests falls through as Terry had no other choice but to testify against Johnny Friendly in order to give him what he deserves.\n\nI loved how the story unfolds throughout the whole movie and how the suspense keeps intensifying. The last scene was golden to me. The fact that Terry helped every worker realize the wrong doing of Johnny Friendly and not being afraid to stand up to him, showed a lot of heart. As everyone refused to work unless Terry worked, Terry stood up, limping to the entry of his job. Him limping not only showed heart, but it gave people something to believe in and made people appreciate Terry for what he did in order to end the evil ways of Johnny Friendly."
