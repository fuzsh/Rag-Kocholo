        "text": "(1924–2004). American actor Marlon Brando gained fame for his visceral, brooding characterizations in such films as On the Waterfront (1954) and The Godfather (1972). He is considered one of the most powerful actors in the history of cinema.\n\nMarlon Brando, Jr., was born on April 3, 1924, in Omaha, Neb. He moved to New York City in 1943 and studied acting at the Dramatic Workshop. He made his Broadway debut the following year. His emotionally charged performance as Stanley Kowalski in the Elia Kazan-directed production of Tennessee Williams’s A Streetcar Named Desire (1947) earned critical raves and became perhaps the definitive interpretation of the role.\n\nBrando soon left the stage for Hollywood, making his motion-picture debut in The Men (1950) and receiving his first Academy Award nomination for his work in the screen adaptation of A Streetcar Named Desire (1951). Three more Academy Award nominations greeted his performances in Viva Zapata! (1952), Julius Caesar (1953), and On the Waterfront, for which he received the best-actor Oscar. Another film from this period, The Wild One (1953), in which Brando played an outlaw biker, solidified his iconoclastic image.\n\nAlthough Brando had continued success with such films as Desirée (1954), Guys and Dolls (1955), Teahouse of the August Moon (1956), Sayonara (1957), and The Young Lions (1958), his career declined in the 1960s. Several of his films, including a lavish remake of Mutiny on the Bounty (1962), flopped. Two films in the early 1970s, however, brought him renewed acclaim: The Godfather, for which he won his second best-actor Oscar (an award he refused to accept in protest against the plight of Native Americans), and the Bernardo Bertolucci-directed Last Tango in Paris (1972).\n\nBrando’s other notable films included Superman (1978), Apocalypse Now (1979), A Dry White Season (1989), The Freshman (1990), Don Juan DeMarco (1995), Free Money (1998), and The Score (2001). An autobiography, Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me, appeared in 1994. Brando died on July 1, 2004, in Los Angeles, Calif."
