They recognize several different recipients, have runners-up, and have third place. Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.\n\nThis list includes the awards and nominations of actor Marlon Brando. He received his first prize, the Theatre World Awards, for his debut performances on the Broadway stages in New York City.[1]\n\nBrando made a cinematic impression instantly with his debut performance in The Men (1950),[2] which he succeeded with his iconic portrayal of Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951).[3] He received his first of four consecutive Oscar nominations for the latter,[4] which is a record in the Best Actor category and just 1 shy of the grand total held by both Bette Davis and Greer Garson, with 5 each, in Best Actress. And both performances were recognized by the Jussi Awards, equivocal to a Finnish Oscar.\n\nHe would next receive Oscar nominations for portraying Emiliano Zapata in Viva Zapata! (1952);[5] Mark Antony in Julius Caesar (1953);[6] and finally, Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront (1954), for which he garnered his first Academy Award and Golden Globe victory.[7] He also received three consecutive BAFTA Film Awards for Zapata, Caesar, and Waterfront, respectively, as Best Foreign Actor. He also won the Cannes Best Actor prize for Viva Zapata!.\n\nHe earned further Golden Globes attention as Best Comedy/Musical Actor for The Teahouse of the August Moon (1956),[8] but also some backlash for doing \"yellowface\" (white actors portraying Asian characters). Sayonara (1957) earned him his fifth Oscar nomination,[9] and third Globe recognition for a film. The Young Lions (1958) netted him his fourth BAFTA nomination.[10] And The Ugly American (1963) garnered him his fourth Golden Globe nomination for a performance.[11]\n\nHis iconic role as Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather (1972) accrued nominations from all 3 awards contingents.[12] He received his second Academy Award and another Golden Globe, but controversially declined both awards.[13] At the 1973 Oscars telecast, he sent Sacheen Littlefeather in his place to announce his refusal on behalf of \"Hollywood's unfavorable depiction of Native Americans\".[14]\n\nHe followed that up with his highly acclaimed performance in the controversial film, Last Tango in Paris (1972), earning his seventh Academy Award nomination.[15] The Jupiter Awards honored his performance in Apocalypse Now (1979),[16] and he won an Emmy Award portraying neo-nazi George Lincoln Rockwell in the television miniseries Roots: The Next Generations (1979).[17] He was also nominated by the Directors Guild of America for his directorial achievement on One-Eyed Jacks (1961),[18] a film which also won him the Golden Shell at the San Sebastián International Film Festival.[19]\n\nHis career featured some critically panned performances, notably in The Formula (1980) and The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996), both of which earned dubious distinction from the Razzie Awards and Stinkers Bad Movie Awards. He won Worst Supporting Actor for the latter film from both organizations. However, he did receive his eighth Oscar nomination, and subsequent BAFTA and Golden Globe recognition, for his supporting performance in A Dry White Season (1989).[20] These would become his final major distinctions in his six-decades-long career.[21]\n\nMajor film awards[edit]\n\nTable key § Indicates a declined award † Indicates a posthumous award\n\nAcademy Awards[edit]\n\nAcademy Awards Year Category Nominated work Character Result Ref. 1952 Best Actor A Streetcar Named Desire Stanley Kowalski Nominated [3][4] 1953 Viva Zapata!
