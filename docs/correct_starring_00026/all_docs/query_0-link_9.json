        "text": "U.S., 1954\n\nDirected by Elia Kazan\n\nStarring Marlon Brando, Eva Marie Saint, Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger\n\nScreenplay by Budd Schulberg\n\nCinematography by Boris Kaufman\n\nMusic by Leonard Bernstein\n\nApprox. 108 min. DCP.\n\n“I coulda been a contender,” agonizes Marlon Brando’s pigeon-raising ex-pug Terry Malloy, as he gets mixed up in corruption and murder in a Hoboken longshoremen’s union, thanks to brother/mob mouthpiece Rob Steiger, then must face victim’s sister Eva Marie Saint. Winner of 8 Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actress, Screenplay (Budd Schulberg) and Cinematography (Boris Kaufman). “In the category of undercover political statement, ON THE WATERFRONT, the work of two friendly witnesses, Elia Kazan and Budd Schulberg, stands on its own.. There are no communists here, but [John] Friendly [Cobb] and the plutocrats who support him are akin to the thug like Reds in many of the era’s reactionary films and to the Mafia-like Klan in STORM WARNING, the era’s other major drama about bearing witness. And the government commission before which Terry confesses would have evoked for contemporary viewers the HUAC hearings about communists in Hollywood. Terry’s decision to become a friendly witness against his union boss is not made lightly: the core of the film, and of Brando’s incandescent performance, is the inner drama that precedes the character’s public testimony.” – Foster Hirsch\n\nReviews"
