        "text": "Local scene:\n\nThe building blocks of a classic film must be on the page well before shooting, and Schulberg's script is certainly that. Based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning series of articles called \"Crime on the Waterfront,\" written by Malcolm Johnson for the New York Sun, the script expertly creates a setting and several characters before weaving all the threads together. And once the film reaches its climax, it goes to a whole other level.\n\nA film can fall apart if the sets aren't 100 percent believable. Day's vision of the docks and seedy New York streets are perfect, even by today's standards. The bar, the rooftops, the factory, etc., all help move the story along to its dramatic conclusion by creating reality.\n\nThe actress who would go on to work with everyone from Hitchcock (\"North by Northwest\") to Superman (\"Superman Returns\") came strong out of the gate in this, her feature film debut. Saint played the virginal sister of a murdered dockworker and eventual love interest of Terry Malloy. Her understated performance blended youthful longing and family morals and was fantastic, especially since she's pretty much the only woman in the movie. And though she was the only supporting actor to win an Oscar, three of the men were nominated for their supporting work, too: Lee J. Cobb, Karl Malden and Rod Steiger.\n\nSomeone has to have an overall vision in his or her head when making a movie. Performances, script, lighting, editing, music, sound and more must be considered at every turn if a film is going to be considered a success. Elia Kazan did all that and so much more with \"On the Waterfront.\" Besides all the awards listed here, the film's editing and cinematography were also Oscar winners under Kazan's watchful eye. It was also Kazan who completely bought into Brando's interpretation of Terry, leading to the classic \"contender\" scene and overall feel.\n\nBrando's method performance as the conflicted prizefighter pretty much set the bar for what a male performance could be. To this day it's still referenced as one of the best ever. The way Brando switches from awkward to confident or from charming to evil without missing a beat all the while remaining totally believable is fantastic to watch. And his sturdiness at the end of the film ties together the entire thing.\n\nOn Oscar night, after winning seven of the first 11 awards it had been nominated for, there was probably no doubt that \"On the Waterfront\" would win its eighth, Best Picture. To this day, the film is still rightly honored as one of the best ever. The American Film Institute named it the No. 8 best movie of all time (though it slipped to 19th place on an updated list), and it's one of a handful of films preserved by the Library of Congress.\n\nWhat: \"On the Waterfront\" Where: Bardavon Opera House, 35 Market St., Poughkeepsie When: 7:30 p.m. March 28 Tickets: $5 Call: 473-2072 Visit: www.bardavon.org\n\nIF YOU GO!"
