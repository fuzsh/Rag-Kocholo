        "text": "Marlon Brando was not the first actor to bring more naturalistic acting techniques to a broader audience—but with his earth-shattering performance in 1954’s On the Waterfront, he may as well have been. A theater actor trained in New York by the legendary Stella Adler, Brando broke big when he reprised his Broadway performance as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire for the 1951 screen adaptation. But it was On the Waterfront, the mournful crime drama that Elia Kazan made in the wake of the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings, that won Brando his first Oscar, and set the template for screen performances that stays with us to this day.\n\nOn this week’s Little Gold Men podcast, Richard Lawson, Joanna Robinson, and guest Anthony Breznican look back at On the Waterfront, and why Brando’s performance felt like such a bolt from the blue at the time. They also look back at Kazan’s controversial role in the anti-Communist witch hunt of the era, and how his history remains tied up in what many regard as his best film.\n\nThe jam-packed episode also includes an appearance by David Canfield to break down all the details of Awards Insider, Vanity Fair’s new home for all things awards, including detailed coverage of the Emmys race as nominations-round voting wraps up early next week. There’s also discussion of the upcoming Fast and Furious movie, the ongoing scandal within the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, and two final interviews from Emmy contenders: Katey Rich talks to Ted Lasso star and writer Brett Goldstein as well as Hacks star Hannah Einbinder.\n\nTake a listen to the episode above, and find Little Gold Men on Apple Podcasts or anywhere else you get your podcasts.
