Winner of 8 Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actress, Screenplay (Budd Schulberg) and Cinematography (Boris Kaufman). DCP. Approx. 108 mins. \nCritical quotes:\n\n“A HEART-CLUTCHER FROM BEGINNING TO END!”\n– J. Hoberman, Village Voice\n\n“One of the best performances ever recorded on celluloid.”\n– David Shipman\n\n“If there is a better performance by a man in the history of film in America, I don’t know what it is.”\n– Kazan\n\n“Pretty ELECTRIFYING.”\n– Geoff Andrew, Time Out (London)\n\n“Eva Marie Saint, Karl Malden, and Lee J. Cobb are all as good as they've ever been.”\n– Jonathan Rosenbaum\n\nTHE WILD ONE \n\nShowtimes: 2:40, 6:30, 10:20\nURGENT TEXT: Starring Marlon Brando \n\n(1953, Laslo Benedek) “What’re you rebelling against?” “Whaddya got?” In an image that launched a million posters, biker Marlon Brando and his gang zoom into Wrightsville (get it?) and shake things up but good – but there’s Lee Marvin’s off-the-wall rival leader to contend with. DCP. Approx. 79 mins. \n\nCritical quotes:\n\n“A sleazy good time.”\n– Dave Kehr, Chicago Reader",
