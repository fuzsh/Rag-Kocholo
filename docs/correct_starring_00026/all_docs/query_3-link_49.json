        "text": "‚ÄúI coulda‚Äô been a contender.‚Äù Terry Malloy\n\nIt‚Äôs dark and dirty on the docks in Hoboken, New Jersey, a jungle of crime and corruption. Squeal and you‚Äôll have a convenient ‚Äúaccident,‚Äù the longshoremen unloading your carcass with the same muscled efficiency they use to ply their trade.\n\nBetter to keep your head down, as ex-prize fighter Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) does, until the parish priest and the girl he loves give him the courage to stand up to his corrupt union boss, Johnny Friendly.\n\nThis 1954 film earned 8 Oscars, most notably for Best Picture, Best Director (Elia Kazan), Best Actor (Marlon Brando) and Best Actress (Eva Marie Saint in her film debut). And its fine cast and script shine as brightly today as they did over a half-century ago.\n\nBut that‚Äôs not the only reason to see this film. It is a reminder of how quality often blooms under restrictions, like the ‚Äúterrible beauty‚Äù of the desert-bred Arabian horse.\n\nThere were few if any special effects available or used in this film. In fact, On the Waterfront could almost be presented as a stage play. In the age of Technicolor, the director wisely opted for black and white. And given the relentlessly cheery bold tones of color film back then, it was a good choice. Today we could mute the tones and give even a color film the right darker atmosphere, but not then.\n\nAnd then we had the Motion Picture Code that put great limits on sex: even ‚Äúexcessive and lustful kissing‚Äù was forbidden. Violence was reined in, too. ‚ÄúBrutal killings were not to be presented in detail.‚Äù\n\nIf you were born after 1970, you might be wondering how they even put together movies under those restrictions. Well, they did it the old fashioned way, by creating characters and a story we cared about.\n\nMany people remember Marlon Brando for his excellent portrayal of Vito Corleone in The Godfather (1972), his grey hair slicked back, his jowls protruding, his raspy voice one of cynicism and command.\n\nIn On the Waterfront, less than 2 decades earlier, Brando electrifies his audiences with a character almost diametrically opposed to Vito. He is not the well-dressed and almost courtly gentleman as Vito is. Terry is blue collar down to his bones; even the way he chews his gum is a working class art form. An ex prize fighter, Terry is all tough guy on the outside.\n\n‚ÄúHey, you wanna hear my philosophy of life? Do it to him before he does it to you,‚Äù he tells Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint).\n\nBut the same guy dotes on the pigeons he raises on the roof, and he is almost shy and tongue-tied in Edie‚Äôs presence. There‚Äôs a kind of Rocky humility, self-deprecation, and sweetness under the rough exterior. In fact, I‚Äôd bet Syvestor Stallone channeled Brando‚Äôs Terry Malloy for his Italian Stallion role.\n\nConversely, Eva Marie Saint, taking the part Grace Kelly rejected, gives her sweet Edie an inner toughness and a stubborn quest for justice. She will not rest until she finds out who was responsible for her brother Joey‚Äôs death. Blond, blue-eyed, and porcelain skin aside, she is no fragile beauty, telling Terry,\n\nI never met anyone like you. There's not a spark of sentiment or romance or human kindness in your whole body.\n\nShe angrily kicks Terry out of her apartment and then melts into his arms with equal tenderness. In fact, their rather chaste love scenes together capture passion much more accurately than the obligatory sexual romps we usually get today. And that underlying passion is quite a few degrees hotter than Grace Kelly‚Äôs imperious flirtation with Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window, the film Grace Kelly preferred to this one.\n\nLee J. Cobb is wonderful as the guy we love to hate, the ironically named corrupt union boss Johnny Friendly. While his right hand man, Rod Steiger, shows us just a patch of honor as Terry‚Äôs big brother. There are things even he cannot do.\n\nBut perhaps my favorite is Karl Malden‚Äôs priest, Father Barry, recalling the pivotal and positive roles religious figures used to hold in our films. Unlike the debased clerics Hollywood routinely exposes today, Malden is a force for goodness. ‚ÄúGoing My Way with brass knuckles,‚Äù as the film trailer promises. The religious tone of his Sermon on the Docks speech is one we find today only in the religious niche market.\n\nBooze for a Bunch: Group {Cocktail Recipes}\n\nI‚Äôm a huge fan of entertaining. It‚Äôs not unusual for me to host a get together at my apartment before hitting up the Hoboken bars with my friends. I always put out some snacks for people to munch on, but let‚Äôs be honest, what‚Äôs most important is the booze.\n\nWhile beer tends to please most guests and doesn‚Äôt break the bank, it‚Äôs a pain in terms of clean up. I‚Äôd rather not have to deal with all those empty bottles and cans. Some people can be fussy about what kind of wine they drink, and I always fret about not having what my guests will like. And while cocktails are always a hit, they require someone to be constantly mixing and serving.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I always opt for a drink that can be made in large batches and easily replenished. The following recipes are not only super simple, but dangerously delicious. ‚Äì Katherine Shaw of Hoboken, New Jersey\n\nGin Bucket\n\nThis one is as easy as it gets, with so few ingredients. I like to remain true to the name and present this lovely drink to my guests in an actual bucket.\n\n1 ¬Ω liters Gin\n\n2 liters lemon-lime soda\n\nLemons and limes sliced in rounds (the more the better)\n\nMix all ingredients together in a bucket with ice at least 20 minutes prior to serving. For extra lemon and lime flavor, squeeze some fresh juice into the mixture.\n\nHoboken Happy Hours.com"
