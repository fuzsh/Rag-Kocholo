        "text": "A recent poster for ‘On The Waterfront’ designed by Olly Moss for the Alamo Drafthouse 2010 Rolling Roadshow.\n\nThe performance of Terry Malloy in director Elia Kazan’s On The Waterfront won Marlon Brando his first Oscar and boasted success for the method acting style.\n\nAs many actors look up to Brando’s performance as a testament to the power of method acting, the following set of steps will dissect Terry Malloy’s actions through an analysis of a scene most pivotal in the development of his character arc, and overall flow of the narrative.\n\nIn this scene from the film, Terry makes the decision to confess his role in the murder of Joey Doyle to Father Barry (Karl Malden), following the death of Kayo Dugan and his relationship of affection with Edie (Eva Marie Saint).\n\nWhen Terry enters this scene, his alignment is opposed to Father Barry, and in accordance with Edie. It’s initial setting of the father’s church contextualizes the themes of forgiveness and hope that are at play. The placement of the two characters are initially seen as separate, but once Terry exhibits his guilt, the characters form a sense of trust. As Father Barry is a representation of lawful good, he calls upon Terry to face the past and tell the truth to Edie, waiting down at the pier below.\n\nThe matter of Terry’s conscience is what drives his admission. In his conversation with Father Barry, the main action of the scene, he speaks of his role within the Longshoremen’s Union as ‘like carrying a monkey on your back’. This attitude towards his involvement in criminal activity speaks volumes about his conflict, as such when Father Barry mentions the aspect of conscience following a lengthy talk, we see Terry caught within his own mind, expressively avoiding the subject through looking back and forth, away from him.\n\nTerry’s greatest motivation to admit the truth are his feelings towards Edie. He speaks of her as being ‘the first nice thing that’s ever happened to him’. Without her involvement his decision to be swayed would not have happened otherwise. When Edie is first visualized in this scene from behind the pier gates, and her mention which causes Terry to awkwardly fidget, it visually represents Terry’s thought of losing her that he is at risk to lose, by threatening the admiration she holds for him.\n\nThe style of action that the scene undertakes is one of a historical basis, new actions are taken that, while are influenced by past events, ultimately change the narrative and drive the characters through new directive pathways. This leads into the main event of the scene, in which Terry confesses to Edie, brandishing a look of horror across her face. His revelation is delivered with sincerity and good intentions, but it’s not enough to compensate for his previous actions.\n\nThe sequence is primarily reactive, given that it is in part a reflection on Terry; what he has done and what he is challenged to do as his primary conflict. While he emerges with sympathy over his guilt, generating a more fully-formed character, he does it at the cost of potentially losing the Edie’s affection, as displayed by the distance she now embodies between them.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
