        "text": "The Godfather\n\n“It’s not personal. It’s business.” (1972)\n\nBrando's performance as Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather is considered one of his greatest. At the time he took this role, Brando had not been in a commercially successful film since The Young Lions in 1958.\n\nThe Godfather\n\n\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\" (1972)\n\nBrando earned his second Academy Award for this performance, but he did not accept it. He sent Native American actress Sacheen Littlefeather in his place. She announced that Brando declined the Oscar to protest the film industry's portrayal of Native Americans.\n\nThe Godfather\n\n\"Someday — and that day may never come — I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, accept this justice as gift on my daughter's wedding day.\" (1972)\n\nBrando's makeup team put cotton balls in his cheeks and shoe polish in his hair to transform him into the Corleone family boss.\n\nOn the Waterfront\n\n\"Hey, you wanna hear my philosophy of life? Do it to him before he does it to you.\" (1954)\n\nBrando starred in On the Waterfront as Terry Malloy, a dock worker who gets caught up in union violence and corruption. Brando won the 1955 Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance.\n\nOn the Waterfront\n\n“You don’t understand. I coulda' had class. I coulda' been a contender. I could’ve been somebody instead of a bum, which is what I am. Let’s face it.\" (1954)\n\nIn his famous \"I coulda' been a contender\" scene, Brando took the liberty to follow his own intuition. Diverting from director Elia Kazan's vision, he improvised by gently pushing away the gun his brother held to his head. Kazan later admitted, \"If there is a better performance by a man in the history of film in America, I don't know what it is.\"\n\nThe Wild One\n\n“Nobody tells me what to do. You keep needlin' me, if I want to, I'm gonna take this joint apart and you're not gonna know what hit you.\" (1953)\n\nBrando rode his own Triumph Thunderbird 6T motorcycle when he played Johnny Strabler, a motorcycle gang leader, in The Wild One."
