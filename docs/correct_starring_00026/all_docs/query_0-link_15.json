        "text": "This thread is for all manner of discussion about On the Waterfront, the 1954 Elia Kazan film, starring Marlon Brando. Leonard Bernstein composed the score. Kazan shot on location in Hoboken, New Jersey. The film was a big hit at the Oscars, with the film garnering the following awards for the cast and crew:\n\nBest Picture for Producer Sam Spiegel\n\nBest Director for Director Kazan\n\nBest Actor for Brando\n\nBest Supporting Actor for Eva Marie Saint\n\nBest Story and Screenplay for Budd Schulberg\n\nBest Art Direction (Black and White) for Richard Day\n\nBest Cinematography for Boris Kaufman\n\nBest Film Editing for Gene Milford\n\nThere is a Criterion Collection Blu-ray that includes the film displayed in various aspect ratios (1.66:1, 1.85: 1, and 1.33:1), as theaters transitioned to a widescreen format around 1954.\n\nOne of my top ten movies for many reasons.\n\nI learned a few years ago that the roof scenes with the pigeons were filmed on my great aunt and uncle's roof in Hoboken. My uncle was an immigrant from Norway and worked on the Hoboken docks for many years.\n\nKazan, Brando and company hit it out of the park with this one."
