        "meta_description": "Purchase On the Waterfront on digital and stream instantly or download offline. Marlon Brando gives one of the screen's most electrifying performances as Best Actor in this 1954 Academy Award® winner for Best Film. Ex-fighter Terry Malloy (Brando) could have been a contender but now toils for boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) on the gang-ridden waterfront. Terry is guilt-stricken, however, when he lures a rebellious worker to his death. But it takes the love of Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint), the dead man's sister, to show Terry how low he has fallen. When his crooked brother Charley the Gent (Rod Steiger) is brutally murdered for refusing to kill him, Terry battles to crush Friendly's underworld empire. Directed by Elia Kazan (A Streetcar Named Desire) and written by Budd Schulberg (What Makes Sammy Run?), this unforgettable drama about Terry's redemption is among the most acclaimed of all films.",

        "text": "On the Waterfront is a film that would change cinema for years to come.\n\nJuly 4, 2024\n\nMalloy makes an unlikely proxy for Kazan, though. A former boxer with the eyes of a showgirl, he was the role of a lifetime for Brando, whose Method-schooled blend of machismo and vulnerability redefined acting for a generation.\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nThe supporting cast is wonderful, but it’s Brando who lights up every part of this film.\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\nThe performances in the film have a magnificent intelligence and strength, shaped and guided incomparably by Kazan, a master of Broadway and Hollywood.\n\nApril 3, 2024\n\nIt has a persuasiveness of characterization, for the most part, rare on the American screen, not because actors are lacking to convey it but because it is so seldom elicited either by their material or their directors.\n\nJanuary 17, 2024\n\nEven though there's not a single scene where sluggers dance around within the confines of a ring, Kazan's film is in fact a boxing film in disguise.\n\nDecember 7, 2023\n\nKnown for the powerful portrayal of anguish that permanently changed acting, Marlon Brando gives one of – if not THE – greatest performances of all time.\n\nJune 8, 2023\n\nThe film is splendidly acted. This is the third time that Marlon Brando has played under Kazan's direction, and this time my reservations about his gifts disappear. As the racketeer's errand boy... his performance is magnificent.\n\nAugust 8, 2022\n\nIt is one of the most powerful American movies of the 50s, and few movies caused so much talk, excitement, and dissension -- largely because of Marlon Brando's performance as the inarticulate, instinctively alienated bum, Terry Malloy.\n\nJuly 28, 2022\n\nAlthough there is excellent support -- notably from Lee J. Cobb and Karl Malden -- without Mr. Brando’s pervasive personality On the Waterfront could certainly not have been what it now is: the best American picture seen so far this year.\n\nFebruary 10, 2022"
