On the Waterfront was the film of the year in 1954, picking up eight Oscars. A hard hitting (and political) movie set on the docks of New York, and dealing with Union corruption, loyalty, broken dreams and more.

Eva Marie Saint won Best Supporting Actress, Elia Kazan won Best Director, but for most people, the movie was Marlon Brando’s, as he won his first Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of ex prizefighter, Terry Malloy.

This is an original US Lobby Card, produced for the film’s original cinema release. The scene features Brando, Saint and Malden, and there is also the (larger than usual) border artwork, using the memorable main poster advertising imagery.
