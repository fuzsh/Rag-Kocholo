        "text": "- Issac Andrew Sterett, 10, of Owensboro, passed away Friday, July 10, 2020. He was the son of Tres (William L Sterett III) and Katie Sterett. Tres is the CEO and owner of Sterett Crane & Rigging. Issac was a 5th grader at Highland Elementary School where he served on the Lighthouse, Archery, and Cross-Country Teams. He loved to learn and eagerly operated lawn equipment and a pressure washer and often cleaned his dad’s offices. His father chose his name which means “laughter” and Issac brought so much of it to those in his world. His grandfather, Bill Sterett “Poppy”, passed away in 2004. Along with his parents, Issac is survived by his three brothers, Will, Max, Reid, and his dog Spidey; his Meems, Janet Sterett; Mamaw and Papaw, Janet and Mark Luckett; and many aunts, uncles, and cousins. Details on Issac’s celebration of life will be listed on the First Christian Church website, fccowb.org/issac-sterett/. Expressions in celebration of Issac Sterett can be directed to: Issac Sterett Adventure Foundation, P.O. Box 22873 Owensboro, KY 42304.
