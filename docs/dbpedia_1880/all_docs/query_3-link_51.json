As a department, we are very proud of our accom- plishments this past year. Some of the highlights include an Atmospheric Sciences program that is growing by leaps and bounds. This year they placed their first graduate in a broad- cast booth as a weather forecaster. David Polly, our newly named Schrock Professor, and several other faculty have been instrumental in landing a multi-disciplinary, multi-department, multi-million dollar Grand Challenges grant entitled “Prepared for Environmental Change.” Chen Zhu, our reigning aqueous geochemist, has been named a fellow of the American Association for the Ad- vancement of Science (AAAS), which is a truly prestigious honor. We remain committed to providing the finest undergraduate and graduate edu- cation possible. Our undergraduates are moving on to graduate school while our graduate students are all finding jobs. Much of this success is due to the support of alumni like you who have generously given to the department in so many dif- ferent ways. The near 60-year-old Geology Building is slated for renovation sometime in the next few years (following a complete renovation of Ballantine Hall on the other side of campus). The upside is that we will have modern teaching and research facilities in the end (though much smaller offices). The downside is that we will have to move much of our work to other buildings on campus for at least a year. Come visit us in a few years and see for yourself what the renovation will have accomplished! All-in-all, it has been a good year for our faculty, staff and students. I am proud to serve as Chair of a department that is full of such fine colleagues and co-workers. Happy Reading Jim Brophy Departmental Chair hgr | 5 find your major path ways New Name, New Curriculum New Undergraduate Curriculum The Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at IU is changing as the fields of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences make new advances and as we expand into new areas like Tectonic Geomorphology, Surface Dynamics, and Atmospheric Sciences. We have introduced a new curriculum to reflect this growth and to provide students with opportunities to explore a wide range of topics in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. Designed as multiple pathways to a successful degree, the curriculum in- cludes three new core introductory ‘Earth’ courses for majors that expose students to the breadth of our fields including G225 Earth Materials, G226 Earth Processes, and G227 Earth History and Climate, and two 300-level courses G314 Data Analysis and G333 Sedimentation and Tectonics. With the exception of Earth Materials and Data Analysis, all courses are team- taught, thus exposing our students to a larger cross section of the faculty early on in their careers. We now offer a B.S. degree in Earth Sciences, a B.S. degree in Atmospheric Sciences, and a B.A. in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. At the upper level, the two B.S. degrees diverge significantly. The B.S. in Earth Sciences permits the packaging of existing geology courses within multiple informal tracks while the B.S. in Atmospheric Sciences includes upper level courses in Atmospheric Sciences. The B.A. in Earth and Atmospheric Sci- ences is very flexible and permits students to package courses at the 100-, 200-, 300- and 400-levels to create a degree that is tailor-made to their own interests. The new “pathways” process helps students choose course offerings that are more closely aligned with career opportunities. These pathways may lead to careers in Geology, Energy and Environment, Integrated Earth Sciences, and Atmospheric Sciences. to CAREERS in EARTH & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES Are you interested in sustainability and environmental issues?

CAREERS in GEOSCIENCES hgr | 7 EARTH AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES INDIANA UNIVERSITY Climate and Earth Processes Climate and Earth processes are two of the most rapidly expanding areas in the geosciences. Research in these areas seeks to understand the character and dynamics of Earth’s habitable zone, especially the com- plex interactions of its biosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and geosphere coupled with human-induced perturbations of these natural systems. It embraces studies of Earth’s climate and its connections operating on multiple spatial and temporal scales with the hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles that are influenced by pervasive surficial processes. Knowledge of these systems, especially their drivers and sensitivities to change, is integral to informed use of energy, mineral, water, and land resources and the environmental consequences of human activities. These advances permit understanding of paleoclimates and ancient environments from key proxies preserved in the rock record that have been verified in the modern world. The critical zone that lies as the interface of the natu- ral and anthropogenic worlds urgently needs improved understanding. Bridges between sub-disciplines of the geosciences that focus on problems such as the role of fluids in Earth systems and controls on the movement of dissolved and suspended materials can help. Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Indiana University possess research expertise in these important do- mains. Research that incorporates observation, analyses, experiments, and modeling has achieved critical in- sights into these geological and biogeochemical pathways, from molecular processes and chemical reactions, to local- and regional-scale water and sediment budgets, and ultimately to global dynamics of atmospheric composition and oceanic temperature. The department is a key player in IU’s Integrated Program in the Environment. 8 | hgr NASA, NOAA analyses reveal record-shattering global warm temperatures in 2015. Posted Jan. 20, 2016 https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/news/20160120/ atmospheric sciences Chanh Kieu, Cody Kirkpatrick, Paul Staten Atmospheric Sciences at Indiana University is a dynamic program with exciting opportunities to under- take field, satellite, or modeling research. Our faculty members actively conduct both observational and modeling studies of weather and climate processes across scales, from cold fronts and tropical cyclones, to global atmospheric cloud and circulation patterns. The Atmospheric Sciences Group is an active participant in the interdisciplinary research of other Earth and Atmospheric Sciences faculty, including paleoclimate research and global climate change studies. The Department’s diverse, close-knit group of researchers enjoys a collective expertise in atmosphere-hy- drosphere-solid Earth interactions. We are among the most active users of IU’s high-performance parallel computing facilities which include the new Big Red II machine - one of the world’s 70 fastest supercomput- ers. CHANH KIEU Assistant Professor | Atmospheric Sciences My research focuses on theoretical and numerical studies of hurricane dynamics and structure. The fun- damental questions that my research group currently tackle are how far in advance can we predict hur- ricane intensity within a given accuracy, the abnormal structure of a hurricane’s inner core at a very high intensity limit, and potential changes in hurricane intensity and frequency in future climates. My research employs extensive theoretical tools along with cloud-resolving model simulations on the IU exceptional high-performance computing system. hgr | 9 climate and Earth processes CODY KIRKPATRICK Lecturer | Atmospheric Sciences Cody conducts research in mesoscale meteorology - the atmospheric scale that includes circulation sizes from tornadoes and individual thunderstorms up to hurricanes - and the high impact weather that these phenomena produce. His primary area of interest is improving our prediction of how thunder- storms move, and understanding why certain storms may produce hail or tornadoes while other storms nearby do not. Recently, he has also cultivated interest in the meteorology of wildfires, and how these conditions may evolve under Earth’s changing climate. On August 21, 2017 EAS faculty and staff participated in a campus-wide “Celeste Fest” celebrating the solar eclipse PAUL STATEN Assistant Professor | Atmospheric Sciences Atmospheric Sciences at Indiana University is “green and growing,” so to speak, and the Staten Lab is no exception. Last year, Staten hosted an international working group on the “Width of the Tropics,” on campus to discuss the evidence for, and consequences of desertification and shifting wind and rain patterns. The Staten lab is also now home to four graduate students, with research topics ranging from modeled tropical rain cycles in Earth’s geologic past to climate’s effects on midlatitude clouds as observed by satellite. Undergraduate students also play an active role in the lab, with a Sustainability Scholar helping to run the weather research forecast model each morning. This model is being used to teach students about water use on campus, and to create high-resolution local forecasts specifically for the upper midwest. Department, college, and campus support continue to provide favorable growing conditions for the Atmospheric Sciences program. The renam- ing to ”Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences” not only high- lights the department’s strength in diversity, but also provides the Atmo- spheric Sciences program a named home. Graduate Fellowships from the college have attracted top talent to the program, and the recently announced Grand Challenge on Environmental Change has spurred the search for new faculty. The new Big Red 2+ and Carbonate supercom- puters provide exciting capabilities and processing power to the active group. Undergraduate student Zoey Mintz forecasts the weather for the coming week on Hoosier News Source. 10 | hgr hgr | 11 climate and Earth processes biogeochemistry Simon Brassell, Erika Elswick, Lisa Pratt, Ed Ripley, Peter Sauer, Juergen Schieber, Arndt Schimmelmann, Laura Wasylenki, Chen Zhu SIMON BRASSELL Professor of Geological Sciences Simon’s research activities continue to be fo- cused on the use of the molecular and isotopic compositions of sediments to elucidate paleo- climates and paleoenvironments, and to study the fate of organic matter in the geosphere. Recent investigations by Devon Colcord as part of her M.S. and Ph.D. studies have included as- sessment of climate records in lake sediments from Greenland, studying cores collected by the GetGamm program led by Lisa Pratt. Two publications in Organic Geochemistry have verified that the distributions of molecules biosynthesized by bacteria known as branched GDGTs (glyc- erol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers) include contributions from autochthonous sources within lakes augmenting their origin from surrounding soils, and confirmed this conclusion by the first direct measurement of the carbon isotope composition of these molecules in collaboration with Professor Ann Pear- son at Harvard University. Another recent publication in Or- ganic Geochemistry reports the results from the M.S. thesis of Amishi Kumar, who elucidated the separate contributions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons originating from both natural and anthropogenic sources of both petrogenic and py- rolytic compounds within sediments from the Santa Barbara Basin, offshore California. Over the past couple of years, investigations led by Ph.D. students Devon Colcord and Andi Shilling are elu- cidating changes in climate recorded by biogeochem- ical indices in a series of early Pleistocene lacustrine sediment cores recovered from Olduvai Gorge. This research is part of a larger collaborative project led by Jackson Njau, Nick Toth, and Kathy Schick that aims to explore environmental change during critical inter- vals of hominin evolution established at Olduvai. The laminated sediment sequence from ~1.8 Ma provides an extraordinary opportunity to determine short-term changes in climate that triggered responses in the lake phytoplankton and surrounding vegetation at a time of high hominin diversity. Simon continues to work on profiling ancient climates and is a co-author of a recent paper focused on a com- prehensive collation of temperature records for the Cretaceous, which has been published in Earth Science Reviews. He is also collaborating with Arndt Schim- melmann and Maria Mastalerz in analysis to better un- derstanding the specific nature of catalytic processes transforming organic matter during diagenesis in the New Albany and other shales. Simon teaches both a fully online introductory ocean- ography course that utilizes web-based resources in student exercises exploring a wide range of oceano- graphic phenomena and a College critical approaches class on records of global climate change. ERIKA ELSWICK Senior Lecturer and Director, Analytical Chemistry Laboratory News From the Analytical Geochemistry Laboratory Erika R. Elswick - Director Fall 2017 has brought a lot of additional activity to the Analytical Geochemistry Laboratory with a full class in Methods in Analytical Geochemistry (G444/G544). In the spring we acquired a new ion chromatograph for the analysis of anions in water samples. The new Thermo/Dionex instrument replaces a much older unit, and is very student friendly. We continue to analyze aqueous solutions and solids for departmental members, as well as colleagues in other departments and units across campus. During the summer of 2017 I embarked on a new project with a colleague to begin to instrument a wetland located in the National Forest land above the IU Field Station associated with the late 19th and early 20th Century mining activities. We ultimately hope to shed some light on this dynamic setting to develop mod- els for remediation at higher altitudes. ​ 12 | hgr ARNDT SCHIMMELMANN Senior Scientist | Organic Geochemistry and Chemical Oceanography Arndt Schimmelmann’s international team of sci- entists from Vietnam, Germany, and Indiana Uni- versity identified subterranean microbes in caves to voraciously consume the strong greenhouse trace gas methane from air. Cave air typically ex- changes with the atmosphere on short time scales. Methane depletion in cave air on several conti- nents indicates that the subterranean microbial sink for methane is substantial enough to warrant inclusion in global greenhouse gas modeling. In contrast, laboratory experiments at Indiana Uni- versity with strong radiation from radon isotopes excluded the possibility that elevated natural ra- dioactivity in caves can significantly contribute to oxidation of methane in air. Furthermore, Schimmelmann’s team continues to develop remediation strategies to mitigate radiation geohazards in mud-built homes in de- veloping countries (see website: http://eosvnu. net/projects/mud-built-homes/). Outreach ac- tivities in mountain villages established person- al contacts and reliable logistic support for our research. As a third collaborative research project with Vietnam National University in Hanoi, the lam- inated sediment from a volcanic maar lake in central Vietnam near Pleiku is being explored as a geological ar- chive for prehistorical monsoon strength. The record of distinct flood layers of the past can be radiocarbon-dated and may offer a reliable statistical basis to judge the effects of climate change on modern precipitation patterns in central Vietnam. Two images from sediment coring activities in a central Vietnamese maar lake. The image on the left shows our mobile coring platform where inner tubes from trucks provide flota- tion. The entire platform with anchors cost only about $150 and worked extremely well. We pulled 20 wonderful sediment cores from up to 21 m water depth with penetration into sediment of up to 3.5 meter. At one time we needed a special heavy-duty core catcher. On the right, a local machine shop in Pleiku lathed a core catcher for us from an old rusty artillery shell at a few hours notice. In Vietnam everything is possible if you know your way around. Our Vietnamese colleagues are experts in improvising. LAURA WASYLENK I Associate Professor of Geological Sciences | Biogeochemistry of Metals Laura Wasylenki was on sabbatical in 2016-17, spending seven months at Stanford Universi- ty and three months at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland. She is in- vestigating mineral-fluid reactions that attenuate the migration of toxic heavy metals in soils and near-surface groundwater. At the Stanford Syn- chrotron Radiation Lightsource, she shone bright beams of X-rays onto samples of iron and manga- nese oxyhydroxide particles that she had loaded with small amounts of tungsten, a likely carcino- gen that has been widely introduced to the envi- ronment during weapons production and testing. She is studying the molecular-scale mechanisms by which adsorption to common soil particles can immobilize this toxic metal. She plans to test some of the new knowledge derived in the laboratory on a tungsten-contaminated field site in SW Indiana with new graduate student Coley Smith. In Switzerland, Wasylenki began a collaboration with an environmental micro- biology group interested in molecular-scale mechanisms of uranium immobilization. While in Switzerland, she also made time to observe with great joy plenty of steeply dip- ping Jurassic carbonates adorned with Late Holocene gla- ciers and was joined on one occasion by former student Michael Haluska, M.S. ’15.

The heart and soul of Doug’s research group are the scientists and students. That is why Doug is so pleased with the recent success of people in his group. Notably, two post-doc- toral researchers under Doug’s supervision have accepted fac- ulty positions at other universities. Dr. Alejandra Ortiz is now an assistant professor at North Carolina State University and Dr. Jon Czuba is now an assistant professor at Virginia Tech. On top of that, Dr. Rebecca Caldwell successfully defended her Ph.D. in July and will start her full-time position at Chevron in late 2017. In other news, Ph.D. student Scott David received a Dissertation Year Fellowship from Indiana University in recognition of his successes. Ph.D. student Elizabeth Olliver published her first paper in Estuarine and Coastal Shelf Science, and Ph.D. student Jeff Valenza was offered an internship at Chev- ron during summer 2017. M.S. student Graham Johnston accepted a full-time position with ExxonMobil starting in late 2018. M.S. student Matt Wanker just completed a month-long field season at the Judson Mead Geologic Field Sta- tion surveying gravel tracers in the Jefferson River. In addition to all these student successes Doug and his group have initiated a new and exciting project looking at floodplains in Indiana as part of research funding by the Petroleum Research Fund of the American Chemical Society and the Grand Challenges project funded by IU. This past May during flood season, Doug and his group measured water discharge and sediment transport in the floodplain channels of the East Fork of White River. The floodplain channels are interesting geomorphic features that regulate the connectivity of the river and floodplain, control sedimentation patterns, and ultimately influence the biodi- versity. These data will be used to calibrate models aimed at trying to under- stand the function of these channels.

But research by a team that includes an Indiana University geologist finds there is order to the complexity. The researchers, using field observations and mathematical modeling, concluded that deltas self-organize according to an “optimality principle,” creating networks of channels that increase the diversity of ways in which sediment is transported. “Channel networks are the blood vessels of a delta system, and their job is to deliver water, sediment and nutrients to the larger delta environment,” said study co-au- thor Douglas Edmonds. “We have uncovered an organizing principle that describes how these channel configure themselves to do that job.” The article, “Entropy and optimality in river deltas,” is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. Edmonds is an associate professor and the Malcolm and Sylvia Boyce Chair in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences. Other authors are at the University of California, Irvine; the Uni- versity of Nevada, Reno; the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne; and the University of Padua in Italy. hgr | 15 climate and Earth processes BRIAN YANITES Assistant Professor of Geological Sciences | Geomorphology In the spring semester, Brian teamed up with 6 graduate and 3 undergraduate students in his Advance Geomorphology course to analyze river response to Typhoon Morakot in southern Taiwan using Google Earth. The typhoon caused 22,000 landslides. The students quantified how this material has impacted riv- er systems in these landscapes. The work has implications for understanding the cascade of hazards that can exist for decades following such an event. The work is currently under review for publication. In May, Brian and Ph.D. student Brigid Lynch traveled to southwestern Peru to measure rates of river ero- sion and geomorphology. The goal of the collaborative project is to tease apart tectonic and climate drivers of canyon incision along the western flank of the Andes. The IU team will combine estimates of basin-wide erosion rates from cosmogenic nuclides with river morphology metrics to calibrate a model of river incision. This model will be used to constrain the dynamics of canyon incision and ultimately help quantify when these canyons began forming. While conducting field work, the research team observed the eruption of the Sabancaya. In July, Ph.D. student Nate Mitchell attended the Tobacco Root Mountain Geologcial Society’s annual “Field Confer- ence”. Following the meeting, Nate conducted field work throughout central Idaho, measuring river morphology and rock strength in the Salmon and Clearwater watersheds. The goal of the project is to unravel how rock-type influences the rate of landscape transience.

NSF grant to fund IU research on how tectonic, climate processes are reshaping landscape Quoting the IU Newsroom: Indiana University Bloomington geoscience researcher Brian Yanites has been awarded a three-year, $317,663 grant from the National Science Foundation to study how tectonic and climate processes interact to shape the land- scape of southern Taiwan. The research, which includes collaboration with Taiwanese scientists, will expand scientists’ understanding of forces involved in earthquakes, floods and landslides, potential- ly improving the capacity for preventing or responding to natural disasters. Yanites said Taiwan is an ideal place to study the inter- play of tectonic and climate forces and how they shape the land. It experiences frequent earthquakes, some of them devastating, and an average of four typhoons per year. Its mountains and valleys are prone to erosion and landslides. “Everything is sort of amped up in terms of tectonics and climate,” Yanites said. “There is just so much there, and everything happens so fast.” The researchers will analyze how the landscape is changing in response to earthquakes, tectonic uplift, rainfall and floods. The work will include measuring the size and shape of river channels, determining how much sediment the rivers can carry and what will cause them to flood. Researchers will also use a process called cosmogenic nuclide analysis, which involves measuring the buildup of rare isotopes in rocks to determine how the landscape has changed in recent and geologic time.

Natural resource utilization throughout the world includes geologic materials such as met- als, non-metals, fuels, and water. Here at IU we have faculty and research scientists who are in- volved in both field/analytical and experimental studies of all of these natural resources. We have an active group investigating the genesis of me- tallic ore deposits that occur in magmatic, hydro- thermal, and sedimentary environments. Sever- al faculty and research staff are also involved in studies that relate to the genesis and localization of petroleum, coal, and natural gas. Our mineralogy and petrology program involves the study of rocks from all terrestrial and some planetary environments. We have active projects in sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks funded by NSF and NASA and sited on all 7 conti- nents and on Mars. Sedimentary geology utilizes sedimentary rocks to investigate the processes that shaped the sur- face of the early Earth and understand the his- tory of how those processes have interacted to control the Earth system. In addition to tradition- al techniques like facies analysis and provenance analysis, cutting-edge application of techniques ranging from stable isotope geochemistry to detrital zircon geochronology are leading rapid developments in what can be learned from the sedimentary record.

The long-standing “Indi- ana Geological Survey” has made way for the “Indiana Geological and Water Survey,” reflecting the Survey’s expanded efforts in the study and dissemination of information about the quality and quantity of Indiana’s surface- and groundwater. “I think it’s no surprise to anyone who follows the news that water is a growing issue in the 21st century.” “I think it’s no surprise to anyone who follows the news that water is a growing issue in the 21st century,” said Survey Director Todd Thompson. “As a midwestern state, we assume that sufficient water exists for hu- man and livestock consumption, agriculture, and business uses. Howev- er, we have a limited inventory of the quantity, and even less knowledge of the quality, of this important resource. At the Indiana Geological and Water Survey, we hope to more accurately define water resources statewide.” The name change was codified in Indiana Senate Bill 416, which took effect on July 1, 2017. ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY A new study conservatively estimates that the Survey has an annual economic impact of $110.4 million on the state of Indiana. Conducted by Capstone Class 7933 in IU’s School of Public and Environmental Affairs as their class project, the study cites the Survey’s online tools such as IndianaMap and the Petroleum Data Man- agement System at nearly $25 million alone. The value of projects that would never be completed without the IGWS’s freely available or low-cost data is listed at more than $56 million annually. The study surveyed users of IGWS information and implemented the input-output model IMPLAN as part of their methodology. OUTREACH ACTIVITIES The Indiana Geological and Water Survey is reaching more Hoosiers than ever before with an increased effort on outreach programs for the general public. From the well-known Quake Cottage program to partnerships with Indiana State Parks, more than 10,000 Hoosiers participated in IGS outreach activities in 2016. New ad- ditions in 2017, including scouting workshops, library programs, quarry tours, and Master Naturalist courses, have reached another 9,750 people by the end of September 2017. Polly Sturgeon, the Survey’s Outreach Co- ordinator, has also promoted new lesson plans, StoryMaps, and social media campaigns to increase aware- ness of Indiana geology around the state.

Principles of paleontology form the foundation that bridges geologic, biologic, chemical, and anthropolog- ic sciences. Geobiology relies on analysis of fossils in their geo- logic, and thus historical and environmental contexts to test hypotheses about the history of life. Geoarchaeology and geoanthropology focus on the spatial, temporal, and environmental context of hu- mans in the most recent phases of Earth history. The IU Paleontology Collection, which contains more than 1.3 million fossil specimens, offers special oppor- tunities for specimen-based research, teaching, and outreach. 24 | hgr geobiology, geoarchaeology, paleontology Ed Herrmann, Claudia Johnson, Jackson Njau, David Polly ED HERRMANN Research Scientist | Geoarchaeology Ed’s geoarchaeological research is naturally interdisci- plinary. Although his work is focused on archaeological questions, he incorporates datasets from a number of geologic fields such as geomorphology, sedimentology, pedology, cartography, paleontology, geophysics, and river basin research. These fields are important compo- nents of understanding the chronology and preservation potential for archaeological sites at various time scales. Geoarchaeology is a rapidly growing subfield of geolog- ical and archaeological sciences. The multidisciplinary field addresses archaeological questions by incorpo- rating geological principles and methods into research design. Geoarchaeologists study sediments, soils, geo- physical techniques, stone tools and lithic sources, pa- leoenvironments, and archaeological site taphonomy. In the past year, Ed has worked to decipher the stratigra- phy and chronology of archaeological sites in Montana, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and in the cradle of humanity: Old- uvai Gorge, Tanzania. Geoarchaeological work at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania Along with Jackson Njau and EAS re- search affiliates Nick Toth and Kathy Schick of the Stone Age Institute, Ed is working on the Olduvai Project which studies millions of years of stratigra- phy using deep coring methods that provide data related to the paleoen- vironments within which some of our oldest ancestors lived. These data can also provide an understanding of lake levels and positions, volcanic activity, and local and regional geomorphology. Geoarchaeological methods are also being used at Old- uvai to understand the distribution and sources of stone raw material used by our earliest human ancestors, and where yet undiscovered sites may be hidden. Many EAS faculty members and students are actively participating in the Olduvai Project and field school.

Data on coral species, disease, depth, temperature and geographic location are folded into a database investigated first for associations, and then for causal relationships emerging from data-driven hypotheses. Rudist bivalves, the Cretaceous reef builders of the Caribbean, are back in the forefront of research with new methods of addressing classification and phylogeny. On the other side of the world and far up from the Cretaceous in the geologic column are investigations into Tanzania’s Pleistocene fossils that disclose their riverine affinities, and rocks that reveal their fluvial and volcanic histories from exposures and cores extracted from Olduvai Gorge. Closer to home and back down the geologic column are class field trips for students to learn field meth- ods of measuring stratigraphic sections, and collecting fossils for laboratory processing of fossil identifi- cations and paleoecologic analyses.

Adjunct Professor, Department of Anthropology, Indiana University FROM CORE TO OUTCROP: TANZANIA PROJECT The drilling program for scientific research that was carried out at Olduvai archaeological site in Tanza- nia by the Olduvai Gorge Coring Project (OGCP) has yielded about 600 m of continuous core obtained from ancient lakebeds. The core constitutes approximately 30 % of all cores from East African paleolake and hominin sites (including Kenya and Ethiopia). OGCP was developed in 2013 by Jackson Njau, Kathy Schick and Nick Toth (Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and The Stone Age Institute) with the goal of obtaining high-quality cores, which are vital for the investigation of past climates and environments in which early humans evolved. Along with parallel active and passive seismic studies conducted in the area in collaboration with the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology (KAUST) scientists, we have built a strong interdisciplinary research program bridging paleoanthropology and Earth sciences, making OGCP one of the top drilling projects in Eastern Africa hominin sites. To date, twenty-seven scientists from eight different countries and 14 labs (including IU) have been working on the project, focusing on different aspects of the overall research including: sedimentology, X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), argon-argon and paleomagnetic dating, tephrastratigraphy, soil carbonate isotope ratios, phytoliths, pollen, diatoms, ostracods, organic geochemistry, pale- ontology, archaeology, geophysics, and seismology. We are beginning to get exciting results from core analyses revealing an unprecedented record of past environments that might have influenced human evolution in the East African rift valley. Although the link between environmental changes and human evolution faces many challenges, this research is changing longstanding views of early homi- nin paleoenvironments at Olduvai, and offers new perspectives for reconstructing paleolandscapes and a holistic understanding of hominin land use behaviors, climate history and basin evolution. The core record, which shows the influxes of mudflows and vol- canic materials (from the ad- jacent Ngorongoro volcanoes) and the unparalleled large, deep and long-lived lake, sug- gests that both climate mod- ulated environmental change and tectonic activities altered the lake configuration and shaped paleogeography and hominin adaptations through time. This ground-breaking research is providing mod- ern methods that address our species’ humble beginnings, and help us answer questions about our origins. 28 | hgr FIELDWORK IN OLDUVAI GORGE After successful completion of the project’s phase I drilling (2014), phase II seismic experiments (2015- 2017), and phase III, core sampling at the NSF-funded National Lacus- trine Core facility at the University of Minnesota (2015-2017), OGCP is now in phase IV of its research program. Our goal here is to tie the core stratigraphy to outcrop in or- der to examine whether times of significant environmental change correspond to times of significant technological or biological change (observed in outcrop-derived fos- sils and artifacts) during Bed I (~2 Ma), Lower Bed II–Upper Bed II transition (~1.7 Ma), Bed III during the Pleistocene Revolution (~1 Ma), and Masek Beds (~0.4 Ma). We be- gan this exercise by correlating the volcanic ash layers and paleoenvi- ronmental proxies archived in cores to the archaeological-bearing units in the outcrop. To this end, a series of excavations was initiated at Old- uvai Gorge in the summers of 2016 and 2017 in order to expose fresh sections and recover more fossils and stone artifact data. The excava- tions targeted geological intervals and sites that document key evo- lutionary landmarks in the history of our ancestors such as the transi- tion from Homo habilis to H. erectus and subsequently to anatomically modern H. sapiens, the extinction of early Homo and Australopithe- cine hominins, and the first human migration out of Africa. hgr | 29 origin and evolution of life DAVID POLLY Professor, Geological Sciences Adjunct Professor, Departments of Biology and Anthropology | Director, Center for Biological Research Collections Research Curator, IU Paleontology Collection | Affiliate Member, Integrated Program in the Environment Research Associate, Department of Zoology, The Field Museum, Chicago | Shrock Professor of Sedimentary Geology There has been a productive turnover in David worked on dinosaur faunas from Antarctica for Polly’s group in 2017.

The IU Paleontology Collection Following a successful unveiling of the IU Paleontology Collections during our Open House on April 30, 2016, physical improvements to our collections space and movement toward 3-D digitization of fossils continued under the curatorial expertise of our former Col- lections Manager, Gary Motz. Numerous undergraduate and graduate students from several disciplines gained ac- ademic and managerial experience under Gary’s tutelage. Recently, Gary accepted a position as Chief Information Officer and Assistant Director for Information Services in the Indiana Geological and Water Survey, and fortunately we will continue to collaborate with Gary in his new position. We thank Gary heartily for bringing our collections into the forefront of the 21st century through his continued focus and dedication toward the goal of research access to fossil specimens. President McRobbie visited our newly renovated IU Paleontology Collections space in April of 2017, and was hosted to a viewing and discussion of our research-focused repository of fossil specimens from Indiana and around the world. Our IU Paleontology Collections were founded in 1903 by IU geologist E.R. Cumings, and now contain more than 1.3 million fossils that document life on Earth for more than 500 million years. Soon after visiting our Collec- tions, President McRobbie initiated a Collections Summit during which he shared his remarks about IU’s material object collections across all campuses, hosted an open discussion regarding policy issues inclusive of mission, digitization, exhibition, accession, deaccession and staffing, and welcomed invited par- ticipants’ responses to develop a collective vision for IU’s material object collections as part of IU’s Bicentennial activities and cele- brations. We can gently boast that our IU Paleontology Collections are ahead of the curve relative to other IU collections holdings, and we look forward to in-depth participation in this collaborative Bi- centennial effort. We in Geobiology mourn the loss of our close colleagues, Professor Emeritus Donald Hattin and Professor Emeritus Erle G.

Stories of field collections and early international trav- els were conveyed to us with great exuberance, and certainly were embellished - at least a tad - each time they were told to enhance color and effect. Our IU Paleontology Collections were enhanced recently by the addition of shallow-water coral and mollusc specimens from the Stoter Collection, formerly in off-site storage but now a central, visible part of the beauty of our fossils.

Energy production and consumption are critical issues in Vietnam. The country’s economy is growing rapidly, creating increased demand for energy. Policymakers face decisions about whether to expand the country’s fossil-fuel and hydroelectric resources or to import more energy. Vietnam ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change, creating an incentive to reduce emissions and move away from relying on coal. The country’s tense relations with China and other neighbors and its partial transition from a state-controlled to a market economy create further complications. The IU class, which included seven graduate students and six under- graduates — about half of whom were EAS students — examined the issues from economic, geopolitical, and public health and environ- mental perspectives and produced a 25-page report of analysis and policy recommendations. Students in the EAS “Environmental and Energy Diplomacy” course brief Ted Osius, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, on energy policy. hgr | 39 solid Earth dynamics KAJ JOHNSON Associate Professor of Geological Sciences Kaj is a geophysicist who works primarily with geodetic data and numerical and an- alytical modeling to investigate active de- GARY PAVLIS Professor of Geological Sciences | Geophysics, Seismology, and Tectonics formation of the lithosphere.

COURSES AND FACULTY The past year has seen a number of small but important changes in the curriculum offered at the Judson Mead Geologic Field Station. In efforts to keep the G429 program at the leading edge of field programs, a number of additions and revisions to the different exercises that comprise the curriculum have taken place. The concentration options have been expanded to include crystalline rocks and economic geology, geophysics and neotectonics, hydrology and environmental geology, and sedimentology and sequence stratigraphy. Each concentra- tion has been augmented with new data sets and equipment, including chemical and isotopic analyses, use of petrographic taught by Jess King and a former G429 student who returns to the IUGFS to co-teach this course. In 2017 we had Andy Barth from IUPUI, following his alternate-year scheduling pattern of teaching a small group of students from the IUPUI program. The Field Station also hosted an advanced graduate seminar for the second time. Students were brought in from across the country to take part in the The Paleontologial Society Field Course on Stratigraphic Paleobiology led by Dr. Mark Patzkowsky (Penn State University) and Dr. Steve Holland (Univer- sity of Georgia). They returned to continue their studies of the Mississippian carbonate sequences found in Miligan Canyon, the same location that the G429s concentration has been working. The two efforts have been complementary and are producing exciting results. observations, and paleontologic data. The subsurface correla- tion exercise was extensively revised based on the feedback we received after its introduction in 2016; in 2017 the exercise went smoothly, and successfully allowed the students to rec- ognize patterns in the subsurface that matched those they had observed in their field observations with respect to the history of Belt Island. A new graduate field seminar was offered in summer 2017, G700 3-D Structural Analysis. The seminar is open to students from across the country and combines field work with the development of a digital 3-D model of the J-Fold, a long-standing field area for G429. A stable and highly functional faculty has emerged that includes Drs. Bruce Douglas (IU), Erika Elswick (IU), Jim Handschy (IU), Candace Karies-Beaty (Winona State), Page Quinton (SUNY Potsdam), and Mike Rygel (SUNY Potsdam). We have also had the good fortune to have Dr. Jess King (Hong Kong University) join the crystaline concentration to provide her expertise to the teaching efforts. OTHER ACADEMIC USERS Other academic users of the Field Station include Hong Kong University who returned for a third year and agreed to con- tinue the arrangement for the indefinite future. The course is 42 | hgr Watch a video “Extraordinary Moments: From Bloomington to Big Sky Country,” filmed at the IU Geologic Field Station this summer by Ven- ture Production Group for the College of Arts + Sciences Magazine. https://magazine.college.indiana.edu/issues/ fall-2017/articles/stone-fixed-moment.html RESEARCH In addition to serving as a base for teaching, the Field Station continues to act as a base and logistical hub for research. One M.S. thesis has been completed, and three other projects are ongoing all within the past three years. Field work was undertaken by Kirstyn Cataldo (M.S., adv. B. Douglas) and Matt Wanker (M.S., adv. D. Edmonds) during the summer of 2017. IU faculty member Dr. Brian Yanites also made a visit to the Field Station to conduct a preliminary assessment of the South Boulder River as a potential site for future research. SCHOLARSHIPS It is exciting to be able to report that we have contin- ued to add to our scholarship base with the addition of three new scholarships over the past three years. These generous donations from alumni are making it possible for the Field Station to award scholarships to 70 % of the students enrolled in G429 with the average amount of funding awarding during this time being $52,000. FACILITIES Efforts have been underway for several years to sys- tematically upgrade the student dormitories. The goal is to have all of the dorms on the upper cam- pus renovated over the next 5 years. A less obvious change but of high importance was the replacement of a number of kitchen appliances, the most im- portant of which may have been the replacement of the coffee maker which was the same one that existed when Bruce Douglas started teaching over 30 years ago. Progress has also been made on the design and plans for a new student bathhouse to be constructed on the upper campus. The project is in the final stages of design and cost analysis. We are cautiously optimistic that construction will begin in the not too distant future.

We had a total of 10 students hailing from IU-Bloomington, IUPUI, University of Nevada, Addis Abbaba University (Kenya) and the University of Witwatersrand (South Africa). As with last year, the faculty were Jackson Njau and Jim Brophy, both of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. For those EAS (formerly Geological Sciences) alums who have taken the course, you will be interested to know that we had to relocate our camping and dining site to the west of the Old Leakey Compound. The Tanzanian government has decided to turn the original compound into a Leaky museum site and they did not want scruffy faculty and students running around. As part of this project, the small museum along the rim of Olduvai Gorge has been replaced with a modern 3-building museum that was dedicated in summer 2017. The website address for the Tanzanian field course is http://www.indiana.edu/~olduvai/ support the Olduvai Gorge Summer Field Study Program For the past 4 years, Indiana University has offered a unique five-week Geology and Paleoanthropology Field School taught in the Olduvai Gorge region (http://www.indiana.edu/~olduvai). The course has been a truly valuable and sometimes life-changing experience for students. The Stone Age Institute (http://stoneageinstitute.org) has provided generous support from the beginning. For many students, however, participation is still beyond their reach. An additional goal of the Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Alumni College is to raise funds for the Olduvai Field School Scholarship Fund. If you are interested in helping, a donation can be arranged at the time of registration or any time thereafter. There are three donation levels: Silver benefactors ($100-$1,000) Gold benefactors ($1,000-$2,000) Platinum benefactors ($2,000 and above) For information on adonating to the EAS Alumni College scholarship fund, please visit https://www.indiana.edu/~olduvai/alumni/index.html 44 | hgr EAS Alumni College at Olduvai-Serengeti In last year’s HGR it was announced that an Olduvai-Serengeti Alumni College was “in the works.” We are very pleased to announce that we plan to offer it for the first time this coming summer (2018). This Alumni College offers an exciting ten-day educational experience in and around Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. Olduvai is located in the Ngorongoro-Serengeti ecosystem where people and their early ancestors have coexisted with wildlife for nearly four mil- are very pleased to lion years. We announce that we plan to offer it for the first time this coming summer (2018) It is a world heritage arche- ological site made famous by Dr. Louis Leakey and his wife Mary for their ground- breaking discovers of early human fossils documenting the evolutionary history of our species, culture and technology. The College will be led by IU professors Jackson Njau and Jim Brophy, along with one or more experienced Tanzanian safari tour guides. Together, Njau and Brophy represent over a decade of teaching and research in the Olduvai region while the safari guides bring their vast knowledge of the flora and fauna of the Serengeti. The College will begin in the city of Arusha, which is close to Mt. Kilamanjaro. As you leave Arusha you will see and learn about the East Africa Rift Zone, arguably the single most famous geologic feature in the world. You will spend several days in the Olduvai region working side by side with students currently enrolled in a 5-week Geology and Paleoanthropology field school based out of the original Leakey research camp at Olduvai. You will participate in lectures. You will hike into the gorge. You will get your hands dirty in the field. You may even make your own stone tool and skin a goat (if you are up to it!). You will experience first hand the local Masaai culture as you interact with them at both the Leakey camp and at their own primitive bomas. After leaving the Olduvai region you will travel for three days in the nearby Serengeti plain where you will experience African wildlife at its best. From there, you will return to Arusha and home. All vehicle travel is in comfortable, robust safari vehicles. All acco- modations are in first class hotels or safari lodges. In short, you will be comfortable from beginning to end. apply for the EAS Alumni College Program at Olduvai - Serengeti For information on applying for the EAS Alumni Field School in Olduvai, please visit https://www.indiana.edu/~olduvai/alumni/index.html hgr | 45 News About US The following sections contain news and information about our graduate students and faculty members, construction and upgrade projects in the department, news from Emeriti and Alumni, and a list of our esteemed benefactors.
