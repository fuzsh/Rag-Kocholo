RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION: Presbyterian, First Presbyterian Church, Baltimore City; however, in ca.1785 he rented a pew in St. Paul's Parish Church(Anglican), Baltimore County. OCCUPATIONAL PROFILE: merchant; in partnership with his father James Sterett in a mercantile firm in Baltimore Town from early 1771; in partnership with his brothers David and Samuel Sterett (1758-1833) in the firm of John Sterett & Company, which dealt in merchandise such as cloth and salt and had an interest in various ships and their cargoes, from at least 1782 until his death; in partnership with Jeremiah Yellot, with whom he entered into an agreement in July 1781 to buy and sell tobacco; involved with Yellot and others in several ships and their cargoes trading from America to \"parts beyond the sea\"; had a store, probably in Baltimore Town, in 1782. Sterett purchased one-eighth interest in the Nottingham Forges and Ironworks in Baltimore County in 1782 from the commissioners of confiscated British property. The iron- works then became known as the Ridgely Forges and Furnace, operated by Charles Ridgely and Company. This partnership consisted of Sterett, Charles Ridgely (1733-1790), Benjamin Nicholson (?-1792), Darby Lux (?-1795), Samuel Chase (1741-1811), Henry Howard, William Goodwin, and John Dorsey. After Sterett's death, Jeremiah Yellot brought suit against his heirs for money he claimed was due him as a result of their various partnerships. In the resulting Chancery case in 1794, Sterett's father testified that John was heav- ily indebted to him on private accounts and that he had been sued as surviving partner in their firm and had paid or secured to be paid large sums of money to settle their accounts. Sterett's partnership with his brothers apparently fared no better. His brother David died in 1791 with no estate, and his brother Samuel Sterett (1758-1833) was forced to file as an insolvent debtor because of the many debts and claims outstanding against the firm. John's widow stated that she believed it would take most, if not all, of Sterett's real and personal estate to satisfy his creditors. The court ordered that Sterett's estate, both real and personal, be sold to satisfy the debts owed to Yellot and many others as a result of his mercantile ventures. The property sold included his one-eighth interest in the Nottingham Irownworks, plus lands, slaves, and other goods, which brought a total of £2,800.0.0 current money to the estate. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: owned a privateer during the Revolution. PUBLIC CAREER. LEGISLATIVE SERVICE Lower House, Baltimore Town, 1783 (Claims), 1784, 1785 (Claims).
