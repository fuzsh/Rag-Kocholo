The vessel had been drifting on the high seas since December, when its crew had been rescued by an American destroyer, the USS Sterett. The Esperanza had been boarded by pirates and the crew had disabled its engines. The captain of the Sterett claimed to have made \"heroic efforts\" to get the Esperanza going again. But it was left to the Seychelles to locate the ghost ship and tow it to port."
