        "text": "On this day in #USSEnterprise history, September 5, 1813, the #USNavy Brig Enterprize under the command of William Burrows engaged the HMS Boxer in the most famous battle of her career. The War of 1812 had been on almost a year and the Enterprize had yet to see any real action. On the morning of September 5th, Enterprize was crusing just off Monhegan Island, Maine when the Boxer was sighted leaving the Maine coast. A little after 3pm the two ships engaged in a fierce battle exchanging broadsides with each other. The captains of both vessels fell early and it was left to the first officers of both ships to continue the battle. After about 30 minutes Enterprize gained the upper hand and Boxer surrendered. Of the two equally matched vessels, the Enterprize was hardly damaged while Boxer suffered considerable damage, allowing the American's to brag about victory, giving the nation a morale boost after the recent loss of the frigate Chesapeake a few months before. A few days later the captains of both ships were laid to rest in joint funeral in Portland.

The War of 1812 had just been declared and the HMS Brazen had taken station at the mouth of the river. The American Navy Brig Siren was due in any day and completely unaware of the war declaration, and Brazen could attack the Siren, unaware they were at war. Enterprize, under the command of Lt. Johnston Blakeley was determined not to let that happen. If successful, this might have been the first naval engagement of the war. However on this day, nature conspired against the Enterprize. A strong category 3 hurricane moved ashore right over New Orleans. In the early morning hours of August 19th, Enterprize was heaved over on the muddy bank. It would take weeks to refloat her, and months for repairs. However, she was not yet through with the War of 1812, her greatest battle yet awaited her, a little over year later.

This time Commodore Edward Preble aboard Constitution decide to attack a bay west of Tripoli in an attempt to lure the Tripolitan gunboats out of the main harbor where Enterprize, under the command of her first officer James Lawarence and the other schooners and brigs could swing around cut them off. The plan was unsuccessful with the loss of one American gunboat along with 10 men. Preble did not have enough firepower for an all out assult on Tripoli, so he was contining his strategy was annoy the Tripolitan's to bring them to the negotiation table in effort to end the war.

The #USNavy schooner Enterprize along with the schooners Nautilus, Scourge, Vixen, the brigs Argus and Syren, the frigate Constitution, six gunboats and two bombard vessels mounted an attack on Tripoli Harbor during the First Barbary War. Enterprize was under the command of her first officer, James Lawarence, while Captain Stephen Decatur, Jr. led the gunboat assault. It would turn out to be one of the bloodiest battle of the war with three Tripolitan gunboats captured, three sunk, forty-four Tripolitans killed and another thirty-five captured. On the American side thirteen were wounded and only one casualty, Steven Decatur's younger brother James. The battle was a negligable tactictal victory.

Early in the morning of August 1st, Enterprize, under the command of Lieutenant Andrew Sterett was sailing north from Tripoli for the island of Malta when the watch caught site a Tripolian corsair. Enterpize was sent only as a support ship for the three big frigates in the squadron and was off to Malta to get a supply of fresh water. The First Barbary War was only recently declared and no confrontation had yet taken place as Enterprize approached the Tripolitan ship. In this first battle of the war, Enterprize engaged in a fierce 3 hour battle with the corsair Tripoli. After the smoke cleared, the Tripoli was little more than a wreck, barely able to stay afloat. Of Tripoli's crew of eighty, thirty were dead and another thirty wounded. Enterprize suffered little to no damage and not a single member of her crew was even wounded. Even President Thomas Jefferson called out the victory in his State of the Union speech and Andrew Sterett was awarded a commorative sword by Congress. In the first Barbary War, the Navy proved itself as a power abroad and Enterprize proved beyond a doubt the schooner as a ship of war.

John Shaw was sailing west of Dominica in the West Indies. It was the height of the Quasi-War with France as the French brig Flambeu closed on Enterprize thinking this an American merchantman that could be easily be captured. Soon the the brig realized their mistake and turned away. The chase was on. Enterprize closed quickly on this adversary and engaged them in a 20 minute battle, after which the Flambeu tried again in vein to escape, but after another volley from Enterprize's guns the privateer surrendered. This lopsided battle would bring fame to Enterprize having taken on a superior vessel and won a decisive victory. Not only did Flambeu have a larger crew and more powerful guns, the stunning fact she lost 37 of her crew in the battle whereas only one person on Enterprize was wounded proved the expert seamanship of Captain Shaw.

In the early morning hours on this moonless night with storms squalls rolling past, a lookout posted on the deck yelled out \"Land!\" Immediately the crew sprung into action to turn the ship, but the onshore winds pushed Enterprize on to the breakers off the island of Little Curacao, a treeless spec in the middle of a vast ocean. Despite the best efforts of the crew to save her, Enterprize was lost, without a single injury to her crew. Her loss ended almost a quarter century of service to the Navy, but her name would live in a new line of ships that would continue serve the Navy to this day.

Enterprize was anchored in the Grand Harbor of Valletta in Malta, a British port in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, only 20 years after a peace treating ending the American Revolution.

Sterett did not yet know the Tripolitans had declared war on the United States, and he was the first of his squadron to arrive to answer the threat of possible war. Only three days before Sterett made history anchoring Enterprize at Gibraltar, only the second ship in U.S. Navy ever to call on this port, a bastion of British power. For the next four years, the Navy would fight what would become known as the First Barbary War and Enterprize would not only be the first ship to arrive on station, she would be one of the last to leave, participating in almost every engagement of the entire war. For this day though, Sterett would watch over the Tripolitans until the rest of the fleet arrived a few days later.

He took command of Enterprize during the battle when his captain, Stephen Decatur led a gunboat raid on the inner harbor. During the War of 1812, Lawrence was promoted to captain and given command of the Chesapeake, one of the six original firgates of the US Navy. After sailing from Boston, Chesapeake engaged the Shannon and Lawrence was mortal wounded. One of his final commands was \"Don't give up the ship\" which became a famous rallying cry during the war. Unfortunately Chesapeake was captured and Lawrence died of his wounds a few days later. Three months after his death, Americans evened the score with the Enterprize capturing the HMS Boxer off the coast of Maine.
