The executors were his wife, Marhta, son James, and his brother-in-law, Andrew Work. -- Lancaster County Probates.\n\nHis wife, Martha Work, made her will November 11, 1751, which was registered May 20, 1754. The executors were Andrew Work and Joseph Sterrett. Her will calls daughter Mary, \"Mary Smith,\" and names beside her, only her daughters Ann Sterrett and Rebecca Sterrett; John Sterrett, a son, and James Sterrett, a grandson. John is probably a misreading for Joseph, or else was a grandson, as the only two sons mentioned in any of the deeds between these children were James and Joseph, both named in their father's will, which calls Mary, \"Mary Sterrett.\"\n\ni.
