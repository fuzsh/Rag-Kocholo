        "text": "What better way to end my 21.5 year career in the Navy, than with 1200 other service women from all 8 services at the Sea Service Leadership Association’s annual Joint Women’s Leadership Symposium. I’m so honored to have been invited to speak in the capstone panel of JWLS 2023 with Jessica Morera on a topic I’m very passionate about - Redefining success- Making your career your own. Success is what you make it. Find your passion. Find your fit. The Golden Path doesn’t fit everyone. Nor should it. I found my passion in advocating for others. Fighting for what’s right. Determining areas that lacked structure, follow through, accountability and finding a way to fix it. While my time serving active duty is done, I will always be on the horizon, continuing to look after our Sailors and fellow service men and women. And I will continue to help others find their own success as well. It’s been an amazing run. I’m so proud of my time as a United States Naval Aviator and Officer. And I can’t wait for the next chapter to begin."
