        "text": "About Sterett-Gittings Kelsey\n\nSterett-Gittings Kelsey was born in 1941 and was graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design with a B.F.A. in sculpture in 1964. It has taken several generations to produce a \"New Master of Movement.\" Now Kelsey is widely regarded as the leading sculptor of dance in the world today. You can read the in-depth comparative treatise on the Kelsey Bronzes by the leading Fine Art Appraiser, Fine Art Historian, Curator and Artnet Founder: Peter Hastings Falk on this website. Working primarily in bronze, the sculptures range in height from a few inches to thirty feet in height. The Kelsey Bronzes are owned by collectors and connoisseurs of investment-level fine art around the world. These masterworks in bronze are in more than 300 public and private collections. To date, April 2020, there are 300 finished original sculptures in bronze and porcelain ..... and counting! The Kelsey Sculptures are hand-made from start to finish. The trans-formation from the clay original, into a masterpiece in bronze is a long and expensive process. A new ceramic mold is hand-made for each sculpture. It is used only once. This mold is then destroyed within the casting process. There are about many steps which each work passes through on the way to becoming a completed work of fine art. Each sculpture bears: The copy right symbol: the artist's logo: the artist's name: the date of origin: the edition number and the foundry mark."
