        "text": "9 Abel has not ignored alternative theoretical perspectives on professionalism. In the introductory chapters of his books on lawyers in England and Wales (England) and on American lawyers (AmLaw), Abel delineates frameworks based on Marxist theory (i.e., the legal profession's place in the class structure) and based on Durkheimian structural-functionalism i.e., the legal profession as a self-regulating community that serves the larger social community). Even though he considers these frameworks at various places in his work, his dominant concern is with Weberian market control theory; this can be seen in his final overview essay, which he describes as having two objectives: “to illustrate the insights that can be derived from comparative analysis of legal professions and to test the power of a theoretical framework that emphasizes market control” (CompSoc 2 at 135, emphasis added).Google Scholar\n\n18 Perhaps the most visible interest is among state theorists, best captured in Peter Evans, Dietrich Rueschemeyer, & Theda Skocpol, eds., Bringing the State Back In (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1985). One of the essays in the third volume edited by Abel and Lewis is Dietrich Rueschemeyer,” Comparing Legal Professions: A State-centered Approach,”Comp Theory at 289. As is true of a number of the essays in the three volumes, aversion of this essay appeared previously as a journal article,” Comparing Legal Professions Cross-nationally: From a Professions-centered to a State-centered Approach,” 1986 A.B.F. Res. J. 415. Rueschemeyer proposes a state-oriented institutionalist approach to the legal profession; while that approach has merit, one need not orient an institutional analysis around the state.CrossRefGoogle Scholar\n\n21 Another way to differentiate between metainstitutions and basic institutions is to assess the degree to which the institution is linked to specific goals, with metainstitutions more geared to creating a “context”; for example, the market creates a context whereby firms can develop and flourish and in which consumers can express their preferences and satisfy their wants. In contrast, basic institutions are more instrumental in nature (e.g., IBM uses the market as a setting in which it seeks to maximize its profit and to assure its continued prosperity and existence). Metainstitutions serve something of a coordinating function, with rules and structures that tend to be more abstract than those of basic instititutions. The metainstitution is concerned with “how to do things”; the basic institution is concerned with “what to do.” This distinction is not without problems. What constitutes a “goal” may be in the eye of the beholder. Does the market have a goal? No: it simply creates the context for the firm, or Yes: it seeks to assure that goods and services are produced and distributed in a coherent fashion. Does science have a goal? No: it is simply a definition of a style of inquiry, or Yes: it seeks to advance knowledge systematically. Furthermore, an institution can function at multiple levels. For example, IBM sells computers, but it also creates standards that other computer makers have to confront and deal with.Google Scholar\n\n23 Underlying many of those issues, as well as other perspectives on institutional analysis, are what I would term the four key concepts of institutional analysis: Goals: Institutions have a mix of goals that combine internal imperatives (organizational maintenance, organizational growth, the needs of the institution's staffpersons) and external needs (e.g., serving a clientele, maintaining viable relationships with other institutional actors in the arena in which they function). Roks: In looking at the actors who work within an institution, a key distinction is made between the individual and what that individual is supposed to do (including what is to be done, how it is done, when it is done, and why it is done). Rules: Rules provide the framework for relationships among roles, definitions of how roles are to be carried out, and methods for dealing with failures of roles being carried out appropriately. Rewards: There must be incentives for individuals within roles to carry out their duties responsibilities; the rewards that comprise these incentives can be either positive or negation.Google Scholar\n\n24 My favorite examples of this imperative involve the evolution of theater companies, which frequently start out as the vision of one person (or a small group of people) but, if successful, must at some point “institutionalize” the operation. While moving to some protoinstitutional form is often fairly easy (e.g., establishing some formal group structure), the need to institutionalize in the more complete sense often has devastating effects on the creative enterprise, and small struggling companies that have mounted remarkable productions on minimal budgets in marginal performance spaces often become artistic travesties when they achieve success, move into beautiful theaters, and try to mount large-budget shows. For a description of a theater company that has successfully made the first transition and is now in the midst of the second, see Susan Andrews,” The Board Is Taking Center Stage,”N.Y. Times. Dec. 2, 1990 (Magazine: The Business World), at 40.Google Scholar\n\n32 The other major aspect of controlling production by producers concerns how members of the profession deliver their services. This, in turn, has to do with self-regulation, one important aspect of which is the control of internal competition, typically by defining undesired competition as a violation of professional ethics. Abel raises this issue in his discussion of the use of ethical norms to control things like advertising (AmLaw at 120–21; England at 190–91), but it is not a central focus of his discussion of self-regulation (AmLaw at 142–57; England at 133–36, 248–58). In Berlant, Profession and Monopoly 64–127 (cited in note 7), the author considers at some length the connection between “medical ethics and monopolization.”.Google Scholar\n\n39 In England, the rationalization of internal forms can also be seen in the recognition of the importance of alternative practice settings and the role of paraprofessionals working in legal practice settings. The transformation of “managing clerks” in firms of solicitors into “legal executives” is one example (England at 207–10) of the latter phenomenon; the increasing incomes and importance of the barrister's clerks as the size of “sets” (i.e., groups of barristers working in one “chamber,” or set of rooms) has grown is another (England at 103–10). See also Flood, John A., “Middlemen of the Law: An Ethnographic Inquiry into the English Legal Profession,” 1981 A.B.F. Res. J. 377; or Id., Barristers' Clerk: The Law's Middlemen (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1983). Legally qualified persons work in a variety of settings other than traditional firms. These range from the “law centres,” which employ solicitors to provide services to low-income communities, to solicitors and barristers employed by industry and government. The various groups may perform different kinds of tasks, and they frequently have divergent interests and concerns.Google Scholar\n\n46 I should also note that the preservation of the distinction between barristers and solicitors reflects in part the continuation of the social hierarchy that has traditionally marked English culture, with barristers comprising the “senior” branch drawn from the classically educated aristocracy and solicitors the “junior” branch with a more vocational emphasis. One aspect of institutionalization is the breakdown of differentiation based on social stratification in favor of a more functional basis of differentiation. Vittorio Olgiati and Valerio Pocar emphasize this change in their essay,” The Italian Legal Profession: An Institutional Dilemma” (CivLawWld at 336).Google Scholar\n\n47 Boigeol,” The French Bar” (CiwLawWld at 258, 262–65); see also Thanh Trai Le, Tang Thi, “The French Legal Profession: A Prisoner of Its Glorious Past?” 15 Cornell Int'l L. J. 63 (1982). As Le points out (at 85), avoués have not completely disappeared; they continue to practice at the appellate level. Their continued existence may reflect in part the fact that avoués like notaires, are ministerial officers who essentially own the position (and have the effective right of selling the office upon retirement), while avocats qualify for their positions by meeting requirements of education, prior occupation, and character.Google Scholar"
