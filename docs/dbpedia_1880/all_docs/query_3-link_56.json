        "text": "Today, Friday Nov 16, is my bride, Ruth‚Äôs birthday and just got home from watching 9:40AM showing of Spielberg‚Äôs ‚ÄúLINCOLN.‚Äù It was wonderful! I wrote two posts on FB earlier this week and we were blessed with over 100 comments. Some of you may know that in my family five consecutive generations of Washington DC policemen have served our nation protecting 26 U.S. Presidents.\n\nDad retired as Deputy Chief of U.S. Capitol Police and protected SEVEN Presidents. My Uncle Charlie was LT in charge of entire K-9 of USCP. My grandfather was a Captain with Metropolitan DC Police. My great grandfather rode horseback with US Park Police but my great-great-great grandfather was on duty at Ford‚Äôs Theater and carried President Abraham Lincoln across the street the night he died in 1865. Politically, President Lincoln is my favorite of all-time. Today, he‚Äôs still the most quoted American in history. He put ‚ÄúIN GOD WE TRUST‚Äù on our currency. He made Thanksgiving a national holiday, initiated National Day of Prayer and granted freedom to the shackled slaves. Another presidential note ‚Äì to this day he used more Biblical references in his addresses than any president from George Washington to Obama, respectively.\n\nIronically, I & was born President‚Äôs Day Weekend (Feb 20) and Ruth and I got engaged on steps of Lincoln Memorial (near exact spot Dr King gave I HAVE A DREAM speech). Lightening struck twice because our baby, Andrew LINCOLN was born inauguration day when President Obama was sworn in office (Jan 20, 2009). We were going to name him Andrew Graham. Every time Andrew is mentioned in Scripture he was always bringing someone to JESUS. We planned to name his middle name after Billy Graham but being born on inauguration day and the historical tie to Lincoln when went the alternate route.\n\nMany remember Lincoln‚Äôs leadership I recall his loneliness. Scholars celebrate his professional position to the top but I‚Äôm reminded daily of his personal pain, dark depression and overwhelming obstacles along the way. If Walt Disney is the model for ‚Äòvision‚Äô than Lincoln is the benchmark for perseverance. He was loving, loyal and never forgot where he came from. In our book ‚ÄúBLESSEDNESS OF BROKENNESS‚Äù I‚Äôm convinced that his initial setbacks propelled him to later success. The greatest leaders reach greatness not because they were perfect but endured testing both personally and professionally. Over the years, I often wondered what it was like to carry our Commander in Chief that night in the midst of chaos and confusion in our Capital City? It was recorded that Lincoln invited 14 people to attend the theater that night of the assassination with he and his wife. Sadly, just like his first couple proposals to a potential wife and the dozen plus that turned him down for the theater he faced rejection repeatedly. Many forget that his first fiance died. To think the President was told by others they were ‚Äòtoo busy‚Äô for him is mind boggling. Then again Jesus came to His own & they received Him not.\n\nThe Bible admonishes us to pray for those in authority. After working nearly 20 years in Washington, for two U.S. Presidents, speechwriter to House Majority Leader of Congress, floor staff of US Senate, aide to Governor of Maryland and a few assignments in between it is a fact leadership is lovely but lonely. When my ancestor died in 1877 it was noted in two DC newspapers that he became close friends with President Lincoln while working at The White House. One actually says that he was one of Lincoln‚Äôs favorites. Ironically, President Lincoln died on Good Friday, 1865. As he signed the Emancipation Proclamation granting freedom to slaves, Jesus died on Good Friday redeeming us by His blood liberating all by faith who trust in Him to set us free whom were once enslaved by sin. While working in the U.S. Capitol and appointed floor staff of the Senate, I have actually touched the exact table that President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation abolishing slavery. Doing the right thing is rarely easy. Looking back, those we celebrate in death unfortunately we often tolerate in life. Great individuals recognize greatness in others without being threatened or intimidated. #ThatWillPreach\n\nNow it is evident to others, but since my childhood I desired to enter politics, protect the President or Preach the Gospel. A young Bill Clinton met JFK at age 18 in that picture of them meeting helped catapult him to the presidency. If our Baby Andrew elects to enter politics he could note near the 200 year Anniv of my ancestor carrying Lincoln to remind America that although he cannot carry the individual again but certainly his ideals. Not the man but message carrying it to the masses. Perhaps, if the Lord tarries Baby Andrew ‚Äúmay be one to watch.‚Äù üôÇ I also learned that being in law enforcement is as much a calling as entering the ministry.\n\nWhile speaking across America, I‚Äôm mindful that when my ancestor carried President Lincoln he carried the closest to the King of a Nation we will ever have because the presidency is an institution not an individual. When my dad‚Äôs friend was a pallbearer for Elvis Presley in 1977, he carried the king of rock & roll but as Christians we don‚Äôt simply carry ‚ÄòThe King of a nation‚Äô, or ‚ÄúThe King of Rock & Roll‚Äù but we carry ‚ÄúThe King of all kings‚Äù by our life and lips. The beauty is it really is Christ carrying us. My ancestor could attest its one thing to carry greatness but it‚Äôs entirely and ETERNALLY different when Greatness (God) carries you! I thank God for Lincoln and despite him touching the world it‚Äôs humbling to think my ancestor touched him. Even greater, by grace we can touch Almighty God. What‚Äôs wild, He calls us friend too. I love that song ‚ÄòI am a friend of God ‚Äì HE CALLS ME FRIEND.‚Äù\n\nLESSONS on LINCOLN: The best leaders are usually those whom suffered great loss. Regardless, if Christ on the cross or Lincoln‚Äôs losses the best were blessed with burdens that most shoulders were too small to carry. Never make fun of those who have been through some storms 1) It doesn‚Äôt honor Christ 2) You could be next 3) They probably brought more to the table in talent and their assignment and anointing was more visible 4) Therefore, became a larger target of both enemy and friendly fire 5) It could have been God‚Äôs Divine Plan to bend them in the process of making them. Even the Bible notes ‚Äúit pleased God to bruise His Son‚Äù 6) Sometimes storms, setback and sin come on folks not for doing wrong but they could have been living right. 7) God delights in deadbeats and relishes in resurrection 8) Charles Spurgeon noted ‚ÄúThere is a special battalion in the Almighty‚Äôs Army were only wounded soldiers can serve.‚Äù The folks I admire the most have endured much and whom you discard God often elevates to touch the world. Who you see as trash God elevates as treasure.\n\nThe next time you encounter loss you may have been privately promoted in God‚Äôs service and didn‚Äôt even know it. Had Christ never endured Hell He couldn‚Äôt give away Heaven. Had Lincoln not faced rejection, pain and bondage early on he wouldn‚Äôt have been compassionate to do right at the end by granting freedom to slaves. I‚Äôm certain those facing the darkest depression in private make the lasting impressions in public. Had Michael Jordan not been cut on the varsity basketball from his high school coach he wouldn‚Äôt have dominated in the pros with six championships, billion dollar sales with Nike and gold medals from Olympics. Adversity causes most to break ‚Äì the rest BREAK records. Which one are you? Stress is not your enemy but a friend you haven‚Äôt appreciated yet.\n\nToday, thank God for your setbacks because they‚Äôre setups for success. Appreciate your adversities and find a blessedness in brokenness. The boy who gave his lunch to the Lord graduated from mediocrity to ministry. His lunch in his hands fed a few but given to God and BROKEN in His hands fed five thousand plus. Those that have been stretched and scarred often have the privilege to touch the world. Crumbs in your hand is a mess. Crumbs in God‚Äôs Hands become your MESSage. Plus, the Lord Loves Leftovers!\n\nThank God for the blessings but praise Him for the burdens because the beauty is a valley is actually just an upside down mountain. Thankfully, Jesus walks with us in both problems and promotion. Truly, His loss on Calvary was our gain Easter Sunday. Our disappointments today could be Divine Appointments tomorrow. Thank God for losses because we learn more about our Lord through the ugly than going undefeated. If you ever feel like a reject than you are in Good Company. Because the best are blessed because they were by passed before but found grace in God before the end. Count it ALL joy!\n\nIn closing, God wanted a family and He sowed a Son. President Abraham Lincoln paid his life in full so as Americans we could become family. At 23, I was blessed to walk on the floor everyday of the United States Senate with President Pro Tempore Strom Thurmond (R-SC) holding on to me because he was so feeble to escort him to his chair as he opened the Senate in session. He was the icon but I was just an individual. Ironically, he was the first southern U.S. Senator to hire an African American on his staff. Daily, I knew I was carrying greatness but both he and God were carrying me. I recall my good friend, Dr Lloyd Ogilvie, Chaplain of US Senate inviting me to ‚Äúcarry him‚Äù or in today‚Äôs terms drive him to the National Prayer Breakfast to be his guest as Mother Teresa spoke before our President and national leaders. For a full year, it was my privilege to drive a Member of Congress in the House Leadership daily from his home to office and every stop in between or chaperoning Governors to Chiefs of Police. When I picked up my wife and carried her across the threshold into our honeymoon suite and home later, I knew without a shadow of doubt that I was ‚Äúcarrying greatness.‚Äù The two times I caught both Hannah Grace & Andrew Lincoln Shelton in the Emergency Room wearing surgical gloves as they were born and beheld a miracle from Heaven while in a hospital on earth I knew what was in my hands (and care). At the moment and every moment since, I have been entrusted to ‚Äúcarry greatness.‚Äù\n\nIn 1994, I drove to NC ‚Äúby faith‚Äù with hardly a dime to my name to attend a preacher‚Äôs conference in Walkertown, NC. While there, I saw a senior citizen dressed in a navy blue double breasted suit. My heart had compassion on this man and I felt the Holy Spirit inviting this senior and stranger to be my guest to a revival not even in my home state. I reached out to him but the moment I had him in my car I didn‚Äôt know his name, occupation but certain that something was special about him. My prayer was if he were lost he would be saved. I drove this man in my car and we get to the church and over 2,000 people are present. The service already started and when they saw me with the man I chaperoned they whisked on to the FRONT ROW! Then the unthinkable happens. The moderator of the pastor‚Äôs conference says: ‚ÄúOur guest speaker tonight has baptized over 63,000 souls in 70 years of ministry. He is pastor emeritus of Tennessee Temple Univ in Chattanooga, TN and an international evangelist. Join me and welcoming the podium DR LEE ROBERSON!!‚Äù Are you kidding me? The man I thought may be lost and was obedient to invite to a revival was the KEYNOTE speaker and I didn‚Äôt even know who or what I had in my car. All I know is looking back and by God‚Äôs grace I CARRIED GREATNESS and GREATNESS CARRIED ME and had a front row seat to prove it. PRAISE GOD!\n\nOver the years, I have been blessed to minister over a dozen times with my childhood hero, Basketball icon and Hall of Fame, Meadowlark Lemon. We have been in over five states together and we have had breakfast, lunch and dinner en route to preaching at events. The last time, I had him in my hometown of Waldorf, MD he asked me to drive him to the airport to Ronald Reagan Airport in DC to catch a flight to NY to be a guest that night on Sean Hannity. I‚Äôm not the sharpest tool in the shed but the entire time I knew I was CARRYING GREATNESS! One year ago next week (Dec 2, 2011), Meadowlark floored me and asked me to meet him in St Louis, MO as his guest to attend World Series Winner Albert Pujols charity gala. The ‚Äúgreats are gracious‚Äù and he took me to have dinner with Albert & Mrs Pujols, Lou Brock, Don Mattingly & Stan ‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù Musial! While in Guatemala, I was blessed to fly over with officials of Compassion International and interact and hug the destitute, become friends with the father-less and love those with the least. The highlight for me was being one of the one percent to ever meet in person the child we sponsor. The day I picked up Margaurita in person and held her above my head with my own hands without question ‚Äì I knew I was CARRYING GREATNESS. When former World Wrestling Champ Nikita Koloff and I were ministering in Jamaica with five time World Wrestling Champ Lex Luger we had dinner that night on the cruise. Lex had a stroke several years back and was struggling that night without his walker. Lex had a hard time doing down steps and Nikita grabbed his left arm and I took the right and had the privilege to have ‚ÄúThe Total Package‚Äù hang on us carrying him down a flight of steps.\n\nWhen my favorite Christian singer, Michael English was going through the toughest time of his life God impressed on me to write him notes of encouragement annually reminding him that the best was yet to come. I just knew that if he would read them in a small way and act of obedience and compassion we could do it again ‚Äúcarry greatness.‚Äù We have been blessed to minister nearly a dozen times in a couple states and today he is back singing to 10,000 per night with the Gaither Vocal Band. When they came to town earlier this year, Michael graciously gave us four FLOOR seats dead center! When we love on folks in their valley they dont forget you when back on the mountain!\n\nWhen one of best friends since fourth grade was strung out on drugs and the State of Maryland made a rare exception for me to visit him, pray and send him Scripture verses on a weekly basis, I knew that I was carrying greatness. Today, he‚Äôs married with half a dozen kids and a preacher of the Gospel. THAT IS GOD!! Greatness is not just man or a moment but the momentum that the Lord is going to use them in the future. When the smallest church in my home county called me three times and told me they were going to close the doors and sell the church my heart dropped. My calling is to do the work of an evangelist however, I had just vowed to God that I promised not to be so ‚Äúbig‚Äù that I wouldn‚Äôt cease to help the smallest church around. I was told long ago: ‚ÄúIf you are too big for the little things than you will be too little for the big things.‚Äù I cancelled half my bookings and for a year and half dedicated to preaching the Word, loving on people and stayed until they found their pastor. God builds the church but blesses the Christian for helping. Many may see me preach to a couple million next week again on TBN in California but God saw the country church when very few did in Maryland. Looking back, some of my best ministry is probably there. All ministry is massive when we do it for the Lord. Some see the public platform today but not the private preparation then. For me, it was always an Audience of One. I knew even then that to serve in the Lord‚Äôs House was part of ‚Äúcarrying Greatness‚Äù by preaching His Word and participating in His Work. Regardless, if ministering to Hollywood, homeless or one hooked on heroine it is all priceless to promote the Prince of Peace. Every single time I get up to preach the Gospel and see both Dr E.V. Hill & Dr Junior Hill‚Äôs signature inside the cover of my Bible, I know I‚Äôm carrying greatness. Not just because they signed it but Jesus sealed it and people still need the Lord and its been an honor to have a front row seat to watch God saves souls before my very eyes. God‚Äôs Word is our only Hope.\n\nALL of us carry greatness. It may not be a President or an earthly king but God has deposited dreams, calling and an assignment in all of us. Like the ‚ÄúFootprints‚Äù poem its actually GREATNESS carrying us. What makes individuals great is not the gift but the love of God for them. Inside every heart ever born is a God shaped vacuum that only He can fill. If you have a restlessness in your life it is the absence of a personal, vibrant saving relationship with Christ. You can have money in your bank but if you don‚Äôt have God in your tank than you are running on fumes. Pull over before it‚Äôs too late. For those who have already trusted Christ you have amazing greatness within you because as Kids of the King, the Lord is IN you.\n\nI have shared this story around the globe for over half my life and its one of my favorites. Enjoy! ‚ÄúIn 1863, a young lad played the solitare game ‚Äúhopskotch‚Äù in front of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. His game ceased when he saw the cries of a stranger. He approached the senior and asked: ‚ÄúMister, why do you cry?‚Äù The man barked: ‚ÄúYou are just a kid! You can do nothing for me. Get away!‚Äù The boy perplexed said: ‚ÄúMister, I don‚Äôt mean any harm. However, I must ask what‚Äôs bothering you because I cannot proceed with my game with you alone and upset.‚Äù The man rolled his eyes and said while pointing to towards The White House. ‚ÄúYoung boy, I have tried for three days to get through those gates to see the President.‚Äù The boy confused said: ‚ÄúWhy do you need to see him?‚Äù The man replied: ‚ÄúMy son has a warrant for his arrest for treason. He‚Äôs accused of fleeing in the midst of the ongoing Civil War. I raised him better than that and he would not flee much less neglect his duties.‚Äù The little lad said: ‚ÄúSir, that‚Äôs all you need?‚Äù The man said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all I need. But you are just a kid, you cannot do anything for me.‚Äù The boy said music to his ears: ‚ÄúFOLLOW ME.‚Äù When the guard saw the boy immediately the gates of The White House opened. They walked across the North Lawn of the most powerful address in the world and inside the Executive Mansion. The boy said: ‚ÄúWait here‚Äù and within four minutes come back down the spiral staircase steps with the most powerful person in the planet. He introdces President Lincoln, standing 6‚Äô4 adorning a stove top hat to his new friend he met on the street moments before. The Commander in Chief stands before a common man. The President hears the person‚Äôs plea and the Statesman grants the stranger a Presidential Pardon. HOW IN THE WORLD DID THE OLD MAN GET IN? The little lad was Tad Lincoln, the President‚Äôs son and the Bible is clear ‚ÄúNO MAN CAN GET TO THE FATHER ‚Äì unless you come in with SON.‚Äù (Jesus).\n\nLincoln had his share of loss, everyone knows his leadership, take comfort in his lonliness and be grateful for his legacy but make no mistake Lincoln was great but Jesus is God. However, every single day of my life I thank God for them both. One granted freedom temporaily the Other for all eternity. JESUS SAVES!\n\n* This article was printed in ‚ÄúCAROLINA VOICES‚Äù in 1996. My dear friend, Rev Ray Hardee graciously wrote it when Frank Shelton Jr was 24 years old."
