        "text": "Council minutes dated January 29, 1852 show that Council met and resolved to get $3,000 from the insurance company and re-build on the same site. Also noted in the same minutes was an entry stating that the Presbyterians had immediately passed a resolution to offer the Lutherans the use of their church on Sabbath afternoons. The next day, St. Mark’s made the same offer and offered the use of their basement for Lutheran Sunday School.\n\nThe rebuilding of the church after the devastating fire did not go smoothly. First, there was an insurance issue. According to church records, the church structure had been insured for $3,000.00; however, the insurance company reneged on the agreement and paid only half of that amount. During the ensuing litigation between the contractor and the insurance company, the lot and ruins were sold by the sheriff. The buyer was a congregation member named Daniel Fichthorn, whose name is\n\noften mentioned in our church records. Fichthorn purchased the lot and ruins for $795.00 and then transferred the property back to the church for $451.50.\n\nThe anticipated cost of rebuilding the church was $3,300.00, with the understanding that the new church would be built on some of the\n\nexisting walls that survived the fire. Securing enough money to rebuild proved challenging. In addition to the generous offerings from\n\ncongregation members, the women of the church sponsored various fundraising events to raise money. According to church records, some\n\nmemorial funds were tapped for various projects; for example, a memorial fund was used to purchase a new 500 pound bell for the newly\n\nrebuilt steeple. (This steeple and bell were later destroyed when a tornado ripped through Lewistown.)\n\nThe actual rebuilding began in June of 1852. By this time, the pastor, Pastor John Rosenberg, had become quite discouraged and he resigned his position in November of 1852. He was replaced by Pastor C.M. Klink, who was reported to be \"the man for the job.\"\n\nIn May of 1853, the congregation held a meeting after the worship service. They authorized the purchase of the adjoining lot for erecting a parsonage and an additional lot to serve as the Lutheran Cemetery. The cost of each was $500.00. The financial strain on the church was great, but they resolved to raise the needed money. One member even mortgaged his property to raise money for the projects.\n\nThe following month, the congregation authorized Council to adopt the policy of “renting the pews in accordance with such scale as they may adopt.” The exact fees for renting pews is unknown, but it appears that the fees were based on the space needed and location of the pews. Our archives contain Pew Rent ledgers from 1862-1865, and it appears that the fees ranged from $1.25 to $3.75, paid quarterly.\n\nThe Civil War began with the attack on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861. Our church records give us unique insight into the impact of the Civil War on our community.\n\nOur archives contain “Sunday School Minute Books”. These books were used each week to record the attendance of teachers; the attendance of male and female students; recent congregational births or deaths; and a sentence or two about the weather and local concerns. Most entries began with something like, “The Lord has blessed us again on this cool pleasant morning…” or “This is a beautiful warm and clear Sabbath morning, it appears that the very light from Heaven is shining upon us.”\n\nAs the conflict with the South gained momentum, the authors of the “Sunday School Minute Books” began to record news from various battles, always asking God to spare the country. The first mention of the conflict was recorded on April 14, 1861. The author of the entry wrote, “This morning the Lord has again permitted us to meet in the Infant Sabbath School Room in peace and quietness, while many others this day, prevented this blessing on account of a civil war now commenced in South Carolina, in our beloved land. May the Lord save us from a bloody war.” On April 21, 1861, the dame author wrote, “We again have been permitted to meet in the Infant Room in a goodly number. We are near the seat of War, but our town is in a great excitement about 300 of our citizens have already gone to the scene of war. May the God of all Battles be with our noble troops, and that peace may be soon restored to us.”\n\nThe following is a continuation of last week’s more notable entries in the “Sunday School Minute Books”. It is clear that the Civil War was of constant concern to the congregation, and there are many references to men from Lewistown that joined the army. Most of the entries were written immediately following major battles.\n\nMay 12, 1861: “Our Country is on the verge of a bloody war with the Southern rebels.”\n\nJuly 21, 1861 (after 1st Battle of Bull Run): “About 3 or 4,000 souls were hurried from here into eternity on the Battlefield in an act of Civil War.”\n\nSeptember 21, 1862 (after Battle at Antietam): “This is again a very pleasant Sabbath and full school. Since last Sabbath, Thousands of our soldiers were laid low by the ravages of war in Maryland – God save the Country.”\n\nJune 21, 1863 (shortly before Gettysburg): “The Rebel army are endeavouring to make Penna the seat of war. God forbid.”\n\nJune 28, 1863: “This is a pleasant day in appearance, but sad to many hearts of the adult portion of our community on account of the approach of the rebel army into Penna and near us, yet the school is full of interesting scholars.”\n\nAdded to the bottom of the same page: “A company of 100 men left this morning for the seat of war more are preparing to go, may God be with them and may our beloved country and its free institutions be perpetuated.”\n\nJuly 5, 1863 (Battle of Gettysburg): “We have good news from our army this morning. The rebel army that has invaded Pennsylvania is becoming overcome by our army, under the blessing of God. Our President has issued a Proclamation, calling upon the people to give thanks to God for recent victories and asking his blessings for the future. May God give us victory!”\n\nJuly 12, 1863: “Since our last meeting, we have news from different parts of our land of the complete success of the Union army. God be thanked for it, but the battlefields are crimson with blood and strewed with the dead.”\n\nApril 16, 1865: (Assassination of Lincoln) “This is a day of National gloom, on account of the cruel assassination of our President A. Lincoln, a day long to be remembered in America.”\n\nMay 21, 1865: “Jeff Davis, the Arch traitor of the American Rebellion is arrested and is now at Fortress Morrow to await his awful doom as a traitor. May God have mercy on his soul.”\n\nThe post-Civil War era was apparently financially comfortable for the Lutherans. Three extensive repair projects occurred over the next 30 years. The gallery in the rear of the church was removed and several unspecified improvements were made during the pastorate of Dr. J.B. Baltzy (1868-1870) at a cost of $3,000.00. On July 4, 1874, a tornado blew through Lewistown and destroyed the steeple and bell. (They were replaced two years later.) A major renovation occurred in 1882. The Council resolved to raise the money to “put the church property in a suitable state of repair” at a cost of $2,300.00. This renovation included cushions for the pews (people were complaining that the paint on the pews stuck to their clothing!); new furniture; painted woodwork and walls inside the church; carpeting; repair to basement windows; repair to the organ; and the installation of a new altar rail. There is a faded photograph of the interior of this church hanging in the hallway leading to the library. It is the last photograph on the right.\n\nIn 1890, plans were made to erect a Chapel for use by the growing Sunday School programs. It was decided that the existing stable, located next to the sanctuary, would be torn down, and the Chapel would be built on that site. (This is where our Fellowship Hall is today.) A building fund was created and it was resolved that construction of the foundation would begin when there was $6,000.00 in the fund. The actual cost of the entire addition was only $4,000.00. The 1892 cornerstone for this addition still exists on the Main Street side of the church.\n\nThe first Lutheran Cemetery was located on the Third Street next to the first church that was built in 1824. (This is the site where the Henderson Fire House currently sits). The cemetery was added to that lot in 1827 and was used as a Lutheran burial site until 1854. On April 29, 1854, the church sold the old 1824 church to “the Borough of Lewistown for a firehouse for $450.00, payable April 1855.” In May of 1854, the church purchased our present cemetery, located on Fourth Street. The Council minutes stated: “The committee on the Grave Yard purchased John Sterett’s lot adjoining the Methodist Grave Yard for $505.00. One half of the purchase price was paid in cash and the remaining $250.00 was to be paid on April1, 1855.”\n\nAll was well until March of 1883 when Council decided to dispose of the original burial ground. The Trustees were directed to “dispose of the old burial ground in the manner they may deem advisable, and to see that the bodies yet remaining be properly removed and reinterred in our present burial ground.” Three months later, the Trustees came back to Council with the following report: 1) 40-50 bodies remained in the original cemetery; 2) the cost to remove the bodies was in excess of $100.00; 3) the amount of space required to reinter was problematic; 4) the removal of the bodies would require the entire lot to be dug up; 5) too many congregation members objected to this plan; 6) the plan would “bring a stigma upon the church”; and 7) “there is no money in the transaction.” It is unclear whether the bodies were ever removed. Hopefully a review of our archived cemetery records will tell us.\n\nIn 1892, talk began that the congregation had outgrown the church and something needed to be done. Council appointed a committee to brainstorm ideas for “the accumulation of money as a building fund for the rebuilding of a church edifice for St. John’s…” . Council resolved that there was a need for a larger church and that the church “will not be better able to build when the necessity is upon us than we are now able.” They resolved to have the new church completed during the summer of 1896. That didn’t happen. Instead, the church made a plan of action and created a building fund to accumulate the needed funds.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a gap in our historical records from 1890 to 1902. In piecing together information from other documents, we know that plans were made to tear down the existing church and rebuild a larger church on the same site. The church was torn down in July of 1900, and the construction of the larger church - our present day church - began immediately.\n\nThe new church – our church - was built in the Romanesque style, and was modeled after one of the Lutheran cathedrals in Hanover, Germany. The seating capacity was 600, which was unheard of in Lewistown. A local newspaper article from 1902 boasted that the structure had “a heating plant with the capacity to make comfortable the church, chapel and parsonage” and “toilet rooms privately locked and modernly fitted.” The pipe organ was a gift from Andrew Carnegie. The cost of the new church was between $25,000.00 and $30,000.00.\n\nThe cornerstone for the church was laid on December 16, 1900, and approximately 1000 people attended the ceremony. The finished church was dedicated on February 16, 1902. Three church services were held that day (with standing room only at all three!), and the services were highlighted by music by the choir and soloists; speakers including past pastors of the church; and an organ recital of the magnificent new organ!\n\n​\n\nYou will recall that in 1892, a Sunday School chapel was erected adjacent to the church on the Main Street side. This sparked a gradual increase in Sunday School attendance so that by the early 1900’s, as many as 500 people were attending Sunday School. Fortunately, the church had entered a period of prosperity during this time, so Council began to make plans to build an extension to the 1892 chapel. Preliminary plans were made and funds were raised, and the cornerstone for the chapel was finally laid on September 17, 1911.\n\nInteresting note: The 1911 cornerstone for the Sunday School extension can be seen in the courtyard. When we sold our first Third Street church and property to the Borough of Lewistown for the building of the Henderson Fire House, several years passed before the borough tore the church down and built the fire house. When they did, they returned our original cornerstone, dated 1824. That same cornerstone was used again as the cornerstone for the 1911 Sunday School extension. Prior to it being laid, it was given to H.A. Luck, a local marble dealer, who had the stone re-faced and re-cut with the two dates: 1824 and 1911. You may have noticed that H.A. Luck’s name is on our baptismal font."
