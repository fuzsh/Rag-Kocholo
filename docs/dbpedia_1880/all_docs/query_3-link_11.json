        "text": "The following letter was written by 29 year-old Andrew Jackson Huntoon (1832-1902), the son of Lemuel Huntoon (1793-1878) and Sibel Palmer (1794-1874) of Sullivan county, New Hampshire. Andrew was a physician who came to Kansas in 1857, settling south of Topeka in Williamsport, Shawnee County. In mid-July 1861 he enlisted under Captain John Ritchie, in Co. A, 5th Kansas Cavalry, Colonel Hamilton P. Johnson commanding. In August in was detailed as assistant surgeon of that regiment, and in February 1862 was commissioned as its surgeon. “Dr. Huntoon was in service in all the stirring scenes along the border, and accompanied Clayton’s expedition to Helena, Arkansas, in all of which the barbarism of guerrilla warfare was added to the usual dangers of military service. At Helena, he was attacked with chronic diarrhea, and from which he could get no relief, and in 1863 he returned home unfit for duty. Here he was enrolled in Co. A, Second Regiment Kansas State Militia under Colonel Veale and was commissioned captain.” During Price’s 1864 raid, Capt. Huntoon was taken prisoner with 60 others and force-marched 240 miles on foot before they were paroled. After mustering out he settled in Topeka, where he died in 1902.\n\nAndrew wrote this letter to his wife Elizabeth P. Foster (1828-1891) and his 1 year-old son, Prentice L. Huntoon (1860-1864).\n\nTranscription\n\nCamp near Fort Scott of Co. A, 5th Regt. Kansas Vols, USA\n\nAugust 25th 1861\n\nMy ever dear wife and boy,\n\nYour letter of the 28th July was received at Kansas City as I was on my return from Fort Leavenworth to Fort Scott on the 18th inst. It is an occasion of regret, so much of the spirit of despondency as your letter indicates, and to learn that Prentice is suffering from a sore mouth. To learn that father is worse does not disappoint me. His life has been prolonged beyond my expectations. I would like to see you very much, although you intimate in your letter that yourself and Prentice are entirely forgotten. How can you judge me so? I know I judge my Lizzie’s truly when I say she wants to see me very much. It makes me feel bad and very uneasy to have you feel as you do about my entering the service & I hope you will think and feel better of it. All I regret is being from you.\n\nI arrived at Fort Scott on my trip from Leavenworth on Wednesday the 21st. Found the boys all well & glad to see me. They had scouted thoroughly for thirty miles but found no enemy. On Friday we had orders to move 25 miles east to McNeal’s Mills, Missouri, to dislodge an armed force reported 400 strong entrenched at that place & proceeded accordingly. On arriving there, we took possession of the town, capturing twenty prisoners and destroyed the fortification. The rebel army left the evening before on learning of our approach, their campfires still smoking. We secured some sesesh property for confiscation and returned the following day. Got six horses and other property.\n\nCol. [William] Weer arrived last evening with 500 men [4th Kansas Infantry] and Col. [H. P.] Johnson this morning with 400 hundred. We camped with Johnson as we for a part of his regiment. His brother is Surgeon and I am Assistant Surgeon and am already installed in that position. Have 8 patients under my immediate care & 4 am attending with Dr. Johnson. My wages will amount to near one hundred and ten dollars per month, besides entitling me to a servant to take care of my horses, of which I am to have two. I can resign this position which is one of comparative safety and good pay, if you think best.\n\nLizzie, it is your happiness I desire above all else on earth & the welfare of my boy. We have labored hard and endured much privation together for the last four years. Still I have enjoyed your earnest cooperation in all my efforts & been happy. I can resign my position in the army, go on to my farm, and if I know your happiness is promoted by so doing, it is all I ask. I would like to relieve myself from debt & I believe you would like to have me. My present position would assist me much. Our separation has caused me many sad hours & will continue to. You say you have hard feelings towards me & cannot help it. I may have deserved such by my course. God only knows the unselfishness of my intentions. Lizzie, I would have been a sacrifice to my own happiness when I consented for you to go East, had I not thought I was promoting yours by so doing.\n\nIt shall be as you say—resign or remain. Should you feel that I better remain for the present at least, I would think you better remain in the East, if you can feel contented. But come to Kansas by all means if you prefer after the hot weather. Select a boarding place to suit you & I will send you money after a while. If you prefer to return to Kansas, you can come & spend a month with me in camp. Col. Johnson has his wife along. She is a very plain, sensible woman. I would like very much to see you and Prentice & to have you with me once more. I hope you will not permit yourself to feel that I have forgotten or are neglecting you. Write me often. (Direct to Asst. Surgeon, 5th Regt. Kansas Vols, Kansas City, Mo.)\n\nGive my love to all. And with kisses for my own dear Lizzie and Prentice, believe me truly yours, — A. J. Huntoon"
