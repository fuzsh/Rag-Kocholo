The Virgin Mary has continued to appear daily for 40 years. Over 50 million pilgrims have visited Medjugorje since 1981.\n\nThe Virgin Mary identified Herself as the Queen of Peace. Hundreds of millions around the world have followed the messages Mary has given.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nThe Virgin Mary has told three secrets. These \"secrets\" will be released to prove to the whole world Her apparitions are real. The 40th anniversary, June 25, 2021, is believed to be a marker for the secrets to be released sometime in the near future.\n\nThe six people known as the \"visionaries,\" said that God sent Mary to the world to tell us God exists.\n\nCaritas of Birmingham, in Sterrett, Alabama, is the largest center in the world propagating these apparitions. Caritas has been fondly referred to by pilgrims as \"Mejabama,\" meaning \"Medjugorje Alabama.\"\n\nBecause of coronavirus and travel regulations, pilgrims from across the United States began to gather this week at Caritas of Birmingham, celebrating the Medjugorje 40th Anniversary.\n\nIn 1988, one of the Medjugorje visionaries Marija Pavlovic, came to Birmingham and stayed in the home of Terry and Annette Colafrancesco. Marija was in Birmingham to donate a kidney to her sick brother.\n\nWhile Marija was staying in the Colafrancesco home for two and a half months, she witnessed her apparitions of the Virgin Mary every day. People came from every state and other nations to venerate the Virgin Mary at the Colafrancesco home and in a nearby field.\n\nAfter one such apparition, Marija relayed that the Virgin Mary wanted a community to start at the site.\n\nNow, a community of believers prays and works at the site surrounding the Colafrancesco home. Since 1988, Caritas of Birmingham has become the destination for hundreds of thousands of pilgrims.\n\nTerry Colafrancesco, founder of Caritas of Birmingham said, \"We do not try to convince people about what has happened here. You will feel it when you come. The proof is that this was nothing but a cow pasture. Now, it is the largest Medjugorje center in the world. Only God can do that.\"\n\nSome of the media outlets that have covered the Medjugorje phenomenon are: ABC 20/20, the BBC, Reader's Digest, National Geographic and Life Magazine. The 20/20 segment, Life Magazine, and a special Martin Sheen documentary on Medjugorje were produced with the help of Terry Colafrancesco.\n\nNumerous scientific studies of the Medjugorje apparitions culminated in a final scientific declaration released on March 10, 2010, which stated that the visions are \"absent of deceit.\"\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has yet to make a formal statement on the apparitions, but the faithful are free to venerate and promote Medjugorje.\n\nAccording to the Diocese of Birmingham, Terry Colafrancesco and the Caritas Community are Catholics in good standing.\n\nRuth McDonald, a spokesman for Caritas said, \"Caritas of Birmingham has been considered a place of conversion for thousands through the years. What has taken place here has been even beyond what God did at the Fatima and Guadalupe apparition sites. Those two places had 11 apparitions combined. Here in Alabama, there have been 204 apparitions.\"\n\nPeople wanting to pray at Caritas for the Medjugorje 40th anniversary, are encouraged to come for the daily Rosary at 11:00 AM, the time that the Medjugorje visionaries will witness their vision of the Virgin Mary.\n\nOther talks will also be held throughout the two days. Updates are posted on Medjugorje.com, the official Medjugorje/Caritas website.\n\nFor media inquiries or footage, contact:Jessica Ross and Reyes Silva[email protected] 205-672-2000\n\nSOURCE Caritas of Birmingham\n\nSTERRETT, Alabama -- The telephones have been ringing constantly at Caritas of Birmingham, a ministry based in Shelby County, as people from across America make plans to visit Alabama for what they believe are supernatural events of cosmic importance.\n\nCaritas promotes the visions of the Virgin Mary claimed by six children who said the mother of Jesus began appearing to them every day in their small village of Medjugorje, Yugoslavia, in 1981.\n\nOne of the visionaries, Marija Pavlovic Lunetti, has been a regular visitor to Birmingham since she first came in 1988 to donate a kidney for her brother, Andrija Pavlovic, at UAB Hospital.\n\nShe will return July 1-5, and is expected to continue having her daily visions. Her visits routinely draw thousands of pilgrims hoping to be in the presence of the Virgin Mary during one of the apparitions. “There is more of an intimacy with Marija here,” said Ruth McDonald, who has lived the past 22 years as one of 55 residents of the religious community at Caritas of Birmingham. “That’s not something you get in Medjugorje. Marija is very comfortable here. You feel that.”\n\nIt’s a big boost to tourism on U.S. 280, where hotels fill up with pilgrims.\n\n“We have two to four people on the phones constantly,” McDonald said. They do daily prayers and chores on the farm, and work in the Caritas printing operation. They also take calls from all over the country from those wanting to attend the events involving Lunetti.\n\n“We never know how many people are coming,” McDonald said. “It’s definitely word of mouth. We’re hearing from a whole lot of people.”\n\nCaritas of Birmingham founder Terry Colafrancesco is currently in Medjugorje with a tour group of about 60 people organized and led by Caritas. Lunetti will be traveling back to Alabama from Medjugorje, which is now part of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nCaritas runs a mission house in Medjugorje that provides books and pamphlets promoting the visions. Caritas last year spent more than $8 million on expansion at its main building on Shelby County 43 about six miles off U.S. 280 near Chelsea. The four-story Tabernacle of Our Lady’s Messages contains a massive publishing operation that produces 500,000 booklets a week sent worldwide to promote the visions. A $2.2 million binding machine added last year churns out book-lets, many of them written by Colafrancesco under his pen name, “A Friend of Medjugorje.”\n\nA collection of all the messages of the Virgin Mary as related by the Medjugorje visionaries was first published in 1990 by Caritas, called “Words From Heaven,” and has been updated 13 times with new messages. “That is the most complete book of the messages that is available,” McDonald said. “We keep the American messages updated as well, whenever Marija comes here.”\n\nMillions of copies of the book are in circulation, McDonald said.\n\nLunetti, married with four children and living in Milan, Italy, stays at Colafrancesco’s house on her annual visits to Alabama. She has her daily visions in the house, or out in a field on Caritas property under a pine tree.\n\n“We find out the day before” when and where the visions will be, McDonald said.\n\nOn previous Fourth of July visits, she has had an apparition in the field at about 10:30 p.m. on July 3.\n\n“The whole purpose of these days of prayer is there’s a much greater emphasis in prayer for our country,” McDonald said. “There is a lot of concern for the direction of the country, where we are economically, concerns about freedoms and liberties that can be taken away.”\n\nThe Vatican has been monitoring and investigating the Medjugorje visions for three decades, and has neither condemned nor approved them. The visions of Medjugorje are currently under investigation by a special Vatican commission. There has still been no ruling from the Vatican on the authenticiy of the visions. It’s unlikely to approve while the visions are still occurring, for fear they could go from harmless talk of peace and prayer to heretical pronouncements.\n\n“The visionaries have all been brought in and talked to privately,” McDonald said. Caritas expects and hopes that the Vatican will issue a proclamation at least approving of travel to Medjugorje for pilgrims.\n\nCatholic Church officials, including Bishop Robert Baker of Birmingham, continue to advise caution about the visions. Baker forbids priests from saying Mass at Caritas, but allows a special Mass at Our Lady of the Valley Catholic Church to accommodate visiting pilgrims.\n\nThe church’s official reluctance hasn’t stunted the popularity of the visions.\n\nCaritas has upgraded its website, www.mej.com, to handle heavy international traffic. “That has made it possible for people to be connected with us throughout the world,” McDonald said. The fact that Lunetti and other visionaries continue to claim messages from the Virgin Mary 31 years after they started is unprecedented in Catholic Church history, and believers think it is a miraculous gift from God.\n\n“We believe it’s God’s mercy,” McDonald said. “He’s trying to give his children as much time as possible to come back to him so we can live the commandments according to God’s love. The whole purpose of Our Lady coming is to bring us closer to her son. She always points us to her son, God’s son, to seek his forgiveness and grow closer to him.”\n\nJoin the conversation by clicking to comment or email Garrison at [email protected].\n\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

But, unless you live there or know someone who does, it is unlikely that you’ve taken the time to drive through the small, unincorporated town. I visited often as a child. My grandmother’s “people,” the Howards, were residents and hosted family events. I remember them referring to it as “Jugtown,” but not until more recently did I learn why. Sometimes, it just pays to be an Antiques Roadshow fan.\n\nOne memorable episode was filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Among the plethora of Native American artifacts and western memorabilia was something that hit close to “home.” The viewer brought an auction find purchased for $50. She didn’t realize until she got all the dried mud and gunk cleaned off that the jug had an inscription. Written in the glaze was “J.B. Skinner” and “Sterrett, Alabama.” So, who was J.B. Skinner and what was he doing in Sterrett, Alabama?\n\nIt seems that the jug held secrets to part of this county’s history. Sterrett, or Jugtown, was settled and tamed primarily by potters hoping to make a living using the skills they had. In the 1830s, when “Alabama fever” was at its hottest, thousands rushed to take advantage of cheap, virgin land. With no glass, no plastic or no metal storage cans to keep perishables safe, those providing stoneware were important members of a community. It seems that the Falkner family migrated into the Sterrett area in the 1850s and settled on land with very nice clay deposits. The completed kiln was fired about seven years later. This was not their first foray into Alabama, however. They first settled in Randolph County and worked there for about twelve years. Intermarrying with other potter families there allowed techniques originating in North Carolina to become a part of their craft.\n\nThus began a long tradition of the “jug makers” in Jugtown. The “J.P.” on the Oklahoma jug was Jonathan Payton and he worked in the 1890s. The churns, jugs, pots, smoking pipes and even marbles turned out by various members of the extended family and those who worked with them are unique to time and place. The utensils have a distinctive light green color caused by the use of a lime-based alkaline glaze. Given the vast amounts of limestone quarried in Shelby County, that should come as no surprise to anyone.\n\nFurther research led to a fantastic resource. If you want to know more about Jugtown, check out Joey Brackner’s Alabama Folk Pottery. There is a beautiful photograph of a “Skinner vessel” in it. Makes you realize what a lump of Alabama clay can become in the hands of true artisans. Today, I don’t know of anyone in Shelby County who owns a piece of Sterrett pottery, but I would love to find out. If you happen to know of a local jug still around, please contact me at [email protected].
