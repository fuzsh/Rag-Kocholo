        "text": "I’ve never done as much research as I’ve done for this middle grade novel on the founding fathers. Every chapter is an adventure . . . And I never know what I’m going to uncover.\n\n​\n\nPart 1 – How I Do The Research: I learned within the first 10 chapters that I need 3 different kinds of research for each one. First and most importantly, I look up the man who died. It’s your only chance to meet him.\n\n​\n\nI need at least three sources of information about him. Then I cut and paste the sources together. If I find the same fact 3 times, I can use it. Less, I can’t. Even then I still need to decide which facts are important, and which ones to skip.\n\n​​\n\nNext, I research the death year from the American Revolution. I copy and paste everything, until I know what’s important. Finally, I look up what my main character, Charles Carroll of Carrollton was doing. I save everything he did that year. The same rules still apply – I need to know which facts I can verify, and which ones fit in the chapter.\n\nNote – I save all three kinds of research, after my first draft of the actual chapter. Then I paste the research in the order it fit in the chapter, with all the source links. The last and biggest part, that’s all the stuff that didn’t fit in, verified or not, with their source links too. It’s there, just in case.\n\nThe first draft of a chapter is 10 pages or less. The research I use is usually 5-8 pages, and the rest, it’s what didn’t fit. The whole document is usually 30-40 pages altogether.\n\n​\n\nPart 2 – Stuck on a Fire: The idea for this post came when I hit chapter 36. I was stuck for 2 days on the research, and I couldn’t move forward until I pieced it together.\n\nWhen I looked up tobacco planting in the 1790s, I discovered they burned the seed beds before they planted them. I couldn’t imagine setting a fire on purpose – I grew up with Smokey the Bear. And today kids are still taught NOT to set fires, and I was writing about setting one. WHOA!\n\n​\n\n​ The first thing I looked up – controlled burns.\n\nThe link: Controlled Burns on the Farm | Beginning Farmers\n\nI learned from Beginning Farmers that you wait for a calm day to start the burn. Go to the bottom of a hill with the wind blowing up the slope. Set your fire so the wind blows away from people and houses. Aim it towards things like creeks, dirt roads, or rock barriers. Those 4 ideas helped, but I still wasn’t ready to write.\n\n​ I also looked up this link: 13869 (ncpedia.org)\n\n​\n\nIt’s from North Carolina’s encyclopedia. The title – Tobacco Farming the Old Way. I copied the pages I needed, but I didn’t use them. Why? I already had that information, but it confirmed the facts I knew.\n\nI’ve never started a fire without matches so I found another source:\n\nLink: How to Start a Fire With Flint and Steel | The Art of Manliness\n\n​\n\nI copied and saved the supplies I need for the chapter. I’ll get a piece of flint, steel, and a char cloth. They all have specific requirements to start a real fire, but I don’t need to do that. Only write about it. Next, I’ll find some tinder. That’s dry grass or bits of plants from last year.\n\n​\n\nI also copied two pictures from that link. I had to remember what they looked like. If I can’t picture them, you won’t when you read the words.\n\n​\n\nI couldn’t share my pictures. I wasn’t sure if they were copyrighted so I took a screenshot from the search engine. The second and fifth pictures are the ones that helped me start a fire of words for you.\n\nBut I still couldn’t write, so I found a YouTube video. I watched it a few times and wrote down these notes:\n\n- fire burns slowly\n\n- hearing crackling\n\n- left behind black ash\n\n​ - edge of flame licked edge of field\n\n​\n\nThen I could write my controlled fire scene in chapter 36. Charley sets the fire, watches it burn, and keeps it under control. I was thrilled! My critique partners said they could picture the fire, all from my words. As a writer, that’s as good as it gets!\n\nAnd the link: VN 000355 L65 CB283 16x9 3m30s 230620M (youtube.com)\n\nPart 3 – False Family Connections: ​\n\n​Meet the four delegates from South Carolina who signed the Declaration of Independence. The first is Edward Rutledge from Chapter 38 of my middle grade novel. I thought I found a great angle – that he was the brother-in-law of the other three. Then I double checked my research.\n\n​\n\nEdward Rutledge and Arthur Middleton WERE brothers-in-law. Edward married Arthur’s sister, Henrietta. He died on New Year’s Day in 1787. I knew that – Arthur died in Chapter 14.\n\nHenrietta Rutledge died in 1792, and Edward remarried. My source said he was related to the other men through his second wife, Mary Shubrick Everleigh. And that source:\n\nEdward Rutledge | Facts, Early Years, Life, Death, Military & Politics (revolutionary-war.net)\n\n​​\n\n​\n\n​Edward Rutledge died in January 23, 1800. Thomas Heyward was still alive, so I kept looking.\n\nThomas married twice. His first wife, Elizabeth Matthews. The second, Elizabeth Savage. No Shubrick’s there, and Rutledge wasn’t mentioned, AT ALL. Here’s one of the sources I checked:\n\n​\n\nThomas Heyward, Jr. | Facts, Early Years, Life, Death & Politics (revolutionary-war.net)\n\n​Finished 6/28/24\n\nI focused on Mount Vernon and found myself in a middle grade spy novel that takes place today. OOPS! Lesson learned – read the description next time and look at the book cover 😊\n\nThe main characters in this novel are a trio of kids from Virginia who love spy-fare. They wind up putting a few of George Washington’s techniques to good use. They even bring down a spy ring. How? You’ll have to read for yourself!\n\nMy favorite part – the things I learned about the Capital, Mount Vernon, George Washington’s tombs, and how Stephen Smith came up with this novel idea. I love a good back story!\n\n​\n\nThat Back Story\n\nThis is Book 7 in the Virginia Mysteries series. Three research trips to Mount Vernon helped Stephen find the bare bones for his plot. It’s also where he saw the real key from the Bastille, the infamous French prison. It was a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette. He traveled from France to help Washington fight, then beat the British.\n\nSome of the inspiration came from movies and television. The first and biggest, TURN, the mini-series about Washington as general and spymaster. The second came from the second National Treasure movie and its scene from Mount Vernon’s backyard. The third came from the movie Patriot Games, and it inspired the climax, the boat chase scene in the book. And finally, The American President which features a teenage daughter. Stephen switched the character to a son.\n\nGeorge Washington, Spymaster-in-Chief\n\n​\n\nThis is the Battle of Long Island. Alonzo Chappel painted it in 1858, over 80 years later. The smoke is from the Maryland guns and cannon. They attacked the British so the rest of the Continental Army could escape.\n\n​\n\nThe real battle was fought from August 27 – 29, 1776. It was the war’s first major battle and a huge loss for the Americans. General Washington didn’t return to New York until 1783, when the war was over. For more information and photos – Battle of Long Island - Wikipedia\n\n​\n\nAfter his loss, Washington realized he’d missed some key information. He set up his own spy ring, and he was Agent 711. If you want to learn more about the tools his spies used, read this novel. A trio of teens put a few of them to good use – like secret code names, dead drops, invisible ink, cyphers, and coded messages.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the Culper Spy ring and what I wrote about it, check out George Washington’s Secret Six.

It was supposed to be George’s, and you’ll find it two stories under the Capital Rotunda.\n\nWhen George Washington died in 1799, the Capitol was still under construction. It was supposed to have a glass floor so the public could see the tomb. George said no thank you. He asked Martha to build him a new tomb at Mt. Vernon, and he put that wish into his will. But Martha didn’t get it done, AND she agreed to the plan for Washington, D.C.\n\nBut THAT didn’t happen either. There were problems with the cost of the project. In the meantime, George was buried in the old family tomb, #2, even though he asked for a new one. It wasn’t built until after 1830, after someone tried to steal George’s head. OOOH, Yuck!\n\nThat someone also vandalized the corpses of a few of George’s relatives too. That’s when John Washington, Mt. Vernon’s owner in 1830 finally built the new tomb, #3. If you’d like to see it, take a look at the cover again. It’s on the bottom left.\n\nAnd the other question, why did George want a new tomb? The novel from Mt. Vernon said . . . “Apparently when it rained, the crypt often flooded, disturbing the tombs and graves inside.”\n\n​\n\nFor more information and photos – Link: Washington Tomb · George Washington's Mount Vernon\n\n​\n\n​ A Subway System, Under the Capital?\n\nI had no idea what was under the Capital until I read this middle grade novel! There are 3 of them; they’re called people mover systems. I think it’s a great name!\n\nThey connect the Capital to all the Senate office buildings, but only one goes to the House. They move our Senators and Representatives to work every day.\n\nThe first line was built in 1909. A monorail was installed in 1960, then again in 1965. After 1993 the trains ran automatically.\n\n​\n\nYou can travel on it too, but only if you’re on a Capital Complex tour, AND you must be with a staff member who has the proper ID.\n\n​\n\n​​This is the floor plan for the Capital basement. The House and Senate systems don’t begin/end in the same places, but they are connected by a labyrinth of tunnels.\n\n​\n\n​You’ll find the Senate subway terminal on the bottom right. They connect to the Russell, Dirksen, and Hart office buildings. If there’s a vote in the Senate, the Russell subway is restricted. Only Senators and their staff can ride. Since 9/11, there are also restrictions for visitors who want to ride the subway to either the Hart or Dirksen building.\n\nThe Rayburn subway terminal for the House is on the top left. You’ll find underground walkways to the rest of the House office buildings on the bottom left. If there’s a vote in the House, the subway is also restricted. Only Congressmen and their staff can use it.\n\n​\n\nFor more information and photos Link: United States Capitol subway system - Wikipedia\n\n​​\n\nAmazon’s Description:\n\nDead drops, cyphers, and invisible ink are all part of a mystery that even spymaster George Washington would love.\n\nSam, Derek, and Caitlin love solving mysteries, and when they visit Washington, DC, spies are lurking. What starts out as a fun game of pretend on the National Mall turns all too real when they follow a mysterious man to a meeting deep within the Capitol.\n\nTo keep government secrets from falling into the wrong hands, the kids must work with federal agents and travel to historic Mount Vernon for a state dinner with the president and his son. Dead drops, cyphers and spy chases are all part of what their most dangerous adventure might be ever—if it isn’t their last.\n\nSpies at Mount Vernon is the seventh book in The Virginia Mysteries series, but it also makes a great standalone read. The story is the perfect complement to social studies units covering George Washington as well as field trips and family vacations to Washington, DC and Mount Vernon.\n\nIf you enjoy mystery and adventure like the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Magic Tree House, or National Treasure, you’ll love author Steven K. Smith’s exciting middle-grade series. The stories are modern-day fictional mysteries with twists of real locations and events from Virginia history. These fast-paced books are popular with both boys and girls ages 7-12, appealing to even reluctant readers\n\n​\n\nCharles Carroll of Carrollton was a big reader.

Written under the pseudonym of \"Poor Richard\" or \"Richard Saunders,\" Poor Richard's Almanack (sometimes Almanac) is a collection annual publications (between 1739-1758) of the famous and late Benjamin Franklin. The Almanack contains typical almanac features, such as: calendar, weather, poetry, figures of speech, astronomy, and astrology. Many of Franklin's writings in Poor Richard's Almanack also contain math exercises, and satirical proverbs written by Franklin himself. This version of the book contains the Almanack (1739-1758) with also four letters/conversations between Benjamin Franklin and George Washington (1789) and Benjamin Franklin addressing Robert Morris (1780). The purpose of providing letters two decades after the final piece of the Almanack was published is to provide readers with a historical framework of how entries of the Almanack reflect not only Benjamin Franklin's anonymity but also at that time, early-American consciousness' of attitudes which laid the blueprint for the shaping of early-America and later-America.\n\n​\n\n4/2/24\n\nI knew I had to read this when the treaty with the Barbary pirates came up as one of the big events of 1794. Once I picked up the book, I realized it started earlier, in 1785, and it finished in 1809.\n\nThe prologue begins when Captain Richard O’Brien’s ship is captured in July of 1785, two years after the end of the Revolution. The pirates kept the ship, but they threw the crew into slavery. Most were freed 10 long years later. A few died as slaves.\n\nChapter 1 begins in March of 1786 when Thomas Jefferson and John Adams met to talk about piracy, and how they could free O’Brien’s crew. They’d already been held as slaves for 3 years. A treaty wouldn’t be signed into law until 1794. The US paid tribute to the Barbary states. In return they promised to leave American merchant ships alone, and to free the sailors who’d been forced into slavery.\n\nWould you believe during that time American merchants had to buy insurance for their ships sailing the Mediterranean? Or that they paid 20 times the rate of European merchants? But there was no choice. Our new country was deep in debt from the Revolution, and it needed the trade from southern Europe. American merchants no longer had British protection. Even King George III paid tribute to the Barbary states.\n\nThis is a modern map of the Barbary states. Their boundaries may have changed, but their names haven't. Can you find, east to west, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya?\n\nIn May of 1800, William Bainbridge was given command of the USS George Washington, one of the first ships in the American navy. It was carrying a few of the things promised in the treaty, but the gold and silver was delayed. Bainbridge knew that meant trouble, but he had no idea.\n\nWhen its ruler, the ‘Dey’ didn’t get it, he decided the ship should carry his ambassador and entourage across the Mediterranean to Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman empire. (Now known as Istanbul, Turkey.) He wanted the Americans to deliver his own yearly tribute.\n\nBainbridge let an Algerian pilot take him to the dock, and he parked the USS George Washington right under the fortress guns. BIG Mistake! Bainbridge didn’t realize until he was ready to leave. He couldn’t – unless – he did what the ruler wanted – sail everyone to Constantinople – the ambassador, 100 attendants, 100 captive Africans (AKA slaves). Plus, gifts that included 4 horses, 25 cows, 150 sheep, 4 lions, 4 tigers, 4 antelopes, and 12 parrots.\n\n​\n\nBut the final blow – the ‘Dey’ ordered the American flag taken down, and the Algerian one put up. The ship’s 7 guns had to fire a salute to the new flag. Bainbridge thought it was the worst thing ever. That it would never be forgotten. Turns out it was, and the worst was yet to come, ​, and it didn't stop.\n\n​\n\n​It was now July of 1803, and Bainbridge was commanding the USS Philadelphia. When he was chasing an Algerian cruiser, he struck some rocks, leaving his ship dead in the water. Bainbridge would surrender the ship and his crew.\n\nThen it got WORSE. A storm came up and swept the Philadelphia free. The Algerians controlled the ship and forced their slaves, the American crew to fix their own ship. To arm it with their own cannons. Later the Algerians planned to turn them on our navy.\n\nBut Bainbridge had the last laugh – he was still a hostage, but he managed to send intelligence to the American Navy in the Mediterranean. They found a way to destroy the Philadelphia. Yes, they lost a ship, but they kept the Algerians from using it against them.\n\nThe last chapters are about how the Americans almost toppled the Bashaw (the Dey’s boss). They couldn’t because an American diplomat negotiated a treaty in 1805 that undercut our fighting forces. It paid a tribute for the return of our sailors, but it ended the war. It made the seas free for merchant ships again, and captives would be treated like prisoners of war, not as slaves. President Jefferson was satisfied to see an end to the conflict.\n\nBut the piracy finally ended after the War of 1812. The Navy returned to Tripoli in 1815. American ships and their guns made it clear the days of piracy were over. A treaty was signed, and the US didn’t pay a dime of tribute. This time the Barbary States paid restitution to the Americans.\n\n​\n\nDon’t forget to check out the back matter. It’s all about each historical event and the men who shaped them.\n\n​\n\nAmazon’s Description:\n\nThis is the little-known story of how a newly indepen­dent nation was challenged by four Muslim powers and what happened when America’s third president decided to stand up to intimidation.\n\nWhen Thomas Jefferson became president in 1801, America faced a crisis. The new nation was deeply in debt and needed its economy to grow quickly, but its merchant ships were under attack. Pirates from North Africa’s Barbary coast routinely captured American sailors and held them as slaves, demanding ransom and tribute payments far beyond what the new coun­try could afford.\n\nOver the previous fifteen years, as a diplomat and then as secretary of state, Jefferson had tried to work with the Barbary states (Tripoli, Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco). Unfortunately, he found it impossible to negotiate with people who believed their religion jus­tified the plunder and enslavement of non-Muslims. These rogue states would show no mercy—at least not while easy money could be made by extorting the Western powers. So President Jefferson decided to move beyond diplomacy. He sent the U.S. Navy’s new warships and a detachment of Marines to blockade Tripoli—launching the Barbary Wars and beginning America’s journey toward future superpower status.\n\nAs they did in their previous bestseller, George Washington’s Secret Six, Kilmeade and Yaeger have transformed a nearly forgotten slice of history into a dramatic story that will keep you turning the pages to find out what happens next. Among the many sus­penseful episodes:\n\n·Lieutenant Andrew Sterett’s ferocious cannon battle on the high seas against the treacherous pirate ship Tripoli.\n\n·Lieutenant Stephen Decatur’s daring night raid of an enemy harbor, with the aim of destroying an American ship that had fallen into the pirates’ hands.\n\n·General William Eaton’s unprecedented five-hundred-mile land march from Egypt to the port of Derne, where the Marines launched a surprise attack and an American flag was raised in victory on foreign soil for the first time.\n\nFew today remember these men and other heroes who inspired the Marine Corps hymn: “From the Halls of Montezuma to the Shores of Tripoli, we fight our country’s battles in the air, on land and sea.” Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates recaptures this forgot­ten war that changed American history with a real-life drama of intrigue, bravery, and battle on the high seas\n\nFinished June 24, 2024\n\n​Neferura is the plus one in this series. She’s not related to Jagger Jones, but they’re written by the same author . . . who happens to be an Egyptologist.\n\nThere aren’t many stories of ancient Egypt, and this one is fascinating. Travel back to a world 1400 to 1500 years before Christ when the pyramids were built. The author paints a picture of Neferura’s life. From the food she ate, to her clothing, to her job as priestess.\n\nAdd in political drama as Neferura battles the intrigues of her mother and half-brother. They’re fighting for wealth and power, and they don’t care who lives, or dies. The main characters are real. The author took the plot points from their lives and connected them into a novel.\n\n​\n\nWhen I read historical fiction, I always wonder what’s true and what’s made up. This is a statue from the British Museum. The man is Senenmut, and he’s holding Princess Neferura. They’re both in this book, and they both lived in Ancient Egypt.\n\nThe real Neferura was the daughter of two pharaohs. Her mother, Hatshepsut. Her father, Thutmose II. She didn’t become pharaoh, but she had some great opportunities.\n\nThe back matter said Neferura was the wife of the god Amun. Her mother and grandmother were too. Her grandmother, Ahmose-Nefertari, is long dead, but her influence isn’t. It’s the spark that sets the plot in motion.\n\nThe story focuses on how and why Neferura might have married her half-brother, Thutmose III. There’s no record of it, but there’s research that points that way. It centers on the fight to be in charge. In other words, politics as usual.\n\nSenenmut is also in the novel. His first job, ‘Steward of the God’s Wife.’ That’s Hatshepsut. She fights to become pharaoh in her own right. Senenmet’s next job, ‘Steward of the King’s Daughter. That’s Neferura. In the novel he’s her tutor and art patron, and he did have multiple statues made with a young Neferura.\n\nSources: Neferure - Wikipedia & Senenmut - Wikipedia\n\n​\n\n​Meet Neferura’s mother, AKA Hatshepsut. She was an incredible woman in any age, but she ruled during her lifetime.\n\n​She was the Great Royal Wife of Thutmose II, her half-brother. She went on to become regent when he died. Thutmose III was two years old, too young to rule. Eventually Hatshepsut made herself Pharoah. She wasn’t the first, but she was the most successful. When Thutmose came of age, they became equal pharaohs. I bet that went over well. NOT!\n\nThe most unusual thing about Hatshepsut is that she’s a woman and a man in statues. That’s strange, but Neferura’s author said pharaohs are Horus the god, come to earth. No wonder she gave herself a beard. People will do almost anything to gain power, then to hold onto it.\n\nAfter she died, her statues were destroyed. Her monuments vandalized, and her achievements given away to other pharoahs. That was 20 years after her death, and Thutmose III was pharoah for most of that time. You’d think he would have done it sooner.\n\n​\n\nHistorians still wonder who did it and why. Was it Thutmose or his son Amenhotep II? Was it for ritual/religious reasons or hate? Either way, it didn’t work. Hatshepsut was the longest female ruler in Egypt, and, the most successful.\n\nSource: Hatshepsut - Wikipedia\n\n​\n\nMeet Thutmose III. Hapshepsut was his stepmother, and aunt at the same time. In this story he’s positively evil, but deservedly so. That’s because Hapshepsut sent him off to the army as soon as she could get rid of him, and if he died, so much the better. But it is true –Thutmose really was the commander of Hapshepsut’s army.\n\n​\n\nIt’s also true that Thutmose had a Royal Wife named Satiah. She’s in the story, and her son was Thutmose’s first son and heir, Amenemhat. He died young and never got to become pharaoh.\n\n​\n\nLink: Thutmose III - Wikipedia\n\n​\n\nAnd the last major character is Satiah. She didn’t get a statue, but she’s on a painting in Thutmose’s tomb. Her father may/may not have been Ahmose Pen-Hekhebet, who has a minor role in this novel. And her son was Amenemhat. Some sources say he was Neferura’s son.\n\nThis is that painting, from the tomb. On the top half, Thutmose III is in a boat with his mother, Iset.\n\nIn the bottom half, start on the right. You’ll see Thutmose as a child with his mother represented as a tree. Behind them Thutmose is leading a family procession. Next in line is the King’s Wife, Meritre-Hatshepsut. Her son became the next pharaoh. Satiah comes next as a King’s Wife because her son died before he could become pharaoh. The third queen is another King’s Wife, Nebtu, and last in line is the King’s Daughter, Nefertari.\n\nLink: Satiah - Wikipedia\n\n​\n\nAmazon’s Description:\n\nThere are many paths to power. They all come with a price.\n\nNeferura, princess and high priestess of Kemet, knows her duty is to her people. When your mother is the great Pharaoh, it is hard to forget. But Neferura's unique position at court comes with high stakes for her country, especially when she's forced to serve her vile half-brother, a man determined to stop Neferura's potential rise.\n\nPeace, it seems, never lasts for women who wield power in the open. Especially when they cross a vengeful man.\n\n​\n\nWhen Neferura overhears Thutmose's plot to end her mother's rule, she knows he must be stopped, no matter the cost. The discovery of a mysterious tattooed wisewoman and her shadowy network of spies offers an uneasy alliance. But the wisewoman wields more power than Neferura knew possible -- power with the potential to rival her own. Neferura must decide where her loyalties lie and how much she's willing to sacrifice to protect the people she loves before everything crumbles at the hands of a tyrant.\n\nThis post was born when Jazmin Regist emailed and asked if I’d share a pair of links with you. I took one look and said absolutely! I also asked if I could let you peek at the site, and she said absolutely too!\n\n​\n\nLink: https://www.consumernotice.org/products/child-safety/babyproofing/\n\nLink: https://www.consumernotice.org/products/child-safety/\n\nI focused on the first link with its 9 places to babyproof. You’ll have to check out the second link for more child safety tips, but Consumer Notice has so much great information that Jazmin sent the link to their home page to help you find it. That link: consumernotice.org\n\n​\n\n​#1. Sleep: Did you know new babies sleep 16 hours a day? Or 14 the rest of that first year? Picking the right crib is HUGE for babyproofing your house. Take a look at these two cribs. Which is safer. Do you know why?\n\nIt’s the 2nd, with nothing inside the crib except a sheet. Forget the bumper pads and pillows and lovies.\n\nBaby is better with just a sheet and a pacifier. BTW – Did you know sleeping with a pacifier reduces the risk of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome)?\n\nClick on the link to learn how to pick the safest crib, and find 6 tips to reduce the risk of SIDS.\n\nLink: https://www.consumernotice.org/products/child-safety/babyproofing/\n\n​\n\n​#2. Furniture: Did you know every 30 minutes a TV or piece of furniture tips over and injures a child? Or that every 10 days a child dies from that injury? Take a look at this baby’s bedroom. Do you know which two pieces of furniture are the most dangerous? Think ‘tippable.’\n\n​It’s the little table and the big chest of drawers. When kids see something interesting, they’ll try to get it. Consumer Notice.org said they’ll even pull out dresser drawers to make their own ladder. Kids ARE creative! The best solution – clear the clutter and save your child from temptation.\n\nAnother danger – unanchored TVs that fall off dressers. Would you believe they can hit with 10 times the force of two NFL lineman running into each other? YIKES! Don’t take a chance – when in doubt, anchor that TV or anything else that could tip over and land on your child.\n\nClick on the link and scan past cribs to find 5 tip-over prevention ideas. If you keep going, you’ll see the next one, on falls. Link: https://www.consumernotice.org/products/child-safety/babyproofing/\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​#3.Falls: Did you know falls are the leading cause of death for children and young adults? They’re at the top for injuries too. I was surprised that over 2.8 million children wind up in the emergency room every year after a fall. AND that falls cause more than half of the nonfatal injuries for babies who haven’t had a birthday yet. So what are the dangerous areas you should baby/childproof in your house?\n\n​Stairs – I have them and a grandson who just learned to crawl. We need a gate to keep him safe.\n\nBut that’s not all – think changing tables, highchairs, beds, and couches. Basically, anyplace that’s high☹ The best safety tip – keep an eye on those toddlers! It’s amazing how fast they can get themselves into danger.\n\nDon’t forget your favorite senior citizen! Did you know that falls are dangerous for them too? If your grandma or grandpa falls 3 times within 6-8 weeks, they’re in danger. The best tip for any age – secure rugs and wires, and keep clutter off the floor.\n\nHere’s that link again. Just keep scanning until you find the 7 safety tips for falling.\n\nLink: https://www.consumernotice.org/products/child-safety/babyproofing/\n\n​#4. Windows: Did you know about 5200 children fall out the window every year, or that kids under 4 are more likely to have head injuries, be hospitalized, and die than their older siblings? So what can you do to make your windows safer?\n\nMake sure your windows have either stops or guards. Stops keep the windows shut or let them open only a few inches. Guards let the windows open, but they won’t let your child fall out.\n\nWatch out for blinds for babies and young kids. They can get tangled up in the cords. Accidents, even death can happen if kids are left alone in a room to sleep, play or watch TV with cords nearby. Check out the link below. Scan down to find 3 tips on how to handle those cords. The next set of tips focus on electrical outlets. Link: https://www.consumernotice.org/products/child-safety/babyproofing/\n\n​#5. Electricity: Think outlets. I have a grandson who’s fascinated with them. Did you know about 2400 kids get severe shocks or burns from sticking things into them or from biting cords? Or that about 12 children a year die from electricity? It’s so sad when there’s a simple way to fix the problem.\n\nThe solution – head to the hardware store/department for outlet caps and covers, but keep your eye on your child. Would you believe kids can even pull out tamper-resistant ones? Check the link for 3 more tips to protect your child from electricity.\n\n​\n\nLink: https://www.consumernotice.org/products/child-safety/babyproofing/\n\n​\n\n​#6. Choking: Have you ever noticed babies love to stick things in their mouths? Food, toys, anything that fits, but it’s risky – they could choke.\n\n​\n\nIf you have a guest who’s not yet one, don’t let them have: hot dogs, chunks of meat, grapes, peanut butter, popcorn, hard candies, marshmallows and gummies. It’s a long list, but it’s not complete – some raw fruits and vegetables can cause problems too.\n\nDid you know something as tiny as ground cinnamon can make babies choke? When they inhale the powder, they stop breathing. No wonder baby food is so plain.\n\nConsumer Notice didn’t have any tips, but I recommend constant vigilance. I’m always watching my grandboy and what he’s putting in his mouth.\n\nBabies aren’t the only ones who can choke. If you see someone with hands on their throat, they’re choking. (It’s the international symbol.) I hope someone nearby knows the Heimlich Maneuver. It could save a life.\n\nLink for more Information: https://www.consumernotice.org/products/child-safety/babyproofing/\n\n​\n\n​7. Batteries/Magnets: Did you ever think they could be dangerous to babies? I didn’t. Take a guess . . . What makes batteries and magnets super-dangerous for toddlers? Is it choking, or swallowing?\n\nSwallowing! If batteries get stuck in the esophagus on the way down, they can burn through the tissue in 2 short hours. YIKES! If swallowed, babies may need surgery, hopefully without any complications. Would you believe just putting them in an ear or nose is dangerous?! Or that you should rush immediately to the emergency room?\n\nSwallowing magnets can cause trouble too. Imagine them breaking apart inside baby’s body. They will still attract each other. That can rip or tear the intestines and bowels. Babies shouldn’t play with magnets until they’re old enough to use them safely.\n\nAs for batteries in hearing aids, remote controls, even greeting cards, tape their compartments closed with something strong like mailing tape. Even better, buy ones that need a screwdriver to get inside, and never forget – constant vigilance.\n\nThat Link Again: https://www.consumernotice.org/products/child-safety/babyproofing/\n\nNext Up: Water. Poison, and Staying Safe\n\n​\n\n#8. Poison: Did you know more than 300 children are treated every day for accidental poisoning? Or that two of them will die? Two is too many. So how do you protect your kids?\n\nConsumer Notice suggests getting on your hands and knees to look through every room in your house. Anything a child can reach, move it up where they can’t get to it. And even better – lock them up.\n\nHere are a few rooms and the things inside them that are poisonous.\n\n- Kitchen: dishwasher soaps, pods, and powders - Living Room: houseplants\n\n- Bathroom: medications - Garage: car products\n\nDon’t forget recreational drugs, e-cigarettes and their refill cartridges. Did you know liquid nicotine is so concentrated that a small amount swallowed or touching the skin can kill a child? Lock those up too!\n\n​\n\nClick on the link and scan down to read about the poisons you can find at home, plus 4 prevention tips. Link: https://www.consumernotice.org/products/child-safety/babyproofing/\n\n​\n\n#9. Bath Water: Don’t leave babies unattended in the tub, or let an older child watch them. Did you know in the time it takes you to cross the bathroom and grab a towel, they can slip underwater? Or that in the two minutes it takes to answer the phone or text someone back, your child can lose consciousness. Irreversible brain damage can happen in 4-6 minutes, so how do you protect your child in the tub?\n\nGather all your supplies together before you put baby in the tub. If you have to answer the phone or leave for a few seconds, take your baby with you. Constant vigilance!\n\nDon’t forget the water temperature! Keep it under 120 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent burns. You can set your water heater, or put anti-scald devices on faucets and shower heads.\n\nYou can also use spout covers to protect baby’s head. Some even have built in thermometers that will keep that temperature just right.\n\nClick on the link and scan past poisons to find 5 more bath safety tips.\n\nLink: https://www.consumernotice.org/products/child-safety/babyproofing/\n\n​\n\n#10. Pools: Did you know that more than 300 kids under age 5 drown in swimming pools every year, or that 2000 are treated for injuries that happen when they’re underwater? Drowning is the leading cause of accidental death for kids ages 1-4, and 57% of them happen in backyard pools.\n\n​​So how do you protect your child? Fences or safety barriers! They should be at least 4 feet tall with gates that self-close and self- latch. Five feet is even better, and so are pool alarms.\n\nSwimming lessons are great, but it doesn’t make babies and toddlers safe. Life jackets do. Swimming with an adult around will too.\n\nThe Link for more Information:\n\nhttps://www.consumernotice.org/products/child-safety/babyproofing/\n\nIf you’d like to read more about safety barriers, click on this link Consumer Notice and CPSC shared.\n\nLink: pool safety guidelines\n\n​ Finished Memorial Day Weekend\n\nThis isn’t really part of the House of Oak series, but it could be. I met Belle Heartstone in Book 3. She was once engaged to Timothy, Viscount Linwood. Then Jasmine Fleury arrived and saved them from a match neither one wanted. Belle is also distantly related to Sebastion Carew from Book 2, so she really could be part of the series.\n\nBelle’s story begins a year after her broken engagement. She’s determined to choose her own husband, and she picks Colin Radcliffe, the new Marquess of Blake, after much research. He turns her down, saying they both deserve to marry someone they know and respect. He even suggests the unbelievable – that she doesn’t need to marry.\n\n​\n\nThat sets the stage for an unusual relationship – they become business partners. Belle starts the partnership – anonymously. It’s the beginning of an unexpected friendship. You’ll have to read to find out how the adventure ends, and her identity is uncovered.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nSome of My Favorite Parts:\n\n1. The Riddles – Belle and Colin conduct business through letters, from England to India, and back again. Each letter ends with a riddle. Don’t worry, if you don’t see the answer. You’ll find it in the Author’s Notes.\n\n2. Occam’s Razor – Have you heard of it? Colin had. He knew the simplest solution to a problem was probably correct. It helped him figure out Belle’s identity.\n\n3. Belle’s best line – “She really needed to reassess how much bad literature she consumed.” It cracked me up!\n\n4. Colin’s best action – “Colin slashed another dandelion with his walking stick . . .” When you have to take a whack at a dandelion, you know you’re having a bad day.\n\n​\n\n5. “The unexamined life is not worth living.” – The quote came from Socrates who chose death over losing intellectual debate. Colin wants it on his tombstone – he believes in being brutally honest, even with himself.\n\n6. Marriage – When Belle married during the Regency period, she lost her rights to a husband. Her money and her very freedom belonged to him. Choosing well – critical!\n\n7. “Seeing someone” – Both Belle and Colin think they really know each other, but they need to refocus to see each other down to the core.\n\n8. Belle’s initials “LHF” – In the beginning they stand for ‘Little Heart Full.” But by the end they’ve changed to something better, a gift Colin unknowingly gave her.\n\n​Amazon’s Description:\n\nMiss Belle Heartstone—heiress and savvy businesswoman—needs a husband. Immediately. As in, yesterday would not have been soon enough. Her mother’s attempts at matchmaking have been disastrous. So Belle decides to solve the problem her way—survey the market and purchase the best groom available.\n\nColin Radcliffe, Marquess of Blake—debt-ridden and penniless—needs a large infusion of cash. Desperately. Preferably cash that does not come with a wife attached. It is no surprise, then, when he receives Miss Heartstone’s brazen proposal—her cash, his title, their marriage—that he politely declines.\n\nBut before he leaves her, Blake suggests something truly radical: Maybe before finding a husband, Belle should find herself.\n\nHis simple words send them both on an unexpected journey, spanning continents and years, entwining their lives in ways neither could have foreseen. Can two lonely souls move past societal expectations and forge a unique life together?\n\nPlease note: The basic storyline of Seeing Miss Heartstone was originally published as a novella titled, An Invisible Heiress, in the Spring in Hyde Park anthology. This current novel is a greatly expanded version of that plot, adding over 200 pages of text and creating a more robust, well-developed story.\n\n​\n\nFinished Late April\n\n​\n\nDo many books come into being because readers ask? Not many, but this one did because they wanted a happy ending for Daniel Ashton. It came years after Book 4. Perhaps Nichole needed that time to come up with a character and a problem to fit the time portal.\n\nThe female lead – Fossi Lovejoy. What a great name! Fossi is unusual – she’s a genius at math, but her family thinks she’s just plain odd. Her value must equal whatever they put into keeping her alive. Ouch! Can you imagine your family saying that? Double Ouch!\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFossi tells the story, even though Daniel appeared in two earlier books. Her name is an Italian verb for something that no longer exists. This line got me – “Wouldst that I had been . . .” Imagine questioning your own being? No wonder Fossi loves math and numbers – They don’t lie, like people do.\n\n​\n\nWe get to know Daniel through Fossi as she watches his actions and tries to understand him. Daniel is a professional plasterer – he’s always trying to patch the walls in his world. He’s also not the only one who can see behind masks and walls. Fossi can, and she wonders if his defenses are shaped like a monolith or more like a maze.\n\n​\n\nI’ve written a lot about character, but nothing on plot. Fossi enters the story to solve a mathematical problem with the portal. It’s key to the story, with a creative twist.\n\n​\n\nI thought Book 5 didn’t have back matter. I’m glad it does! Fourier’s Nemesis is Fossi’s math problem, and I wondered if it was real . . . Well, partially! This is Joseph Fourier. He was a French mathematician/physicist who worked on waves, heat transfer, and vibrations. His work is known as the Fourier Series. And the Nemesis theory – Nichole made it up. Brilliant!\n\n​\n\nAmazon’s Description:\n\nTime is not a river. It is a vast cosmic sea, where each life exists as rippling circles on its surface. Usually, the eternal ocean oscillates in harmony, all lives breathing up and down as one. But something has broken this equilibrium, turning the cosmic ocean into turbulent waters . . .\n\nIn 1828, Daniel Ashton, Lord Whitmoor, faces a problem of epic proportion—an earthquake has caused the time portal in Duir Cottage to stop functioning, disrupting the cosmic ocean and threatening Time itself. He needs a computer to crunch numbers and provide a solution. But with the time portal on the fritz, a computer is two hundred years in the future. So Daniel sets out to find the next best thing—an anonymous mathematical genius of legendary renown.\n\nFossi Lovejoy knows she is too odd, too intelligent, too old and too poor to ever marry. So she busies herself in her father’s ministry and her mathematical equations, choosing to focus on what she has, not what she lacks. But then Lord Whitmoor publishes one of her private theorems, taunting her to respond. Fossi is compelled to action—when you have so little in life, you defend the few things that are yours with ferocious tenacity. Even if it means matching wits with the infamous Lord Whitmoor.\n\nCan two people past their youth find unexpected love? This final installment in the Amazon bestselling House of Oak series can easily be read as a stand-alone book. Check out the other books in the series:\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFinished 3/11/24\n\nIn Book 4, two characters finally take the lead. Timothy, Viscount Linwood was an unlikeable character in the first 3 books. Stiff, with no sense of humor. Now we learn why – he followed 313 rules. I’d be stiff too!\n\nJasmine Fleury was likeable, but barely mentioned in the other 3 books. I knew she was a free spirit, an artist. That she believed souls could find each other across time and space. Sounds like fantasy to me, and this story was a good one!\n\nWhen Timothy comes forward to 2015, it’s Jasmine who discovers his back story. She helps him find himself. And it’s Timothy who helps Jasmine piece the past back together again. They’re a match made only in fantasies.\n\nMy favorite line – trust the process. I do as a writer, and in my own life. And it’s what Jasmine and Timothy do as they find themselves, and each other. Another favorite – you can advise others, but never yourself. So true!\n\nI love back matter, where you find the ideas that shaped the story. Nichole Van researched King Arthur, Druids, foundlings, and English oak trees for this one. Did you know they could live for 1300 years? And that one small fact changed the course of this story!\n\n​\n\n​Amazon’s Description: Each life is tethered to others, tendrils wrapping through time itself . . . drawing people to each other . . .\n\nIn 1815, Timothy, Viscount Linwood--handsome, arrogant, privileged--never veers from the refined rules of his world. Cheerfulness and other unsavory emotions are for lesser persons. Anything that smacks of trade is to be shunned. Honor and pride above all else. Consequently, when he discovers his estates are bankrupt, he decides to woo and marry an heiress post-haste. After all, love is for lesser-mortals. But Fate intervenes and draws him to a vibrant woman who makes him want things he can never have. Can a pompous lord change enough to find redemption?\n\nIn 2015, Jasmine Fleury just wants her happily-ever-after. If only she could stop losing people instead--her grandmother, boyfriends . . . and now her entire family. Worse, she finds herself babysitting a haughty nineteenth century lord who can't even shave himself. What grown man can't shave himself? She has no interest in playing damsel-in-shining-armor to his knight-in-distress. But Fate has other plans . . . .\n\nThis fourth installment in the Amazon bestselling House of Oak series can easily be read as a stand-alone book. Check out the other books in the series.\n\n​\n\nFinished 1/23/24\n\nMeet Book 3 from the House of Oak series. This time the main character is Mark, Emry’s brother. He’s barely mentioned in the other books. My guess – the author saved him for this one.\n\nYou’ll also meet James’ brother, Arthur and his wife, Marianne. They only play supporting roles in the story, sort of like furniture, but Marianne’s brother, Timothy, Viscount Linwood is much more interesting. He’s more than a member of the aristocracy. Read for yourself to find out how.\n\nThe best part of Nichole’s writing is her character development. She introduces two new ones in Book 3. Kit is the female lead, and both she and Mark time travel back to Duir Cottage. The portal has a reason for bringing them together. BTW, Kit is there to find her missing brother Daniel. He has the biggest reason for traveling back to 1814.\n\nI’m usually a big fan of back matter. Nichole had some interesting tidbits, but I really wanted to know more about the spies, the War of 1812, and what was going on with Napoleon in 1814. I did run across a bit in another book because I’m researching the founding fathers, the ones who signed the Declaration, but unfortunately, I’m writing a chapter about someone who died in 1793. Shucks!\n\nBut would I recommend this book? Absolutely! I love a good historical romance, and this one adds in time travel too. I love two-fers!\n\n​\n\nAmazon’s Description:\n\nFate will draw two people together, moving them through centuries if necessary. But even predestined lovers have the choice to walk away . . .\n\nIn 2014, Marc Wilde—martial artist and actor—finds his life a mess. His latest film, Croc-nami, is being trashed on social media, sending his acting career into a tailspin. His love life isn’t doing much better. And then there is the tiny matter of blackmail. Someone knows about the time portal in the cellar of Duir Cottage and is threatening to tell the world unless Marc pays up. So yeah . . . his life is not going so well.\n\nIn 1814, Kit Ashton has problems of her own. Her brother has disappeared (again), leaving Kit penniless and forcing her to take up employment as a lady’s companion (sigh). Worse, there are French spies in the area, and Kit finds herself pulled into the conspiracy. Add in the sudden appearance of a handsome, silver-tongued rogue who makes Kit want to flirt, flirt, flirt . . . it’s the perfect recipe for disaster. Kit is determined to find her brother, return home, and (most importantly) keep her secrets, well, secret.\n\nThis hilarious, quick-paced installment in the Amazon bestselling House of Oak series can easily be read as a stand-alone book.\n\n​\n\nFinished 12/26/23\n\nThis is Book 2 from the House of Oak series. The best part of a series is meeting the characters you already loved. Emry and James were the lead characters in Book 1, and Georgiana had a supporting role. Her starring moment came when Emry had to take her back through the portal to save her life.\n\nIn Book 2, Georgie takes the starring role. She’s cured, but she’s struggling to find her place in the 21st century. THEN the impossible happens . . . she receives a love letter from the past, and she wrote it! As a lover of mysteries, there’s only one thing she can do – time travel back to discover the love of her life, but there’s a twist . . . gooseberries!\n\nWatch whenever they’re mentioned – they’re the key to the plot. In 2013 Georgie’s boyfriend belongs to GLIB – Gooseberry Lovers International Brotherhood. Back in 1813 they figured into the plot too. Sebastian Carew enters the story when he becomes the Earl of Stratton. There’s only one small problem – if he isn’t married by his birthday, he will forfeit 60,000 pounds, and the money will go to 3 gooseberry societies.\n\n​\n\nI’d never heard of gooseberries until I read this book and its back matter. If you’re curious what gooseberries look like, take a look under this paragraph. Gooseberry societies and competitions were a fad in the early 1800’s. If you were a gooseberry back then, you were a lax chaperone who wasn’t keeping an eye on your charge. Gooseberries are still popular in Britain, but now it means you’re the third wheel in a group.\n\n​\n\n​Amazon’s Description:\n\nGeorgiana Knight--born in the nineteenth century, but now living in 2013--has certain standards when it comes to mysteries: they must involve blood curdling threats, late-night rendezvous and the terror of Imminent Danger. So far, her current mystery has been a terrible disappointment. No ghosts, no dastardly villains, not even an actual murder weapon. Just a suspicious symbol, a drawing of a bloody dagger, and an old love letter. Though the centuries-old love letter is written in her own handwriting, so that's something, right? And there is a time portal in her cellar. Should she risk giving up hot showers and return to the past to discover the mysterious stranger who inspired (will inspire?) her passionate letter?\n\nIn 1813, Sebastian Carew has his own mystery to solve. As a teenager, he fell madly in love with his childhood friend, Georgiana. Ten years later, he returns from fighting abroad as an eligible man of fortune who must marry. And soon. He is determined to fend off fortune-hunting women, find Georgiana, and win her affections. However, she has utterly vanished. Can he divine the truth of her disappearance and convince her to marry him before time runs out?\n\nFinished 11/12/23\n\nThis was Nichole’s debut book from February of 2014. I found it in June, and I’ve been reading her work ever since. Intertwine is a time travel novel with Emry coming from 2012, and James from England, 200 years later. It’s a parallel story with the plot moving back and forth between the two characters. I love how she weaves them together.\n\nNichole was an award-winning photographer before she started writing. I think it gave her an edge in picturing her characters and their story. She also uses Pinterest to store photos and notes to use later. I’d never heard of that before.\n\nI finished Nichole’s newest book before I started her first one again. I never noticed her growth as a writer until now. I loved her stories before, but her writing feels richer and deeper. I think it comes from the way she shows her characters’ emotions through their actions. She also uses historical details like furniture and clothing to help you picture the setting.\n\nAmazon’s Description:\n\nOutlander meets Bridgerton in a love story for the ages!\n\nTime is not a river. It is a vast cosmic sea. Where each life exists as rippling circles on its surface, past and future being eternally present. And occasionally, one expanding ring intertwines with that of another, weaving the lives of two people together. . . .\n\nIn 2012, Emme Wilde can’t find the right guy. She wants to feel that swept-off-your-feet dizziness of true love. But so far, her dating life has come up short. Star Trek geek? Nice but too serious. Hippy artist? Cute but too vulnerable. Instead, Emme obsesses over the portrait of an unknown man in an old locket. Granted, a seriously dreamy guy with delicious, wind-swept hair she just itches to run her fingers through. But still. Dead men may be great listeners, but they are not exactly boyfriend material. Emme travels to England, determined to uncover his history and conquer the strong connection she feels.\n\nIn 1812, James Knight has given up finding the right woman. All he wants is someone to share his love of adventure. Instead, his life has become a Shakespearean drama. His brother languishes in a tragic star-crossed romance. His beloved sister clings to life, slowly dying of consumption. But then he finds a beautiful mystery woman, dripping wet and half-dead, beneath a tree on his estate. Now if he can uncover her history, perhaps adventure—and romance—will find him at last.\n\nAre fingers digits? They’re actually synonyms, even if we usually think of digits as numbers.\n\nSo take a look at yours and get ready for a few trivia questions.\n\n1. What’s the name of your smallest digit?\n\nRing finger Index finger Thumb Pinky finger\n\n2. Where did it come from?\n\nEngland France Netherlands Germany\n\n​And the answers are . . . ​\n\n1. The Pinky is your smallest digit.\n\n2. It’s a Dutch word from the Netherlands.\n\n​\n\n​Your pinky has a few other names, like little finger, baby finger, and fifth digit. Did you know it takes nine muscles to move it, or that most people can only bend it if they bend their fourth finger too?\n\n​\n\nThe word pinkie comes from the Dutch word for pink. It means little finger, not color. It was first used in Scotland in 1808. It may be a Dutch word, but it’s used in English speaking countries like the US, the UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.\n\nPinkies are used in different ways in different places. American kids pinky swear and make pinky promises. In England in the 1800s people used to hold out their pinky to drink tea, but now most people don’t. If you wear a ring on your pinky, it’s called a signet ring. Engineers in Canada and the US wear iron or stainless-steel rings on their pinkies. Who knew?\n\n​\n\nAnd now, another digit. Good luck!\n\n3. Which digit looks different from the other four? It acts differently too.\n\nRing finger Index finger Thumb Pinky finger\n\n4. Do other animals have a digit like this?\n\nYes No\n\nAnd the answers are . . .\n\n​3. The digit that’s different – your thumb.\n\n4. And yes, other animals have opposable thumbs like we do. Most of them are primates.\n\n​\n\nA thumb is the first digit of your hand. 😊 In Latin it’s called a pollex. I didn’t think the thumb was a finger, but one definition says the hand has five digits, so the thumb counts. Another one says there are only four digits, so the thumb doesn’t. It’s up to you – you can call your thumb a finger, or a plain old thumb.\n\nYour thumb is like the other fingers because it has joints that bend, and it has hair, a nail, and a palm without hair. Personal note – my fingers don’t have hair, but my husband’s do.\n\n​\n\nA thumb is different because it’s opposable to the other fingers, so it can touch each finger on your hand. It has two bending points, not three like the others. The thumb curls horizontally/across the hand, and the other fingers curl vertically/up and down.\n\n​​\n\nSome primates have opposable thumbs like Old World monkeys and great apes. Some have opposable thumbs that are a little longer, like gibbons and lesser apes.\n\nLemurs, pottos, lorises, capuchin and squirrel monkeys have pseudo-opposable thumbs. That means they’re almost opposable, but not quite. Tarsiers and marmosets have thumbs, but they’re not opposable. As for the spider monkey and the colobus, they’re thumb-less. Poor things!\n\nOther animals have thumbs too. Giant Pandas have a finger, that’s not a true finger, but it works like our thumb. Opossums have them on their hind feet, and most birds have at least one opposable toe on their foot. But those are toes, NOT thumbs.\n\nSources:\n\nThumb - Wikipedia\n\n​And now, another digit. Here’s to good luck, or pure skill 😉\n\n​\n\n5. Which digit points things out?\n\nRing finger Index finger Thumb Pinky finger\n\n6. How many names does it have?\n\n6 7 8 9\n\nAnd the answers are . . .\n\n​\n\n5. The pointing digit is known as your index finger.\n\n6. My source gave me eight, including index finger.\n\n​​\n\nHere are all eight names – index finger, forefinger, first finger (if you don’t count the thumb), second finger, pointer finger, trigger finger, digitus secondus, digitus II.\n\n​\n\nDon’t get confused. Your index finger is the one between your thumb and middle finger. Did you know it’s usually the most agile and sensitive finger? As a pianist, it was one of my best fingers, but I didn’t know it was sensitive too.\n\n​\n\nYour index finger is SO useful! Hold it up, and you’re number 1, in most places. Some, use their thumbs instead. If you move it up and down in the #1 position, it’s called finger-wagging. I use mine to warn someone to stop, usually a kid, and they usually do.\n\n​\n\nYou can also point with your index finger, and babies around age 1 begin pointing too. Did you know some animals like dogs and elephants understand and respond to pointing? Or that in some places in Southeast Asia like Malaysia and Indonesia, they think it’s rude? They still point, but they use their thumb instead.\n\n​Sources:\n\nIndex finger - Wikipedia\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​​And now, another digit. May the force be with you 😉\n\n7. Which digit wears jewelry first?\n\nRing finger Index finger Thumb Pinky finger\n\n8. Where should you wear it?\n\nRight hand Left hand\n\n​\n\nAnd the answers are . . .\n\n7. The ring finger wears jewelry first, like engagement and wedding rings.\n\n8. The hand it’s on depends on where you live, and your religion.\n\nI thought it was always worn on the left hand until I went to Germany. Theirs goes on the right.\n\nThe ring finger has four other names – the third or fourth finger, depending on whether the thumb counts or not. It’s also called the annulary finger, which means ring finger too. The fourth, the leech finger.\n\n​​\n\nIt doesn’t have anything to do with the leech that drinks blood. It’s about what people once believed about the circulatory system. People thought a vein ran from the ring finger to the heart, so they started wearing engagement and wedding rings there to declare their love for each other.\n\n​\n\nThe wedding ring is usually worn on the left hand if you live in the British Commonwealth, parts of Europe, and in Catholic Mexico, Bolivia, and Chili. In Europe that includes France, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, and by Catholics in the Netherlands. In Spain the regions that speak Catalan use their left hands. Can you find them on the map?\n\n​\n\nThe ring goes on the right hand in some Orthodox countries, a few Catholic European ones, some Central and South American Catholic countries, and in Protestant Western Europe. In Eastern Europe, that includes Belarus, Bulgaria, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine. In Central/Western Europe that’s Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Norway, and by Protestants in the Netherlands. In Spain, the regions that speak Spanish use their right hands. In Central/South America it also includes Columbia, Cuba, Peru, and Venezuela. Can you find them on the map?\n\n​\n\n​In countries like Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Romania, and Brazil, they wear their ring on the right hand until the wedding. Then they move it to the left. They're on the map too.\n\nIn Islamic countries, wedding rings aren’t part of the ceremony. If you wear one, the hand you choose depends on where you live. In Iran, you use your left hand. In Jordan, the right. But now engagement rings are in style in the Muslim world. They’re worn on the ring finger of either hand by both men and women. Wow, men wearing engagement rings, so cool!\n\nIn Jewish weddings it depends on the custom. For traditional ones, the ring goes on the index finger of the bride’s right hand. Other traditions put it on the middle finger or the thumb. Today the wedding ring is moved to the ring finger of the left hand after the service. Some Jewish men wear wedding rings, but most Orthodox men don’t.\n\n​\n\nIn India, rings aren’t one of their traditions, but as customs change, more people are buying a ring for the engagement and for the marriage. Men wear rings on the right hand, and women on the left.\n\n​\n\n​Sources:\n\nRing finger - Wikipedia\n\n​\n\n​​ Finally the last digit 😊\n\n9. Which digit is missing?\n\nRing finger Index finger Thumb Pinky finger\n\n​\n\n10. What sound can it make with your thumb?\n\nClap Snap Click\n\n​\n\nAnd the answers are . . .\n\n9. The middle finger is the one that’s missing.\n\n​\n\n10. Slide your thumb and middle finger together and listen for that click.\n\n​​The middle finger has other names – long finger, toll finger, and tall man. It’s your second or third finger, depending on whether or not you count your thumb.\n\n​\n\nI never really thought about it, but your middle finger is the only one that makes a sound. None of the others do. I double checked 😊\n\n​\n\n​Your middle finger is also the only one that can insult or offend someone. You might give them the finger, flip the bird, or flip someone off, but it’s nothing new. Did you know using the middle finger can be traced back to ancient Greece and Rome? Some things are timeless."
