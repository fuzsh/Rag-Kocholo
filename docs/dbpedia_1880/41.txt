On May 7, 2004, the Department of Defense announced that Secretary of the Navy Gordon England had decided that DDG hull number 104 will be named Sterett. USS STERETT DDG-104 commissioned on 09 AUG 2008 [rather than in November 2007 as earlier planned] at 7:00 pm at the South Locust Point Marine Terminal in Baltimore, Maryland. Cmdr. Brian P. Eckerle of Jasper, Ind., will become the first commanding officer of the ship and will lead the crew of 276 officers and enlisted personnel. The 9,200-ton Sterett was built by Bath Iron Works, a General Dynamics company, and will be homeported in San Diego, Calif.

Sterett is a Flight IIA variant of the Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer and incorporates a helicopter hanger facility into the original design. The ship can each carry two SH-60B/R helicopters. Guided missile destroyers operate independently and in conjunction with carrier strike groups, surface action groups, expeditionary strike groups and replenishment groups.

Three previous ships have carried this name: DD 27, DD 407 and CG 31.

Andrew Sterett

DDG 104 honors Andrew Sterett (1760-1807), appointed lieutenant in the United States Navy in 1798 and assigned to Constellation as Third Lieutenant. During the Quasi-War with France, he served with Capt. Thomas Truxton onboard Constellation, capturing the French frigate L'Insurgente in 1799. By 1800, he had risen to first lieutenant. He was soon given command of the schooner Enterprise. In June 1801, he sailed Enterprise from Baltimore to serve with the Mediterranean Squadron and captured a 14-gun Tripolitan cruiser and her 80-man crew during the Barbary Wars. Sterett continued his Navy career until he resigned his commission in 1805.
