THE WJIES AS WE (20 Aim' A Christmas Overture In Ballet Senate Sef-Up /s GeWmg Worse To represent, in the political sense, means to respect the wishes and consider the welfare of one's constituents. One's constituents are those who elect the representatives. Therefore, the idea held by some stu- dent senators that dormitory representa- tion will be effected by having senators living in residence units while not being elected from them is false. A representative is subject to the vote of those who are represented. Some sen- ators envisioned last year, and some still believe, that senators will perform their duty if elected by the creaking, over-bur- dened. Greek-laden class system so lone as they live in the groups that should be represented. We don't want to cast aspersions on student senators in ijeneral. Still, the greater number have seldom had the relationship of proximity as a basis for knowing what the dorm students think and want There Is no fact on which to base the idea they would be any more Interested were their place of residence restricted after election. If dormitories could elect senators to {•present them on the basis of the stu- dent's record and recall them if they dis- regard the meaning of the word repre- sentation, well, we imagine student sen- ate would be a bit different For one thing, it would have student support. Second, it would create enough stu- dent interest to increase the disgustingly low election turnout. Third, it would sound all student com- plaints and opinions. The legislative body now samples what the few conscientious senators bring in. Lastlv, it would reduce the number of seats that now go to the highest bidder in a plain-and-simple popularity contest. The Florida FlamlMau submits that Student Senate cannot lay a claim to po- litical maturity unlets it is deeted re- sponsibly. Dormitory representation in- cludes Greek living-unit represent.-.'.ion. and further provision can be made for day students and married students. Workable plans have been submitted and there has been ample opportunity to compromise: ye: some of tiioce whom '.kp must regretfully term deadwood continue to make progress an impossibility.

Hardly anyone knew that considera- tion of seniors had been going on. Many aeniors are now asking why their dags was' not permitted to vote, aa in past years. In defense of the appointment of a committee of juniors to malte the selec- tion as well as nomination, it has been argued that senior classes — last year's for example — have never bothered to vote. The fact is that httle advance notice was issued of last year's Senior Class meeting on nominations, but we can pass over this to an even more pertinent reali- zation. If seniors have, as it is alleged, always Ignored voting on candidates for this pub- lication, their disinterest has been a defi- nite indication on their part that it is not the honor it's supposed to be. They seem aware that Who's Who AaMog Stndanta in AsMricaa Ualvanitlas aad CoUoges is run as a profit-making enterprise: the company's main aim is to sell their book. This takes quite a lot out of whatever \"honor\" there ia in the selection. A former Florida Flamboan editor, chosen for the publication, wrote the com- pany that he didn't wish his name in- cluded, considering it \"next to nothinf as an honor.\" This is indeed a strong Indictment. No doubt there are many schools that take the publication seriou.sly. Even at FSU most of the people chosen deserve recog- nition for outstanding achievement. An equal number who are not nomi- nated deserve recognition. Invariably, whether by cla.s.s or committee choice, some element of popularity and politics has bearing upon the result. We do not think that FSU Student Government should patronize and co- operate with a so-called \"honorary\" that is primarily profit-bent. Nor do we think the cabinet should have taken it upon it- self to hand over to any committee, no matter how competent, the powers of se- lection. It IS. of course, too late and very inadvisable to criticize the committee for instances where some may feel poor judgment was exercised. We can only emphasize that the sidu- tion to the muddle is to forget about \"who's who\" entirely.

Well over 300 students were turned sway from the d.wrs, some over an hour before the game started, because ihev weren't faculty members or townspeople with \"paid-for\" tickets. Righteously in- dignant, the students waved their activity books (at a cost ot $75 per) in the nose el the ticket guard at the door and asked lum if they were not \"paid for,'' This editor watched a faculty member and S friends enter w iin-iut ::c'Kel.s, wi'.h- eu' ar- •. •■ K-;. '.vhile :he cuard held the i- r.s I'lcked to students. Fmaliy, 15 students were admitted; each counted as though he were the worst thing to have at a basketball game. Inside, we could see that half the gym was ahnost full and the other half almost empty, marked \"Reserved.\" There's a rotten apple in the barrel somewhere when students pay for a sea- son's games in advance and have their seats sold a second time to townspersons. One section, we could understand, bu! half the gym, no. Surely 5,1)00 ac'.iv.',v books paid the cost of the use of the gym and then some. 'We suggest the Athletic Office limit the sales of tickets in town immediately, realizing that some $.500 students have every legal right to enter the game or have part of their activity fee refunded. If they don't, we wouldn't be surin'ised to find the students angry enough io riot at the doors of the next game.
