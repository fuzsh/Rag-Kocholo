        "text": "New Delhi: Pro-RSS and Bhraminical slogans targeting Dalits have appeared in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), one of India’s premier educational institutions.\n\nAccording to Kashmir Media Service, the casteist and communal slogans, which included “Chamar Bharat Chhodo,” “Dalit Bharat Chhodo,” “Brahmin-Bania Zindabad,” and “Hindu-RSS Zindabad,” were displayed on the walls of Kaveri Hostel. The incident has sparked significant unrest among students, leading to swift condemnation.\n\nKunal Kumar, General Secretary of the National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) at JNU, expressed deep concern over the incident. He questioned, “The slogans have been erased from the wall, but how will we remove them from the minds of such people?” Kumar attributed the emboldening of such discriminatory ideologies to the current political climate under the BJP government, stressing that this incident should not be seen in isolation.\n\nJNUSU President Dhananjay also condemned the act, asserting, “The same forces that are in power in the country are also present on the JNU campus. These forces are constantly running their agenda against Dalits, Adivasis, Bahujans, Muslims, and women. We will keep fighting these forces to ensure JNU remains a place of equality and parity.”\n\nChetan, a resident of Kaveri Hostel, expressed his distress over the incident, noting the Brahminical and Manuvadi nature of the slogans and the underlying hatred they reveal. He called for immediate and strict action from the administration against those responsible.\n\nAbul Kalam, a member of the Kaveri Hostel committee, stated, “Such incidents vitiate the campus environment and spoil social harmony.”\n\nSwati, a student from Sabarmati Hostel, highlighted that this was not an isolated incident, citing previous occurrences of similar nature on campus, including an ABVP poster proclaiming “We the Brahmins of JNU.”\n\nThis incident is part of a troubling pattern at JNU, where casteist and communal sentiments have occasionally surfaced. Despite the formation of a committee to investigate such incidents, there has been little concrete action."
