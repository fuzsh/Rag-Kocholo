The most exciting tidbit from this news item is the inclusion of Isaac Hayes' soundtrack for the film Shaft into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry. For a blaxploitation soundtrack to receive such a governmental imprimatur is a bit surprising, even if the "Theme from Shaft" topped the singles charts in November 1971 and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1972.

Hayes' sprawling, lush, and occasionally funky double LP is a worthy addition to the Registry, and it's accompanied by Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Fortunate Son," the Everly Brothers' "Cathy's Clown," Art Blakey's A Night at Birdland (Vols. 1 and 2), Elmore James' "Dust My Broom," U2's The Joshua Tree, Jeff Buckley's "Hallelujah," and 18 other recordings from 1896-1994. These works, reads the official statement, "will be preserved as cultural, artistic and/or historical treasures, representing the richness and diversity of the American soundscape."
