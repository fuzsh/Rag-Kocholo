Wireless systems require collaboration by hundreds of organizations worldwide and take years to design, test, and implement. An important part of the development process is computer simulations of proposed network technologies using tools like ns3 (https://www.nsnam.org/). NIST actively works with the ns3 developer community to create new modules that incorporate the latest wireless technologies. The SURF applicant selected to work on this project will help extend the simulation models of the psc-ns3 codebase (https://github.com/usnistgov/psc-ns3) that WND has developed and that researchers use to investigate existing and emerging wireless communication technologies. These include Public Safety Communication (PSC) applications, Fifth Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) Sidelink (SL) communication, Proximity Services (ProSe), and simulation visualization tools (https://github.com/usnistgov/NetSimulyzer). This task involves working with a team of developers to design, implement, document, and test new capabilities in the psc-ns3 codebase, and will primarily involve using the C++ programing language and Linux to implement and run ns-3 simulations.

One area of interest within WND is the evaluation of next generation networks based on open-source solutions compliant with the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Alliance specifications. The selected candidate will work on the performance assessment of Fifth Generation (5G) testbed deployments, and the interaction of individual components within the network, such as the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). The selected candidate will help the team evaluate some of the components and interfaces capabilities and compliance to O-RAN Alliance specifications. In addition, the selected candidate may work on the testbed towards specific features of 5G RAN, such as RAN slicing and resource orchestration.\n\nDesired skills/tools: Linux shell scripting, git, LaTeX, communication skills, writing skills, programming skills, networking tools experience (iperf3, Wireshark), experience with Software Defined Radios (SDR) is preferred but not essential. [In-person opportunity]\n\n673-3 Machine Learning Assisted Radio Frequency Sensing\n\nJack Chuang and Jian Wang, 301-975-4171 and 301-975-8012, jack.chuang [at] nist.gov (jack[dot]chuang[at]nist[dot]gov) and jian.wang [at] nist.gov (jian[dot]wang[at]nist[dot]gov)\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been in the news a lot since the debut of ChatGPT a year ago, because of the power of large language models like it to perform functions previously restricted to humans such as generating prose and writing programs. But AI is a powerful tool that is being used in other areas of science and engineering, including developing the next generation of wireless communications systems. In addition to supporting very high speed and very low latency data transmissions, tomorrow’s wireless networks will also integrate sensing capabilities that can detect the presence of nearby people and objects, such as cars, obstacles, and Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The Wireless Networks Division in the Communications Technology Laboratory at NIST is investigating how to automate sensing so that an Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) system can identify the major features of its environment and adapt to changing conditions. This will involve training AI systems to recognize the signatures of radio waves reflected from nearby objects and distinguish them from background noise. The student will use data collected from NIST’s sensing experiments involving radio waves at the frequencies in the 10s of Gigahertz that will be used by future wireless networks to train AI systems to identify and locate clusters of reflected radio waves and then validate the performance of the AI system that they trained.\n\nDesired Skills: Applied machine learning, MATLAB and/or Python programming languages, Git version control, and strong communication abilities. [In-person opportunity]\n\n673-4 Deployment and Evaluation of Secure Virtualization Environments for 5G O-RANs\n\nDoug Montgomery and Scott Rose, 301-960-3630 and 301-975-8439, dougm [at] nist.gov (dougm[at]nist[dot]gov) and scott.rose [at] nist.gov (scott[dot]rose[at]nist[dot]gov)\n\n5G Open-Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) technologies seek to transform radio access networks from single vendor solutions based upon proprietary appliances to a disaggregated network architecture of components and functions, with standardized open interfaces, and designed to be deployed in virtualized and cloud native environments.\n\nNIST has recently actively engaged in O-RAN Alliance standards development, focusing on enhancing the security of virtualized, cloud native O-RAN functions. This area has both the greatest potential to increase overall network security and the greatest potential risk to the eventual commercial viability of O-RAN technologies. This project will involve enhancing existing 5G O-RAN laboratory testbeds to support emerging security standards, recommendations, and technologies for cloud native virtualization environments (e.g., Kubernetes, OpenShift, etc.), evaluating the ability of existing open-source virtualization environments to support such security requirements, and employing existing open-source tools to actively test the security of virtualized network environments to evaluate and verify secure configurations.\n\nDesired skills / experience: Linux, Kubernetes / Docker, service-based architectures, Python, dev-ops / network programming, network protocols / tools / technologies (http, TLS, PKI, OAUTH, Wireshark), penetration testing concepts and tools. [In-person opportunity]\n\n673-5 Development of a Web Based Test Systems for Internet Security Routing Technologies\n\nDoug Montgomery and Oliver Borchert, 301-960-3630 and 301-975-4856, dougm [at] nist.gov (dougm[at]nist[dot]gov) and oliver.borchert [at] nist.gov (oliver[dot]borchert[at]nist[dot]gov)\n\nNIST is actively involved in the design of standardization of technologies to detect and mitigate “route leaks” in the Internet’s global routing infrastructure. Such route leaks lead to catastrophic outages in large subsets of the Internet that can last for several hours or days. NIST has been instrumental in standardizing a route leak mitigation technique called Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) and has developed stand-alone test tools and reference data sets to test implementations of ASPA in commercial routers. This project will take these initial stand-alone ASPA test tools and implement a web-based front end to evolve the tools into a distributed testing service that enables remote testing and automated results evaluation of remote ASPA implementations.\n\nDesired skills: web front-end development (HTML, CSS, CSS frameworks), Python, Flask, network programming, SQL, Git, Linux, working knowledge of Internet protocols (DNS, BGP). [In-person opportunity]\n\nSmart Connected Systems Division (Div 674)\n\n674-1 easyEXPRESS - NIST’s First Visual Studio Code Extension\n\nAllison Barnard Feeney, 301-975-3181, allison.barnardfeeney [at] nist.gov (allison[dot]barnardfeeney[at]nist[dot]gov)\n\nSTEP (STandard for the Exchange of Product data) is a neutral file format primarily used to move engineering design data between CAD (Computer-Aided Design) systems and from CAD systems to CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) and CAI (Computer-Aided Inspection) systems, eliminating the need for paper drawings and error-prone re-entry of design information into CAM and CAI planning systems. You will be developing new features for an already published Visual Studio Code extension (NIST’s easyEXPRESS) that implements language support for the EXPRESS (ISO 10303-11 ed2) information modeling language that is used in the widely implemented STEP standard.\n\nBillions of STEP files are in use world-wide, and many are freely available on sites like GrabCAD. We are doing our best to build modern tools to support this decades-old, but still used, language. In doing so, we are supporting both standards developers who are adding new capabilities to STEP, and innovators who want to leverage use of the STEP ecosystem to build exciting new products and business models. In this project, you will learn how to develop Visual Studio Code extensions and how to implement a language server.\n\nDesired skills: computer science major or minor, experience with JavaScript/TypeScript, exposure to information modeling is a plus. [In-person or virtual opportunity]\n\n674-2 Industrial Artificial Management and Metrology: Process Simulation Testing and Development\n\nMichael Sharp, 301-975-0476, michael.sharp [at] nist.gov (michael[dot]sharp[at]nist[dot]gov)\n\nThis work will present a student with an opportunity to assist in the testing and development of novel software tools designed to evaluate risks and opportunities for AI tools in an industrial production process.\n\nThis project will focus on evaluating a multistage a production process through both simulated and physical sensing methods. The effort will center on tools for assisting in efforts of digital twin technologies and systems monitoring. The student will work closely under the direction and supervision of software development experts and NIST AI experts to create and test a process simulation for a major government manufacturing center. Experiments and tasks may include, but are not limited to: (a) Implementing an AI driven COTS monitoring system, (b) Developing best practice methods for the design and creation of high-level digital simulators, (c) Determining mechanisms and methods for rapidly executing process redesigns and ‘what if’ scenarios, (d) Creating measures and metrics for capturing the risks and returns of AI driven technologies on an industrial manufacturing process. The goal of this project is to help lower barriers and provide intuitive recommendations for US manufacturers looking to enhance their productivity through AI monitoring, controls, and design technologies.\n\nRequired skills: Python coding and/or significant coding experience; beyond high school level classes in engineering, computer science, or statistics; ability to work with a team. Recommended: good communication skills; writing experience; knowledge of technical risk & reliability for production processes; understanding of basic AI methodologies; AI software packages. [In-person or virtual opportunity]\n\n674-3 P4 Programming for 5G QoS\n\nLotfi Benmohamed, (301) 975-3650, lotfi.benmohamed [at] nist.gov (lotfi[dot]benmohamed[at]nist[dot]gov)\n\nThis project seeks to develop an SDN based solution to classify and prioritize 5G network traffic, using the P4 programming language. We are deploying an experimental 5G network, using both open-source and proprietary components. A major benefit of 5G network is 5G slicing, which allows different types of traffic (e.g., general Internet browsing, remote driving, industrial sensing) to share the same physical network with minimal interference with each other. A requirement for 5G slicing is the enforcement of Quality-of-Service (QoS), so that high priority traffic does not suffer slowdowns due to higher volume of low priority traffic. Unfortunately, the current software 5G implementations do not natively support dataplane QoS. The goal of this project is to explore a potential solution based on using SDN switches to enforce 5G QoS. In particular, a P4 program installed on a physical SDN switch would recognize 5G packet headers, classify each packet into different traffic classes, and enforce QoS through egress queuing and advanced scheduling methods.\n\nThe applicant must have prior experience in P4 programming including how to write a protocol parser and how to perform QoS enforcements, a deep understanding of common network protocols such as IP and UDP, as well as prior knowledge in 5G network and its protocols. Note that packet traces for the relevant protocols will be provided, and the applicant is expected to learn about the protocol structure by reading these packet traces using tools such as Wireshark. [In-person or virtual opportunity]\n\n674-4 Internet of Things (IoT) Device Interoperability\n\nEugene Song, 301-975-6542, ysong [at] nist.gov (ysong[at]nist[dot]gov)\n\nInternet of Things (IoT) devices serve key functions in intelligent transportation systems, such as providing sensed data or data received from external networks to perception systems using sensors and embedded devices (e.g., on-board units, road-side units). However, this data is received from a large diversity of sources, and one major challenge is ensuring interoperability between the different IoT devices and systems that generate, transmit, and use the data. Interoperability is the ability of two or more systems to exchange information and to use the information exchanged based on the standardized communication protocol to achieve the functions and goals. Several interoperability challenges for intelligent transportation systems include diverse cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) connectivity (e.g., 3GPP LTE/4G/5G), diverse proprietary and standardized protocols adopted by different vendors and manufacturers, and diverse use cases and contexts. Interoperability testing, measurement, and assessment methodologies are keys to overcoming these challenges to assure the interoperability of IoT devices.\n\nThis project will focus on developing an interoperability analysis methodology for IoT devices in automated vehicles. The student will learn about the concept of device and system interoperability, research interoperability testing methods, and develop an open-source software tool to analyze the interoperability of IoT devices based on standard communication protocols. The tool will be validated against use cases and packet data provided by NIST researchers working collaboratively on the project.\n\nDesired skills: Java or Python programming experience required; computer science or computer engineering major preferred; experience using Extensible Markup Language (XML) preferred. [In-person opportunity]\n\n674-5 Developing Simulation Tools for Automated Vehicles\n\nThomas Roth, 301-975-3014, tpr1 [at] nist.gov (tpr1[at]nist[dot]gov)\n\nAn automated vehicle is expected to be competent in planning, monitoring, and performing behaviors that today are executed by human drivers. These behaviors include maintaining a lane under various adverse operating conditions, navigating an intersection including pedestrian traffic, and others. The automated execution of these behaviors must be both safe and predictable to meet the expectations of human drivers and other humans in the driving environment. The use of network communications between vehicles and between a vehicle and other devices (including road-side infrastructure and smaller devices such as cell phones) is expected to improve the safety and reliability of automated vehicles. One approach to validate these claims is simulation, with the network dynamics modeled in simulators such as ns-3 and the traffic dynamics modeled in simulators such as CARLA, SUMO, or MATLAB. Simulations can be used to test vehicle behaviors in a virtual environment prior to field deployment with low cost and low risk to humans.\n\nThis project is focused on the development of a simulation environment that combines ns-3 (network simulation) with CARLA (vehicle simulation) for vehicle-to-vehicle communication scenarios. The student will learn about the challenges preventing the widespread adoption of automated vehicles, receive training in the NIST simulation tools for automated vehicles, design simulations of driving scenarios in CARLA to stress test these tools, and develop C++ extensions to add support for new types of driving scenarios. This work will be performed collaboratively with a team of NIST researchers.\n\nDesired skills: experience with object-oriented programming required; experience with C++ programming language preferred; computer science major preferred. [In-person preferred]\n\n674-6 Simulation of Emergency Traffic Management for Smart Cities\n\nWendy Guo, 301-975-5855, wguo [at] nist.gov (wguo[at]nist[dot]gov)\n\nThe generation and effective communication of evacuation plans are critical requirements during civil emergencies and disasters. In emergency situations, managing traffic is of utmost importance to the safety of both road users and first responders, facilitating unrestricted egress for evacuations and road access for emergency personnel. The traffic management system plays a vital role in establishing and maintaining control points, restricting area access, and facilitating controlled transit through the incident site. Simulation of the potential response of road traffic to different disaster situations can help ensure that evacuation plans are robust and effective for a given community. These simulations can be conducted using SUMO, a software tool to model and analyze traffic, together with network simulators such as OMNeT++ that model the different cyber and social networks used to coordinate disaster response. These simulators can be synchronized to exchange data at runtime, enabling online simulations that model the impact of communication networks on road traffic (and the reverse). A software package called Veins provides this integration between SUMO and OMNeT++ with a comprehensive suite of realistic network models.\n\nThis project focuses on developing a traffic network simulation for emergency situations. The objective is to guide the student in setting up a simulation platform comprising SUMO, OMNet++, and Veins. The student will learn how to design simulations with real map settings under various scenarios, collect data from the simulations, and analyze it to derive meaningful insights for guiding emergency evacuations. The work will be a collaborative effort with a team of NIST researchers.\n\nDesired skills: experience with object-oriented programming is required; computer science major or experience with network design/simulation is preferred; interested in smart city topics and traffic network management. [In-person preferred]\n\n674-7 Software Implementation of an Industrial-Grade Robotic Arm Using the Robot Operating System\n\nKarl Montgomery, 301-975-3444, karl.montgomery [at] nist.gov (karl[dot]montgomery[at]nist[dot]gov)\n\nFor this project, the student will be an integral member of the Industrial Wireless Systems (IWS) Lab at NIST. The student will take on the responsibility of developing software in Python for a ROS/ROS2-based implementation of a robotic teleoperation scenario in which a 6 degree of freedom collaborative robot is controlled by a human using a gaming controller and visual feedback from a camera mounted on the robot. This research is integral to the IWS Lab research goals of providing a demonstration of heavy machinery control in the construction industry using wireless communications (such as Wi-Fi and 5G cellular) as the primary mode of communications.\n\nStage 1: ROS2 review and self-training.\n\nStage 2: Work with the IWS team to understand the current and future robotic scenarios and the software requirements for those scenarios.\n\nStage 3: Convert the existing ROS-based implementation to ROS2. ROS is a TCP-based communications software framework for robotic implementations. ROS2 is the second generation of ROS that supports TCP and UDP. Our goal is to have a mix of TCP and UDP traffic within our testbed scenario.\n\nStage 4: Implement in Python the ROS2 software implementation of the teleoperation scenario.\n\nStage 5: Write a SURF Report of our work and our findings.\n\nApplicant with a major in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or a related field with experience in Python and an understanding of algorithms preferred. The student should be interested in working within mechatronics systems, robotics, and communications impacts on those systems. The student should be eager to interact within a team and verbally communicate well. Intermediate-level or better expertise in Python will be essential for the student to have a successful experience.

States (CT, MA) are passing building and DOT codes to prevent this issue, but there are no standardized methods or concentration limits to assess pyrrhotite abundance. NIST developed reference standards (RM) to provide an accurate, consistent pyrrhotite analysis in concrete. This project focuses on optimizing sulfur analysis using an induction furnace combustion method to quantify total sulfur species in RMs and foundation specimens. This study will optimize the use of chemical reagents to ensure complete burn for cementitious systems.\n\nRequired Qualifications/Skills: Background knowledge and training in engineering or physics, or chemistry.

Pyrrhotite’s reactivity, variable structure, and similarity with pyrite present challenges in the quantification of its tolerable content in concrete aggregate. Thus, investigations often use mortar bar expansion tests to assess pyrrhotite reactivity. Mortar bar tests subject a specimen composed of cement and the aggregate of interest to exposure conditions. Specimen expansion is measured over time. This project focuses on the expansion measurement of mortar bars with pyrrhotite-bearing aggregate.\n\nRequired Qualifications/Skills: Background knowledge and training in engineering or physics, or chemistry.

The polymeric components in photovoltaic modules degrade during outdoor exposure, which can result in multiple failure mechanisms including cracking, delamination, and discoloration. While many characterization methods are well suited for polymer degradation studies, they require disassembly of the module and are limited to post-mortem analysis.

This assumption is used in cryptography to generate pseudo-random numbers. It also underlies the security of RSA. However, if you plot X2 modulo N for small (in the thousands) N, you can visualize parabolic patterns. Previous work has determined that various patterns are caused by the multiplicative structure of numbers close to N (e.g. N + 1). The project is to read report YALEU/DCS/TR-1252 and expand on the set of patterns by algebraic or other means. The methods to use will largely be decided by the student and myself. These can include i) algebraic analysis; ii) pattern recognition techniques. Of particular interest is whether the identified patterns can help in the search for X > sqrt(N) such that X2 mod N is small (<sqrt(N)). This would yield a factoring algorithm potentially faster than the Quadratic Sieve Algorithm.

When applying image restoration methods to recover degraded facial imagery, a restored face may be visually convincing (subjective), but does it actually improve biometric matching outcomes? The goal of this project is to investigate and develop metrics and methodologies for objectively measuring the performance and impact of different image restoration techniques on face recognition outcomes.\n\nEllipsoidal Harmonic Instability Analysis of Riemann S-type Ellipsoids\n\nThis project is to work with the original Fortran 77 code developed by Norman Lebovitz and Alexander Lifschitz to perform a high resolution numerical ellipsoidal harmonic instability analysis of the Riemann S-type ellipsoids. The Riemann S-type ellipsoids are uniform density (incompressible) inviscid self-gravitating equilibrium triaxial rotating fluid ellipsoids. These ellipsoids which have been studied for many centuries were popularized by Nobel Laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in his 1969 book \"Ellipsoidal Figures of Equilibrium\". It was noticed by Chandrasekhar and Lebovitz (Chandrasekhar's student) that these equilibrium fluid ellipsoids become unstable to a dynamical shape changing instability as the angular momentum of the ellipsoids (eccentricity) is increased. Using a numerical code originally developed by Lebovitz and Lifschitz, we would like to further explore the beautiful properties of these nonlinear instabilities by exploiting the original Lebovitz-Lifschitz code. To find more detail about the instability analysis, code and algorithms which are due to Norman Lebovitz (d.2022) and Alexander Lifschitz (now Alexander Lipton), see the following papers: (1) Lebovitz & Lifschitz, New Global Instabilities of the Riemann ellipsoids, The Astrophysical Journal (1996) 458, 699-713; (2) Lebovitz & Lifschitz, Short-wavelength instabilities of Riemann ellipsoids, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

However, these come with complications. Non-native polymers often fail to produce cell-cell intact, while native scaffolds from tissues risk disease transmission and immunological rejection due to incomplete cell removal. Cell-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) overcomes those obstacles, but the low-yield ECM production limits its advancements in clinical applications. This project aims to engineer ECM pre-scaffolds that match cell requirements and feed them into the cell culture to facilitate ECM production. We utilize lipid membranes to unfold proteins and make them ready to assemble into larger structures. The pre-scaffolds comprise single or multiple ECM’s key components, including collagen type I, elastin, fibronectin, and laminin. Langmuir isotherms, adsorption assays, and X-ray reflectometry will elucidate the membrane's physical properties and capture detailed structures of the pre-scaffolds forming on the membrane surface. These results will create a comprehensive knowledge of ECM nanoscopic fibrillar textures that would guide future ECM-mimetic material development in the tissue engineering community.

The surface activity of proteins allows them to be quickly adsorbed on the liquid surface, thereby reducing the surface tension of the solution. However, the interfacial adsorption property causes interactions between hydrophobic regions in proteins, which are exposed during the adsorption process, leading to structural changes in proteins and even aggregation. The aim of this research is to investigate the structural and thermodynamic properties of protein assembly at the air-water interface using x-ray reflection. Thin films of a protein will be formed at the air-aqueous solution interface. The surface tension is introduced as a characteristic parameter, the hydrophobicity and structure of proteins will be evaluated by x-ray reflection. The effect of protein concentration, ionic strength, sucrose, and temperature on surface assembly will be investigated. The research is expected to provide valuable insights into the pre-formulation of therapeutic proteins.

Although there are a wide variety of technologies for recycling textiles such as mechanical, chemical, thermomechanical, and biochemical processes, major challenges in each category persist and hinder the scalability, applicability, and practicality of these methodologies. More specifically, fabric blends with multi-material compositions make these recycling processes difficult. This project uses chemical recycling, hydrolysis, to understand the impact of mixed fiber blends, such as polyester-cotton-spandex, employing analytical lab techniques like Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and viscometry measurements.

This project will involve investigating the stability of trace drug deposits when exposed to different environmental conditions. Quantitative analysis will be performed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), along with full mass spectral analysis using thermal desorption direct analysis in real-time mass spectrometry (DART-MS).

NISTmAb is representative of the biggest class of protein therapeutics on the market and has been used by companies worldwide to advance the development of new analytical and measurement capabilities applicable to antibody drug characterization and quality control. To ensure the quality of the reference material itself, NIST scientists must regularly evaluate samples for signs of degradation. The reproducibility of the sample preparation and analytical methods used to monitor NISTmAb quality must be well understood so that any year-to-year variations that result from degradation may be distinguished from those caused by inherent method variation. The intern will perform experiments to evaluate the reproducibility of sample preparation and analytical methods used for peptide mapping analysis of the NISTmAb, and to compare the variability of manual versus automated sample preparation methods. The intern will learn basic laboratory skills required for preparing protein samples for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, liquid-chromatography (LC)-MS analytical techniques, software processing and analysis of LC-MS data, and use of automated liquid handling (robotic) systems for sample preparation.

[In-person opportunity]\n\n646-10 Measurement Methods for Carbon in Cements\n\nBrian Lang, brlang [at] nist.gov (brlang[at]nist[dot]gov)\n\nSequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the lowering of carbon dioxide emissions during the manufacture of cementitious materials have become processes of interest in the effort to mitigate climate change. This has driven a variety of ideas on methodologies to accomplish this from injecting emitted carbon dioxide into traditional hydraulic cements to creating and implementing non-hydraulic cements which cure by carbonation. The determination of the amount of carbon dioxide which has been sequestered into the cement or the concrete and other construction materials is an important aspect of the whole effort. This helps to inform in the comparison of products and processes, product labeling and governmental regulations and carbon credit systems. The NIST inorganic chemical metrology group has been tasked with establishing a standardized quantitative measurement methodology using combustion analysis to measure carbon/carbonate content in cementitious and construction materials as well as to support the development of other methodologies, such as thermogravimetric analysis. Our inorganic group also supports a significant portion of the NIST Standard Reference Material® program. These reference materials are used within the United States and globally to support measurement quality control. We are currently in the process of developing an ASTM method to determine sequestered carbon mass fraction in cements and are in the early phase of developing reference materials to support these types of measurements.

[In-person opportunity]\n\n610.02-6 Voltage-driven Control of Giant Magnetoresistance for Magnetoresistive Random Access Memories (MRAM)\n\nShane Lindemann and Peter Gehring, (301)975-6279, shane.lindemann [at] nist.gov (shane[dot]lindemann[at]nist[dot]gov)\n\nVoltage control of magnetism is a promising candidate for use in the next generation of Magnetoresistive Random Access Memories (MRAM). Here we aim to utilize strain-mediated coupling by fabricating magnetic thin films on substrates possessing piezoelectricity, a material property that allows electrical energy to be converted into strain. By applying an electric field across the substrate, the generated strain is transferred to the thin films resulting in changes in magnetism that can alter the electrical resistance of spin valves that consist of alternating layers of magnetic/nonmagnetic films. This mechanism is expected to provide higher storage densities, faster writing times, and orders of magnitude lower power consumption than today’s magnetic-field-write RAM. This summer, we invite a SURF student to join our investigation of voltage-driven changes in spin valve devices. The student’s role in this project will include: 1) Designing Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) spin valves which will be patterned from magnetic thin films on piezoelectric substrates. 2) Measurement and analysis of voltage-induced changes of magnetism in thin films using a B-H measurement system. 3) Experimentally testing changes of resistance in GMR spin valves using a 4-probe resistance measurement system, followed by analysis and correlation with the observed changes in magnetic hysteresis.

The goal of this project is to fully characterize the magnetic properties of a topological magnet using neutron scattering techniques. The SURF student will get familiar with the different neutron scattering techniques and apply one of them to study the magnetism of a topological magnet. [In-person opportunity]\n\n610.02-8 Capillary Rheology of Soft Nanoparticles\n\nKatie Weigandt and Kelsi Rehmann, (301)975-8396, kathleen.weigandt [at] nist.gov (kathleen[dot]weigandt[at]nist[dot]gov)\n\nThe new capillary rheoSAS developed at NIST is an instrument capable of measuring the structure of nanomaterials at very high speeds and deformation rates. Many consumer products consist of soft, structured nanomaterials that experience these high deformation rates during processing or end-use. However, commercial instruments rarely measure water-based samples at such high shear rates. Rheology is the measurement of a fluid’s response to deformation. We will be measuring the rheology of soft nanoparticles made of polymers and lipids in water as part of a larger program using capillary rheoSAS. Rheology measurements will include high shear capillary measurements and complementary low shear and oscillatory measurements. Sample preparation, which affects the final structure, will be a major part of this project; this includes different preparation methods for self-assembly as well as polymerization. Depending on availability, we will also study these materials with light, x-ray, and/or neutron scattering. In scattering techniques, an incident beam of light, x-ray, or neutrons is scattered after interacting with the sample, and the scattering pattern is measured. A model is fit to the scattering data to back out the nanoscale structure of materials. We will introduce the concepts of scattering but will focus on rheology measurements.
