        "text": "Are we talking music written specifically for films or any song that's featured in films?\n\nTheme from Shaft / Isaac Hayes (full length version if possible)\n\nAlso Sprach Zarathustra / Deodato (full length version if possible)\n\nA top ten hit in 1973 for this funked up version of the 2001 space odyssey theme. Richard Strauss would have loved it.\n\nThe Blowers Daughter / Damien Rice\n\nFrom the film Closer\n\nFor all the prestige exposure and hype surrounding Bond themes, none of them have ever topped the the uk charts.\n\nI tried before when it was Movie Themes...\n\nThen again on various Covers Themes...\n\nSurely tonight I'll be graced with \"You Only Live Twice\" by Soft Cell & as it's a cover of John Barry's work!\n\nUmpteenth time of asking! Please?\n\nThe Daughter surprises me by playing me all sorts of music I didn't think she'd have heard of...even went through a wee Buddy Holly phase...thanks to the soundtracks of films like 'Juno' and 'Scott Pilgrim vs The World' (yes she likes Michael Cera)...\n\nJuno:\n\n'Sea Of Love' - Cat Power\n\n'Dearest' - Buddy Holly\n\n'Anyone Else But You' - Moldy Peaches\n\n'All The Young Dudes' - Mott The Hoople\n\n'Scott Pilgrim'\n\n'By Your Side' - Beachwood Sparks\n\n'I Heard Ramona Sing' - Frank Black\n\n'Under My Thumb' - Rolling Stones\n\nIf it is film music composers then here are a few greats.\n\nHENRY MANCINI DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES,MOON RIVER\n\nMICHEL LEGRANDE A MAN AND WOMAN,UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG\n\nMAURICE JARRE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA,DOCTOR ZHIVAGO\n\nPHILIP GLASS THE HOURS, THE TRUMAN SHOW,KUNDUN.Favourite songs that appear in movies would have to be(you guessed)Joni Mitchell's \"Both Sides Now\" from the best scene in the dire movie \"Love Actually\",Laura Nyro's\"Its Gonna Take a miracle\"from \"A Home at the End of the World\" and for original song written for a film then I would go for The Wind mills of Your Mind\" from \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" by Noel Harrison though I would choose Dusty Springfield's seductive cover to his dry reading.Cheers ,Willie Bartke\n\nooh another area I have a playlist already created for :-)\n\nSelected from a longleet of 185:\n\n* Badly Drawn Boy - Something to Talk About (About a Boy)\n\n* All Saints - Pure Shores (The Beach)\n\n* Moby - Porcelain (The Beach)\n\n* U2 - The Hands That Built America (Gangs of New York)\n\n* Gypsy Kings - Hotel California (in Spanish, from The Big Lebowski)\n\n* The Edge/Sinead O'Connor - Heroine (Captive)\n\n* James Taylor - Our Town (Cars)\n\n* Alison Krauss/Gillian Welch - I'll Fly Away (O Brother Where Art Thou - actually, could just put the whole OST on)\n\n* Swing Out Sister - La La La Means I Love You (4 Weddings & A Funeral)\n\n* Michelle Shocked - Bear Necessities (Jungle Book... not the OST but a fine Western Swing cover)\n\n* Neil Hannon - So Long and Thanks for All The Fish (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)\n\n* James Taylor - Fire & Rain (Running on Empty)\n\n* Annie Lennox - Into the West (Return of the King)\n\n* Ewan McGregor, Jos√© Feliciano, Jacek Koman and Richard Roxburgh - El Tango Del Roxanne (Moulin Rouge - amazing cover of the Police original. Again, Moulin Rouge is an OST you could just play all of)\n\n* Boddy Womack - Across 110th Street (Jackie Brown)\n\n* The Psychedelic Furs - Pretty in Pink (Pretty in Pink)\n\n* Aimee Mann & Michael Penn - The Two of Us (Magnolia)\n\n* Mike Oldfield - Etude (The Killing Fields)\n\nHas anyone else seen Still Crazy - the (if you will) Rockumentary about the washed up giants of 70s music: Strange Fruit.\n\nStarred Jimmy Nail, Bill Nighy (previewing his character in Love Actually), Tim Spall, The Big Yin & others.\n\nHad a number of quite fantastic original tracks on the OST:\n\n* The Flame Still Burns\n\n* All Over the World\n\nboth of which could stand up in any band's discography\n\nThe movie had huge nods toward Syd Barrett, Keith Moon & Dave Lee Roth, and also gave its name to the Fratelli's 1st album.\n\nAnd speaking of Rockumentaries, you can't *not* do some Tap. I reckon\n\n* Spinal Tap - Stonehenge or Gimme Some Money should be perfectly playable on teatime radio.\n\n#3..............i remember the anticipation at the edinburgh filmhouse for the preview showing of the film.........there were whispers that bowie was going to be there..........however we had to make do with the author laurens van der post and the director,oshima, who i accosted to sign my programme..........probably worth a few bob on e-bay dontcha think.\n\ncheers frae the dale.\n\nMARCH FROM A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (BEETHOVEN: NINTH SYMPHONY: FOURTH MOVEMENT, ABRIDGED) from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE: WENDY CARLOS'S COMPLETE ORIGINAL SCORE by WENDY CARLOS\n\nTHE SONG HAS NO ENDING from BE GLAD FOR THE SONG HAS NO ENDING by THE INCREDIBLE STRING BAND\n\nDANCE OF THE JUST PLAIN FOLKS from FRANK ZAPPA'S 200 MOTELS by THE MOTHERS OF INVENTION AND THE ROYAL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA\n\nGOING HOME: THEME OF THE LOCAL HERO from LOCAL HERO by MARK KNOPFLER\n\nMAIN TITLE from THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS by TREVOR JONES AND RANDY EDELMAN\n\n#38 my memory has rejolted.....merry xmas was shown at the playhouse.\n\nnow attenborough, there's a name to conjure up brighton rock.......i'm just going to watch the dvd before reading the book before going to see the new version set in the 60's(!).........maybe it should've been called 'brighton rocks' (sic)........from the trailers i see a few scenes perched on beachy head...........now there's a theme.........songs that take you to dangerous places."
