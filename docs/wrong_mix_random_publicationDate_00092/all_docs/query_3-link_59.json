Papaefthymiou, Dean\n\n6210 Donald Bren Hall\n\nAcademic Counseling: 949-824-5156\n\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu\n\nThe Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) embodies excellence, creativity, and collaborative innovation in computer science and information technology. As the only independent computing school in the University of California system, it is well-positioned to continue its tradition of exploring and advancing the boundaries of a broad, multidisciplinary field on a global scale.\n\nICS faculty have extensive training in traditional computer science, as well as engineering, mathematics and statistics, and the social sciences. The School’s stand-alone structure, as opposed to being part of an engineering school, enables the faculty to take the broadest possible view of computer science and information technology. This breadth is reflected in the diverse set of academic degree options for undergraduate and graduate students, some of which are interdisciplinary and jointly administered with other academic units.\n\nThe School’s three departments — Computer Science, Informatics, and Statistics — fuel a wide range of instructional and research efforts, including: design of algorithms and data structures; computer architecture and embedded computer systems; networked and distributed systems; systems software; social and mobile computing; artificial intelligence, machine learning and data mining; computer games and virtual worlds; databases and information retrieval; computer graphics and visualization; bioinformatics, computational biology and genomics; computer-supported cooperative work, human-centered computing and human-computer interaction; security and privacy; software engineering; managerial and social aspects of computing technology; and statistics. The vibrant ICS community continues to explore innovative topics ranging from building complete computer systems on chips smaller than a human fingernail to developing user-interface systems that allow workers on opposite sides of the world to collaborate effectively. ICS research continues to focus on how computing and information technology can be used to solve a broad set of real-world problems, such as improving how first responders communicate during a crisis, optimizing transportation systems, analyzing data to expedite biological research, and improving network security.\n\nICS faculty actively lead and participate in a variety of research laboratories, institutes and centers, including the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics; Institute for Software Research; Institute for Virtual Environments and Computer Games; California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2); Data Science Initiative; Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems; Center for Digital Transformation; Center for Emergency Response Technologies; Center for Algorithms and Theory of Computation; Center for Research in Sustainability, Collapse-Preparedness & Information Technology; Secure Computing and Networking Center; Center for Ethnography; Social & Technological Action Research Group; Secure Systems and Software Laboratory; Software Engineering and Analysis Lab; Computational Vision Lab; Transformative Play Lab; Laboratory for Ubiquitous Computing and Interaction; Cybersecurity Policy & Research Institute (CPRI); Institute for Future Health; HPI Research Center in Machine Learning and Data Science at UCI; and the Steckler Center for Responsible, Ethical, and Accessible Technology (CREATE).\n\nFaculty and student-driven research in ICS is supported through a variety of grants, gifts, and contracts from public and private institutions such as the State of California, the U.S. Department of Education, various U.S. defense agencies, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, NASA, and various companies, including The Aerospace Corporation, Amazon, Boeing, Disney, Experian, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Samsung, Facebook, and Yahoo!\n\nFaculty and alumni of ICS have contributed some of computing’s most significant advancements, including revolutionizing computer-aided drafting techniques; the creation of the current Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1); development of the Internet standards for HTTP and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI); the founding of the Apache HTTP Server Project that produces the software for more than 60 percent of public Internet websites; and the creation of the Domain Name System (DNS) that translates Web and e-mail addresses into the numeric system used to route information along the Internet.\n\nICS is committed to increasing diversity in the computing and information technology fields. The Stacey Nicholas Office of Outreach, Access and Inclusion was created as a joint initiative between ICS and UCI’s Samueli School of Engineering to support the recruitment, retention, and graduation of undergraduate and graduate students from populations underrepresented in engineering and computer science. The School is also an active partner of the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT), whose overarching goal is parity in the professional information technology workforce, and a committed BRAID (Building, Recruiting And Inclusion for Diversity) Institution, working to increase the percentage of women and students of color majoring in computer science.\n\nHonors\n\nHonors at graduation, e.g., cum laude, magna cum laude, summa cum laude, are awarded to approximately the top 16 percent of the graduating seniors. A general criterion is that a student must have completed at least 72 units in residence at the University of California. The student’s cumulative record at the end of the final quarter is the basis for consideration of awarding Latin Honors. Other important factors are considered, please visit Honors Recognition.\n\nCareers\n\nGraduates of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences go on to pursue a variety of careers in both industry and academia in the areas of cutting-edge technology, science and business. With the goal of solving real-world problems with a global impact, ICS graduates find limitless opportunities as leaders in virtually every domain—from aerospace, automotive, biomedical, business information management, consumer products, cybersecurity, data science, engineering, entertainment, environmental, finance, gaming, national defense, pharmacology, and software engineering. ICS graduates often find jobs as members of research and development teams—building advanced technologies; designing software and hardware systems; analyzing and securing data; and specifying, designing, and maintaining computing infrastructures for a variety of institutions—while others venture off to form successful start-up companies or work as independent consultants. It is also common for ICS graduates to spend a few years in their related industry before moving into management or advanced technical positions, while others find that the undergraduate educational experience in ICS is the perfect stepping-stone for pursuing graduate studies in various computer science, informatics and statistics degrees, or venturing off into other academic areas such as medicine, law, engineering, or management.\n\nUndergraduate Programs\n\nA Donald Bren School of ICS undergraduate education is a blend of scholarship, science, technology, and practical application that forms an excellent foundation for professional life.\n\nThe basis of the undergraduate programs are a set of fundamental courses in mathematics and computer science, supplemented by general education courses from other academic disciplines. A premium is placed on both communication and quantitative skills. Students quickly gain hands-on experience with advanced computing systems, and intense use of computer and network technologies continues throughout the undergraduate program. Students study data organization, algorithm design and analysis, design and organization of hardware and network systems, software engineering, artificial intelligence, social aspects of system design and use, and management of technology. In the process, students work with state-of-the-art hardware and software technologies, and learn several contemporary programming languages.\n\nVisit the ICS Undergraduate Student Affairs Office website for restrictions between majors and minors and between double majors.\n\nAdmissions\n\nTo ensure admission consideration for the fall quarter, students should be sure to file their application by November 30 of the prior year. The selection criteria include grades, test scores, and other considerations.\n\nTransfer Student Policy\n\nTransfer requirements vary by major.\n\nBusiness Information Management\n\nComputer Science\n\nComputer Science and Engineering\n\nData Science\n\nGame Design and Interactive Media\n\nInformatics\n\nSoftware Engineering\n\nNOTE TO TRANSFER APPLICANTS: These majors require a series of lower-division courses, and prerequisites constrain the order in which they can be taken. Junior-level transfer students who must complete a significant part of this sequence may find that it will take longer than two years at UCI to complete their degree. Python, Java, and C++ are used in the curriculum; therefore, transfer students should plan to learn these languages by studying on their own or by completing related programming courses prior to their first quarter at UCI. Please note: a minimum grade of B will be expected for each major's required courses for admission.\n\nIt is recommended that students review the articulation agreement between their community colleges and a major at UC Irvine. This will allow them to make efficient progress toward the major.\n\nChange of Major\n\nStudents interested in changing their major to one offered by the School should contact the ICS Undergraduate Student Affairs Office for more information and assistance. Information is also available at the UCI Change of Major Criteria website.\n\nMajor and Minor Restrictions\n\nICS majors (including shared majors, BIM and CSE) pursuing minors within the Donald Bren School of ICS may not count more than one course toward both the major and minor.\n\nSome ICS majors and non-ICS minors are not permitted due to significant overlap.\n\nICS Majors who intend to pursue an additional major in the School should first check our information page to see what degree programs are eligible for double majoring.\n\nVisit the ICS Undergraduate Student Affairs Office's website for detailed information on all restrictions.\n\nSpecial Programs and Courses\n\nThe ICS Honors Program\n\nThe ICS Honors Program provides selected upper-division students an opportunity to carry out a research project under the direction of a faculty member in the School. Admitted students participate in the ICS Honors Seminar (I&C SCI H197), which provides an introduction to the range of current faculty research. Each student then affiliates with an ICS faculty advisor who agrees to supervise a minimum of two quarters of honors research. The participating student prepares a final written research report and submits a copy for review to both the faculty advisor and the Honors Program advisor. For more information about course requirements, application procedures, and deadlines visit http://honors.ics.uci.edu/, or contact the Student Affairs Office at 949 824-5156.\n\nICS H197: Students must complete the ICS H197 Honors Seminar (1-2 units) each quarter while enrolled in the ICS Honors Program. ICS H197 will be offered for 2 units in the Fall as an introduction to the program and 1 unit for the Winter and Spring quarters as a way to monitor student progress and increase engagement.\n\nCS/INF/STATS H198- Faculty Advising and Research: After taking ICS H197 and finding a faculty advisor, students will enroll in 2 quarters of honors research. Students have the option of enrolling in 2 H198 Honors Research courses in their respective departments (i.e. Computer Science, Informatics, or Statistics) OR substitute their second H198 Honors Research course for an ICS H198W Thesis Supervision course while they work on writing their honors thesis.\n\nICS H198W Thesis Supervision (4 units): Students can take an H198W Thesis Supervision course while they work on writing their honors thesis. This course can be used for the students’ upper division writing course towards their GE 1 requirement and may substitute any upper division writing course required for their major upon petition. Faculty advisors participating in the ICS Honors Program will be responsible for aiding students in writing their thesis to the caliber of an upper division writing course. An ethics component will be added to ICS H197 in the Fall to ensure students have a good understanding of this topic prior to beginning their research project.\n\nProgram Completion\n\nTo complete the ICS Honors Program, students must:\n\nComplete ICS H197 for three quarters,\n\nComplete H198 for at least two quarters or complete at least one H198 and ICS H198W.\n\nSubmit a thesis which must be approved by their faculty advisor and the ICS Honors Program Advisor.\n\nPresent their honors project in a public forum. This can be a symposium such as the ICS Project Expo or the UROP Undergraduate Research Symposium, or another approved event.\n\nOther Opportunities\n\nICS undergraduates may complement their educational experience by participating in other programs. Information about the following programs is available elsewhere in the Catalogue and via the program Web sites: Campuswide Honors Collegium, Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, Education Road Program, and Student Achievement Guided by Experience (SAGE Scholars)."
