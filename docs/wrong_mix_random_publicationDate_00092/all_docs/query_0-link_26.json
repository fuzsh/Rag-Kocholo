Before he became the director, he served as the associate director of the branch libraries and associate director of the central library. He started work at the library in 1971 as the assistant bookmobile librarian. During Bulow’s service to the library, the library system won numerous awards for public service, including two John Cotton Dana Library Public Relations Awards sponsored by the H. W. Wilson Company; the H. W. Wilson Foundation, and the Library Administration and Management Association, a division of the American Library Association. Bulow spearheaded innovative programs including the bookstore model to deliver library service and one of the first books-by-mail programs to provide library materials to the home-bound. As associate director for the branch libraries, Bulow championed\n\nThousands Catch a Bug @ the Library\n\nWe are proud to announce that over 6000 kids caught the \"reading bug\" resulting in 53,336 books being read during this year's summer reading program.

If you are in the mood for an unusual mystery, read The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon . The story is told through the eyes of a unique and talented youngster, Christopher John Francis Boone. From the beginning, we enter the mind, including the thought processes and emotions of this young autistic boy. Christopher speaks to us in a simplistic style as he introduces his family and friends. As he describes his interactions with neighbors, friends and family, we develop an insight into his emotional maturity, thoughts and feelings. We experience the joys, frustrations and day-to-day emotions of an autistic individual as he relates his account of the mysterious death of a neighborhood poodle named Wellington. The mystery itself is quite unusual, adding to the wit and eccentric flavor of the book. Through the eyes of this character, we increase our\n\nSister Dearest\n\nHis hand served as an ashtray for her Ricola cough drop. He flew coach while she flew first class. He was cut as a backup dancer and hired to wipe the sweat from his sister’s naked torso between songs and pick up her dirty undies off the floor. Pity poor Christopher Ciccone , a self-described Jeeves and Madonna’s younger brother. Is it any wonder he’s seeking revenge through that time-tested mode of retaliation—the tell-all book? Regardless of your degree of affinity for Madonna , she is one of the most famous women in the world. She is a ruthless businesswoman and a savvy entertainer who changed like a chameleon every few years to stay fresh for hungry fans who ate up every song note, movie line, and costume change. Considering Mrs. Ritchie is half a century old, you just know this is going to be one worth-it read. I've reserved my place in line for Life with My Sister Madonna . How about you?\n\nNonfiction Book Review: The Color of Water\n\nIn the autobiography, The Color of Water , James McBride tells the emotional and inspiring story of growing up in Brooklyn, born to an African-American father and a Jewish mother. During his early youth, James recognized that his mother seemed different. Of course, as any youth would, he began asking questions. James asked his mother about the color of her skin, she remarked that she was simply light-skinned. James also asked what color God was and she said: “God is the color of water. Water doesn’t have a color.” When James asked if he was black or white, Ruth angrily said to him, “You’re a human being. Educate yourself or you’ll be a nobody!” He experienced racism and prejudice on the Brooklyn streets. As an adult, James decided to lovingly pay tribute to his mother by revealing her story through a memoir. Ruth McBride’s story slowly unraveled over a period of fourteen years. Alternating with her story are chapters that relate the story of James McBride. As with any family, you will\n\nDennis Lehane Alert\n\nFor Dennis Lehane fans the long two years' wait is over.

Here, too, are some of the most influential figures of the era—Babe Ruth; Eugene O'Neill; leftist activist Jack Reed; NAACP founder W. E. B. DuBois; Mitchell Palmer, Woodrow Wilson's ruthless Red-chasing attorney general; cunning Massachusetts governor Calvin Coolidge; and an ambitious young Department of Justice\n\nBPL@Night to Host Act of Congress Concert\n\nNight music in the atrium of the Birmingham Public Library is a unique experience, and the library has teamed with one of the most exciting bands in the city, Act of Congress, to bring a free concert to the library’s atrium on August 21, 2008 at 6:30 p.m. Act of Congress is relatively new and has released an EP titled Love Remains .

The journey began on the morning of December 10, 1996. Within only four hours, she was left unable to walk, talk, speak, read, write or recall events in her life. Blood filled the left portion of her brain, causing it to swell. The stroke involved a hemorrhage in the middle to posterior portion of the left hemisphere of her brain- the analytical portion, while the intuitive right hemisphere allowed her to miraculously experience peace during this tragic event. The left portion of the brain allowed Jill to recognize that she was having a stroke and finally enabled her to seek the help she desperately needed. Jill required eight years for complete recovery.

According to Ludmila Koehler, writing in Russian Review , Solzhenitsyn's literary debut \"swept into the world like a gust of fresh wind.\" In the ensuing twelve years Solzhenitsyn continued to produce esteemed works, including an ambitious study, The Gulag Archipelago , 1918-1956: An Experiment in Literary Investigation , and two novels, The First Circle and Cancer Ward . Such writings, while winning acclaim in the west, further aggravated his notoriety in the USSR, and in 1974, four years after receiving the Nobel Prize for literature, Solzhenitsyn was summarily expelled from his homeland. Soviet authorities, who had previously denied Solzhenitsyn permission to leave the country, decided that he\n\nIn the News: Pakistan's K2 Claims More Lives\n\nPakistan's K2 is not the highest mountain in the world—that would be Mount Everest. But although K2 is the second highest peak in the world, it is considered a more challenging climb to the mountaineers who have attempted its summit. Early Saturday morning as seventeen climbers from seven countries were descending K2, an avalanche dislodged the rope they were using and three climbers were killed. Two managed to return to base camp while the others waited for rescue. When rescue didn't come, more climbers died trying to make it back to camp. A total of eleven climbers died in this accident. To date this is the deadliest accident in the history of K2 mountaineering. AdventureStats.com reports that sixty-six other climbers have died since 1939. Mountaineering is a popular sport, as is evident by the number of books written by and about climbers. Go here for a general list of books and media on mountaineering.
