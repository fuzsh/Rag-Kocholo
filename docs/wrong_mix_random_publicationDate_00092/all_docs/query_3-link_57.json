When a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Rochester, he identified the biochemical properties of several factors that function in nucleotide excision repair (NER), some of which play a dual role in RNA polymerase II transcription. Since establishing his own laboratory in 1993, he has focused on understanding how cells engage homologous recombination (HR) as tool in eliminating DNA breaks and crosslinks. The efficiency of HR catalyzed by the RAD51 recombinase is regulated by the tumor suppressors BRCA1, BARD1, BRCA2, PALB2, NBS1, and BLM and by components of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway of DNA damage response/repair in humans, providing compelling evidence for a key role of HR in cancer avoidance. His studies have led to many original findings. To date, he has published 311 articles, with 259 of them being original research papers. According to Scopus, his h-index is 85 with >25,400 citations, while Google Scholar reports an h-index of 105 with >37,550 citations. He has accrued extensive leadership experience, having served as journal editor or associate editor (Molecular & Cellular Biology and the Journal of Biological Chemistry), NCI Training Grant Co-director, NIH study section chair (Cancer Etiology), Department Chair (Yale University and University of Texas), and as the current Director of the Greehey Children’s Cancer Research Institute, and Director (ad interim) of our NCI-designated Mays Cancer Center.

She completed postdoctoral training in Functional Genomics and Systems Biology at Yale School of Medicine (Human Genetics) and the University of Chicago (Human Genetics and Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology). Here work involved key elements of the ModENCODE project, showing the genome-wide and tissue-specific dynamics of hormone receptor binding, establishing the dynamics of these functions on a cellular level. Her postdoctoral training in Cancer Health Disparities at University of Chicago at the Interdisciplinary Center for Health Disparities, led the current trajectory of her work to uncover the biological determinants of cancer health disparities and how they intersect with marginalization of minoritized population.\n\nDr. Davis’s has published groundbreaking findings that established a new lens to study associations of biological factors in cancer outcomes as related to genetic ancestry. Specifically, she has discovered links between African ancestry and tumor burdens that have a disproportionate burden in people across the African diaspora. Dr. Davis is a pioneer in the field of “disparities genomics,” with specific focus in breast cancer expanding into prostate and gynecological cancers in recent years. Her current findings involve utilizing quantified ancestry to unravel genetic vs environmental influences in tumor biology among race/ethnic groups, including epigenetic cell signaling and immunological responses in the tumor microenvironment and systemic immune regulation. These novel opportunities to develop precision medicine applications in minority populations, are part of a concerted effort to increase knowledge of genomic profiles of underrepresented minoritized and under-represented cancer patients. Her work is a prime example of how inclusion of diverse ethnic groups can empower research designs for discovery of novel or unique tumor biology.\n\nNovember 3rd, 2023\n\nSusan Schembre, PhD\n\nLCCC\n\n“Addressing the obesity epidemic: time for a paradigm shift.”\n\nSponsor: Dr. Marc Schwartz and Dr Ken Tercyak\n\nDr. Schembre is a trained Behavioral Scientist and Research Dietitian, and full member of the LCCC.

He received a PhD in Molecular Pathology and Immunology studying gene regulation with Maureen Goodenow (then at University of Florida), and then joined Philip Tsichlis (then at Fox Chase Cancer Center) whose lab was at that time cloning novel genes activated by Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion mutagenesis (e.g. Akt, Tpl2). He participated in the identification of the Growth factor independent-1 (Gfi1) transcription factor, its DNA binding specificity, named the “SNAG” transcription repressor domain, and genetically linked this domain to Gfi1-directed biology. His laboratory continues to focus on transcriptional integration of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. With Marshall Horwitz (U. Wash) they identified humans with mutations in GFI1, who display severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and non-immune chronic idiopathic neutropenia of adults (NI-CINA). His laboratory has established multiple mouse models of human disease, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and more recently SCN. His work has spanned both small molecule and RNA therapeutics. In Cancer Discovery 2016, they proved that Dnmt3a haplo-insufficiency could facilitate AML genesis. In Nature 2016, they were one of the first labs to utilize scRNA Seq profiling to dissect homeostatic myeloid development and provide deep molecular insight into the process of differentiation. In Blood 2018, they showed (for the first time) that scRNA Seq data can be analyzed for RNA splicing, and showed that TGFbeta-induced destruction of SKI impacted splicing independent of splicing factor mutations in early-stage myelodysplasia (MDS). In Nature June 2020, they generated the first mouse models of human severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) using patient-derived mutations in the GFI1 transcription factor. To determine the effects of SCN mutations, they generated single-cell references for granulopoietic genomic states with linked epitopes, aligned mutant cells to their wild-type equivalents and identified differentially expressed genes and epigenetic loci. These insights facilitated the genetic rescue of granulocytic specification but not post-commitment defects in innate-immune effector function and underscore the importance of evaluating the effects of mutations and therapy within each relevant cell state. They are actively harnessing both established and cutting-edge single cell technologies to dissect the transcriptional and epigenetic programming of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. In collaboration with Nathan Salomonis (CCHMC) he develops biologically-centric informatics algorithms to process single cell data, web portals to disseminate the work flows, and web browsers to make the data easily accessible to biologists.\n\nNovember 11th, 2022\n\nWilliam A.

He has been elected to the National Academy of Medicine and the Association of American Physicians.\n\nDr. DeBerardinis’ laboratory studies the role of altered metabolic pathways in human diseases, including cancer and pediatric inborn errors of metabolism. The lab has pioneered the use of metabolomics and isotope tracing to characterize disease-associated metabolic states directly in patients, and to use disease-relevant model systems to explore how metabolic perturbations contributes to tissue dysfunction. Work from the DeBerardinis laboratory has produced new insights into disease mechanisms in numerous metabolic diseases, including by defining unexpected fuel preferences in human cancer and uncovering new metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer cells.\n\nDr. DeBerardinis received a Bachelor of Science in Biology from St. Joseph’s University in Philadelphia before earning M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Medicine. He completed his post-graduate clinical training at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in Pediatrics, Medical Genetics and Clinical Biochemical Genetics. Before coming to UT Southwestern, he performed postdoctoral research at the Penn Cancer Center.\n\nJanuary 21st, 2022\n\nDavid J. Robbins, Ph.D.\n\nLCCC\n\n“Targeting colorectal cancer with Wnt inhibitors”\n\nSponsor: Dr. Louis Weiner\n\nDr. Robbins’ graduate work was performed in the Department of Pharmacology at UT-Southwestern medical school, with Dr. Melanie Cobb. During this time his work focused on the role MAP kinases play in growth regulation, eventually identifying these kinases as effector"
