        "text": "Thank you so much for doing this with us! Before we dig in, our readers would like to get to know you a bit more. Can you tell us a bit about your “backstory” and how you grew up?\n\nAbsolutely. And thank you, Sara, for this opportunity to share with your readers. I grew up on Chicago’s South Side. My parents raised me in the Christian faith and were strict disciplinarians. In my early years, I didn’t exhibit much promise, but around fourth grade, I became a good student. As time went on, I had my ups and downs but was able to graduate college with a degree in information systems.\n\nSince graduating from Illinois State University, I’ve become an ordained minister, run for Congress, received a Master of Divinity degree from Moody Theological Seminary, become an assistant pastor at one of Chicago’s largest megachurches, started Healing of the Soul Ministries, and am studying to be a Doctor of Ministry at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.\n\nLet’s talk about what you are doing now, and how you achieved the success that you currently enjoy. Can you tell our readers a bit about the work you are doing?\n\nAs I stated earlier, I am an assistant pastor at the historic Apostolic Church of God, which sits about a mile from the coming Barack Obama Presidential Center. My responsibilities include providing strategic support to our ministries, developing volunteers, and facilitating community engagement. I also lead Healing of the Soul Ministries, which is a parachurch organization that focuses on sharing the Christian faith and providing spiritual resources. One way we are carrying out that mission, which I am excited about, is through my first book to be released this summer entitled, Men After God’s Heart: 10 Principles of Brotherly Love.\n\nThese achievements are the result of God’s help, the talents and abilities He has given me, the platform of serving at a megachurch, and studying at two of the top seminaries in the country: Moody Theological Seminary and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.\n\nYou are a successful leader. Which three character traits do you think were most instrumental to your success? Can you please share a story or example for each?\n\nThat’s a great question. I think “success” is relative, but what I can say is that achievement requires faith, vision, and perseverance.\n\nMy entire life is shaped by my faith. It’s what governs my worldview, my ethics, and the other two traits. In 2010, I decided to challenge Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. for the seat in Illinois’ 2nd Congressional District. Each election cycle he won eighty-plus percent of the vote. My chance of winning was slim to none. Yet, I prayed about the run and chose to move forward by faith. Did I win? No. But the people I met, opportunities I was given, and lessons I learned are incorporated into the work I do today. Faith is not always about receiving the outcome you hope for; it is about trusting God to bless the decisions you make to benefit you in the long-term.\n\nVision is important because you have to see where you want to go before you can ever reach that destination. There is a saying that “seeing is believing.” That’s what vision is: seeing the outcome you desire, so that you can hold on to it when obstacles arise. I mentioned that I have a book coming out this summer. That book is the result of a convergence between a seminar I taught at a men’s retreat and my mentor essentially calling me an underachiever for not having written any books. The only reason I have gotten through this two-year process is because I saw what could be and trusted God to help me finish a project that was nothing more than an idea at the beginning.\n\nPerseverance is the ability to endure despite the challenges. In fact, faith, vision, and perseverance are like an inseparable triad. You need all three to be successful. When I walked on the campuses of Illinois State University and Moody Theological Seminary, I thought to myself, “How am I ever going to get out of here?” It took me six years to earn my undergraduate degree and ten years to earn my master’s. There’s only one word that can explain how I finished both: perseverance. While pursuing my bachelor’s degree, I persevered through neglecting my studies the first two years, suffering an auto accident at the hands of a drunk driver, and being evicted from my campus apartment because my roommate didn’t pay his half of the rent. While pursuing my master’s degree, I persevered through having to go to class at night, using my income tax returns to fund my education, and taking a break to run for Congress. In both pursuits, I could have walked away, but I overcame every challenge because I wanted to achieve the goal I had in mind.\n\nWhat’s the WHY behind the work that you do? Please share a story about this if you can.\n\nMy faith informs me that our lives are ultimately governed by the providence of God. Although we have free will — and we do — God has a way of influencing our decisions through the experiences we encounter in life. So, my “why” is that I feel called by God to serve humanity through the spiritual resources He has made available to me. That is, through the church to which I belong and the company I operate, I am able to impact people’s lives for their good and God’s glory.\n\nThe best way to ground this is to offer a vignette of some of my experiences. My “why” is made clear when I think of the homeless people we provided used clothes to who rushed the racks of clothes like they were made for the Oscars, or the time I had to speak with a 14-year-old boy through the crack of his cell door at the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center, or the lady who told me she was about to give up on her business until she heard my message about persevering in the vision God has given us. This is my “why”: impacting and transforming people’s lives for their good and God’s glory.\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\n\nThere are watershed moments in our lives that seem to come at pivotal times. One of those moments came for me in eighth grade. I know that seems so far removed, but I’m not sure how my life would have turned out if it wasn’t for that period in my journey.\n\nThe person who helped me was my eighth-grade teacher, Mr. Cramer. He was a white guy teaching at a black elementary school. In seventh grade, I began to skip school, and my grades dropped as a result. Before seventh grade, my standardized test scores were typically one grade higher in reading and two grades higher in math. That year, my reading score was at the sixth-grade level. I was devasted and determined to do better the following year.\n\nIn Mr. Cramer’s eighth grade class, I applied myself, and he often affirmed me in front of my classmates. This helped to boost my confidence and determination to stay focused on my education. His encouragement and recognition assisted me in bringing my scores back to where I historically trended. I also was the salutatorian for my graduating class.\n\nAwesome! Let’s now jump to the primary focus of our interview. I’m an author and I believe that books have the power to change lives. Can you please tell our readers about “The Book That Changed Your Life”? Can you share a story about how it impacted you?\n\nBeing a Reverend, it is easy for people to dismiss the book I have chosen, but I am a Reverend because of this book. The book that changed my life is the Bible. I was born and raised in the Christian faith, yet my attention eventually focused toward being cool and a part of the in-crowd. I engaged in behavior and activities that I am ashamed to admit.\n\nIn my early twenties, I began to look at the life I was living and the people I was hanging with and realized the information I had been taught from the Bible was true. I concluded that God does exist, He has a plan for my life, and it was up to me to choose to follow Him or continue down the path of destruction I was headed. I chose to follow Him by placing my trust in Jesus.\n\nHow has the Bible changed my life? First, it has taught me how to have a relationship with my Creator. Second, it has given me a moral and ethical framework by which to live my life. Third, it has given me principles to govern every area of my life — business, finances, parenting, marriage, etc. Finally, it helps me to keep a proper perspective of life and all that comes with being human. That’s what the Bible is: a book about how to be human God’s way.\n\nWhat was the moment or series of events that made you decide that you wanted to take a specific course of action based on the inspiration from the book? Can you share a story about that?\n\nThe beauty of the Bible is that it is a book that continually builds self-actualization in the lives of those who employ its principles. What I can share with you is that I often find myself in competitive environments with people who are courtiers, so I have to be cognizant of the machinations that are happening around me at all times. Despite finding myself surrounded by such activity, I draw inspiration from the story of David who became king of Israel despite being ostracized by his father and family and underestimated by others. His key to success was his unwavering trust in God and His providence. He didn’t need to employ the principles of The 48 Laws of Power or The Prince. He just stayed faithful to the principles of Scripture. And, so far, it has proven fruitful for me. I continue to advance in my career and in life while maintaining my integrity. That inspiration comes solely from the Bible.\n\nCan you articulate why you think books in particular have the power to create movements, revolutions, and true change?\n\nSir Francis Bacon said, “Knowledge itself is power.” When we think of movements, revolutions, or change, they require a catalyst to set them in motion. What books contain are the potential energy to catalyze people and groups to action. If knowledge truly is power, then I want to increase the potential to expand my capacity and competency to create impact. And while I draw knowledge from many genres of literature, I would be negligent if I didn’t seek to learn from the most knowledgeable Being of all. In fact, in the wisdom books of the Bible, the primary principle is that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\n\nAt its core, every book is an idea, and ideas are the building blocks of civilization. The internet started as an idea. The cell phone started as an idea. Artificial intelligence started as an idea. And, according to the Bible, all of creation started as an idea in the mind of God. So, when you ask why books have power, my answer is because there is nothing filled with more potentiality than an idea.\n\nA book has many aspects, of course. For example, you have the writing style, the narrative tense, the topic, the genre, the design, the cover, the size, etc. In your opinion, what are the main, essential ingredients needed to create a book that can change lives?\n\nThat’s a very tough question to answer. As a blogger and now first-time author, I would say you need at least two things. First, you need substance. Just because you compile pages of words into a work does not mean you have something worth reading. There is nothing more frustrating than reading something that offers nothing. By substance, I don’t mean having a bunch of information, but having content that sparks imagination in the mind of the readers. Tupac Shakur once said, “I’m not saying I’m gonna change the world, but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world.” The best books are difficult to read quickly because they ignite your imagination.\n\nSecond, you need conviction. The great movements of the world have been initiated by people who believed in they ideas they promulgated — be they benign or malignant. If a writer hopes to change lives through his words, then he must be fully persuaded of the change he is selling. Conviction is contagious. When the passion of the author leaps from the pages of her work, the reader can’t help but be drawn into her world and captivated by the power of her ideas.\n\nWhat are your “5 Things I Wish Someone Told Me Before I Started My Career” and why? (Please share a story or example for each.)\n\nOne thing I wish someone would have told me is the importance of reading. This may sound trivial, but I am a late bloomer to reading. I have previously read because it was required, but now I read because I enjoy learning. Had I started reading in my twenties with the mindset I have today, I would be much further along in life.\n\nSecond, I wish someone would have told me to find a few mentors. Mentors provide valuable advice and counsel based upon their experience and expertise. Today, I have mentors who have experienced much success in the public, private, and religious sectors. Their varying perspectives and personalities aide me in any numbers of ways and strengthen my ability to achieve my goals. Earlier in my professional career, I did not have mentors. They are invaluable to those looking to accelerate their careers by learning from the successes and failures of others. For example, my first book is a convergence of men encouraging me to use the material from a seminar I taught and one of my mentors challenging me to stop underachieving and start writing books.\n\nThird, I wish someone would have told me that volunteering for special projects provides opportunities for career advancement. Where I come from, exempting the need for more money, people don’t want to work overtime, come in on off days, or take on additional responsibilities. What I didn’t know is that it demonstrates company loyalty, curries favor with those who have decision-making power, and provides opportunities for your skills to shine. When I worked at a previous corporation, we would sometimes have issues that arose which required workers to volunteer to come in on Saturdays. During those special project days, I was afforded the opportunity to converse with the president of our division. Because of my commitment and consistent performance, he created a position for me and became my sponsor.\n\nFourth, I wish someone would have told me that leadership is different from management. I am an administrator by gifting. I live in the world of processes, procedures, and protocols. What I discovered as I continued to rise in my company was that leadership is much harder to master. The biggest difference between the two is that leadership requires many of the soft skills that management doesn’t necessarily require. As I have transitioned from being a manager into a leader, I’ve had to master such skills as emotional intelligence, coaching, teambuilding, and collaboration. The benefits of which have been improved team morale and performance and less stress for me.\n\nFinally, I wish someone would have told me that life is cyclical. I say that because I have experienced unnecessary stress in my life when things didn’t appear to be going as I had planned. Life is full of ups and downs and twists and turns, but, in the end, things seem to balance themselves out, or as we say in the Christian faith, “God causes all things to work together for our good.” One example that comes to mind is when I was passed over for a promotion. At the time that it happened, I was devastated. But I remained loyal to the institution and continued to demonstrate my worth. Eventually, I turned myself into an invaluable asset and was able to be promoted to a similar position in the company. Had I folded my tent and packed my bags when things went awry, I would not have had the opportunity to see things work out in the end.\n\nThe world, of course, needs progress in many areas. What movement do you hope someone (or you!) starts next? Can you explain why that is so important?\n\nThe challenges that some neighborhoods in Black communities are facing is of grave concern to me. In these neighborhoods, things appear to be worsening. I am a firm believer that we are only as strong as our weakest link. Yet, these neighborhoods have experienced neglect and deprivation for decades. As a result, a lot of the mayhem that we see today is directly correlated to our failure to resolve these issues when they were manageable. So I hope to contribute to a comprehensive strategy for turning these blighted communities into neighborhoods that are vibrant, safe, and nurturing.\n\nHow can our readers further follow your work online?\n\nThank you again, Sara, for this opportunity to share with your readers about my favorite book and its impact in my life.
