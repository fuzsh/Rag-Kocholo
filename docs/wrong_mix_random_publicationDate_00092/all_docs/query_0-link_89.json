        "text": "The most important news story of the past decade doesn't concern a specific band or genre or trend. It's the story of how music news itself has changed. Think back to the turn of the millennium: How did you find out that your favorite band had a new album coming out? Sure, the few of us with fast enough internet connections might have read about it online, but it's more likely that you read about it in a magazine, saw a poster at your local record store, or maybe, maybe heard about it from MTV News. These days, that magazine has probably folded, your local record store is now a Best Buy, and MTV just wants to show you \"Hills\" spin-offs. You're going to find out about that album from a music news blog or site, or even from the band themselves, via their own web portal or Twitter. And you're probably going to end up hearing that album much, much sooner than the band intended, thanks to a leak.\n\nAs the decade progressed, music news got faster and more crowded. In 2000, the news section was just a side-note to the reviews and features on Pitchfork. By 2005, we posted new stories once a day. (We even took Fridays off!) In 2009, we're updating anywhere from 10 to 20 times a day-- not to mention posting often to our Twitter feed. Music news has also become less controlled, by labels and publicists as well as by the artists themselves. Wavves has a breakdown on stage in Barcelona? People halfway across the world will hear about it as it happens, and video will pop up the next morning. Kanye divebombs Taylor Swift at the VMAs? If you haven't posted about it within three minutes, you're too late. It's a small miracle that anyone can keep up.\n\nSo let's take a breather, and a look back: The Decade in News traces the ups and downs, zigs and zags that the music Pitchfork covers has taken over the past 10 years. From Britney to Bright Eyes, from the Strokes to Vampire Weekend, from Napster to the iPhone, it's all here. And it's enough to make any band that faded from the spotlight prior to the 2000s say, \"God, I'm glad the internet didn't exist when we were around.\" --Amy Phillips\n\nThe Go-Betweens, MBV's Kevin Shields Return, With Friends\n\nA pair of long-dormant indie rock originators returned to the music world in 2000. The hugely influential Australian indie pop group the Go-Betweens broke up in 1998, but they reunited in 2000 and released the gorgeous comeback LP The Friends of Rachel Worth. It featured contributions from all three members of Sleater-Kinney. Go-Betweens principals Robert Forster and Grant McLennan remained together long enough to release two more albums before McLennan died suddenly of a heart attack in 2006. Meanwhile, My Bloody Valentine leader Kevin Shields had largely faded from the spotlight since his band's post-Loveless dissolution. But in 2000, he made a quiet return (if anything Shields does can be called quiet), playing on and producing Primal Scream's XTRMNTR album and touring with the band. He later worked on Evil Heat, Primal Scream's follow-up, did some work on the Lost in Translation soundtrack, and eventually reunited MBV to play some of the loudest shows anyone had ever heard. --Tom Breihan\n\nUKG Kicks Off the Garage Continuum\n\nThe garage continuum-- arguably the most dynamic and inventive new thread of music this decade-- is barely understood in the U.S. And, at its start at least, not often respected in many music circles. But what began as UK Garage/2-Step has gone on to mutate into grime, dubstep, and, recently, funky and wonky. UKG started simply enough, as an offshoot of speed garage, an amped-up version of drum'n'bass. Eventually, the sound became more feminized, taking cues from the then-ascendant world of U.S. R&B, often adding female vocals and stripping away half of the typical four beats in a measure (hence the name \"2-Step,\" which it soon began to be called). The result maintained the robustness of jungle and married it to the futurism and minimalism of turn-of-the-millennium American chart music (think the work of producers like Timbaland or She'kspere). Considered stylish, even sophisticated, 2-Step in London soon moved from pirate radio into fashionable clubs, where it appealed to champagne-guzzling, well-dressed crowds. It's no wonder the sound quickly got darker, turning into grime. --Scott Plagenhoef\n\n__Almost Famous, High Fidelity Take Music Dorks to Hollywood\n\n__\n\nPlenty separates William Miller, the hero of Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous, from Rob Gordon, the protagonist of Stephen Frears' High Fidelity. One's a teenager; one's an adult. One's a quiet and retiring type; one yammers endlessly at the camera. One has to babysit a stoned Billy Crudup, and one has to contend with a fired-up Jack Black. But both characters obsess endlessly over music, even to the detriment of their real-life relationships. Both pine inarticulately after girls. Both dress like herbs. In short, both are total music dorks. For one brief shining moment in 2000, Hollywood deemed people like us sufficiently fascinating enough to build a couple of big movies around. Interestingly, both characters end their story arcs learning that music is no substitute for real human interaction, something many of us still have yet to figure out nine years later. (Another 2000 movie protagonist, Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, actually does more music criticism than either, but he'd probably drop a chainsaw on you from the top of a staircase if you called him a dork.) --TB\n\nJanuary 10\n\n__Melissa Etheridge Deems David Crosby Father Material\n\n__\n\nWhen singer-songwriter Melissa Etheridge and her partner, filmmaker Julie Cypher, decided to have children, they went to the world's greatest sperm donor: the somehow still-alive folk-rocker David Crosby. Because when you think of whose DNA you want your baby to have, you're obviously going to settle on a guy who's overweight, balding, and had his liver replaced in 1994. In January 2000, when Etheridge revealed Crosby as the biological father of their two children, the sound of heads being scratched was deafening. --TB\n\nJanuary 25__\n\n__\n\nD'Angelo Gives World Neo-Soul Masterpiece, Then Vanishes\n\nThe late-90s genre/trend with the unfortunate tag of \"neo-soul\" tended more toward inoffensively slick lifestyle music than anything that would've blown Curtis Mayfield's wig back. But when he recorded his sophomore album, virtuosic Virginia rasper D'Angelo hit on a miasmic, woozy groove that somehow sustained itself for an hour-plus without breaking character long enough for anything particularly radio-friendly to escape from the murk. Even when Method Man and Redman turned up on \"Left & Right\", they were there for funky texture, not fill-in-the-blank name value. Voodoo felt like a soft, sexy bomb dropped on the neo-soul landscape, and none of D'Angelo's competitors ever equaled it-- though Erykah Badu came close on the same year's Mama's Gun. But then D'Angelo disappeared almost completely, only contributing the odd guest vocal in the intervening years. He was arrested several times throughout the decade, as rumors of drug addiction swirled. There is still no Voodoo follow-up. --TB\n\n__September 5\n\n__\n\nRyan Adams Goes Solo With Heartbreaker\n\nFollowing the breakup of his band Whiskeytown, Ryan Adams released his first solo record, Heartbreaker, on the Chicago alt-country label Bloodshot. The emotionally devastating album seemed to herald the arrival of a serious talent. But Gold, Adams' 2001 major-label follow-up, was muddled and bloated by comparison, though it did gain Adams some mainstream traction, particularly thanks to the anthemic \"New York, York\", which took on an elegiac quality following 9/11. After that, Adams went on to have an exceedingly weird decade. He dated starlets, publicly tangled with rock critics, blogged incessantly, and released more music than any sane person should attempt. More recently, he married Mandy Moore and claimed he was quitting music, which didn't really happen. --TB\n\nSeptember 7\n\nEminem Brings an Army of Shadys to the VMAs\n\nWhen Eminem dropped the joke-rap bomb \"The Real Slim Shady\" on MTV's Video Music Awards, the mob of bleach-headed clones he brought with him seemed to underscore the song's strongest lines: \"There's a million of us just like me, who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me.\" At the time, Em's stratospheric success seemed like a game-changer: A white rapper with a titanic crossover audience as well as actual skills and credibility and the ability to scare the piss out of parents. Commentators warned that white rappers could steal rap away from black America, that Em could be rap's Elvis. Em got away with lyrical murder (literally) while most critics gave him a pass on seriously repellent homophobic and misogynist lyrics because he delivered them with such force and inventiveness. When Eminem stepped onstage at the 2001 Grammys with Elton John, it seemed like a totally inadequate olive branch, and still we didn't care because dude was on such a roll. But Em's nearly Michael Jackson-level of dominance didn't last long. After the success of his Oscar-winning 2002 film-star turn 8 Mile, Em, once one of rap's most joyous word junkies, seemed to give up entirely, swapping out actual wit for fart jokes. Eventually, he disappeared for years while struggling with addiction. When the shock-rap comeback attempt Relapse appeared 2009, it felt like little more than an aftershock. --TB\n\nOctober 3\n\nKid A Released, Debuts at #1\n\nBased on the worldwide hyperbolic century-end praise for 1997's OK Computer, the anticipation for the Oxford band's follow-up was astronomical. Safe to say: it delivered. I remember waiting in line at a midnight sale (remember those?) at a local Wherehouse Music (and those?!)-- and I wasn't alone. Though the album traded in Pink Floyd-style epic rock for something more insular and outlandish-- blaring horns! Aphex blips! Thom Yorke's voice trapped in an icebox!-- it still zoomed to number one in several countries including the U.S., where it sold 207,000 copies in its first week. A true triumph of art and commerce, one of several this band would pull off over the next 10 years. --Ryan Dombal\n\nR.I.P.\n\nDoris Coley (singer, the Shirelles) - Aug. 2, 1941 - Feb. 4, 2000\n\nChristopher \"Big Pun\" Rios (rapper) - Nov. 9, 1971 - Feb. 7, 2000\n\nJalacy \"Screamin' Jay\" Hawkins (blues shock-rocker) - Jul. 18, 1929 - Feb. 12, 2000\n\nDennis Danell (bassist/guitarist, Social Distortion) - Jun. 24, 1961 - Feb. 29, 2000\n\nIan Dury (pub/punk) - May 12, 1942 - Mar. 27, 2000\n\nBenjamin Orr (bassist and singer, the Cars) - Sep. 8, 1947 - Oct. 3, 2000\n\nRobert Earl \"DJ Screw\" Davis, Jr. (producer and DJ) - Jul. 20, 1971 - Nov. 16, 2000\n\nKirsty MacColl (singer) - Oct. 10, 1959 - Dec. 18, 2000\n\nRock'n'Roll Not Dead Once Again\n\nAfter being threatened to extinction by oh-so-terrible forces like pop and hip-hop and dance music, \"real rock\"-- you know, made by people that wrote their own songs, acted cool, sometimes wore synchronized outfits, and usually used \"the\" at the beginning of their band's names-- came roaring back. Or at least that was what certain corners of the music press wanted you to believe. As with any trend, there were groups that made it look like a justifiable musical movement (the Strokes, the White Stripes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and those that made it look like a media-inflated hype-a-thon (the Vines, the Hives). --RD\n\nDamon Albarn Carves a Path Away From Blur\n\nIf Gorillaz was the only thing Damon Albarn did all decade, he'd still be a major player. The two records by the cartoon band dreamed up by Albarn and visual artist Jamie Hewlett not only wound up selling millions worldwide, but each went platinum in the U.S.-- something that you can't come close to saying about a Blur record. And yet Albarn's most important contribution to this decade's music isn't so much his and Hewlett's post-modern playful creation but Albarn's transformation into a sort of pan-global ambassador/everyman, a David Byrne of the 21st century. Whether collaborating with Malian artists, jacking Jamaican sounds, releasing an Afrobeat-inspired single with Blur, adopting North African atmospherics on that band's sole 2000s LP (Think Tank), or penning a Chinese opera, Albarn spent much of the decade in tune to just about everywhere but his homeland of England. It was an ironic career shift for a guy best known as a Britpop pioneer. For good measure, his best record of the decade probably was his lament for his crumbling home-- The Good Bad and the Queen, co-starring the Clash's Paul Simonon, the Verve's Simon Tong, and Nigerian drummer Tony Allen. Just don't call them a band; Damon doesn't like that for some reason. --SP\n\nPhoto by Cody Smyth\n\nAt this point, it's hard to remember what the music hype cycle was like before the internet. For one thing, it was slower. And it was defined by a solid wall between industry types-- who could set their agenda-- and fans. But at the beginning of the decade, with online chatter ramping up and leak culture becoming more and more prevalent, the space between \"I saw this great new band open for so-and-so\" and \"I like their earlier stuff better\" became almost non-existent. One of the first bands to run through this hyperdrive spin cycle was the Strokes, five privileged New Yorkers who came fully-formed: the look, the sound, the names, the songs, they had it all. Only a few months passed between the January 2001 release of their debut EP The Modern Age and the release of their first full-length, Is This It?, but in that time it seemed like they'd gone through a lifetime's worth of travails, expectations, and disappointments. Then the LP came out, and it killed. The hype was right. This time. --RD\n\nMarch\n\nAt the Drive-In Break Up\n\nAfter toiling in the underground for much of the 90s, Texas post-hardcore band At the Drive-In finally broke through with their 2000 album Relationship of Command and its blistering single \"One Armed Scissor\". Then they broke up. Huge bummer. The principals split into two bands: the disappointingly staid Sparta and the hysterically prog Mars Volta, who made never-ending, genre-bending music that would make Yes jealous. --RD\n\nMarch 25\n\nBjörk Reinvents Oscar Fashion\n\nOf course Björk did the Academy Awards her way. While she didn't win the Oscar for her song \"I've Seen It All\" from Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, the singer's swan dress was markedly more memorable than any trophy. (For the record, Bob Dylan won Best Original Song that year.) And while she showed off remarkable acting chops in her starring role in Dancer in the Dark, Björk didn't have any problems dismissing Hollywood. In fact, her only other acting credit of the decade (besides her ever-remarkable music videos) was for a role in partner Matthew Barney's art house epic, Drawing Restraint 9. Uncompromising comes in various shapes and sizes, and Björk has tried them all on. --RD\n\nApril 15\n\nJoey Ramone Dies\n\nRamones frontman Joey Ramone never really changed his look or his sound too much throughout his three-decade career. He was a punk, plain and simple, a living embodiment of the fuck-you attitude that defined the genre and culture. But the Ramones didn't totally dismiss what came before them. They knew that rock'n'roll could be fun and put that same sense of goofball joy to the fore. Importantly, the Ramones represented more than a music style or uniformed appearance-- they represented great songwriting. At this point, bursts like \"Blitzkreig Bop\" and \"I Wanna Be Sedated\" are as ubiquitous and influential as any Beatles song. Joey's death from cancer was followed by bassist Dee Dee's a year later, and guitarist Johnny's in 2004. --RD\n\nMay 15\n\nWeezer Return With The Green Album\n\nNot long after dropping 1996's Pinkerton, Weezer faded into inactivity, widely thought to be washed-up post-grungers. Then a funny thing happened: indie kids and pre-eyeliner emo scenesters adopted Pinkerton as a lost classic, with songs like \"El Scorcho\" and \"Pink Triangle\" showing up with increasing frequency on mixtapes for lonely hearts. So when Weezer returned for a triumphant 2000 comeback tour, the world was ready. And then came the new album nobody thought Weezer would make. The cover art stoked anticipation even further, echoing Weezer's classic 1994 debut \"Blue Album\", but the end result was...just OK. It had a couple of decent songs, but it wasn't anywhere near the level of the band's first two albums. Sadly, \"just OK\" would prove to be Weezer 2.0's ceiling. --TB\n\nJune 28\n\n__Jay-Z Feuds With Nas\n\n__\n\nAt the New York radio station Hot 97's annual Summer Jam concert, Jay-Z brought Michael Jackson out on stage as a special guest. Then, somehow, he topped that. \"The Takeover\", the new song Jay debuted that night, was a brutal evisceration of Queens duo Mobb Deep, and it ended with this taunt: \"You guys don't want it with Hov / Ask Nas, he don't want it with Hov.\" But Jay's fellow NYC rap titan did, in fact, want it with Hov. What followed was arguably the greatest rap beef of all time, two genuine icons at the peak of their powers just going nuts on each other. When Jay's album The Blueprint came out a few months later, it had a new verse, directed at Nasir Jones: \"Had a spark when you started but now you're just garbage.\" Nas responded with the furious, splenetic return volley \"Ether\", a song so potent that its name has since become a verb: \"You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan.\" Jay-Z responded with the freestyle \"Super Ugly\". And on it went until 2005, when the pair reconciled. Guest appearances on each others' records soon followed. In 2006, Jay, then president of Def Jam, signed Nas, thus making himself Nas's boss. So, uh, yeah, Jay-Z won. --TB\n\n__July\n\n__\n\n__Microhouse and the New Minimalism\n\n__\n\nIn the 1990s, electronic music was mutating rapidly, spurred on by rapid changes in communication and technology (as well as journalists hoping to put their stamp on a new sound). New sub-genres seemed to spring up almost weekly, a trend that would continue in the 00s. One of the most enduring sounds in underground electronic music during this decade involved rhythms influenced by house but rendered in a lean, stripped-down setting with vast amounts of musical space. Inspired by 90s experiments by German artists like Basic Channel and Wolfgang Voigt's Studio 1, this music, exemplified early on by the work of Thomas Brinkmann and Luomo, was known for skeletal percussion often sourced from small glitches or bits of static and dub-influenced basslines. In the July 2001 issue of UK music magazine The Wire, writer (and later Pitchfork contributor) Philip Sherburne coined the name \"microhouse\" as an umbrella term for the developing aesthetic. The moniker proved unusually enduring as later artists like Ricardo Villalobos and Isolée took some of the basic ideas into new realms. --Mark Richardson\n\nJuly 3\n\n\"This Is My Big Sister Meg\": The White Stripes Go Overground\n\nPhoto by Autumn de Wilde\n\nAfter toiling in Detroit's garage rock scene for four years, in July 2001, the White Stripes released their breakthrough album, White Blood Cells. Jack and Meg White used gimmickry to get noticed, relying on a cartoon aesthetic marked by peppermint-colored clothes and instruments, as well as a fabricated backstory claiming they were brother and sister (they were later revealed to be ex-spouses). But behind the cutesy photos and silly mythmaking was a batch of no-joke songs that offered plenty of sticking power. Meanwhile, music video visionary Michel Gondry's instantly iconic clip for \"Fell in Love With a Girl\" perfectly mirrored the band's combination of old-school charm and new-school finesse. --RD\n\n__July\n\n__\n\nNapster Shuts Down\n\nIn June 1999, a college student named Shawn Fanning created Napster, a file-sharing service that allowed users to upload and download music for free. Anyone with a fast internet connection-- at that time, college students in particular-- went nuts, gorging themselves on all of the mp3s their computers could handle. Within a few months, the RIAA started filing lawsuits, and Fanning briefly became tremendously famous. In April 2000, Metallica even sued the company for copyright infringement. But Napster was too good to last, and by summer 2001, the legal system had succeeded in getting Napster to shut down its servers, after just two years of wreaking havoc on the music business. Attempts to relaunch Napster as a pay service failed, though its latest incarnation, as a Best Buy-owned subscription service started in spring 2009, is still too young to assess. But the RIAA couldn't stop what Napster started, and harder-to-trace, decentralized sharing services soon took its place. Eight years after Napster's shutdown, the record industry is teetering on the brink of collapse, and we can in part both thank and blame Napster for that. --TB\n\nAugust 25\n\nAaliyah Dies in Plane Crash\n\nAaliyah Dana Haughton, one of the greatest R&B singers of her generation, was just 22 when she died. She only had time to release three studio albums, but Aaliyah radiated a sense of mystery and an icy poise that very few stars have ever managed. Aaliyah was the ideal vessel for Timbaland's furthest-out production ideas on tracks like \"We Need a Resolution\" and \"Try Again\", simultaneously projecting a robotic cool and an emotional warmth. Just weeks after releasing her gorgeous self-titled album, Aaliyah finished filming the video for the single \"Rock the Boat\" and boarded a small, overloaded plane from the Bahamas to Florida. The plane crashed, and all nine people on board died. Aaliyah's death has been mourned by the hip-hop and R&B worlds ever since. --TB\n\nSeptember 11\n\n9/11: The Musical Response\n\nPop reactions to the tragedy of September 11 were wide-ranging, with the best responding to the events with emotion and insight. Sleater-Kinney's \"Far Way\" and \"Combat Rock\"-- off 2002's staunchly political One Beat-- included jabs at Bush along with more personal lines like, \"I look to the sky and ask it not to rain on my family tonight.\" Bright Eyes' Beethoven-quoting \"Road to Joy\" re-imagined emo posterboy Conor Oberst as a political firebrand in the spirit of early Bob Dylan as he mixed the personal and the topical with throat-popping incredulity. Outkast offered heavy sigh and a brave face on \"The Whole World\". Sampling troublemakers Cassetteboy's \"Fly Me to New York\" was a cruel joke, turning Frank Sinatra into a terrorist, and dancehall star Elephant Man managed to lament both customs hassles and a coming World War in \"The Bombing\". The most-loved reaction came from Bruce Springsteen, whose comeback album with the E Street Band, The Rising, balanced despair and hope in the aftermath of the attacks upon its release in July 2002. --RD\n\nSeptember 18\n\nWilco Stream Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Stoke the Album's Legend*\n\n*\n\nWith the internet's influence on the music industry skyrocketing and the music industry's influence on the music industry plummeting, all anyone needed was a Cinderella tale to encompass everything about the change. Enter Wilco and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. After layoffs and bigwig switches left the band's label, Reprise, a shell of its former self, the new brass rejected Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and gave Wilco the rights to the album. Then the band began streaming the challenging, brilliant album on their website, a full six months before its eventual release, and a week after 9/11-- an event songs like \"Ashes of American Flags\" seemed to eerily anticipate. Soon, Wilco signed to Nonesuch, a label which, like Reprise, is a subsidiary of Warner Bros. So, as the piercing and beautiful documentary I Am Trying to Break Your Heart would make clear, Warner ultimately paid for the same album twice. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot went on to top countless critics' lists and expand the band's fan base, proving that leaks may not be so bad-- and the old industry would have to own up to a more transparent standard in the new millennium. --RD\n\nOctober 23\n\n__The iPod Debuts, Changes the World\n\n__\n\nIt's almost impossible to imagine now, but there was a time before iPods. Back then, people walked around listening to things called Walkmans and Discmans-- which were big and ugly and unreliable...eh, just forget it. The 2001 debut of the 5 GB (!) iPod marked a change in listening habits (people were no longer slaves to a single album or mix) and ushered in the ultimate digital revolution music tool. Of course, with each passing year, the sleek devices got smaller while their capacities skyrocketed. Your mom got one. Maybe even your grandma. And when Apple attached a phone and a tiny computer to the iPod in 2007, the game was officially over. Apple won. --RD\n\nNovember 29\n\nGeorge Harrison R.I.P.\n\nGeorge Harrison succumbed to a fight with cancer, dying on November 29, 2001 in Los Angeles at the age of 58. Known as the \"quiet Beatle,\" Harrison carried himself with dignity and grace even throughout the most tumultuous years of his band's career. Only 16 when he joined John Lennon and Paul McCartney's skiffle group, the Quarrymen, Harrison would eventually make an indelible mark on the Beatles' sound and cultural curiosity. Harrison's experimentation with drugs and interest in American music, shared with John Lennon, greatly colored the first directions the band made after its rock'n'roll and pop years-- Harrison's distinctive Rickenbacker guitar sound was one of the highlights of the band's middle period. He also made the band's earliest forays into political statements and his interest in Indian culture resulted in a study of the sitar and the Beatles' excursion to explore meditation with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. After returning to the guitar in the late 1960s, Harrison continued to display his songwriting maturity and a smart mind for sociocultural concerns. Of course, his soundtrack work inspired the title of Oasis' \"Wonderwall\", which is arguably his greatest single achievement. Unless you're anyone in the world other than Noel Gallagher. --SP\n\nNovember\n\nBilly Corgan Forms Zwan\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins played their last pre-reboot show in 2000, but Billy Corgan wasn't done. A year later, he formed Zwan, featuring fellow ex-Pumpkin Jimmy Chamberlin, as well as A Perfect Circle bassist Paz Lenchantin and a couple of very serious indie rock guitar-shredders: Matt Sweeney (Chavez), and David Pajo (Slint, Tortoise). Hopes were high, but 2003 debut album Mary Star of the Sea, while not terrible, fell well short of expectations. By the end of 2003, the band was done, and Corgan's long, strange trip through the rest of the decade had begun. --TB\n\nR.I.P.\n\nJames Carr (soul singer) - Jun. 13, 1942 - Jan. 7, 2001\n\nJohn Fahey (guitarist) - Feb. 28, 1939 - Feb. 22, 2001\n\n\"Papa\" John Phillips (singer, the Mamas & the Papas) - Aug. 30, 1935 - Mar. 18, 2001\n\nJohn Lee Hooker (bluesman) - Aug. 22, 1917 - Jun. 21, 2001\n\nChet Atkins (country guitarist, producer) - Jun. 20, 1924 - Jun. 30, 2001\n\nAnthony \"Too Poetic\" Berkeley (rapper, Gravediggaz) - Nov. 15, 1964 - Jul. 15, 2001\n\nStuart Adamson (singer, guitarist, Big Country) - April 11, 1958 - Dec. 16, 2001\n\nThe Music Industry Sings the Praises of Reality Shows\n\nEventually it had to happen: Reality show craze meets music industry. Kickstarted by Simon Fuller in the UK, \"Pop Idol\" would spawn a host of other entries in the \"Idol\" franchise, plus other shows like \"Popstars: The Rivals\" and \"X Factor\". Ostensibly, the programs existed to give the people the power to make their own stars, but the pool of would-be singers were screened and pre-chosen, often fitting into pre-conceived notions of acceptable light entertainment. Let's face it, shows like this and competitive dancing programs are closer in spirit to sporting events for their viewers than they are music programs. So \"Idol\" created stars, but typically they were TV ones at heart, and short-lived as either musical forces or personalities-- as Tom Ewing said in his look at pop in this decade: \"The triumphant coronation of a new winner is also the end of the narrative that made them.\" Rather than kingmaking, the \"Idol\" franchise was more evidence that the music industry this decade often broke new acts easiest when it worked with other, established industries-- see Guitar Hero, Dance Dance Revolution, and Rock Band. And for the strictly indie-inclined, see advertisements (Feist's iPod ad, among others), film (M.I.A., the Shins, etc.), TV (Death Cab for Cutie and other \"O.C.\" guests.) In the end, reality shows gave us one truly great pop act (Girls Aloud), helped launch the career of another highly tolerated pop star (Kelly Clarkson), but weirdly had their greatest longterm U.S. success in rock (Daughtry) and country (Carrie Underwood). --SP\n\nMashups Clash Genres, Song Titles\n\nThe proliferation of MP3s and cheap audio software made it all too easy for open-eared listeners to fuck with genre conventions by throwing two songs together and seeing what happens. Coupled with the instant-nostalgia and novelty allure of WTF combos like the Strokes and Christina Aguilera, the Hives and TLC, and Kylie Minogue using New Order's \"Blue Monday\" to back her hit \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" at a 2002 BRIT Awards performance, mashups turned into a veritable genre of their own. Producers like 2 Many DJs, Richard X, and Freelance Hellraiser helped popularize mashups, but the style found its generation-spanning touchstone with the Beatles/Jay-Z-flipping Grey Album courtesy of Danger Mouse in 2004, and its ADD-addled wunderkind with the sample-busting style of Girl Talk. While the instant pleasures of most mashups aren't built for longevity, they mirror today's shuffling listening habits with a wink and a pat on the back. --RD\n\nIsobel Campbell Leaves Belle and Sebastian\n\nPhoto by Marisa Privitera\n\nAfter a few years of internal friction and a bit of an identity crisis, Belle and Sebastian lost founding member, multi-instrumentalist, and vocalist Isobel Campbell. The move turned out to be advantageous for all involved: The departure of Campbell-- two years after the departure of another key member, bassist Stuart David-- helped complete the band's transformation from a group of Glaswegian musicians charged with fleshing out the bedroom songs of leader Stuart Murdoch to a more democratized version of the same, with members fleshing out one another's projects as a committed, full-time enterprise. The remaining members soon went on to sign with the legendary Rough Trade, work with famed pop producer Trevor Horn, and-- after years of shying away from the press, refusing to release singles from their albums, and ragtagging it through many of their live shows-- emerged as a more traditional band, working within more typical music industry promotional and touring schedules and transforming themselves from one the world's best indie collectives into one of the world's best indie bands. (The ending of Murdoch and Campbell's longtime romantic relationship also gave us one of Belle and Sebastian's best songs of the decade, \"I'm Waking Up to Us\". Allegedly. Nobody involved has copped to that yet.) Campbell, too, had a happy ending, shrugging off the \"twee\" albatross that followed her even more closely than it did B&S and going on to make the best music of her career to date, most notably alongside former Screaming Trees singer Mark Lanegan-- their Ballad of the Broken Seas was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Prize. --SP\n\nFebruary 8\n\nThe R. Kelly Sex Tape Fiasco\n\n\"Chicago police are investigating whether R&B superstar R. Kelly had sex with an underage girl and videotaped the illegal act,\" wrote Jim DeRogatis and Abdon M. Pallasch in the Chicago Sun-Times on February 8, 2002, breaking the story to the world. \"The sex acts include intercourse, fellatio and urination.\" Six years later, on June 13, 2008, Kelly was found not guilty of child pornography charges. In between, the saga took several ugly turns and offered twists that could fill several \"Trapped in the Closet\" chapters. (The trial was delayed at different points due to Kelly's burst appendix and a judge's fall from a ladder). Meanwhile, Kelly continued to make some of his most memorable hits, forcing people to decide whether they could separate the man's music from his alleged crimes. --RD\n\nSummer\n\nThe Rapture Teach the Indie Kids to Dance\n\nThe New York band the Rapture had been injecting their howlingly urgent postpunk clamor with disco beats for a few years, but the \"House of Jealous Lovers\" single, their first collaboration with the production duo DFA, was the moment the fusion really became complete. The cowbell anthem took hipster dance nights by storm in the summer of 2002. The dance-punk movement that followed brought bands like !!!, Out Hud, and Radio 4 to the ears of formerly rhythm-averse indie rockers, and its aftershocks could be felt in later trends like nu-rave and bloghouse. The Rapture's Echoes album came out in 2003 and proved that \"House of Jealous Lovers\" was no fluke. But it was the DFA who really prospered. Over the years, their eponymous label became one of the strongest dance labels going. And James Murphy, one half of the duo, found cult stardom fronting LCD Soundsystem, turning his cranky-elder musings into something sublime. --TB\n\nSummer\n\nBrooklyn Becomes the Epicenter of Indie\n\nThe release of Broken Social Scene's breakthrough LP, You Forgot It In People, didn't just launch a band or a scene or an entire strain of indie rock. It launched a whole country. It forced people to pay attention to Canada-- and especially Toronto-- as an independent powerhouse. In the middle of the decade, it seemed like every other Pitchfork review was somehow orbiting around the BSS axis, from Stars to Feist to Metric to Do Make Say Think and so on. Not to mention non-BSS-associated Canadians who were to follow, including Final Fantasy, Tokyo Police Club, Death From Above 1979, Crystal Castles, and some group called Arcade Fire. All of a sudden, \"Canadian band\" was anything but a pejorative. --RD\n\nOctober 30\n\nJam Master Jay Gunned Down\n\nJason Mizell, better known as Jam Master Jay, was the DJ for Run-DMC, one of the first rap groups ever to achieve crossover success. Although Jay didn't rap, he was treated as an equal by his bandmates, Joseph \"Run\" Simmons and Darryl \"DMC\" McDaniels, and in the public eye. Throughout the 1980s, Run-DMC broke boundaries and dominated the charts with hits like \"My Adidas\", \"It's Tricky\", and the Aerosmith collaboration \"Walk This Way\". By 2002, Run-DMC were doing well for themselves on the touring circuit, and Jay was mentoring an up-and-coming Queens rapper named 50 Cent. But one evening, as Jay worked in his Queens studio, a still-yet-unidentified person shot him and killed him, also shooting and wounding another man. In 2007, police arrested Ronald \"Tenad\" Washington, on suspicion of being an accomplice to Jam Master Jay's murder. --TB\n\nDecember 22\n\n__The Clash's Joe Strummer, R.I.P.\n\n__\n\nIn the late 70s and early 80s, the Clash's Joe Strummer was arguably rock's most important voice: wrathful, impassioned, cosmopolitan, proletarian, even joyous. With his band, Strummer effectively turned punk rock from a thrilling youth-culture moment to a full-on movement, transforming its nihilism and negation into righteous rage. Even after the Clash broke up, Strummer cut an enormously likable figure, whether he was turning up in Jim Jarmusch's Mystery Train or leading his folk-punk band the Mescaleros. So when an undiagnosed heart defect killed Strummer at the age of 50, it was both a tragedy and a shock. Strummer always seemed too alive to die. --TB\n\nR.I.P.\n\nZac Foley (bassist, EMF) - Dec. 9, 1970 - Jan. 3, 2002\n\nDave Van Ronk (folk singer) - Jun. 30, 1936 - Feb. 10, 2002)\n\nWaylon Jennings (outlaw country singer) - Jun. 15, 1937 - Feb. 13, 2002\n\nLayne Staley (singer, Alice in Chains) - Aug. 22, 1967 - Apr. 5, 2002\n\nLisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes (singer, TLC) - May 27, 1971 - Apr. 25, 2002\n\nDouglas Glenn \"Dee Dee Ramone\" Colvin (bassist, the Ramones) - Sep. 18, 1951 - Jun. 5, 2002\n\nJohn Entwistle (bassist, the Who) - Oct. 9, 1944 - Jun. 27, 2002\n\nLonnie Donegan (skiffle musician) - Apr. 29, 1931 - Nov. 3, 2002\n\nMary Hansen (singer and instrumentalist, Stereolab) - Nov. 1, 1966 - Dec. 9, 2002\n\nHouston Rap Gets Its Moment\n\nIn 2003, Swisha House released its compilation The Day Hell Broke Loose 2, and introduced the world to the final version of Mike Jones's \"Still Tippin'\", though it took more than a year for that hazy, local-pride anthem to reach nationwide crossover hit status. In the wake of \"Still Tippin'\", Houston briefly emerged as rap's version of circa-1992 Seattle. This was possible because the scene had evolved in isolation for years, nurturing its own legends (Scarface, UGK, Z-Ro), rivalries (Northside vs. Southside), and cult classics (Paul Wall and Chamillionaire's brilliant but little-heard Get Ya Mind Correct). DJ Screw, the man who gave the city its slowed-down, woozy sense of space, died of a cough syrup overdose in 2000, but his psychedelic slow-thud style lived on. Once major label A&Rs started handing out contracts to half the city's rappers, though, Houston lost its sense of underdog purpose, and it never came to replace Atlanta as Southern rap's epicenter. --TB\n\nFebruary 4\n\n50 Cent Turns Bulletholes Into Marketing Gold\n\nAt the 2003 VMAs, Chris Rock had an extended riff about how all anyone knew or cared about 50 Cent was the fact that he'd been shot nine times. And it's true: When 50's star was on the rise, it was impossible to talk about the man's music without mentioning the shooting that almost ended his life. Even weirder was how the shooting affected 50's music and helped him transcend regional boundaries. The bullet in his mouth, for instance, changed his delivery, giving a Southern-sounding slurry lisp to what had been a rangy New York mixtape-rapper bark. In many ways, though, 50 was a complete commercial package, marrying good looks and impeccable pop instincts to genuinely threatening gangster snarls that you had to take seriously because, after all, the guy issuing them had been shot nine times. Get Rich or Die Tryin', 50's hugely popular debut, combined indelible hooks with guttural gun-talk better than any album this decade. Millions upon millions of albums later, the fame went to 50's head, and he completely lost track of whatever people liked about him in the first place. When 50 lost his much-publicized 2007 release-date duel to Kanye West, it became painfully obvious that he'd played his shtick out. These days, 50 couldn't get us to care about him even if he got shot again. --TB\n\nFebruary 19\n\nThe Postal Service Delivers\n\nThe Postal Service's debut (and, so far, only) album, Give Up, arrived at the height of indie rock's flirtation with blips and bloops. Labels like Morr Music, Bpitch Control, and Plug Research, and artists such as Four Tet, M83, and Caribou (then Manitoba) stood on the cutting edge, but it was Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello's collaboration through the mail that brought lap-pop to the masses. Give Up became a runaway hit-- the biggest seller in Sub Pop's history since Nirvana's Bleach-- and Gibbard began his ascent to heartthrob status. An unintentionally hilarious biproduct of the band's success came in August 2003, when the Postal Service were served a cease and desist for copyright infringement by the actual U.S. Postal Service. The matter was resolved when Gibbard and Tamborello agreed to do promotion work for the USPS, including a performance at postmasters' conference in 2004. However, the friendship between the Postal Services didn't last forever: in early 2007, \"Such Great Heights\" turned up in a television commercial for gasp! UPS. --Amy Phillips\n\nJune 24\n\nLiz Phair Sells Out\n\nBy the time Liz Phair released her fourth album, she was already far removed from the scrappy lo-fi of her classic debut, Exile in Guyville. The two albums she put out in between were plenty polished-- and plenty controversial-- but the blatant pop grab of 2003's Liz Phair raised hackles like few other records this decade. Between the partnership with Avril Lavigne producers the Matrix and the cougar-riffic lyrics, fans recoiled in horror at the spectacle of the onetime queen of indie shilling for the TRL masses. Pitchfork gave the album a 0.0; The New York Times called it \"an embarrassing form of career suicide.\" Liz Phair was a modest commercial success, earning Phair slots on a Now That's What I Call Music! comp and on various chick flick soundtracks, but it certainly didn't catapult her to mainstream stardom. Phair's follow-up album, 2005's Somebody's Miracle, was also terrible, a mushy mess of adult contemporary coffeeshop crap, and it tanked. In 2008, she tried to earn back some goodwill by reissuing Exile in Guyville and playing the album in its entirety on tour. --AP\n\nJuly 20\n\nThree Exploding Hearts Die in Van Crash\n\nThe Exploding Hearts were a young Portland pop-punk band with a furiously fun debut album called Guitar Romantic to their credit. They had tons of promise, but three of the band's four members were tragically killed in when their tour van flipped over near Eugene, Oregon. Only guitarist Terry Six and manager Rachelle Ramos survived the crash. The next year, Six formed another band called the Nice Boys, and it's simply amazing that the guy still wants anything to do with music. --TB\n\nAugust 5\n\n__\"The O.C.\" Brings Indie Rock to Teen TV\n\n__\n\nThe modern era of indie rock television music licensing began with the trashtastic Fox television show \"The O.C.\". The high school soap opera featured a nerdy, neurotic Death Cab for Cutie fan as one of its main characters, a live music venue within the show that showcased the likes of Modest Mouse and the Walkmen, and a steady stream of wistful tunes soundtracking breakup scenes and what-does-it-all-mean? montages. \"The O.C.\" ended in February 2007, but by fall 2007, its creators had moved their musical sensibilities over to the even more trashtastic CW show \"Gossip Girl\". With old-media means of marketing music losing ground faster and faster, a spot on the soundtrack to a popular TV show became more and more coveted. --AP\n\nSeptember 1\n\nThe Dismemberment Plan Break Up\n\nAfter announcing their breakup and their goodbye tour on their website a few months before, these wordy post-punk flailers played their last show, at the 9:30 Club in their hometown of Washington, D.C. And then, true to their word, that was it, other than a 2007 reunion benefit show at the Black Cat. In their wake, the Plan left a great legacy: Four near-perfect albums, hundreds of deliriously fun live shows, too many gloriously drawn-out renditions of \"OK Joke's Over\" to count. And then came Travistan. Not everybody agreed that frontman Travis Morrison's 2004 solo debut deserved the 0.0 that Pitchfork laid on it, but the album did manage to disappoint just about everyone to some degree. Earlier this year, Morrison posted a note on his website announcing that he was retiring from music. --TB\n\nSeptember 9\n\nPixies Reunite\n\nIt's worth watching director Mark Romanek's brutal video for Johnny Cash's \"Hurt\" once more. Like, right now. Quite easily one of the best music videos ever made, its juxtaposition of Cash's present (shaky, craggy, unquestionably old) with his past (strong, towering, seemingly without end) makes it as affecting as going through your own grandfather's photo album. Cash was America's badass, he could come from nowhere else. He was unstoppable until he wasn't. Johnny Cash's voice sounded like God's. Or maybe it was the other way around. --RD\n\nOctober 21\n\nElliott Smith Dies\n\nPhoto by Paul Heartfield\n\nThe beloved fragile-voiced singer-songwriter had spent years battling addiction and depression when his girlfriend found him dead in their Los Angeles apartment of two stab wounds to the chest. L.A. police were never able to confirm that Smith actually committed suicide, but there's no real evidence of a murder. If Smith did, in fact, take his own life, he did it by just about the most horrific means imaginable. Since Smith's death, we've heard two albums of unreleased material, and rumor has it that there's a ton more out there somewhere. But even if we never hear another note of the man's work, the elegantly rendered confessionals he recorded are legacy enough for anyone. --TB\n\nAutumn\n\nM.I.A. Releases \"Galang\", Worms Her Way Into Our Brains\n\nLate in 2003, a white-label single from an unknown singer with a then-unGoogleable name started making the internet rounds. The song existed at some previously unexplored intersection of dancehall and electro and Southern rap, and the singer sounded like she could come from anywhere; we knew nothing about her. Eventually, details surfaced: She was a Sri Lankan-born London art student, she was friends with Elastica, and, yup, her father was a Tamil Tiger, a part of the violent Sri Lankan separatist movement. It was that last detail that everyone seized on, especially M.I.A. herself. She seemed to knowingly bait controversy, filling the \"Galang\" video with cartoon war imagery and naming her debut album Arular, after her father's code name. It was hard to tell exactly what she was saying with this stuff, but it made her impossible to forget. Years later, she's a star, but she's still as elusive as ever. --TB\n\nDecember 13\n\nJack White Punches Von Bondies Dude, Breaks From Detroit\n\nThough Jack White said his fabled beating of former friend and Von Bondies leader Jason Stollsteimer was exaggerated, the incident served as a pretty clear marker of the singer-guitarist breaking away from his Detroit roots in search of something more. He found it in the South, where he produced Loretta Lynn's comeback LP Van Lear Rose, and eventually settled down with both his home and his Third Man label. Detroit's garage scene imploded without its star attraction, but White embraced his star power with wit, reverence, and new interests like the Raconteurs and the Dead Weather.\n\nFreak Folk Weirds Out the Normals\n\nIt's just like your parents' hippie folk, except not. There are drugs, acoustic guitars, and beards. But there are also harps, androgyny, and a sneaking sense that peace and love may not conquer after all. It unofficially kicked off in early 2004 when the Devendra Banhart-curated compilation The Golden Apples of the Sun featured Joanna Newsom, Iron and Wine, Antony, Espers, Vetiver, and freak folk godmother Vashti Bunyan all on one, scene-defining disc. (As a testament to the musical trend's cult nature, the 1,000-copy limited-edition release was only available via Arthur Magazine.) The genre would continue to expand as the decade progressed, with a handful of Finnish musicians, many centered about the label Fonal, producing excellent psych-folk. Eventually, like electroclash and dance-punk before it and nu-rave later, the sounds of freak-folk would simply become embedded in indie's DNA sans labels and smoothed out, going overground over the course of the second half of the decade via folk-leaning artists such as Sufjan Stevens, Bon Iver, and Fleet Foxes. --RD\n\nPost-Punk Gets Its Due\n\nConsidering it took 15 years for punk to \"finally break\" in the U.S. in 1992 via Nirvana, it was only natural that post-punk would finally grip these shores another decade later. The genre originally combated punk's hard-line philosophies and genre clichés-- and the notion that rock had hit a dead end and 1977 was a Year Zero-- by melding rock with disparate genres like dub, funk, dance, and new wave. By the middle of the 2000s, its seemed like every new band had brushed up on bands like Joy Division, Television, and Gang of Four. The result was an onslaught that included Franz Ferdinand, Interpol, the Killers, Bloc Party, Futureheads, and Maxïmo Park. In the post-punk spirit, many of those bands have dabbled in different musical styles since-- including goth, epic rock, electro. --RD\n\nFebruary\n\nDanger Mouse Releases The Grey Album\n\nAt the end of 2004's MTV-produced Super Bowl halftime show, Justin Timberlake finished up \"Rock Your Body\" by ripping away half of Janet Jackson's futuristic fetish-wear bra thing, giving the entire universe a full half-second of unobstructed pierced celebrity tit. And then: total insanity. Everyone blamed everyone else, the FCC levied titanic fines wherever it could, and we got two years of totally bland boomer-fave halftime shows (until Prince totally kicked ass in 2007). Timberlake's career recovered nicely-- he even coined the phrase \"wardrobe malfunction\"-- but Jackson's never did, though this may or may not have something to do with Timberlake, unlike Jackson, going on to release actual good music. As usual, The Onion said it best: \"U.S. Children Still Traumatized One Year After Seeing Partially Exposed Breast on TV\". (Also: the Patriots won. Again.) --TB\n\nFebruary 10\n\nKanye West Drops College Dropout, New Hip-Hop Era Is Born\n\nIt's hard to believe now, but there was a time when it looked like The College Dropout would never even come out. Even after producing standouts like \"Takeover\" and \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\" off Jay-Z's The Blueprint, Kanye West was a risky proposition, and his debut seemed destined to be another \"delayed to infinity\" cautionary tale. After all, he was \"the first nigga with a Benz and a backpack,\" the guy who didn't see anything wrong with putting both Ludacris and Talib Kweli on his LP or switching from goofball sexism to insular self-examination to God with barely a breath in between. And after stealing \"Slow Jamz\" from Twista and Jamie Foxx with some black or white Mike Jackson talk, Dropout finally got the green light. He made post-gangster rap a universal concern; he hasn't looked back since. --RD\n\nMarch 9\n\nDance Music Distributor EFA Shuts Down\n\nDance music only really works when DJs can get their hands on shiny black records. That became a lot harder when the German vinyl distributor EFA filed for bankruptcy, a move that had a deflating and almost decimating effect on the techno world. EFA's closure wreaked havoc on a number of dance labels. Chief among them was the German minimal techno label family Force Inc. (Force Tracks, Mille Plateaux, among others), which shut down soon after. --TB\n\n__June 10\n\n__\n\n__Ray Charles, R.I.P.\n\n__\n\nAn impossibly broad term like \"American music\" could almost be defined as \"the kind work that Ray Charles made,\" as his restless musical journey found him moving seamlessly between musical worlds in search of new forms of expression. Charles started off in the 1940s and early 50s cutting tough, hooky, and intense sides that helped to define the emerging music known as rhythm and blues. But by the early 60s, he was breaking ground in jazz, country, rock, and pop, with a special talent for breathing life into over-recorded standards. Charles' influence on singers and pianists of every stripe was immense, and he was a serial collaborator, dueting with everyone from jazz singer Betty Carter to Merle Haggard to Van Morrison while recording instrumental jazz with artists like the Modern Jazz Quartet vibraphonist Milt Jackson. By the 80s and 90s, he was more of a pop culture presence-- remember those Diet Pepsi spots?-- than a popular recording artist, but his final studio album, the duet set Genius Loves Company, became his best-selling set ever when released two months after his death. He was 73. --MR\n\nJune 21\n\nLollapalooza Tour Sputters Out, Again\n\nLollapalooza, the Perry Farrell-spawned festival tour that helped introduce alt-rock to mainstream America, had gone dormant since 1997 when Farrell brought it back for a 2003 tour with a deeply awful lineup that paired the reunited Jane's Addiction with Audioslave, Incubus, and Jurassic 5. The next year, though, Farrell planned a tour that would stop for two days in each city it visited, and he built a truly impressive lineup that included Morrissey, the Flaming Lips, Sonic Youth, Wilco, PJ Harvey, Modest Mouse, TV on the Radio, the Killers, and Le Tigre. If Farell had pulled this tour off, it would've been incredible. But after poor ticket sales, Farrell announced that all dates on the tour had been cancelled. When Lolla returned in 2005, it was as a two-day festival in Chicago, not a tour. --TB\n\nJuly 28\n\nZach Braff Changes the Shins' Life\n\nZach Braff, filling out forms in a waiting room, looks quizzically at Natalie Portman, who's in full pixie-sprite mode: \"What are you listening to?\" Portman: \"The Shins. You know them?\" Braff, looking weirdly disappointed: \"No.\" Portman: \"You gotta hear this one song. They'll change your life, I swear.\" A few seconds of cute chatter, and then cue \"New Slang\", along with doe-eyed stares. That scene, from Garden State, marked the unassuming Portland-via-Albuquerque band's ascension to next-generation mix-CD staple. It also became just about the most overused blog punchline of the decade. For longtime fans, it was simultaneously a delightful and appalling cinematic moment. \"New Slang\" is still a great song, but we'll never hear it the same way again. Thanks, Zach Braff. --TB\n\nAugust 8\n\nDave Matthews Pollutes (Literally This Time)\n\nRemember when the fall 2004 Vote for Change tour, featuring Bruce Springsteen, R.E.M., Pearl Jam, Death Cab for Cutie, Bright Eyes, My Morning Jacket, and others, convinced everybody to vote for John Kerry, who was then elected President of the United States, and the next four years were full of nothing but peace, prosperity, and patriotism? Neither do we. --AP\n\nSeptember 28\n\nBrian Wilson Finally Releases Smile\n\nAxl Rose may have taken his time with Chinese Democracy, but the guy's got nothing on Brian Wilson, who finally released his opus Smile nearly four decades after starting it in 1966. And, unlike the bloated Guns N' Roses record, Smile was worth the insane wait. The return was one of many highlights in a banner decade for Wilson, relatively out of the woods after years of silence, sub-par material, and seclusion. He took the Beach Boys' masterwork Pet Sounds out on the road for fans old and new. And his hazy, harmony-laden influence was felt throughout indie music, from Panda Bear's layered compositions to the New Pornographers' vocal theatrics. Classic rock comeback wannabes-- take notes. --RD\n\nOctober 23\n\nAshlee Simpson Lip-Syncs on \"Saturday Night Live\"\n\nWhile it's no secret that backing vocal tracks are often used during TV tapings to augment a singer's voice, usually the backing vocals and the live vocals actually, you know, match up. That wasn't the case when Ashlee Simpson launched into her track \"Autobiography\" on \"SNL\" in 2004 and the pre-recorded \"guide\" track started playing another song entirely. It was an insanely embarrassing moment, but one that probably wouldn't have blown up completely without blogs, which turned the pop-star-being-a-pop-star calamity into a cringe-worthy dose of schadenfreude for millions. Neither her career nor U.S. teen-pop ever fully recovered. --RD\n\nOctober 25\n\nLegendary DJ John Peel Dies\n\nWhen it came to BBC radio DJ John Peel, taste-making never seemed like a hunt for coolness or the next big thing. Even right before he passed at age 65 from a heart attack, his taste was an ever-evolving, open-eared journey. He never stopped listening, never sat back or exploited his god-like appointments on favorites from the Fall to the White Stripes. In a way, Peel's eclecticism-- everything from pop to metal to dancehall to techno to hip-hop showed up on his show over the years-- predicted today's increasingly genre-less musical environment, where shuffling reigns and crossovers are commonplace. The staggering list of artists who recorded in-studio Peel Sessions over the years-- everyone from Fleetwood Mac, Jimi Hendrix, Elton John, T. Rex, David Bowie, Joy Divison, the Smiths, and R.E.M., to PJ Harvey, the Flaming Lips, Pavement, Belle and Sebastian, Aphex Twin, the Strokes, and Pulp-- is a testament to his ceaseless quest for fine sounds. --RD\n\nNovember 13\n\nOl' Dirty Bastard Dies\n\nOn November 12, the reassembled Wu-Tang Clan played its first full-lineup show in a while, filling up New Jersey's cavernous Continental Airlines Arena. But Ol' Dirty Bastard, the crew's anarchic and frequently incarcerated soul, didn't make it to the show. An incensed Method Man fumed from the stage: \"There's no one bigger than the Clan, and when you see Ol' Dirty Bastard, tell him that.\" The next afternoon, ODB, at work in a Manhattan recording studio, succumbed to a drug overdose, and the Wu-Tang Clan would never be whole again. --TB\n\nDecember\n\nLibertines Break Up; Doherty Attempts Rock Star Cliché Record\n\nCharmingly shambolic British rockers the Libertines lived up to nearly every rock star cliché in existence during their stint as NME superstars in the early 00s. But it's hard to make that many headlines-- drugs! fights! hits!-- while staying together, so their 2004 breakup seemed like a fitting end to their tabloid tale. But, thanks to the exploits of singer Pete Doherty, it turned out to be more like the beginning. If Doherty wasn't being arrested on countless drug charges, he was in rehab or jail, or cavorting with Kate Moss on the cover of UK rags. The decade ended with less sensational headlines about a Doherty solo album and a likely Libertines reunion to go down next year. --RD\n\nDecember\n\nDiplo Turns International Tourism Into Party Music\n\nM.I.A., Annie, and Robyn Make Blog Pop Go Boom\n\nThough it may seem like most music blogs pushed nothing but underground sounds like indie rock and French touch (plus tons of needless covers and remixes), the medium also helped launch a few acts that pushed the boundaries of chart pop-- and actually made a dent on charts worldwide. Among them were one-named Scandinavian stars Annie and Robyn, who infused their beat-based dance pop with plenty of wit and innovation. But the biggest blog-pop crossover was M.I.A., who first found fame on the web thanks to her Piracy Funds Terrorism mixtape with producer Diplo. After a massive wave of acclaim buoyed her first album, Maya Arulpragasam broke through with her hit \"Paper Planes\", which was featured heavily in the trailer for Pineapple Express. Photos with Oprah, collaborations with Jay-Z and Kanye, and a spot on Time's Most Influential list followed. --RD\n\nBlog Bands, For Better or For Worse\n\nWith the infinite possibilities offered by the explosion of the music blogosphere, and the opportunity to explore just about every genre under the sun, why not...just listen to stuff that sounds like all the bands you know you like already? As the internet tools with which to share music--and one's opinion of said music-- became easier to use, there came a retrenchment of a core indie sound. Most \"blog bands\" like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Cold War Kids, Tapes 'n Tapes, Voxtrot, Ghostland Observatory, White Denim, Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin, Sound Team, Birdmonster, What Made Milwaukee Famous, and Anathallo offered immediate rock with clearly defined indie DNA, ready for people who wanted things new and now and newer and nower every single moment, but didn't want to stray too far from their comfort zones. (Beirut and Midlake, to name two, bucked the trend and enojyed their own clearly defined sound.) Much of this stuff was ultimately pretty blah, and when these groups often failed to deliver on follow-up records, the backlash came hard and fast, often from the same places that had championed these artists in the first place. Pitchfork certainly wasn't immune to this trend. --AP\n\nDubstep Darkens London Dancefloors\n\nShades of dubstep ran through the garage continuum since the late 1990s, but it wasn't until the middle of this decade that the sound coalesced into a movement. As far back as 2001, the London club Forward>>> began to focus on this darker, bass-heavy sounds, with its syncopated rhythms and minor-key melodies, but the term didn't become widely used until the next year. Most of the scene's early adopters-- Digital Mystikz, Benga, Skream-- are still making strong music, and by 2005, Kode9's Hyperdub became the preeminent dubstep imprint, eventually issuing records not only by its founder but also newer stars Burial, Darkstar, and Zomby. --SP\n\nR. Kelly Brings Back the Operetta\n\nOf course R. Kelly knows \"Trapped in the Closet\" is funny. The difference between the most innovative and insane R&B star of the decade and everyone else is that he will dare to take that chance. Yeah, he'll put out 22 surreal songs and videos with the same beat that follows a storyline that would satisfy a \"Days of Our Lives\" lifer. He'll make a song called \"In the Kitchen\" that could double as the world's raunchiest lesson in food metaphors. He'll do another one that's basically him arguing with a lady friend on the phone and call it \"Real Talk\". His outlandish behavior sometimes got the best of him, though, like when his tour with Jay-Z imploded apparently due to Kelly's negligence and paranoia. Still, more often than not, the singer's eccentricities continue to keep him relevant 16 years after his debut LP. --RD\n\nJanuary 1\n\nKidz Bop Takes on Modest Mouse\n\nWhen Modest Mouse signed with Sony, it was weird. Nobody expected this twisty, culty Pacific Northwest indie band to put up Nickelback numbers. But when \"Float On\" became a flukey modern-rock radio hit, Sony's gamble actually paid off, and Isaac Brock and co. became something like rock stars. Every further sign of the band's crossover success seemed more surreal than the last. A platinum plaque for Good News for People Who Love Bad News? Sure. The contestants on \"American Idol\" belting out \"Float On\" in a car-commercial video, not even omitting the line about backing their car into a cop car? Why not? But \"Float On\" really reached its zenith with the release of Kidz Bop 7, as a mob of tykes chirped the song like it was \"Since U Been Gone\" or something. The weirdest thing about it was that it didn't really seem too weird by that point. --TB\n\nJanuary 3\n\nJay-Z Assumes Def Jam Presidency\n\nIf you need any proof that rap music is for the kids, just spend half an hour clicking around YouTube looking for the latest goofy dance crazes. So it's always interesting to see how rap greats adjust to getting older. Of any rapper this decade, Jay-Z probably had the most public and protracted struggle with age and respectability. Jay's stint as President of Def Jam was only the tip of the diamond-encrusted iceberg; he also famously ditched jerseys for button-ups, got married, kicked it with Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow, retired, unretired, and recorded American Gangster, an album that attempted to recapture the outlaw thrill of his younger years with a crack-sales narrative tied in with a Ridley Scott Movie. OutKast's Andre 3000, meanwhile, all but quit rap entirely, recording a hugely successful plastic funk album and then going on to take roles in terrible movies like Be Cool and Four Brothers. Eminem disappeared for years. Nelly might as well have. And Kanye West, who dressed like the Cosby cartoon version of a grumpy 40-year-old when we first met him, still finds ways to transition into Auto-Tuned fashion-plate pop-star insanity. --TB\n\nJanuary 25\n\nConor Oberst Leaves Emo Behind\n\nOnce upon a time, kids used to sing along to every word at a Bright Eyes concert as if it were a Dashboard Confessional concert. Back then, Conor Oberst was a prodigy singing his heart dry in impassioned and overwrought terms. But after the more accomplished, ambitious, and nuanced transitional 2002 album Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground, Oberst made the indie equivalent of Justin Timberlake's transition from child star to adult artist with the double-wallop of I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning and Digital Ash in a Digital Urn, which showed off his new political perspective and studio prowess, respectively. Cementing his maturation, Oberst started phasing out his Bright Eyes moniker in favor of his given name with his 2008 LP simply titled Conor Oberst. --RD\n\nMay 17\n\n__Crazy Frog and the Ringtone Invasion\n\n__\n\nThough people stopped buying music this decade, they did buy lots of cell phones. Tons. And nothing says \"oh hey, let me look at my pretty new cell phone\" like an obnoxious ring you can hear from the bathroom. Enter: The Ringtone Market, spearheaded by an extremely punch-able, gap-toothed cartoon frog covering \"Axel F\". Really. The novelty success of Crazy Frog led to non-animated artists trying to get in on music's hottest revenue stream. The result was so-called \"ringtone rap\" typified by repetitive synths, simple melody lines, and ear-worm hooks. While this trend led to many irritating, Soulja Boy-style interruptions, it found its apex with T.I.'s \"What You Know\", undoubtedly the most triumphant hip-hop ringtone ever made.\n\n--RD\n\nJune 14\n\nMichael Jackson Not Guilty of Child Molestation\n\nAlmost 20 months after he'd been arrested for sexually abusing an underage boy (an investigation launched after he'd been seen cuddling with the child and talking about sharing his bed with kids in an interview for the documentary \"Living With Michael Jackson\"), and five and a half months after the trial started, a jury of 12 found Michael Jackson innocent. But for the King of Pop, it was a pyrrhic victory. Humiliated and already convicted in the court of public opinion (there was testimony from several witnesses who claimed to have been sexually abused by, though their credibility was in question), Jackson's career as an entertainer and reputation as a public figure were in ruins. The second half the decade would not be a happy time for Jackson, and ended tragically. --MR\n\nJuly 16\n\nPitchfork Curates Its First Music Festival\n\nThe Intonation Festival, which Pitchfork curated, brought the Decemberists, Broken Social Scene, Tortoise, and more to Chicago's Union Park. The next summer saw the launch of the Pitchfork Music Festival and, and not to toot our own horn too much, we've added a few new wrinkles every year since: a third stage, a third night, some Jumbotrons. Along the way, we've played host to the Flaming Lips, Spoon, Sonic Youth, Animal Collective, De La Soul, Public Enemy, the Hold Steady, Dinosaur Jr., Vampire Weekend, Fleet Foxes, Bon Iver, the reunited Os Mutantes, Yoko Ono, and more. If you came out to any of these, we hope you had as much fun as we did. --TB\n\nJune 21\n\nBilly Corgan Tries to Reform Smashing Pumpkins\n\nOn the same day as he released his solo album TheFutureEmbrace, Billy Corgan took out a full-page ad in two major Chicago newspapers announcing his intention to reform the Smashing Pumpkins. \"I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams,\" Corgan wrote. But the only original Pumpkin who rejoined the band was drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Original guitarist James Iha told Rolling Stone that he hadn't spoken with Corgan in years. The eventual Smashing Pumpkins quasi-reunion tour was widely panned. --TB\n\nJuly 5\n\nSufjan Stevens Conquers Illinois, Indie America\n\nPhoto by Denny Renshaw\n\nBack in the 90s, the Brits had Glastonbury and Reading and all manner of huge, awesome multi-day festivals. But if Americans wanted to see PJ Harvey rock a stadium-sized crowd, we had to sit through the Verve Pipe at some haphazardly curated radio-station throwdown. But this decade, a number of multi-day festivals came to America. After Lollapalooza failed to resuscitate itself as a touring entity, it became a one-time-only two-day affair in 2005, with Weezer, Pixies, the Killers, and Widespread Panic topping the bill. The next year, it returned as a three-day fest and only got bigger from there. Meanwhile, California's Coachella fest, started in 1999, grew in size and importance. Other fests like Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits, All Points West, Sasquatch, and our very own Pitchfork Music Festival began their runs. These days, if you're willing to commit to a full weekend of sunburned shoulders and sore knees, you can see half of your favorite bands in one location over one weekend, and that's a glorious thing. --TB\n\nJuly 26\n\nYoung Jeezy and Clipse Take Crack-Rap Mainstream\n\nRappers have been talking about selling crack rocks on record almost since crack existed, and Raekwon turned the illicit profession into a hallucinatory masterpiece with 1995's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. But crack-rap found its greatest popular success with Young Jeezy's debut album Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101, an epic and apocalyptic hour-long stomp that could justifiably be accused of glamorizing Jeezy's former line of work. On two great albums and one classic mixtape, Virginia's Clipse used the job to showcase their haughty sneers and impeccable wordplay. And on 2004's Purple Haze, Cam'ron spun goofily absurdist tall tales about criminal life. At its best, crack-rap, like HBO's \"The Wire\", fearlessly plumbs the thrills and dangers and moral complications that come along when some kids' only realistic way of making money is to sell poison to their neighbors. At its worst, it's a depressing revel in other people's misery and a clear display that you can only find so many words to rhyme with \"Pyrex\". --TB\n\nAugust 6\n\nGreen Day Cuts Off Lookout! Records\n\nFounded by Larry Livermore in 1987, the Bay Area indie Lookout! Records introduced the world to bands like Operation Ivy, Screeching Weasel, the Mr. T Experience, Avail, and the Donnas. But when Green Day, the biggest band in the label's history, reclaimed the rights to their first two albums, the label faded into inactivity. Sales of those first two Green Day albums had essentially kept Lookout! afloat, but the label couldn't afford to pay the band their royalties, and Green Day finally took the albums back. When Lookout! laid off most of their employees in the immediate aftermath, Lookout! artists like Ted Leo and Mary Timony had to find new homes at other labels. --TB\n\nSeptember 2\n\n\"George Bush Doesn't Care About Black People\"\n\nWith those seven words-- uttered during NBC's \"A Concert for Katrina Relief\" days after the hurricane ravaged New Orleans-- Kanye West went off script and voiced the confused, incensed words of millions. Not all of West's outspoken moments have been as courageous, but he offered a slight bit of relief to those struck by Katrina and its deplorable aftermath. Sidebar: Mike Myers never recovered. --RD\n\nSeptember 6\n\nAntony Hegarty Wins Mercury Prize\n\nPhoto by Don Felix Cervantes\n\nThe transgender singer surprised many with his victory over the likes of Kaiser Chiefs, Coldplay, Bloc Party, and M.I.A., for the annual industry award given to the best album by a British or Irish artist. Not only was Antony merely a fraction as popular as some of his Mercury Prize peers, he was also not widely identified as British-- though UK-born, he spent most of his life in the U.S. The minor controversy was quickly forgotten, but it marked the major emergence of one of the most unique artists in recent memory. --RD\n\nSeptember 8\n\nArcade Fire Unfashionably Rocks \"Fashion Rocks\"\n\nNobody would ever mistake their quasi-Amish duds for Vogue material, but that didn't stop the Arcade Fire from stepping onstage at Conde Nast's \"Fashion Rocks\" concert to wail out a fervent rendition of \"Wake Up\" alongside David Bowie, whose wizened British drawl proved oddly perfect for the song. On the CBS telecast, cameras catch Heather Graham looking glassily amped. At that point, the Arcade Fire's soaring debut Funeral was just a year old, but the Montreal roarers had already made their mark. Forces weren't exactly aligned in the Arcade Fire's favor: They're not gorgeous, they don't carry themselves like gods on earth, and Funeral came into the world via indie label Merge. And yet the album struck enough chords that Neon Bible, the follow-up, would debut at #2 on the Billboard charts and the band would appear on magazine covers-- not because they're typical celebrities but because they made really powerful music that a lot of people liked. Sometimes things just work out like that. --TB\n\nOctober 18\n\nSunn O))) Slow Metal to a Crawl\n\nFor years, bands like Melvins and Sleep have slowed Black Sabbath's primeval stomp into a staggered, resin-sticky thud; Sleep's 1999 album Jerusalem was one hour-long song. But with their album Black One, the hooded wizards in Sunn O))) turned metal into a sort of slow, ominous ambient roar, with things like riffs and melodies only barely flickering into existence for seconds at a time before the darkness swallowed them back up. Indeed, this decade saw a boom in doom, as bands like Isis, Boris, Jesu, and Nadja and labels like Southern Lord and Hydra Head eschewed blast beats for amniotic haze. --TB\n\nOctober 25\n\nFiery Furnaces Team Up With Grandma\n\nThe Fiery Furnaces were always restless spirits, constantly reworking their sprawling prog-pop suites into unrecognizable configurations onstage. But with the release of Rehearsing My Choir, the Brooklyn-based brother-sister duo did something that no indie band could've or would've tried: They recorded an entire album with their grandmother, Olga Sarantos, whose narration formed the LP's backbone. After that, the Friedberger siblings pulled off crazy stunt after crazy stunt. Just this year, they've announced plans to cover their own album twice, turn their shows into health-care rallies, and release a silent album, including the sheet music but no actual recording and encouraging fans to play the songs themselves at shows. --TB\n\nNovember 8\n\nThe First* Guitar Hero Game Is Released__\n\n__*\n\nThe guitar will not die. While proponents of so-called \"real\" guitars-- strings, metal, wood-- may scoff at the plastic, multi-buttoned axes used in games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, there's no denying the shocking universality of these revamped axes. Guitar Hero not only brought karaoke-style dynamics (sans awful singing) to the living room, it reintroduced a generation to the classic guitar-rock gods of yore by-way-of repetition and cheeseball graphics. Whether interactive music games will create a new army of bands armed with hot-wired, string-less guitars blasting samples with each button push or usher in a new era of solo worship has yet to be seen. But these games are not going anywhere. Just ask the Beatles. --RD\n\nR.I.P.\n\nKarl Mueller (bassist, Soul Asylum) - Jul. 27, 1963 - Jun. 17, 2005\n\nRenaldo \"Obie\" Benson (singer, the Four Tops) - Jun. 14, 1937 - Jul. 1, 2005\n\nLuther Vandross (singer) - Apr. 20, 1951 - Jul. 1, 2005\n\nRobert Moog (inventor, electronic music pioneer) - May 23, 1934 - Aug. 21, 2005\n\nJames \"Little\" Milton (blues musician) - Sep. 7, 1934 - Aug. 4, 2005\n\nR.L.

And while the \"band MySpace page\" is now de rigueur for new acts looking to be heard, this wasn't always the case. Two of the biggest MySpace successes-- Arctic Monkeys and Lily Allen-- benefited from the site's unfiltered approach to music proliferation. Even though the Arctics claimed to have \"no idea what MySpace was\" when they started out, their fans did-- and those same followers posted the band's music, which led to a label deal, which led to their first album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, becoming the fastest-selling debut LP in UK chart history. Meanwhile, Allen used her MySpace and to promote her songs as well as her out-sized personality with blog posts and pictures. And it wasn't long before she switched from posting candids of herself on the web to watching her mug show up on British tabloid covers week after week. --RD\n\nFebruary 10\n\nJ Dilla Dies\n\nStoner-rap legend Dilla had a rich and varied career, starting out working with the Pharcyde and A Tribe Called Quest before going on to work with everyone from D'Angelo and Erykah Badu to whatever knuckleheads happened to live down the street from him in Detroit. And he kept making music even as he was laid up in a hospital bed, dying from complications of lupus. Dilla made so much music, in fact, that we're still hearing new tracks from the man years after his death. And his production style, which chops tiny shards of jazz and soul and electro beyond all recognition and tosses them into a blunted, bass-heavy haze, has found acolytes in a stunning range of younger producers whose numbers include everyone from Flying Lotus to Black Milk to Javelin. --TB\n\nMarch 5\n\nThree 6 Mafia Win an Oscar\n\nThree 6 Mafia weren't the first rappers to win an Oscar for Best Original Song; Eminem took the prize for \"Lose Yourself\" in 2003. But then, Em didn't show up to collect his; his bubbling, frizzy-haired co-writer Luis Resto collected in his stead. Also, he was a gigantic star. Three 6 Mafia had the better story and the bigger moment. The Memphis regional rap kingpins had forged their reputations over a decade and a half of churning out primordial fight music; they were not, let's say, likely crossover candidates. But they did write and produce \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp\", one of the songs that Terrence Howard rapped in Hustle & Flow. And when Queen Latifah opened the envelope and read their name, they exploded at the podium, jumping up and down, laughing with joy, thanking Memphis and their mothers and George Clooney and Ludacris and everyone else they could think of.

This was the first time we'd really seen Cee-Lo and Danger Mouse on a stage together, but they'd been playing the internet game for months beforehand, dressing like movie icons in their press photos and generally cultivating an air of good-times absurdity. But \"Crazy\", their one indelible song, proved to be their moment, one of the few songs of the decade that everyone knows and everyone likes. Now here's hoping Cee-Lo gets back to rapping. --TB\n\nApril 29\n\nDaft Punk Bust Out the Big Pyramid\n\nPhoto by Sung Kim\n\nArtists at 2006's Coachella Festival included big names like Madonna, Depeche Mode, Franz Ferdinand, Tool, and Bloc Party, but all of them looked like puny little humans compared to Daft Punk's never-before-seen pyramid light show. For their first major U.S. show in nearly a decade, the French duo launched one of the most welcomed (and seizure-worthy) comebacks of the decade after underwhelming with their 2005 LP, Human After All. In their live absence, Daft Punk's brand of pop continued to infiltrate all genres by-way-of clubs and the web, so the awe-inspiring light show ignited an explosion that was set to blow. The Coachella gig's ecstatic reception led to a world tour that brought band-less dance music to the masses like never before. Kanye West's DP-sampling \"Stronger\"-- and LED-crazed Glow in the Dark tour-- cemented their status as go-to mainstream godfathers. --RD\n\nMay 9\n\nSonic Youth Rock \"Gilmore Girls\"\n\nSonic Youth had always enjoyed engaging with teengirl popular culture throughout their career, and the latter half of this decade brought many opportunities for the band to dip their toes in that realm. In the sixth season finale of the adored mother-daughter dramedy \"Gilmore Girls\", Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore appeared with daughter Coco performing \"What a Waste\" from their album Rather Ripped. In early 2009, Gordon partnered with cool-girl clothing company Urban Outfitters on a fashion line, and Moore teamed up with ex-Be Your Own Pet singer Jemina Pearl to cover the Ramones' \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\" for the high school soap opera \"Gossip Girl\". In August 2009, it was announced that Sonic Youth would perform on \"Gossip Girl\", bringing their 1986 artrock classic \"Starpower\" to the teen fashionista jetset. --AP\n\nMay 9\n\n__Girl Talk Becomes Mashup Messiah With Release of Night Ripper\n\n__\n\nGirl Talk's Night Ripper doesn't just have a billion non-cleared samples on it. It's got a billion non-cleared samples from artists that would never be on the same radio station: Young Jeezy, Genesis, Foo Fighters, Pixies. With the once-harsh lines between genres crumbling at an increasing pace due to file-sharing and the internet, Night Ripper sounded like an accurate representation of a \"dream radio station\" for the kids who grew up on both Jay-Z and Nirvana. And the fact that GT mastermind Greg Gillis remains a free and non-litigated man is a testament to the evolving notion of copyright. After years of stringent enforcement, Girl Talk's maximalist approach seemed like too much to handle-- even for copyright lawyers. --RD\n\nJune 27\n\nSleater-Kinney Break Up\n\nPhoto by John Clark\n\nTheir legend already secure, Portland ex-riot grrrl power trio Sleater-Kinney spent the decade's first half trying out new ideas, often to spectacular effect: sugar-rush girl-group pop on All Hands on the Bad One, personal-is-political firepower on One Beat, full-throated monolithic classic rock on The Woods. Through it all, they remained the single best live band on the face of the planet. When they took to their website to announce an \"indefinite hiatus,\" you could almost hear the entire indie rock universe collectively groan. In the years since, Corin Tucker has has spent time at home with her kid and sung back-up for Eddie Vedder. Janet Weiss has played drums for Stephen Malkmus. Carrie Brownstein has maintained the truly entertaining and insightful NPR blog Monitor Mix. All worthwhile pursuits, for sure, but this band is sorely missed. --TB\n\nJuly 7\n\nSyd Barrett Dies\n\nWhen the psych godfather died at age 60 from complications from diabetes, the passing felt like a mere footnote. Barrett spent most of the second half of his life in seclusion, and almost all of his essential material recorded with Pink Floyd and on his own took place in the 1960s. But that material holds up, and still inspires acts like Spiritualized and Deerhunter with its unhinged sense of anarchy and freedom. Barrett's story doubles as a cautionary tale, too, i.e., bad trips are real, and they can tip beautiful disorder over into nothingness. --RD\n\nJuly 30\n\n\"Top of the Pops\" Is Canceled\n\nAfter more than 42 years of helping to both reflect and shape the British pop charts, the BBC cancelled the countdown show \"Top of the Pops\". For much of its run, TOTP only featured songs in the ascendency, which often made an appearance on the show a wonderful opportunity for emerging artists and songs. Its national audience helped to fix the images of many of rock's stars from the past four decades, from the Smiths to T. Rex to Oasis, providing a wide cross-section of the UK public with a view and listen to the often large variety of sounds jockeying for positions on the singles charts. --SP\n\nAugust\n\nOf Montreal Shills for Outback Steakhouse\n\nPhoto by Autumn DeWilde\n\nIt's easy to imagine the loopy grin that crossed Isaac Brock's face when he announced to Rolling Stone that the legendary Smiths guitarist had joined his band: \"He's a full blown member of the band. It's really fuckin' nice.\" Marr's addition was organic and borne out of an extended collaboration; it wasn't some choreographed Big Moment. But even after the fluke runaway success of \"Float On\", this felt like Modest Mouse ascending to a new level. After spending a few years touring and recording with the band, Marr has now let his Modest Mouse duties lapse, instead helping out another younger band, the British all-brothers band the Cribs. And if he wants to spend the next couple of decades jumping from band to band as indie's greatest freelance gun, he's certainly earned it. --TB\n\nOctober 9\n\nTower Records Dies\n\nIt was a surreal site: This gleaming superstore that, just a few weeks before, had been full of immaculately organized $16.99 CDs, with only a few discs haphazardly crammed on its racks, everything marked down to a dollar or two, with the remaining clerks barely bothering to swipe your credit card. That was the scene in the East Village's Tower Records a little while after the chain announced that it would liquidate and sell all its assets as quickly as possible. Blame downloading, or blame the inflated prices that always made them so tough to like in the first place. But toward the end of the decade, massive corporate music retailers like Virgin Megastore and Circuit City started dying in droves. Future generations might never see someone trying to sell them a Shakira CD on \"sale\" for $13.99. --TB\n\nOctober 17\n\nLCD Soundsystem Issue 45:33 for Nike\n\nDFA producer and LCD Soundsystem mastermind James Murphy has a contrarian streak. LCD Soundsystem, after all, debuted with \"Losing My Edge\", a single that essentially makes fun of its audience. And a few years later, Murphy put together 45:33, a continuous album-length piece for Nike, not exactly the coolest of clients. When I interviewed him shortly thereafter, Murphy told me that he took on the project essentially because it wasn't cool and because he wanted to see if he could do it. A weird idea, sure, but it worked. And a segment of the track eventually became the bedrock of the Sound of Silver track \"Someone Great\", still one of LCD's most gloriously gorgeous moments. Selling out, it would seem, can pay off in some unexpected ways. --TB\n\nNovember 2\n\nKanye's Big Mouth Rears Its Head at EMA Awards\n\nJust over a year after his famously unrehearsed George Bush put down helped make him a household name, another outburst got him a fresh batch of headlines. Though this time he wasn't speaking for a hurt nation as much as he was speaking for himself. After his mega-budget \"Touch the Sky\" video lost to Justice vs. Simian's decidedly-lower-budget \"We Are Your Friends\" at a European MTV Awards show, West crashed the stage, made a tipsy speech, and thoroughly embarrassed himself. The moment marked Kanye's sometimes troublesome evolution from self-conscious innovator to over-the-top ass. Thankfully, Kanye was able to quell his hubris enough to hire director So Me-- aka the dude he upstaged at the EMA's-- to helm one of his finest videos, \"The Good Life\", a year later. --RD\n\nNovember 14\n\nJoanna Newsom's Ys Caps Off a Year of Big Leaps\n\nIt's not like Joanna Newsom's 2004 debut The Milk-Eyed Mender was a safe album, exactly, but it did keep its scratchy-voiced erudite freak-folk in bite-sized packages. Ys, the follow-up, was another thing entirely: five sprawling, orchestral epic songs jammed with mythic motifs that refused to reveal themselves after god knows how many listens. And Newsom wasn't the only artist to leap into the ether and risk alienating her fans in 2006. Liars had already shaken off their dance-punk past for witchy drum-circle incantations, but Drum's Not Dead was the moment where they made good on their tribal aspirations, a messy monolith that gave off waves of hope and dread in equal measure. And the Knife's Silent Shout twisted the Swedish duo's dancepop into a perverted, evil throb and would up as Pitchfork's #1 album of the year. --TB\n\nNovember 28\n\nClipse Finally Bring Hell\n\nLike Wilco before them, Virginia rap duo the Clipse were stymied by major label turmoil and the dubious quest for hits this decade. But, unlike Jeff Tweedy and company, Clipse's label, Jive, wouldn't let them go. So while their proper follow-up to their beloved debut LP, Lord Willin', hung in the balance, the Thorton brothers released two mixtapes-- We Got It 4 Cheap Vols. 1 and 2-- that had them chomping up some of the biggest and best hip-hop beats of the day. The mixtape rebellion strategy drew attention and, after countless delays, Hell Hath No Fury was finally released. While the inventive and dark LP lived up to critical expectations, it didn't raise them to superstar status. But the record solidified their rabid base and, with pop hegemony splintering daily, a loyal cult may be more valuable than a fickle mass anyway. --RD\n\nDecember 20\n\nThe Decemberists vs. Stephen Colbert: Fite!\n\nThe advent of fan video contests lead to very few actually great music videos, but it did lead to one of the silliest rock-on-TV moments of the decade. Comedy Central fake-pundit titan Stephen Colbert, angered by the similarity between his own contest and one run by the Decemberists, ended up inviting Decemberists guitarist Chris Funk onto his show for a guitar solo duel. (\"I'm even giving you home-field advantage by having the contest in December,\" Colbert deadpanned.) With the help of WTF guest stars like Henry Kissinger, a pre-fall-from-grace Eliot Spitzer, and Peter Frampton, Colbert was victorious. This momentous occasion marked the start of a tight friendship between Colbert and indie rock bands, as the likes of Feist, Wilco, TV on the Radio, and the Flaming Lips appeared on \"The Colbert Report\" in the ensuing years. Colbert even had the Decemberists back on in 2009. But who won those video contests? Who cares? --AP\n\nDecember 25\n\nJames Brown Dies\n\nJames Brown would be on a short list of the most-important musicians of the 20th century. In the mid 60s, Brown basically invented funk, violently switching pop music's focus from melody to rhythm. In so doing, he had a seismic effect on almost every great innovation that came after him: Disco, rap, postpunk, techno. And when an incredibly young Michael Jackson auditioned for Motown, he sang Brown's \"I Got the Feelin'\", performing an eerily precise version of Brown's trademark dance steps. That's not even getting into Brown's absurd showmanship, his ahead-of-his-time entrepreneurial insticts, his links to the Civil Rights movement, or the lurid and fascinating soap opera that his life eventually became. He was a truly singular force in music, and on Christmas Day, we finally lost him to heart failure. He was 73. --TB\n\nR.I.P.\n\nBryan Harvey (singer, founder, House of Freaks) Apr. 27, 1956 - Jan. 1, 2006\n\nLou Rawls (singer) Dec. 1, 1933 - Jan. 6, 2006\n\nWilson Pickett (singer) Mar. 18, 1941 - Jan. 19, 2006\n\nAli Farka Touré (singer and guitarist) - Oct. 31, 1936 - Mar. 7, 2006\n\nBuck Owns (singer and guitarist) Aug. 12, 1939 - Mar. 25, 2006\n\nNikki Sudden (co-founder, Swell Maps) - Jul. 19, 1956 - Mar. 26, 2006\n\nGene Pitney (singer, guitarist) - Feb. 17, 1940 - Apr. 5, 2006\n\nJune Pointer (singer, the Pointer Sisters) - Nov. 30, 1953 - Apr. 11, 2006\n\nDeShaun \"Proof\" Holston (rapper, D12) - Oct. 2, 1973 - April 11, 2006\n\nGrant McLennan (co-founder, the Go-Betweens) - Feb. 12, 1958 - May 6, 2006\n\nVince Welnick (keyboardist, Grateful Dead) Feb. 21, 1951 - Jun. 2, 2006\n\nJoseph Hill (singer, Culture) Jan. 22, 1949 - Aug. 19, 2006\n\nArthur Lee (founder, Love) Mar. 7, 1945 - Aug. 3, 2006\n\nJason DiEmilio (founder, Azusa Plane) 1970 - Nov. 1, 2006\n\nRuth Brown (singer) Jan. 30, 1928 - Nov. 17, 2006\n\nAhmet Ertegun (producer, label executive) - Jul. 31, 1923 - Dec. 12, 2006\n\nIt's Nu, It's Rave-y, It's Nu Rave\n\nGlo sticks! Dance beats! Synthesizers! When several band emerged with sonic and visual signifiers creating a link back to the rave scene of the late 1980s and early 90s, it was only a matter of time before this largely British \"nu\" genre was coined. The onslaught was led by Klaxons, known for their neon clothes and tripped-out laser lights, whose debut LP, Myths of the Near Future, hit number two on the British charts the week it was released in January 2007. Other bands in on the trend included New Young Pony Club, Test Icicles, and Shitdisco-- even geek-chic dance group Hot Chip and Brazil's CSS got caught up in the craziness for a spell. But the revival scene may have also revived some bad trips, as it seemed to fizzle out quickly after its initial all-night (week?!) bender. --RD\n\nBritney Spears' Many Meltdowns\n\nWith her smash 2004 hit \"Toxic\", it looked for a moment like Britney Spears had a shot to give Justin Timberlake a run for The Aughts' Most Accomplished 90s Teen Idol. Then, at the start of 2004, she had that quickie Vegas marriage (just as quickly annulled) with her childhood friend. Then she married dancer/aspiring rapper Kevin Federline after dating him for just a few months. Then there was that \"You Know You're a Redneck If...\" photo of her driving with her one-year-old son in her lap. Then she split with Federline in November 2006, and seriously spiraled from there, bottoming out when she shaved her head in February 2007 after a quick stint in rehab. A dazed, disoriented performance at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards did little to stem the bleeding. Seemingly every moment of her meltdown was caught by TMZ and its ilk, who turned Spears into a constant source of hits and sales, taking tabloid journalism to a frightening new low in the process. --RD\n\nBlog House Gets the French Touch\n\nAfter Daft Punk failed to follow up on the fizzy dance-pop success of 2001's Discovery, a slew of acts lined up to expand upon bits and pieces of that duo's filtered, synth-fueled house sound. French producers like Alan Braxe, Fred Falke, and Vitalic offered a stream of almost unconsciously danceable tracks that never wore out their extended mix running times. The sound coalesced with then-Daft Punk manager Pedro Winter's Ed Banger label and its marquee act, Justice-- another pair of French guys with ambition as big as their sonics. --RD\n\n__The Balearic Revival\n\n__\n\nBlame it on global warming: in the second half of the decade a certain strand of electronic music started to get a whole lot beachier and all of a sudden we had to figure out how to spell \"Balearic.\" In 2007, releases by bands like Sweden's Studio and the UK's A Mountain of One joined names from familiar from other contexts like Prins Thomas and Lindstrøm and upstarts like Hatchback/Sorcerer (aliases of producer Daniel Saxon Judd) and Air France in ushering in a revival of a sound that first made itself known at the party playground Ibiza, in the Balearic Islands. The music was cleanly recorded and featured lots of hand percussion and round, warm bass tones, and it was unafraid to throw in the sound of a crashing wave now and then. The music had a strange effect on people, and reverb-heavy acoustic guitar strums that hadn't been heard since early-80s Genesis suddenly started sounding pretty good. Was it sly re-appropriation or just a click away from a Global Chill trip-hop comp? We're still trying to figure it out, but at least we're relaxed while doing it. --MR\n\nApril 16\n\nNine Inch Nails Go Viral\n\nJust when it looked like Trent Reznor was ready to join the 90s nostalgia heap, he spearheaded one of the most web-savvy (and intriguingly convoluted) marketing campaigns ever attempted with Year Zero. The promo push-- which involved mysterious viral videos, keychain hard drives left in restrooms, and mad scavenger hunts-- dovetailed artfully with the dystopian record, his best in nearly a decade. And in the last couple of years, Reznor has embraced the Internet even more, testing out self-release strategies and iPhone apps while allowing fans to get an unfiltered glimpse at their hero via Twitter and message board posts. Instead of fearing or rejecting the online realm, Reznor explored its possibilities and gained credibility in the process. --RD\n\nApril 22\n\nCam'ron Protects Serial Killers on \"60 Minutes\"\n\n\"If I knew the serial killer was living next door to me? No, I wouldn't call and tell anybody on him. But I'd probably move.\" That's Harlem rapper Cam'ron Giles answering Anderson Cooper in a 60 Minutes segment on the anti-police \"Stop Snitching\" movement. It's a ridiculous quote, that's rendered even more ridiculous when you realize he means it. But it was only one of many insane moments for the rapper this decade, in which he put out a classic album (Purple Haze), nurtured one of the strongest NYC hip-hop cliques since Wu-Tang Clan (the Diplomats), starred in and directed a hilariously awful gangster flick (Killa Season), was shot in his car, started a nonsensical beef with Jay-Z, and wrote a song about his troubles with irritable bowel syndrome that gave new meaning to the term \"too much information.\" --RD\n\nJune\n\nWilco Sell In\n\nIn an age when every Mac laptop comes pre-installed with Garage Band, decent recording equipment is actually cheaper than guitars and drums, and it takes a special effort to bring back the sloppy tape-hiss aesthetic of ancestral indie. And yet on their debut LP Weirdo Rippers (actually a collection of EPs), L.A. dream-punk duo No Age found a way to sound as dizzy and immediate as the bands that inspired them. No Age were and are the linchpins for a scene centered around the L.A. all-ages space the Smell, which also incubated bands like HEALTH, Mika Miko, Abe Vigoda, and the Mae Shi. Developing in parallel were groups like Times New Viking, Vivian Girls, and Wavves, all of whom obscure their pop hooks under layer upon layer of nauseous distortion. --TB\n\nJuly 7\n\n__Boredoms' Cosmic 77 Boadrum Touches Down in Brooklyn\n\n__\n\nYamantaka Eye of Boredoms believes in the power of numbers, and he took full advantage of the calendar convergence of July 7, 2007. In May 2007, Eye put out a call, seeking 77 drummers to participate in an event on July 7, 2007. The \"band\" eventually assembled included Andrew W.K., David Grubbs, Brian Chippendale of Lightning Bolt, and too many random noise-rock dudes from Williamsburg to mention, and the event, 77 Boadrum, took place at Empire–Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn at 7:07 p.m. Toms were pounded, cymbals were crashed, and, by all accounts, minds were blown, and the evening became what Jess Harvell called in his report \"the stuff of dropped jaws, stolen breath, and 'damn, you shoulda been there' urban legend.\" A year later, on 8/8/08, those who missed it got another chance, when 88 Boadrum took place in Los Angeles, further solidifying the Boredoms' place as the godfathers of the 2000s psych-rock underground, able to make a couple of hours of barely-controlled sonic chaos seem like a party. --MR\n\nJuly 25\n\n__Will Oldham's Long and Winding Decade Brings Him to Kanye\n\n__\n\nWhatever else you might say about Will Oldham, the dude is on his own path. Nothing he does smacks of calculation. When on he showed up in a Kanye West video in the summer of 2007 with comedian Zach Galifianakis, it was pretty much just another day at the office for the indie rock enigma. He kicked off the decade by teaching Johnny Cash to sing \"I Hear a Darkness\", the title track of Oldham's brilliant 1999 album, for Cash's American III: Solitary Man. But he was just getting started as far as showing up in unexpected places. In addition to releasing five generally excellent albums under his Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy alias, he covered Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, and Devo on an album with Tortoise called The Brave and the Bold (no one knew whether to take it seriously), \"covered\" some of his favorite 90s tracks as Palace in new versions with a crack Nashville session band (Sings Greatest Palace Music), acted in indie films including Junebug (2005) and Old Joy (2006), and generally confounded expectations whenever he wasn't laying low or giving the occasional awkward interview. A month after the Kanye vid, he played a cop in the 15th episode of R. Kelly's Trappe"
