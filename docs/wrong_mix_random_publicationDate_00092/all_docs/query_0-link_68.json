        "text": "Seventeen months ago, I went on an online date with a girl named Madison. It was only my third date on the dating app Hinge. The first girl I went out with asked me who my favorite Disney princess was (she really did). She said I could text her the answer that night, since I wasn’t sure on the spot. That night, I responded with a joke that apparently didn’t land because I never heard from her again.\n\nThe second date was a simple coffee date in Wedgewood Houston where I did all the talking.\n\nThe third date was with Madison. We met at Pharmacy Burger in East Nashville and had root beer and tater tots with our burgers. It turned out she worked in a career field adjacent to mine: she’s interior design and I’m construction. I walked her back to her car determined to get her number, because up to that point we communicated only through Hinge. I went in for an awkward hug in which my chin collided spectacularly with her shoulder. I joked that I wouldn’t be able to speak with an injured jaw. “I don’t care as long as I get your number,” she said.\n\nAnd so the mood was set from then on. I’m in love with a comedian. It’s one of my favorite things about Madi. I tend to be an old soul, and at times even flirt with the prestigious title “curmudgeon”. If you know me well you know I have a few reasons to be. But Madi makes me younger (even though she gives me crap about being 31 years old). When I’m tired and in no mood to laugh, she makes a face or a voice with the exuberance of a small child, and my stone exterior crumbles into laughter.\n\nMadi keeps me young in other ways, too. She’s always pointing out dogs. I grew up without pets and though she teases me about my lack of outward emotion towards them (and my displeasure at wedging themselves between her and me on the couch) I’ve learned to appreciate their funny little personalities. Also, I now know what “cute” means. Not from any innate understanding, mind you, but in a pattern-recognition sort of way. “It’s cute!” she’ll say as she shoves an Instagram post in my face, or points out the car window at an old house with ferns on the porch, or a printed dress in Target.\n\nThen there’s all the ways she pushes me outside my comfort zone. In Seattle a few weeks ago, she made me stand on the glass floor in the Space Needle. It wasn’t natural, but I did it (I played footsie with the glass a few times before trusting it with my full weight). Then there’s the way she makes me leave the house later to get to a flight. “No,” she says, “we don’t need to be at the airport three hours early.” Or how we play board games together, which, as a self-professed disliker of board games, is challenging. But she insists I’ll have fun once I get started, and she’s usually right.\n\nOn June 1st, I asked her to marry me behind the columns of the Parthenon in Nashville. I treated her to a manicure and pedicure while madly texting my friend Jordan, who acted as our secret paparazzi. She knew something was up when I started texting like a sixteen-year-old girl, because I hardly ever use my phone when we’re out and about. Afterwards, I suggested we get ice cream at Jeni’s, but didn’t let her sit down to eat it. “Let’s take it to Centennial Park!” I said. She looked at me as if to say “are you crazy?” but then considered the mani/pedi I just paid for and she agreed. Then I power walked through the park with Madi and backpack in tow, the sky threatening rain, furtively texting to make sure Jordan was in position as we approached the Parthenon. I never saw him, but he insisted he was there.\n\nAs a kid growing up in Clinton with family spread across the state, we made quarterly pilgrimages to pay visits to our grandparents in what felt like the far-flung corners of rural Tennessee. My mother’s widowed father lived in Dickson, which was only about three and a half hours away from our house in the foothills of the Smokies, but Daddy’s parents lived in Huntingdon, which was a solid five hours from our house, west of where the Tennessee River crosses the state for the second time.\n\nOur ritual was to load our little red 1995 Toyota Camry to the gills with creature comforts, avoid fighting with my younger sister, and then “go west, young man.” We would visit my mother’s father, whom we called Papa, first and then leave Dickson for Grandmother’s house, two hours west. Daddy preferred taking the interstate from Dickson, but Mama liked taking Highway 70. I fell in Mama’s camp, because as I got old enough to drive, I realized how tremendously boring it was to take the Interstate through West Tennessee, with nothing but cotton and soy fields to entertain you for hours until Jackson sprang up out of nowhere.\n\nBut along Highway 70, there was loads to look at. The two-lane ribbon of strangely orange-colored asphalt snaked its way from Dickson to Huntingdon (it runs all the way across the long state, in fact) past a host of nearly abandoned towns and buildings. I became fascinated with these places, wondering what happened, why it seemed like these towns used to be so much busier, and what these seemingly empty, half-fallen-in buildings now contained.\n\nI shared all of these imaginings with my photography buddy, Jordan, several times over our friendship, insisting that we needed to trek to West Tennessee to capture images of these abandoned places. For years, it was always, “Yeah! Let’s do it!” but nothing ever materialized. Finally, last summer I said, “No, for real. Let’s do it.” So we did.\n\nJordan insisted we travel by paper map only, and I agreed that this was sensible. Only paper maps would do for this sort of adventure. So, armed with our cameras and the chariot of choice for soccer moms everywhere—my Chevy Traverse—we embarked on our long-awaited journey across West Tennessee.\n\nWe skipped over to Dickson to simulate the trip I had taken so often as a kid, then moseyed our way through McEwen and Waverly. Waverly was one of the most interesting places we passed through. Jordan and I discovered a beautiful old Greyhound Bus station that had been converted into a chamber of commerce building at some point (though it looked like even the chamber of commerce had given up on it), with a blue tile façade and shapely Art Deco lines. There was an overgrown drive-in movie theater that looked as though it hadn’t seen action in quite a while. But the most interesting place was Dixie Radiator Service, complete with a rusty Studebaker mounted on a pole.\n\nWhile we stopped to take photos of the old Studebaker, a white Chevy truck made a U-turn out on the highway and stopped to pull in. The older man driving truck said it was his shop, and was happy to tell us how long that rusty old car had been mounted up there, and how so many people loved to stop and gawk at it. The encounter ended up being one of the more enjoyable moments of the trip.\n\nAfter a quick coffee run and a spilt latte on the console of the Traverse and part of my shorts—followed by profuse apologies—our navigator had a route home mapped for us, with a series of little towns to explore between Jackson and Columbia. We visited Decaturville, Perryville, and Hohenwald before landing back in Columbia, which is basically my backyard.\n\nThere’s not much for me to tell about these little towns, at least not from our journey that Saturday afternoon. You’ll have to do your own digging if you want their history. Our objective was to photograph old, interesting, derelict places along the way. The photos can tell the story.\n\nI’m not sure if the mythos I’d built about West Tennessee’s fascinating abandoned places lived up to the hype in Jordan’s mind, but he’s a good sport, and the deep philosophical discussions we had along the way were as much fun as the sights, themselves. We probably discovered as much about each other as we did rural Tennessee that hot July Saturday.\n\nDo yourselves a favor and travel by paper map through strange and mysterious places every so often. You never know what you’ll find. It might be a steak sandwich.\n\nThe very first day I met my girlfriend Madison, she told me she had signed up to run the Chicago Marathon. Munching on tater tots at Pharmacy Burger in Nashville on our first date back in February, I had no idea what this would entail. Later I found out it entailed months of training, a twenty-mile bike ride carrying support snacks and water (apparently I rode too far ahead to be helpful on a few occasions), and witnessing how fatigue can toy with emotions during a run. I didn’t know enough about marathons then to realize Madison was crazy, so just ate my tater tots and said, “Wow! That’s cool!.”\n\nFor months, Madi trained with progressively longer and more arduous runs. Some evenings after work, she would run for four or five hours on a treadmill just to get the time in. I’ve never run a marathon before, so all this preparation seemed more than daunting, and more akin to torture than enjoyment, but I admired her tenacity. Call me a sap, but it warmed my heart when she asked me to come cheer her on in Chicago.\n\nMadi’s parents, Tony and Marci, met us at baggage claim at Midway Airport in Chicago. October in Tennessee is warmer than October in Chicago, in case you were wondering. We stood with tensed muscles as the chilly Chicago wind whipped through the breezeway while we waited on our Uber to arrive and take us to their hotel. I would stay with Madi’s cousin Ryan since the hotels were booked before Madi even knew me.\n\nI caught the el-train full of runners down to the hotel and met Madi and her parents for breakfast, then walked a nervous Madi to the start line in Grant Park. She wore an old flannel shirt of her brother’s to protect against the Chicago chill until she had to toss it at the start. The scale of what she was about to attempt began to set in both for her and for us. There were cops and helicopters and spectators and DJs with speakers. We had to say goodbye to her before she even got to the start line, a sad fact of life after the Boston Marathon bombing.\n\nThen, we waited.\n\nOnce the race started, Tony, Marci, and I spent the rest of the morning and afternoon running from spot to spot where we knew we could see her to hold up signs and cheer her on and make her laugh. I was terrible at spotting her in big crowds of runners, and missed her on two occasions early on in the race. It got easier as the race went on. I walked my own half-marathon that day trying to keep up with Madison. Seriously. I walked fourteen miles.\n\nMadi had told me during her training that fatigue and low blood sugar would do crazy things to a runner’s emotions, but I hadn’t seen it first hand until that day. Madi had read that guys in Chinatown — around mile 21 — would dress up in dragon costumes and dance along the course, but as she approached she saw some of the dancers shedding their costumes, which started the waterworks. The pain she was in by mile 21 didn’t help. She did end up seeing some other dragons, closer to where her parents and I were standing, but then seeing us made her cry. She nearly made us all cry when, with quivering lip, she approached the barricade to get a few snacks. Seeing her cry made her mom tear up. Seeing her mom tear up made her dad tear up. Seeing her dad tear up made me tear up. I was in shock as the tearful chain reaction gained momentum. I had never seen her cry before.\n\n“You better go,” her dad wisely said, knowing she shouldn’t break her stride for long. “You can do it. Pain is temporary! Achievement is for a lifetime!” he called after her as she ran off again.\n\nWe caught her a few more times before the finish line. I ran ahead of Tony and Marci to catch her a few extra times (and I do mean “ran” — in boots). When she hobbled into the finish paddock (ominously called the “family reunification point”), I scoured Grant Park and found her, texting her parents directions through the convoluted paddock. Madi was tired, but she finished. A well-earned medal hung clanking around her neck, nestled under a space blanket they gave to each finisher.\n\nMonths ago, my girlfriend, Madison, and I were talking about a way for me to meet her parents —who live in Connecticut — and Madison thought it would be fun if we met up with them in NYC. She was right, of course (but don’t let it go to your head, Madison). Since I was small, I’ve been dreaming about visiting the almost mythical city, the backdrop for superhero flicks, Meg Ryan rom-coms, and The Godfather; this in spite of coworkers who insist it smells like piss and garbage. Maybe it does, but I liked it.\n\nI first met Madison’s parents, Tony and Marci, in a pre-war tea parlor in Chinatown, eating pork buns so good a southerner might give up his accent. Because of modern marvels like FaceTime, I already knew what they looked like, and we’d spoken before, but now I got to hug her mom and shake her dad’s hand. Madison and I wanted a day to ourselves the first day, so they just popped in long enough to say hello and admire our pork buns before heading to Lower Manhattan.\n\nNew York is a street photographer’s dream. I brought a film camera with me, being the old soul that I am, but in a stunning turn of events I shot more on my iPhone camera than my trusty film camera. (This is the part where my film camera Fredo-kisses me with a look on it’s imaginary face that says “how could you?”) In a city where 8 million people live on top of each other, there’s a great candid shot at every turn. I was living my best life.\n\nI’m fairly certain I’ve never walked 14 miles at a stretch my entire life, but I did in New York City, and with frequent stops for photos that caused Madison to run into me over and over. From Battery Park and Wall Street to Hudson Yards, we hoofed it all over that bustling island, and me with a work laptop on my back so thick it could stop an armor-piercing bullet (I was expecting an important work email that never came). My shoulders were chafed from the backpack straps.\n\nMadison’s parents were very kind. They put me up in Madison’s brother’s old room, the one with eyeballs that Madi painted in the closet. Her mom washed my dirty clothes before I put them back in my suitcase. Her dad paid for nearly all our meals. “Y’all made the trip up here,” he said. “It’s the least we can do.” I don’t know about all that, but they were very nice. And they told me funny stories about Madison, which was the whole point of the trip, anyway.\n\nThey dropped us off at the airport on our last day. Tony found a good parking spot and they went all the way to the security gates with us, where we said our goodbyes, then watched at the barrier until we were all the way through the TSA line, which took a long time because Madison must’ve tried to smuggle contraband in her bag. With looks of growing concern on their faces, I used my freakishly long arms to give them a thumbs-up above the sea of heads as the TSA agent finally zipped Madi’s bag back up. They smiled and waved as we walked towards our gate.\n\nTony and Marci made me feel welcome and showed us a good time — and more importantly, embarrassing childhood photos of Madi. I’d go back to New York in a heartbeat, piss and garbage smells n’all.\n\nThe sound is huge and electrifying. It’s something you’ve only heard in the movies, except now it’s real, penetrating the foam earplugs crammed in your head. You watch as the safety car leads the way during the warm-up laps, the drivers zig-zagging their cars to warm the rubber tires. A parade of loud colors goes by. They complete one slow lap, then another, and another. Then the safety car barrels down the track, away from the mob of antsy race cars, and ducks behind the concrete barrier. The drivers approach the flag stand. A race official waves the green flag. What sounds like a pride of hungry lions devouring their prey envelopes a cheering crowd. Old men turn into little kids and little kids stare with mouths agape.\n\nBrake rotors glow red as drivers approach corners. The smell of excess gasoline and burnt rubber make a sweet aroma that would otherwise be putrid. A car hits the barrier. A collective “AWW!” from the crowd roasting in the grandstands under the August sun. Fire-suit clad emergency responders clear the debris, and the green flag emerges again. Then it’s over. The last lap is finished. A winner sprays the first two losers with something fizzy in a glass bottle.\n\nThe black marks on Korean Vets will be there for months, but the track will disappear. No more concrete barriers or grandstands or food trucks or vendors under tents. It’s like a solar eclipse of automotive fever dream, one that gear heads anxiously wait for all year. And it’s incredible it happens here in Nashville.\n\nHome is where the heart is. That’s what they say.\n\nI’ve lived in the Nashville area for almost seven years now, but I grew up in a small East Tennessee town called Clinton. Clinton is one of those funny little places with small town drama, sleepy Saturday mornings, enough antique shops to choke a mule, and a quirky charm all its own. Nestled in the Tennessee Valley along the Clinch River, it’s just a stone’s throw from Knoxville, another town dear to my heart, having gone to school at the University of Tennessee. Go Vols.\n\nOne of my old friends got married yesterday, and for the first time in my entire life, I had a “plus one” to accompany me. I asked my girlfriend, Madison, if she would be willing to come with me and make a whole day trip out of it. Just like every other hair-brained idea I come up with, Madison thought it was a good one.\n\nMadison is from Connecticut, but she’s actually been in Nashville longer than I have, just not long enough to lose her Northern accent and stop receiving all the “You ain’t from ‘round here, err you?” comments from us rare Tennessee natives. Even though she’s been in Nashville a long time now, she hadn’t made her way to East Tennessee to explore yet, so I took it upon myself to show her around.\n\nWe stopped in Clinton first. To be honest, there are times I miss the mountains, the valleys, and the rivers of East Tennessee so bad my heart aches. I feel like my blood is in the clay soil there, and I wanted to show Madison this magical place. Always the good sport, she “oohed” and “ahhed” over all the places I pointed at and stories that went with them. And always the foodie, she leaned heavily on me to come up with a good local place to eat (absolutely no chain restaurants were allowed on this trip).\n\nPartook in the Eucharist at St. Patrick’s Cathedral.\n\nSt. Patrick’s Cathedral was founded in 1191 in what is now the heart of Dublin as a Roman Catholic cathedral, but is now the national cathedral of the Church of Ireland. Sawyer and I thought it would be something special to go and partake in the Eucharist with fellow believers while we were there in Ireland, and we were right. In case you were wondering, they are a “one-cup” church. Sawyer and I didn’t sit at the front, either.\n\nAte a full Irish breakfast at an irreverent cafe.\n\nAfter St. Patrick’s Cathedral, we went looking for an authentic Irish breakfast, something that eluded us during the road trip portion of our stay. Once again, Sawyer came through with the Google reviews and found a place called Stage Door Cafe. We almost didn’t stick around, because there was a bit of a line (or “queue” as they say), and the man taking orders was a bit abrasive at first. Once we got in, however, we had the best eating experience of the whole trip.\n\nThe restaurant was decorated with the occasional lewd statue, and the cook, a jovial man with a red and white beard, spoke in terms that would make a sailor blush. But he spoke with a smile and struck us as the kind of guy who only made fun of you if he liked you, and he made fun of everyone, particularly Germans.\n\nThank goodness for Brylcreem and penciled on stocking seams.\n\nChances are, a few generations ago, your grand-pappy or great grand-pappy met your grand-mammy or great grand-mammy at a dance, his hair slick enough to lubricate flathead Ford and her with fake “nylons” painted on due to war-time rationing. Imagine a dance hall with a small swing band thumping away on a stage, the haze of Lucky Strike cigarette smoke lingering in the air. On the floor is a crowd of couples twisting, spinning, turning, dipping. A few girls are sitting by the far wall, not dancing. A guy with shiny hair eyes one of them through the gaps in the dancers and the cloud of smoke. He makes up his mind. He’s going over there to ask her. His heart starts pounding. What if she says “no”?\n\nBack in January, I went to a dance at the Williamson County Performing arts center. The small theater where the dance took place had several tiers of upholstered seats, a stage for the 16-piece live band, and about five square feet of hardwood for a posse of dancers big enough to make the fire marshall start lobbing obscenities. After a short lesson with just enough information to make you look like an “idiot” instead of a “complete idiot”, we were set loose.\n\nThe band was marvelous. As a recovering jazz nerd, I was almost tempted just to take a seat in one of the comfy theater chairs and listen to them instead. That wouldn’t require any courage. I could sit there and not worry about rejection. But no, I was on a mission, doggedly determined to be like James Bond that night.\n\nI think I danced with ten different girls. I’d never met a single one of them before. It’s a marvel that a woman would let herself hold hands with—and avoid getting stepped on by—a strange skinny guy who’s barely got any moves, but they did. The thing is, so many girls were in the same boat. They weren’t that great at dancing, either. One girl was stiff as a board and looked completely terrified. Another girl danced with me like I was a terrible bore with moves so simplistic that I probably got them from the back of a cereal box. One girl was tense, but laughed at every mistake she made with the kindest smile, trying to make conversation.\n\nHaving gone to the dance by myself, there wasn’t much to do but treat everyone to an Irish goodbye when it was all over with. There was nowhere to just hangout and talk if you weren’t dancing, so getting to know people was tough between songs. That, and I was tired from the long weekend and all the asking-girls-to-dance, so I took the cowards way out.\n\nStill, I have to admit I was proud of myself. I felt like I’d witnessed an ancient ritual I’d never seen before. An ancient ritual that our grand-pappies and grand-mammies participated in. But it’s not a dying ritual. More niche perhaps, but not dying. I was shocked to see how many people my age and younger were there, and in retro garb, too. No, swing dancing is alive and well.\n\nAnd I love swing dancing. I plan on going back, in case you were wondering. There’s something mysterious and wonderful about stepping in time to an infectious, syncopated beat with someone else. As the Lovin’ Spoonful said, “it makes you feel happy like an old-time movie.” Who knows, maybe none of us would even be here if our ancestors hadn’t met out there on the dance floor.\n\nSo I say, thank goodness for Brylcreem and penciled-on stocking seams.\n\nSometimes a thought just hits you out of nowhere, like a poorly thrown baseball at a kid-pitch little league game.\n\nDriving home from work last night with the dotted lines on the pavement zipping by and the headlights of a tailgater uncomfortably close in my rearview mirror, it occurred to me: I have some good friends.\n\nLet me clarify this.\n\nI went through high school and college like everybody else. School-age kids are dumb and mean. I know, I was one of them. I had good friends, of course. But I also had bad friends. Friends who only hung out with me if there wasn’t a better offer. Friends who bailed on me time after time. Friends who were nice to me one-on-one but picked on me to win points with a crowd.\n\nBut I’m not just a victim here. I’m just as guilty of all those things as the kids who did them to me. I even bullied kids in school. I’m not proud of it. Maybe I don’t deserve to have good friends. To this day, I have a selfish streak a mile wide. Often, I only want to talk about me. I don’t always ask how my friends are doing until I’ve told them how I’m doing. Maybe my friends struggle with the same battle on the inside and just don’t show it. With friends like me, who needs enemies, m’right?\n\nBut in spite of my shortcomings, I have some quality friends these days. On Sunday, one of them paid me a compliment publicly in front of a crowd of people. The day before that, another friend drove an hour from Hendersonville just to talk and hand me tools while I worked on my rusty old truck. Yesterday, one friend texted me out of the blue and told me that a piece of advice I’d given him was ringing in his ears.\n\nSo driving down the road yesterday evening, a warmness fell over my chest as these thoughts churned through my head. I matter to someone. Multiple someones. Why should anyone care what I think? And yet, there are people in my life that ask my opinion. They tell me how nice I look today, or that I did a good job of this or that. That hasn’t always been.\n\nIf the joyous tear-jerking moment in It’s a Wonderful Life is to be believed - that the man is truly rich who has friends - then I have arrived.\n\nHopefully, if you’re reading this you have some friends like mine, who think about you enough to send you a message during the day. Hopefully, you have people that value your opinion and want you in their lives. If you don’t, I think you’ll find that there are indeed several people in this world that do want to know you. Go find them and make their lives a little richer.\n\nFestive enough that I went to the tree-lighting in Columbia, Tennessee this year. Three Saturdays ago, my friends informed me that they were going and that I was welcome. No one told me that they lit the tree after a parade, not that I minded. A Christmas parade would’ve sounded more interesting than lighting a Christmas tree, anyway. Parking in downtown Columbia for an event takes way too much effort to watch a guy in a Santa suit flip a switch and then turn around and leave. If I’m going to go to the trouble of finding a good parking spot, I might as well have candy hurled at me and watch the local Rotary Club float scoot by.\n\nThe parade was warm. Not the air. The air was cold. I mean the parade brought back the warm and cozy feelings of yesteryear, watching the parade in my hometown of Clinton. When I finally accepted Hot Hands from my friend Jordan, my palms matched the feeling in my heart. My friend Mitch was among the group standing with me behind the galvanized barricade. We found a spot near Muletown Coffee, where we met his son Dayne’s “friend” who is a female. A vetting process for this “friend” may or may not have taken place that night by us bystanders in the know, watching the young couple while they talked in low voices nearby.\n\nI love characters. Every now and again you run across someone you just have to get to know better. There’s something about them that draws you in and makes you want to know more. I also love things with character, particularly cars. When you run across an interesting person with an interesting car, you’ve just got to get their story.\n\nSuch is the case with Jesse Woodby. Aside from having a sexy first name, Jesse is one of those people you want to be friends with. I’ve only known him for a year and a half. Half that time we didn’t know each other well. But we became fast friends commiserating over old trucks. Since then, we’ve become like brothers.\n\nJesse cuts hair on the quaint town square in Athens, Alabama. Having no time for a cut the past few weeks (and my hairdo beginning to resemble Albert Einstein’s), I decided to drive down to his shop this past Saturday. I walked in to his shop, King’s Corner, where he greeted me like a long lost friend.\n\n“Wazzup, J! You lookin’ shaggy, dude. C’mon, have a seat. I’m-a take care of you.” His speech is a fine mixture of country twang and hip-hop artist.\n\nIn addition to being a barber, he’s also a gospel preacher, but for my money there’s not a heck of a lot of difference between the two. While he cut my hair, a friend of his, named Brandon, walked into the shop. Jesse greeted him with the same enthusiasm and rapper twang. Brandon had a look about him like he’d seen some things. He happened to be passing through, and he wanted to say hi to Jesse, and update him on a tough family situation he was dealing with. I could tell he and Jesse talked regularly about it. As I said, there’s not much difference between being a barber and a preacher.\n\nBut Jesse’s seen some things, himself. His dad was an alcoholic that beat him and his mom. His father had kidnapped a police officer and done time in prison. His mother remained faithful to him the whole time he was locked up. He was released early on good behavior. One cold Ohio night, his dad came home particularly drunk and knocked his mom senseless, then passed out on the couch. Later that night, his mom grabbed up some clothes for her and little Jesse and whispered, “Come on, Jesse. We’re leaving.”\n\nThey spent that cold night in a battered women’s shelter. Jesse was ten years old.\n\nHe and his mother made their way to Alabama, where his grandparents lived. At one point, his father found out where they were and came down to take Jesse away, but his grandparents went and got the sheriff. That was the last time his father bothered them.\n\nLife went on for a while. The Woodbys settled into Athens. But an emptiness grew inside Jesse that went unchecked all those years. A grief. Jesse turned to pills to fill the emptiness. He told me it was nothing for him to take an entire pack of Lortab 10 in a day.\n\nHis skin turned yellow. He went to the doctor, who said, “Son, if you don’t quit doing what you’re doing, you’ll be dead in a year.”\n\nThat night, Jesse sat down with his mom and confessed everything. He’d kept his addiction from her until then, but she’d known something wasn’t right. She sat wordlessly as he told her the whole story. When he was finished, she didn’t chastise him. She didn’t shame him. She prayed over him.\n\nSomething changed right then and there. “I know some of us church folks don’t like to talk about feelings,” he said, “but I felt something happen to me. I felt a transition. It was powerful, man.”\n\nBy the grace of God, he’s been clean for eight years now. He became a father of four overnight when he married his wife Holly and her three kids, and has one of his own with Holly now. He’s a great dad. He wouldn’t admit it, but I’ve seen it, myself. He makes voices and farting sounds and everything that growing kids need.\n\nIf you didn’t know it, I’m a jazz nut. In the sixth grade, when band became an option for snot-nosed Clinton Elementary School students, I wanted in. I didn’t come from a family of athletes. My mom was in band, and I was convinced I had no hand-eye coordination (that turned out not to be true), so I wanted to follow in her footsteps.\n\nMy mom rattled off the list of available instruments we could play from a paper the school sent us. Saxophone wasn’t on the list. I knew nothing about saxophones other than they were the only cool instrument. My mom informed me that I had to suffer through the clarinet before the band director would let me play saxophone, so I did, ear-splitting squeaks and all.\n\nFast forward to middle school. I didn’t know anything about jazz other than it was cool. See a pattern here? I joined the middle school jazz band because I wanted to play the cool music. At one point that year, the middle school and high school held a joint jazz band concert. The middle school band played stuff like the Pink Panther theme, the theme from Peter Gunn, and just about anything else written by Henry Mancini.\n\nThen the high school band took the stage.\n\nThey played “In the Mood”. I was entranced. The place was jumpin’. My appendages twitched involuntarily to the rhythm. I’m sure I had a stupid smile from ear to ear on my pudgy middle school face. From then on, I was hopelessly in love with jazz.\n\nThursday night, I was hanging out with some friends in the Wedgewood Houston neighborhood in Nashville. We were out shooting photos to celebrate my friend Jonathan’s recent acquisition of a new Sony camera. As we finished up our photo shoot, we walked past a place called Americano Lounge, a coffee shop / cocktail lounge dressed up like an old-school speak easy inside. Jazz leaked through the door. I saw a saxophone. We went inside Americano.\n\nCome to find out, the first Thursday of every month is jazz night with a five-piece band. Delicious. I watched the band play “Strasbourg St. Denis” with the same stupid look I had at that concert in middle school. After the song, I walked up and asked if they knew “Stardust,” one of my favorite jazz standards that everybody-and-their-brother has covered since Hoagy Carmichael wrote it in the 1920s.\n\nThe piano player, a laid-back guy named Alexander Murphy (a terribly appropriate name for a jazz musician) said, “Yeah, I think we know that one. Chase, you know ‘Stardust.’ Cool. What key? G? Yeah, man, we know ‘Stardust.’ We’ll play it after this next song.”\n\nI stood in a café full of sitting people like a dork. I stood near a column watching the band play, with an intensity like unto a swooning fanboy. I crouched down with my camera to snap a few photos, hoping they wouldn’t mind (not that they could argue with me while they played). Murphy’s fingers danced across the keys. The bass player’s head bobbed to the beat. The drummer wore every feeling on his face as he played. It was wonderful.\n\nWhen they got done with ‘Stardust’, I walked up and thanked them. Murphy pivoted on the piano bench to face me. “Hey man, can you send me those photos when you’re done?”\n\nI laughed. “Sure! I was afraid you guys wouldn’t even want your picture taken.”\n\nThe drummer smiled. “Nah,” he said. “Musicians eat that stuff up.”\n\n“I would like to have seen Montana…”\n\nThese are the dying words of Captain Vasili Borodin, played by Sam Neill, in The Hunt for Red October, one of my absolute favorite movies. Like Borodin, I had not seen Montana before, either. But unlike Borodin, I wasn’t shot by a ship’s cook before I could see it, and I’m grateful because Montana is gorgeous.\n\nIn fact, I had never seen the Pacific Northwest before. Neither had “Montana” Will before January of 2022. Will’s story is stranger than fiction, with the highest of peaks and the lowest of valleys. Will has been a rodeo bull rider, incarcerated, run heavy construction machinery, homeless, ministered to inmates, hit by a car, and wowed employers with his grit and work ethic. The circumstances by which he ended up in Montana are too dark to describe here, but suffice it to say that a rated-R movie could be made about them.\n\nWill’s best feature is his enormous heart. He would literally give you the shirt off his back, and help you in a pinch, whether it be building a porch at your house, fixing your car on the side of the road, etc. So when the opportunity came to go visit Will, (who moved to Montana by himself in his truck) a few of his friends sprang for the plane tickets and seized the opportunity.\n\nTo begin the journey, I flew up to Spokane with Mitch, a short Hawaiian man that I consider an adopted father, complete with corny jokes (not that I don’t make a few of those, myself). Shiela, a mutual friend of ours and Will’s, went up three days before we did, the idea being to overlap visits and provide him with friends for as long as possible. From Spokane, Mitch and I drove through Idaho into western Montana.\n\nNever having seen the Northwest before, I couldn’t stop looking out the window at the mountains covered with pine trees. As a kid, I grew up reading Model Railroader and looking at toy trains in hobby shops, so seeing all the criss-crossing railroads carving the mountains was a joy. We passed a few logging yards along the way, timber being a part of the economic bedrock in this section of the country.\n\nWe arrived in Troy, Montana after a three-hour drive from Spokane. Cell service was spotty at best the whole trip, but between dropped calls we deduced that Will and Shiela could be found at the Silver Spur Saloon in Troy, the best place to eat in town. I spotted Will as soon as we entered the saloon as he perused the menu. I walked right up to him and punched him in the shoulder. He stood up and gave me one of the tightest hugs of my life.\n\nThat night we camped at a campground nestled at the point where the Yaak River and Kootenai Rivers meet. It was a beautiful place to spend the night. I felt like I was in a scene from True Grit, the part where Mattie Ross goes to the river for water and meets the man who killed her father. Will had everything we needed to camp packed into his truck, minus the little bit of camping gear my friend Jordan lent me. Only a week before we arrived, Will lost his job with a wildfire-fighting company due to their government contract being terminated (there were no more wildfires for them to fight). So Will was essentially homeless in Montana.\n\nI’ve been camping plenty with some of my friends over the past few years, but I’ve never camped with a homeless man before. Most of us who camp do it for the challenge of it; we do it for fun. Will camped for survival, and watching him set up his camp was a learning experience. He had two tents, a big one for the three guys and a small one for Shiela. We set up our tents, and then set about making a fire. We gathered up some deadfall from around the campground, and then Will approached the fire pit with a can of gasoline.\n\nMitch and I eyed the gas can with more than a healthy dose of skepticism. “What are you doing with that, Will?” I asked.\n\n“I’m startin’ a fire.”\n\n“You’re gonna blow yourself up!”\n\n“No, I ain’t. You gotta let the vapor go away before you light it.”\n\nI wasn’t convinced, so I watched from a safe distance as Will lit the fire. To his credit, he still had eyebrows and a shirt sleeve when he was done, so I guess his method works. But I probably won’t be employing his method on my campfires. Will emphasized the importance of being able to quickly make a fire when you’re homeless. In the winter, it can be the difference between life and death, he said. It made sense that he wouldn’t want to mess around, and start his fires with the quickest method he knows how.\n\nKalispell is a decently-sized city for Montana, with a population of around 24,000 people. We stayed at a bed-and-breakfast called Lonesome Dove Ranch, where we would sleep in a pair of cavalry tents with wood plank floors furnished with beds.\n\nWe dropped our stuff off at Lonesome Dove, and then headed into Glacier National Park. The week we were there was the last week of the season for the Going-to-the-Sun Road, a feat of engineering building in the early 1900s that meandered up a beautiful gorge in the West Rocky Mountains.\n\nI have never seen mountains that tall. I grew up in East Tennessee, where the Great Smokey Mountains were the tallest things for hundreds and hundreds of miles. But the Rockies dwarf the Smokies. I couldn’t stop gawking at the majesty of the massive formations looming over me. I felt like an insect by comparison.\n\nGoing-to-the-Sun Road was challenging for me. Mitch drove us in our rented Toyota 4Runner. The road was a narrow two-lane road the clung to the edge of the mountains, with a precipitous drop on one side. Going up the mountain, there were times I couldn’t even see the guardrail out of the car window, only my impending death as I imagined our car tumbling over the edge. I shut my eyes sometimes and pretended we were on a boring interstate instead. Mitch grew up on Maui, where scary narrow roads on mountainsides were part of everyday life, so he was used to such drives. I was simultaneously grateful for his experience behind the wheel and annoyed that he was enjoying himself instead of white-knuckling it all the way up. The driver can’t enjoy himself at a time like this, right? Our lives are at stake!\n\nWeary from the drive and the emotional high of seeing God’s glory manifested in geological wonders, we trudged into camp and got some showers. Tuesday night would be the last time I showered for the rest of the trip. It sounds gross, but that will be important later.\n\nWe roasted hotdogs, and then turned in for the night. That night was the coldest night of the whole trip, and honestly I was miserable. The bed-and-breakfast provided some propane heaters that only lasted about four hours into the night. The beds had plenty of thick covers on them, but they just weren’t enough for me. A friend back home had given me some Hot-Hands to take with us on the trip and told me to place them under my kidneys if I got cold. They helped, but I was still cold. I slept in my winter coat under the covers that night.\n\nMorning was a mercy. It meant no more pretending to sleep, and that I could get up and move around to get warm. It made everything feel new again, even if I was exhausted from sleep deprivation. We had breakfast at Lonesome Dove’s dining room. The coffee, which I was definitely looking forward to, was basically hot water. According to Will, that’s just how they make coffee in Montana. Both Will and I prefer stand-up-and-bark coffee. After breakfast, we snuck back to his truck and made our own on his tailgate. And it definitely barked.\n\nShiela’s flight home was that Wednesday afternoon. Will took her to the airport in Kalispell for an emotional goodbye. Their relationship is a special one that has seen him through the darkest days of his life. Needless to say, watching her get out of his truck and head into the air terminal was hard. He caught back up with Mitch and me at Chic-Fil-A for a bite to eat, and he was unusually quiet, with a far-away look in his misty eye.\n\nHe cheered up a little when we went back into Glacier, where we set up camp for the night and killed time before church in Kalispell.\n\nGiven Will’s past, he knows what it’s like to be on the receiving end of “church hurt.” Religious meanness rears its ugly head when people learn of Will’s story. Or sometimes it rears its ugly head just because. Visiting a church while living in Troy, Will got the feeling he was unwanted there, and sought out a new group of Christians to plug into.\n\nWe went with him that night to the church in Kalispell, where they held their mid-week Bible study. Mitch actually ran into some people he knew from his time preaching in Georgia, and was able to explain Will’s situation to them in order to get him a job and a place to live there in Kalispell. It definitely felt like a '“God thing.” As of writing this, Will now has a job and a place to live thanks to the Christians there that night.\n\nWe spent a very wet Thursday hiking up to Avalanche Lake, a five-mile round-trip through scenic vistas, climbing through different parts of the same gorge we drove up the day before. The views were breathtaking. It drizzled on our way in, then cleared up as we approached the trail’s end. Avalanche Lake is fed by the Sperry Glacier, which sits at the top of a high ridge above the trail.\n\nIt’s amazing to think of the Salish and Kootenai tribes that lived here hundreds of years ago, and the explorers who carved the trails leading to these beautiful places. But I also got the feeling that, as beautiful as this place was, it was a hard country to live in. Winter was right around the corner, and that version of Montana threatened a harsher existence than the pleasant one I got to see.\n\nBy the time we got back to the car, it was raining outright. We were cold and wet, and ready to get back to camp. When we did, we found that our hopes of being dry were dashed due to the leak Will’s tent had developed, soaking the bottoms of our sleeping pads and mummy bags. As the rain cleared, we built a fire to dry out our gear.\n\nWill and I talked by the fire that night. After a week of camping together, we began to see each other’s idiosyncrasies. I had grown somewhat irritable not having any time to myself, and gone off by McDonald Lake earlier that day to re-center.\n\n“Thank y’all so much for coming’” he said as we watched the fire burn. “I know I ain’t always the easiest to deal with.”\n\nA pang of guilt came over me. I have a selfish streak a mile wide, and it had shown itself on a few occasions during the trip. “It’s good to be here with you,” I said. “You may have noticed it by now, but I can be pretty ornery, too.”\n\n“I know you can,” he replied candidly.\n\nSitting by the fire, I conducted an informal interview with “Montana” Will. I asked him about his relationship with his mom and dad. I asked him how he left his home state of Florida. I asked him about his wife cheating on him, and he was gracious enough to answer my questions and tell his story. I shared a few things of my own with him, like how my father had been sick for several years, that I was close to him, and that I lost him when I was 21 years old. That night was special. We were both willing to lower our defenses and learn about each other. There’s just something about a campfire that makes people want to open up.\n\nFriday morning, our last morning, we broke camp and drove back to Kalispell to drop Will off at his truck. He gave us both big hugs and thanked us for coming to see him. Mitch prayed. Then we hopped in the 4Runner and made the trek back to Spokane.\n\nThe trip was eye-opening in a few different ways. First, I got to see a new part of the country that I had never seen before.\n\nSecond, I got to spend quality time with someone who’s lived a much different life than me, with different goals and aspirations. We look at Will’s living situation and think, “Oh, that’s terrible! To be homeless like Will…” But Will is happy. I can’t tell you the number of times he tried to convince us to move up there with him to Montana. He’s completely fallen in love with the place. Sure, he doesn’t always have four walls and a roof over his head. But he’s satisfied, and I learned that I need to be happy for him.\n\nLastly, in one tiny glimpse, I had an idea of what it was like to be homeless, though I wouldn’t be so bold as to say I’ve come anywhere near truly experiencing it. Watching how Will survived over the years without a permanent dwelling place, cooking food, making fires, surviving…it was sobering. After three days of not showering, I became painfully aware of my own body odor and how greasy my hair looked. Going through security at the Spokane airport, I kept the hat on my head until the last possible second so that no one would see my hair. I changed out of my grimy clothes in a stall in the men’s room. I rolled on another layer of deodorant to cover up my stink. I can only begin to imagine what it must be like to go through life being self-conscious of yourself in public, begging for a shred of dignity.\n\nI pulled into my driveway at 3 o’clock Saturday morning after our connecting flight out of Denver was delayed due to weather. As tired as I was, I showered before I got into bed. I felt brand new after that…you know, except for being deliriously tired.\n\nOur week with “Montana” Will was the trip of a lifetime. Hopefully, I’ll see him up there again before too long.\n\nI’ve been a movie nut my whole life. I really didn’t stand a chance, since my parents were always eager to share their favorite movies with me in my formative years. Armed with Blockbuster Online, an early but short-lived competitor to Netflix, my parents subjected me to all sorts of movies and TV shows that they grew up with. So it shouldn’t surprise you to learn that Casablanca is my favorite movie of all time, or that John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock, and Steven Spielberg are some of my favorite directors. And while these films and directors definitely inspired me to write novels and short stories, I have yet to break into filmmaking.\n\nBut others watch their favorite films and become inspired to follow in the footsteps of these great directors. The Frost Brothers are of this sort.\n\nI’ve known Zach and Jeremy Frost for five or six years now, who I met through our mutual friend Jordan Kinard. Ever the movie-buffs and always comparing notes on their picks for this year’s Oscar nominees, the Frost Brothers took their passion for film and got serious, especially in the past three years. Frost Studios has already made several short films with investor backing, and their latest project is the daunting 48 Hour Film Project.\n\nTheir crew was small, but professional. Zach operated the camera, a serious-looking rig with lots of gizmos I wasn’t well-acquainted with. Jeremy called many of the shots, holding a monitor with a live feed from the camera, which even allowed him to manipulate it remotely. Jonathan was on the sound boom, always just off-camera and sometimes crawling into uncomfortable positions to capture the sound without being seen (up to and including laying on the ground beneath a table, just below the actors). Jordan was their producer, making sure that everything they needed for all their shots was on-hand and ready to go; things like a suit that their main character wore, an aerosol mist for dramatic effect, and water bottles to drink.\n\nThe day I was on set there were two actors in character. The main character, Evan, was played by Colin, whom sports fans may recognize as a popular social media personality. The other actor, Ryan, played Evan’s brother, who blows up explosively in one scene depicting a confrontation between the two. Both did a fantastic job performing their roles.\n\nIt was fascinating to watch how the two co-directors deftly shot the same scene from different angles, getting the material they needed efficiently and then moving on to the next shot. Skulking around with my old-school Canon AE-1 35mm film camera, I snapped photos whenever I could, trying to be out of the way. The AE-1 has that ideal shutter sound iPhone’s mimic when you hit the shutter button, only louder. So when I snapped a photo during a shot, sound rolling, Zach turned to me and said, “Jesse, I don’t think you can take any more pictures during the shots.”\n\nI felt really bad after that.\n\nAfterwards, the crew made sure I was invited to the screening, which took place at the Regal in Opry Mills. There were enough short films submitted to warrant four separate screenings, each with about ten short films. “The Soil of Time”, as their film was called, was in Group C. After having watched all the films in their screening, I can confidently say that Frost Studios really stood out, producing a short film with a professional look and feel that not all the others necessarily had.\n\nBut that’s not to knock the other filmmakers. The 48 Hour Film Project is hard. Putting anything together in that short a time is impressive. There were some very interesting films shown that night in Group C’s screening, films with excellent comedic timing, clever uses of space and composition, and some keen editing.\n\nIt was a pleasure to witness what goes on in the making of a short film. It was also a pleasure to see friends I’ve known for years in their natural habitat, one I’d never seen them in before. Honestly, I’m not sure if I could hack it, staying up for hours on end. I don’t do well being sleep-deprived. I get accused of being a grandpa regularly as a result. But I’m intrigued by this competition, and wouldn’t mind hanging out on set a little more in the future…so long as I don’t take pictures during the shot.\n\nOnce named the Wilson County Fair (and still is in some radio ads), the Tennessee State Fair is truly a slice of everything this great state has to offer, with rides, fair food, exhibits and competitions on just about any subject matter that little old ladies and farmers could dream up. I can just hear the competitors now, bragging over their entries, thumbs tucked behind overall-straps, “My pig is the biggest in this here state.” “Oh, yeah? Well I done grew me the biggest melon in these here parts.” Or Mildred from down the street casts a sideways glance at Peggy’s finest canned goods on display and remarks, “Oh, your pickles look almost as good as mine did last year.”\n\nLocated in Lebanon, Tennessee, the State Fair is centrally located along I-40, within fairly easy reach of both West and East Tennesseans, and with a lot more room than the Nashville Fairgrounds now has to offer post-soccer stadium.\n\nThe fun isn’t just limited to quilting competitions and livestock, although those are worthy struggles. There are, of course, the midway rides like the Ferris wheel, so-called “fun” houses, bumper cars, and all those sneaky carnies promising massive stuffed Pikachus in payment of some ridiculously hard feat of hand-eye coordination. Then there’s the truck and tractor pulls, the live music, the funnel cakes, and, last but not least, the people-watching.\n\nYes, there’s something for everyone at the Tennessee State Fair.\n\nSince I rode to the fair with Alex, I had to call it quits at 8 o’clock that night to get home at a reasonable hour. So even if I had been tempted to ride any of the midway rides that night, I didn’t have the time. As a kid, the rides were all I cared about. Just try taking your kids through the canned good displays. I give it five minutes before they whine, “Mama, I’m bored. When can we ride some rides?” But as I got older, I cared less about the rides and more about the collection of skilled work from the community around me that otherwise wouldn’t be shared beyond friends and family.\n\nBut the little kid in me still wanted to see all the bright colors and happy sounds of the carnival rides, so Alex and I exited the fair through the midway. The place was packed, with people lining up to ride like it was Disney World. Maybe for some folks, this was Disney World. I still don’t have much interest in being on the rides, especially the ones that make you puke like a character in The Sandlot, but I do still love looking at them.\n\nIf you haven’t been to the Tennessee State Fair, I can now wholeheartedly recommend it. If you’re new to this great state and want to experience its character, I also recommend it. If you love funnel cakes, I recommend it. For me, it’s a reminder of who I am and where I came from, as well as a chance to admire my talented neighbors for their skill.\n\nAnd if you think you can grow a bigger melon than farmer Dan, go for it.\n\nLand Between the Lakes had already bested our hearty camping group once before. Between camping in the wrong area amongst rednecks with generators that ran constantly, side-by-sides with loud exhausts and light bars designed to shine all the way to Mars, and a lake that somehow grew in size and flooded our camping spot in the middle of the night, we had a miserable first experience at Land Between the Lakes. But my friend Brad, with his reliable off-roading machine, wasn’t ready to give up on it yet as a viable trail-riding spot, and so myself and fellow campers Sawyer and Jordan were convinced to join him on yet another over-landing trip to Land Between the Lakes. It had to be a better experience than last time, right?\n\nWell…no. In fact, I’m pretty sure this time was worse.\n\nBrad was going through a rough time at work, putting in long hours and making up for coworkers who recently left and weren’t replaced yet. He needed a getaway in the worst way. I had gone camping with Brad several times at this point, getting to drive his ‘08 Lexus GX 470 (basically a Toyota Land Cruiser) through some tricky trails before, so going with him was a no-brainer for me. Sawyer had also been with us before and was glad to come-with, but this would be Jordan’s first time to go over-landing with us.\n\nWe met at the church building in Franklin, a central location for all of us, and proceeded to pack the GX tighter than a Conecuh Sausage. A quick trip to Kroger for a few last-minute essentials (like root beer), and we were on the road to Kentucky. Land Between the Lakes is just across the Kentucky border, with Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley stretching down into parts of northwest Tennessee. The drive was only about two hours or so.\n\nAs we rolled into the park, I asked, “Do we need need a permit to camp here?”\n\n“I don’t think you do for primitive camping,” said Brad.\n\nI have trust issues, so I looked it up on my phone, which amazingly still had service. In fact, we did need a permit. If we were caught building a fire without a permit, we could be fined by Smokey Bear and his suspiciously Sam Elliott-like voice, or even jailed! (okay, I made that last part up, but we could be fined). I informed my fellow campers, who were more anxious to explore than settle our overnight accommodations, but I convinced them to take the fifteen minutes it took to pay the individual permit fees and get it over with.\n\nWith the threat of park eviction neutralized, we proceeded to nose our way down some wooded trails that wound around the lake. Most trails ended at the water’s edge, where we would get out and explore a bit on foot by the shore, then get back in the GX and go find something else interesting.\n\nSomething about the abandoned junk and graffiti drove us to explore even further out. Brad especially didn’t want to go where just anyone could go. If we were still close enough to civilization that people were abandoning plumbing fixtures, we were too close. So we jumped back into the GX and looked for more trails.\n\nBrad has always been kind to share the GX with other people. Whenever we came across a trail with a few tricky spots, he was happy to let someone else take the wheel and try out the GX’s capabilities. Often we ran across deep, craggy ruts like small canyons of red clay, or mud puddles, which we get out and inspect. Then the new driver negotiated the obstacle with a little help from the spotters outside. Obstacles are part of the fun if you’re into over-landing. Fallen tree? We’ll yank it out of the way with the GX. A little mud? The GX has locking differentials to pull us through. Meth lab? The GX has a steering wheel and we can turn around and go back the way we came.\n\nWe definitely had our share of mud and fallen trees (no meth labs; that was hyperbole). Brad had these handy “snatch straps”, which are like big tow straps with some elasticity to them that allowed us to pull on very heavy objects without shocking the vehicle. More than once, we came across a fallen tree blocking the trail that was maybe six inches in diameter, and managed to pull it out of the way in only a few minutes. Away from societal norms and disapproving mothers, four grown men can easily turn into four little boys, and it gave us a great, childish pleasure to step on the gas and drag a big ol’ tree several hundred yards down a wooded trail.\n\nThings were going smoothly until we came to a rather benign-looking puddle fairly deep into one of the trails. The dirt path opened up to a wide spot, wide enough for two cars to pass. But to one side was what looked like a muddy pond, and the other side was slightly tilted. Having just come crashing through several other muddy spots on the trail, it didn’t seem like a dangerous spot. Nevertheless, we got out and looked at it. I ran a stick into the muddy water and discovered that the puddle was much deeper than the other places we’d just gone through, maybe eighteen inches deep. My vote was to go around the puddle on the drier ground. But Brad was concerned about the angle of the trail. Recently, he had ventured out with his buddy Alex, who also has a GX, on some difficult trails and nearly flipped the top-heavy Lexus on several occasions, so he eyed the trail’s camber with suspicion.\n\nWe went back and forth for a while, arguing over which was best.\n\nEventually, I said, “It’s your call, Brad. It’s your machine.” Some part of me must have been afraid of making the wrong call insistently and flipping a car that belonged to someone else.\n\n“I’m going through it,” said Brad.\n\nAs he inched forward over the edge of the puddle, the GX suddenly fell deep into the ooze, to the surprise of us all. Brad stopped. The engine was still running, but the radiator fan could be heard slapping at the invading water. Brad got out to look at the situation, which had unfolded in no time at all. He shook his head in dismay.\n\nFor the next five hours, we attempted to pull the GX from it’s quagmire with every trick we could think of. Jordan piled rocks and sticks behind the tires, both front and back (the GX is all-wheel-drive). Two of us hopped up and down on the back bumper while the driver gunned the throttle, hoping for a little traction. We even tried a trick I had seen on an episode of MacGyver, where a big stick was fed through a rope to lift a giant dugout canoe off of a woman pinned underneath. To my credit, the MacGyver trick did inch the GX a little further out of the mud.\n\nBut it nearly broke my arm.\n\nAs time went on and we got more desperate, we wound the big stick tighter and tighter through the snatch strap, which we used instead of a rope. Sawyer and I were positioned on either side of the stick, handing it to each other while Jordan stepped on the gas, sending plumes of carbon monoxide into our faces. With the the snatch strap tight as a banjo string and the force of the stick coming back at us with spooky force, one of us slipped, and suddenly my arm was caught between the strap and the stick.\n\nFire coursed through my arm. It felt like it was in a vice, or like I’d just been hit with a baseball bat.\n\n“BRAD! BRAD!” I yelled at the top of my lungs.\n\nBrad, who had been monitoring the traction at the front of the GX, came barreling over to my aid. He and Sawyer managed to relieve the pressure enough to get my arm out, which I feared was broken. Immediately, I walked off down the trail trying to “walk it off”, rubbing my arm, my heart throbbing as blood rushed to the problem area. As I glanced over my shoulder at the wreckage, I saw Brad on his butt in the mud with the stick spinning around dangerously, like the propellor on a rubber band-powered airplane. Thank God, he didn’t get hit in the head.\n\nMy arm wasn’t broken, but at that point I was done trying to get the car out. Everyone except for Jordan felt defeated. Jordan doggedly refused to give up, and never stopped piling rocks and sticks behind the tires in new ways in an effort to exhume the GX from its watery grave. I admired his outlook, but couldn’t bring myself to share it. Brad called his friend Alex in Smyrna, Tennessee and explained the situation to him, begging for a rescue. Alex graciously said he would be there in the morning.\n\nThe wind picked up as we set up camp. By now, darkness had set in, and distant lightning flashes lit up the sky ominously. The forecast had not originally called for storms, but apparently the meteorologists missed the mark. Jordan and I shared a tent, which we pitched right on the trail by the GX. After nursing the scraped up place on my arm with a little iodine and a few bandages, we had just enough time to cook a few bratwurst over a small fire before a deluge blew in.\n\nBasically, we slept through a thunderstorm at the top of a ridge in Kentucky that night. I prayed several times through the night that nothing would happen to us. Jordan was legitimately concerned that a tree would fall on our little tent while we slept, and considered joining Brad, who was sleeping inside the GX, half submerged though it was. Originally, Brad intended to sleep in the pop-up tent he installed on top of the GX, but in our current situation, he thought it best not to mess with it.\n\nAround nine that morning, Alex came splashing down the trail in a nearly identical Lexus GX 470. It was the first time we’d seen another human since we left the main road. Alex exhibited no fear as he piloted his Lexus through the same spots we so cautiously maneuvered the day before, confident, like a seasoned veteran. In about twenty minutes, Alex had rescued us from our dire strait. Using his own snatch strap, he fastened one end to his GX and the other to Brad’s GX. Starting with several feet of slack in the line, he made a running go down the trail in the opposite direction and plucked our car out of the mud with shocking ease.\n\nWe packed up the GX quickly, and began riding trails again, trying to make up for lost time yesterday as well as make the trip worth Alex’s while. As we crossed a low-water bridge through a creek, the trees opened up into a beautiful meadow of wildflowers, nestled in a hollow between ridges. It was now about noon, so we decided this would make a great place to have lunch. Jordan set out his folding chair while Sawyer went to go skip rocks in the creek. We made a few turkey sandwiches on Sara Lee bread and washed them down with some root beer, the kind that come in the glass bottles. It was balm to the soul after the night we had.\n\nI’m not a road warrior. My butt has far too little padding to do a fool thing like sit on it for ten hours at a stretch. But somehow my darling sister, Hannah, talked me into a road trip to New Orleans after I casually mentioned wanting to use my vacation time on an actual vacation. Stay-cations don’t count (because, you know…covid). But we didn’t just make a beeline for New Orleans like all the other saps out there. No. If we were going to road-trip at all, we were going to see America. Or, at least the southeastern part of America. Our plan involved a museum in Memphis, dropping through Jackson, Mississippi to figure out what the heck Johnny Cash and June Carter were singing about (wrong Jackson, as we found out), eating some tasty food in New Orleans, then buzzing over to the Redneck Riviera and sitting on a beach in Alabama. Of course, nothing went according to plan, but if it did this would be just another boring travel blog about perfect people taking perfect vacations doing every thing perfectly. And do you really want to read about that? I didn’t think so.\n\nBut first, I had to mow my grass.\n\nYes, this is relevant. You see, I live in a community with an HOA, and if your grass gets too high in an HOA, they mail you a letter. I don’t like letters from my HOA. So I mowed my grass, which was already flirting with “abandoned lot” territory, before heading out on our week-long trip. And I did it without a dust mask...in the month of May. Yes, this is also relevant. You see, I’ve been allergic to everything but dogs and water ever since my mama popped me out. That includes grass.\n\nWe set off that Sunday for West Tennessee from Nashville with my nose in a non-functioning condition, on our way to surprise my uncle (who lives in Humboldt, Tennessee) at church on our way to Memphis. I-40 through West Tennessee is about as interesting to drive as reading a statistics textbook, so we were glad to take a break for a while with my uncle and his family. We went to church, ate some sketchy Mexican food, and were on the road again.\n\nOur first stop in Memphis was Stax Records.\n\nPeople like to say I was born in the wrong decade. Some say the wrong century. While most of my schoolmates grew up listening to Maroon 5, Kenny Chesney, and Britney Spears, I was listening to the oldies. At an early age, another one of my uncles introduced me to an oldies station that played a lot of ‘60s and ‘70s music, and I was hooked. As such, I listened to a lot of Motown, and while Stax and Motown were two different recording studios, their sounds were similar, though what came out of Memphis was more bluesy and raw than the polished stuff from Detroit. Hannah and I wandered through the exhibits and learned about the influence Black gospel music and the blues had on almost every other genre, and all the famous people who recorded at Stax (Albert King, the Staple Singers, Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, Booker T. & the M.G.s, etc.). I definitely recommend it if Soul and Blues is your thing.\n\nAfter Stax, we took our stuff to our little Airbnd apartment off Main Street and then wandered around until we hit Beale Street, just to say we’d been there. It was a bit too much like Broadway in “Nash Vegas” in my opinion. Too many people. Too much wild’n’crazy. But this is coming from the guy referred to as a ninety-five year-old man by his contemporaries. So maybe you would love Beale Street.\n\nBack at the Airbnb, we topped off our evening by watching the Little Mermaid on Disney Plus, then caught some Zs. After some coffee and breakfast the next morning, we were ready to hit the road and take on the world.\n\nOr Hannah was. Memphis was when my face decided it would trade places with Old Faithful and start spewing fluids to cope with the Tennessee Spring air, and punish me for not wearing a dust mask when I mowed my jungle before we left. Also, the camera battery died in my 35mm Canon AE-1 film camera right after Stax, so it was definitely Hannah who was ready to take on the world. Not me.\n\nMeanwhile, somewhere in an overseas corporate office, a negligence was brewing that would cast a black cloud over a portion of our trip. The place we had booked in New Orleans was a cross between an Airbnb and a hotel. No one at the check-in desk. You sign a lease to stay there for a couple nights. Very weird set-up. Hannah had booked the room in her name, but used my card, which made everything massively complicated. As we set off Saturday morning, panicked that they didn’t have all the paperwork they thought they needed, they sent me a form to fill out that I had already filled out. I generously complied, and assumed everything was now sunshine and lollipops.\n\nThe trek from Memphis to New Orleans was somewhat uneventful, marked only by the slap of the windshield wipers and the number of classic country songs we listened to. Barbecue was eaten. Jackson, Mississippi was driven through. The Lynyrd Skynyrd crash site was visited. Lake Ponchartrain was crossed.\n\nBut sitting outside our supposed resting place for the next two nights was not uneventful. There we were, just having driven five hundred miles, and weren’t able to get into the building. A vacant reception desk was visible through the locked front door. We sat parked on the street in the Warehouse District on the phone with the company that owned the building for two hours. Every minute that passed left us angrier and angrier. We had filled out their paperwork. Many times, in fact. But they were saying we didn’t complete it correctly.\n\nAs the sun got lower in the New Orleans sky, I decided I’d had enough. I got out of the car so Hannah could stay on the phone with the company while I called a Hampton Inn a few blocks away, by the Convention Center. I gave them my card number. We got a room. It was painless. When I got back in, I asked to speak with the supervisor of the company we originally booked, furious at this point. As we drove to the Hampton Inn, we canceled our booking and demanded our money back, which they wouldn’t give because we were “canceling with less than 24-hours notice.” That meant we were out $350 dollars, just like that (after three months, I got my money back after filing a dispute through my credit card company).\n\nLike I said…black cloud.\n\nAfter the adrenaline of fighting with corporate drones wore off, our weariness got the better of us and we finally passed out. The next morning we started fresh, after sleeping in, of course. Hannah had done the legitimately difficult job of planning our New Orleans itinerary. “Difficult” because every single person we talked to about our trip had different ideas about what we should do and where we should eat. Some recommendations assumed we would be willing to sell our kidneys to pay for a meal (we were not). Some assumed we would be willing to enter indentured servitude to shop in bougie stores that we couldn’t even afford back home (wrong).\n\nCafé Beignet was the first place Hannah picked that morning. It was definitely worth the long line to get in, and definitely worth squeezing into their ancient, broom-closet-sized restroom (always use the restroom whenever you eat at a restaurant in New Orleans, because public toilets are impossible to find).\n\nBeignets are like square donuts, only they’re as light and fluffy as air, covered with powdered sugar. In other words, they’re the refined, elegant pastry that donuts want to be when they grow up. But the rest of the breakfast was delicious, too. The scrambled eggs were buttery and rich. The bacon was crisp and savory.\n\nAfter breakfast we went exploring.\n\nIf you didn’t know this, Bourbon Street in New Orleans is the birthplace of jazz. I am a jazz aficionado. But it’s been a long time since the doctor first slapped baby jazz in the birthing room, and people no longer go to Bourbon Street to listen to jazz. They go there to party hard and watch peep shows. However, if you’d like the French Quarter experience without Bourbon Street’s spin on it, I recommend Royal Street (pronounced “Royale”, because…French). Royal Street was really quite pleasant. The buildings are so neat to look at with their Spanish iron work and brick, weathered by the years. There were so many places to shop and purchase artwork. I even got to see an original Norman Rockwell painting from only a few inches away in what seemed like a museum where the priceless artifacts were for sale. I didn’t touch anything.\n\nIf I had two eating places to recommend to someone planning a trip to New Orleans, one would be Café Beignet, of course, but the other would be Central Grocery. Central Grocery claims to have invented the original muffuletta, a delicious sandwich with salami, ham, and olive salad created by Italian immigrants back in the day. Whether or not they actually made the first one, Central Grocery’s muffulettas were definitely a tasty punch in the mouth. And the building is legitimately an old grocery store. You can even buy cans of soup there. It authentically has the kind of atmosphere that some businesses try to create artificially.\n\nBy now, the goo in my head had congealed like a bottle of Elmer’s Glue left open, so went from a prolonged allergic reaction to a full-on sinus infection in the middle of our New Orleans trip. The next couple of nights were spent breathing noisily through my gaping mouth, coughing, and blowing my nose into too-thin tissues which were thrown on the hotel room floor throughout the night, to be collected when I could see in in the morning. Hannah was a trooper for putting up with it.\n\nAfter a brief trip to the Walgreens on Canal Street, I armed myself with decongestant and tissue packets (like the kind your grandmother keeps in her purse) and prepared to trudge on.\n\nThe second day was partially spent exploring outside the French Quarter.\n\nI’m a simple man, really. I’ll take a Chic-Fil-A number one combo over a fancy, white tablecloth meal any day. So it might not surprise you that one of my favorite things to do in New Orleans was to simply ride the street cars. Hannah got us two-day passes to ride as much as we wanted, and while slow, the street cars are a real form of transportation around the city. Plus, they transport you back in time. The streets are wide enough for two lanes in either direction, plus two sets of rails in a sandy median where the street cars clatter back and forth, trying not to hit runners in yoga pants. We sat on the hard wooden benches and watched the lovely Garden District pass by through the open, school-bus like windows.\n\nAll good things must come to an end, and so after two days of listening to jazz on Jackson Square, shopping, and eating muffulettas, it was time to move along.\n\nNext stop, the beach.\n\nThe hotel in Orange Beach, Alabama was three hours away. We left a city where every street was dripping with history and character, and entered a place that existed solely for tourists. I suppose each place has its purpose. New Orleans broadens your horizons with its story and blending of cultures. Orange Beach allows you to kick back on the sand and do absolutely nothing all day. And that was our plan.\n\nBeing May, however, meant a very windy Gulf of Mexico. It was so windy, in fact, that we could only see a mile or so up the beach before things began to look like the Dust Bowl. We sat in our lawn chairs by the surf for about twenty minutes, the left sides of our faces being nicely exfoliated by all the wind-blown sand, before we gave it up and went back to the hotel. The rest of the day was spent watching cartoons in the hotel room like a couple of grade school kids (only without hiding the remote from each other), and sitting by the pool where there was no risk of sand blowing up your swim trunks.\n\nMexico City, or “CDMX” as all the purple taxis refer to it, is one of those places that, when you say you’ve been there, people stop and frown and say “How was that?”, as though in their mind you should have been shot, stabbed, or kidnapped down there instead of talking to them over a mocha latte. “It was great!” I’ll reply, then follow up with, “We went with someone that grew up there. You know…someone that knew what neighborhoods to avoid.” Satisfied with my explanation of why I’m not shot, stabbed, or kidnapped, the person I’m talking to will make polite for a few minutes as I try to describe what a colorful, lively, and wonderful place Mexico City is, but the lights never really come on, and the magic of my trip remains inside my own head.\n\nAnd yes, in case you were wondering, Mexico City can be dangerous. So can driving your car. So can playing pick-up games at the rec center. So can putting your pants on in the morning. However, I returned from there in one piece, and it was so worth it. In fact, it was so worth it that I actually had to overcome some serious post-vacation depression when I got back. Let me show you what I mean.\n\nWhen the opportunity first came up, I was working an empty, silent office and must have listened to hundreds of adventure podcasts to fill the void and keep me out of a straight jacket. So when my friends at church approached me about going to Mexico City, I jumped at the chance, ready to live out my Walter Mitty-esque day dreams. After a red-eye connection through Miami, passport in hand, I was on my way. I wouldn’t say I was nervous going through customs in Mexico, but it was definitely a new experience. The customs agent and I had a brief conversation (in English) about my visit, and then waved me on into the rest of the airport.\n\nFor some odd reason, the cell towers in Nashville didn’t reach Mexico City, so I had no way of calling my American friends to pick me up. I wandered the concourse with my leather “4-H is All That Jazz” duffel bag looking around, wondering what I would do if I couldn’t find my friends, when this white kid came up to me out of the mass of Spanish-speakers, pointed to my Atlanta Braves hat and said in American English, “Go Braves.” I smiled at him. Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world…\n\nThe two members of our party tasked with meeting me at the airport, Paul S. and Max, attempted to skulk through an entire concourse to sneak up on me, but my Jason Bourne skills were too much for them, and I spotted them long before they got close. Paul S. is a rather tall man from Kentucky who married a beautiful Mexican woman named Yara (pronounced “Jah-dah”) after meeting her on a beach in Mexico (no, it’s not the plot of a chick-flick, but it should be). Yara, having grown up in Mexico City, was our guide for the trip. The other would-be sneaker-upper, Max, is a retired investigator who frequently stays in South American countries for months at a time, and whose life story would easily nominate him for the title “most interesting man in the world.” After a ride in a stick-shift Volkswagen taxi we meet up with the rest of the gang at the hotel in an area called Zona Rosa, an area known for its restaurants and nightclubs (no nightclubs were visited in the writing of this blog).\n\nWith my nose practically pressed against the taxi window like a five-year-old, the first thing that popped into my head as I watched the city go by was that it seemed like a “toy city.” I don’t mean that in a derogatory way. What I mean is that things in the United States are so big, grey, and spread out, while things in Mexico City seemed so small, colorful, and tightly knit. The people, the cars, and the buildings are all more compact than their American counterparts, but aren’t afraid to stand out with flashy clothes and brightly-colored hues. But that’s just my take on it.\n\nThe rest of our crew met when we arrived us at the hotel. Brad and Caitlin are a married couple in their thirties from our church in Middle Tennessee. Brad’s a big guy with a soft heart and loud laugh. Caitlin’s a small, fiery red-head who suffers no fools and wishes Brad would laugh more quietly. Mitch, the preacher at our church, and his fifteen-year-old son Dayne are also with us. Mitch is a short Hawaiian man with a competitive streak a mile wide, and who can’t deliver common colloquialisms to save his life, but we’ll burn that bridge when we get to it. Dayne, who looks just like Mitch in the ‘80s, is a teenage ball of energy, bouncing from one interest to another, but learning at a frightening pace when he finally zeroes in on something, like speaking Spanish with other teenagers at the little church in Teoloyucan. Finally, there’s Paul B. and his fifteen-year old daughter, Sierra. Paul B. is a cerebral kind of guy who looks like he’s jumped out of airplanes in the military; put-together, always ready to go. Sierra is a pretty blonde girl with a knack for leadership and public service, who’s probably going to be elected to congress one day.\n\nThe first full day we spent as typical tourists, riding the train and seeing the sights. One of the most colorful places we went was Xochimilco, famous for their boat rides. By boat rides, I mean a heavy wooden boat painted with several layers of primary colored-paint with a tin roof, driven by a man with a long wooden pole. The boats have benches and a table for eating on our Mexican river cruise. As we float down river, vendors in other boats quickly discover that Americans are aboard, and begin peppering us with offers of Mexican dishes like elote, a tangy mixture made with corn, and tamales, which we gladly trade a few pesos for. Mariachi bands float up and down the river, too. I decided to hire one.\n\n“What song do you want?” says the band leader in broken English.\n\nI say, “‘Stardust,’” like an idiot. ‘Stardust’ is a jazz standard written by Hoagy Carmichael.\n\n“You do not want to hear a Mexican song?” the band leader says with a justifiably puzzled look.\n\nI look at Paul S. and say, “I don’t know what to ask for.”\n\n“‘Guadalajara’ is a classic,” Paul replies.\n\n“‘Guadalajara,’” I parroted, handing the man my money.\n\nThe food there was amazing. Mexican restaurants in American neighborhoods don’t even come close. A quesadilla at any run-of-the-mill Mexican or Tex-Mex place back home means a burnt tortilla filled with too much cheese and maybe a shred or two of chicken if you’re lucky. In Mexico City, we walked into a cinderblock building with only a roll-up door for front wall, flies buzzing everywhere, shouting at each other over the din of a fan, and waited on stainless steel stools for a woman in a hair net to dish up the best quesadilla of my life. The cheese-to-meat ratio was on point. The tortilla wasn’t just a tortilla. It was some fluffy, flaky corn wrapping of delight, like a Pillsbury croissant. I washed it down with a Mexican Coke in a glass bottle. Perfection.\n\nDay two was about visiting a small church in a nearby town called Teoloyucan. We found out about local preacher named Daniel (in Spanish it sounds like “Danielle”) through a connection that Yara made a few years ago, and since then our church in middle Tennessee has been sending money to help him preach and teach around Mexico City. His efforts connected him with other preachers, such as Juan, who preaches in Teoloyucan. We met up with Daniel and his family at the church in Mexico City, then walked to a bus stop where we caught a bus out of town. Buses in Mexico are different. Imagine our interstate system in the United States, only with bus stops on them, with pedestrian bridges to get folks from one side of the bustling highway to the other without becoming a character in Frogger. A one-hour bus ride outside of CDMX put us in Teoloyucan.\n\nThe church in Teoloyucan was a simple one-room brick building with a concrete floor and a tin roof within a brick-walled compound for security. As part of the worship, we sang a few songs out of their Spanish hymnal, which had familiar tunes but very unfamiliar words. I mumbled along as best I could. I’m a fine mumbler when I want to be. Mitch preached a short sermon through an interpreter named Elver. He kept his sentences short so that Elver wouldn’t have so much to process and regurgitate in his native language.\n\nLater, I came up to Mitch and said, “I guess it’s nice preaching with an interpreter. It gives you more time to think what to say next.”\n\n“Actually,” he replied, “it’s not so nice. It messes up my flow of thought.”\n\nNot train of thought. Flow.\n\nAfterwards, the church fired up a make-shift grill using what appeared to be a big pizza pan spanning a couple of cinderblocks with a fire underneath. The July sun had finally burned through what had been a cloudy day and shone down with some intensity onto my unprotected arms, which were a shade of pink later that night. We stood around in the little walled-in yard, hanging out near Elver so he could translate for us as we talked with the church family there. There was lots of smiling and nodding. Smells of grilled chicken, peppers, and onions wafted our way from the grill. Lemme tell ya, those Mexican ladies could cook. We loaded our plates with the fajita mix on top of corn tortillas. It was delicious, naturally. Finished, I went to throw away the paper plate and plastic utensils I had eaten with, but the older man holding the trash bag stopped me and collected them for washing later, which made me feel a trifle careless. Not that he was cross with me. On the contrary, everyone was so kind and eager to learn more about us, and we were just as eager to learn more about them. We left Teoloyucan with a sense of warmth and connection, and then promptly fell asleep on the bus ride back.\n\nLater that week, we paid a visit to Coyoacán, a picturesque city square surrounded by shops, lush green trees, park benches, and people milling about. We met up with some of the church members from Mexico City to go exploring in the area. A group of us loitered by a park bench until everyone arrived. My Spanish was meager, but I had been practicing before our trip, and I was picking it up fast, being totally immersed in it. A real sink or swim scenario. I was having a conversation with a woman with a twelve-year-old daughter, who Dayne was presently entertaining. Maybe I was teasing Mitch for being short (because he is) or something like that and I laughed, when suddenly, with the sweetest face, she touched my cheek and said, “Tienes una sunrisa bonita, “ or in English, “You have a beautiful smile.”\n\nAw shucks.\n\nDayne and I went off with some of the younger folks just off the square in Coyoacán into what I might call a cross between a farmers’ market, a flea market, and a Middle Eastern bazaar. The building looked like a storage facility, only instead of storing junk, people were selling things out of them like booths. There was color everywhere. Colorful fruits, colorful clothes for sale, colorful spoons (I bought one)… I searched diligently for a bottle of Mexican vanilla. I couldn’t even tell you where I heard this, but somewhere I heard the legends of the vanilla from Mexico, and I was bound and determined to find the superior liquid somewhere on our trip. The Mexican kids in our posse didn’t understand my enthusiasm, but helped me look for it, anyhow. I came away with a brown plastic bottle of vanilla with eerily similar qualities to that of American vanilla, but at least it came from Mexico. That’s what counts right?"
