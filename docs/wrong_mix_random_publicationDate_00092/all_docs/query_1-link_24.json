        "text": "Fame over Format\n\nGive us this day, August 20, our daily Elvis\n\n1882\n\nTchaikovsky’s “1812 Overture” debuted in Moscow.\n\n1920\n\nAmerica’s first commercial radio station began operations in Detroit, Michigan. They were assigned the call letters 8MK by the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of Navigation. In 1922 the call letters were changed to WWJ and today the station’s listenership ranks as one of the highest in its market.\n\nAugust 20, 1955\n\n“Maybellene” by Chuck Berry debuted on the charts.\n\nBillboard magazine reviews Elvis Presley’s “I Forgot To Remember To Forget” by saying, “This (record) is certain to get strong initial exposure. Presley is currently on the best selling charts with ‘Baby Let’s Play House’ and the wide acceptance of this side should ease the way for the new disk.” The song would go on to top the Billboard National Country Music Chart and reach #4 on the Billboard Most Played By Jockeys chart in February, 1956, giving Elvis his first national exposure.\n\nElvis performed at the Louisiana Hayride, municipal Auditorium, Shreveport.\n\nAugust 20, 1956\n\nElvis reported to Fox for preproduction on “The Reno Brothers” which would be renamed “Love Me Tender”\n\nAugust 20, 1960\n\nConnie Francis begins working on her acting debut as filming for MGM’s Where the Boys Are starts in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nElvis Presley’s single “It’s Now Or Never” hit #1 in the U.S.\n\nFlaming Star\n\nAugust 20, 1961\n\nFollow That Dream\n\nAugust 20, 1963\n\nViva Las Vegas\n\nAugust 20, 1966\n\nThe Beatles touring America for the last time, were forced to cancel and reschedule their performance in Cincinnati’s open-air stadium, Crosley Field. Heavy rain (and no cover provided) made electrocution a virtual certainty if The Beatles had attempted to perform.\n\nAugust 20,1967\n\nA new noise reduction system for recording of both albums and tapes was developed by R. and D.W. Dolby, a modified version of the process already in use in recording studios.\n\nSpeedway\n\nAugust 20,1968\n\nThe director of the University of Tennessee’s audio lab, Dr. David M. Lipscomb, reported that a guinea pig subjected over a three month period to 88 hours of Rock music recorded at a Knoxville disco at 120 decibels suffered acute damage to the inner ears. Steve Paul, the owner of a New York disco replied, “Should a major increase in guinea pig attendance occur at The Scene, we’ll certainly bear their comfort in mind.”\n\nAugust 20, 1969\n\nAfter finishing ‘I Want You, (She’s So Heavy), The Beatles worked on the running order for the Abbey Road album. A preliminary master tape was compiled, the medley was originally slated for side one of the album, and the placement of ‘Octopus’s Garden’ and ‘Oh! Darling’ were reversed from the final version. The album was to end with the slashed guitar chord that finishes ‘I Want You (She’s So Heavy)’. This was the last time all four Beatles were together in Abbey Road studios.\n\nFrank Zappa temporarily disbands The Mothers of Invention right after an eight day tour in Canada. Zappa says he’s “tired of playing for people who clap for all the wrong reasons.”\n\nElvis did Dinner and Midnight Vegas Shows\n\nAugust 20, 1970\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival‘s album “Cosmo’s Factory” reaches #1 on the Billboard Hot 200, a position it would hold for nine weeks.\n\nDinner and Midnight Vegas Shows / That’s the Way It Is Production\n\nAugust 20, 1971\n\nDinner and Midnight Vegas Shows\n\nAugust 20, 1972\n\nDinner and Midnight Vegas Shows\n\nAugust 20, 1973\n\nBruce Springsteen played the first of a seven night run at Oliver’s in Boston, Massachusetts playing two 60-minute sets each night.\n\nGladys Knight & the Pips released the single “Midnight Train to Georgia”.\n\nThe Rolling Stones release “Angie”, which will top the Billboard chart and reach #5 in the UK. At the time, the Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition was rumored to have been written about David Bowie’s first wife Angela, the actress Angie Dickinson, Keith Richards’ newborn daughter Dandelion Angela, and Marianne Faithfull. However, in his 2010 memoir Life, Richards said that he had chosen the name at random when writing the song, before he knew that his baby would be named Angela or even knew that his baby would be a girl.\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band released the single “Ramblin’ Man”.\n\nDinner and Midnight Vegas Shows\n\nAugust 20, 1974\n\nDespite the ovations on opening night, despite the reviews, all the new material was gone and the show was back to usual. Dinner and Midnight Vegas Shows\n\nElvis Presley with Jeanette and Freddy Cannon\n\nth Jackie Wilson and his girlfriend Lynn Crochet and Jeanette and Freddy Cannon in Las Vegas on August 20, 1974\n\nAugust 20, 1975\n\nAt the last minute Elvis wanted to cancel his two evening shows, because he wasn’t feeling well, but the Colonel insisted that Elvis should go on stage after all. The Vegas Engagement ended and the next 36 shows were cancelled.\n\nElvis did Dinner and Midnight Vegas Shows\n\nBackstage in Las Vegas with fan Chantal Dambremont from Belgium on August 20, 1975\n\nAugust 20, 1977\n\nBarbra Streisand topped the Adult Contemporary chart for a fourth week with “My Heart Belongs to Me”.\n\nThe Emotions scored a #1 song with “Best of My Love”. That ended three weeks at the top forAndy Gibb’s “I Just Want To Be Your Everything”. Rita Coolidge was up with “(Your Love Has Lifted Me) Higher and Higher” but Peter Frampton slipped after peaking at #2 with “I’m In You”. The Commodores were up to #5 with their great song “Easy” and Pablo Cruise came in sixth with “Whatcha’ Gonna’ Do?”. The rest of the Top 10: Peter McCann with “Do You Wanna’ Make Love”,Crosby, Stills & Nash had their first Top 10 hit with “Just a Song Before I Go”, Alice Cooper’s “You and Me” sat at #9 and the Bay City Rollers remained at 10 with “You Made Me Believe In Magic”.\n\n1997\n\nAlabama Governor Fob James joined the mayors of Montgomery and Georgina, AL, in the Alabama State Capitol to dedicate a 50-mile stretch of Interstate 65 to the memory of Hank Williams. The section of roadway was renamed the “Hank Williams Memorial Lost Highway.”\n\n2010\n\nA section of Interstate Highway 40 outside Memphis, Tennessee was named the “Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway” by the state of Tennessee on what would have been his 68th birthday.\n\nA New York judge dismissed a $300 million lawsuit brought against Michael Jackson’s estate by Allgood Entertainment, who accused Jackson and his agent Frank Dileo of pulling out of the company’s planned Jackson 5 shows. The turning point it seems was the fact that Michael and his brothers never signed the deal.\n\n2016\n\nCanada’s The Tragically Hip performed their last concert to a sell-out crowd in Kingston, Ontario at the end of an emotional fifteen date farewell tour. Lead singer Gord Downie revealed earlier in year that he was battling terminal brain cancer.\n\nAlice Cooper told CNN that he had decided to run for President Of The United States and had chosen actor Tom Hanks as his running mate. With tongue firmly in cheek, he said that his campaign slogan is “I can do nothing as well as they can do nothing,” referencing Democratic and Republican Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, adding that his platform is “nonexistent.”\n\nOur Daily Elvis for August 10, 2018\n\nGive Us This Day, Our Daily Elvis\n\nDaily Elvis: August 10\n\nClick the above for the complete Daily Elvis posting\n\nThe Updated for 2018 are:\n\nAdded the Elvis Era Headers to the original post,\n\nOur Daily Elvis, along with:\n\nthe following updates to the original Daily Elvis Post:\n\nTupelo, Mississippi\n\n1935-1948\n\nMemphis, Tennessee\n\n1949 – 1977\n\nThe Sun Records Rockabilly Era\n\nAugust 10, 1955\n\nTwo weeks after it cracked the Billboard R&B Top Ten, Chuck Berry‘s “Maybellene” enters the Pop chart at #23.
