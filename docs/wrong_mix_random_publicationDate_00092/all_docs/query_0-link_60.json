The society was created as a means to aid landslayts. In 1937, the society joined with four other Lomzer organizations, and together, formed the United Lomzer Relief Committee to aid the inhabitants of Lomza. The society also sponsored loan funds that went towards aiding the poor. Jewish presence in Lomza dates to the 14th century, however due to a \"non de tolerandis Judaeis\", the Jews of Lomza were only able to begin establishing themselves as a community by the 19th century. They flourished in the trade and artisan professions and created a number of industrial societies. The Jewish community of Lomza equally took part in politics, supporting the Zionist Movement, and creating political organizations to endorse Jewish activism. The community also maintained a number of cultural organizations and institutions such as libraries and theater groups.\n\nCategory: Societies\n\nLearn More\n\nMakower Young Men's Aid Society\n\nThe Makower Young Men's Aid Society was founded by immigrants from Makow, Poland in 1907. The society is affiliated with United Relief, which was established after WWI to help aid \"landslayts\" (neighboring Jews). It was re-established after 1945 to help aid WWII survivors. The Jews of Makow made a comfortable living by engaging in the trade and artisan professions. Communally, they established two cemeteries, synagogues, schools for the youths, libraries, and a cultural/education theater program. Despite the economic and political environment of the 1930s, the Jews of Makow maintained their own, engaging in the growing Zionist efforts and creating societies. The ~4000 Jews of Makow perished in the Holocaust, but their memories live on.\n\nCategory: Societies\n\nLearn More\n\n1st Radomer Congregation\n\nThe first Radomer Congregation was founded in New York in 1903 by immigrants from Radom, Poland. In 1917, the society founded the United Radomer Relief for U.S. and Canada. Although they began residing in the town in the 1560s, permission to do so was repeatedly revoked. It was not until 1814 that the Jews of Radom were able to live and move freely within the town. The community was then able to establish itself more concretely, beginning the works for a cemetery, a synagogue, a hospital, and other communal institutions. The Jewish community made their living in the trade, artisan, and banking professions. They also facilitated and contributed to the industrialization of the town through an influx of factories. Many left Radom and Poland in the 1930s due to pogroms and a worsening economy. Following the German invasion in 1939, almost 32,000 Jews (Radom and neighboring towns) perished in the Holocaust. In 1965, only 7 of Radom's Jews remained in the town.\n\nCategory: Societies\n\nLearn More\n\nClara Hirschhorn: The Smallest Survivor\n\nClara was repeatedly told that she looked as tiny as an 8-year-old when she was 14!

The society was dissolved in 2001. Dating their initial presence in the 17th century, the Jewish community of Ostrowiec was economically and communally comfortable. With their own synagogue, a cemetery, and the effects of industrialization, the community grew. Their participation in the 19th century uprisings and Zionists movements allowed the Ostroweic Jews to establish themselves politically. The weakened economy of Poland during World War I resulted in many fleeing abroad. The town of Ostroweic was captured by the Germans following their invasion of Poland in 1939. When the town was liberated by the Red Army in 1945, only 193 Jews remained, with over 10,000 having perished in the labor and concentration camps.\n\nCategory: Societies\n\nLearn More\n\nThe Life and Influence of Emanuel Streisand\n\nHe was the father of the timeless Barbara Streisand, a loving Jewish husband. and great educator of his time. \"I must have gotten my detailed, obsessive streak from my father, because my mother wasn't like me at all\", Barbara was quoted in the biography Barbra Streisand Redefining Beauty, Femininity, and Power by Neal Gabler.

The society was founded in 1922, and dissolved in 1999. When Jews first settled in the town of Żabno, they were given a number of privileges, such as permission to open/run their businesses, engage in local trade, and have their own place of worship. This allowed them to develop themselves as a community and flourish. Throughout the 18th and 19th century, the Jewish population of Żabno was contingent upon Poland's economy. The 20th century marks the steady decline of Żabno's Jewish population as a result of extreme poverty and devastation from both World Wars. As a result, many Jews left the town, either traveling overseas or settling in nearby areas like Denmark and Saxony.\n\nCategory: Societies\n\nLearn More\n\nErnest Michel: Auschwitz Survivor & Philanthropist\n\nErnest W.

It was this turn of events that led Max to begin his journey to Frankenthal, where he worked at his father's business selling flowers. He was then again met with antisemitism when his customers refused to buy from him because of his Jewish identity.

Mir was founded in the mid 1300's, sometime before 1345. Jews first started settling in the town in the 1600's. The Jewish population in Mir grew rapidly and by the later half of the seventeenth century, the city was noted as having a large Jewish population. Starting around this time, many of the townspeople were traders and merchants, including many in the town's Jewish population. Later in 1815 marked the opening of the Mir Yeshiva. After its opening many of Mir's Jews made money lodging its students. By the end of the 1800's, the town's population was more than half Jews. ~Blog Writtten by Emily Hazy\n\nCategory: Societies\n\nLearn More\n\nRose Unger: Pishidyaka Camp Holocaust Survivor\n\nFrom riches to the confined gates of the concentration camps, Rose Unger had been through a lot during her time in the Holocaust. Rose was born in the town of Staszow. Born into a family of 7, Rose was no stranger to a packed house. Upon hearing about what was going on in Germany and how Hitler was trying to kill all the Jews, no one could believe it. The Germans were seen as very nice people, so it was hard to fathom such people could be so hateful and mean all of a sudden. Everything changed when the Germans invaded Poland and occupied it; they took many of the Jews's possessions, and they did not allow Jews to do business anymore. One thing Rose remembers about her first encounter with the Nazis was how they sounded when they marched, \"When they marched, you thought the ceiling was falling,\"she recalls. From this point forward, life became a nightmare, starting with Rose and her sister going to the concentration camps. From the moment Rose stepped foot into the camps, she was told about the horrors that went on there. What stands out to her the most is one Yom Kippur they had in the camps when all the girls did not eat anything. The SS officers came, took half of the girls, and killed them. It was the worst Yom Kippur Rose had ever experienced. To try and make things more manageable and bearable, they would sing songs and tell stories to one another. Although life was far from a life worth living, Rose had begun creating a romantic relationship with Henry. He had told her not to go out with anyone else because they would be together one day. Rose thought he was crazy because she did not believe anyone would be alive. She couldn't fathom that anyone would make it out to tell the story. In the end, both Rose and Henry survived the concentration camps, and they got married in 1945.\n\nCategory: Survivors\n\nLearn More\n\nJoseph Goldberg: Polish Holocaust Survivor\n\nJoseph Goldberg had been through a lot, from the comfort of his home to the barbed wire walls of the concentration camps. Joseph was a lone wolf, fighting to survive all the harsh conditions he constantly faced throughout his time in the Holocaust. He started going to work on behalf of his father and ended up being separated from his entire family. The childhood of Joseph is one unlike any person could ever even fathom. The horrors of his story began in Szyszki and continued until Theresienstadt, where he was ultimately liberated. In the concentration camps, there was no thought of what life would look like in the future, but how could a person survive the day? Jospeh's one goal throughout his time in the Holocaust was: \"I must make it to tomorrow,\" An eerie thought that no person should ever have to endure.\n\nCategory: Survivors\n\nLearn More\n\nRabbi Louis Ginzberg: Conserving Tradition\n\nRabbi Louis Ginzberg, born in 1873 in Kaunas, Lithuania, was a prominent Talmudist, Halakhic scholar, and Kabbalist master.

Then, when Lemkin was in his 20s studying law, he discovered that the Ottoman Empire had massacred Armenians during World War I, an event now known as the Armenian Genocide. His conviction that international law should prohibit the annihilation of groups was motivated by his horror at historical and modern instances of group-targeted mass violence. Lemkin believed the suffering of Jews in eastern Poland was a component of a greater pattern of injustice and violence that went back in time and spread around the globe. ~Blog Written by Priya Perumal\n\nCategory: Famous\n\nLearn More\n\nMemorial Day Tribute\n\nWe are honored at Mount Hebron Cemetery to be the final resting place for over 1,800 Veterans.

The society, initially known by its Yiddish name Der Arbeter Ring, was founded in an apartment at 151 Essex Street in New York City. The organization was created in the late 1800's in response to the hardships faced by newly arrived Jewish immigrants. These problems included ones previously faced in their home countries such as exploitative business practices and poor living conditions. These were compounded with new challenges such as integrating into a new country while maintaining traditions. Consequently, the Worker's Circle is historically associated with Jewish Unions and Socialist ideals. Early members and applicants were required to be union members and were expected to vote along pro-labor lines. ~Blog Written by Emily Hazy\n\nCategory: Societies\n\nLearn More\n\nWalter Fuchs: Through His Eyes\n\nWalter J Fuchs was an official U.S. Army Photographer and served in the 40th Infantry Division.
