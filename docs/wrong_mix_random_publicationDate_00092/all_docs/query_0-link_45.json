As he was for 16 seasons, Maestro John Mauceri will be on hand — only this time as a special guest and not as the wildly popular conductor of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. Having left the position after 2006, he returns as one of two inductees, along with Placido Domingo, into the Bowl's Hall of Fame.\n\n\"There couldn't be a Hall of Fame without John Mauceri,\" Manocha said. \"It's still a strange feeling that he's not here anymore.\"\n\nThe star-packed evening will feature guest performances by Jack Black, Jason Alexander and Kristin Chenoweth. Kirk Douglas and Joe Mantegna will be presenters.\n\nFireworks have long blasted the Bowl into its summer of music and dance, and this year is no exception. From July 2-4, the Fireworks Spectacular will honor the American West with country band Riders in the Sky. Two of the most famous cowboys, Gene Autry and John Wayne, will be remembered on their 100th anniversaries.\n\nThe Bowl offers several annual series as well as new offerings. Rarely, however, is an event repeated exactly the same each year.\n\n\"One of those rare examples is Sing-along Sound of Music,'\" Manocha said. \"People love it, so it makes sense to keep bringing it back.\"\n\nHosted by actress and comedian Melissa Peterman (\"Reba\") on June 30, the evening will begin with a parade of audience members dressed as their favorite characters — or objects — from the 1965 movie musical starring Julie Andrews. Then comes the movie, for which the stars on screen are accompanied by a chorus that's several thousand strong.\n\nAnother frequent visitor to the band shell is legendary movie composer John Williams, and he'll be back July 13-14 to conduct the orchestra through some of his more memorable scores, which have garnered him more than 40 Oscar nominations.\n\nA newcomer for 2007 is Oregon indie pop band The Decemberists, which will make its debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic on July 7.\n\nA two-day concert that particularly excites Manocha is \"Sgt. Pepper's at 40 a Beatles Celebration,\" Aug. 10-11, when conductor Edwin Outwater will lead the orchestra through the most famous album by one of pop music's most famous bands.\n\nAccompanying the orchestra will be special \"house band\" Cheap Trick as well as Aimee Mann and Joan Osborne.\n\n\"When I first thought about this idea I had wanted to involve Cheap Trick,\" Manocha said. \"I am a big fan. \"Beatles producer George Martin produced an early Cheap Trick album for which he re-created the end of the song A Day in the Life.' I knew they would be able to do the material justice.\"\n\nThough musicals and operas were first performed at the Bowl more than 70 years ago, it wasn't until the past decade that such shows have become an annual tradition. For the first time last year the event was expanded to three nights, and this year's offering of \"South Pacific\" will also run a long weekend, Aug. 3-5. Reba McEntire and Brian Stokes Mitchell, with musical director Paul Gemignanni, will again tackle the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic that they performed two years ago at Carnegie Hall.\n\n\"We've been talking about it for some time, and finally the stars literally aligned,\" Manocha said.\n\nClassical music with the Los Angeles Philharmonic reigns at the Bowl on most Tuesdays and Thursdays, with Leonard Slatkin and others taking on guest conductor duties. A few of the guest artists this year are pianists Andreas Haefliger, July 12, and Christopher O'Riley, July 17; violinists Sarah Chang, July 26, and Martin Chalifour, Aug. 9; and the Los Angeles Master Chorale, July 31.\n\nHighlights of the Jazz at the Bowl series include Queen Latifah, July 11; Isaac Hayes, Booker T. Jones and other artists from soul label Stax Records, July 18; and \"Jazz at the Movies,\" July 25, in which a big band and strings will play tunes by Duke Ellington, Count Basie and more as clips of classic movies are shown in the background.\n\nAlthough the Bowl solicits top classical, jazz and pop talents, it also has helped promote lesser-known acts.\n\nPink Martini, the 14-member Latin-laced jazz ensemble, has graduated from the bottom of a world music bill at the Bowl to a headliner for its trio of closing night concerts, \"Fireworks Finale,\" Sept. 14-16.\n\nThe concerts will re-create the spirit of the Cocoanut Grove at the recently demolished Los Angeles landmark Ambassador Hotel. Carol Channing and Merv Griffin will be special guests.\n\n— E-mail freelance columnist Jeff Favre at jjfavre@yahoo.com."
