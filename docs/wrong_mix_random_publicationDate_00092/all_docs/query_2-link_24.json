        "text": "Acid Viking back cover (2024)\n\nMy great friend Johnny Alistair sent me his recent album Acid Viking and I am so grateful for his kindness and generosity. It is a very interesting mix of original music and lyrics written by Johnny who also handles the drums with skill and precision. Johnny used some great session players including keyboard legend Lester Snell, a veteran of Stax Records and key contributor to hits by Eddie Floyd, Al Green, Isaac Hayes, Albert King, Mavis Staples and so many others. I asked Johnny what his songwriting process was, melodies first or lyrics?, this was his response, “Songs come to me from dreams, I float out of my body and lift up through a portal. There I find them sitting on a mountain waiting for me. I can physically pick it up and then it enters my consciousness. An owl sitting on a nearby branch delivers these riffs to a waiting spot on the riff mountain and I just go there when the time is right.” Sounds like a great process...\n\nThe record was recorded and mixed to tape, then completely mastered to analog, an old school process. It was never converted to digital, which necessitated an old school engineer with suitably vintage equipment. Enter Greg Calbi, mastering engineer par excellence with over 7500 album credits, including John Lennon “Walls and Bridges,” Lou Reed “Berlin,” Bob Dylan “Blood On The Tracks,” Bruce Springsteen “Born To Run,” David Bowie “Young Americans,” Patti Smith “Easter,” Talking Heads “ Fear Of Music,” and Taylor Swift “Evermore.” Whew, that’s a lot of work and an impressive CV which omits the 7500 other albums which Greg has worked on!\n\nThe music is great, a little heavier than what I listen to now, but it brought back fond memories of Hawkwind’s Hall Of The Mountain Grill, psychedelic space rock at its finest, mixed in with funky echoes of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the sonorous dischord of Mark Lanegan. The album artwork is equally striking, crafted by Todd Alcott who mashes up film noir sensibilities with a mid century ethos. All in, a wonderful effort by all concerned. Thank you Johnny, thank you Lady Owl, please go out and support new artists!\n\nhttps://ladyowl.bandcamp.com\n\nChoice Lady Owl cuts (per BKs request)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAw8gU5B-VA\n\n\"Hits Hard\" Acid Viking 2024\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbEiJLUqvac\n\n\"Acid Viking\" Acid Viking 2024\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx98j34sRfM\n\n\"Lithium\" Acid Viking 2024\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e7Wj1Y5YbY\n\n\"Boom\" Acid Viking 2024\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj0pprJznOw\n\n\"Chilly\" Acid Viking 2024\n\nBonus Cuts:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrLizmL56CY\n\n\"The Psychedelic Warlords (Disappear In Smoke)\" Hawkwind: Hall Of The Mountain Grill 1974\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m9IG66EUe0\n\n\"Nutshell\" Mark Lanegan sings Alice in Chains 2020\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIu3uNZ_-ZI\n\n\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" Mark sings Joy Division 2017\n\nWhen I put out those first records, success came very quickly. When that happens, there are things to do to build on success, and a lot of it I think went against my grain. And also, maybe I wasn’t that good at it. I thought it was a phase, for sure, what a funny phase! And then what’s happened over the years is: no, this isn’t a phase. Actually you might just have to admit that you love what you do, and shut the f*ck up and get on with it. Accept what is possible, and what hasn’t been possible, and where I might have been able to figure it out a bit better and been a better version of myself. Or wish that other people had been better versions of themselves, and not be afraid of my darkness.\n\nBeth Orton\n\nEveryone’s poking you with sticks, What are you, are you successful? What kind of music do you make, what’s your thing?’ I don’t know, I’m just muddling through. I’m a f*cking mess, all right? I’ve become a ‘mother’. I meet my children at the gates of the school, and I don’t know if I am that person, but I’m trying to be. I’m also a singer and a songwriter, and I’ve been famous – did that happen, I’m not sure? Trying to incorporate all those incredibly disparate bits of the self into one is ... I just don’t know any more. I don’t know who the f*ck I am.\n\nBeth Orton\n\nCentral Reservation (1999) signed by Beth\n\nI met Johnny Marr. I’d just come off stage in LA and he was talking to a friend of mine and I was just chatting to the two of them. I didn’t know who this other guy was and I was just talking for about half an hour, getting on really well, having a laugh and then I was just like, So what do you do? And he was like, \"Oh, I play guitar.\" And I thought, Right, okay. And anyone I might have heard of? And he was like, \"Well, maybe. Yeah, The Smiths.\" I was: I know you’re Johnny Marr. Oh, okay, okay and then I sort of expected that embarrassment set in and just thought, Oh, but it didn’t because he’s just such a sweetheart and we just carried on. It was like a blip, and then we went or whatever and just carried on talking. And then it turned out we’re staying in the same hotel, and he came up one evening and we just sat on my balcony drinking wine and playing guitar until like the wee hours, you know, and it was just beautiful. It was like it was amazing. And I had these songs and I was” I’ve got this song” and I had \"Concrete Sky.\" I’ve had that knocking around for a while and and he just got very excited about that song in particular and, and started adding these chords underneath and then sort of said, 'I know, what about this idea for a bridge,' then help me with my chorus, you know and just kind of like galvanized it and I don’t know, made it into what it is really.\n\nBeth Orton\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGVgbKQldEA\n\n\"Concrete Sky\" Daybreaker 2002\n\nThat tag? I don’t mind it as long as it’s not a gimmick. I mean, I was playing around with that and it was my ambition to mix those two things. And it also made me laugh because both of them are such kinds of genres, just full of snobbery. You know, you’ve got your dance snobs and you’ve got your folk snobs and you got this thing. And it was just hilarious to bring it together in a way, and also I just thought it could be really beautiful.\n\nBeth Orton on \"Folktronica\"\n\nDaybreaker is a word I made up when I was talking to Johnny Marr. I was trying to describe how I wanted the song to be outside. You know, like a daybreak, like a song. It’s a daybreak and a song. For example, I’d been at a friend’s house and we were up all night drinking and talking. And he and his wife were there, and we were just having the best night. And before I left in the morning, like 6 a.m., they gave me a copy of Dusty in Memphis (by the great Dusty Springfield). And I went home and I put it on and I watched the sun come up with a head full of dreams and, you know, and you’ll just be like, oh, drifting around. You just had a brilliant night with your friends, and you listen to the most beautiful record you’ve ever heard. That is a daybreaker.\n\nBeth Orton\n\nI don’t think it’s easy, I don’t think it’s easy at all, and I think that sounds whatever it sounds. It’s funny, I was walking past a hotel yesterday with my daughter in New York, and I was like, “I used to stay there,” and she was like, “wow, it’s massive,” and I was like, “yeah, huge, and it’s really fancy,” and I said, “but you know what, I’m so happy to be walking past that hotel pointing it out to you but walking down the street with you.” Not staying in that hotel, but looking at it and going, “I did that once. I’m so happy that I’m here with you now and not there.” Not because I didn’t enjoy it, because the success wasn’t lovely and all of that and given me the chance to have a nice home to bring my kids up in, not fancy, fancy, but good enough — it’s all good. And I’m just like, did I handle it well? Probably not. Was I gracious? Not always. I came out of nowhere in a very particular time of my life when … It’s a lot, maybe more than people realize.\n\nBeth Orton\n\nTrailer Park (1996) signed by Beth\n\nFor over thirty years, Beth Orton has been creating beautiful music and delighting audiences with her exquisite songcraft. She defies categorization. A singer-songwriter who adds elements of folk, electronica and beats, Beth has collaborated with mix masters the Chemical Brothers, Four Tet, William Orbit and Andrew Weatherall on many of her recordings. For her efforts, critics labeled her music 'folktronica,\" which sounds as nonsensical as it seems. Rather than all the categories which critics revel in, I prefer Duke Ellington's description: \"There are simply two kinds of music, good music, and the other kind.\" Beth has been nominated twice for the prestigious Mercury Prize, an annual award (since 1992) for the best album released by a musical act from Ireland or the United Kingdom. Though she lost in 1997 to Roni Size & Reprazent (whoever that is!) and to Talvin Singh in 1999, she is in good company with Adele (0 for 2), David Bowie (0 for 3), Radiohead (0 for 6), Paul Weller (0 for 2), and Amy Winehouse (0 for 2). Apparently, the Mercury Prize has a track record as unenviable as the Grammys!\n\nBorn in Dereham, Norfolk, Beth moved to Dalston, East London when she was fourteen. Her father, a journalist and public relations consultant, left the family three years earlier and died shortly thereafter. It was a hardscrabble life for Beth, her two brothers and her mother as Beth ruefully recalled, \"Vodka and white bread seemed to be what we lived off.\" Beth was also afflicted when she was seventeen with Crohn's Disease, a debilitating inflammatory bowel ailment. To lessen the pain, Beth sought non prescriptive cures, \"I was out drinking on it, drugging, living the life, The highs were very high and the lows were very low.\" Unfortunately, Beth's mother passed away from cancer when she was only nineteen and now she was on her own.\n\nInitially, Beth wanted to be an actress, and she enrolled in the Anna Scher Theatre School in Islington, outside of London. Founded in 1968, this school was one of the first to welcome working class students. As a result of the poor reading skills by some of the pupils, improvisation was encouraged and deemed essential. The Royal Shakespeare Company, this, clearly, was not. Thus, Beth embarked on a tour of the UK, Russia, and Ukraine in Une Saison en Enfer (A Season in Hell), a poem turned play written by Arthur Rimbaud, with subject matter as cheery as its title implies. Regrettably, it was probably an accurate representation of Beth's life at the time. It was at a different music theatre production that producer and beat master William Orbit (later to collaborate and have outsize success with Madonna, Britney Spears, and Pink among others) saw her and enlisted her to work on the third installment of his Strange Cargo series, which featured \"Water From A Vine Leaf,\" a song co-written by Beth and Orbit. This led to Beth's first album, Superpinkymandy, named after a ragdoll Beth owned as a child, produced by Orbit and released in 1993 in Japan to little or no fanfare. Despite an imaginative interpretation and reinvention of English folk singer John Martyn's \"Don't Wanna Know About Evil,\" and her composition \"She Cries Your Name\" which later appeared on Trailer Park as a single in 1996, the album didn't sell very well. A limited pressing of only five-thousand copies didn't help.\n\nSugaring Season (2012) signed by Beth\n\nHer relationship with Orbit wasn't just professional and it was hardly a cheery Hallmark Card, as she disclosed, “He wanted me to be all like part of his world and we started going out together and he wanted me to sing. I was like ‘F*ck off, I’m not going to be some bloke’s bird who sings but can’t even sing, but because they’re going out together he gets her to sing on his record.' I was really indignant about it. I remember I was really drunk and on ecstasy – I used to make him do loads of ecstasy, he never went out or did anything – and then all of a sudden I was popping pills in his gob and we were lying under a mixing desk being all mental. And I sang ‘Cry Me A River’ as a joke, and ‘Catch A Falling Star’ by Francoise Hardy. And then he made a little demo of it.”\n\nDespite this inauspicious and unsettling beginning, four years later, Beth had her critical and commercial breakthrough with the release of Trailer Park, a proper release through proper channels. Her first single was a cover of The Ronettes' \"I Wish I Never Saw The Sunshine\" which bore little resemblance to the swirling Phil Spector power pop originally recorded in 1965, and Beth's career was off and running. Initially, Beth wanted to name the album \"Winnebago\" but licensing from the manufacturer of mobile homes proved impossible. Beth remembered the vibe, \"Trailer Park conjures up the same kind of filmic American images, images of transience and dislocation... and funnily enough, when we shot the video for the first single (in an actual trailer park)... I had all these odd, rather desperate people coming up and giving me their entire life-stories in a second, even though I didn't want them to.\" Not everybody is a star, I reckon...\n\nKidsticks (2016) signed by Beth\n\nThe disappointment of the elusive Mercury Prize notwithstanding, Beth has had a phenomenal career, releasing eight albums while collaborating with an eclectic list of artists, Ryan Adams, Dr. John, Emmylou Harris and Terry Callier, a singular soul singer and writer of renown. It seems as though her cadence is to release an album, well crafted and lovingly written, every four or five years, and it is always worth the wait. Her latest album Weather Alive is no exception, and it is exceptional. The rigors of Covid wrought its own challenges. Beth was set to work with a (as yet unnamed) \"super-fancy\" producer before he bolted, \"Anyway, lockdown happened, he disappeared, the whole thing went to sh*t.\" The record label wasn't happy either with the dour and dark songs that Beth was creating and dropped her.\n\nUndaunted, Beth took out a loan in 2022 and self-produced Weather Alive, the first time she had ever done so. The songs were born in a studio shed on her property where she went to escape during the pandemic, \"This old piano really spoke to me and held an emotional resonance I could explore in a way I wasn't able to on guitar, a depth, or a voice I'd never worked to before. For me, the mood and atmosphere were another instrument. They were always consistent... In a way, when I was making the record, there was something about those last few months when I was just on my own in the shed, and I was working remotely with people, and I was taking the beautiful music that had been kind of played around the songs and started to sculpt it and create a new sonic world for these songs. It was kind of an indulgence for me, I really loved it. I loved the experience of getting to transport myself and the music is transporting anyway. There was some gorgeous, gorgeous stuff to work with. It's lovely to think of making a record that people can lose themselves in, because it's not always the most jolly record. It's not dark, but it's deep.\"\n\nLivin’ It Up (1968) signed by Tom, Jimmy Smith\n\nArranger, composer, conductor, and saxophonist, Tom Scott is one of the most prolific musicians whom you have heard but possibly don't know. His saxophone credits include Blondie's \"Rapture,\" Carole King's \"Jazzman,\" Whitney Houston's \"Saving All My Love For You,\" Paul McCartney and Wings \"Listen To What The Man Said,\" Joni Mitchell's \"Free Man In Paris,\" and Rod Stewart's \"Do You Think I'm Sexy,\" among countless others. Oh yeah, he also wrote the horn arrangements and played on Steely Dan's Aja, and he even found the time to play the lyricon, an obscure electronic wind instrument, on Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean.\" Tom also composed film and television scores and was a member of The Blues Brothers band, appearing on their first album, Briefcase Full Of Blues, although a salary squabble resulted in his absence in the film. I guess he wasn't nicknamed Tom \"Triple Scale\" Scott on the liner credits for nothing! A three time Grammy winner (with thirteen nominations), Tom has released more than thirty albums as a leader and appeared on hundreds of sessions in an amazing and varied career, and he's not done yet.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, Tom was surrounded by music. His father, Nathan Scott, was an accomplished film and television composer as well as a pianist and trombonist, as Tom remembered, \"Dad spent many years composing and conducting music for films and television. Beginning in 1952, he arranged and orchestrated for “Dragnet” theme composer Walter Schumann, later taking over as composer on that Jack Webb series. He later joined the roster at CBS-TV composers along with Lalo Schifrin and others, scoring episodes of “Laramie” “Wagon Train,” “Have Gun-Will Travel”, “Rawhide,” “The Untouchables,” “My Three Sons” and other television series of the 50’s and 60’s. He scored two “Twilight Zones,” including the classic 1960 episode “A Stop at Willoughby”. He began working on “Lassie” in 1963 and scored all of its episodes until the show ended in 1973... Clearly, I was born into a very musical household. My Dad never pushed me, but once I started playing clarinet at age eight, I was hooked!\" Clearly, the apple didn't fall far from the tree.\n\nSpirit Feel (1967) signed by Tom, Roger Kellaway\n\nAfter the show, I visited with Tom, and he was warm and gracious as he signed his vinyl. I lamented that he rarely toured back east, \"You know, I've been back east more than you know, but you just haven't seen me. I have been doing a lot of work with the Steinhardt School (part of New York University) working on their archives and doing some interviews.\" He smiled when he saw the Don Ellis album, \"Wow, this is where it all started, I was just a kid, what a band that was and Don was such a great player.\" When I handed him Roger Kellaway's Spirit Feel, he smiled, \"My first feature on an album,\" he said, pointing to the cover credit, \"You know, Roger's great and he's still going strong, And Bobby Darin? What a talent he was, it was such a loss to lose him so young.\" Of his debut release in 1967, The Honeysuckle Breeze, when he was only nineteen, Tom said, \"This was with the Wrecking Crew,\" a famed group of first call musicians who helped create Phil Spector's Wall Of Sound and played on countless hits with The Beach Boys, Ike and Tina Turner, Frank Sinatra et al, \"This was before Glen Campbell became Glen Campbell,\" he laughed as he scanned the album credits which had Glen on guitar, and included Carol Kaye on bass and Hal Blaine on drums who reportedly played on more than one hundred-forty Top Ten hits. Yes, this is not among them, although it was released on Impulse, the jazz label preferred by John Coltrane. The Honeysuckle Breeze features slight covers of The Beatles, Donovan and Jefferson Airplane, and has a version of Coltrane's \"Naima,\" although clocking in under three minutes, it is as slight as it is forgettable. At least the artwork holds up as a testament to 1960's zeitgeist!\n\nChoice Tom Scott Cuts (per BKs request)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEx53W-qcYw\n\n“Gotcha (Starsky & Hutch Theme)\" Blow It Out 1977\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jz_vytdLK8\n\n\"Appolonia (Foxtrata)\" New York Connection with George Harrison 1975\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyHU7WAIrII\n\n\"Naima\" The Honeysuckle Breeze 1967\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrSFuAIw_i4&list=PL7x90QIm3bJp4Qil7BymAsB4ScP-V45lS&index=1\n\n\"Rock Island Rocket\" Tom Cat 1974\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcsoeVoPaIA\n\n“Pick Up The Pieces\" Them Changes 1990\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiHs-MVGWc&list=PLrVwrW4BjwaK1oJmZn53iBYTUVsZ5nkGB&index=2\n\n\"Gotta Give It Up\" Bluestreak 1996\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBdXxST1d2s&t=51s\n\n\"Burn That Bridge\" SRT live at Birdland July 2023\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzrDs_Vaho4\n\n\"Black Cow\" Aja with Steely Dan 1977\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PicdXFEj8fE\n\n\"Them Changes\" Them Changes 1990\n\nBonus Picks:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHCdS7O248g\n\n\"Rapture\" Blondie 1981\n\n\"Blondie’s producer, Michael Chapman, called me one day and requested a session that night, it was for “Rapture.\" He played the song for me and then asked me to 'fill in these holes.'

Very classy!\"\n\nTom Scott\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTWH1Fdkjow\n\n\"Soul Man\" Blues Brothers live on SNL 1978\n\n\"I wasn’t exactly a founding member – more accurately an 'added' member. The first official Blues Brothers gig was as opening act for Steve Martin at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles for a week. I was not a member at the time, but I got a call from Tom Malone. Tom asked me if I could substitute for him in the horn section of the Blues Brothers band until his wife delivered their baby in New York. I said sure, so I filled in for “Bones” Malone until Thursday of that week. However, I had apparently impressed John Belushi – instead of thanking me and sending me on my way, “Uncle Johnny” asked me to join the band as a regular! “We’ll just have four horns instead of three!” He could be a really great guy – not to mention funny!\"\n\nTom Scott\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W8KGSD-aNE\n\n\"Judgment Of The Moon and Stars (Ludwig's Tune)\" For The Roses with Joni Mitchell 1972\n\n\"I had done that one record with her, and she said 'Listen, will your band record on my next album?' She had never, up until that point, recorded with a band. She would overdub a bass player, then send him home, overdub a horn player, then send him home...I can only speculate as to her motives, but I guess she just wanted to move into another area. When you consider where she went on to — some very esoteric jazz exploration — I guess I was kind of the beginning of that. It turned into a real good thing for us, in terms of getting the exposure of being her backup band.\"\n\nWilson Savoy, the co-founder, accordionist, fiddler, pianist and principal singer, descends from Cajun royalty. His mother, Ann Savoy, is a noted singer and guitarist, his father, Marc Savoy, is a virtuoso accordion player and the greatest craftsman of Cajun button accordions, and his brother, Joel, leads the Red Stick Ramblers and owns a record label, Valcour Records. Underachievers all, Marc recalled their beginnings, \"When the kids were coming up, we had a bunch of instruments in a ring around the house: fiddles, accordions, guitars. The first time Joel and Wilson expressed an interest, I said, 'You can play my fiddle, but don't ever ask me to show you anything, because I won't.' And I did that for one simple reason. When I was a kid, I had such desire, such a passion for this music and these people that played it. I would have figured out how to play if someone put me in a straightjacket, and I wanted the kids to have the same passion for it, because you'll never amount to a hill of beans if you don't.\" Thankfully, the kids found the same passion for music and live performances as their parents.\n\nThroughout the years, The Pine Leaf Boys have exposed their rocking Cajun music to forty-seven states and more than twenty countries on U.S. State Department sponsored tours, including Dubai where they played two segregated shows, one for nine-hundred men, and a different show for nine-hundred women. Wilson remembered the trip fondly, \"If I would have been in The Beatles, that must have been what it felt like. It was nine-hundred beautiful women and you can only see their eyes because of the robes they wear. It got so wild. They were going insane.\" That’s the mystery and magic of music: it cuts through to your soul, whether you live in Dubai, Croatia, Slovenia or Ridgefield, Connecticut, all tour stops on the Pine Leaf Boys peripatetic itinerary.\n\nAfter the show, I had a visit with Wilson as he was hanging out near the merch stand. Sadly, there was no Pine Leaf Boys vinyl for sale. I asked him about the origin of the band's name, He laughed, “Yeah, I was driving to the dump to get rid of some stuff and we'd been working in the studio on our first recording, and I thought of the name. Little did I know, it would last all these years later.” I mentioned how impressive their performance was at Hardly Strictly Bluegrass all those years ago. \"Wow, I'm glad you were there and enjoyed it. We had a great time. We were the first and, I think, only Cajun band ever invited. I'd love to be invited back.\" What about new music? \"We're in the studio next month and we'll be working on our next album. It's high time, it's been too long,\" he admitted, acknowledging the lengthy time since their last release in 2013. I handed him a couple of CDs to sign, “Oh man, you have all our early recordings. I think most of these are out of print.\" I said that I especially loved their debut album La Musique, \"Thanks, it was really special. You know they still play that CD in the airport in New Orleans. I live in Lafayette, so we drive about two hours to fly out of New Orleans. It was playing in the airport when we left, and that was just a couple of days ago!\" It was released on Arhoolie Records, a really cool label, what was that experience like? \"My Uncle Chris (Strachwitz, founder of Arhoolie), well I call him my uncle, I've known him all my life, he's a part of our family. It was great recording with them. Lately, I've been working on my brother's label, Valcour, so we're keeping it in the family.\" I told Wilson that I had an old Arhoolie t-shirt that I bought years ago when I saw them at HSB that now was all tattered and torn. \"Yes, I know the shirt, that's a great shirt. I had an old Arhoolie truckers hat, I think that's gone too.\" As engaging as Wilson was on stage, he was equally affable off. I thanked him again for his time and his great music.\n\nBird (1988) signed by Jon, Charles McPherson\n\nLike so many musicians, Jon was blessed with the good fortune of having skilled teachers and he flourished under their tutelage, \"My second trumpet teacher, Bill Catalano, was a former trumpet player with Stan Kenton and still played in a lot of clubs in the Bay area. He was a very big influence on me. I started with him when I was ten and stayed with him until I was sixteen. My first teacher was a straight classical player, while Bill had a jazz background, and I liked that a lot. Bill was the one who introduced me to Dizzy Gillespie's music, and that was it for me. I started getting into Dizzy, and when I was fifteen got the chance to play with him. That did it, I wanted to be a jazz musician.\"\n\nBlame it all on Dizzy Gillespie, who became an early, colossal and sustaining influence, as Jon remembered their less than auspicious first encounter, “I met him when I was twelve, but I was too shy to say anything. It was in a club, the Basin Street West in San Francisco. My father said, ‘Hey Diz, my boy’s a trumpet player. He really digs you.’ I was frozen, I couldn’t speak a word. So I told myself the next time I have the opportunity to meet Dizzy, I was going to talk to him.\" Redemption happened three years later when Jon met Dizzy at the Monterey Jazz Festival when he was fifteen, \" I took all of my records down there hoping to meet him and have a chance to get his autograph, and that's exactly what happened. I was in heaven! He signed all of my records — which at that time was about fifty.\" Finally, a record collector cut from my same cloth!\n\nIt was the gigs. When you signed a contract, you only got about 1½ percent. The royalties were not a big deal anyway. They’ve become a big deal during the last, maybe, twenty-five years, when artists have become involved in writing, producing, owning part of this and owning all of that. Back then you knew, if the record was big, you were going to work all the time. That was what you looked forward to, and it wasn’t television then. Especially for black artists, you had to do a lot to get an album and to go on TV, it wasn’t a given. I never went on television until \"Let Me Down Easy.\" When I was on Shindig (in 1965), I was just standing there very still. I was very frightened, I didn’t even move my head.\n\nBettye LaVette\n\nI was ashamed to sing it, because it sounded so old. I wanted to sound like Little Eva and the Shirelles, but this was all I was offered, so I had to do it, but I was very embarrassed, and I never got the opportunity to do the kind of shows they were doing. I was always at a nightclub because of the nature of the song. I was always with older performers. I had been singing for fifteen years, before I met the Shirelles and Chubby Checker... My mother was thrilled. No one in the family had ever done anything. No one had actually held a hundred-dollar bill, no one had ever travelled. They thought that we had been saved. They were very thrilled.\n\nBettye LaVette, sixteen years old singing \"My Man, He's A Loving Man\"\n\nThings Have Changed (2018) signed by Bettye\n\nDee Dee Ford was very ill at the time, mentally, and was slowly having a nervous breakdown. She was very sad about this trumpet player, who was her man, and she started to write \"Let Me Down Easy,\" so I helped her write the song. When they asked to write down the credits who wrote it, I just said ‘give my part to her.' I didn’t know you get money from these things for years and years and years. I think I wrote maybe three or four lines, but gosh! – today three or four lines... So as a result she winds up being the only writer on it.\n\nBettye LaVette\n\nI wrote our most famous song, ‘Nights in White Satin’ when I was nineteen. It was a series of random thoughts and was quite autobiographical. It was a very emotional time as I was at the end of one big love affair and the start of another. A lot of that came out in the song. She (Bettye LaVette) covered ‘Nights,’ and somebody sent it to me as an MP3, a link. I was sitting in bed with my laptop, waking up to my emails, and I clicked on this link, and I burst into tears. My wife came in, and she said, ‘What the hell’s the matter with you?’ And I said, ‘You’ve got to listen to this.’ She didn’t cry, but I heard the lyric for the first time. There have been hundreds, maybe thousands of covers of ‘Nights in White Satin,’ but that was the first time I heard it for real.\n\nJustin Heyward, Moody Blues singer-songwriter and ardent Bettye Lavette fan\n\nLet Me Down Easy: In Memphis (1960s recordings, 2022 release) signed by Bettye\n\nBettye LaVette is not only a soul singer sensation, she is a survivor with a career lasting more than sixty years. Judging by her recent appearance at the Iridium on December 13, 2023, she has no intention of slowing down. She was in great voice and her lithe figure dismissed any notion of a senior citizen hobbling or slouching toward retirement. She was seventy-seven years young and electric, prowling the stage, fertile and fecund, enthralling the audience. She was showcasing her new album, LaVette!, a collection of songs written by Randall Bramblett, which is up for a Grammy, her seventh nomination. As Bettye quipped during the show, \"I hope I win, I don't wanna be the Susan Lucci of the Grammys!\" Bettye defies categorization like few singers: elements of blues, country, gospel, rock and soul inhabit her gruff and expressive vocals. In many ways, she is the best kept soul secret hiding in plain sight.\n\nBorn Betty Jo Haskins in Muskegon, Michigan (near a harbor of Lake Michigan), Bettye was raised in Detroit, \"When I was two, we left there for Detroit. My early life was spent in an atmosphere where there was always music playing, but I’m one of the few singers that did not come out of the church.” Her parents had moved from Louisiana as part of the Great Migration decades earlier in search of better opportunities, \"My family was in the corn liquor business, and I’m the only person in the family who was involved in music.\" Unfortunately, Bettye's father died when she was twelve, a casualty of having too much free and unfettered access to said corn liquor. Not the first nor the last time that John Barleycorn won. He always wins.\n\nThere was lots of music around the Haskins house, as Bettye recalled, ”You could call my mother ‘a gospel groupie.' Because gospel singers drank so much, they stayed at my house quite a bit, to be there to drink, so I had the opportunity as a small kid to know and see the Five Blind Boys, Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers and others. Everybody was always happy. It was a very happy atmosphere. It was fun. Even then I would dance and sing for them, so I’ve always known old songs. When most children didn’t even talk, I knew entire songs. I really didn’t grow up with gospel, because I didn’t go to church to see those gospel people. I saw them at my house.” She was also friendly with Aretha Franklin and her father the Reverend C.L. Franklin, sharing a deep Detroit gospel and soul bond.\n\nInitially, Bettye was influenced by the phrasing and voices of Bobby Bland and Sam Cooke \"and musicals... All I knew about singing was this big stage, the dancing and Fred Astaire, which is one reason why I hated my voice for so long, because it didn’t sound like Ginger Rogers. But I liked all of the musicals, anyone who sang in a movie. I always knew I could sing, and I’ve always sung, but I didn’t know I could do it as a profession until maybe a month before \"My Man - He's A Loving Man\" came out (in 1962 when she was sixteen).\"\n\nBlackbirds (2020) signed by Bettye\n\nBettye's name change happened around this time. She was good friends with Sherma \"Ginger\" Lavett Anderson who was active on the booming music scene, as Bettye explained, ”She was a local groupie. She knew all the entertainers, and I wanted to know them, so she introduced me to Timmy Shaw and to all of them. Although I was no one at the time, I met people like the Temptations, who were the Distants then. I began to hang around with Ginger, and they just kinda blocked me out of it and said ‘you don’t have to be a groupie, you can join us’. Timmy Shaw took me to meet Johnnie Mae Matthews. They liked me, but I knew I didn’t sound like Bobby Bland. I knew I didn’t sound like Etta James. It was a long time before I accepted my voice. I guess about the time I went to Muscle Shoals in the early 70s, I began to realise the power of my voice and that it was okay I didn’t sound like all the girls. It was okay, I sounded like James Brown.”\n\nIn the ensuing decades, Bettye's career was marked by near hits and many misses. Her first single recorded in 1962 \"My Man, He's A Loving Man\" was a Top Ten R&B hit for the Northern Recording Company, a label owned by Johnnie Mae Matthews, a singer, songwriter and producer who was also the first black female to own a record company in the rough hewn Detroit music scene, a formidable task. Bettye remembered her toughness, \"She was ‘a truck driver’ – really rough, really mean, just a really hard woman. At that time, I guess, she was maybe around thirty-five, but that was old to me, because I was only sixteen. She was a hustling kind of a woman, very manlike. She was not respected, but everybody (she) knew she had crossed somewhat. She was the only one, who had a connection to outside of Detroit, but there was no one at her funeral...The thing with \"My Man\" actually happened in a few weeks’ time. One week I was a groupie, the next week I was already there.”\n\nThe road beckoned with incessant touring and Bettye ended up in New York recording her next big hit, \"Let Me Down Easy.\" Bettye remembered the unusual circumstances, ”Fortunately, in New York I was surrounded by people, who wanted to help me. Nate McCalla, who owned Calla Records, actually worked for the mafia, I found out later that they gave him Calla Records. He and I just became really good friends, but he knew nothing about the record business. He was asking me, should we do this? Should we do that? When we did \"Let Me Down Easy,\" they asked me what I wanted. The only arranger that I had heard of was Dale Warren, and they flew him (in) from Detroit. I asked for violins, because I’d never had any violins. I probably should have just asked for straight money, but Nate just adored me, and I didn’t know they were gangsters.”\n\nTell Me A Lie (1982) signed by Bettye\n\nHer next big break (and bust) came when she signed with Atco in 1972, a division of the storied Atlantic Records, the home of Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and Otis Redding. They released one single recorded in Detroit, a jaunty, swinging cover of Neil Young's \"Heart Of Gold.\" You might think a dour Neil Young song might not be the best subject matter for a soul singer, and you would probably be right. Brad Shapiro, a gifted producer of Wilson Pickett and James Brown renown, suggested that they go to Muscle Shoals, Alabama and record an entire album with the fearsome rhythm section of Jimmy Johnson, Barry Beckett, David Hood and Roger Hawkins, known affectionately as The Swampers, so respected and revered that they were even name checked in Lynyrd Skynyrd's opus \"Sweet Home Alabama\" in 1974:\n\n\"Now, Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers\n\nAnd they've been known to pick a song or two\n\nLord, they get me off so much\n\nThey pick me up when I'm feeling blue\n\nNow, how 'bout you?\"\n\nBettye recalled the joy of working with them, ”It was very, very easy working with them. They were the most laid-back guys. We’d sit around for a while, smoke joints and then they’d say ‘Well, let’s record one, how you wanna sing it, baby?' I’d start singing and they’d follow one at a time and everybody would get their part. Then they would go out alone, work out their part, come back and then we would do the head arrangement.”\n\nThe studio at 3614 Jackson Highway (the title of a Cher album which she recorded there in 1969!) was not sumptuously appointed, as Bettye divulged, ”The roof was thin, and everytime it rained we couldn’t record. We rehearsed those days. It was just the most ragged little place. We would sit on the floor, but it was very laid-back. They didn’t charge you by the hour, and sometimes you were in for twelve-fifteen hours.\" The album was set for release, then it was shelved for reasons that were never revealed, though Bettye had her opinion, ”My biggest disappointment is that album that didn’t come out. That was supposed to be my first album, and I thought I had all the components – Atlantic, Brad Shapiro, the Muscle Shoals Sound, the songs – and when they decided not to release it, which I know now was because of Ahmet Ertegun, I was devastated.\" It's incomprehensible that Ahmet Ertegun, co-founder of Atlantic Records and purveyor of exquisite taste, would have made such a terrible error in judgment but Child Of The Seventies languished in storage until the tapes were retrieved and subsequently released in 2006, nearly thirty-five years after they were originally recorded.\n\nBettye walking the floor! The Iridium, NYC 12.13.2023\n\nAfter the show. I asked her husband and tour manager Kevin Kiley if she wouldn't mind signing a couple records. He saw the stack of seven or eight, \"Yeah, she's not gonna sign all those, pick two.\" 'Yeah, that's gonna be tough,' I said, flipping through the albums, 'They're all great, how can I pick just two?' \"Yeah, ok, I hear you, gimme three and I'll be back,\" Kevin grabbed three and he headed behind the curtain to secure the signatures. After a few minutes, Kevin reappeared and opened the curtain and said, \"Listen, it's mellow back here tonight, why don't you come back and get the rest of them signed.\" He didn't have to ask twice. Bettye was seated, a well deserved rest after a gripping and energetic ninety minute show. I thanked her for her music and wished her well in her elusive Grammy pursuit. She was happy to sign her records, and when she saw The Scene Of The Crime, she said, \"You know, there aren't many of these, this is a limited edition.\" She smiled when she saw the Elmore James tribute album, \"This was done for his hundredth birthday, that was a lot of fun,\" Her husband Kevin said, \"You know Marco produced that album,\" pointing to his drummer in the corner, \"You should have him sign it as well.\" Well, that was fortuitous, yes that sounds like a great idea. When I handed it to Marco, I said, 'I already had Rodney Crowell sign it.' \"Oh, he's a great songwriter and a really nice guy as well. That was a great session,\" Marco confided as he handed it back to me. 'You know,' I continued, 'the only problem I had with Rodney was after the show, he was wearing an Astros shirt. I hate the Astros, I'm an unrepentant Sawx fan.' Kevin said, \"You're right at home here, the whole band is with you!\" An unexpected delight, reveling in the company of fellow massholes, I thanked Bettye and, especially Kevin for their kindness and generosity.\n\nPirates (1981) signed by David, Rickie Lee Jones, Bob Weir\n\nBorn in St. Louis, David was stricken with polio as a child, and a local doctor proscribed playing the saxophone in order to build up his strength and lung capacity. Little did that doctor know how prescient and influential his advice would become. David recalled years later, \"I wasn't like the other kids, my mantra was, 'Hey guys, wait up.' I used to lie in bed a lot, listening to the radio which was my theater of the imagination. To hear those songs coming through the air from Memphis and New Orleans seemed so magical.\" One of those songs really struck David: \"Honky Tonk\" by Bill Doggett featuring Clifford Scott on a searing tenor sax. He remembered, \"My parents had records by Billie Holiday, Glenn Miller, Louis Armstrong, and Benny Goodman, and I liked those, but the rock 'n' roll I heard on the radio was the shit. My parent's records were working on the top end, but my songs were all about the bottom. All these dirty sounding records sounded like they were homemade, which they were. I guess they were folk music really, but when I heard \"Honky Tonk\", it hit me...\"\n\nEqually important was David's first concert with Ray Charles and his band. After attending a St. Louis Hawks NBA game in 1956 with his father, the Ray Charles band took center stage and played thirty minutes sans Ray. David was transfixed, especially with the one-two punch of David \"Fathead\" Newman on tenor saxophone and Hank Crawford on alto saxophone. “I’d been hearing so much saxophone on the radio that I couldn’t get enough of it. To me, Fathead was as big a star as Ray. He had that same earthy sound, that same punch-in-the-gut feel as my favorite rock ‘n’ roll songs, but I could tell something else was going on too. Some kind of sophisticated inner harmony was happening that reminded me of Benny Goodman or Count Basie. It was as if he were combining my records and my parents’.”\n\nThe Gil Evans Orchestra Plays The Music of Jimi Hendrix (1975) signed by David, Billy Harper\n\nThe next chapter was David's prolific and lucrative work as a sideman. At one point, he was simultaneously playing with both jazz conductor Gil Evans and pop avatar David Bowie. Sanborn explained, \"Once I finished a tour with Bowie at Madison Square Garden and caught a midnight flight to Rome the same night. I got a ride to Perugia and that night I went on with Gil (Evans) right after (Charles) Mingus. I dug that I was able to do both gigs one after the other. It wasn't as much of an adjustment as you'd think. I played the same, only the context had changed. My job is to respond appropriately to the context, and when the context has more harmonies happening, you respond to that.\"\n\nAfter touring extensively with David Bowie (well documented on the 1974 release David Live), David joined Bowie at the Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia to record the Neo Soul classic Young Americans, or as Bowie described it derisively at the time, \"Plastic soul. It is the squashed remains of ethnic music as it survives in the age of Muzak rock, written and sung by a white limey.\" Bowie's original plan was to record with MFSB, essentially the house band for Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff's Philadelphia International Records, a label that was crushing the airwaves with the fresh grooves of Harold Melvin, The O'Jays, The Spinners, The Stylistics, and especially the Three Degrees' \"TSOP (The Sound Of Philadelphia)\", the theme song for Don Cornelius' television show Soul Train (where Bowie would perform in 1976.) Thankfully, the infectious grooves of \"TSOP\" endure as the song is played before every Phillies' home game at Citizens Park. TSOP indeed!\n\nMFSB (the clean name was Mother, Father, Sister, Brother, the real name was Mutha F..... Son of a Bitch, a term of endearment for each musician's skill and precision), was unavailable for the session, so Bowie assembled a crack team of musicians, chief among them David Sanborn and (a not yet superstar arranging all vocals) Luther Vandross. Sanborn remembered the session very fondly, \"I think David and I bonded because he was a saxophone player too. The way he presented it to me at the outset of the session was, 'There's not going to be any lead guitar on this record. There's going to be rhythm guitar and bass and drums and piano. You're going to be the lead guitar.' I didn't really know how that was going to work, but I put myself in that mindset... I really didn't have any parts, but I had been on the road with him, so we had a kind of dialogue. That was one of the great, great things about working with him. He was so responsive to input. The brilliance of Bowie was that he gave us the framework and then it was the unseen, unfelt hand of guidance from him. he was very clearly in charge, but was not 'in charge'....\" It is an extraordinary recording by extraordinary musicians.\n\nJesse Chandler at the controls, September 7, 2023\n\nThe origin of the band name Pneumatic Tubes sadly doesn't derive from the John Wick franchise which used the archaic messaging system to great cinematic effect, transmitting contract details within the treacherous confines of The Continental. Rather, as Jesse disclosed, it comes from another cinematic reference, no less weighty than the oeuvre of Jonathan Wick, \"I was watching a Truffaut film, Stolen Kisses, and there’s a scene where one of the characters sends a love letter using a pneumatic tube system. They show it weaving through all the pipes, and I just love that. For a certain period of the 20th century, there was magic and wonder about the idea of sticking something in a tube in one part of the city, and a few minutes later it ending up in another. You could send a lock of hair…and there’s the fact that it uses woodwinds and electronics, too. The tubes are like clarinets and flutes, so that kind of resonates.”\n\nOpening for an artist is always a tricky and often thankless proposition. A short, abridged set hardly gives any momentum from the artist to an audience, and there are many headlining acts who are deathly afraid of being upstaged by an opening act. I have heard (and witnessed) acts being turned down at the soundboard, a subtle sabotage, so as not to be a competitive threat. Erin and I recently saw Rufus Wainwright at The Towne Crier in Beacon, New York and he related a story of his early career and how he opened for his father Loudon Wainwright III one night and completely bombed. As boos cascaded down on him, Rufus left the stage distraught and his father gave him a consoling hug and told him he would have better nights. A couple of nights later, Rufus again opened for his father, and this night, Rufus was electric and the crowd gave him deafening standing ovations. This time, Loudon was waiting for his son in the wings with a stern edict and admonition, \"You will never open for me again!\" And he never did, although Rufus assured us that his relationship with his father has been restored and is now usefully whole!\n\nSomewhere In The Stars (1982) signed by Rosanne\n\nInitially, Rosanne was attracted to books and literature. A turning point came when she went on tour with her father for nearly three years. Her education in country music sprang directly from its source: the music of Johnny Cash and June Carter, daughter of A.P. Carter, the patriarch of the renowned Carter Family. Hillbillies from rural, southern Virginia, A.P. Carter and his family basically invented country music in the 1920s, stealing Celtic airs and Scottish Highland reels, while grafting their simple, heartfelt lyrics, creating the aural and enduring masterpieces \"Will The Circle Be Unbroken\", \"Wildwood Flower\", \"I''m Thinking Tonight Of My Blue Eyes\", \"Wabash Cannonball\" and \"Keep On The Sunny Side\", among many others.\n\nRosanne remembered the circumstances of her recruitment, \"Once when I was in my late teens, I really fucked up. Me and my stepsister used his car and we were drunk and he found out about it. The next day, he was so quiet and the tension was building with every hour, and we were terrified that he was going to blow. Then, he finally took us out for an ice cream, and he said, 'I'm going to give you a choice. You can either go out on the road with me and sing and earn lots of money, or you can stay home and take drugs.\" I was crying and said, 'Yes, I'll go out on the road!' But my step-sister said, \"I'm going to have to think about it.\" In the end, we both went. My step-sister died six weeks after my dad (in 2003). She never really got off drugs.\"\n\nSeven Year Ache (1981) signed by Rosanne\n\nRosanne learned how to play guitar while on tour, and she treasured the time spent with her father, \"It was great to stock in some time with my dad because he had traveled so much through my childhood. So just being with him on the bus every day, and going to new places and traveling with him, that was wonderful. And I really satisfied some childhood yearning for him that I had. But it was great in another way in that I sat in the wings every night and watched him for three years. And I saw the essence of him, that's where the essence of him flourished, under the spotlight. So to see that every night was beautiful.\"\n\nWhen she returned home from touring, Rosanne studied acting briefly at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute in Los Angeles (one of her classmates was Kelly McGillis), but the acting life was not for her. The music came calling. She released her first album, Right Or Wrong, in 1979, produced by songwriter extraordinaire Rodney Crowell. They married, had three daughters and collaborated on several albums over the next thirteen years. A successful artistic partnership did not translate into matrimonial bliss. Of her time with Rodney, she reflected, \"We were too similar. While we ruminated dreamily on philosophy and music and metaphysics and art, neither of us knew where to find a post office, or how to change the oil in the car, or whether we even owned a key to the front door of the house.\" When their marriage ended, Rosanne decamped to Chelsea in New York City in 1992, and there, she has become (and remains) a devoted New Yorker in every sense.\n\nFortunately, for music lovers and her family, Rosanne hasn't succumbed to the Cash family demons. She has released thirteen albums since her recording debut in 1979, and she has charted eleven Number 1 country hits, won four Grammys, and sold millions of records. She has also written four books, including Composed: A Memoir published in 2010 which details her background and family life in illuminating and unsparing detail.\n\nComposed: A Memoir (2010) title page signed by Rosanne\n\nErin and I saw her again at the Ridgefield (Connecticut) Playhouse in 2009, when Rosanne was touring in support of The List, an album culled from one-hundred songs bequeathed to her by her father some thirty-five years earlier. Rosanne explained, \"When I was 18 years old, I went on the road with my dad after I graduated from high school. And we were riding on the tour bus one day, kind of rolling through the South, and...we started talking about songs, and he mentioned one, and I said I don't know that one. And he mentioned another. I said, 'I don't know that one either, Dad,' and he became very alarmed that I didn't know what he considered my own musical genealogy. So he spent the rest of the afternoon making a list for me, and at the end of the day, he said, 'This is your education.' And across the top of the page, he wrote '100 Essential Country Songs.' \" Thankfully, Rosanne kept the list and still has it to this day. As a significant historical document, I think the Magna Carta may be its only rival or equal!\n\nThe List has special guest vocalists Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Costello, Jeff Tweedy and Rufus Wainwright applying their star power to the classic country songs of Harlan Howard, Hank Snow, Merle Haggard, and even Bob Dylan's \"Girl From The North Country\" gets a plaintive re-working. In concert, these songs were majestic. Rosanne and her band opened with Hank Snow's \"I'm Movin' On\", an uptempo ode to rollin' and ramblin'. As John Leventhal said, \"It always goes over, it's fun, it's not all that serious, and you've got to build up to the wrist-slashers. You just can't hit 'em with it from the beginning.\" Beautifully stated from a man who knows how to put together a playlist!\n\n10 Song Demo (1996) signed by Rosanne\n\nIn concert, a highlight was a song that Rosanne said was not on The List but should have been - \"Ode To Billie Joe\", written by Bobbie Gentry. The band did a deep, delta swamp boogie intro with Leventhal bending notes on his Telecaster amid swirling atmospherics by a Hammond B3 organ, before Rosanne sang the mysterious tale of Billie Joe MacAllister jumping off the Tallahatchie Bridge in Choctaw Ridge, Mississippi. It was a riveting performance. There has always been ambiguity about what was thrown off the bridge which led to Billie Joe's demise. For her part, the reclusive songwriter Bobbie Gentry has remained evasive, \"It's entirely a matter of interpretation as from each individual's viewpoint. But I've hoped to get across the basic indifference, the casualness, of people in moments of tragedy. Something terrible has happened, but it's 'pass the black-eyed peas', or 'y'all remember to wipe your feet.' \"\n\nYears later, Rosanne solved the mystery with some unexpected help. \"I sang it live at Carnegie Hall at the Rainforest Foundation Benefit (in 2012) and President Clinton was in the audience. During the intermission, he summoned me so that he could talk about that song, and what was thrown off the bridge, and how that song was the quintessential expression of the shame of the South. It had been an abortion, a miscarriage, and they threw it off the bridge. It was stunning that he had put so much thought into this song and what it meant to Southern people. And it clarified my thoughts about it. It took the leader of the free world to explain the song to me, well, the ex-leader of the free world. I was thinking, 'This guy's mind is not full of other stuff? He's had time to think about this song?!\"\n\nThe River & The Thread (2014) signed by Rosanne i\n\nAs successful as Rosanne's performance was, the album sold better, although Rosanne became concerned that her fans seemed more interested in her interpretative covers rather than her original songs. She rectified that on her 2014 release, The River & The Thread, featuring all original compositions. Interestingly, the Tallahatchie Bridge and surrounding environs loom large. Rosanne recalled a visit, \"I thought it would be some overpowering structure, but it’s just this little bridge. We just sat there for half an hour, and then John (Leventhal) snapped a picture from behind me that became the album cover. But that area was like a vortex, and you can’t understand why so much came from this one spot. Down the road is Dockery Farms, which were the largest cotton plantations in Mississippi and all these great blues musicians worked there – Howlin’ Wolf, Charley Patton, Pop Staples. They’d sit on the porch of the juke joint at night and play music, and pick cotton all day.” To be sure, it is a ripe and fertile area. A mile away in Money, Mississippi, Emmett Till was slain in 1955 at Bryant's Grocery, a gruesome act that inspired and catalyzed the Civil Rights movement, and seminal blues man Robert Johnson is buried nearby. On vinyl, Rosanne mines these themes and influences adroitly with her compelling lyrics and melodies.\n\nRosanne Cash, an activist, author, sewer, singer, songwriter, and consummate storyteller.She once said, \"I didn't want to be a musician when I was a kid. I didn't like the fact that you had to travel, that it appeared you had to take drugs and your relationships were in shambles. Being a performing musician? Crazy.\"\n\nThank God she overcame her objections. The world is so much richer as a result of her many accomplishments.\n\nYes, May 24th is one of my favorite days.\n\nCan I tell you how I met Jimmy Smith? This is important for me. The owner of Royal Arms would always sneak me in because I wasn't supposed to be in at twelve years old. He knew I loved music, so he said, \"You get your butt over in that corner and you stay there and you can't move.\" And that corner happened to be on the side of the stage where everybody went up, so I had a bird's eye view of what was going on onstage. Jimmy was coming in and I called the owner and I said, \"Hey, where's Jimmy staying?\" He named some motel in Buffalo. I called Jimmy, and I still laugh about this, Jimmy picked up the phone. 'Hello,' I said, 'Yeah Jimmy, Mr. Smith, this is Ronnie Foster, I'm a little young organ player around here, you got to show me something.' And he said, \"Boy, when you hear me play, you won't want to play anymore.\" And so I said, 'No, no , no Mr. Smith, I really love to play.' And he said, \"Boy, you're not listening to me, when you hear me play, you're going to want to throw your organ away.\" I'm going, 'No, no, no.' But you know why he was doing that? Because he wanted to know how hungry I was, right? So he said, \"Okay, what time you get out of school?\" And I said, '3:00.' He said, \"You meet me over at the club,\" and the rest is history. When he was in town, I was with him every night and we got a great relationship moving forward as I got older until he passed. He was really amazing and it really pisses me off when people say, \"Oh Jimmy Smith is so overrated.\" How can he be overrated? He created the genre. He had his own voice and his own vocabulary on that instrument, which was his and his only. And there's a lot of organists that play bebop, they've taken that direction, But Jimmy was very, very special, very, very unique.\n\nRonnie Foster\n\nBlue Note has always stood for The Art of Jazz. I grew up on Blue Note, listening to all the greats, it was ingrained early. I was exposed to it through my own path and other people's paths - fans and players. I had some albums, my friends had other albums. When something new came out, we'd go to someone's house and we'd all check it out together. From Horace Silver and Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers to Donald Byrd and Herbie Hancock. Blue Note's roster was the cream of the crop - the center. And, of course, they brought Jimmy Smith on the scene. The stuff he was playing on The Sermon and Groovin' At Smalls' Paradise was crazy! Had me listening on headphones at the Buffalo Public Library!\n\nRonnie Foster\n\nTwo Headed Freap (1972) signed by Ronnie\n\nI first found out that musicians were sampling \"Mystic Brew\" when one of the forefathers of acid jazz in the UK called me to ask if he could remix it. He told me he loved my music and mentioned that A Tribe Called Quest had already done something with the song. I was unaware of Tribe's sample, so I went out and bought Midnight Marauders and listened to the song \"Electric Relaxation.\" I realized that the group had not asked for permission to sample. In those early days of hip hop, it was common for people not to ask for permission to sample, but I still felt violated by them not asking. I reached out to Blue Note, and they got it all handled. But it seems things have mostly changed since then in terms of respecting the source material. I've been trying to get a hold of J. Cole so I can thank him for his song \"Neighbors.\" The song uses \"Mystic Brew\" but the sample was actually of the song played backward. I would never have known about the sample if he hadn't credited me for it. It was beautiful that he credited me for my work.\n\nRonnie Foster\n\nI'll tell you a really great story. Jimmy Smith called me one day, he says, \"Ronnie, Michael and Quincy sent me over this tune, I need your help. You've got to tell me what to play.\" I said, 'What are you talking about?' The tune was \"Bad\" which a lot of people don't know that that's him on organ. That organ solo is his. And he sent me the track and I said, 'Jimmy, just play you.'\n\nRonnie Foster - The child is father to the man\n\nSweet Revival (1973) signed by Ronnie\n\nAn accomplished Hammond B3 organist, arranger and composer, Ronnie Foster has had a remarkable career. He released his first solo album fifty years ago on the acclaimed Blue Note record label, then dropped out of sight until his recent resigning and his heralded 2022 release, aptly named Reboot. Although his profile was low key in the ensuing years, Ronnie was productive, especially in the studio, performing with George Benson on Breezin' and Weekend In L.A., Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway on \"The Closer I Get To You,\" The Jacksons on \"Can You Feel It,\" Stevie Wonder on \"Summer Soft,\" and producing artists David Sanborn, Stanley Turrentine and Chayanne, a Latin American artist who has sold more than fifty million records. And his influence didn’t stop there, Ronnie's recordings have been sampled by noted hip hop artists A Tribe Called Quest, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar and so many others. It's been a long and winding journey from Ronnie's home town of Buffalo, New York where it all started.\n\nInitially, Ronnie played classical piano as a child, then switched to organ, transfixed by jazz music and the wide spell cast by the inimitable organ maestro Jimmy Smith. A gifted player, it was a tough slog to get gigs. Ronnie recalled his humble beginnings, \"My first professional gig was at fourteen, and this club was a supper club. The only reason I could work was because it was a supper club. So James Clark was a great guitarist out of Buffalo who worked with Grover Washington. You know, Grover came out of Buffalo...anyway they hired me for the gig and they said, 'So, now we'll practice the music for the exotic dancer.' So remember, I'm fourteen...we're running over \"Caravan\" and she starts taking off stuff, Well, I... all of a sudden, lose track of what I'm doing, and I just kind of hold the note down. The bandleader shouts at me, \"Ronnie, Ronnie,\" 'Oh okay, I got it.' And that was my first pro gig, that's how I started. And these guys, actually, the first night, they took me back in the kitchen and they pushed me up against a wall, and they said, \"We see you doing any stupid shit, we're going to kick your motherf...ing ass. So just play your instrument.\" So that was a good foundation, because I've only been drunk twice in my life. They treated me like a kid, you know, like their kids. That was a good foundation.\"\n\nCheshire Cat (1975) signed by Ronnie\n\nThat gig led to Ronnie getting signed and eventually recording for Blue Note, as Ronnie remembered, \"After the (Alive!) session was over, Francis Wolff - one of the co-founders of Blue Note - walked up to me and said, \"Hey Ronnie, how would you like to have a deal with Blue Note?\" And I go, 'Yeah.' Unfortunately, he passed away, and then Blue Note was kind of up in a gray area, because they were trying to find someone to run Blue Note. But then I found out who that was, which was Dr. George Butler, and I called him up and I said, 'Hey you know Francis offered me a deal, you know I'd like to do it.' And he said, \"Where are you playing?\" And I said, 'I'm playing at this club in Detroit.' He said, \"Oh, I'll fly out to check you out.\" He came out, and after the first set, he said, \"Yep, I'm signing you.\" You know, it was like that, a very beautiful situation. I was with George through that and then I did two other albums for him at Columbia.\"\n\nHis first two releases on Blue Note in 1972, Two Headed Freap and Sweet Revival, were soul jazz workouts featuring well worn covers of soul classics \"Let's Stay Together,\" \"Back Stabbers,\" \"Me And Mrs. Jones,\" and originals like \"Mystic Brew\" which became a deep reservoir for hip hop samples by A Tribe Called Quest, Childish Gambino, J. Cole, and Kendrick Lamar. In all, Ronnie released five albums on the storied Blue Note label, but when label head Dr. George Butler left to join Columbia Records, Ronnie departed as well, and he released two albums to little notice or fanfare in 1978 and 1979. In the 1970s, Jazz was in transition and struggling to be commercially viable and artistically relevant. Nonetheless, Ronnie released The Racer in 1986, and, mostly, focused on studio work and production in the ensuing decades. Thus, it was quite surprising that Blue Note resigned him and released a new album, a mere thirty-six years later. If it weren't true, it would be as unlikely as it is unbelievable.\n\nSilk Fuse One signed by Ronnie 1981\n\nAfter the show, I bounded up the stairs to get some records signed. I waited, and I waited. Finally, after twenty minutes - it seemed an eternity - I went back downstairs, and there was Ronnie, surrounded by friends and fans, a conga line of well wishers snaking through the club, waiting to exchange thanks and praises with the maestro. He took selfies, signed albums and CDs, seemingly reveling in the adulation which he so richly deserved. When it was my turn near the end, I told him how much I enjoyed the music and how great the band sounded. Ronnie was gracious and smiled as he signed the records, “ You know, you got some history here,” he said as he signed the Silk records, a supergroup of musicians including George Benson, Stanley Clarke, Stanley Turrentine, Lenny White, and a nineteen year old Wynton Marsalis. When he signed Wonderland, a Stanley Turrentine album of Stevie Wonder songs which he produced, “You know I love this album and I’ll tell you a story. I had all the arrangements done and we had booked time at the studio, but we hadn’t heard from Stanley for weeks. Nothing, there were no cell phones back then. Two days before, he called and said he’d be at the studio. So we went to the studio and Stanley showed up and played beautifully. Man, he had that stuff down. Later, we found out that he had been in rehab and had just gotten out. Man, he was beautiful and could he play!” I thanked Ronnie again for his time and music, and I couldn’t resist imploring him to come back to New York for a more extended visit to share his considerable talents.\n\nA wonderful arranger, composer, musician and producer, Ronnie Foster is deserving of far wider acclaim. Hopefully, that happens with his re-association with Blue Note. As he once said, “No matter what genre you’re playing, you play you. You pay respect to the circumstances that made your music, but music is music, and it’s beautiful.” And Ronnie is as beautiful as his music.\n\nFrank loved all kinds of music and he was up for anything. One of the first shows that we saw together was Doc Watson and Dave Grisman at Town Hall, a fabled New York City landmark. I bought tickets online and we were escorted to our seats, the last row in the center of the balcony. I had never been to Town Hall, and I was excited to be in such an historic and intimate venue. Frank smiled his big smile, a smile that lit up a room, so big his eyes squinted. \"You know, Neil, we have a ticket broker. We don't have to sit in the last row.\"\n\nDuly noted.\n\nA month later I made amends, thanks to Frank and his ticket broker, we sat in the second row for BB King at the Beacon Theater. We also saw shows at Madison Square Garden in the Sandler O’Neill box - Bob Dylan and Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen, and an Eric Clapton and Friends benefit for the Crossroads Recovery Center in Antigua on June 30, 1999. That was a great show which was augmented by some very special guests: Bob Dylan, Sheryl Crow, Mary J. Blige, and David Sanborn. My wife, Erin, joined us for this gig, as she and Frank shared a special connection. They were born on the same day in the same year, an extremely auspicious day and year! Frank always asked how the birthday girl was, especially when she called the desk, he was always so kind, generous and thoughtful.\n\nOne of Frank's favorite songs was a Dylan tune, \"Not Dark Yet\" off Time Out Of Mind. When a trade was going south, or the desk wasn't making money, Frank would quote Dylan: \"It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.\" There is always a fair amount of gallows humor around Wall Street, but Frank would leaven this quote with his effervescent smile. He was serious, but never took himself too seriously, rare and endearing qualities in a head trader, a boss, or anyone for that matter. When Dylan played the opening chords to \"Not Dark Yet\" and Clapton started riffing tasty fills, I think my smile was bigger than Frank's. It was a great concert, a great night with even greater company.\n\nI miss Frank Salvaterra and all the other Sandler O'Neill colleagues who perished so senselessly on 9.11.01. Although the years pass, the wound never fully heals. Each year on October 4, we add an extra candle to Erin's birthday cake in remembrance and celebration of a great friend.\n\nSending love and peace to their families\n\nHere’s the original Herman Sandler and Sting post…\n\nIn November 1999, Sting was playing four shows at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. One of my clients was a big Sting fan and asked if I could get tickets. Tickets were at a hefty premium since the venue was so small - only 3,000 seats vs. Sting's normal Madison Square Garden gig with 20,000+. I bought tickets through a ticket broker and asked Herman for backstage passes, since Herman was friends with Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler, and served with them on the board of The Rainforest Foundation. Herman said, \"No problem.\" Everything was no problem with Herman, even his boat was named \"No Problem.\" Herman secured the backstage passes the next day and handed them to me. No problem.\n\nThe night of the show, I met the client and her trading assistant for a quick dinner at the Ocean Grill on the Upper West Side. They were very excited to see Sting. We finished our meal and headed over to the Beacon. The backstage entrance was near the loading dock, so we flashed our passes and we were escorted in. A roadie told us that there was no real backstage area, so we could stand along the wall or go to our seats. I looked at the wall. That didn't look very promising and it was too early to go to our seats. 'Lets try this again,' I told the clients, 'Follow me.' We went back to where we came from and an elevator door opened. Another roadie got off. We got on. Taped to the elevator wall was handwriting: Sting 6, Costumes 5, Band 4, Catering 3. This was helpful. I pressed 6 and up we went.\n\nAt three years old, I was banging on my mother’s pots and pans. My great aunt bought me a practice pad when I was around maybe five, six or seven, and I was practicing all the time. My mother and father were into the swing era before bebop music — Benny Goodman, Gene Krupa — and that’s the first drummer I heard because my father had records. My mother said when I was born on January 18, 1943, “Sing, Sing, Sing” was playing, which was a big hit; Gene Krupa and the first drum solo was on that record, and it was playing when I was born. When I got older, my father bought me a set of drums; I was ten years old. I played them for six months and then stopped. My mother’s mother, my grandmother, told everybody that I told her, “I’m gonna practice when I’m ready.” Anyway, I heard “Cherokee” by Max Roach and Clifford Brown. I was twelve... I heard that record; it was modern jazz, and Max Roach, the great drummer, plays music on the drums. I didn’t know you could make music on the drums, so after that, when I came home from school, every day I’d set up my drums and put my ear to the speaker to try to figure out what he was doing, and that’s how it started. Then I got into Thelonious Monk and Miles, everybody. I’ve worked with those people. I never learned to read music, and can play a little piano, but I have to have somebody write the music and my songs out for me. I’ve been so blessed because I’ve played with everybody I fell in love with when I was a young teenager - Stan Getz, Sonny Rollins, Joe Henderson, Miles, Thelonious Monk, Cannonball Adderley…\n\nAl Foster\n\nWe Want Miles (1982) signed by Al, original Kix ticket stub, 1981\n\nI loved him so much. Another thing that people don’t know is that I raised four kids, four daughters, by myself, and I told Miles six months after I joined him, and he asked me to bring them in; maybe he didn’t believe me. I took them up there one Sunday a couple of weeks after I had told him, and a few months after that, he said that when we’re not working, for me to go up to management. This is the God's honest truth. When I wasn’t working, I went to pick up a check for $200 every week of the month. If I was off three months, four months, I got $800 a month, for real, and he never said that he was trying to help me with my daughters, but I felt that. So he wasn’t like his image, being mean, cursing at people, even punching people.\n\nAl Foster\n\nYou know, he was little, and he studied boxing...but he was the hippest trumpet player ever because I haven’t heard anybody with that kind of taste. Cool, you know. He would take his time. He knew I didn’t like playing the back beat. I was nervous for the first few years, but after I got to know him, I would say, ” Miles, why don’t we play some tunes with changes, you know, not just one damn chord. Miles would say, “Don’t worry about the changes, worry about the drums.” After that, I kept my mouth shut, you know, but he said everything so cool, never in anger. Even when he’s mad, he’s cool. I respect that because I can lose my temper. I grew up in Harlem and can act like a fool and regret it the next day, but he was always cool. One of a kind.\n\nAl Foster on Miles Davis\n\nThe Thing To Do (1964) signed by Al\n\nMy idols were Sonny Rollins - he was so melodic on the saxophone - and Max Roach, of course. The music is old now, you know, the forties, fifties, sixties, and then it changed in the seventies, and I joined Miles. He told me to buy Sly Stone, Jimi Hendrix, and Buddy Miles records. Buddy Miles was a drummer who was already famous. Miles used to say, “Buddy Miles has one beat, but Al, he plays the shit out of that beat!” So I had to learn that beat. Miles was too much, you know, but what a beautiful human being. He kept people away from him with his attitude, but he was the sweetest man, really and I miss him so much. I was with him for thirteen years, ’72 to ’85, and then I left and joined Herbie and Stan Getz. Miles called me in ’89 to play on a record... and then I played his last concert before he died, July 10th, 1991. He died September 28th. It was billed “Miles Davis and Friends,” and it was Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, and Joe Zawinul, three piano players; Wayne Shorter, Steve Grossman, Jackie McLean, sax players; John Scofield and John McLaughlin, two guitar players; and Dave Holland on bass and Darryl Jones on electric bass.\n\nAnd I was the only drummer. Tony Williams, Jack DeJohnette, and Jimmy Cobb were living, and they made great records with Miles, and he called me. That was the most money I ever made for one hour. Really big money. I didn’t know he was sick. I went to see him just before he died; flew out to LA. His nephew called me and said, “He’s sick, Al. Not like before.” My wife booked a flight for me, and I left the next morning and stayed a couple of days. I think he was in a coma. I’m not sure. He was tapping in my hand. I was holding his hand. When I walked in, the nurse said, “Oh, Miles. Your friend. He came all the way from New York to see you.” He had tubes in his mouth, so he couldn’t talk. Tears were coming down my face, and I said, “Miles, you have to get better. We have to play in New York next week.” I wasn’t even in his band. And that was it. He died a week later.\n\nAl Foster\n\nThe Magnificent Tommy Flanagan (1981) signed by Al, Tommy Flanagan\n\nHe laughed when he saw the Tommy Flanagan heavy lidded photo on The Magnificent and quickly turned to the back cover, \"George Mraz was on this, we played together quite a bit. He had such a great sound. it's a shame we just lost him,\" he said pointing wistfully to George's photo. The Jackie McLean/McCoy Tyner album elicited a similar emotional response. \"I don't know why, but I never liked this session and I love McCoy. The last time I saw him, man it was tough. I had heard that he was sick so I went to see him, but he didn't even know who I was. He just had a vacant stare. All the music and shows we played together, it was all gone. He was gone. That was tough.\" I handed him A New Kinda Soul recorded in 1970 led by Larry Willis, \"Man, this is a great album. This was Larry's first as a leader, I loved playing with Larry, he was a beautiful player.\" I asked Al about his upcoming gigs, \"Oh, I'll be playing around, doing some stuff at Mezzrow soon.\" 'That's a great venue, I love that space,' I said, 'I was lucky to see Brad Mehldau perform solo there last summer.' \"Yes it is a great space. I love Brad, he is a genius,\" Al gushed. I couldn't agree more! Erin and I thanked Al for his time and especially his contributions to the beautiful music which has been such a positive force in our lives these many years.\n\nAl Foster, a terrific drummer, kind and generous, as Miles said, he keeps the groove going on forever.\n\nCAR WASH (1976) signed by Gary\n\nAnyhoo, I saw Gary last week on a rare visit to New York away from his lair in Marina Del Rey. Gary was in town to celebrate the launch of \"Stones Touring Party\" on iHeartPodcasts which details the first Stones’ tour since the mayhem and murder at the Altamont Speedway in December 1969.\n\nStones Touring Party\n\niheart.com\n\nThe Stones had just released Exile On Main Street and they were in the prime of their career. Gary and his fellow tourmate, rock journalist Robert Greenfield, recount the tour and their experiences in gripping detail. Greenfield had been hired to write a book (Stones Touring Party, published in 1974) and he had more than sixty hours of archival interviews with Mick, Keith, Charlie and some friends and artists whom they met along the way. But these interviews have never been heard, and years ago, Greenfield donated these interviews and other artifacts to Northwestern University, and there they sat, rotting in academic obscurity until now.\n\nI listened to the first episode and it was as compelling as it was riveting. It screams for a proper Ken Burns doc treatment, although that seems doubtful, as Mick is as penurious as ever and licensing the music and photos would be cost prohibitive. No matter, go listen to Stones Touring Party wherever you listen to podcasts. You won't be disappointed. It’s always great fun to spend time with Gary Stromberg, especially on the internets! I am reminded that we are all storytellers, some, like Gary, just happen to be more gifted.\n\nStart me up, indeed!\n\nBlues Farm (1970) signed by Bob, Ron Carter\n\nI was not always a jazz music snob, I seemed to have been born and raised that way. My love for music happened at an early age. I was surrounded by sounds, my grandmother and mother played piano, and my father played saxophone, although I never heard him play. He talked about it a lot, like he talked about a lot of things! There was a record player spinning Herb Alpert's \"Whipped Cream\", Roger Williams' \"Georgy Girl\", Louis Armstrong's \"Mack The Knife\", or anything by Frank Sinatra. There was always music, even as it emanated from a sturdy, faux mahogany Magnavox console which doubled as a sideboard during holiday meals, or as a bookshelf and cabinet long after the electronics failed. It was as much a part of the fabric of 1960s and 1970s entertainment as anything.\n\nIn 1973, our family took a summer vacation to visit Washington, DC where we saw all the major tourist attractions and museums. As we made the winding and torturous drive from Massachusetts, my two older brothers and I bickered incessantly In the back seat of my father's Cadillac. The fighting ceased when we went to the Smithsonian. The Smithsonian Collection Of Classic Jazz, a six lp box set had just been released, a treasure trove of brilliant songs, from Scott Joplin's 1916 \"Maple Leaf Rag\" to Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five's seminal 1920s recordings to deep cuts from Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, and Sonny Rollins. My dad purchased this collection at the gift shop for the princely sum of $25 - the best $25 he ever spent. The liner notes were brilliantly written and annotated by jazz scholar Martin Williams, and when we got back home, I dove into the deep end of classic jazz with this wonderful collection and, in many ways, I have yet to emerge. It remains a fabulous primer for any music enthusiast.\n\nTouchdown (1978) signed by Bob\n\nThe success of One, Bob's debut album on CTI released in 1974, led to unprecedented acclaim and his subsequent albums, cleverly titled Two, Three, and BJ4, are among the most sampled albums in the history of hip-hop. How a bookish, mild mannered, midwestern piano savant became the darling and avatar of hip-hop artists is truly remarkable. According to whosampled.com, more than fifteen hundred samples of Bob's compositions have appeared in songs by Run-DMC, Beastie Boys, A Tribe Called Quest, Danny Brown, Ice-T and the Wu Tang Clan among so many others, as unlikely a group of collaborators and co-conspirators as you can imagine. You wouldn't think that Ghostface Killah would have much sympatico with Bob James, but you (and I) would be wrong!\n\nFor his part, Bob is gracious about all the fuss, \"Life has treated me real well. Being a part of rap history is just another extremely good thing that's happened to me in my career. I've heard about other composers of my era who don't like their work being sampled or touched, but I've never felt cheated. I mean, sampling gave my work a life of its own without me being in the creative process at all. I'm just a bystander watching it happen. It's a bit strange, but it's a good thing because of the exposure, In many instances, it led hip hop listeners who've recognized certain samples to dive into my additional works. And seeing how sampling isn't just a passing fad, or that it was done in a novelty kind of manner, makes me extremely flattered...\" And I'm sure the steady flow of royalties from these artists continues to ease the burden!\n\nI have always loved music and theater and dance and cinema and painting, all the arts. I was really into that all my life. But jazz, I got very interested in jazz from when I heard Duke Ellington at twelve years old, that is what started me into the jazz world. It was the hottest swinging, spicy music that I had ever heard. I heard the records that he had made in 1929 and 1930, when he had the original Jungle band with Bubber Miley on trumpet and I bought those records as a kid without knowing what they were exactly. I was just intrigued by the way they looked on the shelf. I had some birthday money. I was twelve years old and I bought them without listening to them. I look them home and I flipped. That was the birth of my interest in jazz really. At sixteen years old, a few years later, I heard a record of Sidney Bechet playing a Duke Ellington piece actually and that combination was just magic for me.\n\nSteve Lacy\n\nI saw it happen with Cecil Taylor. I worked with him for six years in the '50s and at that time, he was really in the avant-garde and almost nobody was interested in what he was doing. In fact, he was considered a musical terrorist at that time. Almost everybody was against what he was doing and it took him about twenty years to break through and I saw that with Monk, who also was considered avant-garde, esoteric, weird and difficult and (with) no technique. That also took about twenty years to clear up so that people started to realize how good it really was. Now, fifty years after Monk wrote all of those things, all of those compositions are classics and all of us want to learn all of them. This is a cultural process. As Monk told me, \"You go your own way and the public catches up with you at a certain point.\" I've seen very often the twenty year gap between the conception and the acceptance. I also think that the more original something is, the more resistance there is to it.\n\nSteve Lacy on the vicissitudes of the public and critics\n\nSoprano Sax (1957) signed by Steve\n\nI met Herbie (Nichols) when he was alive, but I never heard him play his own things. I only heard him play so called Dixieland that he was playing to make a living at. I met him, but I had no idea about his own music until much later when I discovered it through Roswell Rudd and also through Misha Mengelberg. Now, I love it very well, but I didn't know it at the time when he was alive. The thing is, Herbie didn't live long enough to see his music accepted and developed really. Monk was lucky enough to have a wonderful wife, who helped him survive the lean years and he could do his own research and he lived to see his music accepted and flourishing. Ellington, of course, had his wonderful band and he had some great hits. He had some big hits that he wrote that helped him pay the members of his band and keep his music and to be able to realize what he wanted to realize with success. But Herbie, Herbie didn't have a chance really. He died too young and he never lived to see the interest that people have in his stuff. It's very original music and very beautiful stuff and very varied and quite interesting now and more and more people are getting interested in playing it. I think Roswell has done the most to promote it than anybody.\n\nSteve Lacy on the underappreciated composer Herbie Nichols\n\nIt's usually not a direct line from traditional New Orleans jazz to the avant garde, but this was the uncommon path which soprano saxophonist and Jazz master Steve Lacy trod. A prolific artist, Steve released more than one-hundred recordings in his career, participated on dozens more as a sideman, and he is cited as an essential source by fellow saxophone deity Wayne Shorter who proclaimed, \"Anyone who plays soprano orientates himself on Steve Lacy.\" Unlike most of his contemporaries, Steve rarely played jazz standards or show tunes, rather, he was an early champion of the music of Mingus, Monk and Herbie Nichols. For his accomplishments and acclaim, Steve was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, a \"Genius\" Award, in 1992, twelve years before his untimely and unfortunate passing from cancer.\n\nBorn Steven Lackritz in New York City in 1934, Steve was exposed to music as a child playing the piano. Eventually, Steve picked up the clarinet before settling on the soprano saxophone, his weapon of choice and primary instrument. Of his foray into traditional jazz, \"...I was into the traditional jazz world playing with the people from New Orleans, Chicago, Kansas City, and playing traditional jazz. The reception was good there because I wasn't competing with anybody. There was already the trumpet, trombone, and the clarinet in those bands and I was playing the soprano saxophone. I wasn't taking anybody else's job away, so they just sort of added me on.\" Steve developed his chops and jammed with Henry \"Red\" Allen, Pee Wee Russell, Buck Clayton and other musical luminaries. In fact, Rex Stewart, a cornetist with Duke Ellington, suggested he shorten his name to Lacy.\n\nFrom those humble beginnings, Steve’s participation on Gil Evans & Ten led to Steve's first record, Soprano Sax released in 1957, \"I recorded with Gil Evans in his first record for Prestige and as a result of that, the producer, Bob Weinstock offered me my own chance to record under my own name. So I made my first record. I used Wynton Kelly on piano and Dennis Charles on drums, Buell Niedlinger on bass and I did the best I could for a young beginner. I had some Ellington material, one Monk piece, and a calypso piece.\" So long Dixieland, Steve's career was off and running.\n\nReflections: Steve Lacy Plays Thelonious Monk (1959)\n\nHis love of all things Thelonious Monk was nurtured by his friendship and association with the then enfant terrible of jazz, pianist Cecil Taylor. Steve explained, \"I fell in love with his music… I was working with Cecil for six years in the '50s and Cecil turned me onto Thelonious Monk. First, we were playing one of his pieces in Cecil's group and then I went with him to hear Monk in 1955 at a little club in downtown New York. And again, I flipped. Every time, it is some great music that I hear for the first time, I flip. I flip again and again. I really fell for Monk's music and I started to learn it the best I could from his own records. I found to my delight and surprise that it was very good for the soprano saxophone. The range was ideal for me. It was like the right hand of the piano, which is in the same range as the soprano saxophone. They fit me. Those pieces fit me and also, they were very full of challenges and problems. They were difficult to play and nobody else was playing them. Not even Monk was playing them. He wasn't working very much in those days. So it seems like that material was made for me in a way, or made for my instrument.\" For most of 1960, Steve was a member of Thelonious' band and he appeared on The Thelonious Monk Orchestra At Town Hall, an important 1959 recording with other jazz greats, Donald Byrd, Charlie Rouse, Art Taylor and Phil Woods. Steve’s love affair with the music of Thelonious would endure for the entirety of his career.\n\nSteve found a kindred spirit and collaborator in trombonist Roswell Rudd, as he recalled, \"We were like fellow researchers. We both love Ellington and the whole history of jazz, but especially we were very interested in Monk's music. We worked together on it to discover how it was made and what it consisted of. He helped me correct my mistakes and I helped him find good parts for him to play on the trombone, so we collaborated on that and the thing is, you have read the expression \"Sunday painters.\" Well, we didn't want to be that. We wanted to play that every night and for a long enough time so that we got to the bottom of it and also, so that we could play it freely. If you only play something once in a while, you can't, you have to be very polite with the material. You can't take liberties with it. We felt that if we played this music long enough, we could find a freedom on the other side and sure enough, we were right. Of course, we couldn't make any money then. Back then, it was considered very weird to have a quartet with no piano, playing the music of Thelonious Monk in little cafes in New York. That was really underground.\"\n\nMomentum (1987) signed by Steve\n\nWhile the music was new and challenging, the audiences were not as welcoming. In the 1960s, there seemed to be more opportunities in Europe and Steve found that many of his peers were enjoying a comfortable life there as expats. After marrying Swiss vocalist/violinist Irene Aebi in 1967, and touring extensively in Europe, Steve and Irene moved to Rome, then settled in Paris. Steve explained his departure with this illuminating observation, \"...when we left in the Sixties, the music that we were doing was rather still underground. There was little interest in it and we couldn't make a living with it. That was out of the question. When I got to Europe, I found that one could make a living with it over there. There were all the different countries, all the different cities, and lots of good musicians here and there and radio stations, record companies, critics, fans, everything. There was everything that was not in America at that time and so I stayed. It did flourish for a long time and now it started to get better in America and I am working more and more here, so it was logical to follow the music back home. The artistic context is very high there. It is an older civilization. It is older in that it goes back further than it does here and the culture is more grown. It is longer grown. That includes painting and music and dance and lots of things like that. Here, it is a few hundred years old and there, it may be a thousand years or more and in some places, there is much more than that. That is an important part because any kind of art is an organic commodity that is grown under circumstances with influence and inspiration from the surroundings. For example, Italy is a beautiful place and has a very high level of culture and the music, the people understand music extremely well. They listen to opera in their own language and their ears are highly developed really. In America, you have good listeners and all of that and good performers, but it is a younger kind of thing. It isn't as deep as it is over there yet because it can't be. Too little time has gone by. Even jazz is just about a hundred years.\"\n\nFor more than thirty-five years, Steve and his wife remained in Europe, performing and recording, until the unrelenting hellhounds of the French tax authorities forced Steve to relocate back to the United States. For the last two years of his life, Steve accepted a position as a professor of music at the New England Conservatory of Music where he nurtured and mentored students, and continued to perform concerts.\n\nSempre Amore (1987) signed by Steve, Mal Waldron\n\nErin and I were lucky to see Steve at the Village Vanguard in New York City in 1996. It was a rare stateside appearance at the venerable and intimate club, and he was joined by his longtime friend Mal Waldron on piano. Steve recounted their association, \"I've known Mal from the Fifties. We worked together back then. He was on my second record. We were accompanying the poets together at the old Five Spot. Then we met again later in Europe. We both moved to Europe around the same time in the mid-Sixties. Then finally, in the Seventies, I started to work with him and he started to work with me and then we started doing duos together and it just went on and on and on. A collaboration like that is rare and very precious and flourishes. It is organic. It goes on and on and on until it can't go on anymore. Mal is a wonderful accompanist. He can make anybody sound good. I like to play with him because he made me sound good.\"\n\nIt was a Tuesday night late show and the environment at the Vanguard was loose and low key. The show wasn’t sold out and there wasn’t a lot of fussing, just two master musicians collaborating and creating. The program was Monk, Mingus and some knotty originals, a perfect display of their wonderful interplay and longstanding chemistry. Steve was blowing hot and cold while Mal could do it all: swing, bebop and even mixed in some dissonance. It was a remarkable and engaging performance. After the show, I chatted briefly with Steve and he was gracious as he signed his albums. As he signed Soprano Sax, \"You know, this was the beginning for me.\" When he signed Reflections, he noted, \"This is all Thelonious, what a musician he was.\" I thanked Steve for his time and, especially, his music.\n\nSteve Lacy once described his vocation as \"combination orator, singer, dancer, diplomat, poet, dialectician, mathematician, athlete, entertainer, educator, student, comedian, artist, seducer, and all-around good fellow.\" What a powerful legacy he and his music leaves."
