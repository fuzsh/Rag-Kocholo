        "text": "One of the many reasons why I always hunt for happiness ðŸ˜„ I traveled to Alton on Friday to go to another wheelchair showroom to trial and test more wheelchairs for the skating I do with Wheels and Wheelchairs. We are on a hunt for a wheelchair which will be tailored to my needs and will be comfier than the ones we have. This was the first time I had ever been to Alton and I quickly discovered that, no, Alton Towers is not in Alton! ðŸ˜… Left home at 8, got a bus and on the tube to Waterloo, 45 minutes before my train was ready. I was offered the train before but I declined as I was meeting someone at Clapham Junction. I didn't have to run like a headless chicken and relax for once. Two hours flew by and we arrived at GRX Life. When I went to Wheelfreedom which was my first wheelchair showroom ever I was starstruck and I had the same feeling again. I know there are many different types of chairs but seeing 30 in one room is so cool knowing that each one can be custom made ðŸ˜Ž The assessment went well, tried different seating and had a good experience. I want to go to more showrooms, so if anybody wishes to invite me then please do! ðŸ˜† It was time to go home and we had 20 minutes to get to the station or we would have to wait a whole hour for the next one (and it was going to take 15 minutes to get there AND we still had to pack everything up ðŸ‘€). We somehow got to the station with two minutes to spare but we still had to unload! Luckily the train guard kindly waited for us which she really didn't have to but as they were every hour she allowed it. We were grateful! We get close to Waterloo and the train guard rings ahead to hopefully get me assistance to the underground at the station. She rings up and I could see her face dropâ€¦ no tube trains are going through Waterloo! ðŸ™„ No reason was specified which made planning a little difficult! I was advised to go to Victoria but I needed to get to Stratford which required me to still go through Waterloo from where I was. To cut a long story short by the time that I had arrived in Victoria to find out what was going on, the problem had already resolved itself and the tube continued as normal. But now that I was in Victoria an extra 40 minutes was now added to my journey home! ðŸ™„ During all this I looked at my friend and said; having a disability makes life interesting and the reason that I always smile and laugh during these situations is if I didnâ€™t, I would be so moody all the time! ðŸ˜‚ We have to be grateful I can travel compared to 20 years ago when it was pretty much nonexistent! ðŸ˜… This came in nicely when I saw a post by Tiankai mentioning â€˜Hunt For Happiness Weekâ€™ which is a week I have never heard of but you have to love how this came in perfectly. Lifeâ€™s not easy and will get tough but situations are situations, it just depends how you perceive itâ€¦ will you hunt for happiness or will you let it drag you down? ðŸ™ƒ #happiness #wheelchair #grateful #experience #disability"
