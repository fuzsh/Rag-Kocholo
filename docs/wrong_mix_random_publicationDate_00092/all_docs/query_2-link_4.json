        "text": "By\n\nYou could boil the legacy of Stax Records down to a single recording: \"Green Onions\" by Booker T. and the M.G.'s. Homegrown soul music, funky enough for dancing yet rich enough for repeated headphone listening.\n\nPlayed by two black men and two white men in complete simpatico, at a time when they could have not eaten lunch together in many places.\n\nYou could boil Stax down to \"Green Onions,\" but why would you want to? Why give up Carla Thomas, Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, the Bar-Kays, Isaac Hayes and the Staple Singers?\n\nIn \"Respect Yourself: Stax Records and the Soul Explosion,\" Robert Gordon, long an authoritative writer on the Memphis music scene, chronicles the growth of Stax (and later its sister label, Volt) from a modest garage studio in 1957 to a hit-making Southern counterpart to Motown — and through its decline and bankruptcy in 1975.\n\nJim Stewart, a white country fiddler and banker, started the studio that became Stax; his sister Estelle Axton invested in it a year later. Stewart ran the studio; Axton ran the connected record shop, which also served as an informal research department. A few early successes with black musicians and an alliance with DJ/singer Rufus Thomas led Stax to focus on black music, which grew into the sound we that now call soul.\n\n\"The spirit that came from Jim and his sister Estelle Axton allowed all of us, black and white, to come off the streets, where you had segregation and the negative attitude, and come into the doors of Stax, where you had freedom, you had harmony, you had people working together,\" said Al Bell, the promotional wizard who pushed Stax's records to black radio stations around the country.\n\nFor many years, Stax was a small family business where youth could get a job helping out, then become key session players, as Steve Cropper did, and where an unknown chauffeur could get an impromptu audition, then become an electrifying vocal star, like Redding.\n\nA house band evolved, built around the guys who became the M.G.'s: keyboardist Booker T. Jones, guitarist Cropper, drummer Al Jackson Jr., and bassist Duck Dunn (who replaced an earlier bassist). With the songwriting, arranging and producing duo of Isaac Hayes and David Porter, they became the Big Six who defined Stax's studio sound, though many other musicians had a hand in it.\n\nIn contrast to Motown's top-down, factory-like approach, Stax made music in a freewheeling, homemade, bubble-up fashion. Stewart may have been a white country boy, but he had a good ear and a guiding vision. Sam Moore, of Sam and Dave, remembers some advice Stewart gave him: \"'You're trying to compete with Motown,' he told me. 'Stop. Motown's vision is pop. You are raw soul. Let's concentrate on that.'\"\n\nWatching the Stax crew work revived Atlantic Records exec Jerry Wexler's love of the creative process: \"Instead of working from written arrangements, they built the record organically — not deductively. I'd see the M.G.'s come to work in the morning, hang up their coats, gather up their axes, and start playing music. Maybe it was some chord changes, maybe it was a lick, maybe it was a song, but they started playing, they started building it. I said, 'My God, this is fantastic.'\"\n\nHits poured out of Memphis, bringing rewards for everyone, but also the difficulties of success: disputes over money and production credits, power struggles between new and old employes. Redding's death in a plane crash in 1967 — in Lake Monona near Madison, a crash that also killed four members of the Bar-Kays — shook the label, too.\n\nWhile Stewart could be stubborn and prickly, he was a loyal, handshake-deal guy, and not as skeptical of contracts as he might have been, which hurt some business deals. He mortgaged his house to try save Stax in 1975 and lost it.\n\nGordon spends some narrative energy on the toxic racial climate of Memphis then and civil rights efforts there. This helps provide context for understanding how remarkable Stax's interracial dynamic was.\n\n\"When Stax artists discuss race, nearly all call Stax an 'oasis' — the same word recurs in interview after interview,\" Gordon writes. But I'll admit to having hurried through some of the Memphis segments to get to the next anecdote about how a great recording was made."
