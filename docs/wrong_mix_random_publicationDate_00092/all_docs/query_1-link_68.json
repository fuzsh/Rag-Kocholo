        "text": "Joe Biden Leaves the Stage\n\nThe Shakespearean end to a distinguished reign.\n\nJ. D. Vance and the Empty Promises of Conservative Economic Populism\n\nDoes Donald Trump’s running mate have the power, or the inclination, to thwart the corporate wings of his party?\n\nWhere Do Republicans and Democrats Stand After the R.N.C.?\n\nBiden imperilled his candidacy at the debate. At the Convention, Trump was doing something similar.\n\nThe Unexpectedly Hopeful Paris Olympics\n\nThe Games have never lived up to all their ideals. And yet this year’s iteration, for all its flaws, has already inspired some positive change.\n\nInside the Trump Plan for 2025\n\nA network of well-funded far-right activists is preparing for the former President’s return to the White House.\n\nThe Kamala Harris Social-Media Blitz Did Not Just Fall Out of a Coconut Tree\n\nThe memes, riffs, and fancams represent a near-consensus that the Vice-President’s time is now.\n\nWhy Donald Trump Picked J. D. Vance for Vice-President\n\nThe Ohio senator is an attack dog for the former President, but he is also something more emergent and interesting: he is the fuse that Trump lit.\n\nThe Spectacle of Donald Trump’s R.N.C.\n\nAn inside look at the Republican Party’s weeklong celebration of the former President.\n\nThe Current Cinema\n\n“Twisters” Takes the Fun Out of Heavy Weather\n\nThe original “Twister” had no compunction about making tornadoes look awesome. Lee Isaac Chung’s sequel treats them as deadly serious.\n\nCultural Comment\n\nThe Summer of Girly Pop\n\nThis season’s hits have been exuberant and canny, treating femininity as a kind of inside joke.\n\nOn Television\n\nJulio Torres’s “Fantasmas” Finds Truth in Fantasy\n\nIn the comedian and writer’s new HBO show, guest stars and surreal distractions provide witty symbolic keys to serious themes.\n\nUnder Review\n\nOlivia Laing Goes Back to the Garden\n\nIn the writer’s new book, cultivating your own plot is both a contemplative practice and a communal act.\n\nOn and Off the Menu\n\nTea and Beachside High Jinks in Provincetown\n\nThe town’s restaurants evince a singular mix of gay utopia and New England kitsch.\n\nCritics at Large\n\nAlice Munro’s Fall from Grace\n\nRevelations about the writer have reignited debates about how to reckon with artists who do terrible things. Have the years since #MeToo yielded any answers?\n\nA Summer of Sci-Fi\n\nA new book claims that a few big summer movies heralded an epochal shift in the motion-picture industry, but is that really how cultural history works?\n\nThe Bluestockings Were Fiercer Than You Imagined\n\nIn eighteenth-century England, a cohort of intellectual women braved vicious mockery. But when it came to policing propriety, they could dish it out, too.\n\nPower of the Pirates\n\nWe’ve long viewed them as liberty-loving rebels. But it’s time to take off the eye patch. ​​Were they foes of the modern order?\n\nThe Knotty Death of the Necktie\n\nThe pandemic may have brought an end to a flourishing history. For all the accessory’s absurdity, it deserves a moment of mourning.\n\nParadise Bronx\n\nFrom the time of the Revolutionary War to the fires of the nineteen-seventies, the history of the borough has always been shaped by its in-between-ness."
