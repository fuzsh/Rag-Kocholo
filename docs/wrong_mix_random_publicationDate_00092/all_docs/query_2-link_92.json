In some institutions, they face not only the challenge of positioning their new offerings to audiences, but also the challenge of ensuring that they live within the context of their storied pasts, traditions, and reputations. When does a new offering need to diverge from its parent brand? How do we ensure that moving forward doesn’t mean leaving everything behind? Sullivan’s Nicole Ferry and Virginia Tech’s Tracy Vosburgh share their insights, based on their experience working together to help higher ed organizations take flight with new ideas.\n\nNicole Ferry\n\nSullivan\n\nTracy Vosburgh\n\nVirginia Tech\n\nEvolving Higher Ed Landscape\n\nUplifting Under-Represented and Equity-Deserving Voices Through Inclusive Marketing\n\nAt the intersection of UBC’s vision to inspire people, ideas and actions for a better world and institutional mission to foster discourse, knowledge exchange and engagement, UBC mobilizes EDI-related research and expert knowledge to spotlight and encourage discourse around systems and impacts of discrimination.

Leaders often understand the ideal end state: an innovative, data-driven, creative organization that strategically provides value, is operationally effective, and crafts omni-channel campaigns that put our audiences at the center. But achieving that vision can feel insurmountable if you find yourself in a situation that is reactive, transactional, and siloed. One way to address this challenge is to use a maturity model to guide your efforts.\n\nJaime Hunt\n\nOld Dominion University\n\nResearch, Measurement & ROI\n\nTuition Transparency in Higher Education: A Mixed Methods Study\n\nRWJ Research has conducted a series of studies to assess the value of higher education, the impact of advertised tuition prices, and the effect of scholarships on the application and enrollment decisions of prospective students and their families.\n\nDavid Bushman\n\nBridgewater College\n\nJessica Neumann-Kersten\n\nRW Jones Agency\n\nKevin Swartout\n\nRankin Climate\n\nInnovation Showcase\n\nHow AI, Brand Action and Accessibility are Game Changers for Universities\n\nThe AI Advantage: How Artificial Intelligence is Transforming Creativity in Higher Education Marketing | Net Natives\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is here — and it’s impacting higher ed marketing in a major way.

Bad content can be the barrier keeping them from understanding instructions, following processes, and feeling welcome at your institution.\n\nDrawing from the personal story of a Latina teenager and Ologie’s most recent web study, this talk will showcase how traditional admissions content can exclude the very groups you want to include — and it will show you the role marketers can play in creating access at our institutions.\n\nThe Intersection of Brand and Revenue: The Kurt Vonnegut Effect | Zillion\n\nIs it better for a brand to be or to do? Defining a brand through its identity or through its actions? While this isn’t a black-and-white question, the answer just may be. Because one of these options has the potential to generate affinity across wider audiences, which, in turn, drives improved results and greater revenue.

They produce content to drive brand awareness and engagement, and invest in templated and salesy paid media campaigns to drive demand and leads that hopefully turn into applicants and enrollments.\n\nThe problem with this siloed approach is that graduate student prospects want to be engaged via authentic faculty, student, and alumni content at every stage of the marketing and enrollment funnel. Failing to leverage a content-first approach in paid media results in missing key opportunities to differentiate your brand and beat out the competition.\n\nContent-first paid media strategies hook your prospects on the promise of actionable insights into an immediate problem they’re trying to solve at work (like wanting to become a better data analyst). They then spoil them at every step through engaging and authentic (aka non-salesy) content rooted in faculty, alumni, or student stories and learnings. This results in ads, nurture campaigns, social media, and other marketing tactics that stand out and allow your prospects to attach to actual people at your institution.\n\nCiting examples from their work across the Tufts School of Medicine, Northeastern University, Babson College, the University of Cambridge, the University of New Mexico, and Assumption University, Viv Higher Education’s co-founder and CEO Suzan Brinker, along with Viv’s Director of People and Process, Audra DeLaney-Hall, will present winning strategies for creating content-first enrollment marketing campaigns that result in lower costs, higher engagement, and more enrollments than traditional paid media campaigns.\n\nSponsored by Viv Higher Education\n\nSuzan Brinker\n\nViv Higher Education\n\nAudra DeLaney-Hall\n\nViv Higher Education\n\n2:30 pm - 3:00 pm\n\nExhibit Hall Break\n\n3:00 pm - 4:00 pm\n\nHow It's Made\n\nWe ‘Bout That Action: Effectively Motivating Your Audience\n\nJackson State University has been a consistent winner for the past six years of participation in The Home Depot’s Retool Your School Competition.
