        "text": "\"200\" is the sixth episode of the tenth season, as well as the landmark 200th episode of Stargate SG-1.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nBefore Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell can celebrate his 200th trip through a Stargate, he and his team must work with Martin Lloyd on several ideas for the TV movie adaption of the TV series Wormhole X-Treme!.\n\nPreviously on Stargate SG-1[]\n\nSG-1 makes contact with Martin Lloyd, an alien living on Earth and being drugged by the crew of his ship to forget his alien origins. Martin later creates Wormhole X-Treme! from his subconscious knowledge of the Stargate Program.\n\nPlot[]\n\nMartin Lloyd returns to Stargate Command looking for assistance from SG-1 with his feature film script. The team is reluctant, especially Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell, who is excited about his next off-world mission which marks his 200th trip through an event horizon. However, when technical glitches prevent the team from gating off-world, they are stuck in the briefing room under the orders of Major General Henry Landry, because The Pentagon believes a successful science fiction film about intergalactic wormhole travel will serve as a good cover story to keep the Stargate Program a secret.\n\nThe notes session, however, quickly devolves into the team members pitching their own versions of a successful sci-fi film, including: a zombie invasion (from Mitchell); a previously unseen mission where Colonel Jack O'Neill became invisible (from Lt. Colonel Samantha Carter); \"tributes\" to The Wizard of Oz and Farscape (from Vala Mal Doran); and Teal'c as a private investigator (from Teal'c himself). Additionally featured are a vignette of the team's mental image of a \"younger and edgier\" SG-1 (sparked by the studio's suggestion to replace the original Wormhole X-Treme! cast), a suggested scene by Martin that turns out to be both scientifically inaccurate and highly derivative of Star Trek, a version of the original movie where all the characters are marionettes, and even an imagined wedding that features the return of Major General Jack O'Neill. Also, there's a hint that O'Neill could have been Mitchell's father, as SG-1 had traveled back in time to 1969 in \"1969\", but it turns out to be just a joke. However, the planning session is all for naught, since the studio ultimately decides to cancel the movie in favor of renewing the series.\n\nSG-1, Jack, General Landry and Harriman all later head through the Stargate to P2C-106 with Cameron believing that they're going on a mission when in actuality, there's a party being for him to celebrate his 200th trip through the Stargate.\n\nAt the end of the episode, the focus shifts ten years into the future into the year 2016 and shows an interview with the Wormhole X-Treme! cast and crew celebrating their 200th episode as well as renewed plans for a movie.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nAppearances for 200\n\nLocations\n\nMilky Way\n\nEarth\n\nColorado Springs, Colorado\n\nStargate Command\n\nBriefing Room\n\nEmbarkation room\n\nGeneral's Office\n\nStargate Operations room\n\nHollywood, California (Mentioned)\n\nMalibu, California (Mentioned)\n\nSilver Creek, Minnesota\n\nJonathan J.

Below is a breakdown of the references in the episode by the order in which they appear:\n\nPrecredits sequence\n\nThe precredit sequence includes scenes from a real previous Stargate SG-1 episode, \"Wormhole X-Treme!\", intercut with footage of other episodes as well as a pretend episode in which SG-1 (with Colonel Jack O'Neill) meet the infamous Furlings.[1] Robert C. Cooper had written the Furlings into the Season 2 episode \"The Fifth Race\" referring to them in passing, not anticipating that fans would ask him about this race whenever he went public.[2] The Furlings in this episode look like four-foot tall koalas, speak with a high-pitched voice and live in a village similar to the Ewoks in Star Wars.[3] (The look of the Furlings in this episode is based on koalas after a joke photoshop session of art director James CD Robbins.[2]) Producer Joseph Mallozzi had hinted at an actual appearance of the Furlings early on,[4] creating considerable hype. Dr. Daniel Jackson greets the Furlings with \"we thought we'd never get to meet you\", but since they only appear as part of Martin Lloyd's script reading, SG-1 has still yet to meet the actual Furlings.[2]\n\nAfter the \"Previously on\" sequence has ended, Jackson asks who would make a movie out of a series that only lasted three episodes, to which Teal'c replies that it had strong DVD sales. This is a reference to Firefly,[5] a scifi show that was canceled after airing 11 episodes, but high DVD sales allowed the creation of the feature film Serenity. Martin also threatens to take the movie to another studio if the present one does not like the budget; Joss Whedon actually did switch studios to produce Serenity, moving it from Fox to Universal. Martin also insists, like Firefly/Serenity, that the movie would not use footage from the original series as it is \"not a clip show\".\n\nConcerning the opening title sequence for the movie, Mitchell would prefer it to be strong, but Martin states that opening credit sequences are no longer common and have been replaced by simple title screens. His remark is followed by an uncharacteristic five second title screen for Stargate SG-1. Aside from the more obvious gag, this short sequence is the writers poking fun at Sci-Fi Channel shortening the title sequence of SG-1 once.[2] There is a trend in many recent television shows to forgo the traditional opening and theme song, like for Lost, something the SciFi Channel also pursued for the first 10 episodes of SG-1's Season 9, a decision panned by many fans.[6] It is also interesting to note that this occurred with the third Stargate series, Stargate Universe where a quick title screen is shown rather than a \"strong\" opening credit sequence.\n\nZombie sequence\n\nWhen Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell's zombie sequence was shot, it was originally much longer but was trimmed.[1] Pierre Bernard appears in Mitchell's zombie sequence as \"zombie\" O'Brien, shot dead by Mitchell. (The O'Brien character first appeared in \"Zero Hour\", and also featured in a comedy segment on Late Night with Conan O'Brien where he was shot dead by Daniel Jackson.)[7]\n\nAllusions to other Stargate SG-1 episodes:\n\nThe zombies are being created by an Ancient healing device, first seen in \"Evolution, Part 2\", and the name \"Telchak\" is a reference to a previously encountered Goa'uld, Telchak.\n\nMissing main man\n\nThis makes light of the fact that O'Neill is no longer part of SG-1, and Mitchell has taken his place. After the team impossibly reaches a Stargate (see 'Cameron's 200th' below), Mitchell suggests a line for his character and Martin responds by saying, \"How many times do I have to tell you, it's not you. Colonel Danning is based on Colonel O'Neill.\"\n\nAllusions to other Stargate SG-1 episodes:\n\nMartin complains that his main actor has pulled out of the film, and asks what to do. Mitchell suggests simply replacing him with another character, which everyone seems to think wouldn't work. This is a nod to the fact that Richard Dean Anderson's character, Jack O'Neill, was replaced on SG-1's roster by Ben Browder's character, Cameron Mitchell. The joke is furthered with the idea of having O'Neill mentioned but not seen, as in Season 9 episodes like \"Beachhead\" or \"Ethon\".\n\nMartin suggests body-swapping, while Vala Mal Doran deems his idea to be ridiculous. Jackson then rolls his eyes at her. \"Body-swapping\" itself has occurred multiple times in SG-1: when Ma'chello swapped bodies with Jackson and O'Neill swapped bodies with Teal'c (\"Holiday\"), when both Jackson and (ironically) Vala herself temporarily inhabited the bodies of a pair of people in another galaxy (\"Avalon, Part 2\") and when Vala controlled Jackson's body in the episode \"Crusade\".\n\nInvisible O'Neill\n\nLt. Colonel Samantha Carter mentions a previously unseen incident when O'Neill was once invisible as an example of a way to avoid using a main actor. This sequence is the result of the writers not knowing whether Richard Dean Anderson would want to appear in this episode, so they wrote around him.[2]\n\nAccording to Robert C. Cooper, the \"Naked Carter\" scene was not very liked in fandom because it was too \"off-color\".[2] In a scene with Teal'c walking down the corridor with invisible O'Neill, Richard Dean Anderson performed himself in a green screen suit in reality, and his voice is heard throughout. The production team originally wanted to hire a man to use in a green suit carrying O'Neill's coffee mug, to be edited out so that the mug would appear to float as if 'invisible' O'Neill carried it. However, since Richard Dean Anderson was there on the day of filming anyway, it was decided that Richard Dean Anderson should effectively appear as his own stunt double.[8]\n\nAllusions to other Stargate SG-1 episodes:\n\nIn the scene with Jackson writing on the whiteboard, he says \"And so by translating this tablet we should be able to determine the most important thing in the universe\" (which is followed by invisible O'Neill's snoring). Translating tablets and other things of implied major importance were featured in SG-1 episodes like \"The Torment of Tantalus\", \"Fallen\" and \"Chimera\", usually enjoyed by Jackson and downplayed by O'Neill.\n\nMartin discards the idea of having an invisible O'Neill, saying that invisibility is too powerful a story device. Carter proposes inventing negative side effects. Exactly such effects were featured in \"Uninvited\" with the Sodan Invisibility device; as a rule, \"advanced technology\" in any episode-format scifi, and particularly in SG-1, that gives the team too great of an advantage is almost always revealed to have serious drawbacks (notably in the episode \"Upgrades\").\n\nCameron's 200th\n\nIn a possible \"sequence\" for the fake movie which features the Replicators, Carter shouts that they have 10 seconds in which to get to the gate, when they promptly arrive to find the valley containing the Stargate swarming with Jaffa and Goa'uld, only to be seen seconds later exiting the gate safely. After the sequence, when the SG-1 team members refuse to accept that they could have made it to the gate in ten seconds, Marty proposes 30 seconds, then 38. Cooper wrote this joke,[2] and it is implied that it refers to 38-minute limit on any Stargate wormhole. Jackson responds sarcastically, stating that the time doesn't even matter as there wouldn't be an actual ticking clock on the screen. Martin replies that the idea of impending doom and a \"Ticking Clock\" on screen is the Mass–energy equivalence of the Entertainment World (as they are also prominently featured in 24), and the writers expressed that they \"are mocking the network\" since they so often get notes saying \"more jeopardy, ticking clock, ticking clock, more jeopardy!\"[2]\n\nCarter makes a statement in her usual techno-babble and an impressed Martin attempts to write down what he remembers of Carter's statements after she refuses to repeat them. In the process, though, he mentions a Flux capacitor (Back to the Future), apparently mis-hearing Carter's mention of the Gate's \"capacitors\" as such.\n\nThe fact that Mitchell was to celebrate his 200th trip through the gate was a nod to the fact that it was the 200th episode of the series.\n\nAllusions to other Stargate SG-1 episodes:\n\nTeal'c says \"I have been reflecting while changing into our gear\" without having the team shown to change their uniforms. This is done again later in the episode when CMSgt. Walter Harriman runs to join them at the gate and impossibly switches to a different uniform on the way. A similar gear change occurred in the episode \"The Light\" when close-to-death Jackson needed to be moved from the Stargate Command infirmary (when he was still in a hospital gown) to another planet, where he was fully dressed in Battle Dress Uniform.\n\nWizard of Oz\n\nVala recounts to Martin a story which turns out to be the The Wizard of Oz, a movie that has been referenced in Stargate SG-1 many times since Season 1.[2] In the sequence, Vala is in the role of \"Dorothy\", Carter the \"Good Witch of the North\", Mitchell the \"Scarecrow\", Jackson the \"Cowardly Lion\", Teal'c the \"Tin Man\" and Major General Henry Landry the \"Great and Powerful Oz\". The writers said this is based on the painting of a fan that they have hanging in their office.[2] Some of the little people in this scene also played Furlings at the beginning of the episode.[1] In another fantasy sequence, Vala/Dorothy tells Landry/Oz that, at first, she \"thought she wanted to go home\", but had decided that she would like to be a regular part of something. The writers said \"it's a subtle joke\", implying it is indeed a reference to her joining Stargate Command and a meta-reference to the character's recurring role prior to becoming a regular in Season 10. This scene was filmed in the Atlantis Gateroom.[1]\n\nBroken Stargate\n\nThis scene was carefully filmed to look real and not give away that it is in fact a gag.[1] First, the Gateroom is then flooded with electricity, and when MSgt. Sylvester Siler tries to fix it, he gets hurled across the room, muttering \"Why does this always happen to me?\" Dan Shea, who plays Siler, is the stunt coordinator on SG-1, and gets hurled across rooms in many episodes (usually followed by being seen in the infirmary later on), most notably in the episode \"Heroes, Part 1\". This scene was filmed three times, and there were thin mats to protect Dan Shea.[1] The writers admitted that he \"had done [these things] seriously [...] as real dramatic moments.\"[2]\n\nAs a solution to how SG-1 survive Martin's idea of the SGC being destroyed, he says they could be beamed out at the last second, something that has happened on the series numerous times, like in \"Off the Grid or \"The Scourge\". In response to Teal'c's doubts, Martin explains the concept of hanging a lantern on a scene: by having someone refer to how convenient it is in dialogue, the writer is essentially winking at the audience, saying that they know it is convenient, but to just go with it. The technique is, more often than not, used for humorous effect, and to counter fan criticisms about plot points that seem too contrived. To illustrate this, Lloyd suggests that Dr. Levant should say that the beaming occurred with \"great timing,\" a reference to Jackson's line in \"Off the Grid\".\n\nMartin then asks \"where were we\" and Teal'c replies \"scene 24\" (a Monty Python and the Holy Grail reference).\n\nThe following explosion is referred to as the end of Act 2 of the movie, and it is also the end of Act 2 of the episode.\n\nStar Trek parody\n\nThis sequence is an obvious Star Trek parody.[2] SG-1 is shown in the set used for the bridge of the Daedalus class battlecruisers wearing uniforms similar to those from the Star Trek universe (specifically The Motion Picture), including color-coding. The doors open and the communications system has the same sound as in Star Trek. Mitchell acts like Captain Kirk, Carter wears an earpiece like communications officer Uhura, and Jackson looks into a science monitor like Spock and uses the classic \"eyebrows\" expression as well as Dr. McCoy's speech pattern. Teal'c is similar to Worf manning a weapons console, while his uniform is similar to Ricardo Montalbán's outfit from The Wrath of Khan. It was Christopher Judge's decision to have his uniform as open in the front.[9] The engine room is an actual still from the Enterprise from Star Trek: The Original Series and is manned by Brad Wright (co-creator and producer of Stargate SG-1) as a Scottish engineer.[1] Originally, Paul McGillion was to play this part, but Brad Wright decided to appear on his show after ten years. According to director Martin Wood, Wright's parents did not recognize their son when they watched this episode.[1] Also, Mitchell asks Carter to \"reverse the polarity,\" a common technobabble plot device used in Star Trek: The Original Series episode That Which Survives, SG-1 episode \"Learning Curve\" and is repeatedly used by the third incarnation of The Doctor from the British BBC-series Doctor Who.\n\nDuring this sequence, when Carter is asked to reverse the polarity, she blinks with \"boing, boing\" sound effect. This is taken from classic sitcom Bewitched, where the witch Samantha Stephens, played by Elizabeth Montgomery, twitches her nose (with the same \"boing, boing\" sound effect) whenever she performs magic. It is also a nod to the similar I Dream of Jeannie, where the character of Jeannie performed magic by blinking.\n\nThis sequence leads Mitchell to state \"Never underestimate your audience. They're generally sensitive, intelligent people who respond positively to quality entertainment.\" This phrasing coming from Mitchell is unusual and noticeable. Given that one of the purposes of this episode is also as a present to fans, this flattering remark can be taken as one designed to break the fourth wall. Aside from the obvious direct reference to the show's fans, the remark may be a reference to the notion of sci-fi fans in general and the high standards they often demand of science fiction. Ben Browder has also been particularly notable in making sure both SG-1 and his previous series Farscape rewarded the viewers by keeping track of everything that's happened and never using a \"reset button.\"\n\nTeen Gate\n\nMartin says that an executive producer has suggested recasting with a \"younger, edgier\" cast. The next sequence adds \"hip\" dialogue, hormonal teenagers (a teenage Teal'c is found passionately kissing a blonde Goa'uld, followed by teenage Carter kissing teenage Mitchell), a rock soundtrack, frenetic camera movements and overly dramatic ideas. When director Martin Wood wanted to include \"younger and hipper\" elements of teenage shows, he actually found them \"really boring\" and needed to \"amp them up a bit\".[1]\n\nFarscape parody\n\nDirector Martin Wood had only seen a handful of Farscape episodes but still wanted to mimic its style, so he asked writer Joseph Mallozzi for the DVDs.[1] Mallozzi, who has watched all Farscape episodes according to Cooper, wrote this scene.[2]\n\nIn the sequence, Vala suggests another idea which Martin recognizes as Gilligan's Island. He advises her that if she is going to rip something off, it should be something more obscure. This leads into a parody of Ben Browder and Claudia Black's previous series Farscape,[1] filmed on the Stargate: Atlantis Wraith set.[2] The scene parodies the large array of invented swearwords in that show.[2] Ben Browder puts on a heavy Australian accent in reference to the show being shot in Australia with mainly Australian actors. Claudia Black/Vala reprises her former role of Aeryn Sun, Carter plays Chiana, Teal'c plays Ka D'Argo, and Thor the Asgard plays Rygel. Michael Shanks was originally to play Stark, and Ben Browder was originally to play his former character John Crichton, but the roles were switched the day before the sequence was shot at the request of the actors. Also, a notable thing is that Stark's mask is on the wrong side of Browder's head. Stark in Farscape wore a right-side mask.[10] According to Cooper, it's a myth that the actors chose to switch their roles because of looking so similar; the reason was rather that Claudia Black and Ben Browder were concerned with playing their old roles.[2] When the scene switches back to the real world, Martin replies that he has no idea what it is, likely referencing Farscape's relative obscurity. Martin receives a text message that his budget is being cut due to the bankrupting of a foreign distributor. The writers said their budget had never been affected in a similar manner.[2]\n\nThe sequence ends with Martin saying he may not be able to complete the special effects sequence at the end of Act 3. At that point, the scene cuts to black and immediately goes to commercials, symbolizing the end of Act 3 of the episode.\n\n1969 mission\n\nThe next scene opens with a jab at the fact that occasionally in the series, a leading character is told that certain information is classified, despite the fact that Stargate personnel have the highest security clearances in United States government. While the SG-1 team members are discussing previous missions, Mitchell then claims to have read all 1,263 reports. Brad Wright later stated that this number doesn't add up to all missions if you account for all the other teams.[2] Carter and Daniel mention Report #30185 which he was not permitted to read. When Vala asks what the mission was, Carter turns to her and proceeds to divulge the main details.\n\nThis is most likely a nod to Ben Browder, who before joining the show watched every single episode from the previous 8 seasons.\n\nThis references how frequently SG-1 arrives at a new planet for diplomatic negotiations for technology and proceed to disgorge the nation's highest classified secrets to aliens.\n\nAllusions to other Stargate SG-1 episodes:\n\nCarter continues with the story about the time the SG-1 team was sent back in time in the episode \"1969\". After revealing that Mitchell was not born yet in 1969, the rest of the team imply that exactly 9 months before Mitchell was born, O'Neill fathered him and continued to take an unusual interest in his career, as seen in \"Avalon, Part 1\". Mitchell refuses to believe it, saying he's getting punk'd (a reference to the TV show), after which Sam admits that they can not reveal what happened. A similar situation occurred in The Terminator when future John Connor was fathered by Kyle Reese while he was in mankind's past.\n\nPuppet sequence\n\nIn response to Martin's news that he can't afford to pay for actors, Mitchell suggests he should use his imagination and make a Supermarionation version. The following sequence then uses puppets to re-play the plot of the original Stargate film. The puppets in this sequence were made by the Chiodo Bros, which also made the puppets for Team America: World Police. Director Martin Wood filmed this sequence with real actors first, and then their background plates were used for the filming of the puppets in front of green screens, which happened in Los Angeles. The puppeteers then made their puppets mimic the actors. Some of the wires had to later be re-added by CG because they didn't show up well enough.[1][11] According to Cooper, a puppet cost about US$25,000.[2] Brad Wright wrote this scene before Christmas, long before the plot of this story was discussed in detail. Cooper then helped in writing the details.[2] The pointing-in-the-air moment of O'Neill was actually done by Richard Dean Anderson, and the puppeteers needed to practice two days to get this short clip right.[2] The discussion between Walter and General Hammond is a lampshade on the fact that there were two gate props used through the show's run. The SGC gateroom gate had a spinning inner ring whereas the gate used for location shoots did not.\n\nMartin's reply is to doubt the possible success of a whole movie made with puppets and mentions jumping the shark, referring to the episode of Happy Days in which the Fonz did exactly that - the phrase is used to indicate when a show has reached its creative peak. After wanting to do a Team America scene, the writers asked themselves, \"how can we ever make our show serious again?\"[2]\n\nAllusions to other Stargate SG-1 episodes:\n\nPuppet Carter parodies Carter's appearance in the first episode of the show, saying \"Just because my sex organs are on the inside instead of the outside doesn't mean I can't handle...\", which was a reference to an actual line of Carter's in \"Children of the Gods\" which was also parodied in \"Moebius, Part 1\". Brad Wright has also mocked the line several times himself.\n\nThe puppet Walter announces each chevron as \"lit up\" instead of the more usual and more dramatic \"encoded\", and finishes with \"Chevron Seven is also lit up,\" instead of the usual \"Chevron Seven locked.\"\n\nThe scene ends with the cords manipulating the SG-1 puppets being cut, while a shocked Walter and Lt. General George S. Hammond look on, echoes the archival footage of Ernest Littlefield's 1945 trip through the gate (\"The Torment of Tantalus\").\n\nA twist\n\nMartin talks about needing a twist that the audience would not expect, at which point O'Neill walks into the room. Jackson and Carter doubt that anyone would not see that coming, noting that there will be spoilers, and predict that \"it'll be in the commercial.\" This sequence is a reference to the numerous times that trailers and commercials have spoiled plot twists, like TV Guide spoiling the fourth act twist of \"Solitudes\".[2] The writers knew that O'Neill appearing was anti-climactic and anticipated him appearing in commercials, but according to Martin Wood, the fans responded exactly like the producer had wished for.[1][2] Producer and writer Joseph Mallozzi also bemoaned in personal blogs that Sci-Fi Channel commercials spoil significant plot twists.[12] In bumps shown for this episode on Sci-Fi, the scene where O'Neill walks into the room was, of course, used.\n\nTeal'c P.I.\n\nTeal'c pitches an idea of himself as a private investigator in a trailer which airs after a commercial break, giving the impression of being a possible genuine series. In the trailer, Teal'c throws a man through a glass pane door, stands over him, and says \"Indeed\" in a stylish voice before touching the brim of his hat. The insignia on the door to Teal'c's office is his Jaffa mark. The end credits reveal that Isaac Hayes (who previously played Tolok in Stargate SG-1) did the voice-over for this vignette. Hayes had written and recorded the theme for the 1971 movie Shaft, which also featured a black private detective.\n\nSeason 8 ending\n\nWhen wondering how to end the movie, O'Neill suggests a fishing scene and comments that it would not make sense to continue after that. This could be a reference to the fact that season 8 was meant to be the last of the series before it was renewed for another two seasons. The final shot from the Season 8 finale \"Moebius, Part 2\" is then shown, with SG-1 at O'Neill's pond. This time it includes a brief shot of Mitchell and Vala also at the pond, who weren't part of the cast then. Martin Wood employed whip pans to make this more obvious.[1]\n\nAllusions to other Stargate SG-1 episodes:\n\nO'Neill calling the Stargate \"the Orifice\" was a scripted ad lib, written by Robert C. Cooper. He was aware that it did not sound as tasteful as it was intended to sound.[2] The Stargate had many different names in the show, for example \"stone ring\", \"ring of the Gods\", and \"Chappa-ai\".\n\nMartin asks what the twist would be: \"No fish?\" This is a further reference to \"Moebius, Part 2\", where SG-1 traveled in time and disturbed the \"present\" timeline. When the timeline was restored, there were fish in the lake, when previously there weren't.\n\nWedding sequence\n\nAs an alternative twist, Vala suggests a wedding. O'Neill and Carter are about to marry in this imaginary sequence, Jackson is the best man, Vala is the bridesmaid, and Kvasir appears as the minister. All people who worked on Stargate for the past 10 years appear as guests in the wedding sequence: Peter F. Woeste (director of photography), Andy Mikita (director), Christina McQuarrie (costume), John Lenic (producer), Mark Davidson (set decorator), Jan Newman (make-up artist), Dan Shea (stunt cordinator), Michelle Comens (visual effects supervisor), \"Trudy of accounting\", and more.[1][2]\n\nIn this sequence, Jackson stands next to O'Neill at the altar before the bride shows up and comments \"People will think that you and I are...\" In another take, Richard Dean Anderson replied by yelling \"We're GAY!?\"[13] which the writers considered inappropriate, but Brad Wright said that \"the joke was already implied [as a homosexual pairing].\"[2] It turns out that Carter is the bride, referencing to the wish of many fans wanting to see a wedding.[2] The scene ends with Marty saying \"I'll do that if I want to torture the audience on purpose,\" referring to the segment of fans that want to see Carter and O'Neill finally begin a relationship.\n\nThe organ music that plays during the ceremony combines the familiar wedding march by Wagner with the Stargate SG-1 theme.\n\nFinal SG-1 scene\n\nWhen the team leaves for the working Stargate, Martin replies \"I still don't have my ending.\" This was the writers' reference to not having an ending since the puppet sequence was so expensive.[2] The \"ten years later\" scene was only added as an afterthought.[1]\n\nMartin reports the Wormhole X-Treme! movie has been cancelled because the show was picked up again, echoing the Stargate writers' plans for a movie always being disrupted by the show being renewed.[14]\n\nLandry invites Walter, who initially protests that he is not wearing the right outfit. Walter nevertheless leaves the control room and is instantly dressed to match SG-1 seconds later as he enters the gate room. This marks the first time that Walter is seen walking through the gate (although he was once offworld in \"Fallen\"). Director Martin Wood wanted to show with Walter that this whole sequence is in fact not real.[1]\n\nClosing Wormhole X-Treme sequence\n\nThe final sequence involves a flashforward of ten years with the cast of Wormhole X-Treme! celebrating 200 episodes, which contains numerous references to the Stargate SG-1 production. The cast stepping through the Stargate, just as SG-1 did moments before in their 200th episode. The Stargate on the set is also similar to the \"real\" Stargates, as opposed to the Wormhole X-Treme one seen briefly in the precredit sequence. The whole sequence (before the \"cast\" interviews) was shot in one go, and you see two cameras filming each other.[1] The interviews were a last minute thing, and according to Wood one of the biggest in-jokes. Martin Wood made sure that Peter DeLuise is in the background of each interview segment, to show that his character as the new guy is still \"eager\".[1]\n\nOne of the Wormhole X-Treme! actors (a Mitchell analogue played by producer Peter DeLuise) talks about a catch phrase as a string of obscenities being \"okay\" because the show is on cable. In Wormhole X-Treme!, the character-character was played by Michael DeLuise, who, as Peter DeLuise's brother, bears some resemblance to him. Since Peter DeLuise is the best at swearing, he should do \"level 6\", then \"level 19\" explicits that had to be beeped out later as an in-joke.[1]\n\nMartin Lloyd receives a cell phone call and tells the fictional cast and crew that they're going to be doing a movie next. The writers had pitched several versions of SG-1 movies over the years, but \"our success kind of got in our way.\"[2] Shortly after this episode aired, two direct-to-DVD movies were announced.\n\nMartin Wood said that most of the things the \"actors\" say are things that the real cast & crew said, but what was taken out of context.[1] According to Robert C. Cooper, \"every single one of these interviews has an incredible kernel of truth to it,\" but all actors were asked before if they were all right with shooting the scenes.[2] The in-jokes are or may be:\n\nThe DeLuise character talks about making viewers forget about the main character who left the show after seven strong years and \"phoning in\" an eighth, a parallel with Richard Dean Anderson's reduced presence in the show during Season 8.\n\nThe Dr. Levant actor discusses leaving and returning to the show, a parallel to Michael Shanks' absence in the show's sixth season. He even refers to fan Web sites hoping to revive the character, parodying the real website SaveDanielJackson.com, stating that they get \"dozens of hits a month.\" He also refers to fans placing an advertisement in Variety, something Firefly fans did in an attempt to stop the series being cancelled.\n\nThe female cast member mentions wanting to have a baby, paralleling Amanda Tapping's absence for pregnancy at the beginning of Season 9. She also mentions that she feels the writers don't know what to do with her character, echoing fan criticisms of the Carter character's writing, as well as mentioning \"maybe directing\". This was indeed something that Tapping had wanted to do, and which she eventually did in the season seven.\n\nIn \"Wormhole X-Treme!\", Grell the Robot (the Teal'c analogue) never says anything, referencing earlier seasons in which Teal'c didn't say much. In \"200\" however, Grell makes the closing statement of the episode:\n\n\"Science fiction is an existential metaphor, that allows us to tell stories about the human condition. Isaac Asimov once said: 'Individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critics and philosophers of today — but the core of science fiction, its essence has become crucial to our salvation, if we are to be saved at all.\"[15]'\n\nNotes[]\n\nThis episode is so named as it is the 200th episode of Stargate SG-1, and is celebratory in nature, as well as being particularly marked as the first time original SG-1 member Major General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) has been seen since the beginning of Season 9 in the episode \"Origin\". On Hulu this episode was given the alternate title \"Remember When.\"\n\nThis episode was preceded by the hour-long promotional documentary Sci Fi Inside: Stargate SG-1 200th Episode on the Sci-Fi Channel that was a look back at the highlights of the previous 9 seasons, featuring interviews with all the original regular cast, save for Don S. Davis (Lt. General George S. Hammond).\n\nThe plotline follows from the 100th episode seen in Season 5, \"Wormhole X-Treme!\".\n\nThis episode is the only one out of the entire Stargate SG-1 series not to have the opening credits as the acting and writing credits were run during the Wormhole X-Treme! interview sequence.\n\nAccording to Gateworld, the SCI FI Channel announced that they would not be renewing their order of Stargate SG-1 for the coming year the day after this episode was aired. Many fans denounced the timing of the announcement, as it was apparently given while the cast and crew were celebrating the episode's airing. It is ironic, too, as the episode spends so much time lampooning SG-1's endurance and past near-cancellations.[16]\n\nSouth Park's landmark 200th episode is also titled \"200\" and celebrates previous episodes with several references throughout.\n\nDuring the zombie scene, Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell leaps over a bunch of boxes with the Atlantis expedition logo on them.\n\nMartin Wood revealed in the commentary that the events of this episode never actually happened and therefore aren't considered canon.\n\nCorin Nemec (Jonas Quinn) is the only SG-1 regular cast member not to appear in this episode.\n\nCory Monteith (Young Mitchell) previously played Genii Private in the Stargate: Atlantis episode \"The Storm\". He later died on July 13, 2013, at the age of 31 while staying at Vancouver's Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel with the cause of death being revealed as a drug overdose.\n\nRichard Dean Anderson (Major General Jack O'Neill) also guest starred in the Stargate: Atlantis episode \"The Real World\", which was originally broadcast on the same day (August 18, 2006).\n\nVala Mal Doran mentions that there is no sexy female alien in the script, a line repeated in Season 5, \"Wormhole X-Treme!\".\n\nThe puppet sequence ends with SG-1 traveling through the Stargate, only to collapse on the other side as their strings are cut when the Stargate shuts down. As Teal'c was also a puppet, this implies that other beings in the universe are also puppets and would not be able to travel via the wormhole due to suffering the same fate. Use of the Stargate network would be restricted to beings without strings.\n\nDuring the puppet scene where puppet Daniel is explaining the gate symbols, a closer look at the prop keyboard used by puppet Walter reveals a mischievous message.\n\nFrom the beginning of Season 9 to episode \"200\", Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell steps through a Stargate on screen roughly 40 times.\n\nGoofs[]\n\nAt 6:26 Amanda Tapping can be seen holding back a laugh at the previous line uttered by Ben Browder.\n\nAwards[]\n\nNominated Hugo for \"Best Dramatic Presentation - Short Form\" (Carl Binder, Robert C.
