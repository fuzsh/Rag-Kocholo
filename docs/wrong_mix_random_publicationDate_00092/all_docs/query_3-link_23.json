        "text": "By Niki King\n\nFor The Kitsap Sun\n\nMemphis, Tenn.\n\nMemphis has always marketed itself as a music city, most notably as the birthplace of rock 'n' roll and home of the blues. The role the city played in shaping yet another powerhouse genre of American music was less remembered — until now.\n\nMemphis has reclaimed its soul.\n\nThe city declared 2007 to be the 50th anniversary of soul music, marking the founding of legendary music label Stax Records in 1957. Stax largely created what we now consider quintessential soul sound from artists such as Booker T &amp; the MGs, Al Bell, Al Green, Isaac Hayes, Mable John, Ann Peebles, Otis Redding, Sam &amp; Dave, the Staple Singers, Rufus and Carla Thomas.\n\nThe anniversary is not just of the past but also of the future. The label was recently resurrected and will offer a new artist release this summer for the first time since 1976.\n\nTo celebrate, the city is offering events, exhibits and concerts throughout the year.\n\nI visited Memphis several weeks ago seeking my own soul experience. When I lived in Memphis about seven years ago, the spot where the Stax studio had stood at College and McLemore Streets was nothing but a deserted lot of rubble in a poverty-stricken, window-barred neighborhood. The only reminder that the likes of Otis Redding and Isaac Hayes had walked the streets was a lone historical marker.\n\nOh, how things have changed.\n\nThanks to a group of anonymous philanthropists, Soulsville today is made up of the Stax Museum of American Soul Music, an accredited charter school and the Stax Music Academy, where music education is used to mentor at-risk inner-city children.\n\nThe museum, which contains more than 2,000 artifacts of the soul era, explains what soul music is (gospel music with secular lyrics), how the Memphis sound differed from Detroits Motown (it's grittier) and the social influences of the time. But to me, the best part was how expertly the museum recounts the complex, incredible story of the labels rise and fall.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Jim Stewart, a white, country fiddler, and his sister Estelle Axton, opened a recording studio in an abandoned theater. Despite the racial tensions of the time, Stewart held an open-door policy for whites and blacks alike to record at his studio. That policy cemented Stax's reputation as a haven of integration. It also catapulted the fledgling business off the ground.\n\n\"We certainly had a wealth of talent just in the neighborhood,\" Stewart once said in an interview for the Rock 'n' Roll History Project. \"A young kid by the name of Booker T. Jones walked in. He lived around the corner. And of course David Porter came by, and then William Brown. We couldn't record anywhere near all that came in.\"\n\nA visitor's map shows where these giants lived, most within a few blocks of the museum. It's worth it to mosey around and see their meager beginnings. Aretha Franklin's childhood home is a shotgun shack.\n\nUltimately, the label's success faltered after the death of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. It fully crumbled after some bad business deals. The building was abandoned and eventually torn down. While today's Soulsville offers an incredible portal into the music of an era, it bothered me to know that it is replica and not a bona fide relic.\n\nAfter all that education about soul music, I was ready to hear some for myself.\n\nStax held a 50th anniversary benefit concert the week I was there featuring old favorites like Booker T. and the MGs, Issac Hayes and Mable John right along with the labels new offerings, NDambi, Soulive and Angie Stone. As I looked out at the crowd, I finally got a real sense of what Stax was all about. The audience was young, old, white and black, many had their eyes closed, snapping, swaying, lost in the spirit of the music, hearing its soul.\n\nIf You Go\n\nStax Museum of American Soul Music: Showcases 2,000 artifacts, photographs and exhibits with historical commentary of Stax and soul artists such as Otis Redding, Johnnie Taylor, Isaac Hayes, The Bar-Kays, Sam and Dave, The Staple Singers, Booker T. and the MGs, Ike and Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, Al Green, Rufus and Carla Thomas.\n\nCall: (901) 946-2535\n\nWeb site: www.staxmuseum.com\n\nMemphis Rock n Soul Museum: The Smithsonian Institutions chronology of the artists and influences of the Memphis sound.\n\nCall: (901) 205-2533\n\nWeb site: www.memphisrocknsoul.org\n\nLive Soul Music in Memphis\n\nWild Bills: A live band plays on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights what is generally regarded as the most authentic soul and blues music in town.\n\nAddress: 1580 Vollintine Ave.\n\nCall: (901) 726-5473\n\nRum Boogie Café: James Govan and the Boogie Blues Band play nightly.\n\nAddress: 182 Beale St.\n\nCall: (901) 528-0150\n\nWeb site: www.rumboogie.com\n\nSoul Food in Memphis\n\nWilliams Street Grocery: For the most authentic soul food in town, including chitlins, ox tails, ham hocks and neck bones.\n\nAddress: 755 Williams Ave.\n\nCall: (901) 942-6444\n\nAlcenias Southern Style Cuisine: Soul vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, okra and black-eyed peas.\n\nAddress: 317 Main St.\n\nCall: (901) 523-0200\n\nWeb site: www.alcenias.com\n\nSoul for the Soul in Memphis\n\nAl Green's Full Gospel Tabernacle: Everyone's welcome to worship with the Reverend on Sundays at 11:30 a.m.\n\nAddress: 787 Hale Road\n\nCall: (901) 396-9192\n\nWeb site: http://www.algreenmusic.com/fullgospeltabernacle.html"
