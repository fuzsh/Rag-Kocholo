        "text": "Russian company engaged in online propaganda\n\nTrump–Russia relations\n\nThe Internet Research Agency (IRA; Russian: Агентство интернет-исследований, romanized: Agentstvo internet-issledovaniy), also known as Glavset (Russian: Главсеть),[1] and known in Russian Internet slang as the Trolls from Olgino (Russian: ольгинские тролли) or Kremlinbots (Russian: кремлеботы[2]), was a Russian company which was engaged in online propaganda and influence operations on behalf of Russian business and political interests.[3] It was linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a former Russian oligarch who was leader of the Wagner Group, and based in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\n\nThe agency was first mentioned in 2016, when Russian journalist Andrey Zakharov published his investigation into Prigozhin’s \"troll factory\".[4] The January 2017 report issued by the United States Intelligence Community – Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections – described the agency as a troll farm: \"The likely financier of the so-called Internet Research Agency of professional trolls located in Saint Petersburg is a close ally of [Vladimir] Putin with ties to Russian intelligence,\" commenting that \"they previously were devoted to supporting Russian actions in Ukraine—[and] started to advocate for candidate Trump as early as December 2015.\"\n\nThe agency employed fake accounts registered on major social networking sites,[5] discussion boards, online newspaper sites, and video hosting services to promote the Kremlin's interests in domestic and foreign policy including Ukraine and the Middle East as well as attempting to influence the 2016 United States presidential election. More than 1,000 employees reportedly worked in a single building of the agency in 2015.\n\nThe extent to which the agency tried to influence public opinion using social media became better known after a June 2014 BuzzFeed News article greatly expanded on government documents published by hackers earlier that year.[6] The Internet Research Agency gained more attention by June 2015, when one of its offices was reported as having data from fake accounts used for biased Internet trolling. Subsequently, there were news reports of individuals receiving monetary compensation for performing these tasks.[7]\n\nOn 16 February 2018, a United States grand jury indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities, including the Internet Research Agency, on charges of violating criminal laws with the intent to interfere \"with U.S. elections and political processes\", according to the Justice Department.[8] On 1 July 2023, it was announced that the Internet Research Agency would be shut down following the aftermath of the Wagner Group rebellion.[9][10]\n\nSee also: Web brigades\n\nIn Leningrad Oblast in the late 1970s, Vladimir Putin's first KGB post was with the 5th Department, which countered dissidents with disinformation using active measures, and was strongly supported by Filipp Bobkov and the head of the KGB Yuri Andropov, who believed in \"stamping out dissent\".[11][12][13]\n\nRevealed on 16 August 2012 in an article by the Russian edition of Forbes magazine, the website for the company Medialogia[b] offered a system known as Prisma terminals (Russian: Терминалы «Призма») which, according to Farit Khusnoyarov,[c] Prism could track for the Kremlin in near real time the stand-alone blog platforms and social networks of nearly 60 million sites and could analyze the tone of the statements of each of these sources with a lag of several minutes or given as an estimated error of 2-3% almost in real time. The article called the terminals Volodin's Prism (Russian: Призма Володина) for Vyacheslav Volodin.[d] After the Snow revolution following the 4 December 2011 Russian legislative elections, Volodin actively used his Prism terminal, which he received on the eve of the elections, to counter dissidents in Russia. Others using Prisma include Sergei Naryshkin's office in the State Duma, senior officials at the Main Center for Communications and Information Security (Russian: Главный центр связи и информационной безопасности) in the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD)[e] senior officials at Moscow City Hall[f] and employees close to the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin.[18][19][20][g]\n\nThe Internet Research Agency was founded in mid-2013.[21] In 2013, Novaya Gazeta newspaper reported that Internet Research Agency Ltd's office was in Olgino, a historic district of Saint Petersburg.[22]\n\nThe terms \"Trolls from Olgino\" and \"Olgino's trolls\" (Russian: \"Тролли из Ольгино\", \"Ольгинские тролли\") have become general terms denoting trolls who spread pro-Russian propaganda, not only necessarily those based at the office in Olgino.[23][24][25]\n\nInformation of the work being conducted at the Agency comes in part from interviews with former employees.[26]\n\nIn February 2023, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the private military company Wagner Group, stated that he founded the IRA: \"I’ve never just been the financier of the Internet Research Agency. I invented it, I created it, I managed it for a long time.\"[27] The admission came months after Prigozhin had admitted to Russian interference in U.S. elections.[27]\n\nRussian newspaper Vedomosti links the approved-by-Russian-authorities strategy of public consciousness manipulation through new media to Vyacheslav Volodin, first deputy of the Vladimir Putin Presidential Administration of Russia.[21][28]\n\nExternal videos Why are Russian trolls spreading online hoaxes in the U.S.?, PBS News Hour (PBS is funded by member station dues, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, corporate contributions, pledge drives, foundations and individual citizens.), 8 June 2015[29]\n\nJournalists have written that Alexey Soskovets, who had participated in the Russian youth political community, was directly connected to the office in Olgino, and that his company, North-Western Service Agency, won 17 or 18 (according to different sources) contracts for organizing celebrations, forums and sport competitions for authorities of Saint Petersburg and that Soskovets' company was the only participant in half of those bids. In mid-2013 the agency won a tender for providing freight services for participants of Seliger camp.[22][30]\n\nIn 2014, according to Russian media, Internet Research Ltd. (Russian: «Интернет исследования») was founded in March 2014, and joined IRA's activity. The newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported that this company is a successor of Internet Research Agency Ltd.[31] Internet Research Ltd. is considered to be linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the holding company Concord Management and Consulting. The \"Trolls of Olgino\" are considered to be his project. As of October 2014, the company belonged to Mikhail Bystrov, who had been the head of the police station at Moscow district of Saint Petersburg.[32]\n\nRussian media point out that according to documents, published by hackers from Anonymous International, Concord Management is directly involved with trolling administration through the agency. Researchers cite e-mail correspondence, in which Concord Management gives instructions to trolls and receives reports on accomplished work.[24] According to journalists, Concord Management organized banquets in the Kremlin and also cooperated with Voentorg and the Russian Ministry of Defence.[33]\n\nDespite links to Alexei Soskovets, Nadejda Orlova, deputy head of the Committee for Youth Policy in Saint Petersburg, disputed a connection between her institution and the trolling offices.[22]\n\nFinnish journalist Jessikka Aro, who reported extensively on the pro-Russian trolling activities in Finland, was targeted by an organized campaign of hate, disinformation and harassment.[34][35][36]\n\nAs reported by Novaya Gazeta, in the end of August 2013, the following message appeared in social networks: \"Internet operators wanted! Job at chic office in Olgino!!! (st. Staraya Derevnia), salary 25960 per month (USD$780 as of 2013). Task: posting comments at profile sites in the Internet, writing thematic posts, blogs, social networks. Reports via screenshots. Individual schedule [...] Payment every week, 1180 per shift (from 8.00 to 16.00, from 10.30 to 18.30, from 14.00 to 22.00). PAYMENTS EVERY WEEK AND FREE MEALS!!! Official job placement or according to contract (at will). Tuition possible.\"[22]\n\nAs reported by media and former employees, the office in Olgino, Primorskiy district, St. Peterburg had existed and had been functioning since September 2013. It was situated in a white cottage,[23] 15 minutes by an underground railway from Staraya Derevnia station, opposite Olgino railway station.[22] Workplaces for troll-employees were placed in basement rooms.[30][37][38][39][40][41][42]\n\nAccording to Russian online newspaper DP.ru, several months before October 2014 the office moved from Olgino to a four-story building at 55 Savushkina Street, Primorskiy district, St. Peterburg.[32][43] As reported by journalists, the building is officially an uncompleted construction and stayed as such as of March 2015.[31][44][45]\n\nA New York Times investigative reporter was told that the Internet Research Agency had shortened its name to \"Internet Research,\" and as of June 2015 had been asked to leave the 55 Savushkina Street location \"a couple of months ago\" because \"it was giving the entire building a bad reputation.\" A possibly related organization, FAN or Federal News Agency, was located in the building. The New York Times article describes various experiences reported by former employees of the Internet Research Agency at the Savushkina Street location. It also describes several disruptive hoaxes in the US and Europe, such as the Columbian Chemicals Plant explosion hoax, that may be attributable to the Internet Research Agency or similar Russian-based organizations.[46]\n\nReported by the Russian online newspaper DP.ru in December 2017, the office moved from the four-story building at 55 Savushkina Street to Lakhta on four floors at Optikov street [ru], 4 building 3 (Russian: Санкт-Петербург: улица Оптикова, 4 корпус 3) near Staroderevenskaya street [ru] (Russian: Стародеревенская улица) in the Lakhta-2 business center (Russian: «Лахта-2») on 1 February 2018.[47][48][49] Beginning in February 2018, they were also known as the \"Lakhta Trolls\" (Russian: Лахта Тролли).[47]\n\nNovaya Gazeta reported that, according to Alexey Soskovets, head of the office in Olgino, North-Western Service Agency was hiring employees for similar projects in Moscow and other cities in 2013.[22]\n\nMore than 1,000 paid bloggers and commenters reportedly worked only in a single building at Savushkina Street in 2015.[50] Many other employees work remotely. According to BuzzFeed News, more than 600 people were generally employed in the trolls' office earlier, in June 2014.[6] Each commentator has a daily quota of 100 comments.[22][51]\n\nTrolls took shifts writing mainly in blogs on LiveJournal and Vkontakte, about subjects along the propaganda lines assigned. Included among the employees are artists who draw political cartoons.[31] They work for 12 hours every other two days. A blogger's quota is ten posts per shift, each post at least 750 characters. A commenter's norm is 126 comments and two posts per account. Each blogger is in charge of three accounts.[32][43]\n\nEmployees at the Olgino office earned 25,000 Russian rubles per month (at the time roughly US$651.41); those at the Savushkina Street office earned approximately 40,000 Russian rubles.[32][43] In May 2014, Fontanka.ru described schemes for plundering the federal budget, intended to go toward the trolling organization.[24][21] In 2017 another whistleblower said that with bonuses and long working hours the salary can reach 80,000 rubles.[52]\n\nAn employee interviewed by The Washington Post described the work:\n\nI immediately felt like a character in the book 1984 by George Orwell — a place where you have to write that white is black and black is white. Your first feeling, when you ended up there, was that you were in some kind of factory that turned lying, telling untruths, into an industrial assembly line.[53]\n\nAccording to a 2018 Kommersant article, Yaroslov Ignatovsky (Russian: Ярослав Ринатович Игнатовский; born 1983, Leningrad) heads Politgen (Russian: \"Политген\") and is a political strategist that has coordinated the trolls' efforts for Prigozhin.[54][55][56]\n\nAccording to the testimonies of the investigative journalists and former employees of the offices, the main topics for posts included:[22][25][32][43]\n\nCriticism of Alexei Navalny, his sponsors, and Russian opposition in general;[31]\n\nCriticism of Ukraine's and the United States' foreign policies, and of the top politicians of these states;\n\nPraise for Vladimir Putin and the policy of the Russian Federation;\n\nPraise for and defense of Bashar al-Assad.[57]\n\nThe IRA has also leveraged trolls to erode trust in American political and media institutions and showcase certain politicians as incompetent.[3] Journalists have written that themes of trolling were consistent with those of other Russian propaganda outlets in topics and timing. Technical points used by trolls were taken mainly from content disseminated by RT (formerly Russia Today).[31][43]\n\nA 2015 BBC News investigation identified the Olgino factory as the most likely producer of a September 2015 \"Saiga 410K review\"[58] video where an actor posing as a U.S. soldier shoots at a book that turns out to be a Quran, which sparked outrage. BBC News found among other irregularities that the soldier's uniform is not used by the U.S. military and is easily purchased in Russia, and that the actor filmed was most likely a bartender from Saint Petersburg related to a troll factory employee.[59][60]\n\nThe citizen-journalism site Bellingcat identified the team from Olgino as the real authors of a video attributed to the Azov Battalion in which masked soldiers threaten the Netherlands for organizing the referendum on the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement.[61]\n\nIn the beginning of April 2014 there began an organized online campaign to shift public opinion in the Western world in a way that would be useful for Russian authorities regarding the Russian military intervention in Ukraine in 2014. Hacked and leaked documents from that time contain instructions for commenters posting at the websites of Fox News, The Huffington Post, TheBlaze, Politico, and WorldNetDaily. The requirement for the working hours for the trolls is also mentioned: 50 comments under news articles per day. Each blogger had to manage six accounts on Facebook, post at least three posts every day, and participate twice in the group discussions. Other employees had to manage 10 accounts on Twitter, publishing 50 tweets every day. Journalists concluded that Igor Osadchiy was a probable leader of the project, and the campaign itself was run by Internet Research Agency Ltd. Osadchiy denied his connection to the agency.[6]\n\nThe company was also one of the main sponsors of an anti-Western exhibition Material Evidence.[62]\n\nIn the beginning of 2016, Ukraine's state-owned news agency Ukrinform claimed to expose a system of bots in social networks, which called for violence against the Ukrainian government and for starting \"The Third Maidan\".[h] They reported that the organizer of this system is the former anti-Ukrainian combatant Sergiy Zhuk from Donbas. He allegedly performed his Internet activity from Vnukovo District in Moscow.[63]\n\nIn March 2014, the Polish edition of Newsweek expressed suspicion that Russia was employing people to \"bombard\" its website with pro-Russian comments on Ukraine-related articles.[64] Poland's governmental computer emergency response team later confirmed that pro-Russia commentary had flooded Polish Internet portals at the start of the Ukrainian crisis.[65][66] German-language media websites were also flooded with pro-Russia comments in the spring of 2014.[67][68][69][70][71]\n\nIn late May 2014, the hacker group Anonymous International began publishing documents received from hacked emails of Internet Research Agency managers.[21][25]\n\nIn May–June 2014, Internet trolls invaded news media sites and massively posted pro-Russian comments in broken English.[72][21][73]\n\nIn March 2015 a service enabling censorship of sources of anti-Ukrainian propaganda in social networks inside Ukraine was launched.[74][75]\n\nThe United States Justice Department announced the indictment on 16 February 2018, of the Internet Research Agency while also naming more than a dozen individual suspects who allegedly worked there as part of the special counsel's investigation into criminal interference with the 2016 election.[76]\n\nRussian bloggers Anton Nosik, Rustem Adagamov, and Dmitriy Aleshkovskiy have said that paid Internet-trolls don't change public opinion. Their usage is just a way to steal budget money.[24][21][25]\n\nLeonid Volkov, a politician working for Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, suggests that the point of sponsoring paid Internet trolling is to make the Internet so distasteful that ordinary people are not willing to participate.[46] The Columbian Chemicals Plant explosion hoax on 11 September 2014, was the work of Internet Research Agency.[46]\n\nAccording to a 2019 report by Oxford researchers including sociologist Philip N. Howard, social media played a major role in political polarization in the United States, due to computational propaganda – \"the use of automation, algorithms, and big-data analytics to manipulate public life\"—such as the spread of fake news and conspiracy theories. The researchers highlighted the role of the Russian Internet Research Agency in attempts to undermine democracy in the US and exacerbate existing political divisions. The most prominent methods of misinformation were \"organic posting, not advertisements\", and influence operation activity increased after the 2016 and was not limited to the 2016 election.[77][78] Examples of efforts included \"campaigning for African American voters to boycott elections or follow the wrong voting procedures in 2016\", \"encouraging extreme right-wing voters to be more confrontational\", and \"spreading sensationalist, conspiratorial, and other forms of junk political news and misinformation to voters across the political spectrum.\"[77]\n\nThe political scientist Thomas Rid has said that the IRA was the least effective of all Russia's interference campaigns in the 2016 U.S. election, despite its outsized press coverage, and that it made no measurable impact on American voters.[79]\n\nA study published in Nature in 2023 found \"no evidence of a meaningful relationship between exposure to the Russian foreign influence campaign and changes in attitudes, polarization, or voting behavior\".[80]\n\nBased on the documents published by Anonymous International, Concord Management and Consulting was linked to the funding of several media outlets in Ukraine and Russia, including Kharkiv News Agency,[25] News of Neva, Newspaper About Newspapers, Business Dialog, and Journalist Truth.[24]\n\nThe Columbian Chemicals Plant explosion hoax of 11 September 2014, which claimed an explosion had taken place at a chemical plant in Centerville, St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, has been attributed in June 2015, by The New York Times Magazine, as \"a highly coordinated disinformation campaign\" and that the \"virtual assault\" was the work of the Internet Research Agency.[81]\n\nThree months later, the same accounts posted false messages on Twitter about an Ebola outbreak in Atlanta under the keyword #EbolaInAtlanta, quickly relayed and picked up by users living in the city. A video was then posted on YouTube, showing a medical team treating an alleged Ebola victim at Atlanta Airport. On the same day, a different group launched a rumor on Twitter under the keyword #shockingmurderinatlanta, reporting the death of a disarmed black woman shot by police. Again, a blurry and poorly filmed video is broadcast to support the rumor.[82]\n\nBetween July 2014 and September 2017, the IRA used bots and trolls on Twitter to sow discord about the safety of vaccines.[83][84] The campaign used sophisticated Twitter bots to amplify highly polarizing pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine messages containing the hashtag #VaccinateUS.[83] In November 2017, The Guardian cited a University of Edinburgh study which found that hundreds of IRA accounts were also trying to influence UK politics by tweeting about Brexit.[85]\n\nIn September 2017 Facebook said that ads had been \"geographically targeted\".[86][87] Facebook revealed that during the 2016 United States presidential election, IRA had purchased advertisements on the website for US$100,000, 25% of which were geographically targeted to the U.S.[88] Facebook's chief security officer said that the ads \"appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum\".[86][87]\n\nIn reviewing the ads buys, we have found approximately $100,000 in ad spending from June of 2015 to May of 2017 – associated with roughly 3,000 ads – that was connected to about 470 inauthentic accounts and Pages in violation of our policies. Our analysis suggests these accounts and Pages were affiliated with one another and likely operated out of Russia.\n\n— Facebook's chief security officer Alex Stamos, September 6, 2017, [89]\n\nAccording to a 17 October 2017 BuzzFeed News report, IRA recruited four African-American activists into taking real action via protests and self-defense training in what would seem to be a further attempt to exploit racial grievances.[90] According to reporting by Vanity Fair, up until that point, most known efforts had been aimed at \"weaponizing the far-right\".[91]\n\nA December 2018 report by The New York Times based on U.S. Senate data noted that the Internet Research Agency had created 81 Facebook pages around the time of the 2016 election. Of these, 30 pages specifically targeted African-Americans, attracting a total of 1.2 million followers. During the same time period, it had created 25 pages targeting right-wing audiences, and these had attracted a total of 1.4 million followers.[92] According to The New York Times,[92]\n\nWhile the right-wing pages promoted Mr. Trump’s candidacy, the left-wing pages scorned Mrs. Clinton while promoting Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. The voter suppression effort was focused particularly on Sanders supporters and African-Americans, urging them to shun Mrs. Clinton in the general election and either vote for Ms. Stein or stay home.\n\nOnce the election was concluded, the IRA posted messages mocking accusations of Russian interference, with one post reading: “You’ve lost and don’t know what to do? Just blame it on Russian hackers.”[92]\n\nOn 16 February 2018, the Internet Research Agency, along with 13 Russian individuals and two other Russian organizations, was indicted following an investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller with charges stemming from \"impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of government.\"[93]\n\nOn 23 March 2018, The Daily Beast revealed new details about IRA gathered from leaked internal documents,[94] which showed that IRA used Reddit and Tumblr as part of its influence campaign.[95] On the same day, Tumblr announced that they had banned 84 accounts linked to IRA, saying that they had spread misinformation through conventional postings rather than advertisements.[96][97]\n\nIn October 2018 the US Justice Department filed charges against Russian accountant Elena Khusyaynova for working with the IRA to influence not only the 2016 elections but also the upcoming 2018 midterm elections[98] As of February 2024, Khusyaynova has not been apprehended, according to the Rewards for Justice Program.[99]\n\nOn 4 April 2016, a rally in Buffalo, New York protested the death of India Cummings, a black woman who had recently died in police custody. IRA's \"Blacktivist\" Facebook account actively promoted the event and reached out directly to local activists on Facebook Messenger asking them to circulate petitions and print. \"Blacktivist\" supplied the petitions and poster artwork.[94]\n\nOn 16 April 2016, a rally protesting the death of Freddie Gray attracted large crowds in Baltimore. IRA's \"Blacktivist\" Facebook group promoted and organized the event, including reaching out to local activists.[101]\n\nOn 23 April 2016, a small group of white-power demonstrators held a rally they called \"Rock Stone Mountain\" at Stone Mountain Park near Stone Mountain, Georgia. They were confronted by a large group of anti-racist counterprotestors, and some violent clashes ensued. The protest was heavily promoted by IRA accounts on Tumblr, Twitter, and Facebook, and the IRA website blackmatters.com. The IRA used its Blacktivist Facebook account to reach out, to no avail, to activist and academic Barbara Williams Emerson, the daughter of Hosea Williams, to help promote the protests. Afterward, RT blamed anti-racists for violence and promoted two videos shot at the event.[94]\n\nOn 2 May 2016, a second rally was held in Buffalo, New York, protesting the death of India Cummings. Like the 4 April rally, the event was heavily promoted by IRA's \"Blacktivist\" Facebook account, including attempted outreach to local activists.[94]\n\nOn 21 May 2016, two competing rallies were held in Houston to alternately protest against and defend the recently opened Library of Islamic Knowledge at the Islamic Da'wah Center. The \"Stop Islamization of Texas\" rally was organized by the Facebook group \"Heart of Texas\". The posting for the event encouraged participants to bring guns. A spokesman for the group conversed with the Houston Press via email but declined to give a name. The other rally, \"Save Islamic Knowledge\", was organized by another Facebook group called \"United Muslims of America\" for the same time and location. Both Facebook groups were later revealed to be IRA accounts.[102][103]\n\nOn 25 May 2016, the Westboro Baptist Church held its annual protest of Lawrence High School graduation ceremonies in Lawrence, Kansas. The \"LGBT United\" Facebook group organized a counter protest to confront the Westboro Baptist Church protest, including by placing an ad on Facebook and contacting local people.
