        "text": "Way back around 1970, two things happened in movie land.\n\nFirst, the ratings system replaced the old Production Code, meaning movies could pack in plenty of sex, violence and other naughty stuff as long as a big R was attached to the poster.\n\nAnd second, the studios finally realized there was an untapped African-American audience, eager to see movies featuring people who looked like them. What’s more, plenty of white moviegoers wanted to see the same thing.\n\nThe result was the blaxploitation trend, a wave of films that only lasted a few years but had a far-reaching impact on the movie industry. What’s more, those movies are still fondly remembered by film geeks — like me — and still inspire modern movies — like this week’s pick, “Black Dynamite.”\n\n“Black Dynamite” was released in theaters last year, but if you didn’t know better, you’d swear it hit theaters back in 1972 — and not the most glamorous theaters, either. Director Scott Sanders and writers Byron Minns and Michael Jai White (who also stars) re-create the glory days of low-budget blaxploitation with such love and affection that the grungy charm is the film’s best asset. The plot is needlessly convoluted, the dialogue is way over-the-top and the production values are deliberately cheap, with awkward zooms, misplaced shots and boom mikes bonking characters in the head. Every cliche of the genre is jammed in there somewhere: a conspiracy created by “The Man,” black power revolutionaries, poorly staged fight scenes and the sad plight of innocent children. There are graveside vows, Vietnam flashbacks and a CIA connection. If it was part of a blaxploitation movie — any blaxploitation movie — it’s probably in here somewhere.\n\nTying it all together is White, whose small roles in “The Dark Knight” and other films gave no hint of the man’s talent. He’s dead-on perfect here, playing a smoother-than-smooth soul brother trying to find the men who killed his own brother. Jai straddles the line between cool and comedic perfectly, making his character both right­eous and ridiculous. You can’t help but laugh at him, but you wind up rooting for him, too.\n\nWill Pfeifer writes about DVDs for the Register Star on Saturdays. Contact him at wpfeifer@rrstar.com or 815-987-1244.

It features some great vintage New York locations and an amazing soundtrack by Curtis Mayfield.\n\n“Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song” (1971) Melvin Van Peebles wrote, directed and starred in this low-budget time bomb about a black man who refuses to surrender to the white world. Crude but powerful, it was hyped as being “rated X by an all-white jury!”\n\n“Coffy” (1973) Pam Grier stars in this wild revenge tale about a woman who gets revenge on everyone who ever wronged her, and a few people who arguably didn’t. Grier brings glamour and star-power to the role, inspiring her casting — 23 years later — in Quentin Tarantino’s “Jackie Brown.”\n\n“Blacula” (1972) Blaxploitation movies weren’t just violent crime dramas. This horror film about a smooth vampire is one of many horror movies of the era. Trivia note: William Marshall, who stars as the count, later played King of Cartoons on Pee Wee Herman’s TV show.\n\nFIRE AT WILL\n\nReaders to the rescue\n\nThe readers really came through with last week’s question, when Angela described a movie she remembered about a quarry on an Indian burial ground, a rusty crane and a spirit with a name like “Donkeshin.” Nick Hengeveld, Aaron Roush, Christina Nagle, Edmund Hee all wrote in to tell me the movie in question is a 1986 Australian film called “The Quest” (in America) and “Frog Dreaming” (in its native land). It was released on VHS but not DVD.\n\nI’m still looking for an answer to Kathy Holz’s question about a movie with a statue that says “I’m Mickey... I’m Mickey.” Anyone recognize this mysterious movie?\n\nMake room in your collection\n\nSome DVDs out Tuesday:\n\n“Capitalism: A Love Story”: Michael Moore’s latest documentary focuses on the financial mess America is in. It would’ve been nice if this movie was no longer relevant, but it still seems pretty timely.\n\n“Old Dogs”: This comedy about two morons (John Travolta and Robin Williams) put in charge of twins was one of the worst-reviewed movies in recent memory. Rent it at your own risk.\n\n“Planet 51”: In a twist on the alien invader story, an astronaut lands on another planet only to find a society that’s terrified of him. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is the voice of the astronaut.\n\n“Precious”: Nominated for multiple Oscars, this troubling drama about a young woman (Best Actress nominee Gabourey Sidibe) and her monstrous mom (Supporting Actress nominee Mo’Nique) arrives on DVD two days after Oscar night.\n\n“Tapeheads”: Long before they were big movie stars, John Cusack and Tim Robbins starred in this cult comedy about a couple of would-be video producers. The hip-hop commercial for Roscoe’s Chicken and Waffles alone is worth the price of a rental.\n\nAnd CDs:\n\nJimi Hendrix, “Valleys of Neptune”: It’s a good bet that any album by the late Jimi Hendrix will be among the best discs to hit stores this week.\n\nViolent Soho, “Violent Soho”: Every week, someone takes the easy way out in naming their CD. Every single week.\n\nThe Besnard Lakes, “The Besnard Lakes are the Roaring Night”: So which one is it? Are you the Besnard Lakes, or are you The Roaring Night? You can’t have it both ways.\n\nJoan Jett and the Blackhearts, “Greatest Hits”: This is probably a loose tie-in to the movie about the Runaways (Jett’s first band), but she had some pretty good songs with the Blackhearts, too.\n\nBee Gees, “Mythology”: You know, they did more than just record that “Saturday Night Fever” soundtrack. A lot more, in fact.\n\nThe Chieftains and Ry Cooder, “San Patricio”: Irish musicians The Chieftains and Grammy winner Cooder do their bit for global unity with this CD that mixes Irish and Mexican sounds.\n\nSources: dvdtalk.com, tophitsonline.com"
