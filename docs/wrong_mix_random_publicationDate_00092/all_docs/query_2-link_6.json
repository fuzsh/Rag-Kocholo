        "text": "As a former print magazine editor, I will always take a beat to admire clever cover designs. It's especially hard to strike the right tone between playful and tasteful (there are some Bad Covers out there, folks!) but TIME managed to strike that balance perfectly here, even playing off a previous cover they had run following the debate.\n\n#ThrowbackThursday to one of my first freelance articles: an essay for BDG about the Crazy Rich Asians movie (at the time just about to premiere in theaters!) and the social significance of portraying Asian characters as multidimensional people‚Äîrather than as flattened stereotypes‚Äîin US film. You can read the full article on Bustle's website ‚û°Ô∏è https://lnkd.in/emQxPej I'd love the opportunity to write more culture and entertainment pieces. Any editors looking to work with a reliable, communicative freelancer with strong writing skills, feel free to reach out at natashapishak[at]gmail[dot]com!\n\nWhile I enjoy working with independent clients, I'm happy to help fellow writers who need support finessing story pitches! Interested? üëÄ Details about my pitch workshop and how to sign up here https://lnkd.in/eye8naQA PS. A special rate is available for students (you don't have to be a journalism major!). Email me for more info ‚ö° #freelancewriter #pitchcall #pitches #journalismjobs\n\nThis #AAPIHeritageMonth, I'm happy to share a project that I've had the pleasure to work on as a regular contributor. City & State NY's 2024 Asian 100 Power List highlights the Asian Americans and Asian immigrants who are the powerbrokers and changemakers that make New York what it is üóΩüöïüåÜ When I first worked with CSNY on their inaugural Asian 100 Power List in 2020, I knew it was important to emphasize an often-forgotten fact: that Asians are *not* a monolith. The Power List has since expanded and grown over the years but the original intent‚Äîcelebrating New York's Asian leaders and honoring the diversity *within* that group itself‚Äîhas remained intact. The individuals highlighted on this list are not just folks in academia and government, they are also LGBTQ advocates, labor leaders, politicos, and community caretakers. They also come from various backgrounds: they are Japanese, Filipino, Guyanese, Bengali, Cambodian, and more. You can view all of the honorees on this year's Asian 100 Power list here ‚û°Ô∏è https://lnkd.in/ekn66QTV #AsianAmerican #AAPI #diversity\n\nHey, folks! I'm excited to announce that starting next month (April) I'll be offering one-on-one pitching workshops for fellow journalists and writers! READ ON TO LEARN MORE üçµüïó In these 30-minute sessions, we'll discuss your draft pitch or story idea to get it in the best shape possible to submit to publications. If you're new to the industry (or perhaps just new to freelance pitching) this is a great opportunity to have an experienced freelancer with thousands of hours worth of pitching experience (mee!) read your pitch and give you professional advice on how to best mold your pitch or idea for a higher chance of acceptance by a publication. Since I began freelancing in 2018, I've gotten my pitches accepted by and have written for 20+ publications including Fast Company, Insider, VICE, and Harvard's Nieman Lab. Get more info and book a session here: https://lnkd.in/ecKc3Fu7 ‚úèÔ∏è If you're a student, I have some good news: I'm offering an exclusive discounted rate to students who book a session with me! Email me at natashapishak[at]gmail[dot]com to inquire about the special rate. #pitching #freelancer #freelancing #writersworkshop #freelancepitch #freelancewriter #journalism\n\nI love the tenacity of youth advocates! üìö I had the pleasure of speaking with the student group that spearheaded the Filipino Curriculum Project, which led to Hawai'i's adoption of a Filipino studies curriculum for its public schools, the first high school-level course of its kind approved by a U.S. state. Did you know Filipino/Filipino American students represent the largest ethnic group attending Hawai‚Äôi‚Äôs public schools, yet most of these students did not have the option of learning about the rich history of their heritage? üí° #RepresentationMatters Read what went into making the curriculum a reality on Teen Vogue https://lnkd.in/ecKddgSV #asianamerican #education #youthadvocacy #educationpolicy\n\nHello, network! üôãüèª I'm a freelance journalist open to non-editorial work (proofreading, fact-checking, research, brand or marketing writing). I'm especially keen to work with educational institutions and nonprofit groups which I've done before. Past editors and clients have told me (unsolicited!) that I am very organized, communicative, and turn in clean, high-quality work. If you or a colleague are looking for someone to work with on a freelance or part-time basis, please don't hesitate to reach out üìß #freelancewriters #proofreader #factchecker #researcher #contentwriters #editors"
