        "text": "Thanks to streaming platforms like Spotify and Soundcloud, as well as social networks like TikTok and Instagram, phonk music is on the rise. Are you a phonk artist and want to grow your audience? We’ve got some tips for you. If you are a curious music lover and don’t know what phonk music is, we’ve got you covered! Here is everything you need to know about phonk music, from its origins to today.\n\n1. What is phonk music?\n\nPhonk music is a genre that emerged in the early 1990s from the underground rap and hip hop scenes in the southern United States, particularly in Houston, Texas and Memphis, Tennessee. The genre takes inspiration from other subgenres such as chopped and screwed, Memphis rap, and trap music, as well as funk, soul, and jazz. Phonk music has recently had a resurgence in popularity thanks to TikTok and the drift community, a group of car enthusiasts who are passionate about drifting. Drift phonk music emerged over the past couple years as a subgenre of phonk music that accompanies lo-fi videos of drifting cars.\n\n2. What is the meaning of phonk?\n\nThe term “phonk” is derived from the word “funky” and refers to the genre’s heavy use of funk samples and grooves. Unlike funk music however, phonk music is characterized by its gritty, lo-fi sound, giving it a much darker vibe thank original funk music. There is often the use of cowbells, heavy bass, and distorted sounds drowned in reverb. Phonk music often features slowed-down or chopped-up samples, creating a hypnotic, nostalgic feel.\n\n3. How to make phonk music\n\nFirst of all, to make phonk music, you will need a computer and DAW (digital work station) to produce your track! The most popular DAWs that producers use for making music are Pro tools, FL Studio, Ableton, Cubase, and Logic Pro. It would be difficult (though quite funny and original) to make a phonk music track with a live band. Making phonk music involves a combination of sampling, chopping and screwing techniques, and other production methods to create a gritty, lo-fi sound that is characteristic of the genre. Here are some basic steps you can follow:\n\nFind funk and soul samples: The phonk genre heavily relies on samples and loops from funk and soul music, so start by finding and listening to tracks from artists such as James Brown, Parliament-Funkadelic, and Isaac Hayes. Look for tracks with groovy basslines, catchy melodies, and other elements that you can sample and incorporate into your own tracks.\n\nUse the chop and screw technique: Chopping and screwing involves slowing down and manipulating samples to create a hypnotic, lo-fi effect. Chop up your samples and adjust the tempo, pitch, and other parameters to create a unique phonk sound.\n\nAdd drums and emphasize the bass: Once you have your samples chopped and screwed, add drums and emphasize the bass. The phonk music genre often uses breakbeats and hard-hitting drums to create a driving, energetic sound. The bass is usually quite strong as well in phonk tracks.\n\nUse effects and processing: To achieve a gritty, lo-fi sound, use effects such as distortion, tape saturation, and reverb to add character and warmth to your instrumentals. You can also experiment with other processing techniques such as filtering, compression, and EQ to shape the sound and create a unique sonic signature.\n\nPerfect your track and release it: Make sure your track is high-quality and prepare to distribute it to music streaming services! We can’t emphasize enough the importance of getting your tracks on music sites like Spotify, Apple music, Deezer, Napster, Amazon music, and more. The days of downloading music are fading away. Streaming is how the majority of people consume music nowadays, so if you want to be heard, you have to be visible! Learn how to release music independently on music-streaming platforms here.\n\n4. What’s the difference between funk and phonk?\n\nThe first and most important difference between funk and phonk is that funk music came first! Funk originated in the 1960s and 1970s and is characterized by its groovy basslines, syncopated rhythms, and use of horns and other instruments. It often features lyrics that explore identity, social and political issues. Funk music has served as inspiration in the development of many other genres of music, including hip hop, R&B, rock, and of course, phonk.\n\nPhonk originated in the 1990s and used samples of funk tracks but is more similar to trap and hip-hop styles. Funk tends to have a more polished and refined sound, with live instrumentation and a focus on complex arrangements and virtuosity. Phonk, on the other hand, emphasizes the use of sampling and processing to create a raw, gritty, and often hypnotic sound.\n\n5. Phonk music artists examples\n\nWho are some phonk music artists to introduce you to the genre? Here is a good place to start, from original phonk pioneers to artists making phonk music tracks today:\n\nDJ Screw – A Houston-based DJ and producer who was influential in the creation of phonk music. He became popular in the 90s for his “Screw Tapes”, a series of mixtapes that featured slowed-down and chopped and screwed versions of popular rap and R&B tracks.\n\nThree 6 Mafia – A Memphis-based hip-hop group that were important in developing phonk music with their dark sound that blended gangsta rap and Southern hip hop. Lots of phonk artists today use samples of Three 6 Mafia in their tracks.\n\nDJ Smokey – A Memphis-based producer who is considered one of the pioneers of phonk music. His tracks often feature chopped and screwed samples and heavy basslines.\n\nSoudiere – A producer from France who has gained a following for his dark, hypnotic phonk tracks.
