He receives a Facebook friend request from \"God.\" Although he suspects it is a hoax, he nevertheless follows up on the first suggested friend and saves the man's life when he tries to commit suicide by jumping in front of a subway train. He meets his second suggested friend, Cara, an online writer with writer's block. When Miles's computer malfunctions at his home, Cara sees her long-missing mother in a picture of Miles with his family at the hospital. Miles convinces Cara to see her mother. When Cara finds out her mother has another daughter, she runs into the street in shock and is hit by a car. A doctor emerges from a taxi several cars back to save Cara's life; the doctor is the man Miles saved earlier in the subway.\n\n22\"The Good Samaritan\"Marcos SiegaSteven Lilien & Bryan WynbrandtOctober 7, 2018 ( )T40.101028.37[16]\n\nAs Miles prepares for his first national podcast about atheism, he gets another friend request from the God account that leads him to help a single mother connect with her autistic son. Cara gets closer to her estranged mother, while Ali convinces her father to support Miles and congratulate him on his podcast's success. Miles disagrees with his new producer, who wants a one-sided presentation about atheism. Miles instead wants his show to be more of an open conversation. Due to the change in tone, Miles's podcast loses over half its audience. Meanwhile, Rakesh is disappointed to see his new love interest Jaya on a date with another guy, but it turns out the date had been scheduled before Jaya met Rakesh, and she is only interested in dating him.\n\n33\"Heavenly Taco Truck\"Kenneth FinkRobert HullOctober 14, 2018 ( )T40.101037.90[17]\n\nThe God account sends Miles a place recommendation for a taco truck instead of a friend suggestion. While Miles is there, a boy steals his wallet. Miles and Cara hire Ray, an ex-police officer and private investigator, to find the boy. It turns out the boy, Isaac, is living on his own, with his mother absent, and that Ray's deceased wife was Isaac's social worker. Both Isaac and Ray are lost without her, and in the end Ray takes in Isaac as a foster child.\n\n44\"Error Code 1.61\"Marcos SiegaAllison MooreOctober 21, 2018 ( )T40.101048.86[18]\n\nMiles is excited that Rakesh is close to cracking the God account's firewall when all the computers at their work crash with an error code of 1.61, which is an approximation of the Fibonacci ratio. This leads Miles, Cara, Rakesh and Jaya to the Hayden Planetarium looking for answers. Miles and Cara find Fliss, a woman from a small town who is in New York looking for her lost love based on a list of locations he gave her when they were at camp together. Rakesh and Jaya find Beaker, a staff member at the Planetarium who is looking for a lost star using software that Rakesh recognizes as being associated with the God account. It turns out that Beaker is Fliss's lost love. He's gay, so they won't be romantic, but Fliss decides she will move to New York anyway to restart her life and be Beaker's friend. At the same time, Arthur takes his damaged saxophone to a repair shop to fix and donate. It was damaged in the car accident that killed Miles's mother, and Arthur hasn't played since. Miles retrieves the repaired saxophone and he and Ali tell their father that their mother wouldn't want him to stop playing.\n\n55\"Unfriended\"Erin FeeleySafia M. DirieOctober 28, 2018 ( )T40.101056.94[19]\n\nThe God account sends Miles a friend recommendation for Rachel, but he decides to do nothing about it, and the God account disappears. Prodded by Rakesh and Cara, Miles investigates and learns that Rachel is an alcoholic artist whose sister died in a car accident they were in several weeks earlier. They were fighting at the time, and Rachel believes nothing can fix the fact that her sister hated her at the moment of her death. Miles finds the man credited with pulling Rachel from the car before it exploded, and learns that the man was just a bystander; in fact, Rachel's sister pulled her from the car, and died going back for her cell phone to call 911. Miles tells Rachel that her sister obviously loved her, and Rachel finds peace and strives to become sober. Meanwhile, Rakesh finds out Jaya has a medical fellowship that will take her away from New York for up to a year. He reacts badly at first, but on Ali's advice, throws Jaya a congratulations party and tells her he is happy for her. After talking with his father, Miles comes to terms with the idea that he might have a calling to do good in the world, and the God account reappears. He sends it a friend request, and it accepts.\n\n66\"A House Divided\"Louis MilitoStory by : Robert Hill\n\nTeleplay by : Steven Lilien & Bryan WynbrandtNovember 4, 2018 ( )T40.101067.40[20]\n\nAs he is hailing a cab, Miles gets a friend suggestion for Hasan, who turns out to be the cab driver. Later, Miles learns that Hasan's daughter Tara has fallen in love with David, a devout Jew she is planning to marry without Hasan's (or David's parents) knowledge or consent. Hasan confronts Tara and David (and Miles) at the courthouse just before their marriage. Miles tries to reason with Hasan, but fails, and Tara reluctantly leaves with her father. At a loss, Miles consults with his father, who explains how a child losing faith can feel to a parent like losing them altogether. Meanwhile, Rakesh breaks the God account's encryption with Cara's help, and they learn about a particular train leaving Grand Central Station later that night. Hasan confronts Miles at his uncle's 25th wedding anniversary party because Tara has run away. Miles realizes that the train isn't the location of whoever is behind the God account, but of David and Tara.

At the end, Miles learns that Hasan was the driver of the cab the doctor got out of to save Cara's life in episode 1.\n\n77\"The Prodigal Son\"Marcos SiegaCarmen Pilar GoldenNovember 11, 2018 ( )T40.101077.87[21]\n\nMiles is forced to face uncomfortable truths about his family when the \"God\" account points him towards his Uncle Terrance.

Miles must find out what happened to the man behind the legend with the help of a private investigator, hired by the legend's last opponent before he vanished, who Miles had helped out in a previous episode.

While Miles hasn't had any suggestions from the God account in weeks, Joy gets one for a soldier on leave who wants to return to Iraq despite having a heart condition that could kill him. In Paris, Simon helps Cara track down Annie, the woman who inspired her to be a journalist and whose friend suggestion five years ago helped Cara find her mom. But Cara discovers Annie blames Simon for ruining her career, and also learns Annie never sent her the friend suggestion. Meanwhile, Arthur is reluctant to leave the home he's known for years as Trish looks for a new place to live after they get married.\n\n222\"The Lady\"Darren GrantRobert HullOctober 6, 2019 ( )T40.102026.41[36]\n\nJoy gets another friend suggestion, this time for self-help guru Teddy Preston, whose off-stage life is quite different from the positive image he pushes in his seminars. In Paris, Simon and Annie help Cara investigate the Facebook hack that led her to reconnect with her mother. Meanwhile, Miles finally gets his own message from the God account to \"follow the lady, follow your path\". Deducing it's the Statue of Liberty, he goes there but finds nothing. He gets a call from Cara, who is standing near a replica statue in Paris. The two determine that the God account wants Miles to be in Paris. Elsewhere, Arthur is hurt when Ali tells him she is leaving Harlem Episcopal and has applied for membership at an LGBTQ-inclusive church.\n\n233\"From Paris with Love\"Marcos SiegaSafia M. DirieOctober 13, 2019 ( )T40.102036.89[37]\n\nMiles is reunited with Cara in Paris, and the two continue to investigate the \"follow the lady, follow your path\" clue. This leaves Joy to work her first God account case without Miles' help, though she does get assistance from Rakesh. The two investigate Sarah, a parking enforcement officer who gave Joy a ticket. Together, they help Sarah find forgiveness when she blames herself for her gay brother being disowned by their parents. The brother now suffers from early-onset dementia. Miles and Cara find a painting in The Louvre by Audrey Grenelle that features a binary code pattern, which Miles plans to have Rakesh interpret when they return to New York.

Her daughter, who plays on Cara's half-sister's soccer team, has been acting out because she has been unable to find out where she came from. The others urge caution and Joy gives her daughter some information about their family and its Hawaiian ancestry, without revealing that she is her mother. Joy then returns to Chicago for her disbarment hearing. Cara agrees to stay with her mother and returns to work at the magazine as a junior writer. Miles and Cara just miss Audrey Grenelle at an art gallery.\n\n255\"The Greater Good\"Marcos SiegaLogan SlakterOctober 27, 2019 ( )T40.102056.21[39]\n\nMiles gets a friend suggestion for Bishop Thompson's daughter Claire.

He resign as Bishop, when his actions are revealed, to help Claire manage the clinic. Jaya's parents think that she and Rakesh should get married and provide them with some grandchildren, now that he has been promoted to head of R&D.

Upon discovering that her assailant has been paroled, Miles, Cara and her young son rush stop her from fighting him. Elena confesses that she took up fighting because she was scared and has been neglecting her son. Cara writes an article about Elena but it fails to generate many hits. Trish is upset and leaves town when Arthur informs her that he has accepted the job as Bishop without talking with her. Ray and Sarah, the parking officer, track down Audrey Grenelle, the artist, through her parking tickets and Miles informs her that the code in her painting was meant for him.\n\n277\"Instant Karma\"Marcos SiegaSteve HarperNovember 10, 2019 ( )T40.102076.10[41]\n\nMiles helps a lawyer whose firm, which he runs with his brother, is on the brink of folding. The lawyer is convinced he's been affected by bad karma ever since he found a $1 million lottery ticket and made plans to cash it himself rather than find the ticket's owner. The team also continues their attempts to decode Audrey Grenelle's painting, and eventually do so. The painting reveals a house in New Jersey which is the first place the God account ever sent Miles and Cara. Elsewhere, Arthur ruminates over Trish.\n\n288\"The Last Grenelle\"Lionel ColemanCarmen Pilar GoldenNovember 17, 2019 ( )T40.102087.15[42]\n\nMiles and Cara find the house in New Jersey to be occupied by a new owner, Gideon, who knows all about the God account because he received friend requests from it long before Miles. Insisting that it's really God behind the account, Gideon said he was forced to choose between the account and starting a life with the woman he loves. He chose the latter, leaving one friend request five years ago that he never followed up on: Audrey Grenelle. Miles and Cara help Gideon close the book on his final friend request, while helping Audrey finally get past the family incident that changed her life. After a successful resolution, Gideon hints that Miles may be \"the prophet\" that the God account seeks, and if so, may be faced with a choice: continue his work with the account or have a life with Cara. Meanwhile, Arthur and Rakesh both come to a crossroads in their respective relationships.\n\n299\"Prophet & Loss\"Barbara BrownRobert HullNovember 24, 2019 ( )T40.102095.86[43]\n\nMiles' next friend suggestion is Cara's stepfather, Paul Levine, whom he learns is on the brink of financial ruin with his investment company. To recover his clients' losses, Paul has resorted to insider trading and is seen consulting with the target of a story that Cara is working with her partner. Despite Cara asking him to stay out of it, Miles implores Paul to do the right thing. After almost fleeing to Canada, Paul instead takes a plea deal that will result in him spending one to two years in prison. Cara accuses Miles of putting the God account before her, much like Gideon suggested might happen. Elsewhere, Arthur finds his new agenda being blocked by Reverend Elias, a very conservative member of his board who cites Arthur's children and out-of-wedlock relationship with Trish as reasons he should step down. Surprisingly, it's Trish who gets Arthur to stand up for what he believes is best for the church. Also, Rakesh fails to win his supervisor's approval on a major project at work, and he seeks advice from Ali.\n\n3010\"High Anxiety\"Charissa SanjarernsuithikulSteven Lilien & Bryan WynbrandtDecember 8, 2019 ( )T40.102106.81[44]\n\nMiles and Rakesh help a new friend suggestion, a high-rise window washer named Miguel, who has sabotaged his platform in hopes that his \"accidental\" death will provide enough insurance money to continue the expensive care for his daughter Ava until she is able to get a new kidney. Despite wanting to walk away from the God account, Cara agrees to help when she learns a life is in danger, and she retrieves Miguel's wife to help talk him down. Miles insists that between his podcast and Cara's journalism outlets, they can raise the money to help Ava. However, Ava takes a turn for the worse and will need a kidney almost immediately, forcing Miles to come up with a creative solution. Miles had told Cara that Miguel will be his last friend suggestion, as he wants to choose her over the account. Seeing how Miles just effectively saved two lives, Cara insists she could never live with the thought that she prevented Miles from doing more good work, and she ends their relationship. Elsewhere, Arthur makes good on his promise to balance church duties with spending time with Trish, causing Trish to say she wants to marry him as soon as possible. Also, Joy returns to New York for a work assignment, and tells Miles and Rakesh she has some insight on the source of the God account.\n\n3111\"A New Hope\"Marcos SiegaSafia M. DirieJanuary 5, 2020 ( )T40.102115.38[45]\n\nThrough her legal work, Joy reveals she discovered that many of the God account friend suggestions are clients of the same insurance company: New York Sun. Rakesh does some hacking and sees that everyone the group has helped was a client. He also discovers a back door and he and Miles locate the man hacking into the insurance company client profiles. The hacker reveals he was hired by a man named Alphonse Jeffries to create the back door. While Rakesh tracks down that lead, Miles and Joy help an elderly holocaust survivor named Abe (Judd Hirsch), who noticed his father's gold watch on a jewelry auction site and hopes it can lead him to answers about his long-lost sister, Rose. Soon after a successful resolution of that case, Miles learns that Alphonse and Arthur served in Vietnam together and, in fact, Arthur saved Alphonse's life. Having revealed that he and Trish are getting married that weekend, Arthur says he invited Alphonse to the wedding. Now convinced that Alphonse is the source of the God account, Miles tries to win back Cara. Cara agrees that their love is worth any risk, but she is also hiding a secret: as Cara was visiting the hospital that her mother was applying to she saw Ali at the hospital coming out of the Oncology department, and Ali revealed she was not ok.\n\n3212\"BFF\"Annabelle FrostSteven Lilien & Bryan WynbrandtJanuary 12, 2020 ( )T40.102126.19[46]\n\nWhile preparing to confront Alphonse Jeffries at Arthur's wedding, Miles receives a friend suggestion that turns out to be Trish's daughter, Julia (Amber Stevens West). Julia and her husband, whom she has known since they were childhood best friends, are now going through a divorce. Miles learns that Julia is also hiding a big secret from her estranged husband. Rakesh and Joy are finally able to corner Jeffries, and he agrees to lunch with them. When Jeffries is a no-show for lunch, Miles tracks him down. He tells Jeffries he knows he's behind the God account, but Jeffries denies it. Miles then asks Jeffries why he would hire a hacker to create a back door for the New York Sun client information, and Jeffries replies he didn't hire anyone. Miles, Rakesh and Joy then race to the apartment where they previously met the hacker, and find it completely cleaned out except for one item: a Queen of Hearts playing card. Meanwhile, Ali learns that the lump in her breast tested positive for cancer.\n\n3313\"The Princess and the Hacker\"Marcos SiegaKristi KorzecFebruary 16, 2020 ( )T40.102135.42[47]\n\nRakesh gives Cara and Miles a demonstration of his new soulmate algorithm, and is shocked when it matches him with a princess from a central African country who also comes up as Miles' friend suggestion. The princess, Lulu, is currently attending Columbia University, but speaks about her father, King Omari, coming to America to pronounce her as the first-ever female leader of their country. However, Lulu is crossed up when her father instead proclaims he'll be announcing Lulu's brother Zian as his successor. After learning that Omari is only trying to protect Lulu from the inevitable backlash in their country, Miles and the group convince the king that Lulu's leadership is worth the risk. Meanwhile, Ali upsets her father by proclaiming she wants to delay cancer treatment until after she gets her eggs frozen, knowing that chemotherapy can cause women to be infertile. In a conversation with Trish, Ali becomes convinced that the possibility of having a child will give her a reason to fight.\n\n3414\"Raspberry Pie\"Joe MortonLogan SlakterFebruary 23, 2020 ( )T40.102145.95[48]\n\nMiles receives a friend suggestion for himself, but Rakesh discovers it's actually for a cloned account. They notice that a phony Save the Whales fundraiser is on the cloned account, and has already received donations. Rakesh locates the hacker, a 16-year-old coding whiz named Zack (Chosen Jacobs) who is working as an intern at the Department of Defense. They learn Zach is raising money to purchase a Raspberry Pi device, which he plans to use to hack into the DoD servers and get the real story about his mother, a soldier who was killed in Afghanistan. Elsewhere, Cara and her former work partner, Adam, follow up on a lead about the hacker who left the queen of hearts card, discovering it's actually a key card for an exclusive underground poker game. Also, Ali meets a woman named Emily (Kara Royster) in the fertility clinic waiting room. Emily later asks Ali out on a date, but Ali refuses because she doesn't want to be a burden with her chemo treatments on the horizon.\n\n3515\"The Last Little Thing\"Marcos SiegaRobert HullMarch 1, 2020 ( )T40.102156.01[49]\n\nMiles' next friend suggestion is Anna, a terminally ill patient whose aggressive cancer has led her to live out her remaining days to the fullest instead of seeking further treatment. Miles believes he's been charged with helping Anna return to treatment, but after discovering Anna was one of Arthur's parishioners who had a crisis of faith two years earlier, Miles realizes he's supposed to help Anna regain her faith before she passes away. Meanwhile, Cara and Rakesh follow up on hacker Aaron Lee's underground poker game and learn they can obtain a birth certificate that Aaron mentioned, but they need Ray Nicollette's help to give the certificate's owner what he wants in exchange. The birth certificate is for a Corey Smith, whose father is listed as Alphonse Jeffries. Also, Ali begins her chemotherapy.\n\n3616\"The Atheist Papers\"Erin RichardsJessica GrangerMarch 8, 2020 ( )T40.102165.90[50]\n\nMiles gets a chance to meet Daryl Watkins (Kevin Carroll), a renowned author on atheism whom Miles says had a profound effect on him many years ago, but Miles is hurt when Watkins criticizes his podcast. Miles immediately gets Watkins as his next friend suggestion, later finding out that Watkins has been considering the possibility that God exists after falling in love with a female pastor. Meanwhile, the group follows up on the Corey Smith lead, whom Rakesh says has had no social media presence or even credit card activity for ten years. They locate his mother, Marsha (Tonya Pinkins), who has nothing nice to say about Corey's absentee father, Alphonse Jeffries. She does say that Corey was in the military for many years before being discharged ten years ago. Rakesh learns from his new intern Zack that Corey received a D-13 discharge, which means he was moved to some covert operation at the Department of Defense. This leads the group to consider that the God account may be a DoD project. Also, Ali collapses during her first date with Emily and is rushed to the hospital. Doctors think it was only exhaustion from her chemo treatments.\n\n3717\"Harlem Cinema House\"Marcos SiegaPilar Golden & Steve HarperMarch 15, 2020 ( )T40.102175.97[51]\n\nAfter Miles proposes to take Ali to a movie at the historic Harlem Cinema House, the God Account likes The Maltese Falcon. While at the theater, Miles gets friend suggestions for the three remaining employees: owner Mr. Johnson, counter clerk Haley, and projectionist Leo. Mr. Johnson says that they are closing the cinema for good in two days. He notes that an antique ruby ring he gave his late wife would provide enough money to save the cinema, but it was stolen over a year ago. After noting that Mr. Johnson turned her life around by hiring her when no one else would, Haley reveals she stole the ring from Mr. Johnson's house before she knew who he was. Her attempt to retrieve it from her former fence fails.
