Landlocked in the heart of Africa, the Central African Republic is a sparsely populated country with an area of 623,000 km2. It is one of the poorest and most fragile countries in the world despite its abundant natural resources (470 mineral occurrences, with oil, gold and diamonds having the greatest potential). For over two decades now, the Central African Republic has been mired in crises, the most serious of which was the seizure of power by Seleka in 2013. The latest crisis was triggered by a coalition of rebels in December 2020.

With a population of about 6,100,000, the Central African Republic ranks at the bottom of the human capital and development indices (188th out of 191 countries in 2022). Its institutions are weak, its citizens have limited access to basic services, infrastructure is woefully inadequate, gender-based violence (GBV) is widespread and the social fabric has been eroded. Despite its significant agricultural potential and vast forests, the population is yet to share in the associated benefits.

The Central African Republic is a fragile country. The drivers of fragility include a lack of social cohesion, the concentration of political power, social and regional disparities, the capture and mismanagement of natural resources by the elite and persistent insecurity fueled by a regional system of conflicts.

With more than 15,000 personnel, the UN peacekeeping force MINUSCA has been in the Central African Republic since September 15. Since the departure of French troops in 2016, the country has also been receiving bilateral military support from Russia and Rwanda.

The Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation (APPR-RCA), signed on February 6, 2019 with 14 armed groups, continues to provide a roadmap to long-term peace and stability, even after armed groups linked to the CPC left the agreement in December 2020.

Political Context

The International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) has made headway in preparing for the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and repatriation (DDRR) of CPC combatants. The dissolution in December 2022 of four armed groups and the relocation in early March 2023 of François Bozizé, a former president and Head of the CPC, is expected to contribute to peace and stability. Progress in the dialogue with the remaining armed groups is key to moving forward on the program for disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and repatriation. The restoration of the State’s presence is a prerequisite for the lasting stabilization of conflict-affected areas. However, these gains remain fragile as armed groups continue to target the population.

The political climate remains polarized and tensions with the international community persist, owing to geopolitical developments. The Constitutional Court has paved the way for a constitutional referendum. In the meantime, local elections are scheduled to be held this year, for the first time since the 1980s. Members of the opposition, particularly those who do not support the constitutional referendum, and a number of civil society actors frequently accuse pro-government youth groups of intimidation. In addition, Wagner Group operations in support of the government have heightened tensions between the government and some of the country’s traditional partners.

Economic Overview

After two consecutive years of virtual stagnation, economic activity is estimated to have ground to a complete halt in 2022, owing to major flooding and fuel shortages. Real GDP growth is estimated at 0.0% in 2022, down from 1.0% in 2021. With per capita GDP growth declining by 2.2% in 2021, it is estimated that more than 3.5 million persons are expected to continue living in extreme poverty between 2023 and 2025.

Provided that domestic fuel supplies improve and security gains continue, real GDP growth is projected at 3.0% in 2023, before reaching 3.8% on average over the period 2024–2025.

The medium-term outlook is subject to significant internal and external risks. Internal risks include a reversal in security gains and a deterioration in food security triggered by food price pressures and climate shocks (floods). The main external risk is the decline in international timber prices, which could affect forestry sector activity, significantly reduce export earnings and delay prospects for economic recovery.

Social Context and Development Challenges

The Central African Republic remains one of the poorest countries in the world and is grappling with numerous human capital challenges. The latest estimates, which date from 2020, show that roughly 71% of the population is living below the international poverty line ($1.90 per day, in terms of PPP).

The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate. The UN Humanitarian Coordinator estimates that 56% of the population will need humanitarian assistance and protection in 2023, a 10% increase over 2022.

Maternal mortality is among the world’s highest (882 per 100,000 live births), while the under-five child mortality rate is the sixth highest in the world (116 out of every 1,000 children) (UNICEF, 2020). The Central African Republic also has one of the highest fertility rates in the world, with six births per woman. The average life expectancy for both men and women is 53 years.

The Central African Republic has some of the lowest education indicators. The expected length of schooling is 5.3 years for boys compared to 3.8 years for girls. The quality of primary education is low and few girls have access to secondary education.

The country has some of the largest gender gaps in the world, ranking 188th out of 191 countries in terms of gender equality. These gender gaps contribute to high rates of GBV that are a major obstacle to the full participation of women in social and economic life. Their empowerment is key to the country’s development. Although the Central African Republic has committed to complying with the gender equality provisions in the law, implementation remains weak, thereby depriving women and girls of protection. Violence against women is widespread; 11,000 incidents are reported each year (2016), and 74% involve children.

Below are some of the results by area of activity:

Governance

The Emergency Public Services Response Project has helped restore the government payroll (more than 17,000 civil servants have benefited) and operational financial management systems:

The time between scheduled and actual pay days was reduced from 30 hours to 13 hours (target of 10 hours);

In 2015, the percentage of customs personnel who resumed work increased from 10% to 86%, while the percentage for teachers and health workers who resumed work in districts with improved security increased from 0% to 89%.

Security, reestablishment of the administration and infrastructure

The Londo project aims to build peace and foster social cohesion and economic activity through labor-intensive public works for the construction/rehabilitation of small-scale socioeconomic infrastructure. Some of the achievements are as follows:

In 71 districts across the country, more than 55,000 vulnerable individuals (39% of whom were women) secured temporary employment on a site;

More than 3,153 km of rural roads were rehabilitated, creating access to markets and essential services;

More than 20 small-scale socioeconomic infrastructures were constructed or rehabilitated.

Under the Service Delivery and Support to Communities Affected by Displacement Project (PACAD):

48,000 vulnerable households affected by displacement, including about 16,000 in the insecure areas of Bambari, Bangassou, Kaga-Bandoro and Paoua, received eight cash transfer payments of CFAF 25,000 per quarter between 2017 and 2021. Then 33,000 vulnerable households affected by displacement, flooding and COVID-19 in the areas of Bangui, Bria and Bouar received five of the eight quarterly payments of CFAF 25,000. This has injected nearly CFAF 7,325,000,000 ($12,279,000) into the local economy.

These regular payments allow households to invest in consumption, rebuild their homes, invest in their families’ health and send their children to school.

In addition to cash transfers, households are benefiting from support activities conducted weekly by community workers in each neighborhood and village.

Improved connectivity

With its labor-intensive public works, the Local Connectivity Emergency Project and the Rural Connectivity Project have:

provided temporary jobs to 10,037 beneficiaries, 27% of whom are women, to construct 32,000 meters of ditches and maintain 333 kilometers of road;

built 81 engineering structures, and rehabilitated 12 bridges, 12 storm barriers and 63 socioeconomic infrastructures;

established 13 maintenance units along the Kaga Bandoro-Ndélé road;

rehabilitated and reequipped two local offices of the Ministry of Public Works and Road Maintenance;

constructed the Bamingui bridge (45-meter span);

rehabilitated 614 kilometers of rural roads in the northwest and northeast;

created nearly 58,300 person-days of employment.

Under the Emergency Infrastructure and Connectivity Restoration Project:

Approximately 2,025 kilometers of rural roads will be rehabilitated;

Nearly 150,000 person-days of work will be created through Labor-Intensive Public Works (LIPW).

Strengthening of human capital

Thanks to the Health System Support Project:

About 1,292,462 persons received free medical care;

302,585 pregnant women had four prenatal care visits;

184,791 births were attended by skilled health personnel;

Five district hospitals have an integrated GBV service (with medical, psychosocial and socioeconomic support) for more than 2,982 survivors;

Fifty-five data managers were recruited and deployed in 35 health districts to support the implementation of the national health information system;

Support was provided for the implementation of the national COVID-19 vaccine rollout plan with the purchase of two million doses of J&J vaccines as well as for the national immunization system.
