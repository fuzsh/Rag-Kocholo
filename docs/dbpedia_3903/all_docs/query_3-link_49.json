        "text": "After winning the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2023, Anatomy of a Fall is a clear favourite for the Golden Globes and Oscars of 2024.\n\nThis thriller captivated audiences upon release. A film with a gripping storyline that has won over audiences and critics alike, to the point where it is now in the running for the Golden Globes. Anatomy of a Fall follows the turbulent lives of Sandra, a German writer, and Samuel, her French husband, who live together with their visually impaired 11-year-old son Daniel in a small isolated town in the Alps. When Samuel is found dead, the police starts treating the case as a suspected homicide and Sandra becomes the prime suspect. A year later, Daniel attends his mother’s trial, which has become a breakdown of the couple’s life.\n\nDiscover the natural environment of Savoie\n\nTo pick her set location and find the family chalet where the dramatic plot unfolds, director Justine Triet explored the French Alps. And it was more specifically in Savoie that she found the ideal place to shoot the first scenes of Anatomy of a Fall.\n\nWhile the village of Villarembert is a staple among ski fans, it became the filming location for an award-winning film at the Cannes Film Festival. During the winter of 2022, the Fjällstuga chalet became home to Sarah, Vincent and Daniel. Tucked away in the hamlet of Les Crevasses, it perfectly matched the director’s vision. “They were looking for a house that was partly isolated, partly undergoing work and with a front high enough that a character could kill themself by falling,” recalls Pascaline, the chalet’s owner, in an interview with Mon Séjour en Montagne.\n\nAnd this is how this 250 m² chalet came to house the 45-strong film crew during the two months of principal photography in Savoie. For the purposes of the film, the building was somewhat modified, but don’t fret, the team made sure to leave no trace of the shoot once they were done.\n\nSavoie, a “cold and raw” natural environment\n\nAnd regarding the choice of the Savoie mountains to be the backdrop for this plot, Justine Triet says it best. “I wanted cold, raw light, powerful exteriors contrasting with the interiors. And the curves of the mountain in the background, where you keep going up and down to try and understand this fall,” she confided in an interview with France3.\n\nAnd the director was correct in her assessment. Savoie is a jewel of the French Alps, where the grandiose natural environment offers an unforgettable experience for lovers of altitude and winter sports. From its majestic mountains to its crystal-clear lakes and picturesque villages, this region, renowned for its natural beauty, attracts nature lovers every year."
