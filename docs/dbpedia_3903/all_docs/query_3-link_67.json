        "text": "Download the full history timeline\n\nSelf-reliance. Resilience. Tireless optimism. These are the traits of our customers. We built The Home Depot for them, to provide them with the products, services and knowledge they need to create the homes of their dreams. Decades later, they’re still the No. 1 reason we wear the orange apron. Our story, now almost 40 years in the making, is also theirs.\n\nBernie Marcus and Arthur Blank dreamed up The Home Depot from a coffee shop in Los Angeles in 1978. Avid DIYers, they envisioned a superstore that would offer a huge variety of merchandise at great prices and with a highly trained staff. Employees would not only be able to sell, but they would also be able to walk customers at every skill level through most any home repair or improvement.\n\nWith help from investment banker Ken Langone and merchandising guru Pat Farrah, Marcus and Blank opened the first two Home Depot stores in Atlanta the following year. The 60,000-square-foot warehouses dwarfed the competition with more items than any other hardware store. But the heart of Home Depot was the expertly trained floor associates who could teach customers how to handle a power tool, change a fill valve or lay tile. It wasn’t enough to sell or even tell — associates also had to be able to show. Soon, The Home Depot began offering DIY clinics, customer workshops and one-on-one sessions with customers."
