        "text": "Book: West With Giraffes\n\nAuthor: Lynda Rutledge\n\nEdition: Hardcover, Lake Union Publishing\n\nWest With Giraffes, while an historical novel, reads as a beautiful memoir of one brief and eventful journey. As a reader I felt as if I were sitting with Woody, the Old Man, Red, Wild Girl and Wild Boy as they traveled west, feeling the giraffes snuffling, hearing their thrumming, watching them reach out for an onion. The author added a bit of suspense that could have been more well-thought out and sure, a 105-year old man couldn’t have reasonably written, let alone recalled, the events in the novel. I felt it worthwhile to let that go and just enjoy the ride as I was effortlessly transported on a cross-country drive in the autumn of 1938.\n\nIf you’re looking for a good read where you don’t need to think too much, except maybe to daydream about your own cross-country adventure, this novel is an excellent choice.\n\nNote that this guide, like all of the guides, may contain spoilers. I recommend reading the book before the guide.\n\nInternet Resources\n\nPhotos\n\nI highly recommend complementing the book with photos and/or audio. There are many photos online of this time in history, below are just a few.\n\nRutledge didn’t include photos of the actual trip with her novel, perhaps due to the expense of copyrights, perhaps because she wanted to keep it as Woody’s story. Regardless, it is worth checking out some of the photos that are online as they emphasize the absurdity of transporting two very tall giraffes in a truck across the United States. There are several viewable at Wisconsinhistory.org, such as this one of a woman on the running board of the truck feeding a giraffe in the crate and this one of the crates being loaded with a giraffe leaning out the window of one crate. To me the crates look somewhat precarious for mountain switchbacks and other rough roads.\n\nI also recommend that you listen to giraffes humming in this YouTube video (really just audio).\n\nThe Lee Highway ran from New York City to San Diego. You can see a map of it on this Tillman County Blog.\n\nThere are many photos of dust storms from the 1930s online. The Oklahoman published a set of photos on the 80th anniversary of Black Sunday.\n\nNational Geographic shared a 2-minute video of murmuration of starlings in the Netherlands with an audio track that is mesmerizing to listen to all by itself. Watching the video is absolutely stunning.\n\nStorytelling strategies\n\nMaybe, like me, you have a story you want to share and make it come to life like Woody’s story comes to life in West with Giraffes. There are plenty of opportunities to learn the skill of storytelling— perhaps you can take a class at your local library or from a local storyteller. If you want to dip your toe in the water you can read a few tips on line such as How to Tell Better Stories: 4 Simple Tips for Introverts from Introverts, Dear— short and to the point! While I believe great storytelling is as much art as science, Science of People shares tips from the science side.\n\nCharacters\n\nWoodrow Wilson Nickel aka Woody: 105 year-old man in 2025 writing about his experiences driving the two giraffes west\n\nMr. Riley Jones, aka Old Man: head keeper of the San Diego Zoo. Responsible for transporting the two giraffes from New York to San Diego\n\nAugusta aka Red: want-to-be Life magazine photographer following and recording the giraffe’s cross-country trip\n\nWild Girl: female giraffe\n\nWild Boy: male giraffe\n\nEarl: initial driver for trip who quit on the first night out\n\nLionel Abraham Lowe: Red’s husband and reporter\n\nAugie Ann: Red and Lionel’s daughter\n\nMr. Jackson aka Big Papa: father of clan that owns “Cottages for Coloreds”\n\nMoses: eldest son of Big Papa, first to spot giraffes when they get stuck under overpass on detour\n\nPercival T Bowles: Circus ringmaster\n\nCooter: animal abuser who owns a run-down road side desert animal attraction\n\nDiscussion Topics\n\nCross-country Travel\n\nIn addition to being a love story to giraffes, West with Giraffes is a story of life on the road, and in particular on the road in the United States in 1938. Rutledge brings to life the auto courts and roadside attractions of the 1930s. While the cars and signs and lodgings have changed, there remains something special about a cross-country road trip.\n\nHave you ever dreamed of taking or have you taken a driving trip cross-country? If you have what were the highlights for you? What did you discover in the expanse of your country? What did you learn about your traveling companions and what did they learn about you?\n\nI have driven across the United States several times including from New England to San Diego. On that trip we drove through the same passes in the Appalachians, drove along a similar route into San Diego and stopped in many of the same cities, (if not the same lodgings :), as Woody and Riley. It was fascinating to see my route through the eyes of someone traveling there nearly 100 years prior.\n\nOur Stories\n\nEarly on when Woody says he has no story to Red she responds,\n\n“Sure you do. Everybody’s got one.” page 96\n\nAnd the novel is centered on Woody as he rapidly writes down his and Red’s story because he feels it’s important to share with Red’s daughter.\n\n“It’s a foolish man who thinks stories do not matter— when in the end, they may be all that matter and all the forever we’ll ever know.” page 339\n\nWhat’s your story? What do you want shared about you were while you were here on earth? Have you shared it? Would you like to? How can you share your story and with whom?\n\nAs Woody shares his story with the Old Man, the Old Man responds,\n\n“That’s your first story, but it doesn’t have to be your only story. That’s up to you.” page 283\n\nWhen have you created a new story for yourself? How did it feel to create a new story?\n\nMemories\n\n“Memories stick to things. Out of nowhere, something finds your nose, ears, or eyes and you’re on the other side of the country or world or in a whole other decade, being kissed by a doe-eyed beauty or punched by a drunken pal. You’ve got no control over it, none at all.” page 105\n\nWhat brings your most vivid memories to the forefront? What senses transport you to another time and place?\n\nMotivation\n\nWoody is highly motivated to get to California. He has nothing keeping him in New York, no family, no home, and a lot of ideas about the opportunities that await in California.\n\nRed says to Woody,\n\n“Woody, haven’t you ever wanted something so bad you had to do it or die trying?” page 156\n\nHave you ever had that feeling? When have you been so driven to do something that you felt like nothing could stop you? What motivates you to action?\n\nAnimal Joy and Zoos\n\nWild Girl and Wild Boy are at the heart of this novel and throughout and directly in her Author’s Note following the novel, the author shares her views of how we can be charmed and inspired by animals.\n\nAs Riley tells Woody, “animals know the secret to life.” page 79\n\nand later watching the murmuration of the birds beside the road, the 105-year old Woody writes,\n\n“For two full hours, my sideview mirror was brimming with both birds and giraffes, framing it all like a picture, the giraffes’ long necks swaying along with the billowing birds, and each glance surprised me with what I can only describe as a jolt of joy.” page 237\n\nWhen have you felt joy with an animal whether domesticated or in the wild? What about animals pulls at your heart-strings? What secrets do animals hold?\n\nSome people value zoos as a place to help individuals connect with animals they may never otherwise meet or a place to safeguard an animal from extinction. Others view zoos as limiting the natural inclinations and wanderings of animals, treating them as property and keeping them from their native lands. Have you ever visited a zoo? How do you feel about zoos? How do you think zoos are important and when are they not?\n\nQuotes\n\n“You can carry around a heavy load only for so long, though, before you’ve got to set it down, and that does double if you’re only eighteen.” page 277\n\n“The thing about knowing you’re doing something for the last time is that it takes the joy right out of it.” page 301\n\nLike what you see?
