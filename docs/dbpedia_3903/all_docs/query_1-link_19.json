All too often in the Western world, we hear Africa described as if it is one homogenous place and the “African people” described as if they are all part of a common group. It’s important to remember that Africa is, in fact, a huge, heterogeneous continent. There are 55 member countries of the African Union, more than 3,000 different ethnic groups, and more than 2000 languages spoken.\n\nIn addition to the diversity of its people and cultures, Africa is also rich in biodiversity. This continent is home to at least one-fifth of all known species of mammals, birds, and plants, as well as a wide variety of ecosystems, including deserts, drylands, savannahs, tropical forests, and mangrove forests. As a result of many factors, including population growth, agricultural practices, rapid urbanization, and illegal wildlife trafficking, Africa’s biodiversity is at serious risk, and it has been estimated that by 2100, as many as 50% of its mammal and bird species could disappear. This makes conservation-friendly development an important priority.\n\nDoes This Book List Include a Book for Every African Country?\n\nDue to the very large number of African countries and our desire to keep our list of recommended books to a manageable length, we have not included a book on the list for every African country. Instead, we have broken our reading into the five geographic regions as recognized by the African Union, and have curated a diverse list of books representing each region.\n\nThe Regions of Africa\n\nThe following is a list of the African regions, and the countries that make up each region, as currently recognized by the African Union.\n\nNorthern Africa: Algeria*, Egypt*, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, and Tunisia\n\nWestern Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde (Cape Verde), CÃ´te d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo\n\nCentral Africa: Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe\n\nEastern Africa: Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda\n\nSouthern Africa: Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe\n\n*Note that we include the Northern African countries of Algeria and Egypt on the reading list for the Middle Eastern geopolitical region, and therefore have not included books from these two countries on the reading list below.\n\nWhat Kind of Books are Included On This List?\n\nWhile no one book can possibly capture the diversity of an entire continent, we hope that our recommendations below will serve as a good starting point as you begin to explore the various regions and countries of Africa, and will pique your interest to learn more.\n\nOur list of books set in Africa includes historical fiction, contemporary fiction, non-fiction, and memoirs that will illustrate the vast diversity and beauty of this continent.\n\nThe Best Books Set in Africa\n\nBooks Set in Northern Africa\n\nWe previously included the Northern African countries of Algeria and Egypt on the reading list for the Middle Eastern geopolitical region, and therefore have not included books from these two countries on the reading list below.\n\nBook Summary\n\nIn 1941, after France fell to Nazi occupation, a 12-year-old girl named Josie fled to Casablanca, Morocco, with her family while awaiting safe passage to the US. The sights, sounds, and smells of Casablanca are completely different from everything Josie has ever known, but she loves it.\n\nSeventy years later, Zoe arrives in Morocco to start an expat life with her husband and baby daughter. Below the floorboards of her daughter’s bedroom, she discovers a wooden box and a diary that once belonged to Josie. As Zoe reads about the Casablanca of the past through Josie’s diary, it changes both her perspective and her attitude.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nNineteenth-century historical fiction fans will also want to consider The Lioness of Morocco, which is available free with Kindle Unlimited as of 8/17/22. Set in the 1800s, this novel includes elements of mystery/suspense as well as romance. The descriptions of Morocco are particularly strong in this book!\n\nIf you’d rather read a non-fiction book set in Morocco and you enjoy memoir-style works like A Year in Provence and Under the Tuscan Sun, then we recommend The Caliphâs House: A Year in Casablanca. Tahir Shah spent summer vacations in Morocco as a child and dreamed of escaping dreary London and moving his family to the sunny city of Casablanca. To put his plan into action, he purchases a crumbling mansion called Dar Khalifa, which was once home to the city’s spiritual leader, the Caliph.\n\nKindle Unlimited as of: 01/25/2024\n\nAlso Featured on These Book Lists:\n\nNovels About Quilting, Knitting, and Crocheting\n\nBook Summary\n\nThis modern parable was written by an award-winning Tunisian author.

He is a ten-year-old living in Burundi with a French father and a Rwandan mother. Life is comfortable in their expatriate neighborhood. They even have household help.\n\nThen, genocide in neighboring Rwanda begins. His mother is forever changed after seeing the devastation firsthand while checking on her family. Soon, the violence spills into Burundi, and Gabby is confronted by cruelness he couldn’t imagine in his earlier idyllic life.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nLike Gabriel, GaÃ«l Frye is also the son of a French father and Rwandan mother, who escaped to France in the 1990s after the outbreak of civil war in Burundi. The author is also a hip-hop artist, which leads to a poetic writing style.\n\nIf you’re looking for another book set in Burundi, consider The Flight of Augusta Hope by Glen Joanna. As a young girl, Augusta spins the globe and settles on her favorite country (based only on its name): Burundi. As an adult, she’s determined to finally figure out where she belongs – even if that place is half a world away. While only part of this book is set in Burundi, and the location jumps back and forth, it does a good job of explaining the political unrest in this country.\n\nBook Summary\n\nTold through the eyes of a generation of children, this novel explores the impact of when the drive for profit, coupled with the ghost of colonialism, collides with a community’s determination to hold onto its ancestral lands.\n\nWhen an American oil company moves into the African village of Kosawa, the ramifications are long-lasting. Pipeline spills render farmlands infertile, and children die from toxic drinking water. Empty promises are made to clean up and pay the villagers’ reparations, but the countryâs dictatorial government is only concerned with serving its own interests. The struggle went on for decades, but ultimately, this novel shows what is possible when a few people stand up for what is right.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nWe initially hesitated to include a book set in a fictional village (since we typically prefer to focus these lists on real locations). However, the author is from Limbe, Cameroon, and, based on reviews, we believe this book paints an accurate picture of experience in Cameroon and the surrounding region.\n\nThe authorâs first book, Behold the Dreamers, (about a Cameroonian immigrant living in NYC), has been enjoyed by our readers for the Decades Challenge.\n\nBook Summary\n\nSince 1996, Congo has been a place of war, where millions have died. Yet, despite Congo being as large as Western Europe, most of the world is unaware of the complex issues that have led to and continued this multi-decade conflict.\n\nThe author spent ten years working and living in Congo, conducting endless interviews to try and unravel the issues, starting with the history long before the battles and genocide began. It’s a challenging read but a good choice if you’re looking for a non-fiction book that sheds light on a topic most of us know very little about.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nIf you are looking for a fiction title set in the Congo, consider The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver. While this book has long been considered a staple of literature about this region of the world, it was originally published in 1998, and some readers say it hasn’t aged well.\n\nBooks Set in Eastern Africa\n\nBook Summary\n\nSolia was raised in Nairobi, Kenya, by her wealthy and conservative mother. Despite her motherâs stern parenting style, Solia is headstrong and outspoken. Eager to escape her motherâs strict rules, she wants to attend college in New York City.\n\nWhen she arrives, New York in the 1990s is very different than she imagined. Sheâs equally shocked by the entitlement of her wealthy classmates and the poverty she sees elsewhere in the city. Her sheltered upbringing in Kenya shielded her from many of the harsh realities of racism, so it comes as a shock when she experiences it for the first time in America – the place she envisioned to be the golden land of opportunity.\n\nAlso Featured on These Book Lists:\n\nBest Book Club Books for 2023\n\nBook Summary\n\nThis memoir shares the author’s unique experiences traveling to Madagascar as part of her biological anthropology studies.

Although the trip was more of an adventure than expected, she was still able to experience some of the rare lemurs only present in this remote forest region.\n\nThe book is part adventure, part self-discovery, and a full experience of this beautiful and ecologically diverse island country.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nWhile this book is available in Kindle form, you probably wonât find this one at the library. However, if you are interested in learning about Madagascar’s wildlife, landscape, and people, this is a great option.\n\nOne of our readers said: “The author includes various bits about the history, culture, language, and ecology of the island nation throughout, which is just enough and written well enough not to slow the flow of reading.”\n\nBook Summary\n\nThis memoir – from Nobel Peace Prize-winning Wangari Maathai – recounts her life story, from her childhood in a rural village in the 1940s to her role as an activist and a single mother of three.\n\nThroughout her life, Wangari Maathai fought for environmental responsibility, equality for women, and democracy in her home nation of Kenya. These efforts have led to many run-ins with the brutal Moi government and have even landed her in jail.\n\nHer drive and determination also allowed her to become the first woman in East and Central Africa to earn a Ph.D. and the first woman in Kenya to head a university department.

African. Girl. Boy. But when Ugandan President Idi Amin announces that Indians have ninety days to leave the country, suddenly those differences are the only things that people in Entebbe can see â not the shared after-school samosas or Asha cheering for Yesofu at every cricket game.\n\nDetermined for her life to stay the same, Asha clings to her world tighter than ever before. But Yesofu is torn, pulled between his friends, his family, and a promise of a better future. Now, as neighbors leave and soldiers line the streets, the two friends find that nothing seems sure…not even their friendship.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nThis is a middle-grade novel, but we’ve included it on this list because it is beautifully written and provides an eye-opening look at an important time in Uganda’s history that few are aware of.\n\nAuthor Tina Athaide was born in Uganda and emigrated to London and then Canada. She loved to read as a child, but rarely saw herself reflected on the pages.

At the age of seven, Valentino was separated from his family and trekked hundreds of miles by foot, pursued by militias, government bombers, and wild animals, crossing the deserts of three countries to find freedom. When Valentino ultimately immigrated to the United States under the Lost Boys of Sudan program, he found a life full of promise but also heartache and myriad new challenges.\n\nDave Eggers is an American author with many non-fiction and biographical successes. For this work, Eggers and Valentino spent many years collaborating to tell the story of the Lost Boys of Sudan. Valentino shared everything that he could remember, and from that material, Eggers initially set out to write a conventional biography. Ultimately, however, he determined he could best tell the story by blending non-fictional and fictional elements. By classifying the book a novel, Eggers tells the Washington Post, it allowed him to “re-create conversations, streamline complex relationships, add relevant detail and manipulate time and space in helpful ways — all while maintaining the essential truthfulness of the storytelling.”\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nIf you are interested in a shorter and easier read about the Lost Boys of Sudan, consider Linda Sue Park’s middle-grade novel, A Long Walk to Water. This dual-timeline novel follows the stories of two eleven-year-olds in Sudan – one in 1985 and one in 2008 – whose stories ultimately intersect astonishingly and movingly.\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n95% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nFrom the author of Code Name Verity, this YA historical fiction is told in diary format from the point of view of two teenagers – Emilia and Teo.

Em’s mom, a white woman, takes Teo in, but she is concerned about the racism he will face in the American south because of the color of his skin.\n\nShe decides to raise Em and Teo in Ethiopia, the birthplace of Teo’s father, and soon all three of them fall in love with the beautiful and peaceful country. But WWII shatters that peace when, in 1935, Italy invades Ethiopia, and Em and Teo are drawn into the conflict.\n\nBook Summary\n\nThis is the moving memoir of Dr. Hawa Abdi, who has been called “the Mother Teresa of Somalia.” When the Somali government collapsed in 1991, as famine struck and aid groups fled, Dr. Abdi turned her 1300 acres of farmland near war-torn Mogadishu into a camp for displaced people. She was Somaliaâs first female obstetrician, as well as a lawyer and humanitarian.\n\nShe also inspired her daughters to become doctors. Together, they kept 90,000 of their fellow citizens safe, healthy, and educated for over 20 years at the Dr. Hawa Abdi Hope Village – a community for displaced Somalis with a 400-bed hospital, primary and secondary schools, and an innovative community justice system.\n\nIn 2010, Dr. Abdi was kidnapped by radical insurgents, who also destroyed much of her hospital simply because she was a woman. She, along with media pressure, convinced the rebels to let her go, and she demanded and received a written apology. Her work garnered her a Nobel Peace Prize nomination in 2012. Her memoir was published in 2013, and Dr. Abdi died in 2020.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nIf you prefer to read a fiction book set in Somalia, consider The Orchard of Lost Souls by Nadifa Mohamed. Set in the late 1980s, this novel tells the story of three different women’s experiences in Somalia. The three women meet briefly at the start of the book, and then, as the country is unraveled by a civil war, the fates of these three become twisted together. This book deals with difficult topics, including the fear, abuse, and poverty that Somalians face daily, but throughout it all, the three main characters continue to hold on to hope.\n\nThe same author also wrote Black Mamba Boy, a novel set in 1930s Somalia and tells of a decade of war and upheaval as seen through the eyes of a small boy.\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n93% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nThis memoir, told in alternating timelines, is an incredible tale of resilience.\n\nClemantine was only six years old in 1994 when, in a span of just 100 days, more than 800,000 people would be murdered in Rwanda and millions more displaced.

In this book, he gives us a guide’s-eye-view of what it’s like to live and work in Botswana’s Kalahari Desert, confronting wild animals and managing herds of tourists daily (the latter often proves to be the more dangerous).\n\nWritten in the humorous style of Bill Bryson, Allison’s wry wit is exceeded only by his love and respect for the animals. His highly entertaining stories will keep you laughing, but you’ll also have a much better appreciation for the wildlife of Africa at the end of the book.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nWe always look forward to reading Bill Bryson’s travelogues and hoped to find that he’d written one about his experiences in Africa. He does have a book titled African Diary, but it’s a very short (55ish pages) report of his brief visit to Kenya at the invitation of CARE International. We selected Peter Allison’s book for this list because it brings the dry wit and humor that we usually seek from Bryson in a more in-depth format. But loyal fans of Bill Bryson, or those looking to pick up a quick read, may also want to pick up African Diary.\n\nThis title also immediately caught our eye because it’s exactly the advice that Angela’s safari guide gave her on her first day in South Africa (that and, “If I say climb a tree, don’t be the slowest to climb the tree.”)\n\nIf you are interested in reading about an African safari experience in the form of a light-hearted romantic comedy, pick up Jana Goes Wild by Farah Heron. Set in Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park, the author draws upon her own safari experiences in this 2023 rom com. While it’s not the strongest book we’ve read, its unique setting makes it worth consideration for fans of the genre.\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n98% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nBorn a Crime is the true story of Daily Show host Trevor Noahâs childhood and into his early adulthood. His rise to success was unlikely based on his beginning. Trevor was born in South Africa in 1984 to a white father and black mother. His parents could have been imprisoned for five years – or worse – for conceiving him. He spent his early years largely hidden from life outside because his mother feared (with good reason) that he could be removed from her custody because of the apartheid rules of segregation.\n\nIn true Trevor Noah fashion, you’ll be entertained while also receiving an education on life in apartheid South Africa. He manages to explain the extremely complex system of apartheid in accessible terms by drawing on examples and comparisons.\n\nWhen the era of white rule officially ended in the early 1990s, it was far from the end of the family’s troubles. From attempted kidnappings and domestic violence to high school dating drama, youâll find a mixture of relatable and shocking stories that keep you engaged with every page.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nWe highly recommend listening to the audiobook, which Trevor narrates himself. Trevor speaks eight languages and draws upon each of them throughout the book to explain how languages can divide people, but can also be used to build bridges. We found it much more impactful to hear him speak each language with the correct sounds and pronunciations rather than attempting our own phonetic reading.\n\nNOTE: Angela and her husband listened to the audiobook on a road trip with their then 8 and 9-year-old sons. The boys were both fascinated by the stories and learned a lot, but mom and dad did have to sensor crude language and a few other parts here and there (including a Santa spoiler). There is a young reader version available (It’s Trevor Noah) that is appropriate for kids to read on their own, or if you prefer only clean language.\n\nAlso Featured on These Book Lists:\n\nMust-Listen Memoirs\n\nBest Audiobooks for Road Trips\n\nBooks Set in the 1990s\n\n20 Books Like It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover\n\nBook Summary\n\nSet against the backdrop of 1950s apartheid in South Africa, this darkly romantic crime novel features English detective Emmanuel Cooper. The first mystery in the series takes place in a small town on the border between South Africa and Mozambique. New apartheid laws have created a deeper division between the Afrikaners and the English. Tensions boil over when an Afrikaner police officer is found dead.\n\nDetective Cooper begins investigating, but his efforts are blocked by the powerful police Security Branch. But Cooper has no patience for politics and isn’t interested in making friends. Instead, he strikes out on his own and follows a trail of clues that lead him to complicated and shocking revelations.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nThis series was recommended to us by one of our readers who initially heard about it from William Kent Krueger. And a WKK recommendation will always catch our attention.\n\nAuthor Malla Nunn grew up in the country of Swaziland (now known as Eswatini) in southern Africa before moving to Perth, Australia with her parents in the 1970s. She is both an award-winning screenwriter and novelist.\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n90% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nFifty-something Tannie Maria loves to cook and write – which is why sheâs the perfect person to write a recipe column for her local paper, the Klein Karoo Gazette. But when the powers that be insist that the paper must also feature an advice section – Tannieâs column has to meet the requirement by becoming a joint advice and recipe column.\n\nWhen her column receives a letter from a woman whose husband beats her, Tannieâs best advice appears not to be good enough when a woman matching that description turns up dead. She and her Gazette colleagues decide to help the police find the murderer. But things are not so simple, and soon thereâs another murder – a suspected poisoning – as well as a kidnapping or two.\n\nThis is the first book in a murder mystery series thatâs packed with humor (ranging from slapstick to understated).\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nThis book includes over 20 pages of recipes and a helpful glossary of the Afrikaans and Dutch references in the book. Some readers found that they understood the context without flipping to the glossary, while others found themselves regularly using the glossary, which slowed down the pace of the reading.\n\nThis cozy mystery series transports you to the authorâs home region of South Africa, Klein Karoo. When you think of South Africa, you may picture safaris and beautiful coastlines, but the Klein Karoo region (located about 200 miles east of Cape Town) is a semi-desert that is sometimes referred to as South Africaâs outback. Almost completely surrounded by mountains, this 200-mile-long valley is only about 30 miles wide, with the Swartberg Mountains on one side and the Langeberge Mountains on the other. Oudtshoorn, the largest town in the Klein Karoo region, is known as the world’s ostrich capital and draws 100,000 visitors annually to the worldâs largest ostrich farm.\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n100% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nNelson Mandela is one of the great leaders of the 20th century whose lifelong dedication to the fight against racial oppression in South Africa won him not only the Nobel Peace Prize, but also the presidency of his country. This autobiography is very broad in its scope, covering his upbringing in the traditional tribal culture of his ancestors, his early years as a poor student and a law clerk, his political awakening, his time spent in jail, and finally, his inauguration as South Africaâs first black president.\n\nIn addition to providing an in-depth and personal look at the life of this incredible man – Long Walk to Freedom also provides a riveting account of South Africa’s history and change from Apartheid to a Democratic state.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nThis memoir is on the longer side at 600+ pages.\n\nIf you want to learn more about South Africa’s political history, we also recommend the classic Cry the Beloved Country. Originally published in 1948, this novel sheds light on the racial injustice in South Africa that predated Apartheid. Of course, as with all classics, keep in mind that this book is a product of its time.\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n100% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nIn 1939, as Hitler’s influence began to cast a shadow across the world, apartheid started to take root in South Africa. During this time, Peekay’s childhood was marked by humiliation and abandonment.\n\nIn this coming-of-age novel (inspired by the author’s real-life experiences), we follow Peekay’s life from the age of 5 to 20 – including his years at boarding school, where he endured horrible conditions. Despite all the suffering he endures, Peekay remains open-minded and positive and manages to form some very meaningful relationships with teachers, mentors, and a boxer.\n\nThis beautiful novel provides a deep dive not only into the history of South Africa, but also into the world of boxing.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nThis book is on the longer side, but readers say it’s well worth the time!\n\nBorn in Johannesburg, South Africa, author Bryce Courtenay (d.2012) was a South African-Australian advertising director and novelist.\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n100% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nSet against the backdrop of life on a South African wild animal reserve, this memoir details South African-born conservationist Lawrence Anthony’s experiences taking in a “rogue” herd of elephants (initially against his better judgment). The elephants had already earned a reputation as notorious escape artists (largely due to their past negative encounters with humans), and Anthony was their last hope. As Lawrence battled to create a bond with the elephants and save them from execution, he came to realize that they had a lot to teach him about life, loyalty and freedom.\n\nAlthough the elephants are the focus of this story, readers can also glean much more about life in the wilds of South Africa.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nAngela had the opportunity to visit and interact with a trio of similarly “rogue” elephants at another South African reserve. It was a truly moving and humbling experience, and she immediately started seeking out books to help her understand more about the elephants and the emotional bonds they can form with the humans who protect them. If you’ve ever wanted to know more about elephants or conservation, the late Lawrence Anthony is the one to learn from. Anthony also authored another highly recommended book, The Last Rhinos: My Battle to Save One of the World’s Greatest Creatures.\n\nFor further reading on African elephants and their bonds with humans, we also highly recommend The Memory of an Elephant by Alex Lasker. This 238-page young adult book has phenomenal ratings and is said to be a must-read for animal lovers. Both heartwarming and heartbreaking, the book is narrated by an aging African elephant as he goes on a perilous journey to find the humans who rescued him fifty years earlier. The story spans from 1962 to 2015 and spans across eastern Africa, Great Britain, and New York.\n\nBook Girls’ Readers Rate This Book\n\n100% Would Recommend to a Friend\n\nBook Summary\n\nAs a young boy growing up in Malawi – a country where magic ruled and modern science was mystery – William was fascinated by electricity and dreamed of studying science at a top boarding school. When famine devastated his family’s farm and left them destitute, William’s parents could no longer afford his tuition, and he was forced to drop out of school. Nevertheless, William continued to pursue his passion with the help of books and set out to bring electricity and water to his village by building a crude but operable windmill.\n\nSoon, news of William’s “electric wind” spread across the country and around the world, and the boy who was once called crazy became an inspirational example of human inventiveness and its power to overcome crippling adversity.\n\nThe Book Girls Say…\n\nSome readers report that the writing style of this memoir makes it a bit difficult to immerse yourself in the story, but most agree that ultimately the important messages of the book make it worth the added effort.\n\nWe have linked to the YA version of this book, but there is also a middle-grade version available for younger readers.
