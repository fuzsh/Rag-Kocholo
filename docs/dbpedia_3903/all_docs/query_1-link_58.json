        "text": "In the sparsely populated Karoo desert in the heart of South Africa's Northern Cape, the spirit of apartheid lives on.\n\nI spent a few days in Orania, a town established in 1991 where no black people live.\n\nI was part of a BBC crew, including Zimbabwean journalist Stanley Kwenda, who were accredited to visit.\n\nAnd during that time, I did not see any other black people in the town of 1,000 - an unusual experience in modern South Africa.\n\nIt is an Afrikaner-only town, where only Afrikaans is spoken, because of fears about \"diluting culture\".\n\n\"We do not fit in easily in the new South Africa. It [Orania] was an answer to not dominating others and not being dominated by others,\" says Carel Boshoff Jr, the community leader.\n\nMr Boshoff is one of the leaders of the town founded by his father Carel Boshoff Snr, an Afrikaner intellectual and son-in-law of apartheid architect, Hendrik Verwoerd.\n\nThe town was founded by Mr Boshoff Snr as a registered company shortly before white-minority rule ended in the rest of the country.\n\nMr Verwoerd's grandson tells me that his people were faced with a tough question about their future when the black government was elected in 1994.\n\n\"In terms of Afrikaners who had been standing very close to the state, when the policies such as black economic empowerment and affirmative action came into place, Afrikaners needed to seriously think about their future. It wouldn't make sense not to,\" he said.\n\nBlack Economic Empowerment (BEE) was introduced to encourage more black participation in business.\n\nOrania has also proved to be the answer for those Afrikaners who felt displaced in the land their people had ruled for many decades.\n\n\"I see nothing wrong with apartheid,\" says Martin Kemp, one of the older residents.\n\n\"Of course you get the petty apartheid: 'You use this toilet I use that toilet', I don't think that was necessary but the real apartheid as Dr Verwoerd saw it, there was nothing wrong with it,\" he said.\n\nWe were taken on a guided tour of the town's facilities by John Strydom, a retired doctor.\n\nThe town's leaders insist that Orania is misunderstood. \"We are not against black people. We are for ourselves,\" is their message.\n\nHowever, black people cannot live here.\n\nProspective residents are screened by the town council using a strict criterion, which includes first and foremost being an ethnic Afrikaner.\n\nIt is not enough to simply speak Afrikaans, as is the case with many black and mixed-race South Africans.\n\nThe town boasts amenities such as shops, hair salons, a library, a post office, a hotel, a couple of schools - and churches, a lot of churches.\n\nBut beneath the surface of this solitude lurks a fear that leads people to abandon high-paying jobs in the city for lowly jobs in this arid land.\n\n\"The levels of crime and violent crimes in South Africa are definitely pushing powers that bring people to Orania. Many of them have been victims of crimes,\" says Mr Boshoff.\n\nSouth Africa is considered to be one of the most violent societies in the world, with one of the highest murder rates.\n\nOfficial statistics suggest that most crimes actually happen in poor communities between people known to each other, but this has not stopped the fear of crime in other communities.\n\n\"He gave away the country for nothing. We had the army,\" he says and stops abruptly, beginning to shake his head.\n\nInside the dimly-lit pub, a game of rugby is on the TV, apart from a few odd glances, no-one seems to pay much attention to Stanley or me.\n\nA few more locals do come over to our table and conversation is polite and largely politically correct, much like in the rest of South Africa.\n\nThe pernicious issue of jobs and pro-black policies rears its head.\n\nOne local explains it as \"reverse racism\".\n\n\"We can't get jobs. It's like we are being punished for the past,\" he says.\n\nThey seem oblivious to the oppression of black South Africans during apartheid. For them it was a system that gave order.\n\n\"It [apartheid] didn't affect me. So many people get aggravated now for things they didn't even witness. It's over, move on,\" says Yolandie Jonk, 29, a call centre agent.\n\nAs the sun sets, the bronze busts of Afrikaner leaders spanning over many decades - Paul Kruger, JBM Hertzog, DF Malan, JG Strijdom and, of course, Mr Verwoerd - look protectively over the town.\n\nHeld in disdain elsewhere, they are Orania's heroes - yet it is difficult to see how the community will be able to remain so completely isolated in such an inter-connected world.\n\nBut as one pub drinker put it - being an Afrikaner in Orania is \"something we will defend with our lives if we need to\".\n\nCorrection: We have removed from this report a suggestion that black people do not go to Orania, although none actually lives there. Amendments have also been made to clarify the town's ownership and some issues regarding the identity of contributors.\n\nYou can hear a BBC World Service programme about Orania on Tuesday 7 October ."
