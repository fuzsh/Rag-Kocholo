        "text": "HEART OF THE HUNTER, the first feature-length adaptation of one of Deon Meyer’s bestselling novels, has proven an instant worldwide success on its Netflix debut, becoming the first ever African film to reach the summit of the Global Top 10 for English language films. The film was viewed over 11 million times in the two days following its premiere, and entered the top ten in 75 countries for the week ending the 31st of March. Deon adapted the screenplay himself from his novel, which follows a retired assassin in post-apartheid South Africa who is pulled back into action when his friend uncovers a dangerous conspiracy at the heart of n government.\n\nThe film stars Bonko Khoza (THE WOMAN KING) as Zuko Khumalo, alongside a stellar cast of fellow South African actors, including Connie Ferguson (GENERATIONS), Masasa Mbangeni, Tim Theron, Deon Coetzee, Peter Butler, Connie Chiume and Meyer-adaptation regular Sisanda Henna (DEVIL’S PEAK, TRACKERS). The director is Mandla Dube (SILVERTON SIEGE), and Deon co-wrote the screenplay with Willem Grobler; the film is a Scene23 production for Netflix.\n\nIn the Netflix Original film adaptation, Zuko Khumalo is an unassuming family man with a deadly past – but his tranquil world is abruptly turned upside down when an old colleague calls on him to honour an oath he made and save the country from venal political interests. Though he resists being pulled back into his previous life, it becomes clear that events already pose a deadly threat to his domestic ambitions and the peaceful family life he holds so dear. HEART OF THE HUNTER is a tale of one man’s struggle for survival against a corrupt government, a group of bloodthirsty killers and, most of all, against his past.\n\nIn other news, Deon has also been honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees (KKNK) arts festival, receiving the KKNK Afrikaans Onbeperk Prize for Literary Contribution. Deon’s first full-length stage musical, Roem: ’n Musiekverhaal, also premiered at the festival, to a series of standing ovations. ROEM, written by Deon in Afrikaans alongside musical director Coenie de Villiers, starred Anrich Herbst, Eldon van der Merwe, Daneel van der Walt and Nelandi Boshoff, and was directed by Nicole Holm.\n\nDeon’s latest novel, LEO, a longstanding Number One in Afrikaans in South Africa will be published by Hodder in the UK and Grove Atlantic in the US later this year.\n\nAbout Deon Meyer\n\nDeon Meyer lives in Stellenbosch, South Africa, but also spends time with family in Italy and in France where he was awarded France’s highest arts honour, Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres (Knight in the Order of Arts and Letters) in 2021. He writes in Afrikaans and his South African publisher Human & Rousseau has sold close to 800,000 Afrikaans copies of his novels. Rights in his titles are sold in 30 territories and 28 languages, and many of his books have been optioned for film. Among his awards are the Deutsche Krimi Prize in Germany, the ATKV Prize in South Africa, the Martin Beck Award in Sweden and Le Grand Prix de Littérature Policière and Le Prix Mystère de la Critique in France. COBRA was shortlisted for the 2015 CWA International Dagger, THIRTEEN HOURS was shortlisted for the 2010 CWA International Dagger, and HEART OF THE HUNTER, was longlisted for the 2005 IMPAC Prize and selected as one of Chicago Tribune’s ‘10 best mysteries and thrillers of 2004’. THE DARK FLOOD was longlisted for the 2023 CWA International Dagger (for Crime Fiction in Translation). His latest novel LEO, a new Benny Griessel thriller, enjoyed ten weeks at the top of the South African bestseller lists.\n\nPraise for the film HEART OF THE HUNTER\n\n‘HEART OF THE HUNTER is outshining a lot of recent entries in the action genre… this movie has its own flavor and a great action hero at the heart of the story… This movie repackages everything that other action films did before it while offering some fresh touches with its hero and setting. In other words, it’s a great choice for your next movie night when you’re looking for some action.’ – Blair Marnell, Digital Trends\n\n‘Deon Meyer and Willem Grobler’s writing in HEART OF THE HUNTER tackles everything from the way apartheid eroded South Africa to how capitalism is doing the same to the country in the present day… it’s refreshing to see a film reckoning with its own past as well as the citizens who live in ivory towers… I was blown away by the action... The contact, the reactions, and the sound design in all the hand-to-hand fight sequences are simply perfect… I couldn’t help but applaud it. And standing in stark contrast to these exciting set pieces are the emotional, bloody, and heavy personal altercations between Tiger and Zuko. There is a real weight to their conflict, even though they don’t know a lot about each other, and that’s what makes the finale so impactful. The performances from the entire cast of HEART OF THE HUNTER are exquisite… As a fan of action films in general, I am impressed. So, I’ll recommend it to the regulars of the school of action cinema. In addition to that, I hope this becomes the gateway to mainstream and genre-specific South African films.’ – Pramit Chatterjee, DMT\n\nPraise for the novel HEART OF THE HUNTER\n\n‘Deon Meyer hooked me with this one right from the start. HEART OF THE HUNTER is a thriller with some weight attached and that is a rare find.’ – Michael Connelly\n\n‘A pacy, wised-up, post-apartheid thriller; a fabulously page-turning book.' – Barbara Trapido\n\n‘A rip-roaring adventure, a portrait of spy-world duplicity and a look at South Africa's post-apartheid politics.’ – Patrick Anderson, Washington Post\n\n‘A thriller good enough to nip at the heels of le Carré… Wonderful setting; rich, colourful cast, headed by a valiant/vulnerable protagonist who makes empathy easy.’ – Kirkus, Starred Review\n\nPraise for Deon Meyer\n\n‘Deon Meyer's name on the cover is a guarantee of crime writing at its best.’ – Tess Gerritsen\n\n‘Deon Meyer should be on everyone's reading list.’ – Michael Connelly\n\n‘Deon Meyer is the monarch of South African crime novelists.’ – Barry Forshaw, Financial Times\n\n‘Unquestionably the supremo of South African crime-writing fiction’ – Peter James\n\n‘Deon Meyer is not just South Africa’s greatest crime writer, he’s up there with the best in the world.’ – Marcel Berlins, The Times\n\n‘Deon Meyer is good at sketching a realistic country, people we recognise and grow accustomed to, and telling a darn good yarn.’ – Diane De Beer, The Star\n\n‘Deon Meyer is one of the best crime writers on the planet.’ – Mail on Sunday\n\nVisit Deon’s website\n\nFollow Deon on Twitter"
