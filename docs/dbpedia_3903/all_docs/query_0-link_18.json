Representing nearly 20% of the national population, the community perpetuates certain cultural traditions based on singing and dancing, in particular. PheZulu Safari Park offers an authentic immersion in the heart of the Zulu people’s beliefs. The Gasa clan perform dances here in costumes accompanied by traditional music.\n\nBonus: Baptised the “Valley of a Thousand Hills”, this ancestral land, home to the Zulu people, is just one hour from Durban!"
