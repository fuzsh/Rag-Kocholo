        "text": "Intro: One of Africa's few economic successes (in large part due to what the British didn't find under the soil), Botswana (despite featuring high on wish lists) is visited by few budget independent travellers who if anything transit and is pretty much the realm of overland trucks and expensive 'safe' African package tours. In a nutshell transport to anywhere of interest is a major problem and quite expensive (hiring a car is the best bet).\n\nAccommodation also is nowhere near widespread or affordable as in South Africa. What has happened in Botswana is quite simply the promotion of high cost, low impact tourism (we like the second bit), which means that backpackers are all but priced out (unless on a camping tour) of trips out of the heart of the Okavango delta (though less expensive trips can be arranged out of Maun). Perhaps for all it has to offer the only compelling reason to visit Botswana over neighbouring countries is if you have your own car (or on an overland truck) plus tent and are transiting between Vic Falls and Namibia (as most tours do).\n\nHighlights: Chobe National Park - elephant filled, really need a 4x4 or take a tour from Vic Falls. Okavango Swamp, unique inland delta - fast becoming out priced for backpackers. It is recommended that you head for the western delta (aka. the panhandle), Sepuna for cheap mokoro trips. Our opinion is we don't rate the delta that highly considering cost and would much prefer to take the same type of river trip in Brazil or Bolivia.\n\nLowlights: Costs and distances - the fact that if you go independently without your own car or tent you will get to Francistown, Gaborone and that's about it - both of no real interest.\n\nGetting around: As with much of Africa Chinese road building has made a dramatic improvement to many routes. There are now many paved roads, but the country is rual enough you can easily leave them, but a 4x4 is not a must. The road is tarred to Mokhotlong (via Leribe) and is now tarred all the way to Qacha's Nek going south from Maseru. The road to Katse and the road to Thaba Tseka are tarred, and the road to Semonkong is (as of April 2014) tarred for all but the last 15km. In the towns some side roads are unsealed but you can bump along in a saloon easily enough â only if heading off in to the mountains on unsealed roads then a 4x4 is a must and you will still need a 4x4 for the Sani pass. Buses cover most, but not all routes (slowly). Best bet is with a rented car from South Africa, but check you can take your car to Lesotho with your rental agency.\n\nCosts: More expensive than South Africa but visitors from N America or Europe will still find it okay value. If coming from [and use to prices in] Tanzania or Malawi you will find it expensive. Nightlife can be quite expensive as are restaurants in comparison to what you actually get for your money. As with all of Africa, anything imported from further than South Africa is expensive. Accommodation is pretty cheap. Around $35-40 a day will easily cover food, reasonable basic accommodation and a fair amount of transport. Can easily double or triple this figure if eating in nice places and going out regularly as the nightlife is excellent and you have to pay to get in nearly everywhere.\n\nGetting around: Buses cover the main B1 road which acts as the spine of the country, and side roads to Swakopmund (also a train here from Windhoek). Its about US$70 from Windhoek to Cape Town or Maun in Botswana. As mentioned there is more than a strong case for getting a group together and renting a car. These are a little more expensive in Namibia than South Africa, so you may want to bring one from there. As with South Africa, the best deals are normally found before you leave on the internet. If driving is not an option, any hostel will put you in touch with a camping tour which will cost about US$40-60 a day inclusive.\n\nIntro: South Africa, apart from being one of the best value and most under-rated backpacking destinations around, is a country of stunning variety. Forgetting the gems and highlights easily visited in its bordering nations, you've got everything from the typical African acacia scrub in Kruger national park to the typically un-African green fynbos-clad slopes of Cape Town. In between there is everything from wine lands to the mountainous Drakensbergs to a red desert. Most importantly among all this is one of the worlds best networks of hostels and budget accommodation.\n\nA trip can be as African (Zulu-land hut) or un-African (Jo'burg shopping centre) as you wish. Prices do depend on the exchange rate which spent several years strengthening against major international currencies (making travel more expensive) before crashing with problems in the mining sector. For a developed country with high standards - away from over visited tourist hot-spots - it is excellent value. Your money will go much further than in Australia, Europe, Japan or the USA, and just as well really since there are so many brilliant things to do (most quite reasonable) from the world's highest bungee jump to sand boarding to getting in the water with Great White Sharks!\n\nSo what's the down-side? Well there is always crime, which in actual fact (despite its undeniable presence) few travellers come across in any measure considering the natural precautions normally taken by them and almost any one else in the country with anything worth stealing (crime has been slowly declining since the 2010 World Cup). Public transport can't be relied on completely and will normally mean you will have to venture into less-safe areas to catch. Thus really to get around and to the gems that most fleeting visitors miss, you do really need to join a hop-on-hop-off backpacker bus or much better still, hire a car. The country lacks the history of somewhere like Israel or India, the exoticism of the likes of Peru and Thailand, and certainly perhaps the beauty and compactness of, say, New Zealand. Nevertheless, it still has all that in small measure and a lot more besides.\n\nHighly recommended and certainly not to be missed over most other African destinations and/or the typical 'round-the-world' imagination-lacking hang outs.\n\nHighlights: Wide network of great hostels with great social scenes, good infrastructure, numerous attractions from very 'western' to very 'African' and the easy to enjoy beach/surf life. Many travellers rate Cape Town and the Garden Route as their highlight, which are both interesting and pretty, however those that travel more widely rate the less visited KwaZulu-Natal including the Drakensbergs, battle fields, St. Lucia and numerous beaches as the highlights. It is great value for money.\n\nLowlights: Initial paranoia regarding crime, lack of affordable public transport and big cities.\n\nGetting around: South Africa does lack an effective public transport system or at least one that is both practical and accessible to backpackers (apart from inter-city buses). With so much to be seen and many of the country's best attractions lying far outside town centres, without a doubt the best way to get around is with your own hired car. On a long term rental (30 days) with unlimited miles, rates are (especially if sharing) are very affordable. The price does however rise the shorter the rental is. The best way to get a good deal is to book your car in advance through the internet before you leave. You will find many good offers through a simple search and can iron out all the details such as taking the car to Namibia, Botswana etc. Rental is normally arranged through an agency, however cars are generally supplied through a big international company such as Avis. One way drop-offs cost as little as US$20. Despite some toll roads, all in all - sharing the cost - a hire car in South Africa is the difference between a great and amazing trip and a money saver in the long term.\n\nIf you can't or don't want to drive, in addition to the few intercity buses, there is an effective backpacker bus running. Similar to its Australian and Kiwi counter parts, the Baz Bus is a hop-on and hop-off unlimited time ticket bus that drops you and picks you up directly at your hostel following the most popular routes around the country (that of the coast line). The bus works well if you really can't or won't drive, but travel times are slow as drop offs and collections take a while and varying pick up times can see you lose time while you hang around waiting to be collected (the bus is notoriously late). You also need to consider the other people on the bus you are seemingly forced into a group with and the fact that once at your hostel you are more or less stranded and might need to fork out on taxis.\n\nThere is now a reasonable and affordable budget airline network, should you want to save time making jumps between big cities. Just remember, the best of South Africa is far away from the major urban hubs.\n\nAccommodation: There is a large and excellent network of backpacker hostels throughout the country that has expanded dramatically over the past few years. There is a hostel in any given 'tourist attraction/route' town and they are without a doubt the cheapest and best option. With a great social scene and loads of information on offer. Some would say (it's a close call with New Zealand) that South Africa has the best hostel network in the world, and is a real highlight. It is normally never a problem to get a dorm bed, but doubles do need phoning ahead for. You can also pitch your tent in hostel gardens, however you are going to only save a dollar or so per night doing so.\n\nAccommodation guides - The multitude of cheap accommodation options can all be found in what becomes the South Africa travel bible - the great Coast to Coast accommodation guide. This little booklet which hostel/guesthouse owners pay to be listed in can be found for free in all hostels. The quirky little book makes planning a trip/route a joy and inspires getting to the best of South Africa away from major cities. Coupled with the local information found in any hostel you, could probably leave the guidebook at home and be better off. Testament to the huge increase in budget accommodation (which peaked around the time of the World Cup) this guide has literally doubled in size from when we first used it ten years ago and a competitor called 'The Alternative Route' or AR is now found alongside. Both do the same thing, the AR is full colour and easier to follow, but less fun (the Coast to Coast does now include a colour photo section). Both the Coast to Coast and AR can be used together and are highly recommended (even if - paid - property write-ups are a little fluffy).\n\nAverage cost: From US$10-20 for a dorm bed to US$30-40 for a nice double\n\nVisa strategy: Visas are not required by most Commonwealth countries, except for countries that don't have reciprocal agreements (most developed countries), these are notably: UK, Australia, NZ. Most others do need a visa which is best obtained on the border or at a nearby embassy. Fees vary from about US$50 to US$100. It is possible to get a free visa, if you have prior arrangements for accommodation and activities in Zambia. This must be arranged at least a week in advance, so your details will be on the border in time for your arrival. The normal methods for doing this are by arranging over the internet with Fawlty Towers in Livingstone (or another hostel - see guidebook for addresses) or by arranging a South Luangwa safari in Lilongwe. This is of course well worth doing, but don't leave it until the last minute.\n\nIntro: When most think of Zimbabwe, they think of violence and hyper-inflation. The hyper-inflation and violence linked to the last election and land-seizers is now gone. During 2009 inflation hit 7000% and the country ground to a halt. After an election came power-sharing and a lifting of a ban on USD transactions. The economy dollarized and things started on the path back to normality. Normality as in one of the friendliest and safest Africa countries.\n\nAt time of writing Zimbabwe is far off its heyday, but is improving fast and safe (by African standards with common-sense). If sticking to the worn paths, using local tours and avoiding trouble spots there is no reason why Zimbabwe should be crossed off any Southern Africa travel list. In fact it should be added!\n\nThe sights are great, the people are ultra-friendly, educated, stoic and great fun. Transport is easy and this country needs all the help from tourists to get back on its feet.\n\nVictoria Falls , the Zimbabwe side is both bigger and more impressive than across the border. The Mana Pools are a great and unique place to see wildlife, as is Lake Kariba. In addition Great Zimbabwe ruins are among the most impressive in Africa and Matopos national park, while lacking in big game makes up for with unique scenery and a sense of history.\n\nHarare is a modern city with smart areas and good shops/restaurants, but can easily be avoided. The previous crisis closed down much of the country's budget accommodation options and manufacturing. Meaning that because fewer traveller friendly places to stay remain and almost everything is imported, Zimbabwe - on some levels - is not an ultra-cheap place to visit."
