        "text": "The Blunder\n\nby Mutt-Lon\n\nThe Blunder by Mutt-Lon, the pen name of Nsegbe Daniel Alain, is a historical novel set in early 20th century Cameroon, when the country was split between French and English colonial administrations. It's based on the true story of Dr. Eugène Jamot, a French military doctor whose head still graces a monument outside the Ministry of Public Health in Yaoundé, the capital, but whose legacy is decidedly mixed. The book is a revealing, refreshing and entertaining read, written in French and translated into English by Amy Reid.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nBeyond the Door of No Return\n\nby David Diop\n\nBeyond the Door of No Return by David Diop is a historical novel that opens in France, but is set mainly in 18th-century Senegal, at the height of the slave trade. It's the story of a French botanist, Michel Adanson, and what befell him after going to the island of Saint-Louis in Senegal. As he writes to his daughter, \"Things did not go the way I planned. I made the voyage to Senegal to discover plants, and instead I encountered people.\"\n\nDiop won the International Booker Prize in 2021 for his work of historical fiction set in World War I, At Night All Blood Is Black.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe Black Crescent\n\nby Jane Johnson\n\nThe Black Crescent by British novelist Jane Johnson is a lovely work of historical fiction that introduces you to the world of 1950s Morocco, at the time of the country's struggle for independence from France. The main character, Hamou Badi, is from a mountain village but ends up becoming a policeman and working in Casablanca. The author, Jane Johnson, has set a number of her novels in Morocco where she met her husband, Abdel Bakrim, and now lives for half the year (see below for the story of how that happened!). As well as being a good story, the book is a nice way of learning about Morocco's recent history alongside her.\n\nRead expert recommendations"
