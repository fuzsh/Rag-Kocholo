        "text": "The Nandoâs story started centuries ago, when the Portuguese explorers set sail for the East. The winds of Africa called them ashore and it was there that they were introduced to the African Birdâs Eye Chilli â more commonly known as PERi-PERi. A spice like no other, they used it to create a unique PERi-PERi sauce that put fire in their bellies and ignited passion in their souls.\n\nIt was the same PERi-PERi flavour that inspired Fernando Duarte to invite his friend Robbie Brozin to a humble Portuguese eatery in the heart of Rosettenville, South Africa in 1987. After just one bite of the mouth-watering PERi-PERi marinated and basted chicken, they knew it was a taste that had to be shared.\n\nRight from the start, our two founders had great ambitions for their small business. The next few years passed in a blur of long hours and hot kitchens. Riding on the back of their foodâs growing reputation, Robbie and Fernando opened a second restaurant, in Savoy, North Johannesburg. And then another - always flying by the seat of their pants, taking risks, feeling as though they could fail at any moment.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the founders wanted Nandoâs to be more than chicken and profit. Their slogan in the early days was âhave fun and then make moneyâ but always in the right way, giving people opportunities and making a positive impact on their lives.\n\nThe rest is history! Today, you can find Nandoâs restaurants and our addictive grocery range right around the world. Whether youâre a first-time visitor or an old friend, we canât wait to welcome you!"
