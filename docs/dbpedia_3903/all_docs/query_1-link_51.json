        "text": "For many people, it is hard to believe that African novels have been in existence for over a hundred years. Thomas Mofolo’s Traveller to the East was published in 1907 and long before that, there were mining novels being published in South Africa in the 19th century.\n\nThis guide is, in part, an attempt to change this misconception held by many readers that African novels worth reading go only as far back as the 1950s with the publication of Things Fall Apart.\n\nReaders are invited to follow the African novel as it evolves through the decades—taking on different questions, experimenting with forms and ideas, and, at every step, seeking out new ways to stay delightful, relevant, and captivating.\n\nYou may have encountered other guides to African novels in the past, but here is what is different about this one. It reinvents African novels for the reader who delights in the pure joy of a good story.\n\nYou’ll notice that in describing these novels I focus on what is exciting about the story, the style, or the aesthetic choice that the author makes. I consciously stayed away from describing these novels in terms of their themes or the social issues they explore. The reason for this is quite simple: my goal is to attract readers who want to—in the most cliché sense—fall in love with African novels.\n\nNote: Why is there only one novel per decade? The Guide is an on-going project that I plan to expand on a monthly basis.\n\n***\n\nPick a Decade\n\n1900’s\n\n1910’s\n\n1920’s\n\n1930’s\n\n1940’s\n\n1950’s\n\n1960’s\n\n1970’s\n\n1980’s\n\n1990’s\n\n2000’s\n\n2010’s\n\nThe 1900’s\n\nTraveler To The East\n\nBy Thomas Mofolo\n\n1907\n\nLesotho\n\nYou are about to read one of the oldest African novels.\n\nPublished in 1907, Traveler to the East is more than a century old!\n\nIn 1908, a very excited reader wrote this to Leselinyana, the newspaper where Traveler to the East was first serialized: “Oh, that book, my friends! […] I am extremely happy about it.” The story follows the life of handsome but troubled Fekisi.\n\nLiving in a Sodom and Gomorrah kind of world where men and women had grown calloused from repeated acts of violence, Fekisi’s pure heart made him a social misfit. It certainly didn’t help that his work as a herdboy gave him way too much time to ask questions about God, life, and nature. Frustrated with the wickedness around him, obsessed with the thought of finding redemption, Fekisi abandons family and land and heads east to a mythical land where he hopes to encounter God.\n\nThe charm of the book is Fekisi’s poetic expressions. For a travel story, Traveller to the East isn’t as action-packed as you’d expect. But what it loses in drama, it gains in a gushing poetic intensity. The novel is all about the powerful emotions and intense feelings of a troubled soul conveyed in string of beautiful lyrical moments.\n\nGet this novel here.\n\nThe 1910’s\n\nEthiopia Unbound\n\nBy Casely Hayford\n\nPublished in 1911\n\nGhana\n\nEthiopia Unbound is a philosophical tale set in London and various cities in Ghana.\n\nKwamankra is a Ghanaian law student. Whitely, his British buddy, studies theology. They couldn’t be more different, except that they both share a fascination with Roman antiquity.\n\nThey take long walks along Tottenham Court Road, hang out in Kwamankra’s apartment, and do a whole lot of talking and arguing about everything from Marcus Aurelius to Christ to the African idea of divinity.\n\nKwamankra and Whitely will both end up in Ghana where the plot continues to drift along meditations and philosophical riffs on freeing Africa from Europe’s capture; hence the title Ethiopia Unbound. Get it? A play on the Greek drama Prometheus Unbound. Like any philosophical tale, Ethiopia Unbound is all talk and no drama. But there’s a sprinkle of fun episodes and anecdotes to keep things exciting.\n\nGet this novel here.\n\nThe 1920’s\n\nChaka\n\nThomas Mofolo\n\n1923\n\nLesotho\n\nChaka is a re-imagining of a true-life story about a 19th century Zulu king.\n\nBut it is, at bottom, simply a folkloric thriller about a ruthless African king playing at the game of thrones.\n\nCombining spine-chilling violence, military genius, charisma, and a good bit of black magical arts, Chaka conquers surrounding nations and brings the Zulu people under his rule. In a perverse but beautifully dramatic turn of events, Chaka would become captive to his own lust for blood and power. This sets in motion the series of event that would lead to his downfall.\n\nThe thread of political suspense in novel is woven around Chaka’s star-crossed love affair with the beautiful Noliwa. As Noliwa would learn—albeit too late—it’s as easy as it is dangerous to fall for a man like Chaka.\n\nMofolo’s political drama will pull you in to the very last breath!\n\nGet this novel here.\n\nThe 1930’s\n\nForest of A Thousand Daemons\n\nBy D. O. Fagunwa\n\nPublished in 1938\n\nNigeria\n\nGet set to read one of the most cherished books in the small but rich genre of African fantasy.\n\nForest of A Thousand Daemons follows the story of a hunter named Akara-Ogun. He goes on daredevil expeditions into an old forest haunted by creatures too strange and ghoulish to describe. But because he has just the right amount of luck and magical powers to save him from his reckless wanderings and dangerous encounters, he is able to live to tell some of the most hair-raising stories ever told.\n\nBest for readers with an appetite for supernatural stories about monsters, spirits, and alternate realities.\n\nWole Soyinka gave the novel a second life when he translated it into English—a project he began while he was in prison.\n\nGet this novel here.\n\nThe 1940’s\n\nCry, the Beloved Country\n\nAlan Paton\n\nPublished in 1948\n\nSouth Africa\n\nAlan Paton was in a Norwegian Cathedral when he conceived the idea for this haunting novel about a small town Zulu priest and his desperate search for his son in the streets of Johannesburg.\n\nThe novel begins with Stephen Kumalo taking a long, arduous journey to Johannesburg to care for his sick sister. When he arrives, things are much worse than he imagined. His son, who’d traveled there to make a better life for himself, has gone missing. Searching for his son takes Kumalo through the devious streets of one of Africa’s most enigmatic cities. But, as he soon finds out, he is not the only one searching for his son who may have committed a very heinous crime.\n\nPaton’s debut novel has been called sad and painful. But this should not stop you from reading it. The novel is less of a chore than you’d imagine. It’s a dark family saga packed with a good bit of drama.\n\nGet this novel here.\n\nThe 1950’s\n\nThings Fall Apart\n\nBy Chinua Achebe\n\nPublished in 1958\n\nNigeria\n\nChinua Achebe was only 25 when he debuted the novel that would make him into an instant literary celebrity.\n\nThe story begins with 18 year old Okonkwo and how he overcomes his lowly station in life to become a rich and famous farmer. But his charmed life goes on a downward spiral when he hacks down his foster son in an act of ritual killing.\n\nAchebe paints the life of a small 19th century African community with broad colorful strokes—ancestral festivals, wedding parties, squabbling co-wives, wrestling matches, beguiling folk tales, and catchy proverbs.\n\nAchebe is a legendary storyteller. His characters are always so real they jump right out of the page at you.\n\nThings Fall Apart was a breakout success when it came out in the late 50s. The world had and has never seen anything like it. After almost 60s years, it continues to thrill millions of readers the world over.\n\nGet this novel here.\n\nThe 1960’s\n\nSeason of Migration to the North\n\nTayeb Salih\n\nPublished in 1966\n\nSudan\n\nWho can resist a tale of kinky sex and murders!\n\nWarning bells are set off when Sa’eed, a farmer in a Sudanese village, addresses the narrator with an impeccable Oxford accent.\n\nAs the story progresses, it becomes obvious that Sa’eed is essentially a closet full of dark and sordid secrets. The narrator’s attempt to piece the puzzle of Sa’eed’s elusive past draws him into a twisted tale riddled with exotic details of seduction and murder.\n\nGet set for a mind-blowing read that blends the thrill of a crime story with the shock of steamy sex scenes.\n\nSeason of Migration to the North continues to be the greatest achievement of Salih’s unmatched gift of storytelling.\n\nGet this novel here.\n\nThe 1970’s\n\nThe House of Hunger\n\nBy Dambudzo Marechera\n\nPublished in 1978\n\nZimbabwe\n\nThe House of Hunger is not a story. It’s a “literary shock treatment.”\n\nOr, as some readers have noted, reading Marechera’s novella is like “overhearing a scream.”\n\nThere is no solid arc to the story. Just a set of disjointed incidents and jarring imageries assembled around a boy on the verge of a nervous break down.\n\nHe is joined in this surrealist urban adventure, set in a Zimbabwean slum, by a strange cast of characters—Nester the prostitute, Phillip the Intellectual, Immaculate the abused wife, Edmund the Freedom fighter, Julia the activist, and Patricia the narrator’s white girlfriend.\n\nMarechera’s fragile and deeply unsettling fictional world is best for readers with very unconventional taste.\n\nGet this novel here.\n\nThe 1980’s\n\nSo Long a Letter\n\nBy Mariama Ba\n\nPublished in 1981\n\nSenegal\n\nBa’s purse-size novella is a book of timeless appeal.\n\nThe plot unravels around two Dakar wives—Ramatoulaye and Aissatou.\n\nIn the isolation of mourning, Ramatoulaye pens a long letter to Aissatou now living in far away America.\n\nShe chronicles their lives as bright-eyed schoolteachers in 1960s Senegal guided in their social and romantic lives by feminist fervor.\n\nIt’s a wonderful telling of what it means to be young, ambitious, and female in late 20th century Dakar—the complications of desiring independence in a world of restraints and of wanting to be loved on your own terms in a world where a man’s desire was considered more legitimate than that of a woman.\n\nSo Long a Letter is not just a novel about heartbreak. It is a beautiful homage to female bond and friendship\n\nGet this novel here.\n\nThe 1990’s\n\nSecrets\n\nBy Nuruddin Farah\n\n1998\n\nSomalia\n\nFarah’s dark, family psychodrama is a compelling read.\n\nWhen it came out in 1998, the novel marked one of the crowning moments of the 20th century in the African literary scene.\n\nIt tells the story of a Somali family straining under the mystery of a past that refuses to be kept secret.\n\nKalaman is a successful businessman. Sholoongo is a sexy sorcerer. When they reunite after 30 years and she tells him she has to have his baby, Kalaman is freaked out. He retreats into his past bent on confronting the suspicious he’s always had about his origins.\n\nMogadishu, Somalia’s major city, is dark and dreamy in this story where life shifts uneasily between the world of the spirits, magic, myth and everyday reality.\n\nSecrets is a patchwork of mysterious events woven into layers of sexual tension and magical realism.\n\nSalman Rushdie couldn’t be more accurate when he called Farah “one of the finest contemporary African novelists.”\n\nGet this novel here.\n\nThe 2000’s\n\nAfrican Psycho\n\nBy Alain Mabanckou\n\nPublished in 2003\n\nCongo\n\nAfrican Psycho begins with the shocking confession: “I have decided to kill Germaine on December 29.” These are the words of ugly Gregoire who dreams of becoming a celebrity murderer.\n\nHe has played and replayed the scene of Germaine’s murder in his head, each time more elaborately brutal than the last. But there is just one problem. Gregoire is too oafish and cowardly to kill anyone.\n\nThis contemporary Congolese classic is a humorous stroll through the mind of the most awkward killer-wannabee the world has ever known.\n\nReading African Psycho is a wild ride through the sordid fantasies of a tortured anti-hero. There is the added pleasure of simply reveling in the aesthetics of murder as scene after scene of possible murders are imagined but never executed.\n\nGet this novel here.\n\nThe 2010’s\n\nThe Shining Girls\n\nBy Lauren Beukes\n\nPublished in 2013\n\nSouth Africa\n\nWhen someone tells you a novel is about a time-traveling serial killer, you stop everything you’re doing and you read it.\n\nThe Shining Girls the fourth novel by South Africa’s leading speculative fiction writer, is a fast-paced, bone-chilling thriller.\n\nIt tells the story of Harper Curtis and the women he brutally murdered. Curtis isn’t your ordinary serial killer. He has this magical ability to go through time, killing women and getting away with it since no one can connect the murders. But his luck runs out when one of his victims survives his deadly assault and swears to take revenge.\n\nThe setting, the story, and the characters have nothing to do with Africa. The Shinning Girls is a Chicago story. Beukes is part of a fast-growing circle of African novelists pushing the boundaries on what is an African novel. The fact that she doesn’t have to justify her choice to write an American story captures the experimental culture in the contemporary African scene."
