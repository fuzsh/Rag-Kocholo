        "text": "1984\n\nCity Locations\n\nWaxahachie, TX (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nMuseum, Riverside\n\nLocation Styles\n\nAmericana/Anywhere, Craftsman, Building Dated/Retro, Colonial, Georgian/Southern, Ranch Style\n\nAbout Places in the Heart\n\nEmbrace a piece of cinematic history with Places in the Heart, a moving drama that masterfully portrays the struggles and victories of the human spirit during the Great Depression. Directed by the illustrious Robert Benton, this film debuted in 1984. The protagonist, a young widow named Edna Spalding (Sally Field), lives in the 1935 Texas hamlet of Waxahachie. Upon her husband's passing, she is abandoned to tend to her farm alone. Amusing characters like Moses \"Moze\" Hadner (Danny Glover) arrive and help enrich the plot. A superb ensemble cast joins Field, including John Malkovich, Lindsay Crouse, Amy Madigan, and Ed Harris. The characters are intertwined with the compelling storyline in their harrowing struggle to keep the farm afloat. As a moving ode to the power of the human spirit, the ensemble brilliantly portrays each member's trials and victories. The multiple accolades that Places in the Heart received after its premiere further added to its enduring praise. As for the Academy Awards, Sally Field took home the top prize for actress, and Robert Benton took home the trophy for best original screenplay. Another honor Benton received at the 35th Berlin International Film Festival was Best Director. The film has received an 89% rating from 38 critics on the review aggregation platform Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 8.00/10. Meanwhile, on Metacritic, it has garnered a score of 70%, indicating \"generally favorable reviews,\" based on feedback from 12 critics.\n\nPlaces in the Heart Locations\n\nPlaces in the Heart is a visually compelling experience, primarily due to the diverse settings where it was filmed. Most of the filming took place in the North Texas city of Waxahachie, noted for its beautiful architecture and rich history. Set in Waxahachie, the \"Movie Capital of Texas,\" this critically praised picture had the ideal backdrop. Incorporating the picturesque North Texas landscape with its endearing Southern architecture gave the story more substance and realism. Key landmarks in Waxahachie featured in the film include the historic Ellis County Courthouse, a stunning example of Victorian architecture that dominates the cityscape. Due to its cinematic significance and architectural grandeur, it's a must-visit for any film enthusiast or history buff. Further enhancing the filmâs realism, scenes set at the cotton gin were filmed in Five Points, a small community in Texas renowned for its agricultural landscapes. The bank sequences were brought to life at The Rogers Hotel Apartments on N College St in Waxahachie, a classic establishment that harks back to the grandeur of a bygone era. A trip to these locations would undoubtedly be worthwhile. They offer an opportunity to step into the world of Places in the Heart and explore the cultural richness of North Texas. Whether you're a fan of the film, a history enthusiast, or someone who appreciates the charm of Southern architecture and landscapes, these filming locations promise a memorable visit.\n\nAs the opening credits roll, the audience is treated to the soulful strains of the famous Protestant hymn, \"Blessed Assurance.\" The camera pans across the expansive Central Texas prairie, capturing snippets of life in this small town: people leaving church, families enjoying Sunday dinner at home, a homeless African-American man seeking a meal, and a woman living in her car. A series of images appear on screen, accompanied by the film's soundtrack. These scenes were filmed at various locations, including the Ellis County Courthouse. The courthouse, people leaving a church, the poor and homeless, and a long, lonely country road are some of the iconic visuals presented. Some of these scenes were shot at the Ellis County Courthouse, a building celebrated for its intricate \"Pecos Red\" sandstone carvings and compelling Romanesque Revival architecture. Constructed in 1891, J. Riely Gordon designed the courthouse, a notable embodiment of his distinct architectural style. The building has been meticulously restored, preserving county and district courtrooms and century-old judge benches. Modern systems, state-of-the-art audio-visual equipment, security, and acoustic treatments have been seamlessly integrated into the historic spaces. Visitors interested in exploring this architectural marvel should contact the administration for possible visitation. To reach Ellis County Courthouse from Dallas, take the I-35E S towards Waxahachie. From Waxahachie, it's a short drive to the courthouse. Please note public transportation options may not be available.\n\nEdna (Sally Field) visits the downtown bank. She converses with Mr. Albert Denby (Lane Smith), asking him to teach her how to write a check. She also shares that she has hired an African-American man to assist her, offering her valuable advice on cotton farming. This scene is pivotal as it showcases Ednaâs determination and resourcefulness in navigating an unfamiliar world of finance and farming. This memorable scene was filmed at the Rogers Hotel Apartments in Waxahachie, a historic building dating back to 1913. Named after the city's founder, Emory W. Rogers, the hotel is a testament to the city's rich history. In 1847, Emory W. Rogers established his log cabin home where the hotel now stands. This dwelling was subsequently replaced in 1856 by a two-story hotel. Tragically, a fire ravaged this structure in 1881. The present four-story tower, erected in 1912, is the work of architect C. D. Hill. The hotel became a notable landmark in Waxahachie with its welcoming rooms and suites, laid-back restaurant, and bar. Today, while you can't book a room at the Rogers Hotel, you can still visit this historic site. It now serves as commercial and retail space for local businesses. To get to the Rogers Hotel in downtown Waxahachie, take the I-35E S from Dallas. Once in Waxahachie, you can navigate to the downtown area where the hotel is located.\n\nEdna (Sally Field) and Moze (Danny Glover) visit Mr. Simmons' (Jay Patterson) Cotton Gin to buy seeds for their cotton crop. With his experienced eye, Moze quickly identifies that they are being sold lower-grade seeds at a higher price. When Edna confronts Mr. Simmons about the discrepancy, he intimidates Moze, labeling it an 'honest mistake.' However, Edna stands firm, and they eventually receive the higher-quality seed they paid for. The filming location for these scenes is Five Points, Texas. This unincorporated community has existed since the late 1800s and is so named due to its strategic positioning where five roads intersect. It falls under the jurisdiction of the Waxahachie Independent School District. Although it may not be a bustling city, Five Points offers its unique charm. Visitors can enjoy shopping, museums, festivals, entertainment, and more. To reach Five Points from Dallas, begin your journey on I-35E S heading towards Waxahachie. Once you arrive in Waxahachie, it's a 15-minute drive along FM 876 W to reach Five Points. Please note that public transportation options are not available. This journey into the heart of Texas history will be an enriching experience for any visitor.\n\nThere is a poignant scene where a country instrumental version of \"La Golondrina\" sets the background for Edna (Sally Field) and her husband's (Ray Baker) dance. This tranquil moment, however, is revealed to be a dream as Edna awakens to an early morning reality. She finds Mr. Will (John Malkovich) in the kitchen, busy with string beans. Exhausted and stiff from the day's labor, she shares her dream with him, half-asleep. She realizes then that they have just one more day left to pick cotton. This sequence vividly portrays the stark contrast between the comfortable lives of the townsfolk and the harsh reality of abject poverty endured by African-American individuals, a consequence of the segregation and discrimination laws prevalent during that era. This iconic scene was filmed in Waxahachie, where much of the production occurred. Established in 1850 on the creek's banks from which it got its name, Waxahachie's history is deeply entwined with that of Texas. The city's historic homes and buildings, prominently featured in the film, attract tourists. Visitors flock to Waxahachie to explore its antique shops, specialty stores, and boutiques and to participate in the numerous festivals and events held throughout the year. To reach Waxahachie from Dallas, you can take a short drive on the I-35E S. The road will take 30 minutes. It's an easy and scenic journey of around 30 miles, making Waxahachie a perfect day trip destination from the Metroplex.\n\nPlaces in the Heart is a moving film that perfectly portrays the essence of rural Texas in the 1930s. The writing, acting, and genuine portrayal of a specific era in American history in Places in the Heart have contributed substantially to the cinema industry. This demonstrates cinema's ability to take viewers to other worlds and eras. Despite numerous narrative shortcomings, Places in the Heart is worth seeing for its outstanding performances, appealing cinematography, and vivid depiction of rural Texas in the 1930s. Going to Waxahachie to learn where the movie was shot would be a great way to learn about the city's history and culture."
