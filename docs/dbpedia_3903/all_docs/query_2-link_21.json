        "text": "Story\n\n04 October 2023\n\nWomen owning the ‘menstrual economy’: South African entrepreneur changing lives through a thriving sanitary pads manufacturing venture\n\nOver the past few years, there have been concerted efforts to lift the veil on the taboo and stigma around menstrual hygiene. Not only have there been calls for sanitary products to be freely available but there have been conversations around who owns the means of production of these essential products.\n\nLindiwe Nkuna-Kgopa, 40, started thinking about putting her ring in the hat of what she calls the menstrual economy in 2015 after following these conversations and realized that in South Africa there were no women-owned, large-scale, manufacturers of sanitary products that can compete with the big suppliers. This was the start of Lindiwe Sanitary Pads which today not only sells to individual customers but supplies the South African government’s National Sanitary Dignity Programme in four provinces. In 2022 alone Lindiwe Sanitary Pads reached 10 000 girls, supplying them with a year’s supply of sanitary pads through the government’s programme, combatting period poverty. “When I started Lindiwe Sanitary Pads I felt it was unfair that women are only end-users of sanitary pads and decided we needed to be active in the menstrual economy. We need to be part of the entire value chain. Menstruation is a huge economy and it’s interesting that with all the taboos and stigma that have existed around menstruation, when it comes to the boardroom where the rands and cents are counted, suddenly men can talk about periods and get involved in the manufacturing and selling of pads,” says Nkuna-Kgopa. “Initially when I approached funders they’d turn down my applications because they said I didn’t have a manufacturing background. I had never even set foot in a factory! So they’d said ‘you don’t have the technical know-how. You are unbankable!’’ she says. An entrepreneur at heart, having previously dabbled in marketing and accounting, Nkuna-Kgopa took the rejection in her stride and decided to build the profile of a reputable sanitary pads manufacturer. When Lindiwe Sanitary pads started in 2018 the business focused on branding, packaging, and distributing sanitary pads purchased from an external manufacturer. But what the entrepreneur quickly learned is that being product-ready and having greater access to markets is costly and requires knowledge. UN Women South Africa Multi-Country Office (SAMCO), supported by NAMA Women Advancement, implemented a series of business coaching and mentoring workshops that equipped Nkuna-Kgopa and other businesswomen with the essential skills for running profitable and sustainable businesses. She is also one of the entrepreneurs on UN Women’s Buy From Women platform, which links clients who want to procure from women-owned entrepreneurs with such suppliers. “The process for getting your product ready, running it through the necessary tests, and meeting potential big clients is quite expensive. For example, traveling to meet a potential big client in Cape Town, at your own expense, is quite demanding. That’s why the programs run by UN Women for women entrepreneurs are invaluable. They trained us then put us in spaces where we can create linkages with market-potentials and eventually take advantage ,’’ says Nkuna-Kgopa. She was one of the women entrepreneurs sponsored by UN Women SAMCO through NAMA Women Advancement’s support, to attend the Africa Women in Trade Conference and Expo in Cape Town in 2022. This is where Nkuna-Kgopa met a contact who introduced her to a major client that not only bought a large supply of Lindiwe Sanitary Pads products but will also be pushing out the products into the rest of the African continent. Additionally, the contact enabled her to meet clients who took an interest in the business and provided letters of intent that have unlocked funding for Lindiwe Sanitary Pads to build a 3 500sqm factory. Additionally, her business is in the process of procuring what will be South Africa’s second-largest sanitary pads manufacturing machine which will produce 850 units per minute. Lindiwe Sanitary Pads currently employs 92 women in its peak seasons and 16 women in the quieter production periods. Nkuna-Kgopa highlights that automating the manufacturing process will not kill these jobs but grow the company’s output and revenue, allowing these women to be more securely and sustainably employed in other areas of the company. The machine is much-needed as the business expands its reach from supplying wholesalers and independent pharmacies to supplying two major retailers ’house brands. UN Women SAMCO has partnered with the South Africa Department of Women, Youth, and People with Disabilities to enhance the capacity of women-owned enterprises in the Sanitary Dignity value chain. The Sanitary Dignity Implementation Framework (SDIF) aims to ensure dignified menstruation management while promoting women’s economic empowerment.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n20 September 2023\n\nWe have a duty to leave no one behind, South African President tells world leaders\n\n“Over millennia, the human race has demonstrated an enormous capacity for resilience, adaptation, innovation, compassion and solidarity … these qualities must be evident in how we work together as a global community and as nations of the world to end war and conflict,” he said. He urged the international community to invest in conflict prevention and peacebuilding, and supported Secretary-General António Guterres’ call for sustainable and predictable financing for peacebuilding efforts. He also expressed concern about unconstitutional changes of government in parts of Africa and stressed the need for collaboration with the African Union to support peace efforts across the continent. Empower women President Ramaphosa also highlighted the importance of empowering women, advocating for gender equality and equal access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. Noting that women represented 50 per cent of South Africa’s cabinet, and that he was being accompanied at the General Assembly this year by an all-women delegation, he called for greater female representation on the global stage. He also voiced concerns over rising global temperatures, noting that 17 of world’s “climate hotspots” were in Africa. “Africa is least responsible for the climate damage that has been caused, yet it bears the greatest burden,” he said, calling on world leaders to accelerate decarbonization while pursuing shared prosperity. Security Council reform President Ramaphosa also highlighted the need for inclusive, democratic, and representative international institutions. “The recently held BRICS summit in Johannesburg also affirmed the voice that the UN Security Council should be reformed and ensure that those nations that are not represented must be represented,” he said, referring to the recent meeting held by his country alongside Russia, India and China. Concluding his remarks, the South African leader urged all nations to demonstrated that “we have the both the will and the resolve” to secure a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable future for our world and more importantly, for the generations that will follow. “Leaving no one behind – that is the duty that we all have,” he said, recalling the guiding promise made by the international community with the adoption in 2015 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. FULL STATEMENT HERE\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n12 January 2024\n\nGAZA: South Africa levels accusations of ‘genocidal conduct’ against Israel at world court\n\nThe development came amid the ongoing and massive Israeli bombardment across the Gaza Strip in response to Hamas-led terror attacks on 7 October that left some 1,200 Israeli and foreign nationals dead in southern Israel and some 250 taken hostage. Laying out their case, the South African legal team told the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague that Israel had demonstrated a “pattern of genocidal conduct” since launching its full-scale war in Gaza, the 365 square kilometre strip of land it has occupied since 1967. “This killing is nothing short of destruction of Palestinian life. It is inflicted deliberately, no-one is spared, not even newborn babies,” the court heard. Unprecedented violence Israel’s actions had subjected the 2.3 million people of Gaza to an unprecedented level of attacks from the air, land and sea, resulting in the deaths of thousands of civilians and the destruction of homes and essential public infrastructure, insisted Adila Hassim. Israel had also prevented sufficient humanitarian aid from reaching those in need and created the risk of death by starvation and disease because of the impossibility of providing assistance “while bombs fall”, the South Africa lawyer alleged. “Palestinians in Gaza are subject to relentless bombing wherever they go,” Ms. Hassim told the court, adding that so many people had been killed that they were often buried unidentified in mass graves. An additional 60,000 Palestinians had been wounded and maimed, she noted. “They are killed in their homes, in places where they seek shelter, in hospitals, in schools, in mosques, in churches, and as they tried to find food and water for their families. They have been killed if they have failed to evacuate the places to which they have fled and even if they attempted to flee along Israeli-declared safe routes.” As part of its claim against Israel, South Africa alleges that 6,000 bombs hit Gaza in the first week of the Israeli response to the Hamas-led attacks. This included the use of 2,000-pound bombs at least 200 times “in southern areas of the Strip that were designated as safe”, and in the north, where refugee camps were located, Ms. Hassim said. These weapons were “some of the biggest and most destructive bombs available”, she maintained, adding that genocides “are never declared in advance, but this court has the benefit of the past 13 weeks of evidence that shows incontrovertibly a pattern of conduct and related intention that justifies a plausible claim of genocidal acts”. Convention’s obligations It was because of these actions that Israel had contravened the Genocide Convention, the ICJ judges later heard, in reference to the global treaty inked by Members of the United Nations after the Second World War to prevent crimes against humanity. The Convention was “dedicated to saving humanity”, insisted John Dugard, also representing South Africa, and all countries that had signed up to the Convention “are obliged not only to desist from genocidal acts but also to prevent them”, he maintained. The hearing continues on Friday with the Israeli presentation. Rights chief Türk rejects ‘blood libel’ In a related development, the UN’s top human rights official has defended criticism of the invasion of Gaza, saying that it is “not antisemitic” to call out “gross violations” of international humanitarian law. Writing in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Wednesday, Volker Türk once again strongly condemned “the shocking cruelty of the attack launched from Gaza by Hamas and other armed groups on October 7”. The massacres that ensued created “intense and continuing trauma\" across Israel”, the UN rights chief continued, before insisting that the country’s “campaign of overwhelming force” had been “tainted by grave breaches of international law”. Rocket fire from Gaza into Israel has also continued, Mr. Türk noted, before expressing regret that some Israeli officials had tried to discredit his Office’s concerns by claiming that they constitute \"blood libel\". “It is not a blood libel to deplore the failure to hold to account Israeli soldiers and armed settlers who have killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank since October 7, or the prolongation of a war whose conduct has raised grave international humanitarian and human rights law concerns,” the UN rights chief stressed. Diplomacy continues in New York And diplomats at UN Headquarters in New York continue to seek more consensus over the Israel-Palestine crisis, passing a resolution in the Security Council Thursday night aimed at containing the spillover from the Gaza war. Ambassadors demanded that Houthi rebels on the Red Sea coast of Yemen end their attacks on international shipping, which the rebels say are in support of Palestinians and Hamas militants. And on Friday afternoon, a meeting of the Security Council is due to take place to discuss concerns over the potential forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, at the request of new Council member, Algeria.\n\n1 of 5\n\nPress Release\n\n28 August 2023\n\nUniting Against Hate: UN South Africa and partners join forces to combat Hate Speech\n\nJOHANNESBURG, 22 June, 2023 – The United Nations in South Africa in partnership with the Apartheid Museum, the Desmond Tutu Foundation and the Johannesburg Holocaust and Genocide Centre, Media Monitoring Africa (MMA) hosted a panel discussion and a training workshop on hate speech and mis/disinformation to commemorate the International Day for Countering Hate Speech. The overall goal of the event was to bring awareness to and discuss hate speech and mis/disinformation as well as to equip participants with knowledge and practical skills on how to address these ills online. In his speech, Mr. Nelson Muffuh, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in South Africa, emphasized the UN's commitment to “upholding the principles of human rights, non-discrimination and the right of every individual to be treated with respect and dignity regardless of their nationality, race, religion, gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation. These are precisely the principles and rights that hate speech seeks to suppress.” Mr. Muffuh also stressed that countering hate speech is a moral obligation that falls on all of us, whether we are government authorities, civil society organizations, the private sector, the media, youth, traditional and customary leaders, or simply individuals. He added that hate speech has a devastating impact on social cohesion, human relations, and safety, and that we must do everything in our power to combat it. Speaking on a panel, Abigail Noko, Regional Representative for Southern Africa, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) called for collective efforts towards building positive jurisprudence, saying that states have a mandate to safeguard human rights and must be liable to address incitement of racial discrimination and tackle hate speech. Janet Jobson, Chief Executive Officer, Desmond and Leah Tutu Foundation, in her message of support called for vigilance around misinformation and disinformation, as hate speech is becoming more prevalent in our society. “We must ensure that we do not fall into the logic of hatred and must not let hatred stand unchallenged. Our humanity is fundamentally bound up with each other and, we must counter hate speech whenever and wherever we encounter it,” said Ms. Jobson. William Bird, Director of Media Monitoring Africa, also weighed in on the subject and the event saying, “Hate speech doesn’t just cause harm, it incites violence and undermines democracy. We commemorate the International Day for Countering Hate Speech recognizing our recent past, aware that some still seek to use hate speech to silence, bully, denigrate and rob people of their dignity. We all have a responsibility to combat and call out hate speech, but just what is it and how can we do so? Join us as we hear from experts and launch our course to empower the public to act against hate speech online.” The panellist included Tali Nates, Director, Johannesburg Holocaust and Genocide Centre, Ben Winks, Independent Advocate and Thandi Smith, Head of Programmes, Media Monitoring Africa and focused on “Understanding hate speech from a legal standpoint, its impact on victims and their human rights and, strategies being employed to combat the scourge.” The participants also had a chance for some insight and messages from Alice Nderitu, UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Janet Jobson, CEO of the Desmond and Leah Tutu Foundation and Honourable Ourveena Geereesha Topsy-Soono, African Commission on Human and People’s Rights Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa. MMA also launched a programme on hate speech training. Dubbed Hate Speech Spotters Programme (HSSP). The goal is to bring awareness to hate speech, its impact on victims/target groups online, as well as how and why spreading such content is harmful and hurtful. The HSSP is designed for both those who have disseminated or are purveyors of online harms.

The diversity of languages spoken in South Africa is greatly influenced by indigenous languages. It is crucial for their preservation that the media use and promote them. Sadly, there has been a loss in the understanding and usage of indigenous languages, particularly among young people, and less usage of indigenous languages by the media. The seminar sought to discuss and resolve these problems by bringing together key players, such as PanSALB and well-known indigenous language practitioners and media personalities, in order to have open discussions and to start dialogues that could result in practical solutions after the seminar. In his remarks, Mr. Tafirenyika highlighted the UN’s role and efforts through the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in saving indigenous languages around the world as well as the lessons learned thus far. “The UN is therefore appealing to all South Africans, including the government, the business sector, the civil society and individuals to do everything in their power to protect and promote linguistic diversity. Such an approach will strengthen, not weaken, our collective cultural heritage. And I can’t but fail to notice that this conference is taking place in September, which is South Africa’s heritage month,” he said. He told participants that one of the most effective ways to preserve indigenous languages was to develop effective mechanisms for advocacy and awareness campaigns. “This is where the role of our partners in the media becomes crucial. Let me take this opportunity to commend the SABC, the national public broadcaster, for running radio stations with programmes that are broadcast in all the 11 official languages of South Africa.” The UNIC director urged the media to promote and protect linguistic diversity and form partnerships to preserve cultural diversity and respect traditional ways of life. Governments should enact laws to conserve indigenous languages, such as mobilizing funding, defending linguistic rights, and incorporating these languages into educational systems. He further emphasized that “education is the main instrument in our toolbox of language preservation”. The necessity of information, which is key to participation in a democracy was highlighted by Professor Abiodun Salawu, a professor of Journalism, Communication, and Media Studies at the North West University, and Director of the research entity, Indigenous Language Media in Africa (ILMA). The media has a role to inform the masses in a language they will understand, he said. Prof. Salawu told his audience that the development of alternative media and the use of regional languages and creoles have been key factors in the evolution of participation issues, which are essential to democracy. He urged the media to take all the indigenous languages to platforms that the youth can relate with such as social media and reminded attendees that “indigenous language media still remain a potent vehicle for mobilizing people for positive (developmental) goals which include democracy.” In his address, Lance Schultz, the PanSALB Chief Executive Officer called for the end to “social linguistic tribalism which is essentially a lack of respect for our indigenous languages. We must be intentional with how we communicate for an informed and engaged citizenry,” he added. “The global decline of print media has negatively affected the development of indigenous languages. Therefore, the need to forge collaborative efforts between the media, parents, teachers and various other stakeholders to promote indigenous languages is now more pertinent than ever.” The Treasurer-General of SANEF, Tshamano Makhadi, reaffirmed his organization’s commitment to serve the needs of community media and open opportunities for the development of indigenous languages in this sector and beyond. “This proactive stance not only strengthens the vital role of community media but also fosters inclusivity and cultural diversity, creating a richer tapestry of voices in our ever-evolving media landscape, he said, adding: “Through its steadfast efforts, SANEF paves the way for a more inclusive and vibrant media ecosystem, where indigenous languages can flourish, and communities can thrive.” The recognition of the media's pivotal role in reaching diverse audiences underscores the importance of broadcasting in indigenous languages. As the current media landscape predominantly operates in English, there is an urgent imperative to document, educate, and fortify the usage of indigenous languages. Embracing technology and fostering innovation becomes paramount in this endeavor, encompassing initiatives like translating books and dictionaries into indigenous languages and developing accessible mobile apps and online platforms. Moreover, the formulation of laws and policies, aligned with UN frameworks such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, becomes imperative to ensure the preservation and prosperity of indigenous languages for the betterment of all humanity. This multifaceted approach not only enriches people’s cultural fabric but also champions inclusivity and linguistic diversity in the global media landscape.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n19 August 2024\n\nUNICEF and BMW Group partner upto bridge the STEM gap\n\nTo help address South Africa’s skills gap and high youth unemployment, BMW Group has partnered with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) on an initiative called BRIDGE. The project aims to do just that: to bridge the gap between learning and earning. It focuses on empowering young people by strengthening science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education across the country, at a time when millions of STEM-related jobs globally are projected to be unfilled due to a lack of qualified candidates. The BRIDGE initiative took centre stage at the latest Mail & Guardian Critical Thinking Forum themed “Educating young people for tomorrow, today”, held in partnership with BMW Group South Africa and UNICEF South Africa on 1 August 2024 in Sandton. “In this fast-changing world, new skill sets are required, and we must be discussing the balance between hard and soft skills,” said UNICEF Deputy Representative Irfan Akhtar. “Because the skills needed by past generations are not the same skills needed today.” The event brought together government, education, industry experts and youth advocates to discuss the future of STEM education in the country and engage with the critical challenge of equipping young people with the skills needed for tomorrow’s job market. BMW Group Head of Corporate Social Responsibility Tebogo Ramagoshi set the tone for the discussion by outlining the reach and impact of the BRIDGE partnership since its inception in 2023: “This initiative shows that as the private sector, we can be part of the solution, and support the government and organisations like UNICEF to ensure that STEM-skills are embedded from a young age, so that no child is left behind.”She says that over the past year, the BRIDGE partnership has trained over 570 educators from six provinces in coding and robotics: “We have also trained 90 subject specialists from all provinces to support these educators. This has benefited 36 000 learners from 100 schools. By the end of the year, we hope to have reached 50 000 learners. In addition one coding and robotics lab has been established, and four more will be before the end of the year.”STEM skills to bridge the gap The forum took place against South Africa’s groundbreaking plans to develop a coding and robotics curriculum for learners from a young age. “We are the first country in the world to introduce coding and robotics as an official subject from Grade R,” announced Seliki Tlhabane, Chief Director at the Department of Basic Education (DBE), during the panel discussion. This is significant, considering that globally the sector is worth about $3 billion. He was joined in conversation by Mbasa Kepe, Head of Government and External Affairs at BMW Group South Africa and Hana Yoshimoto, UNICEF South Africa’s Chief of Education. Tlhabane explained that the BRIDGE partnership’s goals of strengthening educators’ capacity to deliver STEM education, promoting and improving robotics and coding facilities in schools, and providing access to job shadowing and mentorship opportunities for learners and young people aligned with national plans and the department’s commitment to improving STEM education nationwide. “Technology is not the enemy and should not be seen as a threat,” he emphasised. “It is a resource and an opportunity.” Future-proofed skills for the workplace of tomorrowHe said that while artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation might be new, conversations surrounding future-proofed skills were not. “We have been asking questions about what skills our children might need since the beginning of time, and at the dawn of each new industrial revolution,” he said. He acknowledged, however, that the pace of change currently experienced was unprecedented in human history: “We need long-term solutions for a fast evolving world. The jobs of tomorrow are driven by technology, and technology, on its own, is a product of STEM. That is why this conversation is critical.”Yoshimoto agreed that improved access to quality STEM education is critical to prepare young people for future work opportunities and nurturing tech-savvy entrepreneurs, especially given South Africa’s stubbornly high unemployment rate of around 35.5%. “STEM education and digital skills development can be used to impact the lives of vulnerable young people, and investing in this is a way to narrow the skills gap and bridge the digital divide,” she emphasised.“STEM is very crucial for the future lives of young people. It is not just for work, it’s for day-to-day lives.” Balancing skills and opportunities While the panel acknowledged STEM as a turbo-charger of global economic strength, the discussion also highlighted the importance of balancing technical know-how and essential soft skills such as critical thinking, creativity and collaboration. This, stressed Yoshimoto, would be critical to help learners navigate social issues and prepare them for a competitive labour market: “The jobs of tomorrow will require not just technical proficiency, but also adaptability, problem-solving and interpersonal skills. By strengthening STEM education and soft skills, we aim to improve the transition from learning to earning, especially for the most vulnerable learners in disadvantaged communities.”A key point of discussion was the need for innovative approaches to ensure equitable access to these educational opportunities, especially for rural learners. Key challenges include a lack of equipment and the cost of new technologies, which become outdated and should be replaced every seven years. To ensure that every child benefits from the new curriculum, the department announced that it is rolling out both “plugged” and “unplugged” coding programmes, the latter of which does not require computers or equipment. The panellists also explored other solutions like mobile classrooms and public-private partnerships to reach students in all communities, regardless of their socioeconomic background. Public-private partnerships are keyThe private sector’s role in bridging the education-employment gap was highlighted by Mbasa Kepe, BMW Group South Africa’s Head of Government and External Affairs: “Our collaboration goes beyond corporate social responsibility. It’s about creating a sustainable workforce and fostering innovation to drive our industry and the broader economy forward. Through this partnership, we address the skills gap while inspiring students from underrepresented groups to pursue STEM careers.”Tlhabane agreed that business also has an important role in “informing the government on what they need and the type of employee they envisage”. These conversations guide curriculum development and ensure work readiness. All hands on deck As South Africa grapples with a changing job market, the panellists agreed that the path forward will require a multifaceted approach that encompasses robust curricula, teacher training, industry partnerships and innovative delivery methods. And while the challenges ahead are significant, so is the collective will to overcome them. This, explained Ramagoshi, is what success would look like: “We will know that this project and this partnership have succeeded when we find ourselves coming together for our yearly robotics and coding competitions and we are met with a room full of learners from both rural and private schools, competing at the same level without visible inequalities, and every child can participate and showcase their skills because they have received the same sort of learning opportunities.” In the race to prepare for the future of work, ensuring that no child is left behind will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. “To build a bridge requires different materials, stakeholders and expertise; and to bridge this gap we need the same,” Yoshimoto explained. “No one organisation or entity can achieve this alone, and operating in silos is detrimental. South Africa has a rich ecosystem of partners supporting children and young people, but if we work in silos we don’t know how much of an impact we are making.” Communities are also responsible for safeguarding and protecting educational institutions, resources and equipment, Tlhabane added. These should be viewed as investments in comprehensive, accessible STEM education that have the power to shape the workforce, economy and society of tomorrow: We owe it to South Africa to ensure that we supply the nation with suitably qualified people who will drive the economy, and we owe it to our children to ensure that they’ve got the right skills to survive and thrive going forward.”With continued collaboration between government, international organisations, private sector partners, educational institutions and communities, South Africa is well-positioned to equip its youth for the digital age and the workplace of tomorrow.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n12 July 2024\n\n17 Global Goals- Uniting for a Sustainable World on Mandela Day\n\nTEDxJohannesburg, supported by the United Nations in South Africa, the Nelson Mandela Foundation, and the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS), brings you an unforgettable lineup of speakers and performers sharing ideas around the world's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

A highly publicised police raid one weekend in January 1967, in the Johannesburg suburb of Forest Town, resulted in the arrest of nine men for masquerading as women and participating in what was termed “indecent activity”. This incident prompted the amendment of the Act in 1968, further criminalising homosexuality. Fast forward to 2024, and there is much to celebrate, not just in South Africa but around the world, including in neighbouring Namibia, which decriminalised same-sex relations earlier this month. UNAids data shows that 124 countries do not penalise same-sex relations, the highest number to date. A number of countries have recently scrapped punitive anti-LGBTQ+ laws, often remnants of colonial rule. Since 2019, Botswana; Gabon; Angola; Bhutan; Antigua and Barbuda; Barbados; Singapore; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Cook Islands; Mauritius and Dominica have repealed laws that criminalise LGBTQ+ people. However, UNAids executive director Winnie Byanyima fears the progress made is under threat adding that “the human rights of the LGBTQ+ community are threatened by a globally coordinated and well-funded extremist anti-rights network who are spending millions promoting hate and social division and are proposing ever more draconian laws to punish LGBTQ+ people”. “Attacks on LGBTQ+ people violate human rights and undermine public health.”According to UNAids 2022 data, about 310 000 people identify as men who have sex with men and close to 180 000 people identify as transgender in South Africa. Unfortunately, due to pervasive stigma and discrimination toward the LGBTIQ+ community, the data is mostly obtained from people who choose to self-identify and disclose. In other words, stigma, discrimination, acts of murder and corrective rape against LGBTI+ people, remain a barrier to disclosure. Data from Ritshidze’s latest Community-Led Monitoring report State of Healthcare for Key Populations, February 2024, which collected data from interviews with 13 832 people across 14 healthcare facilities nationally, revealed people who are queer or trans, use drugs or engage in sex work, often face uncaring, disrespectful, cruel and abusive treatment at public health facilities. Very few people reported that facility staff were always friendly: only 35% of trans people, 33% of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, 26% of sex workers and 17% of people who use drugs. Numerous people said they were treated worse, or feared they would be, when staff found out they were a member of a key population. Equally concerning is that confidentiality violations remain common — 57% of gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men; 61% of trans people; 65% of sex workers and 74% of people who use drugs did not think privacy was respected. Discrimination is not only evidenced at some health facilities. A survey on The Lived Experience of the LGBT+ Community in South Africa in 2020, by the Inclusive Society Institute, found that, in terms of social cohesion and integration, the majority (72%) of the LGBT+ community experienced some form of discrimination in terms of social integration. Of those who confirmed having experienced discrimination, 69% experienced it in the field of education and youth development; 65% in relation to safety, security and psychosocial services; 56% in job creation, employment and seeking asylum; 48% in accessing healthcare and 31% and 22% in accessing essential services and housing, respectively. According to the South African Department of Justice and Correctional Services, in June 2021, 42 hate crimes were perpetrated against members of the LGBTIQ+ community across the country, of which 30 cases were related to murder and 12 to rape. Many of these cases remain open.In a UNAids podcast with South African transgender activist and filmmaker Zoey Black, she agrees this is true and details her experience of being assaulted in a public space because of her transgender status and “not presenting as feminine enough”.Following her disclosure in 2016, she has severed friendships and family relations because of non-acceptance of her transgender status. She is not alone. This abuse, in all its shapes and forms, coupled with isolation, resonates with many in the LGBTIQ+ community, often resulting in mental health challenges, exacerbating the physical struggles. The 2020 Inclusive Society Institute survey confirms this. In it, 24% of respondents indicated that they were suffering from some form of medical condition and 41% registered the presence of a mental health condition. Mental health issues appear to be a challenge for 53% of respondents under the age of 26. The institute believes that this requires urgent attention, as it could lead to a potential mental health crisis.In the UNAids podcast, Black adds that it was isolation and lack of relatable content that prompted her to start a YouTube channel focusing on her journey and struggle with identity, hormone replacement therapy, transgender rights and other issues affecting her community. She adds that Africans need African content on transgender rights because the dynamics of inclusivity and acceptance differ from those of her international LGBTIQ+ friends. This is why initiatives such as Pride Month matter — they afford us an opportunity to shine a spotlight on, and raise awareness of, the challenges for equality and inclusivity for all individuals, regardless of how they choose to identify. It is evident that today, more than ever, the LGBTIQ+ community needs our solidarity. Despite significant legal advancements, such as the legalisation of same-sex marriage and protections against discrimination, LGBTQ+ individuals still face high levels of violence, stigma and marginalisation. Hate crimes, corrective rape and social ostracisation remain persistent threats, particularly for transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.By shining a spotlight on these issues during Pride Month, June, we not only amplified the voices of those who have been silenced but also mobilised support for meaningful and impactful change. It is a time to advocate for comprehensive anti-discrimination laws, inclusive education and accessible healthcare services that cater to the specific needs of LGBTQ+ individuals. It is about fostering a culture of empathy and understanding, where diversity is celebrated and embraced as a source of strength, rather than a cause of division. We salute the work of our collaborating partners such as Access Chapter 2, WITS RHI, the Aurum Institute, OUT — LGBT Wellbeing and others who have specialised clinics and healthcare facilities to cater to the needs of the LGBTIQ+ community, providing the community with a space to be free in who they choose to be. However, we need to step up the momentum to ensure that all public spaces are safe spaces and health facilities can provide these services free from stigma and discrimination and with tolerance, dignity and respect.As Black says in the podcast, “it’s not what we do only in Pride Month that matters but how we follow through beyond pride that will influence consistent and impactful change,” because, ultimately, we are all advocating the same thing — that health rights are human rights. As the UNAids executive director so aptly put it, it is only by insisting on acceptance, and rejecting criminalisation, decriminalisation and stigmatisation, that we can ensure a fairer, safer future for all. We are all invited to be allies.Eva Kiwango is the country director for UNAids South Africa.First published by Mail & Guardian.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n24 June 2024\n\nVOLUNTEERISM IN SOUTH AFRICA - Celebrating the spirit of Ubuntu\n\n“Volunteerism is essential for achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” Nelson Muffuh, UN Resident Coordinator, South Africa UNV REGIONAL OFFICE TEAM VISITS PRETORIALucy Ndugu, Regional Manager for East and Southern Africa at United Nations Volunteers visited South Africa from 6 through 12 June 2024. Accompanied by Yuichiro Sakai, Portfolio Manager, David Wirtz, Partnership Associate and supported by Anthea Hurling, Country Coordinator of the Multi-Country Field Unit and her team. The objectives of this mission aimed at amplifying the Pretoria-based Multi-Country Field Unit. The Field Unit was established in February 2022 and includes UNV operations in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, and South Africa, along with encouraging partnerships with governments, UN entities, civil society organizations and the private sector. IT'S ABOUT STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPSThe mission aimed to enhance UNV’s strategic partnerships with various UN entities, including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the United Nations Resident Coordinator Office (UNRCO), International Organization for Migration (IOM), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the World Food Programme (WFP). Partner collaborations are key to mobilizing volunteers and advancing efforts in humanitarian, peace, and development initiatives. In a media interview with SA FM, a national radio station in South Africa, Lucy Ndugu, Regional Manager, emphasized the importance of South Africa, noting that it hosts the region's only multi-country office. Through the Pretoria sub-regional hub, UNV operations are coordinated in four other countries. She highlighted South Africa's strong tradition of volunteerism, rooted in the ubuntu philosophy of interdependence and collectivism. “Volunteer efforts are a powerful force to harness technology and social innovations for the good of all humanity.” Maxwell Gomera, Resident Representative of UNDP South Africa IN THE TRUE SPIRIT OF UBUNTUDuring the mission, the UNV Regional Office team met up with UN Volunteers and other volunteers serving in South Africa and neighbouring countries, both in-person and virtually. These interactions were an up close and personal exchange of experiences and ground realities. The power of collective action and the idea of community came full circle as volunteers celebrated their achievements and shared best practices. A townhall was also part of the exchange, where a questions and answer session helped to expand discussions on volunteerism and its impact. UN Volunteers in South Africa's Multi-Country Field Unit support health initiatives, education for all, sustainable agricultural practices and more. Their efforts add to the fabric of the region while promoting volunteerism and Ubuntu. “Volunteering with the UN has reshaped my view on global challenges. I now understand the complexities of international relations and organizational dynamics firsthand.” Georgina Edwards, UN Volunteers Innovation Analyst serving with UNFPA South Africa CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUTH INVESTING IN YOUTHThe mission coincided with the Youth Month in South Africa and team members participated in the Youth Volunteer Dialogue in Pretoria. The focus was youth entrepreneurship and innovation. Lucy Ndugu, Regional Manager highlighted the potential of youth to address the continent's challenges through local solutions. Notable participants included Maxwell Gomera, UNDP Representative, Dorcas Kibachio, UN Volunteer and Gaisang Noge, a popular South African actress. WE ARE INSPIRATION IN ACTIONThe mission to South Africa was a reminder of UNV's commitment to regional development through volunteerism. Inspiring each other though interaction and building on a shared vision, the images from the mission are a vivid illustration of what collective action is able to achieve. Currently, 30 UN Volunteers serve in 12 agencies, including UNODC, UNRCO, UN Women, UNDP and UNICEF.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n19 June 2024\n\nThe link to schooling and HIV infection rate is clear – and teenage girls are most vulnerable\n\ns we commemorate the International Day of the African Child on 16 June, we must draw attention to a particularly vulnerable group: African girls. The persistent inequalities across gender, social, economic and cultural structures make African girls disproportionately vulnerable to HIV infection. This is not just a tragedy for individual girls, it is a threat to the overall health of Africa. To achieve the global goal of ending Aids by 2030, it is imperative to prioritise the protection of African girls.The theme for this year’s International Day of the African Child aligns with that of the African Union: “The Year of Education”. This theme is a rallying cry to ensure that all Africans have access to quality education, regardless of who they are or where they live. It is an opportunity for all stakeholders – families, communities, governments, and leaders – to intensify their efforts to deliver an education fit for the 21st century.Education is not only a powerful driver of development and a strong instrument for reducing poverty – education and keeping girls in school is a critical tool in ending inequalities and combating Aids as a public health threat. Yet, in sub-Saharan Africa, approximately 58% of upper-secondary-aged children are not in school, with a higher percentage of girls out of school compared to boys (The Global Education Monitoring – GEM – Report 2023). This gender disparity tends to worsen as children progress to higher levels of education.Recent evidence shows that keeping girls in secondary school can reduce their risk of contracting HIV by up to 50% in some countries. Unfortunately, the pace of progress in reducing new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women has been slowing down. Every three minutes in sub-Saharan Africa, an adolescent girl or young woman aged 15-24 years is infected with HIV. They are three times more likely to be infected with HIV than their male peers, accounting for over 77% of new infections in this age group.In South Africa, the statistics are equally concerning. According to the government of South Africa and the UN Supported Education Plus Initiative, each week nearly 1,000 adolescent girls and young women in South Africa are infected with HIV.African girls also face a high incidence of gender-based violence, including child marriage and unwanted teenage pregnancies, which contribute to school dropout rates and new HIV infections. More than one in three young women in Africa were married before the age of 18 (Unicef, 2018).According to South Africa’s Department of Basic Education in 2022/2023, 150,000 school-aged girls between 10 and 19 years old became pregnant and one in three girls who became pregnant failed to return to school. Only 52.5% of the girls in South Africa complete their secondary education.Education serves as a protective factor against unintended pregnancy, child marriage and gender-based violence. If all girls completed secondary education, adolescent pregnancy rates could be cut by 75% and early marriage could be virtually eliminated.We must provide Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) to all young people – boys and girls equally – whether they are in school or not. CSE equips them with the knowledge, skills and confidence to make informed decisions about their bodies and futures, free from coercion and discrimination.With CSE, sexual initiation is postponed, condom and contraceptive use increases and unwanted teenage pregnancies decrease. Additionally, CSE supports the prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.There is some good news. Many countries on the continent are moving towards gender parity and non-discrimination by eliminating gender bias and stereotypes from learning materials, they are establishing guidelines for managing student pregnancies and are tackling the issue of boys’ disengagement from education.Working with five United Nations agencies, governments, and girls’ networks, an initiative called Education Plus has been rolled out as a critical response to the high HIV infection rates among adolescent girls and young women and the barriers to their education and economic empowerment in sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa is one of 15 governments that have committed to the Education Plus initiative.As we honour the International Day of the African child, we are calling on the new South African government to continue to prioritise the African girl and commit to addressing the systemic inequalities that jeopardise the health and wellbeing of African girls.By prioritising education and keeping girls in school, we can significantly reduce the risk of HIV and move closer to achieving the goal of ending Aids by 2030.Protecting and educating our girls is not just an investment in their future; it is an investment in the future of Africa.
