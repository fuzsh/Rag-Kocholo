        "text": "July 14, 2024\n\nI loved this one, however, I did find myself wishing for something a lil extra. It‚Äôs totally a ‚Äúme‚Äù problem, so bear that in mind. It‚Äôs still a 5-star read, so whatevs. But let me explain though. Okay then.\n\nFirstly, I missed the lyricism of AN ORCHESTRA OF MINORITIES. This new one is written much more direct and straightforward. Maybe Obioma thought elegant sentences would detract from the brutality of the subject matter. But being a lover of his past work‚Äôs decadent sentences/paragraphs, I was disappointed by the bluntly matter-of-fact serviceable prose.\n\nSecondly, Part 3 (no spoilers), which happens to share the same title as the novel, shifted into something wonderfully unexpected. This change in plot made me sit up with excitement. ‚ÄúOoooh,‚Äù I exclaimed, ‚Äúthis is about to get beguiling.‚Äù Unfortunately, this plot change turned out to be a small detour, and the novel continued on from its prior events. But, damn, I wish that deviation had stayed; I was so ready to see where it took me. I yearned to explore more of that avenue. Alas, it wasn‚Äôt meant to be. But the little taste I got, I savored.\n\nBut anyway, why does it sound like I have problems with the book? I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs actually pretty fantastic. A horrifying look at war with a huge emotional pull (and payoff): a young man on the search for his missing brother, ends up being thrust into a war he doesn‚Äôt want or understand. Like with all great war novels, we witness all of the uncensored gore, violence, and savagery while under the umbrella of fear, paranoia, and righteousness.\n\nInsight: I have always wanted to learn more about the Biafra movement, and this book sure quenched that curiosity. During and after reading, I went down a rabbit hole on Wikipedia and related articles, trying to fill my head with more knowledge on the subject.\n\nObioma has surely made a name for himself. A literary giant writing another ambitious powerhouse. An emotionally-charged story about the monstrosity of war, the power of guilt and regret, the wavering of faith and spirituality, and the never-ending strength of brotherly love. Compulsively readable, ambitious in breadth, brimming with heart and depth.\n\nJanuary 26, 2024\n\nI‚Äîyeah this is probably one of the best novels you will ever come across. A masterpiece.\n\nMay 28, 2024\n\nüìö\n\nThe Road to the Country\n\nBy the one and only @chigozieobiomaauthor\n\nThe best book currently published this year and I think the best war or war-adjacent based novel I‚Äôve read to date. Out in just one week on June 4th. Thank you @hogarthbooks for the opportunity to read this in advance!\n\nI won‚Äôt give you the synopsis, that‚Äôs easy to find on PW, kirkus, or goodreads. Just know that this thing is as epic and dreadfully huge and intense and wonderful as all that would suggest.\n\nIt‚Äôs Obioma‚Äôs classic blend of slow, savory sentences that still add up to the experience of a page-turner, wanting to know what is to come that will suck you right in. Obioma maintains the reader‚Äôs curiosity seamlessly, without gimmicks or tricks, just by painting imagery of the life and death surrounding his characters.\n\nThrough utterly tangible fear and palpable tension and anxiety, I felt present on the Biafran war front with the main character, Kunle; I felt passion with him and also deep, deep sorrow.\n\nIt‚Äôs not just that this is an excellent war novel, it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs excellent historical fiction, it‚Äôs excellent world literature, it‚Äôs excellent realism encountering cultural supernatural phenomena‚Äîit‚Äôs a classic. An actual, real, live, right-in-front-of-you-for-the-reading masterpiece. Yet, where a typical classic tragedy or comedy ends in a funeral or a wedding, respectively, Obioma has created a third, I think even more interesting and incredible thing.\n\nThis is the best book I‚Äôve read this year, likely in several years. It‚Äôs deeply personal, relating details of a larger war and the emotional, even cellular effects it has on someone uprooted from his life and thrown into it. Think Biafran / Nigerian Civil War literary equivalent of the film 1917, easily. The same gripping, gutting reality of a war-torn land and people yet about a war far less explored in film or literature typically featured on bookstagram.\n\nHonestly, Booker Prize 2024 or I riot. It‚Äôs Obioma‚Äôs turn.\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\nI have been hustling for this book! Obioma is one of my favorite authors. Finally got my hands on an advance UK edition a few weeks ago and read it in one practically one sitting. WOW! I have no words to describe this except to say that it is not like anything I have ever read, or will read. The ending is so good, soooo good, so good I want to cut it out and put on my door.\n\nThis is a powerful novel. There is war, friendship, and a protagonist that I loved through and through. I predict it will be a frontrunner amongst the best novels of 2024.\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nThe Road to the Country is one of the most brutal yet beautiful books I have ever read. I'm grateful to have gotten a copy through NetGalley--otherwise, I would not have finished it. But I'm so glad I did.\n\nKunle is a young Nigerian man, at the beginning of his career in university. He is haunted by an accident to his brother that happened years earlier, for which he blames himself. His brother is staying with friends when war breaks out. The Yorubi people are killing the Igbo people. The Igbo people want to secede from Nigeria, forming the nation Biafra and the powerful Nigerian army is determined they will not. Kunle sets off to bring his brother home but is caught by Biafran forces. He lies, to save his life, saying he is Igbo, and is then drafted into the Biafran army.\n\nI am old enough to remember the horrors of the Biafran war. My memories of the conflict, the pictures we saw of the children, are vivid so I knew this was going to be a difficult book to read. But I was unprepared for just how difficult. Obioma depicts the terrible suffering of not only the soldiers but of all the innocent people who were slaughtered and starved.\n\nThe famine in Biafra is well-known (although with our penchant for a new disaster after 15 minutes, I don't know how many young people even know about this tragedy) but it is hard to take in the enormity of this suffering, deliberately caused by the stronger forces. Not that it's news that people deliberately cause horrendous pain to each other--or that similar tactics are not still used--but it still felt like I was being punched in the gut repeatedly. That's how powerful Obioma's writing is.\n\nThere is no happy ending possible in this rendering of historical truth but as a reader I was continually drawn to the small moments of, if not happiness, then of at least relief, of comaraderie, even of love. Obiamo seems to detect and be able to portray every nuance of the human heart and experience.\n\nThe book also has the mystical dimension of a seer who sees this future, who follows the path of the young man not yet alive, the war and suffering not yet begun.\n\nAs I think I've already repeated several times, the writing is amazing and carried me through the extreme ugliness of man-perpetrated horrors. And in that suffering, how hope, how life, insistently appears despite everything. Because we have to have some moments of relief or we couldn't go on. And in addition to my obligation to NetGalley, I felt compelled to keep reading--to find out the fates of the characters I came to care deeply about, and to be a witness to a suffering that should not be forgotten.\n\nThank you to NetGalley for the copy of this book in exchange for an honest review and to Chigozie Obioma for writing it.\n\nJune 3, 2024\n\neARC and ALC gifted by the publisher.\n\nHow do we navigate life amidst the shadows of death? This is the profound question at the heart of ROAD, a powerful narrative following Kunle, a Nigerian university student, on an impossible mission to rescue his younger brother as his country breaks into a civil war (the Biafra War).\n\nThis sweeping historical fiction has all the hallmarks of a classic in the making. Obioma's writing is not just extraordinary; it's a revelation. It's a reminder that there's writing (my silly little book reviews), and then there's WRITING‚Äîrich, immersive, and transformative. ROAD's thesis on finding humanity among violence is incredibly timely and handled with a sensitivity that avoids exploiting the trauma of others, reminiscent of PROPHET SONG (Paul Lynch). The hint of magical realism adds a layer of enchantment to the narrative, bringing to mind THE SEVEN MOONS OF MAALI ALMEIDA (Shehan Karunatilaka).\n\nObioma's unflinching portrayal of the brutalities of war is both harrowing and compelling. Reading it felt like a visceral gut punch, yet I could not look away. His prose, akin to art, strikes the perfect balance between raw emotion and lyrical beauty, keeping me engaged even as my heart shattered into a million pieces. This emotional rollercoaster is sure to keep you captivated.\n\nAmidst the darkness, however, there is beauty. Kunle finds camaraderie among his fellow fighters and even discovers love. Obioma excels at vividly portraying a main character we can all see ourselves in‚Äîan ordinary person facing the extraordinary pressures of war and death. ROAD explores how, without superpowers, we find the courage to live under such crushing weight.\n\nThe ending is a poignant culmination of the narrative, where themes of death and rebirth converge, and everything comes full circle. Without giving too much away, it's a testament to the theme that where there is death, there is also rebirth. I burst into tears reading the final scenes, and they will definitely stay in my mind for a long time.\n\nI split my time evenly between reading on my Kindle and listening to the audiobook. While both formats offer a great experience, I highly recommend reading a physical copy to fully appreciate Obioma's phenomenal writing style and reference previous chapters. ROAD is my first Obioma, and I can't wait to read his backlists and immerse myself in his gorgeous writing.\n\n---\n\nnotes and ramblings\n\n4.75/5\n\nA sweeping historical fiction. The author doesn‚Äôt shy away from the brutality of war. This has everything that makes a Booker Winner ‚Äî out of the world writing, a very timely topic (reminds me of PROPHET SONG but doesn‚Äôt feel exploitative of others‚Äô trauma), and a splash of magical realism (reminiscent of THE SEVEN MOONS OF MAALI ALMEIDA).\n\nMy only nit-picky part is the seer chapters. I would‚Äôve loved to see the magical realism parts developed more!\n\nJuly 3, 2024\n\nSet in 1967 ‚Äì 1970, this is a novel about the Nigerian Civil War when Biafra (in southeastern Nigeria) seceded and attempted to gain independence. Protagonist Kunle is the son of a Yoruba father and Igbo mother. He attempts to retrieve his disabled brother from the warzone at the outbreak of hostilities, and unintentionally becomes a soldier in the Biafran Army in a conflict that he considers ‚Äúnot his war.‚Äù\n\nUnable to leave due to severe penalties for desertion (death) he gradually gains the mutual respect and affection for his comrades in arms, something that has been missing from his life. The storyline follows Kunle as he fights in battles and experiences a growing romantic involvement with a female soldier. He struggles with guilt over his role in the accident that disabled his brother and does not lose sight of his goal to rescue him.\n\nIn addition to the traditional narrative about the war itself, there is an element of magical realism that recurs throughout in the form of a Seer who predicted the civil war. The Seer narrates portions in first person as an observer. There is also a segment set in the realm of the dead. It is filled with the brutalities and atrocities that occurred during this real war. It also describes the hunger and famine that resulted. Suffice it to say this is not a ‚Äúlight read.‚Äù It is a moving and memorable novel by an accomplished author.\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\nKunte is a shy studious Nigerian student in the late 60's. He is engulfed with guilt over mistakes he believes he made with his family which manifests when his brother disappears during the civil war. Embarking on a journey to find him, he ends up in the army of Biafra, conscripted to fight for those who are trying to set up a country free of NIgeria. It's a journey, a long treacherous tale that is unequivocally fantastic prose.\n\nThis is a must read novel written by one of the new writers of this generation. Much like a gripping biopic on television, you will never forget reading this book and it will be touchstone for you when thinking about cultures in Africa. It is truly a masterpiece. #randomhouse #theroadtothecountry #chigozeobioma\n\nJune 10, 2024\n\nWow! Just wow. Vicious, yet filled with hope. If you are not one for war, brutal battles that war produces, and horrific images as the result of such battles, then you should proceed with extreme caution. It can be overwhelming, to say the least. However, the prose is otherworldly, and the beautiful sentences keeps pushing you further into the book, even as-much like the protagonist-you are surrounded by a war you really want no part of.\n\nThe fact that Mr. Obioma can write draw dropping sentences in the midst of utter terror is mind boggling. But yes, Mr. Obioma is a prose master and makes this book, despite its foundation of war an, I hesitate to say enjoyable, because how can one enjoy destruction, devastation, debilitation and death. So with all that said, it is still an excellent read and realistic rendering of the Biafra war that racked Nigeria.\n\nYes, make no mistake, this is a war novel, and though the story is told through the eyes of the university student Kunle who is reluctantly thrown into the front lines of the Biafra military, we witness his experience, not as university student, but as student of unrelenting conflict. Kunle is able to maintain his sanity through his focus on finding his younger brother, and at a later point surviving for his child. The action is helped along by a SEER, who has seen the splintering of Nigeria in a vision years before the Civil war begins. As part of his visions, he sees the unborn Kunle and how his life plays out before it all happens. A bit tricky? yes. But a minor device that doesn't majorly impact the overall effectiveness of this savagely great novel.\n\nThanks to Netgalley and Hogarth publishing for an advanced DRC. Book is available now.\n\nJune 26, 2024\n\n[4.5/5 stars]\n\n1960s Nigeria - the story follows Kunle, a university student whose younger brother disappears as the country explodes in civil war. Then this is Kunle's search for his brother while he goes on a rescue mission.\n\nTHE ROAD TO THE COUNTRY is a sweeping historical fiction, a touching war story written with lyrical prose that feels both exquisite in its language and tangible at evoking the right emotions. Like many war novels, this book is loaded with the brutalities of war, yet Obioma excels at delivering it without becoming pure trauma.\n\nThe narrative focuses on two characters - Kunle, a relatable character with unimaginable courage, who is flooded with guilt and lives to repair what he had done; and The Seer, a mysterious prophet who has a special vision for Kunle.\n\nThe strength of this novel lies in the way Obioma meticulously details the Biafran war (Nigerian civil war) by merging textured characters with a plot permeated by magical realism. The images of war creep in and one is able to access the dream state as if being allowed to seek the mind refuge.\n\nFrom oblivion into existence, the characters forge their own path through darkness to the light and they would be incomplete without the presence of each other. This journey feels propulsive, brave yet at the expense of something one holds dear. My favorite part was the mystical scenes and I wished to read more about the Seer. When the story brilliantly comes full circle, it's undeniable that this book is a triumphant work.\n\nAs devastating as it is beautiful, THE ROAD TO THE COUNTRY is a manifesto of love and friendship and everything that comes with it. A gorgeously tailored story.\n\n[ I received a complimentary copy from the publisher - Hogarth books . All opinions are my own ]\n\nJune 21, 2024\n\nThis is a grim and sad historical fiction set in the 1960s during the Nigerian civil war. A young guilt-ridden university student - Kunle Aromire - sets out to find his brother and bring him home amidst fierce fighting in war-torn Nigeria. Kunle is force-conscripted into the Biafran army when he crosses into rebel territory. His life is forever changed as he adapts to fighting on the side of the Biafran army while searching frantically for his brother and experiencing the tragedy and trauma of war. The relentless ravages of war are front and center with few rays of hope, if that. But war is real and Chigozie Obioma doesn‚Äôt flinch from its full portrayal. So readers, be warned, this book is not for the faint of heart, but essential reading to get a glimpse of the toll the Nigerian civil war had on its people, and for that matter, the ramifications of any war on people. Many thanks to the author, publisher, and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and review this book.\n\nJuly 31, 2024\n\nA powerful novel depicting the experiences of a soldier in the Biafran War of the 1960‚Äôs. While most of the novel is realistic, there‚Äôs also a Seer who adds a dimension of African spiritual tradition to the story‚Ä¶and whose words at the book‚Äôs conclusion gave me chills.\n\nJune 6, 2024\n\nSet in the late 1960's during the Nigerian war for freedom, this is probably the most vivid war novel I've ever read. A young apolitical university student gets caught up in the war while trying to save his crippled brother, and finds his life path changed forever. While the descriptions of life in wartime are not for the faint of heart, they bring an immediacy to the plot, not at all gratuitous.\n\nMay 5, 2024\n\nAbsolutely amazing writing‚Äîso many quotable thoughts and phrases. The story of the Biafran war was front and center and very hard to read because of the emotional impact on its participants. I loved the structure of the novel as the author weaved a bit of magical realism throughout. This reads like an award-winner which it deserves to be.\n\nThanks to NetGalley and Hogarth Press for the ARC to read and review.\n\nMarch 4, 2024\n\n‚ÄúThere will be laughter and tears, remembrance and forgetting, pride and shame, silence and noise‚Äù\n\nWow. This was a heartbreaking and graphic tale of Kunle‚Äôs life in the Biafran war. This was a dark and heavy read, but so worth it.\n\n‚ÄúBefore the war, we always want this or that; we always have big dreams, big ambitions. But now our needs have become so small, and our dreams have vanished. What is the hope we have? Just that we survive‚Ä¶that‚Äôs it‚Äù\n\nWe see the graphic descriptions of war and death. Very graphic. I had to take breaks from reading this at times because of how visceral the imagery was. That said, I think it‚Äôs important to read about the terror and reality of war. While this is considered fiction, it seems to be based in the truth of the real Biafran war. I‚Äôm astonished at the brutality of the scenes Obioma wrote throughout this book. It had me sick to my stomach, and I can only imagine what the reality of these sights could do to a person. This was a dense read, and very serious.\n\nIt‚Äôs heartbreaking to know that terrors like this actually occurred. I can‚Äôt imagine how terrifying and awful it was, and how it would have impacted people on both sides so deeply.\n\n‚ÄúThey have seen so much, and they will see yet more. They must learn to withstand what they have seen, to adapt. If it shocks you, then it can haunt you; if it haunts you, it can damage you‚Äù\n\nWe follow Kunle through his journey of trying to find his brother, where he gets swept up into the Biafran army. This is his story of love, loss, betrayal, and discovery. This perspective is sandwiched in between the visions of the seer, sprinkled with details of African folklore (which I struggled to understand at first, but would love to learn more about now).\n\n‚ÄúLife is like earth, soil - you never know what you will dig up‚Äù chapter 30\n\nThis was an incredible, poetic, and realistic read. I was crying by the end of it. I wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone, just be wary of your limitations for gore.\n\nA huge thank you to NetGalley and Chigozie Obioma for the ARC. I‚Äôm honoured to have been able to read this book.\n\nJune 30, 2024\n\nAll my reviews live at https://deedireads.com/.\n\nThere‚Äôs no denying that Chigozie Obioma is one of the best to ever do it. With The Road to the Country, he proves it once again ‚Äî enough this time to finally win him the Booker Prize, IMO. He deserves it.\n\nThis novel takes place on the frontlines of the Biafran/Nigerian Civil War and features the experiences of a young man named Kunle, who crosses into Biafra to find his brother and finds himself conscripted. At the same time, a seer is watching these events unfold 20 years in the past. I mean ‚Äî what a construction! It had me hooked from the first page.\n\nAdmittedly, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of frontline war novels, so there were parts of this book that were slow for me, especially in the first half. But by the second half, Obioma had built enough scaffolding (relationships, subplots, etc) that I was much more engaged.\n\nBut truly, this book feels like the making of a classic in your hands. The roller coaster of Kunle‚Äôs emotions and experiences will break your heart and give you hope. The unflinching brutality contrasted with tenderhearted softness, guilt and love, fear and bravery in these pages ‚Äî just excellent. Obioma is a master on the sentence level and at the novel level. He hammers home the cyclical, healing nature of history and the pairing of death and rebirth in a way that nobody else could.\n\nBooker 2024 or bust, baby.\n\nCONTENT AND TRIGGER WARNINGS\n\nWar, violence, and gore (explicit); Death and grief; Pregnancy (minor); Sexual violence as war tactic (off-page/mentioned)\n\nJune 18, 2024\n\nChigozie Obioma never ceases to amaze me with his literary genius. The latest addition to his body of work, The Road to the Country, while not my favorite, continues to live up to his amazing storytelling abilities.\n\nSet in Nigeria during the late 1960s during the chaos of the Biafran civil war, the story deals with themes of sacrifice, loyalty, and the bonds that tie families together. It‚Äôs a powerful look at what we‚Äôre willing to risk for those we love.\n\nThe story is very violent and graphic as the sights, sounds, and smells of the country come alive, putting us in the heart of the conflict. So prepare yourself.\n\nJune 12, 2024\n\nWe begin with the Igbo Proverb that the story of a war can only be fully and truly told by both the living and the dead. When then meet Kunle as he prepares to set off on an impossible rescue mission at the onset of the Nigerian Civil War in the 1960s. There is so much Kunle doesn't understand...this war and his role in it, where his younger brother is, and the prophecy of a local Seer that says he is one who will die and return to life.\n\nThis mythical yet oh so real story is truly unforgettable. I learned so much history, and I met a character that will stay with me forever. The war, of course, brings so much anguish beyond readers' wildest imaginations, and Obioma also provides us moments of tenderness and love despite the unimaginable. I couldn't put this down despite the incredibly difficult and pertinent content, because Obioma doesn't let you look away. His writing and Kunle's story, equal parts gutting and gorgeous, make this an absolute stand out of 2024.\n\nJanuary 2, 2024\n\nA quaking and powerful read that you must not miss!\n\nA story of brotherhood, of war, of redemption‚Ä¶ this was incredible. With visceral imagery, incredible writing and devastating events happening at every turn, this book truly packs a punch.\n\nWith a stunning mix of brutal reality and sweeping folklore, we follow Kunle as he searches for his brother, gets caught up in a war and learns things about himself he never imagined.\n\nThis is a denser, much more serious book than I was envisioning, but I was blown away! This is a MUST READ!\n\nMarch 4, 2024\n\nThe Road to the Country is a hard-hitting, brutal novel set against the backdrop of the Biafran war. Kunle, the main character, is our eyes and ears into this conflict, whose details will be unfamiliar to many in the West. He is beautifully drawn on the page, and the heat and the sweat and the danger of those days seeps through on every page. This was a truly engrossing novel of war.\n\nThank you to the publishers and Netgalley for the ARC.\n\nJune 2, 2024\n\nThe road to the country by Chicozie Obioma, The story starts with Kunle, he is the first year law student in Lagos when his uncle Matt comes to tell him about his brother who has left home to join the Civil War between the north and the south. This plagues Kunle, because his brother is disabled and then a wheelchair and it‚Äôs something that he blames himself for. When he arrives home his mama and papa or beside their self with worry when he leaves to find his brother Toondei however nothing goes to plan and life will never be the same again. Before Kunle‚Äôs birth a sear came to the village and throughout the book we see the seer watching Kunle. When he gets closer to where his brother is he cannot believe what is happening in his country it is truly war but when he leaves the Red Cross medic camp early he gets lost in the next thing he knows he is in the army and fighting a war he wants no part of. When he does see his brother again everything will be different including his brother and his own viewpoint of the Civil War. I do want to say this book was so sad‚Ä¶ I mean truly a sad story I felt so bad for Kunle, I mean even when he thinks he may have found a slice of happiness that also gets interrupted and torn apart by the war and I haven‚Äôt even put the most horrible things he went through. Will he find any happiness or even see home again and if so will his brother be with him? You need to read the book to find the answers to these questions and that is so worth reading. Oh yes I almost forgot the book is set in the 1960s it is a really good book I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and others set in Nigeria war is a bitch and Mr.Obioma does not hold anything back. If any book deserves an award it is definitely this one it is true gritty heartbreaking and just so good a real true masterpiece of literary fiction. I am not a person who cries over books but more than once when he started crying I also wanted to cry my heart broke for him he is truly a character to root for and what makes it even more sad is it was based on a real Civil War so I‚Äôm sure the details of the war part is absolutely true. I want to thank Random house for my free arc copy via NetGalley please forgive any mistakes as I am blind and dictate my review.\n\nAugust 12, 2024\n\nA very well written and grueling novel of the Nigerian Civil War. Perhaps my favorite part were the mystical interludes, including the time in the land of the dead. The rest of the time Kunle‚Äôs odyssey is made up of the deprivations and brutalities of a losing war, and his impotence to help the people he loves even as he becomes- almost against his will - a brave and decorated soldier. I can say I appreciated this novel without ever really enjoying it. For a far more emotionally involving, and dare I say more politically illuminating, novel about the same period I cannot recommend highly enough Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, which is one of the best books of the 21st century.\n\nJuly 13, 2024\n\nThe Road to the Country is a masterpiece. It tells the story of Kunle, a college student who finds himself in the middle of the Nigerian Civil War. The book is violent and vile, but contains an unflinching faith in humanity and our ability to heal. \"The story of a war can only be fully and truly told by both the living and the dead.\"\n\nJuly 23, 2024\n\nDisappointed mostly. The war scenes felt ordinary, the spiritual and human moments more powerful. An uneven reading experience.\n\nJune 1, 2024\n\nOther early reviewers have said, and I agree, that this book reads like a masterpiece. An instant classic. I will not be surprised if it wins a major award, like the Booker Prize, in 2024. I requested this on NetGalley because I had read and loved one of the author‚Äôs previous works, The Fishermen. Little did I know what I was getting into. This is a visceral, immersive novel about war and the individual war experience. Set in Nigeria during the civil war between northern Nigeria and the Igbo people in southeastern Biafra (between 1967 and 1970), it‚Äôs a great war novel, but also a deeply personal work of historical fiction. It doesn‚Äôt quite fit to say I enjoyed reading the book‚Ä¶it‚Äôs too gut-wrenching for that. But I did appreciate it as one does a first-class work of art. Obioma‚Äôs writing is beautiful and heartbreaking all at once. His prose is instantly identifiable, blending, as it does, the real with the magical. I loved it even as my heart was breaking. Highly recommended.\n\n‚ÄúAt one point these men liked the war. They‚Äôd fallen in love with the veiled princess only to find, one year in, that there is no beauty in her. Nothing worthy of poetry or comfort ‚Äì only hunger, danger, sorrow, and violent death. And now they want none of her. But they have to fight.‚Äù\n\nThanks to NetGalley and Random House for providing this ARC for my early review. This publishes soon ‚Äì June 4; make sure you get your hands on it fast.\n\nJune 1, 2024\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the author, Chigozie Obioma is a literary genius. He has written a sweeping historical novel centered around one man, Kunle, who through happenstance, becomes a soldier during the Biafran War for independence vs Nigeria in the 1960s. I remember the heart rending tv stories of the time, in which Biafra was a land of painful death by starvation, and so was curious to read the why and how of this long ago memory.\n\nThis is primarily a war story, which is not my favorite kind of read. Kunle , now a young man, sets out from his home in Nigeria as war breaks out, to find and bring home his brother who has been disabled by an accident in his younger years. Kunle thinks he has caused his brother‚Äôs condition and so feels a responsibility to rescue him from war torn Biafra and return him to the safety of his Nigerian home. En route to accomplish this onerous task, Kunle is captured by Biafran forces. Because his mother is of Biafran ancestry, Kunle survives by , speaking the Igbo language, adopting a new identity and fighting for the opposite side in a war he doesn‚Äôt want to fight in at all.\n\nYet, in addition to gruesome battlefield description and action, Kunle, his friends, family and war buddies are carefully depicted as perfectly imperfect human beings simply seeking the serenity of home and a warless existence. Kunle‚Äôs disabled brother, his nurse/ warrior sweetheart, and his Biafran new found comrades in arms, form a myriad of complex relationships for a misplaced young man who has entered an unexpected crisis.\n\nSurrounding the action is a mythical Seer who by magical powers, prior to the child‚Äôs birth, has predicted Kunle‚Äôs life journey to be one of a man who dies and comes back to life. The Seer appears in the story to watch as the baby grows into a man and becomes a soldier. Since the prediction had to be made before Kunle‚Äôs birth, the Seer‚Äôs observations are off sequence of the rest of the plot. This character added a sort of folk tale like dimension to the story and although I don‚Äôt usually care for magical realism, I make an exception in this case . I just wish the time sequencing were easier to follow.\n\nRating this book is quite difficult for me. The writing is beautiful but very complex and difficult to read.\n\nI had to proceed slowly and at times speed read through cumbersome spots to get to the passages that flowed with meaning and emotion. June 4, 2024 is the publication date. I recommend this book for readers who like a challenge; who seek knowledge ; and who enjoy a novel that is magnificently crafted, with much to think about afterward.I thank NetGalley and Random House for the opportunity to read a prepublication copy of this book in exchange for my review.\n\nApril 2, 2024\n\nA brutal look at the Biafran war, mixed with a splash of magical realism. We follow Kunle, a man caught up in the war by mistake, fighting for a side he feels no loyalty to, and constantly out of his depth. Obioma writes in such powerful prose - this is not an easy read, and you truly feel Kunle‚Äôs fear, his desperation, his blood and sweat seep through the page.\n\nDeeply moving and an engrossing read. For me, at its best when it leans into the magical realism, which Obioma uses to great effect in creating some memorable scenes.\n\nThanks to Netgalley and the publisher for the e-ARC\n\nMarch 10, 2024\n\nI was lucky enough to get a copy of this book as a UK advanced edition - what a book! I couldn‚Äôt put it down from the moment I started reading.\n\nMy 30 word review: An evocative, heart-grabbing and incredible book. It takes you on a journey through war, sibling-love, guilt, shame and friendship. Oh the language and the mythical ‚Äòseer‚Äô character. Oh the ending."
