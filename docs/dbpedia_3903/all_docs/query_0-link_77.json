        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Strategy for International Development (IDS) places development at the heart of the UK’s foreign policy. It sets out a new approach to development, anchored in patient, long-term partnerships tailored to the needs of the countries we work with, built on mutual accountability and transparency. This approach goes beyond aid and brings the combined power of the UK’s global economic, scientific, security and diplomatic strengths to our development partnerships. Our 4 priorities are to deliver honest, reliable investment, provide women and girls with the freedom they need to succeed, step up our life-saving humanitarian work, and take forward our work on climate change, nature, and global health. The Integrated Review Refresh (IR23) reiterates that sustainable development is central to UK foreign policy and sets out how the UK will go further and faster on development to reduce poverty and reinvigorate progress towards the SDGs. This Country Development Partnership Summary details how the IDS and IR23 will be put into practice with South Africa.\n\nCountry context\n\nSouth Africa is an important regional and international player. It advocates for African interests in international fora as the only African nation in groupings such as the G20 and BRICS [footnote 1]. South Africa is also the largest African investor into the continent and a key trading partner particularly for SACU [footnote 2] and SADC [footnote 3] countries, as well as a top migrant destination and source of remittances. It is therefore critical to Africa’s economic stability.\n\nSouth Africa continues to face significant development challenges: 63% of the population lives below the poverty line (World Bank); high youth unemployment (66.5% for 15- to 24-year-olds according to the World Bank); high income inequality (Gini coefficient [footnote 4] of 0.67); and, gender-based violence, with a femicide rate 5 times the global average (World Health Organization (WHO)).\n\nSouth Africa’s National Development Plan 2030, developed in 2012, sets out how the government aims to eliminate poverty and reduce inequality. It is aligned with the SDGs agreed in 2015, and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.\n\nThe UK and South Africa have an historic relationship, including strong people-to-people and trade links. Some 400,000 British nationals visit South Africa each year. South Africa is the UK’s largest trading partner in Africa, accounting for almost a third (32.8%) of all UK trade with the continent.\n\nThe UK and South Africa share common development interests and values, including promoting inclusive economic growth; climate and energy security; driving global health security and universal health coverage; tackling inequality; and, protecting the rights of the most vulnerable.\n\nDuring South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State Visit to the UK in November 2022, the 2 governments agreed 8 new partnerships across health, science, green energy technology, and economic cooperation.\n\nA Foreign Minister-level Bilateral Forum is held every 2 years to set strategic priorities for our partnership.\n\nThe UK’s development offer in South Africa\n\nThe UK’s development engagement supports South Africa’s long-term ambitions to tackle poverty and inequality in line with its National Development Plan; and, to encourage collaboration on global and regional development. We use the country Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget to pay for technical advice to national and provincial government, and to support local organisations such as the Gender Based Violence (GBV) and Femicide Fund.\n\nThe UK and South Africa work together to deliver the following development priorities, both bilaterally and internationally:\n\na just transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient economy\n\ninclusive, and sustainable economic growth\n\nhealth systems strengthening and pandemic preparedness\n\npromoting gender equality and women’s rights\n\ntackling and reducing corruption\n\nThese priorities reflect the aims of the IDS, including to:\n\ndeliver honest and reliable investment – supporting partner countries to grow their economies sustainably\n\nprovide women and girls with the freedom they need to succeed\n\ntake forward our work on climate change, nature, and global health\n\nThey also support the UK’s International Women and Girls Strategy (2023 to 2030) and its priority themes, the 3 Es:\n\neducating girls\n\nempowering women and girls and championing their health and rights\n\nending gender-based violence\n\nThe UK’s development activities are designed and delivered in partnership with line ministries and provincial governments. The UK works closely with bilateral (eg France, Germany, the EU, and the US), and multilateral (eg World Bank, African Development Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the United Nations (UN)) development partners.\n\nThe development partnership includes collaboration between UK and South African institutions, for example on science, research, technology, and innovation, and is complemented by commercial deals and investment, for example in renewable energy and infrastructure, including in partnership with British Investment International (BII) and UK Export Finance (UKEF).\n\nKey programmes\n\nIn financial year 2023 to 2024 and financial year 2024 to 2025, the UK is projected to spend £19 million ODA through its country budget on the following programmes.\n\nProgramme Expected outcomes Value [footnote 5] Just Energy Transition Support Delivery of the Just Energy Transition Partnership, including mitigating the impact on communities of the transition from coal to renewable power and leveraging private finance and investment. £5 million Urban Resilience Enhanced urban policy planning and improved service delivery, particularly for vulnerable groups across cities in 6 of South Africa’s 9 provinces. £8 million Skills for Work Strengthened pathways between education and employment, increasing access to employment for women and supporting priority sectors to improve the quality and relevance of training including through green skills. £5 million International Economic Partnership Strengthened collaboration in the Rules Based International System to promote regional economic development. South Africa’s capacity to deliver its economic reform priorities strengthened. £4 million Southern Africa Trade Capacity of businesses built to take advantage of the Economic Partnership Agreement, with a focus on women, youth, and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). £8.2 million Health Systems Strengthening Partnership Strengthened health systems and capacity to enable effective progress towards achieving Universal Health Coverage and pandemic preparedness £5 million Demography and Gender Improved use of demographic data in development planning. Strengthened UK-South Africa collaboration on women’s rights. Increased capacity of women’s rights organisations to tackle gender-based violence. £3 million Tackling Corruption Enhanced capacity of South African authorities to tackle corruption. £2.3 million\n\nThe UK also supports South Africa’s development priorities through other bilateral programmes, managed by FCDO centrally or by other UK ministries. For example, we provide technical assistance to strengthen capacity at national, provincial, and municipal levels to enable South Africa to meet its Nationally Determined Contributions targets and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. We also provide technical assistance to encourage sustainable, affordable, safe, and secure digital inclusion; build cybersecurity capacity; and support digital start-ups. The UK also supports science, technology, research, and innovation collaboration through a range of funding mechanisms, delivering projects in agriculture, space, health, oceans economy, and emerging technologies.\n\nFinancial information\n\nInitial allocations have been set internally to deliver the priorities set out in the International Development Strategy (May 2022) and the Integrated Review Refresh 2023, based on the FCDO’s Spending Review 2021 settlement.\n\nThe department’s spending plans for the period 2022 to 2023 to 2024 to 2025 have been revisited to ensure HM Government continues to spend around 0.5% of Gross National Income (GNI) on ODA. This was in the context of the significant and unexpected costs incurred to support the people of Ukraine and Afghanistan escape oppression and conflict and find refuge in the UK, and others seeking asylum. The Government provided additional resources of £1 billion in 2022 to 2023 and £1.5 billion in 2023 to 2024 to help meet these unanticipated costs. The Government remains committed to returning ODA spending to 0.7% of GNI when the fiscal situation allows, in line with the approach confirmed by the House of Commons in July 2021.\n\nThe country development partnership summaries include the breakdown of programme budgets allocated to individual countries for 2023 to 2024 and 2024 to 2025. These allocations are indicative and subject to revision as, by its nature, the department’s work is dynamic. Programme allocations are continually reviewed to respond to changing global needs, including humanitarian crises, fluctuations in GNI and other ODA allocation decisions.\n\nIt should be noted that these figures do not reflect the full range of UK ODA spending in these individual countries as they do not include spend delivered via core contributions to multilateral organisations, or regional programmes delivered by the FCDO’s central departments. Other UK Government departments also spend a large amount of ODA overseas. Details of ODA spent by other UK government departments can be found in their Annual Report and Accounts and the Statistics for International Development.\n\nFCDO ODA allocation\n\nThese programmes are monitored through individual oversight mechanisms in coordination with relevant South African ministries. The overall portfolio is reviewed through the Bilateral Forum.\n\nAllocated ODA budget financial year 2023 to 2024: £5.9 million.\n\nIndicative ODA budget financial year 2024 to 2025: £13 million.\n\nSupporting information sources"
