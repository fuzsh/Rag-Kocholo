While you can fly into any country in southern Africa, most flights will route through South Africa anyway. South Africa is also a good place to get used to travelling in the region.\n\nAlthough some rural parts of South Africa remain among the poorest and the least developed parts of the world and poverty in certain areas of townships can be appalling and squatter camps can grow overnight, progress is being made. The process of recovering from apartheid, which lasted almost 46 years, is quite slow. In fact, South Africa's United Nations Human Development Index, which was slowly improving in the final years of apartheid, has declined dramatically since 1996, largely attributed to the AIDS pandemic, but also due to maladministration and squandering of state resources which led to an increase in the poverty rate and ever-widening income disparity between rich and poor. South Africa boasts a well-developed state and privately funded infrastructure and keeps up to date with all the modern amenities and technologies. National quality standards of construction, roads, technologies, goods manufacture, medicine and hospitals, communications and IT, aeronautics, banking, brokerage and investment, beverage and food chain quality are on a par with the best worldwide. The government is stable, although corruption has become prevalent in certain areas such as immigration officials at land border posts demanding a fee for stamping any passports or home affairs personnel dealing with visas and permits, traffic enforcement officers trying their luck and crime syndicates buying their way out of trouble. Bigger business may bribe high placed government. The government and the primary political parties generally have a high level of respect for democratic institutions and human rights while the press is free and uncensored and the judicial system and constitutional court are fully independent.\n\nDespite structural governance problems the country faces, South Africa remains the strongest and most diversified economy in Africa, and is the only African country to be a member of the elite G-20 group of major economies.\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nSouth Africa is renowned for its wines and fruits. Its agriculture output keeps the nation roughly self-sufficient in food, with maize, sugarcane and sunflower oil being major crops. Sea fishing and processing are increasingly important. It is the world's largest producer of platinum and its family group metals and a major producer of gold, iron, coal, diamonds, nickel, chromium, aluminium, stainless steel and uranium, among others. It also manufactures many industrial products and is a pioneer in the production of synthetic fuels. It maintains sizable armed force and is an influential player in African politics.\n\nAll that said, the economy has more potential than has been realised, as reflected in a 35% unemployment rate, which many South Africans and foreign observers agree is due to mismanagement and corruption. However, the new administration, in power since early 2018, campaigned on cleaning up governance and management and has already taken concrete steps to do so. Another important challenge the state is trying to tackle is a \"brain drain\" which has worsened since 2000 and includes all types of skilled professionals from doctors and engineers to artisans and teachers.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nSouth Africa is located at the southernmost tip of Africa, with a long coastline that stretches more than 2,500 km (1,553 mi) and along two oceans (the South Atlantic and the Indian). It is a relatively dry country within the interior and the Kalahari Desert proof of this, particularly in the Northern Cape and north west Atlantic region. The two major river systems are the Limpopo, running easterly along the northern border and the Orange river, running roughly from the central regions southwestwards to the Atlantic Ocean. The Drakensberg Mountain range runs from the lower Eastern Cape to the KwaZulu-Natal and Eswatini with elevations exceeding 3000 metres (Mafadi is 3450m). The Highfelt and Platterland regions of Free State, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and Northwest, range between 1200 and 1800 metres altitude and is home to some of the best wildlife conservation reserves in the world. The coastal areas from the southern Cape and farmland region, up the Indian Ocean seaboard all the way to KwaZulu-Natal and the Eswatini and Mozambique borders, provide the country with the densest green regions.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe tip of Africa has been home to the Khoikhoi (collective name for Hottentot (derogatory)), Bushmen (San) and Bantu people for thousands of years. Khoisan or according to the contemporary Khoekhoegowab orthography Khoesān (pronounced: [kxʰoesaːn]), is an artificial catch-all name for the so-called \"non-Bantu\" indigenous peoples of Southern Africa, combining the Khoekhoen(formerly \"Khoikhoi\") and the Sān or Sākhoen (also, in Kitchen Dutch: Boesmans, or in English: Bushmen). Rock art believed to be of Khoisan tribes can still be found in many places throughout the South Africa. It is thought that Bantu tribes may have started to slowly expand into the northernmost areas of what is today South Africa more than 2,500 years ago the different cultural groups as we know them today had been established in the areas to the north, east, east central and south east of South Africa. The desert and semi-desert areas of the Western and Northern Cape provinces, as well as the western parts of the Eastern Cape province remained unsettled by the Bantu as the arid climate, limited seasonal rainfall, sparse vegetation, scarcity of natural resources and water could not sustain large migrations of people and herds of cattle.\n\nNguni Cattle were the primary livestock reared by the Bantu and fulfilled numerous cultural and economic functions within the tribal society while growing numbers of Bantu populations settled within green fertile areas. Cattle remains to this day a status symbol and served as a rudimentary currency and basic unit of exchange with a mutually agreeable value between bartering parties, thus fulfilling the function of money.\n\nThe regions of the Karoo, Cape Peninsula, the Kalahari, Namaqua, Graqua and Bushman land gradually become \"Khoisan\" territory in South Africa. In these mostly dry areas, the \"Khoisan\" being already semi-nomadic, are believed to have not permanently settled as conditions of searching desert game and dwindling water sources during winter months, consequently determined their own migration. Not until the Boer \"Voortrekkers\" keen to avoid conflict with the Bantu (see next paragraph) came into these areas and established boreholes and containment ponds, could any permanent settlements be established in these regions.\n\nIn the southeast, the Zulu Kingdom would grow into a powerful kingdom under King Shaka, who ruled from 1816-1828, and was also known for being a brilliant warrior and military commander.\n\nToday, with more reliable sources of water and modern methods of water conservancy, the agricultural activity remains limited mainly to sheep and ostrich ranching as these animals are better suited to the sparse feed and limited water.\n\nColonialism\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Portuguese explorer Bartolomeo Dias is the first known European to have rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1488. 10 years later, Vasco da Gama made his first voyage to India, but the Portuguese ignored the Cape of Good Hope as a stopover base; the first permanent European settlement was built at Cape Town by the Dutch East India Company in April 1652. In the late 1700s, the Boers (the settling farmers) slowly started expanding first westward along the coastline and later upwards into the interior. By 1795, Britain took control of the Cape, as a consequence of the Napoleonic wars on the Dutch, and in 1820, a large group of British settlers arrived in the region, disrupting the Dutch Boers way of life. In 1835, large numbers of Boers known as the \"Voortrekkers\" (pioneers) started out on the Groot Trek (the great migration) northwards into the interior after becoming dissatisfied with the British rule. In the interior, they established their own internationally recognized Oranje Free State and Transvaal republics. Meanwhile, the British would defeat the Zulu Kingdom in the Anglo-Zulu War 1879, thus establishing colonial rule over the Zulu people.\n\nModern history\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 20th-century South Africa\n\nAfter the discovery of large deposits of diamonds in Kimberley and gold in the Transvaal, two wars for control over the region were orchestrated by English investment interests to cause the fight between the Boer Republics and the British in 1880 and 1899, to alienate control of the mineral resources from the \"Boers\" hands. The second war occurred after British settlers flooded into the area surrounding Johannesburg known as the \"Witwatersrand\" (white water escarpment) in response to the discovery of gold in 1886. The Second Boer War (Afrikaans: Die Tweede Vryheidsoorlog or 'Second War of Independence') was particularly brutal, as the British administration imprisoned the Boer civilian population in concentration camps, resulting in one of the earliest recorded genocides. With the victory at any cost and scorched earth policy, most Boer farms, livestock, crops and homesteads were also largely destroyed. Ironically, this war was the first to be captured on motion pictures, with the resulting screenings causing public opinion in the UK to turn against the British Army's inhumane treatment of prisoners in the camps.\n\nAfter peace was restored by the 1902 Treaty of Vereeniging, the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, consolidating the various Boer republics and British colonies into a unified state as a member of the British Commonwealth, contributing significantly to World War I, World War II, and the Korean War, with raw materials, arms production and soldiers. In 1961, the Republic of South Africa under the apartheid regime, was formed and SA exited the Commonwealth. Non-Europeans were largely excluded from these political changes as they had received sovereign lands in which to live under self-rule, in accordance with their own tribal legal system and hierarchical form of government.\n\nIn 1948, the National Party came to power. The NP introduced numerous apartheid laws to give a national/tribal, independent and sovereign \"homeland\" to each of the various tribes within South Africa, who were frequently engaged in raids and border wars against each other. The laws also implemented a system of institutionalised, or systematic, racial segregation and discrimination, and ensured a continuation of white minority rule over the black majority, and over Indian, Coloured and other minority groups. This move was welcomed by the majority of the different tribal kings and chieftains, as most of the tribes sought self-governance. But soon, apartheid became practically synonymous with racism and oppression as millions of non white people were forced to leave their homes under housing policies that enforced racial segregation. The African National Congress (ANC) was banned and forced into exile for conducting and plotting terrorist activities. Other political parties that were considered 'dangerous' and 'subversive' were also banned by the South African government during this time, while free thinking individuals and unaffiliated anti apartheid activists of all races were also harassed, ostracised, imprisoned or murdered. Meantime, the refining of the apartheid system became insidious and very efficient, as victims won small legal battles in court, the regime used its parliament majority to pass new laws to close legal loopholes, creating a vicious circle of judicial moving goal posts to suit their objectives, therefore, tying up sympathetic high officials and judges hands to keep everything \"legal\". South Africa in its attempt to keep apartheid going, used the cold war and communist danger as an excuse to bypass UN sanctions and violently suppress civil disobedience within and on the former German colony of \"South West Africa\" (Namibia), invaded Angola, supported UDI Rhodesia and aided anti government armed insurrections in post colonial Mozambique and Angola.\n\nThe Republic, despite experiencing rapid infrastructure development and strong economic growth until the late 1980s, also experienced frequent domestic uprisings in response to the apartheid laws. During this time the international community also increased political pressure mechanisms and trade embargoes against South Africa, and banned its athletes from competing in the Olympic Games and most other international sporting competitions.\n\nBy the late 1980s, many white citizens began to recognize that change was inevitable, seeing as international sanctions and internal strife were beginning to take a severe toll on South Africa. Thus, moderates within the security services, armed forces and the National Party followed the white liberals' lead and began quietly reaching out to ANC leaders to negotiate how to dismantle apartheid, which started with the freeing of political prisoners in 1990.\n\nPolitical violence worsened during the early 1990s as extremists of all kinds attempted to derail ANC-NP peace talks in favor of their own visions of the future of South Africa. In 1992, 73% of the eligible white population voted in a referendum to have the apartheid system abolished. This was quickly followed by a new constitution in 1993 and the nation's first truly all inclusive democratic election set for April 1994, in which all voting age South African citizens were allowed to vote regardless of their ethnic and cultural background. Former political prisoner Nelson Mandela became the country's first democratically elected president. The ANC won a 63% majority and proceeded to form a Government of National Unity with the NP.\n\nDespite much hope for a \"rainbow nation\" as Nelson Mandela envisioned following the end of apartheid, South Africa's economy began to take a turn for the worse after Mandela stepped down in 1999 and Thabo Mbeki succeeded him. Mbeki would invite controversy by calling into question the causal relationship between HIV and AIDS, instead believing that AIDS was caused by poverty. Mbeki banned anti-retroviral drugs from South African hospitals, leading to countless premature deaths of HIV positive patients. Mbeki would be forced to resign in September 2008, and he would eventually be succeeded by Jacob Zuma in May 2009. As Zuma grew up in poverty and never received any formal education, the masses of poor black South Africans were initially hopeful that he could empathise with them and enact policies to alleviate poverty. However, Zuma's tenure would be plagued with massive corruption scandals, and he was forced to resign in February 2018. Zuma was succeeded by Cyril Ramaphosa, who has promised to fight corruption, revitalise the economy and close the massive wealth gap, though whether or not his policies will prove successful remains to be seen.\n\nWhile affirmative action policies have resulted in the formation of an elite black upper class, much of the black population continues to live in poverty with no access to proper sanitation facilities or good schools. This has caused significant racial tensions, with some extremists in the black community proposing depriving the white community of their properties without compensation for re-distribution to black people as restitution for the atrocities committed under colonialism and apartheid. On the other hand, many right-wing whites blame the black majority for mismanaging the country after power was handed over to them. The Indian and Coloured communities, who were also discriminated against under apartheid but to a lesser extent than the black community, also harbour some degree of resentment for not being eligible for affirmative action policies, often using the moniker \"not white enough then, not black enough now\". Similarly, the Khoisan people, despite having settled in South Africa long before the arrival of the black Bantu peoples, have been largely left out of the post-Apartheid affirmative action policies, resulting in some degree of resentment against the Bantu-dominated government.\n\nPeople\n\n[edit]\n\nModern South Africans are very diverse, with many different ethnicities making up the population numbers. Nevertheless, besides the Xhosa, Venda, Shangane, Sotho, amongst others, the Zulu people constitute the largest group with approximately 20% of the total. There are also two main ethnic groups among white South Africans; the Afrikaners, who are descended from Dutch settlers and form the majority of white community, and Anglo-South Africans, who are descended from British settlers. South Africa is also home to the largest Jewish community in Africa, mostly Ashkenazi Jews of Lithuanian ancestry. This melting pot of people also includes sizable numbers of other Africans, Asian and European descendents, with Mozambicans, Zimbabweans, Malawians, Middle Eastern, Indians, Malays, Chinese, Portuguese, Greek, English, Italian and many mixed peoples, to name a few contributing to a true rainbow nation. The existence and survival in Southern Africa of the ancient Khoikhoi and San peoples, their culture, language and traditions, provides a window into a way of life largely gone unchanged for more than 10,000 years. By and large, the vast majority of its people irrespective of background, colour or creed, are friendly, helpful and a bit curious about visitors while good manners and respect go a long way towards an enjoyable rapport.\n\nRetirement destination\n\n[edit]\n\nThe South African immigration regulations provide a special temporary residence permit system that after some years can be elevated to a permanent residence status. This allows older or retired foreigners in an otherwise good health condition, with a certain level of legally obtained steady income or pension and in possession of a clean criminal record certificate, to settle down and buy property locally in their retirement. Such an opportunity may be attractive to Northern Europeans seeking sunny mild weather in a country that offers the best of both worlds by being very cosmopolitan and at the same time, keeping African traditions very much alive, and with a much lower cost of living, given the advantageous exchange rates while being in approximately the same time zone of country of origin. Such permit holders are treated like all South Africans nationals from a legal stand point, thus, subjected to all laws and regulations governing the nation.\n\nPlace names\n\n[edit]\n\nMany region, city, street and building names in South Africa have been changed after the end of apartheid and some of them are still being changed today. These changes can sometimes lead to confusion as many of the new names are not yet well known. This travel guide will use the official new names, but also mention the previous names where possible.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe climate in South Africa ranges from desert and semi-desert in the north west of the country to sub-tropical on the eastern coastline. The rainy season for most of the country is in the summer, except in the Western Cape where the rains come in the winter. Rainfall in the Eastern Cape is distributed evenly throughout the year. Winter temperatures hover around zero, summers can be very hot, in excess of 35 °C (95 °F) in some places.\n\nThe South African Weather Service provides up to date weather information, forecasts and radar imaging.\n\nSport\n\n[edit]\n\nFootball, cricket, rugby union and track and field athletics are the most supported and participated national sports. South African swimming, cycling and tennis produce some world-class athletes from time to time. In 2010, South Africa hosted the first FIFA World Cup to be held on the African continent. South Africa was also host of the 1995 Rugby World Cup, the only edition of that tournament to be held in Africa.\n\nPublic holidays\n\n[edit]\n\nThe public holidays in South Africa are:\n\nNew Year's Day (1 January)\n\nHuman Rights Day (21 March)\n\nEaster weekend A 4-day long weekend in March or April consisting of \"Good Friday\", \"Holy Saturday\", \"Easter Sunday\" and \"Easter Monday\", the dates are set according to the Western Christian tradition.\n\nFreedom Day (27 April)\n\nWorkers Day (1 May)\n\nYouth Day (16 June)\n\nWoman's Day (9 August)\n\nHeritage Day (24 September)\n\nDay of Reconciliation (16 December) - see Bloodriver.\n\nChristmas Day (25 December)\n\nDay of Goodwill (26 December)\n\nIf a public holiday falls on a Sunday, then the following Monday will also be a public holiday.\n\nThe school year is divided into four terms. School holidays occur early December to the middle of January, early in April, middle June to the middle of July and in late September. Most South Africans go on leave during these times and accommodation will be harder to find. The main holiday period is in mid-summer (December-January).\n\nTourism information\n\n[edit]\n\nSouth African Tourism operates a number of offices in other countries. Check their website, or contact the office in your country for any additional information or assistance.\n\nBuy\n\n[edit]\n\nMoney\n\n[edit]\n\nThe currency is the rand, denoted by the symbol \"R\" (ISO code: ZAR). It is divided into 100 cents (c). Notes are in denominations of R200, R100, R50, R20 and R10. Higher value notes are slightly larger in physical size than small value notes. All notes have a metallic security strip and a watermark. A new series of banknotes was introduced in 2012, and both the old and the new series are circulating and legal tender.\n\nCoins are in denominations of R5, R2, R1, 50c, 20c, 10c and 5c. Production of 2c and 1c coins was suspended in 2002 although those still in circulation remain legal tender. All transactions are rounded down to the nearest lower 5c, so as not to require the use of 2c and 1c coins. There are two types of R5 coins in circulation: one is a silver-coloured coin while the other is silver-coloured with a copper insert. Both are legal currency.\n\nSouth Africa is part of the Southern African Common Monetary Area and the rand can be used in Namibia (where it is an official currency along with the Namibian dollar), and in Lesotho and Eswatini (where it is widely accepted, but not an official currency). The currencies of each country are tied to the rand at the rate of 1:1.\n\nTraveller's cheques are a safe way of carrying money around. You can exchange them at all banks (which are found throughout the country even in rural areas) and you will get a refund if they are stolen. The disadvantage is that you cannot pay with them and you will need change when exchanging them into rand. Use ATMs instead if possible.\n\nAutomated Teller Machines (ATMs), linked to all major international networks, are available throughout the country and will generally dispense money in a mixture of denominations between R200 and R10, with about 80% of the value requested being high value notes and the rest in smaller denominations. You can use any Cirrus or Maestro card and all major credit and debit cards at the ATMs. South African bank ATMs charge fees in addition those levied by your own financial institution: e.g., R50 by Nedbank, or R75 by ABSA, as of March 2023\n\nIt is best to use only ATMs that are inside a mall or other building. Always be careful to make sure no one is watching you enter your PIN, and be vigilant about scams (e.g. machines that seem to eat your card and won't give it back after you enter the PIN). Do not accept help from strangers when withdrawing money at an ATM. If you are approached and offered unwanted help, cancel the transaction immediately and go to a different ATM.\n\nThe till points at some major retail stores (such as Pick 'n Pay) also act as ATMs; simply tell the checkout clerk that you would like to withdraw money. Transaction costs will be less than at ATMs.\n\nVisa and MasterCard are accepted almost everywhere. American Express and Diners Club are also accepted, but not as widely.\n\nMost retail stores accept credit cards and PIN-based debit cards as payment. South Africa has moved towards a chip-and-PIN credit card system like Europe. Thus, credit card users from countries also on that system (like the United States) will have no problem using their credit cards in South Africa, provided that they have notified their bank in advance of their travel plans.\n\nVAT (Value Added Tax) is levied at 15% on almost all products in South Africa. Government legislated bread (rectangular loaf) and basic food stuff like uncooked meats, fresh milk, raw and unprocessed fruit and vegetables, are all tax exempt. By law, advertised prices should be inclusive of VAT except when explicitly stated otherwise. Foreign passport holders may claim back the VAT only on material products that were bought in South Africa and are being taken out of the country, provided that the total value of the goods exceeds R250, but not for things like accommodation and food costs or car rental. Full details of the procedure to follow are available from the Department of Foreign Affairs and their new TAX Refund for tourists site. VAT Refund Administrator's offices are available at both Johannesburg (O.R. Tambo) and Cape Town International Airports. Refunds will be credited to a Travelex Visa card that you will be given, denominated in U.S. dollars or euros, the fees in conversion associated with this card can leave you with up to 10% less than you thought you were getting. The cards can only be used outside of South Africa.\n\nCosts\n\n[edit]\n\nPetrol and diesel\n\n[edit]\n\nLiquid fuel prices in South Africa are regulated and are fixed by region monthly. In general, petrol is cheaper near the ports (Durban, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth). A litre of petrol will cost around R17 (2018).\n\nTyre punctures and small vehicle repairs can be done in garages almost anywhere. Private or chain/franchise tyre shops are easily found and charge around R90/120, including puncture repair kit, new air valve and wheel rebalancing. Although prices for things like new radiator hoses or air and oil filters, new batteries, aircon gas refills and so on, may be wise shopping around for better prices, these services are also carried out while you wait.\n\nWindscreen chipping can often occur both on South African asphalt or dirt roads. Major urban centers have specialists in windscreen repairs able to invisibly and permanently fix small chips and cracks while you wait for about R500. If not found online, any proper garage or windscreen agent will be able to recommend someone near you. If a crack results from someone else's vehicle and you are insured, record the date, time and location, plus the other vehicle's registration plate number, colour and make to give your insurer.\n\nToll roads\n\n[edit]\n\nThe most expensive toll gate in South Africa is the Swartruggens toll plaza on the N4 between Swartruggens and Zeerust, cost is R71 for a normal car. In total, road tolls between Pretoria and Mbombela or between Johannesburg and Cape Town will cost you just under R100. If travelling from Beitbridge to Cape Town, down the N1, expect to pay as much as R270.\n\nFood\n\n[edit]\n\nYou can buy a McDonald's Big Mac for around R39,90 (2020)\n\nA sit-in lunch at an average restaurant will cost you about R120 per person (2018).\n\nA dinner at a restaurant in a fancy or posh area may cost R200 R500 p/person (without drinks).\n\nA basic 30-cm pizza will cost about R85 (2018), however, known chains offer bulk buy specials.\n\nBeverages of all kinds in most restaurants tend to be too overpriced. Unlicensed establishments may charge a \"corking\" fee, ranging from cheap to questionably high.\n\nShopping\n\n[edit]\n\nPrices in shops are fixed, but prices in open markets or from street vendors are open to barter.\n\nSouth Africa may not the best place to find bargains for most goods, for example, most ordinary consumer goods, electronics, and appliances are by and large manufactured in China nowadays, while most luxury goods are manufactured in Europe. In any case, by law, everything has to specify place of origin/manufacture in addition to, in the case of garments, accessories and shoes, the various types of materials used and the respective percentages. Nevertheless, the South Africa garment and shoe industry has begun a new chapter by reviving some dormant factories and in partnership with new brilliant local fashion designers, combining to produce very attractive high quality affordable shoes and clothing items made from nationally sourced top grade raw materials, like leather, wool and mohair, the Young Designers Forum label is an example of this development and Cape Town leads the way, while others can be found on the web. On the electronic goods market, prices needs double checking, a simple GPS navigator for your car will cost about R2000 - more than double the cost in the US or Europe! Nevertheless, in major urban centers like Johannesburg and Cape Town, retail parks with direct to public factory outlets, offer very discounted prices on well known global brands in clothing, sports shoes and equipment, accessories, home entertainment and electronics.\n\nHowever, South Africa is a superior destination for buying African art, curios, and souvenirs which are far more difficult to obtain outside of Africa. In Johannesburg particularly, the Jewellery Council of SA and Diamond Board of SA certified diamond and coloured gemstone dealers and jewellers make jewellery in gold or platinum, available from reputable manufacturers at much better prices than on high street. Much of these business are concentrated in Jewel City, Main St., Jhb. or The Hamlet, Ridge Rd., Parktown, Jhb. All of these business provide the necessary documentation for a full VAT refund when leaving the country.\n\nTipping\n\n[edit]\n\nTipping is the norm in restaurants. Indeed, most of these businesses pay their staff the legal minimum-wage, relying on customer tips to bring staff incomes up to live-able levels. Tips of around 10% of the bill are considered the norm but you may refuse to tip if the food and/or service were below par. Please note some restaurants management shares all \"official\" tips, you may want to rather give an actual cash tip to the waiter involved, instead of adding it to the bill being paid by cr/card.\n\nA small amount, usually around R5 or more, is given to petrol station attendants for additional services, such as cleaning one's windscreen. Toilet cleaners at service stations along major road routes are sometimes tipped when they provide good service and keep the facilities clean. \"Car guards\", who claim to \"look after\" one's parked car are often given a small tip if they are in uniform and authorized; however those without uniforms are usually regarded as a nuisance, and tipping them is not compulsory, despite the fact that they often harass motorists looking for payment.\n\nThe 10% tipping rule also applies when taking a taxi. As most cabs work with cash only, it's better to ask how much you'll be expected to pay for your journey before getting in. This will ensure that you always have enough to give the driver as a tip.\n\nLastly, when checking into your hotel, it is customary to tip your porter as well. The generally accepted rule is to give them R5 per bag they handle.\n\nSleep\n\n[edit]\n\nEstablishments in South Africa can have themselves graded by the Tourism Grading Council of South Africa[dead link] on a 5-star basis. Many establishments make use of this service and you will see the star grading displayed on most advertising material. An inconsistent pricing system that sees many establishments offering a \"per person\" price instead of a \"per room\" rate, should be made aware of. Also, not everyone makes very it clear if breakfast is included or not and if not, how much extra will be. If you are budget sensitive, in the last few years, accommodation costs at many greedy establishments, in big or small towns alike, have been going up far out of sync with actual inflation, making it unwise to pre-book without doing a thorough search. In certain instances, a global brand or comparable hotel will cost much less in Europe or America than in SA. One of the excuses for this is the exchange rate, so, shop around. Another anomalie, is the inconsistency within the star rating. A three or four star guest house, B&B or hotel, maybe better kitted out, more spacious, better maintained and run than a five star establishment in the same area, therefore, rendering the system a rough guide-line indicator and not a systematic reliable set of standards. Similarly, in game reserve areas for example, is not uncommon to spot a slightly above average establishment charging just a slightly cheaper rate than the nearby ultra luxurious game lodge, but offering nothing comparable in quality or variety to its seven star counterpart, so, beware. For the price conscious and average tourist, the game reserve experience is better done within game camps under the control of the Provincial Parks Authorities or National Parks Board. There, prices for accommodation, food and guided safaris are very reasonable.\n\n1 star - Clean, comfortable and functional.\n\n2 star - Good: Quality furnishings, service and guest care.\n\n3 star - Very good: Better furnishings, service and guest care.\n\n4 star - Superior: Excellent comfort and very high standard furnishings, service and guest care.\n\n5 star - Exceptional: Top of the line quality and luxurious accommodation to match the best international standards. Flawless service and guest care.\n\nBackpacker lodges\n\n[edit]\n\nBackpacking lodges or hostels are widespread all over the country. Most establishments offer great value tours and activities in the areas. There is a great network of transport around the country making it suitable for single and younger travellers. Some lodges provide meals especially in the more remote areas. Most have self-catering facilities and shared bathrooms although en-suite bathrooms are also common.\n\nB&Bs\n\n[edit]\n\nBed and Breakfast establishments are becoming very popular. The accommodation is usually provided in a family (private) home and the owner/manager lives in the house or on the property. Breakfast is usually served. Bathroom facilities may be en-suite. In general, the guest shares the public areas with the host family.\n\nSelf-catering\n\n[edit]\n\nA house, cottage, chalet, bungalow, flat, studio, apartment, villa, houseboat, tents or similar accommodation where facilities and equipment are provided for guests to cater for themselves. (This can include a fridge, oven, stove, and microwave.) The facilities should be adequate to cater for the maximum advertised number of residents the facility can accommodate.\n\nGuest house\n\n[edit]\n\nA guest house is a converted house or manor adapted to accommodate overnight guests or it may be a purpose built facility. A guest house is run as a commercial operation and is often owner-managed. A guest house has areas which are for the exclusive use of the guest. The owner/manager either lives off-site, or in a separate area within the property.\n\nCamping and caravaning\n\n[edit]\n\nCaravan parks can be found in most towns that are holiday destinations. Most caravan parks also offer camping sites where you can pitch a tent (double check because sometime tents are excluded).\n\nThe parks generally have central ablution facilities.\n\nAlso see the By motorhome and By offroad vehicle sections for additional camping options.\n\nTimeshare\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are many timeshare resorts in South Africa, most participate in international exchange agreements. Many timeshare owners also rent their time when they can not make use of it.\n\nLong-term\n\n[edit]\n\nMany real estate agents in South Africa also offer rental services. The rental properties are mostly available on unfurnished long term lease, but you will also find furnished properties on offer with 1 to 12-month lease agreements\n\nYour local branch of an international estate agent with a presence in South Africa might also be able to assist you.\n\nStay safe\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: Up-to-date safety advice for visitors is published regularly by the British Government and the United States Government.\n\nSee also the warning about security at O.R. Tambo International Airport.\n\nSouth Africa has very few earthquakes, cyclones, tornadoes, floods, terrorist incidents or contagious diseases (with the notable exception of HIV).\n\nHowever, South Africa has some of the highest violent crime rates in the world, though by being vigilant and using common sense, you should have a safe and pleasant trip as millions of other people have each year. The key is to know and stick to general safety precautions: never walk around in deserted areas at night or advertise possession of money or expensive accessories.\n\nCrime levels are relatively high in South Africa, however, perceptions can be misleading because statistically, most of the criminal activity is concentrated around certain specific townships and perpetrated by specialised criminal organizations connected to copper theft, car theft, transportation of goods and cash in transit theft, home or business and warehouse break-ins, smuggling, drug dealing, prostitution and so on. Opportunistic attacks like robberies or muggings of individuals outside those areas are very uncommon unless one mixes with low life characters or ventures into seedy joints or gangster neighborhoods. As far as tourism goes, most embassies and tourist organizations will have lists of known areas to avoid. If you drive around, you'll notice some bad road behaviour, however inconsiderate it may be to you, just ignore it and make sure there isn't a road rage incident. Like anywhere else, as a general rule, it's advisable for visitors to keep valuables out of sight and to keep a low profile. All South Africans are in general a nice bunch of people but as in any society, there's always a couple of bad apples mixed in the barrel.\n\nDo not accept offers from friendly strangers. Do not wear a tummy bag with all your valuables; consider a concealed money belt worn under your shirt instead. Leave passports and other valuables in a safe or other secure location. Although most banks and exchange bureaus require your passport in order to exchange foreign monies to Rands, in South Africa it's legal to carry authenticated photocopies of documents in lieu of originals. To get documents authenticated free of charge, take the original and copies to any South African Police station and ask the officer on duty to help you. The papers will be good for 90 days from police stamp date. Do not carry large sums of money. Do not walk at night through deserted places. Hide that you are a tourist: conceal your camera and binoculars. Do not leave your valuables in plain sight when driving in your car, as \"smash and grab\" attacks sometimes occur at certain hot spot intersections, and keep your car doors locked and your windows open less than half way. Know where to go so that you avoid getting lost or needing a map: that will avoid signs.\n\nIf you are carrying bags, try to hook them under a table or chair leg when sitting down, as this will prevent them from being snatched.\n\nVisiting the townships is possible, but don't go alone unless you really know where you're going. Some townships are safe while others can be extremely dangerous. Go with an experienced guide. Some tour companies offer perfectly safe guided visits to the townships.\n\nTaking an evening stroll or walking to venues after dark can be very risky. It is not part of the culture there, as it is in Europe, North America or Australia. It is best to take a taxi (a metered cab, not a minibus taxi) or private vehicle for an \"evening out\". The same applies to picking up hitchhikers or offering assistance at broken-down car scenes. It is best to ignore anyone who appears to be in distress at the side of the road as it could be part of a scam. Keep going until you see a police station and tell them about what you have seen.\n\nIf you are driving in South Africa, when police officers stop you to check your licence, and you show them an overseas driver's licence, they may come out with some variant of `Have you got written permission from [random government department] to drive in our country?' If your licence is written in English or you have an International Driving Permit then they can't do anything. Stand your ground and state this fact - be polite, courteous and don't pay any money (bribes). Furthermore, any foreign drivers license with English on it is valid in South Africa for ninety days from day of entry, and the corresponding passport may need to be presented together. After ninety days, a foreign drivers licence maybe deemed invalid and need to be converted to a SA driver licence, as the legal status of such foreigners may fall within the temporary resident requirements.\n\nTake extra care when driving at night. Unlike in Europe and North America, vast stretches of South African roads, especially in rural areas, are poorly lit or often completely unlit. This includes highways. Be extra careful as wildlife and people often walk in the middle of the road in smaller towns (not cities like Pretoria, Johannesburg, or Cape Town). You must also take extra care when driving in South Africa due to the risk of carjackings.\n\nIf you are driving a car with an \"out-of-town\" numberplate, you will draw attention to yourself. If possible, use a car that is registered in the town or province where you are using it. If this is not possible, be extra vigilant.\n\nImportant telephone numbers\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom a fixed line\n\n[edit]\n\n107 - Emergency (in Cape Town, only from fixed lines)\n\n10111 - Police\n\n10177 - Ambulance\n\nFrom a mobile phone\n\n[edit]\n\n112- All emergencies\n\nInternational calls at local rates\n\n[edit]\n\nStep 1: Dial: 087 150 0823 from any mobile or landline\n\nStep 2: Dial destination number and press #\n\ne.g. 00 44 11 123 4567 #\n\nCountries: USA, UK (landline), India, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong and many more.\n\nSupported on: Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, Telkom and Neotel\n\nWildlife\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the main reasons travellers visit South Africa is to experience the outdoors and see the wide range of wildlife.\n\nWhen driving in a wildlife reserve, always keep to the speed limits and stay inside your car at all times. On game drives or walks, always follow the instructions of your guide.\n\nDo not drive too close to elephants. Be prepared to back up very quickly if they charge at you. Elephants are strong enough to roll many small cars. They can destroy small cars by sitting on them (which means they blow out all tires and windows and bend the frame beyond repair) while you scream for your life inside.\n\nEnsure that you wear socks and boots whenever you are walking in the bush; do not wear open sandals. A good pair of boots can stop snake and insect bites and avoid any possible cuts that may lead to infections.\n\nIn many areas you may encounter wildlife while driving on public roads, monkeys and baboons are especially common. Do not get out of the vehicle to take photos or otherwise try to interact with the animals. These are wild animals and their actions can be unpredictable.\n\nSometimes you might find yourself in the open with wild animals (often happens with baboons at Cape Point). Keep your distance and always ensure that the animals are only to one side of you, do not walk between two groups or individuals. A female baboon may become upset if you come between her and her child.\n\nAlways check with locals before swimming in a river or lake as there may be crocodiles or hippos. Most major beaches in KwaZulu-Natal have shark nets installed. If you intend to swim anywhere other that the main beaches, check with a local first.\n\nShark nets may be removed for a couple of days during the annual sardine run (normally along the KwaZulu-Natal coast between early May and late July). This is done to avoid excessive shark and other marine life fatalities. Notices are posted on beaches during these times.\n\nLoadshedding\n\n[edit]\n\nSouth Africa is well-known for its ongoing energy crisis which has resulted in daily blackouts for the better part of the decade. Known by the locals as 'loadshedding', the failure of the public energy grid has become a fact of life to many South Africans but poses as an unexpected roadblock to many travellers.\n\nLoadshedding times are classified into 'stages'. The higher the stage, the more blackouts there will be per day and the longer they will last. As of 2024, only on holidays will there be no scheduled loadshedding, so this is the best time to visit. The current schedule and stage can be viewed on the public energy supplier Eskoms website by typing in your local municipality. Blackouts can be as often as once or twice a day lasting two and a half hours each at stage 1-2, and at the higher stages it can be up to 3-5 times a day sometimes lasting up to four and a half hours each. Some days there may only be a few hours of power available.\n\nThe stage can unexpectedly increase and decrease without warning, often 4-5 times a week. However, most hotels, malls and restaurants have in-built inverters and solar panels and at the very least Wi-Fi hooked up to a battery, so some utilities can be expected in more affluent places. It is advisable to bring your own portable cell phone chargers as working charging ports may not be accessible for some periods of the day.\n\nThe City of Cape Town uses its own facilities to reduce the impact of loadshedding on areas purchasing electricity through the City of Cape Town. The impact is generally one level lower than the rest of the country. Private industry and business usually have backup power to keep them running through loadshedding, but most government offices and state owned organisations do not function when loadshedding is active. Some areas of Cape Town get power directly from Eskom, and they get the full loadshedding schedule. In some places the hospitals are exempt, as may be anyone else getting power from the same substation.\n\nBe aware that crime rate is significantly higher during these blackout periods as cameras and home security systems are often disabled, and even police lines may be down. Finding a rental or hotel that utilizes private security may be ideal, although this is almost always the case for the more prosperous parts of the country.\n\nRespect\n\n[edit]\n\nSouth Africans are generally polite, friendly and accommodating to tourists. Talking slightly loud outdoors is quite normal, as South Africans tend to be a free thinking and exuberant bunch of people and such behaviour is ok amongst friends and acquaintances. Strangers should observe general protocols of politeness at first and if accepted, \"when in Rome, do like Romans do\". Smiling and acknowledging strangers is normal behaviour and a slight head nod or hand wave common practice. Striking an occasional chat with complete strangers in places like bus stops, supermarkets, bars, government buildings, public transportation, petrol stations, shops, etc., also happens regularly.\n\nPublic behaviour is very similar to what you might find in Europe. Heterosexual displays of affection in public are not frowned upon unless you overdo it. Homosexual displays of affection may generate unwelcome attention although they will be tolerated and respected in the more gay-friendly and cosmopolitan areas of Johannesburg (Sandton, Rosebank and Parkhurst), Cape Town (Greenpoint, Clifton and De Waterkant) and Durban. South Africa is the first and only African nation where the government recognizes same-sex relationships and homosexual marriages are recognized by law.\n\nMen generally greet with a firm handshake, while women will do the continental kiss on the cheek.\n\nExcept for designated beaches, nude sunbathing is illegal, although topless sunbathing for women is acceptable along Durban and Umhlanga beaches, and Cape Town's Clifton and Camps Bay beaches. Thong bikinis for ladies or swimming trunks for men (speedos if you really have to) and regular swimming costumes are the norm, otherwise, you may be openly stared at.\n\nEating is generally done the British way with the fork in their left hand and the tines pointed downward. Burgers, pizzas, bunny chows and any other fast foods are eaten by hand. It is generally also acceptable to steal a piece of boerewors (sausage) from the braai (barbecue grill) with your hands. Depending on which cultural group you find yourself with, these rules might change. Indians often eat breyani (rice-based) dishes with their hands, a white person of British descent might insist on eating his pizza with a knife and fork or a black person might eat pap-and-stew with a spoon. Be flexible, but don't be afraid to also do your own thing; if really unacceptable, people will generally tell you so rather than take offence.\n\nSouth Africans are proud of their country and what they have achieved. Although they often complain about the problems and shortcomings that still exist, you should try not to criticise the country's current and past history; it can cause offence. South Africans know more about their country than you do.\n\nAlthough mannerisms vary from ethnic group to ethnic group, South Africans, in general, are direct communicators. A South African is likely to tell you exactly what they think or disagree with you on the spot, and at times, they may come across as blunt or even assertive. However, keep in mind that South Africans generally don't intend to cause offence.\n\nRace and apartheid\n\n[edit]\n\nThose who are more accustomed to North American racial terminology should understand that words that are familiar to them have different meanings in South Africa, and the rules for what terms are polite or not are different. There are many South Africans that think classification according to skin colour or appearance in general, whether for political or social reasons, is inappropriate and would prefer to be referred to as simply South African irrespective of what you think they look like.\n\nUnder apartheid the citizens were legally divided into four groups:\n\nBlack: the indigenous Bantu peoples\n\nColoured: a mixed-race cultural group with white and African ancestors from the early colonial period, mostly Afrikaans speaking. Under Apartheid, the indigenous Khoisan peoples, the Cape Malays and the ethnic Chinese community were also classified as \"coloured\", but these groups generally don't identify as such and are nowadays usually not included in the term.\n\nWhite: the South Africans of European heritage (traditionally either Afrikaans or English speaking) and the Japanese\n\nIndian: people whose ancestors came from India during the British colonial period\n\nAlthough you probably will hear those terms, it might be better to avoid using them yourself altogether. For the indigenous, think of Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, etc. instead. For the non-Bantu, the old exonyms are problematic or worse. Khoisan is the umbrella term commonly used for them all, both the Khoekhoe peoples and the San peoples. At least the San prefer the names of their individual nations.\n\nMost people with foreign ancestry identify as South African, not Dutch, Indian, Malay or Chinese — most have family who have lived in South Africa for centuries, and the only continent they can call home is Africa. Calling somebody Dutch, for example, can be taken as an insult. Also the term Boer is considered pejorative.\n\nIt is wise to avoid racial or political remarks while in South Africa if you don't have a good understanding of South African history, because the country's very diverse cultural disposition means that \"putting your foot in it\" is easy. However, you will encounter many South Africans who lived through the apartheid period and are willing to talk about their experiences of the time. It can be very interesting to speak with them about their experiences, and if you have an open mind and willingness to listen, you can avoid offence. New criminal laws have been enacted to punish people that insist on publicly using racist language.\n\nSouth Africa is now in its fourth decade since the end of apartheid — a very sensitive issue for everyone — in 1990, but it is always easier to change laws than people. You will occasionally still hear overtly racist remarks, which can come from members of any racial group in South Africa. This is more common from the older generation than the younger ones. The best thing to do is simply ignore it; leave the responsibility for enlightening lectures to other South Africans, who know the subject better than any foreign traveller, as they have lived it. South Africans of different races generally treat each other politely at a personal level. Broadly speaking, non-white South Africans have shown a very high degree of mental toughness, endurance, intelligence, tolerance and forgiveness to their former oppressors, with younger generations of all races mingling and socializing with one another and finding more common ground and a sense of national identity, while some older generations of all races may long for \"the good old days\" when time seemed to stand still and strict law and order enforcement ruled the day. Political movements are another matter, and political parties have been aligned along the racial fault lines of the society although there is starting to be a move toward better integration. Although politically there's growing racial integration and overlapping, the majority of black South Africans vote for the African National Congress (ANC), and the majority of white and Coloured South Africans vote for the liberal centrist Democratic Alliance (DA). The third major party, supported by a minority of black South Africans, is the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a far-left nationalistic party that advocates for the expropriation of white people's property without compensation, and for material compensation to be given to black people for the losses and suffering endured under colonialism and apartheid. It also wants criminal prosecution reinstated against surviving perpetrators of the apartheid regime for crimes against humanity. Politics in South Africa can be a touchy issue, and it's best to talk about it with care and empathy.\n\nInterracial marriages are becoming quite common, and, except for possibly some of the older generation, people no longer take offence if you and your partner are not the same colour.\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nGenerally speaking, South Africans tend to be more religious than Westerners, and most South Africans attend church regularly. By far the dominant religion in South Africa is Christianity, though South African Christians belong to a wide range of different denominations, with no denomination forming a majority. It is common for South Africans to invite new acquaintances to their church, though no offence will be taken if you decline. Islam is practised by most of the Cape Malays and Hinduism by many of the Indians, while there is also a small community of Ashkenazi Jews, most of whom are descended from 19th and early 20th century immigrants from Lithuania. Generally speaking, freedom of religion is respected in South Africa, and you should not run into any problems regardless of what faith you profess."
