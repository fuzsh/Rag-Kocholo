        "text": "Welcome to \"Building a better South Africa, together\", a web series brought to you by Anglo American in partnership with News24.\n\nSouth Africans are known for their unwavering determination and have earned a reputation for resiliency. We possess the ability to adapt to challenging circumstances but at the same time, an underlying weariness has settled upon the nation, stemming from the pressing challenges we all face on numerous fronts â the electricity crisis, crime and corruption, alarmingly high levels of unemployment across all age groups and an extreme income gap that ranks among the highest globally, among others.\n\nWe are setting our sights on new achievements. While it is true that there are challenges in our country, corporate South Africa remains optimistic and believes that the situation is not hopeless. The efforts and sacrifices made by our countryâs people to reclaim our nation cannot be overlooked or disregarded. South African corporations continue to support efforts by members of society to make the country investable (again).\n\nFor Anglo American, this action is defined by an initiative weâre calling âBuilding a better South Africa, togetherâ, which aims to leverage our collective strength and play both leading and supporting roles in addressing what we see as South Africa's triple challenges: crime and corruption, energy challenges and infrastructure issues.\n\nBeyond a doubt, investment is the lifeblood of any economy â it is imperative to help us create economic opportunities and sustain jobs. Anglo American supports South Africaâs ambition to become a favourable investment destination, where the rule of law, sound policy implementation, and structural reforms are at the heart of encouraging further investment. This will be the bedrock upon which economic recovery and growth can be built, in a sustainable way and benefitting all.\n\nOur commitment is to help the economy overcome problems like low growth, collapsing infrastructure, and rampant crime and corruption. Extreme levels of inequality and unemployment is a challenge we take seriously â and one that we are committed to putting into action with actionable solutions.\n\nTo address the issue at hand, genuine transformation must take place. Bold action is required â not just through the creation of committees or discussions, but through collaborative, concerted, aligned, and measurable action to improve our nation.\n\nLook at our immense national potential. It lives in abundant natural resources; it exists in opportunities to tap into plentiful renewable energy sources and takes form in the advantage of our youthful population.\n\nThe starting point is to create an enabling environment that gives our country a chance for success. That pathway is lit by a collaborative approach where people put self-interest aside and work together with a bias for action â not talk, but real action which produces measurable results that demonstrate improvement.\n\nIt is crucial for the government, the private sector, labour, and civil society to collaborate to bring about meaningful change. The responsibility cannot rest on any one party alone, nor can individuals achieve the desired outcomes. It is imperative that all stakeholders unite around shared objectives and work collectively towards attaining them.\n\nThe turnaround we need starts here because it is our South Africa to build better, together."
