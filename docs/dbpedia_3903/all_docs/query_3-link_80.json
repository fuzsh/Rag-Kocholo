        "text": "Who is a 'refugee'?\n\nRefugees are people forced to flee their own country and seek safety in another country. They are unable to return to their own country because of feared persecution as a result of who they are, what they believe in or say, or because of armed conflict, violence or serious public disorder.\n\nMany have been forced to flee with little more than the clothes on their back, leaving behind their homes, possessions, jobs and loved ones. They may have suffered human rights violations, been injured in their flight, or seen family members or friends killed or attacked.\n\nToday, there are 43.4 million refugees globally. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is mandated to protect 31.6 million refugees and 5.8 million other people in need of international protection. A further 6 million Palestine refugees are supported by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which was set up in 1949 to care for displaced Palestinians.\n\nRefugees and international law\n\nThe 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are the key legal documents that protect refugees. They provide the universal definition of who is a refugee and outline the minimum standards for their treatment. The cornerstone is the principle of non-refoulment (Article 33) which states that refugees have a right not to be sent back to their country of origin if their life or freedom would be at risk.\n\nCountries that have signed the Convention are obliged to treat refugees according to the standards outlined. UNHCR promotes States’ accession to the Convention and helps governments translate it into national laws.\n\nLearn more about the 1951 Refugee Convention.\n\nWho decides who is a refugee?\n\nPeople will usually go through a process known as refugee status determination to establish whether their circumstances make them a refugee. This is usually done by host countries, or by UNHCR when support is needed. When vast numbers of people are forced to flee at once, everyone fleeing that country may be granted refugee status on a ‘prima facie’ basis so that cases do not need to be examined individually.\n\nWhat is the difference between a refugee and a migrant?\n\nA refugee is someone who has been forced to flee conflict or persecution and has crossed an international border to seek safety. They cannot return to their country without risking their life or freedoms. It is a legal term that carries with it certain protections that refugees are entitled to.\n\nThe term ‘migrant’ does not have an international legal definition. However, it is commonly understood to refer to someone who has chosen to leave their home to start a new life in another country. A migrant can return home without risking their life or freedom. The movement is understood to be voluntary.\n\nPeople who are likely to be asylum-seekers or refugees should not be referred to as migrants. To do so can undermine the legal protections afforded to refugees under international law."
