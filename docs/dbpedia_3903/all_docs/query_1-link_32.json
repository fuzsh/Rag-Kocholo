        "text": "Nathaniel Philbrick (b. 1956)\n\n“For me, [Moby-Dick] is kind of a personal Bible. It's got the meaning of what America is all about….” – Nathaniel Philbrick in the Washington Independent Review of Books\n\nNathaniel Philbrick—named after the 19th-century author Nathaniel Hawthorne—was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His mother was a kindergarten teacher and his father was an English professor specializing in maritime literature who talked about Herman Melville’s novel Moby-Dick so often that by the time Philbrick was a teenager, he “already hated the book, even though I hadn’t read a word of it,” he told the NEA. Then in high school he read the first sentence and he was “harpooned.” Reading the novel “was a transformative experience for me [and] it put me in the awkward situation of having to admit that my father had been right.” It remains his favorite novel.\n\nPhilbrick’s passion for sailboat racing, on the other hand, was deeply personal and apparent from the start. “For me in 1970, a teenager in desperate need of an escape from all the land-based problems of the world, there had been something elemental and all-consuming about a Sunfish,” he writes in his memoir, Second Wind. As a sailboat, the Sunfish “might be ugly,” he writes, but it’s “fast.... Whether it was on the Monongahela River or a man-made lake, I spent just about every weekend jousting against my younger brother in a Sunfish.”\n\nPhilbrick attended Brown University, where he majored in English and became the school’s first Intercollegiate All-American sailor in 1978, the same year he won the Sunfish North American championship against “178 of the most competitive Sunfish sailors on the continent” (Second Wind). After he received an MA in American literature from Duke University, he worked for Sailing World magazine and wrote and edited several books on sailing. In 1986, he moved with his wife—also a sailing expert—and their two children to Nantucket. “I was a stay-at-home dad who only got out of the house to take my two kids to the playground,” he writes in Second Wind. That is, until 1992 when another attempt at the Sunfish championship that he’d won 15 years earlier led him on a cross-country odyssey and eventually back home with a new passion for Nantucket’s history and community. In 1994, he published his first book about the island’s history, Away Off Shore, followed in 1998 by Abram’s Eyes, a study of Nantucket’s native legacy. He became a founding director of Nantucket’s Egan Maritime Institute and is still a research fellow at the Nantucket Historical Association.\n\n“When I was at Brown,” Philbrick told the Paris Review, “I wanted to write the great American novel, but I was too scared to take a creative course. I signed up for one, got in, and just didn’t have the courage to go. I was a tremendously shy person, almost pathologically shy. The thought of peers critiquing my work—oh, God.” Today, Philbrick is the bestselling author of more than ten books of nonfiction, including In the Heart of the Sea (Penguin, 2000), winner of a National Book Award and the basis for a 2015 movie of the same name directed by Ron Howard; Mayflower (Viking, 2006), which was a finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize in History and the Los Angeles Times Book Award, and won the Massachusetts Book Award for nonfiction; The Last Stand (Viking, 2010), which inspired the PBS American Experience film “Custer’s Last Stand”; and Why Read Moby-Dick? (Viking, 2011), which was a finalist for the New England Society Book Award.\n\n“I have been a fan of Stephen King’s since I was a teenager,” Philbrick told the New York Times. “I may write history, but all my books are horror stories of one kind or another.” Other influences, he added, include Anne Tyler, whose “sense of life as a survival tale, of ordinary people being nibbled to death by loss, was the world I knew as a kid in Pittsburgh”; and Cormac McCarthy, whose “vision of American history—of a howling wilderness of violence and wonder—convinced me that the past was where I wanted to go.” Among his favorite nonfiction books, he says, are Alfred Lansing’s Endurance and Walter Lord’s A Night to Remember, which “set the standard when it comes to dramatic, impeccably researched storytelling.” His three favorite 20th-century books about the sea are all novels: Peter Matthiessen’s Far Tortuga, Charles Johnson’s Middle Passage, and Robert Stone’s Outerbridge Reach (New York Times).\n\n“The challenge of writing any history, any nonfiction,” Philbrick explains in an interview with the Paris Review, “is that there’s just so much you have to know. Seventy-five percent of my time is reading and taking notes,” which he says he mostly does in his basement office. “I call it the bunker. My notes are all over the place. Maps all over the place. Books everywhere. It’s a mess, a total mess.” Philbrick might spend the morning there, then break midday for a walk to the local pharmacy for a ham and pickle sandwich. “I don’t get out much. I am just in my house, alone. The challenge I have is not going crazy.” He’ll go back to work in the afternoon, perhaps continuing the struggle of finding a way in to his narrative. “I’ll have forty drafts of how I’m going to start the book…. I’m deconstructing myself, second guessing myself. Where am I coming from? What is this about? What’s the voice? The tone?” He works long hours until his wife comes home for dinner, after which he might watch “stupid TV” until he goes to bed. “I don’t sleep well when I’m working on a book. Sentences will be in my head, and I’ll wake up and scribble something down. Usually it’s not helpful. I just have to get the book done, or else I’d have a breakdown” (Paris Review).\n\nToday, Philbrick is a proud husband, father, and grandfather who, when he’s not in his basement, continues to enjoy the past and current offerings of his Nantucket home. On one particular weekend, he reminisces on his website, “a pod of pilot whales beached on the north shore of the island, and Nantucketers worked ceaselessly for an entire day in a vain attempt to save the very same whales their forefathers would have instinctively massacred. Times change.”\n\nSeptember 2018"
