        "text": "Season five, which will include 10 new episodes, premieres on Sunday, February 18 at 9 p.m., and it's going to be a good one. “For those who have—and haven’t—watched the series, I can promise that season five is the most gripping, heartwarming, amusing, and emotional season to date,” the series' new show runner Alfonso Moreno told Deseret News. “It will be a weekly hour well spent.”\n\nThe talented cast includes several seasoned actors you've probably seen elsewhere. Prior to starring in When Calls the Heart, Erin Krakow acted in Army Wives, Lori Loughlin was known as Aunt Becky on Full House and Fuller House, and Jack Wagner made a name for himself on General Hospital and Melrose Place. You may also recognize Canadian actor Kavan Smith who plays Leland “Lee” Coulter. Prior to joining the show in season two, Kavan, 47, acted in Stargate Atlantis, Smallville, Supernatural, and many more shows and movies.\n\nWhile the picturesque village of Coal Valley is a made-up place in rural Canada, the show is filmed in Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada—and it's just as beautiful as the book describes it. \"It's God's country,\" Lori told Metro News. \"The mountains and the set they've built are extraordinary. The costumes we get to wear help you with setting the right tone. You don't have to use a lot of your imagination because it's right there visually for you to see.\"\n\nA team of just 25 crew members built the entire set in under a month including the exterior and interiors of the small church, saloon, schoolhouse, outpost, mercantile, cafe, and other town buildings. What's even more impressive is that each component of the set is each decked out with period furniture and real antiques, according to The Huffington Post.\n\nIn between filming seasons, fans can tour Coal Valley for a few special days each year, according to What's Filming. Annual tours and events are organized by Hearties Family Reunion. Stay tuned about tour information for 2018.\n\nThe actors are all friends in real life and really enjoy working with each other—so much so, they say that it comes through in their acting. “The chemistry and love that a cast has for each other is palpable to the viewer,” Lori told From the Desk of Kurt Manwaring. “People at home pick up on the energy and they find themselves wanting to sit down and spend time with those characters.”\n\nJust like a few other incredibly popular series (Twilight, Harry Potter, Sherlock, etc.), fans of When Calls the Heart write their own fan fiction. You can find Elizabeth, Jack, and the rest of the Coal Valley crew taking on new adventures in spinoff stories on FanFiction.net, or check out several #heartie favorites on The Hearties."
