        "text": "James Patterson’s Alex Cross Books in Order\n\nRead Each One of James Patterson's Alex Cross Books in Order\n\nDeadly Cross (November 2020)\n\nDeadly Cross\n\nJames Patterson\n\nThe murder of a glamorous DC socialite becomes Alex Cross’s deadliest case since Along Came a Spider.\n\nKay Willingham led a life as glamorous as it was public—she was a gorgeous Georgetown socialite, philanthropist, and the ex-wife of the vice president. So why was she parked in a Bentley convertible idling behind a DC private school, in the middle of the night, with the man who was the head of that school? Who shot them both, point blank, and why? The shocking double homicide is blazed across the internet, TV, newspapers—and across Alex Cross's mind. Kay had been his patient once. And maybe more.\n\nWhile John Sampson of DC Metro Police investigates the last movements of Christopher Randall, the educator killed along with Kay Willingham, detective Alex Cross and FBI special agent Ned Mahoney find unanswered questions from Willingham's past, before she arrived in DC and became known in DC society as someone who could make things happen. They travel to Alabama to investigate Kay's early years. There they find a world of trouble, corruption, and secrets, all of them closed to outsiders like Cross and Mahoney.\n\nKay had many enemies, but all of them seemed to need her alive. The harder the investigators push, the more resistance they find when they leave behind the polite law offices and doctors' quarters of the state capital. Alex Cross will need to use all his skills as a doctor, a detective, and a family man to prevent that resistance from turning lethal . . . again.\n\nCriss Cross (November 2019)\n\nCriss Cross\n\nJames Patterson\n\nWhen a mysterious serial killer known as \"M\" launches a deranged \"investigation\", Alex Cross and his partner must unearth long-forgotten secrets to survive -- or risk getting buried themselves.\n\nIn a Virginia penitentiary, Alex Cross and his partner, John Sampson, witness the execution of a killer they helped convict. Hours later, they are called to the scene of a copycat crime. A note signed \"M\" rests on the corpse. \"You messed up big time, Dr. Cross.\"\n\nWas an innocent man just put to death? Alex soon realizes he may have much to answer for, as \"M\" lures the detective out of the capital to the sites of multiple homicides, all marked with distressingly familiar details -- details that conjure up decades-old cases. Details that conjure up Cross family secrets. Details that make clear that M is after a prize so dear that -- were the killer to attain it -- Alex's heart would no longer have reason to beat.\n\nTarget: Alex Cross (November 2018)\n\nTarget: Alex Cross\n\nJames Patterson\n\nWhen a ring of six elite assassins strikes D. C., Alex Cross teams up with the Secret Service and the FBI to take down a dangerous threat that could destroy America.\n\nA leader has fallen, and Alex Cross joins the procession of mourners from Capitol Hill to the White House. Then a sniper's bullet strikes a target in the heart of D.C. Alex Cross's wife, Bree Stone, must either solve the case or lose her position as the city's newly elevated chief of detectives. The Secret Service and the FBI deploy as well in the race to find the shooter. Alex is tasked by the new President to lead an investigation unprecedented in scale and scope. But is the sniper's strike only the beginning of a larger attack on the nation?\n\nThe People vs. Alex Cross (November 2017)\n\nThe People vs. Alex Cross\n\nJames Patterson\n\nWith explosive charges and shocking evidence, Alex Cross is about to face the trial of the century in the #1 New York Times bestselling series.\n\nAlex Cross is on the wrong side of the law.

But will a jury see it that way?\n\nWhen his former partner Sampson shows up needing his help, Cross jumps at the chance, even if it may end up costing him what's left of his career. When a string of young, blonde women go missing, the investigation leads Cross and Sampson to the most depraved, darkest corners of the internet, where murder is just another form of entertainment.\n\nAs the prosecution presents its case, and the nation watches, even those closest to Cross begin to doubt his innocence. If he can't convince his own family that he didn't pull the trigger with intent to kill, how can he hope to persuade a jury? But even with everything on the line, Cross will do whatever it takes to stop a dangerous criminal . . . even if he can't save himself.\n\nStruggling to prove his own innocence and uncover the truth lurking online, Cross must risk everything to save his most at-risk patient of all: himself.\n\nCross the Line (November 2016)\n\nCross the Line\n\nJames Patterson\n\nHomicide Detective Alex Cross teams up with his wife to beat a D. C. criminal at his own game.\n\nWashington, DC, has never been more dangerous. After shots pierce the tranquil nighttime calm of Rock Creek Park, a man is dead: what looks at first like road rage might be something much more sinister. But Alex has only just begun asking questions when he's called across town to investigate a new murder, one that hits close to home: his former boss and the beloved mentor of Alex's wife, Bree.\n\nNow there's a killer on the loose, a long list of possible suspects, a city in panic, and nobody in charge of the besieged police force. . . until Bree gets tapped for the job.\n\nAs Bree scrambles to find her footing and close two high-profile cases, new violence stuns the capital. What should be a time for her to rely on Alex for support and cooperation is instead a moment of crisis in their marriage as well as their city when their investigative instincts clash and their relationship reaches a breaking point.\n\nAnd the fiendish mind behind all the violence has appointed himself judge, jury, and executioner, with a terrifying master plan he's only begun to put in motion. To beat him at his own game, Alex and Bree must take the law back into their own hands before he puts them both out of commission . . . permanently.\n\nCross Justice (November 2015)\n\nCross Justice\n\nJames Patterson\n\nFor Alex Cross, the toughest cases hit close to home-and in this deadly thrill ride, he's trying to solve the most personal mystery of his life.\n\nWhen his cousin is accused of a heinous crime, Alex Cross returns to his North Carolina hometown for the first time in over three decades. As he tries to prove his cousin's innocence in a town where everyone seems to be on the take, Cross unearths a family secret that forces him to question everything he's ever known.\n\nChasing a ghost he believed was long dead, Cross gets pulled into a case that has local cops scratching their heads and needing his help: a grisly string of socialite murders. Now he's hot on the trail of both a brutal killer, and the truth about his own past-and the answers he finds might be fatal.\n\nHope to Die (November 2014)\n\nHope to Die\n\nJames Patterson\n\nDetective Alex Cross is being stalked by a psychotic genius, forced to play the deadliest game of his career.\n\nCross's family-his loving wife Bree, the wise and lively Nana Mama, and his precious children-have been ripped away.

Now, his life ruined, Creem is out of jail, and he's made sure that no one will recognize him-by giving himself a new face.\n\nA young woman is found hanging from a sixth-floor window, and Alex is called to the scene. The victim recently gave birth, but the baby is nowhere to be found. Before Alex can begin searching for the missing newborn and killer, he's called to investigate a second crime. All of Washington, D.C., is in a panic, and when a third body is discovered, rumours of three serial killers send the city into an all-out frenzy.\n\nAlex's investigations are going nowhere, and he's too focused on the cases to notice that someone has been watching him-and will stop at nothing until he's dead. With white-hot speed, relentless drama, and hairpin turns, Alex Cross, Run is James Patterson's ultimate thrill ride.\n\nMerry Christmas, Alex Cross (November 2012)\n\nMerry Christmas, Alex Cross\n\nJames Patterson\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Alex Cross must risk everything to solve a mystery and stop a hostage situation from spiraling out of control.\n\nIt's Christmas Eve and Detective Alex Cross has been called out to catch someone who's robbing his church's poor box.
