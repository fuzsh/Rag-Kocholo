        "text": "The Best Books You Should Read Before Traveling Africa\n\nLast updated on May 5, 2024 by Shannon\n\nAs a continent, Africa has long fascinated me. Evolution points to Africa as a pivotal point in our collective history as civilization. The tribes and people of Africa create a tapestry of culture and humanity unlike any other place on Earth.\n\nWhy read travel books about Africa?\n\nWhy not? It’s a continent filled with diverse landscapes and wildlife found nowhere else on earth, then there’s the rampant development issues, human rights concerns, shifting politics and geopolitics. There are tribal histories and accounts of lifestyles entirely different than life in most Western countries.\n\nWhile you should read books about single individual countries you plan to visit, there are also phenomenal travel books set across the continent. And some stories are set in one place but explore themes and issues applicable to wider swaths of the continent.\n\nBest Non-Fiction Books About Africa\n\nReading non-fiction about Africa is crucial for travelers as it offers authentic insights into the continent’s diverse cultures, history, and socio-political landscapes, helping them understand and appreciate the complexities and beauty of the places they visit.\n\nIt also enables a more meaningful and respectful travel experience by providing context and depth to the destinations, beyond the surface-level perceptions often portrayed in popular media.\n\n1. Long Walk to Freedom by Nelson Mandela\n\nIf you read to better understand a place, start with this autobiography of the great South African leader, detailing his fight against apartheid and his years in prison. It provides essential insight into the country’s struggle against apartheid. It meticulously chronicles his journey from childhood to becoming a pivotal figure in South African history, including his 27 years of imprisonment.\n\nThe narrative not only sheds light on the personal sacrifices made in the fight for freedom and equality but also offers a deep understanding of South Africa’s socio-political landscape.\n\n2. Dark Star Safari: Overland from Cairo to Capetown by Paul Theroux\n\nTheroux immerses readers in an Africa seldom seen, skillfully intertwining his overland journey from Cairo to Cape Town with insightful commentary on the internal politics and regional history that shape the landscape.\n\nHis narrative brings to life the contrasts and challenges of the continent, providing an intimate glimpse into the heart of Africa through the eyes of a seasoned traveler. This book is a must-read for those seeking a deeper understanding of the complexities and beauty of African travel beyond the conventional tourist experience.\n\n3. The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind by William Kamkwamba\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this inspiring true story recounting the remarkable journey of a young Malawian boy who, despite facing incredible adversity, uses his ingenuity to change his village’s fate.\n\nOvercoming poverty and a lack of formal education, he builds a windmill from scrap materials and a library book, bringing electricity and hope to his community. The narrative not only highlights the transformative power of innovation and resilience but also offers a heartening look at life in rural Africa.\n\n4. Out of Africa by Karen Blixen\n\nThis memoir offers an evocative portrayal of Africa at the turn of the century, chronicling the author’s experiences on a Kenyan coffee plantation. It provides an intimate glimpse into daily life and the natural beauty of the landscape, while also critically examining the attitudes and colonial policies of British East Africa during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nIt’s an easy read and a classic book recommendation because it covers a broad range of issues unique to colonial Africa and is set in a compelling landscape.\n\n5. The Flame Trees of Thika: Memories of an African Childhood by Elspeth Huxley\n\nAt the tender age of six, Huxley’s world transforms as she moves from England to Kenya, experiencing her formative years amidst the striking landscapes of early 20th century Africa.\n\nThis memoir is rich with vivid descriptions and imaginative imagery, painting a captivating picture of her childhood adventures and the enchanting African setting. The author’s engaging narrative style inspires a sense of wanderlust in both young readers and adults with its intimate portrayal of a bygone era in a land of breathtaking beauty and complexity.\n\n6. Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad\n\nIn this thought-provoking novella, Conrad delves into the depths of the Congo, offering a stark exploration of post-colonial insights, politics, and attitudes.\n\nThrough vivid descriptions and intense storytelling, the book challenges readers with its complex themes and portrayal of the African landscape and its people during a tumultuous period. I struggled to get into this book the first time I started it, but then ploughed through it in a day the second time.\n\n7. Skeletons on the Zahara: A True Story of Survival by Dean King\n\nThis gripping narrative transports readers to the early 1800s, recounting the harrowing tale of a shipwreck off the African coast. The survivors’ ordeal of dehydration, enslavement, and struggle for survival in harsh desert conditions is vividly portrayed.\n\nThe book is rich with historical details about the region, offering insights into camel history and the cultural landscape of the time. Its compelling storyline, combined with factual historical context, makes it a captivating read for those interested in adventure, survival, and the historical intricacies of Africa.\n\n8. A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier by Ishmael Beah\n\nThis memoir offers a heart-wrenching and eye-opening account of a young boy’s life as a child soldier in Sierra Leone. It vividly captures the horrors of war and the resilience of the human spirit.\n\nThe author’s journey from innocence to forced participation in violence and his eventual path to healing provides a deeply personal perspective on the impacts of conflict.\n\nAlthough these style of books are hard to read, you should read this one to truly understand what has happened to children across Africa—Uganda, Somalia, Sudan, the DRC, CAR—not just Sierra Leone.\n\n9. The Shadow of the Sun by Ryszard Kapuściński\n\nIn this compelling collection of essays, a renowned journalist weaves together diverse stories and experiences from across Africa. The narrative delves deep into the continent’s complex socio-political landscape, capturing the essence of various African countries in moments of turmoil and transition.\n\n10. Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa by Dambisa Moyo\n\nThis influential book critiques the effectiveness of international aid to Africa, arguing that it has often hindered, rather than helped, the continent’s development and proposing alternative solutions for sustainable growth.\n\nI’ve read many great books on this subject—The White Man’s Burden and Poor Economics—but only this one is written from an African. For anyone traveling to Africa with a mind toward do-goodery and volunteering, read this book first.\n\n11. Cry Of The Kalahari by Mark and Delia Owens\n\nThis book about the African wilderness chronicles the incredible journey of two zoologists who spend seven years in Botswana’s Kalahari Desert, studying and living among its wildlife.\n\nThrough their eyes, travelers can experience the challenges and joys of field research, gain insights into animal behavior, and understand the importance of conservation efforts in preserving the unique ecosystems and majestic wildlife of the Kalahari.\n\nThis book recommendation is aimed at those with an eye toward better understanding the complex conservation challenges faced by this continent. But it’s hard to pick just one of the great conservation stories, so also consider Love, Life, and Elephants, The Elephant Whisperer, and The Last Rhinos.\n\n12. In Pursuit of Disobedient Women: A Memoir of Love, Rebellion, and Family, Far Away by Dionne Searcey\n\nSearcey’s memoir offers a vivid account of a journalist’s journey balancing her family life with her career in West Africa. She unflinchingly shares the challenges and triumphs of reporting in a region rife with conflict and change, while also exploring themes of love and rebellion.\n\nShe offers a compelling perspective on the diverse cultures and complex political landscapes of West Africa.\n\nBest Fiction Books About Africa\n\nReading fiction before traveling to Africa enriches the journey by offering a deeper emotional and cultural connection to the destination—and it can be a lot more fun in some ways to dive into a story.\n\nFictional narratives, rooted in local contexts and perspectives, can bring to life the nuances of African societies, traditions, and everyday experiences, allowing you to engage more empathetically and thoughtfully with the places and people they encounter.\n\n13. Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe\n\nThis influential African novel was required reading in my high school IB literature class and I found myself reading it again 15 years later while I backpacked across Africa. It offers a profound exploration of Nigerian life and culture at the cusp of colonial influence.\n\nSet in a traditional Igbo village, it portrays the clash between native traditions and the disruptive forces of British colonialism. Through the story of its protagonist and his community, the book vividly captures the cultural upheaval and personal tragedies brought about by this encounter, providing an essential perspective for travelers interested in understanding the historical and cultural dynamics of Nigeria and the wider African continent.\n\n14. The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver\n\nThis novel about Africa delves into the experiences of a missionary family in the Congo, intricately exploring the complexities of colonialism, faith, and cultural misunderstandings.\n\nIt unfolds through the varied perspectives of family members, each offering a unique lens on their life in Africa amidst political upheaval. The narrative vividly portrays the challenges of navigating a foreign culture and the profound impact of these experiences on each character.\n\n15. A Bend in the River by V.S. Naipaul\n\nSet in a newly independent, unnamed African country, this novel offers a gripping exploration of the complexities surrounding decolonization and cultural clashes.\n\nThrough the eyes of its protagonist, an Indian-African shopkeeper, it captures the turbulent changes and challenges that shape the nation and its people. The story provides an insightful look into the impact of political and social upheaval on individual lives.\n\n16. Too Late The Phalarope by Alan Paton\n\nThis novel offers an intimate and human perspective on the effects of South African Apartheid, weaving a story through multi-dimensional characters caught in the web of segregation and oppressive policies.\n\nSet against the backdrop of a society deeply divided by racial tensions, it explores the personal struggles and moral conflicts faced by individuals grappling with the harsh realities of their time.\n\n17. Stay with Me: A novel by Ayobami Adebayo\n\nThis novel spoke to me in the same way I found The Kite Runner a beautiful novel—it’s a story with emotional depth set against rich cultural context of a place and culture I know little about.\n\nIt delves into the life of a Nigerian couple struggling with societal and familial pressures in their marriage. Set against the backdrop of political turmoil in Nigeria, it offers an intimate exploration of love, betrayal, and the complexities of tradition in modern society.\n\n18. The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency by Alexander McCall Smith\n\nProbably the wackiest choice on this list, but this bestselling mystery series offers a fun way to learn about Africa. This delightful series follows the adventures of Mma Ramotswe, the country’s first female detective. It’s filled with humor, warmth, and insight into daily life in Botswana.\n\nThe characters are charming and the world is cozy. These stories encapsulates all of the warmth and joy I found in many small towns when I backpacked across Africa.\n\n19. Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\n\nIn this thought-provoking novel, the author weaves a tale that addresses the huge African diaspora travelers would have met over the years, making it a more intriguing read for travelers than her novel Half of a Yellow Sun, in my opinion.\n\nThe story follows a young Nigerian woman as she navigates life in both the United States and Nigeria, offering sharp insights into the complexities of identity, race, and belonging in a globalized world. The narrative skillfully juxtaposes her experiences across continents, providing a rich exploration of cultural differences and the multifaceted nature of the African immigrant experience.\n\n20. How Beautiful We Were by Imbolo Mbue\n\nThis poignant novel tells the story of a small African village’s struggle against an American oil company’s environmental devastation. It’s a tale of community, resistance, and the clash between tradition and modernity, offering an insightful look into the impacts of globalization and environmental negligence. Through the eyes of its characters, the book beautifully captures the spirit and resilience of a community fighting for justice.\n\nBonus: Books About Africa for Kids\n\nThere are a few books about Africa and African heroes that are so beautiful that they are enjoyable by adults and kids alike. I’ve always made a point to find kid-friendly stories about new places whenever I travel with kids.\n\nHere are a few books you should consider reading with your kids so they also learn something unique and interesting about this fascinating continent.\n\n21. Mama Miti by Donna Jo Napoli and Kadir Nelson\n\nThis enchanting kids book about Africa pays homage to Wangari Maathai, the Kenyan Nobel laureate and environmentalist, through a series of modern morality tales illustrated in vibrant detail.\n\nIt poetically narrates stories of women seeking help from Mama Miti for various environmental woes—from the lack of firewood to polluted water. Rather than relying on external aid, Mama Miti imparts wisdom about local flora with healing properties, demonstrating the power of nature to provide sustainable solutions.\n\nOther notable mentions of books kids:\n\nBringing the Rain to Kapiti Plain by Verna Aardema: A Kenyan folktale-inspired picture book that tells the story of how a herdsman helps bring rain to the drought-stricken Kapiti Plain.

For that reason, I’ve rounded up a number of guides to books about countries like Spain and Ireland, regions like Africa and Central America, and a fair number of individual travel book reviews."
