        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers are giving Metta World Peace another chance.\n\nThe veteran forward re-signed with Los Angeles on Thursday, agreeing to a one-year deal to resume his NBA career.\n\nHe won a championship ring with the Lakers in 2010 when he was still known as Ron Artest, starting all 23 postseason games in the highlight of his four-year tenure in Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough his play appeared to decline sharply before Los Angeles released him through the amnesty clause in July 2013, his steadfast friendship with Kobe Bryant and his ability to mentor the Lakers” talented young core apparently played roles in the club”s decision to bring back the 35-year-old former troublemaker.\n\nWorld Peace, who last played in the NBA with 2013-14 with the New York Knicks, has been working out at the Lakers” training complex this summer, and he caught the attention of the franchise”s top brass.\n\nBosh missed the final 30 games last season after a blood clot was diagnosed on his left lung.\n\nWNBA\n\nMaya Moore scored 19 points and Rebekkah Brunson had a franchise playoff-record 19 rebounds to lead the Minnesota Lynx to a 67-60 victory over the Phoenix Mercury in the opener of the Western Conference finals in Minneapolis.\n\nMiscellany\n\nThe group trying to bring the 2024 Olympics to Los Angeles has named Olympic swimming medalist Janet Evans its vice chair and director of athlete relations. Evans, a Southern California native, won a total of five Olympic medals in 1988 and 1992. She passed the torch to Muhammad Ali at the opening ceremony of the 1996 Atlanta Games."
