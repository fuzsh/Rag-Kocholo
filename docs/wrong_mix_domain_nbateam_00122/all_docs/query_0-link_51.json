        "text": "Tag Archives: metta world peace knicks\n\nMetta World Peace returns to NBA\n\nFormer Knick and former “Ron Artest” Metta World Peace has returned to the NBA, signing a 1-year deal with the LA Lakers. World Peace played in China after negotiating a buyout with the Knicks during the 2013-14 campaign. World Peace was once known for his tendency to make rash, violent decisions, but has cleaned up his act over the years. Check out The interview I did with Metta in February.\n\nInterview with Metta World Peace: Knicks Memes Exclusive\n\nOn Tuesday morning, I got a chance to interview Metta World Peace over the phone. Metta, an NBA All-Star, Champion, and Defensive Player of the Year, had some great (and funny!) things to say. We talked about Pandas, name changes, Melo, the Knicks, teeth, China, shoes, Kobe, acting, wrestling bears, and more! Sit back, go ahead and give it a read, and enjoy!\n\nContinue reading →\n\nDoes Metta Want Back In With Phil In Town?\n\nMetta World Peace, who played (or rather, rode Coach Woodson’s bench) for the Knicks earlier this season before asking for a buyout and being released, reportedly wants back in now that Phil Jackson is running the team. This story first caught some eyes when Metta told reporters he “absolutely” would NOT have accepted a buyout had he known that Jackson— with whom World Peace won a ring while playing for the Lakers— was coming on board. Today, CBS and the NY Post are reporting that sources close to Metta claim that he “abso-bleeping-lutely” wants another shot with the Knicks next season. Metta knows how to play defense, which means he could fill a need for this team. Jackson has specifically complained on the Knicks’ lack of perimeter defense and proper footwork. With Phil in and Mike Woodson almost certainly on the way out, this could be worth watching.\n\n-Tommy Rothman\n\nKnicks to Buy Out Metta World Peace After Veteran Asks for Release\n\nKnicks’ forward Metta World Peace has asked the team for a buyout that would make him a free agent. World Peace informed fans of his decision in a tweet, saying:\n\nThank NYC for everything. Thanks for having me I will always be grateful… My agent is working on a buyout. No disrespect to the city Luv U\n\nThe team plans to honor his Metta’s request. World Peace had been seeing very little playing time, and the team has not been successful at all, so this is not much of a surprise, although it is a bit disappointing. Oh well…\n\n-Tommy Rothman\n\nMetta World Peace Clearly Runs His Own Twitter\n\nAnd he doesn’t follow anybody, because Metta World Peace listens to no man."
