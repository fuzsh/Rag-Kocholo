        "text": "It all began when he met John Ealy, a promoter and manager for hip-hop artists known as “John Drama.” As someone who frequently held shows in the Detroit area, Ealy facilitated World Peace’s hope to visit what he called local “high-risk schools” since “they’re the ones that need help the most.” So Ealy set up World Peace with a visit last September at Osborn High, which resides in the so-called “Red Zone” because of the poverty and crime in the surrounding area. World Peace, who grew up in Queens, N.Y., remarked he had “never seen so many abandoned houses in my life.”\n\n“They’ll identify with that immediately if he tells his story. A lot of these kids are living his story,” Deadrick said. “I’m sure he’ll able to identify with them with what they’re going through, especially the guys on my basketball team. That’s who I really want him to speak to. It’s so hard to get some of them to understand and focus.” Meanwhile, World Peace is focused on ensuring his efforts to help Detroit continue after his NBA career. He plans to visit Osborn High again next fall. He hopes to schedule visits with local civic leaders about his mental health work, and is open to exploring other initiatives as well.\n\nWill that presence be enough for World Peace to stay on the roster? The Lakers must decide by Tuesday whether to retain him and make his one-year contract a guaranteed deal at the veteran’s minimum salary*. “I had no thought of that until you said something,” World Peace said. “I have no thoughts.”\n\nInstead of going to his hometown team, the Chicago Bulls selected him one pick later. World Peace reflected on what could’ve happened in New York if the Knicks drafted him. “Obviously I wanted to go to the Knicks, but St. Johns was the closest that I could get to bringing that fire back to New York City,” World Peace told Basketball Insiders. “As a kid, New York was in my blood, and that was it. I got a chance to play for the Knicks, so it was cool, but it was towards the end of my career. It wasn’t when I was the best defender and everything. But that was my goal, man: to bring a championship to New York City. It just didn’t work out that way.”"
