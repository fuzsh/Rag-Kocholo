        "text": "Six months after he played his final season with the Lakers, Metta World Peace on Monday signed on for a third stint with the organization. This time, he’ll be coaching.\n\nWorld Peace was hired as a player development assistant for the South Bay Lakers – formerly the L.A. D-Fenders – the franchise’s affiliate in the NBA’s Gatorade League, the team announced. He will work under Coby Karl, who is in his second season as the head coach of the South Bay Lakers.\n\nA fan favorite forward who resurrected his career and image by helping the Lakers win a championship in 2010, World Peace had long expressed an interest in coaching when his playing days ended.\n\nIn 2015, he told the Southern California News Group, “I want to coach one day.”\n\nA year ago, Dallas coach Rick Carlisle, who mentored World Peace in Indiana, said World Peace would periodically reach out with questions about coaching.\n\n“He’s got a chance to be a good coach,” Carlisle said.\n\nThe former Ron Artest originally signed with the Lakers in 2009, famously telling Kobe Bryant after the Lakers lost in the 2008 Finals to the Celtics, “I’m coming. We’re going to get Boston.”\n\nWhen the teams met in the 2010 Finals, it was World Peace who hit the game-sealing 3-point basket to win Game 7.\n\nAs his career wound to a close, however, World Peace was already transitioning into more of a coaching role. After a failed 29-game stint with the New York Knicks in 2013-14, World Peace was out of the league until the summer of 2015, when the Lakers extended a training camp invitation.\n\nHe surprised the organization by earning a spot on the regular-season roster and averaged 16.9 minutes in 35 games. The next summer they invited him back again. Once again, he made the team, spending most of the season mentoring players like Julius Randle.\n\nHe appeared in just 25 games in his final season. At the end of the year, however, the team was beset by injuries. His final appearance at Staples Center came on April 11 against the New Orleans Pelicans. World Peace played 25 minutes and scored a season-high 18 points."
