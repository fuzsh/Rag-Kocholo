        "text": "First, for all unacquainted with the meaning of “Metta,” it is a Buddhist term that translates as loving kindness and friendliness towards others.\n\nThe former Ron Artest, who played basketball for St. John’s University until he opted to go professional after his sophomore season, legally changed his name to Metta World Peace in September, 2011.\n\nWorld Peace is one of the Knicks free agent signings during the offseason. Besides World Peace, the Knicks free-agent signings included, re-signing guards J.R. Smith and Pablo Prigioni and inking, 35-year old forward Kenyon Martin to a deal to play his 14th season in the NBA. Martin came out of retirement last February to join the Knicks for their push to the playoffs.\n\nWorld Peace, as his name indicates, has come along way since his troubled times that were captioned by a brawl at the Palace in Auburn Hills in 2004, when he charged the stands as a member of the Indiana Pacers, in what is known as the worst brawl in NBA history.\n\nWorld Peace was introduced to the New York media at the Knicks Annual Media Day and the Opening of Knicks Training Camp, in Greenburgh, on Monday, Sept.30.\n\nWorld Peace known for his amusing character as well as his past negative incidents did not disappoint the media. He walked in and grabbed the microphone from a Knicks media member and began to interview the press.\n\nNew York Daily News beat writer Frank Isola seemed shocked but humored when World Peace asked him a question and put the microphone to his mouth for an answer.\n\nBut it was all in good fun and in my opinion prompted by World Peace being ecstatic to be back at home in New York and playing for the team he grew up rooting for as a youngster in Queens. “I am most excited to play on this team with these players, as I have played with many of them before,” commented World Peace. “It is not so much about the New York Knicks, as it is about playing with these players and bringing our energy together and doing it as one,” stated World Peace.\n\nWorld Peace comes to the Knicks after playing four seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers, where he was a key figure in the Lakers winning the 2010 NBA Championship.\n\nWorld Peace, as well as being good at amusing the New York media, can also be an influential player on the court for the Knicks, even considering that it is his 15th season in the NBA. World Peace is New York basketball-tough and exhibits the exact type of skills conducive to the playing style warranted by Knicks Head Coach Mike Woodson.\n\nWorld Peace is a two-time All-NBA Defensive First Team selection (2004 and 2006) and two-time Second Team selection (2003 and 2009). He attacks the defensive boards, while averaging 3.6 defensive rebounds last season during his 14th year in the NBA.\n\nWorld Peace also maintained a 40 percent field goal percentage last season. He also moves well without the ball, which will be helpful to point guard Raymond Felton, center Tyson Chandler and superstar forward Carmelo Anthony. World Peace also logged over 33 minutes a game last season for the Lakers, so he can still run the floor.\n\nBut as World Peace will hopefully evolve into an impact player for the Knicks this season, probably their best pick-up in the offseason came in a sign-and-trade deal with the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe Knicks traded Marcus Camby, Steve Novak and Quentin Richardson to the Raptors for seven-foot forward/center Andrea Bargnani, who was the first overall pick in the 2006 NBA Draft.\n\nBargnani, a native of Italy is the first European selected number one in the NBA Draft. The seven-foot forward/center has a balanced offensive game from the inside and outside, which would be a blessing to front-court mate Chandler who likes to hone his defensively skills on the court.\n\nKnicks Head Coach Woodson evaluated Bargnani. “Bringing in Bargnani kind of opens things up a little more because he is a talented offensive player,” stated Woodson. “He is a talented seven-footer who can do a lot of things. He can pass, shoot and post-up, so from that standpoint he gives us another real nice offensive weapon,” Woodson said.\n\nThe only possible drawback to the Bargnani trade could be his health. He missed 45 games last season due to injury including a torn ligament in his elbow, wrist strain and right elbow strain. This included him missing the last 19 games of last season with the elbow strain.\n\nNonetheless, after seven seasons with the Raptors, Bargnani does rank third on their all-time scoring list. He also scored in double digits 11 times, in the 35 games he participated in during his injury plagued season last year.\n\nKnicks Head Coach Mike Woodson gets another year after this year to prove that he can bring an NBA Championship to New York. The Knicks picked-up Woodson’s contract option for the 2014-15 season. It is a well deserved extension as Woodson led the Knicks to a 54-28 record last season and their first Atlantic Division Title since 1993-94.\n\nNow let’s see if Woodson can lead the 2013-14 Knicks to their first NBA Championship since 1972-73. Better keep in mind that it is Carmelo Anthony’s last year on his contract with the Knicks."
