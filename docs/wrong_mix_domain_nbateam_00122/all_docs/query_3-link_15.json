        "text": "A Knicks Bucket List for Metta World Peace\n\nAP Photo/Chris Carlson\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nThe Knicks are the greatest. You know this. Did you see they signed J.R. Smith to a four-year deal last week, then found out that he’s got ligament damage and is out for the next four months? Every time you think the Knicks have out-Knicksed themselves with something like the Andrea Bargnani trade, they go out and up the ante.\n\nAnd, hey, good news! The most surreal team in the NBA just signed the most surreal player in the NBA, and now Metta World Peace is going to be in New York City. Putting Metta anywhere in America would be fun — Utah! — but in New York City, the possibilities are truly endless. To help start the brainstorming process, we came up with handful of ideas for Mr. World Peace during the next two years.\n\nMetta, if you’re reading, just know that we’re dead serious about all this.\n\nWe believe in you.\n\nOK, a quick checklist for the next 24 months …\n\nTake Andrea Bargnani to Queensbridge, steal his wallet, leave him there.\n\nBreak another camera after the first preseason game.\n\nI don’t care how or when, but add your name to at least one Dorrian’s guest list.\n\nPlay the blues with James Dolan.\n\nHire three friends from Queensbridge to hang out at the Cablevision offices and curse out Dolan every single day.\n\n“After a brief conversation with the police, World Peace put on his Cookie Monster pajamas and accompanied them outside.” Bring back those pajamas.\n\nGive Frank Isola an atomic wedgie at media day.\n\nStart a Broadway production company with Tyson Chandler.\n\nTake a month off midseason to star in the Broadway rendition of Spider-Man.\n\nLecture Carmelo Anthony during every timeout about how he’s not really from New York.\n\nFind those dudes from How to Make It in America and finally launch that clothing line.\n\nMistake LaLa for Rosario Dawson for the entire season.\n\nOrganize hangouts with Andray Blatche every weekend. Never show up.\n\nWrite a novella with Woody Allen.\n\nBuy courtside season tickets for Fat Joe, make him the new Spike Lee.\n\nConvince the Knicks to sign Lavor Postell and Bootsy Thornton, because those St. John’s teams were awesome.\n\nBecome best friends with Pablo Prigioni, force him to get this as a tattoo.\n\nRecord another rap album.\n\nMake it a Watch the Throne–type thing with Anna Wintour.\n\nFind Redman, get an apartment together in Staten Island.\n\nChinese New Year’s parties with Metta World Peace and Redman.\n\nPlay point guard. Fuck it.\n\nCameo on Girls. Jessa’s got a new NBA friend.\n\nWeekly podcasts with J.R. Smith. Obviously.\n\nCreate a fake persona as a 23-year-old white girl, Snapchat politicians every day until you’ve got incriminating photos of everyone at City Hall.\n\nGet elected mayor of New York City.\n\nGO KNICKS.\n\nFiled Under: Amare Stoudemire, Andrew Sharp, New York Knicks\n\nAndrew Sharp is a staff editor at Grantland.\n\nArchive @ andrewsharp\n\nMore From Andrew Sharp\n\nMore Amare Stoudemire\n\nMore The Triangle\n\nMore from Andrew Sharp\n\nNBA Stock Watch: Buy the Bulls, Sell Van Gundy, and Other Bits of Investment Advice\n\nThe Two Ways to Watch the Heat This Season\n\nDear Scott Skiles: Please Just Put Mario Hezonja on the Court\n\nThe Warriors Are Angry; Long Live the Angry Warriors\n\nIt’s Otto Porter Season in Washington, D.C.\n\nSee all from Andrew Sharp\n\nMore Amare Stoudemire\n\nThe Two Ways to Watch the Heat This Season\n\nI Heart Amar’e: Making Sense of Stoudemire’s Five Seasons in New York\n\nA Third-Rate Babylon: The Knicks’ Potential Problems This Year and Beyond\n\nA Knicks Bucket List for Metta World Peace\n\nDowntown Downpour: The New York Knicks Are Raining 3’s\n\nSee all Amare Stoudemire\n\nMore The Triangle\n\nWe Went There: Clippers-Mavs and DeAndre Jordan Night in Los Angeles\n\nNo Messi, No Problem: Neymar Becomes a Superstar\n\nWorld Series Weekend: Five Questions for Three (or Two) Royals-Mets Games\n\nNBA Overnight: Where Was the Spark?\n\nNHL Grab Bag: Let’s Get Spooky\n\nSee all The Triangle"
