        "text": "Every fiber in his 19-year-old body told him to be cautious. Walk softly. Talk softer, because that wasn’t just any old player sitting in the corner of the locker room. It was Metta World Peace, aka Ron Artest, the temperamental and wacky small forward who had rejoined the Lakers right before the season.\n\nD’Angelo Russell took care and approached World Peace with equal parts respect and trepidation. What the Lakers rookie point guard found out surprised him.\n\n“I didn’t think he would be that nice of a guy,” Russell said. “But he’s one of the nicest guys I’ve ever met.”\n\nThe pride of Queensbridge seemingly has all but put aside his anger and ghetto image, tucked it away in favor of a kinder, gentler World Peace. These days World Peace spends most of his time as a mentor, not menace. He has taken the young Lakers under his wing, dispensing advice and tips, showing them moves and teaching them what to expect in the NBA.\n\nWorld Peace paused when asked whether he ever imagined himself in this role then said thoughtfully, “Yeah, because every team I played on I was like a leader on the team. Sometimes I was a little dysfunctional, but I still led by example on the court.\n\n“I always played the role of showing the young guys what to do. Be aggressive, be tough, focus all that kind of stuff.”\n\nAsk any of the young players on the Lakers and they all say World Peace has been somewhat of a big brother to them. No one is afraid to ask for advice. Not any more.\n\n“He’s one of the main catalysts for the team and he’s (already) done everything we want to do and he can give us the blueprint on how to do it,” backup center Tarik Black said.\n\n“We talk all the time. I’m never scared to run away from knowledge and wisdom. That’s not me.”\n\nWorld Peace, 36, has seen pretty much it all in his 16 years, from championship parades to disappointing seasons, from suspensions and trades to a second stint with the Lakers.\n\nBut this season almost didn’t happen.\n\nAfter the 2013-14 season, the Lakers used their amnesty clause to release World Peace, and he signed with the New York Knicks. Midway through the season, the Knicks bought out his contract and no other team picked him up.\n\nWorld Peace looked east and played last season in China under the name “The Panda’s Friend.” He wasn’t satisfied, though, the chance to prove to himself, and others, he could still play in the NBA gnawed at him like a persistent hunger pang.\n\nSo he had his representative reach out to the Lakers, and General Manager Mitch Kupchak listened. The Lakers signed World Peace to a one-year, non-guaranteed deal for the veteran’s minimum. The Lakers decided to let last week’s contract deadline pass, guaranteeing World Peace would be with the team through the end of the season.\n\n“My thing is this,” he said, “one day I want the opportunity to win another championship.”\n\nFor the most part, the Lakers brought World Peace in to be a teacher, someone to help bridge the team from the past (Kobe Bryant) to the future (Russell), someone with a guiding hand but who also still has a few moves. A player with a positive attitude, but who isn’t afraid to speak his mind.\n\nWith two decades of experience, a fighting spirit and 6-foot-6 mass of muscle that puts many younger players to shame, World Peace was that player.\n\n“He brings an edge to our team,” second-year guard Jordan Clarkson said. “It’s good to have him around. He always keeps us up, keeps us wanting to come in to work.”\n\nKupchak said before re-signing World Peace that he thought the veteran “would be great in the locker room with the young players.”\n\nThe young players, perhaps wary at first, now love having World Peace in the locker room, especially for moral support as they trudge through what could be the worst season in franchise history.\n\n“He’s done a great job of telling you to stay positive, be positive, no matter what it is,” Russell said. “That’s something I try to work on.”\n\nBlack said World Peace tries to pump up the players after losses, injecting his positive outlook into dejected psyches.\n\n“We can be down by 40 and he be going to everybody, telling them you do this and you’ll get 15 (points) and five (rebounds),” Black said. “He told someone, ‘Play hard, just come back and we can win this game. Don’t give up, don’t back down. Finish the game.’\n\n“Metta hasn’t stopped believing.”\n\nAnd that goes for his ability to compete. World Peace might have lost a step but not his will to compete. His doggedness to prove himself one more time was all he wanted when he put back on No. 37.\n\nHe got that opportunity early in the season when he averaged 16.2 minutes mostly off the bench in a stretch of 16 games. In all of the 18 games he’s played so far, he has been a stalwart on defense.\n\n“When I played this year, I proved to myself I can still compete at this level,” World Peace said.\n\nWorld Peace said he ideally would like to play in the NBA another two years, but if that doesn’t happen, he’s given it his best shot.\n\n“I’m not trying to control what I can’t control,” he said. “You know that doesn’t make sense. It’s like try to spin the Earth in the other direction. Go for it, see if you if can do it. But in the end, you can’t control what you can’t control. You move accordingly.”"
