        "text": "Get ready for more fashion forward basketball in New York next season. According to a Yahoo! Sports report, the New York Knicks have come to an agreement to bring aboard Free Agent forward Metta World Peace. The deal is reportedly for 2 years and will bring the Queensbridge product home after \"The Artest formerly known as Ron\" was released from his contract by the LA Lakers this past weekend.\n\nRumors began last week that the Lakers might release the former All Star, and the story picked up steam when his father, Ron Artest Sr., told the Post that his son wanted to finish his career with the Knicks. By rule in the NBA's new collective bargaining agreement, World Peace was available for any team to claim via waivers, but may have postured his way into his long awaited homecoming by expressing interest in playing overseas in China, playing professional hockey, or staying put in LA and playing for the Clippers.\n\nWorld Peace's odyssey home is a well-known tale in basketball circles. After making a name for himself in college at St. John's, Ron Artest (as he was known at the time) was passed on by the Knicks during the 1999 NBA draft for French uberbust Frederic Weis and wound up with the Chicago Bulls. After 14 years of All Star appearances, accolades, brawls with fans, and famously thanking his psychiatrist following the Lakers' 2010 NBA championship, World Peace's long journey to New York City has finally come to an end. If everything goes according to plan, he will be expressing his gratitude to a subway busker on his way to a championship parade next summer with the Knicks."
