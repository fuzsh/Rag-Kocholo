        "text": "The basketball player formerly known as Ron Artest might only be 33-years-old, but could senility already be creeping in?\n\nFollowing the New York Knicks’ 103-102 victory over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday, Metta World Peace went off on a number of topics, (watch video above) including his fading memory.\n\n“It’s just hard to say. Honestly I forget stuff so fast,” the Knicks forward said.” Like today I asked the big fella, ‘When we go to Toronto, who do we play?’ He laughed at me. It’s more about the long haul for me. Very rarely will I have comments on a game. I’m hoping I can be there in June. The biggest comments I can give would be in June. Right now my comments don’t really mean anything.”\n\nAs a new member of the Knicks World Peace may want to refresh his memory on the name of Toronto’s NBA team. Especially given that one of his teammates, Andrea Bargnani, came over to the Knicks in a trade with Raptors, and also because New York will play Toronto four times this season, including a home-and-home on Dec. 27 and 28."
