        "text": "The former Lakers forward officially announced a deal with the Knicks.\n\nIn the aftermath of Metta World Peace being let go from the Lakers last Thursday, rumors of his next move circulated like wildfire. Talks of joining the Clippers, a possible move to China, and an alleged retirement were among the most popular stories under speculation, but as the saying goes, home is where the heart is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter initially denying reports that he’d enlisted as a Knickerbocker, the recently amnestied forward has officially announced that he’s signed a two-year deal with the New York Knicks. The man formerly known as Ron Artest made the announcement on MSG during his new team’s summer league game against the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\n“I want to win in New York,” the Queensbridge-native declared on the broadcast.\n\nThe terms of the 33-year-old’s deal with the Knicks have yet to be released.\n\nMetta averaged 12.4 points and 5.0 rebounds this past season, which was his best in either category since 2009-2010 season. Hopefully he’ll surpass those metrics next season when he’s back home.\n\nLooks like Metta World Peace will fit right in with this Knicks/Nets rivalry."
