Make it official: World Peace is headed to New York.

The Knicks announced Tuesday that forward Metta World Peace has signed his contract with the team.

“Metta is a fierce competitor who brings toughness and championship experience to our roster,” general manager Glen Grunwald said in a release. “We are excited to bring him back to New York and give him a chance to play for the team he grew up rooting for.”

After being waived by the Lakers via the amnesty provision, World Peace cleared waivers and became a free agent. He was said to have mutual interest with the Clippers, the Thunder and a few others, along with the option to play overseas or even join arena football.

He ended up choosing the Knicks, mostly because he couldn't turn down the opportunity to return home.

Born in Queens, NY, as Ron Artest, World Peace starred at La Salle Academy and then at St. John’s University.

World Peace, 33, averaged 12.4 points, 5.0 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 1.63 steals over 75 games (66 starts) with the Lakers last season.
