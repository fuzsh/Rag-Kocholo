Metta World Peace played for the Knicks last season, or at least for a portion of it.

New York waived him in February, and while there were reports that the team may give him an invite to training camp given his ties to Phil Jackson, there apparently isn’t enough legitimate interest from teams to guarantee him a spot on an NBA roster next season.

World Peace has made it clear that he isn’t retiring, however, and playing overseas has emerged as a very real option.

From Ian Begley of ESPN New York:

World Peace still has the passion to play, as evidenced by his recent physical confrontation at a recreational league game in Venice. But if he can’t convince NBA teams that he still has something left, there’s money to be made elsewhere.

Another former Knicks player, Stephon Marbury, has had great success playing in in China since 2010, to the point where his team erected a statue of him in front of the arena.

It’s a long shot that World Peace could similarly impact his Chinese team’s fortunes, but it appears as though he’s at least considering the possibility of giving it a shot.
