Free agent forward Metta World Peace has come to terms on a two-year agreement with the New York Knicks, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo Sports.

The New York native had also reportedly been considering a move to China as well as an offer to join the Los Angeles Clippers.

Despite a resurgence in productivity last season, the Los Angeles Lakers used the amnesty clause to cut World Peace last Friday.

He averaged 12.4 points and 5.0 rebounds in 75 games last season, having joined the Lakers in 2009. The 33-year-old tore knee cartilage in March and clearly wasn’t the same player afterward. He didn’t play in the last game of San Antonio’s four-game sweep of the Lakers in the first round.

The former Ron Artest legally changed his name during his tenure with the team. One of the highlights of his time with the Lakers was his clutch play in Game 7 of the 2010 NBA Finals, which helped them beat Boston for the franchise’s 16th championship.

A 14-year veteran, World Peace has also played for Houston, Sacramento, Indiana and Chicago during his career.
