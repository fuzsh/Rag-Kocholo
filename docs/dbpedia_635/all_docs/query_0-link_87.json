        "text": "The Whisperers\n\nJanuary 14th, 2020\n\nKino Lorber, B&W, 1967, 106 Minutes 1.66:1, Region A\n\nFrom Bryan Forbes, the legendary writer/director of Séance on a Wet Afternoon, The Wrong Box, The Stepford Wives and The Naked Face comes this gripping classic about an elderly woman who becomes increasingly ensnared by her own world of delusion and exploited by the very real world of morally corrupt people. Three-time Oscar nominee Dame Edith Evans received her final Oscar nomination (Best Actress in a Leading Role) for her performance as the eccentric Mrs. Ross, living alone in a meager apartment and hearing “whisperers” that plot against her. The whispering voices are right—but will anyone believe her? Gerry Turpin’s (Morgan: A Suitable Case of Treatment) stunning photography and John Barry’s (The Lion in Winter) haunting score are two of this powerful psychological drama’s best features.\n\nBrand New 2K Master\n\nNEW Audio Commentary by Film Historian Kat Ellinger\n\nOptional English Subtitles\n\nDual-Layered BD50 Disc\n\nTrailers\n\nSeance on a Wet Afternoon\n\nJanuary 13th, 2020\n\nNetwork,1080p, 1.66:1, Mono / English, Subtitles English, Region B, 116 mins\n\nKim Stanley and Richard Attenborough give outstanding performances in this classy British thriller, with Attenborough winning a BAFTA for Best British Actor and Stanley scoring an Oscar nomination. Written and directed by Bryan Forbes - who also won a Writers Guild award, an Edgar and a BAFTA nomination - Seance on a Wet Afternoon is presented here as a brand-new High Definition transfer from original film elements in its original theatrical aspect ratio.\n\nMyra Savage, a highly-strung spiritual medium, convinces her weak-willed husband to fake a child kidnapping so she can offer her services to the parents when all seems lost. Though horrified at the prospect, he reluctantly goes along with the plan - but becomes more convinced than ever that Myra is losing her grip on reality...\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\n\nMemories on a Wet Afternoon – an interview with Bryan Forbes\n\naudio commentary with Bryan Forbes\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nImage gallery\n\nInside Moves\n\nDecember 10, 2019.\n\nScorpion Releasing, 1980, 113 min., Region A.\n\nScorpion Releasing: Restored Inside Moves Detailed for Blu-ray\n\nPosted September 27, 2019 04:40 PM by\n\nScorpion ReleasingScorpion Releasing has detailed its upcoming Blu-ray release of Richard Donner's film Inside Moves (1980), starring John Savage, David Morse, Diana Scarwid, Amy Wright, and Tony Burton. The release, which will be distributed by Kino Lorber, will be available for purchase on December 10.\n\nSynopsis: This poignant and offbeat dramedy follows Roary, a man who's been crippled by a recent suicide attempt. After resigning to spending most of his time in a bar full of down-trodden souls, Roary discovers that Jerry the Bartender has just been accepted to play basketball for the Golden State Warriors. As it turns out, helping Jerry train might just be the sort of transcendent therapy Roary and his fellow patrons need.\n\nSpecial Features and Technical Specs:\n\nBRAND NEW AND EXCLUSIVE REMASTER OF THE FILM\n\nNEW On-camera Interview with Director Richard Donner\n\nNEW On-camera Interview with Star John Savage\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\nOptional English SDH subtitles for the main feature\n\nMore information on blu-ray.com\n\nFollow Me! (The Public Eye) on DVD (Region B) and blu-ray\n\n19th August, 2019\n\nExtra: John Barry's complete score, taken from the master tapes.\n\nFrom the Network website:\n\nIf there’s one thing we love to do at Network it's to take series and films that were roundly ignored (or pilloried) on their original release and make them available to appreciative new viewers – and you'll probably never find a better example of an overlooked gem than Follow Me. Even director Carol Reed's biography makes scant mention of this, his directorial swansong.\n\nHollywood ingénue Mia Farrow and stalwart character actor Michael Jayston star as a married couple in crisis – suspecting his wife of infidelity, the husband hires a private detective (Topol, then at the height of his Fiddler on the Roof fame) to follow her, only to set into motion an elaborate game of cat and mouse. Adapted from the popular play The Public Eye, by award-winning writer Peter Shaffer, Follow Me showcases its dazzling London locations to memorable effect, set to a haunting score by legendary composer John Barry.\n\nWith all these elements in play, Follow Me seemed assured of success, and yet it inexplicably underperformed on release. Disappearing into oblivion, it’s now fondly remembered as a much sought-after film, barely glimpsed on television and virtually unobtainable on home media.\n\nNow, with everyone here at Network falling for its gentle-but-infectious humour, we’re setting the record straight and are proud to reintroduce Follow Me to viewers with this release – presented in its original Panavision widescreen aspect ratio from High Definition materials supplied by Universal.

Sissy Goforth (Taylor), the world's richest woman, has retired to her lavish island estate to dictate her memoirs. Her reclusive lifestyle is thrown into upheaval when roguish poet Chris Flanders (Burton) washes up on her beach. With the mysterious habit of calling upon a lady one step before the undertaker, Flanders has become known as \"The Angel Of Death\" — but an undaunted Goforth opts to tempt fate when she chooses to take Flanders as her next — and last — lover.\n\nA notorious bomb on its initial release, Boom! has since built up a cult following for its one-of-a-kind mixture of camp, lyricism, and the highly combustible chemistry of its two leads. More than fifty years after Boom!'s debut, Shout! Factory invites you to light the fuse on a re-examination of this highly unusual drama.\n\nBonus Features\n\nNEW Audio Commentary With Filmmaker John Waters\n\nNEW \"The Sound Of A Bomb: Contextualizing Boom!\" With Film Critic/Author Alonso Duralde\n\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\n\nVintage Photo Galleries\n\nProduct Information\n\nHoward The Duck\n\n22 Apr 2019\n\nBritish label 101 Films Collector's Edition.\n\nhttps://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=24738\n\nSynopsis: From executive producer George Lucas and the pages of Marvel Comics comes a comedy adventure spectacular about a fast-talking, cigar-chomping, beer-loving duck from a parallel universe who crashes to Earth and somehow winds up in Cleveland.

(The Public Eye) DVD (Region B) and blu-ray\n\n19th August, 2019\n\nExtra: John Barry's complete score, taken from the master tapes.\n\nFrom the Network website:\n\nIf there’s one thing we love to do at Network it's to take series and films that were roundly ignored (or pilloried) on their original release and make them available to appreciative new viewers – and you'll probably never find a better example of an overlooked gem than Follow Me. Even director Carol Reed's biography makes scant mention of this, his directorial swansong.\n\nHollywood ingénue Mia Farrow and stalwart character actor Michael Jayston star as a married couple in crisis – suspecting his wife of infidelity, the husband hires a private detective (Topol, then at the height of his Fiddler on the Roof fame) to follow her, only to set into motion an elaborate game of cat and mouse. Adapted from the popular play The Public Eye, by award-winning writer Peter Shaffer, Follow Me showcases its dazzling London locations to memorable effect, set to a haunting score by legendary composer John Barry.\n\nWith all these elements in play, Follow Me seemed assured of success, and yet it inexplicably underperformed on release. Disappearing into oblivion, it’s now fondly remembered as a much sought-after film, barely glimpsed on television and virtually unobtainable on home media.\n\nNow, with everyone here at Network falling for its gentle-but-infectious humour, we’re setting the record straight and are proud to reintroduce Follow Me to viewers with this release – presented in its original Panavision widescreen aspect ratio from High Definition materials supplied by Universal. It includes a limited edition booklet by John Barry expert Geoff Leonard and Professor Laura Mayne and – in a world first – John Barry's original score as an isolated music track. Previously only available commercially as a re-recording – and edited down in the film itself – this will be the first time that Barry's original, full-length cues have been heard anywhere outside Universal's editing room in 1971.\n\nPart whimsical romantic comedy, part dreamy London time capsule, this beguiling film deserves the wider audience that eluded it originally in theatres – it’s long past time for it to finally have its day in the sun.\n\nAvailable to pre-order now Blu-ray or DVD\n\nIt's All Happening\n\nRegion 2 PAL, 97 mins, 1.66:1, Colour, Mono English, Subtitles English.\n\nTheatrical trailer\n\nImage gallery\n\nPDF material\n\nShortly before he left EMI for Ember, John Barry appeared as himself in It's All Happening.

You can order it from amazon.com, as did Peter Walker:\n\nHowever, a warning. The quality is not brilliant. Well, to be honest, it's appalling. Looks like it was made from a video recorded from a TV screening or similar. How do these companies get away with stuff like that?\n\nNo, buy the video instead which is probably still available. You can make your own DVD from that, with the right equipment!"
