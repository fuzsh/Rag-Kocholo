        "text": "SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Bryn Forbes, an NBA free agent who has played for four teams over seven seasons, was arrested early Wednesday on a family violence charge in San Antonio, police records show.\n\nForbes, who was released last week by the Minnesota Timberwolves, was arrested on suspicion of assault with bodily injury, a misdemeanor, after a verbal argument with a female companion turned physical, according to police records.\n\nForbes was arrested at 5 a.m. Wednesday at a residence in north-central San Antonio. He was taken to the Bexar County Jail, where bail had not been set.\n\nJail records don’t list a lawyer who can speak on Forbes’ behalf.\n\nAccording to a police report, Forbes had an argument with a woman he is dating. Forbes struck the woman several times after the couple arrived home, according to the report. The San Antonio Fire Department and Emergency Medical Services responded to assist the woman.\n\nThe case remains under investigation.\n\nForbes, a 29-year-old father of two, played seven seasons in the NBA after going undrafted in 2016. He played at Cleveland State and Michigan State before the NBA.\n\nForbes signed as a free agent and played his first four seasons with the San Antonio Spurs. He joined the Milwaukee Bucks as a free agent in 2021 but returned to the Spurs the following season before being traded to the Denver Nuggets midway through that season.\n\nForbes signed with Minnesota in July, but the Timberwolves waived him last week to clear a roster spot after acquiring Mike Conley Jr. and Nickeil Alexander-Walker in a trade that sent D’Angelo Russell to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nCopyright © The Associated Press.
