        "text": "You’re a writer. You’re probably a sh*t hot one, too.\n\nBUT IT DOESN’T MAKE YOU A COPYWRITER.\n\nSure – no doubt about it – natural writing skills are a big part of making it as a successful copywriter.\n\nHowever, copywriting is as much about science as it is about art.\n\nYou need to learn proven formulas that compel, convince, and convert customers.\n\nYou have to know how to use psychological techniques to dig deep into your audience’s desires.\n\nAnd you need to discover how to perfectly blend these techniques with your natural writing skills.\n\nThe problem is, the world of copywriting can be a complex and murky one if you haven’t a clue where to start.\n\nLuckily, there are a whole host of online copywriting courses that will help you learn the tricks of the trade, learn the ins and outs of running a copywriting business, and build a winning copywriter portfolio along the way.\n\nBut first…\n\nWHY DO YOU NEED A COPYWRITING COURSE?\n\nThe internet is swamped with information on copywriting.\n\nBut it’s in bits and pieces. A blog post here, a follow-up blog post there, and some AI-written nonsense in between.\n\nWith information dotted around like that, it’s nearly impossible to know whether you’re covering everything.\n\nAnd even if you do manage to spend a ton of time combing the internet for actual valuable articles with actual accurate information, you most likely still won’t come away with the full picture.\n\nTo give you the best chance of success, you need to find a value-packed copywriting course that’s geared towards getting you up and running.\n\nHere’s why you need a course:\n\nCopywriting goes hand in hand with marketing. This means you need to have a thorough understanding of marketing and how it applies to copywriting.\n\nCopywriting is a BIG area. And the techniques that apply will vary depending on the purpose of the copy you’re writing. A copywriting course will delve deep into the techniques so you can be sure you’re using them correctly for the copy you’re creating.\n\nYou need to trust the educational material. Anyone can knock up a blog post about copywriting, but with a copywriting course, you can suss out their credentials and accreditations so you can feel confident about the source you’re learning from.\n\nBUT WHAT ABOUT AI IN COPYWRITING?\n\nGood question!\n\nAI is more and more becoming a part of people’s daily lives, and copywriting is no different.\n\nBut the smart copywriters out there are using AI as a tool to improve their processes, not getting AI to write their copy for them. And because of this, the best copywriting courses out there will encourage you to embrace AI, not be afraid of it.\n\nSO, WHERE TO START?\n\nLucky for you, you’ve come to the right place. We’ve pulled together a list of the best copywriting courses out there, so you can make an informed decision and kick-start your copywriting career as soon as possible.\n\nReady?\n\nHERE ARE THE 11 BEST COPYWRITING COURSES OUT THERE IN 2024\n\n1. ‘SUCCESS WORKS’ COPYWRITING COURSE\n\nAre you looking to focus on B2B and SEO content? If so, then Success Works could be the course for you.

It’s run by Heather Lloyd-Martin, who is hailed by Forbes as ‘the pioneer of SEO copywriting’.\n\nThe Promise: This course will help you take command of all things SEO copywriting. You’ll learn to optimise pages the correct way, write high-positioning copy and improve search visibility.\n\nThe Length: A manageable 3 months.\n\nThe Location: Wherever you may be – it’s completely online.\n\nThe Qualification: SEO Copywriting Certification Program.\n\nThe Cost: $995.\n\nPros:\n\nIt’s founded by an SEO expert\n\nYou can complete it online, so it’s super flexible\n\nYou will learn all things SEO and writing for web\n\nCons:\n\nYou will only learn about SEO-geared copywriting. Areas like branding and marketing won’t be covered (and they’re pretty important!)\n\nIt’s costly – almost a grand for 3 months is a hefty sum\n\n2. THE CREATIVE COPYWRITER ACADEMY\n\nWe couldn’t let this post slide without giving our very own TCC Academy a mention. We’ve spent years honing our copywriting knowledge, so we thought it would be rude not to share it with the world.\n\nThe Promise: The Copywriting Kickstarter Course takes budding copywriters through the whole ‘getting started’ journey. No more combing the internet for ‘how-to’ blog posts, you will have everything you need by the end of the course. From marketing fundamentals to advanced copywriting techniques, to bookkeeping and invoicing to winning gigs, you’ll be ready to take your freelance copywriting business into the world.\n\nThe Length: It’s self-paced learning, so we’ll leave that up to you.\n\nThe Location: Wherever you reside in the world.\n\nThe Qualification: You’ll come away with a certificate of graduation.\n\nThe Cost: $290\n\nThe Pros:\n\nYou’ll truly learn everything you need to know about freelance copywriting from the ground up\n\nIt’s great value for money and you could see the ROI come in with your first copywriting gig\n\nIt’s self-paced and flexible, so no need to rush the course\n\nYou get real-time feedback from our in-house copywriting experts, as well as bi-monthly ‘office hour’ sessions where anyone can grill our copywriters on anything to do with copy\n\nYou get free access to a community of like-minded budding copywriters, where you can share experiences, get a ton of extra valuable content, and get feedback from the copywriting pros\n\nWhile you’re encouraged to embrace AI, you’re also recommended to learn the basics before diving into all things ChatGPT\n\nThe Cons:\n\nThose who want to always adhere to deadlines might prefer a course with stricter rules in place\n\n3. IDM (INSTITUTE OF DIGITAL MARKETING)\n\nThe ‘IDM Award in Digital Copywriting’ is an in-depth delve into the psychology of copywriting for web. It looks at how writers can use emotional drivers to motivate people and how to master the art of persuasion across all channels.\n\nAs one of the premier marketing institutes in the UK, this course has access to the most experienced tutors in the business, and the prestigious IDM stamp of approval.\n\nThe Promise: By the end of the course you’ll understand and apply the advanced techniques and drivers that help you plan, write, and review copy that really engages, persuades, and sells – whatever the medium.\n\nThe Length: A two-day, face-to-face session that’s jam-packed to say the least.\n\nThe Location: Central London and Edinburgh.\n\nThe Qualification: You come away with 7 CPD (Continuing Professional Development) hours.

It’s tricky (impossible) to learn everything you need to know in that amount of time\n\n4. CIM COPYWRITING COURSE\n\nCIM (The Chartered Institute of Marketing) is one of the most reputable marketing bodies in the UK, and they offer a Copywriting Masterclass. It covers a wide breadth of topics with best-of-class trainers, quality delivery, and small class sizes.\n\nThe Promise: The masterclass will teach you advanced copywriting techniques that help marketers achieve tangible cut-through in today’s competitive landscape: covering tone; content; mediums; audiences; copy-stream management and more.\n\nThe Length: A two-day masterclass.\n\nThe Location: London (UK).\n\nThe Qualification: A CIM Certificate in Copywriting.

But once you have at least an idea of the answer to these questions, you can start making a more informed decision.\n\nFigure out how you learn best\n\nNobody learns in exactly the same way.\n\nSome like to listen to music and read about a topic, others like to get their hands dirty and learn on the job. Some like to learn at their own pace, others need harsh deadlines and someone at their back pushing them forward. Some like to have direct feedback on their work, others like to learn through osmosis.\n\nNo matter how you like to learn, there will be a course out there that suits you. So once you’ve figured that out, you can narrow down your options by filtering out some of the courses that don’t match your method of learning.\n\nThink about your budget\n\nUnless you’re literally made of money and are some form of medical marvel, then you’re probably going to want to decide on a realistic budget.\n\nIt’s a fine balance between finding a course that offers a lot of value, and not blowing your life savings on a course that might not even be the right fit for you.\n\nOur top tip is to look for a course that offers a money-back guarantee. That way, you can try it out for a few days and see if it’s gelling with you – so you can go without the stress hanging over you of potentially having to fight tooth and nail for your cash back.\n\nTCC’s TIP-TOP COPYWRITING TIP\n\nGETTING YOUR FIRST CLIENT\n\nReach out to local small businesses and offer to refresh their promotional copy or website – many will be grateful for the extra help!\n\nGo forth and learn the art of copywriting\n\nIf you’re new to the copywriting game, or specialise in one area and not sure where to expand your horizons, it’s worth checking out our post ‘The Best Tool for the Job: Which Copywriter Do You Need?’\n\nAlthough aimed at your potential employers, it gives a pretty handy breakdown of the different types of copywriter you could become.\n\nGot any burning questions?
