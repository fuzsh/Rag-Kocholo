        "text": "Dayo Adesokan – writer/producer Superstore COMEDY PILOT CATEGORY JUROR\n\nDayo Adesokan was born in Lagos, Nigeria, where he spent his childhood watching Fresh Prince of Bel-Air re-runs. When he was seven, his family won the Visa Lottery at next to nothing odds and moved to Chicago, Illinois. Growing up an outsider, he developed an early affinity for comedy. His first voicemail greeting was a two-minute clip from Eddie Murphy’s “Ice Cream Man” bit. Callers were not pleased. After earning degrees in Business & Biomedical Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis, he went on to work at a Finance Firm, covertly listening to comedy albums at work and performing stand-up at night. When he told his office he was quitting to pursue stand-up and comedy writing full-time, his boss gave him $11,000 to go pursue his dream. When he told his parents, they scheduled an intervention with their Prophetess, who gave a prophecy saying he was making a mistake. That year, his first script was a Finalist in the 2012 Austin Film Festival. In 2013, he was accepted into the CBS Writers Mentoring Program and moved from New York to Los Angeles on ten days notice. After the program, he worked as a Showrunner’s Assistant on The Game and Being Mary Jane . Shortly thereafter, he was admitted into the 2016 Disney-ABC Writing Program. He has since written on Freeform’s Young & Hungry , ABC’s Downward Dog , IFC’s NGO , and NBC’s Superstore . These days, he and Prophetess rarely speak.”\n\nBryan Buckley – writer/director The Pirates of Somalia, director The Bronze\n\nSHORT SCREENPLAY CATEGORY JUROR\n\nTwo-time Oscar Nominated Writer/Director Bryan Buckley has been dubbed the “King of the Super Bowl” by the New York Times, having directed over 65 commercials for the big game since 2000. Many pieces of Buckley’s work have been inducted into the Museum Of Modern Art’s permanent collection and he is an esteemed recipient of the DGA award, multiple Emmy awards, and over 60 Cannes Lions – including two Grand Prix wins in 2019. A 2010 Adweek Readers Poll named Buckley the Commercial Director of the decade and he was also chosen as one of the 50 best Creative Minds in the last 25 years by Creativity Magazine.\n\nBuckley’s directing career started in 1994, when he directed the Emmy Award-winning “This is SportsCenter” Campaign. In 1997, Buckley co-founded Hungry Man Productions along with “This is SportsCenter” creator, Hank Perlman. By 2004, the company won the Cannes Festival’s Palme D’or as the top commercial production company in the world and has finished in the top ten for more than ten consecutive years, the first production company to do so. Hungry Man has offices in New York, Los Angeles, London, Rio and Sau Paulo, and boasts an impressive roster of directors including Taika Waititi, Wayne McClammy, and Nanette Burstein.\n\nIn 2013, Buckley wrote and directed the short film ASAD. The film was shot in Africa with an all Somali refugee cast, and screened at over 50 film festivals worldwide, taking top honors at the TriBeCa Film Festival and Michael Moore’s Traverse City Film Festival, among others. The film was nominated for Best Live Action Short Film at the 85th Academy Awards.\n\nBuckley’s first feature film, The Bronze, was selected to open the 2015 Sundance Film Festival and made a splash in Park City as the breakout comedy of the festival, most notably with what Indiewire called, “one of the most hysterical sex scenes ever put on screen.” Bryan returned to Africa for his second feature film, Pirates of Somalia, starring Oscar-winner Al Pacino, Evan Peters, Melanie Griffith, and Barkhad Abdi.\n\nIn 2020, Buckley received his second Academy Award Nomination for his short film, SARIA. Based on true events, the film explores the unimaginable hardships young female orphans faced at the Virgen de La Asuncion Safe Home in Guatemala in the days leading up to a tragic fire which claimed 41 of their lives in 2017. The film was cited by members of Congress in a 2020 letter to the Secretary of State. Congressmen Adriano Espaillat and Vicente Gonzalez stated the film “amplifies global awareness” of the issue, and demanded justice for the victims and an investigation into the whereabouts of the remaining survivors.\n\nLater in the summer of 2020, Buckley created the Trump Statue Initiative, a protest art project to mock Donald Trump and actions taken during his presidency. Noting “Trump is obsessed with statues,” Buckley and his team have created pop-up living statues criticizing President Donald Trump in New York City, Portland, and Washington DC. Their work has received worldwide attention, and been covered by The Hill, NPR, The Guardian, AdAge, ARD German TV, AFP France, Sputnik News Russia (was not a fan) and many others. The Daily Mail called one of TSI’s NYC statues, entitled The Final Push: “A monument Trump will WANT to tear down.”\n\nMatthew Michael Carnahan – writer, Dark Waters, World War Z, Deepwater Horizon DRAMA FEATURE CATEGORY JUROR\n\nMATTHEW MICHAEL CARNAHAN was born in Detroit, but raised in California where he moved with his family as a child. He graduated USC with a degree in International Relations, and went to work at Morrison & Foerster in San Francisco, as a researcher for the legal team defending an escapee from the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland, who had been convicted of murder and membership in the Irish Republican Army. That was followed by 6 years at The Advisory Board Company, a think tank in Washington, DC, where he became a National Spokesperson and Senior Director. During this time, Matthew began to write the screenplay The Kingdom, which became a film directed by Peter Berg and starring Jamie Foxx. Matthew then wrote a play that became the drama Lions for Lambs, directed by Robert Redford, and starring Redford, Meryl Streep, and Tom Cruise. He adapted the BBC miniseries State of Play, starring Russell Crowe, Ben Affleck and Rachel McAdams, as well as the Max Brooks’ novel, World War Z, which became a blockbuster starring Brad Pitt. He reunited with director Peter Berg to write Deepwater Horizon, an account of the infamous BP oil disaster, starring Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, and John Malkovich. Participant Media then hired Matthew to write the screenplay Dark Waters, the true story of a lawyer\n\nwho exposed decades of environmental crimes committed by the DuPont Corporation, directed by Todd Haynes and starring Mark Ruffalo. Most recently, Carnahan wrote and directed Mosul, a film about the Nineveh SWAT Team in Mosul, Iraq. The film was an official selection of the Venice International Film Festival, and the Toronto International Film Festival. Mosul premiered worldwide on Netflix, November 26, 2020.\n\nEric Haywood – writer/co-executive producer Empire, Power, Manifest\n\nDRAMA PILOT CATEGORY JUROR\n\nA native of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Eric began his career directing and producing music videos featuring such artists as Usher, Cee-Lo Green, Outkast, New Edition, Ice-T, and Tupac Shakur. His video for E-40’s song “Sprinkle Me” was selected by MTV and XXL Magazine as the #10 Greatest West Coast Rap Video of All Time.\n\nEric went on to write for such shows as ABC’s Private Practice and Showtime’s Soul Food: The Series. Along the way, he wrote and directed three short films (Nick of Time, Intersection, and Staring at the Sun), each of which screened at various film festivals around the country.\n\nEric also wrote the Hallmark Channel original movie Relative Stranger, starring Eriq LaSalle (E.R.) and directed by Charles Burnett (Killer of Sheep). The film garnered three NAACP Image Award nominations and a Best Supporting Actress Emmy nomination for Cicely Tyson.\n\nEric wrote and directed the independent feature film Four of Hearts before joining the writing staff of the hit Fox drama Empire. He co-wrote and directed an episode of Empire’s fourth season, then directed the award-winning short film The Last Starship before going on to serve as a co-executive producer for Starz’s Power and ABC’s For Life. He is currently a co-executive producer for NBC’s supernatural drama Manifest.\n\nGlen Mazzara – creator/showrunner Damien; showrunner The Walking Dead; executive producer The Shield\n\nTELEPLAY SPEC CATEGORY JUROR\n\nGlen Mazzara is a television writer/creator/showrunner whose most recent work was A&E’s series, DAMIEN, based on the classic horror film, “The Omen.” Before that, Mazzara was Executive Producer and Showrunner for AMC’s record-breaking series, THE WALKING DEAD, which earned him two Saturn awards and was listed as one of AFI’s Top Ten TV Programs of 2012.
