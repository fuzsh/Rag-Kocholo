Once again, the board members and select community members judged over 120 films from all over the world and made their final picks for what will be shown at the 18th Annual Festival. “Seeing excellent short films that do not typically run in large movie theaters is a unique opportunity for our community,” Board President Leslie Werden said. “We feel honored to showcase films nominated for Oscars, created by high profile directors, and featuring well-known actors.”\n\nFilms selected this year will be shown in 2-hour genre blocks including Drama, Comedy, Documentary, and Horror/Thriller/Sci-Fi/Fantasy. Film Festival Director Adam Gonshorowski explains: “We are just over 45 films and have planned it so a festival attendee can see every film in the festival.” He goes on to emphasize the festival theme: “We have workshops devoted to our theme this year, which is The Art of Cinematography, and we are excited to present the ‘Worth Seeing’ award in this category, sponsored by Vance Thompson Vision.”\n\n. Some highlights of films selected:\n\nNominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject earlier this year, HAULOUT looks at the startling impact the climate change has on walruses in the Arctic. This thought-provoking film was directed by Russian siblings Evgenia Arbugaeva and Maxim Arbugaev.\n\nFirst-time director Jessica Henwick shares her drama short BUS GIRL, a touching look at an aspiring young chef in the cut-throat world of high end cooking. Last year, Henwick was named as The Hollywood Reporter's Rising Star and Variety's 'Top 10 to Watch' for her work as an actress.\n\nSeveral previous SCIFF award winners make their returns to this year’s festival. Director Kevin Haefelin has two films selected for 2023: THE FUSE is a drama blowing a fuse that ends up having a massive impact on the life of an aging widower. THIRD WHEEL is a unique take on a ghost story, set in the Edo period of Japan.\n\nJohn Gray, a New York based writer-director-producer who created the long running hit CBS series GHOST WHISPERER, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, has submitted a horror short, THE UNQUIET DEAD, about a young woman besieged by terrifying images. He previously won in 2021 for his horror film THE DESECRATED and in 2022 for his thriller THE THIRD DEFECTOR.\n\nIn 2021, Minnesota director David Mair brought his comedy THE HOMEWORK FAIRY about two kids who get some unexpected help with their homework. This year he returns with a film about quite a different spirit with his horror UNWELCOME.\n\nFestival alum Bob Celli returns with MY OVER THERE, a drama inspired by the experiences of the grandmother of his writing partner Laura Delano. MY OVER THERE stars EMMY winner and Broadway legend Penny Fuller as a woman sharing her experiences as an army nurse in World War I.\n\nAs a kick-off to the festival, Thursday, October 5th will showcase the new feature film LOVE… RECONSIDERED, starring Sophie Von Haselberg (daughter of Bette Midler). A post-film discussion will take place featuring the film’s director Carol Hartsell (FULL FRONTAL WITH SAMANTHA BEE), writer Arielle Haller-Silverstone (star of the 2018 SCIFF comedy SAC DE MERDE), cinematographer Dave Carroll (THE DAILY SHOW), and producer/casting director S.J.

The 18th annual festival will take place October 5-8, 2023, at the Promenade Cinema 14.

In addition to screenings, we have panel discussions, Q&A sessions with filmmakers, and networking opportunities for film enthusiasts and industry professionals.”\n\nCinematography is the art and technique of capturing visual images on film or digital, and it plays a crucial role in the creation of a film. Through the use of camera angles, lighting, color, and framing techniques, cinematographers are able to convey the mood and tone of a story and enhance the emotional impact of a scene. To celebrate cinematography in film we will give an award for best cinematography this year. We are also excited to welcome Vance Thompson Vision as a partner for this year’s festival and have named our Best of the Fest award the “Worth Seeing” award in recognition of their contribution.\n\nLast year’s festival featured films from Austria, Hungary, China, France, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, the United States, and more.

The winner of Best Drama and Audience Choice Juried Winners was SONS OF TOLEDO. Directed by Monty Cole, the powerful film traces a day in the life of a barber who wakes up to the news that his brother has been shot and who closes the day by giving his brother one last haircut. Director John Gray won his second consecutive Best Horror/Thriller award for THE THIRD DEFECTOR, having won in 2021 for THE DESECRATED.
