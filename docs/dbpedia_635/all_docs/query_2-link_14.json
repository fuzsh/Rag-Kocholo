        "text": "\"Nanette asks, are you allergic to smoked salmon?\" This is pretty much Bryan Forbes's opening gambit as he collects me from a Surrey station and whisks me in his big, comfy car to his big, comfy house, though it could easily be a line lifted straight from his superlative 1975 shocker, The Stepford Wives.\n\nIt's an oddly serendipitous start, since I'm here to press the veteran British director for his recollections of making the creepy, blackly comic film, in the light of Frank Oz's radical remake, which opens in Britain on July 30. And, spookier still, we're soon discussing it in sultry sunshine and decidedly Stepford-esque surroundings, with one of the original Stepford Wives - Forbes's spouse of 49 years, Nanette Newman - serenely bringing out course after course of cold delicacies.\n\nA sprightly 77, Forbes has appeared in more than 30 films, written roughly the same number, and directed about 20 (including The L-Shaped Room and Whistle Down the Wind), but The Stepford Wives remains his masterpiece. The tale of a gaggle of smalltown men who do away with their better halves and replace them with facsimile androids that are ladies in the drawing-room, cooks in the kitchen and whores in the bedroom, it remains one of the seminal feminist parables, despite having been sponsored - faintly hilariously - by cosmetics giant Bristol-Myers's \"Lady Clairol\" range.\n\n\"The producer, Edgar Scherick, rang me out of the blue in January 1974 and said, `Would you like to direct The Stepford Wives?' I didn't even know Ira Levin's book beforehand, but Scherick told me all about it. He said he thought it would be interesting to get an English director to have a slant on American suburban life. So I flew to New York and met with him, this strange character, the only producer I ever knew who actually tore a telephone out of the wall and threw it at somebody – fortunately,\" he adds, \"not at me.\"\n\nForbes describes going to New York and having dinner with Scherick and screenwriter William Goldman (whose CV already included Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid). Goldman adapted The Stepford Wives for the screen, but Forbes claims he made alterations of his own before shooting began (even though he received no official credit as a screenwriter on the movie). Was he happy with that? \"Well, no,\" he replies. \"I didn't get on with Goldman. Whenever I needed him he was either in analysis or at basketball games. He didn't like English directors – or maybe he just didn't like directors. But I thought his screenplay lacked certain elements that I wanted to get in.\"\n\nNext up was the casting, and it was Scherick, not Forbes, who suggested Nanette Newman as Carol, the \"wife\" who famously malfunctions at a party, suddenly unable to utter anything other than \"I'll just die if I don't get that recipe!\" (I sensibly resist the urge to say the same to Newman of her mixed-leaf salad.)\n\nMeanwhile, says Forbes, the lead role of Joanne, who fatally moves to Stepford with her husband Walter, looking for a better life, was originally offered to the \"lovely and wonderful\" Diane Keaton. But she read the script to her analyst, who got \"very bad vibes\" from it, and she decided against the project. Jean Seberg and Shirley MacLaine were also mooted, but the part finally went to Katharine Ross, who proved an inspired choice.\n\nThe shoot itself went more smoothly. It took place over 10 summer weeks on location in and around the Connecticut towns of Westport and Darien, and Forbes describes it as one of the nicest experiences in his entire career. \"I loved Connecticut,\" he says. \"Very English, of course. We shot in very hot weather. I remember the sequence where Paula Prentiss goes mad with a knife - it was so hot that we were all in swimming costumes.\"\n\nAlthough Levin's book had been out for four years, it was the film that was to burn the term \"Stepford wife\" into Western consciousness. I wonder was Forbes even remotely aware that his movie would do this? \"No,\" he says. \"I don't think one ever is. You do the best you can at the time. I always wanted to make a thriller in bright sunlight, rather than the `old, dark house' approach. The film is basically unreal, a sort of a projection of men's fantasies. So the only way you could do that, I thought, was to make it as real as I could. There were no `special effects', and even the artificial Joanna at the end was Ross herself, wearing red contact lenses that had been moulded over her eyeballs.\"\n\nReleased in 1975, at the height of the feminist movement, the film caused a degree of knee-jerk opprobrium. At the press showing, Forbes was attacked by a \"libber\" brandishing a brolly. \"I remember saying to this particular savagely disturbed woman, you've missed the whole point. A, it's fantasy; B, if anybody looks stupid, it's the men. It's not an attack on women, it's an attack on women being exploited by men.\"\n\nThat said, critics in America erred towards the dismissive (\"Hardly the landmark the world has been waiting for\" carped Pauline Kael in the New Yorker), and the film didn't even get a proper release over here. \"But then it got to the London Film Festival,\" says Forbes, \"and it became a sort of cult movie, running for about six months in one cinema in Kensington.\"\n\nIt was there that the film acquired a peculiarly pink following. \"There used to be gay Stepford Wives parties. They'd all go there dragged up in Stepford dresses and big flowered hats. But, generally speaking, the film didn't get very much attention or critical notice. It was only subsequently that the audiences found it, by word of mouth.\"\n\nThanks to the remake, which opened in the US earlier this month, a new generation of audiences is being introduced to the story. And yet, to judge by most American reviews and the online trailer, the film seems to have been reduced to a farcically amusing but toothless send-up of 1950s wifeiness, and critical response has been mixed.\n\nForbes is generous about the film's cast - which includes Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick and (in Newman's role) Glenn Close - but admits to being \"ambivalent\" about seeing it. He does say that he hopes it might kindle fresh interest in his original (re-released next month on DVD), a movie whose popularity has endured, despite its apparently being so of its time. How does he account for that?\n\n\"Well,\" he says, \"whether you like it or not, and why Playboy magazine has sold for 50 years, the answer is that it's an unspoken, conscious or unconscious, male fantasy: a compliant, sexy wife who's always there, squeezing the charm on and ready to take her clothes off. And it taps into that, doesn't it? And what's curious is that, apart from those early women's libbers, women don't seem to object to it. They treat it for what it is, an entertainment, and if they take their husbands they could perhaps nudge them and say, don't you start thinking of that!\"\n\nSexual politics aside, what seems most important about Forbes's film, and the reason that people will in all likelihood be glued to it in 50 years' time, is that it's a clever, sinister story, told straight and well. \"I think there's an awful lot of bullshit talked about films, post the event,\" he says. \"Critics always ascribe to you ideas that were never in your head. All I was just trying to do was make a good film. You try to fill cinemas - not always successfully, but you try.\""
