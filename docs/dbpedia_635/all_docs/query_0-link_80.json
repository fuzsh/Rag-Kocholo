        "text": "Well I wonder whom I'm going to piss off with this one.As I have stated time and again, there are some movies that we always seem to hear about but never manage to see. Be it because of spotty distribution or just a plain lack of interest on our parts, there are just some flicks we never get around to seeing.Take Lawrence of Arabia for example. While that film falls into the ¿lack of interest¿ category for yours truly here, a film that always fell into the former for me was The Stepford Wives. Based on the seminal novel by Rosemary¿s Baby author Ira Levin, the semi-satirical horror tale of man¿s obsession with creating himself the perfect wife has become quite influential over the years inspiring to varying degrees such films as my beloved Cherry 2000.And now after many years of wanting to see the source, I finally have thanks to the people at Anchor Bay who have corrected their much maligned first release with this the ¿Silver Anniversary Edition.¿ THE MOVIEMeet Joanna (Katherine Ross), a struggling mother of two and aspiring photographer who is less the enthusiastic about moving away from New York to the small rural town of Stepford on the insistence of her husband, Walter (Peter Masterson). Under the pretense of allowing their children to grow up in a safe environment where the parks are save and where they don't have to lock the doors at night, the family moves there and almost overnight things seem a little odd.First and most importantly are the townsfolk, especially the women. To a (70¿s) modern gal like Joanna who's dabbled back in the big apple in the growing Feminist movement, the women in town (which includes Gillian¿s Island castoff Tina Louise) seem too domesticated and compliant. Too obsessed with housework or baking brownies to take up more narcissist pursuits. Her suspicions are given credence when she meets Bobby (Paula Prentiss), a fellow big city transplant who has been experiencing the same kind of thoughts and worries. Quickly becoming friends, the two women begin a quest to uncover what is happening to all the women to make them such Betty Crocker homemakers.At the same time, Joanna must comes to terms with Walter¿s increasingly bizarre behavior as well as his new found home as part of Stepford Men¿s Association. Led by the mysterious Dale Coba (Patrick O¿Neal), the association seems to be at the heart of the mystery and when Bobby suddenly turns into a domestic goddess Joanna¿s sanity quickly goes on the wane and she becomes convinced that no matter what is happening, she¿s the next in line.All right, so much for my job of giving you a snippet into the movie¿s plot. Unfortunately to truly get to the heart of whether this movie is worth your time or energy, I¿ll have to reveal the movie¿s big twist. If you¿ve managed to live this long without discovering it, then skip down to the last paragraph. If you already know it, then let¿s continue. I'm not into perfection, pure and simple. As far as my preferences go, I¿d much rather have someone in my life who is real as opposed to someone who have been retrofitted with the latest in technology. Flipping through Playboy and seeing the endless parade of silicone injected, bleached blond bimbos that Old Man Hefner continues to force on us, well frankly it makes me sick. And the only thing I can¿t stand more then implants is a passive attitude. I want a girl who's capable of telling me when I'm screwing up. Someone who won't put up with any of my bullshit quite frankly. I'm telling you this to base just where my review is coming from. See like I said before, The Stepford Wives is a film about a town where the men are replacing the women they supposedly love with mindless robots who do nothing more the clean, bake, and screw. They have absolutely no respect for the women in their lives let alone themselves. They¿re pigs. And while I haven¿t read the Levin novel that inspired this, something tells me it was more of a satire then this film ends up being. Originally set to be directed by Hitchcock rip-off king Brian De Palma, the film adaptation ending up falling to the hands of a British director named Bryan Forbes. Unfortunately where De Palma would have pumped up the suspense of the piece, Forbes directs the film with all the nuance and flare of a 70¿s era NBC Sunday Night At The Movies TV movie.Things don't make much sense either. Does the entire town know what is going on? Is every woman in town a robot, even the checkers at the supermarket? Did Walter know what was going to happen before they moved there? And what man is his not so right mind would replace his wife with a robot sex object only to dress her in long dresses and sun hats? These questions and more are raised yet never answered.But perhaps the fatal flaw in the film can be traced back to Forbes and to the British lack of heart and personality. The film never gels as either a thriller nor as a mystery, which is what the movie truly is. If the original source novel is in fact a satire (the book has been out of print for nearly a decade), then there is none to be found on the screen.Another problem with the movie is in the casting. If the men in town are so hell bent to create themselves the ¿perfect wife,¿ then frankly the actresses in question needed to be¿and I hate to say this¿then less then perfect. While I was always a Mary Ann fan (again thanks to her personality), I will cop to the fact that there is probably very few guys raised during the sixties that would think that Ginger needs perfecting. The same goes for Prentiss, who manages to be the very definition of the word vivacious even while she¿s standing still.As for Ross, well she¿s the final nail in the coffin so to speak. Her character Joanna is such a pill 99% of the time that as an audience we actually begin to feel sorry for her husband, almost seeing why he would want to replace her. Noticeably cold, distant, and self-centered, Ross is so downright unlikable that were it not for the fact that her replacement will result in her death that we¿d see Walter¿s side and support his decision. In a good thriller, one shouldn¿t side with the villains. If there were a more capable director at the helm, then maybe this movie would have measured up. Instead what could have been either a scathing satire on men¿s obsession with perfection or the ultimate Feminist manifesto proving just how evil men are ends up being neither and is likely to insult both sexes for the same reasons.Somewhere in here there is a good movie trying to get out.6 out of 10THE VIDEOHere is where things really begin to fall apart. Originally released in the infancy of DVD in a non-anamorphic transfer, Anchor Bay was supposedly going to go back and redo the transfer for this second release.Well if they did, I¿d hate to see what that original one looked like because this transfer is crap. Yes, it¿s presented in a 16x9 enhanced anamorphic 1.85:1 transfer, but it is horribly grainy not to mention incredibly dark with colors that are muted and lacking. To make matters worse there is an unusually high amount of picture distortion and chroma noise visible at all times.If this was the first release, I¿d cut them some slack by saying it¿s an old movie and they did the best they could. But being the second chance, I'm not so willing. Especially in light of the work Anchor Bay does with other films of this nature.The video release is probably better.4 out of 10THE AUDIOSlightly less jaw-droppingly bad then the video, the audio comes at you in 2.0 Dolby Digital English and 2.0 Digital French. It's a period mix to be sure, so you can¿t expect a lot of booming from the back channels. But it¿s all right for what it is.Truth be told I wouldn't want the film¿s elevator like muzac any louder or clearer anyway. 5 out of 10THE EXTRASOK, now it¿s time to get medieval on someone¿s ass. There has been a lot of pissing and moaning about the disturbing trend of distributors as of late to give away a film¿s surprise ending or twists in the packaging materials. Take Fox¿s elaborate new cover for the original Planet of the Apes for example. By showing the image of Astronaut Taylor dropped to his knees before the remains of the Statue of Liberty, it ruins the impact of that film¿s finale. Right?Well the usually much more thoughtful folks at Anchor Bay has done that blunder two better by not only giving away the ending to The Stepford Wives on the back of the case, but also in the accompanying booklet insert and the disc¿s main menu screen.Geez, thanks.Once the feeling of being pissed leaves, you¿ll find a few noteworthy extras that have been included in this second release.The main attraction is probably the newly produced featurette called The Stepford Life. Chronicling the film¿s translation from novel to screen, it features interviews with director Forbes, leads Ross, Prentiss, and Masterson, and producer Edgar J. Scherick. Usually these things are nothing more then a series of self-congratulatory reflections. However here we¿re treated to a lot of insider information such as the near blood feud that developed between original screenwriter William Goldman (Academy Award winner for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) and director Forbes, the original hiring of Diane Keaton in the Ross role, and other bits. Either those involved don't care anymore or they got them on particularly chatty days, but you don't normally get this kind open reflection and its refreshing.Also of note are a series of radio spots and the original theatrical trailer narrated by Anthony Perkins, otherwise known as Norman Bates him/herself. I¿ll let you find the irony of that yourself¿7 out of 10The radio ads proclaim that every man dreams of having the perfect wife. And maybe that¿s true. And maybe if technology truly was at the point in which one could believably replace one¿s spouse there¿d be a market for it. We¿re certainly self-centered enough as a society to endorse it.But there's a line from the aforementioned Cherry 2000 that comes to my mind when trying to wrap this review up. One that sums up my feelings perfectly and why this movie ultimately is skip-able.¿There is more to love then hot wiring¿¿"
