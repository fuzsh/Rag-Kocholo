        "text": "Kitchen Sink Realism was a British movement from the 1950s and 60s that focused on realistic characters and a focus on the mundane, everyday life of average people, especially of the working class. It focuses on social realism and the depiction of domestic situations of regular people. Tiny houses, cramped apartments, and dimly lit pubs.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe films of this movement predominantly focused on the lives of the working classes, with broad regional accents. The kitchen sink films had no time for traditional, rose-tinted celluloid visions of Englandâ€™s supposedly green and pleasant land. Instead, these raw human stories revolved around crumbling marriages, the drudgery of unskilled work, sexual orientation, stymied aspirations, backstreet abortions, disenfranchised youth, homelessness and gender, class and race discrimination.[1] Dour they may be, but they are also vital, edgy and progressive. Issues dealt with on a daily basis in real life were laid bare for all to see and the disadvantaged, downtrodden and invisible were given a voice that has since, rightly, gone on to be regularly heard. The term \"kitchen sink\" derived from an expressionist painting by John Bratby which contained an image of a kitchen sink.\n\nLegacy[]\n\nWhile there was a limited time period for those movies and TV shows, the trend of these stories continues with soaps such as Eastenders."
