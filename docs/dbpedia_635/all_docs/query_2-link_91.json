His lack of attention causes inaccuracies in his work (the funeral directors of Shadrack and Duxbury), leading him to lie. As his errors and lies start to pile up he feels he has to get away...\n\nLeonard played Emmanuel Shadrack, Billy's boss at the undertaker firm where he worked.\n\nWatch a clip or buy the DVD\n\nShadrack was 'gunned down in a hail of bullets' (see picture, right) in one of Billy's dream fantasies.\n\nLeonard's Role Remembered:\n\n\"He gave a superb, subtly comic performance as Shadrack, the unctuously arrogant, determinedly 'with-it' undertaker. Perfectly cast - perfectly played. I always hoped to work with him again. He was always very high indeed on that \"What about...?\" list that writers compile when discussing casting with their directors. But the reply to \"What about Leonard Rossiter?\" was always, alas, that he was already spoken for.\" - Keith Waterhouse.\n\n\"Leonard made me laugh so helplessly behind the camera during the filming of 'Billy Liar' that it was I who often ruined the takes.\"\n\n\"His portrayal of Shadrack the undertaker in John Schlesinger's film was then, and remains still, one of my happiest memories of him. Several years later Ian La Frenais and I were working on the 'book' for the musical 'Billy', based on the same material. As we wrote Shadrack's part it was impossible to forget Leonard's interpretation, his beady eye and stooped figure. I polished up quite a passable impersonation of him while we read the scenes through, our favourite being the one where he confronts Billy over the question of what he has done with the firm's Christmas calendars: 'Still, we don't want to spoil your weekend Fisher. Why don't we talk this over on Monday morning when we may have to consider some kind of legal action.'\" - Dick Clement.\n\n\"I had the rare fortune to work with Leonard three times...there remains these three superb comic performances...I cannot imagine a time to come when they will fail to give me pleasure.\" - Willis Hall.\n\nLinks:\n\nInternet Movie Database\n\nBuy this film\n\nDetailed Guide to Billy Liar\n\nA Jolly Bad Fellow (U.S. title They All Died Laughing)\n\n1964\n\nWritten by C.E.

Nurses had to be on call during performances. Leonard's portrayal in this 30-minute film was nothing short of brilliant. Although he didn't produce the sound effects himself, his actions and intensity of concentration for each 'emission' made it hard to remember that he didn't.\n\nIn November 2018, the BFI (British Film Institute) made this film available to view for free. Watch it here.\n\n>\n\nLeonard played the lead role of Joseph Pujol.\n\nWatch the film in full\n\nLeonard's Role Remembered:\n\n\"Both Peter Sellers and David Niven had expressed great interest in playing Le Petomane. Both had found it hysterically funny and both were advised by their agents against doing it. Because of the nature of the subject it was thought that it would be bad for their image. That was the last thing Leonard considered. Was it funny? Was it valid? That's all. He decided yes, and played it delightfully with great dignity and delicacy. Nobody would have played it better. In the end we were pleased the other two had been warned off.\"\n\n\"Right at the end of the film we quoted [British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward] Gray who, at the outbreak of the first World War said: 'The lights are going out all over Europe', and we had Leonard farting onto the footlights of the stage, 'blowing them out' one by one until it was black. Great memories!\"\n\n\"Peter Sellers wanted to do it, but he was advised against it. They said it would ruin his image. And then it was offered to Ron Moody, who turned it down for the same reason. Leonard saw it and he said \"Ooh yes please, I'll have some of that!\" - Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, screenplay authors.\n\n\"Pujol was paid far more than, say, Sandra Bernhardt. She was on something like 8,000 francs, while he was on 20,000F. He was the Rory Bremner of the 'other end' and another day.\" - Ray Galton.\n\nLinks:\n\nBiography of Pujol\n\nRising Damp\n\n1980\n\nWritten by Eric Chappell\n\nScreenplay by Eric Chappell\n\nDirected by Joe McGrath\n\nStarring Leonard Rossiter, Frances De La Tour, Don Warrington, Christopher Strauli, Denholm Elliott\n\nWith the television series (from which this film originates) regarded as one of the greatest situation comedies of all time, LeonardRossiter.com has a separate web site devoted to Rising Damp.\n\nBritannia Hospital\n\n1982\n\nWritten by David Sherwin\n\nScreenplay by David Sherwin\n\nDirected by Lindsay Anderson\n\nProduced by Davina Belling\n\nStarring Malcolm McDowell, Joan Plowright, Arthur Lowe, Alan Bates, Mark Hamill, Brian Glover (pictured)\n\nLeonard played the Director of Britannia Hospital, Vincent Potter.\n\nWatch the film\n\nOne of Leonard's great big-screen roles, Britannia Hospital has a special section on this web site.\n\nTrail Of The Pink Panther\n\n1982\n\nWritten by Blake Edwards and Geoffrey Edwards\n\nScreenplay by Blake Edwards\n\nDirected by Blake Edwards\n\nProduced by Blake Edwards and Tony Adams\n\nStarring David Niven, Herbert Lom, Joanna Lumley, Richard Mulligan, Burt Kwouk\n\nAfter the death of Peter Sellers, this was an attempt to splice together a new story from linking new material and previously-cut footage from earlier Pink Panther movies.\n\nLeonard again played Inspector Quinlan.\n\nWatch a clip or buy the DVD\n\nLinks:\n\nInternet Movie Database\n\nOfficial Pink Panther Site\n\nBuy this film\n\nWater\n\n1985\n\nWritten by Dick Clement, Ian La Frenais and Bill Persky\n\nScreenplay by Clement, La Frenais and Persky\n\nDirected by Dick Clement\n\nStarring Michael Caine, Valerie Perrine, Billy Connolly, Brenda Vaccaro, Fulton Mackay\n\nA tiny, forgotten British island in the Caribbean - Cascara - is suddenly invaded by Americans, French, Cubans and local revolutionaries after a huge source of subterranean mineral water is accidentally tapped while drilling for oil.

He was always prepared when he walked on set, having considered every aspect of the role. But he also had a formidable technique, particularly in his ability to absorb great wodges of dialogue. Len knew he was good...[He was] happy to offer suggestions, but always wanting to be reassured in case he did not fit in with the director's vision. Len was always a character actor, whose strength as a breed is that although they take longer to become established they have great staying power. I feel that Len had hardly begun to show us his range and I feel cheated.\"\n\n- Dick Clement.\n\nLinks:\n\nInternet Movie Database\n\nLocation work article\n\nBuy this film\n\nReturn To Index Page"
