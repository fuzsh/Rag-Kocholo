        "text": "Zack Ford\n\nWriter, Producer for WATCHER\n\nBiography\n\nZack Ford is a writer/producer who splits his time between LA, NY, and Key West. He is managed by Ben Pitts at Citizen Skull. He’s a NYU alum.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nWhen I was 12 my mom wrote a screenplay for her MFA thesis at Binghamton University. It was how I learned what a screenplay was, and I started writing them immediately. When I was 16, I placed in the top 20% of the Nicholl, and I never looked back. I used macros on Word to format that script, because I didn’t have Final Draft software yet.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nHollywood is full of psychopaths who will try to stab you in the back even when it isn’t in their own best interest to do so. There is only one way to win: focus on your craft and keep producing new material.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nI had writer’s block once in June 2004. If it happens to you, walk away from your computer and ignore your story until it demands for you to come back. Don’t come back until it tells you how to write it. If a good story thinks you’re turning your back on it, it will sing like a bird when you’re in the middle of doing something else. If it doesn’t, put it in a drawer and forget about it. Your story isn’t your baby. Play hardball: you crack it, it doesn’t crack you.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nOne time in the rainforest I witnessed an extraterrestrial column of energy rising from the center of the earth into the sky. I saw to my surprise that its roiling lava-like substance was made of story, and I realized the pen is mightier than the sword, and that everything we do, even using our own names, is based on some story we’re telling ourselves, because we too are made of story, and humanity is one big story. It made me excited to be a writer. Ironically, when I finally took my phone out of the Zip-Lock bag two weeks later, I had a voicemail telling me I’d optioned WATCHER.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nAmadeus, hands down. And, the original Nightmare on Elm Street, which I saw a special screening of at AFF in the late 90’s, hosted by Wes Craven himself.\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nMe. Your favorite screenwriter has to be you. Otherwise, your writing won’t improve because you’ll be constantly hung up on comparison and you’ll never tell the stories only you can tell. Are you making sure Quentin Tarantino is drinking enough water and doing his yoga and getting to bed early so he can get up and do his writing? No. You’re doing all of that for yourself, because you are your favorite screenwriter. It’s you.\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nI’ve been coming to AFF on and off for 25 years, starting when I was a teenager. It’s become a family vacation. The panels and speakers are always friendly and brilliant, and I always leave AFF inspired. After every festival, I invariably find myself scribbling ideas for new screenplays on Driskill or Stephen F. Austin hotel stationery on the airplane’s fold-out tray on the way home. I’m always glad I came. And getting a photo with Wes Craven at that aforementioned AFF screening was a defining moment in my childhood.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nWriting.\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nSomehow, though I’m an introvert with a low social battery, I always leave AFF with about a dozen new friends. This is the festival where you will meet the right people, and you always learn something new at AFF. Panelists and attendees come to 10am panels with Texas-sized hangovers because they don’t want to miss a minute.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nI’m looking forward to AFF’s 30th year. Don’t tell anyone, but I prefer AFF over SXSW. If you’re deciding between the two, SXSW has a State Fair sprawl, but AFF is intimate, streamlined, and built on camaraderie. Plus, AFF always has the best movie premieres\n\nAny news with your project or career you would like to share?\n\nI’m rewriting a film for Universal/Bazelevs. I’ve also got about a half-dozen other projects in various stages of development, and I’m working on a Part Three of my “How I Hijacked Hollywood” articles for Script Magazine.\n\nStevie Wain\n\n@stayfunny_wain\n\nDay Jobs\n\nWriter of Day Jobs, Outcasts & New Hope\n\nBio\n\nStevie Wain grew up with Pennsylvania Jesus in a very small conservative town with one freshly out of the gay closet mom and one divorced bitter dad. Let’s just say… she can’t stop writing about it. She’s a legacy gay, filmmaker and writer whose latest produced tv pilot, Day Jobs, won the 2022 Audience Award at the 29th Austin Film Festival in which she starred, wrote and co-directed. She just participated in the 2022 Outfest Screenwriting Lab as a “Notable Writer” with her half hour script, Outcasts. Her other scripts have placed high in competitions like the 2021 ScreenCraft Screenwriting Fellowship, the 2021 Walt Disney Television Writing Program, the 2021 Austin Film Festival and more. She was a video producer for BuzzFeed, freelance writer for Bustle, creator of her own LA comedy show called, That’s So Gay! and has performed over 150 stand-up comedy shows in LA.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nHonestly, premiering my TV pilot at AFF and winning the Audience Award has been great momentum. It gave me the notoriety that helped me get started with an entertainment lawyer and we’re in the middle of finding management. Of course, the real secret to that is the eight years of hard work I put into developing my craft as a writer and expanding my portfolio. When the door opens you can’t be empty handed, right?\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nJust to keep going. Have a great therapist. Learn a beginner’s mindset. Take classes. And more classes. Befriend other writers who understand how hard this journey can be and celebrate their victories like they’re your own. There’s really room for all of us, it just takes time and perseverance. And Brene Brown. I’ve watched Call to Courage like 30 times.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nI just wrote a half hour dark comedy about queer middle school witches… and it’s a GIANT metaphor for my childhood and I think I’ve been trying to break this story…maybe my whole life. When things feel really personal and tough, I take my scripts through a writing class and get active feedback on the outline so I don’t lose myself in all of the possibilities. The real key is knowing “why” you want to write something and then funneling all of your story choices through that specific want. Like I wanted gay people to feel magic so I wrote a show where being gay LITERALLY MEANS you are magical.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nI just accepted representation with an entertainment lawyer and we’re actively trying to put together a team and honestly, that’s been the most exciting start to the new year. I feel like I’m finally breaking in and I’m just so excited to work in a more professional setting.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nMy favorite movie is Dan in Real Life and my favorite TV show of all time is Transparent. Both stories are about families who desperately want to be loved and struggle to see each other. They’re honest, down to earth, painfully funny and are the types of projects I want to be making.\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nI love this question! Hands down, Samantha Strauss and Joey Soloway. The End is Samantha Strauss’s TV show and me and my partner literally clapped at the TV when these two elderly women kiss… like the tension built towards that intimacy was phenomenal. Joey Soloway created Transparent and of course, it has my whole heart. The balance of queer flawed funny people just trying to do their best is my cup of tea.\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nTalking on the episodic storytelling panel at AFF was a great moment for everyone in my film category to bond. And it made me feel like… “Oh wow, this is what I’m supposed to be doing. Like, gushing about writing is where I belong.” It led to everyone on the panel feeling really close and supportive of each other’s films. And we continue to be supportive of each other’s creative journeys and that’s something I’m really grateful for.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nHustle bustle baby! I just participated in the Outfest Screenwriting Lab as a “Notable Writer” with my gay witch script and it was a dream experience. I also just signed with an entertainment lawyer and using the momentum started from AFF has been the exact help I needed to get my foot in the door. Of course, working on my next project, finding a manager, taking a new writing class, doom scrolling on IG. The ushe.\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nIt’s given me a lot of confidence to feel proud of my work and the kinds of stories I’ve been telling. Sometimes you feel a little niche in your own world, writing about things you know and to experience the audiences at Austin relate and connect to my show about a nanny/comedian who falls in love with the mom she babysits for… It made me feel like I belonged. Like the flaws in me might be the same flaws in you and we’re all just trying to work on it. It honestly felt healing.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nI’m excited to pitch my TV show and fill out my team of reps as I continue to develop new ideas for shows.\n\nAny news with your project or career you would like to share?\n\nMy work was featured in Collider right after AFF and that was such an honor.\n\nNick Richey\n\n@nickrichey8\n\n1-800-Hot-Nite & The Banana King (Semi-Finalist)\n\nWriter/Director for Low Low and 1-800-Hot-Nite\n\nBio\n\nNick Richey’s writer/director debut, Low Low, received critical acclaim from NPR, LA Times and Variety and is now streaming on Paramount+. His sophomore writing/directing effort, 1-800-HOT-NITE, had its world premiere at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival in 2022, won the audience award at Dances With Films, Best Director at Vashon Island Film Festival, nominated for the Grand Prix at Deauville Festival du Americain and was a marquee film selection at the Austin Film Festival. The Film was released domestically by Quiver Distribution in 2022 and internationally with Odin’s Eye Entertainment. Nick recently had a television series titled, Bedlam in development at CBS Studios and another series titled, The Montego Bay Sweepstakes in development at ABC Studios with co-creator, Tommy Dewey. He co-wrote Room 203, released theatrically in April 2022 by Voltage and Vertical Entertainment. He is now entering pre-production on his third feature film, BITS, BODY AND BONES.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nI was an actor first. I was always a storyteller but acting was my ingress to filmmaking. The first film I acted in was written and directed by Jonathan Hensleigh and I was inspired listening to him talk about writing some of my favorite action films from my teen years. When the shoot ended, I raced home, bought some screenwriting books, sat down and spent 2 years writing my first screenplay. It was complete garbage. I threw it away. Then I wrote a second screenplay and it got optioned by a production company at Sony Studios. I’ve written every day since.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nI’ve learned that there’s no such thing as not enough time to write. When I was waiting tables and had three minutes, I would pull out my server notepad and instead of jotting down omelette ingredients, I was writing dialogue, outlining ideas and building characters. If I write a half page or ten pages it’s a successful day. The second part to this is the fact that you absolutely have to sit down and put the story on the page regardless of your inspiration level that day. Push through!\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nThe hardest scene I’ve had to write was a scene from my latest film 1-800-HOT-NITE. Spoiler: There’s a moment when the phone sex operator tackles the main character to the ground and waxes poetic about life. Some things don’t have to be subtext. Some things are said aloud, screaming, crying. We talk like that too. Not every person spouts the ingredients for banana pancakes as an allegory for losing your innocence. Sometimes I’m scared to let those direct words fly and lean in. Luckily, I had the best actors and they made it all feel real.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nA major turning point in my career occurred when I got my first network series pitch. I was brutally unprepared and had zero experience pitching a show. I realized at that moment that I’m in a room, essentially asking a company to invest millions of dollars in a kernel of an idea. It’s like pitching tech in Silicon Valley. Since then, I’ve always gone above and beyond expectations, whether that’s self-financing a film or shooting a trailer for a series idea. I’ve met so many amazing people in the festival circuit because of that drive and have had two shows picked up for development at CBS Studios and ABC Studios (neither show made it but I’m proud of those projects).\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nI am obsessed with The Lord of The Rings trilogy. I watch those movies on repeat. I think Moonlight, In Bruges, Dr. Strangelove, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, Children of Men and Jaws are masterpieces. I love a lot of movies.\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nI love the Gilroys and Scott Frank, Martin Mcdonaugh, and Quentin Tarantino. Christopher Nolan has the most spectacular imagination. Issa Rae is a major inspiration for me in television.\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nI honestly have so many memorable experiences from AFF. The camaraderie was unrivaled in our entire festival experience. There was a particular spark that I loved though. I had recently parted ways with my lit management. Despite having a successful indie film, I just didn’t feel like we connected anymore. I had a screenplay make it as a semi-finalist at Austin and I hadn’t had a chance to do anything with the script before the festival. While in Austin, a producer read the logline and reached out and now we’re collaborating on a series pitch. Additionally, Joey Tuccio from Roadmap Writers reached out via Twitter and ended up sending the script to a couple of amazing production companies. These are moments and connections that wouldn’t have happened without AFF.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nSince AFF we released our feature film, 1-800-Hot-Nite to the public and have sold the film in some amazing foreign territories. I love getting to see people connecting with the film from Brazil to Montana. I’ve also begun casting and putting things in motion for pre-production on my next directorial effort. I recently decided to enroll in a tv writing certificate program at Writing Pad. I want to keep improving and challenging myself to become a better writer. I also plan to do the same with Roadmap Writers.\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nBeing part of the Austin Film Festival really reignited my passion to continue to learn about writing. I would sit in the panels and listen to other amazing writers tell their tales of failures and success and it made me feel like I was part of this larger community. Not only have I kept in contact with other writers and filmmakers that were selected in competition, but I’ve also felt extremely supported by the programming team and the festival founder, Barbara. This was my first time at AFF and I plan to attend every year, whether I have a film or screenplay in competition or not.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nI’m really looking forward to getting back behind the camera in 2023. I plan to shoot BITS, BODY and BONES! I’m also really excited to take a couple new television shows to market. I haven’t had a show picked up to series yet and I’m really going to fight to make this the year. Most importantly, both my mother and mother-in-law were diagnosed with cancer in 2022 and I’m excited for both of them to finish treatment and be cancer free in 2023!\n\nAny news with your project or career you would like to share?\n\nI was really honored to be nominated for Breakout Writer/Director of the year by the Indiana Film Journalists. My lead actor in 1-800-HOT-NITE, Dallas Dupree Young, was also nominated as Breakout Actor. We’re making offers to our lead actors for Bits, Body and Bones so hopefully there will be some announcements on that end soon.\n\nThe Pierce Brothers – Brett Pierce + Drew Pierce\n\n@piercebrett @drewdraws\n\nThe Wretched\n\nWriter/Director The Wretched & DeadHeads\n\nBio\n\nThe Pierce Brothers’ horror film THE WRETCHED opened in drive-in theaters on May 1st, 2020, by IFC Midnight and was the #1 movie in the US for six consecutive weekends, making it the first film to hold that record since the release of AVATAR in 2009.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nWe had written our first two independent features and coming off the success of the second one, The Wretched in 2020, we were able to land our first studio writing assignments.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nJust write for yourself and trust your own instincts. Fitting into boxes for other people doesn’t do you any favors and ultimately anything we write we have to be passionate about. That being said, after we write the passionate story, we love dearly we then tell people to be brutal with their criticism. The feedback has always made our scripts better no matter how hard it is to hear.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nWe had written a reboot of a horror franchise last year and it was very difficult to get the first act into shape because it required redefining the concept while making sure the fans of the previous iteration recognized the DNA of the original they fell in love with. We dealt with it by just putting in the time and grinding it out. Ultimately, we loved how it turned out and that was the result of just putting in the hours and getting a lot of feedback.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nWhen The Wretched was released to huge success at drive-ins during the pandemic. We were number one at the box office for six weeks and everyone in Hollywood had to read about it in the trades. It got us in the room with everyone in town to talk about the next horror project we wanted to make.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nHalloween (1978), Jaws, Signs, Poltergeist, Fright Night, Evil Dead 2, Empire of the Sun, Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nVince Gilligan, Mike Flanagan, Jane Espenson, Lawrence Kasdan\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nSitting in a tiny room with Lawrence Kasdan and a few others listening to him talk about writing Raiders of the Lost Ark and realizing the writing experience is just as difficult even for a film you perceive as perfect.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nWriting specs between writing assignments and working on film/tv pitches.\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nAFF always reminds us that screenwriting isn’t as lonely as it feels when you’re fighting through writing something. There’s a ton of wonderful writers to learn from and be inspired by at AFF and that’s needed to keep hacking away at the laptop.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nMaking our new horror film this year. We’re getting to work with storytellers we greatly admire and we’re excited that the film is a new horror concept. We love a good horror franchise but it’s a modern miracle to get a horror film made that’s not a sequel or remake and we love the challenge of doing something new.\n\nAny news with your project or career you would like to share? Include links so we can help spread the news.\n\nRoom 428 is the horror film we’re writing/directing for Screen Gems and it’s produced by Scott Derrikson (Black Phone, Dr. Strange) and C. Robert Cargill (Black Phone, Dr. Strange)\n\nGrace (Ge) Gao\n\n@stariagao\n\nOld Maiden’s Prayer\n\nIndependent Writer/Director\n\nBio\n\nOriginally from China, Grace moved to OC, California, with her family at the age of 16, then escaped the suburbs to pursue her dream as a writer/director at NYU Tisch. Years of wandering on two suitcases and working for international co-productions in Australia and Asia, brought Grace home to writing. Her stories examine how Asian women survive places they don’t belong and blaze their own trails. In addition to the recognition at Austin Film Festival, Grace’s bilingual feature script OLD MAIDEN’S PRAYER is also a Humanitas New Voices Fellowship 2022 semi-finalist, and a Sundance Development Lab 2023 second-rounder. She will greet the world with a sci-fi action feature script and an Hour-Long historical drama pilot upon graduating from USC’s Writing for Screen and Television MFA in May 2023.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nI started writing screenplays during my sophomore year at NYU Tisch. Although my concentration was directing, and I have made four festival-running short films during my undergraduate years, I managed to complete two feature screenplays at the same time. The very first accolade I received was for my psycho-thriller feature script NARCISSUS, which was a finalist at Screencraft Film Fund 2019. The proof-of-concept short film for NARCISSUS also became an official selection at LA Shorts International Film Festival 2021.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nDon’t sprint a marathon. A writer’s career goes on for a lifetime. Each small step I take matters, and each failure that occurs will help me grow. Living my personal life mindfully is the best way to cumulate inspirations. To thy own self be true.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nI am currently revising my thesis feature script, a sci-fi action film that requires elaborate world-building and sharp social commentary on specific issues Asian American women face collectively. It is extra challenging because this is my first attempt to write this genre, and the story’s message forces me to reflect on my personal relationship with the world I live in profoundly, despite many levels of discomfort that I discovered along the way. Thankfully, I have a group of classmates who are very invested in what I want to say and two brilliant professors (Jack Epps Jr. and Don Bohlinger) guiding our rewrite process. I am diving back into the index cards and outlining before I tackle the pages again to iron out some skeletal and conceptual issues before creating extra scene works.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nIf I may, the “turning” moments in my career were not “points” but “lines”. I see the growth process as a writer closer to knitting a net than drawing an upward line. The importance of “plant” is also paramount in real life if we expect a certain “payoff”. If I have to name a moment when I felt tangible acceleration in my career, that would be becoming a Finalist at Austin Film Festival while living in Los Angeles permanently.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine; Black Swan; The Proposal; Kung Fu Hustle\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nDiablo Cody; Florian Zeller; The Daniels; Lisa Joy\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nMeg LeFauve’s masterclass was a full house, and everyone was taking notes attentively like it was our first day learning about screenwriting.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nI have followed up on most of the connections I made at the festival with Zoom calls or coffee dates and continued to develop new works.\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nIt was my first time attending Austin Film Festival in October 2022, and I met many finalists who kept coming back to the festival every year. They shared so much wisdom on navigating the festival and beyond with me, and I was genuinely moved by how much they believe in the festival’s community. The accolade from Austin helped me stand out as an early-career writer when I met executives and producers who were just getting to know me. It is an affirmation of my craft as a writer and allows me to focus on presenting my authentic self as a human being.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nCompleting my current two passion projects and being open to more creatives who will cross path with me on my journey.\n\nAny news with your project or career you would like to share? Include links so we can help spread the news.\n\nOld Maiden’s Prayer is now in development for financing and production as my directorial debut.\n\nSaeed Crumpler\n\n@balance510\n\nStaff Writer for Flatbush Misdemeanors\n\nBiography\n\nSaeed Crumpler most recently signed a development deal with SONY TV, he’s been staffed on FLATBUSH MISDEMEANORS for Showtime. He consulted on BLINDSPOTTING for Lionsgate, working closely with Rafael Casal and Daveed Diggs. Also in 2021, Saeed completed a feature rewrite on MTV’s HIP-HOP FAMILY CHRISTMAS for Jamie Foxx and Datari Turner, as well as a biopic about legendary underground hip-hop artist Mac Dre for Double Down Pictures. A Bay Area BIPOC screenwriter with a music background, Saeed is a graduate of the UCLA Professional Program in Writing for Television. As a former hip hop artist who came up in the hyphy scene, Saeed has recorded with the likes of Kendrick Lamar and Chamillionaire. He strives to bridge the gap to bring stories from the subculture into the mainstream. Saeed was a fellow in the 2021 Nickelodeon Writing Program.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nI got my first break after being in the Nickelodeon fellowship in 2020. Nickelodeon and Showtime are both in the Paramount Plus family, later in the program, Nickelodeon passed my script FLIP to the TV show Flatbush Misdemeanors. That’s how I got staffed on my first tv show.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nThe biggest lesson I learned is writing is rewriting and fail early and often. If you’re an upcoming writer and are currently failing – you are very close to success. Just keep going. The writers who don’t make it are the ones who quit.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nOne thing I learned is that every project is hard and has its own little problems. I look at each script as a puzzle that needs to be figured out. You can’t attack one script’s problems the same way you attack another.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nThe major turning point in my career was my “not giving a f*uck”. Once I stopped caring about the results and feedback and just consistently put myself out there without being worried about the outcome – things started happening for me.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nThis is a tough question. But I will give 3 films: 1) Pulp Fiction 2) Do The Right Thing 3) Seven\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nScreenwriters I look up to Quentin Tarantino and Aaron Sorkin. Writers I look up to: Stephen King, Octavia Butler and August Wilson\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nA memorable experience from AFF was getting off a panel I was speaking on and talking to a line of screenwriters all sharing their experiences.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nI came back from AFF, energized and ready to write – so daily I’ve been working on several projects.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nI’m looking forward to meeting more talented writers, producers, and executives in 2023. My goal is to sell a couple of feature scripts and a couple of tv shows.\n\nAny news with your project or career you would like to share? Include links so we can help spread the news.\n\nSaeed Crumpler Overall Deal Sony Pictures Television\n\nAna Maria Defillo\n\n@adefillo\n\nMomentous\n\nProducer for Desus & Mero\n\nBio\n\nAna is a Caracas-born, Miami-raised, Dominican writer. Before her career in TV, she paved her road to hell as a Christian missionary, human rights grad student, & nonprofit professional. Now she spreads her gospel of cynicism as a comedy writer. She’s an alum of NHMC’s Scriptwriters Program. Her dark satirical comedy, Momentous, won at the 2022 Austin Film Festival.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nMy first big break in my screenwriting career was probably getting into the NHMC Screenwriters Fellowship. I met so many great writers turned friends. It gave me the connections and confidence to keep growing as a writer and artist.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nThe advice/lesson that changed everything for me came from a fellow NHMC alum and brilliant development exec, Erika Kennair. Paraphrasing here but essentially when people read my script they should be able to say, “Oh, this is definitely an Ana script.” Which is basically another way to say, “Find your voice.” Finding my voice always felt elusive and frustrating but for some reason her words flipped a switch. After reflecting on who I was, why I want to be a writer, and what I want to say as an artist, it yelled, “I’m down here, bitch!” It was in me this whole time but I let it turn into a whisper. When I said fuck it, this is me, it’s okay if not everyone digs it (shout out to my therapists over the years!), it changed everything. I finally became confident about my work (the most important thing), won AFF, and got repped by one of my dream companies all in the same year. Turns out all the clichés we’re told about “making it” are clichés for a good reason. And if you can, get a good therapist! Working through your shit makes your writing stand out from the crowd.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nIronically, but not surprisingly, the hardest project I’ve had to write was Momentous, the script that won at AFF, got me repped, and best exemplifies my voice. It was my first attempt writing a pilot so of course it had to be a high-concept satirical comedic mystery. I don’t know what I was thinking. Simplicity bores me and I like a challenge? And I’ve always been ambitious to a point of delusion, I guess. There was no magic formula. I just kept at it. It was brutal. It went through SO MANY versions and revisions over the years. Several of those versions probably made people question my abilities as a writer. Not their fault I guess since I was starting at 100 instead of 1. I took breaks and wrote “simpler” scripts but always came back. I knew it would be special and I loved it too much. Once I cracked it I experienced another cliché I thought was bullshit, it POURED out of me. It felt so easy. I’d never been happier. Of course it went through many edits after, but I figured out how to accomplish the million and one things I wanted to do with the story while still being funny. That’s all that mattered.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nWinning at AFF was definitely a major turning point. It helped legitimize me as a Real Writer to the industry and find the perfect manager. (With the help of Roadmap Writers!)\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nPurple Rain will never not make me smile. An absolute cinematic masterpiece. Don’t ask me how many times I’ve seen it or why.\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nThere are several, but the biggest one right now is Nathan Fielder. It’s funny, most of the writers I adore are also performers, I am not. But Nathan Fielder is on a level that I dream to attain. I also think our brains function similarly in the sense of how we process the world, but I’m not a white cis man so I had to assimilate in a way he didn’t. Watching him embrace whatever the fuck is “wrong” with brains like ours has been empowering and motivating. I really respect artists who continue to push themselves to evolve and grow not only as artists, but as people. It’s so easy to phone it in after a big success. Sadly, many comedians I admire have. But that’s not why I’m here so it’s great to see you can evolve and continue to pay the bills as a comedy writer.\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nWinning was pretty memorable and surreal but that’s a given. My friends and I were eating at some chain and Stephen Merchant walked in. He sat right behind us. I tried to play it cool but of course almost tripped over myself when I got up to go to the bathroom.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nI took a mini break from writing and met with reps. I also traveled and finished decorating my apartment.\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, winning at AFF helped legitimize me as a Real Writer to the industry and find the perfect manager. I also met some incredibly talented writers who asked me to join their writers group and have become dear friends..\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nThe new possibilities. And Yellowjackets.\n\nDéjà Cresencia Bernhardt\n\n@Dejas.views\n\nLast Hawaiian Sugar\n\nWriter/Director for Guerrilla Midwife, The Midwife’s Husband, Returning to Ananda & Last Hawaiian Sugar\n\nBio\n\nTraveling between her disparate homes on Maui, Bali, and Austin, Déjà draws upon her mixed AAPI lineage, finding inspiration to tell both narrative and documentary stories, often informing one another. Her films have screened in festivals worldwide, won numerous awards, catapulted humanitarian work into the forefront of the global public eye, and her film, The Midwife’s Husband, was nominated for a Student Academy Award. Déjà received her BFA from Maharishi International University and MFA from University of Texas Radio-Television-Film. Déjà’s feature screenplay, Last Hawaiian Sugar, was named one of the top ten unproduced screenplays by Coalition of Asian Pacifics in Entertainment and The Black List. Her prelude short of the same title, was the ‘Ohina Labs Greenlight Winner, a Pacific Islanders in Communication, Austin Film Society and Santa Fe Film Institute funded project and was most recently in the Sundance Institute Producer’s Intensive.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nI didn’t grow up with television or the ability to watch many films since we lived on a rugged side of Maui in an old, converted school bus with only one small solar panel that barely worked so I spent all my time reading, writing and exploring a virtually untouched side of paradise. I would read anything I could get my hands on which was a lot of what my own mother and her friends were writing. It was only later, in graduate school, that I found myself in screenwriting classes after spending years focusing on my documentary work. So, most of what I first wrote about, and still do, is based on my own life, those closest to me or informed by my doc experiences.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\n*I write from personal experiences and worry less about sounding self-absorbed. Filmmaking, writing, in particular, is either deeply personal or terribly unauthentic from my experience.\n\n*Try my best to create stories and films sets that our cast and crew feel appreciated and connected to and on so they will want to work with us again and again.\n\n*I don’t write or direct anything for actors that I don’t fully understand or at a minimum am willing to immerse myself in so I can, to the best of my ability, write and direct those moments authentically.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nThe toughest scene I’ve ever written so far was an abuse scene with a child based on my own life. The challenge was to show the reality of what the characters are experiencing while giving the audience a way to feel it even if they haven’t experienced it themselves and write it in a way that won’t force them out of their seats. The scene involved two children, so I chose to lean into the trauma of what the characters were experiencing by recalling the magic we all possess as kids and how the young characters navigate the incident by clinging to that very childlike hope and ability to escape in it in order to survive.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nI’ll let you know, lol. In many ways I feel like I’m just getting started but what keeps me evolving and writing is to continue living, not just consuming content, and write about THAT. The turning points happen again and again as we allow the stories to unfold without fear.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nEverything Everywhere All At Once, Goodfellas, The Last Emperor.\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nRiwia Brown, Sofia Coppola, Nicholas Pileggi, The Daniels, Aaron and Jordan Kandell, Christopher Kahunahana and some of my closest friends or others who I feel proud to come up alongside with like Annie Silverstein, Brayden Yoder & Zoe Eisenberg. There’s nothing like seeing your friends’ pages come to life especially if you’ve gotten to share early versions and the trust that develops through that process.\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nAAKKKK there’s sooo many! My short, Last Hawaiian Sugar recently had its Texas Premier at AFF (2022) – a real homecoming for me since this story was actually born out of my feature (previously titled Half Angels) that was a second rounder at AFF in 2014. To finally bring the short back as a completed film at AFF22 felt full circle and I am looking forward to adding on to this story when I premier the feature version of Last Hawaiian Sugar at AFF in the near future. My other favorite AFF past times are pitching with my UT-RTF fellow cohort, Britta Lundin, for Returning to Ananda, a pilot we co-wrote, at the AFF’s Pitch Finale, sitting in the lobby at my sold out show for Last Hawaiian Sugar because most of us couldn’t get in and experiencing the festival with so many of my undergrad students from Texas State University – witnessing how profoundly the AFF experience inspired this next generation of screenwriters to watch.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nI recently began the Compose Collective fellowship with Rosa Rebellion which nurtures BIPOC female writer’s and I’m deep in development/gearing up to direct my feature version of Last Hawaiian Sugar.\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nIt was the encouragement and nurturing at Austin Film Festival that helped encourage me to continue writing the films that I am now making.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nBeing part of this recent recognition of BIPOC female, AAPI & Indigenous writers, filmmakers & actors who are finally being recognized for their important voices and contributions in storytelling.\n\nAny news with your project or career you would like to share?\n\nOur producer, Gerard Elmore recently took my feature version of Last Hawaiian Sugar to Sundance Institute’s Producer’s Intensive.\n\nMatt Foss\n\n@mattjfossSingle Person\n\nWriter for SINGLE PERSON (Pilot) UNTITLED FEATURE (in production) and TRICE\n\nBiography\n\nMatt Foss is an Autistic writer who started his career in animal ecology before transitioning to making theatre, and then film, full time. He grew up on a cotton farm in West Texas, worked as a wildlife biologist in Montana, trained and performed at Russia’s famous Moscow Art Theatre and has an MFA and PhD in theatre. This past year he was a semi-finalist in the AMC One-Hour Pilot and Comedy Teleplay categories at the Austin Film Festival and a top five finalist in the Final Draft Big Break contest, along with being a Nicholls Quarterfinalist and a finalist in both the Screencraft Feature and True Story/Public Domain Contests. He was the 2019 recipient of the Kennedy Center David Mark Cohen Playwriting Award and his adaptations and productions have won a number of Joseph Jefferson Awards-Chicago’s top theatre prize. He co-wrote 2021’s award winning short SONS OF TOLEDO and his first feature begins shooting in spring of 2023.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nEarly on in the pandemic, a former student stopped by my house on his way to shooting his big famous show out in Montana. While we talked about the crazy plays we loved making back in the day, he said he thought I’d really like working on stories for Film and Television-so I started trying to find a way to translate my theatre work and how my brain works there to telling these kinds of stories. I’m probably right in the middle of that paradigm shift of that transition, where the learning curve is steep, the discoveries around craft are humbling but exciting and focusing on the typing more than anything right now.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nI’ve always had to start from a place of listening. I like hearing and understanding the patterns in what a book or an article or a person’s story is trying to say and kind of disappearing into that, finding a way to get that down on the page in a way both they and an audience can feel seen or known. That’s always been the part that worked in my head-trying to hear how somebody is trying to talk or tell a story and I’m terrible at impressions but I can both type and then find a visual way to get their voice and their story out there. With the science part of my brain, I know the law of observation means a part of me is present even though I have to try and find a way to disappear as I listen and type in this adapting work that I really like. What I’m working on now and struggling with more is when that part of me is a little more front and center. So I’m aiming at that more in my writing right now-trying to write and make sense about the stuff that spins me out or makes me feel like an alien and how to make sense of that on the page listening to myself like I try to do when I am listening to others, if that makes sense? I probably lean pretty heavy on what I’ve learned as a playwright-like even how that word is spelled and has that sense of making and vocation and feels like what I learned watching my granddad work problems and fix tractors in the shop. So I’m kind of working on my “wrighting” as I try to get to the next, better questions and mistakes.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nI teach screenwriting and theatre classes in a high security prison near where I live and this past year we worked on adapting personal stories into these kinds of analog plays where we could use the pre-cleared items already inside for all our world building. There’s an expectation of disarming authenticity writing for and with the students in that classroom that kind of adults and holds accountable the part of you-personally or on the page-that are not showing up fully. An incarcerated student asked me “why I was hiding” in class and in the project and it shook me up pretty bad. I think that has been the largest reckoning but also this really timely gift or challenge and is living at the front of my mind right now.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nI think I am in the middle of it as I am working on this next step and focusing on those parts where I have the most agency, which usually just comes down to story and keeping typing.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nI kind of collect these moments in my brain that make sense and kind of help me feel like I have a chance to make sense. Like the jokes in the airplane sequence in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade or Jyn’s speech in Rogue One about nobody expecting them and if they can make it to the ground, then they’ll take the next chance…and then the next, “on and on, until we win…or the chances are spent”. Things like that I collect and anchor to a lot for my writing or just getting through the day. There are parts of STATION ELEVEN that live rent free in my mind right now…and EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE, same thing. I grew up loving watching TCM with my grandparents. And Gregory Peck in the last five minutes of ROMAN HOLIDAY, especially the long walk at the end, I’d only be so lucky to get to make or write something like that. When people ask you for like a personal statement or a mission statement on a grant, I sometimes just want to send that clip of him watching her, unable to do anything or say good bye and trying to do the right thing even at the cost of his heart and then that slow turn and walk-man, I love that scene.\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nPatrick Somerville, Sarah Polley, David Milch, Gretta Gerwig, Scott Frank, Tarel Alvin McCraney, Nora Eprhon, Craig Mazin, Larry McMurtry and Dianna Ossana, Tony Gilroy, Lawrence Kasden. And I find a lot of inspiration in books, or a really good playlist. And the communities where I get to work and write about and for.\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nI’m not always the best in these kinds of situations and I had been practicing at some “rehearsal” social events and was really crashing and burning. Though I might be a little hyper earnest, I usually do fine in one-on-one situations but any place hip or cool or with music can sometimes be hit or miss. So, I was working with Lee Jessup and we came up with a strategy on how to build a set of tools for me and run this experiment on how to thrive and feel like a person rather than spin out in this new kind of environment. I met some incredible people at the same stage of my writing life and ongoing conversations from panelists that have meant the world and proved a real tipping point in my hope and belief that I can navigate all this authentically with my brain and self in a way that can make sense for me. In many ways, the warmth of the festival and focus on telling stories was an incredible place and gave me a lot of peace and peace of mind since last October.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nA lot of writing and re-writing on my own projects and those in my classes. And had a really great Christmas where we beat all the travel craziness with my partner and my families.\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nI saw so instantly the kind of community people describe in these kinds of articles or in the podcasts where they talk about the festival and how true it was. Coming out of COVID or wherever we truly are right now, I didn’t know how much I had missed that, especially in how new I am in this endeavor and evolution as a writer. The environment and the folks I met gave me a lot of hope and a lot of help and remain filled with gratitude for the experience and the chance to continue the conversation.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nI’m looking forward to getting to work on some new words and pages soon. We’re about two weeks away from shooting the feature right now and I’m nervous but excited and grateful and still learning a ton.\n\nAny news with your project or career you would like to share? Include links so we can help spread the news.\n\nNot yet. Maybe later this summer about who is on board for supporting the film. There’s one thing I’ll check on, but last fall Tony Kushner came to the University of Toledo where I work and I got to walk him to his car after a guest lecture and got to share the work we were trying to do here in Toledo. I guess he liked it so much, especially the work in the prison and adapting Toledo stories for and with community members that he donated an endowed fund for innovative projects to help support all the stuff we’d just been doing for free or with my credit card. I’m not sure if that is public yet so I’ll try to keep you posted if/when I can share that. I just found out\n\nAisha Evelyna\n\n@AishaEvelyna\n\nALEX\n\nWriter, Director, Actor for ALEX, SEAHORSE, THE DROP\n\nBiography\n\nBorn to Canadian Parents of Caribbean descent, Aisha Evelyna is passionate about bringing stories of the underrepresented to the forefront of our social consciousness. She is an actor, writer, and director, based in Toronto. Presently Aisha is in advanced development with her feature film SEAHORSE which she wrote, and will direct and star in. The project is a 2022 Telefilm Talent To Watch Fund Recipient and a 2021 Whistler Film Festival Screenwriter’s Lab participant. Aisha’s comedy series THE DROP, created alongside Dani Pagliarello is set to premiere via Narcity Canada in April 2023, and she is also a participant of the 2022 Canadian Academy’s Writer’s Program, where she is developing the limited series SALLY with Warner Brothers Canada. As an actor, recent film and TV appearances include RABBIT HOLE (Paramount+), and SLO PITCH (IFC/OutTV). When not dreaming about films or filmmaking, Aisha can be found eating donuts in Toronto.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nIn 2017, I wrote and starred in my first short film ACCIDENTALS. It was so hard that I swore off filmmaking, but five years later, here I am – Still doin’ it!\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nThe script is everything. If something isn’t addressed at script phase, you will always be trying to fix it in the edit, and odds are the issue will still pop up in the finished product. That, and keep going! Persistence is key!!\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nCurrently, the hardest project I’ve written is the pilot for my limited series for SALLY, which is a serialized biopic. Breaking the story of someone’s life was incredibly tough. Writing SALLY challenged me to honour Sarah Forbes Bonetta’s story, it challenged me to honour my voice as a writer, and most importantly, it challenged me to find the universal truths of her story that would resonate with audiences of today.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nA major turning point in my career came after I wrote and starred in my second short film SHOEGAZER. After the response to that film, I really started to own that I was a writer. Then when the film made its online premiere on Omeleto, the international response really changed how many perceived me. I wasn’t just an actor who thought it would be cute to try writing- That film solidified me as a Multi-hyphenate filmmaker that was proficient in working across multiple disciplines.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nFINDING NEMO (2003, …Don’t @ me bruh), KIDS (1995), WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN (2011)\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nMy favourite screenwriters are Michaela Coel and Phoebe Waller Bridge. They’re inspiring because they do what I do, and they do it so well! I’m also a huge fan or Andrea Arnold and Sofia Coppola.\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nMy favorite moment at Austin was watching Sarah Polley speak. She affirmed so many things for me when it comes to filmmaking and leadership. Leaving that talk had me incredibly inspired, but more importantly it solidified that I am on the right track. I just have to keep being kind and working hard.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nIn addition to planning my trip to the next AFF, I’ve just been trying to keep up with my writing deadlines, and make sure I get more than six hours of sleep every night.\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nScreening my short film ALEX (that I wrote, directed, and starred in) at Austin Film Fest has sparked the next step in my career. As I am revving up to direct and star in my debut feature SEAHORSE, the platform Austin has given me has been immensely beneficial in reminding me that there is a place for stories like mine in the world.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nThe release of my series THE DROP this spring, and shooting my feature SEAHORSE this summer in Toronto!!!!!\n\nAny news with your project or career you would like to share? Include links so we can help spread the news.\n\nhttps://telefilm.ca/en/telefilm-canada-and-the-talent-fund-welcome-16-filmmaking-teams-selected-under-the-talent-to-watch-program\n\nHussain Pirani\n\n@CourierByNight\n\nCredits: Writer for FBI: INTERNATIONAL (Seasons 1 & 2)\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in Karachi and raised in Austin, Hussain is a storyteller with over a decade of experience crafting narrative shorts, docs, and commercials. After graduating from the University of Texas, he worked as a commercial director, shooting in places like Munich, Tokyo, and the Peruvian Amazon. His love of screenwriting stems from his first love, which is editing and post production. Hussain relocated to LA in 2018 and, drawing from his immigrant experience, writes dramas steeped in genre that explore themes of family, identity, and human resilience. He joined NBC’s “Writers on the Verge” in 2020 and was also a finalist for the CBS Writers Mentoring Program. He is currently writing on his second season for FBI: INTERNATIONAL.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nI started writing spec scripts while I was living in Austin — a few gained some attention. I became hooked on the contest circuit and started applying with any and all new material. Over time and as I improved, I chased increasingly competitive slots for contests and screenwriting fellowships… It culminated in a pandemic year where I placed as a finalist in NBC and CBS’s Writing Fellowship — and at the same time was a semifinalist for Disney’s TV Writing Program. It felt a bit like winning the Triple Crown.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\n1. Don’t stress about things beyond your control. 2. Sharpen your intuition and then actually learn to trust it. 3. The first couple of pages of an outline are the most crucial — you’re establishing trust with the reader. 4. As you gear up for production, name your characters in your scripts — even the minor ones… you want to cast a wide net for strong talent.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nAny project where notes come in that you don’t immediately connect with is such a slog… If you can afford time away from the script and circle back after some distance — that’s helped my own clarity. If you don’t have that luxury, I found that for the feedback you aren’t sure how to tackle yet, keeping a hard copy of the notes next to you as you rewrite helps. Even if solutions aren’t immediately clear, the brain subconsciously looks for ways to implement each piece and solve as you go through your draft.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nIt was tough to find traction when I first moved to Los Angeles. I attribute my turning point to three moves: 1) The UCLA professional program, where I wrote three scripts in nine months. Like everything, you get what you put in. 2) Applied to the NBC Writers on the Verge Program with two of those three scripts and got in. 3) Months into the program, I landed a general with two execs, which very quickly turned into a showrunner meeting — one that changed my life.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nLately I’m coming back to: The Thing, Parasite, The Worst Person in the World, Network, Minority Report, and Cabin in the Woods\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nThe Coen Bros, Vince Gilligan, Marti Noxon, Patrick Somerville, Soo Hugh\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nIt might be the time Meg LeFauve bought a round of drinks as we celebrated the Writers Guild card I just received. She had only met me moments ago… but it’s a testament to her generosity and the spirit of the festival where we celebrate one other’s wins in this wild industry.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nBetween writing in LA and filming in Europe, the show is keeping me busy. I’m currently gearing up to produce my fifth episode overseas. Staying in touch with the lovely people I met at last year’s festival. Adding doses of inspiration and kicking around story ideas. I’ve also been playing some Wingspan and (for the first time) The Last of Us…\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nGrowing up in Austin for over 20 years, I’m a true believer in AFF’s magic. Attending the festival is a bit like Inspiration by osmosis when you’re surrounded by storytellers you’ve admired for so long. There is no “velvet rope” — we’re all friends… mingling and creating a shared experience of the festival, and hopefully planting seeds for collaborations down the road. I know I’m not the only one who carries that inspiration and energy into my own projects even after the fest wraps.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nTraveling — it’s how I find inspiration. Reading. Reconnecting with friends.\n\nRalph Parker III & Will Henderson III\n\n@ralph_tha_3rd\n\n@vagabondhendo\n\nSammy, Without Strings\n\nWriter for Umbra; Writer for Sammy, Without Strings\n\nBiography\n\nRalph Parker III and Will Henderson III are two Black writer/directors from the University of North Carolina School of the Arts. After collaborating together on their award-winning short film “Sammy, Without Strings”, the two continue developing creative projects, with Ralph currently in Los Angeles working in the film industry, and Will is finishing his senior year and thesis film at UNCSA with the plans of attending graduate school afterwards.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nRalph P – In high school, inspired by artists like Tyler, the Creator and Childish Gambino, I started writing stories for concept albums with fleshed-out stories and characters almost in a feature format. In my senior year of high school I finally wrote out my first script for the first short I ever made The Bridge.\n\nWill H – I started screenwriting in actual format during undergrad. As a kid I really wanted to become an animator, but I had no affinity for drawing whatsoever. I would draw really awful stick figure comic strips. In high school I did theatre, and would occasionally write monologues, so I think that’s where my interest in character writing started.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nWill H – It sounds cliche, but “timing” isn’t worth driving yourself crazy over. Things will happen when they need to happen as long as you keep moving. That’s the key thing for me: never becoming stagnant.\n\nRalph P – When you can understand and fully realize your characters, the possibilities of the story and world of the film are almost limitless. The power of a strong thesis is equally as useful, but the characters are where the script comes to life in my opinion.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nRalph P – The most difficult scene I’ve had to write was probably a discussion between a protagonist and his surreal mentor figure in my third-year thesis film. With limited page space allowed, it was seriously difficult to balance the conflict between the characters and their philosophies, the social commentary I was trying to make work, and nail a tone that would keep the audience engaged. Ultimately, it all came down to trying to find the characters’ voices, and letting the mentor lead the protagonist to the conclusion that fell in line with the thesis.\n\nWill H. So far maybe my senior thesis film. It’s about a boy struggling to stand up to his mother about not wanting to be baptized. That was hard for me to write just because it was very personal. I struggle with being able to clip apart aspects of my life to better suit the narrative, but what’s helped is taking a couple steps back and remembering that it isn’t about me it’s about this character and his journey which happens to share some similarities to my own experience.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nWill H – Deciding to go back to school. I did a year of undergrad studying political science and dropped out after my first year. It took me two years before applying to film school. It was kinda scary thinking I’d be behind in a lot of ways, but it was maybe my best decision so far.\n\nRalph P – The avant-garde cinema class I took in my sophomore year of college really had me thinking outside the box, making experimental films without any inhibitions and trying all the styles that I hadn’t tried before. When I realized they were playing surprisingly well, it boosted my confidence to continue experimenting, and trying new approaches, and helped make me the filmmaker I am today, and its spirit still inspires me to try to become the filmmaker I want to be.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nWill H – This is always a tough one. Some definite picks are Moonlight, In the Mood for Love, Perfect Blue, an assortment of Studio Ghibli (Kiki’s delivery Service, Whisper of the heart etc.)\n\nRalph P – My two favorites have always been 2001: A Space Odyssey and Taxi Driver, but some others that are really inspirational to me are Eraserhead, Cure, Moonlight, Persona, Hereditary, and the works of the Brothers Quay.\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nRalph P – I’d have to say Ingmar Bergman, Barry Jenkins, and Spike Lee (Maybe throw Wim Wenders up there as well.)\n\nWill H – This is even harder. Currently probably Michaela Coel, Jordan Peele\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nWill H- Honestly just the absolutely incredible films that were shown. I was blown away by all of the bold filmmaking I was able to witness, some of which the filmmakers were at such an early stage of their careers. It made me so excited to see what they do next.\n\nRalph P – Seeing the slate of short films featured by filmmakers both our age and much older was ridiculously inspiring. There was such a talented group of filmmakers there with such strong voices, it was an honor to watch their work and then get to meet and connect with them.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nWill H. – Writing, living, and engaging. I love finding a new filmmaker or movie to obsess over.\n\nRalph P – Mostly working as a post-production assistant for a show, but I always make time for watching movies, the weird ones, the beautiful ones, and the not-so-great ones.\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nRalph P – Since it was the first festival I’ve been to, it inspired me to no end. From the immaculate screenings to the wonderful receptions where I got to make memories and connections, it reminded me how real and colorful the world of filmmaking can be.\n\nWill H. – At Austin and through the experience I was able to meet and connect with so many amazing writers/filmmakers. It was my first experience like that and it all felt so organic and genuine. It left me feeling so inspired and rejuvenated. Definitely the spark I needed.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nRalph P – I’m looking forward to continuing to write and rewrite the feature film and television pilot projects I’ve been developing, and growing as a director, taking chances and grasping the opportunities that are afforded to me.\n\nWill H- The opportunity to continue to write and create. I graduate in May which is a bit scary, but also exciting. I’m ready for the next step.\n\nRaul Sharma\n\n@WrittenByRaul\n\nTURNSTILE\n\nWriter for TURNSTILE, SAVING SAM\n\nBiography\n\nRaul Sharma is an emerging Kiwi-Indian screenwriter with extensive development and production experience that spans Los Angeles and New Zealand. He holds a Master of Fine Arts in Screenwriting from the New York Film Academy and currently resides in Auckland, where he most recently worked as the Script Coordinator for Season 30 of POWER RANGERS. Known for penning dark genre features and adult animated pilots, Raul’s screenplays have garnered both local and international recognition, from being awarded the New Zealand Writers Guild’s coveted Seed Grant to placing in prestigious contests such as the Academy Nicholl Fellowships and the Austin Film Festival, among several others. When he’s not writing, you’re likely to catch Raul at the cinema with his mates, jamming to hip-hop, cruising at his local skatepark, or playing with his adorable pugs!\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nMy screenwriting journey began in 2016 when I received a partial scholarship to attend the New York Film Academy in Burbank, where I earned my MFA. During this time, I acquired hands-on experience as a Development Intern and Script Reader for production companies such as Arad Productions and Emmett/Furla Oasis Films, getting my first taste of film development. This eventually led to my role as a Development Assistant at Pantheon Entertainment, where I deepened my understanding of the script-to-screen process. After four years in L.A., I returned home to New Zealand where I’ve been putting my knowledge and experience to good use. As for breaking in… I’m still working on that!\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nThe biggest lesson I’ve learned is that writing doesn’t necessarily get any easier. Every project presents its own set of challenges and no amount of preparation can ensure a flawless first draft. I’ve come to embrace that writing is an iterative process and that the journey is the only way to discover the heart of your story. Also, that voice in your head that wants you to believe you’re a terrible writer? That never goes away. But the more you write and the more proof you get to the contrary, the easier it becomes to shut it the hell up!\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nProbably the feature I’m working on at the moment, as it’s the most personal thing I’ve ever written. Also, because my last screenplay did so well in the competition circuit, I have this self-imposed pressure to make sure this one is not just as good, but better. I’m still figuring out the best way to navigate these challenges, but part of it has been having faith that pouring my heart into this story is only going to make it stronger and more authentic.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nQuitting my day job as a content writer and focusing solely on screenwriting, which put me in survival mode and forced me to hustle, expand my network, and build my portfolio. Thankfully, it’s somehow worked out so far, resulting in my first paid gig to polish a feature, followed by being hired to develop and write an adult animated pilot, and most recently working as the Script Coordinator for Season 30 of POWER RANGERS. Even now, not knowing what comes next keeps me on my toes and prevents me from letting my foot off the gas!\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nAs a sucker for dark, mind-bending films, FIGHT CLUB and THE MATRIX are at the top of my all-time favorites list. I’m also a huge fan of THE PRESTIGE, KILL BILL: VOL. 1, DONNIE DARKO, AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR/ENDGAME, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, and PARASITE.\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nScreenwriters I admire include: Aaron Sorkin for his razor-sharp dialogue and deep character studies, Charlie Kaufman for his mind-bending and thought-provoking stories, and Christopher Nolan for his masterful blend of genre-defying concepts, complex narratives, and cinematic spectacle. These are true masters of their craft and their writing continues to inspire me. My favorite screenplay is probably DEEPER, an unproduced script by Max Landis, which is a total blast to read from start to finish!\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nAlthough I wasn’t able to attend the Austin Film Festival in 2022, I was thrilled to have my script TURNSTILE place as a Semifinalist and made sure to follow along online. However, I do plan on attending in 2023 and finally connecting with everyone in person!\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nRight after AFF, I got hired as the Script Coordinator for Season 30 of POWER RANGERS. Since production wrapped, I’ve been focused on rewriting past projects and developing new ones, networking with other writers and industry professionals, and doing everything in my power to see my scripts come to life!\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nIt’s been amazing to be part of a community that prioritizes and values storytelling. As an aspiring screenwriter, I’m incredibly grateful for having my work recognized and championed by AFF. I’ve received multiple script requests since my placement in the 2022 competition and it has motivated me to take the next step in my career and be on the lookout for a Manager who’s a right fit for me and my projects!\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nI’m looking forward to completing the script for my single-location horror feature DIAMONDBREAKER, commissioning a pitch deck for my adult animated series SAVING SAM and taking it to market, securing representation, and attending the Austin Film Festival for the first time!\n\nAny news with your project or career you would like to share?

Born and raised in Minnesota, she studied music and writing at New York University and eventually earned her doctorate in classical music. Her research on women’s history led to her historical drama pilot AMERICAN VIRTUOSA and her animated series for kids, ALLEGRA SPARKLE’S GUIDE TO THE GREAT COMPOSERS (YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE HEARD OF), which was a Winner at Austin Film Festival, a Finalist in Barnstorm Media’s BOLT Screenplay Competition and an Official Selection in the 2022 Catalyst Story Institute. Primarily a writer of female-led dramas, Lillie has been a Big Break Top 3 Finalist, a ScreenCraft Finalist and a Winner at Catalyst Story Institute in addition to many other accolades. She is a mentee in the first cohort of the NATAS/Catalyst TV industry mentorship program, where she is currently working with showrunner Jessica Goldberg.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nMy background is in prose and music, and strangely enough it was my musical life that led me to screenwriting. As a pianist I became passionate about advocating for women composers—specifically Amy Beach, who was the first really successful female composer in America. I kept thinking, “Someone should really write a movie about her!” and this thought was eventually followed by, “I write prose already; I could figure out how to write a screenplay.” I took a screenwriting class and started writing what would become my TV pilot screenplay AMERICAN VIRTUOSA. I immediately fell in love with the screenwriting medium, and I’ve been hooked on it ever since.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nI’ve gained a better appreciation for patience with the creative process. I tend to be a fast writer, but I’ve learned the importance of stepping away from drafts to let things marinate—as well as doing my due diligence to make sure a draft is really the best it can possibly be before sending it out. Screenwriting is so collaborative, and I’ve learned how to better incorporate others’ notes to support my vision and to give notes that support others’ journeys in return.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nMy first script—AMERICAN VIRTUOSA—is the one I’ve struggled with the most. Because the project emerged from my role as an advocate and historian, it was difficult for me to step away from the “tell every single fact!” mentality and instead create a compelling story for the screen. Historical writing often asks for a tricky balance; sometimes you have to venture away from documented reality to better express the emotional truth.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nWinning at Catalyst Story Institute’s festival was my first achievement that made me feel like, “Okay, yes, I am a screenwriter.” Seeing that other people were taking my work seriously helped me take my own work more seriously. I felt like the universe had given me permission to go forth and write more scripts!\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nThe Apartment, Thelma and Louise, Her, Promising Young Woman. And if I can add TV shows: BoJack Horseman, Reservation Dogs, PEN15.\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nAva DuVernay, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Charlie Kaufman.\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nThe best part of Austin Film Festival was connecting with fellow screenwriters. I met so many of my virtual writers group friends in-person for the first time, and I made even more new friends. It feels amazing to share that kind of space and energy with other writers.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nI’ve been busy producing an animated pitch video for my kids series that won at Austin Film Festival, co-writing a feature script, and working on new TV scripts. As my artist mother always says, “You have to keep a lot of balls in the air!”\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nI’m so grateful for the connections I’ve made through Austin Film Festival, which nurtures a uniquely supportive community of screenwriters and filmmakers. And because I won the Rooster Teeth Women & Animation Fellowship Award, I’ve been learning a lot through my career mentorship with Rooster Teeth Studios this year.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nI’m really looking forward to spending quality writing time with two new TV scripts that are near and dear to my heart.\n\nAny news with your project or career you would like to share? Include links so we can help spread the news.\n\nIt’s been an absolute joy working with FableVision Studios and my illustrator sister Jane Gardner on the animated pitch video for my Austin Film Festival winning kids series ALLEGRA SPARKLE’S GUIDE TO THE GREAT COMPOSERS (YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE HEARD OF)!

Most recently, he directed the documentary series Sketchbook for Disney+ and also worked on the anthology series Marvel’s 616, the Pixar documentary A Spark Story, More Than Robots (directed by Gillian Jacobs), and the upcoming documentary Stan Lee for Disney+. //// After writing commercials, promos and trailers for Disney, Aaron sold the feature script Madhouse to Lakeshore Entertainment. He then wrote two of the popular Return Of The Living Dead sequels directed by Ellory Elkahem (Eight Legged Freaks). Other credits include Furnace for Melee Entertainment, the Sundance documentary Linsanity, and he was brought in by director Justin Lin as a story consultant on Fast Five.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nWe wrote a really dorky script called Splatter Camp about two brothers who are washed-up SFX makeup artists from the 80s. But it won Best Screenplay at Eerie Horror Fest so we thought, maybe there’s actually other people who enjoy the same level of dorkiness as we do.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nIf you don’t totally love what you’re working on, you’ll run out of steam quick. And if you’re not in love with what you’re imagining in your head, well, the words on a piece of paper are going to be even more boring and soul draining. Before we wrote together, we probably spent too much time trying to be somewhat cooler, individually, with sad results. Also, give yourself a deadline. Otherwise, time will pass and before you know it, you could be one of those odd characters wandering around film festivals yammering about some short they wrote 15 years ago as if it was a turning point in cinema.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nOur next one. We just get too excited about too many ideas. Google docs can be a slippery slope. Aaron’s particularly good about saying, “Look, let’s pick one”. The next script usually feels right if it feels a little out of reach, a little weirder but the core concept is fun enough to sustain a year of criticism, doubt and debates.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nBeing a Finalist at AFF with Shaky Shivers was huge. It gave us tons of confidence. We stopped describing our writing as “pretty dumb” and instead said things like “it’s genre-driven”. Sung Kang (Fast & Furious) read the script, saw how fun it would be to make and he made it all happen. We shot it late summer of 2021, with Gabe Bartalos (Gremlins 2, Army of the Dead, Leprechaun) doing all the practical SFX and it just screened at Overlook and Screamfest.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nE.T., Predator, Pee Wee’s Big Adventure, They Live, Evil Dead 2, Back to the Future, Creepshow, An American Werewolf in London, Raising Arizona, Bad Taste, The Shining\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nThe Coen Brothers, Edgar Wright, Guillermo del Toro, Sam Raimi\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nWe got the most comically gross, falsely-advertised Airbnb ever which we still laugh about. But really, it was how kind and down-to-Earth the amazing panelists were. We also met a lot of screenwriters at AFF who continue to support us, give us thoughtful feedback on our drafts and just help us improve ideas in a very selfless, non-competitive way.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nAside from writing, Andy directed a doc series Sketchbook about Disney artists, and co-produced A Jedi’s Return. Being raised on all things Star Wars, it was a total dream come true. Aaron has mainly been writing but also served as a story producer for shows like LegoMasters and MasterChef as well as story producing and writing for the Apple+ docu-series Dear…\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nTrying to make anything can feel like a lonely pursuit but going to AFF and meeting others that were also sort of tilting at windmills has been inspiring. We formed a bond with a group of fellow weirdos who all just push each other to make ideas more fearless and interesting. So that warms our hearts and keeps the engine running.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nAfter a great festival run in 2022, we’re really excited to get Shaky Shivers out into the world! There are multiple offers from distribution companies so we’ll know where we’re landing by the time this article comes out!\n\nAny news with your project or career you would like to share?

They were most recently staff writers on Steve Levitan’s Hulu series REBOOT, and are currently developing a new project with Levitan at 20th TV under a Blind Script Deal. They are also developing an original feature with Imagine Entertainment and have their pilot UNLADYLIKE set up with Miramax TV. Previously, they were participants in The Black List x Women In Film Episodic Lab 2021 and have been Finalists in numerous contests, including AFF and Slamdance where UNLADYLIKE was awarded 2nd place.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nWe started writing together as a team in March of 2020 and by the end of that year we were chosen as Finalists at AFF. That truly was our breaking-in moment. With that placement, we signed with our manager and quickly began taking general meetings with production companies.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nAlways wait for the signed paperwork before celebrating.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nThe most challenging script we’ve ever worked on together was our first pilot, DARK HORSE. Though these days we’ve developed a unique rhythm of breaking story, when we first broke that script we were still finding our voices, both separate and apart. We completed that first draft as a comedic procedural, but we both knew it wasn’t quite right. Despite there being characters we loved and jokes that made us laugh, we realized it wasn’t the kind of story we wanted to tell. So, in an inspired, though seemingly insane move, we scrapped almost the entirety of the script and started fresh. With a new mindset we found a different direction and wrote a new draft in just under a week. That script got us into AFF.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nJoining the WGA was not only a momentous milestone but allowed us to be taken seriously as writers. Suddenly contracts had to include minimums, we had health insurance through writing, and best of all, by calling ourselves WGA writers we could finally keep our imposter syndrome at bay (at least every once in a while.)\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nOur taste in movies runs the gamut, but a few of our favorites are First Wives Club, Hereditary, Pride and Prejudice and Spy.\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nPhoebe Waller Bridge is the epitome of screenwriter perfection. We’re also huge fans of Tony McNamara, Jac Schaeffer and Ari Aster.\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nListening to Lisa Joy speak on the early days of her career was incredibly moving and inspiring. As someone who came up during a time in writer’s rooms unequivocally dominated by men, Lisa had unparalleled lessons to share that we still reference today.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nSince AFF we’ve managed to move from being “aspiring writers” to quitting our day jobs and concentrating solely on our writing pursuits. We’ve been developing our original projects and were most recently staffed on Steve Levitan’s Hulu series REBOOT.\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nBeing selected as Finalists for AFF validated our early writing journeys and gave us a jolt of confidence for our screenwriting careers – and in a lot of ways started our careers.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nWe have a slew of projects on our plate, and we’re excited to move onto next steps with those in development. Our big goal for this year is for one of our projects to be picked up by a network or streaming service with production to follow.\n\nChristina K. Moore\n\n@chrisyLA\n\nBarry: Psalm 91:1 (2021), PolyAna (2020)\n\nWriter for Are You Afraid of the Dark, Unbound\n\nBiography\n\nChristina K. Moore is a diverse screenwriter with a background in acting and post production. She most recently wrote and co-produced for the Nickelodeon show Are You Afraid of the Dark and now has multiple studio projects in various stages of development and production. With her unique experience as a post producer, Christina has ushered directors and showrunners though the post process from cuts to final mix on shows for WB, DC, Universal, Marvel, and Viacom. This expertise has helped Christina become an engaging creator and economical screenwriter.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nI’d been acting and producing in LA for a decade when in 2020, I finally had the courage to pour myself into writing – a passion that took a pandemic to pursue. I finished two comedy pilots within a month for programs and competitions, both scripts would later go on to be selected for AFF in 2020 and 2021. Getting into Austin gave me the confidence to call myself a writer – which sincerely changed the game. Later, while working on a show as a post producer, I connected with my showrunner for career advice and he immediately advocated for me as an emerging writer. The following season, he offered me a staff writer position and we’ve been working together ever since. In fact, I received that call the same day I arrived in Austin for AFF 2021. Talk about a dream come true, and if you ever get the chance to work with the brilliant JT Billings – DO IT.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nWriters are just the first department on. Teams of artistic pros will bend over backwards to execute what’s on the page, so allow yourself to examine what’s essential to your story. Production limitations can often be a crucial and clarifying part of the creative process.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nThe hardest scenes I’ve had to write are the ones where I know everything’s going to change based on production realities. But those experiences actually helped me realize what makes a good scene. It’s not about clever dialogue or a jaw-dropping set – it’s about character stakes. Getting clear about that made the initial writing process easier and the inevitable rewrites less daunting.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nGetting into AFF! It was the first time I had the courage to call myself a writer and the other writers I met at the festival felt like creative kin.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\niOrigins, Parasite, Arrival, Hereditary, Interstellar, The Proposal\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nAdam McKay, Rian Johnson, Martin McDonagh\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nThe same day I arrived in Austin for the 2021 Festival, I received the call that I was staffed on my first show! The weekend was spent celebrating with my fellow writers and attending panels, which perfecting primed me to start work as a professional writer that Monday.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nWriting mostly!\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nHaving the weight of being an Austin Film Festival script competition alum has helped ground my endeavors in LA. Not only is it a feather in my cap, but the experience of attending the conference has provided a sense of community in an otherwise solo profession.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nI have multiple writing projects in the works, but this year I will become a mom. I’m excited to explore the messy and rewarding intersection of ambition and motherhood.\n\nAny news with your project or career you would like to share? Include links so we can help spread the news.\n\nNot that I can announce just yet but would love to share when I can!\n\nKim Marcelino\n\n@kim_marcelino_\n\nEither/Or\n\nWriter, Director for Bad Asian\n\nBiography\n\nKim is a Chinese- and Filipino-American writer, director, and award-winning playwright. She writes lighthearted comedies about serious subjects centering on flawed women of color. Her screenwriting has placed at the Academy Nicholl Fellowship, ScreenCraft Fellowship, PAGE International Screenwriting Awards, and Austin Film Festival. She trained in improv and sketch comedy at UCB and The PIT, and she’s spent countless nights playing make-believe in basements across New York City. She is and always will be a New Yorker to her bones.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nI wanted to be a writer for as long as I can remember, but coming from an immigrant family pursuing a career in the arts felt too risky. I initially went into academia because it felt like a “safe” way to be a writer. About halfway through my Ph.D. I was deeply unhappy and I knew that I had to stop letting fear guide my life. I thought: what’s the scariest thing I can do right now? And at the time, that was taking an improv class. Turns out people think I’m funny. I did the whole improv thing for a couple of years, I made it on a house team, and performed around NYC. And making people laugh on stage gave me the confidence to start screenwriting.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nWhy is more important than what.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nI find that the hardest scenes or stories to write are the ones where I’m too close to the emotional truth of it to see my characters and their situations clearly. As a writer, you want to write from a place of emotional truth, but I had to learn the hard way that the traumas I write from need to be resolved!\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nI think there comes a point when your writing tells you that it doesn’t want to live on your hard drive anymore. I don’t remember exactly when this happened to me, but I do remember the feeling. The moment I committed to realizing my work rather than waiting for others to produce it is when things really changed for me.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nThe Square, Swiss Army Man, Lost in Translation, Robot and Frank, Win Win, Tokyo Story\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nSharon Horgan, Mindy Kaling, Phoebe-Waller Bridge, Mike White, Noah Baumbach, Charlie Kaufman, Coen Brothers. I could keep going.\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nI was so nervous to attend! It was my first time going to the conference and I traveled there without knowing anyone. But by the end of day one I remember walking around downtown Austin with a group of strangers and feeling like I was part of a community.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nWriting, writing, writing. With the occasional snack break.\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nI met my writers group at Austin. We’ve been together for over a year now. Having that safe space from which to create has been huge. Not just from a craft standpoint, although eyes on pages always helps, but writers can be really hard on themselves — or at least I am! And having a group of people to cheer you on, even when you don’t feel worthy of being cheered I think has had a really positive impact on my ability to create and produce this last year.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nI directed my first short film, Bad Asian, at the end of 2022 and we’ve been submitting it to festivals. I’m looking forward to seeing how it does and where it goes.\n\nAny news with your project or career you would like to share? Include links so we can help spread the news.\n\nYou can check out the trailer for my short film Bad Asian here: www.badasianfilm.com\n\nChinwe Okorie\n\n@chinwefilms\n\nElephant!\n\nWriter, Director for Lovebites; Elephant!\n\nBiography\n\nChinwe Okorie is a multi-genre writer and a director who crafts stories rooted in reality and elevated by witty and absurdist observation. Her directorial voice is bold, mature, and exceptionally brave. Her previous film LOVEBITES was hand selected by Issa Rae to be featured on her YouTube Channel and her newest film ELEPHANT!, a dark comedy about mental health in teens, which premiered at the 2022 Austin Film Festival.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nTo make a long story short: I am a director and in order to get my ideas to the screen, I needed to write.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nWriting comedy is really hard, but it’s necessary when your script is leaning towards tragedy because it creates a powerful emotion that sometimes sneaks up on you. The dance between the two emotions is something I learned on my script Elephant! and I’ve continued to implement on future projects.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nThe most difficult scene to write was set at a teenager’s birthday party. Our middle school villainess, Holly, has her mind set on turning a horse into a unicorn. When the petty zoo cannot satisfy her fantastical whims, Holly decides to transform the horse herself thanks to arts, crafts and thumbtacks. As she parades the bloody horse, the party erupts into chaos. The challenge of writing a scene like this lies in going over the top just a little bit, but without derailing the delicate balance of tone, story, and character.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nPremiering a short film at Austin Film Festival\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nThe Godfather part 1 and 2, I can watch that anytime it’s on; The Lobster, Parasite, The Banshees of Inisherin, The Lion King, There Will Be Blood, Shoplifters… to name a few\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino (amazing dialogues), Greta Gerwig, Barry Jenkins, Stefani Robinson\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nAttending AFF is always memorable, one year I had drinks with David Kajganich (writer of “Bones & All” and “Suspiria“) after attending his panel on story structure. I hadn’t gotten any of my films to a festival at that point, but he was so encouraging and kept my spirit up. We kept in touch after the festival and so a few years later, I was excited to tell him that I finally got a film into AFF! That’s one thing I love about this festival, you make genuine connections here.\n\nHow have you been spending your time since being a part of Austin Film Festival?\n\nI’ve seen growth in my storytelling capabilities ever since I joined a writer’s group that mirrors a writer’s room. It also helps that it holds me accountable and I am constantly inspired each week!\n\nHow has being part of the Austin Film Festival Community helped spark your storytelling journey or career?\n\nThe people I have met have changed my outlook on the film industry. What once felt impossible seems possible after witnessing peers’ career grow year to year.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to in 2023?\n\nI am looking forward to getting the feature adaptation of Elephant! moving towards production.\n\nHanadi Elyan\n\n@HanadiElyan\n\nNadia’s Visa (2018), Salma’s Home (2022)\n\nWriter for Salma’s Home; Nadia’s Visa\n\nBiography\n\nHanadi Elyan is a Jordanian Palestinian filmmaker based in Boston, she believes in breaking stereotypes through telling stories of the shared human experience. Her films have competed in festivals around the world and have gained attention from top publications including The Los Angeles Times, Al Jazeera and the BBC. Her latest film Salma’s Home has won Austin Film Festival 2022 Best Feature Film Audience Award, Best Feature Film:Global Vision at The Cinequest Film Festival 2022 and remained on Netflix’s top ten streamed films for four weeks in its country, Jordan. She holds an MFA in Film Directing from UCLA and is currently serving as an assistant professor of narrative film directing at Emerson College.\n\nHow did you get your start in screenwriting?\n\nI’ve always been a storyteller but I started screenwriting out of necessity, I am a director first and I couldn’t find scripts to direct, let alone stories that moved and motivated me enough to take them into production, so I started the tough task of writing scripts and became slowly but steadily – with a lot of help, formal training and mentorship- a better writer.\n\nDetail some of the biggest lessons you have learned.\n\nThat’s it’s better to have a bad script than no script at all. We all have to start somewhere and I cannot fix it if it’s not written down.\n\nWhat’s the hardest scene or project you’ve ever had to write in your career? How did you navigate the challenge?\n\nHonestly, they are all hard to write. But I guess the hardest ones to write for me must be the emotional scenes where the characters pour their hearts out, only because I have a fear that the scenes might slip into melodrama territory. Usually listening to my script read out loud in a table read helps a lot.\n\nWhat was a major turning point in your career?\n\nStarting to teach, as a professor I’m reading many more scripts than before, keeps me close to the page, also it’s a blessing that I have very talented students that keep me inspired.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite films?\n\nOne Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest, Three Colours: White\n\nWho are some of your favorite screenwriters? Who do you look to for inspiration?\n\n–\n\nShare a memorable experience sparked from Austin Film Festival?\n\nThrough the conference days, I saw a queue to a panel go all the way into the street and wrap around the building, I joined the line without knowing what panel it was or who the speakers were, out of peer pressure I guess, and I am so happy I did.
