        "text": "The Face of ’63\n\n1 – Britain by Peter Cowie\n\nNo art can progress without innovation: but the cinema, more than any other art, ignores its creators. Their commercial failures are ridiculed and their commercial successes quietly emulated by the hacks and exploited by the hucksters. Yet without them there could be no change: without them films would be creatively sterile, commercially moribund. Who are the creators? What forces are at work in the cinema today? ‘films and filming’ sent its writers into the studios to come back with an on-the-spot report on the people who will make an impact in the cinema in 1963\n\nWith Britain hovering uneasily on the borders of the European Common Market, the time is ripe to assess the present ‘face’ of the British cinema. No one could pretend that this country’s studios produce such a consistently high percentage of fine films as Italy, France, Russia, Poland or even Holland and Sweden {I stress this because foreign films are not all award-winners).\n\nThe basis of British cinemas’ diet has long been the influx of American films. As a result, the second feature-British or foreign-is still an essential ingredient of most provincial programmes. Their standard is generally poor (Brushfire!, New Orleans after Dark and Lost Battalion in recent months) and yet the old family image of a ‘night out’ still persists, and many provincial houses in Britain would probably take less money if the second feature were subtracted from their programme.\n\nThus the British market gives short shrift to such men as Richard Williams, George Dunning and John Halas, who produce excellent cartoons, often with serious overtones. Sponsored films of such firms as Shell and Ford rarely get shown outside film societies and art houses. The chances of a famous name being made in these fields are still slight.\n\nDespite all this, how perceptive can the British audience be, or rather how perceptive is it allowed to be? Undoubtedly the public wants films like Room at the Top, The Angry Silence, Tiger Bay, Look Back in Anger, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, A Kind of Loving, A Taste of Honey, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, and The L-Shaped Room. If released carefully and at the right time, such films as The Innocents, The Trials of Oscar Wilde or Billy Budd will also do good business as well as please the critics: but the border between success and failure is surprisingly slender.\n\nRealistic dramas like The Pot Carriers, The Criminal or The Kitchen should on paper have done well. A lot depends on publicity, posters and ‘notoriety’ (though even more on the director’s ability to face reality foursquarely- these three were set in claustrophobic surroundings, cut off from the world the audience knows best). But it is interesting to note that the down-to-earth films are not only box-office heavyweights in this country; they are also highly regarded by Continental critics. Intellectual interest in France has been roused by the making of Sparrows Can’t Sing, This Sporting Life, Billy Liar and others. British ‘ neo-realism’ may prove to be as influential as its Italian forebear. A Kind of Loving significantly won the top prize at the Berlin festival – the first time for years that a British film has been officially crowned in Europe.\n\nPrior to Room at the Top British films, in John Schlesinger’s words, provided nothing but a ‘formularised escapism’ for the audience, much as the ‘white telephone’ series of films did in Fascist Italy during the ‘thirties. The neo-realist work of our more talented directors has pointed to acute observation on their part, and the men who are going to be the ‘faces of 1963’ are those who shoot their films not necessarily in grimy streets but with a sense of what life is really like throughout Britain- whether it be among the lower or the higher classes-and of the social and economic conditions out of which the neorealist movement (as in Italy) arose.\n\nWho are the figures behind this British neo-realist movement, who have created it, fostered it, and sometimes grown rich from it, without losing the tough honesty that made them successful at the start? Tony Richardson, Bryan Forbes, John Schlesinger, Val Guest, Lindsay Anderson: all these give the impression of single-mindedness, some even write as well as direct their films (a comparatively rare habit in the British industry).\n\nWhy do they succeed where others can so easily fail? Primarily because they have the ability to catch the contemporary idiom in their dialogue, to present sex and the sordid in just the right proportions, to pile shock after shock onto conventional standards as their films progress. The theme of Look Back in Anger epitomises this attitude. Old, accepted dicta and views are being ridiculed by the young, who in their turn have no definite aims -only to live fiercely and without regard for others. Thus the directors who have won fame in this field hold forthright views themselves, and have realised, among other factors, that television has set a standard of realism rarely found in British films before 1958. TV has thrown up the odd director of interest, too, such as John Schlesinger or Denis Mitchell.\n\nAfter working with BBC’s ‘Monitor’ and ‘Panorama’ programmes, Mitchell is making a documentary with his own unit on the filming of The Victors, in Southern Italy and at Shepperton.\n\nYet the producer is often as important. From the start, he places his confidence and his financial hopes in the hands of the creators. Already there is brightness in the gloom that made John Osborne and Tony Richardson comment three years ago, ‘Very few people can be persuaded to make uncompromising films on small budgets’. James Woolf (who produced Room at the Top and The L-Shaped Room) is one of the more courageous.\n\nAnd Joseph Janni, who arrived with an expert knowledge of Italian films, produced A Kind of Loving and Billy Liar in quick succession. Karel Reisz, having done so well with his first feature Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, has now produced This Sporting Life, giving Lindsay Anderson his first chance to direct a feature. And Richard Attenborough teamed up with Bryan Forbes to form Beaver, the company that made The Angry Silence and Whistle Down the Wind. Companies like Bryanston and Allied Filmmakers on a larger, and Woodfall and Eyeline (The Impersonator, Girl on Approval, Lunch-Hour) on a smaller scale, have helped to alleviate the former problems of finance and distribution. They are allowing men whose outrageous views offended the hidebound bourgeois attitudes of production companies to put their anger on the screen.\n\nA number of talented men ignore the vogue for realistic films. Carl Foreman continues to explore, in The Victors, the well-mined war vein as a means of conveying to the public his serious views on human conflict. Alexander MacKendrick, forgotten like so many of the Ealing comedy directors, still managed to produce a film of impact and economy in Sweet Smell of Success (albeit in Hollywood).\n\nFive years later, his recently completed Sam- my Going South, a Michael Balcon production starring Edward G Robinson, promises to make him a famous name again. Paul Rotha showed himself very much on form with The Life of Adolf Hitler, and his Resistance, made in Holland, could be one of 1963’s surprises.\n\nRobert Day alternates skilfully between horror (Corridors of Blood) and comedy (The Rebel) and may suddenly burst into the front rank of British directors if he finds the right subject.\n\nKen Hughes followed a string of Americanised thrillers, culminating in the mediocre The Long Haul, with the superb Trials of Oscar Wilde and his new film, The Small World of Sammy Lee, is one of the bright British hopes for 1963.\n\nPeter Glenville has also been a director of spasmodic quality (promising with The Prisoner, disappointing with Summer and Smoke). After his success with Term of Trial, he is now transcribing Anouilh’s Becket, which he will direct this year with Richard Burton and Peter O’Toole.\n\nClive Donner, too, has shown a lot of promise with Some People, and is now shooting The Caretaker (from Pinter’s play), to be followed by Nothing But The Best. Another name to remember is Peter Yates, who worked as assistant to Tony Richardson for some time, lately on A Taste of Honey. He has now done location work in Austria for the Wessex production of Legacy of a Spy, and intends to make a film for Woodfall during the year.\n\nPhilip Leacock, back from Hollywood after an unsuccessful visit (Let No Man Write My Epitaph was typical), has done sufficient with Reach for Glory to be recognised as a considerable talent. His version of The War Lover, shot in England, is awaiting release, and he has just completed Tamahine.\n\nPeter Brook, the accomplished stage director, gave a lesson in visual imagination and poetic style with Moderato Cantabile, made in France and a near-masterpiece. He has followed it with Lord of the Flies, shot in Puerto Rico on a tiny budget, and edited by Brook in Paris. One hopes to see it in Britain during 1963. Certainly Moderato had the sophistication and elegance that are normally associated with the best French and Italian productions.\n\nJoseph Losey is another outcast, first from America and then from Britain. His early work (Time Without Pity, The Prowler) was sufficiently tough and disturbing to spark off a new kind of cult criticism in France. Blind Date and The Criminal have proved him worthy of this attention, and Eva, his latest co-production made in Venice, even more so, however unfaithful it is to James Hadley Chase’s original novel. The Damned, the last film he shot in Britain, is still awaiting release by Hammer. Both these films could make Losey a bigger figure in British cinema during 1963.\n\nThese are the type of directors who by their work affirm Walter Lassally’s admirable dictum: ‘In the long run it is ideas rather than gimmicks that are needed’. Most of these directors, too, are striving bravely- within the restrictions of the film industry- to say something rather than throwing any type of personal expression overboard to please the box-office. Their films bear the individual stamp of their makers. The older generation of directors in Britain’s Studios today are intent on ripping through their film in budget time. They virtually ignore the camera on set, and concentrate too much on acting. Until the last few years, the British cinema was composed of a number of stock faces\n\nDirk Bogarde in ‘The Mind-Benders’ (illustrated), a study of scientific brainwashing. Bogarde. born in 1921 , has been in theatre since before the war. His part in ‘The Blue Lamp’ (1949) made his name, and he has played in a steady stream of successes since: The ‘Doctor’ series, ‘The Spanish Gardener’, ‘Ill Mel by Moonlight’ , ‘The Doctor’s Dilemma’, ‘Victim’ and the forthcoming ‘The Lonely Stage’\n\nthat could be guaranteed to pull in the crowds – Kenneth More, Alastair Sim, Margaret Lockwood, John Mills, Dirk Bogarde, Virginia McKenna. Some of these remain stars to be reckoned with, but with the crop of neorealist films has come a succession of new actors and actresses, their reputations made overnight with a single triumph-Laurence Harvey in Room at the Top (even though he had been making films for years), Shirley Anne Field in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Edward Judd in The Day the Earth Caught Fire, Hayley Mills in Tiger Bay, Alan Bates and June Ritchie in A Kind of Loving, Rita Tushingham in A Taste of Honey and so on.\n\nWith this trend has come a gradual alteration in the image of a star engendered in the public’s mind. The men must be tough, outspoken, often untidy-Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay, Michael Craig, Tom Bell and Edward Judd all measure up perfectly to these new criteria. Terence Stamp in Billy Budd of course is proof of the audience’s willingness to accept still a living expression of innocence, while Murray Melvin (A Taste of Honey, Sparrows Can’t Sing) scores as an actor by his restraint and sincerity rather than by any exhibition of strength.\n\nRachel Roberts, excellent in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, has played the main role in Tony Perry’s production of Girl on Approval and, along with June Ritchie, Shirley Anne Field, Samantha Eggar, and Catherine Woodville (who has played in a trio of neorealist films, The Wild and the Willing, The Party’s Over, and The Snout) seem likely to be the more important female faces of 1963.\n\nBut the older generation is undoubtedly still full of stars and acting ability. Dennis Price and Peter Finch are typical of this school, and Dirk Bogarde and Peter Sellers will definitely keep their places at the top of the financial tree for at least the whole of 1963. Stanley Baker, too, as well as starring in Joseph Losey’s cosmopolitan Eva, Aldrich’s Sodom and Gomorrah, and Cliff Owen’s A Prize of Arms, has turned to production himself, with The Man Who Finally Died and Zulu.\n\nClaire Bloom improves with each performance and her role opposite Julie Harris in The Haunting may make her an international star; the same applies to Leslie Caron, who was able in to show her serious acting capabilities for the first time since Gaby.\n\nTrevor Howard, after the excesses of Mutiny on the Bounty, should remain one of Britain’s finest screen actors next to Laurence Olivier and Alec Guinness, while Peter O’Toole’s rather uneasy reputation has been strengthened once and for all by Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nMichael Redgrave has been less fortunate in his choice of roles (the Uncle in The Innocents, the Governor in The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner) but has the class and versatility to take some of the hardest parts.\n\nAn aspect of cinema in which Britain has usually lagged behind is the actual technique of cinematography. If British films are to keep pace with Continental virtuosity in 1963 they must be made by outstanding technicians. Among the most promising of our lighting cameramen is Dave Boulton, and Freddie Francis, Denys Coop (Billy Liar) and Chris Challis (The Victors) are the equal of most European photographers. Britain has still not reached the stage, however, when a cameraman (Henri Decae and Raoul Coutard in France for example) can influence and even classify a film. Robert Krasher and Jack Cardiff were our two best men at one time, but both need a good director to guide them, once again the prominent men in this field are those who can cope with their director’s need for realism- for grey tones, sharp prehensile images-rather than those who rely on elaborate composition within the frame.\n\nNor has Britain reached the stage when a writer can really set his mark on a production as well as the director- or, more important, help to sell a film- as can Paddy Chayefsky in America, Marguerite Duras in France, Ulla Jsaksson in Sweden. Willis Hall and Keith Waterhouse, and Ted Willis, usually produce scripts of intelligence and terseness, but they tend to repeat the same arguments. Alun Owen’s theatrical experience has proved invaluable in shaping his dialogue for the screen (The Criminal). Eric Ambler, Carl Foreman, and Bryan Forbes are established professionals as is the more flamboyant Wolf Mankowitz (Never Take No for an Answer, The Day the Earth Caught Fire and currently scripting Life at the Top for James Woolf). John Osborne remains, probably, our one outspoken writer of spasmodic genius, and his adaptation of Fielding’s Tom Jones, which was produced and directed by Tony Richardson, will be a severe test of his capabilities and of his respect for a literary masterpiece. Certainly Osborne has outlived his notoriety. One can see clearly now that it was he who made the decisive breakthrough- with Look Back in Anger. And to this extent the British cinema is indebted to the theatre for its abrupt change of attitude.\n\nOsborne’s lack of real progress since his early work, though, also points a moral that budding script writers would do well to heed that good scenarios will only come from those who continually live among and know the milieux about which they write. High flown dialogue will not pass muster any more in the cinema – even Ingmar Bergman’s scripts are models of concision. Professionals behind the scenes are men like Jack Pulman, Australian born Peter Yeldham, Nigel Kneale, and Leigh Vance. They rarely get big credits and one hopes that 1963 will mark a progression towards the time when writers are billed as prominently as directors (and as well paid).\n\nAll in all, 1963 will be as much a testing time for established directors and actors as it will be a time of triumph for the younger talents.\n\nOnly the box-office will tell when the neorealist films that have thrown up so many new faces are beginning to pall on the public. Anyone with original ideas at that juncture will be assured a prominent position indeed."
