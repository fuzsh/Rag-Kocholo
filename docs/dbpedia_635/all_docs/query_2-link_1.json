He also received a BAFTA Fellowship in 2005 for his outstanding contribution to film.\n\nPhilosophical Contributions and Beliefs\n\nForbes was known for his humanitarian approach to filmmaking, often exploring themes of social justice, morality, and the human condition. He believed that films should challenge audiences and provoke thought, rather than simply entertain.\n\nPersonal Milestones and Key Life Events\n\nForbes married actress Nanette Newman in 1955, with whom he had two daughters, Sarah and Emma. He passed away on May 8, 2013, at the age of 86, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most important figures in the British film industry.\n\nLegacy and Impact on Modern Society\n\nForbes' contributions to British cinema have been immense, inspiring generations of filmmakers and writers. His films continue to be celebrated for their thought-provoking themes, complex characters, and masterful storytelling. He will be remembered as a true Renaissance man of the British film industry."
