        "text": "Prep for my series of pitches for INTO THE FOREST at the upcoming London Screenwriters festival is at an advanced stage! I have a clear objective, which, before I started studying the 'art' of pitching in earnest I would have said was obvious; \"to get my film made!\" My goal is far more focussed than that. I am ready to build relationships and partnerships to get this project I believe in with complete conviction off the ground. To do that I need to demonstrate the film's marketability. I write stories in order to get bums on seats. Thus I have a clear understanding of my target audience, it's budget and how to exploit the proprietorial elements in the story. What's left- and this is the tricky part- is condensing the 100 minute screenplay into 3 highly targeted minutes to completely draw in my audience!\n\nThis week marks a significant moment in entertainment history as the Writers Guild of America unveiled a new tentative three year deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. Although the agreed upon terms are not published, the guild has already stated that “meaningful gains and protections for writers in every sector of the membership” have been achieved. With the upcoming 2023 film slate already shaken up, investors are now looking for movement on the SAG-AFTRA negotiations to restore the Hollywood ecosystem. With the impending start of talk shows and late-night comedy, studios and financiers are hoping to finalize both agreements before the fourth calendar quarter to prevent a meaningful disruption to the 2024 output. Some production companies were able to benefit from reducing their cash content spending, but the stabilization of the industry will provide a significant increase in labor across multiple sets. Even without the actors returning yet, the increase of television programming, and the work aligned with it, comes as a sigh of relief for many sets. As for the box office, most of the stagnant projects slated for 2024 and 2025 will take time to return back to production, but both theater goers and studio producers can expect industry stabilization in the near future, barring any setbacks with the Screen Actors Guild negotiations. As the Hollywood strikes near their conclusions, the industry as a whole remains optimistic for limited future disruption in terms of content produced and anticipated distribution. Esquire Group Inc. https://lnkd.in/gpXbtp9P\n\nAfter reading the news on SAG-AFTRA negotiations and trying to see where we all are headed, could it be the renaissance of the indie industry? What are your thoughts? SAG has been giving waivers to many indie productions, and we, independent producers and filmmakers, understand the struggle and respect the industry professionals. So, could it be just a perfect moment for us to create more amazing content? What do you think will be the next for the industry?\n\nSo, you’ve written a chase scene into your script. There’s running, there’s near-misses, but it feels a bit flat. Whether or not you write to music, it can sometimes help to work out the pacing and levels in your scenes. To help, I’ve put together a playlist of 15 tracks that I think would go great accompanying chase scenes of different types. There’s spies, pandas, video games, and more. https://wix.to/34qSMBn #newblogpost #screenwriting #creativewriting #soundtrack\n\nTo me, the feeling you get from #goodfilm editing is the same feeling a child gets when you pull a coin from behind their ear, or make something disappear before their very eyes. You feel the wonder first and then you question: how was it done? And then, if you’re really curious, you go about deconstructing it. https://lnkd.in/dT3upXjs\n\nTo me, the feeling you get from #goodfilm editing is the same feeling a child gets when you pull a coin from behind their ear, or make something disappear before their very eyes.
