        "text": "Director Bryan Forbes tries his hand at comedy. His nostalgic Victorian farce features an eclectic choice of Brit stars — established greats John Mills & Ralph Richardson, the freshly-minted Michael Caine, reigning jester Peter Sellers and even a debut for the collegiate pranksters Peter Cook & Dudley Moore. It’s a beaut of a production with a charming John Barry music score… but the result yields more indulgent smiles than out-and-out laughs.\n\nThe Wrong Box\n\nRegion A+B Blu-ray\n\nPowerhouse Indicator\n\n1966 / Color / 1:75 widescreen / 105 min. / Street Date November 23, 2018 / available from Amazon UK / £14.99\n\nStarring: John Mills, Ralph Richardson, Michael Caine, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Nanette Newman, Tony Hancock, Peter Sellers, Wilfrid Lawson, Thorley Walters, Gerald Sim, Irene Handl, Norman Bird, John Le Mesurier, Norman Rossington, Diane Clare, Tutte Lemkow, Charles Bird, Vanda Godsell, Jeremy Lloyd, James Villiers, Graham Stark, Dick Gregory, Valentine Dyall, Leonard Rossiter, André Morell, Temperance Seven, Andrea Allan, Juliet Mills.\n\nCinematography:...\n\nDoug Nichol's California Typewriter brilliantly captures the percussion of the keys at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas Photo: Anne-Katrin Titze\n\nAntiquarian typewriter collector Martin Howard over brunch in the garden of Narcissa, next door to the Standard Hotel, joined me for a conversation on California Typewriter, Doug Nichol's documentary featuring Tom Hanks, John Mayer, Jeremy Mayer, Pulitzer Prize winners David McCullough and Sam Shepard, and a reenactment of Ed Ruscha and Mason Williams' Royal Road Test execution.

Our ongoing series continues as we look at a comedy about the devil. Maybe that’s not quite the holiday spirit but we’re doing it anyway. This week, Cinelinx looks at Harold Ramis’ Bedazzled (2000).\n\nSometimes, it’s the chemistry between the lead actors that makes or breaks a film. When two actors just click, it lifts a film to a whole new level. It’s this on-screen cohesion (or lack thereof) that makes the difference between the two versions of Bedazzled.\n\nThe original version was made in England in 1967 and the remake in America in 2000. Both versions of the film follow a similar pot. Each one focuses on an unhappy man--named Stanley (Dudley Moore) in the original and Elliot (Brendan Fraser) in the remake—who is pining for a woman who doesn’t know he’s alive. Stanley/Elliot is approached by...\n\nBy Lee Pfeiffer\n\nAlthough he was regarded as a comedy genius, the sad truth is that Peter Sellers was more often than not misused in big screen comedies. After making it big on British TV and in feature films in the late 1950s, Sellers became an international sensation with his acclaimed work in big studio feature films such as \"Lolita\", \"Dr. Strangelove\", \"The World of Henry Orient\" and the first entries in the \"Pink Panther\" series. Through the mid-Sixties, he did impressive work in films like \"After the Fox\", \"The Wrong Box\" and \"What's New Pussycat?\" If the films weren't classics, at least they presented some of Sellers' off-the-wall ability to deliver innovative characters and comedic situations. By the late Sixties, however, his own personal demons began to get the better of him. Sellers was the epitome of the classic clown: laughing on the outside but crying on the inside.\n\nThere was a time when I could repeat verbatim dozens of lines from \"The Wrong Box,\" Bryan Forbes’ delightfully daft dark comedy about the madcap scramble for an immense inheritance by Victorians both proper and otherwise. It helped, of course, that the movie – filled with such deft farceurs as Michael Caine, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Ralph Richardson, John Mills and Peter Sellers – also was an all-time favorite of my mentor, the late Ralph Thomas Bell, former chairman of the journalism department at Loyola University in New Orleans. During my college years, and for several years afterwards, we often would greet each other with snippets of the 1966 comedy’s droll dialogue, more or less in the fashion of latter-day Monty Python fanatics exchanging quips about dead parrots and killer rabbits. Indeed, whenever we got together as our friendship endured long after my graduation, there was a scarcely a time when one...\n\nBryan Forbes, who personified the golden age of British cinema in the post-wwii era, has died at age 86. Forbes started out as an actor before morphing into a screenwriter and esteemed director. He teamed with Richard Attenborough to form a film production company. Among their films was The Angry Silence, an acclaimed 1960 movie in which both men starred. It dealt squarely with England's omnipresent tensions between business leaders and union members. Forbes co-wrote the screenplay and produced the movie. His high profile films as director include such British classics as Whistle Down the Wind, Seance on a Wet Afternoon, The Wrong Box, The Whisperers, King Rat, Deadfall, The Slipper and the Rose, The L-Shaped Room, International Velvet as well as the hit 1975 Hollywood horror flick The Stepford Wives. Forbes also wrote or co-wrote the screenplays for some of these films as well as the comedy classic The League of Gentlemen and director Attenborough's Chaplin.\n\nEver wonder what a night on the town looks like for The Inbetweeners? We have an exclusive glimpse at next Monday’s installment of MTV’s new comedy (airing at 10:30/9:30c) that answers that exact question.\n\nIn the episode, titled “The Wrong Box,” the geek-adjacent guys decide to go clubbing. Jay, per uje, has the situation down pat — he’s even doling out his definition of “Club Code” to the gang at random. But it’s Will’s reaction to the festivities that really sums up the evening: “This is it,” he says upon entering the pretty average looking party,...\n\nSony Pictures is opening up its vaults and throwing its hat into the Manufacturing on Demand initiative in which obscure classics get long overdue made-to-order home video releases, and one of the first titles out is the classic strange comedy Neighbors!\n\nFrom the Press Release\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment (Sphe) debuts the newly remastered Neighbors (1981) on DVD as part of its “Columbia Classics” lineup. The comedy reteamed Dan Aykroyd (Ghostbusters) and John Belushi (Animal House) after their triumphs on “Saturday Night Live” and the hit film The Blues Brothers. A quiet man’s peaceful suburban lifestyle is threatened by the new, obnoxious couple that moves in next door. Consumers can purchase the authentic, high-quality DVD on Amazon, Warner Archive or Critics’ Choice Video. Neighbors will retail for $20.95 Slp, plus shipping.\n\nSynopsis\n\nEarl Keese (John Belushi, Animal House) is a slightly overweight, fairly average guy who is approaching middle age. He...\n\nBleeding Cool have got their naughty hands on scripts for MTV’s U.S. remake of The Inbetweeners, the successful UK sitcom that revolves around A-level students Simon, Jay, Will and Joe as they struggle on the verge of manhood and to get laid, basically. It’s not unlike a UK version of American Pie and after three highly popular seasons on E4, the Brit show hits the big screen in the UK next week with a movie version that takes our beloved characters to Magaluf!\n\nHaving seen the similar themed teen Brit show Skins adopted for U.S. television recently only to bomb and be cancelled after poor ratings, how does MTV’s remake of The Inbetweeners stand-up, on paper at least?\n\nHere’s a few bullet points from BC’s review;\n\nUnlike many U.S. remakes of UK shows, the characters and their names remain authentic with Simon,...\n\nJohn Barry's soundtracks often outstripped the films for which they were written. And despite a prickly reputation, when I met him he was the perfect host\n\nWhile it would be a little outlandish to say that John Barry lived a James Bond lifestyle, it wasn't hard to imagine him in the world of The Persuaders, driving an open-top E-type to the south of France, immaculately turned out, eloping with the au pair. He was, more than many familiar faces, a movie star.\n\nThe theme from The Persuaders was – ignoring the James Bond theme, which existed like air – my introduction to the John Barry sound. The opening notes of its electric harpsichord matched high-contrast screen images of Tony Curtis and Roger Moore and created great excitement. It was the soundtrack to many Sunday lunchtimes in the early-70s.\n\nTheme from the Persuaders on the CBS label was one of the first records I owned,...\n\nWhen I was in high school, I saw Hannah and Her Sisters and had such a crush on Michael Caine. That was my gateway drug to Caine movies, and led me to Sleuth and The Wrong Box and Mona Lisa and a lot of bad movies I hate to mention (The Swarm, sadly, and Sweet Liberty). So I experienced a moment of shock in the first scene with Caine in Harry Brown, when he shuffled out of bed and looked surprisingly like my grandfather. That's what having crushes on older men in films gets you. I don't even want to talk about Harrison Ford in the last Indiana Jones movie.\n\nAfter recoving from my little moment of shock and mortality, I found Harry Brown an absorbing combination of melodrama and vigilantism. Caine plays the title character, who as he is growing older finds himself increasingly alone in the world. His...\n\nOur friends over at Queen Elizabeth’s Foundation have just given us the details for a very exciting evening which will not only allow you to spend an evening at the world famous Pinewood Studios, but the black-tie charity event will also give you access to meeting some of the ‘legends’ that have worked at the studio.\n\nThis one-off event will take place on Saturday, 5th December and the legends will include:\n\nRoy Button OBE (Senior Vice President & MD of Warner Bros.)

He was 81.\n\nGelbart, the principal writer on \"M*A*S*H\" during the first four years of the hit CBS series, was responsible for 97 episodes of the show, one of TV's most literate comedies. He also directed some early episodes.\n\nBeginning as a gag writer in days of radio and honing his comic craft for such talents as Jack Carson and Bob Hope, Gelbart was a versatile stylist who succeeded in a variety of mediums.\n\nGelbart won an Emmy with co-producer Gene Reynolds for \"M*A*S*H\" as well as three WGA Awards for the episodes he wrote. He picked up two Tonys for..."
