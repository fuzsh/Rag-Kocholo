        "text": "TopBilled:\n\nIt is no secret that both Jlewis and myself are fans of Hayley Mills. The first film of hers we reviewed was TIGER BAY (1959) which shares more than a few similarities with our first selection this month…\n\nWHISTLE DOWN THE WIND is based on a novella written by Hayley’s mother, Mary Hayley Bell, that was begun in 1957. This would have been a year before Hayley and John worked on TIGER BAY, but I do think Noel Calef’s story for TIGER BAY inspired Mary Hayley Bell who likely made revisions to her novella while her daughter and husband were working on TIGER BAY. The story also seems to owe a debt to HUNTED, in which an impressionable lad (Jon Whiteley) gets involved with a crook (Dirk Bogarde).\n\nIn WHISTLE DOWN THE WIND, Hayley Mills is a pre-adolescent girl crossing paths with a criminal. TIGER BAY presents the criminal as a German man on the run, played by Horst Buchholz, whom Hayley’s character idolizes and even develops a crush on, while helping him flee police. Whereas WHISTLE DOWN THE WIND presents the criminal as a local British man (Alan Bates in his first major film role), whom young Hayley and a host of other children think is Jesus. They help shelter him from the local authorities.\n\nWHISTLE DOWN THE WIND takes place mostly on a farm in a remote rural area, unlike the urban setting of TIGER BAY. Additionally, it has more spiritual undercurrents than TIGER BAY, though I wouldn’t say it’s an outright Christian film.\n\nIn some ways, it is a critical look at the innocence of children juxtaposed with the corruption of adults. Yes, the kids are a little too wholesome and naive, and their faith may at times seem laughable, but they are still very sincere. This sincerity makes them likable, and we root for them to get through to the adults that maybe their Christ-like friend is not as wrong as others might believe.\n\nI find it interesting that for the most part, Bates’ character is just referred to as The Man. When police finally nab him, he’s called Blakey, though I think in the novella, he’s called Blake. But for all intents and purposes, he is just a man, any ordinary man, who faces condemnation and suffering. We could read into this what sort of justice he will receive at the hands of adults who certainly won’t be as kind to him as the children. Related to this is an inordinate amount of paranoia and fear that grips the local community, since the man is considered dangerous by some…even if the children don’t know that side of him.\n\nAt the heart of the story, of course, is the poignant relationship that develops between Hayley’s character and Bates, similar to the relationship her character had with Buchholz in the previous film. In both cases, we know the man is doomed. He will be arrested and hauled off. The arrest scene in WHISTLE DOWN THE WIND is played as a crucifixion with Bates’ arms and hands outstretched as to suggest Christ on the cross.\n\nWhile I think some of the parallels to Christian religion are a bit overdone, and the film is loaded with almost too much symbolism, it still retains a simple quality. And I feel this simple quality of children seeing the good in a fairly hopeless situation, is probably what makes it so appealing to youngsters in the audience.\n\nOf course there is one traitor in the bunch, a boy who helps lead the police to Bates, which also has religious implications, since that part is meant to represent Jesus’ betrayal by Judas.\n\nThe film did well at the British box office, and it was nominated for a BAFTA for best picture that year. Hayley was also nominated for a BAFTA for her performance. This would be the first of many successful British pictures with social themes directed by former actor Bryan Forbes and co-produced by Richard Attenborough. Initially, Mary Hayley Bell and her husband John Mills did not want Forbes to direct WHISTLE DOWN THE WIND, and I have not be able to determine the reason for their initial reluctance to hire Forbes. But Attenborough eventually convinced them that Forbes would be right as The Man behind the camera.\n\n***\n\nJlewis:\n\nThe great Hayley Mills appeared in this black and white British indy for Beaver Films (with a beaver portrait!) and Allied Film Makers in 1961, after appearing in two popular Disney features (THE PARENT TRAP being a huge hit). She was nominated for a BAFTA, no doubt with her previous successes aiding her among the critical establishment. Most fascinating is the fact that her own mother, Mary Hayley Bell Mills, had written the novel from which it was adapted by screenwriters Willis Hall and Keith Waterhouse.\n\nGreat care went into this very special children’s film with Richard Attenborough operating as a producer and Bryan Forbes, who later covered THE STEPFORD WIVES in the United States, directing after Attenborough decided to step back and give the innovative recruit a chance. It also marked the cinematic debut of Alan Bates, another familiar face in many sixties and seventies films made on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nIn muddy North Lancashire farm country, Kathy Bostock (Hayley) and her sister Nan (Diane Holgate) and most talkative brother Charles (Alan Barnes) rescue drowning kittens and try to hide them in a neighboring barn from their we-can’t-feed-anymore father (Bernard Lee) and aunt Dorothy (Else Wagstaff). One trip there at night reveals a semi-conscious, injured convict named Albert Blakey (Alan Bates) whom Kathy thinks is Jesus Christ.\n\nWhy? Well…children do have such creative and imaginative minds.\n\nAlbert doesn’t understand all of this but goes along with it since he is on the loose avoiding the authorities. He also tolerates the trio (three children who are musically scored by Malcolm Arnold around a “We Three Kings” melody) bringing their juvenile friends as long as “the grown ups” don’t know about his existence. After all, he might get crucified!\n\nLittle Charles begins questioning if this Jesus is real since his kitten dies unexpectedly and Albert doesn’t save him. “He has to let some die, I suppose” is his big sister’s response. Both seek answers, without revealing that they are hiding Albert, with the local vicar (Hamilton Dyce) eating lunch at a cafe. He tells Kathy, in regards to humans if not non-human animals, that “babies are being born all of the time. Those of us who were here already have to make room for them, haven’t we?”\n\nIt is right after their revelation that a camera pans on an officer putting up a street poster for Albert Blakey stating that he is wanted for murder. This is pretty thought-provoking material about religion and how it is taught to impressionable minds. Certainly not the kind of kids entertainment made today, which is a shame.\n\nIt is important to give children all kinds of perspectives on life. I am reminded how often political figures are described by far-right preachers as “chosen by God to lead” due to their enormous success in influencing huge crowds and the media. Kathy and her friends believe Albert is Jesus, but they are children who have experienced little by way of adventure in their confined rural community.\n\nHumorously, Albert asks Kathy at one point if she brought any “snuff” and Kathy replies that she did not know Jesus smoked. Yet she figures she might as well go get some. One endearing message is that children always do good things when they feel committed to a higher calling regardless of “where” they think Jesus or God is.\n\nWhen Albert is taken away by the authorities, the children see his arms stretched out as if on a cross. Kathy promises other children who missed Jesus that “he will come again.” It is interesting to note that actor Alan Bates later starred in THE KING OF HEARTS in which he is, again, treated as some kind of quasi-religious subject by innocents. Likewise, Hayley Mills played a similar girl infatuated and helpful of a criminal man in her earlier pre-Disney success, TIGER BAY."
