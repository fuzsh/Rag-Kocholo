        "text": "The SNES/Super Fami versions look nice - but those colors are not it lol.\n\nGrey and purple, or grey and RGBY - only thing they got right was the font. ðŸ‘Ÿ\n\nIt's like they referenced a yellowed SNES and thought that's how they all looked back during the rivalry. I totally agree the colors are wrong, should've had purple accents and no \"yellowing\" color.\n\nEdit: okay I read more closely and see they mention sun damaged. But still not a fan even when that's on purpose. Would've been slightly more interesting if it had similar chemical that would yellow over time, but most people don't feel nostalgic about the sun damage aspect since that usually took many years later.\n\nIf they did a Nintendo version where the stripes and one other part were the four colours of Japan/Europe SNES, I think that would be very cool. And the stripes should have had the purple accent for the US variation too.\n\nHow hard would it have been to do something like this:\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/xjgjXQZv/Purple-Gray.png\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/pVgvhdZn/RGYBGray.png\n\n@VGScrapbook And my SNES never got even remotely yellow in the two decades or so I owned it. So I 100% do not have nostalgia for those horrible yellowed models. I think they look terrible. And I don't think a well designed trainer that's meant to represent the SNES should be using the yellowed colour either; that's just a bad design choice.\n\nI feel like more than the Genesis version, whomever the designer was, they completely half-assed and flubbed the SNES design. I mocked up a much better representation in a matter of minutes. I should be getting paid whatever that random got paid.\n\n@VGScrapbook Gulikit has a controller that is the same color as a yellowed Game Boy, but there is no mention of yellowing or sun damage in their marketing. I am guessing they just brought in some young designer and told him to make a theme to cash in on nostalgia. Junk they keep unloading on the west and people keep buying it.\n\n@combywomby Exactly. Even myself, deeply knowledgable of the niche.. if I saw those shoes in public, I wouldn't notice. If I saw them up close, my first reaction would be \"Ha, I wonder if Adidas knows how close they are to stealing Nintendo's SNES font?\". With that design, the furthest thing from my mind is that is intentionally representing the SNES."
