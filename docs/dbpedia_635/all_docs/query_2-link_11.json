        "text": "While at a conference a few months ago, I ate lunch in the hotel restaurant. When the bill came, I decided to sign for it instead of paying it immediately. As I signed, I was struck by a sense of nostalgia. It was the first time in years I’d signed for a purchase, as I’ve been tapping my cards, or at least swiping them, these days.\n\nIt got me thinking about writing, both by physically putting pen to paper and also how we text or type. It doesn’t stop at the act of writing; even reading the written word is different today. Instead of reading a book or newspaper article, we can listen to an audiobook or podcast.\n\nAnd there’s nothing wrong with that. But I wonder if our reliance on technology is impacting our personal and professional lives in ways we’re not even aware of. Does writing still matter in today’s tech-driven world?\n\nYour writing can affect your job prospects.\n\nWould you hire someone with typos and grammar mistakes in their resume? What about their LinkedIn profile? Some hiring managers would never hire someone who had typos or grammar mistakes because proper grammar is a sign of professionalism, attention to detail and learning ability.\n\nGrammarly did a survey of LinkedIn profiles of native English language speakers a few years ago and found that people with fewer errors in their profiles earned higher positions and got more promotions. They also changed jobs more frequently, possibly because they were more ambitious, but likely also because they reviewed their resumes more regularly and caught any errors.\n\nBut should a typo disqualify you from a job? That question always generates a lot of debate online. In my opinion, typos should only affect jobs that require high levels of detail, such as scientists, copy editors, QA analysts, etc. What matters more is being responsive to errors and knowing how and when to revise your writing. That’s a better test of someone’s attention to detail than a perfect resume. After all, the candidate may have just paid someone to write the resume for them.\n\nGood writing is a sign of good leadership.\n\nThe former CEO of Yahoo famously ignored capital letters in his emails. The Wall Street Journal found the “epidemic of grammar gaffes” in the workplace to be so rampant that it created a quiz to test people’s grammar skills. However, is it bad for leaders to write poorly in the workplace?\n\nLike with many grammar questions, it depends, but most people would say that business leaders should write properly. The written word can be a powerful tool for leaders, encouraging and affecting employees deeply.\n\nWe can forgive the misuse of “you and I” instead of “you and me,” but basic errors and strange formatting can distract from the message and confuse readers who may then make incorrect assumptions or decisions. It can also reduce the chances people will read the message because they think it won’t be useful.\n\nWriting can strengthen relationships.\n\nWriting has a way of creating and developing relationships between people. That applies to the handwritten thank-you note from your boss and the email marketing message you got from a retailer. A personalized message has the power to make other people feel recognized and valued, which can make them more productive.\n\nI know I loved getting these notes from bosses and managers in the past — even more so when they were handwritten! Sending a customized note in a business context can deepen relationships with clients and improve their loyalty, helping businesses sustain conversion rates and revenues.\n\nWriting is good for the mind and body.\n\nHollywood screenwriter and Billions showrunner Brian Koppelman writes three pages every morning, without fail, as described in Julia Cameron’s The Artist’s Way. He uses it to access his “most creative place” because it allows him the freedom to write without censoring or rereading. The act of putting pen to paper helps him to ease his doubts, quiet his inner critic and get into the writing flow.\n\nAside from the creative benefit of writing, scientists have found it can improve your memory and aid in learning. It can slow down mental aging because it forces people to use more motor skills and engage different parts of the brain. Handwriting researchers have also found that writing by hand can have a calming effect on the brain and reduce stress and anxiety.\n\nEven as technology creeps into all areas of our lives, the written word still lives. It’s a basic form of communication that will always be used, no matter if we write by hand or use technology. Writing will continue to impact all areas of our lives, both at home and at work."
