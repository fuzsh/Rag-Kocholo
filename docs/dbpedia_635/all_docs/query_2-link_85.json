        "meta_description": "This chapter provides brief details of some of the projects on which Jack Clayton was involved but which for various reasons either never materialised on screen or were made by someone else. The projects include A Child is Waiting; The Looking-Glass War; Sweet Autumn; The Walking Stick; Mary, Queen of Scots; Zaharoff Pedlar of Death; The Tenant; lf You Could See Me Now; The Main; Revelations; Hand-Me Downs; The Bourne Identity and We Have Always Lived in the Castle. The list also includes One Last Glimpse; The Enchantment; Hannah; The Last Enemy; Cold Spring Harbour; The Stone Virgin; Augustus; Poe (The Dark Angel); The Cherry Orchard; Revolutionary Road; Hay Fever; Casualties of War; Massacre at Fall Creek and Silence. The chapter also reveals a lot about Clayton and perhaps even more about the industry in which he worked throughout his adult life.",
