After training as an international human-rights lawyer in Australia, Anna moved to Germany and published \"Stasiland: Stories from Behind the Berlin Wall\" in 2003; the book won the Samuel Johnson Prize (now known as the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction). Her debut novel, \"All That I Am\", followed in 2011. It fictionalised the true story of a group of friends who fled the Nazi regime for London in the early 1930s. The novel won the Miles Franklin Prize, Australia's most prestigious fiction award, and has been published in more than 25 languages. Her latest book, \"Wifedom: Mrs Orwell's Invisible Life\" (2023), is a biography of Eileen O’Shaughnessy, George Orwell's first wife, and combines original research with fictional reconstructions. It was longlisted for the inaugural Women's Prize for Non-Fiction. We spoke to Anna about moving from the law to writing, investigating the secret police of East Germany in \"Stasiland\", and \"Wifedom\".\n\n“Always Take Notes: Advice From Some Of The World’s Greatest Writers” - a book drawing on our podcast interviews - is published by Ithaka Press.

Toby has worked in the publishing industry for more than three decades. After starting his career at HarperCollins he founded Atlantic Books in 2000. During his tenure, Atlantic Books won Independent Publisher of the Year and Imprint of the Year at the British Book Awards and achieved more than 25 top ten Sunday Times bestsellers. Atlantic titles were shortlisted for the Booker Prize five times between 2003 and 2013, including the The White Tiger, which won the prize in 2008. Toby became director of the Baillie Gifford Prize in 2014. We spoke to him about his entry into the industry, setting up Atlantic Books, his subsequent career as a literary agent, and his role with the Baillie Gifford Prize. This episode was recorded prior to the recent controversy about Baillie Gifford's sponsorship of literary festivals.\n\n“Always Take Notes: Advice From Some Of The World’s Greatest Writers” - a book drawing on our podcast interviews - is published by Ithaka Press.

Our music is by Jessica Dannheisser and our logo was designed by James Edgar.\n\nRachel and Simon speak with Perminder Mann, CEO of Bonnier Books UK. She was the first member of her family to go to university, where she studied drama; after declining an unpaid internship in the media, she turned to publishing, working in sales first at Macmillan, then Transworld and Bonnier. She left Bonnier for a stint in the toy industry, but returned to the company several years later. In 2015 and 2016 she was included on the Bookseller's list of the most influential people in publishing. She became CEO of Bonnier Books UK in 2018, and is also chair of the Publisher’s Association Consumer Publishers Council. We spoke to Perminder about her entry into publishing, her work at Bonnier, now the seventh-largest publisher in Britain, and the idea of author as brand.\n\nThis episode is sponsored by Curtis Brown Creative, the writing school attached to the major literary agency.
