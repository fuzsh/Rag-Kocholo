MS effects twice as many females as males.\n\nMain Digest\n\nA physician may diagnose MS in some patients soon after the onset of the illness. In others, however, doctors may not be able to readily identify the cause of the symptoms, leading to years of uncertainty and multiple diagnoses.\n\nThere is as yet no cure for MS. Many patients do well with no therapy at all, especially since many medications have serious side effects and some carry significant risks. However, three forms of beta interferon (Avonex, Betaseron, and Rebif) have now been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS.\n\nFamous People with Multiple Sclerosis\n\nNOTE: If you notice any inaccuracies in this list, please reach out to us so we can correct it.
