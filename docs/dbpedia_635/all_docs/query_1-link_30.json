        "text": "One of the most iconic gaming performances still has to be that of David Hayter’s portrayal of Snake in the Metal Gear Solid games. I was lucky enough to catch up with him recently and he was happy to talk about his career not only in voice acting but also as a major Hollywood screenwriter.\n\nOne of the first things he wanted to talk about was the fact I was in Japan. He clearly loves the country and has a lot of affection for it still. While I knew he’d spent some time here, he was more than happy to talk about that in more detail.\n\n“I lived in Kobe and Osaka for about 4 years. In terms of Japanese, I can get by conversationally in about any sushi bar and make my way around Tokyo without too much trouble.”\n\n“When I went to Japan I was 16 and did the 11th and 12th grade there. I graduated high school at the Canadian Academy in Kobe. My girlfriend and I then moved to Osaka, we lived there for a couple of years. Then we moved to Hong Kong and lived there for a little while. Traveled the world, drank and got in bar fights. It was awesome.”\n\nSnake And Metal Gear\n\nFor many gamers, Hayter is very well known for his depiction of Snake in the Metal Gear Solid games. It’s always been clear to me that Hayter plays games but I was curious from his standpoint what did he think was the best game in the Metal Gear Solid series.\n\n“Well, I have different favorites for different reasons. I usually say that Snake Eater is my favorite game, I just love the retro feel of it, I love the way it opened up Snake's story into Big Boss' story and seeing where it all began. I also thought the gameplay was beautifully designed and really quite an achievement. However, at the same time, I feel the same way about the first Metal Gear Solid, the Shadow Moses incident. Obviously, it had a big impact on my life and was an incredibly groundbreaking game when it came out. I guess those are two of my favorites. Though I also loved getting to play old Snake in Metal Gear Solid 4, so maybe I love them all.”\n\n“As for which game I preferred in terms of my performance, probably Metal Gear Solid 4. You know I think it got clearer to me what I was doing. When I started out he didn't have a face, he was all pixelated and the story was so over the top that the voice I came up with was a little over the top as well - to match the craziness of the world and the game. Then the games got photo-realistic and he had to get increasingly real as the technology progressed. I feel by Peace Walker and Metal Gear Solid 4 I sort of felt that I met the middle ground of where he is still iconic and he is still a larger than life character but it was a little more real than it was in the earlier games.”\n\nAs Hayter has become synonymous with playing Snake, I asked what other characters he would have liked to play, “I think Ocelot would have been a lot of fun to play. You know, some of the big villains, Vulcan Raven. There were some very cool villains; I think Cam Clarke had a great deal of fun with Liquid Snake. \"Hello Brathaaaa, do you like my sunglasses?\" Things like that, but you know I am an actor so I love playing anything as long as it is fun and I feel I have got a grip on it. The fact that I got to play Snake sort of defined my relationship with the series, so that's where my heart lies.”\n\nMore recently, the world of Metal Gear Solid descended on Ford and a few spots were made in the style of the first PSone game. In a wonderful move by Ford, Hayter and other members of the cast were called back to reprise their roles. I was naturally curious as to how this had come about.\n\n“With the Ford spots, they called me to do these two internet only tele-novella commercials. It’s a tele-novella with latino actors and we're doing bad voice dubs in English. It was me and it was Tara Strong and another actor, the executives told me that this was basically their excuse to meet their heroes and so they dragged me in because they wanted talk to me for something, or get me to do their voicemail as Snake. So we did that and I tweeted about it and each commercial got around 1.5 million views. So they then came back to me, though I don't think anyone realizes this, and asked me to do one for Captain Planet, which was my first voice over job and I got to play one of the planeteers for one of these Ford things. Then they finally said, would you be willing to do two of these as Snake. In an actual Metal Gear Solid type commercial. I was like, yeah, I'd do it but you have to get Konami's permission. You know, all these fan games come up and everybody wants to do something and Konami never says yes, so I didn't figure it would go anywhere. However, when Ford calls you up and says we want to license your game then they go \"yeah, okay\". So they called me back in and there I was, I had this script and Paul Eiding, who plays the Colonel, came in and we recorded this thing and it was great fun. Though I am getting some hassle and kickback from people who say that \"Oh you sold out Snake!\" or whatever. I thought it was really fun, I thought it was well written and it really was true to the games. So to those people I just want to say that, you know selling out has always been my dearest career goal. You know, live with it.”\n\nWhile fans may regard the Ford commercials with some degree of snobbery, something I don’t personally understand at all, Hayter is still very much about helping fans of Metal Gear. Something that has manifested itself with the various fan projects he’s supported recently.\n\n“With the new Shadow Moses fan project, I don't know where these guys came from but they were redesigning the island in Unreal Engine 4 and doing this amazing work. They wanted to do a full remake of the first Metal Gear Solid game. They asked me if I would be involved and I said that I think that if I am involved then the Eye of Sauron, you know Konami, will start to look at it. Then they will kill you. So I didn't think that was a great idea. Well, Konami killed them anyway but they had all this work done. So then, they came up with the idea of just doing a non-profit fan driven museum type tour of an actual Shadow Moses island. From that they said that nobody is making any money and would I be willing to do the voice of the host or narrator, as Snake walking people through it. So I said sure and that's how that came about.”\n\nTrying to understand more about his voice over work, Hayter was happy to clarify in detail how it differs between voicing anime and games.\n\n“In terms of anime, that's how I started my career in California. It's really fun but the difference compared to videogame work is you have to match the lips, as they're already animated. So you have to match your English dialogue to the Japanese dialogue that's coming through the mouth of the character. As you know, the Japanese when they speak have so many more syllables than in English. That means there's a lot of explanation in English whereas in Japanese that can easily amount to a few words. So that's a very different process. Like when I did Metal Gear for example, you do the dialogue but it is fed into a computer, so when I did Metal Gear Solid 2 they had me doing all sorts of different syllabic sounds so that they could just program the mouth to match whatever sounds I was making in the dialogue. So it got to be a lot easier when Snake speaks English, his mouth moves with my mouth. However, each recording of Metal Gear was different. On the first one we had cutscenes to record to, on the second one we had nothing. We just had timing to match. On the third one they would show us the length of the line in terms of original audio, so we could match that. Then on the fourth game, I was watching video of the Japanese actors in the motion capture suits, going through the motions. Each time then was more hilarious than the last.”\n\nThe big set of questions I wanted to ask was what happened on Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. While Hayter had already spoken about this in another interview at Game Informer, I wanted to follow up on some of that.\n\nThe most obvious starting point since Snake’s Japanese voice actor didn’t change for the new game, whereas his role was recast, and what he thought of that.\n\n“As for the fact Akio Ohtsuka remained as Snake in the Japanese version of Metal Gear Solid V, oh I am aware! As for why it happened, I have some ideas. I think it was internal politics, or Kojima just got tired of me. I also got a lot more expensive because every time a Metal Gear game would come up I was working on two or three different screenplays at the same time and the scheduling was killing me. So if we're going to do this then you're going to have to pay me. I don't know, maybe he got tired of that or he's a movie lover, maybe he wanted a bigger star or something? It's all just conjecture though, he never spoke to me about it.”\n\nAt this point I interjected that Kiefer Sutherland would have hardly been cheap.\n\n“Indeed and it also took my 9 months to record Metal Gear Solid 4 and I doubt you're going to get Kiefer in the booth for 9 straight months of recording. It's pretty extreme the amount of time you have to put in.”\n\n“In general, I wasn't impressed with the way the situation was handled. I feel like when somebody is a valuable employee and they've supported the title and done a bunch of publicity. You know once you've gone down a road with another artist and it's been very successful, there is usually some measure of respect there between the two parties. I didn't feel that was in place. I didn't feel that I was handled in a particularly professional manner.”\n\nThe thing that’s different about Hayter compared to other voice actors is that he is also an accomplished Hollywood screenwriter. As Hideo Kojima is widely known to be a fan of movies, I asked whether Kojima was envious of Hayter’s actual Hollywood experience. His response was thought provoking to say the least.\n\n“Calls for speculation.”\n\nFollowing on from this writing theme, I was curious if he would have liked to change the narrative of any of the Metal Gear games he worked on.\n\n“No, I wouldn't change anything in terms of the story. I think the games were very successful and part of that is because of the complex nature of Kojima's storytelling. The reality that he brings, the military aspect, his research is amazing. If I had been asked to write the games, I would have written them very differently just because he and I are very different writers but Metal Gear is what it is because of what he brought to it. So no, I wouldn't change anything.\n\n“However, at the end of Metal Gear Solid 4 I really argued against the final scene with Snake. In the booth, when we were doing it, as a writer this would not have been a choice I would have made. It seemed problematic for me to have a character who had been killing hundreds of soldiers and when it is time to kill himself for the good of the world, it just seemed weak to me for him to put his gun in his mouth and then it goes to black he pulls the trigger and then somehow he's missed? It didn't make a lot of sense to me. I felt like it weakened the character but I was always recording the games after the Japanese versions had pretty much been done. So there wasn't much I could say to alter the process.”\n\nIt was clear at this point that he wanted to clarify his stance on the Metal Gear series and he was quite frank about the current situation.\n\n“On the Metal Gear stuff, I just wanted to have my say about it. That I wasn't very impressed with the way things were handled. However, I don't want to keep on harping about it. I get all these people telling me to let it go, and I already have. I am fine, I am working all the time. However, people keep on asking me about it.”\n\n“Konami has still yet to contact me about any new Metal Gear games. I haven't spoken to Konami at all really. I just do my own thing and I think the fact that the Ford commercials are playing so big, maybe they will some idea that there's still a worthwhile relationship there. However, I don't know what their internal politics are in terms of Kojima, Metal Gear or any of it. I have not spoken with anyone about doing any more voice work for the Metal Gear games.”\n\n“The thing is that people don't really get on Metal Gear is that, I never worked with Kojima. Not ever. Admittedly, I met him but that was maybe only two or three times. He visited the recording twice over fifteen years and I then I ran into him at an awards show once. He didn't put a lot into the English recording for the games. It just wasn't a big part of his focus. So it's not that I dislike the man, I don't even know the guy.”\n\n“That's my only point really, I loved doing the job as Snake and I love the character. If I can keep doing that with Konami that's great. If not, I had a great run and I am very happy with that as well. To go back and do it for the Ford commercials was really fun. I also didn't make much money from it either, so if it is selling out it was a poor decision.”\n\nVoicing Anime And Getting Covered In Goo\n\nBeing the massive nerd I am, I also knew of Hayter way before his appearance in the first Metal Gear Solid. This is because he popped up in various anime I used to watch and in a live action adaptation of Guyver, a manga and anime I adore.\n\nThe big mystery I wanted resolving was why he replaced Bryan Cranston in the final episode of Macross Plus and in part, he did his best to answer that though he didn’t remember working on the series.\n\n“On Macross Plus, I don't remember doing it but in 1993 I starred in a movie called Guyver: Dark Hero. This was a live-action adaptation of a Japanese manga and anime. The guy who produced the music for that, worked at this studio where they were doing anime dubs. So he asked me whether I would come in and voice some anime. I didn't have any money, so I was like \"yeah! fantastic!\" and Bryan Cranston was one of the other actors there. We were both sort of became the go to guys for anime, as we were pretty good actors though him a lot more so than I. While I don't remember doing Macross Plus, at the time I was being called in a lot by Kevin Seymour, who directed almost all the voiceover dubs of practically every anime you have ever seen. So he'd call me in and give me a part. However, what happened with Bryan was eventually he got Malcolm in the Middle and then he left. His career took off. I was still doing anime until 1999 when I started writing for the first X-Men movie. So that's when I got my big break and I left after that. It was one of those gigs where actors would come in and make $50 an hour to do voices for anime. It was great but then for some people success came along and they would move on. It may have been that Bryan was no longer doing anime, plus those were all non-union things. So if you became a well-known union actor, legally you just couldn't go back and keep working on stuff like that.”\n\n“I had this crazy manager back in the day, I was just starting my career and he got me an audition for Guyver: Dark Hero. I was told it was a sci-fi movie and that I was auditioning for the lead. So I went to this weird warehouse and pseudo-sound stage in Van Nuys and I read for the part and they gave it to me. I then instantly quit my day job, unwisely, because I figured I was now this big movie star. I then went back to that same Van Nuys warehouse and they had built the big cave set inside it and we started working, it was awesome. It was like being Batman, it was very cool.”\n\n“I remember it was freezing working on Guyver: Dark Hero and we were in Van Nuys in the middle of the spring and the door was open, it was the middle of the night and they were covering me in what is called methisil. This is a food additive, it's what makes lemon meringue pies meringuey, but it is also the stuff that they used in Alien when the goo dripped from the alien's mouth. So it's this goo and it's horrible. Anyway, they were painting me in this stuff and they covering me in the Guyver armor pieces and then they would pull them off all at once. However, I had to basically stand there in my underwear for three hours just freezing to death to do that scene. I had to scream and I was freezing and Steve Wang, the director, said something to me that I will never forget. He was like \"David, pain is temporary, film is forever.\" So someday when I am torturing an actor on set I am going to use that.”\n\n“I don't think I've read the Guyver manga but I have seen the anime. I own the anime series. So I think that was my research, also four years living in Japan was pretty good background as well.”\n\nWho Watches The Watchmen\n\nAgain, another aspect to Hayter that people strangely seem to overlook is the fact he is a very accomplished screenwriter. Back in 1999 my mind was suitably blown when I saw his name in the credits of X-Men and did a big grin when I also saw his cameo in the movie. So it didn’t surprise me when news surfaced that he was directing as well as writing the screenplay for the movie adaptation of Alan Moore’s very highly regarded Watchmen.\n\nHowever, while he is co-credited on the final movie he wasn’t able to direct it. As someone that also loves the original graphical novel, I wanted to know what he thought of the final movie.\n\n“I enjoyed the theatrical release of Watchmen immensely. I spent 9 years trying to get that movie made and so to see it made and it to see a true Watchmen adaptation, I was very grateful and blown away that it actually occurred. So that was great. I saw it at the big premiere at the Mann's Chinese Theater and it was a great night. I was very honored to be a part of it. But I feel that movie was so huge that, if anyone has seen the Ultimate Cut that includes the Tales from the Black Freighter animated portions, I think that is really phenomenal. So I think to a certain extent that movie needed about 2 years to edit, which you don't really get almost ever. So my favorite cut is the Ultimate Cut, that's where it really is the true vision of what we all put into it. I still enjoyed the theatrical release of the movie, I thought it was good.”\n\n“As for the changed ending from the graphic novel version, I signed my contract to work on Watchmen on September 10th 2001. So the day after I signed my contract with Universal was 9/11 and it felt like the ending of this movie had actually happened in real life. From that moment on, as much as I love the ending in the graphic novel and those images of the big squid legs and the dead bodies in the streets, I felt that it was too painful. I just didn't feel like having multitudes of dead bodies in Times Square. I didn't think that was the right thing to do in that time period. So I started to thinking about how those people could be vaporized, or there's a running theme in the book of Hiroshima's shadows. Graffiti of people spray painted up against the walls, I thought that maybe that was what would happen to them. So that's it's not quite so bloody and so viscerally in your face, similar to 9/11. It started then to occur that maybe Dr. Manhattan's energy was a viable replacement for the giant squid.”\n\n“Alex Tse came onboard, the gentleman I am co-credited with on the screenplay, during Zack's production. I went up and visited but I wasn't really working on the film at that point. So Alex primarily worked with Zack to put it back in the 80s, whereas I had set it present day. They then made various changes throughout and Alex did the on-set work. We were all adapting the graphic novel, we were all hardcore fans and we all had a baseline we wanted to keep to.”\n\n“The ending was in place years before the Zack Snyder version started shooting.”\n\nWhile I didn’t like the changes to the ending in the movie, I can now at last understand the very sensible reasoning behind them.\n\nWhat was remarkable about the Watchmen adaptation though was that Alan Moore personally praised Hayter’s script, something he has never done to date on any other movie adaptation of his work.\n\nAnyway, the fact Alan Moore praised his work is something he still remembers fondly.\n\n“That was very very sweet of him. He was always nice to me, I spoke to him on the phone during the process. I was very deferential and just so inspired by the man, he knew that. He was always very supportive of me as a writer and was able to separate his perfectly legitimate feelings about Hollywood from his feelings about another writer who has been tasked with adapting his master work. So I was very very grateful to Alan for that.”\n\n“In terms of adapting any more of Alan Moore's works, well I would have loved to have done From Hell or V for Vendetta. They've done some good ones already. His Swamp Thing run is incredible and that might be cool to take on. I don't know though, I feel bad picking on the bones of Alan Moore because he doesn't care for Hollywood. I've talked many times about wanting to do Sandman, Neil Gaiman's master work, and hopefully they'll do a good job of that some day. It's tough to adapt Alan Moore's work, because it's so brilliant and you really want to stay true to it but at the same time you know he just doesn't want it done. However, Watchmen was so important I felt to the world, I mean I felt like those ideas and those concepts just deserved a much bigger audience. In that sense, I managed to get over my fears that he would be upset.”\n\nConsidering that Hollywood has now gone down the superhero route, Hayter’s script on the original X-Men xscript in many ways laid the foundation for that. However, the genre has changed in the years since and not entirely for the better.\n\n“Since I worked on the original X-Men in 1999, superhero movies have gotten a lot bigger that's for sure. I think the primary way they have evolved, which I really love, is that they are made true to the source material now. Whereas prior to X-Men there was a feeling that if you were going to adapt a comic book character you had to take it out of the realm of comic books. You couldn't get too into the fan minutiae, all of that detail was too confusing for the executives to embrace. There was a real fear that it would never work. Now though, you go into an Avengers movie and there's so much detail that the fans understand and that some guy can explain to his girlfriend who the Scarlet Witch is and what her powers are. It's very cool because it not only makes the movies a lot like the comic, you know the things that made us love this stuff in the first place, but it also gives non-comic book fans the feeling that the world is so much bigger, the universe is so much bigger than what they are grasping. I think that gives it a real reality. In the same way that you look at Star Wars and even from the first you felt that this was an immense galaxy you were stepping into. There's so much I am not seeing here. So I think these modern comic book movies have a lot of that and that's very cool. As a comic book fan to see that come together and have had whatever role in that is very gratifying.”\n\n“I read an interesting article saying that we were in the era of the plot-free-movie. That you are just going from set piece to set piece. From experience to experience. Sort of in the way that the Japanese tell their stories really, in the way their anime do. I can't say that I am a huge fan of that. The first X-Men was directed by Bryan Singer, who I believe has still never read an X-Men comic, I was the comic book fan, as was Tom DeSanto and Kevin Feige. We were the three fans of the comics there to make it all feel like X-Men. However, Bryan was just making a movie. He just wanted it to be clear and to have impact. So if you look at it the movie is really very simple; Rogue is having problems and Wolverine is having problems, they both end up at the mansion, they bond and then she's taken resulting in her need to be rescued. That's essentially the story. The rest of it is just setting up the world. Identifying why it is people have powers, why they have different powers from each other, why they have codenames instead of regular names. All the stuff that's weird about X-Men, Bryan just so brilliantly directed me and everybody else involved on the project into weaving all that information in, so that it feels like story but is really just set up for a world.”\n\n“However, I think it is taken for granted now that people know they are stepping into a comic book world. So that there might be weird planets, there might be weird powers, there might be this and that and you're right there is less of a need to justify these things or to clarify these things. You either keep up with the Avengers or you don't. It barrels along like a freight train, without you if you're not careful. So I can see that but at the same time you can't keep doing the same thing we did in X-Men again and again.”\n\nOn Direction And Voicing King Shark\n\nOne thing that was obvious when I talked with Hayter was just how busy and in demand he still is. That he is now branching out more into directing and not just screenwriting and voice acting.\n\n“In terms of my writing and directing work, ideally I want to keep on doing it. I love directing and had so much fun doing my debut feature film Wolves. To be perfectly mercenary about it, but this is Forbes, I don't get paid as much I do to write a big movie as I do to direct a little movie. So I sort of have to balance out my financial needs with my creative desires. However, I have another film, a fairly modestly budgeted horror thriller that I am attached to direct. I am trying to set that up now. I also have other bigger films that I am attached to produce, as well as working on setting up TV shows. If I set up a show that I am the executive producer of, I may come in and direct a few episodes. I mean my goal at this point is just to do what I enjoy and I am incredibly lucky to be able to work in all these different aspects of the business and still be able to pay my bills. Really I am just trying to appreciate the opportunities I have and be where I am and do what I think is fun for me as well as the audience.”\n\n“I am also the voice of King Shark on the Flash TV show, which is so fun and just an awesome kick-ass character to play. My daughter, who just turned 12, was already a fan of the show so I finally got to impress her with something I did. As most of the time she is like \"whatever X-Men, whatever Snake? I don't what that is?\". So that's been a pretty awesome fun part to play.”\n\nAfter that we rounded off the conversation and he re-iterated his love of Japan and told me to make the most of it. It’s not every day that Solid Snake gives you advice and in this instance, I am more than happy to abide by it.\n\nConsidering all that Hayter has been through in his career it was nice to see he is still genuinely upbeat about what he’s done and now doing. His set of skills are definitely unique and I can only hope they continue to utilized to their full extent, as it would be an obvious waste otherwise.\n\nAt the very least Konami need to call the real Snake back, as Jack Bauer doesn’t really cut it.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.
