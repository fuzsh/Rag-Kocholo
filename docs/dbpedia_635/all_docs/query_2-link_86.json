        "text": "New animated series\n\nPremieres August 1 on Prime Video\n\nProduced by J.J. Abrams, Matt Reeves, and Bruce Timm (the latter co-created the 1990s Fox series Batman: The Animated Series), the latest animated Batman series was originally ordered by HBO Max before cost-cutting led that network to drop the project, which was then acquired by Amazon. Don't expect your typical Batman. For one thing, the show is set in the 1940s, with a film noir-like atmosphere to match. Harley Quinn (a character originally co-created by Timm) will boast a new look—and personality—while villains will run the gamut from the old (Clayface) to the new (Onomatopoeia) ... plus a gender-switched Penguin, voiced by Minnie Driver. Hamish Linklater voices Batman, and he's joined in the cast by McKenna Grace, Jamie Chung, Christina Ricci, Diedrich Bader, Reid Scott, John DiMaggio, and Tom Kenny. All 10 episodes stream on day one, and a second season has already been ordered.\n\nStreaming movie\n\nPremieres August 9 on Apple TV+\n\nThe second movie from director Doug Liman this year (following his Road House remake) is a Boston-set heist/road trip caper said to be inspired by Midnight Run and Butch Cassidy. Matt Damon and Casey Affleck (who also co-wrote the screenplay) star as an unlikely criminal pairing—one's a dad, the other's an ex-con—who set out to rob a corrupt politician only for their plans to go awry, leaving them on the run from both the cops and organized crime. Filling out the cast are Hong Chau, Paul Walter Hauser, Michael Stuhlbarg, Toby Jones, Ving Rhames, Alfred Molina, and Ron Perlman.\n\nReturning drama series\n\nPremieres August 11 on HBO and Max\n\nMiss Succession? HBO's somewhat under-the-radar drama Industry, which last aired two years ago, may lack that other prestige show's dark humor (though there's some), but it has more than its fair share of high-stakes, high-wealth drama—and critical acclaim. Industry is set in the London financial industry and follows a group of young investment bankers as they strive (often against each other) to advance their careers. This third season adds Kit Harington (Game of Thrones) and Sarah Goldberg (Barry) to the cast.\n\nNew dramedy series\n\nPremieres August 14 on Apple TV+\n\nOriginally ordered to series in 2021, the latest Apple series from Bill Lawrence (Ted Lasso, Shrinking) is an adaptation of Carl Hiaasen's 2013 novel of the same name. Vince Vaughn stars as Andrew Yancy, a former Miami police detective now demoted to restaurant inspector who finds himself drawn into a case involving corruption and environmental issues after a tourist finds a severed arm while fishing. Michelle Monaghan, John Ortiz, Jodie Turner-Smith, Rob Delaney, Natalie Martinez, and Alex Moffat also star, while guests include Zach Braff. The series kicks off with a two-episode premiere before reverting to weekly single-episode installments.\n\nStreaming movie\n\nPremieres August 15 on Prime Video\n\nPaul Feig (Bridesmaids, A Simple Favor) directs Simu Liu, Awkwafina, and John Cena in a comedic action film set in a near-future California where there's a new twist on the state lottery: If you can track down and kill (without using a gun) someone holding a winning ticket on the day the winner is announced, the prize becomes yours. (Yes, we promise it's a comedy.)\n\nNew animated series\n\nPremieres August 15 on Adult Swim (and streams August 16 on Max)\n\nTakashi Sano (Tower of God) writes and directs an alternate, Japanese-produced anime take on Adult Swim's hit animated sci-fi/comedy series Rick and Morty that will feature the same characters you know and love but in completely different storylines. Oh, and they don't necessarily speak English anymore: While those premiere dates listed above are for the English-language dub of the series (with a different voice cast than regular Rick and Morty); Adult Swim will also air the subtitled, Japanese-language version beginning August 17 at midnight.\n\nClassic drama series\n\nStreaming debut August 19 on Peacock\n\nOne of the most acclaimed TV dramas of the 1990s (and maybe the entire 20th century) has never been available to stream anywhere ... until now. Adapted by Paul Attanasio (Donnie Brasco) from a nonfiction book by David Simon—who would also write on the series and later go on to create such shows as The Wire—Homicide follows a group of Baltimore police detectives through a mix of self-contained and serialized storytelling. Over the show's seven-season run, the ensemble cast included Andre Braugher (who quickly made a name for himself as one of TV's finest actors), Melissa Leo, Ned Beatty, Clark Johnson, Yaphet Kotto, Richard Belzer (as Detective Munch, a character he would then bring to the Law & Order franchise), Michelle Forbes, and Giancarlo Esposito, plus one-off guests like Robin Williams, Steve Buscemi, Charles Durning, Jake Gyllenhaal, James Earl Jones, J.K. Simmons, Paul Giamatti, Edie Falco, and Chris Rock.\n\nAll 122 episodes will be available at launch on Peacock, as well as the concluding chapter Homicide: The Movie. The show was previously released on DVD, but thanks to a new 4K remaster, this is Homicide's first appearance anywhere in HD.\n\nReturning comedy series\n\nPremieres August 27 on Hulu\n\nPicking up following the events of last year's finale, which (spoilers!) ended with the murder of Sazz (Jane Lynch), the fourth season of Hulu's hit murder mystery comedy series finds our trio of amateur sleuths/podcasters (played once again by Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez) heading across the country to Los Angeles as they investigate Sazz's death. In Hollywood, they'll also encounter the filming of a movie adaptation of their podcast in which the trio is portrayed by Eugene Levy (as Charles), Zach Galifianakis (as Oliver), and Eva Longoria (as Mabel). Other newcomers this season include Molly Shannon, Melissa McCarthy, Kumail Nanjiani, Richard Kind, and Desmin Borges, while Meryl Streep will return from Season 3.\n\nReturning fantasy drama series\n\nPremieres August 29 on Prime Video\n\nDid Amazon's $700 million investment in what it hoped would become its answer to Game of Thrones pay off when the epic fantasy series debuted two years ago? It's hard to say: Amazon claims Rings was the most-watched show in Prime Video's history, but outside sources also suggest that viewership dropped significantly as the season progressed, and the show failed to garner the buzz (or the Emmy nominations) that GoT did before it. Perhaps this second season will clarify things once and for all. Ciarán Hinds and Rory Kinnear are among the (many) new additions to an already enormous cast for the UK- (rather than New Zealand-) filmed Season 2, which traces Sauron's rise to power and features an all-female directing lineup. The season kicks off with a three-episode premiere before shifting to a one-episode per week schedule through October 3."
