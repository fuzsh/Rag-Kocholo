Please remember to drink plenty of water as your body will be more dehydrated. Be careful when drinking alcohol as the combination of altitude and dehydration can cause alcohol to act faster.

You can find some great advice on dealing with altitude here.\n\nQ. What are Aspen Words’ health and safety standards for conference attendees?\n\nA.

You approach and say, “Can I tell you a story?” The stranger gives you a look and says, warily, “Okay.” How do you keep that stranger on the barstool? In this generative workshop, we’ll spend five mornings discussing short published work as examples of how others have solved some of the challenges we’re all facing, and then we’ll practice some of the skills necessary to meet those challenges through in-class writing prompts followed by discussion. Writers will leave with new work and new strategies to pursue as well as a better understanding of how to identify and articulate what we’re doing on the page. Some brief (and wonderful) advance reading required.\n\nWill Schwalbe is the author of “The End of Your Life Book Club,” which was a #1 Indie Next pick, an Entertainment Weekly Best Book of the Year, and spent nine weeks on the New York Times bestseller list.

Each participant will workshop either a full story or an excerpt from a longer work, along with a one-line story premise. (Don’t worry; you’ll get guidance on how to come up with the premise.) We will read one another’s work deeply and generously to figure out what is working best in a particular piece, what makes it special, so that the writer can approach revision knowing what to intensify and magnify (rather than simply what’s not working). Although we will be emphasizing story structure, we will consider all elements of fiction—voice, point of view, language—in our workshop discussions. Finally, we will definitely save some time to discuss publishing strategies and tips for submitting to journals, querying agents, and beyond. The goal is to leave energized and motivated, with a story premise you can use to pitch your work and a firm plan to guide your writing/revision.\n\nAPPLY NOW\n\nJim Shepard has written eight novels, including most recently “Phase Six” and “The Book of Aron,” which won the Sophie Brody Medal for Jewish Literature, the PEN/New England Award for Fiction, and the Clark Fiction Prize, and five story collections, including “Like You’d Understand, Anyway,” a finalist for the National Book Award and Story Prize winner.

He’s also won a Guggenheim Foundation Award, the Library of Congress/ Massachusetts Book Award for Fiction and the ALEX Award from the American Library Association. He teaches at Williams College.\n\nWorkshop Description\n\nA workshop in close reading, and all that that entails. In order to improve as writers we have to improve as readers, so we’ll be working to hone our practice of the best sort of reading: figuring out how to make ourselves even more that ideal reader who is, in Louise Gluck’s formulation, consistently rigorous, fastidious and optimistic. A good workshop is at heart a dialogue about possibility, and we’ll be considering how many ways meaning can take shape on a page, to help us decide what our own path toward the fiction we want to write should look like. We’ll be breaking down as clearly and as comprehensively as possible what our fiction seems to want to be doing, and how it’s doing it. and how it’s doing it. For that reason, besides one or two exercises, the focus will be entirely on students’ work.\n\nAPPLY NOW\n\nBarbadian author and editor Karen Lord has been a physics teacher, a diplomat, a part-time soldier and an academic at various times and in various countries.

Memoir lives between fiction and autobiography; in this classic creative writing workshop, students learn strategies to mine their life experiences while utilizing the novelist’s toolbox to turn their experiences into stories. We will also be exploring how memory works, how its depths are infinite if we train our attention toward recall–a surface strand of memory unspooling those hidden beneath the sediment of time. Using our stories, the stories we need to tell, we will focus on developing our narrative voices and writing techniques with the goal of exploring the material we are full of. The acclaimed American fiction writer John Updike wrote, “You are full of your material—your family, your friends, your region of the country, your generation—when it is fresh and seems urgently worth communicating to readers. No amount of learned skills can substitute for the feeling of having a lot to say, of bringing news. Memories, impressions, and emotions from your first 20 years on earth are most writers’ main material; little that comes afterward is quite so rich and resonant. By the age of 40, you have probably mined the purest veins of this precious lode; after that, continued creativity is a matter of sifting the leavings.”\n\nStudents will be encouraged to open themselves to critical analysis by their peers in order to learn what works and does not in their memoirs. Alongside close reading, we will understand editing and rewriting as integral parts of the creative process. Above all we will be exploring what makes for good memoir. The primary text for the class will be the students’ work, but we will also have time for in-class exercises and outside readings to inspire our imaginations and deepen our exploration of technique.\n\nAPPLY NOW\n\nChicago-born Peter Orner is the author of seven books, the memoirs/ essay collections, “Still No Word from You,” a finalist for the PEN Award for the Art of the Essay and “Am I Alone Here?”, a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, as well as the story collection, “Maggie Brown and Others,” a New York Times Notable Book, and the novel, “Love and Shame and Love,” winner of a California Book Award.

Is all my fiction made up? Is all my memoir absolutely true? Good prose is good prose, no matter what we call it, and yet what I find most exciting about memoir is that there’s a constraint on my imagination and this constraint forces, at times, a kind of reckoning. I can’t retreat into making stuff up. I’ve got to try and hold steady and make some stab at some truth. As a reader, I’m especially interested in memoir that is outward rather than inward looking. For instance, one of my favorite books is called “Danube” by the Italian writer, Claudio Magris. It’s essentially a tour of the Danube River through central Europe. Now I confess, I’ve got no special interest in this particular river, and yet “Danube” has become, for me, a kind of essential text. It’s not billed as a memoir and yet by the end of it I know Magris better than I know some members of my own family, not because he’s told me so much about himself, but because his curiosity about place, history, and people, gives me deep insight into a remarkably singular brain. In this memoir workshop, we’ll be reading and discussing our own works in progress with an eye toward finding that truthful reckoning — whatever it takes to get there. We’ll also be reading short excerpts by Magris, Zadie Smith, Joseph Mitchell, Janet Malcolm, Vievee Francis, Fernanda Melchor, Taylor Johnson and Virginia Woolf (her journals).\n\nAPPLY NOW\n\nKarenShepard is a Chinese-American bornand raised in New York City.
