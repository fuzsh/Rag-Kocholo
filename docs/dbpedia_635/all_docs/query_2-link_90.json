        "text": "''SUNDAY LOVERS,'' which starts today at the Embassy 3 and other theaters, is a four-part sketch-film in which the bad outweighs the good three-to-one. Because the good sketch, ''An Englishman's Home,'' an English farce written by Leslie Bricusse and directed by Bryan Forbes, opens the picture, it's very easy (if one is desperate) to go see it and leave without having to endure the rest of the picture.\n\nThis rest-of-the-picture runs the gamut from not-so-good to awful. The least offensive is something called ''The French Method,'' directed by Edouard Molinaro and written by Francis Verber, who earlier collaborated on ''La Cage aux Folles.'' It stars Lino Ventura, whose fine, expressive face seems to have been molded in a miracle substance guaranteed to last forever, as a French businessman who, to clinch an important deal, must act as a pimp for one of his secretaries, only to discover scruples at the last minute.\n\nThe film's Italian segment, ''Armando's Notebook,'' is strictly 1960's, mass-market Italian movie-making of an immediately forgettable kind. Left alone by his wife for a weekend, Armando (Ugo Tognazzi), looks up a series of old girlfriends, only to find (1) true happiness, (2) disillusion, (3) that he loves his wife best of all. Choose any two.\n\nThis segment was written by Age and Scarpelli and directed by Dino Risi, probably when they are were all dozing in the sun somewhere. Gene Wilder, as the writer, director and star, is responsible for the most appalling contribution to ''Sunday Lovers,'' something called ''Skippy,'' about a doltish fellow named Skippy (Mr. Wilder) who has signed himself into a mental hospital because he has a sex problem. (We are told the problem is premature ejaculation, but because Skippy is such a nonentity, it's difficult not to believe that Skippy is lucky even at that.)\n\nWith the help of his understanding psychiatrist (Dianne Crittenden), who, like everyone else in the movie, spends an unusual amount of time staring rapturously at her patient, Skippy goes on a weekend pass and finds a beautiful young woman (Kathleen Quinlan) who has problems of her own and is thus able to effect his cure.\n\nMr. Wilder is a maddening talent, capable of marvelous work in films like Mel Brooks's ''Young Frankenstein,'' his own ''Sherlock Holmes's Smarter Brother'' and in Woody Allen's ''Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sex,'' but he's not even tolerable in things like ''Stir Crazy'' and this minor mess. His fatal weakness is to cast himself not simply as a love-object but as a love-object who is full of pathos.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
