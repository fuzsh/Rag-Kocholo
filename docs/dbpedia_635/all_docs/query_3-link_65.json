        "text": "MSU basketball has announced that Cleveland State guard and former Lansing Sexton product Bryn Forbes will transfer to MSU.\n\nForbes will have to sit out the 2014-15 season, unless he receives a hardship waiver from the NCAA. The 6-foot-3 Forbes averaged 15.6 points per game last season, shooting 42 percent from deep. He was a high school teammate of current Spartan Denzel Valentine.\n\n“We are excited to add Bryn Forbes, a homegrown product, to our roster,” Tom Izzo said in a release. “He was extremely well coached by former Spartan Carlton Valentine at Lansing Sexton, and brings with him the championship attitude that he developed there as he teamed with Denzel Valentine to win back-to-back state championships.\n\n“Bryn enjoyed two great seasons at Cleveland State, but he’s decided to come back closer to home. He brings the ability to shoot the basketball and you can never have enough shooters on your team. Look at some of his best performances, and you can see that they’ve come against top-notch competition, such as scoring 22 points against Kentucky.”\n\nForbes is the second guard to transfer to MSU this week, joining West Virginia’s Eron Harris."
