Each year, Biola awards more than $70 million in aid to students. Factor in discounted summer courses, accelerated programs and other cost-saving options, and there are many ways to make a premier education attainable for families from all backgrounds.\n\nExplore Financial Aid\n\nThe most important part of my life here at Biola is definitely the word of God. I'm so grateful to be able to study the Bible academically, and be formed spiritually with my peers. That brings me to the second most important thing, which is my friends, with whom I've grown so much in my faith in just the past two years alone.\n\nDeborah Zewdie\n\nBiological Science\n\nI value Biola’s closely knit, Christ-centered community. Biola does not only advertise as this, but it is truly shown in every student, professor, and faculty member on campus, which I am extremely grateful for.\n\nBrian Ybarra\n\nPolitical Science"
