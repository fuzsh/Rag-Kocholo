Among the American prisoners is Cpl. King, a wheeler-dealer who has managed to establish a pretty good life for himself in the camp. King soon forms a friendship with an upper-class British officer who is fascinated with King's enthusiastic approach to life.",

        "text": "Of POW war films, King Rat is the antithesis to The Great Escape.\n\nThere's no whistle-along theme here, but rather a bleak, quiet desperation that fuels survival; where to be alive is to have committed sins against your comrades. And as the prologue states, there's \"no friendly Swiss border\" a Steve McQueen can attempt to escape to on his motorbike. With the prison camp surrounded by an inhospitable jungle, there's not a whiff of escape in the air in King Rat.\n\nIn a film guided more by character than plot, the only action the prisoners must truly make is in deciding whether to compromise their morals to see themselves to the end of the war, or to not compromise and…\n\n“Don’t you remember what we had? I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you.”\n\nMy review was going to be a very non-serious “James Fox falling in love with a man who’s ‘below’ him and whose motives are unclear cinematic universe” but then the last line of James fox telling tom courtenay that Tom only survived because of the hate that George segal gave him, thereby contrasting with the love that george gave to James…. It sent a shock through my system\n\nIn my recent musings about The Great Escape, I described it as mild mannered compared to the grim goings-on in such films as The Bridge on the River Kwai and King Rat. John Sturges’ film is an entertainment full of noble characters and heroic acts. Brian Forbes’ is an art film full of deeply flawed characters out simply to survive. King Rat is based on a novel by James Clavell, inspired by his experiences in a Japanese POW camp, and somewhat ironically, Clavell wrote the screenplay for The Great Escape.\n\n“Why do you think, corporal, that you have so much, and the rest of us have so little?”\n\nKing Rat centers around the activities of Corporal King (George Segal), an…\n\nBryan Forbes directs this outstanding prisoner of war drama about an opportunistic sergeant in a harsh Japanese prisoner of war camp, starring George Segal, Tom Courtney, James Fox and John Mills.\n\nIt was really absorbing and hard-hitting, showing the lengths people had to go to to survive, and how class and rank quickly break down under those conditions. The cast was excellent, especially Segal, who makes this mercenary and conniving character seem three dimensional, and I think it’s one of his best performances. The film is very dark and bleak, but really gripping, developing the characters and situation in really interesting ways.\n\nIt was a powerful and realistic look at a group of flawed characters in incredibly adverse circumstances and still manages to be really effective, even if it is more character based than plot driven.\n\nI haven't changed! I mean, I'm not ashamed or embarrassed because you're my friend. We survived it, you and me. Don't you remember what we had? I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. Don't you remember that?\n\nWell, you worked for me a couple of times and I paid you for it. That's all we had.\n\nAn insanely sweaty, well-shot POW film about an \"intense friendship\" between George Segal (black market top dog) and James Fox (toffee-nosed, saronged); power and class upended, transgression of social rules, comprised morality.\n\nThe romantic subtext between Fox and Segal is thick in the air – Fox's pain as Segal severs their bond due to the war ending; the love and gratitude he'll carry with him.\n\n\"If you don't want to eat it, you can sit and watch, it's a free prison!\" -Corporal King,\n\n- THS Losers: boxd.it/iDXDC\n\nA little bit gay.\n\nThis is a pretty movie with interesting characters and a plot that didn't bore me. I bring up that it didn't bore me because I find most war and POW movies to be kind of boring but not this one. There are some touching moments and a good cast. Solid film all around.\n\nWorth it.\n\nFirst time watching this through. I thought it was going to be a Stalag 17 ripoff at first, but it quickly changed into something I wasn't expecting, a story of love between two men. These two quickly form a bond together, and while they never seem to be a couple, it's all between the lines that at least Marlowe loves King more than just as a friend. The performances are great in this movie, and the music by John Barry is, as usual, great. I wish the overall story got a little more attention, as there are some elements that seem rushed or ignored, mostly related to Grey, who I found to be a compelling character, but was let-down by his lack of screen time after a certain moment in the film. He was clearly supposed to be the antagonist of this movie, but I felt more for him than the movie probably meant me too.\n\n- One hell of an opening: After the introductory crawl makes it very clear that isn’t a POW movie centered around escape, the first shot is an high-ranking officer amongst latrines, sitting straight on the only one built like a chair.\n\n- The sound design is incredible.\n\n- Fascinating cross-class love story between George Segal and James Fox at the center (platonic or romantic, though there’s so much touching and long looks that I lean towards the latter), bonding over genuine admiration, concern, and opportunism. I’m shocked that fanfic writers aren’t all over this.\n\n- Just how many POW movies was James Donald in? He does a good job surviving them, at least.\n\n- This would make an excellent double feature with Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence."
