        "text": "The European Press Prize is awarded in five different categories. Each award is for 10,000 euros, to be spent wherever possible on a personal project that may, in turn, enrich the practice of journalism. The judges are also empowered to award a special prize for particular excellence. The nominated works will be published on the website of the European Press Prize.\n\nINVESTIGATIVE REPORTING AWARD – For discovering and revealing facts, exposing hidden news to the public.\n\nInvestigative reporting is one of journalism’s core duties. It means journalists – either alone or in teams – discovering and revealing facts that would otherwise remain hidden: stories of corruption or neglect in business, secret deals in politics and hidden crimes of war, from an international scale to that of one hospital or one person. Some winners have shown personal bravery in the face of power that wishes to silence them. Equally, international networks of data investigation have exposed some mighty scandals. Investigative journalism serves the public interest. It tells voters in democracies what they need to know. It is one definition of the purpose of journalism itself.\n\nThis year’s winner: Death Weapons: Inside a Teenage Terrorist Network, by Alexander Nabert, Christina Brause, Bryan Bender, Nick Robyns-Early, published by Welt Am Sonntag, POLITICO.\n\nDISTINGUISHED REPORTING AWARD – For exceptional reporting, telling a story in the best possible way.\n\nThe worlds of investigation and brilliant description or narrative blend into each other. Great journalism can reveal and describe in a single article. But this is the category – in news, features, business and sport – where fine reportage and feature writing belong. Telling the story in the best possible way. It may be the work of a foreign correspondent chronicling war, terrorism or disaster. It may equally be perceptive reporting of events, trends or changes in politics, society or culture at home, explaining them to another. Or it may just capture events with an eloquence, originality, perception or power that live in the memory.\n\nThis year’s winner: The travelling tribunal, by Johannes Böhme, published by Die Zeit.\n\nPUBLIC DISCOURSE AWARD – For a remarkable textual interpretation of the world we live in. (Formerly known as the Opinion Award)\n\nThis category is a celebration of reflection; awarding work that goes beyond the immediate job of reporting and analysing the news. It recognises the capacity of journalism to instigate debate, affect our thoughts and enrich the public discourse. Pieces entered in this category may range from thoughts about the state of the universe, identity, gender and our relationship to the natural world, to analyses of international political or economical developments. Entries in this category can be written by columnists and commentators, but also by historians, cultural activists, philosophers and artists – anyone who is trying to interpret society from their own perspective. The work can take any journalistic form in exploring the way we live today. The judges will look particularly for cogency, originality and arguments that have an impact on public life. They will ask the question: how does this work engage with the idea that there is a public – a public that needs to be stimulated and formed – and how does this piece fit into the public discourse?\n\nThis year’s winner: “She lost consciousness as it was happening and she’s actually grateful she did.” What we know about the rapes perpetrated in Ukraine by Russian soldiers, by Alla Konstantinova, published by Mediazona.\n\nINNOVATION AWARD – Celebrating Data Journalism, challenging the boundaries of journalism\n\nThis category shifts focus each year as new trends and technical possibilities emerge. In 2023, looking back on 11 years of innovative journalism, we can clearly see the incredible force data journalism has become. Each year, multiple data journalism projects were nominated. That is why in 2024, ​​thanks to the collaboration with the European Data Journalism Network, we choose to celebrate Data Journalism especially with our Innovation Award: giving data journalism the attention it has claimed and deserved, showcasing the huge impact it has had on our newsrooms and debates.\n\nData journalism is an approach that encompasses a variety of methods and tools. It builds trustworthiness on rigour and explainability, using a range of formats and skills that expand the possibilities of journalism. This year the Innovation Award will focus on work that uses data in innovative ways, either in the journalistic process or in the final publication. Of course, as is true each year: we welcome all innovative projects in this category!\n\nThis year’s winner: Russian Asset Tracker, by Juliette Garside, Simon Goodley, Jasper Jolly, Kalyeena Makortoff, Antonio Baquero, Lara Dihmis, Alex Dziadosz, Jared Ferrie, Brian Fitzpatrick, Kevin Hall, Ilya Lozovsky, Eli Moskowitz, Will Neal, Stelios Orphanides, Miranda Patrucic, Olesya Shmagun, Graham Stack, Tom Stocks, Drew Sullivan, Julia Wallace, Jonny Wrate, Jan Strozyk, Lara Dihmis, Misha Gagarin, Karina Shedrofsky, Alina Tsogoeva, Ivana Jeremić, Olena LaFoy, Bojana Pavlović, Dima Stoianov, Romina Colman, Ilia Donskikh, Nathan Jaccard, James O’Brien, Edin Pašović, Mark Nightingale, published by OCCRP, The Guardian, Anti-Corruption Data Collective, Bird.bg, Delfi Estonia, Follow the Money, Forbes, Frontstory.pl, infoLibre, Inside Story, Investigative Center of Jan Kuciak, Investigace.cz, IrpiMedia, MANS, Miami Herald, Le Monde, NDR, Oštro, profil, Re:Baltica, Reporter.lu, Siena.lt, SVT, Tamedia, De Tijd, Transparency International UK.\n\nMIGRATION JOURNALISM AWARD – For an acclaimed example of migration journalism\n\nOver the years, migration – in all its forms – has been a recurring theme in our submissions and shortlists. That is why, following the advice of our Preparatory Committee – and with the support of the Robert Bosch Stiftung – Migration Journalism has become a category of its own since 2023. We believe that journalism and migration are deeply intertwined, and that migration journalism affects not only the scope and quality of the information received by the public, but also the way societies perceive and relate to migration.\n\nMigratory movements are part of our daily lives and societies and are omnipresent in Europe and European journalism. The Migration Journalism category welcomes all submissions that deal with the phenomenon of migration in a broad sense, especially those that demonstrate the importance of such journalism for societies, and those that reveal unexpected facets of the topic. Our Migration Journalism Award recognises the work that not only highlights an individual’s story but also provides a social, economic and cultural context. It also celebrates journalism that contributes to raising awareness and informing about the situation of migrants’ and their rights and contributions to society, helping to counter xenophobia, racism and discrimination.\n\nThe Migration Journalism submissions for the 2023 edition ranged from analysis of government policies and their impact, to personal stories and journeys of migration or displacement, to capturing the essence of a migrant community.\n\nThis year’s winner: The long road to a home in Europe, by Maartje Bakker, César Dezfuli, published by de Volkskrant.\n\nSPECIAL AWARD – The judges award a special prize for excellent journalism to one striking entry which defies categories and disciplines.\n\nEach year European Press Prize judges have the power to single out some area of special excellence in European journalism. Sometimes – as in 2015 – the judges may recognise particular achievements in international data journalism. Sometimes – as in 2016 – they recognised the weight and brilliance of much of the reporting of Europe’s migrant crisis. But, equally, they may choose to salute an individual journalist, a news team or an editor for memorable service to quality journalism. This decision is for the judges alone. No entry forms are required. But individual journalists are totally free to write to the European Press Prize director’s office suggesting suitable award recipients, and the judges will, of course, take such recommendations into account.\n\nThis year’s winner: Suicide missions, abuse, physical threats: International Legion fighters speak out against leadership’s misconduct, by Anna Myroniuk, Alexander Khrebet, published by The Kyiv Independent."
