The Cold Water Army.

BY S. A. WALKER.

TUNE â€” 'Tis my delight of a shiny night

Did you ever hear of the Army

The Washingtonians form?

Did you ever hear of the citadel

Of Alcohol's they storm?

O! it is a conquest glorious;

Come, spread the tidings wide;

O! we'll sing a song victorious,

And join their ranks beside.

Long has he checked his enemies,

And held them all at bay;

But now the Washingtonians

Big fair to win the day.

O! it is a conquest, &c.

On, on, brave Washingtonians,

Though dear the struggle cost;

Press on, ye win the citadel,

Retreat, and all is lost.

O! it is a conquest, &c.

But lo! it totters fearfully,

Each bannered turret falls;

Now like the billows boundingly

Pass o'er its broken walls.

O! it is a conquest, &c.

Soon from the ashes mouldering,

This citadel laid low,

Ten thousand crystal rivulets,

The gifts of God, shall flow.

O! it is a conquest, &c.
