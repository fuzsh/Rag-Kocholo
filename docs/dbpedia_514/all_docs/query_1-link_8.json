        "text": "In the nineteenth century, an appeal to temperance — refraining from the use of alcoholic beverages — might be made via a sermon or a small religious tract. But there was nothing like a good “visual” to get the point across.\n\nThis c. 1840s New Jersey Juvenile Temperance Band broadsheet or handbill delivered a big punch (bad 19th century pun, sorry) by dramatically showing youth and young adults the devastating effects of alcohol via “before and after” illustrations.\n\nBefore “Just say no” entered the mainstream vocabulary, decades later, it was just say “no way, I’ll never touch a drop!”\n\nSee the young man on the left? Healthy, well groomed, upright. Look at the other poor fellow. Unkempt and unshaven; dazed, confused, downcast.\n\nAccording to the caption: “Had this young man, when a Boy, joined a Juvenile Temperance Band, his once beautiful face would never have looked as you see it in the next picture.\n\nYou probably have only read this 2,938 times, but it does bear repeating — as it did in 1840:\n\n‘One ounce of preventive is worth a pound of cure.’”\n\nTo avoid looking like a ratty un-cool version of Edgar Allan Poe, you were entreated to join the New Jersey Juvenile Temperance Band and “take the pledge.”\n\nMedium-ites under the age of eighteen, repeat after me:\n\nWe join in heart, we join in hand\n\nTo form this Juvenile Temperance Band:\n\nWe’ll drink no Brandy, Rum nor Gin —\n\nThe Serpent’s lure to death and sin.\n\nWine, Beer and Cider we detest,\n\nThus we’ll make our parents blest:\n\nSo here we pledge perpetual hate\n\nTo all that can intoxicate\n\nPlease allow some slack. It doesn’t flow off the tongue as trippingly as a Tech N9ne rhyme, but we’re feeling the 1840. Not the 2015. You, down front: Back off, dog.\n\nAnyway, once you joined as a sober young man you were a member of the “Cold Water Army.” Apparently, life just started on an upward trajectory after this point. Perhaps you graduated to a 19th-century version of the Kiss Army.\n\nSo. This bit of historical ephemera via The New Jersey Juvenile Temperance Band is — yes — a broadsheet, but it was also a partly printed form. Beneath the pledge there is space underneath for “youth under 18 years of age” to sign their names to the pledge.\n\nOn the back of the broadsheet the song The Band of Freedom is arranged in two columns. This choral song for girls and boys is arranged to be sung antiphonally and contains the chorus verse: “We will be a band of freemen!”\n\nSomething must have worked, or someone was paid off, or there is a truth somewhere, perhaps, in the middle. The constitution of the New Jersey Juvenile Temperance Band was published in 1841. That took some doing. Forming a constitution.\n\nBy 1844, three years later, this socially-progressive reform outfit was reporting some serious local viral activities going on….\n\nMr. Warren also read his annual report is the Agent of the New Jersey Juvenile Temperance Band, which gave a thrilling account of his labors during the year. From this it appears that some 13,000 youth have been enrolled in the Cold Water Army — and twice that number might have been secured had not his movements been impeded by a want of pecuniary means, and various other obstructions, which may be easily removed, if all the leading men in society would land their aid. He visited ten counties during the year. A committee was appointed to take immediate measures to secured needful funds to sustain this fundamental movement.¹\n\nPart of the effects of the Temperance Movement — and this was Nationwide America, not just New Jersey — was its ability to give women (here “Girls) a more public-facing presence of position and responsibility.\n\nHere the “Girls” present lyrics that indicates they know something is going to happen when they get involved. ‘Ridicule and censure braving.’ By literally waving their flags of Temperance (likely, handmade and hand-produced) they would raise the ire and dander of some of their more testosterone-enhanced counterparts.\n\nAn unusual 1840s illustrated temperance broadsheet aimed at youth, issued by the New Jersey Juvenile Temperance Band, possibly unique and unrecorded.\n\nEnjoyed reading this article?
