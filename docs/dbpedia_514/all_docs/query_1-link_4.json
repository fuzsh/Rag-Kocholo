        "text": "Feb. 25 - Mar. 01, 2015\n\nAs The Great Blizzard of 1888 brings Louisville, KY to a standstill, a monstrous fish is caught and stored overnight in an Irish tavern; it's presence here will forever change the lives of those forced to take shelter in the tavern overnight.\n\nCOLD WATER ARMY tells the fortunes of Dallin, the tavern-keeper with an impossible debt to pay; Adalyn, a devout member of the Cold Water Temperance movement; and Farielle, daughter of one of the first free Black coal-miners in Kentucky. While Dallin struggles to find a way to pay for his father's mistakes and keep the liquor flowing, Farielle wants to skip town and get away from the likes of Mr Finchley, local bigwig, and his nefarious side-kick, Topper, while Adalyn longs do God's work and close the tavern for good.\n\nAs their fortunes collide, the surreal presence of the fish and two little girls who accompany it, bears down on them; secrets are revealed, and soon they realize that they're all related to an act of arson and murder.\n\nDeath and redemption stalk them all, leading to a climax of biblical proportions.\n\nThe Ensemble:\n\nWritten by Tegan Mcleod\n\nDirection by Lily Wolff\n\nDesign by Bruno-Pierre Houle\n\nPerformances by Bria Washington, Ursula Walker, Nate Jackson, Huck Huckaby, Reagan Tankersley, Juliet Robb, Quevetter Terrell and Judd Farris.\n\nThe Cold Water Army\n\nby Tegan McLeod\n\nMichener Center writer Tegan McLeod's play receives its first staging at the Back Pack, Wednesday - Saturday at 8 p.m. and March 1, Sunday, at 5 p.m.\n\nThe Perks:\n\nAlso featuring libations on the patio pre-preformance and informal post-show talks at the bar.
