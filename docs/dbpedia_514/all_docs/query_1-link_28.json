        "text": "A team of Defense Logistics Agency Europe and Africa service members recently competed in an obstacle race at Ramstein Air Base, Germany.\n\nThe “Guardians of the Strategic Gateway,” comprising Marine Lt. Col. Ian Galbraith, Air Force Maj. Brian Jorgensen, Army Maj. Tracy Yates, Navy Lt. Brent Cohen and Air Force Master Sgt. Thomas Baah, completed the Ramstein Mudder May 24.\n\nThe event was a challenging 2.5-mile course of 16 obstacles, including assisted and unassisted wall climbs, low crawls, a tire carry, tire mounds and pools of cold water.\n\n“It’s more than just having fun, getting dirty and competing,” Yates said. “It’s about the camaraderie, teamwork and resiliency that participating in an event like this builds.”"
