        "text": "**Shaheen secured a total of $100,404,000 in direct investments for the Granite State in twelve Committee-passed government funding bills**\n\n(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a senior member of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee and Chair of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, highlighted the numerous priorities she championed and secured in the bipartisan Fiscal Year 2025 (FY 25) government funding bills recently passed by the Committee. In these bills, which Shaheen helped craft, she secured critical investments to strengthen workforce development programs, support affordable housing construction, bolster child care and early education and more.\n\n“The bipartisan bills we’ve passed out of the Appropriations Committee would be impactful for my home state of New Hampshire and all of America,” said Shaheen, Chair of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies. “If signed into law, these bills would help achieve critical priorities by making direct investments that will help combat the ongoing substance use disorder crisis, lowering costs for families, creating strong, good-paying jobs and increasing affordable housing. I’m also proud that we were able to secure 20,000 additional Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who stood with American troops and diplomats during the war in Afghanistan.”\n\nBelow is a list of Shaheen-secured priorities in all of the FY 25 appropriations bills:\n\nShaheen-Secured Priorities in the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2025\n\nLowering Home Energy Costs\n\nA longtime champion of energy efficiency, Senator Shaheen secured a $17 million increase in funding for work to improve the effectiveness and affordability of energy efficient technologies—like heat pumps and building envelope technologies—for new home construction and retrofitting older homes. The bill also provides $371 million for weatherization programs that lower home heating and other energy bills for low-income households, including $35 million for the weatherization readiness fund that supports structural improvements to allow for energy efficiency upgrades.\n\nSupporting Coastal Communities\n\nSupporting our coastal communities, Shaheen secured $329,178,000 in funding for small harbor maintenance, including dredging, by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. A $151,178,000 increase from the current level, this funding will help ensure safe navigation in New Hampshire’s harbors for both commercial and recreational vessels. Shaheen has long championed Army Corps projects in New Hampshire, ensuring Seacoast communities reap the full benefits of well-maintained harbors.\n\nNorthern Border Regional Commission\n\nShaheen secured $46 million for the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC)—the highest level ever included in annual government funding legislation. The NBRC is a vital federal-state partnership for economic and community development that provides grant funding to communities within Belknap, Carroll, Cheshire, Coos, Grafton and Sullivan counties. Shaheen has led efforts in Congress that support and invest in the NBRC and included her bipartisan legislation to reauthorize and expand the NBRC’s reach in the Farm Bill that was signed into law in 2018. This legislation expanded the NBRC to include Cheshire County and communities in Belknap County. Shaheen also worked to include language to ensure portions of NBRC funds be directed to assist rural communities affected by past mill closures, as well as support new markets and the infrastructure needs of the forest products industry. Last year, Shaheen, alongside Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), reintroduced the NBRC Reauthorization Act of 2023. Congresswoman Kuster led this legislation in the House, which would extend the authorization of the NBRC for another ten years and allow NBRC funding to support healthcare, childcare and housing development projects.\n\nShaheen-Secured Priorities in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2025\n\nPFAS Testing and Remediation\n\nSenator Shaheen has spearheaded efforts in Congress to uncover the potential health effects related to PFAS contamination, respond to the chemical exposure and remediate polluted sites around military bases. The bill includes Shaheen’s request for $5 million to fund the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry’s Multi-Site PFAS health study. Additionally, it includes over $980 million for the military services to remediate drinking water contaminated by PFAS—an increase of $130 million over the President’s Budget for Fiscal Year 2025—as a result of Shaheen’s leadership on the Defense Subcommittee.\n\nAdditionally, the bill includes a requirement for the Department of Defense to sustain its engagement with PFAS-affected communities and collaborate directly with localities to develop prompt and innovative solutions to mitigate the effects of PFAS contamination on drinking water.\n\nSupporting Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and the Shipbuilding Industrial Base\n\nAs a co-chair of the U.S. Senate Navy Caucus and a senior member of the Defense Subcommittee and U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Shaheen is New Hampshire’s strongest advocate for the shipyard and Navy shipbuilding programs. The bill fully funds the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan (SIOP), including the funding needed to complete dry dock projects at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. The bill also includes $795 million for the SIOP above the President’s Budget, which will help to increase submarine maintenance availability at Portsmouth and across the country.\n\nThe bill fully funds the COLUMBIA-class submarine program at $3.36 billion and includes $375 million above the President’s Budget Request for the Virginia-class program. This additional funding will directly support Virginia-class program suppliers in New England. Finally, the bill includes $1 billion for submarine supplier development funding – which supports workforce development for the submarine supplier base in New Hampshire, including with the Community College Systems of New Hampshire and businesses such as Granite State Manufacturing.\n\nStanding with Partners and Allies\n\nSenator Shaheen helped to create the Eastern European Training Initiative as part of the FY 19 NDAA\n\nand has been a steadfast supporter of the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), a unique authority that allows the Department of Defense (DoD) to put equipment on contract directly for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Building on her provision in the FY25 Senate-passed NDAA to provide additional flexibility to USAI, the U.S. Senate Appropriations bill funds the program at $300 million through FY26.\n\nThe FY 25 NDAA also created a new Indo-Pacific Security Assistance Initiative, which will allow the U.S. to train and equip Indo-Pacific partners by putting capabilities from U.S. manufacturers on contract with DoD. The Defense Appropriations bill supported by Shaheen funds this new program at $500 million.\n\nContinued Investments in New Hampshire’s Aerospace and Defense Industry\n\nAs a result of Senator Shaheen’s leadership for New Hampshire’s aerospace industry, the bill fully funds work done in Londonderry on L3 Harris’s Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular and funds six additional F-15EX aircraft above the President’s Budget Request. It also fully funds the KC-46 refueling tanker, flown by the New Hampshire National Guard’s 157th Air Refueling Wing; and funds the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The bill also includes a $63 million increase from Shaheen for the Improved Turbine Engine Program, which will support work on the program done in Hooksett.\n\nFinally, the bill includes a $32 billion increase requested by Shaheen for the APEX Accelerators Program, which assists small businesses in New Hampshire with procurement opportunities with the Department of Defense.\n\nImplementing the Women, Peace and Security Act\n\nShaheen successfully secured $12 million to fund the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Act across the Department of Defense, military services, Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff. Shaheen authored the Women, Peace and Security Act in 2017 and recently reauthorized DoD’s ability to conduct security cooperation under WPS in the Committee-passed FY25 NDAA.\n\nShaheen-Secured Priorities in the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2025\n\nBoosting Efforts to Address the Substance Use Disorder Crisis\n\nA longtime champion of increasing funding to address the ongoing substance use disorder crisis, Senator Shaheen secured a $120 million increase for the Substance Use Prevention, Treatment and Recovery Services Block Grant. Shaheen also secured $25 million in increased funding for both the State Opioid Response grant program and the Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Loan Repayment Program.\n\nInvesting in Child Care and Early Education\n\nAs the child care crisis persists in New Hampshire and across the country, Shaheen helped secure a $2.3 billion increase for federal child care programs, including a $1.7 billion increase for the Child Care and Development Block Grants (for a total of $10.3 billion) and a $700 million increase for Head Start (for a total of $12.97 billion). Earlier this year, Shaheen, a leader in advocating for resources to support child care providers and families, secured a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act to expand child care access for military families, which is based off her bipartisan bill, the Expanding Access to Child Care for Military Families Act, to help build a strong child care workforce and make long-term investments in child care providers. She also reintroduced her Right Start Child Care and Education Act, which would reform the federal tax code to make child care more affordable and accessible for working families. Last year, Shaheen took to the Senate floor urging Congress to pass President Biden’s request for $16 billion to support child care stabilization grants in the domestic supplemental funding request.\n\nProtecting Investments in Workforce Development\n\nMaintaining key investments that support job training and help connect Granite Staters with good jobs, Shaheen secured $2.9 billion for Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) formula grants and $290 million for Registered Apprenticeships. The Registered Apprenticeships Program supports an industry-driven, high-quality career pathway where employers can develop and prepare their future workforce, and individuals can obtain paid work experience with a mentor, receive progressive wage increases, classroom instruction and a portable, nationally-recognized credential. In January, Shaheen joined Senator Hassan and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for a tour of the Painters’ Finishing Trades Institute of New England and to meet with apprentices training in the finishing trades.\n\nShaheen-Secured Priorities in the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2025\n\nSupporting Small Businesses\n\nAs a long-time leader on small business issues and Chair of the U.S. Senate Small Business Committee, Senator Shaheen secured a $61 million increase to Small Business Administration funding in FY 25, including increased support for small business exporters, entrepreneurial development and disaster assistance. She also worked to include language supporting small business owners doing succession planning for how to pass on their businesses and language to improve support for rural small businesses.\n\nFighting to Protect Mail Service for New Hampshire\n\nSenator Shaheen has long been concerned about the Postmaster General’s harmful changes to the U.S. Postal Service that are negatively impacting Granite Staters. She secured language in this Act expressing concern about the impact of these changes on mail delivery across the country and encouraging increased oversight of the Postal Service’s plans. Senator Shaheen previously helped introduce bicameral, bipartisan legislation that would prohibit USPS from consolidating, closing or downgrading a processing and distribution center if it would leave a state without one or negatively impact mail delivery across a state. In February, the entire New Hampshire congressional delegation sent a letter to Postmaster General DeJoy expressing concerns about plans for the Manchester Processing and Distribution Center, noting that they could be damaging to mail service in New Hampshire. She also joined her Senate colleagues in a bipartisan letter calling on the Postal Service to pause planned changes to its processing and delivery network until potential impacts are further studied by the Postal Regulatory Commission and addressed by the Postal Service.\n\nMissing Armed Forces and Civilian Personnel\n\nSenator Shaheen has long been committed to helping the families of prisoners of war (POWs) and those missing in action (MIA). She has been leading on this issue through her bipartisan bill with Senator Crapo, the Bring Our Heroes Home Act, which would eliminate obstacles preventing families and caseworkers from accessing the records needed for recovering America’s POWs and MIA. According to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, more than 81,500 Americans remain unaccounted for from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Cold War, the Gulf Wars and other conflicts. Parallel to this effort, Senator Shaheen obtained $2 million for National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in FY 24 for the agency to make publicly available records related to missing Armed Forces and civilian personnel. In this year’s bill, she secured language directing NARA to work with federal agencies to collect and release those records that can be released.\n\nShaheen-Secured Priorities in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2025\n\nPreserving Rural Housing\n\nSenator Shaheen has led efforts to preserve affordable housing in rural communities for nearly a decade. In this bill, she secured an expanded program to keep rural housing well-maintained and ensure senior and low-income households can keep rental assistance. This builds on her work to get key provisions of her Strategy and Investment in Rural Housing Preservation Act signed into law earlier this year.\n\nSupporting Snow Survey Expansion to New England\n\nThe bill includes Senator Shaheen’s request for $2 million for the Northeast expansion effort within the NRCS Snow Survey Program to allow funds to be used both for the completion of the ongoing feasibility study as well as to begin implementation of the expansion of this program. Shaheen secured the initial $1 million for this study in FY 23, and continued funding was included in FY 24. Shaheen has also introduced the bipartisan Snow Survey Northeast Expansion Act to establish a network of snow and water monitoring stations across the Northeast to track mountain snow accumulation and precipitation rates.\n\nImproving Crop Insurance for New England Farmers\n\nThe bill includes Shaheen's requested language expressing concern about crop insurance policies’ underserving New England growers, emphasizing USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA)’s authority to design crop insurance policies that reflect regional differences in growing and marketing practices. The language expresses support for USDA’s decision to convene a working group of New England apple growers to, in line with Shaheen’s urging, help better inform future policies and encourages RMA to consider convening similar efforts for regional growers of other crops.\n\nShaheen-Secured Priorities in the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2025\n\nSecuring Vital Funding for Economic Development, Trade and Manufacturing\n\nCJS Chair Shaheen secured $100 million for Economic Development Administration’s (EDA) Tech Hubs Program, a $59 million increase above the FY 24 enacted level, to support additional Tech Hubs implementation grants like the one Shaheen helped advocate for that went to ReGen Valley Tech Hub earlier this year. Shaheen also secured continued funding for EDA's partnership with the Northern Border Regional Commission and its Assistance for Biomass Closure Communities program—programs that are particularly impactful in the North Country.\n\nStrengthening America’s Leadership in Space Exploration and Innovation\n\nTo strengthen America’s continued leadership in space, Shaheen helped secure $7.65 billion for NASA Exploration, $30 million more than the President’s budget request, to keep making progress on the Artemis missions and $812 million within NASA Science for heliophysics research, a $7 million increase above the FY 24 enacted level and $25 million above the President’s budget request. This amount includes $39 million for the HelioSwarm mission led by University of New Hampshire. The Committee-passed bill includes $5 million for NASA’s innovative nanomaterial research and $2.369 billion for Earth Science including full funding for UNH’s Geosynchronous Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer (GLIMR) instrument.\n\nProtecting Survivors of Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence\n\nShaheen secured multiple provisions that build on her work protecting survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and online crimes. Namely, Senator Shaheen secured $739.5 million, the highest funding level ever, for grants authorized by the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). This includes $10 million for continued implementation of her Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights grant program, $56 million for legal assistance for victims, $54 million for transitional housing assistance and $750,000 for a National Institute of Justice study on online crimes against children.\n\nThe bill also releases $1.9 billion from the Crime Victims Fund (CVF), providing $400 million above the President’s budget request and restoring grants to FY 23 enacted levels. The CVF provides critical support through direct assistance and programs offered by victim service providers to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, human trafficking and other violent crimes.\n\nBolsters Support for Ocean Research and Conservation Efforts\n\nShaheen secured many key resources to invest in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other initiatives to support the Granite State’s fisheries, ocean research and conservation efforts, including, but not limited to:\n\n$10 million for the NOAA Center of Excellence for Operational Ocean and Great Lakes Mapping that builds on the NOAA-UNH existing partnership through the Joint Hydrographic Center/ Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping;\n\n$13.5 million to ensure Northeast fisheries observer coverage;\n\n$1.5 million for new workforce training and research partnership between NOAA National Weather Service and the Mount Washington Observatory;\n\n$5 million for the second year of a NOAA aquaculture cooperative institute; and\n\n$700,000 increase for the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (which supports Great Bay).\n\nFull list of CJS-related wins can be found here.\n\nShaheen-Secured Priorities in the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2025\n\nInvesting in Clean Water\n\nTo support drinking water and wastewater infrastructure upgrades in communities throughout the Granite State and fund projects to improve water quality in lakes, rivers and streams, Shaheen helped secure a total of $2.76 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) and Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF). In addition to this funding, the DWSRF and CWSRF will receive more than $9 billion in supplemental funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Continuing her longstanding work to address PFAS, Senator Shaheen once again secured language ensuring states can use critical funding she fought for in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to assist private well owners in addressing PFAS and other dangerous contaminants.\n\nBolstering Outdoor Recreation and Forest-Based Economies\n\nAs a longtime champion of outdoor recreation and land conservation, Shaheen worked to ensure implementation of the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) though this bill. The Interior Appropriations bill allocates $900 million from the Land and Water Conservation (LWCF), including $2 million for the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge and $1.5 million for the Great Thicket National Wildlife Refuge. New Hampshire will also receive a portion of the nearly $300 million for LWCF stateside assistance programs that provide formula funding to New Hampshire and competitive grant opportunities to New Hampshire cities for parks, forests and other outdoor recreation development. The bill also allocates $1.9 billion to address backlogged maintenance needs through the National Parks and Public Lands Legacy Restoration Fund, including $15 million for trail restoration along the Appalachian Trail in New England and additional funding for the White Mountain National Forest.\n\nShaheen also helped boost funding for state and private forestry, as well as research and development in national forests. Shaheen secured language directing the U.S. Forest Service to prioritize staffing at longstanding research at experimental forests like the Bartlett Experimental Forest in New Hampshire that benefits forest health, as well as the forest products industry that is the backbone of many rural communities.\n\nShaheen-Secured Priorities in the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2025\n\nCompensation and Pension Examinations\n\nVeterans undergo compensation and pension (C&P) exams so that the extent of their disability can be determined for purposes of benefits. C&P examinations continue to be a source of frustration with New Hampshire’s veterans because the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has outsourced many C&P examinations to outside providers. These providers often require veterans to travel long distances, including into neighboring states on occasion. Veterans have expressed displeasure with being unable to receive these exams at the VA, the inability to reschedule examinations and the lack of meaningful recourse through the VA or the contractors themselves. The Committee included Senator Shaheen’s language on third-party contractors who conduct C&P Examinations. She secured language in last year’s bill directing that the VA collect a range of data on the distances and problems veterans have reported to in obtaining C&P Examinations. Notably, the language directs the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) to review its contracts with these providers to utilize the terms of the contract to institute more robust oversight mechanisms, including a process by which veterans can lodge complaints with VBA that the agency then resolves directly with the contractor.\n\nCracking Down on Unaccredited Coaches and Consultants\n\nSenator Shaheen has heard from New Hampshire veterans about so-called claims coaches and consultants who are charging veterans exorbitant rates to file initial benefits claims. In February 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) said “there has been an influx of predatory advertisements, which purport to help Veterans—often through the guise of “medical consulting” or “benefits coaching”—submit their initial claims to the VA for a fee.” The CFPB and VA noted that “unauthorized assistance in claim preparation is illegal” and said that “[w]e have heard reports that unscrupulous actors have misled some veterans into paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal fees.” Senator Shaheen secured report language directing the VA Office of General Counsel to institute a system of reporting unaccredited attorneys who file initial benefits claims for veterans to their state bar associations for discipline. This follows the letter Senator Shaheen led to the Federal Trade Commission asking that the agency use its powers to investigate the VA benefits coaches and consultant's market.\n\nDelivering for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and New Hampshire National Guard:\n\nSenator Shaheen secured full funding for the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan project at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. Additionally, she delivered on two Congressionally Directed Spending requests for the New Hampshire National Guard: $1.2 million in design funding for a new Lakota hangar, including environmental upgrades; and $6.5 million in construction funding for alterations to the Pembroke Readiness Center.\n\nSenators Shaheen and Collins secured a $9.5 million Congressionally Directed Spending add for a new parking structure at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard—which will contribute to quality of life for PNSY’s workforce.\n\nShaheen-Secured Priorities in the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2025\n\nSupporting Innovative Transportation Projects\n\nThe package includes $550 million for the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grant program—a $205 million increase over the current enacted level. This funding is in addition to $1.5 billion for RAISE in FY 25 that Senator Shaheen helped secure as a lead negotiator of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Since 2012, the RAISE program, previously known as BUILD/TIGER, has provided over $95 million for projects across New Hampshire.\n\nIncreasing Affordable Housing\n\nTo help address New Hampshire’s severe need for affordable housing, Senator Shaheen secured two provisions to accelerate affordable housing construction in New Hampshire by removing delays and duplication in permitting and approval processes at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. These programs will make federal funding more effective in building the 60,000 units of housing New Hampshire is estimated to need by 2030.\n\nSenator Shaheen also worked to include $100 million for grants to state and local governments to reduce local barriers to housing construction and fought to increase funding for HOME Investment Partnerships to $1.425 billion to secure the capital needed. In addition, she pushed to increase funding for Housing Choice Vouchers by $2.9 billion to $35.3 billion and Homeless Assistance Grants by $220 million to $4.3 billion.\n\nShaheen-Secured Priorities in the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2025\n\nProtecting Afghan Allies\n\nShaheen secured bipartisan support for the Afghan SIV program with 20,000 additional visas provided in the State Foreign Operations (SFOPS) bill. Shaheen has championed efforts in Congress to provide a pathway to safety for those Afghans who stood alongside U.S. troops and diplomats in Afghanistan. The amendment extends the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program for two years through 2027. The amendment responds to findings Shaheen released in a 2022 comprehensive report on the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa Program and builds on efforts by the State Department and Congress to improve the efficiency of the application process.\n\nSupport for Women and Girls Around the World\n\nSenator Shaheen continues to be a leading voice on global women’s issues because she recognizes that empowered women build stronger, more stable families and communities. The SFOPS bill includes $600 million in bilateral funding for international family planning assistance, which if signed into law would be the first increase in funding in over a decade. The funding, in addition to an increase in funds for the United Nations Population Fund, goes to programs that support the sexual and reproductive health of women. An additional $150 million in funding from the SFOPS bill will be programmed toward implementing Shaheen’s Women, Peace and Security Act, which ensures women are included in peace negotiations and conflict resolution around the world.\n\nEnhancing Assistance to Europe and Supporting Democracy\n\nAs the Chair of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation, Shaheen continues to prioritize much-needed assistance for European countries that are on the frontlines in the global fight for democracy. Shaheen secured funding to counter malign Russian influence, improve U.S. investments in the region and support democratic institutions and reform efforts in nations including Belarus, Georgia and Moldova. Shaheen also secured over $850 million in funding for the Assistance to Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia (AEECA) account.\n\nShaheen secured the following Congressional Directed Funding for New Hampshire – Totaling $100,404,000\n\n###"
