        "text": "Dallas, Texas (July 17, 2024) – As power is close to being totally restored across Houston and the surrounding area, The Salvation Army’s feeding operations are steadily scaling back and transitioning to distribution support. Multiple supply distributions are planned throughout the area in the coming days.\n\nThe Salvation Army Emergency Disaster Services (EDS) team is working to support several local supply distributions, beginning with The Salvation Army location in Freeport (1618 N Avenue J, Freeport, TX 77541) on Wednesday, several school district and apartment complex distributions later in the week, and is partnering with Valero on Thursday. Food boxes containing a week’s supply of non-perishable food, cleanup kits consisting of a bucket, gloves, broom, mop, bleach, mask, scrubbing brush and more, and cases of water will be available at distribution sites.\n\n“As power is restored this week in neighborhoods across the city, we have seen a steady decline in the need for hot meals. This is a good sign that people are finally getting back on their feet and returning to normal,” said Alvin Migues, The Salvation Army EDS Director for Texas. “Our trained staff, volunteers and Baptist partners have worked so hard this week in incredibly hot and humid conditions. More than 70,000 people have received nutritious hot meals, cold water, prayer and encouragement each day from The Salvation Army teams. Ten mobile feeding units will continue to serve meals in strategic locations on Wednesday and as the week continues, we expect to scale back meal service and concentrate our efforts to support supply distributions.”\n\nFeeding operations on Wednesday will take place in the following locations:\n\nCity Hall - 6243 Brookside Rd., Pearland, TX 77581\n\nHarris County -Pasadena Interfaith Manor - 2112 Easthaven Drive, Pasadena TX 77506\n\nHarris County -La Esencia Apartments - 300 N. Vista Drive, Houston 77073\n\nHarris County -Painted Tree Boutique - 1153 Kingwood Drive, Kingwood, TX 77339\n\nHarris County -Springs of Living Water Church. 5901 Treaschwig Rd., Spring TX 77373\n\nHarris County -Bridging for Tomorrow Parking Lot - 5359 West Richey Rd., Houston 77066\n\nHarris County -Forest Vista Mobile Home Park - 600 McCabe Rd., La Porte TX\n\nHarris County -7321 Harrisburg Blvd, Houston, TX 77011\n\nHarris County -Higher Expectation Church- 702 Atascocita Rd., Atascocita, TX 77396\n\nHarris County -Pleasant Hill Village Retirement Center - 3814 Lyons Ave., Houston\n\nHarris County -Pleasantville Senior Center 1922 Pleasantville Dr, Houston, 77029 (Delivery only)\n\nHarris County - Center of Hope Houston (Delivery only)\n\nHarris County -Pine Trails 6003 Woodbend Drive, Houston 77049 (Delivery only)\n\nMontgomery County -County Shelters in Conroe\n\nCenterPoint Energy Foundation has made a donation to support The Salvation Army and other disaster organization’s relief efforts after Hurricane Beryl. Their practical assistance will offset the costs of more than 80,000 meals. “Thank you, CenterPoint Energy Foundation for your generation donation and support of The Salvation Army as we meet the needs of those impacted by the storm in Houston and beyond.”\n\nThe Salvation Army has served 68,270 meals, 59,981 drinks, 10,118 snacks, 2,820 bags of ice, 961 food boxes, and made 9,999 Emotional and Spiritual Care contacts since service began on Tuesday, July 9 in affected communities across Houston and SE Texas."
