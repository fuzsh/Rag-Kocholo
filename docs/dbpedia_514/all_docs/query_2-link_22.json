His songs like the No. 1 PLATINUM hit \"There Was This Girl,\" the 2X-PLATINUM-certified heart-tugger \"I Wish Grandpas Never Died\" (which he performed live at the 55th ACM Awards), and his chart-topping collab with Thomas Rhett, \"Half of Me,\" have made Riley synonymous with what Country music does best: making listeners feel something with his no-gimmick, relatable writing and classic feel.\n\nAs an avid sports fan, former athlete (Jacksonville State University quarterback) and outdoorsman, Riley is riding a wave of success after being named the Academy of Country Music's 2020 New Male Artist of the Year, a former MusicRow Breakout Artist of the Year, a CMT \"Listen Up Artist,\" and one of CRS's 2020 New Faces.\n\nNow playing to an average of 65,000 fans each night serving as direct support for Morgan Allen and Luke Combs in 2023, Green headlined the Rock The South festival and is selling out his own headlining shows.

Luke Combs),\" the title track to Riley's 2019 debut album that he re-recorded with Combs after seeing how fans connected to it.\n\nHis new album Ain't My Last Rodeo, produced by Dan Huff, is more of the signature Riley Green fans have come to know and love from the good ol' boy who still lives in his hometown of Jacksonville, AL.\n\nT.I.\n\nAbout T.I.\n\nWebsite | Facebook | Instagram\n\nAside from his contributions in entertainment including 11 hit albums, multiple Grammy's, Billboard BET and American Music Awards, countless blockbuster movies and top-rated television shows including ATL, VH-1's T.I. and Tiny: The Family Hustle, American Gangster, Marvel's Ant-Man, and made his 2023 directorial debut with his 100% independent comedy \"Da 'Partments,\" to name a few, Tip \"T.I.\" Harris has made an indelible mark on the world of business.\n\nHe is an artist, entrepreneur, and activist who has amassed a business empire to include a record label, a 10-year-old clothing line (Akoo, which stands for \"A King of Oneself\"), a real estate holdings company, production company, non-profit organization (Us or Else), owner/founder of Trap Music Museum, co-owner of Bankhead Seafood, owner of Super Sound Studios, investor, and much more.\n\nHarris served on the Mayor of Atlanta's Transition Team, where he focused on policy and legislation; and currently serves on the Reimagining Atlanta Task Force, aimed at creating restorative practices and a community-driven approach to addressing incarceration. He has been recognized most recently as a thought leader at the United States Capitol and during the Operation Hope, as well as during the Congressional Black Caucus, and Forbes Magazine business conferences. His community focus is around driving economic mobility and equity in vulnerable, underserved communities. Harris was also awarded the first-ever \"Voice of the Culture\" award by ASCAP and is the host of a #1 rated podcast, expediTIously with Tip \"T.I.\" Harris.\n\nT.I. is also currently working on two albums, titled Kiss the King and Kill the King.
