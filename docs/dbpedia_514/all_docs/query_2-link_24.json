        "text": "Hometown Heroes Class of 2023\n\nAt the Wednesday, May 24, 2023 Town Board meeting, Councilmember Louise Daniele and the Town Board saluted the inaugural class of Hometown Heroes! The heroes gathered at Town Hall and were honored with a slide show featuring the banners of all 93 honored heroes, and a special Certificate of Recognition from the Town Board.\n\nThe Town's banner program includes service members from conflicts dating from World War II, through the Korean and Vietnam Wars, Cold War conflicts including the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Gulf War, and recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nService members being honored served in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Army Air Corps and the National Guard, and served in legendary units such as the venerable 101st Airborne Division \"Screaming Eagles,\" the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry, the indomitable \"Big Red One\" of the 1st Infantry Division, and the decorated \"First Team\" 1st Cavalry Division.\n\nFishkill's heroes include reservists, special forces soldiers, service academy graduates, reconnaissance photographers, individuals killed in combat and while on active duty, a husband and wife couple, and some who are still in the service today. These men and women served with honor and distinction and are part of the rich history of military service in the Town of Fishkill, and the Town of Fishkill is proud to congratulate each and every member of the inaugural class of Fishkill's Hometown Heroes.\n\n​\n\nTo all the Town of Fishkill Hometown Heroes, we thank you for your service and sacrifice, and we are honored to honor you today and always.
