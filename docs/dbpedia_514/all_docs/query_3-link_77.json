        "text": "Five soldiers with the Alaska Army National Guard returned here May 16 after assisting the Interior Alaska community of Manley Hot Springs for four days after the region received significant ice-breakup flooding from the Tanana River.\n\nThe Guardsmen focused on debris removal from a dozen private homes including removing flood damaged food, appliances and other household goods and items from flooded basements, deploying de-watering pumps to remove water from basements and cellars, transporting debris to the local landfill, and assisting community members with the restacking of firewood that had drifted away during the flood.\n\nSpc. Kyle Johnson, a military policeman with the 297th Military Police Company, from Wasilla, said while there was a lot of muscle movement the experience was extremely rewarding.\n\n“It’s one thing to wear our uniforms day-to-day for a full-time job or for drill weekend but there is another feeling when you put it on for its intended purpose – to show a sense of symbolism that there is something bigger out there that is here to help.”\n\nJohnson, who responded to other state missions including the Shovel Creek Fire in 2019 and COVID-19 in 2021, said that the reward comes from being someone community members can lean and rely on.\n\nWhile Johnson has now been activated by the state three times and served on a deployment to Poland with the AKNG, this was the first activation for Pvt. Frederica Rivers, a food service specialist with the 207th Engineer Utilities Detachment, from Scammon Bay.\n\n“I just returned from basic and [advanced individual training] last October,” said Rivers, who attributed one of her reasons for joining the AKNG as the opportunity to give back to communities in Alaska. “It felt good being able to give back, and I will definitely volunteer to go again if I am needed.”\n\nRivers and the other task force members, all from the AKARNG’s 297th Regional Support Group, shared grief with the community as they trudged through debris and learned about memories from locals."
