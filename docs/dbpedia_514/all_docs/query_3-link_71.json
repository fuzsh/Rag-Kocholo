The following methods can help cool a person or reduce their heat intake until medical help arrives. Whenever you apply rapid cooling, it is important to request medical assistance immediately, continuously monitor the individual, and stop the cooling if the person begins to shiver.\n\nWhen in doubt, chill them out!\n\nGood Method\n\nWet Clothing\n\nWet clothing is a simple way to cool an overheated person. While the person is resting:\n\nGive them water to drink\n\nRemove any outer layers or unnecessary clothing, especially items likes belts, socks and shoes\n\nElevate their feet\n\nSplash them with cool water while also fanning them and elevating their feet\n\nBetter Method\n\nIce Sheets\n\nIce sheets use ordinary bed sheets soaked in ice water to cool the person. Refresh the sheets with cold water every one to three minutes once the sheets warm up.\n\nIce Packs\n\nIce packs can cool a person effectively when placed in the appropriate locations. If possible, use this method while using ice sheets.\n\nBest Method\n\nCold Water Bath\n\nCold water bath is the most effective cooling method, but it requires a tub, stock tank, or childâ€™s pool half filled with water and ice.\n\nTACO Method\n\nTACO method requires less equipment than the cold water bath and may be easier in the field, as it only requires a tarp and a water cooler. Place the individual on the tarp, have a few individuals hold the edges up, pour in ice water then use the tarp to slosh the water over the individual."
