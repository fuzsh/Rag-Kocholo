        "text": "A postponed attack, lax reconnaissance, battle fatigue, and lack of coordination among the commanders, all led to defeat for Grant at Cold Harbor. Grant's decision to postpone the attack on June 2 when Hancock’s troops failed to arrive gave the Confederates time to entrench and strengthen their defenses. And although Grant had directed the Union corps commanders to examine the ground and perfect their plans, they had done neither. They failed to disclose important swamps and other terrain features, and the separate corps did not coordinate with one another. The men were exhausted from the arduous campaign and their ranks were diminished. There was friction between Maj. Gen. Meade and General-in-Chief Grant and the responsibility of who would command the attack was unclear. Grant apparently expected Meade to supervise the assaults, but Meade hung back. The army had no leader. Only the Second Corps and parts of the Eighteenth and Ninth Corps—perhaps twenty thousand Federal troops—were actively engaged.\n\nGrant’s decision to attack on June 3 was an unmitigated disaster. The Federals met with heavy fire and suffered significant casualties. They were only able to reach the Confederate trenches in a few places. A Confederate later described Cold Harbor as \"perhaps the easiest victory ever granted to the Confederate arms by the folly of the Federal commanders.\" One of Meade’s aides described the sad aftermath of the Union failure, during which the opposing armies slept “almost within a stone’s throw of one another,” with “the separating space ploughed by cannon shot, and dotted with dead bodies that neither side dared bury.\"\n\nThe Federals turned the two-story home of Margaret and Miles Garthwright into a field hospital to take in casualties during the battle of Cold Harbor. It was the second time the Garthwrights found their property requisitioned, the first being during the Battle of Gaines’ Mill in 1862. Miles Garthright was a Confederate soldier whose cavalry unit saw action around Cold Harbor early in the battle.\n\nAs Union surgeons received maimed soldiers at her home in June 1864, Mrs. Garthright took refuge in the basement, where “with fear and trembling” she watched as blood dripped through the cracks in the floor and into the cellar. Those who survived were transported by rail and steamer to army hospitals in Washington. But many were not that lucky. At least 97 soldiers died from their wounds at Garthwright House and received temporary burial in the front yard. Two years later, the Cold Harbor National Cemetery opened across the road and work crews reburied all of the Union dead there.\n\nCaptain Edward Hill of the Sixteenth Michigan Volunteers was shot in action on June 1 at Cold Harbor. His regiment did not expect him to survive. Hill’s experience, documented in the following diary entries, reveals how casualties were handled during the Civil War. The wounded captain was placed on a stretcher and taken to a makeshift field hospital, where he was examined and, according to his friend Private Jack Wood, \"left to die.\" But Hill persevered. Wood arranged for an army wagon to take Hill to White House Landing on the Pamunkey River. Hill suffered excruciating pain on the wagon journey to the wharf at White House, where Wood placed him on a steamer bound for Washington, D.C. Hill, who was treated at Armory Square Hospital in the capital, eventually recovered.\n\nWednesday, June 1\n\nAn alarm last night. I had charge of the Picket line on the left. This morning the 16 ordered to advance. carried the enemies rifle Pitts and advanced to the brow of the Hill, when I was shot in the right thigh. alas poor Yorick-\n\nThursday, June 2\n\nSuffered terribly from my operation yesterday the ball having passed through the flesh of the hip going also entirely through the Ilium bone from this point the surgeon has been unable to trace it, but I know what he thinks. He thinks that it has passed into the bowels and that I will die.\n\nFriday, June 3\n\nWe moved yesterday in ambulances the enemy occupying the ground one hour after we left Jack Wood stuk (sic) his head in the ambulance last night and inquired for me. I was almost dead. He immediately commenced rousing me. This morning Lieut Long of Gen Bartletts staff brought in. Racked(?) up in Army wagons for White House this P.M.\n\nSaturday, June 4\n\nMoved last night from Hospital in Army Wagons for White House under rugged roads. night, the drivers drunk we came near dying The Train, bivouwacked 3 miles from W. Moved in the morning after Lieut. Long & self gone the Surgeon, in his knowledge of duty, had been stopped by 2 Corps train carried to Hospital borne on stretcher to Steamer Wenonah\n\nSunday, June 5\n\nPassed a wretched night. Started at daylight down the river suffered excruciating pain all day. No Drs on board who appear to take interest in me, nothing to eat only what Jack forages. Passed Yorktown today, but not strength enough to look out of the window at it.\n\nMonday, June 6\n\nEasier this morning but filled with Hope because we are at new home. Arrived at W.[ashington] 6th St. Wharf at 10 ordered back to Alexandria. Urged to go to W. placed in Tug arrived at W. at 3 lay in the wharf til 7 then carried in Trade wagon to Armory Square Hospital."
