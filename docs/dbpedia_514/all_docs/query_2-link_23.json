He served in the Gulf from Jan 07 to Sept. 07. He starts his 2nd (unknown) tour of duty again this January. This tour will be hard for him because since his last tour he and his wife have had a baby. Brayden is 2 months old. I know Justin is thinking about all of the accomplishments that Brayden will make while he's gone & going to miss: that first tooth, seeing him sit up for the first time. . . simply watching him grow. I just hope he knows how very proud we all are of him and how anxious I am to hold that new baby.\n\nIn honor of Sergeant First Class E-7 Rex Allen, Army\n\nHometown: Barbourville, KY (Submitted November 4, 2008 by Teanna Allen)\n\nRex has been my husband for five years now and I have watched him grow through his years in the service.

My thoughts remind me of Art Altman, who enjoyed the harvest, running machines and all that goes with it. Art is no longer with us, a member of the \"great generation\" called upon to serve our country in times of great peril. He participated in the D-day invasion. Art never said much about those times, except to mention the close calls he had survived. I picked up my button at Farm Fest. I wear it proudly In honor of Art. He enabled me to wear it. This election is of utmost importance, and each vote counts. One vote decided to give the Nazi party leadership to Adolf Hitler. I wear my button humbly, proudly, respectfully, and ask the readers to VOTE. Regards.

My dad was in the tank corps, but he started his training on horses in North Carolina because there were no tanks available for training yet. Once overseas he was part of the D Day invasion. It was literally a case of 'bringing coals to Newcastle,' as he grew up on the northeast coast of Britain (near Newcastle!). His father, a shipbuilder, moved the family to New York in 1931 during the Great Depression looking for work. There wasn't any. My dad spent some time with General Patton and survived. Patton was notorious for the way he used his tank corps hard. My dad won a Bronze Star for his actions in the taking of Hitler's Eagles Nest, the Berchtesgaden. He was also part of the second unit to find the Dachau Concentration Camp. He never talked about either of these events or much about the war at all, although we did get a few stories about D-day. My dad passed in 2000 at the age of 82, taking most of his stories with him. But after his service he always voted too.

The love and care they have for each other has extended to their fellow comrades. I'm proud to call them SONS.\n\nIn honor of Sergeant David Bonnifield, Army National Guard - Served in the Iraq War\n\nHometown: New Ulm (Submitted September 15, 2010 by Kathy Bonnifield)\n\nThis year my vote honors my niece, who just started kindergarten. Sweetie, I wish you wouldn’t have cried when you saw my little brother talking to his friend, who was in a National Guard uniform. It doesn’t mean they are taking him away for a fourth deployment. We now realize how much these wars have affected you. This year I will vote In honor of you. I will vote with hope for your future. I know that you are not officially a vet, but you stand in the shadow my little brother, Sgt David Bonnifield.\n\nIn honor of Chief Petty Officer (Ret. ) Richard Borkovec, Navy - Served in Vietnam\n\nHometown: Chicago, IL (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Robert Borkovec)\n\nFor my Dad, a man I did not get to know very well growing up, because he was away on deployment all the time.

He was proud of his service to the country, and a proud Democrat. My father took me to vote when he did, back when it was a curtained machine where you pulled levers to make your selection. I remember him holding me up and telling me which levers to pull and he let me pull the final lever that registered his vote.

He idolized Dad's kid brother, my uncle Frank, who joined the Navy in 1935 and served his entire tour on the USS Arizona, dying at Pearl Harbor on Dec 7, 1941. Marvin, a ND farm boy, entered the Army about 1940 and became a commissioned officer, serving in the Pacific, ending the war as part of the provisional government in a prefecture of Japan.

I believe the military has helped mold him into the man he is today. He holds his family, church and community close to his heart.

He has lived through the great depression and knows heartache and loss, but this experience made him stronger. He lives with dignity, respect and honor.

He had a big heart and a generous spirit. He served with others from the New Mexico area and was shipped to the Philippine Islands and Clark Air Force base leaving the US on September 8, 1941. Clark Air Force Base was attacked the day after Pearl Harbor and my Dad’s unit was responsible for covering the retreat of the Northern Luzon Force into Bataan. As the war situation deteriorated his regiment surrendered to the Japanese and he survived the atrocities of the 65-mile “Death March” to be held prisoner for over 3 years. David was never bitter but believed we all “had a job to do” and held strong values about exercising our right to vote. As he told us often “I didn’t go over there for nothing. ” He believed he served so that we could live in a free country and especially so that we could get out and vote.

As a child growing up I looked forward to those times he was home on leave so I could hear about the country of Vietnam and see the interesting items he brought home as gifts. As time went on and I grew older my time with Uncle Tom became less and less, especially since he moved to Washington State. In 1995 at a family reunion we were together after almost 15 years. He was still very proud of his country and his service to the people of the US. However, he beat me for the championship trophy in horseshoes. I asked him where he learned to play so well and he said in the service they would play horseshoes to pass the time and forget about the chaos around them for a brief period of time. I never forgave him for beating me but will always be proud of him and honored by what he did.\n\nIn honor of Ken Covington, Air Force - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Crystal (Submitted November 4, 2008 by Rebecca Covington)\n\nMy vote honors my grandfather, Ken Covington, who served as a bombardier in the European theater during WWII.\n\nIn honor of Bobbe Cox, US Army - Served in the Vietnam War\n\nHometown: Detroit Lakes, MN (Submitted September 15, 2008 by Kay Hartness)\n\nBobbe is my brother.

It was planned that our crew would be flown back to Lakehurst in a day or two by heavier-than-air craft. After a full day of sitting around, our captain called us together and told us we'd been ordered to ferry an old blimp back to Lakehurst for teardown. He was very upset and gave us our liberty cards, telling us whatever we did that night in town was all right with him. We later learned he'd argued all day against flying this old ship. We went to the closest beer hall and tried to drink as much beer as we could. About the time we were full we met a chief petty officer that, when told we were the crew ferrying the old ship the next day, took us in his car to his own secret bar. Somewhat after closing time he dumped us back at the base bunk room. We were rousted out for flight well before daylight. On the East coast the hours around dawn are usually the quietest and safest for blimp launches. When we saw the ship in the hangar we collectively gasped. I had never seen such a decrepit flying machine in my life. Paint was missing from the car and there was an emergency landing wheel rigged to the bottom of the car with nylon strapping. One propeller was different. We quickly learned that the ship had made a bad carrier landing some weeks previously and tore the landing gear off while wiping out a prop on the carrier's flight deck. The destroyed prop had been replaced by a WWII vintage fixed pitch prop salvaged from a junked transport plane and that the bag or envelope was two years overage for legal flight. A blimp's bag is made of multiple plies of rubberized fabric and is supposed to be taken out of service after a certain number of months of inflation, all adjusted and governed by the amount of sunlight it received while in service. The ship was underinflated to reduce the strain on the fabric and we were warned to not exceed 50 knots airspeed. Blimps of that type were normally limited to 65 knots airspeed redline. We and our chow box were placed on the ship and the entire base ground crew maneuvered us out of the hangar by hand. We started our engines and were airborne. We had no sooner got airborne than we shut down the engine that had the improper prop. The makeshift prop was causing severe engine vibration. We then established a course for Lakehurst and about 9:00 AM the pilot got on the intercom and asked our rigger to check the food box. He said, \"Lets see if those bastards sent us off on this mission with nothing but crackers and water too. \" The rigger soon called back and said that the food box was filled with bread, onions, butter and steaks. The pilot said, \"Lets just have a steak smothered in onions on bread for a starter. \" The navigator and the co-pilot were too hungover to want to eat so the rigger and I had the second and third steaks. As a matter of fact there were enough steaks that we ate them all the way to Lakehurst, fried in butter and smothered in onions fried in butter. We encountered some head winds while moving up the coast and with our airspeed limit of 50 knots occasionally could only make good about 15-20 knots ground speed. We arrived at Lakehurst in a dead calm about 9:00 PM and carefully made a long straight-in approach. The ship was rolled into the tear-down hanger and secured and we went home for some well-earned rest. During that same night, the ship's bag split lengthwise and the car crashed to the hanger floor. Our luck had carried us just far enough. Blimps have gone down with huge rips in them and with the bag full of machine gun holes and always sank slowly enough to save the crew but none had ever split full length before.\n\nIn honor of James Crossley, US Army - Served in World War II\n\n(Submitted August 22, 2008 by Colleen Crossley)\n\nDad: Thanks to you and so many others for your sacrifices.

My dad was just an ordinary hard-working guy who dedicated his life to first serving his country, then providing for his family, being the neighborhood \"handy-helper,\" and enjoying his favorite pastime of fishing for \"lunkers.” Although he was reluctant to talk about his experiences in the South Pacific during WWII, he often talked about the freedoms & obligations we have as Americans. He valued the freedoms we enjoy-of speech & dissent, of the press, of religion, and to choose the school for his child. He also understood the obligations we have - of charity to the less fortunate, being a good neighbor, staying informed on current events & voting in elections. He knew the high cost of our American values & democracy. His military service was his way of preserving these for future generations. I miss him every day since his death in 1986. He has earned his reward in heaven & rests in the good Minnesota earth at Ft. Snelling cemetery. I have come to realize how upright & wise a person he was and how lucky I was to have him for my father. Thanks, Dad for keeping the light of freedom burning for me.

Five years ago, my mother passed away and my dad began to volunteer at the Veteran's Home in Fergus Falls. He \"works\" half time at the home, even though he is 81 years old. He's giving his life and his heart to our veterans. Last year he was nominated for a Jefferson Award. May we all honor our veterans as much as my dad does.\n\nIn honor of Seaman First Class Lenore Simmons Farr, Navy - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Milwaukee, WI (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Sandi Cary)\n\nMy Mom, Loni, served proudly in the US Navy during WW II. She was always very proud of her service to our country and I have always been proud of her. I grew up learning song like \"The Navy Hymn\" and others from her. If my mom were still with us, she would proudly vote as I am for Barack Obama!\n\nIn honor of Michael Fasnacht, US Army - Served in Iraq\n\nHometown: Janesville, MN (Submitted October 20, 2008 by Nancy Flitter)\n\nSome gave all!! Thanks is not enough!\n\nIn honor of John Faughender, Air Force - Served in World War II\n\n(Submitted November 4, 2008 by Paula Faughender)\n\nI'm voting this year In honor of my Dad. He taught us to vote for the person, not the party. And, he would have been thrilled to see the Democratic candidate for President this year - a black man running for President was Dad's goal for our country, and true equal rights for all of us, even though he was a white guy from South Dakota. He would say \"I won't see it in my lifetime, but hopefully you'll see it in yours\". So Dad, this year I'm voting for the candidate of your dreams. I love you. Paula\n\nIn honor of Specialist Shane Flodeen, Army National Guard, Serving in GWAT\n\nHometown: Cannon Falls (Submitted October 1, 2008 by Sue Maher)\n\nI am so proud of my son, Shane Flodeen, seeing him support his country and do what he believes in.

S. Marine Corps. He was wounded on Guam and awarded a Purple Heart. As did so many, he suffered in some ways for the rest of his life as a consequence of the War. But he never complained and remained convinced that he had done the right thing in securing peace and security for others, at home and abroad.\n\nIn honor of Dale Forsman, Marine Corps - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Ely (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Brandy Forsman)\n\nWhen I wonder if I should hurry to make it to the polls on Tuesday, I will think of my grandfather, Dale Forsman. If he could land on Iwo Jima and dare to take each step across that beach, I can do the much easier job of voting well. How hard is reading about candidates and stopping by the polling place compared to his service? I want to know that I have chosen smart, caring people who will think hard about when and where they send our service members.\n\nIn honor of E7 Justin Fuchs, Air Force - Served in Iraq\n\nHometown: Lake City (Submitted September 15, 2008 by Barb Simon)\n\nJustin is a fine young man who came back from an 8 month tour in Iraq and has been a stable support in helping our family through a personal crisis. The Air Force not only trained Justin and his comrades to be good soldiers, but they educated them on how to help others who are victims of crimes. Justin supported our family in doing the tough work of confronting injustice and helped by giving ongoing positive support and advice."
