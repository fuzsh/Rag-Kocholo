        "text": "share this\n\nFor decades, the United States has operated out of bases and facilities throughout the Middle East. As security priorities have changed and relationships with host countries have evolved, so have the locations and needs of U.S. forces in the region.\n\nOver the years, some of these bases or facilities have caused controversy. Some have come under discussion as regional disputes have brought their use into question. Overall, they are tools that provide significant regional stability and influence in a region that is strategically important to U.S. security interests.\n\nThis map does not include every U.S. base or facility in the Middle East, but rather focuses on those which are well documented or currently known to be in use. Several of these bases are not considered U.S. property, but are host-government operated, and host the presence of U.S. forces or material. Others, such as those in Oman, permit the presence of U.S. forces for pre-approved missions. While U.S. troops currently operate in Iraq and Syria, these areas of operation have changed rapidly over the past several years, requiring the construction of temporary or forward operating bases, few of which are publicly acknowledged by the U.S. military. These are not included in this map.\n\nThis map is updated as information becomes available. Latest update: 2/9/2021"
