        "text": "Coats:\n\nThe two coats issued the most to foot troops throughout the war were the 1858 dress coat and the sack coat, or fatigue blouse.\n\nInfantry, cavalry and light artillery units wore the sack coat which was made of dark blue, loosely woven flannel wool, reached just below the waistline and came in four sizes. Single-breasted with four brass coat buttons and a simple roll collar, the sack coat was meant for work or detail, but was more prevalent on the battlefield by the end of the war than the dress coat.\n\nThe 1858 dress coat, also known as a frock to civilians, was made of dark blue wool with skirts extending halfway to the knees. It was single-breasted with nine brass general service eagle buttons in front and a standing collar hooked together at the neck. The sleeves had pointed cuffs, open at the seam and secured with two small brass general service buttons. The edge of the collar and the cuffs were piped with a welt of cloth in the branch color (sky blue for infantry). This coat was more commonly worn by infantry soldiers earlier in the war and by certain infantry and heavy artillery units throughout.\n\nShirts:\n\nArmy-issue shirts were pullover style and made of white domet flannel – a cotton or cotton and wool flannel. They were coarse, inexpensive and easy to manufacture. (Not pictured)\n\nTrousers:\n\nEnlisted soldiers wore full-cut, straight leg, cuffed, creaseless trousers with vertical side pockets, made of sky blue kersey – a kind of coarse wool. A small tightening belt known as a yoke helped them fit properly. They were issued in four sizes, without belts or suspenders, though soldiers could wear their own.\n\nDrawers:\n\nWhite cotton long drawers buttoned at the waist in front and sometimes had adjustment ties on each side. There were also ties at the bottom of each leg that fastened under the instep and prevented the legs from riding up. (Not Pictured)\n\nEuropean Theater of Operations\n\nField Jackets:\n\nThere were two versions of field jackets: the 1941 and 1943. (Pictured) 1943:This darker-colored olive drab cotton-poplin jacket phased out the 1941 version. It was single-breasted with hidden buttons and added two interior pockets, a detachable hood, a cotton-poplin liner and an internal synching tie to draw it in for a better fit. It was also more wind- and water-resistant. The 1941 olive drab cotton-poplin windbreaker-style jacket was lined with wool flannel. It had a zipper, a roll collar, buttons and slanted front pockets. It was loose and economical, so it replaced the service coat in the field.\n\nOvercoats:\n\nMade of wool melton, a thick, dense fabric with a soft surface. (Not pictured)\n\nService Shirts:\n\nButton-up style in olive drab wool flannel. The collar was designed to be worn with a necktie. Shirts had two breast pockets and securable cuffs. (Not pictured)\n\nP1937 Trousers:\n\nMade of olive drab wool serge, these were worn for service and in the field. They were unlined, had a button fly, diagonal side pockets, one pocket in the rear, belt loops and suspender buttons on the inside. By this time, breeches were only used by mounted cavalry soldiers.\n\nM1943 Trousers:\n\nIssued in the middle of the war, these unlined cotton poplin trousers were a darker shade of olive drab. Adjustment tabs were added to the ankles and waist, and they could be worn over wool trousers in cold weather. (Not pictured)\n\nM1938 Leggings:\n\nThe khaki or olive drab cotton canvas leggings were worn with the field service shoe. They were laced up the side with a cord and secured with hooks and eyelets. An adjustable strap went under the soldier’s instep. Troops who received combat boots that were issued starting in 1943 no longer needed the leggings. Puttees had also been phased out because there was no more trench warfare. (Not pictured)\n\nPacific Theater of Operations\n\nU.S. troops first used camouflage in WWII in the Pacific theater, not in Europe, because Germans wore it there. However, it wasn’t prevalent in the Pacific. The uniforms were reversible: A green color scheme for jungle and tan scheme for the beach. (Not pictured)\n\nJackets:\n\nHerringbone twill cotton was used for these unlined olive drab-colored jackets because it was more airy than wool and dried quicker. This single-breasted jacket had five buttons, two flap-secured breast pockets and a roll collar designed to be worn open at the neck. While herringbone twill was designated a jungle-desert combat outfit, some were issued to troops participating in the Normandy invasion that had added protection from chemical agents.\n\nTrousers:\n\nHerringbone twill cotton was used for these olive drab-colored trousers because it was more airy than wool and dried quicker. Unlined, the trousers had a button fly, belt loops and suspender buttons on the inside. Each side had a large flap-secured cargo pocket.\n\nCap:\n\nWhile this soft cloth cap was similar in appearance to the WWI overseas cap, it was now known as the garrison cap and worn at camp but not on the front lines. It was olive drab wool serge or khaki cotton. There was piping on the edge of the side flaps and the color was branch-dependent. (Not pictured)\n\nM1 helmet:\n\nThis manganese steel upgrade from the WWI helmet provided greater ballistic protection, was stable to wear and didn’t interfere with the soldier’s vision or ability to fire weapons. Olive drab in color, it was also finished with sand or cork for a less reflective texture. The helmet featured a two-piece webbed chinstrap and had a separate liner made of plastic impregnated cotton that molded to shape. A canvas webbing suspension system allowed for a custom fit. The M1941 wool knit cap was sometimes worn underneath the helmet.\n\nEuropean Theater of Operations\n\nField jackets:\n\nThere were two versions of field jackets: the 1941 and 1943. (Pictured) 1943:This darker-colored olive drab cotton-poplin jacket phased out the 1941 version. It was single-breasted with hidden buttons and added two interior pockets, a detachable hood, a cotton-poplin liner and an internal synching tie to draw it in for a better fit.

It was loose and economical, so it replaced the service coat in the field\n\nOvercoats:\n\nMade of wool melton, the overcoat was of thick, dense fabric with a soft surface. (Not pictured)\n\nService shirts:\n\nButton-up style in olive drab wool flannel, the shirts had two breast pockets and securable cuffs. The collar was designed to be worn with a necktie. (Not pictured)\n\nP1937 Trousers:\n\nMade of olive drab wool serge, these were worn for service and in the field. The button fly, unlined trousers had diagonal side pockets, one pocket in the rear, belt loops and suspender buttons on the inside. At that time, breeches were only used by mounted cavalry soldiers.\n\nM1943 Trousers:\n\nIssued during the middle of the war, the M1943 trousers were an unlined darker shade of olive drab made of cotton poplin. Adjustment tabs were added to the ankles and waist and they could be worn over wool trousers in cold weather. (Not pictured)\n\nM1938 Leggings:\n\nThe khaki or olive drab cotton canvas leggings were worn with the field service shoe.They were laced up the side with a cord and secured with hooks and eyelets. An adjustable strap went under the soldier’s instep. Troops who received combat boots that were issued starting in 1943, no longer needed the leggings. Puttees had also been phased out because there was no more trench warfare. (Not pictured)\n\nPacific Theater of Operations\n\nU.S. troops first used camouflage in WWII in the Pacific theater, NOT in Europe, because Germans wore it there. However, it wasn’t prevalent in the Pacific. The uniforms were reversible: A green color scheme for jungle and tan color scheme for the beach. (Not pictured)\n\nJackets:\n\nHerringbone twill cotton was used for these unlined olive drab jackets because it was more airy than wool and dried quicker.

While herringbone twill was designated a jungle-desert combat outfit, some were issued to troops participating in the Normandy Invasion that had added protection from chemical agents.\n\nTrousers:\n\nHerringbone twill cotton was used for these olive drab trousers because it was more airy than wool and dried quicker. They were unlined and had a button fly, belt loops and suspender buttons on the inside. Each side had a large flap-secured cargo pocket.\n\nTrigger-finger mittens were introduced and there were few changes made to the style of equipment since large quantities of what had been manufactured during WWI were still on hand. This soldier wears a bedroll. The M1943 entrenching shovel had a triangular front edge and folding steelhead that could lock at various degrees.\n\nThe new M1945 combat and cargo pack (Not pictured) that was in two parts that could be worn separately was also released, but it was issued in limited numbers by war’s end.\n\nSince chemical warfare was expected after WWI, many variations were fielded during WWII. The M2A1 and M2A2 series gas masks (not pictured) and the M3 lightweight gas mask were used during the early part of the war. Each connected to a filter canister by a hose. In 1944, D-Day troops were among those issued the M5 assault gas mask in a waterproof carrier. This mask’s filter canister screwed directly into the cheek of the facepiece and became the pattern for the development of postwar gas masks.\n\nSoldiers used variations of the M1903 Springfield rifle from WWI, but newer firepower was also introduced:\n\nM1 Garand .30-caliber rifle:\n\nIntroduced in 1936, this was the first gas-operated, clip-loaded semiautomatic rifle in the world, giving the U.S. significant firepower advantage. It used an expendable “en bloc” steel clip, each holding eight rounds of ammo.\n\nM1 .30-cal carbine:\n\nThis lightweight carbine was used by rear-echelon troops, noncommissioned officers and specialist troops. The carbine used a shorter, less powerful .30-caliber cartridge with a 15-round magazine.\n\nBayonets:\n\nThe M1 and M1903 rifles could both be fitted with the M1905 bayonet used in WWI. Then came a new version, the M1942, which was also 16 inches but had plastic grips instead of wood, an anticorrosion coating on the metal and a cotton scabbard. In 1943, a shorter 10-inch version of the M1942 bayonet was created. Remaining M1905 and M1942 versions were cut down to match and issued.\n\nAdditional weapons:\n\nMachete-like bolo knives, Colt. 45 pistols, Thompson submachine guns, Browning Automatic Rifles and the M3A1 submachine gun.\n\nHerringbone twill:\n\nmaterial was prevalent in both the European and Pacific theaters in Olive Drab No. 7 shade. It was used for jackets and trousers because it was more airy than wool and dried quicker. A one-piece coverall was an option for fatigue and field use, but it wasn’t very useful in the field. Troops preferred the two-piece.\n\nU.S. troops first used camouflage in WWII in the Pacific theater, not in Europe, because Germans wore it there. Still, it wasn’t prevalent in the Pacific. The uniforms were reversible: A green color scheme for the jungle and a tan scheme for the beach.\n\nJackets:\n\nHerringbone twill cotton was used for these unlined olive drab-colored jackets because it was more airy than wool and dried quicker. These single-breasted jackets had five buttons, two flap-secured breast pockets and roll collars that were designed to be worn open at the neck. Herringbone twill was designated a jungle-desert combat outfit, though some with added protection from chemical agents were issued to troops participating in the Normandy invasion.\n\nTrousers:\n\nHerringbone twill cotton was used for these olive drab-colored trousers because it was more airy than wool and dried quicker. The trousers were unlined and had a button fly, belt loops and suspender buttons on the inside. Each side had a large flap-secured cargo pocket.\n\nM1938 Leggings:\n\nPuttees, which wrapped around the lower leg, had been phased out with the end of trench warfare. M1938 leggings, made of khaki or olive drab cotton canvas, laced up the side with a cord and were secured with hooks and eyelets. They were worn with the field service shoe and had an adjustable strap that went under a soldier’s instep. Troops that received combat boots, which were issued beginning in 1943, no longer needed these leggings.\n\nOther than the introduction of trigger-finger mittens, few changes were made to the style of field equipment issued, since large quantities of equipment manufactured during WWI were still on hand. This soldier wears the M1928 haversack, which was nearly identical to the M1910 version, with the addition of a few quick-release buckles. He has the M1910 entrenching tool and the late-issue M5 assault gas mask in a waterproof carrier. This mask’s filter canister screwed directly into the cheek of the facepiece and became the pattern for the development of postwar gas masks.\n\nMetal grommets attached to the straps of the haversack and could attach to more equipment if needed, such as the M1910 aluminum canteen and cup, their cotton canvas cover and the M1924 first aid packet and pouch.\n\nThe new M1945 Combat & Cargo Pack also came out, but it was issued in limited numbers by war’s end. It was two pieces that could be worn together or separately. (Not pictured)\n\nSoldiers still used variations of the M1903 Springfield rifle from WWI, but newer firepower was also introduced:\n\nM1 Garand .30-caliber rifle:\n\nIntroduced in 1936, this was the first gas-operated, clip-loaded semi-automatic rifle in the world, giving the U.S. significant firepower advantage. It used an expendable “en bloc” steel clip that held eight rounds of ammunition.\n\nM1 .30-cal carbine:\n\nRear-echelon troops, noncommissioned officers and specialist troops used this lightweight carbine, which took a 15-round magazine.\n\nBayonets:\n\nThe M1 and M1903 rifles could both be fitted with the M1905 bayonet used in WWI. Then came a new version, the M1942, which was still 16 inches but had plastic grips instead of wood, an anti-corrosion coating on the metal and a cotton scabbard. In 1943, a shorter 10-inch version of the M1942 bayonet was created. Remaining M1905 and M1942 versions were cut down to match and issued.\n\nAdditional weapons:\n\nMachete-like bolo knives, Colt .45 pistols, Thompson submachine guns, Browning automatics and M3A1 submachine guns.\n\nMuch of the gear remained the same as in WWII. The M1945 Combat and Cargo Pack also was used in Korea, but was a darker olive drab. The pack consisted of three components:\n\nThe OD canvas combat pack carried essential items like food, tools, clothing and other personal items (pictured here). It also had attachments to carry an entrenching shovel and M1 bayonet. Web straps held a sleeping bag, parka or overcoat.\n\nThe OD canvas field cargo pack (not pictured) attached to the bottom of the combat pack using three web straps and held the shelter half, poles and pegs, spare clothing and personal items. It also had a suitcase-like handle, allowing it to be both carried separately and quickly dropped when going into action. Cotton web pack suspenders could hold the combat pack or, using metal spring clips, support the weight of the WWII-era cartridge belt.\n\nThe M9A1 Field Protective Mask (not pictured) issued after 1951 was a light gas mask with a rubber-molded facepiece, laminated glass, aluminum eyepieces and a filter canister that screwed onto the mask’s left cheek. It came with an olive drab cotton canvas carrier bag.\n\nAs in WWII, troops in Korea used the M1943 entrenching shovels, which had a triangular front edge and folding steel head that could lock at various degrees. Also issued was the M1951, which was identical to the M1943 except for the addition of a short folding pick blade.\n\nSoldiers received the same canteens, covers and cups as in WWII. The first aid pouch was mostly the same, as was the bandoleer, which now held clips for the M1.\n\nOvercoats:\n\nOvercoats were a dark olive drab cotton poplin with a snow-colored reversible side for camouflage. It closed with a zipper and buttons, had four front pockets and a fixed hood with a removable liner.\n\nM1951 Parka:\n\nParkas had an olive green cotton canvas outer shell with a fur-lined hood and detachable mohair frieze liner for extra insulation. They could be worn over the field jacket in very cold conditions and were supposed to be issued instead of overcoats, but front line troops often complained they weren’t getting them.\n\nPonchos:\n\nOlive drab ponchos were made of nylon twill coated in vinyl resin for waterproofing. The lightweight poncho was more practical than a raincoat in the field because it could be used as a groundsheet or to cover gear. A hooded version was authorized by September 1951.\n\nHandwear:\n\nBlack, water-resistant leather gloves had wool-nylon blend inserts that could be worn on either hand. Trigger-finger mittens with inserts were also issued. The mittens had a strap and loop to stow the trigger finger if needed, and the back of the glove was lined with insulation. (Not pictured)\n\nUndergarments:\n\nTo combat the frigid temperatures in Korea, soldiers by 1951 were issued cotton-wool blend undershirts, shrink-resistant wool-nylon blend field shirts, wool boot socks to go over regular socks, crisscrossed suspenders and cotton-wool long underwear. (Not pictured)\n\nM1951 Wool and Field Trousers:\n\nOlive green wool serge trousers had a waistband with belt loops, suspender straps, waist adjustment straps and four pockets. The field trousers were an olive green cotton poplin shell worn over the wool trousers in wet, frigid conditions. A detachable mohair frieze liner could be attached inside the shell for added warmth. (Not pictured)\n\nMufflers made of wool were sometimes issued. (Not pictured)\n\nM1 Helmet:\n\nThe M1 steel helmet and liner were virtually the same as those used in World War II, and many of those helmets were still in use. In 1969, new liners made of ballistic nylon with removable suspension began replacing the older pattern liners.\n\nCotton camouflage covers were prevalent in a design known as the \"Mitchell\" pattern. They were reversible, with leaf camouflage in green colors on one side and brown colors on the other. The covers had buttonholes for inserting natural foliage for additional camouflage, and an olive green elastic camouflage helmet band that could hold items such as insect repellent bottles.\n\nThe Mitchell pattern camouflage helmet cover was worn until the Woodland pattern for the Battle Dress Uniform replaced it in the early 1980s.\n\nThe Tropical Hat, also known as the Boonie Hat, was made of olive green shade 107 cotton cloth and had a 2½-inch wide brim with a flat-top crown. It featured an adjustable nylon lace chinstrap, two half-inch screened ventilation eyelets on each side and a ¾-inch nylon-webbing headband for inserting natural camouflage.\n\nCommonly known as jungle fatigues, the tropical combat uniform evolved over time but the basic features remained the same.\n\nTropical Combat Jacket:\n\nThe jacket was made of a tightly woven, lightweight, cotton twill material and later cotton ripstop, in olive green shade 107. It was a bush-style design with two slanted bellows-type chest pockets with button flaps and two lower bellows pockets with button flaps below the waist. Olive green shade 107 cotton T-shirts were also commonly worn in the hot weather, replacing white T-shirts worn early in the war.\n\nUtility Shirt:\n\nBetween 1965 and 1967, the utility uniform was the primary combat clothing worn in Vietnam. The shirt, originally called a jacket, was made of olive green shade 107 cotton sateen. Initially, it was single-breasted with a fall collar, two patch chest pockets with button flaps, a straight bottom and plain sleeves. (Not pictured)\n\nTropical Combat Trousers:\n\nThe trousers were also made of a tightly woven, lightweight, cotton twill material and later cotton ripstop, in olive green shade 107. They had two front pockets, two rear pockets and two bellows-type cargo pockets on the legs. The trousers had a button fly and a drawcord at the bottom of each leg for protection from insects.\n\nUtility Shirt and Trousers:\n\nBetween 1965 and 1967, the utility uniform was the primary combat clothing worn in Vietnam. The shirt, originally called a jacket, was made of olive green shade 107 cotton sateen. Initially, it was single-breasted with a fall collar, two patch chest pockets with button flaps, a straight bottom and plain sleeves. The matching utility trousers had two front patch pockets, two rear pockets with buttoned flaps, hemmed bottoms and a button fly. (Not pictured)\n\nERDL Camouflage Pattern, also known as the “Leaf” pattern, was a combination of dark green, light green, brown and black shades. Only Special Forces and special operations troops wore this pattern, which was developed in 1948 by the Engineer Research and Development Lab and first used in 1967 in Vietnam. It was issued in both cotton poplin and ripstop fabric for the Tropical Combat Uniform.\n\nThe M1956 Load-Carrying Equipment was made of olive drab shade 7 cotton web canvas. The set was a complete replacement for the personal field equipment used during World War II and the Korean War. Each of the add-on components has a unique metal slide keeper for attaching to the belt or to other equipment: The set included:\n\nM1956 Individual Equipment Belt:\n\nThis was a web belt with three rows of eyelets. It could be adjusted in length from both ends and had a ball-type buckle.\n\nM1956 Combat Suspenders:\n\nThe suspenders were an “H” design and both the front and rear straps had hooks at the end. A metal loop connected to the support strap of an ammunition case. A first-aid pouch or flashlight could also be attached.\n\nM1961 Combat Field Pack:\n\nKnown as the “Butt Pack,” this pack featured a large storage compartment with a rubberized waterproof lining. Troops typically wore the pack attached to the pistol belt at the center of the back with the suspenders' rear straps clipped to eyelets at the corners of the bag.\n\nM1956 First Aid/Compass Case:\n\nAs the name implies, this small case was one of two used to hold either a field compass or the field dressing packet. It had a single slide keeper on the back that attached it to either the belt or the web keeper on the suspenders.\n\nCanteen:\n\nThe olive drab plastic polyethylene 1-quart canteen was first produced in 1962 and replaced the M1910 aluminum model. It featured a plastic screw cap with a plastic attaching strap. The M1956 Canteen Cover had felt lining and was designed to carry the 1-quart plastic canteen and stainless steel cup. It was attached to the belt with a pair of slide keepers.\n\nSoldiers typically wore two or more canteens to ensure they had the proper amount of hydration in Vietnam's tropical, humid climate.\n\nThe M1951 Combination Entrenching Tool had a straight wooden handle, folding shovel head and short folding pick blade. The cotton canvas M1956 Entrenching Tool Cover could accommodate either the M1943 shovel or the M1951 combination entrenching tool. A bayonet hanger on the front and slide keepers on the back attached to the belt or rucksack.\n\nThe M1956 Sleeping Bag Carrier allowed a sleeping bag to be carried on the M1956 Suspenders. The carrier was intended for use with the M-1949 Mountain Sleeping Bag. (Not pictured)\n\nIn Vietnam, U.S. infantrymen often used the poncho liner in combination with the poncho to create a lightweight sleeping bag. The carrier straps were equally well-suited to this hybrid sleeping equipment.\n\nIn 1967, the nylon/plastic M1967 Modernized Load-Carrying Equipment replaced the previous canvas iteration. The new equipment was lighter, more breathable and dried faster. It was mostly issued as components to go with the M1956 and not often given out as a whole set. (Not pictured)\n\nM1956 Universal Ammo Case:\n\nThe universal ammunition case was originally designed to hold magazines for the Browning automatic rifle and bandoleers containing six 8-round clips of M1 ammunition. In Vietnam, the 20-round M16 magazines proved too short for the universal pouch and as a result, a sock was often put in the bottom to raise the magazines up for faster retrieval. A shorter M1956 M16A1 ammo case was introduced to solve the problem. Both cases attached to the pistol belt via two slide keepers. They both had a supporting strap that clipped to the metal loop on the suspenders and straps on both sides for attaching hand grenades.\n\nM3 Bandoleer:\n\nThe olive green cotton M3 bandoleer had seven pockets, each designed to have a cardboard sleeve that held a 10-round clip of 5.56 mm ammunition for the M16 rifle. In Vietnam, troops would often carry a 20-round M16 magazine in each of the bandoleer's seven pockets and would frequently carry two or three on field operations.\n\nOuter Tactical Vest (OTV):\n\nIn 1999, the military introduced the Interceptor Body Armor, or IBA, also known as the Outer Tactical Vest.\n\nIt was the first Army body armor issued across the Army that was designed to stop high-velocity bullets.\n\nPrevious vests featured layers of nylon material designed to stop low-velocity shrapnel and fragments.\n\nThe IBA had bullet-stopping capabilities superior to PASGT. The outer shell protected against fragments and low-velocity rounds and could be integrated with the ETLBV system. Small Arms Protective Inserts are rigid ceramic composite plates with an outer layer of Kevlar or similar material that are inserted into the front and back pockets of the vest, giving the vest greater capacity to stop rifle rounds.\n\nIBA also could be fitted with additional parts to extend protection: a groin protector, the Deltoid Axillary Protection System (made of four components for the shoulder areas), a throat protector, and a yoke and collar. The pieces could be mixed and matched as needed for the mission or by soldier preference. However, these components were not bulletproof.\n\nThe vest was issued in various camo patterns. It included the Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment (MOLLE) system. The MOLLE pocket attachment system is a webbing grid on the front and back that could accommodate holsters, pouches and other gear. Equipment could now be attached in whatever configuration the soldier needed.\n\nThe Army Combat Uniform, or ACU, replaced the Battle Dress and Desert Camouflage uniforms and became standard issue in 2005. It was issued in two different camouflage patterns based on the area of deployment: the Universal Camouflage Pattern and later the Operation Enduring Freedom Camouflage Pattern. The set includes ripstop trousers, a coat, a patrol cap and moisture-wicking T-shirt and socks. The Universal Camouflage Pattern was the Army's digitally-based camouflage, a gray, tan and foliage-green pixelated blend. Most ACUs had hook-and-loop fasteners except the coat, which had a zipper. The Army eventually replaced most of the hook-and-loop closures with buttons for current-day uniforms.\n\nThe coat initially had a Mandarin collar and a zipper covered with hook-and-loop fasteners. There were several pockets with hook-and-loop closures. The name and Army tape attached above the front pockets were removable.\n\n2015 brought several changes based on soldiers' feedback: The Mandarin collar was removed; buttons replaced Velcro except on unit shoulder sleeve insignia; name and Army tapes and rank insignia could now be sewn on; in lieu of Velcro, cord and barrel locks on pockets were removed; and the pen pocket on the sleeve went from three to two slots.\n\nThe trousers had four cargo pockets: one on each ankle and one on each thigh. The trousers had reinforced knees and the shirts had reinforced elbows; these reinforced areas could be fitted with foam protection pads. Trousers also included a drawstring leg cuff.\n\nWhen the ACU was introduced, there were about 20 significant updates to the uniform that separated it from the DCU, DBDU and BDUs.\n\nSeparate knee and elbow pads became standard issue. Elbow and knee pad pouches were later added to the coat and trousers.\n\nThe Flight Glove is a short aramid and leather glove that allowed maximum dexterity and protected hands from fire, cuts and other injuries.\n\nThe Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment, or MOLLE, system was introduced in 1997 but wasn’t issued widely until 2003. Issued first in Woodland and then Desert camo, the MOLLE was switched to the Universal Camouflage Pattern in 2006. In 2009, the MOLLE OCP/Multicam was issued to soldiers deployed to Afghanistan. Beginning in 2015, it was issued to all soldiers after UCP was discontinued for combat zones.\n\nMOLLE is a fully integrated, modular load-bearing system consisting of a load-bearing vest with butt pack, main ruck with sustainment pouches and sleeping bag compartment attached to an external frame. The MOLLE system allows for versatility and greater load distribution. All the equipment that would normally be carried on suspenders or pistol belts can be attached in whatever configuration the individual soldier wants. Attached gear includes a canteen, first aid pouch and ammo pouches.\n\nThe CamelBak Hydration Bladder system supplemented the one-quart and two-quart canteens to provide an alternative hydration method. It is a plastic water bladder connected to a length of hose that fits into an insulated bag that can be strapped on the carrier's back or attached to a rucksack. Soldiers can easily drink from the bite valve while on the move.\n\nCamelBak was developed by bike racers who needed hydration on the move but could not slow down to use a bottle or other water source.\n\nM40 and M50 Gas Mask:\n\nThe new gas mask had the same basic design, with improved field of vision glasses and ballistic capability.\n\nIn 2007, the Army introduced the Improved Outer Tactical Vest, or IOTV, which provided increased protection over the OTV. Improvements included a side-opening, built-in quick-release system. Other new features included a ballistic collar, quick release assembly cord, front plate carrier, rear plate carrier, groin protector, lower back protector and elastic cummerbund assembly. Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts, or ESAPI, plates replaced SAPI beginning in 2005. The rigid ceramic composite plates have an outer layer of Kevlar or similar material that are inserted into the front, back and side pockets of the vest, giving it greater ballistic protection capabilities against high-velocity rifle rounds.\n\nThe Soldier Plate Carrier System, or SPCS, debuted in 2009. Its level of protection against high-velocity threats was on par with the IOTV but it allowed for a wider range of motion. The SPCS was lighter but had fewer flexible panels and less protection against low-velocity fragments. (Not pictured)\n\nIOTV also could be fitted with additional parts such as a groin protector to extend protection. The vest was issued in various camo patterns. It included the Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment (MOLLE) system. The MOLLE pocket attachment system, consisting of a webbing grid on the front and back, could accommodate holsters, pouches and other gear. Equipment could now be attached in whatever configuration the individual soldier needed.\n\nThe Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment, or MOLLE, system was introduced in 1997, but wasn’t issued widely until 2003. Issued in Woodland camo, then the Desert camo, the MOLLE was switched to gray-tone universal digital color in 2006. In 2009, the MOLLE OCP/Multicam was issued to soldiers deployed to Afghanistan, and to all soldiers beginning in 2015 after UCP was discontinued for combat zones.\n\nMOLLE is a fully integrated, modular load bearing system consisting of a load-bearing vest with butt pack, main ruck with sustainment pouches and sleeping bag compartment attached to an external frame. The MOLLE system allows for versatility and greater load distribution. So all the equipment that would normally be carried on suspenders can be attached in whatever configuration the individual soldier wants. Attached gear included canteen, ammo pouches, etc.\n\nCamelbak/hydration bladder: The CamelBak hydration system is the new canteen. It is a plastic water bladder connected to a length of hose that fits into an insulated bag that can be strapped on the carrier's back or attached to a rucksack.\n\nCamelBak was developed by bike racers who needed hydration on the move but could not slow down to use a bottle or other water source.\n\nM40 and M50 Gas Mask: The new gas mask had the same basic design, with improved field of vision glasses and ballistic capability.\n\nThe Army switched to the Operational Camouflage Pattern uniform based on soldiers’ feedback about the digital camouflage. Special Forces were already using the OCP design in 2006 in Afghanistan. Iraq-deployed soldiers had to still wear UCP uniforms. The now-standard issued OCP uniform is still made of 50/50 cotton-nylon blend and ripstop fabric.\n\nThe upgraded OCP Army Combat Uniform Coat has buttons and a zipper with two slanted breast pockets. The camouflage sleeves are fitted with cargo pockets with Velcro panels, enabling the soldier to wear identification and infrared identification tags.\n\nThe upgraded OCP Army Combat Uniform Shirt incorporates a full torso made of coyote-tan, elastic-nylon material for better cooling when wearing body armor. It also has pockets on the sleeves. (Not pictured)\n\nThe upgraded OCP Army Combat Uniform Trousers have reinforced areas including the seat and joint areas. Trouser knees can be fitted with rigid pads to protect soldiers against hard surfaces."
