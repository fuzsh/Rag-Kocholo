WALKER.\n\nTUNE â€” 'Tis my delight of a shiny night\n\nDid you ever hear of the Army\n\nThe Washingtonians form?\n\nDid you ever hear of the citadel\n\nOf Alcohol's they storm?\n\nO! it is a conquest glorious;\n\nCome, spread the tidings wide;\n\nO! we'll sing a song victorious,\n\nAnd join their ranks beside.\n\n55\n\nLong has he checked his enemies,\n\nAnd held them all at bay;\n\nBut now the Washingtonians\n\nBig fair to win the day.\n\nO! it is a conquest, &c.\n\nOn, on, brave Washingtonians,\n\nThough dear the struggle cost;\n\nPress on, ye win the citadel,\n\nRetreat, and all is lost.\n\nO! it is a conquest, &c.\n\nBut lo! it totters fearfully,\n\nEach bannered turret falls;\n\nNow like the billows boundingly\n\nPass o'er its broken walls.\n\nO! it is a conquest, &c.\n\nSoon from the ashes mouldering,\n\nThis citadel laid low,\n\nTen thousand crystal rivulets,\n\nThe gifts of God, shall flow.\n\nO! it is a conquest, &c."
