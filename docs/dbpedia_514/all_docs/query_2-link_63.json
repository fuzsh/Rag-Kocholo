        "text": "*No, you actually can't keep a trench box 2' above the bottom of an excavation... This is the standard: 1926.652(e)(2)(i) Excavation of material to a level no greater than 2 feet (.61 m) below the bottom of the members of a support system shall be permitted, BUT ONLY IF the system is designed to resist the forces calculated for the full depth of the trench, AND there are NO indications while the trench is open of a POSSIBLE loss of soil from behind or below the bottom of the support system. (emphasis added) But Marko, the standard says it's permitted! First: Read, understand, and follow the directions for the system you are using Second: Know and understand the type of soil you are working in Third: Consider all of the environmental factors that come into play during work - water, vibration, encumbrance, traffic loads, etc Fourth: Re-read the standard above. Think of those emphasized words. Then ask yourself: Did you classify the soil as Type C? Is it POSSIBLE any soil will drop into the trench from below the box? (by its very nature) Is there any water? (which erodes soil). If it was Type B, it's now Type C... Does the shoring manufacturer tell you to keep it tight to the bottom in Type C? Can the box shift while you're in it? (what happens if you're sitting on the pipe and the spreader drops 23\"?) Read and understand EVERY word. A truly Competent Person should never have the word \"but\" in their vocabulary. >> PS, this is me being \"polite\" after having had the same conversation twice in 48 hours, and waiting a day to write this... https://lnkd.in/eUbQBaQX bit.ly/trenchexc *There may be very limited exclusions to this statement. And those exclusions will NOT apply in Type C soil. Come at me bro...\n\nThank you to Keller, Inc. for having me out to chat with their teams last week. It was so cool to have the chance to speak in my 2nd home growing up out in Hollandtown at Van Abel's. In 2012, Google set out to find out why some of its' teams soared and others floundered so they ran a survey called Project Aristotle. Their findings....By far and away, the #1 characteristic of its' highest performing teams was 'psychological safety'. This was the backbone to how my father ran Van Abel's for 57 years. He was selling a lot more than chicken. It was all about community, commitment, second chances he gave, and being a great listener! This ties into the #1 job of any leader which first is to remove fear. If fear is allowed to linger under your service, your message maybe more hollow than you think. Dad was far from perfect but he certainly always put his heart out there and had remained curious even in the toughest situations. He did give second chances when he felt the time was right. There was always more to the story. #leader #community #safety"
