        "text": "What is trench foot?\n\nTrench foot, or immersion foot syndrome, is a condition that can occur when your feet are cold and wet for a long period of time. It often happens when you have to wear wet socks and shoes or boots for days at a time. Prolonged exposure to damp, cold and sometimes unsanitary conditions can lead to the disease.\n\nTrench foot is a type of non-freezing cold injury. This means the temperature that causes the condition is usually cold but above freezing. Other non-freezing cold injuries include chilblains, frostnip and Raynaud’s phenomenon. Trench foot can cause skin and tissue breakdown, which can increase your risk for infection. The condition can be very painful, but it’s treatable and preventable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWhere did trench foot get its name?\n\nIn 1812, a French army surgeon first described trench foot when treating soldiers in Napoleon’s army. But it became well known during World War I when many soldiers developed the condition. The soldiers stood in waterlogged trenches for long periods and had to endure cold, wet and muddy conditions. More than 20,000 British troops were treated for trench foot between 1914 and 1915. Fortunately, today, prevention and treatment options are available. However, the condition still does occur.\n\nWho does trench foot affect?\n\nTrench foot most commonly affects people in the military during training and combat operations. But trench foot can affect other groups of people. Trench foot affects:\n\nPeople who are homeless: People who are homeless often don’t have more than one pair of socks and shoes. They lack shelter and endure long periods of wet and cold.\n\nPeople who attend music festivals: People who go to large, outdoor music festivals can develop trench foot by standing in cold, wet and unsanitary conditions for days at a time.\n\nPeople who work in or near water: Fish processors, harbor workers and other people who have to stand in water for an extended time for their jobs may develop trench foot.\n\nPeople who spend time outdoors: People who enjoy recreational activities such as hiking and mountaineering can develop trench foot if they neglect to change out of wet socks and boots.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of trench foot?\n\nTrench foot looks and feels different as the disease develops.\n\nThe first symptoms of trench foot include tingling and itching which can progress to numbness. Your feet may feel prickly or heavy, like blocks of wood. Because of this, you may have difficulty walking. Your feet may be bright red. But they’ll soon turn pale, clammy and white as your blood vessels narrow.\n\nOnce you’re out of the cold, the skin of your feet will start to change color. If your skin is lighter, it may look blue or purple due to poor blood flow. If you’re darker skinned, the discoloration won’t be as noticeable. Your skin may be cold and blotchy. In addition, you may develop swelling. In severe cases, your feet can almost double in size.\n\nAs your feet rewarm, they may become bright red again. You may experience extreme pain or an abnormal sensation as blood flow returns to your feet. You may also develop blisters and holes or open sores on your feet, which can lead to fungal and bacterial infections. Your skin may become overly sensitive to changes in temperature and the lightest touch.\n\nWhat causes trench foot?\n\nYou get trench foot by standing in wet, cold conditions for an extended period of time. The temperature doesn’t have to be freezing. Trench foot can develop in temperatures up to 60°F (16°C).\n\nWhen cold temperatures and moisture combine, small blood vessels (capillaries) in your feet can start to weaken. This can lead to damage of the surrounding tissue. In addition, restricted blood flow affects your circulation and nerve function.\n\nExcessively sweaty feet (hyperhidrosis) can also cause trench foot.\n\nHow long does it take to get trench foot?\n\nMost cases of trench foot require exposure to cold, wet conditions for one to three days. But you can get trench foot in as little as 10 to 14 hours.\n\nHow is trench foot diagnosed?\n\nYour healthcare provider will perform a physical examination to diagnose trench foot. They’ll examine your foot and ask you about your symptoms. They’ll also ask you about your recent history. If you’ve been exposed to a cold, wet environment for at least a few hours, they may diagnose trench foot.\n\nYour healthcare provider will want to make sure your symptoms aren’t the result of an infection or another condition such as frostbite. They may order a white blood cell count or a sed rate (erythrocyte sedimentation rate or ESR) test. A sed rate test looks for inflammation in your body. Your healthcare provider may also order an X-ray or a bone scan if they think you may have a bone infection (osteomyelitis).\n\nIs there a cure for trench foot?\n\nYes. Trench foot is treatable if caught early. Treatment for trench foot includes gentle rewarming of your foot. Rapid rewarming can cause severe pain and swelling. To get rid of trench foot, your healthcare provider will also clean your foot and keep it dry and warm. Additional treatment includes resting and elevating your foot above your heart. This can help prevent new wounds and blisters.\n\nYour healthcare provider may prescribe an antibiotic to prevent any infections. You may receive a tetanus booster shot. For pain, you can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen. But your healthcare provider may prescribe a medication called amitriptyline.\n\nHow can I take care of myself after treatment for trench foot?\n\nAfter treatment for trench foot, you’ll need to take certain steps to make sure your foot continues to heal. These steps include:\n\nMaking sure to wear a clean, dry pair of socks every day.\n\nAvoiding wearing socks while sleeping to keep your feet dry.\n\nChecking your feet daily to make sure your symptoms aren’t worsening or you’re not developing any possible infections.\n\nAvoiding smoking and using other products containing nicotine. Nicotine can impair blood flow to your foot.\n\nEating a diet high in protein.\n\nWhat can I expect if I have trench foot?\n\nIn the past, trench foot was a serious condition that could lead to death. Today, most cases of trench foot are curable with early diagnosis and treatment. You can expect to fully recover from the condition. However, you may still have some lingering pain as full sensation returns to your foot.\n\nWhat complications can trench foot cause?\n\nIf left untreated, cellulitis or gangrene can set in. In severe cases, gangrene may lead to the need for amputation to avoid further disease progression. Other complications can include sepsis and death.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nTrench foot is a painful condition that got its name from the trenches WWI soldiers had to stand in. At that time, many soldiers lost their limbs and even died because of the condition. Today, prevention and treatment options are well known. The best treatment for trench foot is actually prevention. If you know you’re going to be in a cold, wet environment for a long stretch of time, take precautions. Always pack an extra pair of socks and make sure your shoes fit properly. With preparation, trench foot shouldn’t be a condition you have to worry about."
