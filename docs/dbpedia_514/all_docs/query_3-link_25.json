        "text": "Who can use your services?\n\nWe work with all Services-Active Duty, Retirees, Reserves, Guard and DOD Civilians and Contractors.\n\nDo you book airfare?\n\nWe are not an airline ticketing agency. However, AmericanForcesTravel.com is our online website in partnership with Priceline.\n\nDo you have packages?\n\nLeisure Travel Services Does not offer \"Pre-Made\" Packages as seen on the internet or TV. We customize packages to suit your individual needs and wants. Just let us know where and when you want to go, and we will be happy to “build” you a package.\n\nWhat forms of payment do you accept?\n\nWe take cash, Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. Sorry we do not accept the AAFES Star Card or checks.\n\nWhat do you have for \"FREE\"?\n\nLeisure Travel Services does from time to time offer complimentary tickets for Military Appreciation to various events. These complimentary tickets are handled as per Standard Operating Procedures for Distribution of Complimentary Tickets. Please keep in mind, the “FREE” tickets are not given to Leisure Travel Services. They are gifts to Ft. Stewart/HAAF. Leisure Travel Services is only the venue used to distribute the tickets.\n\nDo you sell concert tickets, Professional Sporting Event tickets or event tickets?\n\nWe do not carry the Jacksonville Jaguar NFL tickets. We may be able to get special military discounts for a few events; however, most concerts and shows will only be available through the venue or try AmericanForcesTravel.com. Please check with us for any possible discounts.\n\nWhy don't you put out event information sooner?\n\nWith some of the Military Appreciation tickets we get, we are not notified until as little as 1 or 2 days prior to the event. We do our best to get information out as quickly as possible, so everyone has an equal chance at picking the “FREE” tickets up.\n\nDo you book packages for Units, FRG's or other groups?\n\nWe are glad to work with your Unit. FRG, or any other groups for Attraction tickets or packages. We will work hard to get you a great deal.\n\nWhy can we sometimes get a better rate if we deal with the vendor directly rather than going through Leisure Travel Services? If you are here for the soldier, why are we, at times, charged more?\n\nLeisure Travel Services strives to offer our Military community the best pricing possible. It is true some vendors may have a \"better deal\" at different times of the year, however we encourage our clients to research all components of the package and all policies involved. We are here in person to answer any questions regarding your booking and handle any issues that may come up. We try to let our clients know how to get the best rate.\n\nDo you book “All Inclusive Resorts” and Cruises?\n\nYes. We book Sandals and Beaches Resorts and all Major Cruise Lines. We can also book Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando Resorts packages which can be customized to fit your needs.\n\nAre Rental Car Services offered?\n\nNo. But you will find Rental Agencies in Hinesville, Savannah, and online at AmericanForcesTravel.com.\n\nIs my purchasing through the Leisure Travel Services Office really better for the military family?\n\nPurchasing through the leisure Travel Services Office ensures you have someone working to get you the best rate and all components of your purchases are accurate. Also, all income from packages, tickets, etc. is returned to support your MWR Activities here at Fort Stewart/HAAF. Fun Runs, Movies under the Stars, Holiday Hayride etc. are all part of the MWR Events put on throughout the year for Military Families to enjoy.\n\nDoes LTS do phone orders?\n\nWe do phone orders, but we charge a convenience fee for each phone order. We recommend Clients who are local to come into our LTS offices, so we can better serve their needs. Also, Clients can see what all we offer for their leisure travel activities. Some discounted tickets require ID verification for purchase. We are not allowed to sale those over the phone. For example, Disney Military Salute tickets, Universal's Freedom Passes and other tickets that offer special military rates.\n\nDoes LTS charge taxes?\n\nAll tickets that we sell throughout Military Ticket Program (MTP) including our Military Contract Hotels are tax free. Cruises, vacation packages, etc. charge taxes."
