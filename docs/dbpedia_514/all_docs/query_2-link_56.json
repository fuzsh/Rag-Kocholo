        "text": "TIKRIT, Iraq, April 14 — The breeze off the Tigris blew through the empty halls of President Saddam Hussein's grandest palace today, its once fearsome opulence reduced, it seemed, to the most crushing sort of banality.\n\nHere on the bookshelf, for instance, were \"The Collected Works of Saddam Hussein,\" Volumes I through X, barely cracked. In the next room was a tablet of paper, imposing in its plainness, labeled simply \"The President.\" Then, in the bathroom, were signs of a hurried exit: a cabinet door open, a crumpled towel on the floor, a pair of men's underwear still hanging on the rack.\n\nThe end came today for the last and most formidable redoubt of Saddam Hussein's reign, as thousands of American marines poured into his hometown after a supposed collection of his staunchest bitter-enders finally gave up or ran away.\n\nThere was a fight, to be sure; it took most of Sunday and most of the night. But when daylight came and marines began to move, the fierce resistance anticipated here gave way to empty streets. Mr. Hussein's men were gone.\n\nAs night fell, the American officers leading the battle treated themselves to a view of the Tigris and the green flatlands beyond it, setting up their command post amid the mansions and monuments and artificial lakes that Mr. Hussein had presumably enjoyed only weeks before.\n\n\"Wow, this looks like Las Vegas,\" Capt. Tyrone Franklin said as he stared out on the panoramic grounds.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
