        "text": "Report proves government knowingly underplayed harms of radioactive waste they dumped 75 years ago\n\nSt. Louis (July 13, 2023)—Congresswoman Cori Bush (MO-01) released a statement following yesterday’s, Wednesday, July 12, devastating reporting first published in Missouri Independent outlining intentional downplaying of the severity and risk of 75 years of radioactive waste in St. Louis.\n\n“This report confirms what we in the community have known for decades: that for the past 75 years, the federal government actively and knowingly treated St. Louis as a dumping ground for harmful and toxic radioactive waste. For years the federal government and multiple other responsible parties continued to gaslight us and downplay the serious – and often deadly — health hazards that this waste carried. The federal government must not continue to allow our communities to be further collateral damage. They must not only apologize for this cruel act of negligence, but they are responsible for cleaning up this mess. Since my first day in office, I have been committed to holding them accountable and to pushing for immediate and swift action.I will continue partnering with local advocates, lawmakers and impacted community members on legislative solutions, including an upcoming bill which would provide compensation to residents harmed by the Manhattan Project waste and assess the many chronic health conditions that are a likely result of this government negligence.No more lives can be taken.”\n\nA copy of this report can be found HERE.\n\nThe main takeaways from this report include:\n\nRadium activity at the West Lake Landfill is expected to increase in the coming years;\n\nDespite warnings that further testing was needed, federal officials believed the contamination at the West Lake Landfill was confined to two areas because of a 1977 flyover test;\n\nA company that refined uranium for the Manhattan Project knew as early as 1949 that radioactive residue could pollute Coldwater Creek;\n\nA draft survey commissioned by federal government in 1976 showed dangerous levels of contamination running off into Coldwater Creek; and\n\nThe Cotter Corp. pushed the Atomic Energy Commission to let it dump radioactive waste at a quarry in Weldon Spring before illegally dumping it in the West Lake Landfill.\n\nThis report, titled “Records reveal 75 years of government downplaying, ignoring risks of St. Louis radioactive waste,” was first published on July 12, 2023. This investigative research was done by Missouri Independent, MuckRock and The Associated Press after spending months reviewing previously-unreleased government records.\n\nFor years,Congresswoman Bush has been advocating for the cleanup of Coldwater Creek.
