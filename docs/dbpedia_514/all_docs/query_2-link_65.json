        "text": "Name: Blake Horvath\n\nNickname: Balakay\n\nYear: Junior\n\nPosition: Quarterback\n\nHeight: 6'2\"\n\nWeight: 195\n\nHometown: Hilliard, Ohio\n\nHigh School: Hilliard Darby\n\nMajor: Operations Research\n\nWhat do you want to do after graduation and why? I'm not 100% certain but I'm leaning most toward becoming a pilot after graduating.\n\nWhy did you choose Navy? The prestige of the Naval Academy. It was the best place to set myself up for success after graduation, grow myself as a person, and to play FBS football.\n\nWhat would you tell somebody that is considering coming to the Navy to play football? It's one of the best choices you'll ever make. Challenge yourself now so that you can be prepared for anything that comes your way.\n\nIf you could play another position, what position would you play and why? Center, because I can snap better than Hoke Smith\n\nIf you could choose any opponent for Navy to play that is currently not on the schedule, who would you choose and why? Ohio State, just because I spent my entire childhood in Columbus as a Buckeye fan. It would be cool to play them and have a lot of friends and family there.\n\nFavorite class at the Naval Academy and why? Linear Programming. It's basically a class where you develop programs to find the most efficient way to do something based on the constraints you have. It was definitely a different way to approach math and coding but it was interesting.\n\nHardest class at the Naval Academy and why? Physics. Never want to take it again and any other answer is a lie.\n\nFavorite teacher at the Naval Academy and why? Capt. Martinez. I am thankful that I've been able to have been taught by Capt. Martinez twice. He does so much to give you advice on life at the academy and after graduating. I've learned more from him than probably anyone else at this school.\n\nFavorite form of social media and why? Twitter, by far the funniest place on the internet.\n\nFavorite person to follow on social media and why? Jersey Jerry, he's my go to Steelers fan account during the NFL season.\n\nIf you could have dinner with any 4 people that are currently at the Naval Academy who would you choose and why? Vice Admiral Davids, Coach Jasper, Daba Fofana and Coach Nick Aloi\n\nFavorite sport to follow at the Naval Academy outside of football and why? Women's Lacrosse. They've got a great team, they score tons of goals and the environment is electrict\n\nIf you didn't play football at Navy, what sport would you play and why? Baseball, just because all my best friends at home are playing college baseball and I think I could still be alright.\n\nWhat song is playing on your headphones in the locker room right before taking the field? Unwritten— Natasha Bedingfield\n\nWhat is your dream vacation? I'd say anywhere in Europe but if I had to choose one I'd say Greece.\n\nWhat is the best thing about being in the American Athletic Conference? A lot of great teams and it's a challenge every week. There's never time to be complacent and look past an opponent.\n\nWhat do you think about Army being in the American Athletic Conference? Weird for sure.\n\nFavorite Coach Newberry Quote: The standard is the standard.\n\nHow would you describe Coach Cronic's Offense: Wouldn't want to play defense against it.\n\nHow would you describe Coach Volker's Defense: Focused and energetic\n\nOne word to describe a Navy Football player: Gritty\n\nWho will be the surprise player on offense in 2024? Isaiah Bryant\n\nWho will be the surprise player on defense in 2024? Job Grant\n\nWho is the toughest player on the Navy football team? Kenzo Viteri\n\nWhat player epitomizes Navy Football? Daba Fofana\n\nWho will be the Most Valuable Player on offense in 2024? Alex Tecza\n\nWho will be the Most Valuable Player on defense in 2024? Colin Ramos\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to in 2024? December 14th.\n\nTell us one thing about you that most people don't know? I'm the best out of all my friends at Disc Golf.\n\nTell us one thing about you that would make a good feature story? I once had a small toy stuck up my nose for 7 years and never told anybody."
