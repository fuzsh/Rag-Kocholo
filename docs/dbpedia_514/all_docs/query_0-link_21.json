Strenuous outdoor activities should be reduced, especially in direct sunlight where there is little ventilation.\n\nDrink plenty of water or other non-alcohol fluids. Your body needs water to keep cool. Drink plenty of fluids even if you don’t feel thirsty.\n\nDon’t get too much sun. Sunburn makes the job of heat dissipation that much more difficult"
