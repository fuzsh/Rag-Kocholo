Feb. 25 - Mar. 01, 2015

As The Great Blizzard of 1888 brings Louisville, KY to a standstill, a monstrous fish is caught and stored overnight in an Irish tavern; it's presence here will forever change the lives of those forced to take shelter in the tavern overnight.

COLD WATER ARMY tells the fortunes of Dallin, the tavern-keeper with an impossible debt to pay; Adalyn, a devout member of the Cold Water Temperance movement; and Farielle, daughter of one of the first free Black coal-miners in Kentucky. While Dallin struggles to find a way to pay for his father's mistakes and keep the liquor flowing, Farielle wants to skip town and get away from the likes of Mr Finchley, local bigwig, and his nefarious side-kick, Topper, while Adalyn longs do God's work and close the tavern for good.

As their fortunes collide, the surreal presence of the fish and two little girls who accompany it, bears down on them; secrets are revealed, and soon they realize that they're all related to an act of arson and murder.

Death and redemption stalk them all, leading to a climax of biblical proportions.
