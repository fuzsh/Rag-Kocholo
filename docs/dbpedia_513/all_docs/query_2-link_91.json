        "text": "In 2023, Ukraine continued to defend its territory and people against a full-scale Russian invasion that brought more damage and atrocities. According to UN figures, as of November there have been 28,500 civilian casualties in Ukraine since the war began, with 10,000 killed and 18,500 injured. These figures likely underestimate the number of casualties since they do not include data from the Ukrainian territories under Russian control. For instance, in Russian-controlled Mariupol city, Ukrainian authorities said that as of April there had been more than 20,000 casualties. As of September, the war had caused more than $150 billion in damage to Ukrainian infrastructure. More than a third of the damage affected the housing sector. In March, the World Bank estimated that Ukraine would need $411 billion for recovery and reconstruction. Since the Russian invasion, 3,790 educational and 1,661 medical facilities have been damaged or destroyed. In the middle of 2023, Ukraine was more affected by landmines than any other country, with landmines endangering an area larger than Florida. In June, the occupiers blew up the Kakhovka Dam, causing hundreds of casualties and the largest environmental disaster in the Black Sea area in decades. In December, a cyberattack disrupted service for customers of the country’s largest mobile operator, Kyivstar, which served 24 million subscribers. The cyberattack was likely orchestrated by the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) and was the most impactful cyberattack on the Ukrainian network since the war began. It took more than a week for Kyivstar to fully restore service. At the end of December, Russia launched its largest air attack yet on Ukraine, targeting 120 cities and villages and killing 39 people.\n\nAt the end of the year, public statements by the Commander-in-Chief Valery Zaluzhny and President Volodymyr Zelensky highlighted their conflicting assessments of the war and the situation at the frontline. While the former emphasized that the war was at a stalemate due to the parity of both sides’ military technologies, the latter disagreed with this assessment. The subsequent exchange led to speculation about disagreements between the political and military leadership. Some observers speculated that the tensions between Zelensky and Zaluzhny were due to the modest achievements of the Ukrainian counteroffensive operation and Zaluzhny’s higher approval ratings than Zelensky’s. Zaluzhny’s popularity could make him Zelensky’s main opponent during the next election.\n\nDespite the challenging conditions, the government maintained control over the country and continued to function. Moreover, at the end of the year, the European Council decided to initiate negotiations with Ukraine to join the EU. The government took many steps to fulfill the council’s requirements after Ukraine was selected as an EU candidate country in 2022. While the process was not always smooth and provoked heated debates among representatives of the EU, the Ukrainian government, and civil society, EU leaders consistently recognized Ukraine’s progress in making the required reforms.\n\nThe government postponed the parliamentary elections scheduled for the fall of 2023 and the presidential election scheduled for the spring of 2024 due to the martial law regime that remained in place, safety concerns, personnel challenges, strained administrative and financial capacity, and public opinion against holding the elections. The debate over the expediency of holding the elections on schedule evolved into a discussion on the conditions needed to efficiently conduct the first postwar elections. The Central Election Commission, alongside international and domestic experts, developed a legal framework for conducting postwar elections.\n\nSimilar to 2022, civil society remained vibrant and actively engaged in the war effort by volunteering for the army, documenting war crimes, and running social projects in support of internally displaced people, among other actions. Also, expert civil society organizations contributed their professional expertise, advocacy efforts, and monitoring services to support the necessary reforms for Ukraine's European integration. Volunteering and fundraising for the army became more institutionalized and professional. In 2023, activists again organized public protests after a break in demonstrations since the war began. Several waves of local protests swept across the country. Some citizens called on local authorities to prioritize military spending over infrastructure projects, while others protested in support of demobilizing servicemen who had served since the beginning of the war.\n\nThe media landscape changed little from the previous year. The national telethon, produced and broadcast by the largest television networks, persisted despite increasing criticism. On one hand, the telethon limited competition among participant-channels; on the other hand, its funding from the state budget rendered it vulnerable to government influence and intervention. Meanwhile, at the local level, the war presented challenges for the media, including a shortage of personnel and financial resources due to the shrinking ads market.\n\nSince the Russian invasion, budgets have supported local self-government, primarily because the personal income tax (PIT) of servicemen remained within the communities where the military units were stationed. Local authorities spent much of this revenue on the military, but also used some of it to fund infrastructure projects. This sparked a wave of protests throughout Ukraine, with locals demanding that authorities prioritize military spending. After heated debates, the central government deprived local governments of the military PIT, transferring the tax revenues to the state budget, which used them exclusively for military expenses. Local governments criticized the decision as an attack on their financial sustainability. In the long run, redistributive decisions of this kind may seriously undermine financial decentralization, one of the pillars of the broader decentralization reform, and substantially weaken local government.\n\nDespite the public’s strong distrust of the judiciary, international and domestic experts praised a series of personnel appointments and institutional changes. For instance, when the government allowed the High Council of Justice to resume its work and then established the High Qualification Commission of Judges, officials were able to begin the process of filling more than 2,500 vacant judgeships. The adoption of the new procedure to appoint Constitutional Court judges was another long-awaited achievement. The arrest of the head of the Supreme Court for accepting a bribe highlighted the fragility of the judiciary and its vulnerability to external influences, but also underscored the government's efforts to uncover and prosecute high-level corruption within the judiciary.\n\nSince the EU prioritized anticorruption efforts as a prerequisite to initiate Ukraine’s accession process, the government implemented a series of institutional and personnel decisions to meet the EU’s anticorruption requirements. These included the appointments of the head of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the head of the Higher Anti-Corruption Court, reinstating requirements that politicians provide electronic declarations of their assets, and the adoption of the Anti-Corruption Program. The Program stressed on eliminating corruption risks in state policies in fifteen areas where Ukrainian citizens encountered corruption most frequently. The Program stressed on eliminating corruption risks in state policies in fifteen areas where Ukrainian citizens encountered corruption most frequently. Nevertheless, corruption has remained endemic in Ukraine and it metastasized within the army in 2023, especially in military procurement and mobilization. In response, he government conducted audits and opened investigations at both the top and bottom levels of the Ministry of Defense. These efforts to combat corruption put the government in an ambivalent situation, as more light was shed on the scale of corruption with each case it uncovered. It is too early to credit the government for successfully fighting corruption, but it should be acknowledged for taking some substantive steps to combat the problem, even at the potential expense of public support.\n\nIn 2023, the government’s efforts to meet the criteria for initiating accession negotiations with the EU was the primary driver of democratization and reform. The most significant progress with the positive and measurable outcomes was reached in the fields of combating corruption and reforming the judiciary."
