        "text": "Transcarpathian region\n\nZakarpattia Oblast (Transcarpathian region) is located in the Southwest of Ukraine. In the north it borders on Lviv, in the east on Ivano-Frakivsk oblasts of Ukraine, in the south it borders on Romania, in the southwest on Hungary, in the west on Slovakia and in the northwest on Poland.\n\nThe administrative centre is the city of Uzhgorod.\n\nThe majority of national composition are Ukrainians: in the northwest, there are ethnical groups of Boykos and Lemkos, in the east — Hutsuls. Hungarians, Russians, Romanians, Slovaks, Germans and Gypsies also live here — in all more than 30 nationalities.\n\nAbout 80% of the territory of this land is occupied by mountains, creating from the southwest to the southeast the Vododilnyi mountain range, the Gorgany, the Svydovets, the Chornohora, the Polonynskyi range, the Rakhiv Massif and the Volcanic Carpathians. In the Chornohora mountain range, there is Mount Hoverla (2061 m) that is the highest peak of the oblast and Ukraine. Transcarpathia is joint with other regions by the Yablunytskyi, Vyshkivskyi, Uzhotskyi, Veretskyi and Volovetskyi passes of an altitude from 931 to 1014 metres above sea level. The southwestern part of the oblast is covered with the Transcarpathian Lowland (100-120 metres above sea level).\n\n9429 rivers and streams flow through the territory of the oblast. The Tisza (the Danube's left tributary) is the longest river. Within the territory of the oblast, its length is 240 km. The longest tributaries are the Borzhava, the Rika, the Tereblia and the Teresva. The next largest rivers are the Latorytsia and the Uzh that fall into the Bodroh river. In the oblast, there are 137 natural lakes, in particular of glacial and landslide origin, Synevyr is the largest of them.\n\nUseful minerals of the oblast: deposits of polymetals, alunites, perlites, zeolites and rhyolites, the Solotvyno rock-salt deposit is considered to be important; kaolin mining is carried out here, 13 deposits of carbonate raw materials (marbled limestone, dolomite, marble) were found. More than 360 mineral water springs different in chemical composition and medicinial properties were discovered and examined\n\nIn the territory of Zakarpattia oblast, near the village of Dilove, Rahiv district, there is the geographical centre of Europe.\n\nThe climate of Transcarpathia is temperate-continental, and the very word \"temperate\" in this term corresponds to reality. Here, there is nothing too much or too little: there is enough sun in summer and enough snow in winter, and the interseasonal weather doesn't tend to cause such damage as steady rains. Within the territory of the plain, air gets warmer during a year than in the mountains. In July, an average temperature is +20°С, and in January – -4°С. In general, the climate is much warmer than in other regions of Ukraine, located at the same latitude.\n\nThe first account about human habitation in the territory of Transcarpathia refers to the Lower Paleolithic Period (about 1 million years BC). In the 3rd century, the Carpi, one of Thracian tribes, moved here from the valleys of the Siret and Pruth rivers under the pressure of Romans. In many scholars' opinion, the Carpathians took the name from this very tribe.\n\nThe history of Transcarpathia is a part of the history of Ukraine, and it has the whole range of features that have had an impact on economic, political and ethnic development of the land. Occupying an important geographical location on the southern slopes of the Ukrainian Carpathians, Transcarpathia that at different times had such names as \"Hungarian Ruthenia\", \"Carpathian Ruthenia\", \"Subcarpathian Ruthenia\" and \"Transcarpathian Ukraine\" had been a part of the Kingdom of Hungary, Austrian Habsburg Monarchy, Czechoslovak Republic and Horthy's Hungary by the middle of the 20th century. Due to this, Transcarpathia is a very peculiar Ukrainian region that has its own dialect, its own cuisine and other local features.\n\nTranscarpathians are famous for their hospitality and multiculturalism. You can hear the Russian, the Ukrainian, the Hungarian, the Romanian and other languages here that sometimes mix with each other and create a local racy dialect.\n\nTranscarpathia is the motherland of the world's famous artists as Ihor Hrabar, Adalbert Erdeli, Yosyp Bokshai, Fedir Manailo and Andriy Kotska. A lot of other artists such as composers Dezyderyi Zador, Stepan Marton, Yevhen Stankovych and singer Gizela Tsypola come from here.\n\nPhotos\n\nThings you should do in Transcarpathia:\n\nVisit one of many balneological resorts — drink mineral water or improve your health during spa treatments.\n\nSwim in thermal water in Berehove, Koson or Velyatyn.\n\nSee numerous architectural monuments and natural attractions — castles, palaces, churches, national nature parks and a lot of other attractions.\n\nWalk around the old cities of Uzhgorod, Mukachevo, Berehove or Khust.\n\nTaste different goodies — goat and sheep cheese, sausages, wine, fruit liqueurs as well as an extremely tasty and special local cuisine.\n\nIn winter — you should go skiing, in summer — go camping or ride a horse.\n\n10 most interesting architectural monuments:\n\nBoyko churches, Velyky Berezny district\n\nWine cellars, Serednie urban village\n\nHoryany Church-Rotunda, Uzhhorod city\n\nGothic of Potyssia: churches of Berehove, Vynohradiv district, Rakhiv, Tyachiv and Khust districts\n\nChapel of st. Joseph, Mukachevo city\n\nLemko churches: the Church of St. Nicholas (Svalyava) and the Church of St. Michael (Museum of Folk Architecture, Art and Life, Uzhhorod)\n\nShenborn Palace, the village of Karpaty\n\nFormer Casino (restaurant \"Zolota Pava\" (\"Golden Peacock\")), Berehove city\n\nPerényi Mansion House, Vynohradiv city\n\nPhilharmonic building, former synagogue, Uzhhorod city\n\n10 most interesting castles\n\nKankiv Castle\n\n'Nialab', Korolevo urban village, Vynohradiv district\n\nPalanok Castle\n\nSent-Miklosh castle\n\nDovzhanskyi castle, the village of Dovhe, Irshava district\n\nTemplars' Castle\n\nKvasivskyi castle, the village of Kvasovo, Berehove district\n\nNevytskyy Castle\n\nUzhgorod Castle\n\nFortress in Khust\n\n10 most interesting museums\n\n10 most interesting natural attractions\n\nVoievodyn Waterfall\n\nValley of the Daffodils\n\nZacharovana Dolyna State Park (Enchanted Valley)\n\nBrebeneskul Lake\n\nSynevyr Lake\n\nPearl Cave\n\nCave with transparent walls\n\nBeech virgin forests\n\nPolonyna Runa (Rivna)\n\nSalt Lakes\n\nInteresting facts:\n\nPractical information:\n\nThe main warning concerns time. Transcarpathians officially live according to current time in Kyiv, but actually — according to current time in Europe (it is called 'local time' here). That's why you shouldn't be surprised when you hear \"6 o'clock Kyiv Time\" or \"5 o'clock Local Time\" — other Ukrainians understand it as 6 o'clock.\n\nIf you plan to visit some village museums, you should phone and agree on the day beforehand because a worker in such places, as a rule, is the only one and he/she is not always there.\n\nWhen a traveller sees the signboard \"ABC\" on grocery stores, he/she can think that it is a name of the local mini-market chain. Actually, small department stores in Hungary are called \"ABC\", that's why it can be considered as a general name. There are round-the-clock shops only in some cities, most often you can find them at such gas stations as \"OKKO\", \"WOG\" and others.\n\nTransport:"
