        "text": "Territorially, the Community extends from the north to the south of the Zakarpattia Region along the Rika River. The central and northern parts of the Community are located in the mountainous region of the Ukrainian Carpathians (accounting for up to 70% of the total area of the Community), and its southern part is located in the foothills, which pass into the Transcarpathian lowland. Most of the localities in the Community are located in the mountainous areas and have the status of mountain localities.\n\nThe Community consists of sixteen localities. The administrative centre of the Community is Horinchovo.\n\nThe total area of the Community amounts to 223.6 km².\n\nAs of 01 January 2023, the population of the Community totalled 12,717 residents.\n\nMen: 6,158 residents\n\nWoman: 6,559 residents\n\nInternally displaced persons staying in the Community: 240 people\n\nIn the historical written sources, the village of Horinchovo was first mentioned in 1350 as Zeleumezeu. In 1403, the name of Harincha began to be used with respect to this locality, and in 1460 it was called Herinche, later (after 1555) – Herenchi. In the official Hungarian version, this name is still used. Translated into Ukrainian, it means “a field overgrown with potions.”\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the development of the village was largely determined by its relative proximity to the town of Khust and the Khust Castle, which served as an important fortress in northern Transylvania. Until the second half of the 18th century, it had played the role of one of the main fortifications in the internecine confrontations between the troops of the Transylvanian princes and the Habsburgs. In addition, the Khust Castle was often attacked by Turkish and Polish troops.\n\nThe situation changed to some extent after the destruction of the Khust Castle, which lost its defensive significance due to lightning striking its powder tower in 1766. Since that time, Khust began to develop as an industrial town to a greater extent making an impact on the surrounding villages, including the villages of Horinchovo, Berezovo and Monastyrets, whose residents were able to find work in the town and earned additional income from the sale of their goods at the town markets.\n\nIn 1813, the Michael Greek Catholic Church was built in Horinchovo, which was decorated with rich and exquisite carvings. The church was destroyed by the Soviet authorities.\n\nAfter 1910, Horinchovo began to be mentioned in contemporary sources as a settlement of the Khust District.\n\nThe village of Protyven was first mentioned in 1898 as Prativeny. It was also mentioned in 1907 as Felszeg.\n\nSince 1956, the Tereble-Ritska hydroelectric power plant has been operating in the territory of the village of Protyven – the only hydroelectric power station in the world built on two rivers.\n\nThe construction of the hydroelectric power plant there has fundamentally changed the infrastructure of Protyven and the lifestyle of its inhabitants. Today, the Tereble-Ritska HPP is part of a powerful energy complex, the so-called Burshtyn Island, which operates in the territory of the Zakarpattia, Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk Regions.\n\nThe HPP is an attractive site of industrial tourism for extreme experience seekers from Ukraine and many countries around the world.\n\nThere is a museum in Protyven where you can learn more about the process of electricity generation.\n\nTo the south-east of the village there is a primeval forest natural site “Natural forests of the Nyzhnii Bystryi Forestry”.\n\nSince 2008, the Monastery of the Dormition of the Holy Virgin of the Order of Friars Minor (Eastern Rite) has been functioning in Protyven. Today it is an attractive place for spiritual and physical recreation of pilgrims from different parts of Ukraine. Every year, groups of children and young people come to the monastery for a creative vacation.\n\nThe main part of the Community is made up by forest lands as well as agricultural lands.\n\nThe share of the Community’s land resources good for cultivation and agriculture is 24% of the Community’s area.\n\nThere is a small deposit of clay in the village of Posich, next to which a brick factory operates.\n\nThe Community has land plots that are potentially attractive for investment. A possibility of creating an industrial park is being considered in an area of 17 hectares in the village of Horinchovo.\n\nThe Community is also famous for its great tourist potential.\n\nConsidering the structure of the Community’s land resources and the specifics of its soil cover, the main areas of agricultural development within its borders are horticulture and animal husbandry.\n\nThe resources available in the Community provide opportunities for the development of sheep and goat breeding, as well as the relevant processing industry. A large number of sheep and goats are kept there, and there are deep traditions of sheep and goat breeding, which creates a perspective for attracting investments in product processing and production of craft cheeses and meat products on this basis, as well as creating tourist attractions."
