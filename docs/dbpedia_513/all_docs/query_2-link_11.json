        "text": "City in Khost Province, Afghanistan\n\nCity in Afghanistan\n\nKhōst (Pashto: خوست) is the capital of Khost Province in Afghanistan. It is the largest city in the southeastern part of the country, and also the largest in the region of Loya Paktia. To the south and east of Khost lie Waziristan and Kurram in Pakistan. Khost is the home of Shaikh Zayed University. The Khost Airport is located in the eastern area of the city.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Geography of Afghanistan\n\nKhost is located about 150 kilometres south of Kabul. Khost lies on a plateau not below 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) in elevation that extends to the east for about 40 kilometres (25 mi) until the Pakistan border. Thirty kilometres, to the north the peaks rise up to 2,500 to 3,000 metres (8,200 to 9,800 ft) while farther south 20 kilometres (12 mi) away from the border, the average is around 1,800 m.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nKhost has a semi-arid climate (Köppen BSk though very close to qualifying as BSh). Khost is located in the \"Khost Bowl\", a valley with lower elevation than the surrounding highlands. The geography afforded more moderate weather conditions. With a January average of 4.8 °C (40.6 °F), Khost has noticeably milder winters, compared to the much harsher and snowy winters of the surrounding higher towns to the north, west, and south (listed anticlockwise): Parachinar, Tari Mangal, Aryob, Tsamkani, Khandkhel, Gardez, Zurmat, Sharana, Zerok, Urgun, Angur Ada, Kaniguram, and Razmak. Nonetheless, frosts are still frequent in the early mornings.\n\nMost unusually for Afghanistan, Khost receives a substantial proportion of its annual rainfall of 475 millimetres (19 in) from the South Asian monsoon. The valley being open to the southeast (towards the lower elevation Miranshah), the moisture-laden winds bring much welcomed rain during the summer. The remaining portion of the year Khost remains hot and dry. Sporadic droughts occur when the summer monsoon fails to bring the needed precipitation.\n\nLand use\n\n[edit]\n\nKhost is the provincial administrative seat in eastern Afghanistan. Being close to the border with Pakistan, Khost straddles an important transport corridor. The eastern districts (1–3) are dotted with forests and residential settlements while the western districts (4–5) are more barren and lightly populated.[5] Water courses account for 5% of total land surface.[6]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: History of Afghanistan\n\n19th and 20th centuries\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the Second Anglo-Afghan War, British forces led by Lord Roberts entered Khost during the second British invasion of Afghanistan during the conflict. Approximately 8,000 raiders from the Mangal tribe, which had a long tradition of resisting outside control, launched several attacks on weakly protected British supply convoys in Khost. In reprisal, Lord Roberts ordered his forces to attack eleven Mangal villages which had launched raids that murdered several camp followers, resulting in them being sacked and burnt. Once news of the reprisals became known in Britain, his political opponents in the British Parliament criticized Lord Roberts' actions. At the end of the conflict, British forces withdrew from Khost.[7][8]\n\nKhost rebellions\n\n[edit]\n\nBetween 1856 and 1925, Khost was the site of three rebellions, lasting from 1856 to 1857, 1912, and 1924–1925 respectively.\n\nDuring the Soviet–Afghan War, Khost was the object of a siege that lasted for more than eight years. Soon after the invasion of Afghanistan by Soviet troops, Afghan guerillas took control of the only land route between Khost and Gardez, effectively putting a stop to the Soviet advance.\n\nDuring the assault on the Zhawar Kili Cave complex, the Soviets used the Khost Airfield as an initial staging ground to insert troops into the combat zone, using Mil Mi-8 armed helicopter transport ships.\n\nAs of April 1995, Khost was under the control of the Taliban.[9]\n\n21st century\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Forward Operating Base Chapman\n\nDuring the war in Afghanistan (2001–2021), the United States built Forward Operating Base Chapman near Khost. Due to its location in southeastern Afghanistan, it was a hotbed for insurgent activity attempting to dislodge the American forces there. Like most other provinces, Khost is home to maneuver forces and a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT). Maneuver forces wage war against insurgents and assist the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police in operations, while the PRT handles the reconstruction aspects.[citation needed]\n\nIn early 2007, Lieutenant Colonel Scottie Custer of the 82nd Airborne Division saw that the best way to limit insurgent activity in Khost was to forward-deploy some 187 paratroopers under his command to Force Protection Facilities in Khost's various district centers around sub-governors' mansions, to directly protect these, maintain a visible presence in population centers, and help mentor Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police units operating across Khost.[citation needed]\n\nThe FPFs brought a broader sense of security and prosperity to surrounding areas.[citation needed] Bazaars, shops, and gas stations have improved the quality of life for local residents. The Mandozai Force Protection Facilities in Khost include a medical clinic attached to further assist Afghans in need of basic medical assistance. The offices of Khost's various sub-governors had experienced an increased activity as Afghans went there to settle disputes and voice concerns instead of going through traditional tribal channels and bribes, cutting down on sectarian suspicion and strife.[citation needed]\n\nThroughout 2007 and 2008, roads had been improved, businesses were springing up and schools were being built, at least 50 in 2007 alone with another 25 planned for 2008. A new airport was under construction as the Khost Airfield was used by the US Military, creating new opportunities and jobs.[citation needed] The Provincial Reconstruction Team, led by CDR David Adams was instrumental in connecting the people to the government in Khost City, by ensuring the PRT was able to execute over $2.5 million under the Commanders Emergency Response Program (CERP).[citation needed]\n\nOn 12 May 2009, several teams of armed militants stormed Khost, prompting a heavy 6-hour battle with US and Afghan National Army forces. Reportedly the attack involved 10 suicide bombers, of whom seven were able to detonate and three were shot by security forces. Coalition Forces, aided by the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police, took the lead in repelling the attack.[citation needed]\n\nOn 20 November 2009 a bomb killed 3 civilians and wounded 3 others as a car hit a roadside bomb in Khost City. According to the chief of criminal investigation the act was perpetrated by the Taliban.[10]\n\nOn 24 November 2009, according to the Afghan Ministry of Interior, 6 people, including 5 children were killed when a remote control bomb attacked a water station in Khost which had been built by the Rural Rehabilitation Ministry to distribute water to the locals.[11]\n\nOn 30 December 2009, a suicide bomber attacked Forward Operating Base Chapman, a major CIA base in Khost, and killed seven CIA officers, including the chief of the base.[12][13][14]\n\nOn 18 February 2011, a suicide car bomber targeted a police checkpoint and killed 11 people.[15]\n\nOn 14 July 2011, according to a spokesman for the provincial government, NATO ground troops killed six civilians in a night raid of the village of Toora Worai, in an area known as Matoon, about seven kilometres from the Khost provincial capital of Khost city.[16]\n\nOn 15 August 2021, Khost was seized by Taliban fighters, becoming the twenty-eighth provincial capital to be captured by the Taliban as part of the wider 2021 Taliban offensive.\n\nAt least 29 people died in Khost during the June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake.[17]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Demographics of Afghanistan\n\nThe urban population of the city of Khost is 106,083 (in 2015), mostly Pashtun (mainly from the tribes of Zadran, Mangal, Zazi, Tani, Gurbuz, Muqbal, Sabari, Banusi and Wazir), living in 11,787 dwellings, arranged in six municipal districts.[18]\n\nKhost has a population of 511,600 people in 2008. In the province, there are 87,199 households, with an average of eight individuals per home. Rural districts are home to 98 percent of the population. Pashtuns are the province's most populous ethnic group. Zadran, Mangal, Mandozi, Ismaiel Khil, Tani, Gubuz, Matoon, Lakan, Jaji, Sabari, Alishir Terizi, and Babakker Khil are among the prominent tribes. There is a small population of Pamiris as well. Kuchis (nomads) live in Khost province, and their numbers fluctuate depending on the season. 75 percent of the 104,965 Kuchis living in Khost are long-distance migratory, while 25% are settled. Over half of the colony of long-distance migratory Kuchis migrates from a winter to a summer location. In the winter, an estimated 74,179 people cross the border, bringing Khost's Kuchi population to 179,144, making it the country's second-largest Kuchi province (after Nangarhar). [19]\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Sport in Afghanistan\n\nThe three most popular sports in Khost, Afghanistan are cricket (86%), basketball (19%) and football (11%).[20]\n\nCricket is growing in popularity in Khost, with the sport being introduced by newly returned refugees from Pakistan. Afghanistan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman, and batsman Noor Ali, as well as Nawroz Mangal, the former captain of Afghanistan Cricket Team hail from Khost. Dawlat Zadran, the Afghan Cricket paceman who grabbed two crucial wickets against Pakistan (in 1st International One Day against Full Member), is also from Khost.\n\nIn football, Khost and the surrounding region is represented by De Abasin Sape F.C, in the Afghan Premier League.\n\nProfessional sports teams from Khost\n\nClub League Sport Venue Established Paktia Panthers Afghanistan Premier League Cricket Sharjah Cricket Stadium 2018 Mis Ainak Knights Shpageeza Cricket League Cricket Khost Cricket Stadium 2013 De Abasin Sape F.C.
