        "text": "Khust is a city located on the Khustets River in Zakarpattia Oblast in western Ukraine. It is near the сonfluence of the Tisa and Rika Rivers. Serving as the administrative center of Khust Raion , the city itself does not belong to the raion and is designated as a city of oblast significance, with the status equal to that of a raion. Population: 28,448\n\nThe name is most possibly related to the name of the stream Hustets or Husztica, whose meaning is \"kerchief\". It is also conceivable that the name of the city comes from a Romanian traditional food ingredient – husti.\n\nSource\n\nSource: Wikipedia.org\n\nCopyright: Creative Commons 3.0\n\nMore information\n\nStatistics"
