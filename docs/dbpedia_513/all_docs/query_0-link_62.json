        "text": "Transcarpathia is the western region of Ukraine, officially called Закарпатська область/Zakarpatszka oblaszty. Its administrative centre is Uzhgorod and the official language is Ukrainian. It is a multi-ethnic territory. According to the Ukrainian census data of 2001, the population of Transcarpathia is about 1 254 614 people. The majority of the population is Ukrainian (80.5%). We can also find people of several other nationalities: Hungarians, Russians, Romanians, Ruthens, Slovakians and some others. The largest national minority is the Hungarian community, about 151 516 Hungarians (12.1% of the population) live near the border between Hungary and Ukraine. During the 20th century several territorial and governmental changes occurred in the Carpathian Basin that caused several regularizations of settlement names by the authorities in the territory of present-day Transcarpathia – especially because of political and ideological purposes, without taking the cultural traditions and historical backgrounds of the local Hungarian community and other ethnic groups into consideration. In this way, settlement names have been changed about five times in the region: 1) the first regularization of settlement names took place between 1898 and 1912 when the territory of present-day Transcarpathia belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy; 2) the second one was during the period between the two World Wars, when the region was integrated to the first Czechoslovak Republic from 1919 to 1938; 3) the names of the settlements were modified for the third time between 1938 and 1944 when the region became part of Hungary again; 4) after the Second World War the settlement names were changed again, for the fourth time, when the territory of present-day Transcarpathia was attached to the Soviet Union from 1945 to 1991; 5) the fifth changing of city-, town- and village-names began after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the region became part of the independent Ukraine (1991). The subject of the given study is connected to the fifth regularization of settlement names in the territory of present-day Transcarpathia that began in the Soviet era, at the end of 1980s, but its official approval occurred in the time of independent Ukraine. It differed from earlier regularizations of place names because the local Hungarian minority initiated the restoration of traditional and historical Hungarian names of settlements populated by them based on updated international and Ukrainian contracts and laws relating to the rights of national minorities.\n\nDuring the 20th century the Hungarian community with other local ethnic groups, living on the territory of present-day Transcarpathia, were forced to sustain more governmental changes that caused place names to be changed in the region – especially because of ideological purposes, without taking cultural traditions, historical backgrounds into consideration. In this way, settlement names were modified nearly five times in the region: 1) the first regularization of settlement names took place between 1898 and 1912 when the territory of present-day Transcarpathia belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy; 2) the second one was during the period between the two World Wars, when the region was integrated to the first Czechoslovak Republic from 1919 to 1938; 3) the names of the settlements were modified for the third time between 1938 and 1944 when the region became part of Hungary again; 4) after the Second World War the settlement names were changed again, for the fourth time, when the territory of present-day Transcarpathia was attached to the Soviet Union from 1945 to 1991; 5) the fifth changing of city-, town- and village-names began after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the region became part of the independent Ukraine (1991).\n\nDuring the twentieth century the region of Subcarpathia belonged to several different states: the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, Czechoslovakia, the independent Carpatho-Ukraine, the Hungarian Kingdom, the Soviet Union and finally to Ukraine. Today it borders four member states of the European Union (Poland, the Slovak Republic, Hungary and Romania), and due to its history several ethnicities and languages, religions and cultures live side by side in this region. However, as a consequence of the different language and minority policies in Subcarpathia, we cannot find a common language that everybody knows regardless of age, gender, education, religion or place of residence. The lack of a lingua franca makes dialogue between ethnicities difficult, sometimes even impossible. In this article we outline the main features of the regional, minority and language policies of the different states that existed at the various historical stages. We believe that the in-depth analysis of the history of this region can help find a model that could be useful not only in the region but also in the wider context of similarly multinational, linguistically diverse, culturally colorful territories in the Carpathian Basin and states in East-Central Europe.\n\nFrom the early twentieth century to the present day, Transcarpathia has belonged to several states: the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy, Czechoslovakia, the Hungarian Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and finally to Ukraine. The status of what counts as a minority and a majority language has changed each time the state affiliation has been changed. Based on the long term research by Csernicskó, and on the one-month fieldwork carried out by Laihonen in 2012, our goal is to provide an autonomous critical account and discourse analysis of the linguistic situation in Transcarpathia. We draw examples especially from the linguistic landscape, which documents the hybrid practices difficult to catch with other means. Different nation states have aimed to evaluate certain languages over others. However, Transcarpathia has been too far away from different national centers and it has therefore remained a periphery. In the everyday life of Transcarpathians, ironies around language repertoires, standardization and heteroglossia come into the fore, especially in the current context. Such unexpected linguistic practices or “pre-nationalist” and “non-purist” ideologies offer a change to see how certain categories, such as language, have remained in their hybrid forms and are still clearly “in the making”.\n\nIn this paper, based on the data of a sociological research and the analysis of the linguistic landscapes of six Transcarpathian cities, we have illustrated that in Transcarpathia a significant part of the population-regardless of ethnicity-live their lives not according to the official \"Kyiv time\" (EET; UTC+2) but according to the \"local time\" (CET; UTC+1). Even the names of the two times are distinguished in the local language use in Ukrainian, Hungarian, and Russian languages alike. The difference between official central time and \"local time\" appeared in Transcarpathia when the region became annexed to the Soviet Union. Yet, before the Second World War, each state in the region used CET. The Soviet power introduced Moscow time zone (MSK; UTC+3) of two hours ahead. The distinction between \"local time\" and central time was maintained when Transcarpathia became part of the newly independent Ukraine. The population in the region was urged to use a different time zone for a relatively short time from a historical point of view. The persistence of \"local time\" is also strengthened by the fact that it contributes to the image of Transcarpathia as a particular, specific region of Ukraine."
