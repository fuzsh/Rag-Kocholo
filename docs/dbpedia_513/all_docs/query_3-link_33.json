The relevant act was signed on 5 June between Oleksiy Kudryavtsev, head of the State Architectural and Construction Inspection of Ukraine, and Volodymyr Kashchuk, Khust city mayor.\n\nKhust became the 2nd city in the Zakarpattia Oblast and 99th in Ukraine to independently control construction works on its territory. Volodymyr Kashchuk noted that the city authorities would do everything possible to make the city reach the leading position.\n\nAs to the plans of the new body in the structure of the city authorities, he said: “We will be tolerant on all issues related to state architectural and building control”."
