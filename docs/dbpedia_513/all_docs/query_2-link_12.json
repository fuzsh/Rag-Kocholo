        "text": "Transcarpathia is a unique place, which stands out from other regions of Ukraine with its own special nature and fascinating history. A vacation in Transcarpathia allows you to discover unique historical facts, appreciate the architectural monuments of the Middle Ages, visit unconquered fortresses, get well with healing waters, and be inspired by the friendliness of the residents.\n\nIn addition, Transcarpathia is not only beautiful but also a wonderful reason to plunge into the historical events of different times. Did you know, for example, that there were as many as two capitals of Ukraine in Transcarpathia?\n\nFew people know, but in 1918, not only ZUNR was proclaimed, but also the small Hutsul Republic within the Rakhiv district of the Transcarpathian region. The state did not last long, less than a year, but this time was forever etched in the history of the region.\n\nThe rather small village of Yasinya became the capital. The leaders of the state were going to join the ZUNR, and therefore the UNR, and create a single country from the Xiang to the Don, but, unfortunately, they did not succeed.\n\nAncient Mukachevo is a neat, cozy town on the banks of the Latoritsa River. Small, cozy Mukachevo contains an amazing number of unique monuments of the Renaissance, Gothic and Baroque eras. This is a city of eclectic styles, blends of aromatic wines in cozy streets, and extraordinary and powerful energy.\n\nThe atmosphere and history of the city attract and fascinate even experienced travelers. Palanok Castle can be seen from any point in the city, the name of Mukachevo and its turbulent history is connected with the fortress. You can walk through the passages of the castle on your own, or you can take a tour - it is much more interesting to walk accompanied by a tour guide. In addition to the citadel on Zamkova Gora, in the city, you can also see the square with the city hall, as well as the church that stands on this square. Next to the Cathedral Church of St. Martin stands a Gothic chapel decorated with paintings.\n\nThe \"Red Wine\" festival attracts winemakers and wine connoisseurs not only from Ukraine but also from abroad. Hungarian winemakers are constant guests of this holiday. Guests of the festival will find there very tasty snacks, as well as strong drinks such as mead or cognac. In the end, judges choose the winner â€” the best winemaker.\n\nThe cozy town of Berehove is the Transcarpathian wine capital. Well-known wine production is located here, and \"BeregFest\" is also held - a universal festival, which traditionally begins with the ritual of pressing grapes.\n\nWhat else can you see? The Museum of Berehiv Oblast is located in the palace of Count Bethlen, the oldest preserved building in the city (1629), the Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, the Transcarpathian Hungarian Institute named after Ferenc Rakoci II (building of the former Palace of Justice), stone \"humped\" bridge.\n\nOne of the most luxurious buildings in Berehove is considered to be Panske Casino or \"Golden Peacock\" - all the city's ceremonial events were held there, and now there is a large restaurant and hotel. In addition, the city is famous for its thermal springs - pools with hot water extracted from the earth's depths, located in the open air. With the help of thermal water, various diseases can be treated, but such procedures are especially useful after injuries and damage to the skin.\n\nIf you are looking for new culinary experiences, try not only Transcarpathian but also Hungarian cuisine in the city.\n\nThe name of the city once sounded like \"Solva\", which comes from the word salt. And not for nothing, because once it was the main point from which salt was exported to neighboring countries. The first written mention of the city dates back to 1236.\n\nYou should visit the wooden Michael's Church of the 16th century. Built in the style characteristic of the Lemkiv region, the sacred monument of Svalyava is the Church of the Nativity of the Most Holy Theotokos. Also, organize an independent quest - find all the mini sculptures in the city."
