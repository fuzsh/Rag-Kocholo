        "text": "This article addresses the History of the Jews in Carpathian Ruthenia.\n\nContents\n\nBeginning of Jewish settlement in Upper Hungary\n\n(to be written)\n\nTurkish occupation\n\n(to be written)\n\nHabsburg times\n\n(to be written)\n\nCzechoslovakia\n\n(to be written)\n\nJewish-local relations in the eve of WWII\n\nMemoirs and historical studies provide much evidence that in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Rusyn-Jewish relations were generally peaceful and harmonious. In 1939, census records showed that 80,000 Jews lived in the autonomous province of Ruthenia.\n\nThe attitude of some Ruthenians to their Jewish neighbors is vividly represented in the play by Oleksandr Dukhnovych (1803-1865), \"Virtue is More Important than Riches briefed here (http://www.legacyrus.com/RuthHolocaust1.htm,). In opposite to other areas of Ukraine, the Ruthenia never experienced the times of chaos and riots that elsewhere usually were followed by pogroms.\n\nFinal solution\n\nDuring World War II, once the legal government of Hungary was overthrown by the Germans, the \"Final Solution\" was also extended to Carpathian Ruthenia.\n\nIn April 1944, 17 main ghettos were set up in cities in Ruthenia. 144,000 Jews were rounded up and held there. Starting on May 15, 1944: 14,000 Jews were were taken out of these sites to Auschwitz every day until the last deportation on June 7, 1944.\n\nBy June 1944 all the Jews from ghettos of Carpathian Ruthenia had been exterminated, together with other Hungarian Jews. Of more than 100,000 Jews from Carpathian Ruthenia, around 90,000 were murdered. Except for those who managed to flee, only small number of Jews were saved by Rusyns who hid them.\n\nSince the fall of Communism, archives have recently been opened to allow study of the facts about the implementation of the Final Solution in the province. The most discussed issue is whether, and to what extent, local collaborators helped the Nazis in performing the tasks and to what extent such collaboration was forced upon those collaborators by the threat or actuality of brutal violence against themselves.\n\nReferences\n\nAlexender Dukhnovych, Virtue Is More Important Than Riches (translated by Elaine Rusinko), East European Monographs, 1995, 85pp., ISBN 0880332905.\n\nHenry Abramson, Collective Memory and Collective Identity: Jews, Rusyns, and the Holocaust, Carpatho-Rusyn American, vol. 17 (1994), no. 3.\n\nAgnes Sagvari,\n\nStudies on the History of Hungarian Holocaust, Budapest, Napvilag, 2002.
