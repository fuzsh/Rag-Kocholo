Although a print was not viewed, the above credits and plot summary were taken from a translated dialogue continuity deposited with the NYSA. The film recounts the brief period of the independent Ukrainian state, Carpatho-Ukraine, established in 1938 when Czechoslovakia granted the region autonomy. At the time independence was proclaimed in Carpatho-Ukraine, Hungary had already begun an occupation that was to last throughout World War II. The film opens with a history of the Ukraine from the ancient state of Kiev to the establishment of Carpatho- Ukraine and depicts the customs, religion and culture of the Ukrainian people.\n\nIt is not clear from the cutting continuity whether the scenes of the Carpatho-Ukrainian \"Sojm,\" or congress, located in the city of Khust, are re-enactments or documentary footage of the proceedings. The leaders of the Carpatho-Ukrainian state that the film features include Prime Minister Dr. Augustin Woloshin, Minister Julian Revai, Augustin Stephan, Dr. Mihailo Brasschaiko, Dr. Stephen Kotcherhan, Dr. Stephan Rossocha, Colonel Yefframeev, Feodor Revai, Captain Belay, and Dr. Vladimir Kamarinsky.
