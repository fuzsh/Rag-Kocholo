        "text": "2. As for me, Khust castle is the most interesting and magic place. I like to go there with my friends. I know that the castle was built in the late 12th century. The fortress was one of the most well-protected castles. It was never captured by invaders. But in 1768 it was destroyed by a lightning during a terrible thunderstorm. Now we can see only the ruins of the castle\n\n5. Greek Catholic church of the XVII c. Protestant church XV c.\n\n6.  These are the wooden churches  of the XVII- XVIII cs.\n\n7. Old Jewish church of the XVI c. The Catholic church of the XVIII c.\n\n8.  I think that churches of Khust are also worth seeing. There are about seven old churches and cathedrals in our town. They are very beautiful inside. You can see nice paintings and frescos on the walls.\n\n9. Now we also have a new cathedral that is in the central square of Khust"
