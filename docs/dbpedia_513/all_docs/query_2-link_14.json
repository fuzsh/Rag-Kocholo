        "text": "The castle of Huszt, evoced by the poem of Kölcsey Ferenc, the poet of the Hungarian Anthem, was built by King St. László of Hungary against the Cumans according to the legend. This might not be true, but we can be sure, that the privilege granted by King Charles I of Hungary in 1329 made Huszt the center of the four crown towns of Máramaros County along the river Tisza, and this proves the significance of the settlement. Its castle was of great strategic importance, as it protected the roads leading to the salt mines of Máramaros and the crown towns. In the turbulent times following the Battle of Mohács, its castellan, Kávássy Kristóf, was able to plunder the countryside undisturbed. Later, it became an important border fortress of the Principality of Transylvania, which was the bastion of Hungarian independence against Habsburg oppression. In the middle of the 17th century, the castle was owned by Rhédey Ferenc. This was its golden age, because even the nobility of the neighboring counties of the Kingdom of Hungary enrolled their children to its renowned school. It was an important stronghold of the insurgents during the War of Independence led by Rákóczi Ferenc II, and the castle, which survived every war, was eventually destroyed by mother nature. The town was taken from Hungary and given to Czechoslovakia in 1920. Huszt took on a disgraceful leading role for a short time in 1938, when it became the seat of the autonomous region led by Avgustin Voloshin. Volosin began violent Ukrainianization and set up a concentration camp for the Hungarian and Rusyn opposition. Voloshin's republic proclaimed in Huszt on March 14, 1939 pleading immediately for German patronage was ended the next day by Hungarian troops liberating Subcarpathia. Perhaps the most beautiful attraction of the town is the Reformed church, built in the late 14th century and originally dedicated to St. Elizabeth of Hungary.\n\nCheck out other towns in Subcarpathia (Ukraine) as well!"
