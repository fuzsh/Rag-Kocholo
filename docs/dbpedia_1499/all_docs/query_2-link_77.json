        "text": "On Friday, July 26, 2024, the Lord in His infinite wisdom saw fit to call from labor to rest our beloved wife, mother, aunt, and friend, Beverly Jo Brown Cotledge. Beverly Jo Brown Cotledge was born August 11, 1953, to the late Harold David Brown, Sr. and Rosie Mae Harris Brown. She also was preceded in death by her brother, Harold David Brown, Jr.\n\nBeverly, or affectionately known as Bev, professed a hope in Christ and united with Pilgram Rest Baptist Church in Van Buren, Arkansas at an early age and served faithfully. Upon relocating to Little Rock, Arkansas she united with First Baptist Church Highland Park. She later moved to Pine Bluff, Arkansas and united with New Jerusalem Baptist Church. Upon leaving New Jerusalem, the holy spirit led her to unite with Damascus Missionary Baptist Church in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. She continued to serve in many roles which included being a member of the sanctuary choir, missionary society, and working with the youth. She remained a faithful servant until her passing.\n\nBeverly’s education started in the Van Buren school district where she graduated with honors. She completed a certificate program at the Arkansas Valley Vocational Technical School in Office Management in 1972. She later pursued her education with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business and Management at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) in May 2002. She graduated Summa Cum Laude and was a recipient of the Chancellor’s Medallion Award. Her keen intelligence, sense of fairness, and Christian values were immeasurable.\n\nOn April 29, 1978, she was united in holy matrimony to Quranner “Q” Cotledge. To this union, a precious child was born – Sonya Jenice. Bev’s family was her life. Her husband was truly her best friend of 46 years and travel companion. She enjoyed many trips out shopping with her daughter, and just talking, laughing about life. Bev could find joy in everything and everyone she met. If you knew Bev, she no doubt made an impact somehow in your life. She was an outstanding, inspirational co-worker, advisor, friend, and confidant with an amazing sense of humor. Bev loved to laugh and make others laugh and feel comfortable.\n\nShe began her forty-year career with the University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service (CES) in 1973 as a Clerk-Typist in the Crawford County CES Office. Her dedication and exceptional work ethic were recognized immediately, and she rapidly moved from the Crawford County Office to the University of Arkansas CES state office where she served as Secretary of the Southeast District Administrative Team for several years. In 1983 she was highly recommended by the southeast District Team to the 1890 Extension Program at UAPB when her husband transferred to the Jefferson County Department of Human Services. She was the Office Manager for the School of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Human Sciences and was the school mom, affectionately known as Mama Cot, and mentor to many students.\n\nBeverly’s organizations and affiliations included Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated, Delta Omega Omega Chapter; Pine Bluff Chapter of The Links Incorporated; Aluma Chapter of the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff; and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).\n\nMemories are precious; therefore, Beverly Jo’s earthly life should be cherished forever. The love she shared will continue to survive in the hearts of her loving husband; Quranner ‘Q’ Cotledge; devoted child (her heart) – Sonya (Arthur) Anderson of Cabot, AR; step son; Johnathan (Keisha) Haggans of Jonesboro, AR; niece and great niece (sources of joy) – Ebony Brown of Kansas City, MO and A’Nia Rose Caldwell of Kansas City, MO; aunt; Dorothy (Jimmy) Collins of Gulf Port, MS; church mom, Tina Humphrey of Pine Bluff, AR, and a host of other relatives and friends.\n\nServices are under the direction of Mitchell Funeral Home of Arkadelphia, AR. Funeral services were held Monday, August 5, 2024, at Damascus Missionary Baptist Church in Pine Bluff. Burial and final resting place was in Graceland Cemetery in Pine Bluff, AR."
