        "text": "THE HAGAN FAMILY OF BOURBON COUNTY, KENTUCKY\n\nCompiled by James G. Faulconer\n\nThe Hagans of this study came from Ireland in the early 1800s. The name was originally O'Hagan, and came from the gaelic, meanic \"fire.\" The \"O\" was dropped from the name in this country. Tullaghoge, in the county of Tyrone, Ireland, is the home of many in the Hagan clan, but the monument of James Hagan, noted below, says that he was born in County Derry.\n\nW.H. Perrin's History of Scott, Bourbon, Harrison and Nicholas Counties, Kentucky, tells briefly of two Hagan brothers who came to this country, one settling in Bourbon County: (page 503)\n\nCassandra (Boulden) married P. Hagan, whose brother, Dr. Hagan, and editor of a paper, at Natchez, was killed in a duel, resulting from some article published in his paper. Hagan removed to St. Charles, Mo., and was drowned from a steamboat while on a trip with horses to Kentucky. His widow returned to Kentucky and afterward married John K. Ashurst, of Bourbon.\n\nHere is further information about the three brothers:\n\n1. William Hagan, according to family lore, settled in New York and raised a family there.\n\n2. Patrick Hagan settled in Bourbon County, Kentucky. More later.\n\n3. James Franklin Hagan was born about 1804/5. Quite possibly he arrived in Philadelphia on the ship, Lord Gaugh, on August 12, 1830. His age was listed as 26, and his occupation as a laborer. He lived for a time in Philadelphia, studied as a physician, and then went to Mississippi. He became wealthy, and became editor of the Vicksburg Sentinel. He never married. Perrin said that James was killed in a duel, but as noted below, James was unarmed at the time. Here are excerpts of newspapers of Mississippi, found in Wiltshire's Marriages & Deaths from Mississippi Newspapers.\n\nIndependent Democrat, Canton, Miss., June 10, 1843. Dr. Hagen, the distinguished editor of the Vicksburg Sentinel, was killed on Wednesday last in a street fight with D.W. Adams, Esq., of Jackson. The cause of the quarrel between the parties was an article which appeared in a recent number of Dr. Hagan's paper and which Mr. Adams conceived to be derogatory to the character of his father, Hon. George Adams, late judge of the U.S. Court of Mississippi.\n\nVicksburg Daily Whig, June 15, 1843. Dr. James Hagan, 38 years, shot with pistol.\n\nPanola Weekly Register, Panola County, July 15, 1843. It will be seen by a paragraph which we copy from the New Orleans Courier of the 10th, that Dr. James Hagan, the editor of The Vicksburg Sentinel, was killed in that city by a son of Judge Adams on the 7th, the Dr. being unarmed at the time. Dr. H. was a for a number of years a resident of this city.\n\nThe Hornet, Carrollton, July 14, 1843. Daniel W. Adams, the unfortunate young gentleman who killed Dr. Hagan in a street fight, asks of the public the justice and charity to discard from their minds and feelings the foul falsehoods and imprecations that have been made against him. He is now held in durance, and at the proper time will be tried by the laws and constituted tribulals of his country.\n\nJames Hagan had quite a following, and was deeply mourned. Some $10,000 was raised to erect a monument in his honor. The stone in the Cedar Hill Cemetery in Vicksburg has this inscription: \"Sacred in the memory of James Hagan M.D. A native of County Derry, Ireland. By adoption a citizen of the U.S. He departed this life on the 6th day of June 1843, aged 38 years. A martyr to his devotion to the rights and interests of the people, and his uncompromising vigilance and zeal, in detecting and exposing the usurpations and corruptions of place and power.\" In 1998, William Hagan, a descendant of Patrick Hagan, had the stone re-erected and restored to prominence.\n\n* * *\n\nPatrick Hagan was born about 1800 in Ireland. Possibly he arrived in Philadelphia on the ship, Woodthrup Sims, on August 1, 1818. He lived for a time in Bourbon County, Kentucky. There he married Cassandra Jane Boulden, daughter of Thomas Boulden, on November 15, 1829, near Millersburg at the edge of Nicholas County. Rev. Robert M. Battson of Carlisle officiated. They moved to Missouri, and Patrick and Cassandra were listed in the 1830 Census of Lincoln County. Patrick drowned near St. Charles, probably in the Missouri River, on April 15, 1836. As Perrin noted, he was trying to get some horses across the river. The body was never recovered. Cassandra and the children returned to Bourbon County. The 1850 census there lists her, age 43, but not the children. (p. 235) Later she remarried, this time to John Kennedy Ashurst, on October 15, 1851. She died on September 25, 1884. Here are the two children of Patrick and Cassandra Boulden Hagan:\n\n1. James Thomas Hagan was born on April 25, 1831. More later.\n\n2. William Kelly Hagan was born on March 17, 1833. He was killed by a horse on August 17, 1851.\n\n* * *\n\nJames Thomas Hagan was born on April 25, 1831, in Lincoln County, Missouri. He married Annie Eliza Talbott on February 11, 1858, in Bourbon County, Kentucky. The marriage bond notes that he was 26, born in Lincoln County, Missouri, and a resident of Bath County. She was 18, and born in Bourbon County. Annie was the daughter of Louis and Sarah Divine Jones Talbott of Bourbon County, and was born on March 19, 1840. According to family records, she attended the Flowerdale Academy. They were married by Rev. William Giltner in the bedroom of Annie Talbott's mother, Sarah, at Pleasant Hill Plantation. Sarah was in bed at the time with a broken arm, sustained when she was thrown from a horse, while carrying a basket of dishes at the Friendship Baptist Church near Winchester. James and Annie Hagan farmed and reared their family. Between 1860 and 1876 they lived in Clark County. The 1860 Clark County Census, page 813, gives this brief information:\n\nJames T. Hagan 29 M Mo.\n\nAnn E. \" 20 F Ky.\n\nThe 1870 Clark County Census, page 108-109, indicates that they were living in the Winchester District, near the Bourbon County line, and adds this information:\n\nJames T. Hagan 39 Farmer 10,500 2280 Ky.\n\nAnn \" 30 \"\n\nLewis \" 8 \"\n\nWilliam \" 6 \"\n\nCharles \" 4 \"\n\nLeslie \" 2 \"\n\nWare \" 1 \"\n\nShortly thereafter, they moved to Bourbon County, about three miles east of Clintonville, where they purchased a farm, called Maple Grove. Their large frame house was built in 1850. James died on April 26, 1896, after falling off a ladder. He must have lingered a couple days after the accident, for he wrote his will on April 24. Here is a copy of his will as recorded in the courthouse:\n\nI James T. Hagan of the County of Bourbon, State of Kentucky do make this my last will and testament.\n\nFirst that all my just debts be paid, after which whatever is left of my state I give & bequeath the whole to my beloved wife Anna to do as she pleases with. If any thing remains at her death I will it be divided equally between my children except Lewis, William & Charles, all of whom have had more than their share of my estate. I hereby named my beloved wife Anna Executrix without bond.\n\nIn witness whereof I hereunto set my hand this 24 day of April of 1896.\n\nJames T. Hagan\n\nSigned & acknowledged by James T. Hagan in our presence.\n\nGeo. W. Morrow\n\nLeslie Hagan\n\nAnnie lived for many more years, and died on January 14, 1934, at the Maple Grove farm. Both are buried in the Clintonville Cemetery.\n\nHere is a copy of Annie's obituary, probably from the Paris newspaper:\n\nMrs. Annie E. Hagan\n\nDies Near Clintonville\n\nMrs. Annie E. Hagan, one of Bourbon County's oldest and sweetest characters, died at her home Sunday afternoon at 2:15 o'clock after a short illness. She had been very active for one of her years and up to almost the last had helped her daughters in housekeeping. Mrs. Hagan was a native of Bourbon County born at the place now owned by Mr. and Mrs. A.L. Stephenson, 3 1/2 miles north of Clintonville on the Paris Road, on March 19, 1840. Had she lived to that date she would have been 94 years of age.\n\nShe was the widow of the late James T. Hagan, successful farmer and for many years a valued member of the Bourbon Fiscal Court who died about forty years ago. She was the daughter of Louis Talbott and Sarah Jones Talbott, was of a family of four, two brothers, W.

(JFaulconer@aol.com)\n\nTHE JONES FAMILY OF BOURBON COUNTY\n\nContributed by Jim Faulconer (JFaulconer@aol.com)\n\nThe Jones family is most plentiful, and therefore difficult to trace. Yet the line we are tracing begins in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, and that narrows down the search. There is no proof of the early connections, but here is our best guess.\n\nOn July 18, 1772, William Beverley sold his land in Spotsylvania County to Alexander Spotswood. Here is an abstract by Crozier:\n\nWilliam Beverley of King and Queen Co. to the Honorable Alexander Spotswood,\n\nEsqr., Governor of Va. Whereas the sd. Alexr. Spotswood and Robert Beverley\n\nof the Co. of King and Queen, Gentle., Decd., and Thomas Jones of Wmburg.,\n\nMerchant., did enter into a copartnership for the carrying on the design of melting\n\nand casting of iron, and for that purpose the sd. Beverley and Jones by patent\n\nbearing date Feby. 20, 1719, did obtain a grant of 15,000 a. of land in Spts. Co., formerly part of Essex Co., commonly called or known by the name of the\n\nIronmine Land, etc., Robert Beverleys share be devised and bequeathed to the\n\nsd. Wm. Beverley, by his last will and testament, the sd., Wm. Beverley disposing\n\nof it by this deed to Spotswood for L180 6s. 8d. ster. and L390 1 1/2d. curr.\n\nWitnesses: John Waller, R. Booker, Jno. Quarles. Rec. Decr. 4, 1722.\n\nQuite likely the Thomas Jones, who owned land in Spotsylvania County in those early days, was the first Jones of this line. His wife and children are unknown, but we suspect that one son was James Jones.\n\n* * *\n\nJames Jones was mentioned briefly in this abstract by Crozier:\n\nOct. 23, 1734. Alexander Spotswood, Esqr., to James Jones, Senr. Lease of 200\n\na. in St. Marks Parish, Spts. Co., on S. side Rapidan--part of tract granted sd.\n\nSpotswood and called Spts. tract, etc. Thomas Jones and James Jones sons of sd.\n\nJames Jones, Senr., etc. John Grame, Tho. Sims, William x Morton. Nov. 5,\n\n1734.\n\nOct. 6, 1741. James Jones planter, and Mary, his wife, of St. Geo. Par., Spts. Co.,\n\nto Joseph Hawkins, planter, of same Par. and county. L10 curr. 200 a. in Spts.\n\nCo. Larkin Chew, Isaac Darnell. Oct. 6, 1741.\n\nIn all likihood, James Jones was married to Mary Sharp, daughter of Stephen and Elizabeth Sharp of Spotsylvania County. Stephen wrote his will on March 12, 1735, and it was proved on June 3, 1735. In it he mentioned his wife and executor, Elizabeth Sharp; Hoke Grayson; Mary Jones; Elizabeth James; and John Grayson.\n\nHere, then, are the probable children of James Jones:\n\n1. Thomas Jones died in 1778, and Elizabeth Jones, widow, was named administrator. More below.\n\n2. James Jones.\n\n* * *\n\nThomas Jones, son of James and Mary Sharp Jones, lived out his life in Spotsylvania County, but the records on him are scant indeed. He died in 1778, and his wife, Elizabeth, was named administrator. W.H. Perrin mentions him in a biographical sketch on Thomas Jones, a descendant, in the History of Scott, Bourbon, Harrison and Nicholas Counties, Kentucky, page 474: James Jones who was born about the year 1758, in Spottsylvania County, Va., son of Thomas Jones, a Virginian; James Jones was a Revolutionary soldier, also his brother, William, who was present at the surrender of Cornwallis. This, then tells us of two sons of Thomas and Elizabeth Jones of Spotsylvania County. Circumstantial evidence suggests another brother as well, and we list him also:\n\n1. James Jones. More below.\n\n2. William Jones, a Revolutionary Soldier. It is possible that he settled in Clermont County, Ohio.\n\n3. Thomas Jones was born on March 6, 1757, was in the Revolutionary War, and married Nancy Ann Hawkins, daughter of John Hawkins in Spotsylvania County. Virginia D. McComas of Tacoma, Washington, has done extensive research on the Jones, and suggests that he was possibly a son of Thomas and Elizabeth Jones, and brother to James and William. His enlistment in 1776 was in Frederick County where I then resided. Thomas lived in Bourbon County, Kentucky, in 1832; and applied for his Revolutionary War Pension. He died by July 1, 1833.\n\n* * *\n\nJames Jones, son of Thomas and Elizabeth Jones of Spotsylvania County, Virginia, was born about 1758, according to the sketch by Perrin. The sketch goes on to say that James married Sally Schooler, also a native of the Old Dominion. This marriage took place in St. Georges Church in Fredericksburg on August 17, 1782, according to the records there. Sally was Salathial Schooler, daughter of Benjamin and ? Devine Schooler of Spotsylvania County. James was a Revolutionary soldier, according to Perrin. Perrin added that James Jones was a farmer, and raised a family of ten children--eleven being born; the educational advantages afforded the family were very poor indeed. L.V. Hagan, Jr., a descendant, wrote in 1953, James Jones was put in the Revolution at Yorktown under Washington; he migrated to Kentucky, locating (on Baughmans Creek near Athens) in Fayette County in 1789 moving to Bourbon County in 1799; he (and wife) joined Stoney Point Regular Baptist Church, 1837; he acquired about 800 acres of land at Jones Crossroad in Bourbon County; and he had a small cigar factory in Clintonville. In 1883, on the back of a Thomas Jones funeral ticket, Cynthia Rebecca Jones Wright (1842-1915) wrote, The surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, Oct. 19, 1781 - my great-grandfather, James Jones and his brother William Jones were there - also my great-grandfather, Benj. Penn, went through the Revolutionary War.\n\nWe should note at this point that the late L.V. Hagan, Jr., of Bourbon County, Kentucky, believed and wrote that James Jones was born in North Carolina. We believe L.V. was confused by the fact that Bourbon County had two James Jones, both of whom had fathers by the name of Thomas. Virginia McComas research refutes Mr. Hagans claim that James father, Thomas, is the one who married Affia Ashurst from North Carolina, and died in Bourbon County in 1813. According to depositions in the Bourbon County Court, regarding land suits, that particular Thomas Jones was born in 1745. This would make him an unlikely candidate to father James in 1758! Mr. Hagans research on the children of James Jones, utilizing family and Bible records, seems much more reliable.\n\nJames Jones wrote his will in 1835, and it was proved in 1839 as follows:\n\nIn the name of God, Amen. I James Jones of the County of Bourbon and State of Kentucky, being weak in body, but of sound disposing mind,and knowing the uncertainty of life, and certainty of death, do make, ordain and publish this, my last Will and Testament, hereby revoking all others, or former Wills.\n\nFirst I recommend my soul to God that gave it, and that my body should be\n\ndecently buried.\n\nSecond. It is my will and desire that first my Executor hereafter to be named,\n\nshall, out of the proceeds of estate, pay all my just debts.\n\nThird. I will and bequeath to my loving wife, Sally Jones, the plantation on which\n\nI now live, a negro man, Tom and his wife Plucky (?), two horses, two milch\n\ncows, one bed and furniture, two pair of gear, two ploughs, and such other articles\n\nof household and kitchen furniture, and part of the stock of hogs as she choose to\n\ntake or keep. These articles, with Land and Negroes, is given during her natural\n\nlife for a support and maintainance.\n\nFourth. I will and bequeath to daughter, Patsy Foster, three hundred dollars in cash, out of my Estate, to make her equal to my married children.\n\nFifth.
