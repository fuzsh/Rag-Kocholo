        "text": "How did this happen?\n\nHow did Peninsula High, a school with a rich football tradition and an enrollment of about 2,500, come to forfeit its varsity football season with three games remaining when schools with much smaller enrollments continue to field teams?\n\nPeninsula has turned out NFL players like Clark Haggans, John Welbourn, Colin Baxter, Craig Stevens and Erik Lorig, and dozens of NCAA Division I players, including Petros Papadakis, Scott and Todd Huber, Erik and David Pedersen and Andrew Peeke.\n\nThe Panthers captured a CIF Southern Section Division II championship with a 14-0 season under coach Gary Kimbrell in 1997, when it had a four-headed monster rushing the ball in Cabot Denny, Brad Durbin and Peeke and quarterback Greg Beal and teams would pack the box.\n\nPeninsula had several Bay League titles and deep playoff runs during the 1990s and into the turn of the century.\n\nAfter Rolling Hills, Miraleste and Palos Verdes merged into one school and became Peninsula High in 1991, Kimbrell went 94-16 and won six Bay League titles with a well-oiled power running game before retiring to Hawaii after the 1999 season.\n\nSome might say: End of story — that’s when the magic died.\n\nPost-Kimbrell\n\nBut Peninsula had success under Tony Uruburu, who took over in 2000 and led the team to a 9-3 record.\n\nThe next three years were a bit tenuous. Peninsula went 15-14-3 the next three seasons under Uruburu, but rebounded in 2004, when it went 11-1-1, and 2005, when it went 11-2 — a pair of Bay League title teams.\n\nThe program went downhill from there during a time when PV High, which reopened in 2002, was competitive in football again and receiving some of the football talent on the Hill.\n\nPeninsula went 3-7 in 2006 and 4-6 in 2007 under Uruburu, who said he’d coached there long enough and was done. Then Peninsula hired co-coaches Adam Boyd and Kevin Moen.\n\nThe co-head coach situation never worked. Peninsula went 4-7 and 0-10 in the first two seasons under Boyd and Moen. Boyd and Moen finished 11-30 in four years, then Boyd went 2-8 in his one year running the Panthers solo.\n\nMichael Christensen, a respected coach who had success at Carson and other schools, then was brought in to take over the program.\n\nBut Christensen battled a numbers problem from Day 1, and struggled to a 4-6 season in 2013 and a 3-7 season in 2014 before starting this year with 27 players and no freshman team.\n\nPeninsula went 2-5 and, because of injuries, the roster dropped to 21 players before the school administration pulled the plug. Not because 21 players is not enough to field a team, but because the 21 included several inexperienced and undersized players going against bigger elite players on strong teams, Peninsula Athletic Director Wendell Yoshida said.\n\nBut what led to the drop in football interest among the student body, and the cancellation of the season, which infuriated so many parents and students?\n\nThe reasons are many, but here are the key factors:\n\nConcussion injuries\n\nWith concussions in the news more and more, some parents on the Hill are simply prohibiting their children from playing football.\n\n“We have a lot of kids on campus who can play, size-wise, but don’t,” Yoshida said. “I talk to a lot of kids and say, ‘Hey, why don’t you play football?’ They say, ‘My parents won’t let me.’ Other kids say they just want to focus on one sport and don’t want to get injured. Then there are club sports year-around. People try to pin it on one thing, but there are a lot of variables.”\n\nConcussions are not exclusive to football, and might be as prevalent in sports like soccer and lacrosse. But they seem to be more associated with football.\n\n“I think there are probably multiple reasons for the low numbers these days on the Hill,” Palos Verdes coach Guy Gardner said. “However, in most other cities, I don’t see the numbers dropping. I bet they don’t have this problem at Narbonne or Serra. I think there is a lot of misinformation out there, mixed in with some truth, with someone’s statistics to back up whatever you want to believe.\n\n“Concussions may be part of it, but you can’t tell me that soccer and lacrosse escape that risk. Water polo is a contact sport, and baseballs don’t feel too good when hit in the head. Also, we’ve done so much to lessen the chances of concussion, and recognize and treat them appropriately. So, I think that’s only part of the challenge.”\n\nSports specialization and club sports\n\nMore student-athletes are playing just one sport, and those kids play the sport year-round because club sports are so prevalent. Kids who play club soccer and high school soccer, or club basketball and high school basketball, get very little off time. Typically, they are not playing football as well.\n\n“I think another challenge is that more kids and parents are specializing in only one sport,” Gardner said. “I bet there are some really good football players who stay in only baseball, lacrosse, basketball, or another sport, because they really believe that will pave the way to college for them.\n\n“What they fail to realize is that many of the D-1 athletes played two sports in high school (many played football) and the odds of them getting a D-1 scholarship in any sport — straight out of high school — is probably about 1 percent or less. But some club and personal coaches may be leading them on.”\n\nSchool boundaries\n\nThere are no boundaries within the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, so incoming freshmen football players could choose PV over Peninsula based on the success the team has had. It works both ways, too. In girls tennis, Peninsula has had all the success in recent years, and tennis talent has flocked to Peninsula instead of PV. Peninsula just won its sixth straight Bay League girls tennis title and is swinging for its third consecutive CIF-SS Division 1 and Southern California Regional title.\n\n“The fact that we don’t have boundaries has hurt, because a lot of kids are going to PV and they’ve been more successful (in football),” Yoshida said. “Kids pick and choose their school.”\n\nBlame the Catholic schools\n\nCatholic schools like Loyola and St. John Bosco have been receiving standout South Bay student-athletes for a long time. UCLA quarterback Josh Rosen was born in Manhattan Beach and spent time growing up on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Like many athletes on the Hill, he was a tennis standout before choosing to concentrate on football going into high school — at St. John Bosco. And no, he’s not Catholic.\n\nChanging tide\n\nContinuity is king. When a school changes coaches, it opens up the possibility of more players fleeing than otherwise would be the case. At Peninsula, interest in football seemed to wane during the Boyd-Moen era. Consistent losing tends do that.\n\nChristensen always had a big job in front of him. Interest was low, numbers were decreasing, losses were mounting and a winning team was right across the Hill in the same school district.\n\nSo Peninsula is faced with building up its program, and would like to do it outside of the Bay League. Yoshida indicated he’ll try to spearhead a restructuring of the three leagues in the South Bay Athletic Association (Bay, Pioneer, Ocean), so Peninsula can be grouped with teams closer to its level.\n\n“Maybe we’ll be in a new Pioneer or Ocean league,” Yoshida said. “We’ll have returning kids and some new kids and we’ll start from scratch.”\n\nWhether there’s a future for varsity football at Peninsula High is still uncertain. If there is, what shape it will take depends on as many factors as went into the program’s demise.\n\n“I hope it’s only a wave that we need to ride out, and that kids and parents up here will continue to see the positive lessons and great memories that a team sport like football can give them, and the spirit it can bring to their school and the community,” Gardner said."
