        "text": "Yinzer Crazy Contributor Dylan Stamper. Follow him on Twitter @King_Stamper\n\nGrowing up, the first Steelers team I began watching religiously was the 2005-06 Super Bowl XL Championship squad. Being a 6-7 year old kid, naturally I didn’t have the knowledge of NFL Analysts or the ability to name a full 53-Man Roster. However, studying the game and the team grew on me as the season progressed. One name that has stuck with me throughout my life from that magnificent team is Clark Haggans.\n\nAbout six days ago, our Steelers Nation family got the news that we had lost another amazing soul. Clark Haggans was born on January 10, 1977, in Torrance, California. Clark had a great frame of a body for an outside linebacker standing at 6 '4”, and 243 lbs. Haggans was a very efficient defensive player for Colorado State University and still to this day holds the school career record for 33 sacks. Meanwhile, also leading a couple of those late 1990 CSU teams to two conference championships. That hard work and determination over his four-year tenure at CSU led him to the 2000 NFL Draft where he was selected in the Fifth Round, at pick 137 overall, by the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nHaggans spent eight years of his career playing for the Steelers and was a part of the first championship winning team since 1980. He meshed perfectly with a legendary group of starting linebackers that included James Farrior, Larry Foote, and none other than Joey Porter. Porter would gain a lot of attention that allowed Haggans to make plays when needed in big moments. One of the highlights the Yinzers will never forget, is the sack he had on the opening drive of Super Bowl 40 on Matt Hasselbeck.\n\nIn his career with Pittsburgh, Haggans accumulated 225 solo tackles, 32.5 sacks, 12 forced fumbles, and one interception. He helped bring a Lombardi back to the Steel City, which us fans will always be grateful for."
