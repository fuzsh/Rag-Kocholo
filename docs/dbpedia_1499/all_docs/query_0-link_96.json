        "text": "So here is my post Senior Bowl mock draft. I'm sure to make some people happy with my new pick for the Steelers. As always I look forward to your questions, comments, and conversations.\n\n1. St. Louis Rams: Jimmy Clausen QB, Notre Dame\n\nThis pick is not going to change from a QB unless the Rams find one in free agency like Jason Campbell or trade for one. Their number one priority has to be to find a new Quarterback. In the last two years they have passed on Matt Ryan and Mark Sanchez. GM’s don’t think to themselves, \"We’ll be bad enough to get the top QB next year\" and neither do head coaches who only have a very limited time to prove their worth. For a great example of this you only have to look to last year’s draft. Many said that Aaron Curry was much more of a sure thing than Matt Stafford. New Lions coach Jim Schwartz, with a defensive coordinators back ground, still took the QB instead of a top D prospect because he knows that a team starts with a QB. Nebraska DT Ndamukong Suh is a great player but he’s not going to single-handedly wins games for them. Even if Suh did win them 3 more games than they would’ve, then they wouldn’t be drafting high enough to get next years top QB Jake Locker. Clausen had a great junior season and has the added bonus of having played in a pro-style offense under center. Heading into an uncapped year means the Rams can dump Marc Bulger’s salary without any future consequences.\n\n2. Detroit Lions: Ndamukong Suh DT, Nebraska\n\nWhat the Lions need most is an impact player. This team needs playmakers everywhere other than QB and TE. They need a cornerstone LT to protect their 40 million dollar man in Matt Stafford but Suh is too great a player to pass on. After watching Suh absolutely dominate Texas’ lineman in the Big12 championship to the tune of 4 & ½ sacks and being the first defensive player since 1997 to be invited to the Heisman ceremony, he looks to be the best defensive lineman prospect since Warren Sapp. At this pick, the only other options I can see them going with are Russell Okung or Eric Berry. But if Suh is available they would be crazy to pass on him.\n\n3. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Gerald McCoy DT, Oklahoma\n\nThe Bucs messed themselves up winning just enough games to take them out of the Suh sweepstakes. Unfortunately he is no longer available but getting McCoy is not a bad option. Many consider him to be the most technically sound DT in this draft, even more so than Suh. Not having a need for a QB or LT means that this pick would pretty much only be Eric Berry or perhaps even Derrick Morgan if they decide to not go with McCoy. Trading back with a pick this high isn’t really much of an option as other teams will not want to pay the amount of guaranteed money expected to a top 3 pick. It’s also not out of the realm of possibility that they trade up with the Rams to get Suh, as the Rams would still be able to get Clausen here.\n\n4. Washington Redskins: Sam Bradford QB, Oklahoma\n\nRegardless of whether or not you’re a Jason Campbell fan the fact remains that this team is not winning with him. I know a lot of the problems are because of the injuries to the offensive line but Snyder is going to go with a flashy, big name like Bradford, especially now that Mike Shanahan has been hired as the new head coach. As ESPN has reported, Bradford is having his shoulder operated on by the renowned Dr. James Andrews, who also just happens to be the Redskins team doctor. So Snyder will definitely have the inside track on whether Bradford’s shoulder is going to hold up. If Snyder doesn’t think Bradford’s shoulder will hold up they will target Russell Okung, Bruce Campbell, or Anthony Davis since no other QB is worthy of a pick this high.\n\n5. Kansas City Chiefs: Russell Okung OT, Oklahoma State\n\nMatt Cassell needs a LT that will give him enough time to throw the ball down field. KC spent a lot of money on Cassell and it would be nice if they got a return on their investment. It would also allow them to move 2008 1st round pick Brandon Albert to LG, his natural position, since it doesn't seem like he can make it playing on the outside. Okung is the top OT in the draft and would be a great addition to the Chiefs O-line. He's athletic, uses his hands very well, and has quick feet to get out in front of speed rushers. If they are somehow still confident that Albert can play LT then this pick could change to Eric Berry or even Rolando McClain.\n\n6. Seattle Seahawks: Eric Berry S, Tennessee\n\nI’ve changed this pick to Berry because with two early first round picks, there is plenty of OT talent but Berry is too good to pass on. If Okung were available they would probably go for him, but given Bruce Campbell’s injury history they will elect to go with Berry would many consider an Ed Reed clone. Not only myself but every draft pundit you hear, including Mel Kiper and Todd McShay of ESPN, have said that Berry is an absolute stud and top player of this draft. Berry is a nightmare for opposing QB's. College teams don't even throw in his direction. He's got a nose for the ball and is a serious threat to take a pick back to the house every time. I will give new Head Coach Pete Carroll enough credit to go with talent over the familiarity he has with Taylor Mays.\n\n7. Cleveland Browns: Joe Haden CB, Florida\n\nCleveland needs help everywhere except for LT where they have Joe Thomas. A lot of draft lovers think they will target a QB, but I’m not sure the franchise is quite ready to give up on Brady Quinn, especially when there is no more 1st round talents QB’s left, although they may target one in the later rounds. Haden is the only elite corner in this draft class and landing him would be a decent consolation prize after missing out on Berry. If they elect to keep the 3-4 defense this pick may turn to Rolando McClain.\n\n8. Oakland Raiders: Carlos Dunlap DE, Florida\n\nWith Taylor Mays completely lost during Senior Bowl practices, I will give the Crypt Keeper(Al Davis) enough credit to know how much of a gamble he would be with a top 10 pick, although I’m sure that will come back to haunt me. Unfortunately with Clausen and Bradford gone Oakland won’t get a replacement for the failed JaMarcus Russell experiment. When the combine rolls around Davis will absolutely fall in love with Dunlap’s freakish measureables. In my opinion Dunlap is this year’s Vernon Gholston. If Joe Haden can run a sub 4.4 at the combine he would immediately jump to the top of Davis’ list if he’s available.\n\n9. Buffalo Bills: Anthony Davis OT, Rutgers\n\nThe Bills will look to fill their biggest need which is gaping hole left by the Jason Peters trade to Philly. Davis is an absolute mauler who has continued to rise up draft boards everywhere. They may also consider Rolando McClain to help shore up that horrendous run defense. There’s also an outside chance they may pick Derrick Morgan but it’s unlikely since they selected pass rusher Aaron Maybin in the first round of last years draft.\n\n10. Jacksonville Jaguars: Derrick Morgan DE, Georgia Tech\n\nThe Jags young receiving corps has come on this year and as such seems to be no longer a dire position of need. This team needs a DE as the Jags make the transition back to after a woeful attempt at using a 3-4. Morgan has distinguished himself as the top DE for a 4-3 as he is an excellent pass rusher. Florida QB Tim Tebow may become are real option for them, especially since team owner Wayne Weaver had said previously that he would draft him given the opportunity. They could really use a big name to lure fans to the game so they don’t eventually become the L.A. Jaguars. I know he isn’t a first round talent but picking him wouldn’t be about talent, it would be about selecting a local hero who will bring fans to the game.\n\n11. Denver Broncos(via Chicago Bears): Rolando McClain ILB, Alabama\n\nLook for the Broncos to take the best defensive player available. McClain is a natural leader, is continuing to rise up draft boards, and would be a perfect fit considering he already plays in a 3-4 defense at Alabama. The Broncos have very few holes to fill as they have plenty of young talent that will develop over time. But after going 6-0 they have been exposed for their lack of the deep ball. If given the opportunity they may look to go QB with this pick as they really need a strong armed QB that can sling it downfield, especially with a receiving core of Eddie Royal, Brandon Stokley, and Brandon Marshall, but only if Bradford manages to slip this far. If they finally manage to trade Marshall this offseason they may look at Dez Bryant with this pick as well.\n\n12. Miami Dolphins: Dez Bryant WR, Oklahoma State\n\nI know team Architect Bill Parcells typically doesn’t draft WR’s in the first round but none of the talent available that fills a position of need is worthy of this pick. They could trade back to the end of the first round and target Jerry Hughes which would fill their greatest position of need. They may also consider Tenn. NT Dan Williams. The suspension of Bryant for lying about conversations with Deion Sanders will not hurt is draft stock. He’s got all the intangibles you look for in a receiver and looks a lot like Andre Johnson did when he came out of Miami. He’s the type of receiver who would be perfect for the progression of young QB Chad Henne considering their patience has worn thin with supposed no.1 WR Ted Ginn. If McClain slips past Denver I would expect him to be the pick here.\n\n13. San Francisco 49ers: Bryan Bulaga, OT, Iowa\n\nThe 49ers biggest need is for a RT and they find a great one in Bulaga. He really showed his worth with a great performance against top 10 pick Derrick Morgan in the Orange Bowl. They may also consider taking a NT like Dan Williams considering current nose tackle Aubrayo Franklin will be a free agent. The 49ers also need help in the secondary so Earl Thomas may be an option for them as well if Bulaga is off the board.\n\n14. Seattle Seahawks (via Denver Broncos): Bruce Campbell OT, Maryland\n\nNeither Walter Jones nor Sean Locklear can seem to stay healthy, with Jones retirement seeming like a certainty at the end of the season. Campbell has managed to slip this far due to a pretty long injury history but if he passes his physical at the combine he may go higher than this. The Hawks may also look for a RB, especially since the electrifying Spiller is still on the board, but they should be able to grab either Cal’s Jahvid Best or Georgia Tech’s Jonathan Dwyer in the second round at a greater value.\n\n15. New York Giants: Brian Price DT, UCLA\n\nPrice has probably seen his stock soar more than any other prospect since the end of the college season and would be a great addition as the Giants continue to stockpile D linemen. They could also use a replacement for Kareem McKenzie who is over 30 and starting to show his age but this need can be addressed in the later rounds. MLB Antonio Pierce’s play has dropped of considerably this year but with McClain already off the board they will have to wait as this is too high for Brandon Spikes.\n\n16. Tennessee Titans: Dan Williams NT, Tennessee\n\nWho would have thought that after a 0-6 start that Vince Young would salvage their season? They have multiple needs but Young’s play means they won’t be looking for a QB. Cornerback is their biggest need but without one worthy of this pick they’ll address their D-line which has been exposed by the loss of Albert Haynesworth to free agency. Dan Williams is a big run-stuffing, space-eating mammoth much like Haynesworth is and taking a homer is always a fan favorite. The word out of SB (Senior Bowl) practices was that he proved his worth as the top DT against the run and then backed it up in the game.\n\n17. San Francisco 49ers(via Carolina Panthers): C.J. Spiller RB, Clemson\n\nAfter having taken care of their need for a RT with their first pick in the round, they get the luxury of bolstering their RB corps. What they need is secondary help and rush linebackers, so Earl Thomas would become a real option, but they will target Spiller who would be an immediate change of pace, impact player to compliment Frank Gore.\n\n18. Pittsburgh Steelers: Mike Iupati OG, Idaho\n\nWithout question the Steelers greatest need is on the defensive side of the ball, especially at safety and nose tackle. Current NT Casey Hampton is 32 years old, a free agent, and with two Super Bowl rings already on his chubby fingers he may seek a big pay day somewhere else. Ryan Clark is a free agent and he’s over 30 years old as is Tyrone Carter who played horribly week in and week out in Troy Polamalu’s absence. They also need to find an eventual replacement for James Farrior. His play declined dramatically this past year, he’s 34 years old, and since it takes a couple years for linebackers to learn the system anyway it would be nice to find his replacement now. Keyarn Fox has filled in admirably at ILB for Lawrence Timmons but is not a permanent solution. Besides, Fox is too valuable as a special teamer. Unfortunately the probable top targets of Eric Berry, Rolando McClain, and Dan Williams are all already off the board. Iupati was outstanding in his SB practices and has solidified himself as a 1st round pick. During the game he dominated him opponents except for one time when he got beat by UGA’s Jeff Owens. He would fill the one weak point at RG where Darnell Stapleton and Trai Essex are lacking and rookie Craig Urbik didn’t show much during the off season. They may give Texas FS Earl Thomas a hard look here, but I think the Steelers will ultimately pass on him given that he’s more of a finesse player. Fortunately there’s still going to be some talent in the 2nd round such as South Florida’s Nate Allen and Georgia Tech’s Morgan Burnett, and in the 3rd with Georgia’s Reshad Jones. Cornerback could also be another option considering none of the rookies from last year have seemed to distinguish themselves, although the only option in the 1st would be to trade up for Joe Haden. If he’s available we should definitely take Rolando McClain or even try to trade up for him. A lot of people are high on Florida ILB Brandon Spikes, who may be great against the run but is somewhat of a liability in zone coverage. An option in the third round would be TCU ILB Daryl Washington. A player I really like in the later rounds would be Baylor’s ILB Joe Pawelek although I suspect the Steelers would rather target a homer like PSU’s Sean Lee. After watching him in the Orange Bowl, I really like Iowa’s Pat Angerer in the later rounds as well. Clemson RB C.J. Spiller would be a slightly long-shot option if he were available. Willie Parker is most likely not going to be resigned in the off season and Spiller would be a great speedy compliment to Mendenhall’s power for a lot less cost than Parker.\n\n19. Atlanta Falcons: Earl Thomas S, Texas\n\nThe Falcons will take the best defensive player available, particularly an OLB or DE. Previously I had them taking Ole’ Miss. DE Greg Hardy but he has some injury issues the last two years and wasn’t even able to finish out this season. They manage to luck out with Thomas who has the versatility to play both safety spots as well as cornerback.\n\n20. Houston Texans: Damian Williams WR, USC\n\nThe Texans need help in multiple areas, specifically on defense if they let the unhappy Dunta Robinson leave via free agency, but without any of the top safeties or Joe Haden available look for them to add to an already potent offense. They also have needs in the interior defensive line after sending former 1st round pick Travis Johnson to the Chargers earlier in the year. Damian Williams would pair nicely with Andre Johnson, and fill a position of need if Kevin Walter isn’t resigned. He’s considered the most polished receiver in the draft and would give an immediate boost in the return game.\n\n21. Cincinnati Bengals: Brandon LaFell WR, LSU\n\nThe Bengals only real needs are for WR’s and safeties and with the talent currently available they will opt for LaFell to help make their offense more explosive. Outside of Chad OchoCinco, none of their WR’s has had much of an impact this year. If LaFell is off the board at this point they would certainly consider Oklahoma TE Jermaine Gresham.\n\n22. New England Patriots: Sergio Kindle DE/OLB, Texas\n\nThe Patriots need more youth and depth in their linebacking corps. Kindle lines up all over the field for Texas and is the sort of versatile player Belichick loves. He had a great showing in the Championship game and solidified himself as a first round pick. It wouldn’t shock me to see them draft Tim Tebow if he slips past Jacksonville. He could be their QB for life after Brady. And yes I know this is high for a QB who could be a back-up for a few years, but he can also serve as an H-back and be put in for trick plays such as the Wildcat. He also has that air of smugness that reminds me of Brady that I hate so much. Given how much the Patriots like to trade back, it would actually surprise me if they keep this pick, especially considering how deep the talent pool is in this draft.\n\n23. Green Bay Packers: Charles Brown OT, USC\n\nFortunately because of such a deep draft class the Packers are lucky enough to get Brown here. They have had to compensate for the lack of talent at OT by adjusting their scheme to keep TE’s in to block. Adding some OT depth would really help open up that potent offense. They may look to add an OLB to replace Aaron Kampman who’s in the final year of his contact and clearly not comfortable after making the switch from DE to OLB. Green Bay also needs to start looking at replacements for their aging secondary but will find better value for the in the next 2 rounds.\n\n24. Philadelphia Eagles: Greg Hardy DE, Ole’ Miss.\n\nWithout any tackle prospects left to replace the often injured Shawn Andrews, look for the Eagles to take the top DE or Linebacker prospect available. They need to fill the DE spot opposite of Trent Cole. Hardy has some injury issues but is adept at playing both the run and the pass. They would also consider OLB Sean Weatherspoon.\n\n25. Baltimore Ravens: Jermaine Gresham TE, Oklahoma\n\nThis is a toss-up between a WR and Oklahoma TE Jermaine Gresham. Todd Heap has been surprisingly healthy this year which is the first time in a long time. They could really use a WR to replace the aging Derrick Mason who is giving serious consideration to retirement again. Even though Gresham has been out with a knee injury for the year, he will have plenty of time to rehab before the NFL combine. A lot of people will think that the Ravens will draft a CB, especially considering how badly they have been torched through the air, but the Ravens draft on value and there won’t be any other first round CB’s left which is why they won’t consider a safety here to possibly replace Ed Reed. They may consider Golden Tate or Arrelious Benn here.\n\n26. Arizona Cardinals: Jerry Hughes OLB, TCU\n\nArizona’s biggest need is for a LT. They drafted Levi Brown a couple years ago to be a RT when they thought Matt Leinart, a lefty, would be the QB of the future. Well he hasn't been so far and Warner is suffering because of it. If Charles Brown managed to slip I would expect the Card’s to pounce. Outsider linebackers Haggans, Okeafor, and Berry are all 33 years old or older so they will definitely be upgrading with Hughes.\n\n27. Dallas Cowboys: Taylor Mays S, USC\n\nThe Cowboys would be making a big mistake by taking Mays, who’s a mirror image of former Cowboys SS Roy Williams. But he’s just the sort of big name prospect that Jerry Jones loves. They really need a left tackle to replace to declining Flozell Adams but the only option left is Oklahoma’s Trent Williams who struggled all year playing on the left side.\n\n28. San Diego Chargers: Jared Odrick DE, PSU\n\nAssuming they resign or tag LT Marcus McNeill, what they need most is a NT to replace the aging Jamal Williams who was put on IR at the beginning of the season. Unfortunately the only NT with a 1st round grade is already taken. I think that General Manager A.J. Smith is too smart to gamble on \"Mount\" Cody with a 1st round pick given that it’s become highly probably that he’ll eat himself out of the league in a couple years. Their second need is for DE’s that can play in a 3-4. Odrick would be a perfect fit and slips to the end of the first due to a few minor off the field issues.\n\n29. New York Jets: Arthur Jones DE/DT, Syracuse\n\nUnfortunately the Jets biggest needs, particularly a corner to play opposite Darrell Revis and at DT where Kris Jenkins had the second season-ending injury of his career, do not match up with the talent that is currently available. Their 3rd biggest need gets filled with Jones. They may also consider a WR if Williams or LaFell manage to slip.\n\n30. Minnesota Vikings: Sean Weatherspoon OLB, Missouri\n\nThe Vikings will look to shore up the few weak points on a very strong defense. Weatherspoon is the top OLB suited to play in a 4-3 defense. He’s managed to impress everyone in the SB practices with his vocal leadership and enthusiasm. During the game he didn’t disappoint, playing sideline to sideline and showing very good man-coverage skills.\n\n31. New Orleans Saints: Everson Griffen DE, USC\n\nWith an already potent offense the Saints will look to upgrade a defense that has been hot and very cold all season long. Their biggest need is probably a DE to replace Charles Grant, although they also have needs for OLB’s and DB’s as well.\n\n32. Indianapolis Colts: Trent Williams OT, Oklahoma\n\nAs much as I think the Colts need to address their defense with this pick, they will probably keep with the status quo and continue to surround Manning with talent. What they really need, a LT given that former 1st round pick Tony Ugoh has struggled and current starter Charles Johnson is a FA, won’t get filled but will give them the opportunity to shore up the line. By drafting Williams, who’s a mauler, will allow them to move current RT Ryan Diem to the left side. They would also consider a cornerback such as Wake Forest’s Brandon Ghee or Michigan’s Donovan Warren. I gave serious consideration to giving them Brandon Graham who would be a perfect fit in their defense.\n\nRound 2:\n\n33. St. Louis Rams: Donovan Warren CB, Michigan\n\nNow that the Rams have their QB of the future in Clausen, it’s time to turn their attentions to Spagnuolo’s specialty, the defense. Warren is a good all-around corner and would’ve probably gone in the 1st round in any other year.\n\n34. Detroit Lions: Maurkice Pouncey OG/OC, Florida\n\nThe Lions are getting a great interior lineman in Pouncey who’s versatile enough to play Center, Guard, or possibly even Right Tackle.\n\n35. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Arrelious Benn WR, Illinois\n\nThe Bucs need WR’s to help the progression of young QB Josh Freeman. Michael Clayton has been underwhelming so far in his career and Antonio Bryant is well past his prime.\n\n36. Kansas City Chiefs: Terrence Cody DT, Alabama\n\nEven though he may eat himself out of the league in a couple years, which is why he’s slipped out of the 1st round to begin with, the Chiefs are not going to pass up the chance to solidify their defensive front with someone who is going to be a dominant 2-down NT.\n\n37. Washington Redskins: Mike Johnson OG, Alabama With a new QB in hand, it’s time to rebuild that ancient O line. Instead of reaching for an OT they will opt for Johnson who would go great in Shanahan’s zone blocking scheme.\n\n38. Seattle Seahawks: Jahvid Best RB, Cal\n\nThey need better RB’s than Justin Forsett and Julius Jones. Best has slipped to the second round due to injury issues but would be a good value pick here.\n\n39. Cleveland Browns: Brandon Spikes ILB, Florida\n\nThis is a pick of value over need. Spikes has a lot of potential even though the Brownies have a greater need at safety and running back.\n\n40. Oakland Raiders: Jon Asamoah OG, Illinois\n\nHe will probably run the fastest 40 time of any O lineman at the combine and that’s all that matters to Al Davis. This is actually a good pick for them as he holds up very well against the pass rush.\n\n41. Buffalo Bills: Tony Pike QB, Cincinnati.\n\nThe Bills need someone to come in and challenge Trent Edwards. Pike will take some time to develop and add bulk, but he has the potential to be a quality starter in the pros.\n\n42. New England Patriots (via Jacksonville Jaguars): Kyle Wilson CB, Boise State\n\nThe Pats continue to improve on a defense that got old and thin in a hurry. Wilson is holding up well in SB practices.\n\n43. Miami Dolphins: Rickey Sapp DE/OLB, Clemson\n\nGiven Porter and Taylor’s age, this pick should be a no-brainer. The Dolphins need rush linebackers.\n\n44. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (via Chicago Bears): Brandon Graham, DE Michigan\n\nWith Graham they continue to rebuild the D-line and give some outside help to 1st round pick Gerald McCoy. He had a phenomenal showing at the Senior Bowl and may have even gotten himself into the latter half of the 1st round.\n\n45. Denver Broncos: Corey Wootton DE, Northwestern\n\nThey fill their need with a 5-technique DE.\n\n46. New York Giants: Chad Jones SS, LSU\n\nThey need someone to play with Kenny Phillips, or possibly even replace him if he’s not ready to play by next season.\n\n47. Carolina Panthers: Golden Tate WR, Notre Dame\n\nRegardless of whether Delhomme or Moore is the staring QB next season, they need someone to throw to besides Steve Smith.\n\n48. New England Patriots (via Tennessee Titans): Aaron Hernandez TE, Florida\n\nHe would be a suitable replacement for current TE Ben Watson.\n\n49. San Francisco 49ers: Patrick Robinson CB, FSU\n\nKnown for playing soft in his final season but played a great game at the Senior Bowl.\n\n50. Kansas City Chiefs (via Atlanta Falcons): Dexter McCluster RB/WR Ole’ Miss.\n\nMcCluster has probably had the best showing in SB practices, showing off his amazing speed and cutback ability. Personally I think this is a little high for him, but some team is going to view him as the next Percy Harvin.\n\n51. Houston Texans: Brandon Ghee CB, Wake Forest\n\nThey need DB help, especially if they let Dunta Robinson go.\n\n52. Pittsburgh Steelers: Daryl Washington ILB, TCU\n\nThis is where they get their heir-apparent to James Farrior. Washington is another player whose stock is soaring due to great showing at during the SB practices and game.\n\n53. New England Patriots: Tim Tebow QB, Florida\n\nYes I’m sure I’ll hear a lot about this pick. Keep in mind that Belichick loves versatility. And how many years does Brady have left, probably 3? That's how many years it’s going to take for Tebow to acclimate to the Pros. Plus he would fit in well with the type of spread offense the Patriots run.\n\n54. Cincinnati Bengals: Nate Allen FS, USF\n\nWith their second pick, they fill their second biggest need with a good ball-hawking safety.\n\n55. Philadelphia Eagles: Perrish Cox, CB, Oklahoma State\n\nEllis Hobbs is a free agent.\n\n56. Green Bay Packers: Jerome Murphy CB, USF\n\nDoes this pick really need an explanation? They need youth in the secondary and grab a solid corner who reminds me a lot of the Cardinals Bryant McFadden.\n\n57. Baltimore Ravens: Jeremy Williams WR, Tulane\n\nThey fill their biggest need, especially since Derrick Mason will probably retire.\n\n58. Arizona Cardinals: Kyle Calloway OT Iowa\n\nThe Cards pick up a tackle prospect that played just as good as top-15 pick Bryan Bulaga in the Orange Bowl.\n\n59. Dallas Cowboys: Jordan Shipley WR, Texas\n\nThis a bit of a reach but a smart move for Jerry Jones as Shipley is a local favorite and will help sell more tickets. But he’s also a Wes Welker type that could only help Tony Romo.\n\n60. San Diego Chargers: Torrell Troup DT, Central Florida\n\nTroup really wowed people at the East-West shrine game and probably solidified himself as the 3rd best NT in this class. If Jamaal Williams retires they will need some NT depth.\n\n61. New York Jets: Devin McCourty CB, Rutgers\n\nThey need someone stable opposite of Darrell Revis.\n\n62. Minnesota Vikings: Jason Pierre-Paul DE, USF\n\nJPP is a one-year wonder who may be a bit of a reach here in my opinion, but he has a lot of upside and would provide an upgrade over Ray Edwards.\n\n63. New Orleans Saints: Navarro Bowman OLB, PSU\n\nBowman is a steal at this point. He’s slipped due to some off the field issues but would be a great replacement for 30 year old Scott Fujita.\n\n64. Indianapolis Colts: Jermaine Cunningham OLB, Florida\n\nCunningham is a versatile player who can play OLB or DE.\n\nRound 3:\n\n65. St. Louis Rams: LaMarr Houston DT, Texas\n\nPassing on Suh means they need to start upgrading the D line here.\n\n66. Detroit Lions: Jonathan Dwyer RB, Georgia Tech\n\nKevin Smith suffered a serious injury during the year, and they had no depth behind him.\n\n67. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Anthony Dixon RB, MSU\n\nCadillac is a FA and injury prone, and Derrick Ward never lived up to his expectations.\n\n68. Kansas City Chiefs: Dominique Franks CB, Oklahoma\n\nA great addition to a secondary of relative no-names with a good size/speed combo.\n\n69. Oakland Raiders: D’Anthony Smith DT, Louisiana Tech\n\nFastest 300lbs. tackle in the draft aside from Gerald McCoy.\n\n70. Philadelphia Eagles (via Seattle Seahawks): Morgan Burnett FS, Georgia Tech\n\nSean Jones was a huge disappointment last year.\n\n71. Cleveland Browns: Mike Neal DT/DE, Purdue\n\nThey need youth and depth.\n\n72. Buffalo Bills: Vince Oghobaase DT, Duke\n\nHelp that awful run defense.\n\n73. Miami Dolphins: Cam Thomas, NT, UNC\n\nParcells will continue to focus on the defense. They need depth behind 34 year old Jason Ferguson.\n\n74. Chicago Bears: Jeremy Beal DE, Oklahoma\n\nOgunleye and Anderson are both free agents.\n\n75. Jacksonville Jaguars: Kareem Jackson CB, Alabama\n\nTheir secondary seemed to be lacking this past year.\n\n76. New York Giants: Pat Angerer ILB, Iowa\n\nGood replacement for the declining Antonio Pierce.\n\n77. Carolina Panthers: Selvish Capers OT, West Virginia\n\nThey need tackle depth. Capers is extremely raw but has the size to develop into a dominant run blocker.\n\n78. Tennessee Titans: Akwasi Owusu-Ansah CB, IUP\n\nNick Harper can’t handle the number 2 corner duties anymore.\n\n79. San Francisco 49ers: Dekota Watson OLB, FSU\n\nThey need an upgrade over the disappointing Manny Lawson.\n\n80. Denver Broncos: J.D. Walton OC, Baylor\n\nCasey Wiegmann is 36 years old.\n\n81. Houston Texans: Toby Gerhart RB, Stanford\n\nThis pick should be a given. They desperately need a short-yardage power back.\n\n82. Pittsburgh Steelers: Reshad Jones SS, Georgia The Steelers need someone to replace an aging Ryan Clark whose skills are declining. Jones is a faster version of Clark.\n\n83. Atlanta Falcons: A.J. Edds OLB, Iowa\n\nEdds is a solid strong side linebacker.\n\n84. Cincinnati Bengals: Tyson Alualu DT, Cal\n\nHe’s a versatile D lineman that would provide depth to a thin Bengals front.\n\n85. Oakland Raiders (via New England Patriots): LeRoy Vann CB/KR Florida A&M\n\nThis is incredibly high for him as he is graded as a very late round prospect, but he’ll probably run a 4.3 40 at the combine and he’s returned 11 kicks back for TD’s in the last 2 years.\n\n86. Green Bay Packers: Javier Arenas CB, Alabama\n\nGreen Bay continues the youth movement in the secondary.\n\n87. Philadelphia Eagles: Koa Misi OLB, Utah\n\nMisi has been one of the most athletic OLB’s at the SB practices.\n\n88. Baltimore Ravens: Marshawn Gilyard WR, Cincinnati\n\nThey need to add to their cornerback depth but this is a value pick. They continue to bolster their WR corps with my MVP of the Senior Bowl.\n\n89. Arizona Cardinals: Matt Tennant OC, Boston College\n\nThey could use an upgrade at center.\n\n90. Dallas Cowboys: Jason Fox OT, Miami\n\n. This may be a bit of a gamble given Fox’s knee injury, but the Cowboys need to start a youth movement on the O line. If not for the injury Fox would be an early 2nd round selection.\n\n91. San Diego Chargers: Joe McKnight RB, USC\n\nThey will probably cut ties with Tomlinson this offseason. McKnight has the kind of skill-set that the Chargers covet.\n\n92. Cleveland Browns (via New York Jets): Vladimir Ducasse OG, UMass\n\nHe’s a road-grading small school prospect that can also play tackle. His draft stock has taken a bit of a dive at the SB practices and will probably play RG in the pros.\n\n93. Minnesota Vikings: Darrell Stuckey SS, Kansas\n\nHe would be an upgrade over Madieu Williams.\n\n94. New Orleans Saints: Robert Johnson FS, Utah\n\nThe Saints continue to upgrade on defense with a very underrated safety prospect.\n\n95. Indianapolis Colts: George Selvie DE, USF\n\nSelvie was double-teamed all year which caused his stats to drop from the year before. He’s undersized for a 4-3 defensive end but will fit in perfectly for the Colts cover-2 system. DE isn’t a huge need for them just yet, but it will be next year when Mathis and Brock are both FA’s.\n\nRound 4:\n\n96. St. Louis Rams: Eric Decker WR, Minnesota\n\nThe Rams need weapons for 1st round pick Jimmy Clausen.\n\n97. Detroit Lions: Willie Young DE, N.C. State\n\nThey need to put some talent around Suh.\n\n98. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Andre Roberts WR, Citadel\n\nAnother weapon for their young QB, Roberts put himself on the map with a great week at the Senior Bowl.\n\n99. Kansas City Chiefs: Micah Johnson ILB, Kentucky\n\nDerrick Johnson was not on Coach Haley’s good side all year. Even if he is retained they still need ILB depth.\n\n100. Washington Redskins: Ryan Mathews RB, Fresno State They need depth behind an aging Clinton Portis.\n\n101. Seattle Seahawks: Danario Alexander WR, Missouri\n\nOutside of T.J., they really don’t have any other WR to throw the ball to.\n\n102. Cleveland Browns: Myron Rolle SS, FSU\n\nThe Brownies need safeties and Rolle has proved to everyone that he is football-ready at the SB practices.\n\n103. Oakland Raiders: Jacoby Ford WR, Clemson\n\nFord will be one of the fastest WR at the combine, enough said.\n\n104. Buffalo Bills: Sean Lee ILB, PSU\n\nWhy not grab another Penn State LB with injury problems? If he can stay healthy, Lee could be the steal of the draft at this point.\n\n105. Chicago Bears: Eric Olsen OC, Notre Dame\n\nHow long can Olin Kreutz play?\n\n106. Jacksonville Jaguars: Ciron Black OG/OT, LSU\n\nThe Jags could use some interior line depth. Black played OT in college but is better suited to play OG in the pros. Showed good pulling speed and agility during the Senior Bowl.\n\n107. Miami Dolphins: Montario Hardesty RB, Tennessee\n\nRonnie Brown is a free agent this year, and Ricky Williams is a 32 year old who’ll be a FA next year.\n\n108. Carolina Panthers: Austin Lane DE, Murray State\n\nEven with Everette Brown, if they let Julius Peppers walk they will need some depth.\n\n109. Tennessee Titans: Roddrick Muckelroy OLB, Texas\n\nThey need LB depth as they continue to rebuild their defense.\n\n110. San Francisco 49ers: Larry Asante SS, Nebraska\n\nThey need depth in the secondary.\n\n111. Denver Broncos: Jevan Snead QB, Ole’ Miss.\n\nEven if they resign Kyle Orton they will need depth behind him. Snead had an awful season and should have stayed for his senior year but he has a lot of potential.\n\n112. New York Giants: Trevard Lindley CB, Kentucky\n\nThey need some quality corners. Lindley had a disappointing SB but maybe he can redeem himself at the combine.\n\n113. Pittsburgh Steelers: Anthony McCoy TE, USC This is a value pick. McCoy has had a good SB practice and is the best overall TE. Current back-up Matt Spaeth is a FA and has been a disappointment.\n\n114. Atlanta Falcons: Brandon Lang DE, Troy\n\nThe Falcons fill their second biggest need.\n\n115. Houston Texans: John Jerry, Ole’ Miss.\n\nThey need large interior linemen to help an anemic running game. Jerry is 6’6\", 335lbs. and can certainly help with that.\n\n116. New England Patriots: Zane Beadles OT, Utah\n\nTackle depth behind 31 year old Matt Light.\n\n117. Cincinnati Bengals: Sergio Render OG, Virginia Tech.\n\nThey need interior O-line depth.\n\n118. Philadelphia Eagles: Jared Veldheer OT, Hillsdale\n\nAndy Reid loves big linemen and they don’t get any bigger than the 6’9\", 325lbs. small school prospect.\n\n119. Green Bay Packers: Eric Norwood OLB, South Carolina\n\nThey need someone to play opposite of Clay Matthews.\n\n120. Baltimore Ravens: Myron Lewis FS, Vanderbilt\n\nIf Ed Reed retires they’ll need some safety depth.\n\n121. Arizona Cardinals: Jamar Chaney ILB, Miss. State\n\nThey need to continue to a youth movement in the linebacking corps.\n\n122. Dallas Cowboys: Linval Joseph DT, East Carolina\n\nThey could use some depth on the defensive front.\n\n123. San Diego Chargers: Van Eskridge FS, East Carolina\n\nEskridge was named defensive MVP of the East-West Shrine Bowl and would replace a disappointing Clinton Hart.\n\n124. Philadelphia Eagles (via New York Jets): Dan LaFevour QB, Central Mich.\n\nVick will probably not be back, and they may decide to part ways with McNabb so Kevin Kolb would be the only QB on the roster.\n\n125. Minnesota Vikings: Jay Ross, DT East Carolina\n\nPat Williams is 37 years old and may retire this offseason.\n\n126. New Orleans Saints: Trindon Holliday WR/RB, LSU\n\nThey will probably cut Reggie Bush to save the 8 million he’s due. Holliday is a RB/WR tweener as well as a homer that would work much the same way Reggie did."
