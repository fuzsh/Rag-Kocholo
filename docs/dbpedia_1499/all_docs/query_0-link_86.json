Slocum being a possible defensive coordinator candidate.\n\nRemember, the guy is responsible for the 91' \"Wrecking Crew\" defense:\n\nThe Wrecking Crew defense finished the season ranked No. 1 by the NCAA in total defense (222.4 yards per game) and in passing defense (136.4 yards per game). The defense finished No. 7 nationally in points allowed (13.1) and in No. 4 in rushing defense (86.0).\n\nSome of the records set by the Â’91 defense that still stand are:\n\nMost sacks in a season (56)\n\nMost sack yardage in a season (388 yards)\n\nMost average sacks per game (5.1)\n\nFewest completions allowed in game (0 vs. Arkansas)\n\nhttp://www.aggieathletics.com/pressRelease.php?PRID=10201\n\nThoughts?\n\nTEXANS84 said:\n\nHeard on this morning while listening to Sports Radio 610 about the possiblilty of R.C.

I think RC is the main reason the Aggies have more players in the NFL than Texas. He coaches his players to prepare them for the NFL. The last few years, he just didn't recruit enough talent to get the job done.\n\nKaiser Toro said:\n\nAll I know about RC is that he is an class guy that had some great defenses in college. I do not know anything about his defensive philosophy.\n\nAll I can say is that I hope this does not incite any wrecking crew chants. It is arguably the lamest chant and hand symbol I have ever seen.\n\nHe ran the 3-4 at A&M.\n\nDo you always have to throw something negative in every post you make??? Of course, I am an Ag, but if you are an opposing team that gets stuffed by the D, and the crowd starts chanting this so loud you can't hear yourself think...\n\nI like it.

I asked why you had to throw something negative in every post you make. I know this is not fact (not EVERY post), but you do it so often, it seems that way.\n\nI heard the same comment on the radio on my drive into work this morning. I don't know much about RC, but I believe we are putting together a great staff of coaches. I am optomistic about this upcoming year and down the road from that even. I know this might be far fetched, but I get the feeling that this staff will eventually be a talented staff and one that people are going to look at down the road just as they look at previous \"dream team\" coaching staffs that Gruden, Holmgren, Shanahan, and others sprouted off of. Old 49er staffs and such.\n\nJack Bauer said:\n\nWhere in my post did I say you were negative about the speculation on the subject?

My posts are are nothing more than to foster debate, entertainment value (most often for myself), my own unfounded takes as a fan and to play devil's advocate in order for me to gather as much information on both sides to form an opinion.\n\nYou can easily put me on your ignore list if you do not see the value or do not like the volume in my posts.\n\nKaiser Toro said:\n\nNegativity is your perception.

I value your opinions and would not put you on ignore.

We don't want A&M filing a lawsuit against us.\n\nI know alot about Slocum he was the one who recruited me. He is a class guy and task master. He does not take any crap and he expects you to give your best on every play whether walk through or game or just film session. Possibly the greatest coach I ever had. He runs an attacking 3-4 defense similar to Pittsburgh's blitz packages, but does some Patriot style coverages. Mainly press man, but some slide zones and shades to help out the safties. Corners are expected to blitz often and He stresses and I do mean stresses angles when attacking. \"a good angle can make the most athletic seem like a F-ing practice squadder\" I got this yelled at me many a time. I dont think he will become our DC, but it would be great if he was brought in to coach LBs or as a consultant to the HC on Defense.\n\ncadahnic said:\n\nI know alot about Slocum he was the one who recruited me.

(Coming from an Ag!) Of course, I do have to comment that under trademark law, TAMU is required to defend its trademark.\n\nRome was saying the other day that he doesn't think the Ags have a case because the Seattle fans aren't mounting each other and sticking their tongues down each others throats after TDs. Sorry to Ags but the way it was said was funny.\n\nComing form a Tech grad, who grew up in a UT family (don't ask how it happened) I'd have no issues with RC being the DC or even a coach/consultant. He has produced some great D and put a bunch of players into teh NFL. RC knows talent, espically defensive talent.\n\nThe only downside would be it wouldmena that we are most likely sticking with teh 3-4, and after four years of it I'm not so high on it anymore (unless we got somebody from Pitts D to run it, like say their D line caoch.)\n\nTexanBacker93 said:\n\nWe don't want to have anything to do with the name wrecking crew. We don't want A&M filing a lawsuit against us.\n\nHA HA.\n\nIt would be nice to have a guy who knows the purpose of a Defense, you know, tackle, coverage, not letting the other team score. Basicss.\n\nNow before I get to excitecd, was it speculation, rumor, a source close to reported? Or were they just throwing names out?\n\nIt'd be good to see Slocum here.\n\nI was wondering about Ray Rhodes, defensive coordinator at Seattle. This Texan was defensive backs coach at San Fran the same time that Shanahan was there; he even coached with him in Denver. He runs a 4-3. He has a habit of making bad defenses good, and since his team is in the Superbowl, everybody has to stay hush-hush. Just connecting some dots. I don't have anything tangible.\n\nAnybody know his contract status at Seattle?\n\nSome sites about Rhodes if you want to check it out:\n\nhttp://www.superbowl.com/news/story/9173530\n\nhttp://www.thenewstribune.com/sports/seahawks/archive/story/5437270p-3568969c.html\n\noso said:\n\nIt'd be good to see Slocum here.\n\nI was wondering about Ray Rhodes, defensive coordinator at Seattle.

Kubiak was a quarterbacks coach with Texas A&M. Sherman was the offensive line coach at Texas A&M. See a pattern emerging here?\n\nkubiak and sherman have both been coaches the last 3 years. Where has Slocum been? I wouldn't mind him coming in and maybe coaching LB's but not as the DC for an NFL team. just my\n\nNot to rain on anybody's parade, but for some reason I thought we wanted to go to and maybe win a Super Bowl. Why would re-assembling the aggy dreamcast from a couple decades back give you confidence we are heading in the right direction?\n\nI want to see a NFL guy. Not a college guy with success (Chizik) or an old has-been college guy (RC) but a real f'n NFL guy. RC's been out of the game for a long time. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I'd prefer somebody who has a good feel for what's going on in the league right now. Add to all of this that NOBODY has hired RC to be a college HC since he left A&M. Sorry, but I just am really less than impressed if this ends up being Kubiak's answer for turning around the defense.\n\ncadahnic said:\n\nI know alot about Slocum he was the one who recruited me.

The day this happens will be the day I officially turn in my Texans gear.\n\nThe Aggies apparently have some deal where they bend over with their hands on their knees and recite some chant. I'll never forget the time I was watching A&M play UH at the Dome and this 12 year old kid, who was there with his dad, was refusing to do it. The dad was really agitated about it finally the kid gave it. Very, very humorous.\n\nWe already have good, knowledgable fans who get loud when the defense is on the field. We do not need the aid of Aggie chants.\n\nSteelers LB Coach:\n\n\"Keith Butler enters his third year on the SteelersÂ’ coaching staff, joining the staff prior to the 2003 season.\n\nButler was named the SteelersÂ’ linebackers coach Jan. 28, 2003, after serving the previous four seasons in a similar capacity with the Cleveland Browns (1999-02).\n\nButler has been instrumental in the development of the SteelersÂ’ highly regarded linebacking corps. The unit includes two Pro Bowl playersÂ—All-Pro James Farrior (his first Pro Bowl) and Joey PorterÂ—as well as developing starters Clark Haggans and Larry Foote. Butler also helped groom one of the teamÂ’s defensive surprises James Harrison, an original rookie free agent with the Steelers in 2000 who re-signed with the team just before training camp in 2004 after a yearÂ’s absence.\n\nPrior to joining the BrownsÂ’ staff, Butler spent nine years coaching in the college ranks.\n\nHe began his coaching career at his alma mater, the University of Memphis, where he coached linebackers from 1990-97 and also coached defensive ends and special teams (1995-97). He served as defensive coordinator and linebackers coach at Arkansas State University in 1998.\n\nButler, 49, was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the second round of the 1978 NFL Draft and played linebacker for 10 seasons (1978-87) with Seattle. He served as a defensive captain for the team and started 132-of-146 games in his career and still ranks second on the clubÂ’s all-time tackles list with 813.\n\nA three-year starter at inside linebacker for Memphis, Butler led the school in tackles his junior and senior seasons. He finished his collegiate career with 384 tackles and seven interceptions. He was named a 1977 Associated Press All-American and played in the 1977 Senior Bowl and Blue-Gray All-Star Game.\n\nButler was born May 16, 1956 in Anniston, Ala. He and his wife Janet have three sonsÂ—Blake (22), Brandon (20) and Brett (18).\"\n\nThanks long baller. After reading that I would say that man deserves a shot. You are not born a D-coordinator and it seems he has payed his dues and has the experience. Just thinking about the way he has got his linebackers flying around makes me wonder if he could make Peek and Babbin into a legit pass rush.\n\nNot to mention he will also have a superbowl ring in a few days. And yes, that is what my magic 8-ball has told me.\n\nHoth-Boy said:\n\nComing form a Tech grad, who grew up in a UT family (don't ask how it happened) I'd have no issues with RC being the DC or even a coach/consultant.

The truth is that with one upgrade the defense can go from last to at least average. All we need is a serious upgrade at NT and you will see the unit improve immensely. Without a NT that can dominate the 1 and 2 gaps, the 3-4 defense crumbles. Seth Payne is pretty good pass rushing from his position, but against the run he just doesn't cut it. Because we have so much personel invested in the 3-4 I still say the dream draft is something like...\n\n1) Reggie Bush, RB USC\n\n2) Gabe Watson, NT Michigan\n\n3a) Greg Eslinger, C Minnesota\n\n3b) Jason Allen, FS Tennessee\n\n4) Johnathan Joseph, CB South Carolina\n\n5) Lawrence Vickers, FB Colorado\n\n6) Joe Toledo, OT Washington\n\n7) Brando Twito, TE/OL Pittsburg State\n\nApoch said:\n\nThe truth is that with one upgrade the defense can go from last to at least average.

The difference when Payne is out of the game (and not a positive one) has been one of the more noticeable changes on the D to date. And Gabe Watson who has underwhelmed in college is the answer--hmmm. Not saying he is a bad pick in the 2nd, but if the Texans stuck with a 3-4 next year (unlikely it appears) Watson would be a filler next year (and possibly the year after), rather than an upgrade, just as TJ was last year."
