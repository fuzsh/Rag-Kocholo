        "text": "Provides depth behind O'Brien Schofield. His 46 tackles and three sacks last season are respectable for a backup, but provide no real fantasy value.\n\nHaggans' decline in performance in 2010 may have pushed him out of immediate IDP consideration as he averaged just four tackles per game. He'll be pushed by second-year player Will Davis, but with Davis coming off a foot injury, Haggans may have a leg up on the job.\n\nHaggans earned a starting job during the preseason in 2009 and went on to have one of the best seasons of his career with 74 tackles including five sacks. He'll remain in the same outside linebacker spot to begin 2010, but at 33, it's unlikely he'll ever match the sack totals from his peak in Pittsburgh a few seasons ago.\n\nHaggans is penciled into a starting role heading into training camp, however, he figures to engage in a platoon. He is one of four players (Chike Okeafor, Bertrand Berry and Cody Brown are the others) that should receive significant playing time at Arizonaâ€™s two defensive end/outside linebacker positions. Haggans seems better suited for a true linebacker position, as opposed to the hybrid rush end role that the Cardinals employ. He will probably yield to Berry on passing downs, which should limit his sack opportunities.\n\nHaggans could win a starting role with a good summer, but he opens training camp on the wrong side of the bubble. He is 31 years old and his sack totals have been on the decline, from nine in 2005 to six in 2006 to four in 2007. He's a mediocre tackler, so there's not a ton of upside here.\n\nThe eighth-year veteran outside linebacker finished second on the team in sacks in 2006 with seven. He should contend for the team-lead in sacks again in 2007.\n\nHaggans, 29, recorded a career-high nine sacks in 2005. He also finished with 59 total tackles (40/19) and four forced fumbles despite missing three games with injuries. He's in line for similar production in 2006.\n\nThe six-year NFL veteran could have a breakout year, especially with the questionable health of Joey Porter. Pittsburgh's defensive system is set up for its linebackers to produce, and Haggans had six sacks in just 13 games last year. He also forced two fumbles, recovering one of them."
