        "text": "I would like to set the record straight as to\n\nthe reason for me spending time in Westmorland County\n\njail. On April 21st of 2011, I was at a concert with my\n\nwife when I got a call from our babysitter that our 5 year\n\nold daughter was having trouble breathing. She has been\n\non medicine and inhalers since she was born because of her\n\nunder developed lungs. The sitter was panicked. I had\n\nbeen drinking and my wife was planning on driving home\n\nfrom the concert. But my wife was wandering around when I\n\ngot the call, and I couldn’t find her. I tried calling\n\nher within the concert, but had no luck getting a hold of\n\nher. I needed to get home to my daughter immediately. I\n\nfelt that my only choice was to drive home. While driving\n\nhome, I sped and ran a red light, so I was pulled over.\n\nI, along with the officers, proceeded to my house and\n\nadministered the treatment and my daughter responded.\n\nIn spite of the circumstances, I was issued a citation for\n\ntwo moving violations and suspicion of driving under the\n\ninfluence. As part of my agreement with the District\n\nAttorney’s office, I have to spend 48 hours, plus seven\n\nadditional nights in jail, to make restitution for my\n\nchoices. In hindsight, I should have found another way\n\nhome, and I take full responsibility for my actions.\n\nIf you have any additional questions, please contact my\n\nagent, Jeff Sperbeck at jeff@thenovoagency.com.\n\nSincerely,\n\nClark Haggans"
