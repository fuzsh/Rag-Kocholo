        "text": "Wilson’s “hidden figure,” Christine Barnes Richie, passed peacefully late last month and was funeralized yesterday in Newport News, Virginia.\n\n“Christine B. Richie was a loving and devoted wife, mother, grandmother, sister, cousin, aunt, church member, and friend. On January 26, 1932, she began her earthly journey as the second of six daughters born to McKinley Barnes and Hagar Hagans Barnes. Christine B. Richie, or “Babe” as she was affectionally called by family and friends was educated in the public schools of Wilson County North Carolina. She attended Barnes Elementary-Middle School, and in 1950 she graduated from Frederick Douglas High School in Elm City North Carolina as the valedictorian of her class. Christine was a dedicated and hardworking student. She was always working to get 100% and was never satisfied with 99.5%. Christine continued her education graduating with honors from North Carolina Central University in Durham with a Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics and Science.\n\n“Christine B. Richie started her professional career after graduating from North Carolina Central University and moving to Newport News, Virginia, where she was hired as a math teacher at Huntington High School. She worked there for only one year before learning that NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) was looking for mathematicians. She applied and took the qualifying exam and was hired as one of the “Human Computers” working in the West Wing section of Langley Field. A few years later NACA became NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) as a result of the Space Act. Christine B. Richie continued working at NASA as a mathematician for thirty-two years before she retired in 1987.\n\n“While working at NASA Christine co-authored and contributed to several research projects including the Application of phase-change technique to thin sections with heating on both surfaces (National Aeronautics and Space Administration; 1973), the Fail-safe system for actively cooled supersonic and hypersonic aircraft (National Aeronautics and Space Administration;1975), the Aerodynamic characteristics at Mach 6 of a hypersonic research airplane concept having a 70 ̊ swept delta wing (National Aeronautics and Space Administration; 1977), and in 2017 Christine B. Richie received the group achievement award from NASA for being one of the “Human Computers” depicted in the movie Hidden Figures, who helped put the first man on the moon.\n\n“Christine was not only an accomplished mathematician, but she was a faithful member of Trinity Baptist church for more than 60 years. As a faithful member she served as the treasurer for the Women’s Club. She was also a “Life Time Member” of the Missionary Society, and was a recipient of the Trinity Baptist Church Rosa Parks Award. After retirement, Christine served her community delivering meals on wheels for 25 years. She was a quiet humble person whose Christian faith was lived out in the loving way she patiently sacrificed her time, talents and treasure for her family, friends, and those who were dear to her.\n\n“Christine B. Richie was preceded in death by one sister, Emma Dean Barnes; her loving husband, Walter E. Richie Sr.; her son, Walter E. Richie Jr.; and son-in- law, Timothy A. Chandler Jr. She leaves behind 1 daughter, Rev. Dr. Faye Richie-Chandler; 2 grandchildren, Timothy A. Chandler III and Morgan Faye Chandler; 1 granddaughter-in-law, Lorion Chandler; 2 great grandchildren, Rielyn Chandler and Reign Timara Faye Chandler; 4 sisters, Catherine B. Slade, Ruby B. Spoons, Romaine B. Harris, and Mavis B. Harris; 3 first cousins, Verona B. True, Jeraldene B. Massey and Alice B. Freeman; nieces and nephews, Julia S. McCullough, Theresa S. Moore, Katherine Slade, James Slade, Solita Spoons, Sybil Spoons, Sanchia Spoons, Joydana Harris, Willie Harris, Monica Harris, Rev. Dr. Willis T. Richie Jr., Gloria Boston, Harry C. Richie Jr., Willistine Betts, Georgene Thweatt, Bishop Carroll Richie, Randolph Richie and a host of great nieces, great nephews and cousins. All will remember and cherish the memory of Christine B. Richie for the sweetness of her character. She was truly a “Babe,” and her life speaks for itself; a job well done.\n\n“A Celebration of Life Service will be held at 11 a.m., Saturday, January 6, 2023, at Trinity Baptist Church, Newport News. Viewing will be from 3-6 p.m., Friday, January 5, 2023, at the funeral home. O. H. Smith & Son Funeral Home is honored to serve the family.”\n\nMy thanks to Leroy Barnes for alerting me to Mrs. Richie’s passing.\n\nI was honored to be asked to speak at the Freeman-Hagans reunion last night — the first family reunion I’ve addressed beyond my own. The family is fortunate to have richly documented genealogical knowledge, so I knew I couldn’t just show up and tell the Freemans about the Freemans. As I considered topics, I remembered a passage in Mary Freeman-Ellis’ fantastic The Way It Was in which she vividly described attending services at London’s Primitive Baptist Church. As genealogy is brought to life, so to speak, by an understanding of the contexts of our ancestors’ lives, I decided to talk about the history of the church that was so central to the lives of Eliza Daniels Freeman and several of her children. My thanks to Patricia Freeman for the invitation; to the Lillian Freeman Barbee family for sharing their table with me; and to all who welcomed me so warmly.\n\nLondon Church twelve years after it was moved from its original location on Herring Avenue. A hoped-for benefactor had not materialized, and the building was beginning to break down. Wilson Daily Times, 31 March 2004.\n\nHere’s the inspirational excerpt from Mary Freeman-Ellis’ memoir:\n\n“… Aunt Lydia [Freeman Norwood Ricks], Uncle Lovette [Freeman], and Julius [F. Freeman Jr.] were members. Once a year, usually early spring, the church had its annual meeting. People came from near and far. A great deal of time was spent inside the church during the service. This was the annual ‘Big August Meeting,’ I used to hear Aunt Lydia say, lots of preparation occurred during the year to cleanse the heart, soul and the mind in order to be able to receive communion. The church grounds, as they were called, were set up with long wooden tables with benches to sit on. Each table was covered with a sheet then a white table cloth.\n\n“I had never seen so much food any place before. There was fried chicken, roast beef, roast pork, potato salad, slaw and several tin tubs with iced cold lemonade. There were also several kinds of pies and cakes. This was the first time I had ever seen anybody eat only cake and fried chicken together. We tried it and it was good. People ate, greeted each other with big hugs and the preacher did his share of hugging the sisters. London Baptist Church was a primitive church; I never understood that term.\n\n“Although the fellowship of the church grounds was a vital part of this Big August Meeting, what transpired inside was the thing that had us traumatized. For example, the services started with the pastor greeting the congregation. The membership was made up of all blacks and the women far outnumbered the men. The service continued with a long prayer, going into a song led by the pastor. There was no organ or piano. Most of the songs appeared to have anywhere from five to eight verses. I was familiar with the hymn, Amazing Grace, but had never heard it sung the way the Primitive Baptists sang it. The preacher would read off two lines as follows: ‘Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound. It saved a wreck [sic] like me.’ The congregation would follow with these same two lines. The pastor would continue with, ‘I once was lost, but now I’m found, was blind, but now I see.’ This was called ‘lining a hymn.’ The preacher took his text from the Prodigal Son. He had him going places and doing things I had never heard of before. Since we were children, we knew to keep quiet because this was a house of worship and it was good manners to sit quietly. We had also begged Aunt Lydia to take us and we did not want her to know how disappointed we were. There was very little going on for children other than eating when the time came.\n\n“We could not get home fast enough to tell Mother and Dad about our experience, especially how hard those wooden benches were. I wanted the center of attention so I began relating each thing as it happened. Dad momentarily looked up at me for a moment with a sheepish grin on his face. He said, ‘You know you were not forced to go.'”\n\nThe one hundred-fifty-sixth in a series of posts highlighting buildings in East Wilson Historic District, a national historic district located in Wilson, North Carolina. As originally approved, the district encompasses 858 contributing buildings and two contributing structures in a historically African-American section of Wilson.
