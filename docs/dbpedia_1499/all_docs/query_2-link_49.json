Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega) is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure and indeed a personal honor for me to share with my colleagues and the American people that for myself as a Polynesian of Samoan ancestry and as a Member of the United States Congress, to congratulate, to recognize and to commend seven sons of the Asian-Pacific American community who will be playing in Super Bowl XL this coming Sunday, at Detroit, Michigan. These seven players are Lofa Tatupu, Itula Mili, and Wayne Hunter of the Seattle Seahawks, and Troy Polamalu, Shaun Nua, Chris Kemoeatu, and Kimo van Oelhoffen of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Among the seven Polynesian players in this Sunday's Super Bowl game, Kimo von Oelhoffen is Native Hawaiian, Chris Kemoeatu is Tongan, and Lofa Tatupu, Itula Mili, Wayne Hunter, Shaun Nua, and Troy Polamalu are all Samoans. Mr. Speaker, this is a monumental achievement in the history of our Polynesian people in this great country of ours. These young men exemplify for me a journey of our people, particularly those of us who come to this country from humble beginnings as people of small island nations, with nothing but our values, our culture and our great fear of God to navigate the great highways of our Nation. Today, Mr. Speaker, I am especially proud of these young men, give tremendous credit to their parents and extended families. It is a pride that comes from a deep understanding that great feats are accomplished through a dedication to basic hard work, perseverance, determination, and a lot of patience. Each of these young men have had to overcome great obstacles to be where he is today. Such a feat reminds me of the wisdom of one of my great heroes, the nonviolent leader, Mahatma Gandhi, whose insight into the human spirit sums up quite frankly what I believe to be a fundamental truth. Mahatma Gandhi says strength does not come from physical capacity; it comes from the indomitable will. Lofa Tatupu, Itula Mili, Wayne Hunter, Troy Polamalu, Shaun Nua, Chris Kemoeatu, and Kimo von Oelhoffen epitomize the indomitable will of our Polynesian people, which in my opinion is another clear manifestation of the greatness of our Nation, to allow its citizens whose roots are from just about every part of the world to be all you can be if given the opportunity. And in this instance, seven Polynesians have stepped to the plate to share their God-given talent of playing the sport of football in the National Football League. Of the 300 million Americans today, only 30,000 are Tongan Americans, and about 200,000 are Samoans living in my district and in the Continental United States, and approximately 400,000 Native Hawaiians nationwide. From these meager statistics, Mr. Speaker, the presence of these seven Polynesian men in the Super Bowl this Sunday should remind us all as Americans that the values upon which this country was founded are still alive; that pure hard work, commitment, determination, and perseverance continue to be rewarded. Mr. Speaker, let me give you a brief summary of each of those players' achievements. Of the seven players, Itula Mili and Chris Kemoeatu are graduates of my alma mater, Kahuku High School in the State of Hawaii. As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, of the 24 Samoans that currently play in the National Football League, five are graduates of Kahuku High School of Hawaii, and five are graduates of high schools of my little territory of American Samoa. Itula Mili wears jersey No. 88 and plays for the Seattle Seahawks. Wayne Hunter wears jersey No. 73 and plays for the Seattle Seahawks. Lofa Tatupu wears the jersey of 51 and plays for the Seattle Seahawks. Lofa is the son of the former NFL great fullback and special teams great and my dear friend, Mosi Tatupu, both alumni of the University of Southern California Trojans. Wearing No. 43 with the Pittsburgh Steelers is Troy Polamalu. Polamalu has developed into one of the NFL's top safeties and was one of the six Steelers selected to the 2005 Pro Bowl. He has been selected to the 2006 Pro Bowl team. He was named to the Associated Press second team all pro squad as a ferocious hitter with excellent speed. Twenty-four-year-old No. 96, Shaun Nua, plays for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Born in American Samoa, he attended a local high school. He is known as an athletic defensive lineman. Chris Kemoeatu wears jersey No. 68 for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Kahuku high School graduate, All American University of Utah. Komo von Oelhoffen wears No. 67 for the Pittsburgh Steelers. He hails from Kaunakakai, Hawaii, a graduate of Molokai High School. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Asian-Pacific American community living in this great Nation of ours, once more, it is with pride that I share with my colleagues and indeed with all of my fellow Americans the accomplishments of our Polynesian young men in the field of sports, specifically football. Mr. Speaker, again I want to say fa`afetai tele, mahalo nui loa, and malo e lelei, which means ``thank you'' in Samoan, Hawaiian, and the Tongan languages. Mr. Speaker, I will insert for the Record at this point articles on these players. [From Sports Illustrated, Nov. 14, 2005] The Young and Relentless Versatile, hard-hitting and oozing confidence, the next generation of defensive stars is disrupting game plans and creating a new blueprint for building winners (By Peter King) Something hard to quantify hit the NFL in the first half of the season. Not quite a trend, but more than a feeling: Young defensive players--rookies, second- and third-year players-- are making a bigger impact than, well, maybe ever. The Colts are 8-0 and on track for the Super Bowl using seven key defensive players who are 25 or younger; Colts defensive end Robert Mathis, 24, is tied for the NFL sack lead with eight, while linebacker Cato June, 25, is second in the league with five interceptions. The Jets followed middle linebacker Jonathan Vilma's young leadership to the playoffs last year, and now two contenders--Cincinnati (with Odell Thurman) and Seattle (Lofa Tatupu)--have rookie middle 'backers calling defensive signals. In Chicago safety Mike Brown, 27, is the old man of a rock-solid secondary for the NFC North-leading Bears. None of his fellow starters (cornerbacks Charles Tillman and Nathan Vasher and rookie safety Chris Harris) has turned 25 yet. Five rookies are playing in Cowboys defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer's rotation, helping Dallas contend in the resurgent NFC East. The most accomplished of the young bunch, and certainly the most recognizable, may be Steelers safety Troy Polamalu (page 44), who in just three seasons has become a force in the league, ranging all over the field, hair flowing as he delivers game-changing plays. ``I see it every week, right in front of me,'' says Chiefs defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham. ``The league is changing. First-day draft picks are coming in and making an impact early on defense.'' ``If you're good, you're good,'' says Tillman, 24, an intelligent third-year player who has started since October of his rookie year. ``LeBron James was--what?--18 when he came into the NBA. Michelle Wie's playing with the best at 16. No one said, `Oh, she's too young.' Football's not old school anymore, where you sit till you're a senior in college, then get to play, then sit for two or three years before you get your chance in the NFL. When I came to camp as a rookie, it was all about who was the best guy.'' The philosophy of building a defense with star free agents and supplementing them with meat and potatoes in the draft began to [[Page 652]] wane in the late '90s, after several high-profile mistakes. In 1998 Jacksonville gave linebacker Bryce Paup a five-year, $21.8-million deal, and he gave the Jags 7\\1/2\\ sacks in two years before being cut. That same year cornerback Doug Evans (Carolina), defensive end Gabe Wilkins (San Francisco) and defensive tackle Dana Stubblefield (Washington) signed for a combined $79 million; they made zero Pro Bowls for those teams. In '99 Dale Carter signed a six-year, $38 million deal and gave Denver one lousy season on the field and a second in which he was suspended for substance abuse. ``Money can make fools of all of us,'' says Chargers coach Marty Schottenheimer. ``There've been some lessons learned from free agency. And I've changed a little bit when it comes to the draft. I used to say draft a guy and let him sit till he learns it, maybe two or three years. Now, the last five or six years, they've got to produce in year two and three.'' The first five picks in last April's draft were offensive players, but 34 of the next 59 were defenders. And there's no question that the bigger impact has been made by the defensive rookies, led by Thurman, San Diego's Luis Castillo and Shawne Merriman, and Dallas's Demarcus Ware--any of whom could make the Pro Bowl this season. Says Tennessee director of pro scouting Al Smith, a 10-year NFL linebacker who retired in 1997, ``On our side of the business we're seeing it's better to draft a good prospect and develop him rather than spending $10 or $15 million on a signing bonus in free agency and getting burned. With guys like Merriman and Ware, you basically tell them, `Get to the quarterback and don't jump offside.''' ____ [From the Washington Post, Feb. 1, 2006] Everybody's in a Big Hurry Steelers' Blitzes Make Protecting the Quarterback a Problem (By Leonard Shapiro) Detroit, Jan. 31.--It's the kind of image that can keep an offensive lineman tossing and turning at night. Over the last week or so, Robbie Tobeck, Seattle's 12th- year center, and his teammates on the line have studied videotape of the Pittsburgh Steelers' defense, particularly the constant and often devastating blitzes that can come at any time, from any place on the field. ``You know they're going to be extremely physical,'' Tobeck said. ``What you see is when they've been successful, they've basically gotten people into a panic. That's something we can't allow to happen. We've got to relax, take our time and make the adjustments to prevent something like that.'' The Steelers have been a blitzing team ever since Bill Cowher showed up as their coach 14 years ago. One of the original architects of the Steelers' zone blitz schemes was Dick LeBeau, who played 14 years at cornerback in the NFL and spent I six years as an assistant coach with the Steelers in the mid-1990s. He returned as the team's defensive coordinator in 2004, and his handiwork has been evident in Pittsburgh's run to Super Bowl XL. No team in the NFL blitzed more than the Steelers in 2005, using the tactic on a league-high 287 pass attempts during the regular season. The blitz was primarily responsible for eliminating the top-seeded Indianapolis Colts in the second round of the AFC playoffs in a game in which quarterback Peyton Manning spent more time on his back than standing upright. Manning was so undone he complained afterward that his teammates simply couldn't protect him. There was more of the same 10 days ago in the AFC title game, when the Steelers forced Broncos quarterback Jake Plummer into four turnovers--two interceptions and two fumbles under a particularly heavy rush--in Pittsburgh's upset at Denver's Invesco Field. In all three playoff victories, the Steelers stuffed their opponent's running game, made offenses become one-dimensional and took early leads, allowing their defense even more latitude to create mayhem--and perhaps a little panic, as well. ``First of all, they have great athletes,'' Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren said Tuesday. ``They have the kind of players who can execute what they ask them to do. You have to have the right people to run the schemes. In Pittsburgh's case, when they blitz the linebacker, that linebacker is really good at blitzing. We've all seen teams that blitz and the blitzer runs right into the blocker. It's an awesome collision, but he never gets home. Their players are physical, but they also have enough wiggle and speed to make it very, very difficult.'' The Steelers operate out of a 3-4 alignment--three down linemen and four linebackers. The front three linemen--end Aaron Smith (298 pounds), nose tackle Casey Hampton (325) and end Kimo von Oelhoffen (299)--provide a major push toward the quarterback, sometimes occupying two offensive linemen on one defensive lineman, creating openings for linebackers and defensive backs to rush the quarterback. The zone blitz also often drops a defensive lineman into the pass-coverage lanes and almost always includes one safety playing in a deep zone. If a linebacker blitzes, one of his teammates will simply play a zone to cover an area, as opposed to a specific receiver. Fifteen players had at least one sack this season for the Steelers, who were tied for third in the league with 47, including nine by safeties and cornerbacks. Linebacker Joey Porter led the Steelers with 10 1/2 sacks, and fellow linebacker Clark Haggans, Porter's former Colorado State teammate, had nine. Strong safety Troy Polamalu, with the long hair he described Tuesday as ``my fifth appendage,'' has emerged as arguably the Steelers'' most dangerous defender. He's a 5- foot-l0, 212-pound dynamo who lines up all over the field and has a knack for avoiding blocks and making huge hits--in opposing backfields and the secondary if he stays in pass coverage. ``This kid Polamalu is the best football player I've ever seen,'' Denver defensive lineman Trevor Pryce said before the Steelers faced the Broncos in the AFC championship game. ``There's something very strange about him that I can't put a finger on. They call him `ninja' because he just pops out of nowhere and pops you. He's reckless. He does not care. He has an advantage being 5-10. When you're short and strong, you have an advantage because those 6-5 offensive linemen can't get a hold of anything to block.'' During the regular season, Polamalu tied for fourth on the team in total tackles with 91, was second in interceptions (two) and added three sacks and three fumble recoveries. He has been just as impressive in the playoffs. ``I don't know if he's changing [the way defense is played], but he is a very unique player at his position,'' Cowher said. ``He combines the athletic ability to cover, the explosion to be a great blitzer. He's also an outstanding tackler, and on top of that he's a very instinctive player.'' He also studies more than most. After the 2004 season, Polamalu watched more than 20 hours of tape of the NFL's top safeties, including his role model, New England safety Rodney Harrison, as well as Denver's John Lynch and Dallas's Roy Williams. Last year at the Pro Bowl, Polamalu played on the AFC team with Lynch and sought some one-on-one tutoring. ``Early in the week, he came up to me and said, `Any way I could pick your brain and if you don't mind spend some time with you?''' Lynch told the Rocky Mountain News. ``I respect that out of young players. The guy is committed to the game of football and obviously is a tremendous talent. He makes their defense go.'' And blitz. But it isn't enough to merely blitz. A team must disguise its blitzing packages, and Polamalu is particularly adept at coming up to the line of scrimmage as if planning to rush the passer, then wheeling and turning his back on the offense as if to go back into coverage. Then he does another whirl at the snap of the ball and heads back toward the quarterback. Porter also earned a trip to the Pro Bowl this year with his own disruptive tactics, and will try to do the same this week against Seattle quarterback Matt Hasselbeck. ``I have to do something to make Hasselbeck feel not so comfortable in the pocket,'' Porter said. ``I have to do something to make him run and get outside the pocket. I like my opportunity with me and Kimo over there, the way we've been playing. It's going to make for a good matchup. ``When we take the run away from teams, we're also playing to our strength, making them one-dimensional. When we make teams one-dimensional, I always like our chances.'' ____ [From Sports Illustrated, Jan. 30, 2006] Shock Value After playing the Panthers low, hard-hitting rookie linebacker Lofa Tatupu may be the man who brings the Seahawks their first Super Bowl trophy (By Michael Silver) The commotion had unnerved him, and Lofa Tatupu, the Seattle Seahawks' rookie middle linebacker, was bent on restoring order. ``Shut up, Bailey!'' Tatupu yelled, momentarily interrupting the incessant barking of the 15- pound fox terrier running around his Kirkland, Wash., town house last Friday night. Then, in an instant, Tatupu's angry stare turned sheepish. That's because Bailey, who belongs to Tatupu's girlfriend, Rachael Marcott, has grown on the Seahawks' leading tackler. ``Come here, Bailey,'' he said, extending his right fist. ``Give me some dap.'' Balancing on his hind legs, Bailey dutifully lifted his left paw and hit Tatupu's fist. ``That's my dog,'' Tatupu said, beaming. At the sight of a little pooch turning the 23- year-old former USC star into a softie, you had to wonder: Does this 5'11'', 226-pound linebacker sip soy lattes? Does Lofa use a loofah? Two days later, to the delight of a Seattle fan base hoping to shed more than a quarter century's worth of postseason disappointment, Tatupu affirmed his machismo with a bang in the NFC Championship Game at Qwest Field. Deciphering the Carolina Panthers' offense like a savvy veteran, Tatupu quickly set the tone for the Seahawks' 34-14 victory. With 5:07 left in the first quarter, he stepped in front of All- Pro wideout Steve [[Page 653]] Smith to make an interception that led to a field goal. Little more than three minutes later, with Seattle on top 10- 0, Tatupu correctly read a sweep around right end and closed hard on Carolina running back Nick Goings. Their headon collision was as charged as a Pearl Jam gig at the nearby Crocodile Cafe, and both players slumped to the ground. ``I wasn't sure who had won that one,'' Seattle defensive end Bryce Fisher said later. ``But their guy left the game, and ours shook off the cobwebs and kept playing. That was huge, because Lofa's our leader.'' That a would-be college senior could help lead the Seahawks to their first Super Bowl spoke to the strangeness of a season few envisioned back last April, when Seattle drafted Tatupu in the second round and essentially allowed him to take charge of the defense. On Sunday, with the help of smelling salts and the urgings of 67,837 fans, Tatupu played three-plus quarters with what was later diagnosed as a mild concussion and helped the Seahawks complete a declawing of the Panthers that reverberated from Grungeville all the way to Motown. When the Seahawks (15-3) face the Pittsburgh Steelers (14- 5) in Super Bowl XL on Feb. 5 in Detroit, the latest version of the Steel Curtain won't be the only defense at Ford Field capable of controlling the game. ``We come hard, and we're fighters,'' Tatupu said of a unit that limited Carolina to 109 total yards through three quarters and didn't allow the offense to score until 5:09 remained. If the Panthers (13-6), fresh off impressive road playoff victories over the New York Giants and the Chicago Bears, didn't see it coming, Don Hasselbeck did--more than a decade ago. Back then Hasselbeck, a former NFL tight end, was coaching the Norfolk (Mass.) Vikings in a Pop Warner league the same time his former New England Patriots teammate, fullback Mosi Tatupu (Lofa's father), was coaching the King Philip Warriors. ``My son Nathaniel was our quarterback, and Lofa, at 12, was all over him,'' Don recalled while standing in the Seahawks' locker room on Sunday night. ``I had to run double reverses just to give us a chance.'' A few feet away Nathaniel's big brother, Matt, the Seahawks' quarterback, nodded in agreement. Matt had just demoralized the Carolina defense with his typically heady and efficient play--20 of 28 passing for 219 yards and two touchdowns--while league MVP Shaun Alexander had carried 34 times for 132 yards and a pair of TDs. Keying Seattle's attack, as always, was the NFL's preeminent offensive line, a group that Hasselbeck's former backup, Cleveland Browns quarterback Trent Dilfer, affectionately calls ``the grumpy old men.'' As much as the well-acquainted linemen--all the starters except second-year right tackle Sean Locklear have been with the team for at least five seasons--like to carp at one another off the field, their unspoken understanding of how to adjust to defensive alignments is what defines this unit. ``If you're not making calls at the line, it confuses a defensive lineman,'' All-Pro left tackle Walter Jones said at lunch last Saturday at a Kirkland T.G.I. Friday's. ``At that point he can only guess what you're cooking up.'' The Seahawks' vastly improved chemistry this season was no accident. After last January's 27-20 wild-card playoff loss at home to the St. Louis Rams--extending the franchise's streak without a postseason victory to an NFL-worst 21 years--Seattle shook things up. Owner Paul Allen dismissed team president Bob Whitsitt, whose ongoing feud with coach Mike Holmgren escalated to the point that the two had stopped talking to each other. In Whitsitt's place, Allen hired Tim Ruskell, a former Tampa Bay Bucs and Atlanta Falcons executive. The front-office tension was eased, and Ruskell purged the roster of players perceived as selfish or divisive. Then he went after guys who, he says, ``loved playing football, played hard and had all the intangibles.'' That's what compelled him to trade up in the draft (with the Panthers, of all teams), for the 45th pick, and take Tatupu. At his first minicamp Tatupu showed the Seahawks they had gotten more than they'd bargained for. Recalls Fisher, ``He pretty much stepped in the huddle and told everyone, `Listen to me because I know what I'm doing.''' Tatupu started all 16 games, and as the season went on he became increasingly bold in practices--irking Holmgren by calling fake punts (Tatupu occasionally filled in as the up-back on the punt team) and switching pass coverages during two-minute drills. Yet against the Panthers he was a coach's dream, repeatedly identifying the plays Carolina was about to run and positioning his teammates accordingly. This was essential to Seattle's defensive game plan, which was designed to frustrate Smith with a variety of double coverages and required Seattle to stop the run with only seven men near the line of scrimmage. The plan worked beautifully. The only damage Smith (five catches, 33 yards) inflicted was a 59-yard punt return for a touchdown, and the Panthers' running backs gained all of 21 yards on nine carries. ``It's amazing that he can be that good in his first year,'' Carolina center Jeff Mitchell said of Tatupu after the game. ``He always seems to know where the ball is going.'' Added Fisher, ``Most offenses are designed to fool the linebackers. Lofa was out there calling exactly what they were doing, so they didn't have a whole lot of options.'' Sometimes Tatupu's signals weren't easy to hear, as the boisterous crowd celebrated a team it hopes can win Seattle's first major professional sports championship since the SuperSonics won the 1978-79 NBA title. ``This is the craziest crowd I've ever seen in this town,'' said a man who should know, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament, as he mingled on the field during the postgame trophy presentation. ``There's been sort of a gloomy mentality in Seattle--because of the weather [27 consecutive days of rain, a streak that ended on Jan. 15], because there've been so many heartbreaks--but this is an enormous boost for the fans.'' Tatupu was delirious, too, but in a different way. ``My head hurts, and everything is really foggy,'' he said softly as he walked slowly toward the players' parking lot less than an hour after the game. ``That play knocked me stupid, and I vaguely remember the rest of the game. Maybe it'll come back to me later. I'm just glad we won.'' Tatupu managed a slight smile. In half an hour he would be home, where a small dog was waiting to give him some well- earned dap. ____ [From the New York Times, Jan. 30, 2006] Pittsburgh Safety Could Lurk Anywhere Against Seattle (By Judy Battista) Detroit, Jan. 29.--In the days before the 2003 N.F.L. draft, the dissection of the college prospects was already at its hypercritical zenith. One defensive back from the University of Southern California, with his 4.3 speed in the 40-yard dash, his 43-inch vertical leap and football instincts honed from hours of studying film, looked like a can't-miss pick. That was especially so because of defenses that were increasingly demanding players who possessed the intelligence to decipher different offenses and the athleticism to destroy them in seconds. But in the search for the perfect specimen, for an android in cleats, the scouts and the seers had allowed doubt to drift in. Could this back, Troy Polamalu, play against the pass? Three seasons later, offenses face a more vexing question: What can't Polamalu do? The Pittsburgh Steelers shook off the doubts and traded up to select Polamalu with their first pick, the 16th over all. In the last two years--since Dick LeBeau's return as the Steelers' defensive coordinator--Polamalu has emerged as the defense's man for all seasons, a blitzer of uncommon speed on passing downs, a tackler of staggering strength against the run, and a moving part so itinerant that opposing offenses find themselves playing Where's Troy before they snap the ball. Polamalu is listed on the roster as a strong safety because he has to be given a position. But the versatility and the skill he brings to the Steelers' secondary make him difficult to categorize. He finished the regular season with 100 tackles, 11 passes batted down, 3 sacks, 2 interceptions and a forced fumble, according to the Steelers. ``He gives you unlimited flexibility,'' LeBeau said in a telephone interview from Pittsburgh last week. ``He can play the deep perimeter. He can play as a linebacker support player. He can blitz. For a defensive coordinator, he's ideal. You can put him anyplace.'' Or no place. LeBeau trusts Polamalu so much that he is rarely confined to one area of the field. Instead, LeBeau gives Polamalu boundaries for what his role is on a play, and Polamalu takes it from there. In one of his most dazzling moves, he will fake a blitz, jumping in and out of gaps on the defensive line like a rabbit, then pull back, whirl around so that he appears headed for the secondary, only to spin back as the ball is snapped to attack the line of scrimmage. If Colts quarterback Peyton Manning is known for his arm- flapping orchestration of audibles, real and imagined, then Polamalu and his whirling-dervish routine are the defensive equivalent, a thickly layered disguise designed to make offenses wait until the snap before they know where he is going. It is particularly devastating because quarterbacks are taught to read where the safety is to know what kind of coverage the defense is in. ``Troy improvises a lot of that stuff,'' LeBeau said, laughing. ``We give him parameters, and sometimes Troy may stretch those a bit.'' Just a bit. Polamalu has not lined up at nose tackle, but he has done everything else in the Steelers' blitz-happy 3-4 defense (three defensive linemen, four linebackers). On first down, he is usually at the line of scrimmage over the tight end to stop the run, said Kennedy Pola, the Jacksonville Jaguars' running backs coach, who is also Polamalu's uncle. On second down, Polamalu might be at the line of scrimmage again or he might drop back and play deep. The critical element at the line, LeBeau said, is to make sure Polamalu does not have to take on the guard and the center, who each might outweigh Polamalu--who is 5 feet 10 inches and 212 pounds--by 100 pounds or more. [[Page 654]] But it is on third down and other passing situations that Polamalu becomes Pittsburgh's wild card. He might be a blitzing linebacker, rushing up the middle, or he might line up as a pass-rushing end off the edge of the line, essentially turning the 3-4 defense into a 4-4. He has covered the slot receiver as the nickelback, or fifth linebacker, and played deep safety, although his weakness is perceived to be when he has to cover receivers in the open field. Still, Polamalu came close to intercepting Manning in the American Football Conference divisional game against Indianapolis when he dove for a pass while running free in the middle of the field. ``When you see a squat body with long hair, you don't think he can run that fast,'' Pola said. Big mistake. Steelers linebacker Joey Porter sacked Manning twice in three plays late in the fourth quarter because the Colts' offensive line thought Polamalu was coming up the middle. Against the Broncos in the A.F.C. title game, Polamalu tackled Denver running back Tatum Bell a yard short of a first down, while Polamalu was being blocked and was falling down. Later, Polamalu nearly tackled running back Mike Anderson for a safety on a screen pass on third-and-10--even though Polamalu was responsible for covering a deep pass in the seam. Those are the kinds of plays, LeBeau said, that caused him to run the film back asking, ``Did he do that?'' Polamalu's soft-spoke nature belies his fierce play, and Pola said that whenever they spoke, Polamalu talked only about how many of his other teammates should be going to the Pro Bowl with him. But those who have followed Polamalu's career know his instincts were apparent early. In one of his first scrimmages as a freshman at U.S.C., Polamalu burst into the backfield, tackled a senior running back, stripped him of the ball as he was knocking him down and took off the other way. ``Everyone was like, `Ohmigosh, this guy has no fear,''' U.S.C.'s linebackers coach, Rocky Seto, said. ``Most guys who rush the quarterback--from Lawrence Taylor to Reggie White-- they have a hunger and a desire to get there. He's not as big, but Troy certainly has that fire and tenacity.'' That tenacity is buttressed by his work habits. LeBeau said that Polamalu had watched more game film than anyone, and that after last season, Polamalu made a DVD of other N.F.L. safeties so he could study their techniques. Polamalu, in just his second full season in LeBeau's system, has learned to read an offense so well that LeBeau feels comfortable letting him follow his gut. That, LeBeau said, reminded him of how he used to feel about cornerback Rod Woodson and safety Carnell Lake, former Pro Bowl Steelers who also had the speed to play in the open field, the strength to play at the line of scrimmage and the sense to know where to go. ``I know Dick preaches it, you don't want a robot as a player and you don't want a cowboy either,'' said Woodson, who works for the NFL Network. ``You want a guy who plays within the system but who can play fast. He's a gambler. They're calculated risks. You study film and he believes in his eyes. For Troy, they've been his friend.'' The irony is that the gambler in Polamalu is what earned him a reputation before the 2003 draft as a player who ``flew up on everything,'' said Gil Brandt, who helped shape the Dallas Cowboys as the vice president for player personnel from 1960 to 1989 and who now writes for NFL.com. The concern was that Polamalu would leave his safety position to try to get closer to the ball and risk getting burned by a deep pass in the process. Is that so wrong? Not anymore. ``There's an old military axiom, `Reinforce strength''' LeBeau said. ``When you see a player who has a good feel for things, you try not to get in his way.
