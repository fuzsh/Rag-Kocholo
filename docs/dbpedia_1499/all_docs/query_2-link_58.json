        "text": "Despite other opinions that were made about the game Steelers deserve to win. Anyone who knows the game or played the game, know that in order to score a touchdown the entire ball has to do is cross the goal line. When Big Ben was in the air the ball was on the goal line and even though he was pushed back. In football, they call that forward progress and that's why the play wasn't over turned. Even if the refs miss a call or two, one call doesn't determine the out come of a football game. The Seattle Seahawks had just as many opportunities to win the game as Pittsburgh. The difference was that the Steelers were able to execute and the Seahawks didn't. You can also add to the fact that Detroit is only 300 miles from Pittsburgh and Seattle is 3000 miles, which made this somewhat a home game for Pittsburgh. The bottom line is that the Refs didn't loose this game for Seattle, the Seahawks loss this game by themselves and they have no one to blame but themselves."
