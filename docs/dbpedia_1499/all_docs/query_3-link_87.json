        "text": "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers are headed to Latrobe for the final month of training before they hit the preseason, trim their roster, and begin their 2023 campaign.\n\nTraining camp brings plenty of battles and some excitement surrounding a few lesser-known players on the 90-man roster. The Steelers always seem to find at least one diamond in the rough on their summer team, and this year, there are five players who appear ready to sneak their way onto the 53-man roster this season.\n\nAlfonzo Graham, RB\n\nAlfonzo Graham burst onto the scene by challenging Minkah Fitzpatrick to a one-on-one drill and getting, well, drilled by the veteran.\n\nHe learned quickly why All-Pros are special athletes, but you still have to respect a rookie not being afraid of a challenge. Since then, he's been a hot topic of conversation and has shown plenty of growth throughout OTAs and minicamp.\n\n\"That guy gets better every single day because he’s getting coached with detail and those things,” running backs coach Eddie Faulkner said. \"And so if we just continue to build on that, you might have something there.\"\n\nHe needs to beat out Anthony McFarland, Darius Hagans and Jason Huntley to make the team, but if he continues to grow, he could create enough buzz for the Steelers to believe in his potential.\n\nLuq Barcoo, CB\n\nThere weren't many days during OTAs and minicamp where Luq Barcoo wasn't making plays. He told All Steelers he had at least one pick six during practice and finished minicamp with a four pass deflection day.\n\nNow, he's looking to impress at training camp. Which, he believes is the perfect atmosphere for him to thrive.\n\n\"When you surround yourself in that type of atmosphere, it brings out the best in you,\" Barcoo told All Steelers. \"That's when I feel like I play at my best, when the fans are out there, lights are on, and stuff like that. That definitely contributes to my success on the field.\"\n\nBarcoo is just 24 years old and needs to beat out James Pierre for the final roster spot. That's a tall task, but if his upside is strong enough, Pittsburgh won't have a choice but to put him on the team.\n\nHe needs to showcase his special teams plays during camp while also making more plays on defense. If Danny Smith likes him by the end of August, he's sticking around.\n\nChapelle Russell, ILB\n\nBy default, the Steelers would keep all five of their inside linebackers currently on the 90-man roster. That being said, they could be tempted to utilize a roster spot for another position, or they could bring in another body for competition.\n\nAs of now, though, Chapelle Russell has a place on the Steelers active roster this season after spending last year on the practice squad. But even if he hasn't made an impact on Pittsburgh's team just yet, he spent last year growing, and feels ready to make noise this summer.\n\n\"Last year was my first year not being active, so that allowed me just to sit back and learn,\" Russell told All Steelers. \"I learned a lot about myself. Learned a lot about the system. Coming into this year, with only being five in the room, I know I definitely have a good opportunity to contribute to the defense. But that doesn't come without my handling business first and foremost.\"\n\nYou should anticipate the Steelers adding another name to their inside linebacker room. But even with a sixth man, Russell could earn his way onto the 53-man by the end of camp.\n\nHakeem Butler, WR\n\nButler is already a fan favorite heading into training camp, and standing 6-foot-5, coming off an eight-touchdown season in XFL, it's easy to see why. But the former fourth-round pick has a rocky climb to make the Steelers' 53-man roster this offseason. He'll need to beat out a few veterans such as Miles Boykins, Gunner Olszewski and Anthony Miller to land on the team, and offensive play may not be enough to earn his place.\n\nIf Butler is going to make the active roster, he'll need to prove his special teams capability during training camp. Boykins was one of Pittsburgh's best special teams players a year ago, and the bar is high to beat him out this summer.\n\nFor Butler to stick with the Steelers, he needs to make plays on offense and during special teams sessions.\n\nElijah Riley, DB\n\nElijah Riley has made some plays during minicamp, and in the midst of a nickelback battle, he's emerged as a sleeper. Defensive backs coach Grady Brown said he sees NFL play in the veteran defensive back, and at 25 years old, he's got experience and plenty left to find in his game - which could come with the Steelers.\n\n\"I think it’s about building on his limited opportunities last year,\" Brown said. \"You go back to the Raiders game. He came in and played some valuable reps for us. Did some things to show he can play in this league. He’s an inside player with positional flexibility.\"\n\nRiley moved down from safety to nickel which should help him. He understands the defense as a whole and can play at multiple positions in the secondary. He's got natural blitzing ability and seems to be finding his own in a more comfortable role this offseason.\n\nHe needs to beat out Chandon Sullivan and Duke Dawson, but if he continues to pick up steam, it's going to be hard for Pittsburgh to deny him a spot.\n\nMake sure you bookmark All Steelers for the latest news, exclusive interviews, film breakdowns and so much more!\n\nFormer Steelers LB Clark Haggans Dead at Age 46\n\nSteelers LB T.J. Watt Thinks He Could Have Avoided Injury\n\nAnthony Miller Release Boosts Three Steelers WRs\n\nSteelers WR Anthony Miller Tweets Cryptic Message\n\nSteelers Next Undrafted Star"
