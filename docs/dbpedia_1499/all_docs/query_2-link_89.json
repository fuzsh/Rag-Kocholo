        "text": "DENVER, Jan. 22 - They were in tears a year ago, the rookie quarterback and the aging running back locked in the misery of a blowout loss in the American Football Conference championship game.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers had done all the right things last season, losing just once in the regular season, sending quarterback Ben Roethlisberger on a supernova ride to stardom, getting the championship game on their home field. But the Patriots crushed the Steelers' Super Bowl hopes, and in that moment of commiseration on the sideline of Heinz Field last January, Roethlisberger, the rookie, pleaded with Jerome Bettis, the veteran.\n\n\"He was boo-hooing, and I was boo-hooing,\" Bettis said. \"And he turned to me and said: 'Come back, I'll get you to the Super Bowl. Just come back, give me one more year.' \"\n\nOn Sunday, Roethlisberger made good on his word to Bettis and to Pittsburgh, delivering an almost flawless performance as the Steelers beat the Denver Broncos, 34-17, sending Pittsburgh to Super Bowl XL in Detroit. The Steelers will play Seattle, who beat Carolina, 34-14, in the National Football Conference title game.\n\nIt will be the first Super Bowl for Bettis, a Detroit native who has enjoyed a distinguished 13-year career, and the Steelers' first since the 1995 season.\n\nThere are four Lombardi Trophies at the entrance to the Steelers' offices in Pittsburgh, reminders of the dynasty of Chuck Noll in the 1970's. But for all their storied history, for all the memories they have contributed to the N.F.L.'s highlight reel, the Steelers have not won a Super Bowl in 26 years; that championship came one year before Roethlisberger was born.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
