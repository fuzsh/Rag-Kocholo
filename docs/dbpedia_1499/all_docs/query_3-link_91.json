But I'll still answer your Monday Mailbag questions anyway. Thanks, as always, for theinquires.\n\nNarrator: \"The Bills lost in glorious fashion.\"\n\nIn summer 2019, I was asked to vote in The All-Time Mountain West Football Project, ranking the top 50 players in conference history. I don't think that project ever actually ran, but I went back to my sent emails and found my original ballot, which I've updated here (and added five more names). I've attached a comment for each of my top-10 players. To be on this list, you actually had play in the MW and not just for a school that is currently in the MW. I'm including college and pro impact in my rankings (I put a lot of weight on pro career).\n\n1. Brian Urlacher, New Mexico: Urlacher is the only Pro Football Hall of Famer to play in the Mountain West, although he's not likely to be the last.\n\n2. Josh Allen, Wyoming: He wasn't on my 2019 rankings, but you're talking about an NFL MVP-caliber quarterback, and those don't come out of the MW all that often.\n\n3. Davante Adams, Fresno State: An elite NFL player, Adams is a five-time Pro Bowler and two-time AP All Pro who is on a collision course with the Hall of Fame.\n\n4. Joel Bitonio, Nevada: The highest-rated Nevada player and highest-rated offensive lineman on this list, Bitonio is a four-time Pro Bowler and four-time AP All-Pro (tied for the MW lead with Urlacher).\n\n5. Steve Smith, Utah: This might be underratingSmith, a five-time Pro Bowler and two-time AP All Pro who logged 16 NFL seasons. I don't think he'll make the Hall of Fame, but his numbers are there:1,031 catches, 14,731 yards, 89 TDs.\n\n6. Eric Weddle, Utah: A six-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro, Weddle made the NFL's All-2010s Team. He has1,179 tackles and 29 interceptions in 201 NFL games (he came out of retirement to play for the Rams this postseason)\n\n7. Derek Carr, Fresno State: A three-time Pro Bowler, Carr is the Raiders' all-time leader in career passing yards (31,700) and passing touchdowns (193).\n\n8. Alex Smith, Utah: A solid NFL quarterback from 2005-20, Smith is the only No. 1 overall pick out of the MW. He won 99 NFL games, throwing for35,650 yards and 199 TDs.\n\n9. Andy Dalton, TCU: The Red Rifle's best seasons are behind him, but he was an NFL-starting quarterback for almost a decade, throwing for35,279 yards and 226 touchdowns.\n\n10. Jordan Gross, Utah: An NFL tackle for 11 seasons, Gross started167 games in his career (he didn't start only eight games in his career). He was a three-time Pro Bowler and one-time AP All-Pro.\n\n11. Jerry Hughes, TCU\n\n12. Brett Keisel, BYU\n\n13. Demarcus Lawrence, Boise State\n\n14. Glover Quin, New Mexico\n\n15. Zane Beadles, Utah\n\n16. Jason Sanders, New Mexico\n\n17. Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila, SDSU\n\n18. Leighton Vander Esch, Boise State\n\n19. Doug Martin, Boise State\n\n20. Jay Ajayi, Boise State\n\n21. Rashaad Penny, San Diego State\n\n22. Donnel Pumphrey, San Diego State\n\n23. Clark Haggans, Colorado State\n\n24. Kellen Moore, Boise State\n\n25. Sione Pouha, Utah\n\n26. Chester Pitts, SDSU\n\n27. Paul Soliai, Utah\n\n28. Kirk Morrison, SDSU\n\n29. Marshall Newhouse, TCU\n\n30. Sean Smith, Utah\n\n31. Tyrone Crawford, Boise State\n\n32. Marcus Cannon, TCU\n\n33. Daryl Washington, TCU\n\n34. Mike Anderson, Utah\n\n35. Koa Misi, Utah\n\n36. Paul Kruger, Utah\n\n37. Andre Dyson, Utah\n\n38. Charles Leno, Boise State\n\n39. Rashard Higgins, Colorado State\n\n40. Eric Wright, UNLV\n\n41. George Iloka, Boise State\n\n42. Chris Kemoeatu, Utah\n\n43. Weston Richburg, Colorado State\n\n44. Logan Wilson, Wyoming\n\n45. Joe Hawley, UNLV\n\n46. Brady Poppinga, BYU\n\n47. Ryan Denney, BYU\n\n48. Rob Morris, BYU\n\n49. Jeremy Kerley, TCU\n\n50. Ryan Cook, New Mexico\n\n51. Matt Paradis, Boise State\n\n52. Austin Collie, BYU\n\n53. Shea McClellin, Boise State\n\n54. Ronnie Hillman, SDSU\n\n55. Malik Reed, Nevada\n\nYes. I'd go Josh Allen-Derek Carr-Alex Smith-Andy Dalton, although those last three are close. Those are the only NFL starting-level quarterbacks to come out of the Mountain West (Colin Kaepernick only played in the WAC). Jordan Love will get his chance with the Green Bay Packers soon enough. Carson Strong can make a run at it, too. But Allen is a Hall of Fame talent and has somehow figured out how to throw accurately, which was his biggest issue coming out of college. He had zero scholarship offers coming out of high school and sent this email to more than 1,000 college coaches while in junior college:\"Hello coach, my name is Josh Allen and I am a quarterback at Reedley JC out of California. I stand at 6'5'' 210 lbs and am a full qualifier, and feel like I would be a great fit in your offensive scheme. Please have a look at my hudl. Please get back to me at any convenience! Thank you.\" And I wanted the Bills to draft Josh Rosen over Josh Allen!\n\nI'd set the over/under at 2.5 and take the over (slightly). The Mountain West is much better this season, but it isn't a lock the conference will get three-plus teams in the Big Dance. Colorado State and San Diego State are currently projected as nine seeds, but SDSU's non-leaguerésumé isn't that strong. It must keep playing well in MW action. I also could see Boise State and Wyoming get at-large bids if they finish conference season strong. Those are the only four at-large possibilities in the conference. Fresno State and Nevada didn't do enough in non-league play and Utah State is 1-5 in the MW. Those three must win the MW Tournament to get into the NCAA Tournament. So I'll take SDSU, Colorado State and Boise State as my three MW teams in the 2022 NCAA Tournament. The league needs three teams, something it hasn't accomplished since 2015. It hasn't had four-plus bids since 2013. And only one MW team has won an NCAA Tournament game in the last six seasons (2018 Nevada). In terms of Nevada, I don't see it. Beating three top-100 teams in three nights (that's a best-case scenario if they get a first-round bye) doesn't seem likely. But the Wolf Pack can change my mind with a win at Colorado State on Tuesday.\n\nFun question from the ex-NSN Minister of Culture. Both have had unique journeys. At Reed High, Austin Corbett suffered a season-ending torn ACL in his sophomore season. A meniscus tear ended his junior season prematurely. Despite a healthy senior season, Corbett didn’t get any offers from FBS schools. Or FCS schools. Or Division II schools. A couple of Division III programs were interested, but NCAA rules prohibited them from providing athletic scholarships.He recruited himself to Nevada as a walk-on by emailing then-Wolf Pack assistant coach Ken Wilson, who was in the process of being let go by then-Nevada head coach Brian Polian. McQueen's Brandon Aiyuk, meanwhile, didn't even play football his junior year of high school. How many guys who do that become NFL starters? He didn't have the grades to get an FBS scholarship so had to go to junior college for two seasons before his star sailed and he picked Arizona State over several offers, including Nevada. He always had elite athleticism, and the fact he went to a Power 5 school makes his story a little less crazy. So I'll give the nod to Corbett, but it's awesome to know one former Northern Nevada football star will be in the Super Bowl.\n\nI can't even give you a list of 10 athletes who have played for both schools, let alone rank them. The only athletes I know to have played for both schools are Logan Yunker (football),Allen Hardison (football),John Welch (men's basketball),Freddie Thompson (men's basketball),Essence Booker (women's basketball) and whoever Jeff Horton took with him from Nevada to UNLV in the 1990s (Todd Floyd is the biggest name). And then you have coaches who have worked for both schools, including Horton, Chris Ault, Bill Ireland, Stan Stolte, Fred Dallimore, Enoch Borozinski, etc.\n\nEric Musselman made $1 million during his third season at Nevada. Steve Alford is making $1.15 million in his third season at Nevada ( ). During Musselman's third season, Nevada drew9,048 fans per home game with a season-ticket base of 5,931 (the Wolf Pack spiked to8,326 in year four). During Alford's third season, Nevada is drawing 6,785 fans per home game (generous listing) with a season-ticket base of5,258. That's2,263 fewer fans per home game, or roughly33,945 over a full season. At $20 per ticket, that's a $700,000 difference in revenue before the salary difference, which would push the number closer to $1 million.\n\nI write about sports, so I have no idea what the hell acost-benefit analysis is, but I imagine Nevada's gross revenue was way higher in Musselman's third season than Alford's third season. Of course, this is not apples to apples as we're in the middle of a pandemic, but I do know my workplace gives away tickets to all Nevada football and men's basketball games and it was nearly impossible to get those tickets during the Musselman years and now I see dozens of tickets going unused in our breakroom for every hoops game this season. That said, I have heard Coach Alford has done a nice job procuring donations for future facility projects.\n\nThird behind New Mexico and UNLV, which would be a nice accomplishment after being picked to finish eighth in the preseason poll. Nevada is 12-5 overall and 4-1 in the Mountain West, although 10 of those wins are in Quad 4/NAIA games. The Wolf Pack hasn't played a Quad 1 or Quad 2 game. It is 2-5 in Quad 3 games. Its strength of schedule is317. It's non-league strength of schedule is335. ( ) It's fair to question whether the record is built off that schedule, but this is an improved team year over year that forces a lot of turnovers and plays hard. The offense has been inconsistent but has been better in recent weeks. The Mountain West has only one top-100 NET team (UNLV), which Nevada just played evenly in a three-point home loss. The Wolf Pack can compete at the top of this conference, but the only way Nevada makes it to the NCAA Tournament is by winning the MW Tournament, which is a realistic goal. It should get a first-round bye in the tournament, and no team in the conference is demonstratively better than Nevada. In the latest ESPN Bracketology, New Mexico is the lone MW school in the bracket and is a 13 seed, so this is definitely a one-bid conference.\n\nThe Bills, and it's not even close. I said several times on NSN Daily last week the Bills and Chiefs were the NFL's two best teams and whoever won that game was winning the Super Bowl. That game made the four other divisional matchups look like a JV affair. The Bengals gave up nine sacks and won. The Rams lost four fumbles and won. The Packers and 49ers combined for one offensive touchdown. The Bills would have crushed all those teams. That Bills-Chiefs game showed you offensive and quarterback perfection.\n\nFun Fact; Josh Allen was 9-0 on coin flips this season before Sunday's game. He went 0-2 on coin flips against the Chiefs. And it's pretty crappy the winner of the game is decided, in part, because of a coin flip. Now, the Bills' staff is most at fault for not forcing a kick return with 13 seconds left. Ever heard of a squib kick? That's not second guessing, either, because I was saying it in the moment. Also, the pass defense game plan on the final two snaps of regulation was horrible as well. But the NFL overtime rules are bad. Imagine if a World Series game went to extra innings and the first team at-bat hit a homer and the game was over without the home team getting an at-bat. People would go insane if those were the rules. That's what these NFL rules are. Use the college rules except each team gets the ball at midfield. Mandatory 2-point tries in the first overtime session. It's not that hard.\n\nI don't have a rooting interest in that game. I would be fine with the Bengals, Chiefs or Rams winning the Super Bowl. The Bengals would be a great story given they hadn't won a playoff game since 1991 prior to this year. How can you hate on Patrick Mahomes given how great his is? So I'm fine with the Chiefs winning a ring. And as somebody born in Southern California (and my brother being a Lions fans), I'm cool with the Rams winning a title and getting a ring for Matthew Stafford.\n\nAs for your second question, the AFC is rife with great young quarterbacks. Mahomes, Allen, Joe Burrow, Justin Herbert and Lamar Jackson are all 26 years or younger (Deshaun Watson fits in that age group, too). Those first five look like future Hall of Famers. That might keep the AFC from being a mano-y-mano battle between Mahomes and Allen, although you did see Philip Rivers andBen Roethlisberger have some success during the Brady vs. Manning years. Bottom line is if you want to win the AFC for the next decade, you'll need a great quarterback. The Derek Carr types, while good, won't cut it. Brady made a smart decision to go to the NFC last year. And if Aaron Rodgers forces his way out of Green Bay this offseason, I guarantee he's staying in the NFC. He might like Denver's talent, but why would you want to play in the AFC against all these quarterbacks?\n\nNo. It was the greatest 2 minutes in NFL history. The teams combined to score 25 points in regulation after the 2-minute warning. Mahomes threw for 177 yards after the 2-minute warning. Craziness.\n\nJosh Allen (637 passing yards, 134 rushing yards, nine TDs, zero INTs in two playoff games this season) is out of the postseason and JimmyGaroppolo (730 passing yards, two TDs, five INTs in five playoff starts) gets to continue playing in the playoffs. For shame.\n\nIf Kyle Shanahan can win a Super Bowl withJimmy Garoppolo at quarterback, build him a statue atLevi's Stadium. Or more appropriately build a statue of his defensive coordinators. Robert Saleh and DeMeco Ryans have been the unsung heroes of the 49ers' recent success. The 49ers did sweep the Rams this season and have beaten them in six straight games, so it's favorable matchup for SanFran. But you know I'm rooting for the SoCal team over the NorCal team.\n\nI was born in Simi Valley, so I am a fan of the Dodgers (MLB), Lakers (NBA) and Kings (NHL). Los Angeles did not have an NFL team while I was growing up, so I decided to root for the Bills since they were always in the Super Bowl when I was little. My older brother picked the Lions because they had Barry Sanders. My younger brother picked the Dolphins because they had Dan Marino. And my sister picked the Jaguars because they were an expansion team. What a crappy quartet of teams we picked. Somehow I got the best of the bunch, and my team didn't reach the playoffs for 18 straight seasons and didn't win a playoff game for a 25-year stretch.\n\nI don't see why Tom Brady wouldn't return. He was a top-three quarterback in the NFL this season and is on a team that can win the Super Bowl next year. I don't see him going into full-time daddy mode. He'll be back. As for Gronk, who knows. That dude is crazy. You could tell me he'd be running USAA (why is he trying to steal insurance from military members in those commercials?) or hosting The Price is Right next year and I wouldn't be surprised.\n\nAndre 3000 and Big Boi have done shows together since their2006 split, and I actually think the split is OK. I hate when bands or artists stick together well past their prime and put out sub-par stuff compared to their peak (see Pearl Jam, my favorite band). I want to remember the best musical groups at their best, and Outkast gave us that for 15 years. As long as we get some concerts from them every now and again, I'm cool with that. I'm excited to see Big Boi at Mackay Stadium in 2022, and I hope we get an Andre 3000 sighting, too.\n\nIt's a case-by-case thing. You can't say a Pac-12 walk-on will automatically be good in the Mountain West. Many of these Pac-12 walk-ons didn't even have scholarship offers from the MW (or any FBS school). That said, Nevada has taken four walk-ons from Oregon, all on the offensive side of the ball. Presumably, Coach Wilson battled against those players every day in practice with the offensive walk-ons on the scout team going against his first-string Oregon defense. He has to have some good insight into those players that makes him believe they can play in the MW. That said, anything you get from walk-ons is a bonus. If you're not getting any walk-ons to become scholarship players, then you're not doing it right. But assuming you can turn walk-ons into starters is foolhardy, too. And assuming a Pac-12 walk-on will be a MW impact player isn't wise, either.\n\nGenerally speaking, first recruiting classes aren't great, especially when you get the job five days before national signing day, as Coach Wilson did at Nevada. I would not read too much into his first recruiting class. Just grab as many players as you can and see what sticks. Generally speaking, second recruiting classes are excellent as you can sell a new team, new vision, new culture. Jay Norvell's second recruiting class had Carson Strong, Romeo Doubs, Cole Turner, Toa Taua, Devonte Lee, Aaron Frost, Tristan Nichols,Jermaine Ledbetter,Tyler Orsini and Jordan Lee. Whether Coach Wilson can nab a class like that next year is what I'd be focusing on. But that is the second-best recruiting class in Nevada football history, so it won't be easy to replicate.\n\nEven before I got this question, I was going to work on that story this week as a follow up to my article ranking the best starting quarterbacks at Nevada since 1976 ( ).\n\nAs for the difference between walk-ons and preferred walk-ons, preferred walk-ons are recruited to join the team, just not as scholarship players initially. Oftentimes they take part in summer and fall workouts their first season on campus. Walk-ons are the dudes who show up the first few weeks of practice hoping to get on the roster. Those guys must prove they'll first show up to watch practice for a period of time before they get the chance to actually put a practice jersey on.\n\nThanks to a tip from last week, I'm doing a column on that Feb. 22, so that article will come out 2/22/22. A nice date for best duos.\n\nNo. The main reason to go to Colorado State is to be on a win-now team with coaches you know. Given what has happened this offseason, Hawaii is not a win-now location, although I do think it's a solid job once the new stadium opens. Problem is the new stadium won't start construction until 2023, so if it's not done until the 2025 season, Coach Chang's fate might already be sealed. That'd be year four of his tenure, and he only got a four-year deal. But you can win at Hawaii if you keep the in-state kids home. I see the Coach Chang hire and the Coach Wilson hire in similar terms, although Coach Wilson is the far more experienced coach, having FBS coordinator experience and a decade in the Power 5. That said, they were comparatively low-cost deals to bring home somebody familiar with when the program was successful. Neither guy was really a candidate for other FBS head jobs, but they make sense at their respective schools and will get the chance to prove they can be a successful head coach at the FBS level.\n\nI can see why Hawaii wanted June Jones. He's more of a proven commodity and has shown he can win at Hawaii. But I also understand why he didn't accept the offer, which reportedly was two years with a mandatory coach-in-waiting on staff. That's crazy. Coach Chang should have success keeping Hawaii kids on the islands, and that's job No. 1 at Hawaii. He should be able to build a solid offense. The key at Hawaii has always been matching the offense with a good enough defense to win games. Coach Graham gave Hawaii that, but obviously there were lots of other issues. He felt like an outside in that job. As noted above, Hawaii can be a good job, especially with the facility improvement. You have a lot of good in-state recruits and the support of the entire state. Add the new stadium and you can win there. The question is whether Coach Chang can make enough progress in his first couple of years before the stadium is ready. I rarely like limiting your potential coaches to those who have a link to your program. You set yourself up for a lower success rate when doing that. But it makes some sense at Hawaii, which is a unique job that needs a \"one of us\" kind of coaches.\n\nINC, as in \"Incomplete.\" Grading recruiting classes is dumb, but 247Sports, Rivals, etc., have to act like they know what their talking about to get traction. Carson Strong was the No. 76-ranked pro-style quarterback in his class.JT Daniels (on to his third school),Tanner McKee (so-so one year at Stanford), Jarren Williams (on his third school, Jackson State), Jacob Sirmon (on his third school, Northern Colorado),Tyler Shough (two schools as a below-average quarterback), Jack Tuttle (two schools as a backup), Joe Milton III (washed out at Michigan, backup at Tennessee) andJack West (backup at Stanford) were all top-10-rated quarterbacks in Strong's class. Almost none of the top-10 quarterbacks in that class became good college players. We can't grade recruiting classes until they've played out their careers. But those rankings at least give bad programs a chance to sell hype to their fan bases.\n\nZane Meeks is also playing for an NCAA Tournament team at USF, so the overall talent level is above that at Nevada, which cuts into playing time. If Meeks wanted to go be the lead dog somewhere, USF was not the right pick. But it was clear the relationship between Meeks and Nevada was damaged last season to the point where a return didn't make sense for either party. A transfer made sense. Meeks also has dealt with a knee injury this season that plagued him last year, so whether he returns to 100 percent health is an unanswered question. He was a valuable player for Nevada during his two seasons with the Wolf Pack. Good shooter.\n\nAnd I'll rank them cantaloupe, watermelon, honeydew, other melon.Watermelon is 92 percent water. Cantaloupe is 90 percent water. That extra 2 percent non-water gives an edge to the cantaloupe.\n\nI did indeed have Auburn at No. 1 . As a result, Marquette fans overtook Auburn fans as the biggest crybabies in my mentions.\n\nBoth are restricted free agents, so their teams will have the chance to retain them if they choose. I wouldn't be surprised if Miami gave Caleb Martin abi-annual exception (roughly $4 million next season). Cody Martin could be in the same category. I'm not sure you're going to see an eight-figure contract signed by either, but they've certainly done enough to get another contract in the league.\n\nHe played the best game of his Wolf Pack tenure against Fresno State. He might be the difference between a below-.500 conference season and an above-.500 conference season for Nevada. He's a special physical talent, and he might be Nevada's most energetic player. Lots of potential there, and three straight double-digit games after hitting that mark only twice in Nevada's first 13 games.\n\n1. Not happening with today's pitcher velocity and defensive shifts\n\n2. Could happen simply because of the power in the modern game and juiced ball\n\n3. Pitchers simply don't go deep into games anymore; the last 25-win season came in 1990 (Bob Welch with 27, although Justin Verlander had 24 wins in 2011)\n\n4. HaHaHa! But still the most likely somehow! I'll take the Mariners to win the 2027 World Series behind MVPJulio Rodriguez\n\nColin Kaepernick also appeared in a Super Bowl more recently than Aaron Rodgers. Rex Grossman also has as many NFC championship game victories as Aaron Rodgers. How is this possible?\n\nAnd, yes, the Dallas Cowboys have been overrated for two decades, but they rate well, so that's why the media always talks about them. This year's 49ers-Cowboys game drew 41.5 million viewers, the most for an NFL wild card game since the Lions-Cowboys game in 2015 (42.3 million), and people weren't tuning in to see the Lions in that game. Fun Fact: Since the Cowboys last won a Super Bowl in1995, the Jacksonville Jaguars have almost twice as many playoff wins as Dallas (seven to four).\n\nThat's an easy yes. All four games last weekend were decided on the final play, and Chiefs-Bills might be the best football game ever played.\n\nThrow Rogan\n\nSee y'all next week!\n\nSports columnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
