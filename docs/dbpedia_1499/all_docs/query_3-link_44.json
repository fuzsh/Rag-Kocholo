I designed, launched, and cultivated it into what it is today. I found a great group of motivated professionals to follow me and my passion. I could not have achieved this without my faculty and their hard work. I did my best despite losing blood, sweat and tears. It has kept me up at night. But, it has also kept me mentally sharp since I have had to grow along with the College. But most important to me is that, for seven years, I have seen hundreds of students come through our doors to learn, to grow, to be better and to better their community. I have seen people enter with zero medical training and leave as advanced-level providers. I have seen MD PhD providers become excited about austere medicine. One doctor comes to mind who cultivated a newfound passion for austere medicine, quit his medical practice and is now working in a remote clinic for a year-long deployment in Iraq.\n\nA new role: I have accepted an advisory position within the College and am partially retired. As Dean Emeritus, I continue to sit at the leadership table, providing advice and continuity. I will continue to influence the direction of the College. But now I get to focus on my passion for teaching, my passion for ultrasound, and my passion for austere critical care. I am profoundly happy to have this freedom to focus on my health and my pet projects that have been on hold for too long."
