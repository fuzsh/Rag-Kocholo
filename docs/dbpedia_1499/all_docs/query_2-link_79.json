        "text": "Thurmond Moore\n\nPosition:\n\nDefensive Line Coach\n\nYear:\n\nFirst Season\n\nThurmond Moore just completed his first season as coach of the Bruin defensive line after having joined the staff in February of 2005. This past year, he worked hard to develop an extremely young group which consisted mostly of freshmen and sophomores. Six players in the freshman and sophomore classes started games along the defensive line in 2005.\n\nMoore, a Sacramento (CA) native, has extensive experience on the defensive side of the ball, including coaching at a dozen collegiate football programs, several NFL internships and NFL Europe. He also coached two members of the 2005 AFC Pro Bowl squad -- Indianapolis' Dwight Freeney and Pittsburgh's Joey Porter -- as collegians.\n\nIn 2004, Moore served as cornerbacks coach for the University of Tulsa. In his one season, the Golden Hurricane ranked 22nd nationally in pass defense, allowing just 191.3 yards per game, and cornerback Jermaine Hope was a second-team All-WAC selection.\n\nMoore spent the 2001-2003 seasons as the defensive coordinator at the University of Buffalo. In his first season at Buffalo in 2001, Moore guided one of the biggest defensive turnarounds in the nation. A year later, his Bulls' defense set a Division I-A school-high with 27 sacks, a figure that ranked near the top of the Mid-American Conference (MAC).\n\nIn 2001, the Bulls' defense reduced its points allowed from 452 to 286 (down 14.9 points per game) - the lowest total since the 1996 team which went 8-3 - to easily rank as the most improved defense in the MAC. Buffalo jumped from last overall in defense in the conference to fourth in `01 by allowing just 357.4 yards per game (down from 426.1 in 2000).\n\nPrior to his stint at Buffalo, Moore helped the Syracuse defense earn national recognition during his two years (1999-2000) coaching the Orange defensive line and future Pro Bowl performer Dwight Freeney. Syracuse placed among the nation's top 20 in total defense in both the 1999 and 2000 seasons, finishing 14th (301.2 yards per game) in 1999 and 18th (311.91) in 2000. In addition, the Orange racked up 61 sacks over that span (30 in 1999 and 31 in 2000).\n\nPrior to arriving at Syracuse, Moore was the defensive line coach for two seasons (1997-98) at Colorado State, helping the Rams to the 1997 Western Athletic Conference Championship and a berth in the Holiday Bowl where they defeated Missouri and finished with a school-record 14-2 mark. He worked with current Bruin defensive coordinator Larry Kerr at CSU and coached Pro Bowler Joey Porter and Clark Haggans, both starters for the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nMoore also worked as defensive line coach at his alma mater San Jose State (1996-97) and had previous coaching stints at North Texas (1995), Utah State (1994), Northern Arizona (1989-93), Delaware State (1986-88), Wyoming (1986), California (1983-85) and Cal State Sacramento (1980-82). He has coached several future NFL players, such as Freeney, Porter, Haggans, Hardy Nickerson (California), Eric Downing (Syracuse) and Adrian Ross (Colorado State), at the collegiate level.\n\nMoore also has extensive professional experience. He worked with linebackers and defensive linemen with the St. Louis Rams, Oakland Raiders, San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals during summer camps. Moore also served as the defensive coordinator of the London Monarchs (1995-96) and defensive line and special teams coach of the Amsterdam Admirals (1994-95) of NFL Europe.\n\nMoore is a 1977 graduate of San Jose State where he earned his bachelor's degree in human performance. He earned two letters and started for one season at San Jose State as a fullback and tight end.\n\nRECRUITING RESPONSIBILITIES -- Local / California: Los Angeles, North Orange County and Sacramento area; National: Oregon (southern border), Florida, Reno, NV area and defensive linemen.\n\nPERSONAL -- Education: Bachelor's in Human Performance, San Jose State, 1977; At UCLA: First year (joined staff in February of 2005); Born: November 14, 1955 at Clark Air Base in the Phillipines; Family: Thurmond is married to the former Whitney Gertzenand. He has three sons, Caleb, Avery and Thurmond Michael."
