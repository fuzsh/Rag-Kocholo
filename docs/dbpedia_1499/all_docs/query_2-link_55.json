Nathaniel then went on to establish a 20-year career in the United States Armed Forces, first as a soldier in the Army and then as a salty dog in the Navy where he fought in and survived three wars for his country.\n\nIn 1989, Nathaniel moved his family to Kingsland and became a well-known citizen of Camden County.\n\nHis wife, Ernestine Clark; his oldest son, Anthony Jerome Clark; and his four older brothers, Leon, Fred, Daniel/Danny Boy and Lawrence/BoBo Clark, preceded him in death.\n\nHe leaves behind to forever cherish his memories, his youngest son, Leon and beloved daughter-in-law, Andrea Clark; three precious grandchildren, D'Andre Desean, Breonna Nicole, and Isaiah Nathaniel Clark; two sisters, Ethel Clark-Prisby and Mary Clark-Hagans; and his loving friend, Lizzie Mitchell.\n\nNathaniel — Bubby to his siblings and Uncle Podge to his many nieces and nephews — will be deeply missed and remembered forever by a host of family, friends and colleagues.\n\nA celebration of life service will be held at 11 a.m.Friday, Sept. 11, at the home of Mr. Clark, 1111 Clarks Bluff Road in Kingsland.\n\nSunset Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements."
