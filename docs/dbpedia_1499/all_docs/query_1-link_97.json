        "text": "DETROIT – A mixture of Gatorade and tears streaming down his face, Bill Cowher raised his arms in triumph and hugged his wife and daughters.\n\nPittsburgh’s very own finally had brought a championship back home.\n\nCowher had a trophy to share with the loyal family who kept him employed. He had the perfect going-away present for a retiring team leader. He had a hard-working team playing its best football at the right time.\n\nCowher’s Steelers got their one for the thumb Sunday night, winning Super Bowl XL, 21-10, over the Seattle Seahawks. Pittsburgh joined San Francisco and Dallas as the only teams to have won five Super Bowl titles.\n\nIt took the Steelers 26 years to win their fifth. It took Cowher 14 to win his first. The Rooney family stuck with him, through good times and bad, long enough for the dream to be realized.\n\n“It’s surreal right now,” said Cowher, who was born in Pittsburgh and grew up in nearby Crafton, Pa. “It is a rewarding feeling to give that trophy to Mr. (Dan) Rooney. That’s what he brought me here to do.\n\n“It really does complete a void that’s been there. I couldn’t be happier for him and the city of Pittsburgh. I am excited for everybody.”\n\nNo Steeler had a bigger smile on his face in the bowels of Ford Field than running back Jerome Bettis, who won his first Super Bowl title in his final game with a hometown crowd cheering him from the moment he jogged onto the field.\n\n“I decided to come back and win a championship,” Bettis said. “Mission accomplished. With that, I bid farewell.”\n\nThis wasn’t the way the upstart Seahawks wanted to say goodbye. They played an uncharacteristically sloppy game, committing critical penalties and wasting numerous opportunities.\n\n“Bizarre,” said quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, who outplayed counterpart Ben Roethlisberger but threw a momentum-killing interception in the fourth quarter. “That wasn’t us.”\n\nThe way the 40th Super Bowl went mirrored the M.O. of the 2005-06 Steelers. They hit some rough patches, held their ground and lived to enjoy a happy ending in front of their Terrible Towel-waving fans.\n\nAs late as December, Pittsburgh was 7-5, a game out of the playoffs. The Steelers proceeded to win their final four regular-season games, three more in the playoffs – all on the road – and Super Bowl XL with a typical workmanlike performance.\n\n“It was just a lot of effort by our football team,” said linebacker Clark Haggans, who had one of Pittsburgh’s three sacks. “We earned this. We just hung in there and tried to have character of stone, where it’s not going to break.”\n\nThe Steelers easily could have broken in the first half, when the Seahawks largely outplayed them. But Pittsburgh managed to limit Seattle to three points and went to the locker room with a lead they never surrendered.\n\nIt was dicey at several junctures. Just when it appeared the Steelers were going to put the game away, Roethlisberger threw an interception that gave the Seahawks life. But when Pittsburgh needed its defense to come up big, it did.\n\nIke Taylor, who earlier had dropped an interception, picked off Hasselbeck at the Pittsburgh 5-yard line with 10:54 remaining. Four plays later, receiver Antwaan Randle El took a reverse handoff and fired a 43-yard strike to fellow receiver Hines Ward for the decisive touchdown. Ward gained 141 total yards to earn game-MVP honors.\n\n“I’m still living the dream,” Ward said. “Sitting on this podium talking about the MVP and winning the Super Bowl, I have to pinch myself.”\n\nThe Seahawks blamed themselves for not capitalizing on numerous chances to build a sizable lead.\n\nThey committed seven penalties for 70 yards, compared to three and 20 for the Steelers. During the regular season, only Carolina drew fewer flags than Seattle.\n\n“It’s uncharacteristic of my team to have that many penalties,” said Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren, who failed to become the first coach to lead two franchises to a Super Bowl title. “We have been sharper.”\n\nThe Seahawks also scored only one touchdown in three trips inside the Steelers’ 20-yard line. Seattle ranked first in red-zone touchdown percentage during the regular season (71.7).\n\n“We had opportunities to score touchdowns,” Hasselbeck said. “We didn’t score touchdowns.”\n\nAside from Roethlisberger’s interception, Pittsburgh took advantage of its opportunities. Roethlisberger’s 1-yard run around left end gave the Steelers a 7-3 halftime lead. Willie Parker’s 75-yard run on the second play of the second half made it 14-3.\n\nThe Steelers are 101-1-1 in the regular season under Cowher when they have a lead of 11 or more points. They went 4-0 this postseason.\n\n“We won for a bunch of people, for the city of Pittsburgh, for Jerome, guys that put in 12, 13 years in the league,” Ward said. “But Coach Cowher, they said he could never win the big one, coming so close for him to have a Super Bowl win, that’s what it’s all about.”"
