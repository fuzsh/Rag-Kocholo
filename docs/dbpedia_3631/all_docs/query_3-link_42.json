        "text": "On any given night in California, more than 160,000 individuals experience homelessness, according to the most current statewide counts, which pre-date the COVID pandemic. About 70 percent are unsheltered—meaning they sleep outdoors or in a place not meant for human habitation—a sharp contrast to other states like New York, where most people experiencing homelessness reside in shelters. Despite being the most oft-used metrics to document homelessness, annual point-in-time (PIT) counts are widely considered underestimates of the homeless population (GAO 2020; GAO 2021).\n\nFew other sources of information are available that document the size and needs of the homeless population. Recently, California has started assembling information from local homeless assistance agencies, providing a new resource for statewide information. Collecting more data routinely, statewide, and throughout the year would offer policymakers greater understanding of the distribution and needs of California’s homeless population. Creating linkages across administrative data sources—homeless assistance programs, hospitals, Medi-Cal, and social services—could improve the state’s homeless response by triangulating all available information.\n\nHospitals, in particular emergency departments (ED), are at the frontlines of serving Californians experiencing homelessness. In recognition of this role, a recent state law (SB 1152) requires hospital EDs to provide food, clothing, and appropriate referrals among other services during the discharge process when they identify patients experiencing homelessness. Separately, hospital discharge data collected by the California Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) includes detailed information on every ED visit at licensed hospitals in the state, and could augment available information on homelessness: in recent years these data include an indicator for patients identified as homeless.\n\nIn this report, we sought to assess whether hospital discharge data—in particular new indicators in HCAI discharge data for identifying ED patients who are homeless—can contribute to our understanding of the size, distribution, and needs of California’s homeless population. We examined ED use across hospitals and regions and analyzed the available demographic and clinical information for homeless patients. We also conducted interviews with health care staff working in hospitals across the state to learn more about how they collect information on housing and homelessness from ED patients.\n\nAddressing California’s homelessness crisis is a top priority for state and local governments as the number of people experiencing homelessness has grown in recent years. At the state level, the governor recently signed an executive order to target resources and develop accountability measures aimed at reducing homelessness and connecting people to health care, social services, and housing. Medi-Cal, by far the state’s largest safety net program, has begun implementation of the California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal (CalAIM) initiative, which provides funding for new services including housing resources and intensive case management. Additionally, local governments have passed funding measures (e.g., Measure 1A in Alameda County and Measure H in Los Angeles County) and created major initiatives to address the rise in homelessness in communities across California.\n\nThe state has made historic investments to support programs for people at risk of, or currently experiencing, homelessness (LAO 2022). Federal resources during the pandemic have also injected more funding into homeless assistance with programs like Project Roomkey, offering new models for providing people with shelter. Because the state has expanded its role in addressing homelessness—through more funding, major reforms in the Medi-Cal program, and greater policy focus—policymakers need reliable sources of information, available statewide, that can help guide decision-making and public investments.\n\nData from homeless assistance programs can offer deeper insights\n\nBeyond conducting the annual PIT counts, local homeless assistance agencies offer a range of services from emergency shelters to street outreach. These agencies operate the Coordinated Entry System that prioritizes and connects individuals to available housing in the community; they also coordinated Project Roomkey, a major expansion in non-group housing availability (primarily in hotels/motels) for people experiencing homelessness during the pandemic.\n\nWhen local programs provide homelessness services to people, they collect information into local databases called Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS), a condition of receiving federal HUD funding for homeless services. Recently, the California Interagency Council on Homelessness, which coordinates the state’s homeless response and funding streams, created a new statewide data warehouse—the Homeless Data Integration System (HDIS)—that aggregates data from the 44 local HMIS databases.\n\nThe HMIS includes demographic data on clients, along with limited information on self-reported health status and behavioral health conditions. The HMIS data also includes information on the length of time clients have been experiencing homelessness, the types of services they receive and most importantly, information on outcomes, including whether people get connected to housing, and if so, whether they fall back into homelessness.\n\nData from Emergency Departments Can Offer Additional Information\n\nDischarge data reported by hospital emergency departments can allow timely analysis of trends across the state for hospitalizations and ED visits by people experiencing homelessness. The ED discharge data collected annually by HCAI now include specific zip codes that indicate whether a patient was identified as homeless during an ED visit.\n\nAs the only guaranteed source of health care open 24 hours a day/365 days a year, EDs are frontline providers to people experiencing homelessness (Kanzaria 2020). ED use is high among the homeless population, and EDs often represent the only contact for health services, especially among the chronically homeless (Kushel et al. 2002; Morris & Gordan 2006; Rountree et al. 2019). Federal law requires EDs to provide a medical screening and stabilizing treatment to all patients who seek care, regardless of their financial or other circumstances. Federal law also requires hospitals to have policies and procedures for patients likely to suffer adverse health consequences without adequate discharge planning.\n\nA recent state law (SB 1152) expanded and standardized discharge planning and reporting requirements for hospital patients identified as homeless. Starting in July 2019, hospitals must screen patients for homelessness and keep a written record of discharge planning that includes the types of supports that were offered to homeless patients. Hospital staff must offer medication, food, clothing, transportation, and service referrals including efforts to connect patients to local homeless assistance programs and outpatient medical and behavioral health providers.\n\nThis detailed information is not included in the HCAI discharge data, but these new requirements heightened focus on how hospitals document treatment for patients who are homeless. Hospitals were incentivized, though not provided with any additional funding, and given guidance to incorporate screening and reporting processes for the care provided to homeless patients (California Hospital Association 2019). At the same time, HCAI has been working with hospitals and providing technical assistance to improve reporting of people experiencing homelessness in the discharge data (HCAI 2021).\n\nDischarge data can also offer an important complement and/or “check” on other limited data sources to document and monitor homelessness across the state. For example, a recent study using hospital discharge data from Illinois found that the PIT counts indicated a 24 percent decline in homelessness between 2011 and 2018. But during that time, estimates more than doubled of individuals who visited a hospital and were identified as homeless (Madigan et al. 2020).\n\nComparing ED Discharge Data to Local Homeless Program Data\n\nTo assess hospital ED data as a resource to identify homeless Californians, we compared it against data from local homeless assistance programs (HMIS/HDIS). Both sources include people who accessed services at any point during the year, thus offering a more comprehensive view of homelessness compared to point-in-time counts. While the ability to identify individuals throughout the year can bolster our understanding of the scope of homelessness in California, it is important to note that discharge data and HMIS/HDIS data capture only people who receive services.\n\nStatewide, nearly 130,000 unique ED patients were recorded as homeless during at least one visit in 2019. We estimate the total number of homeless ED patients to be closer to 143,000 after accounting for visits that were missing a patient identifier. To ground these estimates of ED patients identified as homeless, we situate them alongside annual PIT counts of about 151,300 in 2019 and 161,500 in 2020 and local homeless assistance programs that reported serving over 240,000 unique individuals at some point during 2019. Most experts agree that none of these data sources fully capture all people who meet the federal definition of homelessness, as Figure 2 illustrates. For more details on data sources that provide homeless counts, refer to Technical Appendix A.\n\nDespite growing interest in screening for social needs among patients—including housing and homelessness—no uniform method exists for collecting this information. Multiple screening tools are available that ask about homelessness, housing stability, and other social needs (Gottlieb et al. 2016; Cantor & Thorpe 2018).\n\nThe passage of SB 1152 has placed greater attention on screening patients for homelessness in the ED; all of the hospital staff we interviewed were aware of the law and described updates to their patient registration and discharge processes—and how updates had been incorporated into their EHR data systems. At the same time, hospitals must determine how best to collect this information while providing care and managing limited resources (Taira et al. 2022; Franco et al. 2021)\n\nHospitals are well-versed in creating protocols and procedures that address statutory reporting requirements, and everyone we spoke with indicated their hospital had created a working group and/or designated a point person to address the requirements of SB 1152. At the same time, we also heard that learning whether a patient is experiencing homeless is not a simple check box question; accurately identifying someone who is homeless or at risk of imminent homelessness is a difficult task that requires time and often developing a relationship with a patient.\n\nPatient Registration Staff Typically Conduct Initial Homelessness Screening\n\nFrom our interviews, we learned that most hospital EDs initially gather information on a person’s housing status during the patient registration process. Specifically, staff who register ED patients collect basic information that includes questions about a person’s address and living situation, including whether that person may be experiencing homelessness.\n\nIn our interviews with patient registration staff, we heard that privacy and dignity concerns made screening patients for homelessness a challenge. Perhaps not surprisingly, staff reported that asking people about their housing—and homelessness in particular—was a very sensitive issue.\n\n“The biggest challenge is asking the question on whether they’re homeless or concerned about losing their housing… [Patients] look at registration differently than they look at a clinician—they don’t understand why we need to ask about that.”\n\n“Some patients give you an address, but they’re really staying at an unstable place…. For the patients that are disclosing that they’re at a shelter or they’re carrying a lot of bags, it’s almost a little easier to identify that they’re homeless. It’s really the ones that, like I said, are a little bit more stable. They might even be staying in an RV and maybe still working, and really trying to capture it is hard because homelessness is really broad when you really look at the actual definition of it.”\n\nAt two hospitals we interviewed, staff indicated their patient data entry system provided an alert if the patient’s home address was an emergency shelter or other location likely signaled a person is experiencing homelessness. All registration staff indicated that patients who said they were living in their car or at a shelter were recorded as homeless.\n\nAt another hospital, registration staff had recently started asking ED patients about the stability of their housing situation—for example, if the patient was concerned about not having a place to live in the next few weeks or months—though these questions triggered even more concern from some patients as to why they were being asked.\n\nHospital EDs Do Not Have Adequate Resources to Assist Homeless Patients\n\nAt the hospitals we interviewed, the clinical staff—including ED nurses and social workers—relied primarily on information collected during the registration process, which created a “flag” in their EHR data system indicating the patient was homeless. ED nurses and physicians initially assessed patients for their immediate medical needs. Then, depending on the diagnosis and treatment, nurses and physicians reviewed registration information, which could trigger a consult to social work staff along with further follow-up with the ED clinicians for discharge planning, including decisions around hospital admission and follow-up care.\n\nED social workers at a few hospitals said they were engaged only for consults when there was violence or trauma, not simply because someone had been identified as homeless. Mostly this issue was the result of too much demand for social work and case management services with too few resources available. Social work staff also noted that many homeless patients access the ED at night or on weekends when social work support is less available at hospitals.\n\n“We have folks who show up because they’re cold and hungry—we’re often the one safe place that they know they can go to 24 hours a day. But in terms of being able to help those folks, especially in the middle of the night or on weekends, we’re even more limited than we are Monday through Friday… it puts a tremendous strain on [staff]. And for the social work team, in particular, to have to just turn people out onto the street.”\n\nED nursing staff also shared sentiments about the difficulty with screening and identifying patients as homeless when it feels like resources are not available to help them.\n\n“Do you force [nursing staff] to ask the question [on housing stability and homelessness] if there’s no solution? Are we just asking the question that we have no resources to do anything about? That becomes a huge issue for our staff.”\n\nSome social workers we interviewed expressed uncertainty over whether registration staff had been able to complete screening for all patients. This became a larger issue during COVID as registration procedures changed in order to protect staff. In addition, when COVID hit, many hospitals were still developing routines for processes put in place to respond to SB 1152 requirements. Those requirements were waived during the pandemic to support the surging demand for hospital care.\n\nBeyond the challenges brought on by the pandemic, concerns also arose around how well patients are screened if they arrive at the ED in crisis and are not able to complete the registration process. In these cases, the patient must be registered at a later time, which can create a lapse in screening and recording of a patient’s housing status. At one hospital, ED nursing staff indicated that their EHR data system had a way to determine whether a patient had been screened for homelessness or whether that information still needed to be collected.\n\nDespite some limitations associated with the screening processes that staff discussed above, the ED discharge data can offer new insights on how the homelessness crisis impacts hospitals across the state—and also offer additional information on the health needs of California’s homeless population.\n\nThe significantly higher shares of behavioral health diagnoses are in line with other studies of health care use among homeless populations (Kushel et al. 2002; Morris & Gordan 2006; Rountree et al. 2019). The prevalence of behavioral health conditions among homeless patients who seek care at EDs should not be interpreted as evidence that such disorders are a cause of homelessness: most experts agree that homelessness is caused primarily by a lack of affordable housing; there is also evidence that structural racism contributes to high levels of homelessness among Black Californians (Colburn & Aldern 2022; Milburn et al. 2021; Olivet et al. 2021).\n\nThe high level of behavioral health diagnoses may signal the difficulty of obtaining stabilizing treatment for severe mental illness and substance use disorders for people experiencing homelessness. It may also be a reflection of the challenges associated with identifying people experiencing homelessness in a hospital ED setting. Other studies have elevated the difficulties clinicians face assessing a patient’s housing status and that identification of someone as homeless can be biased, based on heuristic approaches, including visual cues (e.g., bags of belongings or inappropriate clothing) or stereotypes of homeless ED patients (e.g., intoxicated)—especially for clinicians working in busy EDs (Doran et al. 2013; Tario et al. 2022). Our interviews with ED hospital staff also suggest that people who present at EDs with clear behavioral health issues or may have visible signs of being homeless are more apt to be screened and recorded as homeless relative to other ED patients.\n\nThis perception also bears out in quantitative analysis when we connect ED visits across patients. Using this information, we ran statistical models predicting whether an individual patient who visited the ED four or more times within a year was identified as homeless during a particular ED visit during the year. A patient diagnosed with a behavioral health condition during an ED visit had a significantly higher probability of being identified as homeless during that visit than during visits where they were diagnosed with more common conditions such as abdominal pain, chest pain, back problems, or sprains and strains. Refer to Technical Appendix B for more details.\n\nAbout One in Ten Homeless Patients Are Discharged to Other Facilities\n\nWhen people experiencing homelessness visit the ED, considerably more of these visits result in a transfer to psychiatric facilities (5% vs. 1%) and other health facilities (6% vs. 4%) compared to ED visits by other low-income patients. However, the discharge data indicate most homeless patients are discharged to home or self-care (Figure 12); this could mean they went to a hotel/motel, shelter, transitional housing—or back to the streets. The data does not provide any insights on this category.\n\nHospital discharge data could provide timely statewide information on people experiencing homelessness who access care at emergency departments. This type of data is collected routinely, and it is well maintained and well documented, making it a widely used resource for researchers studying a wide range of health policy issues (Andrews 2015). Our examination of the HCAI discharge data suggests it captures a substantial number of California’s homeless population, making it a valuable resource—especially in combination with other data—for filling in informational gaps on the diverse needs of homeless Californians.\n\nWe estimate about 143,000 Californians who visited a hospital emergency department in 2019 were identified as homeless. Based on our interviews with staff, these are likely undercounts due to the challenges of screening people for homelessness in the ED, and should be viewed as lower-bound estimates of homeless patients served in California hospitals. While it is unlikely that patients are incorrectly reported as homeless (false positives), undoubtedly some patients—especially those who may be at imminent risk of homelessness or are newly homeless—are not identified and reported as such during their ED visit.\n\nEven still, the discharge data show that hospital EDs provide a considerable amount of care for homeless Californians. In 2019, more than 400,000 ED visits were by patients identified as homeless. SB 1152 has brought more focus to documenting homeless patients in hospital EDs, but did not bring any additional resources or funding to hospitals. As more investments and policy attention focus on addressing the homelessness crisis, finding ways to support hospitals—and importantly, ED nursing and social work staff—to connect homeless patients with housing, case management, and behavioral health services should be a priority.\n\nPatients recorded as homeless had higher medical and behavioral health needs, higher rates of inpatient hospitalizations, and more frequent ED use compared to other low-income adults who accessed ED care in 2019. These findings are related to who in the ED setting is likely to be identified as homeless, but are also consistent with other research showing people experiencing homelessness have high morbidity. Medi-Cal covered most of these patients, which underscores the importance of the new CalAIM initiative—a program that funds housing-related services, in-depth case management, and includes a targeted program for people experiencing homelessness.\n\nUltimately, we need better integration of social safety net and health system data to guide policy decisions targeting homelessness. While heavy investments from state funds and federal COVID relief aid have injected more money to address homelessness, we still know little about how effective these funding infusions were at reducing or preventing homelessness. A few recent studies have found positive effects of the Project Roomkey program for lowering ED use and other acute health care services by people experiencing homelessness, though these focus on a few select communities (Fleming et al. 2022).\n\nSome counties have merged data from local housing assistance agencies with information from county agencies like specialty mental health services, county-operated hospital EDs, and local jails. Researchers at the California Policy Lab have analyzed these types of integrated data for Los Angeles County to develop predictive models aimed at preventing homelessness, examine racial disparities in outcomes like connections to permanent supporting housing, and evaluate local funding initiatives (von Wachter et al. 2019; von Wachter et al. 2020a, Milburn et al 2021.) Developing similar resources allowing for these types of analyses statewide and across different regions could assist state and local policymakers to develop more evidence-based policies and assess progress towards reducing homelessness.\n\nLinking the newly available HDIS data with hospital discharge data could fill an important gap in our understanding of the people who connect with local homeless assistance programs and those who do not. Further links to other state administrative data—including Medi-Cal claims data, specialty mental health services, social services data like CalFresh or Supplemental Security Income (SSI)—would go a long way toward supporting research into interventions and funding for homelessness services. An evaluation planned for the Project Roomkey program could provide insights into how integrated state data can inform policy efforts.\n\nBeyond administrative data, we need more input from people with lived experience of homelessness to learn more about their needs and how policies and programs can more effectively serve them. For example, a recent RAND study that surveyed people experiencing homelessness in three communities in Los Angeles offered crucial perspectives on why certain strategies may be more effective than others (Ward et al. 2022). More importantly, the California Statewide Survey of Homelessness, slated for completion at the end of this year, will offer the first representative sample of people experiencing homelessness in California and provide additional insights on effective policies.\n\nAs California steps up its funding and commitment to addressing homelessness and works to implement major policy changes, like the California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal (CalAIM) initiative, reliable statewide data will be critical for monitoring progress and measuring outcomes."
