        "text": "Biography\n\nDr. Steven Kuhn is a Paleolithic archaeologist, specializing in the study of human evolution. He is an expert in the analysis of stone tools made by early humans and human ancestors. He has conducted research throughout the Mediterranean basin, excavating sites and studying collections from Italy, Greece, Israel, Syria, Turkey and the Balkans, and most recently, North Africa. He has ongoing research projects in Serbia, Morocco and China. Dr. Kuhnâ€™s research focuses on the role of technology in human evolution, how artifacts and artifact making reflect both the adaptations and the cognitive capacities of our ancestors. More recently he has worked on the evolving role of material culture in signaling and communication, and in the factors that influenced creativity and innovation in ancient populations.\n\nDr. Kuhn teaches courses ranging from tier-one general education classes to advanced graduate seminars. Topics include quantitative methods, archaeological method and theory, Paleolithic prehistory, the ecology of hunter-gatherers, and stone tool technology.\n\nDegrees\n\nPh.D. Anthropology\n\nUniversity of New Mexico\n\nB.A. Anthropology\n\nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz\n\nAwards"
