The table shows the resident population of each state as of 2010-04-01. Under Population history, I have added data from all censuses back to the first one in 1790.\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameUNITED STATES ISO codeUS FIPS codeUS LanguageEnglish (en) Time zone(see table) CapitalWashington\n\nThe United States has been an independent country throughout the 20th century. There are established procedures whereby its possessions become first territories, then states, or are granted independence. The territories and dependencies at present are all treated as separate countries by the standards, so they are listed individually in this book.\n\nOther names of country:\n\nAlmost everywhere, USA is recognized as meaning the United States.\n\nDanish: Forenede Stater, Amerikas Forenede Stater\n\nDutch: Verenigde Staten, Verenigde Staten van Amerika (formal)\n\nEnglish: United States of America (formal), USA (informal)\n\nFinnish: Yhdysvallat, Amerikan Yhdysvallat\n\nFrench: États-Unis, États-Unis mp d'Amérique f (formal)\n\nGerman: Vereinigte Staaten, USA f, Vereinigte Staaten mp von Amerika n (formal)\n\nIcelandic: Bandaríki Norður-Ameríku, Bandaríkin (informal)\n\nItalian: Stati Uniti, Stati mp Uniti d'America (formal)\n\nNorwegian: Amerikas forente stater (formal), Sambandsstatene (Bokmål), Sambandsstatane (Nynorsk), De forente stater\n\nPortuguese: Estados Unidos, Estados mp Unidos da América f (formal)\n\nRussian: САСШ (abbr-obsolete), США (abbr), Северо-Американские Соединённые Штаты (obsolete), Соединённые Штаты Америки\n\nSpanish: Estados Unidos, Estados mp Unidos de América f (formal), EE.UU.

America (originally referring only to South America) was named by Martin Waldseemüller (pseud. Hylacomylus), a cartographer, after Florentine navigator Amerigo Vespucci.\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nThe United States is divided into fifty states and one federal district.\n\nStateHASCFIPSConvTzPopulationArea(km.²)Area(mi.²)DCapitalAdjectiveZIP AlabamaUS.ALUS01Ala.-6~4,779,736133,91651,7052MontgomeryAlabamian350-369 AlaskaUS.AKUS02-9~710,2311,530,700591,0076JuneauAlaskan995-999 ArizonaUS.AZUS04Ariz.-76,392,017295,260114,0014PhoenixArizonan850-865 ArkansasUS.ARUS05Ark.-6~2,915,918137,75453,1879Little RockArkansan716-729 CaliforniaUS.CAUS06Calif.-8~37,253,956411,049158,7076SacramentoCalifornian900-966 ColoradoUS.COUS08Colo.-7~5,029,196269,596104,0924DenverColoradan800-816 ConnecticutUS.CTUS09Conn.-5~3,574,09712,9975,0185HartfordNutmegger060-069 DelawareUS.DEUS10Del.-5~897,9345,2942,0447DoverDelawarean197-199 District of ColumbiaUS.DCUS11D.C.-5~601,723179697WashingtonWashingtonian200-205 FloridaUS.FLUS12Fla.-5~18,801,310151,94058,6647TallahasseeFloridian320-349 GeorgiaUS.GAUS13Ga.-5~9,687,653152,57758,9107AtlantaGeorgian300-319 HawaiiUS.HIUS15-101,360,30116,7606,4716HonoluluHawaiian967-968 IdahoUS.IDUS16-7~1,567,582216,43183,5644BoiseIdahoan832-838 IllinoisUS.ILUS17Ill.-6~12,830,632145,93456,3451SpringfieldIllinoisan600-629 IndianaUS.INUS18Ind.-5~6,483,80293,71936,1851IndianapolisHoosier460-479 IowaUS.IAUS19-6~3,046,355145,75256,2758Des MoinesIowan500-528 KansasUS.KSUS20Kans.-6~2,853,118213,09782,2778TopekaKansan660-679 KentuckyUS.KYUS21Ky.-5~4,339,367104,65940,4092FrankfortKentuckian400-427 LouisianaUS.LAUS22La.-6~4,533,372123,67847,7529Baton RougeLouisianian700-714 MaineUS.MEUS23Me.-5~1,328,36186,15633,2655AugustaDowneaster040-049 MarylandUS.MDUS24Md.-5~5,773,55227,09110,4607AnnapolisMarylander206-219 MassachusettsUS.MAUS25Mass.-5~6,547,62921,4568,2845BostonBay Stater010-027 MichiganUS.MIUS26Mich.-5~9,883,640151,58558,5271LansingMichigander480-499 MinnesotaUS.MNUS27Minn.-6~5,303,925218,60184,4028Saint PaulMinnesotan550-567 MississippiUS.MSUS28Miss.-6~2,967,297123,51547,6892JacksonMississippian386-397 MissouriUS.MOUS29Mo.-6~5,988,927180,51569,6978Jefferson CityMissourian630-658 MontanaUS.MTUS30Mont.-7~989,415380,849147,0474HelenaMontanan590-599 NebraskaUS.NEUS31Nebr.-6~1,826,341200,34977,3558LincolnNebraskan680-693 NevadaUS.NVUS32Nev.-8~2,700,551286,353110,5624Carson CityNevadan890-898 New HampshireUS.NHUS33N.H.-5~1,316,47024,0339,2795ConcordNew Hampshirite030-039 New JerseyUS.NJUS34N.J.-5~8,791,89420,1687,7873TrentonNew Jerseyite070-089 New MexicoUS.NMUS35N.Mex.-7~2,059,179314,926121,5944Santa FeNew Mexican870-884 New YorkUS.NYUS36N.Y.-5~19,378,102127,19049,1083AlbanyNew Yorker100-149 North CarolinaUS.NCUS37N.C.-5~9,535,483136,41352,6697RaleighNorth Carolinian270-289 North DakotaUS.NDUS38N.Dak.-6~672,591183,11870,7028BismarckNorth Dakotan580-588 OhioUS.OHUS39-5~11,536,504107,04441,3301ColumbusOhioan430-459 OklahomaUS.OKUS40Okla.-6~3,751,351181,18669,9569Oklahoma CityOklahoman730-749 OregonUS.ORUS41Oreg.-8~3,831,074251,41997,0736SalemOregonian970-979 PennsylvaniaUS.PAUS42Pa.-5~12,702,379117,34845,3083HarrisburgPennsylvanian150-196 Rhode IslandUS.RIUS44R.I.-5~1,052,5673,1391,2125ProvidenceRhode Islander028-029 South CarolinaUS.SCUS45S.C.-5~4,625,36480,58331,1137ColumbiaSouth Carolinian290-299 South DakotaUS.SDUS46S.Dak.-6~814,180199,73077,1168PierreSouth Dakotan570-577 TennesseeUS.TNUS47Tenn.-6~6,346,105109,15342,1442NashvilleTennessean370-385 TexasUS.TXUS48Tex.-6~25,145,561691,030266,8089AustinTexan750-799 UtahUS.UTUS49-7~2,763,885219,88884,8994Salt Lake CityUtahn840-847 VermontUS.VTUS50Vt.-5~625,74124,9009,6145MontpelierVermonter050-059 VirginiaUS.VAUS51Va.-5~8,001,024105,58640,7677RichmondVirginian220-246 WashingtonUS.WAUS53Wash.-8~6,724,540176,48068,1396OlympiaWashingtonian980-994 West VirginiaUS.WVUS54W.Va.-5~1,852,99462,75824,2317CharlestonWest Virginian247-268 WisconsinUS.WIUS55Wis.-6~5,686,986145,43656,1531MadisonWisconsinite530-549 WyomingUS.WYUS56Wyo.-7~563,626253,32597,8094CheyenneWyomingite820-831 51 divisions308,745,5389,372,6153,618,781\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes. If periods are replaced by hyphens, these are the same as the\n\nstate codes from ISO standard 3166-2. See note below.\n\nFIPS: Codes from FIPS PUB 10-4. The two-digit codes after the \"US\" are also designated as two-digit FIPS State\n\nNumeric Codes in FIPS PUB 5-2.\n\nConv: Conventional abbreviations, standard before 1963 and still frequently used. States with short names were spelled\n\nin full.\n\nTz: Offset from GMT in hours for standard time. The tilde (~) identifies states where daylight saving time is observed.\n\nMany states have more than one time zone; in those cases, the majority time zone is shown.\n\nPopulation: 2010-04-01 census.\n\nD: Division, as defined by the census bureau. Numbers are an arbitrary code keyed to the table below.\n\nAdjective: Adjectival form of the state name.\n\nZIP: Range of three-digit ZIP codes used in each state (although border areas may be served from a different state).\n\nThe last two letters of the HASC code are a widely used set of standardized state codes. These codes were developed by the Post Office Department along with the ZIP code system in 1963, although it was some time before they came into common use. They are also designated as two-letter FIPS State Alpha Codes in FIPS PUB 5-2.\n\nThe census classes the states of the United States into nine divisions, and at a still higher level, into four regions, which are groups of divisions. There are many other ways of dividing the United States into regions. This one merely has the sanction of the census bureau in its favor.\n\ndDivision nameRegion 1East North CentralNorth Central 2East South CentralSouth 3Middle AtlanticNortheast 4MountainWest 5New EnglandNortheast 6PacificWest 7South AtlanticSouth 8West North CentralNorth Central 9West South CentralSouth\n\nPostal codes:\n\nThe Post Office Department introduced a system of postal codes for the U.S., effective as of 1963-07-01. They were designated ZIP codes, for Zoning Improvement Program. The codes are hierarchical. The first digit represents a group of states, usually contiguous. The first three digits represent part of a state. The full five digits represent a post office or urban delivery area. (Subsequently, an optional four-digit extension called ZIP+4 was added to identify a small block of addresses.)\n\nFurther subdivisions:\n\nSee the Counties of the United States page.\n\nUnderneath the states there are counties, parishes (in Louisiana), boroughs (in Alaska), and independent cities (mixed in with counties in Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia). The District of Columbia is its own only division. Territory in Alaska which lies outside the limits of any of the boroughs is referred to as the unorganized borough. For statistical purposes, the unorganized borough is divided into census areas. Counties, parishes, boroughs, independent cities, census areas, and the District of Columbia are generically known as \"county equivalents\". Counties in Connecticut and Rhode Island no longer serve any administrative purpose. Underneath the county equivalents, 29 states have further subdivisions, which may be called towns, townships, cities, boroughs, villages, districts, plantations, etc.; the generic term is minor civil divisions.\n\nFIPS PUB 55-2 defines a three-digit code for every county equivalent in the United States. They are only unique within their state, but if either the two-letter or two-digit FIPS State Code is prefixed to them, a five-digit number is obtained which uniquely identifies the county equivalent. There is also a file of seven-digit codes for populated places, in which the first two digits of each codes identify the state. This file includes codes for minor civil divisions.\n\nTerritorial extent:\n\nThere is one point where four states meet: Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah.\n\nColorado, Wyoming, and Utah appear on a small- or medium-scale map to be bounded only by parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude. In fact, most of their borders deviate by a mile or so, because of early surveying errors that were perpetuated by law.\n\nAlabama: includes Dauphin Island and the eastern tip of Petit Bois Island.\n\nAlaska: includes Forrester, Dall, Long, and Prince of Wales islands at the southeastern end; in the southwest, the Aleutian Islands, extending to the Near Islands (Attu, Agattu, and some smaller ones); in the Bering Sea, Saint Lawrence, Nunivak, Saint Matthew, King, Little Diomede, and the Pribilof Islands (Saint Paul and Saint George); in the Gulf of Alaska, Kodiak, Chirikof, and Middleton islands; and many other coastal islands.\n\nCalifornia: includes the Channel Islands (Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel, and Anacapa), Santa Catalina, San Clemente, and San Nicolas islands off Los Angeles, and the Farallon Islands off San Francisco.\n\nConnecticut: despite appearances, its territory is not adjacent to the open sea. New York and Rhode Island have a water boundary which encloses Connecticut.\n\nDelaware: part of its boundary with Pennsylvania is an arc of a circle. Its radius is twelve miles. Includes Pea Patch and Reedy islands in the Delaware River estuary.\n\nFlorida: includes the Florida Keys, stretching past Key West to the Marquesas Keys and Dry Tortugas.\n\nGeorgia: includes coastal islands from Cumberland in the south to Tybee in the north.\n\nHawaii: consists of the islands of Hawaii, Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Molokai, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawe, and a chain of islets extending as far west as Kure Island, but excluding Midway and Sand islands.\n\nKentucky: has an exclave surrounded by Tennessee and Missouri. It is formed by the southern border of Kentucky, approximately a straight east-west line in that vicinity, which is crossed three times by the Mississippi River which forms Kentucky's western border. There are no towns in the exclave, which lies across the Mississippi from New Madrid, Missouri.\n\nLouisiana: includes islands in the Mississippi delta as far north as Grand Island, Isle au Pitre, and the Chandeleur Islands.\n\nMaine: includes many coastal and offshore islands, as far south as the Isles of Shoals, of which Duck, Appledore, Smuttynose, and Cedar belong to Maine.\n\nMaryland: includes the northern part of Assateague Island, and many islands in Chesapeake Bay, ranging south to Smith Island, which it shares with Virginia.\n\nMassachusetts: includes Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, Nomans Land, the Elizabeth Islands, and other islands off Cape Cod, as well as many small islands in Massachusetts Bay.\n\nMichigan: consists of two peninsulas and many islands in the Great Lakes. The islands closest to Canada are Isle Royale in Lake Superior, Drummond, Sugar, and Neebish islands on the Saint Marys River, Harsens Island in Lake Saint Clair, and Grosse Isle and Belle Isle in the Detroit River. Closest to Wisconsin is Saint Martin Island in the mouth of Green Bay.\n\nMinnesota: includes islands in Lake of the Woods, which belongs partly to Canada. The northernmost point in the 48 contiguous states is near Angle Inlet. It's part of the mainland, but the only way to reach it from the rest of Minnesota by land is to go through Canada.\n\nMississippi: includes islands in the Gulf of Mexico from Cat Island to most of Petit Bois Island.\n\nNew Hampshire: includes White, Lunging, and Star islands in the Isles of Shoals group, and New Castle Island in Portsmouth Harbor.\n\nNew Jersey: includes many barrier islands on the Atlantic coast, but none in the New York City area.\n\nNew York: has two exclaves in New Jersey. The border between the two states followed the middle of the Hudson River. Liberty and Ellis Islands, lying west of that line, constituted small patches of New York land surrounded by New Jersey water. Recently a court awarded partial control of Ellis Island to New Jersey, so the situation may be changing. Four of New York City's five boroughs are on islands: Staten Island, Manhattan, and Brooklyn and Queens on Long Island. New York also includes Fishers Island at the end of the Long Island Sound; Grand Island in the Niagara River; some of the Thousand Islands (Wellesley, Grindstone, Carleton, Croil, etc.) in the Saint Lawrence River; and Valcour and Schuyler islands in Lake Champlain.\n\nNorth Carolina: includes the barrier islands of the Outer Banks.\n\nOhio: includes Kelleys Island and the Bass Islands (North, Middle, and South) in Lake Erie.\n\nRhode Island: includes Block Island and numerous islands in Narragansett Bay.\n\nTexas: includes some barrier islands, such as Padre, Matagorda, and Galveston.\n\nVermont: includes Grand Isle, Isle La Motte, and other islands in Lake Champlain.\n\nVirginia: includes barrier islands and Chesapeake Bay islands south of Maryland's territory.\n\nWashington: includes islands in Puget Sound and Haro Strait. The islands lying closest to Canada are San Juan, Stuart, and Waldron. Point Roberts, Washington, is the tip of a peninsula from Canada, cut off from the rest of Washington by water.\n\nWisconsin: includes the Apostle Islands in Lake Superior, and up to Chambers, Washington, and Rock islands in the mouth of Green Bay.\n\nAmerican Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, U.S. Minor Outlying Islands, and Virgin Islands of the U.S. are United States possessions covered under their individual entries.\n\nThe UN LOCODE page for United States of America lists locations in the country, some of them with their latitudes and longitudes, some with their ISO 3166-2 codes for their subdivisions. This information can be put together to approximate the territorial extent of subdivisions.\n\nOrigins of names:\n\nAlabama: from Alabama River, from an ethnic name\n\nAlaska: from an Aleutian word for mainland\n\nArizona: Papago ali shonak: place of a small spring\n\nArkansas: from Arkansas River, from an ethnic name\n\nCalifornia: Named by Hernan Cortez in 1535 after a fictional island in the poem \"Las Sergas de Esplandián\", by Garcí Ordóñez de Montalvo\n\nColorado: from Colorado River, Spanish colorado: red\n\nConnecticut: Algonquian kuenihtekot: long river\n\nDelaware: after Thomas West, Lord de la Warr, first governor of Virginia\n\nDistrict of Columbia: named for Christopher Columbus\n\nFlorida: Spanish Pascua Florida: Palm Sunday, because discovered on 1513-03-20, Palm Sunday\n\nGeorgia: Named for King George II of England\n\nHawaii: Polynesian Owhyhii: place of the gods\n\nIdaho: from a native word which means either \"eaters of fish\" or \"stone of the mountains\"\n\nIllinois: from Illinois River, from Algonquin illini: warriors\n\nIndiana: land of Indians\n\nIowa: from Iowa River, from native word ay-ah-wah: the sleeper\n\nKansas: from Kansas River, from an ethnic name, Sioux for south wind people\n\nKentucky: probably from Iroquois kentake: meadow land\n\nLouisiana: named for King Louis XIV of France on 1681-08-22\n\nMaine: the mainland, to distinguish it from the islands along the coast\n\nMaryland: named for Queen Henrietta Maria of England, consort of Charles I\n\nMassachusetts: from Massachusetts Bay, from an ethnic name, from Algonquian for big hills\n\nMichigan: from Lake Michigan; Algonquian for big lake\n\nMinnesota: from Minnesota River, from a Dakotan word for cloudy water\n\nMississippi: from Mississippi River, from Algonquian for big river\n\nMissouri: from Missouri River, from an ethnic name\n\nMontana: from Spanish montaña: mountain\n\nNebraska: from an old name for the Platte River, from Dakotan for flat water\n\nNevada: from the Sierra Nevada, from Spanish nevada: snowy\n\nNew Hampshire: named in 1629 after Hampshire county in England\n\nNew Jersey: named in 1664 after Jersey, a Channel Island\n\nNew Mexico: from Spanish Nuevo Mexico, applied to new lands north of the Mexican provinces\n\nNew York: after the city and county of York in England, but explicitly in honor of the Duke of York\n\nNorth Carolina: Northern part of Carolina, named for King Charles I (Latin: Carolus) of England\n\nNorth Dakota: Northern part of Dakota, from an ethnic name\n\nOhio: from Ohio River, from Iroquoian for beautiful river\n\nOklahoma: Choctaw for red people (originally applied to a smaller region)\n\nOregon: possibly from a mistaken identification of the Columbia River with a conjectural Ouaricon River on old maps\n\nPennsylvania: Penn (William Penn, grantee of land) + Latin silva: forest + -nia (suffix for country)\n\nRhode Island: from the island now known as Aquidneck, likened by Giovanni da Verrazano to Rhodes in the Mediterranean\n\nSouth Carolina: Southern part of Carolina (see North Carolina)\n\nSouth Dakota: Southern part of Dakota, from an ethnic name\n\nTennessee: from Tennessee River, which was named for a Cherokee town near its headwaters\n\nTexas: from a group of natives known as teyas or tejas, meaning friends\n\nUtah: from Utah River, from an ethnic name (Utes)\n\nVermont: a coined name, intended to represent French monts verts: green mountains\n\nVirginia: named by Queen Elizabeth I of England using an epithet which alluded to her unmarried state\n\nWashington: named in honor of George Washington\n\nWest Virginia: descriptive; separated from Virginia in 1862 to adhere to the Union\n\nWisconsin: from Wisconsin River, possibly from Alonquian for big long river\n\nWyoming: after the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, which was named from Algonquian for big flats\n\nChange history:\n\n1776-07-04: Declaration of Independence approved by the Continental Congress. The \"United States of America\" at that time referred to a loose confederation of thirteen states, plus unorganized territory to the west of the Applachian Mountains claimed by those states, often in competition. The states and their capitals were Connecticut (Hartford and New Haven, joint capitals), Delaware (New Castle), Georgia (Savannah), Maryland (Annapolis), Massachusetts (Boston), New Hampshire (Exeter), New Jersey (Burlington and Perth Amboy, joint capitals), New York (Kingston), North Carolina (New Bern), Pennsylvania (Philadelphia), Rhode Island (Bristol, East Greenwich, Newport, Providence, and South Kingstown, joint capitals), South Carolina (Charles Town), and Virginia (Williamsburg).\n\n1777: Capital of Delaware moved to Dover.\n\n1780: Capital of Virginia moved to Richmond.\n\n1783: Name of capital of South Carolina changed from Charles Town to Charleston.\n\n1783-09-03: Treaty of Paris recognized independence of the United States.\n\n1784: Capital of New York moved to New York City.\n\n1785-02-22: Augusta and Savannah had been co-capitals of Georgia since 1778.

In 1788, Marietta (now in Ohio) became its first capital. The Northwest Ordinances set the pattern for extending the United States. Acquisitions would first be simply possessions of the United States; then territorial governments would be formed; finally, the lands would be admitted as states. Generally speaking, these lands had no capital before they were organized as territories, but were administered directly from the national capital. Only with statehood did they obtain all the privileges of participation in the Federal government.\n\n1788-06-21: The Constitution took effect, having been ratified by nine states. New York City was the first national capital.\n\n1790: Capital of New Jersey moved to Trenton. Capital of South Carolina moved to Columbia. Southwest territory (officially called \"The Territory of the United States South of the River Ohio\") created.\n\n1790-06-16: National capital moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The extra character is called an ʻokina, and represents a glottal stop. The recommended Unicode character is U+02BB, \"modifier letter turned comma\". This form has been appearing with increasing frequency in Hawaii itself. In the mainland, it seems to be used for its impressive effect. In tourist brochures, it makes Hawaii seem more exotic. In articles, it makes the author appear more of an insider. (People used to try to impress their friends by pronouncing the name \"Havaii\", which is not correct.) I hope that the ʻokina never becomes official, because it is hard to type on a computer with language preferences set to English - just as I thought it was stupid for Azerbaijan to include the schwa when the Azerbaijani language returned to the Roman alphabet in 1991.\n\nPopulation history:\n\nName20102000199019801970196019501940193019201910 Alabama4,779,7364,447,1004,040,5873,894,0253,444,3543,266,7403,061,7432,832,9612,646,2482,348,1742,138,093 Alaska710,231626,932550,043401,851302,583226,167128,64372,52459,27855,03664,356 Arizona6,392,0175,130,6323,665,2282,716,5461,775,3991,302,161749,587499,261435,573334,162204,354 Arkansas2,915,9182,673,4002,350,7252,286,3571,923,3221,786,2721,909,5111,949,3871,854,4821,752,2041,574,449 California37,253,95633,871,64829,760,02123,667,76419,971,06915,717,20410,586,2236,907,3875,677,2513,426,8612,377,549 Colorado5,029,1964,301,2613,294,3942,889,7352,209,5961,753,9471,325,0891,123,2961,035,791939,629799,024 Connecticut3,574,0973,405,5653,287,1163,107,5643,032,2172,535,2342,007,2801,709,2421,606,9031,380,6311,114,756 Delaware897,934783,600666,168594,338548,104446,292318,085266,505238,380223,003202,322 D.
