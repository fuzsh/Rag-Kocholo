        "text": "The list below shows how each California county was created and the trail of later additions which stayed in the county. They do not show the trail of territory which is no longer in the county. To obtain that information, look at the information of the individual counties listed under “Territory which at one time was in [this county] is now in [these counties].\n\nOf the original 27 counties, after 1850 only Marin neither added nor lost significant land to another county. Of the 32 California counties created after 1850, only seven counties neither added nor lost significant land to another county. The seven are Alameda, Alpine, Imperial, Madera, Modoc, Orange, and Riverside.\n\nIn addition to the substantial territorial changes listed, many small changes were made to boundaries. Several of these small changes were made at the time of the creation of new counties.\n\nOriginal county boundaries often followed geographic features such as mountain ridges. In the middle of the last half of the nineteenth century many of these boundaries were changed slightly so that they now run along township lines and section lines.\n\nThe Birth of Each County and Later Significant Boundary Changes - County Listings\n\nAlameda County\n\nAlameda County was created in 1853 from Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties.
