        "text": "City in California, United States\n\nFor the California wine region, see Santa Maria Valley AVA.\n\nCity in California, United States\n\nSanta Maria (Spanish for \"St. Mary\") is a city in the Central Coast of California in northern Santa Barbara County. It is approximately 65 miles (105 km) northwest of Santa Barbara and 150 miles (240 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Its population was 109,707 at the 2020 census,[8] making it the most populous city in the county and the Santa Maria-Santa Barbara, CA Metro Area. The city is notable for its wine industry and Santa Maria–style barbecue.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Santa Maria Valley, stretching from the Santa Lucia Mountains toward the Pacific Ocean, was the homeland of the Chumash people for several thousand years. The Native Americans made their homes on the slopes of the surrounding hills among the oaks, on the banks of the Santa Maria River among the sycamores, and along the coast. They had unique plank-built boats, called Tomol, which they used for ocean fishing.\n\nIn 1769, the Portolá Expedition passed through the Santa Maria Valley during the first Spanish land exploration up the coast of Las Californias Province. Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa was established just north of the valley in 1772, and Mission La Purísima Concepción was established near present-day Lompoc in 1787. Rather than rich soil, white settlers were attracted here by the possibility of free land. In 1821, after the Mexican War of Independence, the mission lands in Santa Maria Valley were made available for private ownership under a Mexican land grant called Rancho Punta de Laguna. At the end of the Mexican War in 1848, California was ceded to the United States, and was granted statehood with the Compromise of 1850.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the area's rich soil attracted farmers and other settlers. By the end of the century, the Santa Maria River Valley had become one of the most productive agricultural areas in the state. Agriculture remains a key component of the economy for the city and the entire region.[10]\n\nBetween 1869 and 1874, four of the valley's settlers, Rudolph Cook, John Thornburg, Isaac Fesler (for whom Fesler Jr. High School is named), and Isaac Miller (for whom Miller Elementary School is named), built their homes near each other at the present corners on Broadway and Main Street. The townsite was recorded in Santa Barbara in 1875. The new town was named Grangerville, then changed to Central City. It became Santa Maria on February 18, 1885, since mail was often being sent by mistake to Central City, Colorado. Santa Maria was chosen from the name Juan Pacifico Ontiveros had given to his property 25 years earlier.[citation needed] Streets named after the four settlers now form a 6-block square centered at Broadway and Main Street, the center of town.\n\nOil exploration began in 1888, leading to large-scale discoveries at the turn of the 20th century. In 1902, Union Oil discovered the large Orcutt Oil Field in the Solomon Hills south of town, and a number of smaller companies also began pumping oil. Two years later, Union Oil had 22 wells in production. Other significant discoveries followed, including the Lompoc Oil Field in 1903 and the Cat Canyon field in 1908. Over the next 80 years more large oil fields were found, and thousands of oil wells drilled and put into production.[11] Oil development intensified in the 1930s, with the discovery of the Santa Maria Valley Oil Field in 1934,[12] right underneath the southern and western parts of the city of Santa Maria, which spurred the city's growth even further. By 1957 there were 1,775 oil wells in operation in the Santa Maria Valley, producing more than $640 million worth of oil.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 22.4 square miles (58 km2), of which, 22.8 square miles (59 km2) of it is land and 0.6 square miles (1.6 km2) of it (2.73%) is water.\n\nSanta Maria is situated north of the unincorporated community of Orcutt, California, and south of the Santa Maria River (which serves as the line between Santa Barbara County and San Luis Obispo County). The valley is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and to the east by the San Rafael Mountains and the Los Padres National Forest. The city of Guadalupe, California is approximately 9 miles (14 km) to the west of Santa Maria.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nSanta Maria experiences a cool Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csb) typical of coastal areas of California north of Point Conception. The climate is mostly sunny, refreshed by the ocean breeze. Fog is common. Snow in the mountains is seen during the winter. In the lowest parts of the city it is virtually unknown; with the last brief flurry recorded in January 1949. The only recorded earlier snowfall was in January 1882. Rainfall averages 13.32 in (338 mm) annually; however as is typical for the region it is very variable, with actual falls ranging from just 4.25 in (108 mm) in the “rain year” from July 1971 to June 1972, to 32.56 in (827 mm) between July 1997 and June 1998. The wettest month on record has been January 1995 with 11.78 in (299 mm) , and the wettest day February 10, 1938, when 3.55 in (90 mm) fell in 24 hours. The record high temperature of 110 °F (43.3 °C) was observed on June 20, 2008,[13] while the record low of 20 °F (−6.7 °C) was observed twice: on January 2, 1976, and December 7, 1978.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 19102,260—19203,94374.5%19307,05779.0%19408,52220.8%195010,44022.5%196020,02791.8%197032,74963.5%198039,68521.2%199061,28454.4%200077,42326.3%201099,55328.6%2020109,70710.2%\n\n2020\n\n[edit]\n\nSanta Maria city, California – Racial and ethnic composition\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

The Santa Maria area is home to an increasing number of vineyards, wineries and winemakers and is centrally located to both the Santa Ynez and Foxen Canyon areas of Santa Barbara County's wine country, and San Luis Obispo County's Edna Valley-Arroyo Grande wine country.\n\nThe agricultural areas surrounding the city are some of the most productive in California, with primary crops including strawberries, wine grapes, celery, lettuce, peas, squash, cauliflower, spinach, broccoli and beans. Many cattle ranchers also call the Santa Maria Valley home. Farmworkers in Santa Barbara County earn an average hourly wage of ~$17/hr in 2024.[25][26]\n\nTwo of the city's major retail centers, the Crossroads,[27] completed in 1999, and the historic Enos Ranch site,[28] still under development, are both situated adjacent to the U.S. Route 101/Betteravia Road interchange and feature several prominent big-box stores. The city is also home to the Santa Maria Town Center, the only enclosed shopping mall in Santa Barbara County and the largest on the Central Coast, located at the junction of Broadway and Main Street.\n\nSanta Maria also features the historic Santa Maria Inn, located on South Broadway; originally built in 1917 by Frank McCoy, it is a registered historic landmark and features a wide range of amenities.[29] Several famous guests have stayed at this inn, including Charlie Chaplin, Rudolph Valentino, Bette Davis, Bing Crosby, and Herbert Hoover.\n\nIn recent years, other industries have been added to the city's agricultural and retail mix, including: aerospace; communications; high-tech research and development; energy production; military operations; and manufacturing.\n\nThe petroleum industry has long had a large presence in the area, since oil was first discovered at the Orcutt Oil Field in 1902. By 1957, there were 1,775 oil wells in operation in the Santa Maria Valley, producing more than $640 million worth of oil.[10]\n\nTop employers\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the city's 2019 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[30] the top employers in the city are:\n\n# Employer # of Employees 1 Vandenberg Space Force Base 6,700 2 Santa Maria-Bonita School District 2,100 3 Marian Regional Medical Center 1,920 4 Allan Hancock College 1,480 5 C&D Zodiac Aerospace 915 6 Santa Maria Joint Union High School District 805 7 Windset Farms 750 8 City of Santa Maria 586 9 Walmart 440 10 Agro-Jal Farms 420\n\nArts and culture\n\n[edit]\n\nTri-Tip and Santa Maria-style barbecue\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Santa Maria-style barbecue\n\nSanta Maria-style barbecue is a regional culinary tradition rooted in the Santa Maria Valley. The tri-tip steak has its roots in Santa Maria.[citation needed] Tri-tip is a cut of beef from the bottom sirloin. It is a small triangular muscle, usually 1.5 to 2.5 lb (680 to 1,130 g) per side of beef. In the United States, this cut was typically used for ground beef or sliced into steaks until the late 1950s, when it became a local specialty in Santa Maria. \"Santa Maria-style\" barbecue is usually used in reference to the seasoning of tri-tip or other meats (most notably top sirloin, or \"top block\") when rubbed with salt, pepper, and spices and cooked whole on a rotisserie or grilled over local red oak wood. The side dishes complementing a typical \"Santa Maria-style\" barbecue generally consist of garlic bread, pinquito beans, and a salad.\n\nSunset Magazine's August 2013 issue features a 10-page spread on Santa Maria Style BBQ, crowning Santa Maria as \"The West's Best BBQ Town\".[31]\n\nWine\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Santa Maria Valley AVA\n\nSanta Maria, along with the neighboring Lompoc, Los Alamos and Santa Ynez Valleys, combine to create one of the nation's largest wine-producing regions, referred to as the Santa Barbara Wine Country.\n\nThe often foggy and windswept Santa Maria Valley is the northernmost appellation in Santa Barbara County. The region's first officially approved American Viticultural Area (AVA) enjoys extremely complex soil conditions and diverse microclimates. Chardonnay and Pinot noir are two varietals which especially benefit from the ocean's influence, and are the flagship wines of this appellation.\n\nSanta Maria Valley grapes are also used by wineries throughout Santa Barbara County and at many wineries outside of the county. The Santa Maria Valley name is used on labels from wineries that are based far away from the Santa Barbara County sunshine. The Santa Maria Valley appellation is bounded by the San Rafael Mountains and the Los Padres National Forest to the east, and by the Solomon Hills and the city of Santa Maria to the west.\n\nTheatre\n\n[edit]\n\nSanta Maria's Allan Hancock College is the home of The Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts (PCPA), a theatrical school and production company. Notable alumni include: Robin Williams, Kathy Bates, Kelly McGillis, Mercedes Ruehl, Scott Aukerman, and Zac Efron. An additional PCPA theatre is located in Solvang, California in the Santa Ynez Valley.\n\nSanta Maria is also home to one large indoor Regal Edwards movie theater, located in the Town Center Mall.\n\nSanta Maria also has a small community theatre, the Santa Maria Civic Theatre which is located on the northwest side of town.\n\nParks and recreation\n\n[edit]\n\nSanta Maria Fairpark, located at Stowell Road and Thornberg Street, is home to the annual Santa Barbara County Fair, which began in 1891. It is also home to the annual Strawberry Festival, in addition to a wide variety of other events, concerts, and conventions.[32]\n\nThe Paul Nelson Aquatic Center offers an Olympic-size competition pool, as well as a recreational pool with a fan-shaped zero-depth entryway. It has swim lessons and a swim club and in the summer it's open for the public and anyone can swim in it. In the main building it has a basketball ball court an art room and a snack room. It also has two Santa Maria style bbq sets and a baseball field. [33]\n\nWaller Park is a 154-acre park located at the south end of Santa Maria, featuring two large duck ponds with water fountains, several playgrounds, picnic and sports areas, a hiking trail, and a frisbee golf course. The first parcels of land that would become Waller Park were donated by the Santa Maria Golf and Country Club in 1928, and the remainder of the land was purchased in 1964 and 1967.[34]\n\nPreisker Park, located at the north end, is home to large open fields, a disc golf course, playgrounds and picnic areas. Its main feature is the large pond with a small replica of the Santa Maria ship, which children can play on.[35]\n\nThe Santa Maria Skate Park is located in Fletcher Park. There is also the Paul Nelson Aquatic Center/Abel Maldonado Community Youth Center. Rotary Centennial Park has a basketball court, a baseball field, a large open grass area, and two playgrounds. Each year, the Annual Free Family Kite Festival organized by the Santa Maria Valley Discovery Museum is held there.\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nSanta Maria's government is split down the middle of the political spectrum, in contrast to Santa Barbara, which tends to be more liberal. Due in part to this political division, plus irrigation and water-supply issues, many attempts have been made to divide the county, the northern portion from Point Conception upwards to become Mission County. Thus far the movement has been unsuccessful.[36] Santa Maria is a reliably Democratic stronghold, having voted for the Democratic candidate for the past six elections, as of 2020 .[37]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nSchool districts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Santa Maria Joint Union High School District (SMJUHSD) is the oldest high school district in the State of California and runs the three primary public high schools in the area: Santa Maria High School, Pioneer Valley High School, and Ernest Righetti High School. The Santa Maria-Bonita School District is home to 16,900 students in 17 elementary schools (K-6th grade) and four junior high schools (7th-8th grade). The schools in the Santa Maria-Bonita School District serve students who live within the city limits of Santa Maria, the county area of Tanglewood and the county area just outside Santa Maria heading toward Guadalupe. There are also four notable private schools in the valley: St. Joseph High School, St. Marys Catholic School, Valley Christian Academy, and Pacific Christian School (K-6th grade).\n\nThe Orcutt Union School District serves students who live in the unincorporated community of Orcutt and serves students in grades K through 12.[38]\n\nAllan Hancock College\n\n[edit]\n\nAllan Hancock College is a California public community college located in northern Santa Barbara County. Allan Hancock College was ranked as one of the five best community colleges in California and one of the nation's top 120 community colleges.[39] Approximately 11,500 credit students enroll each semester at one of the college's four locations in Santa Maria, Lompoc, Solvang, or at Vandenberg Air Force Base.[40] The main campus is in a 105-acre park in Santa Maria. Allan Hancock College is known for its distinguished athletic programs which have included former head football coaches John Madden[41] and Ernie Zampese, as well as Gunther Cunningham. The college is also home to the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts, one of the state's finest theatre programs.\n\nSanta Maria is also home to Santa Barbara Business College, which has been serving the community since 1982.\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following TV stations broadcast in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Santa Maria Television Market Area:\n\nKEYT 3, an ABC/CBS/MNTV television affiliate;\n\nKSBY 6, an NBC/CW+ television affiliate; broadcast from San Luis Obispo\n\nKCOY 12, a Telemundo television affiliate; broadcast from Santa Maria\n\nKKFX 24, a FOX television affiliate; license to San Luis Obispo studios broadcast from KCOY in Santa Maria.

It has been improved to freeway status (meaning all at-grade intersections have been eliminated) within the city of Santa Maria itself. A $32 million widening project that expanded the freeway from four to six lanes between Santa Maria Way and the Highway 166 exit was completed by early 2009.\n\nState Route 1 runs around the western edge of the city and connects it to nearby Vandenberg Air Force Base near Lompoc. The section of US 101 in the city is a freeway, and a small part of a nearby section of Highway 1 that runs between the city and the base is also a freeway, but the two freeway segments do not directly connect to each other.\n\nState Route 135 is considered to be the major artery through the city. It comes from Los Alamos, a town to the south of Santa Maria, and it enters Orcutt and Santa Maria as an expressway. The expressway runs all the way to Santa Maria Way. Highway 135 then turns into Broadway and runs through the heart of the city and all the way up to the Santa Maria River and U.S. 101.\n\nRail\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Santa Maria Valley Railroad (SMVRR) is a shortline freight railroad to Guadalupe where the Union Pacific Railroad Interchange point is. Main business includes storage of railroad cars when northern California and southern California storage area are full. In the 1990s, the city proposed a light rail service to replace the SMV's right-of-way, as its future was uncertain.\n\nThe nearest train station with long-distance Amtrak service is in Guadalupe, to which Amtrak provides bus service from Santa Maria. Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner provides twice daily service in each direction, running to San Luis Obispo to the north and to San Diego via Los Angeles to the south.\n\nAmtrak Thruway 18 provides a daily connection to/from 205 South Nicholson Street to Visalia, with several stops in between.[42]\n\nBus\n\n[edit]\n\nSMAT, Santa Maria Area Transit, is a local bus service provided by both city and county-run lines, it has recently expanded its services during the evening that stretch to 10:15 P.M. The Breeze Bus provides service to Lompoc, Vandenberg Air Force Base, and Santa Maria. RTA Route 10 connects Santa Maria and San Luis Obispo. The Guadalupe Flyer connects Santa Maria and Guadalupe.\n\nLong-distance intercity bus service is provided by Greyhound Lines. The Clean Air Express commuter bus runs between Santa Maria and Goleta as well as a line to Santa Barbara weekdays.\n\nAirport\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Santa Maria Public Airport is served by two airlines, Allegiant Air and United Airlines.[43] United Airlines announced service to Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco daily starting June 4, 2020. United is now booking flights to San Francisco and Denver.[44] Allegiant Air operates nonstop jet service three days a week to Las Vegas.\n\nCourts\n\n[edit]\n\nSanta Maria is home to one of three official Superior Court locations in Santa Barbara County, with the other courthouse located in Santa Barbara. From 2003 to 2005, the Superior Court handled a felony complaint against Michael Jackson (see Michael Jackson: 2005 trial) which reached a not guilty verdict on June 13, 2005. The District Attorney chose to present the trial in Santa Maria due to its close proximity from Neverland Ranch where the alleged incident took place.\n\nLaw enforcement\n\n[edit]\n\nAs the primary law enforcement agency for the City of Santa Maria, the Santa Maria Police Department handles approximately 130,000 calls for service each year. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office also operates within the city in addition to the Santa Maria Park Officers who consist of 6 sworn officers who derive their authority under CA Penal code section 831.31(b). The SMPD is administratively divided into the three divisions, Administration, Operations, and Support, and has 111 sworn officers and 49 full-time support personnel.[45]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nEntertainment\n\n[edit]\n\nKathy Bates, actress\n\nGary Coleman, actor\n\nNino Del Pesco, musician\n\nMyriam Gurba, writer\n\nFrancisco Jiménez, writer and professor at Santa Clara University\n\nChris Lambert, musician, podcaster\n\nBeverlee McKinsey, actress\n\nKim Miyori, actress\n\nJoe Nanini, musician\n\nChuck Negron, founding member of Three Dog Night\n\nJane Russell, actress\n\nAurora Snow, writer, former pornographic actress and director\n\nChet Helms, music promoter\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nMark Brunell, former NFL football player[46]\n\nElijah Cooks, NFL football player\n\nPaco Craig, football player\n\nGunther Cunningham, former head football coach of NFL's Kansas City Chiefs[47]\n\nCarlos Dias, former Major League Baseball pitcher[48]\n\nBlaine Johnson, former NHRA Top Fuel driver\n\nJim Lonborg, former Major League Baseball player[49]\n\nJohn Madden, Hall of Fame NFL football coach and commentator[41]\n\nJosh Prenot, Rio Olympics 2016 Olympic swimmer medalist from SMSC [50]\n\nJohn Rudometkin, USC and NBA basketball player, first-round pick of 1962 NBA draft\n\nMarla Runyan, marathon runner[51]\n\nBryn Smith, retired Major League Baseball pitcher who played for both Santa Maria High School and Allan Hancock College[52]\n\nJim Steels, MLB player\n\nRobin Ventura, former Major League Baseball player and manager best remember for his time with the Chicago White Sox[53] and New York Mets\n\nJimy Williams, Major League Baseball manager[54]\n\nTounde Yessoufou, top NCAA basketball recruit\n\nErnie Zampese, NFL football coach[citation needed]\n\nKen Zampese, NFL football coach[citation needed]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nAbel Maldonado, former Lieutenant Governor of California[55]\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nWilliam Kraemer Coblentz, attorney and politician\n\nGeorge Allan Hancock, philanthropist, oil, railroad and aviation engineer.\n\nJames Lamar McElhany, President of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists from 1936 to 1950\n\nInga Muscio, author and activist\n\nOwen W.
