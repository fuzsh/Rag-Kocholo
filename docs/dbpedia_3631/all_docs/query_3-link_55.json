        "text": "Workers in the Santa Maria-Santa Barbara, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area had an average (mean) hourly wage of $33.13 in May 2023, compared to the nationwide average of $31.48, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Regional Commissioner Chris Rosenlund noted that higher paying major occupational groups included management ($68.09), computer and mathematical ($63.83), and legal ($59.02). Lower paying occupations included food preparation and serving related ($19.33), healthcare support ($20.28), and building and grounds cleaning and maintenance ($20.68). (See table A.)\n\nOccupational groups with the highest employment in the Santa Maria area included food preparation and serving related (11.5 percent), office and administrative support (10.4 percent), and sales and related (7.8 percent). Major occupational groups on the lower end of local employment included legal (0.5 percent); life, physical, and social science (1.3 percent); and arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media (1.3 percent). (See table A.)\n\nOne occupational group—food preparation and serving related—was chosen to illustrate the diversity of data available for any of the 22 major occupational categories. Santa Maria had 23,340 jobs in food preparation and serving related, accounting for 11.5 percent of local area employment, compared to the 8.7-percent share nationally. The average hourly wage for this occupational group locally was $19.33, compared to the national wage of $16.58.\n\nSome of the larger detailed occupations within the food preparation and serving related group included fast food and counter workers (5,300), waiters and waitresses (3,590), and restaurant cooks (2,430). Among the higher-paying jobs in this group were chefs and head cooks and first-line supervisors of food preparation and serving workers, with mean hourly wages of $32.50 and $23.17, respectively. At the lower end of the wage scale were fast food cooks ($16.80) and dining room and cafeteria attendants and bartender helpers ($17.24). (Detailed data for the food preparation and serving related occupations are presented in table 1; for a complete listing of detailed occupations available go to www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_42200.htm.)\n\nLocation quotients allow us to explore the occupational make-up of a metropolitan area by comparing the composition of jobs in an area relative to the national average. (See table 1.) For example, a location quotient of 2.0 indicates that an occupation accounts for twice the share of employment in the area than it does nationally. In the Santa Maria area, above-average concentrations of employment were found in many of the occupations within the food preparation and serving related group. For instance, fast food cooks were employed at 2.3 times the national rate in Santa Maria, and dining room and cafeteria attendants and bartender helpers, at 2.2 times the U.S. average. First-line supervisors of food preparation and serving workers had a location quotient of 1.0 in Santa Maria, indicating that this particular occupation’s local and national employment shares were similar.\n\nThe statistics in this release are from the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey, a cooperative effort between BLS and the State Workforce Agencies (SWAs). BLS funds the survey and provides the procedures and technical support. State Workforce Agencies collect most of the data: in this case, the California Employment Development Department.\n\nTechnical Note\n\nThe Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey is a semiannual survey measuring occupational employment and wage rates for wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments in the United States. The OEWS data available from BLS include cross-industry occupational employment and wage estimates for the nation; over 580 areas, including states and the District of Columbia, metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), nonmetropolitan areas, and territories; national industry-specific estimates at the NAICS sector, 3-digit, most 4-digit, and selected 5- and 6-digit industry levels; and national estimates by ownership across all industries and for schools and hospitals. Full OEWS data tables are available online.\n\nAdditional information about the OEWS estimates and methodology are available in the national Technical Notes. The overall national response rate for the six panels, based on the 50 states and the District of Columbia, is 65.8 percent based on establishments and 64.3 percent based on weighted sampled employment. The sample in the Santa Maria-Santa Barbara, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area included 2,035 establishments with a response rate of 62 percent.\n\nMetropolitan area definitions\n\nThe substate area data published in this release reflect the standards and definitions established by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.\n\nThe Santa Maria-Santa Barbara, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area includes Santa Barbara County.\n\nFor more information\n\nAnswers to frequently asked questions about the OEWS data, as well as general program documentation, are available on the OEWS website.\n\nInformation in this release will be made available to individuals with sensory impairments upon request.
