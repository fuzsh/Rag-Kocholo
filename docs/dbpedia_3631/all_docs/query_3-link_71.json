As of the 2020 census, the population was 3,298,634,[7] making it California's second-most populous county and the fifth-most populous in the United States. Its county seat is San Diego,[8] the second-most populous city in California and the eighth-most populous city in the United States. It is the southwesternmost county in the 48 contiguous United States, and is a border county. It is home to 18 Native American tribal reservations, the most of any county in the United States. There are 16 military installations of the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard in the county.\n\nSan Diego County comprises the San Diego–Chula Vista–Carlsbad, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area,[9] which is the 17th most populous metropolitan statistical area and the 18th most populous primary statistical area of the United States as of July 1, 2012.[10][11] San Diego County is also part of the San Diego–Tijuana transborder metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area shared between the United States and Mexico. From north to south, San Diego County extends from the southern borders of Orange and Riverside Counties to the Mexico–U.S. border and the Baja California municipalities of Tijuana and Tecate. From west to east, San Diego County stretches from the Pacific Ocean to its boundary with Imperial County, which separated from it in 1907.\n\nSan Diego County has more than 70 miles (113 km) of coastline. This forms the most densely populated region of the county, which has a mild Mediterranean to semiarid climate and extensive chaparral vegetation, similar to the rest of the western portion of Southern California. Precipitation and temperature extremes increase to the east, with mountains that receive frost and snow in the winter.[12] These lushly forested mountains receive more rainfall than the average in Southern California, while the desert region of the county lies in a rain shadow to the east, which extends into the Desert Southwest region of North America.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of San Diego\n\nThe area which is now San Diego County has been inhabited for more than 12,000 years by Kumeyaay (also called Diegueno and Ipai/Tipai), Payómkawichum (Luiseño), Kuupangaxwichem (Cupeño), ʔívil̃uqaletem (Cahuilla), and the Acjachemen (Juaneño) Indians and their local predecessors.[13]\n\nIn 1542, the explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, who may have been born in Portugal but sailed under the flag of Castile, claimed San Diego Bay for the Spanish Empire, and he named the site San Miguel.[14] In November 1602, Sebastián Vizcaíno surveyed the harbor and what are now Mission Bay and Point Loma and named the area for Saint Didacus, a Spaniard more commonly known as San Diego.[15] European settlement in what is now San Diego County began with the founding of the San Diego Presidio and Mission San Diego de Alcalá by Spanish soldiers and clerics in 1769.[16] This county was part of Alta California under the Viceroyalty of New Spain until the Mexican declaration of independence. From 1821 through 1848, this area was part of Mexico.\n\nSan Diego County became part of the United States as a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, ending the Mexican–American War. This treaty designated the border to pass through a point one marine league south of the southernmost point of the port of San Diego, ensuring that the United States received all of the natural harbor of San Diego Bay.\n\nSan Diego County was one of the original counties of California, created at the time of California statehood in 1850.[17]: 221\n\nAt the time of its establishment in 1850, San Diego County was relatively large, and included all of southernmost California south and east of Los Angeles County. It included areas of what are now Inyo and San Bernardino Counties, as well as all of what are now Riverside and Imperial Counties.[17]: 221\n\nDuring the later part of the 19th century, there were numerous changes in the boundaries of San Diego County, when various areas were separated to make up the counties mentioned above. The most recent changes were the establishments of Riverside County in 1893[17]: 207 and Imperial County in 1907.[17]: 113 Imperial County was also the last county to be established in California, and after this division, San Diego no longer extended from the Pacific Ocean to the Colorado River, and it no longer covered the entire border between California and Mexico.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of 4,526 square miles (11,720 km2), of which 4,207 square miles (10,900 km2) is land and 319 square miles (830 km2) (7.0%) is water.[18] The county is larger in area than the combined states of Rhode Island and Delaware.[19]\n\nSan Diego County has a varied topography. On its western side is more than 70 miles (113 km) of coastline.[20] Most of San Diego between the coast and the Laguna Mountains consists of hills, mesas, and small canyons. Snow-capped (in winter) mountains rise to the east, with the Sonoran Desert farther to the east. Cleveland National Forest is spread across the central portion of the county, while the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park occupies most of the northeast.\n\nAlthough the county's western third is primarily urban, the mountains and deserts in the eastern two-thirds are primarily undeveloped backcountry. Most of these backcountry areas are home to a native plant community known as chaparral. San Diego County contains more than 1,000,000 acres (4,000 km2) of chaparral, twice as much as any other California county.[21]\n\nPeriodically the area has been subject to wildfires that force thousands to evacuate. The most recent are the December 2017 Lilac Fire, the May 2014 San Diego County wildfires, the Witch Creek Fire in 2007, and the Cedar Fire in 2003. California defines a fire season in which fires are most likely to occur, usually between late July and late October (which are the driest months of the area). Signs posted in numerous spots of the county provide information on the level of threats from fires based on weather conditions.[citation needed]\n\nRegions\n\n[edit]\n\nNorthern San Diego County is known as North County; the eastern suburbs are collectively known as East County; the rural areas located further east and extending to the Imperial County line are known as the Mountain Empire; and the southern suburbs, extending to the Mexican border, are collectively known as the South Bay or South County, including South San Diego, an exclave of the city of San Diego which has no land connection to the rest of the city.\n\nLocation\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Diego County is bordered on the northwest by Orange County, on the north by Riverside County; on the east by Imperial County; on the south by Mexico; and on the west by the Pacific Ocean.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification system, the urban and suburban San Diego area straddles areas of Mediterranean climate (Csa) to the north and hot semi-arid climate (BSh) to the south and east.[22] As a result, it is often described as \"arid Mediterranean\" and \"semi-arid steppe.\" Farther east, arid desert conditions prevail. Western San Diego's climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters with most of the annual precipitation falling between November and March. The city has mild, mostly dry weather, with an average of 201 days above 70 °F (21 °C) and low rainfall (9–13 inches (23–33 cm) annually). Summer temperatures are generally warm, with average highs of 70–78 °F (21–26 °C) and lows of 55–66 °F (13–19 °C). Temperatures exceed 90 °F (32 °C) only four days a year. Most rainfall occurs from November to April. Winter temperatures are mild, with average high temperatures of 66–70 °F (19–21 °C) and lows of 50–56 °F (10–13 °C).\n\nThe climate in the San Diego area, like much of California, often varies significantly over short geographical distances resulting in microclimates. In San Diego's case this is mainly due to the city's topography (the Bay, and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons). Frequently, particularly during the \"May gray/June gloom\" period, a thick marine layer will keep the air cool and damp within a few miles of the coast, but will yield to bright cloudless sunshine approximately 5–10 miles (8.0–16.1 km) inland. This happens every year in May and June.[23] Even in the absence of June gloom, inland areas tend to experience much more significant temperature variations than coastal areas, where the ocean serves as a moderating influence. Thus, for example, downtown San Diego averages January lows of 48 °F (9 °C) and August highs of 77 °F (25 °C).[24] The city of El Cajon, just 10 miles (16 km) northeast of downtown San Diego, averages January lows of 42 °F (6 °C) and August highs of 89 °F (32 °C).[25] Julian, in the mountains, has an average January low of 29 °F (−2 °C) and August high of 85 °F (29 °C).[26] Borrego Springs, in the Colorado Desert, has an average January low of 43 °F (6 °C) and August high of 106 °F (41 °C).[27]\n\nRainfall along the coast averages about 10 inches (25 cm) of precipitation annually, which occurs mainly during the cooler months of December through April. Though there are few wet days per month during the rainy period, rainfall can be heavy when it does occur. However, the rainfall is greater in the higher elevations of San Diego. Some of the higher areas of San Diego, such as Palomar Mountain and the Laguna Mountains, receive 20–40 inches (51–102 cm) of rain per year, supporting lush forests similar to the Sierra Nevada and California Coast Range. The Colorado Desert portion of the county lies to the east of the mountains, which receives the least amount of precipitation; Borrego Springs, the largest population center in the desert, averages only 5 inches (13 cm), with a high evaporation rate.\n\nAdjacent counties and municipalities\n\n[edit]\n\nNational protected areas\n\n[edit]\n\nCabrillo National Monument\n\nCleveland National Forest (part)\n\nSan Diego National Wildlife Refuge Complex,[32] which includes\n\nSan Diego National Wildlife Refuge[33]\n\nSan Diego Bay National Wildlife Refuge[34]\n\nTijuana Slough National Wildlife Refuge[35]\n\nSeal Beach National Wildlife Refuge (located in Orange County)[36]\n\nThere are seven official wilderness areas in San Diego County that are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System.

The racial makeup of San Diego County was 1,981,442 (64.0%) White, 158,213 (5.1%) African American, 26,340 (0.9%) Native American, 336,091 (10.9%) Asian (4.7% Filipino, 1.6% Vietnamese, 1.4% Chinese, 3.2% Other Asian), 15,337 (0.5%) Pacific Islander, 419,465 (13.6%) from other races, and 158,425 (5.0%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 991,348 people (32.0%).[57] Including those of mixed race, the total number of residents with Asian ancestry was 407,984.[58]\n\nAs of 2009, the racial makeup of the county was 79.4% White American, 5.6% Black or African American, 1% Native American, 10.4% Asian, 0.5% Pacific Islander, 10.3% from other races, and 3.6% from two or more races. 31.3% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\n\n67.0% spoke only English at home; 21.9% spoke Spanish, 3.1% Tagalog and 1.2% Vietnamese.\n\nOther demographic data\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2018 Census Bureau estimates, there were 3,343,364 people, 1,067,846 households, and 663,449 families residing in the county. The population density was 670 inhabitants per square mile (260/km2). There were 1,142,245 housing units at an average density of 248 per square mile (96/km2).\n\nIn 2000 there were 994,677 households, out of which 33.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.7% were married couples living together, 11.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.3% were non-families. 24.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.73 and the average family size was 3.29.\n\nAs of 2000, 25.7% of the population was under the age of 18, 11.30% was from 18 to 24, 32.0% from 25 to 44, 19.8% from 45 to 64, and 11.2% was 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 101.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 99.7 males.\n\nIn 2012, it was estimated that there were 198,000 unauthorized immigrants; the origin of the plurality of them is Mexico.[59]\n\nIn 2018, the median household income was $70,824; most people spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs.[60] In August of that year, the median home price was $583,000; this is lower than the median home price in Los Angeles, and Orange counties.[61]\n\nIncome\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the 2000 Census, the median income for a household in the county was $47,067, and the median income for a family was $53,438. Males had a median income of $36,952 versus $30,356 for females. The per capita income for the county was $22,926. About 8.9% of families and 12.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 16.5% of those under age 18 and 6.8% of those age 65 or over.\n\nMuch of the county's high-income residents are concentrated in the northern part of the city of San Diego. The San Diego metropolitan area has two places with both a population of over 50,000 and a per capita income of over $40,000: Carlsbad and Encinitas.\n\nThe county's largest continuous high-income urban area is a triangle from a first point on the northern edge of Carlsbad, a second point southeast of Escondido, and a third point on the southern edge of La Jolla. It contains all or most of the cities of Carlsbad, Encinitas, Solana Beach, Del Mar, and Poway in addition to a substantial portion of northern San Diego.[62]\n\nHomelessness\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to a Point-In-Time count taken for the San Diego Regional Task Force on the Homeless, there were 8,576 homeless individuals on January 6, 2018, a 6% decrease from 2017. 3,586 were sheltered, and 4,990 were not. 4,912 (75.3%) were in the city of San Diego. North County Inland had 1,153 (13.4%), North County Coastal with 822 homeless (9.6%), 602 (7%) were found in South County, and 1,087 (12.7%) in East County.[63]\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to a 2014 Pew Research Center survey, 68% of adults in the county were Christian, of whom 32% were Catholic. 27% were religiously unaffiliated, and 5% adhered to a non-Christian faith.[64] According to the University of Southern California, in 2010, the largest faith in the county was Catholicism, followed by Nondenominational Christians, and Mormons.[65]\n\nIn 2014, the county had 978 religious organizations, the seventh most out of all US counties.[66]\n\nImmigration data\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2014 according to Pew Research Center, there are about 170,000 undocumented immigrants living in the region.[67] San Diego has been a destination for trafficked minors from Mexico and the Philippines.[68] In 2018, the United States Border Patrol caught an average of over a hundred individuals crossing the border illegally each day.[69]\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Diego County and Imperial County are part of the Southern Border Region, one of nine such regions. As a regional economy, the Southern Border Region is the smallest but most economically diverse region in the state. However, the two counties maintain weak relations and have little in common aside from their common border.[70] The region has a high cost of living.[71] This includes the highest cost of water in the United States.[72] As of 2018 , San Diego County is within the top ten highest cost of rent in the United States;[73] this has led to people moving out of the county.[74]\n\nAgriculture\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Diego County's agriculture industry was worth $1.85 billion in 2013,[75] and is one of the top five egg producing counties in the United States.[76] In 2013, San Diego County also had the most small farms of any county in the United States, and had the 19th largest agricultural economy of any county in the United States.[77] According to the San Diego Farm Bureau, San Diego County is the United States' leading producer of avocados and nursery crops.[78] Until the early 20th century, San Diego County had a thriving wine industry; however the 1916 Charles Hatfield flood was the beginning of the end of the industry which included the destruction of the Daneri winery in Otay Valley.[79] As of October 2016 , there are roughly one hundred vineyards and wineries in San Diego County.[80]\n\nBy the 2019–2020 statistical survey, California Department of Food & Agriculture (cdfa) found that the nursery trade dominated the county's agriculture by dollar value.[81] Second place went to avocado production.[81]\n\nBreweries\n\n[edit]\n\nThe county has been called \"the Craft Beer Capital of America\".[82] Brewing has been one of the fastest-growing business sectors with local breweries ranking among the 50 largest craft brewers in the United States and breweries that are consistently rated among the top breweries in the world.\n\nCannabis\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Cannabis in California\n\nCommercial operations to grow, test, or sell cannabis are not allowed in the unincorporated areas of the county. Companies must be licensed by the local agency to operate and each city or county may authorize none or only some of these activities. Local governments may not prohibit adults, who are in compliance with state laws, from growing, using, or transporting marijuana for personal use.[83]\n\nTourism\n\n[edit]\n\nTourism plays a large part in the economics of the San Diego metropolitan area. Tourists are drawn to the region for a well rounded experience, everything from shopping to surfing as well as its mild climate. Its numerous tourist destinations include Westfield UTC, Seaport Village, Westfield Mission Valley and Fashion Valley Mall for shopping. SeaWorld San Diego and Legoland California as amusement parks. Golf courses such as Torrey Pines Golf Course and Balboa Park Golf Course. Museums such as the Museum of Us, San Diego Museum of Art, Reuben H. Fleet Science Center, San Diego Natural History Museum, USS Midway Museum, and the San Diego Air and Space Museum. Historical places such as the Gaslamp Quarter, Balboa Park and Old Town San Diego State Historic Park. Wildlife refuges, zoos, and aquariums such as the Birch Aquarium at Scripps, San Diego Zoo's Safari Park, San Diego Zoo and San Diego-La Jolla Underwater Park. Outdoor destinations include the Peninsular Ranges for hiking, biking, mountainboarding and trail riding. Surfing locations include Swami's, Stone Steps Beach, Torrey Pines State Beach, Cardiff State Beach, San Onofre State Beach and the southern portion of Black's Beach.\n\nThe region is host to the second largest cruise ship industry in California which generates an estimated $2 million annually from purchases of food, fuel, supplies, and maintenance services.[84] In 2008 the Port of San Diego hosted 252 ship calls and more than 800,000 passengers.[85]\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Culture of San Diego\n\nThe culture of San Diego is influenced heavily by American and Mexican cultures due to its position as a border town, its large Hispanic population, and its history as part of Spanish America and Mexico. The area's longtime association with the U.S. military also contributes to its culture. Present-day culture includes many historical and tourist attractions, a thriving musical and theatrical scene, numerous notable special events, a varied cuisine, and a reputation as one of America's premier centers of craft brewing.\n\nSites of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nMount Laguna Observatory, owned and primarily operated by San Diego State University\n\nPalomar Observatory, owned and primarily operated by the California Institute of Technology\n\nThe Ramona Valley wine-producing region, located 28 miles (45 km) northeast of the city of San Diego\n\nSan Diego Zoo Safari Park, formerly known as the San Diego Wild Animal Park, 35 miles (56 km) north of the San Diego Zoo and east of Escondido\n\nSeaWorld San Diego on Mission Bay.\n\nMission Bay Park, including Fiesta Island, a sheltered bay popular for water sports, also known for the annual Over-the-line tournament.\n\nMission San Diego de Alcalá, the first of California's 21 Spanish missions.

The County government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social services. In addition the County serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas.[99] Some chartered cities such as San Diego and Chula Vista provide municipal services such as police, public safety, libraries, parks and recreation, and zoning. Other cities such as Del Mar and Vista arrange to have the County provide some or all of these services on a contract basis.\n\nThe county government is composed of the elected five-member Board of Supervisors, several other elected offices and officers\n\nOffice Official Party Clerk Jordan Marks Republican District Attorney Summer Stephan Independent Sheriff Kelly Martinez Democratic Treasurer Dan McAllister Republican\n\nand numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the Chief Administrative Officer such as the Probation Department. In addition, several entities of the government of California have jurisdiction conterminous with San Diego County, such as the San Diego Superior Court.\n\nUnder its foundational Charter, the five-member elected San Diego County Board of Supervisors is the county legislature. The board operates in a legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial capacity. As a legislative authority, it can pass ordinances for the unincorporated areas (ordinances that affect the whole county, like posting of restaurant ratings, must be ratified by the individual city). As an executive body, it can tell the county departments what to do, and how to do it. As a quasi-judicial body, the Board is the final venue of appeal in the local planning process.\n\nAs of June 2023, the members of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors are:[100]\n\nDistrict Supervisor Party 1 Nora Vargas (Chair) Democrat 2 Joel Anderson (Chair Pro Tem) Republican 3 Terra Lawson-Remer (Vice Chair) Democrat 4 Monica Montgomery-Steppe Democrat 5 Jim Desmond Republican\n\nFor several decades, ending in 2013, all five supervisors were Republican, white, graduates of San Diego State University, and had been in office since 1995 or earlier. The Board was criticized for this homogeneity, which was made possible because supervisors draw their own district lines and, until 2010, were not subject to term limits.[101][102]) That pattern was broken in 2013 when Slater-Price retired; she was replaced by Democrat Dave Roberts, who won election to the seat in November 2012 and was inaugurated in January 2013.[103]\n\nThe San Diego County Code is the codified law of San Diego County in the form of ordinances passed by the Board of Supervisors. The Administrative Code establishes the powers and duties of all officers and the procedures and rules of operation of all departments.\n\nThe county motto is \"The noblest motive is the public good.\" County government offices are housed in the historic County Administration Center Building, constructed in 1935–1938 with funding from the Works Progress Administration.[104]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Diego County registered voters (2019)[105] Total population[106] 3,338,330 Registered voters[107] 1,747,383 52.3% Democratic 623,925 35.7% Republican 475,149 27.2% Democratic–Republican spread +148,776 +8.5% No party preference 552,538 31.6% American Independent 55,800 3.2% Libertarian 16,355 0.9% Other 11,474 0.7% Green 6,887 0.4% Peace and Freedom 5,255 0.3%\n\nVoting\n\n[edit]\n\nWith its prominent armed forces presence, San Diego County, historically, has been a Republican stronghold. The Republican presidential nominee carried the county in every presidential election from 1948 through 2004, except in 1992, when Bill Clinton won a plurality. In 2008, Barack Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win a majority of votes in San Diego County since World War II; upon his reelection in 2012, he again won a majority of the county votes. In 2020, San Diego County voted in favor of the Democratic presidential candidate (former Vice President Joe Biden) by a margin of 22.8%, the county's largest margin for a Democratic candidate since 1936.\n\nUnited States presidential election results for San Diego County, California[108] Year Republican Democratic Third party(ies) No. % No. % No. % 2020 600,094 37.46% 964,650 60.21% 37,399 2.33% 2016 477,766 36.43% 735,476 56.07% 98,376 7.50% 2012 536,726 44.95% 626,957 52.51% 30,266 2.53% 2008 541,032 43.79% 666,581 53.95% 27,890 2.26% 2004 596,033 52.45% 526,437 46.33% 13,881 1.22% 2000 475,736 49.63% 437,666 45.66% 45,232 4.72% 1996 402,876 45.57% 389,964 44.11% 91,311 10.33% 1992 352,125 35.69% 367,397 37.24% 267,124 27.07% 1988 523,143 60.19% 333,264 38.34% 12,788 1.47% 1984 502,344 65.30% 257,029 33.41% 9,894 1.29% 1980 435,910 60.81% 195,410 27.26% 85,546 11.93% 1976 353,302 55.74% 263,654 41.60% 16,839 2.66% 1972 371,627 61.82% 206,455 34.34% 23,055 3.84% 1968 261,540 56.26% 167,669 36.07% 35,654 7.67% 1964 214,445 50.31% 211,808 49.69% 33 0.01% 1960 223,056 56.41% 171,259 43.31% 1,106 0.28% 1956 195,742 64.47% 106,716 35.15% 1,147 0.38% 1952 186,091 63.50% 105,255 35.92% 1,688 0.58% 1948 101,552 49.43% 98,217 47.80% 5,690 2.77% 1944 75,746 45.42% 89,959 53.94% 1,059 0.64% 1940 55,434 43.27% 71,188 55.57% 1,488 1.16% 1936 35,686 35.04% 64,628 63.45% 1,540 1.51% 1932 35,305 41.46% 45,622 53.58% 4,223 4.96% 1928 47,769 67.14% 22,749 31.97% 633 0.89% 1924 22,726 48.99% 2,944 6.35% 20,721 44.67% 1920 19,826 63.78% 8,478 27.27% 2,783 8.95% 1916 16,978 46.47% 16,815 46.02% 2,744 7.51% 1912 63 0.29% 9,731 44.79% 11,934 54.92% 1908 5,412 57.56% 2,393 25.45% 1,598 16.99% 1904 4,303 59.52% 1,398 19.34% 1,529 21.15% 1900 3,800 54.91% 2,678 38.69% 443 6.40% 1896 3,631 46.86% 3,908 50.44% 209 2.70% 1892 3,525 45.71% 2,334 30.26% 1,853 24.03% 1888 4,661 56.88% 3,189 38.92% 344 4.20% 1884 1,120 57.00% 800 40.71% 45 2.29% 1880 743 56.80% 546 41.74% 19 1.45%\n\nThe city of San Diego itself is more Democratic than the county average, and has largely voted Democrat in each presidential election since 1992; certain areas and cities within the county are swing areas, and have split their votes, in post-2000 elections. The county's Republican population gradually increases the further one travels away from the city center; the Republican strongholds are (more or less) concentrated throughout La Jolla, Coronado, the regions of North County and East County, the eastern backlands and remote mountain communities (including Julian). While these areas have been traditionally Republican, all maintain a considerably varied population of Liberals, Democrats, Libertarians, Independents, and others.\n\nOne unique feature of the political scene is the use of Golden Hall, a convention facility next to San Diego's City Hall, as \"Election Central.\" The County Registrar of Voters rents the hall to distribute election results. Supporters and political observers gather to watch the results come in; supporters of the various candidates parade around the hall, carrying signs and chanting; candidates give their victory and concession speeches and host parties for campaign volunteers and donors at the site; and television stations broadcast live from the floor of the convention center.[109] The atmosphere at Election Central on the evening of election day has been compared to the voting portion of a political party national convention.[110]\n\nOn November 4, 2008, San Diego County voted 53.71% for Proposition 8, which amended the California Constitution, effectively placing a ban on same-sex marriages; this proposition would restore Proposition 22, which was overturned by a ruling from the California Supreme Court. However, the City of San Diego, along with the North County coastal cities of Del Mar, Encinitas, and Solana Beach voted against Proposition 8. La Mesa was a virtual tie for Prop. 8 support, while Carlsbad supported the referendum by only a 2% margin.[111]\n\nFederal and state representation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the U.S. House of Representatives, San Diego County is split between five congressional districts:[112]\n\nCalifornia's 48th congressional district, represented by Republican Darrell Issa\n\nCalifornia's 49th congressional district, represented by Democrat Mike Levin\n\nCalifornia's 50th congressional district, represented by Democrat Scott Peters\n\nCalifornia's 51st congressional district, represented by Democrat Sara Jacobs and\n\nCalifornia's 52nd congressional district, represented by Democrat Juan Vargas.\n\nIn the California State Assembly, San Diego County is split between seven legislative districts:[113]\n\nthe 71st Assembly District, represented by Republican Kate Sanchez,\n\nthe 75th Assembly District, represented by Republican Marie Waldron,\n\nthe 76th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Brian Maienschein,\n\nthe 77th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Tasha Boerner,\n\nthe 78th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Chris Ward,\n\nthe 79th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Akilah Weber, and\n\nthe 80th Assembly District, represented by Democrat David Alvarez.\n\nIn the California State Senate, San Diego County is split between four legislative districts:[114]\n\nthe 36th Senate District, represented by Republican Janet Nguyen,\n\nthe 38th Senate District, represented by Democrat Catherine Blakespear,\n\nthe 39th Senate District, represented by Democrat Toni Atkins, and\n\nthe 40th Senate District, represented by Republican Brian Jones.\n\nCrime\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following table includes the number of incidents reported and the rate per 1,000 persons for each type of offense.\n\nPopulation and crime rates Population[106] 3,060,849 Violent crime[115] 12,775 4.17 Homicide[115] 75 0.02 Forcible rape[115] 746 0.24 Robbery[115] 4,033 1.32 Aggravated assault[115] 7,921 2.59 Property crime[115] 43,525 14.22 Burglary[115] 14,522 4.74 Larceny-theft[115][note 1] 41,278 13.49 Motor vehicle theft[115] 13,938 4.55 Arson[115] 394 0.13\n\nCities by population and crime rates\n\n[edit]\n\nCities by population and crime rates City Population[116] Violent crimes[116] Violent crime rate\n\nper 1,000 persons Property crimes[116] Property crime rate\n\nper 1,000 persons Carlsbad 107,879 265 2.46 2,109 19.55 Chula Vista 249,830 581 2.33 5,081 20.34 Coronado 19,345 20 1.03 504 26.05 Del Mar 4,263 15 3.52 211 49.50 El Cajon 101,864 365 3.58 2,414 23.70 Encinitas 60,960 150 2.46 1,296 21.26 Escondido 147,386 628 4.26 3,887 26.37 Imperial Beach 26,956 147 5.45 471 17.47 La Mesa 58,444 224 3.83 1,732 29.64 Lemon Grove 25,932 137 5.28 434 16.74 National City 59,920 371 6.19 1,863 31.09 Oceanside 171,141 728 4.25 4,289 25.06 Poway 48,968 94 1.92 559 11.42 San Diego 1,338,477 5,529 4.13 31,700 23.68 San Marcos 85,810 227 2.65 1,502 17.50 Santee 54,700 154 2.82 1,109 20.27 Solana Beach 13,181 24 1.82 313 23.75 Vista 96,087 465 4.84 1,885 19.62\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Diego County contains three public state universities: University of California, San Diego (UCSD); San Diego State University (SDSU); and California State University, San Marcos (CSUSM). Major private universities in the county include University of San Diego (USD), Point Loma Nazarene University (PLNU), Alliant International University (AIU), and National University. It also includes three law schools, USD School of Law, California Western School of Law, and Thomas Jefferson School of Law.\n\nWithin the county there are 24 public elementary school districts, 6 high school districts, and 12 unified school districts. There are also five community college districts.[117]\n\nSeveral cities in the county maintain public library systems, including the city of San Diego itself. The San Diego County Library serves all other areas of the county. In 2010 the county library had 33 branches and two bookmobiles; circulated over 10.7 million books, CDs, DVDs, and other material formats; recorded 5.7 million visits to library branches; and hosted 21,132 free programs and events.

NAS North Island is located on the north side of Coronado, and is home to Headquarters for Naval Air Forces and Naval Air Force Pacific, the bulk of the Pacific Fleet's helicopter squadrons, and part of the West Coast aircraft carrier fleet.\n\nThe Naval Special Warfare Center is the primary training center for SEALs, and is also located on Coronado. The area contains five major naval bases and the U.S. Marines base Camp Pendleton. Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton is the major West Coast base of the United States Marine Corps and serves as its prime amphibious training base.[122] It is located on the Southern California coast, bordered by Oceanside to the south, San Clemente to the north, and Fallbrook to the east.\n\nU.S. Navy\n\n[edit]\n\nNaval Base San Diego, also known as 32nd Street Naval Station\n\nNaval Amphibious Base Coronado\n\nNaval Air Station North Island\n\nNaval Base Point Loma, which includes the Submarine Base and the Fleet Antisubmarine Warfare Training Center\n\nSpace and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR)\n\nNaval Medical Center San Diego, also known as Bob Wilson Naval Hospital and Balboa Naval Hospital\n\nU.S. Marine Corps\n\n[edit]\n\nMarine Corps Base Camp Pendleton\n\nMarine Corps Air Station Miramar\n\nMarine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego\n\nU.S. Coast Guard\n\n[edit]\n\nCoast Guard Air Station San Diego\n\nU.S. Air Force\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Diego Air National Guard Station, which is home to the 147th Combat Communications Squadron.\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Diego County is primarily served by media in San Diego, including TV and radio stations based in the city.\n\nNewspapers\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Diego County is served by many newspapers. The major regional paper is The San Diego Union-Tribune, also known as U-T San Diego or just \"The U-T\" by locals, is ranked 23rd in the country (by daily circulation) as of March 2013.[123] The Union-Tribune serves both San Diego County and neighboring Imperial County. The former North County Times, based in Escondido and serving portions of Riverside County and North County, was purchased by the Union-Tribune in 2012 and closed down. For about a year after absorbing the North County Times the Union-Tribune published a North County edition,[124] but the regional edition was later abandoned.[125] The Los Angeles Times is also delivered in portions of the county. Many of the area's cities, towns and neighborhoods have their own local newspapers; the Union Tribune bought eight local weeklies in 2013 and is continuing to publish them as independent local newspapers.[125] The San Diego Daily Transcript reports business and legal news. Privately published papers like the Military Press Newspaper and the Navy Dispatch serve the military community both on and off base.\n\nOther media\n\n[edit]\n\nCounty Television Network is a public-access television cable channel, offering a \"hometown blend of C-SPAN, the Lifetime, History, Travel, and Discovery channels\" for the county, and funded by fees paid by cable companies.[126]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nBorder crossings to Mexico\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Ysidro Port of Entry\n\nOtay Mesa Port of Entry\n\nOtay Mesa East Port of Entry (projected opening 2024)\n\nTecate Port of Entry\n\nRailroads\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Diego County\n\nStation diagram\n\nOceanside Coast Highway Crouch Street Carlsbad Village El Camino Real Rancho Del Oro College Boulevard Carlsbad Poinsettia Melrose Drive Vista Civic Center–Vista Buena Creek Encinitas Palomar College San Marcos Civic Center Cal State San Marcos Solana Beach Nordahl Road Escondido Sorrento Valley UCSD West/Pepper Canyon UCSD East/Voigt Drive VA Medical Center Executive Drive Nobel Drive University Towne Center Balboa Avenue Clairemont Drive Tecolote Road Morena/Linda Vista Old Town\n\nFashion ValleyTransit Center\n\nWashington Street Hazard Center Middletown County Center/Little Italy Mission Valley Center Santa Fe Depot America Plaza Rio Vista Courthouse Civic Center Fifth Avenue Fenton Parkway City College Park & Market Qualcomm Stadium Seaport Village Convention Center Mission San Diego Gaslamp Quarter Grantville 12th & Imperial Transit Center\n\nSan Diego State UniversityTransit Center\n\nStorage & Maintenance Yard\n\nAlvarado Barrio Logan Harborside 25th & Commercial Pacific Fleet 32nd & Commercial 8th Street 47th Street 24th Street Euclid Avenue E Street Encanto/62nd Street H Street Massachusetts Avenue Palomar Street Lemon Grove Depot Palm Avenue Spring Street Iris Avenue La Mesa Boulevard Beyer Boulevard 70th Street San Ysidro Grossmont Amaya Drive El Cajon Arnele Avenue Gillespie Field Santee Town Center\n\n(Amtrak) Pacific Surfliner\n\nCoaster\n\nMetrolink\n\nSan Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway\n\nSan Diego and Imperial Valley Railroad\n\nLight rail and local transit\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Diego Trolley\n\nSan Diego Metropolitan Transit System (SDMTS/MTS)\n\nSprinter\n\nNorth County Transit District (NCTD)\n\nThe Port of San Diego\n\n[edit]\n\nEmbarcadero (San Diego)\n\nAirports\n\n[edit]\n\nCarlsbad\n\n[edit]\n\nMcClellan-Palomar Airport (CRQ) a.k.a.

reservations\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Diego County has 18 federally recognized Indian reservations, more than any other county in the United States.[127] Although they are typical in size to other Indian reservations in California (many of which are termed \"Rancherías\"), they are relatively small by national standards,[citation needed] and all together total 200.2 sq mi (519 km2) of area.\n\nPopulation ranking\n\n[edit]\n\nThe population ranking of the following table is based on the 2020 census of San Diego County.[128][129]\n\n† county seat\n\nRank City/Town/etc. Municipal type

formed\n\nFuture and past incorporation efforts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe communities of Del Dios, Elfin Forest, Harmony Grove, and Pala were newly-designated as CDPs in the 2020 census.[152]\n\nSome CDPs and unincorporated communities of San Diego County have explored incorporating as cities/towns in the past (California makes no legal distinction between the titles of \"city\" and \"town\", allowing communities that incorporate to chose their designation,[153] though there has never been an incorporated town in San Diego County). Alpine, Bonita, Fallbrook, Lakeside, Ramona, Rancho Santa Fe and Spring Valley have each been tied to various incorporation studies, organized efforts and discussions in the past.[154][155] Some of these past efforts have culminated in ballot initiatives. Voters in Fallbrook previously rejected incorporation in 1981 and 1987.[156] Rancho Santa Fe residents also rejected incorporation in 1987.[157] Among the existing cities of San Diego County, some had multiple failed incorporation efforts before ultimately succeeding in becoming a city. Lemon Grove, for example, saw incorporation measures fail in 1955, 1958 and 1964 before a successful incorporation vote in 1977.[158] Other cities have seen incorporation success thanks to mergers of neighboring unincorporated communities. Encinitas, for example, became an incorporated city through a consolidated effort between the then-unincorporated communities of Cardiff-by-the-Sea, Leucadia, Encinitas and Olivenhain in 1986.[159] Encinitas and Solana Beach in 1986 are the most recent examples of successful campaigns for incorporation within the County of San Diego.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCalifornia portal\n\nList of breweries in San Diego County, California\n\nList of high schools in San Diego County, California\n\nList of media set in San Diego County, California\n\nList of museums in San Diego County, California\n\nList of school districts in San Diego County, California\n\nList of United States counties and county-equivalents\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in San Diego County, California\n\nSan Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG)\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nPryde, Philip R.
