        "text": "The Sussex County Sports Hall of Fame - History\n\nThe Sussex County Sports Hall of Fame was founded in 1976 based on the efforts of Joe Bigg to honor County athletes, coaches and benefactors who had distinguished themselves through outstanding, extraordinary and exceptional performance in their chosen sport. Bigg was the organization's first President, and was elected as an Honorary Inductee in 1985 in recognition of his contributions to the SCSHOF. Others who played a role in the startup of the SCSHOF included John Zamos, Dick Celli, Dick Cassels, Gene Conquy, Ron Earl, Art Disque, Doc Ayers and others.\n\nIn its first year the SCSHOF elected six athletes as the Charter SCSHOF Class: Doc Ayers, Frank Chapot, Frank Christian, Gene Conquy, Major Jack Glynn, Stephen Nagy. Since 1976 the SCSHOF has inducted over 166 Sussex County athletes, coaches and benefactors representing a wide range of sports. The first women inducted into the SCSHOF was Linda Cordes of Newton in 1989. Since then, sixteen women have been inducted.\n\nThe SCSHOF is a non-profit organization supported by membership dues and other contributions. Every year the SCSHOF accepts the nominations of new athletes, coaches and benefactors to be considered for and voted on by the membership for induction. A ceremony dinner is held annually in November to introduce the new inductee and celebrate their election to the Sussex County Sports Hall of Fame."
