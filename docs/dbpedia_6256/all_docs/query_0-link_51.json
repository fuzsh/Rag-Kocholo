Walt Disney Animation's “ Raya and the Last Dragon ” earned an estimated $8.6 million from 2,045 locations in North America. AdWarner Bros. “Tom & Jerry,” which is available to stream free for HBO Max subscribers, brought in $6.6 million from 2,563 North American theaters in its second available weekend. Many areas in North America are not yet fully open, including Los Angeles, and most California counties, Washington D.C., and much of Canada.\n\nFILE - Paris Hilton arrives at the InStyle and Warner Bros. Golden Globes afterparty on Jan. 5, 2020, in Beverly Hills, Calif. Hilton announced her engagement to entrepreneur Carter Reum in her social media post on Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021, the same day as her birthday. (Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File)LOS ANGELES – Paris Hilton received a special gift for her 40th birthday: an engagement. Hilton announced her engagement to entrepreneur Carter Reum in her social media post on Wednesday — the same day as her birthday. She said the proposal was followed by a celebration with family and close friends. Hilton shared a series of photos with her wearing a white dress and crown, while 40-year-old Reum sported an all-white suit.\n\nChristopher Nolan, one of Warner Bros.’ most important filmmakers, has come out strongly against the company’s decision to debut its films on HBO Max and in theaters in 2021. The “Tenet” filmmaker told The Associated Press Monday that it’s not a good business decision and criticized how the company handled it. “I’ve never seen everybody so upset about one particular decision,” Nolan said. And it’s not a good business decision,\" Nolan said. With major markets like Los Angeles and New York closed, domestic ticket sales fizzled, and Warner Bros. and other studios responded by delaying the year’s remaining major films.\n\nThis image released by DreamWorks shows a scene from the animated film \"The Croods: A New Age.\" “The Croods: A New Age” is expected to shift to the home before Christmas for a $20 rental. “The Croods: A New Age” grossed $9.7 million Friday-Sunday, which rivals even the weekend start for “Tenet” in September. Most have tapped out around $4 million on opening weekend. One of the biggest differences is that Universal spent more heavily to market the $65 million “Croods” sequel from DreamWorks Animation.\n\n“Wonder Woman 1984” isn’t skipping theaters or moving to 2021, but it is altering course. After the first month for free on HBO Max, “Wonder Woman 1984” will play in theaters for an additional few weeks before being made available for rental on demand. Warner Bros. also sent its next big film, “The Witches” straight to HBO Max, which parent company Warner Media launched earlier this year. “Wonder Woman 1984” is a major tentpole for Warner Bros. Is it possible for that to happen again this Christmas with Wonder Woman 1984 between theaters and HBO Max?” Killar wrote Wednesday.\n\nROYAL OAK, Mich. – Anne Hathaway apologized on Instagram Thursday for how her role in the HBO movie “The Witches” could hurt children with limb differences. The apology featured a video from the Lucky Fin Project, a Metro Detroit nonprofit started by Molly Stapleman after her daughter Ryan was born missing fingers on her right hand in 2007. “It really hurt my heart as a parent of a child is born with less than 10 fingers. “As someone who really believes in inclusivity and really, really detests cruelty, I owe you all an apology for the pain caused,” Hathaway posted on Instagram. “Especially right now.”Ryan said she wants everyone to know about her “lucky fin\" and anyone else with a difference.\n\nNEW YORK – After several months in pandemic-altered theaters, Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” will head to home release on Dec. 15, Warner Bros. said Thursday. Contending with limited capacity regulations and theaters that remained closed in some states, the Warner Bros. release has so far grossed $53.8 million at the U.S. and Canadian box office. In its ninth week of release in the U.S., “Tenet” grossed $885,000 in 1,601 locations last weekend. But following the release of “Tenet,\" along with rising virus cases in the U.S. and Europe, other big-budget releases moved out of 2020. Warner Bros. didn’t announce on-demand or streaming plans for “Tenet.”More: Entertainment News\n\nThe Robert Zemeckis adaptation of “Roald Dahl’s The Witches” has found a new home on HBO Max this month just in time for Halloween. Warner Bros. said Friday that “The Witches” will debut on the subscription streaming service, owned by parent company WarnerMedia, on Oct. 22. Dahl’s 1983 novel about an orphaned boy who discovers a coven of witches that hate children was previously adapted for the big screen in 1990 by director Nicolas Roeg. It starred Angelica Huston, Mai Zetterling and Rowan Atkinson and was a box office flop, despite its critical acclaim. This new version has actor Jahzir Bruno playing the boy who must try to stop the witches from turning the world's children into mice.\n\nThe U.K. production of “The Batman” is starting up again after being shut down earlier this month when an individual tested positive for COVID-19. A spokesperson for Warner Bros. said Thursday that filming had resumed after a hiatus for quarantine precautions. Robert Pattinson stars in the film from director Matt Reeves which had been on hiatus for almost six months because of the coronavirus pandemic. The positive case came just three days after “The Batman” had initially resumed shooting. “The Batman” was originally supposed to hit theaters in June 2021 but was pushed back to October 2021 because of the delays.\n\nNEW YORK – Following the less-than-stellar theatrical debut of Christopher Nolan's “Tenet,” Warner Bros. is delaying its next big release, “Wonder Woman 1984,\" to Christmas. The postponement of the “Wonder Woman” sequel, which had been scheduled to hit theaters Oct. 2, comes on the heels of Hollywood's strongest attempt to lure moviegoers back to theaters during the pandemic. Warner Bros.' $200 million “Tenet\" fared well in its international-first release, but found ticket sales harder to come by in the United States. The “Wonder Woman 1984” postponement suggests Hollywood's fall may go little better than its summer. “Wonder Woman 1984,” one of many blockbusters originally set for the summer, had been the next big-budget release on the calendar.\n\nLOS ANGELES Ellen DeGeneres says she'll be ready to talk when her daytime show returns this month after a staff shake-up prompted by allegations of a toxic workplace. And, yes, were gonna talk about it, DeGeneres said in a statement announcing the show's Sept. 21 start of its 18th season. Tiffany Haddish will join DeGeneres for the kick-off episode, with The Ellen DeGeneres Show to be taped at Warner Bros. minus an in-studio audience, which is commonplace during the pandemic. Stephen tWitch Boss, a longtime guest DJ on the show and among those who have publicly supported DeGeneres, will guest host some fall episodes. Last month, three of the show's producers exited amid allegations of a dysfunctional workplace that harbored misbehavior including sexual misconduct and racially insensitive remarks.\n\nNEW YORK In a litmus test for American moviegoing in the pandemic, Christopher Nolan's Tenet brought in an estimated $20.2 million through the holiday weekend in U.S. and Canadian theaters. Theaters in Canada, where COVID-19 cases are much lower than in the U.S., began showing Tenet a week earlier. In two weeks of release, its overseas total is $126 million, with a global tally thus far of $146.2 million. The film, which cost $200 million to make and at least $100 million to market, will need to get close to $500 million to break even. Disney's The New Mutants,\" a long delayed X-Men spinoff, collected about $7 million in 2,412 locations last weekend.\n\nSome U.S. moviegoers will be able to see Christopher Nolans Tenet a few days early. Warner Bros. on Tuesday said that it would be offering early access screenings starting Aug. 31 as a gesture of support to the domestic theaters that are reopening after five months of being closed because of COVID-19. Tenet is the first major new Hollywood movie to be released in theaters since most locations shuttered in mid-March. Warner Bros. is proud to support our partners in exhibition as they reopen their doors, said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros. president of domestic distribution, in a written statement. Early domestic screenings of Tenet will be scheduled on the evenings of Aug. 21, Sept. 1 and Sept. 2 where theaters are open in the U.S. Tickets go on sale Friday.\n\nLOS ANGELES With reported cases of the coronavirus surging, Warner Bros. on Thursday postponed the release of Christopher Nolans Tenet, further delaying Hollywood's summer kickoff. The sci-fi thriller starring John David Washington and Robert Pattinson will move from July 31 to Aug. 12, a Wednesday. Movie theaters had been pinning their hopes on the film as a major July release that could bring audiences back to theaters. Warner Bros. had planned to re-release Nolan's 2010 blockbuster Inception in early July as a way to lead in to Tenet.\" Inception will now open on July 31, the studio said.\n\nLOS ANGELES Comic-Con may be canceled this year, but Warner Bros. will convene a 24-hour virtual gathering of the biggest names in the DC Comics universe. The studio announced Tuesday that DC FanDome will be held on August 22 starting at 10 a.m. PDT. The event will feature talent announcements and reveal new content from WB games, comics, film and television. The announcement comes a couple months after Comic-Con, which attracts tens of thousands of comics fans to San Diego, was canceled due to the coronavirus-related restrictions around large gatherings. FanDome will be spread out across six different areas on the event's website: Hall of Heroes, DC WatchVerse, DC YouVerse, DC KidsVerse, DC InsiderVerse and DC FunVerse.\n\nAMC Theaters, the world's largest theater operator, said Tuesday that it expects to have 97-98% of its theaters worldwide reopened by mid-July. It will be up to movie theater operators to convince moviegoers that its safe to once again sit in the dark among strangers. Only recently have state guidelines allowed the reopening of theaters in California (including in the countrys top market, Los Angeles, where local officials have yet to agree). Before Tenet arrives, theaters will play just as those that are currently open are showing recent and classic catalog offerings. Though a handful of movies have been steered to streaming or on-demand platforms during the pandemic, most studio films have been postponed until theaters reopen.\n\nNEW YORK The 2019 film Just Mercy, which chronicles courtroom struggles against racial injustice and mass incarceration, will be made free on digital platforms throughout June in the wake of George Floyd's death, Warner Bros. said Tuesday. In the film, Michael B. Jordan plays attorney Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, who helps a character played by Jamie Foxx. We believe in the power of story, Warner Bros. said. The rider was initiated as a way to change long-term under-representation of people of color and women in Hollywood. Recent studies have shown that films like Just Mercy are starting to reshape the film industry.\n\nThe move comes as Disney Plus seems to be an instant hit. Other Disney movies with the disclaimer include The Jungle Book and Swiss Family Robinson.Pocahontas and Aladdin do not have it, despite rumblings by some that those films contain stereotypes, too. It isnt included in Disney Plus, either. Sonny Skyhawk, an actor and producer who created the group American Indians in Film and Television, found the two-sentence disclaimer lacking. What would serve minority groups better than any disclaimer is simply offering them opportunities to tell their own stories on a platform like Disney Plus, Skyhawk said.\n\nIn this photo released by Warner Bros., talk show host Ellen DeGeneres is seen during a taping of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" at the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, Calif. (Photo by Michael Rozman/Warner Bros.)Howard Stern makes his very first appearance on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" airing today, at 3 p.m.For his debut, the world-renowned radio host suggests that he and Ellen create a controversial photo that will get everyone talking. During this new episode, Ellen admits she was \"scared to death\" of Howard at the start of her career and the shock jock then shares how moved he was by Ellen's interview on \"The Howard Stern Show\" back in 2015. The \"Howard Stern Comes Again\" author also tells Ellen about hosting Seth Rogen and Snoop Dogg on his radio show to educate his staff about marijuana and calls them the \"Cheech and Chong\" of their generation. Since she unexpectedly said yes and ruined the bit, Ellen sets up an impromptu vow renewal officiated by former \"Bachelor\" star Colton Underwood. Don't miss Howard Stern on Ellen today at 3 p.m. on Local 4!\n\n(CNN) - \"Joker\" broke box office records this weekend, even as its controversial depiction of violence made some potential theatergoers anxious. \"Joker\" is the largest opening for Warner Bros. this year as well as one of the biggest openings for a R-rated film. \"Warner Bros. believes that one of the functions of storytelling is to provoke difficult conversations around complex issues,\" a statement from the studio said last month. The record-setting box office performance from \"Joker\" is great news for Hollywood, which could use more hits as the year goes on. The domestic box office is down roughly 5% compared to last year, but there are many potential blockbusters still on the schedule.\n\nA California movie theater showing the film Joker shuttered its doors after receiving what police called a credible threat, officials said. Moviegoers planning to see Joaquin Phoenixs controversial film at the Century Huntington Beach and XD Theater in the Bella Terra shopping center Thursday instead found a closed theater surrounded by police. We took the threat seriously, and were investigating, Officer Angela Bennett, a spokeswoman for the Huntington Beach Police Department, told the Times. The FBI and U.S. Army also issued internal warnings about possible threats related to the movie. In 2012, a gunman killed 12 people after opening fire during a screening of the Batman film The Dark Knight Rises at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado.\n\n(CNN) - The \"Joker\" hit movie theaters this week despite a wave of criticism that it glorifies a killer and could encourage copycat attacks nationwide.
