        "text": "Rox manager Chris Carminucci did not like one tendency his team developed in its recent road trip.\n\nDuring a seven-game trip, the Rox started a bad habit of letting the other team score first.\n\nThat trend continued in their first game back at home, the opener of a four-game series on Friday night.\n\nThe Sussex Skyhawks not only scored first, but they denied Brockton’s comeback attempt with a 7-5 win in 10 innings before 3,303 fans at Campanelli Stadium.\n\n“We have been falling behind in games,” said Carminucci, “but we keep battling back.\n\n“We have been close enough to win games, but we’ve just got to execute better.”\n\nThe Rox had a chance to tie the game in the bottom of the 10th inning as Phillip Cuadrado, who just got off the plane after returning from the tournament he played in Central America, ripped a double to center to give Brockton runners on second and third with two outs.\n\nSussex’s fifth pitcher of the night, Matt Salvato, struck out Dominic Ramos (two hits and a run scored) to end the game.\n\n“You have to realize,” said Sussex manager Ed Ott. “These are two good ball clubs that are playing. We are not going to quit and they are not going to quit.\n\n“Both teams are struggling right now, but both of us are going to get hot sooner or later.”\n\nThe Rox battled back from a 5-1 seventh-inning deficit to tie the game, 5-5, in the ninth inning on a two-run single by their new leadoff hitter, Keith Brachold.\n\nHe was moved to the leadoff spot because of a hamstring injury to the Rox normal leadoff hitter, Scott Wearne, which kept him out of the lineup.\n\nSussex responded with two runs off Colin Lynch in the 10th inning. The Skyhawks loaded the bases with two outs and Nick Giarraputo, who was hitless in the game, looped a single to score both Chase Fontaine (three hits) and Ryan Boeslen to give Sussex the 7-5 lead.\n\nThe Skyhawks, who are last in the Can-Am League in home runs, used the long ball as their main weapon to go up, 5-1.\n\nCaleb Stewart hit a solo homer in the fourth inning, Boeslen added a two-run homer in the sixth inning and Joe Persichina drilled a solo homer in the eighth for the Skyhawks.\n\nSussex added an unearned run in the eighth inning to go up, 5-1.\n\n“Wayne Lundgren pitched well,” said Carminucci. “The home runs were not exactly long hit balls off of him. He pitched well enough to win the game. He will be all right, Wayne has been hurt by the home run ball lately.”\n\n“In this ball park,” said Ott. “any one can play power ball. This is the kind of ballpark where a pitcher has to concentrate on each pitch. There were some balls that were home runs here that would be outs in our park.”\n\nBrockton started its comeback in the bottom of the eighth by loading the bases with no one out.\n\nChris Grossman hit into a round-the-horn double play to score Brachold, and Conroy slapped a single up the middle to score Shawn Williams to bring the Rox to within 5-3.\n\nWilliams released: The Rox released veteran Clyde Williams. The first baseman/designated-hitter was hitting .207 with five homers and 22 RBI in 48 games this year.\n\n“It was one of the toughest decisions that I have had to make,’’ said Carminucci. “He is a friend of mine. He understands the procedure. Clyde wasn’t happy, but he had nearly 200 at-bats this year. I do know one thing that he will do great things in his life.”"
