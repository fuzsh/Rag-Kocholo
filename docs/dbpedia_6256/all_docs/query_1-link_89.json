        "text": "May 25, 2008 - Canadian American League (Can-Am)\n\nSussex Skyhawks News Release\n\nAUGUSTA, N.J. - The Worcester Tornadoes scored six runs in the first two frames and never looked back en route to a 13-5 victory over the Sussex Skyhawks in the final game of the season-opening series at Skylands Park. Worcester improves to 3-1, while the Skyhawks fall to 1-3 in the Can-Am League.\n\nWorcester starter Eddie Pena (1-0) worked the minimum five innings to earn his first victory of the season. Pena gave up six hits and four runs; however only two of those runs were earned.\n\nAlex Beras threw three scoreless innings of relief for Worcester to quiet any thought of a Sussex comeback. Dave Wasylak came in gave up one run in the ninth inning for the Tornadoes.\n\nWorcester featured a balanced offensive attack, sparked by first baseman Chris Colabello, who went 2-for-6 with four RBI. Catcher Alex Trezza finished 2-for-5 and hit his second home run of the season.\n\nDesignated hitter Walter Young was a bright spot for Sussex, going 2-for-5 with an RBI.\n\nWorcester jumped out early on Sussex starter Edysbel Benitez (0-1) when leadoff hitter Scott Grimes tripled off the wall in right center to start the game. Grimes scored on a Chris Colabello fielders' choice. Trezza came up next and drilled his second home run of the season, a two-run shot to give the Tornadoes an early 3-0 lead.\n\nThe Tornadoes added three more runs in the second, highlighted by Colabello's broken-bat, two-run single to left.\n\nWorcester knocked Benitez out of the game in the fourth when they scored four more runs, two of which came home on Rico Santana's two-run single. That gave the Tornadoes a commanding 10-0 lead.\n\nBenitez threw 3.2 innings, giving up 10 runs (6 earned) on six hits. Craig Snipp threw 4.1 innings in relief for the Skyhawks giving up just one unearned run.\n\nSussex got on the board in the bottom of the fourth when designated hitter Walter Young led off with a single, and Alex Frazier followed with a double moving Young to third. Young and Frazier scored when Worcester shortstop Chuck Jeroloman couldn't handle a ground ball by Sussex's Matt Weston, making the score 10-2. Sussex added two more runs in the fifth and one in the ninth.\n\nWorcester returns to action Tuesday at Nashua for a 7:05 p.m. game. The Skyhawks' next game is Monday at Brockton. Game time is set for 6:05 p.m.\n\nThe Skyhawks' next home game is Monday, June 2 against Brockton. First pitch is scheduled for 7 p.m.\n\nâ€¢ Discuss this story on the Canadian American League message board...\n\nCanadian American League Stories from May 25, 2008\n\nTornadoes Crush Skyhawks, Take Three Of Four In Series - Worcester Tornadoes\n\nRapidz drop opening series - Ottawa Voyageurs\n\nTornadoes Take 13-5 Win And Opening Series From Sussex Skyhawks - Sussex Skyhawks\n\nPride Held Back by Brockton Pitching; 2-1 - American Defenders of New Hampshire\n\nCan-Am League Recap - Can-Am\n\nAtlantic City Runs Past Quebec 9-6, Earns Series Split - Atlantic City Surf\n\nJackals Take Season-Opening Series With 15-6 Win Over Ottawa - New Jersey Jackals\n\nDone Hurls Six Shutout Innings As Jackals Down Rapidz - Can-Am"
