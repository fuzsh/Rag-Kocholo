        "text": "Local Baseball Executive Joins \\'Go By Bike' Initiative\n\nMay 7, 2009 - Canadian American League (Can-Am)\n\nSussex Skyhawks News Release\n\nLittle Falls, NJ - Across the country, May is recognized as National Bike Month, a time when everyone is encouraged to enhance their health and the environment by riding bicycles. Cycle Craft, a Parsippany-based bicycle retailer, will be rewarding people who choose to ride a bike instead of getting into a car.\n\nAll throughout National Bike Month, Cycle Craft staffers will be out on the road awarding prizes to those who display the 'Go By Bike' flag -- which is free by registering at any Cycle Craft location -- on their bicycle. Everyone who registers is also eligible to win one of three grand prizes: two round-trip airline tickets anywhere in the U.S., a Trek Allant bicycle [approx. $600 value], and a family ticket package to the New Jersey Jackals baseball games at Yogi Berra Stadium on the campus of Montclair State University.\n\nThe President of the New Jersey Jackals and Sussex Skyhawks professional baseball clubs, Greg Lockard, recently became aware of National Bike Month, and immediately decided to become part of the effort. Lockard will help kick-off the initiative by participating in Bike to Work Week, which begins on Monday, May 11th and continues through May 15th.\n\nAccording to Lockard, \"This is an outstanding initiative by Cycle Craft, and is especially timely this year. I'm anxious to support the effort and hope to enhance awareness of the benefits of cycling. Our business is centered around affordable family entertainment, and cycling is a perfect fit for our fans.\"\n\nLockard will begin his Bike to Work participation on Monday, embarking on an eight-mile ride each day from his Roseland home to his office at the Floyd Hall Ice Arena, located next to Yogi Berra Stadium. After conquering that commute, Lockard plans to make the 50-mile trek to the offices of the Sussex Skyhawks later this month.\n\n\"It's been a long time since I've done this kind of ride, but I'm looking forward to getting into shape and becoming a regular bike commuter,\" said Lockard.\n\nLockard will finalize his preparations Friday, May 8th at 11:00 a.m. at Cycle Craft in Parsippany. He'll be measured for the bike fitting and make all final adjustments on Friday to prepare for Monday's commute.\n\nFor more information about National Bike Month or Bike to Work Week, visit www.cyclecraft.com.\n\n• Discuss this story on the Canadian American League message board...\n\nCanadian American League Stories from May 7, 2009\n\nLocal Baseball Executive Joins âGo By Bike' Initiative - Sussex Skyhawks"
