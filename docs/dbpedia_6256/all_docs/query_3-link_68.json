        "text": "The Brockton Rox opened an eight-game road trip in style by sweeping a doubleheader from the Sussex Skyhawks, 6-5 and 7-2, Monday night at Skylands Park.\n\nThe sweep puts the Rox (11-10) over .500 for the second half of the season, and pulling Brockton within three games of first-place Quebec.\n\nIn the opener, Brockton broke a 4-4 extra-innings tie in the top of the eighth after rallying from a 4-0 deficit when Chris Grossman hit a two-run, bases-loaded single with two outs, scoring Philip Cuadrado and Keith Brachold to give the Rox a 6-4 lead.\n\nSussex got one run back in the bottom of the eighth, but it was not enough.\n\nSteve Delabar threw 12/3 innings of relief to get the win for Brockton, improving his record to 3-3, and Gerry Dunn earned his 17th save of the season after closing out the eighth.\n\nSussex’ Sandy Nin gave up two unearned runs, but still received the loss, his sixth of the season.\n\nRox starting pitcher Craig Anderson allowed four runs over 31/3 innings before turning the game over to the Brockton bullpen.\n\nIn the nightcap, Sussex made it easy on the Rox, committing five errors to gift-wrap the win.\n\nChris Valencia went 2-for-3 with two runs scored and an RBI and Melvin Falu rocketed a two-run homer in the third to lead the Rox offensively. It was Falu’s fifth homer of the season.\n\nBuster Lussier earned the win for Brockton, pitching five innings of four-hit ball and allowing one earned run. Lussier improved to 3-0.\n\nBrad Hertzler and Matt Zachary recorded the final six outs for the Rox. Their efforts ended a great day for the Brockton bullpen, which allowed just one run over 42/3 innings.\n\nTim Stringer pitched four innings, allowing six runs, three of them earned, to get the loss for Sussex, his first decision of the season.\n\nSussex and Brockton will continue the series tonight at 7:05 as Jeff Long (3-4) will get the start for the Rox, while Mike Schellinger (4-5) will deal for the Skyhawks."
