We’re told the larger issues have been with Millennium Sports over the terms of a lease, not with the sale itself. There’s also the strong possibility the SkyHawks may become a travel team for the 2011 season if a lease cannot be worked out.\n\nWe’re also told this Facebook posting on the official SkyHawks page is more than a little overwrought: there are several moving pieces in setting out a Can-Am League schedule for 2011, including the uncertain state of a Ramapo team and some questions about at least one more team. No official decision has been made about the status of the team for 2011, though we’re obviously close to crunch time.\n\nShare your news with the baseball community.
