        "text": "Professional baseball is coming back to Sussex County.\n\nThe new owners of Skylands Stadium in Augusta announced Wednesday that they have established a new minor-league team — appropriately dubbed the Sussex County Miners — that will begin play in the independent Can-Am Association of Professional Baseball.\n\nThe team's name does not refer to its minor-league status, but rather the Sussex County-northwest New Jersey history of numerous iron and zinc mines. The logo includes a miner's pickaxe.\n\nSkylands Stadium led the revival of minor-league baseball in New Jersey when it opened in 1994 as the home of the Major League Baseball-affiliated Sussex Cardinals. The Cardinals played at the 4,200-seat venue until the team was sold and moved in 2005. An independent minor-league team, the Sussex Skyhawks, played there from 2006 to 2010.\n\nVeteran professional baseball executive Dave Chase has been hired to run the new baseball program, which will play 55 home games between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Opening day is scheduled for May 25.\n\n\"We are thrilled to be unveiling the Sussex County Miners, their team colors and new general manager Dave Chase to baseball fans and the community,\" said Al Dorso Sr., president of Skylands Stadium and the Miners. \"Our goal is to offer baseball lovers excitement and a high caliber of competitive play close to home, with lots of wins. Dave Chase is just the man to offer fans a great day out at the baseball park.\"\n\nThe Can-Am Association, which dates back to 1936, includes a natural rival for the Miners — the Jersey Jackals, who play at Montclair State University.\n\n\"The New Jersey Jackals would like to officially welcome the Sussex County Miners to the Can-Am League!\" the Jackals posted on their Facebook page. \"We are looking forward to a great rivalry with a fellow New Jersey team.\"\n\nJackals President Gregory Lockhard said his entire organization, which has been in the league for 18 years, is looking forward to having another New Jersey team to play.\n\n\"We are very excited about this,\" he said. \"They have a great venue, great ownership and we think it's going to be great having them in the league.\"\n\nOther teams in the league include the Rockland Boulders from Pomona, N.Y., and three teams from Canada — the Ottowa Champions, the Quebec Les Capitales and the Trois Rivieres Aigles.\n\nOttowa is managed by Hal Lanier, the former New York Yankee infielder who went on to greater major-league fame as manager of the Houston Astros and 1986 National League Manager of the Year.\n\n\"Our goal is to create a comfortable, safe environment for multiple generations of families to enjoy the fun and joy of watching live competitive baseball,\" said Chase, who spent 35 years working for several baseball organizations and previously worked as president and publisher of Baseball America magazine. \"With this new team, we are laying the foundations for a brilliant future for baseball in Sussex County.\"\n\nStaff Writer William Westhoven: 973-428-6627; wwesthoven@dailyrecord.com."
