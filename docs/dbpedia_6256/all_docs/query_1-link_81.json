        "text": "Sussex’s Mike Vicaro made his first appearance of the season last night.\n\nIt’s one the right-hander will remember for quite some time.\n\nThe 26-year-old Randolph, N.J., native, who pitched in only one game in 2009, looked to be in midseason form, however. The 6-foot, 185-pound Vicaro gave the Skyhawks more than they could have hoped with six strong innings of two-run ball en route to an 11-4 win over the Tornadoes last night in front of a sellout crowd at Hanover Insurance Park at Fitton Field.\n\n“He’s just a guy that throw strikes,” Worcester third baseman Chris Colabello said. “He got ahead of a lot of guys, and certainly having the offense behind him helped him out quite a bit. You’ve got to tip your cap to him.”\n\nVicaro gave up six hits and two walks while fanning five for the victory.\n\nThe Skyhawks raced out to a 3-0 lead in the first inning off Worcester starter Matt McDonald, who had given up two earned runs or less in four of his five starts entering last night. McDonald surrendered Kris Sanchez’s two-run double down the right-field line and Ryan Boelsen’s RBI groundout.\n\nNew addition Ryan Crespi, signed by Worcester on Tuesday, continued to deliver for the Tornadoes. The outfielder drilled a 3-2 fastball off Vicaro deep over the fence in left to cut the deficit to 3-1.\n\nCrespi, who played for Sussex last season, is batting .467 with two home runs in five games for Worcester.\n\nThe Skyhawks came right back in the fourth, as McDonald walked Nick Giarraputo and leadoff hitter Kraig Binick unloaded on a two-run shot for a 5-1 advantage.\n\nMcDonald left the game in the fifth after serving up back-to-back scorching doubles to Sanchez and Boelsen. The right-hander was escorted to the dugout by the trainer with an apparent arm injury and was replaced on the hill by southpaw Zach Zuercher.\n\nIn his worst outing of the season by far, McDonald yielded seven runs — six earned — on nine hits with two walks and two strikeouts in four innings.\n\nThe name Zuercher should be familiar to the Worcester faithful, as the lefty went 7-5 last season with a 3.53 ERA with the Tornadoes.\n\nThe Warwick, R.I., native got Joe Persichina to pop out to the catcher for the first out, but the rust was evident as Kade Keowen hit a two-run homer to right-center. Zuercher also gave up three runs in the eighth — keyed by four straight hits, including a homer by Chase Fontaine.\n\nColabello singled to left and scampered home on Mark Minicozzi’s RBI double to right-center in the sixth.\n\nMinicozzi was 3 for 4.\n\nBilly Cather extended his hitting streak to nine games with a single in the eighth. Colabello drove him in with a towering two-run, no-doubt-about-it homer to left off Sussex reliever Mike Streaman."
