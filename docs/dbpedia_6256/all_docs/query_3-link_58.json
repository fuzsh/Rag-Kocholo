        "text": "Thursday night’s Can-Am League opener with the Sussex Skyhawks at Campanelli Stadium marked the beginning of Rox bench coach Ed Nottle’s second stint in Brockton.\n\nIt also marked the start of his 49th season in professional baseball.\n\nAt 69 years of age, Nottle is just one year shy of his golden anniversary in the game.\n\n“This is the only thing I’ve ever done and coming back and getting on the field in Brockton makes me appreciative, not only of Van (Schley, the team’s principal owner) but (manager Chris) Carminucci,” said Nottle, who served as the team’s original skipper from 2002 through 2005, a span that included the franchise’s lone championship season (2003 in the Northeast League). “He’s been a good friend and I know he went to bat big time for me, so that means a lot to me.”\n\nNottle broke into professional baseball as a pitcher in the Class D Alabama-Florida League, signing on with Pensacola as a free agent in 1959 and making his debut with the team in 1960.\n\n“I remember I made 225 a month, but I had a pretty good year and the Chicago White Sox bought my contract and the next year I was on a big league roster,” said Nottle. “So it was a great break for me.”\n\nSince then, Nottle’s lone season out of professional baseball was 1991, after he was fired as the manager of the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox the previous June.\n\n“I ended up going home to Evansville and managing a local, intercity high school team, and we got to the championship,” said Nottle. “It was the first time I ever went to high school. Next winter was when they started independent ball. Independent ball saved my butt.”\n\nNow, Carminucci looks for Nottle, who last year was hired and fired as manager of the now-defunct Ottawa Rapidz of the Can-Am League, to assist him on the bench.\n\n“I’ve got 50 years of professional baseball sitting next to me,” said Carminucci, the Rox first-year manager who had previous stints with the Traveling Grays, the St. Joe Blacksnakes and the Atlantic City Surf. “As a manager, anytime that you can ask somebody with as much baseball knowledge, somebody I respect … And I’ve always believed that somebody that kicks your tail, you get him on your side.\n\n“As a young manager, Ed Nottle taught me how to manage. Just managing against him he always did a tremendous job and I always had the utmost respect for him. One of my key things was bringing him in and having him to help me out and have his knowledge with these young boys.”\n\nNottle is continuing a career that began countless years and miles ago in Pensacola.\n\n“That was a lot of springs ago, plus a lot of bus rides and a lot of plane rides,” said Nottle. “I could have ended up roofing houses. Instead, I’ve had a fun life.”\n\nA four score:\n\nThursday night’s 6-1 loss was the Rox first of four games in this season-opening series with Hal Lanier and his reigning league champs.\n\nThe Skyhawks will send left-hander Roger Lincoln (1-1, 4.67 with Sussex last season) to the mound against player-pitching coach John Kelly (the right-hander went 9-5, 2.56 with Brockton last year) at 7:05 tonight.\n\nRight-handed starters will rule the rest of the weekend as Justin Knoff (3-1, 3.74) is set to oppose Stevie Delabar (3-3, 3.01 with Brockton last year) at 6:05 Saturday night and T.J. Stanton (6-4, 3.90 with Quebec last season) is due to face Jeff Long (9-4, 3.83 with Kalamazoo in the Frontier League last year) in the series finale at 1:05 Sunday afternoon."
