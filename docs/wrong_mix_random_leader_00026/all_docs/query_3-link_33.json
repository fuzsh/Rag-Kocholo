Our region brings together two dynamic states and one mighty river in a Midwestern sweet spot of industry and creativity. Our river is a stage for downtown lives, a port for river cruises, and a backdrop to bike rides, long walks and picnics. In the QC, we are building on the legacy of John Deere, a global giant that remains deeply rooted here and the genesis for countless spinoffs and innovators.\n\nThe Quad Cities Chamber is dedicated to growing our businesses and our economy. Through our economic development and placemaking efforts we are helping create a region where people feel welcome and want to work.\n\nThe Quad Cities is eager to welcome you to a place like no other to call home."
