        "text": "A new music festival is set to take over downtown Davenport in February.\n\nThe event, coined \"Daytrotter Downs,\" is curated by Daytrotter, the Quad Cities-based music discovery platform known for recording live sessions of artists ranging in genre and popularity. It's set to take place Feb. 18 to 20, with 25 to 30 acts performing across three venues in the eastern Iowa city.\n\nDescribed in The Atlantic as the place \"where good music gets saved,\" Daytrotter has carved a name for itself as a source for finding new music. The site hosts a deep catalog of live sessions, from household names such as of Mumford & Sons and 80/35 alum Wilco to notable up-and-coming acts such as experimental pop artist Grimes and punk rock quintet PUP.\n\nDaytrotter founder Sean Moeller said, with the newly announced event, he wants to create a festival for music discovery.\n\n\"It’s about the excitement of finding (artists) before everybody else,\" Moeller said. \"The fun factor of being able to say you saw the next Kanye West in a 300- to 400-person venue in Davenport, Iowa. … I like that a lot. I like that possibility a lot.”\n\nMoeller said he wants Daytrotter Downs to be a festival that's intimate and easy to navigate — a festival people attend because the artists performing have a chance of becoming household names.\n\nRELATED: In college?

The lineup is to be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nTickets to Daytrotter Downs are on sale now for $64.29. Find more information on tickets at eventbrite.com."
