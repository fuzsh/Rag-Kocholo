        "text": "Q: So what’s this Alternating Currents festival all about?\n\nMusic. Film. Comedy. Art. - On Aug 21 - 25, downtown Davenport, IA will be brimming with energy as nearly two dozen venues host a wide variety of original live music, film screenings, comedians, and visual artists.\n\nCheck out over 100+ PERFORMANCES & EVENTS at 20+ VENUES! You're encouraged to travel from venue to venue and explore all downtown has to offer. The festival is located in the heart of Downtown Davenport, Iowa where you’ll find dozens of restaurants, shops, bars and more beyond our official venues. For more information about downtown, click here.\n\n​\n\nThe Downtown Davenport Partnership is hosting this festival for a variety of reasons; it gives us a chance to highlight our incredible cultural scene while also building-up the local businesses that make our downtown unique. We're big fans of the Quad Cities; we couldn't think of a better way showcase this amazing gem on the Mississippi River to the world.\n\nQ: How does admission work; is some of this FREE?\n\nYes! The only ticketed venues are Adler Theatre, Redstone Room at River Music Experience, Triple Crown Whiskey Bar & Raccoon Motel, and the Exit Realty Fireside Garage.\n\n​\n\nAll the other venues and events are FREE!\n\n(lone exception being Friday night's vinyl record sale at RiverCenter)\n\nThere are two tickets associated with Alternating Currents; the ticket for the Adler Theatre show, and the Weekend Pass that gets you entry and priority access to the 3 other venues we just mentioned.\n\nThe Weekend Pass is only $15 in advance and provides entry to EVERY SHOW ALL WEEKEND (other than the Adler). Weekend pass will be $20 day of show and available at each paid venue. No doubt you should buy it if you’re wandering downtown all weekend. We will also be selling weekend passes during the event.\n\nAgain, all other venues beyond these are FREE all weekend.\n\n​\n\nQ: What does “priority access” with Weekend Pass mean?\n\n“Priority Access” with a Weekend Pass means if you show up to a ticketed-venue and the place is already at capacity, you get first dibs for entry as a patron leaves the venue via a separate line. We also open up venues early for ticket holders. It’s the same model South by Southwest (SXSW) festival has used for years. With so many events across downtown though, you can always bounce to another show or event if you don’t feel like waiting in line (assuming there is a line to begin with). Again, only Redstone Room at RME, Exit Realty Fireside Garage and Raccoon Motel require a door-ticket or Weekend Pass.\n\nQ: What FREE venues are participating?\n\nA: All of the following venues will be celebrating Alternating Currents so make sure you stop by!\n\n​\n\nHotel BlackHawk at Bix Bistro\n\nBucktown Center for the Arts\n\nCowork QC\n\nEICC Urban Campus\n\nFigge Art Museum/ John Deere Auditorium\n\nFreight House Farmers Market\n\nFront Street Brewery (208 E River Drive, Davenport, IA)\n\nFront Street Brewery Taproom (421 W River Dr, Davenport, IA)\n\nGreat River Brewery\n\nKilkenny’s Pub\n\nMac’s Tavern\n\nOMG Becky Fest: River Center\n\nParadigm & Analog Arcade\n\nRiver Center North (Mississippi Hall)\n\nRiver Center South (Great Hall)\n\nRiver Center Lawn (2nd Street – across from Barrel House)\n\nRiver Music Experience\n\nRME Courtyard\n\nRME Redstone Room\n\nRuby’s\n\nStarDog Gallery\n\nUP Skybar at The Current\n\n​\n\nPAID VENUES:\n\nAdler Theater\n\nTriple Crown Whiskey Bar & Raccoon Motel\n\nEXIT Realty Garage (221 E 2nd St, Davenport, IA)\n\n​\n\nQ: Hold on, I’m still not sure I get it?\n\nWe understand; it’s a new concept around here. Just show up downtown! We promise; it’s really pretty simple (and fun!) Basically, you’re going to be bouncing around checking out cool stuff while grabbing food and drinks along the way. Roam. Wander. Check out a show for 15 minutes, then check out one you love for an hour. It all makes sense once you experience it. So make it your own, and check out a little bit of everything on our artistic buffet.\n\n​\n\nQ: Is this event All-Ages with Kid-Friendly events?\n\nThe event is all-ages; HOWEVER, some venues are 21+, particularly in the evening. Each venue’s age-restrictions are the same as their typical rules on any normal day. We will have kids programming in the River Music Experience Courtyard, and all of our art events are kid friendly too (and there are a lot). Some movies (and many concerts) are a good fit as well, but be sure to read up on our website before you bring your kiddo to a particular movie, or gig.\n\n​\n\nQ: Where do I park?\n\nDowntown Davenport has three perfectly located parking ramps with cheap parking costs, and street parking is FREE! The RiverCenter/MidAmerican ramp can be entered off 3rd or 2nd Street. The Redstone Ramp is just behind the River Music Experience off Main Street, and the Harrison St. ramp is (you guessed it) just off of Harrison Street. Parking in the ramps is pay before you play similar to a parking meter. All three ramps have kiosks on the main floor of the ramp.\n\nClick here for more parking info and ramp locations.\n\nQ: How many years has this event been happening?\n\nThis is our 3rd year hosting Alternating Currents! We have tapped into the Quad Cities best talent to create the village that is making this festival happen.\n\nQ: Is there camping?\n\nNo.\n\nQ: Where can I get a press pass?\n\nA: We love the presence of Media and Press at the festival, please contact Jason Gilliland at jgilliland@quadcitieschamber.com for a Press Application.\n\nQ: Is it possible to record this event?\n\nA: Professional audio and video equipment is prohibited. Violations could result in confiscation of the devices and violators will be removed from the premises\n\n​\n\nComing from out of town?\n\nFirst off, THANK YOU! We're excited for you to explore our downtown scene! Getting around can sometimes be tricky in a new place, and we totally get that. With a little help from google maps and our trusty Downtown Davenport Partnership website, we've got you covered. Here are the places to stay, eat, and shop! Take pictures and share them with us by using #tagtheQC!\n\n​\n\nMORE INFO\n\n​\n\nFood and Alcohol\n\nOne of our favorite aspects of Alternating Currents is all of the love that is going back in to the downtown Davenport businesses. For food, we want you to hop in and grab a quick bite to eat at one of our restaurants or food trucks. If you're ready to party, we’ve got plenty of bars and restaurants, and many of our official venues have both food and adult beverages, too.\n\n​\n\nLost & Found\n\nPlease call 563.322.1706 after the festival if you have lost an item. We will hold items for 30 days. The Downtown Davenport Partnership will not be held liable for any items unclaimed.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nABOUT THE FESTIVAL ORGANIZER\n\n​\n\nAlternating Currents Festival was founded in Davenport in 2017.
