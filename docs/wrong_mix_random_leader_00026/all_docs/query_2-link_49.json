        "text": "Topline\n\nThe city of Davenport, Iowa, has deemed the apartment complex that collapsed Sunday too structurally unsound to allow residents back inside, and plans to demolish the property on Tuesday, as questions about the cause of the disaster remain unanswered.\n\nKey Facts\n\nKey Background\n\nAt around 5 p.m. on Sunday, the back part of the apartment complex separated from the rest of the building and collapsed. Authorities found a gas leak after the collapse, as well as water leaking through the floors of the structure, the Associated Press reported. Davenport is a small eastern Iowa city with about 100,000 residents, located across the Mississippi River from Illinois. The property, known as the Davenport, is an 80-unit apartment complex with ground-floor retail. Located at 324 Main St., the historic building was sold to an entity registered to Andrew Wold in June 2021 for $4 million, according to public records. Wold, who owns several properties in Davenport and surrounding towns, could not be reached for comment.\n\nWhat We Don’t Know\n\nThe cause of the collapse remains unknown, but residents have told media outlets they had a litany of complaints about the property, which was constructed in 1906, according to public records. Work was being done on the building’s exterior at the time of the collapse and there were reports of bricks falling off the complex earlier this week, Rich Oswald, Davenport’s director of development, said during a Sunday news conference. Tenants told the Associated Press they experienced frequent issues with plumbing, heating and air conditioning, and could rarely reach property management. Water damage was also apparent in the building, Jennifer Smith, an owner of one of the ground-floor businesses told the Des Moines Register. Public records show nearly 30 permits for renovations, mainly for plumbing and electricity, filed since Wold purchased the property in the summer of 2021.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nSearch for survivors completed, partially collapsed Davenport building to be demolished (Des Moines Register)\n\nNo fatalities reported in Iowa as officials plan to demolish partially collapsed building (Associated Press)\n\nWold carves real estate, construction niche (Quad-City Times)"
