The cities were twinned because of their close resemblance in terms of demographics, economics and geography. Around the turn of the 20th-century, Davenport was considered the most German city in America due to the strong immigration of Germans.\n\nIn the past there have been very active exchanges of students, fire brigades, residents, and much more.\n\nIn 2010, a delegation from Kaiserslautern visited Davenport on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the town twinning. In the same year, a small delegation from Kaiserslautern took part in the International Conference on Climate Change in Chicago."
