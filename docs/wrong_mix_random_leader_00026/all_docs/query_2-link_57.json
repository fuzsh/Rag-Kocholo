However, any owner, occupant, tenant or other person having a possessory interest or control who requests assistance from the police to prevent a gathering from becoming a disorderly premises or nuisance gathering prior to the police receiving complaints related to the event or gathering being a disorderly premises or nuisance gathering shall not be considered to be in violation of this section.
