        "text": "This story was originally published Dec. 23, 2023.\n\nWhen Andrew Wold bought the six-story apartment building, The Davenport, in 2021 for $4.1 million, it was the largest and most expensive residential building in his portfolio.\n\nLeading up to The Davenport, Wold bought, remodeled, managed and sold older residential properties in Davenport, growing his properties from converted single-family homes and small complexes to multi-story apartment buildings.\n\nOver the course of a decade, Wold grew from relative obscurity to own a significant number of older properties in central Davenport.\n\nThe apartment building known as The Davenport, 324 Main St., collapsed on May 28 claiming the lives of three men, took the leg of a woman, and displaced dozens of residents. The two “root causes” of the collapse, investigators said, were the removal of brick sections of wall and inadequate shoring that caused the wall to collapse.\n\nIn the year before the collapse, Wold showed signs of financial strain. He didn’t pay property taxes on time in the year before the collapse, and took out an additional mortgage on his home. His properties had among the most city rental code violations.\n\nProperties owned by limited liability companies associated with Wold had the most city rental code violations during a 13-month period ending on Aug. 28, 2023. The Davenport, owned by Davenport Hotel LLC, had 62 violations — the most of any other property. Companies associated with Wold owned three of the top 10 properties with the most code violations during that period. And a separate Wold-owned company, Andrew Wold Investments, LLC, had the most violations of any other company at 90.\n\nNow Wold, 42, facing lawsuits following the collapse of The Davenport at 324 Main St., is selling many of the properties he had quickly acquired — including his home.\n\nPublic property records, interviews, school records and previous reporting from 2016, when Wold was in the early years of acquiring property, provide a larger picture of Wold’s footprint as a property owner.\n\nWold and his attorneys did not return requests for comment.\n\nMultiple people involved in property development in the area have declined to speak on the record about Wold following the building collapse.\n\nFor Wold, 2015 a 'big buy year'\n\nBorn Dec. 2, 1981, to parents Cameron and Robert Wold, Wold grew up in Davenport and Blue Grass and graduated from Davenport West High School in 2001.\n\nWold told the Times in 2016 that he learned construction hands-on from his dad as they “flipped” houses or redid their own.\n\nAfter graduating, he previously told the Times, he enrolled in Western Illinois University, majored in business and supply chain management and got a job with a large manufacturing company.\n\nIn his spare time, he said he bought properties and did construction.\n\nThe first property he bought under his name in Scott County was a Davenport duplex in 2008, at 633 Boston Dr., which he sold in 2015, according to recorder’s office records. He next bought a home in Buffalo in 2010, which he sold in 2014. From there, his purchases grew.\n\nHe formed his own construction company, called Alliance Contracting, filing paperwork to form it with the state in 2014. In early 2014, he quit his day job, the Times previously reported.\n\nIn 2015, he started rapidly buying more properties, telling the Times that 2015 was a “big buy year.”\n\nAmong his purchases that year: he bought a commercial block on Harrison Street in the Hilltop Campus, three apartment complexes near Palmer College of Chiropractic, and five single-family homes and one apartment building in the area of East 7th and Iowa streets.\n\n\"I'm going to grow indefinitely,\" Wold told the Times in 2016. \"I don't plan on stopping.\"\n\nHe also took over ownership of a 1860s-era brick home across from Davenport Central High School that had fallen into foreclosure and a previously vacant bungalow that year as part of agreements with the Hilltop Campus Association and the Gateway Redevelopment Group to fix them up.\n\nThis year, the leader of the preservation group, Marion Meginnis, told the Quad-City Times she had been disappointed with Wold’s work. She said his handling of older properties prompted her to delete his contact from her phone and advise against renting with him even before the collapse.\n\nWold sold 12 of those properties between 2018 and 2021, and he quickly purchased more.\n\nHis new purchases included Davenport apartment buildings on the national historic registry like the Berg apartments, 246 W. 3rd St. (2019), the Ficke Block, 307-309 Harrison St. (2019), and the Davenport Hotel, 324 Main St. (2021).\n\nAlso during that time, Wold invested more than $200,000 into renovations at his 1977 riverfront home, which he bought in 2017.\n\nWhat does Wold own now?\n\nReporters of the Quad-City Times and Lee Enterprises’ Public Service Journalism Team have identified at least eight businesses associated with Wold that own property in Scott County. As of Dec. 22, Scott County Assessor’s Office records listed 26 Davenport properties divided among the eight businesses. This does not include the site of the collapsed building.\n\nThe total 2023 value of these 26 properties was more than $6.9 million, according to the assessor’s office.\n\nFifteen of the 26 properties are solely residential, according to property records. Eight are duplexes, flats or conversions, all for two families. There are also apartments as well as a single-family residence, a three-family conversion and a four-family conversion.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Revenue describes a conversion as a structure modified from its original design to accommodate more residents.\n\nA flat is a structure for more than one family and can have varying layouts, according to the revenue department. A duplex has two side-by-side residences sharing the same layout.\n\nOf the remaining properties, five were for businesses or a mix of residential and business. The rest were parking lots.\n\nMultiple Wold properties sold or for sale\n\nUntil recently, the property footprint of Wold’s businesses was larger.\n\nAndrew Wold Investments LLC sold another nine Davenport properties in October, according to assessor’s office records. The 2023 assessment for these nine properties gave them a total value of about $995,000.\n\nEight of the properties sold by Andrew Wold Investments were residential, with property records describing seven of them as being for two families. The eighth was for a single family. The ninth property was an empty lot.\n\nAs of Dec. 22, several of the properties owned by the Wold-related businesses were for sale, including The Roosevelt and The Dorothea apartment buildings.\n\n“While he (Wold) has significant properties downtown, there has been serious interest in a lot of the properties,” said Kyle Carter, executive director of the Downtown Davenport Partnership, adding that the property ownership could transition soon.\n\nAll of Wold’s current and recently former properties were built before 1940, assessment records show.\n\nWold buys 15 properties in 2019\n\nWold or his businesses acquired 15 properties in 2019, with 12 of those solely residential. Most of these were for two families, with the others being the three- or four-family conversions or smaller apartment buildings.\n\nAfter 2019, there were not as many acquisitions, but they included larger properties in or near downtown.\n\nOf the four acquired in 2020, one of them was The Roosevelt, 307 W. 6th St. This four-story apartment building has 32 units.\n\nThe only listed acquisitions in 2021 are the building at 324 Main St. and four parking lots. The Davenport Hotel LLC bought all of them from Waukee Investments I LLC in June of that year. Their collective sale price was almost $4.2 million. The six-story building had 80 units, the assessor's website states.\n\nThe 2023 assessment for 324 Main St. valued the property at $6.1 million, according to property records. The parking lots were valued at more than $371,000.\n\nThe most recent acquisition was a single property in 2022: The Dorothea Apartments, 311 W. 3rd St., Davenport. Also four stories, The Dorothea includes 24 residential units and law offices.\n\nThe Wold-related businesses bought properties from various individuals and companies, including TLM Properties LLC and The Foundry Apartments LLC, property records show.\n\nTLM sold The Dorothea Apartments to Dorothea LLC. Foundry sold The Roosevelt to Andrew Wold Investments LLC.\n\nFor some of these properties there was a direct sale to the Wold-associated business currently listed as its owner. In other cases. Wold or one of the businesses purchased the property, then transferred ownership to another of the eight.\n\nThe majority of the businesses associated with Wold are limited liability companies (LLC), but some are cooperatives. An LLC is a business structure that protects its owners from personal responsibility for its debts or liabilities. Cooperatives are another form of property ownership organization but are created under a different Iowa statue.\n\nWold’s LLC, biggest property had most rental code violations\n\nLLCs associated with Wold received 230 city violations between Aug. 1, 2022, and Aug. 28, 2023. The violations range from environmental cleanup to complaint inspections, which in some cases can lead to orders to vacate the property.\n\nNinety of those 230 code violations were from Andrew Wold Investments LLC properties, which had the most violations of any company in Davenport during that 13-month span. A total of 5,424 code violations occurred in the city during that time.\n\nDavenport Hotel LLC, the company that owned 324 Main Street, was issued 62 violations, all of which but two had been issued prior to the building collapse. The address 324 Main Street had the most code violations of any address listed.\n\nThe 10 Davenport Properties with the most code violations Aug. 1, 2022 - Aug. 28, 2023 were:\n\n*Asterisk denotes properties owned by LLCs/cooperatives associated with Wold\n\n*324 Main Street: 62 violations\n\n1905 W. 40th Street: 21 violations\n\n4600 Grand Avenue: 20 violations\n\n5901 Elmore Avenue: 18 violations\n\n6203 Brown Street: 18 violations\n\n*1440 Jersey Ridge Road: 17 violations\n\n2220 Rockingham Road: 17 violations\n\n2925 Dubuque Street: 15 violations\n\n*307 W. 6th Street: 15 violations\n\n1724 W. 6th Street: 14 violations\n\n2302 Redwood Avenue: 14 violations\n\n5001 Sheridan Street: 14 violations\n\n921 W. 3rd Street: 14 violations\n\nWold didn’t keep up with property taxes\n\nOf his current and former properties, Wold was late on his property taxes on 23 properties in 2023. When property owners don’t pay their property taxes due in September and March, investors can buy those tax certificates in June.\n\nThen, the property owner owes the property tax amount to the investor plus 2% interest per month.\n\nCounty Treasurer Tony Knobbe said there’s typically about a thousand properties a year in Scott County in which the tax certificates are sold.\n\n“The first assumption one would make is they’re having financial troubles, right? That’s a pretty easy conclusion to draw,” Knobbe said. “And because of that they’re not able to pay their taxes. Somebody else pays them for them at great cost to the homeowner.”\n\nWold is involved with a number of LLCs and cooperatives\n\nBusinesses associated with Wold which still own property or are active in other ways include:\n\nAndrew Wold Investments LLC\n\nOrganized: 6/9/15\n\nOrganizers: Robert H.
