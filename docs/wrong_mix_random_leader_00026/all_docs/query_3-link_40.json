        "text": "Thomas Rhett On Tour!\n\nGeorgia-born country pop singer-songwriter Thomas Rhett is back on the road in 2024 for a brand new tour! With a total of five Grammy nominations throughout his career, his good-time energy, and charming stage presence, it's bound to be an unforgettable experience and a tour you don't want to miss. Don't miss Thomas Rhett as he comes to a stage near you!\n\nBorn to the legendary country singer Rhett Akins, Thomas actually started out in the entertainment biz by helping out at his father's concerts on the drums. Luckily for us, that wasn't quite enough to contain his musical talents, and he began writing songs for Big Machine after dropping out of college. One such song happened to be a little-known ditty \"I Ain't Ready to Quit\" by one Jason Aldean, and the rest, as they say, is history."
