        "text": "Tracey Blake is a Minnesota based artist, producer and writer. Getting a headstart in music at the age of five, he began to play bass for his dad's gospel quartet in Davenport Iowa. Knowing most of his life that he wanted to have a career in music, Tracey moved to Minneapolis after high school to pursue his dream. He has since played all over the world and have recorded multiple CDs and recently has connected with some of the biggest writers in country music.\n\nThroughout the years Tracey has toured extensively playing some of the best theaters and venues in the world. After years of touring, writing, and producing, Tracey started Big Hearts For Better Days Foundation: a charity for children with terminal conditions. It is excited to work with the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital and other children's hospitals around the country in the future. Tracey is looking forward to making a difference in the lives of others through his gift of music."
