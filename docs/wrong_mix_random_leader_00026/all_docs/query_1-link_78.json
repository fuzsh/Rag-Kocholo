        "text": "The Singh Group at Merrill was founded by Tony Singh in 1989. The essence of Tony's business was a work ethic rooted in the American Dream and one that the humble and hardworking people of Eastern Iowa and Western Illinois took notice of as they met and hired Tony. Starting at kitchen tables and living rooms, his first clients believed in Tony's passion and enthusiasm for investing and the intense personal care he brought to the client-advisor relationship.\n\nAs Tony grew his family alongside those of his clients, his children would frequently attend meetings and visits to clients homes, farms, and places of work and worship. By 2007, his eldest daughter Aleeza formally joined alongside her Father in the practice and began the second generation of the Singh Group. Since then, the team has developed alongside their client's into a multi-generational Wealth Management practice with a wide-breadth of services and expertise; all out of a dedication for staying one step ahead of the needs of those families they serve.\n\nToday, the Singh Group serves clients from coast to coast and is regarded as one of the most sophisticated and high-functioning Wealth Management teams in the Greater Quad Cities area. Dedicated to a select group of High-Net worth Families, the Singh Group optimizes the vast capabilities of Merrill and Bank of America make themselves universally available, accessible, and sharply honed for their clients across the country, anytime and anywhere.\n\nOur mission is to continue these clients' legacy of financial excellence and achievement for future generations, from one family to another."
