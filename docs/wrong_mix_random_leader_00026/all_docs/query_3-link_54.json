        "text": "About Opera Quad Cities\n\nMission Statement\n\nThe mission of Opera Quad Cities is to nurture classical and operatic singing in the Quad Cities area with an emphasis on local artists.\n\nOpera Quad Cities History\n\nIn September, 2001, Opera Quad Cities was created to complete the spectrum of performing arts within the greater QC community. A formal, professional organization that presented opera and other artistic singing opportunities was needed to enhance the existing efforts of the Quad City Symphony Orchestra, Ballet Quad Cities, Genesius Guild, Quad City Music Guild, Playcrafters, Chamber Music Quad Cities, Circa 21 Dinner Theatre Playhouse, and other local performing arts organizations. The need to support the efforts of artistic local singers and respond to the audiences traveling outside the QC for opera and related performances provided the incentive to begin.\n\narious projects and performances over the seasons include fully staged productions of major opera works such as: The Magic Flute (Mozart), La Boheme (Puccini), Cosi fan butte (Mozart), Carmen (Bizet), Rigoletto (Verdi), and The Medium (Menotti); Children’s operas: The Little Sweep (Britten), The Three Little Pigs ala Mozart (arr. Davis), and The Pied Piper (Francouer); Opera Highlights Concerts with orchestra; a Young Artist Competition for singers of various ages and experience; Vocal Valentine Celebrations, and other lectures and demonstrations for local civic organizations to “de-mystify” opera and make the art form more accessible.\n\nEven though the programming is diverse and vibrant, OQC strives to support local professional singers with outlets to be expressive and grow in their artistry while supporting local audiences who enjoy fine singing. OQC also invites professional singers back to the community who have, out of necessity, left the area in pursuit of their singing careers in more established markets. Professional artists from all over the US have collaborated with OQC to support the best productions possible within our local resources and to encourage other local professional singers to continue their artistic endeavors.\n\nPerformances have been held at the Adler Theatre, St. Ambrose University, Augustana College, The Capitol Theatre, The Figge Museum of Art, The Davenport Public Library, The Moline Public Library, and for local public schools.\n\nIn recent years, a consortium between Augustana College, Genesius Guild, and Opera Quad Cities was begun in order to coordinate and share resources toward making performances more affordable and to not duplicate required expenses. OQC is overseen by a local volunteer Board of Directors made up of local professionals including college/university voice instructors, business professionals, and experienced theatre artists. Volunteers are welcome to support all aspects of our work through an endless variety of tasks and activities.\n\nPhoto by Peter Liu features the cast of ‘Don Giovanni’ from our June 2023 production"
