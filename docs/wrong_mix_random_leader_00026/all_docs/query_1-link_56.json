        "text": "A Brief History of Davenport Public Library\n\nEarly Historical Records\n\nLibrary service began in Davenport in 1839 with the creation of the Carey Library Association. A reading room was established in the Le Claire Hotel at the northeast corner of 2nd and Main Streets the following year. The next mention of any type of local library appears in the Davenport Gazette in 1853, announcing the opening of a reading room and circulating library in the Forrest Building at the corner of 4th and Brady Streets. The Library Association led a precarious existence and moved and reorganized a number of times. Finally becoming more self-sustaining, the renamed Young Men's Library Association leased the old Methodist Church Building at Fifth and Brady Streets. Control of the Association was entrusted to the women of the community.\n\nCarnegie believed strongly that public libraries should be funded by local citizens, so instead of simply giving money to assist the Association, Carnegie offered $50,000 to found a tax-supported public library in Davenport - if the citizens of Davenport would support library operations. At the April 1900 election, the citizens of Davenport voted in favor of a public library tax to support Davenport Public Library. This was, perhaps coincidentally, also the first election held in Iowa in which white women were allowed to vote. When it became evident the library building would cost more than $50,000, Carnegie increased his donation to $75,000.\n\nThrough the efforts of Library Board President C.D. Waterman, Jr., Edward Durrell Stone, the internationally known architect who had designed the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC and Museum of Modern Art in New York City, agreed to design the new library building. Stone's vision included a large open ground floor topped with a mezzanine and integrated the children's wing, which had not been demolished. The new Davenport Public Library building was dedicated and opened on October 6, 1968. In 2021, Davenport Public Library | Main received a $1.9 million dollar renovation, improving infrastructure and adding study rooms, more comfortable seating and spaces, and the Studio 321 makerspace.\n\nThe Branch Libraries\n\nFor many years, Davenport Public Library had small library branches in some area schools. In 1975, the City acquired the Annie Wittenmyer Complex, a Civil War-era series of buildings that had originally been the Iowa Soldiers Orphans Home. Later known as the Annie Wittenmyer Home, the facility had housed more than 12,000 orphans during its 115 years of operation, but closed in the 1970s. Some of the historic buildings in the Complex had been torn down and newer buildings constructed, but after it became City property, efforts were made to preserve the remaining buildings through placement on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 1977, the City offered the Library the opportunity to temporarily put a branch library in the main Complex building, in the rooms which had once served as the kitchen and dining room. The Library opened the new 4,200 square foot Annie Wittenmyer Branch on April 3, 1978. This facility was designed to hold approximately 20,000 books, along with seating and program space.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, the City of Davenport was steadily growing, both to the west and to the north. It was decided that the aging Annie Wittenmyer Branch, located only 3 miles from Davenport Public Library | Main, no longer functioned well and needed to be replaced with branches in the areas of the city that were expanding. A site chosen in 1992 and a library plan developed, but a variety of obstacles cropped up causing delays and repeated relocating. Finally, in 2001, the newly-elected mayor and city council identified the construction of new library branches as a high priority. A new location was selected for the first branch and the City purchased land.\n\nDavenport Public Library Directors\n\n1902 - 1905 Marilla Waite Freeman\n\n1905 - 1906 Stella V.
