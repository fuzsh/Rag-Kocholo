        "text": "Scott K Fish & Paul T. Riddle Interview: Artimus Pyle\n\nSKF NOTE: I don't have much to add to my written introduction to Artimus Pyle's Modern Drummer interview in April 1983. Paul T. Riddle as co-interviewer was great. His friendship and history with Artimus were invaluable. I'm sure Paul's presence helped Art feel more relaxed during this...\n\nGene Krupa Looks at Todayâ€™s Drummers (1958)\n\nSKF NOTE: One more insightful, brief Down Beat interview. This one by the magazine's East Coast Editor Dom Cerulli with Gene Krupa for the March 20, 1958 issue. In my lifetime I acquired two large stacks of old Down Beat magazines. In the early 1970's a music store in Davenport, Iowa sold me a...\n\nSteve Gadd Alive!: St. Thomas\n\nSKF NOTE: For Steve Gadd fans, this is a 1972 Down Beat record review of Chuck Mangione’s Alive! album. Not available in MP3 (Rats!). But this is some great Steve Gadd, in concert on a four-piece Gretsch drumset. Check out St. Thomas. “Fleet of beat,” indeed. Album front cover Album back...\n\nScott K Fish Interview: Gary Chester\n\nSKF NOTE: Looking at this interview last night for the first time in probably 30 years, I am surprised to see Gary Chester's feature interview fourth in line in the April 1983 Modern Drummer, behind Jack DeJohnette, Artimus Pyle, and The Pros: On Bass Drums. Today, because of his subsequent...\n\nScott K Fish Interview: Willie Nelson's Drummer Paul English\n\nSKF NOTE: If you're reading this interview, chances are you know Paul English is Willie Nelson's longtime friend and drummer. This was a phone interview, but I did get to meet Paul a short time later when Willie performed at Town Hall in New York City. I've always seen a similarity with the...\n\nScott K Fish Interview: James Black\n\nSKF NOTE: My James Black interview appeared in the December 1982 Modern Drummer. The first person to get me excited about James Black's drumming was Jaimoe. We were listening to records and Jaimoe asked me if I'd ever heard James Black. I said, \"No.\" He pulled out an old Riverside record of the...\n\nSteve Gadd Smiling\n\nSKF NOTE: This week I came across this 8?10 glossy of a smiling Steve Gadd given to me by Rick Mattingly circa 1982. Rick took a number of good photos when he was Features Editor at Modern Drummer. I remember admiring this one and Rick giving me a copy. Thank you, Rick. Scott K Fish Blog...\n\nFrankie Dunlop's Christmas Card\n\nSKF NOTE: Going through some boxes of writings, photos, and other leftovers last night, I found some items, like this Christmas card from Frankie Dunlop, that bring back good memories. This was probably Christmas 1984. I met two or three times with Frankie, interviewing him for Modern Drummer...\n\nMax Roach: A Great Drummer Looks Back at Influences (1958)\n\nSKF NOTE: One of my favorite Down Beat issues. DB Editor Don Gold includes several Max Roach insights on great jazz musicians like Thelonious Monk, Kenny Clarke, and Miles Davis. Max was 33-years old at the time. The cover art is by Peter Gourfain. The underscored parts are mine, probably for...\n\nScott K Fish Interview: Jaimo and Butch Trucks\n\nScott K Fish Interview: Jaimo and Butch Trucks SKF NOTE: I don’t need to add much explanation to this first interview with Butch Trucks and Jaimo. Bill Grillo was a friend, a drummer, and a big fan of Butch and Jaimo. He had listened to the Allman Brothers much more than I had. His insight was...\n\nLouie Bellson: The Finger Method of Drumming\n\nSKF NOTE: I found this incomplete column posted awhile ago on The Great Drummers Group Facebook page. When I went back weeks later to find it again so I could credit the original poster, I could not find it. If someone knows or is the original poster, please let me know. I'd like to correct the...\n\nShelly Manne for the First Time\n\nShelly Manne for the First Time by Scott K Fish The first I remember seeing Shelly Manne's name/photo is the early 1970s in Avedis Zildjian's Cymbal Set-Ups of Famous Drummers booklet. I wanted to buy a 20-inch A Zildjian Ride cymbal, but the local music store had only a few in stock, all...\n\nWould Today's Music Make Me Want to Be a Drummer? Part 2\n\nWould Today's Music Make Me Want to Be a Drummer? Part 2 I posted my previous thread, Would Today's Music Make Me Want to Be a Drummer?, on two favorite drum forums: DrumForum.org and Drummerworld.com. Interesting, thoughtful responses. Conclusion: I am not alone. Some forum readers said, no...\n\nScott K Fish: Would Today's Music Make Me Want to Be a Drummer?\n\nScott K Fish: Would Today's Music Make Me Want to Be a Drummer? Scott K Fish I rarely listen to my car radio. Music? I plug in my MP3 player. Audiobooks and podcasts? I plug in my MP3 player. For three days this week I am driving to Florida with Eileen, in Eileen's car, and she always listen...\n\nDaniel Freedman: It's Always Been Hard Being a Jazz Musician\n\nQuest to make drum set not sound like one By ROBIN CAUDELL Press-Republican | Posted: Wednesday, September 30, 2015 5:20 pm UPPER JAY/WHALLONSBURG — Daniel Freedman absorbed the art of drumming from the hands of masters, so it’s little wonder he’s considered one of the mercurial rhythm...\n\nTony Williams 'Down Beat' Interview: 1970\n\nTony Williams 'Down Beat' Interview: 1970 SKF NOTE: A \"unique\" 1970 Tony Williams interview from Pat Cox, indeed. I'm unable to find this interview online. I do see it cited online in books. Also, I'm including the full-page ads from Tony's record company and Gretsch drums included in this Down...\n\nWanted: Back Story to this Tony Williams Drumset\n\nSKF NOTE: My Kingdom for the first person who can tell us the back story to Tony Williams's drumset in this photo. The photo was posted by Bruce Ditmas on Facebook. Bruce credits it to Norbert Brycht. Scott K Fish Blog: Life Beyond the Cymbals\n\nScott K Fish Interview: Jim Gordon\n\nScott K Fish Interview: Jim Gordon SKF NOTE: When Jim Keltner called me at Modern Drummer to ask if we would be interested in interviewing his friend, Jim Gordon, the answer was an unequivocal yes. It was a time when we MD Editors felt, to an extent, as if we were playing catch up securing..."
