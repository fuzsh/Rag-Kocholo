You can expect a nutty, toasted crust, sauce that’s more spicy than sweet, and toppings under the cheese instead of on top. Another clue you’re enjoying QC style? The pizza is cut into strips rather than slices.\n\nHappy Joe's is known as the inventor of taco pizza, a polarizing flavor that’s worth trying at least once. The Taco Joe features a base of refried beans, sausage and taco seasoned beef all topped with lettuce, tomato and taco chips and served with tangy Spicy Joe’s taco sauce.\n\nStudent favorite | Rachel Hart\n\n\"I'm sad that I didn't have Happy Joe's until my senior year at Augie.

Hike the 208 acres of public use areas, prairie and nature preserve along the Rock River, and discover the history of Black Hawk and the Sauk and Meskwaki people in the John Hauberg Indian Museum.\n\nLunch: Local favorite Arthur’s Garden Delicatessen (3727 46th Ave., Rock Island) is just down the road. (You could order to-go and have lunch back at the park in good weather.)\n\nAfternoon: After lunch, take a stroll through the Quad City Botanical Center gardens and tropical atrium in Rock Island. As a public garden, it maintains hundreds of plants ranging from tropical varieties to regional perennials.

It's amazing that these beautiful nature views are so close to campus!\"\n\nWalker and wanderer\n\nMorning: Take a walk on the Mississippi River Trail in Iowa or Illinois.

The trail runs through downtowns, residential areas and historic districts, passing through many riverfront parks.\n\nAfternoon: If you’re still craving river views after your morning walk, head to the Skybridge in downtown Davenport. Enjoy an expansive view of the Iowa/Illinois border framed by the Mississippi River, Arsenal and Centennial bridges.\n\nAlso visit Vander Veer Botanical Park (215 W. Central Park Ave., Davenport). Spanning 33 acres in the middle of town, Vander Veer was modeled after New York City’s Central Park and is believed to be one of the first botanical parks west of the Mississippi River. The park features changing flower displays all year, decorative fountains, a conservatory and All-American Rose Selection gardens.\n\nNear campus: La Rancherita (4118 14th Ave., Rock Island), is beloved by Augustana students, faculty and staff, who like to walk here for lunch.
