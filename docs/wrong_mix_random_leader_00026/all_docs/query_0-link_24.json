        "text": "Introduction by David Walsh\n\nThe World Socialist Web Site editorial board asked a number of contributing writers and readers to list their favorite artists, works and performers of the century in several categories. The contributors, including artists and critics, have collectively spent a good many years thinking about aesthetic questions.\n\nThose participating were requested to provide lists of favorites in any given category, on the supposition that definitively establishing the “best” in artistic and cultural matters is a near impossibility. Aside from the fact that personal taste, personal history and other subjective factors come into play, what does “the best” mean in art? There may be only one correct way to answer certain scientific problems, but there are an infinite number of ways to approach artistic truth.\n\nCertain contributors chose to explain their choices, most did not. The reader might reasonably ask: what does this particular group of people, Marxists or those sympathetic to the goal of socialism, bring to a consideration of twentieth century culture?\n\nThe first thing, most obviously, is social insight. It is safe to say that this collection of individuals has had more experience wrestling with social problems, and in particular with the development of the consciousness of the working class, than any other similar group that is likely to take up artistic questions. This is not a small matter.\n\nBy itself, however, as we know, such experience would not qualify anyone to make judgments about artistic excellence. As a specific mode of human activity, artistic work has to be measured by artistic standards. All those participating, as their selections indicate, grasp that fact. We have long ago gone beyond the method of praising works for the prettifying or consoling picture they provide of social life, or for their worthy intentions. Whether the reader agrees with the choices or not, he or she will have to admit that they have been made with due consideration to the specific problems of artistic production.\n\nBearing then those two elements in mind—the socially-critical standpoint and the concern for the highest aesthetic quality—what are some of the characteristics that this group of contributors might look for in a novel, a film or a piece of music?\n\nI can only truly speak for myself, but perhaps other contributors might agree that the work we admire must possess seriousness about human affairs, compassion and a kind of intellectual or moral rigor; that it must move and delight; that it must reveal something about social reality in an original and perhaps disturbing manner; that, more than mere beauty, it must have an incandescence to it. We are all, I think, looking for inspired moments at which the pettiness and routine of everyday life fall away and we're able to grasp in mind and body some grains of absolute truth about the human condition. We are all convinced, I believe, that such knowledge contributes to the cause of social progress.\n\nIn my own mind, for example, my first three choices in fiction most closely address these concerns. I don't know of any works that have astonished, enlightened and terrified me more in twentieth century literature than Alfred Döblin's Berlin Alexanderplatz, Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy and Louis-Ferdinand Céline's Journey to the End of the Night. To me these are unimpeachable works, their truth, their beauty, their protest beyond dispute. Each takes treats banal events (the life of a truck driver, a sordid murder case, the fate of a soldier and eventual doctor to the poor) and finds in them the universal, the “sacred,” as it were. Others find these or similar qualities in different works.\n\nThe argument could be made that the work which endures is not necessarily the one that sets itself the task of describing great events and self-consciously advancing great themes. Friedrich Engels advised Ferdinand Lassalle in his playwriting efforts to follow the example of Shakespeare, with his spontaneity and his wealth of realistic detail, and not that of Schiller, who tended to transform his characters into mouthpieces. A significant work carries with it its truth at every moment, it doesn't wait for grand speeches at the end of the third act.\n\nAside from that general consideration, there may be something about the particular character of the twentieth century that bears on the matter. It has been a century marked more than any other by the entry of masses of people into history. Examining the thoughts and emotions of “ordinary” individuals inevitably pressed itself on artists as necessary and fruitful work. Indeed in the face of momentous events, pitched battles between the forces of revolution and counterrevolution, battles whose outcome might be largely determined by the consciousness of the previously anonymous and inarticulate masses, the mental state of the latter became the question of the century.\n\nEach list or contribution that follows is inevitably a polemic in support of a certain way of looking at life and art. Given the oppositional nature of the contributors' views, it is not surprising, in the field of European and North American fiction for instance, that their choices are perhaps at odds with the officially-sanctioned “great literature” of the twentieth century. Nonetheless the apparent lack of interest in such figures as Marcel Proust, James Joyce and Thomas Mann (Henry James is largely a figure of the nineteenth century) does not indicate, in my view, the belief that there is no value in reading those authors. It is rather a positive argument in favor of other, relatively neglected figures, with insights into perhaps more explosive areas of social and psychological reality. In any event, it is an argument the contributors feel ought to be made under the present circumstances.\n\nWe hope our readers will agree that the contributions, as a whole, make fascinating reading. We make no claim that they reflect evenly the development of each art form in every part of the world. There are obvious gaps, both in terms of geography and artistic medium. Nonetheless, taken as a whole, they do represent a serious effort to confront the critical artistic and cultural issues of the past century.\n\nIn their own way the contributions demonstrate that the twentieth century, which, incredibly enough, we can now speak of in the past tense, was the most complex, inspiring and tragic in human history. There has been no shortage of human aspiration or genius. Everything that it is given human beings to strive for has appeared before men and women as a possibility. Yet this potential, like the fruit and water just out of reach of Tantalus, whom the gods punished, retreated as mankind attempted to realize it.\n\nIt does seem worth noting in this regard that in the fields of fiction, poetry and music at least the vast majority of works selected were produced half a century ago or more. Only a relative handful of novels, for instance, written in the past two or three decades appears on the lists. It would be comforting if this merely reflected the belief that a work must be made to stand “the test of time.” Unhappily, it is more likely an accurate response to what has been a general cultural retrogression.\n\nIt cannot be mere coincidence that so many of the novels and musical compositions cited below were created in the first third or so of the century. A great anticipation, which artists not simply reflected, but helped produce, that humanity was about to ascend to a higher form of social organization, animated great numbers of people. This sentiment was cruelly betrayed, in the name of “socialism” and “communism” by the bureaucracy in the Soviet Union and its political supporters everywhere. We still live under the political, moral and psychological shadow cast by this betrayal.\n\nProfessional cynics, those who have given up on the possibility of changing the world, have no need to concern themselves in a serious manner with the artistic brilliance and intellectual insight of the past. On the contrary, such work makes demands and presents realities that the skeptics and renegades would rather not be reminded of; it all stands as too much of a condemnation.\n\nWe publish these contributions in large measure because we have confidence that they will be needed by those waking to the reality of the social crisis and who may feel dissatisfied with their own state of mental preparedness. At the hinge joining the two centuries, we turn our attention at once to the past and the future. The effort to preserve the best in the twentieth century against the forces of ignorance, philistinism and reaction must be bound up, in our view, with the impulse to create a new critical and revolutionary culture.\n\nA new century will inevitably produce a new mood. There will be the general sentiment that we are starting or ought to start with a clean slate. People will also want to take stock of present-day society and culture, they will want to know how we arrived at this point and in which direction we might go. They will not accept on faith the official arguments. This process has already begun. It will only grow in depth and scope. We might agree with the French writer Lautréamont, observing in 1870: “At the time of this writing, new tremors are running through the intellectual atmosphere; one needs only the courage to face them.”\n\nThe contributions are posted in alphabetical order. The numbers have been added in a number of cases simply for the sake of uniformity and convenience. They should not necessarily be construed as indicating an order of preference.\n\nJohn Andrews, WSWS contributing writer (US)\n\nList of 10 favorite jazz musicians:\n\nJazz music flowered in the twentieth century. As we approach its end, there is serious concern that this distinctively American art form, a hybrid of many different cultural currents which melded in the dynamic growth of US industry and economic power, may have run its creative course. Rather than expanding the frontiers of the music, new players are dipping into the styles of the past, particularly bebop, or borrowing from other musical trends such as rock. We will soon see what the future has in store for this wonderful music.\n\nThis is my list of favorite jazz musicians of the twentieth century, given more or less in chronological order. Although I considered the artists' impact on the music as a whole, the most important criterion for this list is how much I personally enjoy listening to their recordings. I understand that the list does not contain such highly significant figures as Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and John Coltrane. It is a matter of personal taste, not a value judgment.\n\n1. Louis Armstrong: Trumpet, cornet, and vocal (1901-71)\n\nHe was the progenitor. One simply cannot imagine jazz without Louis. He left his native New Orleans, where the earliest jazz was performed constantly in venues all over the city in the early 1920s to work in the small band of his main influence, King Oliver, and then in the prominent big band of Fletcher Henderson. From 1925 to 1928 Armstrong made several dozen small group recordings known as the “Hot Fives” and “Hot Sevens” for Okey Records' “race” catalogue. These historic performances, available today on compact discs, belong in every serious jazz library. Armstrong plays solo after solo of soaring trumpet, perfectly constructed, swinging and packed with exuberance and emotion. Although the sidemen other than pianist Earl “Fatha” Hines sound a bit stodgy and old-fashioned by contemporary standards, Armstrong's trumpet consistently sounds fresh and relevant, and his unique vocals are always both humorous and moving.\n\nArmstrong quickly became an international star, the main influence on what would become “swing music” and an astoundingly entertaining personality. Although he would remain a superb musician by any other standard, he did not maintain the lofty aesthetic peak achieved in his earlier work. During the 1930s and early 1940s, Armstrong fronted a mediocre large band, featuring more and more of his “mugging” and other silliness along with increasingly self-conscious and showboating trumpet playing. After World War II, Armstrong became one of the most vocal opponents of modern jazz, forming a small group of “All Stars” which played caricatures of early New Orleans music.\n\nIn 1964, Armstrong achieved his greatest commercial success when “Hello Dolly” became his first Number One hit. His appearance in the 1968 film of the same name stole the show from Barbara Streisand. Armstrong continued to work almost right up to his death, at home, from heart failure.\n\n2. Bix Beiderbecke: Cornet and piano. 1903-31.\n\nBeiderbecke was Armstrong's opposite twin. Raised by staid middle-class German-American parents in Davenport, Iowa, Beiderbecke developed a lyrical improvisational style much cooler and, perhaps, emotionally more complex than Armstrong's. He spent most of his brief musical career within the ponderous, commercial dance orchestra fronted by Paul Whiteman, then the so-called “King of Jazz.” During those years, however, Bix found a soul mate in the C-melody saxophonist Frankie Trumbauer, and together they made several wonderful small band recordings, also for Okey Records. The best of these, for example “Singin' the Blues,” “I'm Comin' Virginia,” and “Way Down Yonder in New Orleans,” are immortal. Plagued by acute alcoholism, Beiderbecke's died at 28.\n\n3. Art Tatum: Piano. 1910-56.\n\nAlmost completely sightless, Art Tatum was the greatest piano virtuoso in jazz history. He played an aggressive two-handed style firmly grounded in the conventions of the swing era, but full of harmonic inventiveness and punctuated by unexpected rhythmic changes and incredible flights of scales and arpeggios going every which direction.\n\nFirst recorded in 1932, Tatum quickly established himself as the most outstanding pianist in jazz, whether playing solo or in a group. Perhaps the best recordings available today are his seven CD's of solo work recorded late in his career by Norman Granz, and now available on Pablo records. Tatum too was an alcoholic, and died at the age of 46.\n\nTatum has always been a favorite of musicians, with the outstanding pianist Oscar Peterson being his most notable disciple.\n\n4. Lester Young: Tenor saxophone and clarinet. 1909-59.\n\nAs a member of the great Count Basie Band from 1935 to 1940, Lester Young was the most important figure in the transition from swing to bop. Citing Frankie Trumbauer as his principal influence, Young established an entirely new approach to the improvised solo: long, flowing, structured, “horizontal” lines which seemed to tell beautiful little stories in sound. Besides his numerous recordings with Basie, during the second half of the 1930s Young made a number of exquisite sides under the supervision of John Hammond accompanying vocalist Billie Holiday.\n\nAfter leaving Basie, Young's playing, although still lyrical and enjoyable, underwent a steady decline, hastened by an unfortunate experience with the US military during 1944 and 1945 and increasing alcohol abuse. Nevertheless, Young continued to play until his sad death at 49 from malnutrition and alcoholism.\n\nYoung not only laid the foundation for the bebop revolution, but was the direct and overriding influence on virtually all its tenor saxophonists, including Stan Getz, Dexter Gordon and Zoot Sims, and several of its finest alto saxophonists, especially Lee Konitz, Art Pepper and Paul Desmond.\n\n5. Charlie Parker: Alto saxophone (1920-55)\n\nIn my personal opinion, Charlie Parker's virtuoso improvisation incorporated and surpassed all the jazz which preceded it and then profoundly influenced all the jazz which followed. He developed an entirely new musical vocabulary firmly grounded in rhythmic and harmonic logic to express a breadth and depth of emotion far beyond earlier players. He was, arguably, the greatest American musician of the twentieth century.\n\nParker, also known as “Yardbird” or just “Bird,” grew up in Kansas City while it was the base of operations for Lester Young and the Basie Band. On his first recordings with Jay McShann, who then led a fine swing band similar to Basie's, Parker's alto sounds almost like a speeded up Young tenor solo. By 1945, however, Parker had gone far beyond his principal influence. Having formed an invaluable, if unstable, partnership with trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, recordings such as “Groovin' High,” “Hot House,” and “Salt Peanuts” forever changed the face of jazz and, with it, popular American music as a whole.\n\nUnfortunately, the fruits of Parker's genius were diminished in no small degree by his seemingly insatiable appetite for narcotics and liquor. Parker's prime was interrupted by a seven-month stay in a California state mental hospital. After his release in 1947, he led a fine quintet including Max Roach on drums and a very young Miles Davis on trumpet, which left a legacy of outstanding recordings on the Dial and Savoy labels. In 1949, Parker switched to labels controlled by impresario Norman Granz, later consolidated as Verve, and made recordings in more commercial settings, including with somewhat tacky sounding string sections.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Parker's health deteriorated and his behavior became increasingly erratic. He was almost entirely inactive during 1954. Charlie Parker died at the age of 34 from the effects of chronic alcohol and drug abuse.\n\n6. Bud Powell: Piano (1924-66)\n\nThe only bebop player who could have possibly eclipsed Charlie Parker, Bud Powell was an absolutely brilliant musician, possessing both extraordinary technique and boundless musical imagination, but his achievements were curtailed by severe mental problems which would hound him to an early grave.\n\nPowell mesmerized the early New York bebop scene while still a teenager and completely changed the way jazz piano was to be played from then on. He eliminated the steady “stride” rhythms and full chording from the left hand, replacing it with sparse, irregular punctuations, often consisting of only one or two notes. Meantime his right hand would play dazzling, rapid fire bebop melodies. Despite two extended hospitalizations, which included barbaric electro-shock treatments, Powell's trio and solo piano recordings through the year 1951 have never been equaled, and can be listened to again and again with no diminution of pleasure.\n\nUnfortunately, Powell's health and talents eroded steadily throughout the 1950's. Finally, he moved to France, where he developed a most touching relationship with a fan, Frances Paudras, who patiently nursed him back to mental and physical health. Paudras told the story in his remarkable book, Dance of the Infidels, and French film director Bertrand Tavernier used it for his film ‘Round Midnight, starring tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon as the Bud Powell character.\n\nWith his strength and sanity restored after six years in France, Powell returned triumphantly to the United States in 1964. All the old habits and problems quickly overtook him, however, and he died alcoholic and penniless at age 41.\n\n7. Fats Navarro: Trumpet. (1923-50)\n\nSome readers may question my choice of Fats Navarro, a relative obscure player, over Dizzy Gillespie, the great innovator of bebop, or Miles Davis. My reason is aesthetic: Navarro's improvised solos are better sculpted and more beautiful than either Gillespie's or Davis's.\n\nNavarro first became prominent in 1944 as Gillespie's replacement in the great Billy Eckstine Orchestra. He subsequently became an integral member of Tadd Dameron's small group, appearing on several wonderful sides recorded for Savoy, Blue Note and Capitol. Although his overall recording output is relatively meager, there is a wonderful live recording, “One Night at Birdland,” made in the famed New York nightclub during late 1949 or early 1950, featuring a quintet with Charlie Parker, Bud Powell and Navarro.\n\nUnfortunately, Navarro was heavily addicted to heroin, which led to his death from tuberculosis at age 26.\n\n8. Clifford Brown: Trumpet. (1930-56)\n\nClifford Brown carried on the legacy of Fats Navarro. He practiced relentlessly, and his dedication to both the instrument and the music manifested itself in a beautiful fat, clear sound and impeccably crafted solos. He was one of the best jazz musician to emerge after the founding generation of beboppers.\n\nAlthough Brown's entire recorded legacy comprises only about three years, it is incredibly varied. Although much of his playing took place within the prototype “hard bop” band he co-led with drummer Max Roach, he appeared on albums backing singers, including Sarah Vaughn and Dinah Washington, fronting big bands, including some with arrangements by a young Quincy Jones, and playing ballads over lush string arrangements. There is one special recording he made with a group of “West Coast” “cool” musicians, with arrangements of several Brown compositions, including his great standard Joy Spring.\n\nUnlike so many jazz musicians of the period, including most of those listed here, Brown lived clean of substance abuse with his wife and son. He might still be thrilling us today except that on June 26, 1956, he was tragically killed in a car accident along with Bud Powell's younger brother, Ritchie.\n\n9. Bill Evans: Piano (1929-80).\n\nFollowing Art Tatum and Bud Powell, Bill Evans was the third architect of twentieth century jazz piano. Featured along with John Coltrane on Miles Davis's groundbreaking album Kind of Blue, Evans became one of the best known and most admired jazz players of the 1960s.\n\nIn his early years, the pale and bespectacled Evans looked more like an accountant than a jazz musician. His posture was as unique as his playing, as he hunched over the piano so that his forehead on occasion sank even lower than the keyboard. But his music was sublime. First with the outstanding Scott Lafaro and, following his death in a 1961 car accident, several other great bassists, Evans redefined the jazz trio. Although his playing developed over the years and always displayed sensitivity to context, it maintains a consistency of quality and integrity throughout. Regularly recorded, Evans work can be heard on a variety of comprehensive boxed sets or single albums.\n\nEvans, too, was afflicted by the bane of narcotics addiction. Although he successfully battled it during many periods of his life, it finally killed him at the age of 53.\n\n10. Stan Kenton: Pianist, bandleader and arranger (1911-79)\n\nMy including Stan Kenton on this 10-best list is sure to raise a few eyebrows, if not guffaws. Not a great musician in any sense of the word, Kenton's contribution to jazz arose from his seemingly tireless efforts to assemble big bands with outstanding musicians and have them play through the best arrangements available.\n\nKenton formed his first “orchestra” in 1941, and it became a popular sensation. With a year off here or there to reorganize, he kept edition after edition of the band on the road until health problems forced him into retirement in 1978. Sometimes pretentious to the point of absurdity, Kenton strove to be on the cutting edge of serious music making by employing arrangers involved with all the latest developments in twentieth century music: Pete Rugulo, Bill Russo, Shorty Rogers, Bill Holman and Johnny Richards, just to name a few. Band alumni, many still active in music, are too numerous to mention.\n\nKenton's sound on his best recordings is characterized by brilliant, fanned out brass sections (often beefed up with French horns or melliphoniums in addition to the standard trumpets and trombones), sinewy saxophone lines, and tricky changes of tempo and key. Soloists were invariably excellent, and most arrangements would invariably lead up to dramatic crescendos both loud and pleasing to the ear.\n\nThere are still legions of Kenton fanatics collecting recordings and attending reunion concerts featuring band alumni. His contribution to jazz music was unique and should not be overlooked.\n\nTen favorite singers of “The Great American Songbook,” in no particular order\n\n1. Frank Sinatra\n\n2. Ella Fitzgerald\n\n3. Johnny Hartman\n\n4. Mel Tormé\n\n5. Sarah Vaughn\n\n6. Dinah Washington\n\n7. Nat King Cole\n\n8. Tony Bennett\n\n9. Joe Williams\n\n10. Billie Holiday\n\nPaul Bond, WSWS contributing writer (Britain)\n\nA list of enthusiasms\n\nFilms/Filmmakers:\n\n1. Luis Buñuel—It would be invidious to select one film by the director whose work I have enjoyed so much and which has had so much bearing on the way I comprehend art. Perhaps for sentimental reasons I should say The Exterminating Angel which was the first Buñuel film I saw, and which opened up to me a whole new world of filmmaking and the imagination.\n\n2. The Marx Brothers, Duck Soup —I have always preferred the wilder excesses of their early slapstick even to the better-made more structured Irving Thalberg movies (A Night at the Opera etc.). Duck Soup is the one that runs wildest with the notion of shape in a movie.\n\n3. Federico Fellini— Amarcord was the first film I saw where a camera panned along a crowded street illuminating any number of small scenes before arriving at the story the director was going to tell. This was wonderful, humane, filmmaking, fascinated with the extraordinary in the ordinary.\n\n4. Buster Keaton—The greatest master of silent physical comedy opened a world of imagination. As interested in the reaction of people to film as in the techniques of film itself, Keaton always played a more sympathetic character than Chaplin, one with whom the audience could identify rather than one the audience was invited to adore.\n\n5. Fritz Lang, M —Peter Lorre was one of the truly great screen actors, with a range that encompassed many shades of feeling and moral ambiguity. The original German version of M provided him with his finest role as the haunted child-killer.\n\n6. John Huston, The Maltese Falcon —There are better American noir movies. There are tougher tough guys than Bogart. There are meaner villains than Greenstreet. (It must be said, though, that there are fewer weirdoes weirder than Lorre, or cheap hoods cheaper than Elisha Cook Jr.). The whole hangs together perfectly, though, like a slept-in suit.\n\n7. Carl Dreyer, Vampyr —The most frightening of horror movies, in which the feeling of evil is greater than the evil portrayed. Along with Robert Wiener's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu, Vampyr established the dislocated landscape of German Expressionism as the perfect vehicle for an alienating terror.\n\n8. W. C. Fields—the old curmudgeon, ogling women and drink with almost the same expression, detesting children as small beasts that stood between him and a quiet life, was one of the great comic characters. Fields was also a great acrobat, all the greater for its being a surprise. The films sometimes stifle the anarchic spark of his laconic delivery, but it is there.\n\n9. Werner Herzog, Aguirre: The Wrath of God —A more truly insane journey into the heart of darkness than Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. Herzog's relationship with Klaus Kinski frequently ran close to self-parody. Here at least they produced something wild and magnificent.\n\n10. Charles Laughton, Night of the Hunter —Alongside Cape Fear this is one of Robert Mitchum's finest moments. It is a brooding and terrifying film, but more striking is the visual poetry that Laughton creates. He never made another film, so we never saw how that vision might have been developed.\n\nHonorable mention: Jacques Tati; Carol Reed, The Fallen Idol; Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, Peeping Tom; Alfred Hitchcock, Strangers on a Train\n\nArtists:\n\n1.

Samuel Beckett\n\nFred Mazelis, WSWS contributing writer (US)\n\nTen favorite composers of the twentieth century:\n\nThis list will be selected from composers of Western classical music who were either born in the twentieth century or who did most of their work after 1900 and whose creative lives were shaped and bound up with this past century.\n\nFor that reason it does not include such major musical figures as Edward Elgar (1857-1934) or Jean Sibelius (1865-1957). These men lived well into the mid-twentieth century or even beyond, but their musical style was formed in the period before 1900, and they generally looked back toward the nineteenth century for the rest of their careers. Giacomo Puccini (1858-1924), the great Italian composer of verismo opera, is a similar case. He worked up until his death, but his most famous works date from just around 1900 ( Tosca) or earlier ( La Bohème, 1896) and he is a nineteenth century figure.\n\nRichard Strauss (1864-1949) is a much harder decision. I think he was a far greater composer than Elgar or Sibelius, although that it not to minimize their own accomplishments. It is also more difficult to categorize Strauss as a nineteenth or twentieth century composer. Elgar died in 1934, and Sibelius stopped composing more than 30 years before his death in 1957. Strauss continued to work until shortly before his death. In fact he was both a nineteenth and twentieth century composer, I would not argue with having him on a list of twentieth century favorites. In the first decade of this century, he composed two operas, Salome and Elektra, that marked a revolutionary break with the nineteenth century. For the rest of his life, his musical language became more conservative, but he continued composing until shortly before his death, and his Four Last Songs is undoubtedly the most sublime music ever created by an 84-year-old.\n\nI have decided not to include Strauss, however. This is partly because it could also then be argued that two others, Claude Debussy (1862-1918) and Gustav Mahler (1860-1911), also belong. Although they did not live very far into the twentieth century, they did much of their work in its first decade, and they had a great impact on music in this past century. Nevertheless, they too were mature composers before the turn of the century. To include Strauss, Debussy and Mahler would slant this list too much toward the first 10 years of the twentieth century.\n\nIt's not accidental that my list appended below concentrates on music composed in the first half of the century. Indeed, only two (Shostakovich and Britten, to some extent Stravinsky) were fairly active into the 1960s or beyond. I listen to the work of more contemporary composers, but I cannot honestly include them in a list of favorites. Nevertheless, I do think this list should be as wide a representation as possible of those first six decades or so of the century.\n\nThe ten composers I would list are as follows:\n\nBéla Bartók (1881-1945). My personal favorite. He synthesized Hungarian folk influences with the most advanced musical trends into a powerful and universal contribution. He developed a completely original style and his work is marked by an emotional depth that rewards serious listening. His six string quartets have been called the greatest contribution to that medium since Beethoven.\n\nDmitri Shostakovich (1906-75) Together with Bartók, a giant of twentieth century music. The subject of heated controversy between opposing critical camps who seek to claim his musical legacy. Shostakovich survived and miraculously developed his art in the darkest decades of Stalinist dictatorship. His large output includes 15 symphonies, 15 string quartets and numerous other chamber works, several operas, half a dozen concertos for piano, violin, or cello, much work for solo piano, and film music.\n\nMaurice Ravel (1875-1937). This French composer, while famous for his overplayed Bolero and Pavane for a Dead Princess, produced far more interesting work. He is well known for his orchestral and piano music, including the Mother Goose Suite, Le Tombeau de Couperin, Daphnis and Chloe Suites, Rapsodie Espagnole, and his Piano Concertos. His melodic inventiveness, rhythmic originality and unusual instrumental combinations stand out. My favorites are his relatively small number of chamber music compositions: the Piano Trio and the String Quartet. Also the original Introduction and Allegro for Harp, Flute, Clarinet and String Quartet.\n\nSergei Prokofiev (1891-1953). Another monumental Soviet figure, Prokofiev emigrated after the Russian Revolution but returned in the early 1930s. Like Shostakovich, his genius was able to survive and transcend the dictates of Stalinist “socialist realism,” even when Prokofiev composed music (the cantata Alexander Nevsky) designed to meet the nationalist requirements of the bureaucracy. Prolific composer of seven symphonies, five piano concerti, two violin concerti, nine piano sonatas, music for the Romeo and Juliet ballet, and much else.\n\nIgor Stravinsky (1882-1971). Another Russian-born musical genius. I do not find the kind of emotional depth in his music that I find in Bartók and Shostakovich, but he is undoubtedly one of the greatest composers of the twentieth century. In the century's second decade he became world famous for his ballets (and the orchestral suites derived from them) Petrouchka and The Firebird. In 1913 The Rite of Spring caused a violent scandal when it was first performed in Paris. These works were followed by a “neoclassical” period in which Stravinsky produced Pulcinella, the Violin Concerto, Jeu de Cartes, Symphony of Psalms and many other works.\n\nAfter these five the choices for me become more difficult. I would include the following, in no particular order of “favoritism.”\n\nFrancis Poulenc (1899-1963). Another French composer, in some respects the developer of the kind of lightness, elegance and sophistication that characterized Maurice Ravel. Poulenc was one of “Les Six,” a term coined by a music critic to refer to a group of French composers linked by a certain common sensibility. Among Poulenc's best known works are Les Biches, a ballet; much chamber music, especially the sextet for piano and winds and the clarinet, flute and oboe sonatas. Also the concerto for piano and concerto for two pianos, and his opera The Dialogues of the Carmelites.\n\nLeos Janacek (1854-1928) Although Janacek was already in his forty-sixth year when the twentieth century dawned, his inclusion in this list is justified by the fact that so much of what he wrote that was original and lasting came after 1900. I find a slight parallel with Bartók, only in the sense that he used folk music (in his case from his native Moravia and elsewhere in what would later become Czechoslovakia) to forge an original and individual style. His opera Jenufa, from 1904, is a great work. Many of the works for which he is most renowned were written in the 1920s, the last decade of his life. These include the operas Katya Kabanova, The Cunning Little Vixen, The Makropoulos Case and From the House of the Dead, his two string quartets, the Sinfonietta, and the Glagolitic Mass.\n\nBenjamin Britten (1913-76). Another original composer, widely known for his many operas, including Billy Budd, Peter Grimes, Death in Venice and A Midsummer Night's Dream. Also the composer of much chamber music, the well-known War Requiem, and other works.\n\nKurt Weill (1900-50). Weill is something of a special case on this list. He was a “serious composer” in his early years who then turned strongly against the principles of serialism and the 12-tone school developed by Arnold Schoenberg. Without necessarily passing final judgment on Weill's views on this question, there is little doubt that he found his own distinctive musical voice in works such as The Threepenny Opera and Mahagonny, working together with the great German dramatist Bertolt Brecht.\n\nBohuslav Martinu (1891-1959). I am including Martinu, another Czech composer, on this list because I am convinced from the relatively little of his music that I have heard that he is greatly underrated. Like Bartók, Weill and many others he fled the Nazis and lived most of the last 20 years of his life in the US, where he became a teacher at Princeton and at the Mannes College of Music in New York. Martinu wrote over 400 works, including much chamber music, many symphonies, and the Three Frescoes after Piero della Francesca.\n\nThis list is not meant to be “definitive” or all-inclusive in any way. Various others, from very different traditions, who could have been placed on it or who deserve mention, include the Americans Aaron Copland, George Gershwin, Henry Cowell and Lou Harrison, the British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, the Brazilian Heitor Villa Lobos, and the French composers Darius Milhaud and Olivier Messiaen.\n\nPeter Mazelis, WSWS contributing writer (US)\n\nFavorite films, in chronological order:\n\n1.

In the end I decided not to worry whether they were major or minor poets, but to confine myself to personal taste. In English alone, there are so many others of interest, but if I have not made any excursions into their work I have not included them.\n\n1. Guillaume Apollinaire, friend of Braque and Picasso, supposed to have coined the term “surrealisme,” wounded in World War One in the French Army, dead of influenza in 1918; for his poems “Zone,” “Song of the Poorly Loved” and “At the Santé” written when he was imprisoned in the Santé, falsely accused of stealing the Mona Lisa. He once wrote deprecatingly: “Not because rooted in poetry we have the power of words forming and deforming the universe” (song at the wedding of André Salmon).\n\nIt seems he had a great influence on the American Beat poets. Allen Ginsberg wrote 50 years later in “At Apollinaire's Grave”\n\nOne must have felt the shock in St. Germain when he went out\n\nJacob and Picasso coughing in the dark\n\na bandage unrolled and the skull left still on a bed outstretched\n\npudgy fingers the mystery and ego gone\n\n2. W. H. Auden: Apart from his own poetry, his critical writings about other poets in “The Dyers Hand” and “Forewords and Afterwords” are a rich source of thoughtful insights. Writing of Greek poet C. P. Cafavy, he said: “Like everybody else, I think, who writes poetry, I have always believed the essential difference between prose and poetry to be that prose can be translated into another tongue, but poetry cannot. But if it is possible to be poetically influenced by work which one can read only in translation, this belief must be qualified.”\n\n3. I cannot bypass T. S. Eliot, although not without misgivings. “The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock” must have one of the most arresting beginnings of any poem this century:\n\nLet us go then, you and I,\n\nWhen the evening is spread out against the sky,\n\nLike a patient etherised upon a table;\n\nLet us go through certain half-deserted streets\n\nThis is like an eerie entryway that leads directly to London in the second decade of this century.\n\n4. Seamus Heaney: “Tollund Man” is about Denmark and the bog people buried in the peat. He identifies with the sacrificial victims.\n\nSomething of his sad freedom\n\nAs he rode the tumbril\n\nShould come to me, driving\n\nSaying the names\n\n5. Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath: Some of their poems complement one another, for example Plath's 1957 poem “The Lady and the Earthenware Head” and Hughes' version “The Earthenware Head”:\n\nYou ransacked thesaurus in your poem about it,\n\nVeiling its mirror, rhyming yourself into safety\n\nFrom its orphaned fate.\n\nIn 1953 as a young student Plath interviewed eminent poet Marianne Moore for Mademoiselle magazine. In 1958 she took Hughes to New York and introduced him to Moore, who became a literary sponsor for him. In “The Literary Life” Hughes describes the visit and later Moore's response to Plath's suicide:\n\nAnd I listened, heavy as a graveyard\n\nWhile she searched for the grave\n\nWhere she could lay down her little wreath.\n\n6. D. H. Lawrence: His poems about animals and plants are like delicate drawings. And for sheer nasty spleen, “How Beastly the Bourgeois Is” is unbeatable.\n\nHow beastly the bourgeois is\n\nEspecially the male of the species —\n\nNicely groomed, like a mushroom\n\nStanding there so sleek and erect and eyeable —\n\nAnd like a fungus, living on the remains of bygone life\n\nSucking his life out of the dead leaves of greater life than his own.\n\n7. Robert Lowell: “Memories of West Street and Lepke” about 1943 when he went to prison as a conscientious objector against the Allied bombing of civilians in Europe. It deflects its glance from the imprisoned Jehovah's Witness to fellow prisoner crime czar Lepke waiting to die.\n\n8. Edgar Lee Masters —there is something compelling about the self-sufficiency, indeed insularity of his “Spoon River Anthology” (1915), in which the townsfolk talk from the grave and provide epitaphs for themselves. Masters seems like an old curmudgeon, but the voices swell together in a chorus evoking the despair and low key tragedy of the town. The songs echo plaintively in the memory for a long while.\n\n9. The World War One poets. It does not do them justice to lump them all together, but I have run out of places. Owen, Rosenberg are the finest poets of the trenches. Sassoon catches moments of ineffable sadness and nostalgia as in “A Concert Party (Egyptian Base Camp)”:\n\nDimness conceals the hunger in our faces\n\nThis wall of faces risen out of the night,\n\nThose eyes that keep their memories of the places\n\nSo long beyond their sight.\n\n10. From W. B. Yeats, it is not a representative sample, but I would choose “An Irish Airman Foresees his Death,” “Easter 1916” for its pen portraits of the revolutionaries, “On a Political Prisoner” about Lady Constance Markiewicz.\n\nWhen long ago I saw her ride\n\nUnder Ben Bulben to the meet,\n\nThe beauty of her countryside\n\nWith all youth's lonely wildness stirred\n\nFavourite Australasian fiction:\n\nHere my bias is definitely towards the first half of the century.\n\n1. Streets ahead of any other Australian writer is Christina Stead. The Man who Loved Children, set in Washington, DC, is a haunting portrait of a man whose benevolent philosophic views about raising children destroy his family. It is told by his eldest daughter, somewhat of an outcast since he has had a second family.\n\nStead also wrote For Love Alone, which is a thinly fictionalised version of her own escape from inter war Australia to Europe. Other works include Seven Poor Men of Sydney.\n\n2. Another expatriate, this time from New Zealand, is Katherine Mansfield, a master of style. For her short stories “Bliss,” “In a German Pension” and novel, Prelude.\n\n3. A number of Australian writers have focused on the theme of interaction between European settlers and Aboriginal inhabitants. Xavier Herbert did so in Capricornia and Poor Fellow My Country which are rambling masterpieces. Another interesting book is his autobiographical reminiscences known as Disturbing Element.\n\n4. Katherine Susannah Pritchard: Coonardoo also has an Aboriginal girl as its tragic heroine. Pritchard, a member of the Communist Party, wrote for the huge audience in the USSR about the social relations in outback Western Australia. While the book has its mawkish aspects, she manages to give the story bold outlines.\n\n5. Nene Gare: The Fringe Dwellers is set in shanty towns on the edge of Perth.\n\n6. Hal Porter: Watcher on a Cast Iron Balcony is the autobiography of a young man growing up in a country town in the 1930s and his desperation at the lack of culture.\n\n7. Criena Rohan: Down by the Dockside is a picaresque novel about a young woman trying to survive by her wits during World War II.\n\n8. Janet Frame: Envoy from Mirror City and other parts of her autobiography. In New Zealand Frame was subjected to years of psychiatric treatment simply for being different. In this book she details her escape from that claustrophobic existence to Europe.\n\n9. Dorothy Hewett: Bobbin' Up. Hewett is better known as a playwright. This is an earlier novel about women in a textile factory, with distinct social realist characteristics, despite which an irrepressible larrikin element insistently bursts through.\n\n10. Frank Hardy: Power Without Glory —the portrait of a self-made magnate. It seems this book was much more of a team effort than Hardy ever admitted, with the Communist Party providing a research team and facilities for Hardy to write it. It is an interesting achievement, although Hardy is more of a raconteur than a great writer.\n\nJeff Riedel, photographer (US)\n\nPhotographers who have been an inspiration:\n\n1.

A two-handed piece which is utterly absorbing from start to finish.\n\n2. Alban Berg— Wozzeck (1923), based on a play by Georg Büchner, which was written in the 1830s and tells how a simple infantryman is driven to murder and suicide by the intolerable conditions of his life.\n\n3. Leos Janacek— Sinfonietta (1926)\n\n4. Kurt Weill—all the music he wrote before he left Germany in the 1930s, especially The Three-Penny Opera (1928) and The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny (1930).\n\n5. Hans Eisler—all his songs, especially the settings of words by Bertolt Brecht, written in the 1920s and 30s. There is a good collection of these songs— The Brecht-Eisler Song Book —published by Oak Publications New York. I don't know if it's still available\n\n6. Leonard Bernstein— West Side Story\n\n7.

Thelonious Monk\n\n4. Erroll Garner\n\nGerald Somers, painter (Canada)\n\nPainters:\n\n1 and 2. Henri Matisse and Paul Cézanne: while both artists are firmly rooted in the last century, their heads poke into the twentieth, and their work, proto-Modernist, laid the foundation for the dramatic break with tradition that modernity ushered in;\n\n3. Kasimir Malevich: a default Russian, interchangeable with a couple of others from the same Suprematist period; unequivocally, radically modern work, nicely balanced conceptual and spiritual dimensions; perhaps Kandinsky should be in there as well;\n\n4. The dadaist, Hugo Ball;\n\n5. Pablo Picasso; grudgingly, since his legacy is so bound up with postwar American cultural imperialism; but for his sheer appetite alone;\n\n6. Barnett Newman, a nice crossover of Abstract Expressionism and the Minimalism which followed;\n\n7. Richard Hamilton gives us pop art, pre-Warhol with more honest, earnest irony than the latter;\n\n8. We'll need someone from Conceptualism; I nominate Joseph Beuys but others would do;\n\n9 and 10. Fast forward to so-called postmodernism with subheadings for the Italian transavant-garde, and German-American neo-expressionism; criticisms of its market-driven cynicism notwithstanding, I believe Francesco Clemente has survived the test of time; now one more, how about Cindy Sherman?\n\nHonorable mention: Sigmar Polke; or the Canadian photo-artist Jeff Wall; too many names missing, where are Marcel Duchamp, Robert Rauschenberg, Hans Richter, etc.?; but not enough space.\n\nSculptors:\n\n1. and 2. I'm much weaker on sculptors, but let's have a go, abandoning the historical order of the above list; from the Americans, Bruce Nauman, American contemporary, strong conceptual roots with engaging, populist appeal, humour; James Turrell, whose work with light is simply stunning, far better than the exercises of Dan Flavin;\n\n3. Perhaps that neurotic fellow who's always wrapping things, Christo, a sort of one-hit wonder who won't go away; no, let's not; instead, Claes Oldenburg, yes.\n\n4-8. The German political Hans Haacke; from England, the brilliant, crosscultural Anish Kapoor, also Anthony Caro and Tony Cragg; Richard Serra gets in despite himself, but could be swapped out for Richard Long with his walks;\n\n9. and 10. The French sculptor Louise Bourgeois and the Russian installation artist Ilya Kabakov.\n\nStefan Steinberg, WSWS contributing writer (Germany)\n\nFavourite films:\n\n1.

American Pastoral by Philip Roth\n\nAlex Steiner, WSWS contributing writer (US)\n\nFavorite non-fiction books of the twentieth century:\n\n1. Leon Trotsky, History of the Russian Revolution\n\nTrotsky's book is not only the most significant historical analysis of the greatest event of modern times, it is also a literary masterpiece.\n\nThe preface, written when Trotsky was already in exile in Prinkipo, is at once scientific and romantic, giving life to the dry language often associated with a historical narrative.\n\n“The most indubitable feature of a revolution is the direct interference of the masses in historic events. In ordinary times the state, be it monarchical or democratic, elevates itself above the nation, and history is made by specialists in that line of business—kings, ministers, bureaucrats, parliamentarians, journalists. But at those crucial moments when the old order becomes no longer endurable to the masses, they break over the barriers excluding them from the political arena, sweep aside their traditional representatives, and create by their interference the initial groundwork for a new regime.... The history of a revolution is for us first of all a history of the forcible entrance of the masses into the realm of rulership over their own destiny.”\n\n2. C. L. R. James, The Black Jacobins\n\nJames's history of one of the first successful revolutions against colonialism and slavery is an enduring classic that can be read over many times.\n\n3. Georg Lukács, History and Class Consciousness\n\nTo be sure, there are many problems with this book, both philosophical and political. It can not be denied however that its presentation of Marxism as the antithesis of dogmatism and mechanical materialism represented a milestone in the retrieval of Marxist philosophy from the decay of the Social Democracy. Unfortunately, Lukacs abandoned the critique of Stalinism that was logically demanded in his work once he made his peace with the bureaucracy. The book had a profound influence on many intellectuals in the West.\n\n4. Alexandre Kojeve, Introduction to the Reading of Hegel\n\nKojeve's classic lectures gave new life to the Hegelian dialectic for an entire generation of French intellectuals in the interwar years. His analysis of the dialectic of Master and Slave in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit remains an unsurpassed tour-de-force. Although Kojeve's methodology is hardly Marxist, as it is often mistakenly described, it does fill out some of the obscurity of Hegel's original text with the living struggles of human history. In contrast, most of Kojeve's detractors seek to suppress the historical and social dimension of the Master/Slave dialectic for fear of contaminating Hegel with a Marxian brush. While he does take some liberties with Hegel, Kojeve's idiosyncratic interpretation still shines out against the toothless epistemological or psychological versions of his opponents.\n\n5. Walter Benjamin, Illuminations\n\nThis book of essays only give the barest impression of the wide range of Benjamin's interests, which included collecting toys, handwriting analysis, literary criticism and philosophy. It does include Benjamin's classic essay, “Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.”\n\n6. Bertrand Russell, Why I am Not a Christian\n\nAlthough I have long since parted company with Russell on philosophical and political grounds this was the first book I read that presented the case for atheism on philosophical grounds. It is a lively and popular debunking of Christian hokum and still remains one of my favorites.\n\n7. H. L. Mencken, The American Scene\n\nThis collection of essays by the great curmudgeon of the Depression contains one of my all-time favorites, “In Memoriam: W. J. B.” This obituary to William Jennings Bryan, one-time populist and self-styled leader of religious ignorance and yahooism, is dripping with contempt for the cultural backwardness Bryan championed. Mencken, unlike his right-wing epigones, was the genuine article. He conceded nothing to the hypocrites and philistines of his time. Instead of polite sentiments, Mencken's obituary contains the following bit of bile:\n\n“This talk of sincerity, I confess, fatigues me. If the fellow was sincere, then so was P. T. Barnum. The word is disgraced and degraded by such use. He was, in fact, a charlatan, a mountebank, a zany without sense or dignity.”\n\nYou just cannot improve on that.\n\n8. Ernst Bloch, Natural Law and Human Dignity\n\nA most original interpretation of 2,500 years in the history of philosophy. Bloch reads this history as an ever richer expression of man's striving for liberty, equality and fraternity, ideals which find their most concrete expression in a social utopia. Bloch's optimism stands in stark contrast to the philosophy of death and despair championed by his contemporary and fellow German philosopher, Heidegger.\n\n9. Ferdinand Lundberg, America's 60 Families\n\nLundberg was a Depression-era muckraker who assembled an impressive array of data to demonstrate the class nature of power in the United States. Although he was neither a great stylist nor a theoretician, his book strips away the real forces at work behind the veil of official democratic pretense. His introduction poses the issue starkly in language that has never been surpassed.\n\n“The United States is owned and dominated today by a hierarchy of its sixty richest families, buttressed by no more than ninety families of lesser wealth.... These families are the living center of the modern industrial oligarchy which dominates the Unites States, functioning discreetly under a de jure democratic form of government behind which a de facto government, absolutist and plutocratic in its lineaments, has gradually taken form since the Civil War. This de facto government is actually the government of the United States—informal, invisible, shadowy. It is the government of money in a dollar democracy.”\n\n10. Hannah Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem\n\nAlthough I have lots of problems with some of Arendt's historical analysis in this account of Adolf Eichmann's trial in the 1960s, her portrait of the Nazi apparatchnik who was most directly responsible for the machinery of death of the Holocaust is unforgettable. Her historically accurate account of the collaboration of some Jewish leaders with the Nazis touched many raw nerves among the various Jewish organizations. Rather than a frank reassessment of their own history, they preferred to wage a campaign of ostracism against Arendt and her message.\n\nTim Tower, WSWS contributing writer (US)\n\nThese are a few favorites from the twentieth century.

Amaradeva: One of the foremost musicians and Sinhala singers of this century. He is one of the major contributors to the building of a more serious tradition of song and music in Sri Lanka. The country is bereft of a historically inherited tradition of music due to the corrosive influence of Buddhism on the arts.\n\nBuddhism as a religion regards all sensual pleasures, including dance, song and drama, as inimical to the attainment of Nirvana and regards these pleasures as generating a craving for life and existence (‘bava thanha'). Only the influence of western Enlightenment thought and Marxism provided the necessary impetus for Sri Lankan artists—though most of them were unable to digest either of these ideological forces satisfactorily—to free their minds, at least relatively, of the shackles of feudal thought.\n\n2. Ediriweera Sarachchandra: A significant personality in the field of Sri Lankan arts during this century, Sarachchandra is regarded as the founder of the modern dramatic arts. Again due to the oppressive ideological influence of Buddhism, Sri Lanka also lacks a historically inherited tradition of drama. Sarachchandra, in his endeavor to build up a tradition of Sinhala dramatic art, drew inspiration from folk traditions as well as from the rich dramatic traditions in ancient India, Japan and China.\n\nSarachchandra belongs to a group of artists who in the 1950s and 60s made their base of cultural activity the Peradeniya University of Sri Lanka, and became the leader of the Peradeniya Group of Artists. This group was instrumental in introducing Western influences into the Sri Lankan literary scene.\n\nThe major dramatic works of Sarachchandra are Maname (1956) and Sinhabahu (1961), remarkable for the poignancy they generate. An extremely poetic rendering of human emotions and aspirations have made these works memorable, and it is possible to find among music lovers in Sri Lanka any number of people who know by heart lengthy portions of these two dramatic works.\n\nThe themes of these two plays consist of the conflict between the individual and social institutions in class society.\n\n3. Siri Gunasingha: Major poet and novelist belonging to the Peradeniya group of artists. His novel Hevanella (1960 [ The Shadow]) is a powerful artistic indictment of the destructive influence on the individual of both Buddhist ideology and the bourgeois social system. His major poetical works are Abinikmana (1958 [ Renunciation]) and Mas-le-Nethi-Ata [ Bones that have dried up].\n\nGunasingha won critical acclaim for advancing the Sinhala poetic tradition by enriching the poetic idiom. His poetical works impress one with their daring innovative creation of imagery. Sinhala poetic idiom acquired the richness and flexibility necessary to portray the rapidly changing reality mainly through his efforts. Gunasingha can meaningfully be called the “angry poet” of modern Sinhala poetry, the recurring themes in his poetical works being his passionate resistance to both feudal and bourgeois ideology as well as the decadent system of present-day society. Unfortunately, he never found any alternatives to the social factors he reviled so insistently.\n\n4. and 5. Martin Wickramasingha and Gunadasa Amarasekera both stand out as creators of artistic novels, which provide deep insights into a society undergoing decisive changes from a feudal set-up to capitalism.\n\nWickramasingha's Gamperaliya (1944 [ The transformation in the village]) was the first Sinhala novel in the realistic tradition.\n\n6. Lester James Peries: One of the foremost Sri Lankan filmmakers, Peries is honored for being the creator of the first artistic Sinhala film Rekhava (1956 [ The line]). Until Rekhava Sinhala cinema remained merely a form of popular entertainment. Peries' film Gamperaliya (1963, the film version of Wickramasingha's novel Gamperaliya) was the first Sinhala film to gain international critical acclaim.\n\n7. Rukmani Devi: The “heart throb” of many a film-goer in the late 1940s and 50s and to this day beloved by music lovers of Sri Lanka for her versatile talent as a singer. She died under tragic circumstances in a car accident some years ago, but lives on in the memory of music lovers—her glory and popularity as an artist never to be diminished by new entrants to the film and music scene.\n\n8. Nanda Malinee: One of the foremost Sinhala female singers of Sri Lanka, Nanda Malinee's voice miraculously carries within it the power to render melodiously the joys and sorrows felt by generations of Sinhala people, as they lived and tilled their land in villages still faintly reminiscent of the feudal era.\n\n9. Dharmasena Pathiraja: Belongs to the younger generation of Sinhala film artists and was specially active in the Sinhala film scene during the 1970s and 80s.\n\nThe recurring theme of his films was the social tribulations of the downtrodden layers in society, including the unemployed youth. His artistic technique was described by some critics as “Brechtian.”\n\nAmong Pathiraja's many films, Para Dige ( Along the road) and Bambaru Avith (The wasps are here) won Marxist critical acclaim.\n\n10. Bhava Duka ( The sorrows of existence) and Bhava Karma (Reaping results of deeds accomplished in prior lives)\n\nThese two films directed by Dharmasiri Bandaranayaka deserve special mention.
