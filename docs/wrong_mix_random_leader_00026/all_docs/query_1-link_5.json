        "text": "What began as a partially collapsed building on Sunday afternoon has quickly become a recovery operation in downtown Davenport. Control of the site has been turned over to the Davenport Development and Neighborhood Services Department, and the owner of the property was served with a notice ordering the property to be demolished.\n\nResidents of the building will not be allowed back in, due to unstable conditions and the interest of their own safety, according to a news release from the city.\n\nHere's a look at the latest details we know:\n\nWhen and where did The Davenport apartment building collapse?\n\nPart of an apartment building collapsed around 5 p.m. Sunday, May 28, 2023 in downtown Davenport, at 324 Main Street. Monday morning at approximately 9:45 a.m., the Davenport Fire Department transitioned the scene into a recovery operation.\n\nHave there been any reported deaths from the apartment collapse?\n\nDavenport Mayor Mike Matson said that rescuers with search dogs worked through the first night, but were unable to find any remains. Nearly a week later, the first death was confirmed on Saturday, June 3.\n\nThe latest: Davenport officials look to resume search of collapsed building after survivor is found\n\nThree tenants were trapped under the rubble of The Davenport\n\nIt was reported that residents had been trapped inside the building when it collapsed on Sunday evening. Rescue crews helped several people out of the building on Sunday evening and have conducted multiple searches for other survivors and pets.\n\nFriends and family gathered outside the building on Monday were still trying to determine what happened to loved ones who lived in the building.\n\nAfter many searches and efforts to shore up the building, three bodies have been found since Saturday, June 5.\n\nFrom Monday: After Davenport building collapse, frustrated families say loved ones still missing\n\nIs anyone still missing from the Iowa building collapse?\n\nThe Quad City Times reported that Lisa Brooks, whose relatives had been gathered outside the building, saying she was missing, had been rescued Monday, May 29 after she called a relative on her cell phone.\n\nMatson said at a Tuesday. May 30 news conference that he was, \"so thankful,\" Brooks was found safe and alive, and hopes the same for other missing individuals.\n\nOriginally, authorities believed five missing residents were missing. It was announced Thursday, June 1 during a media briefing that two had been found in other locations, and only three individuals remained unaccounted for.\n\nThursday update: 3 residents of Davenport building collapse still unaccounted for, 2 found are safe\n\nAmy Anderson, one of Hitchcock's relatives, said in a Tuesday conference that the family met with city officials Monday night, and were \"mortified\" to see individuals protesting.\n\n\"I plead with our community, let the city do their job,\" Anderson said.\n\nBodies of Branden Colvin, Ryan Hitchcock and Daniel Prien recovered from debris of collapsed building\n\nBranden Colvin, 42, was the first person confirmed to have died in The Davenport collapse. City spokeswoman Sarah Ott said his body was recovered Saturday.\n\nCity officials announced Monday that the body of Ryan Hitchcock was recovered on Sunday and Daniel Prien early Monday morning. Searching for their remains has proven to be increasingly dangerous, as the apartment building was constantly in motion during the first 24 to 36 hours.\n\nMore: 3 bodies recovered at Davenport building collapse; survivor files lawsuit\n\nHow did first responders searched for missing people?\n\nPolice and rescue teams used six trained rescue dogs and surveillance drones to search rubble in hopes of finding missing victims. While crews hope to search other parts of the building, search throughout the rubble has been suspended due to structural engineers' concern for the safety of the first responders and the building's integrity.\n\nAt least 150 rescue personnel have participated in the efforts since the building collapsed Sunday, said Davenport Fire Chief Michael Carlsten. Thermal and infrared imaging were also used to try to find signs of life in the building.\n\nAn Iowa task force has completed a search for survivors at the building site, and is moving ahead to revise the structural safety so it can begin recovery efforts, authorities said Friday morning.\n\nThe state task force's goals were to first search for survivors and then secure the structure, according Rick Halleran, the chief of the task force’s Cedar Rapids division. The search was completed Thursday evening.\n\nWho owns the collapsed Davenport building?\n\nAccording to Scott County records, the apartment building is owned by Davenport Hotel LLC, which is associated with Andrew Wold.\n\nWill Andrew Wold face charges?\n\nCity officials said they have been in contact with Wold, but have yet to determine if there is cause for a criminal investigation.\n\nHowever, Wold was issued a civil infraction citation. In a filing in Scott County Court, the city alleges that Wold's Davenport Hotel LLC violated a section of the Davenport Municipal Code that requires owners maintain buildings and structures in a safe and sanitary condition and in a sound structural position. If found guilty, the business faces a fine of $300 plus court costs of $95.\n\nMore: Owner Andrew Wold fined $300 by city after Davenport building collapse\n\nWas there a history of issues at The Davenport?\n\nThe city declared the building a nuisance in May 2022 “due to numerous solid waste violations” involving its overflowing dumpster, court records show.\n\nWold did not contest the nuisance declaration and inspectors noted similar problems 19 times between then and March 2023, records show. The city took civil enforcement action, and a judge ordered Wold to pay a $4,500 penalty after he did not appear in court.\n\nCity inspectors reviewed the ongoing repairs three days before the collapse, records show. Plans called for replacing 100 feet of brick to comply with city code starting May 25, and an interior cinder block wall with rebar and grout was partially installed as of last week, according to online inspection and permitting notes.\n\nWhen will demolition begin?\n\nCity officials have been continually evaluating the timing of the demolition of 324 Main Street, said Sarah Ott. a city spokesperson, in a news release.\n\nDemolition is a multi-phase process that includes permits and equipment staging that began yesterday. The timing of the demolition is still being evaluated, although the building is still in imminent danger of collapse.\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday morning, Fire Marshall James Morris confirmed officials are still evaluating the best options for additional searching, and coordinating with structural engineers to work to continually assess the building.\n\n\"It's not the fact that we don't want to do this … We want to do this in a safe manner,\" Morris said.\n\nThere is currently no firm demolition timeline.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issues disaster proclamation to assist victims of The Davenport collapse\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds has issued a disaster proclamation for Scott County in response to the collapse of The Davenport. The proclamation activates the Iowa Individual Assistance Grant Program and the Disaster Case Management Program for those residents who have been impacted.\n\nThe Iowa Individual Assistance Grant Program provides grants of up to $5,000 for households with incomes up to 200% of the federal property level, according to a news release from the office of the governor. For a single-person household, 200% of the federal poverty level of 2023-2024 would be $29,160, but for a family of four, it is $60,000.\n\nThe grant application and instructions are available on the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services website: https://hhs.iowa.gov/disaster-assistance-programs. Those applying have 45 days from the date of the proclamation to submit a claim and will need original receipts.\n\nThe city of Davenport has also launched a separate fund offering up to $6,000 to residents and providing funds for displaced businesses.\n\nWhere are misplaced residents going?\n\nResidents who were misplaced can receive assistance through the Red Cross and Salvation Army:\n\nRed Cross, 1-800-REDCROSS\n\nSalvation Army, open 8:30 a.m.-4 p.m. at 100 Kirkwood Blvd in Davenport, 563-324-4808\n\nHow can you help victims of The Davenport building collapse?\n\nCommunity members wishing to make donations to those in need can do so through the Quad Cities Community Foundation or through the Salvation Army, Ott said.\n\nThe Quad Cities Community Foundation has opened its disaster recovery fund to assist residents who have been displaced: www.qccommunityfoundation.org/qcdisasterrecovery\n\nDavenport Salvation Army will assist in collecting donations for residents that were displaced.
