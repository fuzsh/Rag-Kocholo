        "text": "Davenport, city, seat (1838) of Scott county, eastern Iowa, U.S. It lies on the north bank of the Mississippi River and is the largest of the Quad Cities, an urban complex that includes neighbouring Bettendorf to the east and Moline and Rock Island across the river in Illinois. Credit Island, now a park, was a battlefield in the War of 1812; Fort Armstrong (restored) was established on Rock Island in 1816.\n\nFox (Sauk and Mesquakie) Indians inhabited the region in the early 19th century. Antoine LeClaire acquired the site—originally called (its Native American name) Oskosh and later Morgan—after the treaty ending the Black Hawk War (1832) was signed there; he then sold it to a fur trading company headed by Colonel George Davenport. The first railroad bridge to span the Mississippi River was opened at Davenport in 1856, and the development of both river and rail transportation assured the city’s growth as a trading centre."
