You can also receive the actual programs for a given day via the news letter.

Fukushima is Japanese, granted, but she plays her violin like Paganini (oh, yet another Italian), that means mostly like classical music. But that would be too simple. She also wanders into American folk music and if that wasnt enough, her Japanese built-in Kabuki burst out at unexpected moments. Angeli is Italian or more precisely Sardinian. He plays guitar but in two radically different ways that you would expect a guitar to be played. First of all he plays it by holding it vertically like a cello and secondly he mostly uses bowing rather than plucking. The result of this fusion is pleasant with enough disturbances like elements of Rock and Free Jazz to keep a commercial radio station at bay. Tonight, we will survey their Itsunomanika CD recorded in Italy.\n\nProgram schedule for the month of October 2012\n\nOctober 31st, 2012: Special funding drive mix\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien:Tonight is the second and last night of CKCU-FM RWAC funding drive. We have a cross-selection of artist that we featured over the last year and that we will feature in the coming year. This includes:\n\n· William Parker\n\n· Lina Allemano\n\n· Alexander von Schlippenbach\n\n· Michael McNeill\n\n· John Zorn & Fred Frith\n\n· Megan Jerome\n\n· Serguey Kuryokhin\n\n· Urs Leimgruber & Evan Parker\n\nOctober 24th, 2012: Toronto guitarist Ken Aldcroft\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: For the last decade, Vancouver born guitarist Ken Aldcroft has been working at the Toronto Jazz Scene in many ways. He developed an interesting distinctive sound making his electric guitar sound somewhat acoustic. On the stylistic side, Aldcroft explores many different styles of Jazz. Tonight we will sample four of his CDs in preparation of his show at IMOO this coming Sunday:\n\n1. Home, featuring solo guitar compositions with a strong folk music influence\n\n2. Hat & Beard in a duo with drummer Dave Clark that explores the music of Thelonious Monk.\n\n3. One Sunday, a duo with the great NYC bass player William Parker.\n\n4. Notes of the Miasms in a duo with saxophonist Andy Haas.\n\nOctober 17th, 2012: Russian avant-garde: Alexey Kruglov and Vladimir Tarasov\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Avant-garde Jazz in Russia has gone through a parallel process to the political and economic changes that led to the collapse of the former Soviet Union. Before, Free-Jazz was a way to shock the musical establishment that was mainly centered on either official classical music or folk music, the music of the people after all. Back then, musicians like the late Sergey Kuryokhin went to great length to shock the public using for instance a band composed of real pigs or entitling his projects like Lenin Was A Mushroom. Today and over the last decade, Russian avant-garde nicely melted with its counterpart in the rest of the world with considerably more tamed projects very comparable to what you can hear even here in Ottawa at the remarkable IMOO series but also conceptually somewhat going back to the roots of Russian avant-garde as far back as the music of great Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. Some critics even talk about very concrete and well thought constructions mixing all the characteristics of avant-garde improvised music like irony, meditative, aggressive, explosive, drawing from the sounds of nature and as many theatrical sounds you can imagine. More important is the fact that Russian avant-garde musicians are not isolated. They perform frequently with their western counterparts. Drummer Tarasov performs frequently with Andrew Cyrille, Joelle Leandre, Anthony Braxton and many others. Also, they now face exactly the same consumerism hurdles as their western counterparts. Tonight, we will sample their Dialogos CD on the Solyd records label, a very Russian impressionistic recording where the duo draws as many sounds as possible from a vast collection of reed and percussion instruments.

I stayed with saxophonist Frank Paul Schubert and after a couple of days of two hour sessions of duo practices we decided to hit the town which in Berlin is a very natural thing. Berlin, which has the highest unemployment rate in Germany has become a major musical tourist attraction. Tourists come from all over the world to see shows of all kinds, from classical music to Rock to Jazz and even Free-Jazz. Thus one could say that in this vibrant city of Berlin, music saves the show! That night, guitarist Olaf Rupp was playing in one of the zillions of Berlin art galleries that feature avant-garde Jazz among other styles of music. Olaf Rupp has an impressive trail of 30 CDs over a decade that started with the famous FMP label. I quickly realized that I was facing something new to me. Olaf Rupp has developed a unique technique on the guitar. First of all, he holds his guitar vertically like a Chinese pipa. Then, he uses all of the well-known guitar plucking like rasgueado, arpeggio and tremolos in continuously changing musical elements. Somehow he seems to have developed an independence of each individual finger on the right hand that allow him to build parallel rather than linear musical elements whether they are melodic lines, chords or clusters but more important all in a virtuoso speed. Olaf Rupps music is also a visual experience. See the following web sites not to mention youtube: http://www.audiosemantics.de/ http://www.olafrupp.de/ Tonight, we will review some of his solo improvisation as well as collaborations with saxophonist Frank Paul Schubert on the qliqq label.\n\nOctober 3d, 2012: a preview of IMOO-Fest\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: The Improvising Musicians of Ottawa/Outaouais just turned 2 years of existence with over 60 concerts under the belt. This longevity is probably the result of a pragmatic approach to the problem of the 1%. Improvised music, the statistics say has only 1% of market share. Thus, curators Linsey Wellman and Craig Pedersen seconded by Renée Yoxon on the communication side ended up focusing on one concept: make it small and see what happens. But this may not be enough. The second most important factor of this two year success is probably a well-oiled network of interconnected high caliber travelling improvised music troubadours that dont mind stopping over at the UMI café at IMOO to perform in front of a couple dozen spectators (maximum capacity) not to forget a string of talented local free improvisers. The best example was two weeks ago with Huntsville, a group coming as far away as Norway (6500 km away) on its way to the well-established Guelph Jazz Festival. Finally, this case of micro-economy of course resolves at the cash register. The $5 donation suggestion is low enough to encourage people to donate without restraint but also more important, to come back.\n\nThis week, IMOO will feature its first micro-festival, IMOO-Fest at Club Saw on Friday and Saturday evenings. Club Saw has about double the capacity than the UMI café. Like any festival, there will be some high profile bills such as Montreal internationally renowned improviser and clarinetist Lori Freedman and equally internationally renowned but fortunately for us now local percussionist Jesse Steward. This in addition of an array of local groups that have made some sensation during the IMOO two concerts per month series over these past two years. All of this will be combined into a perfect melting pot: the IMOO-Orchestra directed this time by clarinetist Lori Freedman that apparently is writing us some arrangements in addition to its directed improvisation principle\n\nTonight, the IMOO curators will be in the studio and entertain you as usual answering my inquisitive questions.\n\nRoddy Ellias with Adrian Vedady and John Fabroni at GigSpace, a short concert review\n\nGigSpace is the place where you can avoid fork and knives white noise and instead take a full bite of music thanks in part to the fact that GigSpace is a converted recording studio but may be more because its owner/artistic directors are also very professional musicians. Thus, its acoustics are just ideal and everything is done from a musicians point of view. Combine this with a new series featuring Roddy Ellias and your entertainment dollar may experience an upsurge of ROI (return on investment). Last Saturday, Roddy Ellias opened the series in a trio setting with Montreal bassist Adrian Vedady and drummer John Fraboni. First reason to attend a concert by Roddy Ellias: Roddy is a double agent, one foot in Chamber Music another one in Jazz, thus, sooner or later both musical styles end up mixing. However, a good mix may not be enough. In this case, it appears that Roddy has benefited from this experience and developed a unique skill of transforming one music to the other and vice-versa. But this is not exactly what I heard last Saturday. Instead, the concept of transformation was applied at a completely different level. The most striking example for me that night was the interpretation of Duke Ellingtons In a Sentimental Mood, one of my favorite tunes since hearing Archie Shepps version back in the 60s. As you all know, this is a least a beautiful composition but also a worn out standard by now. Roddy started with a very pro-forma interpretation quasi à la Joe Pass to soon replace a few notes with other notes that almost turned it into a new composition with lots of surprises if it wasnt for the constant reminder at unexpected moments that he was still playing In a Sentimental Mood, sort of a surprising anti-surprise strategy. At times, the music sounded like the equivalent of seeing your picture in a distortion mirrors at country fair attractions. Thus, Roddy playing standards is the ultimate deception for people with straight ahead tastes. It is only a jumping board to the wildest explorations in melodic and harmonic derivations. There is a lot of freedom in Roddy Ellias playing, including the use of space so typical of Thelonious Monk not to mention the use of dissonances. One Problem with Roddy Ellias: there are only a few CDs available. Reason: Roddy complains about not having enough gigs with the band of his choice to polish a project and bring it to recording (read too busy on the heavily sponsored Chamber Music side ). He is just a perfectionist! What I heard last Saturday with this trio (a now steady trio) could have produced a very enjoyable CD, both for the 99% straight ahead and the 1% avant-garde crowds. Thus, see for yourself and just attend one of the next concerts in that series, next concert is on October 20th with Petr Cancura. Last chance, April 20th 2013.\n\nProgram schedule for the month of September 2012\n\nSeptember 26th, 2012: Ottawa guitarist Tim Bedner\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: For some obscure reasons, Ottawa seems to attract top Jazz musicians. Guitarist Tim Bedner left an 8 year position of adjunct professor at Pittsburgh Duquesne University to move to Ottawa where he performs in all kinds of settings besides his day gig jobs as educator both at Carleton University and the private Alcorn Music Studios. He has an interest for the avant-garde as his association with Oliver Lake and more recently a performance at the IMOO series testifies. Tonight, Tim will be in the studio to talk about his latest CD, of Light and Shadow and his various involvements in performance and cultivating a Jazz venue, GigSpace that many people dont seem to know about but that is an ideal venue for listening to Jazz without fork and knives noise interference.\n\nSeptember 19th, 2012: Summer Jazz part II: An Evening at the St-Emilion Jazz Festival\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien & Peter Hum: By coincidence, our Ottawa Citizen friend Peter Hum was vacationing last July on the island of Oléron just 15 nautical miles away from my summer home in France. France is the country that hosted 165 jazz festivals this summer in many different kinds of settings, usually some antique, medieval, renaissance or contemporary venues but also frequently coupled with a non-Jazz theme. It is so that in France, Jazz is considered as a major cultural contribution that looks good for any municipality that gets involved and that is good for business in general. Somehow, we got news of the première of the St-Emilion Jazz Festival which took place in a medieval village where some of the best Bordeaux wine is produced and shipped worldwide, thus the St-Emilion Jazz festival was a coupling between Jazz, St-Emilion wine and Perigord extra delicate food. Peter got it through facebook, myself through a banner in an article of the local Sud-Ouest newspaper that talked about a truck plunging into the ocean from the causeway leading to Peters vacation location. I just wanted to ensure the same fate didnt occur to him. However, we quickly came to the conclusion that we could plot a trip against our wives legendary other priorities using each other as an alibi to go. It worked! Peter already reported this memorable outing on his blog: http://blogs.ottawacitizen.com/2012/08/09/saint-emilion-jazz-festival-road-trip/ Of that night I only knew Dee Dee Bridgewater from way back in the 70s when she was into Free-Jazz on the New York scene, soon to drift away into more commercial configurations. I had never paid attention to Brian Blade but fortunately, Peter knew him well and guaranteed me that I would not be disappointed. Indeed, this was for me a real discovery. I know the functioning of the New York Jazz scene well, having spent decades going back and forth including in company of my late friend saxophonist Billy Robinson that gave me opportunities to talk to lots of musicians and also commuted there weekly for a couple years a decade ago. Thus, I know for a long time that there are hundreds of outstanding musicians down there who are kept in the dark thanks to major labels marketing strategies that makes them concentrate on a small set of musicians. Drummer and composer Brian Blade somewhat fits into this category despite the fact that he is one of the most in demand drummers, performing with Kenny Garret, Wayne Shorter, Joshua Redman, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea on the Jazz side but also with Bob Dylan on the pop music side. The performance at St-Emilion was intense and thanks to the continuous thirst for people like Archie Shepp from the French public, all elements of commercialism were happily left aside which is unfortunately not the case for marketing managers-oriented CD productions. They played what they wanted to play, blending in the lyrical with the hardest Post-Bop and Post-Free they could. Blade is also a composer but composer is in my opinion not the right word for Brian Blade. He is a musical architect that gives his works elaborate constructions with symphonic overtones and concentrates on suites of musical entities and the way to nest them. On the performing side itself, Blade doesnt confine himself to a rhythm section role. Instead he follows his musicians wherever they go as an extension to their melodic lines, sometimes even anticipating their moves. This may explain why he is in such demand as a sideman. Tonight, Peter Hum will be in the CKCU studio to share our emotions about this memorable evening of Jazz in St-Emilion.\n\nSeptember 12th, 2012: British guitarist Derek Bailey recording Good Cop Bad Cop\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Each musician tries to develop his own approach to music to differentiate himself from the competition so to speak. British guitarist Derek Bailey extended this concept to the limits. In the 70s Bailey was not satisfied with permanent bands. He found the outcome too predictable and somewhat limiting. Thus, from there on he played with constantly renewed personnel to ensure that he will be challenged in his habits at all times and more likely produce music he never thought of before. Good Cop bad Cop was recorded live in 2003 with an array of equally prodigious musicians, Tony Bevan, Paul Hession and Otomo Yoshihide. The music is as described above, un-predictable, constantly changing with each intervention of another musician and undoing what the preceding soloist was doing as soon as possible thus making boredom for the listener potentially impossible.\n\nSeptember 5th, 2012: Summer Jazz  part I: French drummer, pianist, accordionist, poet and off-beat politician Bernard Lubat\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: If you are in France and jazzman Bernard Lubat turns up on a concert poster, dont even start to think! Just go, you wont be disappointed. Bernard Lubat has been cultivating the concept of one man show for a while. Fully proficient on four instruments (drums, piano, accordion, voice), his art is probably focused on yet two more extensions: poetry and circus. Since all of his music is sawn with poetry that can turn into acid political satire targeted at all the political spectrum and that all of that is in French or more precisely an extended French where words, like Jazz chords are carefully altered to reveal their true meaning or sometimes exactly their opposite all of that with the appropriate rhythm effects that one could expect from a percussionist, you may be first at a loss. However, the circus component should break the language barrier at once. During most of the concert I was wondering what the three large frying pans hanging above the grand piano were for. At one point, the revelation came. After having thrown a batch of ping pong balls in the piano that were jumping all over the place to create both a visual effect (the circus part) and random sounds (the music part) (the composition was appropriately called et que ça saute!), the frying pans revealed their function. Lubat had a typical but bigger than usual toy dart gun with suction cups. At the very appropriate moment, while un-suspiciously playing piano, Lubat would fire his gun and the percussive impact of the arrow would of course produce a sound on the frying pan at exactly the right point in time in the improvisation of a standard including the right pitch. I forgot which tune it was he was playing, but I think it was Stella by Starlight, a favorite worn out standard commonly played at any jam-session. The French crowds love that kind of complex combinations of art and casual events. The venue was of course packed with people having driven sometimes up to two hours to get to this venue. For the iconoclasts, Lubat defines himself as an Amusicien (Amusician) which after much thinking could be interpreted in two opposite ways: an anti-musician or an amuse-ician. Your choice! Note: the very long, winding and complex syntax errors laden phrases of the above text are intended to somehow render the complexity of Lubats both personality and art. This summer I had the luck to catch Lubat at the most unusual venue one could think: Le Théatre dArdoise on the island of Oléron in France. That island is not known for its Jazz festivals like the French Riviera. The local demand for Jazz is low there. But artistic director Jean-Marc Chailloleau, also owner of the oyster processing basins around the theatre and co-founder of a pirate radio station where he also hosted a Jazz program in the 80s, has a different idea: program a festival spread over the two months French people take their extensive vacation that a typical Nortel Networks manager still dont understand today with a very mixed content ranging from folk music to Jazz but always with the combination music, theatre, and high-end gastronomy food. This is not to mention the venue itself, an artificial roman theatre made of shale slates that are usually used to attract oyster larvae in the ocean. This symbiosis between Jazz, art, nature and architecture should land him a UNESCO world heritage label soon unless he stays too quiet. http://www.letheatreardoise.com Lubat can be viewed on: http://vimeo.com/9229754\n\nProgram schedule for the month of August 2012\n\nAugust 29th, 2012: Beach combers treasure trove\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: A long summer with lots of findings: · Attila Zoller, Hans Koller, Martial Solal in 1965 · Charlie Parker at Massey hall, 1953 · Roscoe Mitchell, Nine To Get Ready, 1997 · Ben Riley featuring Wayne Escoffery, 2010 · Erroll Garner, Caravan, 1953 · Frank Paul Schubert, Shots & Coups, 2012 · Tim Bedner, Of Light And Shadow, 2012 · Sun Ra, My Brother the Wind, 1969\n\nAugust 22nd, 2012: Trumpets, trumpets, trumpets!\n\nHost: David Broscoe: Inspired by recent IMOO shows, David Broscoe samples recent trumpet recordings from Axel Dörner, Ellwood Epps, Peter Evans, Craig Pedersen, and Nate Wooley.

Co-host Mark Keill will ensure you have a good RWAC program.\n\nAugust 1st, 2012: French saxophonist Barney Wilen\n\nHost: Rob Bitschofsky: The Curious Case of Barney Wilen's Moshi. Barnney Wilen was a French old-school tenor and soprano saxophonist who came to fame playing with Miles Davis on the seminal soundtrack Ascenseur pour l'Échafaud. Fine. By the late 60s he took a strange, sharp turn into blistering psychedelic rock fusion with the album Dear Prof. Leary. But things got stranger still when he went to Africa in 1970 with some recording equipment and an entourage intent on chasing after the songs of the pygmies. Combining snippets of field recordings, African folk songs, animal noises, whimsical singing and all kinds of delightful weirdness, Moshi is the album he made when he came back. Guest host Rob Bitschofsky investigates.\n\nProgram schedule for the month of July 2012\n\nJuly 25th, 2012: Portuguese Horn Player Rodrigo Amado part II\n\nHost: Ron Steeds: Guest host Ron Steeds profiles the Portuguese horn player Rodrigo Amado that includes his work with his Motion Trio, his Lisbon Improvisation Players and his work with Dennis Gonzalez Yells At Eels. This is the second of a two part feature. Part one aired July 4. You can still listen to part one by using our ON DEMAND feature!\n\nJuly 18th, 2012: Ten Freedom Summers\n\nHost: Rob Bitschofsky: In which we scratch the surface of the sprawling, ambitious new 4-CD epic concept album of that name by trumpet player Wadada Leo Smith. An abstract evocation of the American civil rights movement with Smith's Golden Quintet and the 8-piece Southwest Chamber Music ensemble, the album is way too big for one show, so consider this part one.\n\nJuly 11th, 2012: Rare Noise Records\n\nHost: Mark Keill: This week a look at a few of the artists on the UK recording label RareNoise. Founded in 2008 with the purpose, amongst other things, to \"seek musicians who are both very literate and at complete ease with breaking boundaries of genre. From Electronica to Ambient to Indie Rock, to Dub, to Drum'n Bass to Jazz to Funk to Classical - no boundaries.\"\n\nJuly 4th, 2012: Portuguese hornplayer Rodrigo Amado part I\n\nHost: Ron Steeds: Guest host Ron Steeds profiles the Portuguese hornplayer Rodrigo Amado that includes his work with his Motion Trio, his Lisbon Improvisation Players and his work with Dennis Gonzalez Yells At Eels. This is the first of a two part feature. Part two will air July 25.\n\nProgram schedule for the month of June 2012\n\nJune 27th, 2012: Don Cherry  Live at Café Montmartre 1966 vol 1.\n\nHost: Jim Reil: Guest host Jim Reil will play all of Don Cherry's Live at Cafe Montmartre 1966, Vol. 1. Recorded in Copenhagen, this is a truly inspired recording featuring Cherry on trumpet, a young and fiery Gato Barbieri on tenor saxophone, Karl Berger on vibraphone, Bo Stief on bass and Aldo Romano on drums.\n\nJune 20th, 2012: Don Pullen Black Saint/Soul Note reissues\n\nHost: Rob Bitschofsky: Italian labels Black Saint and Soul Note have been reissuing out-of-print free jazz works in great budget-priced box sets. Guest host Rob Bitschofsky checks out the new 7-cd set of pianist Don Pullen's early works.\n\nJune 13th, 2012: Escalator over the hill\n\nHost: Rob Bitschofsky: A peek into the vast vault of vinyl at the CKCU library reveals an avant-garde gem from 1971, Carla Bley's \"jazz opera\" The Escalator Over the Hill. Featuring Don Cherry, Charlie Haden, John McLaughlin, Jack Bruce, Roswell Rudd and many more. Guest host Rob Bitschofsky gives it a spin.\n\nJune 6th, 2012: Extraordinary New York bassist William Parker\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: After reviewing the Ottawa International Jazz Festival for a couple weeks, a good idea might be to warm up with the Montreal Suoni del Popolo off festival right before. One artist that is repeatedly featured at Suoni del Popolo is the extraordinary bassist William Parker that has now a four decades track record of developing a distinctive sound and technique on avant-garde bass. Parker has catapulted the bass into a different orbit as the traditional rhythm section role. He fully extended his forefathers innovations, Jimmy Garrison, Mingus and many others in sculpting a unique soloing style loaded with rich textures using the arco and elaborate melodies that you would expect normally from horns or pianos. He has also used this soloing style even in band contexts, especially with the great Cecil Taylor, David S. Ware, Charles Gayle, Matthew Shipp and Jameel Moondoc. Most of us here in Ottawa discovered him sometimes in the late 70s at the Saw Gallery. We still havent recovered from that explosion of energy. Besides playing the bass, William Parker is also a very articulate activist and organizer always with the focus of Music along with social issues. A couple of weeks ago, I landed at Montreals Cheap Thrills where I found this triple CD box of pure solo William Parker. His liner notes in a way sum up his art: Fräulein Miller owned about 200 slaves in South Carolina. Legend has it she was a benevolent master who would save pieces of stale cake for the slaves from time to time. This was something she was proud of. Then one day several slaves made their way into the kitchen stealing large knives. They had made the decision to cut the throats of the overseers and escape. At the crucial moment just before bloodshed was to occur they heard the sound of a low string instrument. It was a bass being bowed and the music was like a dance but you couldnt dance to it without listening and you couldnt listen without feeling it. These displaced and tortured Africans held out their arms, they intertwined them like branches from a tree. Becoming unified as one voice they looked in the slave masters eyes turning and walked off the plantation into the horizon never to be seen again.\n\nProgram schedule for the month of May 2012\n\nMay 30th, 2012: Ottawa International Jazz Festivals avant-garde picks\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: The Ottawa International Jazz Festival under the artistic direction of saxophonist Petr Cancura has come up with a well-balanced programming on the avant-garde side of things between New York based musicians and Europeans and the various stylistic genres that range from classical music extensions to post 60s free Jazz to Imaginary Folklore oriented. In preparation for this celebration we will sample the music of: · Brooklynns Rob Garcia complex melodies · Maya Homburger/Barry Guy/Pierre Favre classical oriented music · Brian Blades lyrical side of not so straight ahead Jazz · Angelika Niescier rising German star with a Berlin energy loaded Jazz · Ig Hennemans Dutch Instant Composers Pool oriented sense of improvised orchestration · Luca Ciarla, Italys stealth unbalanced fiddling\n\nMay 23d, 2012: Valley Giants  An OIJF sponsored CD\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Petr Cancura, the Ottawa International Jazz Festival music director will be in the studio to talk about an interesting initiative to feature local musicians on an official OIJF CD. Knowing how local musicians in general all over the world are struggling to either record or distribute their own CDs, this initiative is certainly a major contribution.\n\nMay 16th, 2012: Anthony Braxton Creative Orchestra 1978\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: The immense creativity of Anthony Braxton is probably responsible for the definite anchoring of Jazz into the academic world. His music is beyond the revolt of the 60s that was principally aimed at de-commercialising Jazz. Instead, he turned it what the French call un art savant highlighting its scientific qualities. In the 70s, he concentrated on two formats that are common in western classical music, tour de force solo performances on the saxophone similar to a Rostropovich cello solo performance and large bands similar to classical symphonic orchestras (up to 160 musicians involved). However, all of that did not distract him from the roots of Jazz and he frequently pays tribute to the tradition and primarily the Be-Bop idiom that as an alto saxophonist is plugged irremediably into Charlie Parker. Tonight, we will survey his 1978 recordings Creative Orchestra (Köln) on the Hatology label that features an obvious tribute to Duke Ellington and further back in time, to the American March King, John Philip Sousa to whom we owe many famous marches including Stars and Stripes Forever. What a mix! Would the younger generation say.\n\nMay 9th, 2012: British unsetting extreme vocalist Phil Minton\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Phil Minton has had a long career exploring the capabilities of producing music with the human voice well beyond established standards. He has done anything imaginable with his voice. Burping is considered as a musical element here. He is known to master the technique of producing multiple simultaneous burps. Minton can be sometimes funny like Donald Duck or outrageously dramatic. Tonight we will sample his solo CD, No doughnuts in hand that is part of a series about doughnuts over the last three decades, 1982, 1996 and now 2007. It illustrates particularly well the extraordinary vocabulary he has developed over the years. His unique technique has attracted continuous engagements. Since the 60s, Minton has performed on over 100 vinyl or CDs and is considered equally unique with another Britton, Evan Parker.\n\nMay 2nd, 2012: UNESCO Jazz Day includes Ottawa Local musicians\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: A couple of days ago, UNESCO decided to celebrate Jazz as an artifact of humanity. Here in Ottawa, this includes a pretty array of fine musicians. Thus, tonight we will focus on the various directions that our local musicians have taken. · The travelling music of saxophonist Doug Martin, Amsterdam · The hypnotic music of saxophonist Linsey Wellman, Ephemera · The rhythmically Balkanic music of drummer Mike Essoudry · The complex, multi-layered and humoristic music of trumpetist Craig Pedersen, Days Like Today · The lyrical music of bassist John Geggie, Geggie Project with Marilyn Crispell · The celebrative music of pianist Peter Hum, A Boys Journey · The ethnically loaded music of saxophonist Petr Cancura, People Music · The exploration of Jazz history of saxophonist Dean Pallen, Sunswept Sunday · The multi-phonics of saxophonist David Broscoe, Rake And last but not least, RWAC now uses a percussionist Jesse Stewart composition as its theme song.\n\nProgram schedule for the month of April 2012\n\nApril 25th, 2012: MPS  Jazz meets India, 1966\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: A few weeks ago we had the pleasure to discover the involvement of the German, Black-Forest based MPS record label with Canadian pianist Oscar Peterson at the NAC 4th stage. During the 60s, I knew the MPS label quite well, but for some obscure reasons I completely missed the straight ahead Jazz side of MPS mostly because yet another Black-Forest institution, the Baden-Baden located Südwest Funk radio was pumping us the most avant-garde Jazz side of MPS over the air along with the most avant-garde classical music, all of this, as if it wasnt enough, within the context of a major avant-garde festival, the Donaueschingen Ton Kunst Festival. With these three hot spots for avant-garde in the same region, you had no other choice than to be caught in an avant-garde cross-fire. By the way, this may provide some explanations about myself for those still wondering.\n\nAnother trendy thing during the 60s was the exploration of ethnic music and its fusion with avant-garde Jazz. John Coltrane was of course the first to explore Indian music and out of it came his modal playing style as an alternative to the II-V-I fireworks of his famous composition Giant Steps. Many others followed suit. Among them, German, French and Swiss avant-garde Jazz musicians that were busy with the concept of pan-European Jazz projects. Tonight, we will sample the Jazz Meets India MPS recording that features an Indian traditional Sitar-Tabla-Tambura trio with Swiss pianist Irene Schweizer, German cornetist Manfred Schoof and French saxophonist Barney Willen.\n\nApril 18th, 2012: Gil Evans  Out of the Cool, 1960\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Gil Evans was particularly known through his work with Miles Davis. Sketches of Spain is probably the most impressive work in collaboration with Miles Davis. However, few know that his best work ever, Out of the Cool, was on his own and with a well populated band using the various emerging or well established artists of the time like Elvin Jones, Jimmy Knepper, Ron Carter, etc As its title suggests, Out of the Cool signals a new era or even more after the abrupt changes from wild Be Bop to Cool Jazz to Free Jazz, a radical departure or at least some soul searching. As usual, Jazz being based primarily on fast evolution, Gil Evans was beyond Duke Ellington which by definition was a challenge. The recipe for this success is somewhat simple, a very uncommon distribution of musical instruments with a penchant for the very low pitch tuba, trombones vs the higher pitch trumpets (two of them) and alto saxophones with few tenor saxophones and the unusual sound of the oboe that Yusef Lateef explored so well.\n\nIn any case, this recording should be a pretty good antidote to schmooze jazz!\n\nApril 11th, 2012: Fred Frith  to SAIL, to SAIL, 2008\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: A guitar is traditionally a plucked strings instrument. In the hands of guitarist Fred Frith, this is no longer true. Over the last 35 years he found ways to play the guitar in a myriad different ways beyond recognition. He has had a prolific recording activity too. Some critics said that the year 2008 was an exception with few recordings, but his to SAIL, to SAIL CD is an extensive master piece he must have extensively focused on. Frith, normally an electric guitarist, concentrates his art on an acoustic steel guitar this time. He recorded only three CDs on the acoustic guitar in his career. But on this particular CD he threw all the techniques he found over the years at it. Sliding, percussion in a dulcimer like fashion, oriental sounding like a Chinese Pipa or Japanese Biwa, semi-muted strings, thumbing like on an African mbira, percussively metallic, flamenco-like organic strings, Gamelan percussive, overtones by the ton, bouncing objects, resonances, textures, rubbing, bowing, oscillating, drumming, dense, sparse, peaceful.\n\nApril 4th, 2012: Kikuri Keiji Haino  Masami Akita\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Jazz and Rock have crossed paths many times over the last half a century. The early forms instigated by Miles Davis consisted in playing good old Be Bop lines over Rock rythms and harmonies but usually for mostly commercial purposes. But during the same time span, some Rock musicians got interested in the Improvisation side of Jazz and into the free form side of Free Jazz. In any case, the iconic II-V-I got replaced with the Noise concept as a basic material. Japanese guitarist Keiji Haino has been doing that for three decades now. He is a cult artist in Japan. Take this and mix it with the equally incendiary style of Masami Akita and you get the optimal shake up of the day. Tonight, we will look at a 2007 recording, Pulverized Purple, from a live performance at the Victoriaville Festival that by the way is looming around the corner\n\nProgram schedule for the month of March 2012\n\nMarch 28th, 2012: Ornette Coleman classic: Something Else, 1958\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: For about 10 years, Ornette Colemans peers thought that he didnt know the changes and was out of tune. In a way they may not be totally wrong but where they were wrong is that they didnt realize that you can play music with other musical principles as changes and playing in tune may be highly boring. In fact, Ornette was after freedom as a free and continuous flow of ideas with the only preoccupation to carry emotions. Most people think that Ornettes music is highly abstract. In fact, it is very much straight ahead Be Bop in dynamics and phrasing. Technically it is a case of destabilized II-V-I (a favorite Be Bop structural element). The freedom adds an element of unpredictability that is the best insurance against boredom. Tonights featured album, Something Else, reflects the exceptional energy resulting from this freedom to go anywhere in the musical world.\n\nSpecial event: tonight, RWAC will install a new theme song. After 35 years of Arthur Blythe`s In the Tradition blues, one of my favorite musicians, we will switch to Canadian content and also honor one of our Carleton University professors, Jesse Stewart. To make it even more atrociously Canadian content the new theme song will be his composition Different Strokes from his Music for Found Objects that was performed using the iconic Canadian canoe paddles.\n\nMarch 21st, 2012: OLD STUFF by the New York Art Quartet\n\nHost: Ron Steed: Guest host Ron Steeds features the recently released OLD STUFF by the New York Art Quartet. This recording is made up of two live performances in Denmark in October, 1965 that were broadcast on Danish Radio. The quartet is a truly international ensemble - Roswell Rudd is American, John Tchicai is Danish, Finn Von Eyben is Dutch and Louis Moholo is South African. The CD came out on Cuneiform Records in 2010.\n\nMarch 14th, 2012: September trio\n\nHost: David Broscoe: Harris Eisenstadt (drums, compositions) with Ellery Eskelin (tenor) and Angelica Sanchez (piano), Clean Feed, recorded 2010 Geek alert - A thinly disguised excuse for another show featuring Elery Eskelin, who recently made the switch from a Selmer Mark VI to a 1927 Conn. This recording is the first documentation of Eskelin on the Conn. David Broscoe compares and contrasts this recording with older Eskelin recordings, and muses abut Eskelin's evolving relationship with the 'jazz tradition.' Eskelin blogs about the transition here http://elleryeskelin.blogspot.com/2010/04/first-installment.html and throughout his blog http://elleryeskelin.blogspot.com/\n\nMarch 7th, 2012: Regal  the double duo sessions (2011) (TetraArtist)\n\nHost: Mark Keill: T. Bruce Wittet, Ian Froman - drums, percussion From http://regals.bandcamp.com/ \"Two guitarists and two drummers travel across North America to unite in collective improvisation and composition, yielding ... more an unusually wide dynamic range and broad palette of textures.\" REGALS: a unique 'double duo' uniting renowned guitarists Wayne Eagles & Ken Rosser with highly-respected drummers T. Bruce Wittet & Ian Froman. Recording mastered by David Torn.\"\n\nProgram schedule for the month of February 2012\n\nFebruary 29th, 2012: Montreal trumpetist Elwood Epps\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Elwood Epps started his musical career in Toronto over 20 years ago. Somehow he got attracted by the vibrant Montreal scene, especially the avant-garde side of it and since 2005 established there. His art covers practically the entire Jazz history. Epps describes himself as being influenced by Louis Armstrong, Maurice Andre, Miles Davis, Bix Beiderbecke, Bill Dixon, Wadada Leo Smith, Dizzy Gillespie, Fats Navarro, Dave Douglas, Laurie Frink, Booker Little, Amy Horvey, Cat Anderson, Cootie Williams, Rex Stewart. Tonight we will sample his CD Pink Saliva, one of over 40 recordings he appears on, where he focuses on what the younger generations call ambient music. It is a rather lyrical and ecstatic mix of Miles Davis post 60s and Bill Dixons music featuring sound textures and slow dynamic on single notes on wall to wall electronics. What is remarkable here is that such a minimalistic music captivates ones attention and prevents distraction. Epps developed a rare virtuosity in the very low register of the instrument, something most trumpetists avoid altogether. Elmwood Epps will be featured again in the IMOO series on March 18th.\n\nFebruary 22nd, 2012: Art Blakey all stars including Thelonious Monk, 1972\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Producer Georges Wein really believed in Jazz. He organized hundreds of concerts to capacity audiences around the world. Tonight, we will look at one of them recorded at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1972 that featured an all stars band led by drummer Art Blakey with Roy Eldridge, Al McKibbon, Sonny Stitt, Clark Terry, Kai Winding and especially pianist Thelonious Monk that was here filling the role of a sideman. What a sideman! This supposed to be straight ahead Jazz concert was driving high on energy as if something was on their tail, i.e. Free Jazz.\n\nFebruary 15th, 2012: American saxophonist Patrick Breiner\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: For those (very few) who forgot to drop by the IMOO series last Sunday at the UMI cafe, tonight there will be a catchup session on RWAC. The IMOO series organized by Craig Pedersen, Linsey Wellman and Renée Yoxon is based on a simple principle, network all kinds of musicians that play improvised music. First of all they highlighted the fact that there are a number of local musicians that are actively playing improvised music but also they catch travelling musicians into their orbit. This was the case last Sunday of American saxophonist Patrick Breiner who played a first set solo and a second set joined by Craig Pedersen and Scott Warren in a rare convergence session. Breiner's approach to improvisation is based mostly but not exclusively on minimalism à la Steve Reich or Evan Parker. He calls it attention splitting - playing several lines simultaneously in order to create the illusion of several instrumentalists. His repetitive lines are systematically disturbed with minute sound or texture changes creating the impression of constantly changing moods. However, this is not the only music he plays. The '30s are equally important to him and he can trick you into a Ben Webster snapshot anytime you want. One additional interesting thing about these travelling musicians, they bring their CDs providing a rare opportunity to escape from the orbit of major labels. I couldn't resist. Thus, we will enjoy a solo CD, Stumpfest that corresponds to what he performed at IMOO last Sunday. I just realized that there is something old and new in these travelling musicians. The old part is that these musicians are like medieval troubadours. They bring live music wherever they go. who would had thought that such a thing is still useful today. However, they achieve this mostly using the most advanced computer technology, the internet, facebook and twitter to guide them through the maze of suburban TV addicted populations. But somehow, this all works...\n\nFebruary 08th, 2012: Ottawa saxophonist Doug Martin\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Travelling and Jazz creativity have been known for a long time as a win-win combination. Ottawa saxophonist Doug Martin`s latest CD, Odyssey, is precisely achieving this. He will be in the studio to explain us in detail how exactly this process works.\n\nFebruary 01th, 2012: Archie Shepp in Chambery, 1987\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: During the second half of the '70s, Archie Shepp underwent a radical transformation in his approach to music. All of the techniques and sound strongly rooted into the Blues or even field hollers he developed during the '60s to support the radicalism of avant-garde Jazz were put to use in a wall to wall exploration of Jazz history. Sidney Bechet, Erroll Garner, Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington and many others combined with the reverence to great saxophonists like Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Ben Webster were the main staple of a legion of concerts in Europe and particularly in France. Chambery in the French Alps is a small provincial town, probably the size of Hawksberry. Still, like in many other provincial towns across Europe, Shepp always plays in front of packed audiences.\n\nProgram schedule for the month of January 2012\n\nJanuary 25th, 2012: Marion Brown: Afternoon of a Georgia Faun (1970) / Geechee Reflections (1973) / Sweet Earth Flying (1974)\n\nHost: David Broscoe: Celebrating the Impulse! reissue of the long out-of-print Geechee Reflections / Sweet Earth Flying by alto/soprano player Marion Brown, David Broscoe plays selections from three atmospheric albums invoking Browns southern roots.\n\nJanuary 18th, 2012: Guitarist Henry Kaiser and Korean music\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Henry Kaiser is a very prolific San Francisco Bay Area guitarist. The terminology prolific can be applied to both the quantity of music, usually measured by the number of recordings, the quantity of musical styles he approaches and integrates and finally the quantity of technical experiments he attempts on the guitar. In short, Henry Kaiser is in the lineage of British guitarist Derek Bailey which of course is very far away from the style of Django Reinhardt and has had a mutually beneficial parallel career with Fred Frith, another post Reinhardt guitarist that has pretty similar artistic preoccupations. Among the many musical sources of inspiration, Henry Kaiser has developed a fascination for world music like many other avant-garde musicians. Tonight we will examine his work with Korean kayogum and tonso player Sang-Won Park where Kaiser performs a rare exercise of blending in and out of the musical source, Korean traditional music in a way that is usually more common to visual arts rather than music.\n\nJanuary 11th, 2012: Chicago's Ethnic Heritage Ensemble\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Chicago has been an important source of Jazz musicians since the start. Its strategic position relative to the Mississippi river that used to be a major communication route before railroads and aviation has largely contributed to this situation in the past. Early Jazz musicians streamed in all the way from New Orleans which included musicians such as Louis Armstrong. More remarkable is the fact that Chicago has also been at the centre of avant-garde Jazz thanks in part to the sense of organization of Chicago musicians with the founding ofan organization, the AACM in the late '60s. This has produced some major projects and musicians, one of them being the Art Ensemble of Chicago, a world travelling band. May be the success of the AEOC can be attributed to the fact that it tried to free itself from pigeon holes and consider Jazz for what it is, i.e. diversified and the result of a constant evolution. The same preoccupation was central to the Sun Ra Arkestra resulted to be equally prestigious and also a constant source of ideas and concepts.\n\nKahil el Zabar's Ethnic Heritage Ensemble, mostly known as a post Art Ensemble of Chicago group is in direct lineage with these above mentioned giants. However, what distinguishes him from the others is among other things his deep exploration of African instruments whether percussion or the unique African Mbira and all the true distinctive African musical concepts that go with it. More important may be and in sharp contrast with his predecessors, is the size of the Band as a trio without the classic rythm section format, a trumpet and reeds against the drums and sometimes the humble in size but so rich African Mbira. In other words, this may sound like doing more with less, the ultimate dream of politicians with the difference that in this case, it actually really works! Conceptually though, the size of the band has to do more with the traditional African street musicians bands. Thus, besides the main core instruments, all of this comes with some extras drawn from the African musician world like the little bells attached to the legs that give an extra coloring and effect while doing the good old Jazz stomping and of course the moanin' and other vocal effects that are an essential part of the EHE's music.\n\nThe Ethnic Heritage Ensemble will be performing at the Mercury lounge on February 4th as it has been doing for a number of years now. This year, however, the Ottawa International Jazz Festival will be chapperonning the show. Worth of note is that on the same day, in matinée, the IMOO-Orchestra, a local successful organization directly inspired by Chicago's AACM will also be performing as part of the Jazz festival.\n\nJanuary 4th, 2012: Anthony Braxton/Joëlle Léandre duo 2007\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Two continents, two giants of avant-garde Jazz. Anthony Braxton is an avant-garde musician that believe it or not has well entered his fifth decade of his career. Right from start, as a result of following the Art Ensemble of Chicago, he established himself a terrifying reputation as an academic musician in Europe. Sooner or later he worked with European musicians. In recent years, this means also French bassist and vocalist, Joëlle Léandre. This association is surprising in many ways because it is a splendid example of Ying and Yang. Both are virtuoso of course, but the mathematical calculated music of Braxton smacks head on with the quasi anarchistic and unpredictable utterances of Léandre and this, to everyone's delight. More impressive is the fact that this combination actually perfectly works, i.e. it doesn't seem to be conflictual. They even talk about convergence. Tonight, we will sample a double CD, Heidelberg Loppem, 2007 on Leo records\n\nProgram schedule for the month of December 2011\n\nDecember 28th, 2011: Soprano saxophonist Jane Bunnett, Radio Guantanamo\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Jane Bunnett has an interesting career. She got attracted to Jazz via Charles Mingus, not exactly a straight ahead musician, got Free Jazz players such as Don Pullen and Dewey Redman on her first recording, and overall has been influenced by Steve Lacy. However, all of those musicians have potentially one thing in common, they all got attracted by one or another form of world music. Thus, it is no surprise that Bunnett has visited Cuba and ever since then has collaborated with some exceptional Cuban musicians to everyones satisfaction.Tonight, we will sample her Radio Gunatanamo CD that you could use for a perfect New Years party music.\n\nDecember 21st, 2011: Christmas present from Berlin\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: There have been lots of reports lately in the press that things are changing in Berlin. Apparently, Berlin has become a major tourist mecca mostly because of culture of all sorts including and especially music. Classical, Rock or Jazz all have been thriving since the early '90s when the wall came down. However, as basic economics tells us, this had an impact on prices. Rents, once at symbolic levels, are now skyrocketing. Many attributed the low rents as a prime factor for the presence of a huge number of musicians in Berlin. This certainly helped, but low rents alone are far from being determining. A musician also needs something even more basic, a crowd. There has never been a shortage of such crowds in Berlin and now with all these tourists, this is even less of a problem. As an economist by training, I always watch insignificant indicators that most of my collegues would consider as superfluous. My true economic indicator this time came in the form of a Christmas present from a musician friend in Berlin, saxophonist Frank Paul Schubert. He sent me not just one, but three CDs either as a leader or sideman. All without any signs of arts funding, another sign that business must be good and especially all in improvised music rather than anything commercial like one would espect it from normal tourist business. These are: A duo between saxophonist Frank Paul Schubert and trombonist Matthias Müller A trio led by drummer Jörg Fischer A trio led by drummer Willi Kellers\n\nDecember 14th, 2011: Argentinian saxophonist Gato Barbieri\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Argentinian saxophonist Gato Barbieri is may be an exception to the rule in the world of Free Jazz. Believe it or not, he made a successful commercial career at the bewilderment of Free Jazz aficionados of course. However, his path is quite interesting. First geograpically, he went straight to Europe, Rome, Italy and Paris, France before landing in New York. In Europe he started playing with all kinds of American Jazz musicians and especially Don Cherry with whom he had a common affinity for world music that they both incorporated into their Jazz.One of the main characteristic of his style is the concurrency of extreme avant-garde with very soft playing. Coltrane is never far away but so is Albert Ayler. This eventually landed him a sound track gig on the famous Last Tango in Paris.\n\nTonight we will sample his very first CD recorded in 1967 on the ESP-DISK label, In Seach of the Mystery.\n\nthe ESP-DISK label is still alive and religiously re-issues all of this beautiful music of the '60s and beyond that could constitute a very good Christmas present: http://espdisk.com/official/\n\nDecember 7th, 2011: Christmas shopping list\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Get something unusual for Christmas this year!\n\ntrumpeter Erik Truffaz, Mantis on Blue Note Florina Brass Band from Greece Alekzey Kruglov/Vladimir Tarasov on solyd records. Ray Anderson, Old Bottles - new wine Albert Ayler, music is the healing force Ellwood Epps, saliva Kellylee Evans, Nina John Zorn/Fred Frith, late work Art Blakey with Monk as a sideman 1972 Cecil Taylor, Chinampas (poems)\n\nProgram schedule for the month of November 2011\n\nNovember 30th, 2011: Jazz & classical music part III: European clarinetist Lajos Dudas\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Classical music started in Europe. Jazz started in America. Both spread around the world in all kinds of forms. After looking at how North American musicians tackle Classical music and Jazz fusion in previous weeks, this week we will look at European clarinettist Lajos Dudas that like all Europeans started musical life as a classical musician and quickly switched to Jazz. Also, on previous week we looked at \"traditional\" classical music vs straight ahead Jazz musicians, this week it is more classical avant-garde vs Jazz avant-garde. Lajos Dudas is Hungarian and studied at the Bela Bartok conservatory and the Franz Liszt academy of music, two of the most prestigious classical music institutions of Europe. This may explain his interest for both avant-garde genres. His approach is different from others who tackle the classical vs Jazz problem. He is not into swinging up classical music neither symphonizing Jazz. Instead both styles come through sometimes in a single phrase and thus naturally show their complementarity. Important is that at all times you feel surrounded by both classical music and Jazz atmosphere. Tonight, we will sample his latest CD What's up Neibor with pianist Hubert bergmann http://www.allaboutjazz.com/lajosdudas\n\nNovember 23d, 2011: the Craig Pedersen quartet CD\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Craig Pedersen is one of the busiest Jazz musicians in Ottawa. No surprise! His art extends in almost any direction. As a trumpet player, he doesn't hesitate to incorporate Duke Ellington's early works in his Jungle style, extensively composes complex pieces with a Bach fugue feeling and finally explores new areas with computer music or computer driven music and electronics. More important is that the analog and electronic sides of his art are fully intertwined, thus a natural guarantee against boredom. The problem with local geniuses is that they sooner or later get attracted to bigger cities like New York. For now Pedersen is only commuting there once a month for the next six months thanks to a Canada Council grant to further study trumpet there, however sooner or later someone will hook him there...\n\nTonight, Pedersen will be in the studio to talk about his new CD to be released this coming Tuesday, November 29th at the Club Saw.\n\nNovember 16th, 2011: Jazz & Classical music part II - Cellist Tristan Honsinger\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Last week we looked at classical musicians playing Jazz. This week we will look at Jazz avant-garde musicians tackling classical music.Tristan Honsinger is a well known American cellist that played with Cecil Taylor but being based in Europe (Italian sector) for decades plays regularly with the outstanding Dutch ICP Ochestra. In Italy, he is involved with another project that integrates Jazz with theatre. Here his approach is not really fully to play classical music or Jazz. In the recording that we will feature tonight, Call Me US, Honsinger plays in a duo with Italian Massimo Simonini that plays records, cds and tapes of classical music. Honsinger swirls around the melodies. The theatrical part represents about 50% of the recording. Here, there are statements that should make a few wakes around town: \"do you like classical noise?\", \"I like classical noise\" says Honsinger while Simonini gets into \"ti piace la musica classica? Il pianoforte? Pensavo a uno strumento stanco...\".\n\nNovember 9th, 2011: Jazz & Classical music part I - Matt Haimovitz - Claudia Hommel's Jazz Fauré Ensemble\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: First thanks again to all of our 19 donors that sent in their pledges to the 2011 CKCU-FM funding drive during our RWAC shows to bring the show total to $ 610. There are a few people we have not heard from but we are confident that they will eventually find some time among their oversaturated schedules to fix the problem (details below)\n\nThis week and the next couple of weeks, we will be exploring the relationship between Jazz and classical music.\n\nClassical music and Jazz have crossed their paths many times since the '20s. It mostly got started by classical musicians that were curious to see how Jazz was made. In these early days, one thing was established: it was not the notes. Effectively it was proven that classical musicians playing Jazz charts still sounded like classical musicians while Jazz musicians playing classical charts still sounded like Jazz musicians. Contemporary classical composers such as Igor Stravinsky pushed the curiosity even further by incorporating Jazz elements in their compositions. Later, things somewhat changed. Clarinetist Benny Goodman switched to classical music when the Swing music era was over. The '60s brought their lot of revolutions and experimentations, one of them was to rethink this classical music - Jazz relationship altogether. French pianist Jacques Loussier thought that Johann-Sebastian Bach was an early Jazz musician and played his music note for note and proved that it took little efforts to make it naturally swing. American pianist Dave Brubeck explored the fusion between classical compositions and Jazz and Blues improvisation.They had one thing in common: to be Jazz musicians. This year, another movement started and is worth of note: classical musicians play Jazz in a classical way. We all know what Jazz is. A music that is mainly improvised, that uses unusual harmonies, that has specific ways of phrasing, but more above all, it swings. It may be harder, especially for a Jazz musician, to define classical music. It is mostly composed, has large structural elements, uses contrasts between levels of sound, the famous pianissimo and fortissimo but more important, it does not swing.\n\nTonight, we will have a look at two interesting projects:\n\nMontreal cellist Matt Haimovitz and pianist Christopher O'Riley for a collaboration that blurs the boundaries between classical and pop that includes two compositions of Jazz Fusion musician John McLaughlin. Here the intent seems to be to transform Jazz into classical music altogether but also introduce classical improvisation in the process. Claudia Hommel's The Jazz Fauré Ensemble that fuses both very romantic and ascetic compositions of 19th century composer and musician Gabriel Fauré with straight ahead Jazz. Fauré was known to be among one of the first classical musician to explore new harmonies, precisely those that Jazz uses for a long time. Here the exercise consists in playing Fauré's music the way it always was and have a Jazz combo playing strictly Jazz behind. the result is surprisingly.\n\nNovember 2nd, 2011: Funding Drive show part II\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: First of all, thank you for last week's pledges of $ 370 towards RWAC. CKCU-FM entered its 36 years of existence with a continuous commitment to alternative radio which means alternative spoken words and alternative music of which avant-garde Jazz is a full part of. More important is that CKCU-FM has always been devoted to feature the music of local artists. Thus, tonight again, while calling for pledges we will feature the music of Ottawa local Jazz musicians that will include: Doug Martin, Odyssey CD Craig Pedersen, CD Jesse Stewart, Music for found objects CD Christine Fagan, Once CD Peter Turner quintet, +one CD Anna William, CD Bernard Stepien Orchestra A Very Ayler Christmas CD Radar, Radar sampler CD Generator, IMOO CD Peter Turner, One + CD\n\nProgram schedule for the month of October 2011\n\nOctober 26th, 2011: Funding Drive show part I\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: CKCU-FM entered its 36 years of existence with a continuous commitment to alternative radio which means alternative spoken words and alternative music of which avant-garde Jazz is a full part of. More important is that CKCU-FM has always been devoted to feature the music of local artists. Thus, tonight, while calling for pledges we will feature the music of Ottawa local Jazz musicians that will include: Mike Tremblay/Mark Fergusson HOME CD Linsey Wellman, Ephemera CD Dean Pallen & J.P. Allain Sunswept Sunday CD Petr Cancura's People Music CD Peter Hum's A Boy's Journey CD John Geggie's Project CD with Marilyn Crispell Mike Essoudry's Mash Potatoe Mashers CD\n\nOctober 19th, 2011: Hong Kong Free Jazz - guitarist Chan Wai-Fat\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Forget about the usual hot spots for Jazz avant-garde such as New York City, Berlin, London or Paris. Hong Kong has its own representative of the genre. Guitarist and composer Chan Wai-Fat started in Rock groups in 1991 and produced one of his first improvised music CD in 1996. A strong interest in traditional folk music from around the world including Chinese itself had its mark on Fat's music and landed him film music contracts. Tonight we will sample his 1996 recording Foo Cup Kwan nan (hardly Breathing) that features various instruments besides the guitar including little toys, a damaged string cello, a detuned guitar, a prepared guitar and the mysterious octavilla.\n\nOctober 12th, 2011: Jerry Granelli & the SF Jazz Collective\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: The Ottawa International Jazz Festival is opening it's fall season tonight with the San Francisco Gerry Granelli trio followed tomorrow by the San Francisco Jazz Collective. Jerry Granelli has been looking for new sounds for over four decades. His association with also San Francisco based pianist, Denis Zeitlin in the '60s propelled him in a freer direction. He also had a deep look at Native American music to ensure a steady deviation from main stream. The SF Jazz Collective is an all leaders group that started in 2004 and has since devoted each year on the repertoire of a specific composer, Ornette Coleman in 2004, John Coltrane in 2005, Herbie Hancock in 2006, Thelonious Monk in 2007, Wayne Shorter in 2008, McCoy Tyner in 2009 and Horace Silver in 2010. In short, a very eclectic focus on all horizons of Jazz. This year, the SF Collective pushes the limits by exploring five decades long career and 72 millions albums sold pop music giant Stevie Wonder. This is particularly significant since Jazz was at one time America's pop music. This sounds like a full circle story.\n\nOctober 5th, 2011: Johannes Welsch : SCHIZOPHONIA (Sonic Flame 2011)\n\nHost: Mark Keill: SCHIZOPHONIA is an experimental album released by European percussionist Johannes Welsch in September 2011. It consists of spoken word pieces, instrumentals and combinations thereof. The first track, appropriately entitled \"Spell\", prepares the listener for a unique experience through a series of spells in a fictitious language ending in chaos and noise. Several of the instrumentals including \"Cold Train\", \"Requiem\" and \"La Maladie\" are carried by Welsch's unique approach to drumming. The artist never hesitates to feature the drum kit as lead instrument full well covering the spectrum from trance-like pulse to ecstatic frenzy. Multi-instrumentalist John O'Connor (aka Johnny Black) contributes various voices such as slide guitar on the intense \"Murky Liquid Infusion Blues\", saxophone & vocals on the shamanic \"Where Are We?\", and accordion, shaker & vocals on the infamous \"Will Save The World\". One of the most daring moments on this album, other than the cursing of a fellow drummer on \"Scheiss Schlagzeuger\", is the description defying \"Silence\". SCHIZOPHONIA - while uniquely versatile and unbearably entertaining this cutting edge work is strangely coherent. More album info - http://schizophonia.info/ Johannes Welsch is the curator of the Dunrobin Sonic Gym which has hosted a number shows over the past little year including Pauline Oliveros, Glen Velez and most recently David Mott w. Jesse Stewart and Johannes More Sonic Gym info - http://sites.google.com/site/dunrobinsonicgym/home\n\nProgram schedule for the month of September 2011\n\nSeptember 28th, 2011: Tenor/Bass/Drums\n\nHost: David Broscoe: A classic jazz format as exemplified by Charles Gayle w William Parker and Rashied Ali (Touchin' on Trane, FMP, recorded 1991) Coltrane/Garrison/Jones ('Chasing the Trane' from Live at the Village Vanguard, Impulse!, recorded 1961) Rollins/Garrison/Jones (East Broadway Run Down, Impulse!, recorded 1966) John Butcher w Matthew Sperry and Gino Robair (12 Milagritos, Spool, recorded 1998) and others...\n\nSeptember 21st, 2011: The Respect Sextet - Sun Ra vs Karl Heinz Stockhausen\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Classical music and Jazz have crossed paths many times in Jazz history. Usually, this happens with pianist. French pianist Jacques Loussier explored the music of Johan Sebastian Bach and jazzed it up. American Jazz pianist Dave Brubeck had a crack at Mozart. While this was all straight ahead Jazz, Jazz avant-garde has its own cases. Pianist Cecil Taylor is often described as a classical avant-garde musician. The New York based Respect Sextet tackles the integration of the classical avant-garde composer Karl heinz Stockhausen with the music of Sun Ra. Here, the sextet explores also the format of larger ensemble usually called big band. Their size is relatively small for a big band, but they produce a fascinating big band sound. Stockhausen and Sun Ra had many things in common, they both believed to be from outer space, Stockhausen from Sirius and Sun Ra from Saturn, their compositional language, they both cultivated a cult-like inner circle of musicians, but also their approach to music including mysticism. However, at first glance, their music seems incompatible. But this is where the magic of the Respect Sextet creeps in... From the Respect Sextet perpective, this project is a case of \"conglomarrangement\". As usual, after a while, the listener should no longer distinguish who composed what.\n\nSeptember 14th, 2011: Improvising Musicians of Ottawa/Outaouais (IMOO) first anniversary\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: One year ago, the Improvising Musicians of Ottawa/Outaouais (IMOO) held its first concert at the Umi Café. Thirty one shows later, they are excited to celebrate their first anniversary! The last year has been successful beyond what could be imagined. They had the opportunity to present and promote some fantastic local artists, as well as hosting acts from Montreal, Toronto, Sackville, New York City, Vancouver and even Oslo. Both IMOO curators, Linsey Wellman and Craig Pedersen will be in the studio to talk about their project and play us some of the music that happened at the IMOO series\n\nSeptember 7th, 2011: Matthew Shipp - The Muliplication Table\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Matthew Shipp is a very prolific pianist (97 CDs since 1987) both in classical music and Jazz. Thus, he engages in the classical avant-garde with equal enthusiasm as with the Jazz avant-garde. Another way to put it, he is engaged in some of the most radical projects, especially with musicians such as David S. Ware but also never forgets the roots of Jazz. The Multiplication Table is a recording from 1997, thus from the end of the last century. Shipp is often described as the pianist of the new century implying that his music also brings something new. The interesting aspect of this recording is that he tackles some well known standards such as Autumn Leaves and a couple Duke Ellington/Billy Strayhorn compositions. Shipp is into deconstructing rather than destroying standards. Standards have left an imprint in peoples minds that can be turned to ones advantage when reshaping them into new music.\n\nProgram schedule for the month of August 2011\n\nAugust 31st, 2011: Cecil Taylor - Max Roach, 1979\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Cecil Taylor and Max Roach are iconic contributors to two distinct revolutions in Jazz history. Max Roach was instrumental for shaping the Be-Bop style in the '40s while Cecil Taylor was instrumental for shaping Free Jazz in the '60s. Both of these musical styles have survived to this day. Be Bop has taken Jazz out of dance halls to more culturally respectable concert halls while Cecil Taylor made an essential connection with the world of classical avant-garde giving Free Jazz not only respectability but more of a prestigious status. After all Cecil Taylor was sponsored by one of the most expensive piano brand, Bösendorfer during the '70s and '80s. Max Roach was by far not an old timer of a revolutionary music. Throughout his life he continued to push Jazz forward searching for unexplored territory. His associations with Free Jazz musicians such as Archie Shepp and Anthony Braxton are already a good track record. Max even went a step further by seeking associations with the new generation of Black musicians called rappers. Thus, in 1979 came the idea to play together with Cecil Taylor. Columbia University in NYC has a well established link to Jazz. For one thing, they harbor one of the finest university radio-station, WKCR of the world and second, they organize a free (moneywise) Jazz Festival every year in August that reflects all components of Jazz and is staffed with the leading Jazz artist. Another Max Roach - Cecil Taylor concert took place in the same location in the year 2000. I was there...\n\nAugust 24st, 2011: Beach comber mix part II\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Itsunomanika with Italian prepared guitarist Paolo Angeli and Japanese violinist Takumi Fukushima. 2.abstract truth by John Vanore's big band 3.

Guest host Rob Bitschofsky checks it out with tracks from Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, Alice Coltrane, Pharoah Sanders and more.\n\nAugust 10th, 2011: Beach comber mix part II\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Derek Bailey - good cop bad cop World Saxophone Quartet, experience Sun RA, jazz in silhouette JC Jones - histing myself Cecil Taylor, complete remastere recordings Black Saint & Soul Note Barney Willen - jazz meets India Steve Lacy - Roswell Rudd, monk's dream\n\nAugust 3d, 2011: Beach comber mix part I\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: John Zorn & Fred Frith Heinz Sauer with Joachim Kühn early Steve Lacy Huong Thanh & Nguyên Lê Sun Ra, the Antique Blacks Roland Kirk & Al Hibbler Henry Kaiser\n\nProgram schedule for the month of July 2011\n\nJuly 27th, 2011: Kip Hanrahan and American Clavé, Part 2\n\nHost: Rob Bitschofsky: Guest host Rob Bitschofsky returns with the second part of the music of American producer, composer and percussionist Kip Hanrahan.\n\nJuly 20th, 2011: more of guitarist Nels Cline\n\nHost: Jim Reil: Tonight, co-host Jim Reil will merge RWAC with IAMT. Thus, you will hear more of guitarist Nels Cline: Nels Cline: Co-Host Jim Reil presents an overview of the diverse and exciting improvisation-focused recordings of guitarist Nels Cline, who is better known for his work with Wilco.\n\nJuly 13th, 2011: Kip Hanrahan and American Clavé, Part 1\n\nHost: Rob Bitschofsky: American producer, composer and percussionist Kip Hanrahan brings together extraordinary casts of avant-garde jazz musicians like Chico Freeman, Billy Bang, David Murray, and the late Don Pullen with virtuoso latin percussionists and some eclectic rock and funk players. The resulting albums on his label, American Clavé, are dense, tense and atmospheric, with angular fragments of stories half sung, half mumbled. Guest host Rob Bitschofsky presents some of Hanrahan's compelling, provocative, rich and beautiful music.\n\nJuly 06th, 2011: David Broscoe\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: David Broscoe features saxophonist John Butcher's 'Resonant Spaces' release (2008), where Butcher recorded in and interacted sonically with specific Scottish locales, including caves, empty oil tanks, and abandoned ice houses. Photographs http://www.johnbutcher.org.uk/Lightbox/Resonant/Photo_Resonant.html Wire article http://www.johnbutcher.org.uk/wire_resonant.html Review http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=31851\n\nProgram schedule for the month of June 2011\n\nJune 29th, 2011: Montreal saxophonist François Carrier\n\nHost: Ron Steeds: Guest host Ron Steeds features the recent Ayler Records release, Entrance 3, by Montreal saxophonist François Carrier as well as other recent releases\n\nJune 22th, 2011: lowercase improv\n\nHost: David Broscoe: David Broscoe plays cuts from: Over the Transom - Jack Wright with hell & bunny (alto, cello, percussion) http://www.springgardenmusic.com/jackbio.html Live in Munich - Jim Denley & Kim Myhr, (alto/flutes/electronics, guitar/simple mechanics) http://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/artist/denley-jim More Gloom, More Light - nmperign with Gunter Muller (soprano, trumpet, percussion/electronics) http://soundcloud.com/intransitive-recordings/nmperign-glass All three releases might be described as lowercase improv, with an emphasis on the space between notes, relatively low volumes, and a deceptively anti-virtuostic approach. Of course all attempts at musical categorization are flawed; see this Dan Warburton piece on terminology for sub-genres of improvised music http://www.bagatellen.com/archives/features/000407.html\n\nJune 15th, 2011: George Lewis live electronics\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Les Exercices Spirituels is the latest release (2010) of George Lewis, trombonist and computer generated improvisation expert over four decades. It features basically improvised chamber music, a genre that has been taking hold these days despite Lady Gaga's stealing the show 99% of the time. George Lewis has been working with live electronics since the '70s when micro computers were only reserved to a hand full of hackers. His works with computers are plainly astonishing. I will always remember the duet performance he did with Aki Takase, piano, at the Total Music Meeting festival in Berlin in 2001 where it was difficult to distinguish who or what (the computer) was playing what to the point where they went back stage and the computer kept performing on his own, having fully digested the complex melodic and rythmic patterns of the live artists. This kind of perfection has landed Lewis in the Land of contemporary music like the one played at IRCAM in Paris, France with people like Pierre Boulez et al. What is the Ottawa Chamber Music Festival waiting for inviting George Lewis, this outstanding composer to perform here? Some of the compositions that will be played tonight have been commissioned by the Vancouver Olympiades.\n\nJune 8th, 2011: Pharoah Sanders Takes on the World\n\nHost: Rob Bitschofsky: Throughout his career, sax giant Pharoah Sanders has blended threads of music from other cultures into his sonic tapestry. With stops in Japan, Morocco, India and more, guest host Rob Bitschofsky presents a sampling of Sanders' global explorations.\n\nJune 1st, 2011: Trumpet player Tim Brynes\n\nHost: Mark Keill: This week a look at some of the work of New York City based composer and trumpet player Tim Brynes. He has performed and / or composed for various bands, including Candiria, Budd Dwyer, Romance, Friendly Bears, Kayo Dot and Ron Anderson`s PAK. He also has his own solo project named Hazel Rah ( yes, named after the Watership Down character ) which are his compositions for guitar, percussion, and synthesizer which will be the focus of tonights show. http://www.myspace.com/timbyrnes\n\nProgram schedule for the month of May 2011\n\nMay 25th, 2011: German pianist Wolfgang Dauner\n\nHost: Rob Bitschofsky: German pianist Wolfgang Dauner kicked off his career with one of the first European free jazz recordings in 1964, and went on to produce a handful of surprising and delightful albums that combine jazz, rock, electronic weirdness and world music. Guest host Rob Bitschofsky presents some Dauner gems from the first half of the 70s\n\nMay 18th, 2011: Charles Mingus - the Clown, 1957\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Mingus album's The Clown featured something new: a narration in addition to music. Mingus explained: \"The Clown\" tells the story of a clown \"who tried to please people like most jazz musicians do, but whom nobody liked until he was dead. My version of the story ended with his blowing his brains out with the people laughing and finally being pleased because they thought it was part of the act. I liked the way Jean changed the ending; leaves it more up to the listener.\" This probably was enough for some to criticize this album which prompted Mingus to narrow down his choice of tracks as he explained back then: \"I selected these four over two others that were more intricate because some of those guys had been saying that I didn't swing. So I made some that did. This album also has the first blues I've made on record\" Mingus that can not swing? Well, in the CD re-edition, the \"controversial\" tracks appear as bonus tracks. We will take them further under the magnifying glass. Today, this music still sounds free and especially refreshing.\n\nMay 11th, 2011: John Tchicai - Pierre Dørge duo, 1981\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: John Tchicai has been involved with Jazz avant-garde since the early '60s, playing with Archie Shepp and Don Cherry in the New York Contemporary Five, Albert Ayler, John Coltrane, Cecil Taylor and many others. However, his style has always been very different from his peers that specialized in outpours of notes, multiphonics, etc... Instead, John Tchicai concentrated on a lyrical melodic approach. So one may wonder why he attracted such interest from hard core avant-garde musicians? The answer may be simple, he was African (His father was Congolese) and thus he had first hand experience with pure African music with its melodic and polyrythmic systems, something any American avant-garde musician craved for. Even more important is that John Tchicai has released an long list of recordings. Tonight we will focus on his duo work with guitarist Pierre Dørge for the SteepleChase label recorded in 1981.Pierre Dørge was leading the New Jungle Orchestra at that time.\n\nMay 4th, 2011: Alsacian clarinet trio: Angster/Hassap/Foltz\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Sometimes I think that there has been some revenge of the clarinet going on in the last few Jazz history decades. Somehow, the French are fascinated with Eric Dolphy's clarinet solos (Alone Together being a corner stone of the genre). Thus explains the Louis Sclavis and Michel Portal. However, in Strasburg, Alsace, Armand Angster is involved with a collective, Accroche Note, that straddles both the world of Jazz and contemporary classical music. One of its components is a clarinet trio (first recording in 1990 with Berlin's FMP) that happily stands up to other famous clarinet trios like Berlin based Gebhard Ullmann's trio and the Brooklynn based The Clarinets (Anthony Burr, Oscar Noriega, Chris Speed) not to mention the legendary clarinet quartet with Alvin Baptiste's Clarinet Summit with John Carter, Jimmy Halmilton and David Murray. Tonight, we will explore Armand Angster's Ramdam (2007) release.\n\nProgram schedule for the month of April 2011\n\nApril 27th, 2011: Post Easter Bunny Bop\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Too much chocolate and well overdue features! Tonight's program is a Jazz oriented Easter Egg Hunt: Featuring Jane Ira Bloom, Christine Fagan, Ludovic Beier, Archie Shepp, Ted Nash, Gary Bartz, Linsey Wellman/Mike Essoudry, Collin Vallon Adela Pege, Ramon Valle, Nino Josele.\n\nApril 20th, 2011: Ivo Perelman\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Brazilian tenor saxophonist Ivo Perelman moved from Sao Paulo, Brazil to Boston in 1981 to study at the Berkley School of Music. Since then, he has been performing and recording both in the US and Europe, namely with pianist Paul Bley and Matthew Shipp. He is known for extreme projects such as his Blue Monk Variations, 1996 where he made a CD exclusively playing Thelonious Monk's Blue Monk in a solo format. Tonight, we will play his Clean Feed double CD, Soulstorm, that has yet another peculiarity, the band. Pedro Costa, producer of Clean Feed offered Perelman to be recorded, but Perelman after accepting the offer told Pedro Costa to find the sidemen. On top of the fact that this project has been achieved with a band that never played together before, the choice of instruments is also out of the ordinary and did not deter Perelman from further engaging. Bass, Torbjörn Zetterberg and Cello, Daniel Levin perfectly blends in with the low register by definition of the tenor. The result is stunning. The conclusion: who needs drums in Jazz? Also, that story is in sharp contrast with the traditional picture of too marketing oriented producers of major labels that are notorious for steering musicians off their holy missions.\n\nApril 13th, 2011: Don Cherry in Copenhagen 1966\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Now that we recovered from the Evan Parker/John Geggie/Jean Martin concert we can look into the future in confidence. However, this also means looking back to the early days of avant-garde Jazz which usually means Europe and more specifically Copenhagen. In the early '60s, there were lots of the founding fathers of avant-garde spending time playing and meeting in Copenhagen. In 1966, Don Cherry assembled an interesting band with saxophonist Gato Barbieri, vibraphonist Karl Berger. The repertoire was also interesting since it included at least an explicit folkloric tune, Black Orpheous and an implicit folkloric tune, Ghosts, a composition of saxophonist Albert Ayler inspired from a Swedish folk song that was also intensively playing Copenhagen these days. Today, this performance and the introduction of Don Cherry about Ayler almost sounds like he knew what was to happen to Ayler less than a half decade later but also that he was a key composer and performer in this new idiom that would leave a subtantial imprit on this music.\n\nApril 6th, 2011: Evan Parker/John Geggie\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: For the avantgarde Jazz aficionados, this week will look like an all hands on deck scenario. Evan Parker, one of the celebrated high-priests of European Free Jazz will be in Town (April 10th at Club Saw). The second noteworthy fact about this concert is that John Geggie will be involved. Geggie has already made some moves to show that he has a deep interest in the new music with several concerts, one of the most staggering being his association with pianist Mailyn Crispell. Although some may think that Geggie is more into Cool Free Jazz, a form devoid of any radicalism, this concert should prove that radicalism is not the essential element of Free Jazz. The Evan Parker House Full Of Floors CD that we will present tonight illustrates that Evan Parker seeks similar esthetical forms. In any case, this concert should reinforce the international stature of Ottawan John Geggie. A comparative study with Geggie's Across the Sky and Geggie Project will be attempted...\n\nProgram schedule for the month of March 2011\n\nMarch 30th, 2011: Japanese Saxophonist Nobuyasu Furuya\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Nobuyasu Furuya moved to Europe from Japan on recommendation of German saxophonist extreme Peter Brötzmann. He played mostly in eastern European countries, settled for five years in Berlin, studied some very exotic Turkish military music (classical Janissary bands) and finally settled in Portugal. Tonight we will feature his first CD that was nominated the best debut release of 2010 (on the Clean Feed label) by the All About Jazz New York Magazine.\n\nMarch 23d, 2011: Toronto multi-reedist Kyle Brenders\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: We've got what you forgot! This sounds like the typical commercial of a well know corner store/dépanneur but in our case, we will feature an artist that you possibly forgot to check out at the IMOO series at the UMI café last Sunday. The IMOO series started too modestly with local avantgarde musicians that are typically considered by the local listeners as worth of little note unless they move out of Ottawa and come back on family visits. However, IMOO quickly got an interest from real out of towners with artists coming from as far as New Brunswick, Vancouver, Montreal and now Toronto with Kyle Brenders. Last Sunday, Kyle Brenders group played the IMOO and revealed a strong influence from Anthony Braxton with who Kyle studied with. They as usual offered CDs for sale that sold well that night as a result of course of the music being played live there that showed some deep research in composition and arranging. I bought the latest CD of the group that IMOO featured and as a bonus I got a Kyle Brenders solo CD. This bonus CD business could suggest that solo recordings are hard to sell. Having always been a great fan of solo concerts in the past, I think that after listening to Brenders Flow and Intensities solo CD I would have personnally been willing to pay $ 10 for the solo CD too.\n\nMarch 16th, 2011: American composer/accordionist Pauline Oliveros\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: from the press release: A true pioneer in the fields of electronic music, free improvisation, and contemporary composition, Pauline Oliveros has been at the forefront of several major musical innovations over the past four decades. The recipient of many honours, she received the 2010 William Schuman award, one of the most prestigious awards for American composers. Her performance practice is rooted in what she calls Deep Listening®, a musical philosophy that is intended to heighten awareness of sound, silence, and sounding. No less a figure than John Cage once remarked \"Through Pauline Oliveros and Deep Listening I finally know what harmony is.... It's about the pleasure of making music.\" In preparation for this exceptional concert, tonight we will play Pauline Oliveros Primordial/Lift 1998 CD.\n\nMarch 9th, 2011: Russian accordionist Evelyn Petrova\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Evelyn Petrova started accordion at age 12 because her grand-mother thought she could play lots of weddings. A more classical training got her beyond weddings but she never forgot the Russian folk music that she grew up with in her grand-mother's village somewhere around St Petersburg. Tonight we will focus on her 2004 Year's Cycle CD that is devoted to the twelve months of a year in which she uses Russian folk songs material from different places in Russia for each month. The music has a very traditional presence. The folk songs are fully played but through various techniques of playing and singing, each of them gets transformed into Free Jazz where central elements of the tradition get boosted sometimes in a histerical way not to mention constantly shifting rythms.\n\nMarch 2nd, 2011: Joelle Léandre, the Stone Quartet\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Joëlle Léandre is one of the formemost European Free Jazz player. She however started in classical avant-garde and even studied with John Cage in the '60s. Over the years she has visited many countries where she usually stays for a year or more as an artist in residence, either studying or performing with the foremost national performers. This includes Berlin, Germany but also Japan and the U.S. Tonight, we will sample her international association with the 2006 Stone Quartet project that includes some of the top American Free Jazz players like Marilyn Crispell, Roy Campbell, jr and Mat Maneri. Léandre is well known for mixing music with acting and this mostly in some dramatic expressions. Unfortunately, this contribution can not be rendered on radio.\n\nProgram schedule for the month of February 2011\n\nFebruary 23d, 2011: Ran Blake tackles the George Gershwin songbook\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Ran Blake is one of the most fascinating pianist. Fortunately, instead of just performing like most Jazz musicians, he devoted most of his career to education, thus transmitting his knowledge to legions of young musicians that includes our local pianist Steve Boudreau that studied with him at the New England Conservatory. Ran Blake has been influenced by two major sources of music, on the Jazz side nothing less than the great Thelonious Monk and on the classical music side Bela Bartok and Igor Strawinski. The result is of course different and he even got a name for it: the Third Stream. His music is a high art of deconstructing the Jazz heritage, extracting an essential melodic line or harmonic pattern and practically re-composing it. Tonight, we will explore this deconstruction principle in his Hatology CD on the George Gershwin song book but I will also play both the graduation recital piece of Steve Boudreau at the New England Conservatory and a small interview on Steve's experience with Ran Blake. You will see or hear for yourself that we are lucky to have a piece of Ran Blake roaming around right here in Ottawa through the Steve Boudreau medium...\n\nFebruary 16th, 2011: Flamenco Jazz of Gerardo Nuñez and Chano Dominguez\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Jazz and Flamenco have a long common history. The most obvious image of their marriage can be found in Gil Evans/Miles Davis Sketches of Spain in the late '50s. John Coltrane during the '60s got involved too. Olé was the result. But in it's constant evolution there was yet another fusion that occurred and ironically during the Jazz Fusion period with Chick Corea's notorious Spain. Further back, Jazz, an off-spring of blues has a distant but determining ancestor in western African music of the griots. That same music trickled its way through Spain along the caravan routes crossing the Saharian desert. All that remained to do was to formally reunite Jazz and Flamenco. This officially occured in the '70s when Flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucia teamed up with Jazz saxophonist Pedro Iturralde. Nowadays in Spain, Flamenco Jazz is a big thing. Any visit to a Spanish CD store will confirm that.\n\nThere has been a Jazz Flamenco project around for a couple of decades now that is called Jazzpaña that actually started with the involvement of Gil Evans but unfortunately his death arrived before the first concert was staged. Currently there is a version II of this project led by pure flamenco guitarist Gerardo Nuñez and jazz/flamenco pianist Chano Dominguez. The later explains his art as follows: In jazz you improvise with a structure in the background and in flamenco [the improvisation] is part of the form. In flamenco, in a soleá, or in a bulera, the guitarist doesn't know what the cantaor is doing until the moment comes, and the cantaor doesn't know the falseta (variation, or melodic phrase, interspersed between successions of chords) that the guitarist is going to play for him.\n\nFebruary 9th, 2011: Rampage on CD re-issues\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Another trip in Europe and a bag full of re-issues with some surprises.\n\n1. Herbie Mann, originally a tenor player decided to break the rules and play the very mellow flute against any odds.\n\n2. Charlie Mingus, the Clown was also a story teller.\n\n3. Cecil Taylor in 1959 was cranking up record after record playing mostly standards but in a way that prefigured the rest of his very successful career.\n\n4. Jelly Roll Morton in the '20 was doing his own re-issues merely by releasing piano rolls.\n\n5. Ran Blake, Steve Lacy and Ricky Ford in 1990 were deconstructing the George Gershwin songbook\n\n6. Herbie Hancock in 1972 was starting to experiment with electric sounds\n\n7. Finally Clarinetist Lajos Dudas pushed the concept a step further by re-issuing a sample of his recordings over a 50 years career period.\n\nFebruary 2nd, 2011: The Art Ensemble of Chicago / Roscoe Mitchell Reissues\n\nHost: David Broscoe:\n\nArt Ensemble - Go Home + Chi Congo (Free Factory) a repackaging of two recordings fom 1970, recorded in Paris. The recordings date from the period just before and just after Famadou Don Moye joined the band. One cut, 'Dance' is for an expanded big band including a string ensemble.\n\nRoscoe Mitchell - The Maze (Delmark) Recorded in 1978, this release contains a long trio for Mitchell, Leo Smith, and George Lewis, a beautiful, quiet solo piece for soprano saxophone, and 'The Maze' a piece for 8 percussionists, featuring an AACM who's who.\n\nProgram schedule for the month of January 2011\n\nJanuary 26th, 2011: The return of Yo Miles!\n\nHost: Rob Bitchofsky: Guitarist Henry Kaiser and trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith formed Yo Miles! in the late 90s to \"explore the alchemical implications of what Miles Davis was doing in the peak electric period, 1973-75.\" Last year, the ensemble released two recordings, Lightening and Shinjuku, with some previously unreleased live and studio cuts, along with the return of some tracks from out-of-print earlier releases. Guest host Rob Bitschofsky checks it out.\n\nJanuary 19th, 2011: Evan Parker's Time Lapse\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Since that day sometime around 1978 or so a young then unknown soprano saxophonist performed at the Saw Gallery on Rideau street, a number of people of this region keep buying CDs from Evan Parker. Three decades later, the concept has not aged at single bit. Evan Parker has a unique technique and concept that few tried to imitate. On the other hand, one could ask how such a concept could survive so long. Jazz has always constantly evolved throughout its history either because the demanding listeners eventually got bored hearing the same thing over and over again or musicians would stretch their creativity to outsmart the competition. Instead, Evan Parker stuck to his multiphonics concept and even to the solo performance concept. Mind you, he sounds like if there were three musicians performing. His performance schedule mainly in festivals all over the world would make any straight-ahead Jazz musician green of envy. Many have attempted to define what he actually does. Minimalistic music is often heard and may not be appropriate since his music at times sounds like a Bach fugue. Someone told me once that Evan told him that he plays in deed Bach fugues every day as an exercise. Minismalistic music is based on constant repetition with little changes. A Bach fugue is a constant flow of intertwining phrases. Quite a difference.\n\nHowever, his style and concepts are in fact also constantly evolving. First of all, even when taking one CD, the various tracks available sound different from each other. In fact, some even say that his music is mostly unpredictable which of course is different than random. In order to puzzle us even more, on his latest recordings of Time Lapse, Evan Parker adds the concept of over-dubbing thus reinforcing his multilayer concept a step further. To me this concept is equivalent to taking his former solo concepts through a magnifying glass that I am sure will help many to understand what his previous concepts were all about. Sometimes, this new music sounds like traditional African music.\n\nTonight we will explore his latest CD, Time Lapse and may be also play a track of African music just to see how it works...\n\nJanuary 12th, 2011: Sam Rivers, from Miles Davis to Free Jazz\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Of the many styles of Free Jazz, Sam Rivers has always belonged to a separate category. His association with the great Miles Davis could have led him in the opposite direction. However, in the '60s, the draw of freedom was stronger. His main contribution was to channel the exhuberance of Free Jazz improvisation in a more ordered framework with more composition and arrangements. This sense of organisation has landed Sam Rivers in many prestigious projects. in the '70s he practically moved his operation in Europe, namely Chateauvallon in France, started to teach in several universities and be recorded by major labels. Tonight we will sample two sets of recordings that illustrate this evolution: first a 1967 recording on the bluenote label.\n\nJanuary 5th, 2011: Schlippenbach's Chamber Free Jazz\n\nHost: Bernard Stepien: Chamber music and Jazz is seemingly a recent combination. Well, this all depends on opinions. For me, most of Cool Jazz of the '50s could qualify for this new fad of Chamber Jazz. A good starting point is to play cello like Esperanza Spalding and ensure that some überinvolved marketing manager doesn't stick around too much so that the music doesn't turn into sticky sirup. However, Chamber Free Jazz has been around for a while. First of all there are a number of Free Jazz cellist around to act as a starter. One of them is Tristan Honsiger, a well know member of the Dutch ICP orchestra. German Pianist Alexander von Schlippenbach pushed the concept even further with his recent trio that not only includes cellist Tristan Hosinger but also a very classical music sounding Italian clarinetist Daniel d'Agaro. While d'Agaro is relatively new to the scene, both Schlippenbach and Honsinger are long established musicians that are known for their penchant for extremes, Schlippenbach for Free Jazz big bands (Globe Unity Orchestra) or trios with multi phonics expert Evan Parker and Honsinger for associations"
