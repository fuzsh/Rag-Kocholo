        "text": "The City of Davenport has hired two firms to look into the causes of the collapsed building that killed three people, but it won’t let the public review the contracts.\n\nThe city says it could bypass the bidding process and city council completely, citing its emergency purchasing powers.\n\nDavenport Alderman Judith Lee says she only heard about the contract while reading the news. She told IPR the city should release it.\n\n“Of course it should be public. It’s being paid for by public funds.”\n\nFellow Davenport Aldermen Derek Cornette wrote in an email he too had not been given the contract.\n\nDavenport Chief Strategy Officer Sarah Ott announced the contract last week. She did not offer an explanation of why the city is withholding it from public view.\n\nIt’s unknown what the contract will cost, what the scope of its work will be and whether there’s a timeline for its work.\n\nA Scott County judge has ordered the City of Davenport to immediately stop \"demolition activity\" at the apartment building that collapsed nearly three weeks ago.\n\nAfter a Friday hearing, the judge also ordered the city and its contractors to halt \"removal of any material or debris\" from the site.\n\nLexus and Quanishia Berry are suing the city and the owner of The Davenport.\n\nThe order in the case will be in effect until Tuesday night. The judge finds the plaintiffs' experts will be \"allowed to visit the site to inspect, survey, photograph and engage in any activity which does not destroy, alter or taint evidence.\"\n\nDavenport must also \"develop a written protocol for inspection of the site\" and it must \"address preservation and inventory\" of items \"designated to be preserved.\"\n\nCrews are knocking down the remainder of the partially collapsed Davenport building that killed three residents. The city has hired two engineering firms to investigate the cause and origin of the partial collapse.\n\nThe fall killed three people, severely injured one and displaced more than 100 residents of the building and those nearby.\n\nThe city says Chicago-based White Birch Group and SOCOTEC Engineering will produce a report that will be first shared with authorities before it’s shared with the public.\n\nThe city has not made this contract available for review. And neither firm nor the city answered questions about how much the work will cost and how the firms were selected.\n\nThe state’s Division of Criminal Investigation is investigating. Scott County Attorney Kelly Cunningham told IPR News their report has not been filed to her office.\n\nCrews on Monday started demolishing the remains of a six-story apartment building in Davenport that partially collapsed more than two weeks ago, killing three people and leaving dozens homeless.\n\nWorkers were using large excavators to dismantle the 116-year-old brick, steel and concrete structure in a process officials said would take several weeks. It’s a difficult task because the building is in the heart of the city’s downtown and is believed to contain asbestos and other potentially hazardous material.\n\nA section of the building fell away May 28, burying three residents in rubble at the base of the structure and forcing others to scramble out of the building. One woman was pinned under the debris and had to have a leg amputated to be pulled to safety.\n\nThe city said in a news release Sunday night that officials have been discussing how to tear down the building with structural engineers, regulatory authorities and the company doing the work. As a precaution, the city ordered that residents of nearby apartments vacate their homes during the demolition.\n\nA judge has ordered the owner of the partially collapsed apartment building in Davenport to pay a $395 civil fine for not maintaining his building, marking the first judge-ordered fine Andrew Wold has been ordered to pay following the collapse.\n\nCity Attorney Tom Warner has said that the size of the fine is inconsequential. He says it prevents Wold from transferring the property and avoiding costs related to its demolition.\n\nWhile Wold’s attorney was present at the proceedings, Wold wasn’t. Outside, ten people protested saying Wold should have been there in person.\n\nLa Shanna Dixon says she understood that it wasn’t a criminal proceeding, but she still felt frustrated Wold wasn’t present.\n\n“He has been hiding the whole time, but he wasn’t hiding when he was collecting money.”\n\nAs of Monday, three lawsuits have been filed against Wold, the city of Davenport and others alleging their negligence contributed to the building’s fall.\n\nFollowing his State of the City address on Monday, Mayor Mike Matson declined to take questions about how the city was changing its inspection process.\n\nThe city is in the process of demolishing the building.\n\nAs the Class of 2023 at Rock Island High stepped up to the stage to receive their diplomas, DeSiree Banks observed her son’s altered posture and distant demeanor.\n\nShe says he looked as if he were going through the motions, moving mechanically in his scarlet graduation robe and cap. The reason was right beside her: an empty seat. On it: a shirt, some buttons — keepsakes set aside for Brandon Colvin Sr.\n\nColvin Sr. rented a unit on the fifth floor of The Davenport, which partially collapsed on May 28. According to his cousin, Mike Collier, the last he or anyone heard from him was the day before Memorial Day. A mutual friend knocked on Colvin Sr.’s door about three hours prior to the collapse, but Colvin Sr. had responded that he needed some rest first.\n\nOn Monday, the city announced that it found the remains of Brandon Colvin Sr., Ryan Hitchcock and Daniel Prien. Colvin’s remains were discovered at noon the day his son walked the graduation stage.\n\n“No answer is gonna be able to fix this. Nothing's gonna be able to fix this. Nothing, nothing at all.”\n\nNow the slow work of holding the responsible accountable has begun.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nTransitional housing agency Humility Homes is trying to find places to live for about a dozen tenants displaced by The Davenport building collapse.\n\nThe nonprofit is working with the Red Cross, and other local agencies are looking for permanent housing for a total of about 100 households. Spokesperson Joshua Graves says Humility Homes is trying to identify \"lenient landlords\" who are willing to help.\n\n\"Understanding that all these people that are displaced have no identification, they don't have anything that's going to be needed in a normal lease agreement. And so, whether it be a landlord that's being understanding of that, or being able to help with the first month's rent, or any of those deposits, just being able to be accommodating and understanding during this time.\"\n\nThis weekend, Humility Homes will hold its annual, \"Welcome Home Block Party.\" Graves says it'll include a resource fair so people can get the help they need from a variety of agencies.\n\nResidents of Davenport flocked to Wednesday night’s city council meeting to get answers about the building that partially collapsed in the city’s downtown.\n\nQuad City Times business reporter Gretchen Teske says the city council didn’t have any answers, but they did allocate about $600,000 in funding to help the building’s residents.\n\n“Now the residents inside are getting $5,000 a piece, and then the people surrounding that were affected -- $1,000. There were three businesses, they're each getting $25,000 a piece. Those come from ARPA funds.”\n\nTeske says there isn’t much information about the investigation into what happened, but both the city and state are involved.\n\nTeske made her comments this afternoon on IPR’s River to River.\n\nA Davenport woman who was rescued from the wreckage of the collapsed apartment building is suing the owner and others for negligence. Peach Berry remains in the hospital. Her wife Lexus Berry spoke at a Wednesday news conference.\n\n“All that we want is just accountability to be able to have closure and to know why this happened and to be able to move forward with our lives. We definitely most importantly want you guys to know that we are not victims to the situation. We are survivors.”\n\nEight hours after the May 28 collapse, Berry was extracted from beneath the rubble. She was trapped until rescuers amputated her left leg above the knee.\n\nThe separate lawsuit filed Wednesday by another resident of the building names owner Andrew Wold, several LLCs connected to him, as well as his property management company, engineer firm and contractors. It also names the City of Davenport and the building’s prior owner.\n\nThe Berrys’ lawsuit is the second to be filed in connection with the incident.\n\nThe Quad Cities Salvation Army has been busy the past five days providing more than 1,600 meals to emergency personnel.\n\nBut now that Iowa Task Force One has demobilized and left, the organization has a new task -- finding permanent housing for displaced tenants of the apartment building that partially collapsed over Memorial Day weekend.\n\nSalvation Army spokesperson Patty Mixdorf says the Salvation Army is regrouping.\n\n\"Everyone, not just the [Salvation] Army, we are working with several families. We started to do case work with and to try and help them find an apartment. But then it starts with home things for their new apartment. A lot of them don't have anything left.\"\n\nFinding apartments for displaced tenants of The Davenport apartments will not be easy. Mixdorf says affordable apartments are hard to find.\n\n“Right now, the apartment situation is so tight. We pay for the rent for folks that come into our system and really have terrible trouble finding apartments because they're so expensive right now.\"\n\nFood, hygiene supplies and clothing vouchers are available at the Salvation Army location at 100 Kirkwood Blvd. in Davenport. Its 4001 North Brady St. location is accepting donations of furniture and other household items, but not mattresses.\n\nThe first lawsuit of what could be many was filed Monday following the partial collapse of an apartment building in Davenport. Dayna Feuerbach is suing building owner Andrew Wold, LLCs connected to his property, as well as Wold’s hired engineering firm and contractors for negligence and inflicting emotional distress.\n\nThe suit says Wold “miserably failed” to satisfy his duties to his tenants. It alleges this negligence exposed more than 50 residents, including Feuerbach, to “extreme and unacceptable” harm that ultimately led to three people – Brandon Colvin, Sr., Ryan Hitchcock and Daniel Prien – dying in the wreckage.\n\nFeuerback, represented by Philadelphia-based structural collapse attorney Jeffery Goodman, is seeking compensation for damages.\n\nGoodman led a plaintiffs’ litigation team that resulted in the $1.2 billion settlement to the families of the 98 people who died and the survivors of the Surfside, Florida Condo collapse in 2022.\n\n“By filing a civil lawsuit, we’re able to help get answers to what happened and why it happened, able to determine who is accountable and hold them accountable and hopefully by doing so to help inspire change,\" Goodman said.\n\nThe City of Davenport, as well as the building’s prior ownership Waukee Investments of Bettendorf and Parkwild Properties, were also named in the lawsuit.\n\nThe multi-agency responders at the partially collapsed building in Davenport are now turning their attention to shoring and securing the building.\n\nOn Thursday night, Iowa Task Force One finished its survey of the building. Three residents are still missing. Thursday night, dogs and handlers were patrolling the wreckage looking for their remains.\n\nIn a news conference, Task Force One’s Chief Rick Halleran said their work has to be responsive to the changing conditions of the building to keep his team safe.\n\n“This building — as I’ve stated — is very dynamic. As the temperature rises up and down during the day, this building is expanding and contracting. So it’s talking to us. It’s telling us what it wants to do. Some of it is … as much as we want to, we can’t because the building’s not letting us.”\n\nAlready, supports have been installed on the building exterior. While the building will eventually fall, these support will help prevent that collapse from happening on its own.\n\nCity Administrator Corri Spiegel said the building is likely “filled with asbestos” based on its age.\n\nCity officials say The Davenport apartment building remains structurally unsound and could fall at any time.\n\nThere are still three people unaccounted for following the 80-unit apartment building’s partial collapse over Memorial Day weekend. Chief of Police Jeff Bladel says Branden Colvin, Ryan Hitchcock and Daniel Prien are suspected to still be in the wreckage.\n\nTwo others who had been listed as missing have been accounted for.\n\nThe city had planned to demolish the building Tuesday, but on Monday, a resident was discovered on the fourth floor. Mayor Mike Matson maintains that the city has been focused on rescue efforts.\n\nAccording to city inspection records, residents of the building suffered from chronic loss of heat and regular water issues. Since the beginning of the year, MidAmerican Energy, the city and the building’s contracted engineer have had concerns about the safety of the building’s western façade.\n\nOne moment Lexus Berry and her wife were rushing toward the door of their fourth-floor apartment, and the next, Quanishia “Peach” Berry was gone.\n\nTheir apartment disappeared into a heap of bricks and steel far below, leaving Lexis Berry running by herself to a stairwell in the teetering building, panicked that she might never see her wife again.\n\n“The moment that we hit the door, it started to shake and rattle and literally — it all just happened in the blink of a second – the floors caved in, like collapsed,” Lexus Berry said Wednesday. “So as the floors were falling, and she was falling four stories down, there were still two stories above her falling and two stories falling above me. It was all crumbling.”\n\nIt took hours before rescuers found Peach Berry trapped in the rubble and then determined one of her legs would need to be amputated to pull her free. Lexus Berry gave her assent. Doctors removed the leg and rushed her to a hospital, mindful that the remainder of the building could come down at any time.\n\n“It’s definitely something that’s like a miracle that she’s here,” Lexus Berry said. “Due to the circumstances, they had to make a judgment call. And that’s the best thing for her, honestly, because she’s still here.”\n\nThree residents of The Davenport are still unaccounted for, according to police.\n\nEarlier this week, authorities said five people were missing, but Davenport Police Chief Jeff Bladel said during a media briefing Thursday morning that two of them have since been accounted for and are safe. One moved out of the building a month ago and was found in Texas, and the other was found locally.\n\nThe six-story building partially collapsed shortly before 5 p.m. Sunday. The city has since released documents, including structural engineering reports, that show the building’s owner was warned that the parts of the building were unstable.\n\nAn engineer’s report dated May 24, just days before the collapse, suggested patches in the west side of the building’s brick façade “appear ready to fall imminently” and could be a safety hazard to cars or passersby.\n\nThe engineer’s report also detailed that window openings, some filled and some unfilled, were insecure. In one case, the openings were “bulging outward” and looked “poised to fall.” Inside the first floor, unsupported window openings help “explain why the façade is currently about to topple outward.”\n\n“The brick façade is unlikely to be preserved in place, but it can be brought down in a safe, controlled manner,” the report stated.\n\nAndrew Wold, the building’s owner, released a statement dated Tuesday — his first comments since the partial collapse — saying “our thoughts and prayers are with our tenants” and that his company, Davenport Hotel, L.L.C., is working with agencies to help them.\n\nCounty records show Davenport Hotel, L.L.C. acquired the building in 2021 in a deal worth $4.2 million. The city later declared the building a nuisance due to numerous solid waste violations, and a judge ordered Wold to pay a $4,500 penalty after he did not appear in court.\n\nBefore Andrew Wold’s downtown Davenport apartment building partially collapsed, displacing more than 50 residents and leaving five missing, red flags abounded in the inspection history of 324 Main Street.\n\nLate Wednesday afternoon, the city of Davenport released a trove of documents including engineering reports and a log of city code complaints that paint a picture of a troubled property and ominous details leading to its collapse. Far from ignoring these warnings, Davenport officials watched over the property in real-time.\n\nOne of the earliest in the city’s records release was from the beginning of 2020. The department was preparing to inspect the building and determine whether it met the requirements for a rental permit. The entry was written by a city inspector with the initials “TCH.”\n\nThat inspector wrote the violations at the property — then owned by Waukee Investments LLC — were severe. TCH also wrote that they brought this to the attention of Davenport’s Director of Development and Neighborhood Services Rich Oswald, who said, “I’M NOT AFRAID OF CLOSING THE BUILDING DOWN. GO AHEAD AND PROCEED.”\n\nThe inspection did proceed. And the city did not close the building down.\n\nThat August, Assistant Fire Marshall Jim Morris reported that bricks were falling from the building’s façade onto the sidewalk below and the wall above the sixth floor was coming loose. City officials met with then-owner Mark Roemer as well as contractors and got to work securing the wall with lumber.\n\nIt was at this time that the city began to include Wold in emails involving the building’s inspections with the “understanding” that he was in the process of purchasing the property.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nDavenport city records indicate the city issued three permits since 2020 for repairs to the exterior wall of The Davenport hotel apartment building, which partially collapsed over Memorial Day weekend.\n\nIn May, the city ordered the building’s owners to replace 100 linear feet of brick exterior. The city currently notes that The Davenport failed an inspection. However, an archived version of the same permit’s inspection status showed the building passed an inspection.\n\nDavenport Hotel LLC purchased the 16,200-square-foot building in 2021 for $4.1 million. Records show the registered agent for Davenport Hotel LLC is Andrew Wold.\n\nAccording to property records, the building had 80 units before the collapse. The apartment’s rent ranged anywhere from $600 for a one-bedroom apartment to roughly $1,000 for a three-bedroom.\n\nThe nearly 100-year-old building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and was renovated in the 1980s.\n\nDavenport Mayor Mike Matson emphasized during a press conference on Tuesday that an apartment building in the city that partially collapsed on Sunday remains dangerous.\n\nWhile search efforts continue, a contracted structural engineer says the building could collapse further at any time. The city’s movement toward demolishing the building slowed when resident Lisa Brooks was found on the fourth floor Monday.\n\n“We haven’t demoed it. We understood this … our continuous evaluation of what to do or not to do happened in real time. You did not see anything moving towards that building.”\n\nThe collapse leaves over 50 residents displaced. The city is now focused on exhausting recovery options.\n\nThe mayor added that donations for the displaced should be sent to the American Red Cross, which is managing recovery efforts.\n\nFive people are still unaccounted for following the partial collapse of an apartment building in Davenport. The city says two of those people are likely still in the wreckage.\n\nDavenport officials were moving ahead with plans for demolishing the building Monday when Lisa Brooks was rescued from the fourth floor. Since then, protesters have called for the city to slow its demolition as two men, Brandon Colvin and Ryan Hitchcock, might still be found.\n\nAt a news conference, Hitchcock’s first cousin Amy Anderson said she wants the search to go on, but the threat of further collapse also puts first responder lives at risk.\n\n“It’s a tough balance. It's life for life. It just is a hard situation, but what we ultimately want is them to find and recover Ryan.”\n\nThe city says it has halted its demolition plans for now, and will further search for survivors and remains.\n\nDuring a press conference Tuesday morning, Davenport Police Chief Mike Blaydel says they now believe two people are still inside the building.\n\n“We have five that are unaccounted for and two that we have a firm belief that are potentially still in that building.\"\n\nBlaydel says officials have been checking and double-checking sources of information to try and get a list of tenants.\n\nDavenport Fire Marshal James Morris says the apartment remains an unsafe site.\n\n“As has been noted since day one that we’ve responded there that building is unstable and it continues to worsen as time progresses.”\n\nHe says they hope to figure out a way to safely conduct another search.\n\n“It’s the opinion of the structural engineer that any additional search operations in the area of that pile debris should be avoided due to potential collapse. We are currently evaluating the risk assessment of where we can go back into that building to do this other search.”\n\nA woman was rescued last night from the building. Davenport Mayor Mike Matson says they do not know how the woman was missed in multiple searches of the building or how she got there.\n\nMatson also addressed concerns raised by protesters when the city said it was preparing to demolish the building with the possibility of people remaining in the rubble. He says they want to do what they can while ensuring no one else is injured or killed.\n\n“We are investigating and evaluating as best as we can with a lot of assistance from places other than here.”\n\nOfficials say five people remain unaccounted for, including two individuals who may be within the rubble of an apartment building in Davenport that partially collapsed on Sunday.\n\nAt a news conference held Tuesday, Mayor Mike Matson confirmed the numbers. The city faces criticism for announcing plans to demolish the building before ensuring no one else is inside.\n\nProtests erupted outside the apartment after a woman was rescued Monday night, hours after the city ordered the demolition to begin as early as Tuesday.\n\nFire Marshal James Morris warned that the building is unstable and its condition \"continues to worsen as time progresses.\"\n\nAbout 100 people gathered in downtown Davenport Tuesday morning to tell the city not to move ahead with plans to demolish a partially-collapsed apartment building.\n\nProtesters say at least two people are missing and might still be alive in the wreckage.\n\nA rack of clothes was exposed by the collapse. Davenport resident Mike Collier says they belong to Brandon Colvin, who has been missing since the collapse. Collier says he distrusts the city’s search effort.\n\n“Yesterday, they found a woman, they said they had searched through all the building and no one was in there. But yesterday they found a woman. It's evident that they don’t really know if anyone is still in the building.”\n\nThe building belongs to Andrew Wold, who owns a number of properties downtown."
