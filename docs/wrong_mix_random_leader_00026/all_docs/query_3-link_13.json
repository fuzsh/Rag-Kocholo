        "text": "Restored Bix documentary to be shown in Davenport July 31\n\nA week before the 2022 Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival, the Bix Museum and World Archives and Bix Jazz Society will present a public screening of the newly restored documentary “BIX: ‘Ain’t None of Them Play Like Him Yet.”\n\nThe film will be shown Sunday, July 31st at 1 p.m. in the Figge Art Museum auditorium, 225 W. 2nd St., Davenport. Tickets will be $5, and members of the Bix Museum or Bix Society can get a free ticket at the doors the day of the screening.\n\nThe showing will be the first QC look since the doc’s original release, and its 2020 restoration in 4K by filmmaker Brigitte Berman…\n\n23 Best Things to do in Davenport, Iowa\n\nWhen choosing a vacation destination for yourself, you and some friends, or you and your family, Davenport may not immediately come to mind.\n\nThis small city on the western shore of the Mississippi River in Iowa is home to a little over 100,000 people and might not seem like much when you pass through it on I-80.\n\nHowever, you’d be surprised; there is actually quite a bit to see and do in Davenport, and whether you’re there on business, are there visiting family, or choose it as your actual vacation destination, you’re sure to have a good time – and a far better time than you may expect before you go…\n\n'So far ahead of anyone else': The life and legacy of Bix Beiderbecke\n\nThe first place Chris Beiderbecke learned of his great-uncle Bix Beiderbecke’s fame was from a World Book Encyclopedia. Beiderbecke, in grade school at the time, looked up his last name while in the library, and found more than he was expecting.\n\nBefore that book, he knew Bix Beiderbecke— a world-famous jazz musician in the 1920s — only as his great-uncle, the man who stood as a groomsman in his grandfather’s wedding and who played piano for his grandmother when she was pregnant to soothe her…\n\nBix Museum Raising $12,000 For Renovation With Three Vital Artifacts\n\nThe Bix Beiderbecke Museum and World Archives in downtown Davenport is raising funds to renovate their permanent exhibit with three of the most important artifacts acquired to date.\n\nThe $12,000 project will make it possible to permanently display Don Murray’s tenor saxophone and Bix’s tuxedo jacket and traveling trunk during the Paul Whiteman years in the museum…\n\nQUAD CITY ARTS AWARDS $84+K TO 25 LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS\n\nQuad City Arts is excited to be able to provide over $84,000 in funding for 25 organizations, arts-centered programs, and individual artists in 2021.\n\nThe goal of the Arts Dollars Project and Education Grants is to provide funding for a variety of organizations and projects that have strong community impact and feature unique and interesting artistic ideas and to ensure that artists are being paid in the process.\n\nCapacity-Building Grants are highly competitive and specially designed for arts-centered nonprofit organizations who are seeking support to expand their reach and impact through the arts in their community…."
