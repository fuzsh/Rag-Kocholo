        "text": "Have you watched Loudermilk on Amazon Prime Video? It's got Ron Livingston from Office Space...but that might not be the only reason to tune in.\n\nTurns out they've got great taste in music too. The Quad Cities very own Lissie made an appearance and 3 Years Hollow gets mentioned by the man who starred in one of the best cult classic films of all time.\n\nIn the clip from Loudermilk, S3E9 posted by 3 Years Hollow singer, Jose Urquiza, Sam Loudermilk asks Lissie where she's from. \"Illinois, originally\". \"What part?\", Loudermilk asks. \"Rock Island\" she says.\n\n\"Quad Cities, right? Yeah, 3 Years Hollow is from there. Great videos.\"\n\nI remember working at Lumpy's when we were pushing the Progressive Drafts where you could load up on dime drafts before they go up by a dime every 15 minutes. A buddy of mine grabbed me and said I HAD to go to Stickman's to see this girl play.\n\nLissie was incredible even back then. I bought a CD and it still sounds great.\n\nI'm super happy to see her success as a musician...but now to see her on the screen is super fun.\n\nIt truly says what kind of person she is that she's also bringing along her QC musicians for the ride whenever possible. Even just for a quick shoutout.\n\nCongrats to all of those involved. What a cool thing to wake up to this morning. Can't wait to dig into Loudermilk (full disclosure, we tried a few months ago but it got a little too cussy for the kiddies)."
