        "text": "Downtown is filled with rich history, from being the home of sliced bread to being on the cutting edge by hosting the first Virtual Reality tournament in the state of Iowa!\n\nDowntown is home to four districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The vast majority of downtown benefits from these designations, making properties eligible for federal and state historic preservation tax credits that can be used by investors and developers to help finance renovations, and spur further redevelopment. Davenport's rich architectural and cultural history is celebrated through these designated districts that unlock additional resources to shape an attractive and vibrant future for our community.\n\nThe Davenport Commercial Historic District (NRHP 2020) is a 49-acre section containing a variety of commercial, governmental, domestic, social, religious, recreational, and light industrial buildings, as well as some rail-related transportation resources.\n\nDavenport Motor Row and Industrial Historic District (NRHP 2019) consists of six-and-half blocks containing 28 buildings, one former rail siding, and one railroad crossing bridge in Davenport. This Historic District is located on the east end of the downtown Davenport commercial business district, one block north of the river and encompasses about 6 acres.\n\nThe Crescent Warehouse Historic District (NRHP 2003) occupies a roughly rectangular shaped piece of ground containing 14 factory and warehouse buildings and two railroad related structures. The District is located east of downtown Davenport and four blocks north of the Mississippi River, covering portions of East 4th Street, East 5th Street, Iowa Street & Pershing Avenue."
