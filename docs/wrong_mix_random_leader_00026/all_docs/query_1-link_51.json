        "text": "Live in a home as unique as you are. Cook Legacy Village was originally built as a Victorian mansion. In 2013, the second and third floors were remodeled into nine beautiful senior living apartments. The first floor has remained largely untouched and stays true to its era with stained glass, original woodwork and antique furniture.\n\nHere, tenants are like a close-knit family and stay active on campus and in the community. Every apartment is move-in ready with maintenance-free appliances, including a washer and dryer. Like all Good Samaritan Society communities, our Cook Legacy Village tenants enjoy comfortable, smoke-free apartments and have access to a variety of amenities that enhance their lives. Tenants are free to use the common areas on the first floor and each will have a space in the garage.\n\nWe want you to feel at home in your new apartment. It is yours to decorate any way you wish with the furnishings, decorations and mementos that are special to you.\n\nView the Cook Legacy Village virtual tour.\n\nIf you’re looking for a senior living community that helps you live as independently as possible – with support available should you need it – look no further than Heritage Court.
