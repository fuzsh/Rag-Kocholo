        "text": "The RiverCenter and Adler Theatre are located just two blocks away from the banks of the Mississippi River in the heart of downtown Davenport, Iowa. The RiverCenter is one of largest meeting/convention facilities in the Quad Cities & Midwest. This two-building venue offers 100,000 square feet of flexible space along with a column-free exhibit hall, large banquet hall, 10 expandable meeting rooms and an executive board room; all connected by a climate-controlled skywalk between the two buildings. A City-owned parking ramp is attached, as well as other parking within close proximity. RiverCenter services include event coordination, catering, utilities, audio-visual services and decorating.\n\nThe historic and beautiful Adler Theatre was born out of the 1926 RKO Orpheum theater, and still reflects its style with its gold leaf ceiling, crystal light fixtures and black ebony, walnut and marble detail. Much of that original movie theatre style remains and continues to recall the rich history of the Adler Theatre. Today, the Adler Theatre presents a diverse line-up of live, theatrical productions featuring celebrity headliners, first-rate Broadway shows, comedians, Festival of Trees, and more."
