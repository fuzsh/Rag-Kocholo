$605,536,272,000 for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies. Of this amount, $142,800,000,000 is current year discretionary funding, including offsets. OVERVIEW AND BILL HIGHLIGHTS The Labor, HHS, and Education and Related Agencies bill constitutes the largest of the non-defense Federal appropriations bills being considered by Congress this year. It is the product of extensive deliberations, driven by the realization that no task before Congress is more important than safeguarding and improving the health and well-being of all Americans. This bill is made up of over 300 programs, spanning three Federal Departments and numerous related agencies. But the bill is more than its component parts. Virtually every element of this bill reflects the traditional ideal of democracy: that every citizen deserves the right to a basic education and job skills training; protection from illness and want; and an equal opportunity to reach one's highest potential. This bill at the same time provides a safety net of social protections for the needy while stimulating advances in human achievement and the life sciences. At its core, this bill embodies those defining principles by which any free society must be guided: compassion for the less fortunate; respect for family and loved ones; acceptance of personal responsibility for one's actions; character development; and the avoidance of destructive behavior. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BILL Job Training.--The Committee recommendation includes $5,089,620,000 for job training programs, an increase of $677,215,000 over the budget request, but $27,846,000 below the comparable 2006 level. This includes $1,629,788,000 for the Office of Job Corps, and $1,476,064,000 for Dislocated Worker Assistance. Worker Protection.--The Committee bill includes $1,620,700,000 to ensure the health and safety of workers, including $249,789,000 for the National Labor Relations Board, $491,167,000 for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and $300,436,000 for the Mine Safety and Health Administration. The recommendation is an increase of $76,300,000 over the 2006 level. Child Labor.--The Committee bill includes $72,516,000 for activities designed to end abusive child labor. This is $60,153,000 above the budget request, but the same as the 2006 level. National Institutes of Health.--A total of $28,550,667,000 is recommended to fund biomedical research at the 27 Institutes and Centers that comprise the NIH. This represents an increase of $220,820,000 over the fiscal year 2006 level and $200,664,000 over the budget request. Health Centers.--The recommendation includes $1,926,076,000 for health centers, $145,000,000 over the fiscal 2006 level. Substance Abuse.--The Committee bill provides $3,336,812,000 for substance abuse prevention and treatment programs. Included in this amount is $2,130,757,000 for substance abuse treatment, $196,729,000 for substance abuse prevention and $911,805,000 for mental health programs. Low-income Home Energy Assistance State Grants.--The Committee recommends $2,161,170,000 for heating and cooling assistance for low-income individuals and families, $379,170,000 above the budget request and $1,485,000 more than the 2006 comparable level. Head Start.--The Committee recommendation includes $6,788,571,000 for the Head Start Program. This represents an increase of $3,709,000 over the 2006 comparable level. Persons With Disabilities.--To promote independent living in home and community-based settings. This includes $27,655,000 for the Office of Disability Employment Policy at the Department of Labor, $15,720,000 for Disabled Voter Services and $10,000,000 for Real Choice Systems Change Grants through the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. Education for the Disadvantaged.--The Committee has provided $14,447,189,000 in grants to enhance educational opportunities for disadvantaged children. Educator Professional Development.--The Committee recommends $3,470,374,000 for various professional development programs administered by the Department of Education. English Language Acquisition.--The Committee recommends $669,007,000 for bilingual education. Student Financial Aid.--The Committee recommends $14,488,458,000 for student financial assistance. The Pell Grant Program continues its current maximum grant award of $4,050. Higher Education Initiatives.--The Committee bill provides $2,002,692,000 for initiatives to provide greater opportunities for higher education, including $828,178,000 for Federal TRIO programs and $303,423,000 for GEAR UP. Education for Individuals With Disabilities.--The Committee bill provides $11,400,112,000 to help ensure that all children have access to a free and appropriate education, and that all infants and toddlers with disabilities have access to early intervention services. Rehabilitation Services.--The bill recommends $3,248,312,000 for rehabilitation services. These funds are essential for families with disabilities seeking employment. The Committee restored funding for several important programs proposed for elimination, such as Supported Employment State Grants, Projects with Industry, Recreational programs and programs for migrant and seasonal farmworkers. Services for Older Americans.--For programs serving older Americans, the Committee recommendation includes $2,941,563,000. This recommendation includes $217,592,000 for senior volunteer programs, $432,311,000 for community service employment for older Americans, $350,595,000 for supportive services and centers, $156,167,000 for family caregiver support programs and $715,070,000 for senior nutrition programs. For the medical research activities of the National Institute on Aging, the Committee recommends $1,039,828,000. The Committee recommendation also includes not less than $30,000,000 for the Medicare insurance counseling program. Corporation for Public Broadcasting.--The Committee bill recommends an advance appropriation for fiscal year 2009 of $400,000,000 for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In addition, the Committee bill includes $29,700,000 for conversion to digital broadcasting and $36,000,000 for the replacement project of the interconnection system in fiscal year 2007 funding. REPROGRAMMING AND TRANSFER AUTHORITY The Committee has included bill language delineating permissible transfer authority in general provisions for each of the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, as well as specifying reprogramming authority in a general provision applying to all funds provided under this act. COMPARISONS TO HOUSE BILL The comparisons in this report are to the House reported version of the bill. The Committee has initiated an original Senate bill, since the House of Representatives has not yet taken action on H.R. 5647 as reported by the House Appropriations Committee. TITLE I DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Employment and Training Administration TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES Appropriations, 2006 \\1\\................................ $3,524,708,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 2,910,803,000 House allowance......................................... 3,443,899,000 Committee recommendation................................ 3,459,832,000 \\1\\ Excludes $125,000,000 in emergency supplemental appropriations pursuant to Public Law 109-148. The Committee recommends $3,459,832,000 for this account in 2007 which provides funding primarily for activities under the Workforce Investment Act [WIA]. This is $64,876,000 less than the comparable 2006 level, $15,933,000 more than the House allowance, and $549,029,000 over the administration request. The Committee recommendation does not include the $325,000,000 rescission of prior year funds proposed by the House, for which there was no budget request. Training and employment services is comprised of programs designed to enhance the employment and earnings of economically disadvantaged and dislocated workers, operated through a decentralized system of skill training and related services. This appropriation is generally forward-funded on a July-to- June cycle. Funds provided for fiscal year 2007 will support the program from July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008. Beginning with the fiscal year 2000 appropriation, budget constraints required that a portion of this account's funding be advance appropriated, yet still available for the forward- funded program year. This practice will continue in this year's appropriation. Pending reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act the Committee is acting on a current law request, deferring without prejudice proposed legislative language under the jurisdiction of the authorizing committees. The Committee recommendation retains language from last year's bill requiring that the Department take no action to amend, through regulatory or other administrative action, the definition established in 20 CFR 677.220 for functions and activities under title I of the Workforce Investment Act until such time as legislation reauthorizing the Act is enacted. Similar language was included in the House bill. The Committee expects that, while the Workforce Investment Act is in the process of being altered and renewed, the Administration will refrain from unilateral changes to the administration, operation and financing of employment and training programs. Specifically, the Committee expects that no funds be utilized for the proposed career advancement account initiative unless specifically authorized by law. Adult Employment and Training.--For Adult Employment and Training Activities, the Committee recommends $800,000,000, which is $88,000,000 more than the budget request, $54,000,000 less than the House allowance, and $64,199,000 less than the program year 2006 level. This program is formula-funded to States and further distributed to local workforce investment boards. Services for adults will be provided through the One- Stop system and most customers receiving training will use their individual training accounts to determine which programs and providers fit their needs. The act authorizes core services, which will be available to all adults with no eligibility requirements, and intensive services, for unemployed individuals who are not able to find jobs through core services alone. Dislocated Worker Assistance.--For Dislocated Worker Assistance, the Committee recommends $1,476,064,000, $4,161,000 more than the comparable program year 2006 level, $361,482,000 more than the budget request, and the same as the House allowance. Of the total, $1,193,264,000 is designated for State formula grants. This program is a State-operated effort which provides core services, intensive services, training, and supportive services to help permanently separated workers return to productive, unsubsidized employment. In addition, States use these funds for rapid response assistance to help workers affected by mass layoffs and plant closures. Also, States may use these funds to carry out additional statewide employment and training activities, which may include implementation of innovative incumbent and dislocated worker training programs, and programs such as Advanced Manufacturing Integrated Systems Technology. The recommendation includes $282,800,000 available to the Secretary for activities such as responding to mass layoffs, plant and/or military base closings, and natural disasters across the country, which cannot be otherwise anticipated, as well as technical assistance and training and demonstration projects, including community college initiatives. The Committee bill continues language authorizing the use of funds under the dislocated workers program for projects that provide assistance to new entrants in the workforce and incumbent workers, as well as to provide assistance where there have been dislocations across multiple sectors or local areas of a State. The Committee recommendation includes, as it has in past years, funding for dislocated worker projects aimed at assisting the long-term unemployed. The Committee is encouraged by the administration's efforts in addressing our Nation's nursing shortage. Native Hawaiians, along with other ethnic minority populations throughout rural America, feel this critical shortage much more acutely. The Department is strongly urged to work collaboratively with nursing programs amidst such populations to facilitate opportunities for summer employment of nursing students. The Committee is aware of the economic diversification opportunity brought on by the human and natural resources released by the recently announced closure of a century old pineapple plantation on Oahu and recommends that collaboration between the Hawaii Department of Labor and Industrial relations and the Hawaii Farm Bureau Federation to promote and sponsor multiculturally farm food safety training. The Committee urges sensitive consideration of this and other employment challenges posed to the people of Hawaii as a result of torrential rains and devastating floods. Community-Based Job Training Initiative.--The Committee recommendation includes $125,000,000 to carry out the Community College/Community-Based Job Training Grant initiative, compared to the $150,000,000 request. The Committee recommendation allocates $125,000,000 from National Emergency Grant funds available under section 132(a)(2)(A) of the Workforce Investment Act, as does the House bill for this initiative. The Secretary is expected to initially use resources from the National Emergency Grants account for these awards that are designated for non-emergencies under sections 171(d) and 170(b) of the Workforce Investment Act. Community Based Job Training Grant awards will also be subject to the limitations of sections 171(c)(4)(A) through 171(c)(4)(C) of the Workforce Investment Act to ensure that these grants are awarded competitively. Funds used for this initiative should strengthen partnerships between workforce investment boards, community colleges, and employers, to train workers for high growth, high demand industries in the new economy. The Committee encourages the Employment and Training Administration to consider, in future solicitations for grant applications for the Community Based Job Training Initiative, including One Stop Career Centers, and in rural areas and other communities without community colleges, eligibility of alternative education and training providers to apply for these grants. Youth Training.--For Youth Training, the Committee recommends $935,500,000, which is $95,000,000 more than the budget request and the same as House allowance. The purpose of Youth Training is to provide eligible youth with assistance in achieving academic and employment success through improving educational and skill competencies and providing connections to employers. Other activities include providing mentoring opportunities, opportunities for training, supportive services, summer employment opportunities that are directly linked to academic and occupational learning, incentives for recognition and achievement, and activities related to leadership development, citizenship, and community service. Youthbuild.--Like the House, the Committee recommendation requires that within the amount made available for youth activities, up to $50,000,000 may be dedicated toward the Youthbuild program. The Committee concurs with House bill language that all funds shall revert to the youth formula grant program if the Youth build program is not authorized for transfer to the Labor Department by April 1, 2007. Job Corps.--The Committee recommendation continues funding the Job Corps program as an independent entity reporting to the Office of the Secretary of Labor. The budget request and House allowance recommend returning the program to the Employment and Training Administration. This program is described in a separate account in this report. Responsible Reintegration of Youthful Offenders.--The Committee recommendation includes $60,000,000, to continue funding for the current Responsible Reintegration of Youthful Offenders program. Neither the budget request nor the House allowance included funding for this program, which was funded at $49,104,000 in program year 2006. The Responsible Reintegration of Youthful Offenders program targets critical funding to help prepare and assist young offenders to return to their communities. The program also provides support, opportunities, education and training to youth who are court- involved and on probation, in aftercare, on parole, or who would benefit from alternatives to incarceration or diversion from formal judicial proceedings. The Committee commends the work of the Second Chance Program of San Diego for its exemplary recidivism reduction program. The State of California is particularly in need of reentry services, as it houses 40 percent of our Nation's inmates. Second Chance is one of the STRIVE network of program affiliates previously supported by the Department. The Committee expects the Department to support Second Chance through funding to expand and replicate its recidivism prevention program. The Committee is aware of the Ready4Work demonstration created in 2003 to strengthen local support networks, in areas of high crime, for young adults as they reenter their communities following detention and/or incarceration. The Committee expects the Department to support Public/Private Ventures through funding to ensure the effectiveness of these initiatives through the continued design, testing and study of ex-offender assistance. Prisoner Re-entry.--The recommendation does not include separate funding for the prisoner re-entry initiative, instead expanding funding under the Responsible Reintegration of Youthful Offenders Program. The House did not include funding for this initiative for which the budget requested the current level of $19,642,000. Native Americans.--For Native Americans, the Committee recommends $50,000,000, the same as the House allowance, compared to the budget request of $51,548,000 and the $53,696,000 enacted program year 2006 level. This program is designed to improve the economic well-being of Native Americans (Indians, Eskimos, Aleuts, and Native Hawaiians) through the provision of training, work experience, and other employment- related services and opportunities that are intended to aid the participants to secure permanent, unsubsidized jobs. Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers.--For Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers, the Committee recommends $80,657,000, compared to the 2006 enacted level of $79,756,000. Authorized by the Workforce Investment Act, this program is designed to serve members of economically disadvantaged families whose principal livelihood is derived from migratory and other forms of seasonal farmwork, or fishing, or logging activities. Enrollees and their families are provided with employment training and related services intended to prepare them for stable, year- round employment within and outside of the agriculture industry. The Committee notes that for the past 3 fiscal years, this program has exceeded the goals set for it by the Department of Labor. There are at least 3 million hard-working migrant and seasonal farmworkers in America whose annual incomes are below $10,000. At a time when most State budgets are shrinking and many of the basic services provided by State and local governments are being cut back, the Committee recognizes the importance of sustaining a national commitment, dating from 1964, to help alleviate the chronic seasonal unemployment and underemployment that traps many farmworker families in a cycle of poverty across generations and that deprives many farmworker children of educational opportunities and real prospects for better jobs at higher wages. The Committee also recognizes that many State and local government officials will be reluctant to fund this training and related assistance for this vulnerable portion of our Nation's workforce who migrate through many States every year, even though the work they perform is essential to the economic well-being of our Nation's farmers, growers, and small businesses. The Committee recommendation of $80,657,000 for program year 2007 activities authorized under section 167 of the Workforce Investment Act is reflected in two separate line items on the table accompanying the Committee Report: ``Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers'' and ``National Activities/Other.'' Under the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers line item, the Committee recommends $80,053,000. The Committee recommendation includes bill language directing that $5,000,000 of this amount be used for migrant and seasonal farmworker housing grants, of which not less than 70 percent shall be for permanent housing. The principal purpose of these funds is to continue the network of local farmworker housing organizations working on permanent housing solutions for migrant and seasonal farmworkers. The Committee encourages greater emphasis on the southeast region for farmworker housing grants. The recommendation also provides that the remaining amount of $75,053,000 be used for State service area grants, including funding grantees in those States impacted by formula reductions to at least the amount they were alloted in program year 2004. Within the National Activities/ Other line item, the Committee recommendation includes $604,000 to be used for Section 167 training, technical assistance and related activities, including funds for migrant rest center activities. The Committee urges the Department to continue valuable technical assistance services provided by the Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs. Finally, the Committee wishes to again advise the Department regarding the requirements of the Workforce Investment Act in selecting an eligible entity to receive a State service area grant under section 167. Such an entity must have already demonstrated a capacity to administer effectively a diversified program of workforce training and related assistance for eligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers. National Programs.--This activity includes WIA-authorized programs in support of the workforce system including technical assistance and incentive grants, evaluations, pilots, demonstrations and research, and the Women in Apprenticeship Program. Technical Assistance.--The Committee recommends $1,604,000 for the provision of technical assistance, a decrease of $376,000 from the program year 2006 level. Neither the budget request nor House allowance recommend funding for this activity. This includes $1,000,000 for technical assistance to employers and unions to assist them in training, placing, and retraining women in nontraditional jobs and occupations, as authorized under the Women in Apprenticeship and Non- Traditional Occupations Act of 1992, Public Law 102-530; this amount is specified in bill language, to prevent its being diverted to other purposes. As described in the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker section of this report, the recommendation also includes $604,000 for WIA Section 167 activities. Pilots, Demonstrations, and Research.--The Committee recommends $44,815,000, an increase of $27,115,000 over the budget request, and $1,454,000 over the House allowance for grants or contracts to conduct research, pilots or demonstrations that improve techniques or demonstrate the effectiveness of programs. In addition, the Committee recommends $6,875,000 to continue activities of the Denali Commission, for job training in connection with infrastructure building projects it funds in rural Alaska. Funding will allow unemployed and underemployed rural Alaskans to train for high paying jobs in their villages. The Committee is deeply concerned about the ability of the 28 million Americans who are deaf or hard-of-hearing to be informed of critical news and information in the post-9/11/01 environment. The Committee is aware that court reporting schools may not be able to meet the ``unfunded mandate'' set by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to provide closed captioning of 100 percent of broadcast programming. These compelling concerns justify continued Federal support to those schools to increase their capability to attract and train more real time writers and to work closely with the broadcasting industry to significantly increase the amount of programming that is closed captioned, that 100 million Americans utilize closed captioning in some form and the shortage of providers need to be addressed immediately. The University of Hawaii Center on the Family remains committed to the development of a socially and culturally sensitive knowledge base that expands and assesses public policies that affect the wellbeing of the growing population of multi-ethnic individuals and families residing within the State. The Committee recommendation also includes language requiring that funds be provided to the following organizations in the amounts specified: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Amount ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 413 Hope Mission Ministries, Incorporated, $100,000 Philadelphia, PA, for continuing adult-vocational and technology training programs..........................

Evaluation.--The Committee recommends $4,921,000 to provide for the continuing evaluation of programs conducted under the Workforce Investment Act, as well as of federally-funded employment-related activities under other provisions of law. COMMUNITY SERVICE EMPLOYMENT FOR OLDER AMERICANS Appropriations, 2006.................................... $432,311,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 432,311,000 House allowance......................................... 420,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 432,311,000 The Committee recommends $432,311,000, the same as the budget request, the House allowance, and the program year 2006 comparable level for community service employment for older Americans. The House recommendation is $420,000,000, a reduction of $12,311,000. This program, authorized by title V of the Older Americans Act, provides part-time employment in community service activities for unemployed, low-income persons aged 55 and over. It is forward-funded from July to June, and the 2007 appropriation will support the program from July 1, 2007, through June 30, 2008. The Committee believes that within the title V community service employment program for older Americans, special attention should be paid to providing community service jobs for older Americans with poor employment prospects, including individuals with a long-term detachment from the labor force, older displaced homemakers, aged minorities, limited English-speaking persons, and legal immigrants. The program provides a direct, efficient, and quick means to assist economically disadvantaged older workers because it has a proven effective network in every State and in practically every county. Administrative costs for the program are low, and the vast majority of the money goes directly to low-income seniors as wages and fringe benefits. The program provides a wide range of vital community services that would not otherwise be available, particularly in low-income areas and in minority neighborhoods. Senior enrollees provide necessary and valuable services at Head Start centers, schools, hospitals, libraries, elderly nutrition sites, senior center, and elsewhere in the community. These services would not be available without the program. A large proportion of senior enrollees use their work experience and training to obtain employment in the private sector. This not only increases our Nation's tax base, but it also enables more low-income seniors to participate in the program. The Committee believes that the program should pay special attention to providing community service jobs for older Americans with poor employment prospects, including individuals with a long-term detachment from the labor force, older displaced homemakers, aged minorities, limited English-speaking persons, and legal immigrants. FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND ALLOWANCES Appropriations, 2006.................................... $966,400,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 938,600,000 House allowance......................................... 938,600,000 Committee recommendation................................ 938,600,000 The Committee recommends $938,600,000 the same as the budget estimate and House allowance for fiscal year 2007, and a decrease of $27,800,000 below the fiscal year 2006 appropriation for Federal Unemployment Benefits and Allowances. Trade adjustment benefit payments are expected to decline from $707,000,000 in fiscal year 2006 to $679,000,000 in fiscal year 2007, while trade training in fiscal year 2007 will increase by $200,000 to $259,400,000 with an estimated 78,000 participants. The Committee expects the Department to provide funds to the State of Alaska to mitigate negative effects on Alaskan fishermen and other Alaskan displaced workers stemming from passage of trade legislation in 2002. Funds should be provided on a flexible basis to cover costs of job training and placement programs, among other uses. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of 2002 that amended the Trade Act of 1974 was signed into law on August 6, 2002 (Public Law 107-210). This act consolidated the previous Trade Adjustment Assistance [TAA] and NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance [NAFTA-TAA] programs, into a single, enhanced TAA program with expanded eligibility, services, and benefits. Additionally, the Act provides a program of Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance for Older Workers. STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICE OPERATIONS Appropriations, 2006.................................... $3,358,157,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 3,435,717,000 House allowance......................................... 3,411,762,000 Committee recommendation................................ 3,350,876,000 The Committee recommends $3,350,876,000 for this account. Included in the total availability is $3,246,346,000 authorized to be drawn from the ``Employment Security Administration'' account of the unemployment trust fund, and $104,530,000 to be provided from the general fund of the Treasury. The funds in this account are used to provide administrative grants and assistance to State agencies which administer Federal and State unemployment compensation laws and operate the public employment service. For unemployment insurance [UI] services, the bill provides $2,546,675,000. This includes $2,536,775,000 for State Operations, and $9,900,000 for UI national activities, which is directed to activities that benefit the State/Federal unemployment insurance program. The bill provides for a contingency reserve amount should the unemployment workload exceed an average weekly insured claims volume of 2,708,000. This contingency amount would fund the administrative costs of unemployment insurance workload over the level of 2,708,000 insured unemployed per week at a rate of $28,600,000 per 100,000 insured unemployed, with a pro rata amount granted for amounts of less than 100,000 insured unemployed; the President's budget and House allowance provide for a contingency threshold level of $2,963,000. For the Employment Service allotments to States, the Committee recommends $688,769,000 which includes $22,016,000 in general funds together with an authorization to spend $666,753,000 from the ``Employment Security Administration'' account of the unemployment trust fund. This is the same as the budget request and House allowance and below the enacted level of $715,883,000 for allotments to States. These funds are available for the program year of July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008. The recommendation also includes $32,918,000 for Employment Service national activities, a decrease of $510,000 from the fiscal year 2006 level, as requested by the administration. The recommendation is $18,677,000 for the work opportunity tax credit program, $1,000,000 over the 2006 enacted level. The recommendation also includes $63,000,000 for One-Stop Career Centers, compared to the budget request of $63,855,000 and House allowance of $40,000,000 and 2006 enacted level of $81,662,000. The Committee recommendation includes funding for America's Labor Market Information System, including core employment statistics, universal access for customers, improving efficiency in labor market transactions, and measuring and displaying WIA performance information. The recommendation includes $19,514,000 for the Work Incentives Grants program, to help persons with disabilities find and retain jobs through the One-Stop Career Center system mandated by the Workforce Investment Act. Funding will support grants, including the Disability Program Navigator initiative, intended to ensure that One-Stop systems integrate and coordinate mainstream employment and training programs with essential employment-related services for persons with disabilities. The budget request and House allowance provide no funding for this program. ADVANCES TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT TRUST FUND AND OTHER FUNDS Appropriations, 2006.................................... $465,000,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 452,000,000 House allowance......................................... 452,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 452,000,000 The Committee recommends $452,000,000, the same as the budget estimate and House allowance for fiscal year 2007, and $13,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2006 level. The appropriation is available to provide advances to several accounts for purposes authorized under various Federal and State unemployment compensation laws and the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, whenever balances in such accounts prove insufficient. The bill anticipates that fiscal year 2006 advances will be made to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The separate appropriations provided by the Committee for all other accounts eligible to borrow from this account in fiscal year 2007 are expected to be sufficient. Should the need arise, due to unanticipated changes in the economic situation, laws, or for other legitimate reasons, advances will be made to the appropriate accounts to the extent funds are available. Funds advanced to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund are now repayable with interest to the general fund of the Treasury. PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION Appropriations, 2006.................................... $169,423,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 211,554,000 House allowance......................................... 211,554,000 Committee recommendation................................ 184,976,000 The Committee recommendation includes $90,182,000 in general funds for this account, as well as authority to expend $94,794,000 from the ``Employment Security Administration'' account of the unemployment trust fund, for a total of $184,976,000. This level provides sufficient resources to cover built-in cost increases. It also provides a $2,000,000 increase over the request to accelerate the processing of backlogged foreign labor certificate cases. The Committee expects a progress report by August 31, 2006, detailing the status of efforts to eliminate the backlog of pending foreign labor certification applications. The Committee recommendation reflects shifting $28,578,000 in Job Corps staffing costs to a separate appropriations account. General funds in this account provide the Federal staff to administer employment and training programs under the Workforce Investment Act, the Older Americans Act, the Trade Act of 1974, the Denali Commission Act, the Women in Apprenticeship and Non- Traditional Occupations Act of 1992, and the National Apprenticeship Act. Trust funds provide for the Federal administration of employment security functions under title III of the Social Security Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. Federal staff costs related to the Wagner- Peyser Act in this account are split 97 percent to 3 percent between unemployment trust funds and general revenue, respectively. The Committee believes that the public workforce system is strengthened by the effective participation of all of the stakeholders in the system and urges that the Department use a portion of its discretionary funds to support that participation through grants and contracts to intergovernmental, business, labor, and community-based organizations dedicated to training and technical assistance in support of Workforce Investment Boards and their members. The Committee is concerned that there are limited opportunities for Native Hawaiian administrators in health care organizations and encourages effective training programs to prepare Native Hawaiians with the expertise to excel in these areas. The Committee instructs that, for the purposes of the temporary visa programs, the Department of Labor shall treat loggers as agricultural workers and not as non-agricultural workers. Presently, the Department classifies loggers as non- agricultural; however, since June 1987, it has imposed upon them the same worker protections and labor standards as H-2A agricultural workers. Employers wishing to hire logger aliens must already provide transportation, housing, and meals, and must make the same benefits available to U.S. workers based on Department policy that predates the 1986 immigration reforms. The provision applies strictly to loggers, and shall not affect any other H-2B workers. Employee Benefits Security Administration SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2006.................................... $133,550,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 143,573,000 House allowance......................................... 143,573,000 Committee recommendation................................ 143,573,000 The Committee recommendation provides $143,573,000 for this account which is $10,023,000 above the 2006 comparable level. This provides sufficient resources to cover built-in cost increases, as well as the requested program increase to develop an new E-FAST filing and acceptance system to better protect employee pension and health benefits. The Employee Benefits Security Administration [EBSA] is responsible for the enforcement of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [ERISA] in both civil and criminal areas. ESBA is also responsible for enforcement of sections 8477 and 8478 of the Federal Employees' Retirement Security Act of 1986 [FERSA]. In accordance with the requirements of FERSA, the Secretary of Labor has promulgated regulations and prohibited transactions class exemptions under the fiduciary responsibility and fiduciary bonding provisions of the law governing the Thrift Savings Plan for Federal employees. In addition, the Secretary of Labor has, pursuant to the requirement of section 8477(g)(1) of FERSA, established a program to carry out audits to determine the level of compliance with the fiduciary responsibility provisions of FERSA applicable to Thrift Savings Plan fiduciaries. ESBA provides funding for the enforcement and compliance; policy, regulation, and public services; and program oversight activities. PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION The Corporation's estimated obligations for fiscal year 2007 include single employer benefit payments of $5,334,000,000, multiemployer financial assistance of $93,000,000 and administrative expenses of $397,644,000. Administrative expenses are comprised of three activities: (1) Pension insurance activities, $78,614,000; (2) operational support, $125,580,000; and (3) pension plan termination expenses, $193,450,000. Such expenditures will be financed by permanent authority. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is a wholly owned Government corporation established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The law places it within the Department of Labor and makes the Secretary of Labor the chair of its board of directors. The corporation receives its income primarily from insurance premiums collected from covered pension plans, assets of terminated pension plans, collection of employer liabilities imposed by the act, and investment earnings. It is also authorized to borrow up to $100,000,000 from the Treasury. The primary purpose of the corporation is to guarantee the payment of pension plan benefits to participants if covered defined benefit plans fail or go out of existence. The 2006 budget does not recommend a discretionary limit on administrative expenditures [LAE] for PBGC. The PBGC's budget reflects--in a way that is more accountable to the Committee-- the level of administrative expenditures that the Committee believes is appropriate to PBGC's changing responsibilities to protect the pensions it insures. PBGC's dollar benefit levels and workload change from year to year as specific pension plans fail. Most of its workload involves terminating failed pension plans, so that pension benefits can be paid. The workload of plan termination especially fluctuates from year to year as large plans (or a spate of small ones) terminate, and then as the terminations are completed. The language provides the PBGC the flexibility to respond when dictated by increased workload and increased benefit payments, while increasing accountability to the Committee by requiring approval by the Office of Management and Budget and the Committees on Appropriations. The single-employer program protects about 34.6 million participants in about 29,600 defined benefit pension plans. The multi-employer insurance program protects about 9.8 million participants in more than 1,600 plans. Employment Standards Administration SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2006.................................... $411,064,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 437,417,000 House allowance......................................... 418,495,000 Committee recommendation................................ 435,371,000 The Committee recommendation includes $435,371,000 for this account. The bill contains authority to expend $2,076,000 from the special fund established by the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act; the remainder of $433,295,000 are general funds. In addition, an amount of $33,578,000 is available by transfer from the black lung disability trust fund. This recommendation provides sufficient funding to offset the impact of inflation, and includes resources for the requested Enforcement of Wage and Hour Standards program increase. The $17,526,000 request for Program Direction has been reduced to $17,000,000; an addition of $2,000,000 is described in the following paragraph. The recommendation includes $2,000,000 to continue activities for the expeditious startup of a system to resolve claims of victims for bodily injury caused by asbestos exposure. This may include contracts with individuals or entities having relevant experience to assist in jump starting the program, as described in S. 852, the Fair Act of 2005. Activities to shorten the lead-time for implementation of asbestos activities encompass procedures for the processing of claims, including procedures for the expediting of exigent health claims, and planning for promulgation of regulations. Executive Order 11246 requires that employers doing business with the Federal Government comply with Federal laws and regulations requiring nondiscrimination and affirmative action. To facilitate enforcement of this mandate, the Department of Labor adopted a regulation in 2000 to require the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs [OFCCP] to distribute an Equal Opportunity Survey to all Federal contractors to obtain compliance data on employment and compensation practices. The regulation specified that the data should be used, in part, to inform OFCCP's selection of contractors for compliance reviews. The Committee is aware that in the 6 years since the regulation's adoption, OFCCP has only distributed the survey one time and to a small percentage of contractors. In addition, the Committee understands that the collected data was not analyzed nor was it used for compliance reviews, as required by the regulations of 2000. Therefore, the Committee has included $1,000,000 for the distribution, analysis and compliance utilization of the Equal Opportunity Survey. The Employment Standards Administration is involved in the administration of numerous laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Protection Act, the Davis- Bacon Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Federal Employees' Compensation Act [FECA], the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, and the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act (black lung). SPECIAL BENEFITS Appropriations, 2006.................................... $237,000,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 230,000,000 House allowance......................................... 230,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 230,000,000 The Committee recommends $230,000,000, the same as the House allowance and budget estimate for fiscal year 2007, and $7,000,000 less than fiscal year 2006. This appropriation primarily provides benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act [FECA]. The payments are prescribed by law. In fiscal year 2007, an estimated 152,000 injured Federal workers or their survivors will file claims; 52,000 will receive long- term wage replacement benefits for job-related injuries, diseases, or deaths. The Committee recommends continuation of appropriation language to provide authority to require disclosure of Social Security account numbers by individuals filing claims under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act or the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act and its extensions. The Committee recommends continuation of appropriation language that provides authority to use the FECA fund to reimburse a new employer for a portion of the salary of a newly reemployed injured Federal worker. The FECA funds will be used to reimburse new employers during the first 3 years of employment not to exceed 75 percent of salary in the worker's first year, declining thereafter. The Committee again includes appropriation language that retains the drawdown date of August 15. The drawdown authority enables the agency to meet any immediate shortage of funds without requesting supplemental appropriations. The August 15 drawdown date allows flexibility for continuation of benefit payments without interruption. The Committee recommends continuation of appropriation language to provide authority to deposit into the special benefits account of the employees' compensation fund those funds that the Postal Service, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and other entities are required to pay to cover their fair share of the costs of administering the claims filed by their employees under FECA. The Committee concurs with requested bill language to allow use of fair share collections to fund capital investment projects and specific initiatives to strengthen compensation fund control and oversight. SPECIAL BENEFITS FOR DISABLED COAL MINERS Appropriations, 2006.................................... $232,250,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 229,373,000 House allowance......................................... 229,373,000 Committee recommendation................................ 229,373,000 The Black Lung Consolidation of Administrative Responsibility Act was enacted on November 2, 2002. The act amends the Black Lung Benefits Act to transfer part B black lung benefits responsibility from the Commissioner of Social Security to the Secretary of Labor, thus consolidating all black lung benefit responsibility under the Secretary. Part B benefits are based on claims filed on or before December 31, 1973. The Secretary of Labor already responsible for the part C claims filed after December 31, 1973. In fiscal year 2007, an estimated 36,500 beneficiaries (4,000 miners and 32,500 survivors) will receive benefits. The Committee recommends an appropriation of $229,373,000 in fiscal year 2007 for special benefits for disabled coal miners. This is in addition to the $74,000,000 appropriated last year as an advance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. The recommendation is the same as the administration request and House allowance. These funds are used to provide monthly benefits to coal miners disabled by black lung disease and to their widows and certain other dependents, as well as to pay related administrative costs. By law, increases in black lung benefit payments are tied directly to Federal pay increases. The year-to-year decrease in this account reflects a declining beneficiary population. The Committee recommends an advance appropriation of $68,000,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, the same as the administration request. These funds will ensure uninterrupted benefit payments to coal miners, their widows, and dependents. ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS COMPENSATION PROGRAM Appropriations, 2006.................................... $96,081,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 102,307,000 House allowance......................................... 102,307,000 Committee recommendation................................ 102,307,000 The Committee recommends $102,307,000, the same as the budget estimate for fiscal year 2007, and $6,226,000 more than 2006. The mission of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program is to deliver benefits to eligible employees and former employees of the Department of Energy, its contractors and subcontractors or to certain survivors of such individuals, as provided in the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act. The mission also includes delivering benefits to certain beneficiaries of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. The Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs within the Employment Standards Administration is responsible for adjudicating and administering claims filed by employees or former employees (or their survivors) under the act. The program went into effect on July 31, 2001. In 2007, the volume of incoming claims under Part B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program is estimated to remain stable at about 7,500 claims from Department of Energy [DOE] employees or survivors, and private companies under contract with DOE, who suffer from a radiation- related cancer, beryllium-related disease, or chronic silicosis as a result of their work in producing or testing nuclear weapons. The Committee expects that the administration refrain from unilateral changes to reduce the cost of benefits for current or pending cohorts of atomic weapons workers with cancer under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program until such time as Congress approves proposed changes. The Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health was created by Congress to review applications based on scientific and medical evidence, with as much independence and objectivity as possible. To ensure that the Advisory Board can retain its autonomy, the Committee has retained language from the fiscal year 2006 enacted appropriations legislation which transfers $4,500,000 in administrative funds within 30 days of enactment to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for the exclusive use of the Board and its audit contractor. BLACK LUNG DISABILITY TRUST FUND Appropriations, 2006.................................... $1,068,000,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 1,071,000,000 House allowance......................................... 1,071,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 1,071,000,000 The Committee recommends $1,071,000,000 for this account in 2007, an increase of $3,000,000 above the fiscal year 2006 level, and the same as the budget request and House allowance. The appropriation language changed beginning in fiscal year 2003 for the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund to provide such sums as may be necessary to pay for benefits. This change eliminated the need for drawdowns from the subsequent year appropriation in order to meet current year compensation, interest, and other benefit payments. The total amount available for fiscal year 2007 will provide $294,465,000 for benefits payments, and $59,535,000 for administrative expenses for the Department of Labor. Also, included is $717,000,000 for interest payments on advances. The trust fund pays all black lung compensation/medical and survivor benefit expenses when no responsible mine operation can be assigned liability for such benefits, or when coal mine employment ceased prior to 1970, as well as all administrative costs which are incurred in administering the benefits program and operating the trust fund. It is estimated that people will be receiving black lung benefits financed through the end of the fiscal year 2007, compared to an estimated receiving benefits in fiscal year 2006. The basic financing for the trust fund comes from a coal excise tax for underground and surface-mined coal. Additional funds come from reimbursement from the Advances to the Unemployment Trust Fund and Other Funds as well as payments from mine operators for benefit payments made by the trust fund before the mine operator is found liable. The advances to the fund assure availability of necessary funds when liabilities may exceed other income. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 continues the current tax structure until 2014. Occupational Safety and Health Administration SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2006.................................... $472,427,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 483,667,000 House allowance......................................... 486,051,000 Committee recommendation................................ 491,167,000 The Committee recommendation includes $491,167,000 for this account. This is an increase of $5,116,000 over the House allowance and $7,500,000 over the budget request. This agency is responsible for enforcing the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 in the Nation's workplaces. This recommendation provides sufficient funding to offset the impact of inflation, as well as additional resources to fund the development and implementation of the OSHA Information System. In addition, the Committee has included language to allow OSHA to retain up to $750,000 per fiscal year of training institute course tuition fees to be utilized for occupational safety and health training and education grants in the private sector. The Committee retains language carried in last year's bill effectively exempting farms employing 10 or fewer people from the provisions of the act except those farms having a temporary labor camp. The Committee also retains language exempting small firms in industry classifications having a lost workday injury rate less than the national average from general schedule safety inspections. These provisions have been in the bill for many years. The Committee believes that OSHA's worker safety and health training and education programs, including the grant program that supports such training, are a critical part of a comprehensive approach to worker protection. The Committee is concerned that OSHA has again cut funding to help establish ongoing worker safety and health training programs and has therefore restored the Susan Harwood training grant program to $10,116,000. Bill language specifies that no less than $3,200,000 shall be used to maintain the existing institutional competency building training grants, provided that grantees demonstrate satisfactory performance. The Committee is dissatisfied with the lack of progress on OSHA's regulation concerning Employer Payment for Personal Protective Equipment, the public comment period for which ended over 7 years ago. This is particularly important for Hispanic workers and immigrant workers who experience a disproportionate and growing number of injuries and fatalities. The Committee expects the Secretary to report to the Committee within 30 days of enactment of this act, the definitive status of this regulation, the agency's reasons for not issuing the regulation sooner, and a timetable for its issuance. The Committee has provided $53,357,000, the current level, for the State consultation grant program and expects that this program will continue to be targeted to provide compliance assistance to small businesses. The Committee continues to be pleased with OSHA's efforts in placing high priority on the voluntary protection programs [VPP] and other voluntary cooperative programs. The Committee expects OSHA to continue to place high priority on the VPP. Cooperative voluntary programs, especially the VPP, are an important part of OSHA's ability to assure worker safety and health and should be administered in conjunction with an effective strong enforcement program. The Committee also intends that the Office of Regulatory Analysis continue to be funded as close as possible to its present level. Mine Safety and Health Administration SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2006 \\1\\................................ $277,686,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 287,836,000 House allowance......................................... 278,869,000 Committee recommendation................................ 302,436,000 \\1\\ Excludes $25,600,000 in emergency supplemental appropriations pursuant to Public Law 109-234. The Committee recommendation includes $302,436,000 for this account, an increase of $14,600,000 over the budget request level, and $23,567,000 more than the House allowance. This recommendation provides sufficient funding to offset the impact of inflation, as well as additional resources for coal mine enforcement. It deletes one-time funding of projects contained in the 2006 enacted level, but includes funding for new projects. The Committee continues to be concerned by the over 40 percent increase in fatalities experienced in coal mines in the first 6 months of 2006. In the past 5 years, from fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2006, the coal enforcement division of MSHA reduced staff by 217 FTE. It was for that reason that the Committee included an additional $25,600,000 in Public Law 109- 234 to recruit, hire, train and equip coal mine inspectors and restore the office to its fiscal year 2001 staffing level. Within the funds provided for mine safety, the Committee recommends $133,395,000 for coal enforcement activities. This level is $13,000,000 above the budget request, $16,243,000 above the fiscal year 2006 regular appropriation before supplemental funds, and it is $9,357,000 below the total fiscal year 2006 appropriations level including supplemental funds. Supplemental funds remain available in 2007 and should continue to be used to support additional coal mine inspectors. The Committee expects that hiring and training should be done expeditiously in fiscal year 2006 and completed early in fiscal year 2007 and that the 2008 budget put forth by MSHA should include sufficient funds to maintain the 2001 level of staffing. The Committee expects that progress reports on hiring will continue to be submitted to the Committee on Appropriations on a quarterly basis with additional information on the progress of the additional inspectors through the Academy and their distribution among the district offices. The Committee recommendation also includes bill language providing up to $2,000,000 for mine rescue and recovery activities, the same as the fiscal year 2006 comparable level. It also retains the provision allowing the Secretary of Labor to use any funds available to the Department to provide for the costs of mine rescue and survival operations in the event of a major disaster. The Committee concurs with House report language directing MSHA to increase emphasis to ensure that all mining machinery sold by manufacturers and re-builders for use in a mine is in compliance with the MSHA approval plate that is on the machine. This agency insures the safety and health of the Nation's miners by conducting inspections and special investigations of mine operations, promulgating mandatory safety and health standards, cooperating with the States in developing effective State programs, and improving training in conjunction with States and the mining industry. In addition, bill language is included to allow the National Mine Health and Safety Academy to collect not to exceed $750,000 for room, board, tuition, and the sale of training materials to be available for mine safety and health education and training activities. Bill language also allows MSHA to retain up to $1,000,000 from fees collected for the approval and certification of equipment, materials, and explosives for use in mines, and may utilize such sums for such activities. The Committee recommendation also contains $1,600,000 specified in bill language for two projects not included in the budget request or House allowance. Bureau of Labor Statistics SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2006.................................... $537,099,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 563,288,000 House allowance......................................... 565,288,000 Committee recommendation................................ 563,288,000 The Committee recommends the budget request of $563,288,000 for this account, $26,189,000 more than the 2006 comparable level. This includes $79,026,000 from the ``Employment Security Administration'' account of the unemployment trust fund, and $484,262,000 in Federal funds. This funding level will cover the agency's built-in increases, and includes $5,000,000 which may be used to continue the Mass Layoff Statistics Program. Language contained in the fiscal year 2006 bill is retained, pertaining to the Current Employment Survey. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is the principal fact finding agency in the Federal Government in the broad field of labor economics. Office of Disability Employment Policy Appropriations, 2006.................................... $27,655,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 20,319,000 House allowance......................................... 20,319,000 Committee recommendation................................ 27,655,000 The Committee recommends $27,655,000 for this account in 2007. This is $7,336,000 more than the President's request and the same as 2006. The Committee intends that at least 80 percent of these funds shall be used for demonstration and technical assistance grants to develop innovative and effective practices to increase the employment of youth and adults with disabilities. Congress created the Office of Disability Employment Policy [ODEP] in the Department of Labor's fiscal year 2001 appropriation. Programs and staff of the former President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities [PCEPD] have been integrated into this office. The Committee recommends that the Office of Disability Employment Policy continue and expand the existing, structured, internship program for undergraduate college students with disabilities, at no less than current appropriation levels. The Committee continues to believe that this innovative, structured internship program will provide important opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students with disabilities to pursue academic and career development opportunities within the Department of Labor and other Federal agencies. The Committee has included $5,000,000 to continue the self- employment initiative, of which $3,000,000 is to be used to continue the national technical assistance grant. The Committee recognizes that self-employment is not an option for all persons with disabilities but believes that it can be a beneficial way to promote independence and develop assets within the disability community. The special needs of this population require more support and technical assistance in business development, as well as benefits counseling. Therefore, the Committee intends that the national technical assistance grant be used to provide expertise and help to local service providers including vocational rehabilitation agencies, one-stop training centers, and other organizations trying to promote self-employment. The Committee is concerned by the elimination of the Youth State Alignment Grants. This program helps youth with disabilities transition from school to work by aligning the efforts of school districts, workforce investment programs, juvenile justice programs and other not-for-profit service providers. The Committee encourages ODEP to continue this important effort. The Committee is concerned by the lack of attention to the problem of underemployment of people with disabilities. The Committee is aware that over 50 million Americans have some kind of disability, representing 17 percent of our population. Many of these individuals, particularly those with intellectual disabilities, would benefit from the social interaction and the physical demands of full-time employment, but their disability is such that they could not be employed in an occupation that is compensated highly enough to cover the medical expenses and supportive services they need to survive. While some disabilities resulting from injuries can change with time, many developmental disabilities are permanent in nature. The Committee believes that the U.S. Government would benefit from the additional tax dollars generated by the additional employment, as well as the prevention of chronic illnesses in this population that can come from the physical and emotional benefits of work. Therefore, the Committee directs the Office of Disability Employment Policy to undertake a study on underemployment for individuals with disabilities. The study should include: the number of individuals on Federal disability benefit programs who are currently underemployed; an analysis of the types of disabilities these individuals represent; an examination of the categories of disability which would leave the individual with the capacity to work full time but without the earning potential to sustain him or herself; the estimated economic impact of full-time work for these Americans assuming they were allowed to keep all or a portion of their benefits, including an estimation of the economic impact to the Government and the benefit funds themselves; and finally an analysis of the health impact of full-time work on those populations including the cost savings to health benefit programs. Departmental Management SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriations, 2006.................................... $297,580,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 242,091,000 House allowance......................................... 236,784,000 Committee recommendation................................ 293,405,000 The Committee recommendation includes $293,405,000 for this account, which is $51,314,000 more than the budget request and $4,175,000 less than the 2006 comparable level. In addition, an amount of $25,255,000 is available by transfer from the black lung disability trust fund, which is the same as the budget request and the House allowance. The primary goal of the Department of Labor is to protect and promote the interests of American workers. The departmental management appropriation finances staff responsible for formulating and overseeing the implementation of departmental policy and management activities in support of that goal. In addition, this appropriation includes a variety of operating programs and activities that are not involved in departmental management functions, but for which other salaries and expenses appropriations are not suitable. The Committee recommendation includes $25,534,000 for Executive Direction, the same as the fiscal year 2006 comparable level. Within this amount the fiscal year 2006 comparable level of $4,651,000 is for the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs. The Committee concurs with the budget request of $6,735,000 for Civil Rights activities, an increase of $349,000 over the House allowance. The Committee recommendation includes $10,000,000 for the Women's Bureau, an increase of $334,000 over the 2006 level. The Committee is pleased with the effectiveness of Women Work! in advancing women in the workplace. The organization's work is strategically aligned with the goals of the Women's Bureau, and has continued each year to exceed its performance measures. The Committee strongly supports continued funding for this important program and believes that Women Work!'s outstanding performance merits increased support from the Women's Bureau. The Committee is disappointed that the Department of Labor has once again put forward a budget for the coming year that drastically reduces funding for International Labor Affairs Bureau [ILAB], in particular, those initiatives working with the International Labor Organization [ILO] to combat abusive and exploitative child labor. The Committee is pleased by findings contained in the ILO report entitled ``The End of Child Labor: Within Reach,'' which was released in May 2006. The report stated that child labor is in decline worldwide, in large part because of the programs advanced by this Committee. Between 2000 and 2004, the number of child laborers worldwide fell by 11 percent, from 246 million to 218 million. Moreover, the number of children and youth aged 5-17 trapped in hazardous work decreased by 26 percent, and for the age group of 5-14 years, the decline in hazardous work was even steeper, at 33 percent. It is a testament to the importance of the programs administered by the International Labor Affairs Bureau, which this Committee has consistently supported. Clearly, these programs are having a positive impact and the Committee feels strongly that reducing United States efforts to eradicate child labor or substantially changing the structure and leadership of those efforts would, at best, endanger the progress being made. At worse, withdrawing from these efforts could damage the credibility and reputation of the United States in the countries whose governments are real partners to the United States in this effort. The Committee is aware that the administration is aggressively pursing multiple trade agreements that promise technical assistance on labor standards, including but not limited to the eradication of child labor. ILAB is the division of the U.S. Government with the mission and authority to provide that assistance. Given the aggressive trade agenda and the recent commitment to capacity building in developing nations as a form of aid, the Committee is mystified by the Department's now annual effort to eliminate these programs, this year proposing an astounding 86 percent reduction. Therefore, the Committee recommendation includes $72,516,000 for the Bureau of International Labor Affairs. Of this amount, the Committee's recommendation includes $37,620,000 for the U.S. contribution to sustain the successful efforts of the ILO's International Program for the Elimination of Child Labor [IPEC]. Also included is $22,770,000 to help ensure access to basic education for the growing number of children removed from the worst forms of child labor in impoverished nations where abusive and exploitative child labor is most acute. The Committee expects the Department of Labor to work with the governments of host countries to eliminate school fees that create a barrier to education. The Committee notes that ILAB is statutorily required to compile and report to the Congress annually on the extent to which each foreign country that has trade and investment agreements with the United States enforces internationally- recognized worker rights. This report is required under multiple U.S. laws and promotes core labor standards as embodied in the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work as adopted and reaffirmed in 1998. The Committee once again directs the Secretary to include in the 2007 report, all former GSP recipients that have achieved a Free Trade Agreement with the United States over the preceding year. For the administration of ILAB programs, including FTE for Federal Administration, the Committee recommends $12,126,000. The Committee is dismayed that costs from salaries and expenses have been supplemented from out of the grant programs themselves. The Committee notes with displeasure that at times the amount deducted from grant programs has exceeded 14 percent. The Committee directs that in fiscal year 2007, no more than 7 percent may be deducted from grant programs for the administration of the grants. The Committee expects the 2008 budget submission to eliminate the need for any transfer by including sufficient funds to maintain the staff of ILAB. The Committee has included sufficient funds in the program administration line to fully maintain the 49 FTE currently assigned to the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary, the Office of Trade Agreement Implementation, the Office of International Economic Affairs and the International Child Labor Program. The Committee concurs with the budget request and House allowance of $85,188,000 for the Office of the Solicitor, an increase of $4,737,000 over the enacted fiscal year 2006 appropriation level. The Committee notes that the Office of the Solicitor has augmented its fiscal year 2006 appropriation by $4,055,000, requiring Department of Labor agencies to pay for certain functions that previously had been performed without cost to client agencies. The Committee expects that this practice not be continued in fiscal year 2007 and future years. If additional resources are needed for the Solicitor's Office, the regular transfer authority or reprogramming procedures should be used, or the administration should submit a budget amendment or supplemental appropriations request. For future years, the President's Budget submission to Congress should adequately address the request for all functions of the Office of the Solicitor. The Committee is concerned by communication difficulties with the Department of Labor. The Committee is responsible for providing adequate resources to fulfill the mission of the agency and overseeing the expenditure of those resources. When emergencies arise, such as coal mine disasters or the hurricanes the Committee must act quickly to ensure that resources are available and appropriately distributed. Conversely, many initiatives funded by the Committee span multiple years, multiple appropriations bills. The Committee must have a senior official available to respond in a timely manner, and possesses the needed institutional knowledge to address immediate or long term initiatives. The Office of Congressional and Inter-Governmental Affairs consistently experiences high turnover and has little experience in or knowledge of the detailed budget process and execution procedures that are most often the information needed by the Committee. Within 15 days of the adoption of this Senate Committee report, the Committee directs the Secretary to designate an individual from the Budget office to be responsible for responding to Committee staff. The individual should be experienced in budget formulation and execution. OFFICE OF JOB CORPS Appropriations, 2006 \\1\\................................ $1,592,758,000 Budget estimate, 2007................................... 1,501,602,000 House allowance......................................... 1,523,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 1,629,788,000 \\1\\ Excludes $16,000,000 in emergency supplemental appropriations pursuant to Public Law 109-234. For Job Corps, the Committee recommends $1,629,788,000, $37,030,000 more than the 2006 comparable level. This includes $28,578,000 for Federal administrative expenses, for 188 full- time equivalent positions; the budget request and House allowance include these administrative costs in the ETA Program Administration account. The Senate recommendation for direct program cost is $1,601,210,000, compared to the $1,501,602,000 budget request and $1,523,000,000 House Allowance. The Committee concurs with the House in not agreeing to the proposed $75,000,000 rescission of funds previously appropriated for construction and renovation activities. The Committee recommendation continues the Office of Job Corps as an independent entity reporting to the Office of the Secretary of Labor, retaining program functions previously administered by the Job Corps prior to its transfer from the Employment and Training Administration, and ensuring the support necessary for oversight and management responsibilities. Although the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management will oversee the procurement process, this arrangement shall not alter the existing authorities, duties or activities of Job Corps as it existed prior to the transfer. The Office of Job Corps and the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management are directed to maintain controls to assure the procurement activities are completely separate from program operations. The budget request and House allowance recommend returning the Job Corps program to the Employment and Training Administration. The Committee applauds Job Corps for establishing partnerships with national employers, and encourages Job Corps to continue to work with both large employers and small businesses to ensure that student training meets current labor market needs. Job Corps is a nationwide network of residential facilities chartered by Federal law to provide a comprehensive and intensive array of training, job placement and support services to at-risk young adults. The mission of Job Corps is to attract eligible young adults, teach them the skills they need to become employable and independent, and place them in meaningful jobs or further education. Participation in the program is voluntary and is open to economically disadvantaged young people in the 16-24 age range who are unemployed and out of school. Most Job Corps students come from disruptive or debilitating environments, and it is important that they be relocated to residential facilities where they can benefit from the highly structured and carefully integrated services provided by the Job Corps program. A limited number of opportunities are also available for non-residential participation. As a national training program, Job Corps is particularly well-suited to help meet the needs of large, multi-state employers for skilled entry-level workers. The Committee commends Job Corps for establishing partnerships with national employers, and encourages Job Corps to continue to work with larger employers and small businesses to ensure that student training meets current labor market needs. The Committee urges Job Corps to also strengthen and expand the program in order to help meet our nation's needs for trained, entry level workers in three critical areas: health care, homeland security and national defense. In addition, Job Corps should intensify its efforts to upgrade its vocational offerings and curricula to reflect industry standards and required certifications recognized by employers. The Committee commends the Job Corps program for establishing cost-effectiv"
