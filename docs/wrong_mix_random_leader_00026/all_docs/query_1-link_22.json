        "text": "The bodies of three men have now been removed from the site of a collapsed six-story apartment building, the police chief in Davenport, Iowa, announced Monday.\n\n\"We don’t have any other information at this time that there are any additional people missing,” Chief Jeff Bladel said.\n\nBranden Colvin Sr.’s body was recovered Saturday. The body of Ryan Hitchcock was recovered Sunday and Daniel Prien early Monday. The discoveries came after authorities announced that the search for survivors had been completed, with attention turning to shoring up the remaining structure so recovery efforts could begin.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds toured the site Monday morning, and tweeted later that the state is providing support and resources while working with city officials. “Thank you to the first responders for putting their lives at risk to help their community,” she wrote.\n\nMore: Why was the fine against Andrew Wold, owner of collapsed Davenport building, set at $300?\n\nMeanwhile, residents of the building have started filing lawsuits. One, filed Monday by Dayna Feuerbach, is accusing the city and the building's current and former owners of knowing of the deteriorating conditions and failing to warn residents of the risk. A second action by Mildred Harrington against the building's owner alone alleges the same.\n\nFeuerbach's lawsuit alleges multiple counts of negligence, and both actions seek unspecified damages.\n\n“The city had warning after warning,” attorney Jeffrey Goodman, who represents Feuerbach, told The Associated Press. He called it a common trend in major structural collapses he’s seen. “They had the responsibility to make sure that the safety of the citizens comes first. It is very clear that the city of Davenport didn’t do that.”\n\nCity documents, released last week and cited in the lawsuits, suggest concerns about the integrity of parts of the building that were conveyed to the city and owner, Andrew Wold, over the course of months.\n\nA recording of a 911 call placed just the day before the partial collapse reveals the director of a local organization affiliated with the chamber of commerce reported a contractor's concerns about a wall's integrity. City fire officials responded by visiting the site for less than 5 minutes, according to the dispatch log.\n\nUnstable building made search for missing men extremely dangerous\n\nCity officials had said earlier that Colvin, 42, Hitchcock, 51, and Prien, 60, had “high probability of being home at the time of the collapse.\" Searching for them has proven to be extremely dangerous. The remains of the six-story apartment building were constantly in motion in the first 24 to 36 hours after it collapsed on May 28, putting rescuers at great risk.\n\n“We are doing the best we can to balance the building conditions and the safety of our responders,” Fire Chief Mike Carlsten told reporters. He said conditions have forced a response that may take “days and weeks” instead of what ideally would have been minutes or hours.\n\nMore: Iowa woman freed from Davenport building collapse after amputation\n\nMayor Mike Matson earlier had said the debris pile “could be a place of rest for some of the unaccounted.”\n\nMatson said Monday that neither he nor other city officials have been in touch with Wold.\n\nWold released a statement dated May 30 saying “our thoughts and prayers are with our tenants.” He has made no statement since then, and efforts to reach him, his company and a man believed to be his attorney have been unsuccessful.\n\nCounty records show Davenport Hotel L.L.C. acquired the building in a 2021 deal worth $4.2 million.\n\nFire marshal, Iowa DCI have begun investigation\n\nBladel, the police chief, said the Davenport fire marshal’s office had begun an investigation of the building collapse with help from the state Division of Criminal Investigation, Davenport police and the medical examiner’s office.\n\nThe building, built as a hotel in 1907, had been converted into about 80 apartment units that were home to roughly 50 people.\n\nThe state earlier made $5,000 available to displaced tenants who met income requirements, and the city offered $6,000 to the people forced from their homes. On Monday, the governor also waived fees for tenants who need to get their driver’s license replaced.\n\nOn Friday, Scott County prosecutor Kelly Cunningham cautioned against assuming a criminal prosecution is appropriate, saying an independent investigation needs to be conducted into the cause of the building’s structural failure, and right now it’s in the city’s jurisdiction.\n\nMore: Why was the fine against Andrew Wold, owner of collapsed Davenport building, set at $300?\n\nUnresolved questions include why neither the owner nor city officials warned residents about potential danger. A structural engineer’s report issued days before the collapse indicated a wall of the century-old building was at imminent risk of crumbling.\n\nDocuments released by the city show that city officials and the building’s owner had been warned for months that parts of the building were unstable.\n\nLawsuit alleges defendants failed to warn residents 'their lives were in danger'\n\nThe lawsuit filed Monday also names two companies hired by Wold to assess and perform work on the building. The suit alleges all parties “recognized the imminent danger residents faced, yet allowed the building to deteriorate while failing to warn residents that their lives were in danger.”\n\nOne of the companies was a Bettendorf-based engineering firm, whose engineer David Valliere filed reports on the condition of the building as recently as May 24, because the companies \"have an affirmative responsibility to sound the alarm of urgency and take all steps they can to make sure this building is evacuated for safety,” Goodman said. “We see their role in this tragedy to be unfortunately central.”\n\nTenants also complained to the city in recent years about a host of problems they say were ignored by property managers, including no heat or hot water for weeks or even months at a time, as well as mold and water leakage from ceilings and toilets. While city officials tried to address some complaints and gave vacate orders to individual apartments, a broader evacuation was never ordered, records show."
