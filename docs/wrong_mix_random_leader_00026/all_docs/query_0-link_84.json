His mother, an African native, transmitted a passionate hatred of slavery to her son. He learned to read from one of his master’s sons, and he eagerly absorbed intensive religious training. In the early 1820s, he was sold to a neighboring farmer of small means. During the following decade, his religious ardor tended to approach fanaticism, and he saw himself called upon by God to lead his people out of bondage. He began to exert a powerful influence on many of the nearby slaves, who called him “the Prophet.” It has been recorded that Turner, a bondsman, led the only effective, sustained slave rebellion in August of 1831, in U.S. history. Spreading terror throughout the white South, his action set off a new wave of oppressive legislation prohibiting the education, movement, and assembly of slaves and stiffened pro-slavery, anti-abolitionist convictions that persisted in that region until the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865. Turner’s rebellion put an end to the white Southern myth that slaves were either contented with servitude or too servile to mount an armed revolt. In Southampton County, Black people came to measure time from “Nat’s Fray,” or “Old Nat’s War.” For many years in Black churches throughout the country, the name Jerusalem referred not only to the Bible but also covertly to the place where the rebel slave had met his death; Jerusalem, Virginia.

Despite arrests, imprisonment and violent retaliation, Gandhi and his followers adhered (to remain devoted and uphold) to the principle of Satyagraha. These actions led to worldwide attention. Gandhi also began to fast as a method of protest. He became known as “Mahatma,” which means “Great Soul.” In 1947, India became an independent state after 300 years of British rule, a victory for Gandhi and non-violent resistance.

The paper name changed to the New York Freeman, and Fortune worked there from 1884 to 1887. The paper was finally changed to the New York Age, for which he worked from 1887 to 1907, when he sold it.

Although exceptionally talented, Stahl who had a brother Ambrose seldom placed higher than third at the major rodeos mainly because he was Black. At one rodeo where he’d clearly bested his competitors, Stahl was awarded second place. Perhaps to mock the judges, he rode a second bronco while facing backward. A spectacular ride by black Stahl, on a previously un-ridden bucking horse called “Glass Eye” was one of the highlights of the show. Some rodeo enthusiast consider Jesse Stahl the greatest of all bronco riders; neither is surprising when one considers that approximately five thousand black cowboys rode the cattle trails in the 19th century. Jesse Stahl retired in 1929 and died in Sacramento, California in 1935. He is remembered today as a peerless roughrider. He was posthumously inducted into Oklahoma City’s Rodeo Hall of Fame in 1979, only the second black cowboy (after Bill Pickett) to receive that honor.

Mother Waddles, a St. Louis, Missouri, native who moved to Detroit in 1937, was age 40 and had ten children of her own at the time. “One day I had a vision,” she was quoted in a Lansing State Journal article, “The Lord told me to feed the hungry and clothe the naked.” Her husband, Payton Waddles, a former Ford Motor Company worker who died in 1980, supported Mother and the children while she rounded up neighbors and fellow churchgoers to start the Mission. Privately funded and staffed by volunteers, the Mission now helps approximately 90,000 annually, Mother Waddles, a Methodist minister, estimates. The list of the Mission’s services includes emergency aid, job training, a graphic arts program, and a culinary arts school. Those seeking help from the Mission include unwed mothers, prostitutes, abused children, the handicapped, the elderly, and the poor. The volunteer staff ranged from Mother Waddles’ own children to a mostly paralyzed woman who makes telephone calls from her own house to locate wheelchairs and arrange transportation for the indigent. Funding, according to a 1990 Mission budget report, ranges from Mother Waddles donation of $10,500 from her husband’s pension and Social Security, to private cash donations, corporate grants, and food. In addition to overseeing the Mission, Mother Waddles’ work included giving speeches and sermons, which were a mix of what she called “downtrodden tales,” optimism, and humor.\n\nDesmond Mpilo Tutu, born October 7, 1931, in Klerksdrop, Transvaal, South Africa, becomes an activist and retired Anglican bishop who rose to worldwide fame during the 1980s as an opponent of apartheid.

Inc., having served in numerous senior management positions at the company prior to this appointment. – Who is this man? He’s the guy at Merrill Lynch who worked his way up a long corporate ladder to become CEO. Born in 1951 in Roanoke, Alabama, this young black boy from down south was destined for greatness. Once he reached the top, O’Neal went to work with a vengeance. He sliced 14,800 jobs off the payroll, sold off businesses, closed 266 offices around the world, and engineered the biggest shakeup in the 117-year history of the company to make it more efficient and, ultimately, more profitable.

Braxton has been recognized for her distinctive dramatic contralto voice. Her voice has been called “husky, sultry, elegant and sexy.” Due to the huskiness of her voice, Braxton often used male singers such as Michael McDonald, Luther Vandross (born April 20, 1951 – July 1, 2005) and Stevie Wonder (born May 13, 1950) as vocal style models. Chaka Khan (born March 23, 1953) and Anita Baker (born January 26, 1958) were two of the few female singers that she could stylize. Steve Huey of Allmusic cites a key to Braxton’s success is the versatility of her voice, which he states as being “soulful enough for R&B audiences, but smooth enough for adult contemporary; sophisticated enough for adults, but sultry enough for younger listeners; strong enough in the face of heartbreak to appeal to women, but ravishing enough to nab the fellas.” Braxton began her career singing traditional R&B and adult contemporary ballads and love songs on her debut and sophomore albums.
