While this number may seem small overall, as a fraction of the total workforce it is high relative to the nation. These workers are often telecommuters who work in knowledge-based, white-collar professions. For example, Silicon Valley has large numbers of people who telecommute.

This equates to an annual income of $138,808 for a family of four. However, Davenport contains both very wealthy and poor people as well.\n\nDavenport is a very ethnically-diverse city. The people who call Davenport home describe themselves as belonging to a variety of racial and ethnic groups. The greatest number of Davenport residents report their race to be White, followed by Black or African-American. Important ancestries of people in Davenport include German, Irish, English, Swedish, and Italian.\n\nThe most common language spoken in Davenport is English.
