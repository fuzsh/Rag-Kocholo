        "text": "The Iowa Department of Education has just released new online reports called the Iowa School Performance Profiles. These reports include each school's scores on a set of accountability measures that are consistent throughout Iowa's 1,302 public schools. These indicators are required to be part of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). ESSA focuses on equitable access to education, high standards and accountability, and a decrease in achievement gaps across groups of students including students with disabilities, students who are economically disadvantaged, students from major ethnic and racial groups, English learners, students of military-connected families, as well as students who are a part of migrant families, homeless, or in foster care.\n\nThe Iowa School Performance Profiles include each school's scores on a set of accountability measures. These measures include:\n\nStudent participation on state assessments\n\nAcademic achievement\n\nStudent academic growth\n\nGraduation rate (high schools only)\n\nProgress in achieving English language proficiency (for English as a Second Language students)\n\nA postsecondary readiness measure will be added for high schools in 2019.\n\nProficiency is important, particularly in reading and math, however this new accountability system emphasizes student growth as measured by results on state assessments from year to year. This will show schools that are making significant progress with students.\n\nA quick overview of our school rankings shows six schools rated Commendable, 11 schools rated Acceptable, five schools rated Needs Improvement, five schools rated Priority, and two schools were Unable to Rate. You can access a quick look at DCS Rankings By School (Download Below).\n\nThe Iowa School Performance Profile adds dimension to our assessment model which can guide our efforts. Our District has taken many strong steps with the goal of Increasing Student Achievement (Download Below).over the past four years."
