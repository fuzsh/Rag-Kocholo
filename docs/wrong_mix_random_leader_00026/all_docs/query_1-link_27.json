        "text": "City officials found the body of one of three men who went missing after an apartment building partially collapsed in Davenport, Iowa, last week, an official confirmed Sunday.\n\nCity spokeswoman Sarah Ott said Branden Colvin Sr.’s body was found Saturday. Colvin, 42, is the first person found and confirmed dead after the collapse on May 28. The two other men − 51-year-old Ryan Hitchcock and 60-year-old Daniel Prien − are still unaccounted for.\n\nOn Sunday, Davenport city officials said overnight crews continued to focus on the “material pile and removing material from the scene.”\n\n“This work will continue throughout the day today with crews working 12 hour shifts around the clock,” city officials said in a post on Facebook.\n\nColvin’s son graduates from high school\n\nColvin’s son, Branden Colvin Jr. – who has been sleeping at the site – graduated from high school Saturday, the Quad-City Times reported.\n\nColvin Jr. and other family members have been at the collapse site almost constantly since the incident occurred, the publication reported.\n\nColvin’s body was found a day after city officials announced that the search for survivors had been completed. City officials will now turn to supporting the structure to begin recovery efforts.\n\nRyan Hitchcock, Daniel Prien still missing\n\nPrien’s daughter, Nancy Prien Frezza, told the AP that she had not received any updates on her father’s search.\n\nCity officials said Colvin, Hitchcock and Prien had “high probability of being home at the time of the collapse,” the AP reported.\n\nWhy did the Davenport building partially collapse?\n\nEight people were rescued after the six-story apartment building, which has 84 residential and commercial units, partially collapsed, Fire Chief Michael Carlsten said in a press conference Monday.\n\nThe cause of the collapse was not immediately known. Rich Oswald, city of Davenport director of development and neighborhood services, said work was being done at the time of the collapse on the red brick exterior of the building.\n\nReports of bricks falling from the building were part of that work, Oswald said.\n\nMore coverage from the USA TODAY Network\n\nDavenport apartment building collapse: 5 people missing, 2 believed to be inside, officials say\n\nDavenport, Iowa, apartment: 8 people rescued, no deaths reported after building collapses\n\nDavenport, Iowa: Mother recalls terrifying phone conversation as daughter's apartment building collapsed\n\nContributing: The Associated Press; William Morris, Des Moines Register Grace Hauck, USA TODAY"
