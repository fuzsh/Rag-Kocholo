        "text": "Dean Kugler is a seasoned interdisciplinary artist, painter, and figurative sculptor. His 3D work is featured primarily at Gallery Victor Armendariz in Chicago. In the last three years, Dean has also been featured at Abend Gallery in Denver, The Figge Art Museum, and Bereskin Gallery in Iowa. He has shown at SOFA Chicago in 2017, 2018, and 2019 and participated in ArtPrize in 2013, 2014, and 2015.\n\nHe sees himself primarily as a sculptor due to the challenges he finds and thrives on within the process. In all its beauty, crudeness, and subtleties, the figure offers infinite opportunities to express feelings and emotions. There is also a physicality to sculpture that requires the work to be experienced through movement in order to reveal more about the piece.\n\nDean has always been drawn to the interactive nature of large-scale sculpture that is available to the public - he loves the idea that his work entices the observer to go beyond what they can see and add tactility to the experience. By using both realism and abstraction, he creates a visual that challenges the viewer to resolve what they are seeing. Therefore, providing a greater connection between the artist and the viewer.\n\nEducation\n\n1993 – AA from Blackhawk College.\n\n1995 – BFA from Western Illinois University.\n\nTexts\n\n1995 – “Drawing: Skills, Means, Freedom”.
