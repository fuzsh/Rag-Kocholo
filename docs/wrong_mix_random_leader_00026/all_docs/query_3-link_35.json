        "text": "Independent music store, Ragged Records and Music, located at 311 E. 2nd Street in Davenport, Iowa, is one of the most popular destinations for vinyl in the Quad Cities. With one of the largest used record selections in the Midwest as well as being seated at the foot of the Arsenal Bridge, it is accessible for travelers and locals alike.\n\nNow wax fans (and CD collectors) have two locations to dig through, Ragged Records & Music opened up a spot at 311 1/2 21st Street in Rock Island, Illinois. While there will be some overlap in vinyl inventory, both stores will offer different selections as well as other music related products.\n\nThe Davenport location currently sells vintage stereo equipment, as will the Rock Island location. But the new store also sells music gear, such as vintage instruments, new accessories, and some recording gear. They will also buy and sell music and gear for money or store credit.\n\nRight around the corner from Ragged Records is Rozz-Tox, a coffee shop and live entertainment venue that has done many collaborations with Ragged Records in the past.\n\nThis opening of the second Ragged Records is a sign of great things happening in the Quad Cities music scene. There are new venues opening and collaborative efforts from those in the music community, promising continued growth in the entertainment industry as a whole. Look to Ragged Records & Music as being a leader in providing the Quad Cities with music in many different forms and fashions to enjoy.\n\nWritten by: Deborah Davis\n\nDeborah Davis, otherwise known as QCAlegirl, was born and raised in Davenport, Iowa, where she currently resides.
