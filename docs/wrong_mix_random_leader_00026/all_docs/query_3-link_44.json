        "text": "Cool Place\n\nCollaborative\n\nCreative\n\nWelcoming\n\nMusic Guild\n\n1584 34th Ave, Moline, IL 61265\n\nBroadway in the Park\n\nQuad City Music Guild is a must-see Quad City feature, located in Moline, Illinois. Known as “Broadway in the Park”, the non-profit theater began in 1949 in Prospect Park as an outdoor show, selling tickets for only $1.50. It has since expanded, while staying in the same location all these years. The theater became fully enclosed, giving it the opportunity to stay open year-round, adding a lobby, orchestra pit, and furnishings. The number of productions also increased in 2000 from 3 to 5 per year.\n\nBeing non-profit, everyone who has a hand in the production is a dedicated volunteer. This includes welcoming the audience into the building, concessions, production staff, performers, musicians, etc. No experience is needed to audition or become involved in the shows, everyone is welcome.\n\nIt takes hundreds of people to run productions every year. Each show is real-time proof of the homegrown talent and love for theater that the Quad Cities holds.\n\n“It is all volunteers, so everybody is doing this because they're really passionate about it, they really love the performing arts, they want to bring that locally produced theater to the Quad Cities,” said President Jen Sondergeroth.\n\nTo see for yourself how dedicated everyone involved is, check out one of their shows! Information is listed on their website and Facebook page.\n\nFor more information: Home | Quad City Music Guild (qcmusicguild.com)\n\nHave a question? Contact at\n\nvolunteer@qcmusicguild.com"
