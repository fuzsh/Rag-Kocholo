        "text": "Kulaiwi\n\nIndigenous Hawaiian performance\n\nIN RESIDENCE SEPT 30-OCT 5, 2024\n\nKulāiwi is three of Hawai‘i’s most delightful performers --Lehua Kalima (of Na Leo), Shawn Pimental, and Kawika Kahiapo – who have come together with hula dancer Pono Fernandez to share exceptional songwriting and cultural talents. Soaring vocals, island harmonies, superb guitar with a folk vibe, and fun “talk-story” won them 4 Nā Hōku Awards (Hawai‘i’s “Grammy’s”) for their first CD together, including top honors as Group of the Year. Kulāiwi means “land of my ancestors” and reflects their passionate commitment to their islands as they celebrate Hawai‘i today.\n\nWhile Kulāiwi sings songs for Hawai‘i, they tell stories for all Indigenous peoples and all ‘āina (lands). Their goal is to pay tribute to the people and ‘āina they visit, to spread the wider message of aloha ‘āina for Hawai‘i and all lands, with the hope that by telling the stories of their people and their land, they encourage communities to engage with their own stories--to sit at the feet of their ancestors and empower their voices to be heard and woven into the aho (rope) that binds us all together.\n\n​\n\nChicago\n\n​Dance Crash\n\nHip-hop/contemporary dance\n\nIN RESIDENCE JAN 13-17, 2025\n\nThe Crash residency is a multi-faceted engagement event including dance instruction, interactive discovery, and performances dedicated to the growth of art and self through cultural understanding. The origins of ballet in Italy, and modern, jazz, and hip hop in the U.S. are as influential to their own movement vocabularies as they are to the lifestyles embraced by their practitioners. In relating the origins of these forms to others we can better understand the importance of diversity in our lives and community. This performance encourages the students to take influence from the world around them and create their own means of self-expression.\n\nThe heart of Crash lies in its eight-member Performance Ensemble and dedicated Artistic Associates, whose professional training spans from New York and Los Angeles to Chicago’s Southside. With degrees in dance and a commitment to teaching K-8 students, these artists serve as ambassadors of street dance throughout the Midwest.\n\nUnder the visionary leadership of Artistic Director KC Bevis, Crash has emerged as the leading street dance fusion company in the Midwest. Known for its diverse repertoire, Crash’s performances feature choreography and freestyles by some of the nation’s top dance practitioners and tours annually across the U.S.\n\n​\n\nSomebody Loves You, Mr. Hatch\n\nChildren’s puppet theatre\n\nIN RESIDENCE JAN 27-31, 2025\n\n“Somebody Loves You, Mr. Hatch” is set in a friendly and quaint town in the 1940’s. Mr. Hatch is a tall, thin, lonely man who works a simple but important job attaching the aglets to shoelaces at a factory. He often spends time alone and doesn’t have the confidence or desire to make or keep friends.\n\nOne day his life turns around when he receives a package on Valentine’s Day with a pink bow that has a message that reads, “Somebody loves you.” Mr. Hatch’s world is turned upside down and he begins to make friends, enjoy all sorts of nice foods, and the fun parts of life that he once ignored. After receiving the letter, Mr. Hatch goes on a hunt to find out who sent him the mysterious package. Mr. Hatch is loved after all!\n\nThis heartwarming puppet play examines the effect that kindness can have on a lonely existence. Join washerwomen Betsy, Edna, and Molly as they bring Mr. Hatch’s story to life and help him search for his secret admirer!\n\n“Somebody Loves You, Mr. Hatch” has been adapted for the stage by Axis Theatre’s Artistic Director, Chris McGregor from the children’s novel by Eileen Spinelli. Run time: 35 minutes\n\n​\n\n​Goitse\n\nTraditional Irish music\n\nIN RESIDENCE FEB 18-21, 2025\n\nThe popular and multi-award-winning quintet Goitse was forged in the white-hot creative crucible of Limerick’s Irish World Academy. Named Live Ireland’s “Traditional Group of the Year” and Chicago Irish American News’ “Group of the Year”, Goitse have become a leader of the new generation of traditional Irish ensembles.\n\nTheir distinctive sound lies in the quality of their own compositions interspersed with age-old traditional tunes. Laying the foundations are World and All-Ireland Bodhrán champion Colm Phelan and Conal O’Kane, who is fast becoming one of the finest guitarists of his generation. The rhythm section sets a drive for the music while the sweet, charismatic voice of Áine McGeeney draws audiences into their songs. Multi-instrumentalist Alan Reid features mainly on banjo and bouzouki, drawing from an extensive knowledge of Irish music. Danny Collins is an All-Ireland piano champion, and is known for his distinctively intricate bass work on accordion. Together, the quintet Goitse makes what Irish Music Magazine calls “music that’s brimming with energy and creative zeal.”\n\nThe band members are collectively and individually leading teachers in the realm of traditional Irish folk music. They regularly give workshops not only on this type of music, but also on the related instruments, history, and culture.\n\n​"
