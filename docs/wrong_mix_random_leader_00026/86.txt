DAVENPORT, Iowa (KWQC) - Mark Cornish of Davenport has been selected as the recipient for the 2023 Civil Works Planning Excellence Award.

According to a media release, Cornish was selected by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Headquarters in Washington, D.C., for the award for his work on the Lock and Dam 22 Fish Passage project.

The Lock and Dam 22 Fish passage project, located near Saverton, Missouri, will create a nature-like fishway that could pass more than 160 different species of fish.

“Mark’s technical leadership on teams leads to water resources decisions that are innovative, environmentally sound, and fully collaborated with other agencies and partners,” said Terry Birkenstock, Chief of the Corps of the Corps of Engineers Regional Planning and Environment Division North, and Cornish’s supervisor.

Cornish began his career with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources working as an aquaculturist and field technician at the Fairport Fish Hatchery.

He moved to the Corps of Engineers in 1998, where he has worked as a biologist ever since.

“He embodies what planning excellence looks like with his ability to bring partners and stakeholders together towards a common vision and drive projects forward with a trust and credibility earned by not only his technical excellence but also his past actions,” Birkenstock said.

Cornish works for the Corps’ St. Paul District as a senior biologist and technical specialist but sits in the Corps’ Rock Island District, the release said.
