        "text": "Actor Chris Penn, veteran of many films, notably Footloose, Pale Rider, True Romance, Starsky & Hutch and Reservoir Dogs, was found in his dead by a housekeeper today, in his bed. An investigation is underway; according to the detective interviewed at the scene, this is standard procedure for anyone who dies under the age of 50 when there is no history of health or other likely causes of death (investigators' preliminary assumption is that Penn died of natural causes.)\n\nChristopher Penn had a laudable career in his own right, but it was understandably overshadowed by that of his far more famous and \"successful\" brother, Oscar® winner Sean Penn.\n\nAssociated Press:\n\nHis late father, Leo Penn, directed television shows. His mother, Eileen Ryan, is an actress whose credits include \"I Am Sam,\" \"Magnolia\" and \"Parenthood.\" Another brother is musician Michael Penn.\n\nChris Penn's latest film, \"The Darwin Awards,\" was scheduled to premiere Wednesday at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nMy immediate assumption was that Penn died of complications arising from obesity. He was terribly overweight, probably at least 100 pounds heavier than he was when he played the husky, lumbering would-be Travolta in Footloose. The Penns family does have a history of alcoholism, but there is no indication that Penn was an alcoholic or had any problems related to alcohol or drugs.\n\nHe was, however, involved in ONE alcohol-related incident a few years back...\n\nimdb.com:\n\n22 July 2003\n\nSean Penn's actor brother Chris Penn was booted out of hip Hollywood spot the Skybar - for fighting with a midget. The Reservoir Dogs star was involved in a brutal punch-up with a much smaller man, according to American tabloid the National Enquirer. The paper reports that after drinking with pals at the poolside, 5 foot 10 inch tall Chris was fighting through the crowd of patrons when he collided with a man who measured just 3 foot 5 inch.\n\nThe publication quotes a source as saying, \"Four-letter words exchanged, then they started pounding each other - and the midget ended up in the pool. It was surreal... Chris, who weighs over 200 pounds, savaging this tiny man!\" As guards dragged him away, he reportedly roared, \"Let me knock out that midget!\" before his opponent spat, \"Fuck you and your entire family, loser!\" Onlookers say a furious Chris was swiftly ejected from the hotspot.\n\nI hope he's in a cool place. He was a joyful person."
