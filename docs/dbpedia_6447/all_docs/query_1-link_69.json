If you dissect its meaning and characters, it literally translates as “before born” in the sense of someone having…\n\nA Ninja Response to Chris Brogan’s Pirates I of course couldn’t let the pirates win out over at Chris Brogan’s blog, so without further ado, a followup commentary on the beauty of pirate ships: one shot. The ninja clans of old were fundamentally a mix of esoteric practitioners of mind sciences mixed with samurai who…\n\nChoking in clarity Friday nights at the Boston Martial Arts Center are always interesting. It’s the night that black belts get to train and focus on material relevant to them (one of the few nights/evenings exclusively dedicated to advanced training).

Manessa went missing just before Thanksgiving, and regular search efforts were not generating results. Chris reached…\n\nFor every shadow there must be light Mark Yoshimoto Nemcoff coined the slogan “For every light that shines, a shadow falls” as part of his audio drama, Shadow Falls.
