        "text": "An Offer Refused\n\nAs Vince and Turtle are carried away by top-dollar decorating, Eric is anxious to get an offer in writing; Drama decides on elective surgery to 'augment' his livelihood; Ari breaks a deal in therapy with Mrs. Ari; and hotshot director Billy has big news about 'Queens Blvd.'\n\nFanilow\n\nOpting out of the annual Adler Design Christmas party, ultimate \"Fanilow\" Will (Eric McCormack) spends the night waiting in line for tickets to a special Barry Manilow (as himself) concert - only to have his weak bladder force him to make a quick pit stop and entrust Grace (Debra Messing) to hold his place. However, Will's snubbing of an overweight man in the bathroom line leaves his chances of meeting his idol in doubt. Meanwhile, a distraught Grace discovers her mother (guest star Debbie Reynolds, \"Singing in the Rain\") has cancelled on their annual Hanukkah shopping spree to have dinner with Jack (Sean Hayes) and Karen (Megan Mullally) as they embrace the inspiring music of Manilow.\n\nFate Accompli\n\nOn the morning of his Juilliard audition in New York, Ephram meets Madison (recurring guest star SARAH LANCASTER) for coffee and becomes distraught when she tells him that she was pregnant with their child. This devastating revelation causes Ephram to make decisions that will alter the course of his life. Meanwhile, back in Everwood, Amy is unsure of what will happen to her relationship with Ephram after he learns the truth about Madison. And Dr. Abbott counsels a man, Frank Sullivan (CHRIS PENN - \"Starsky & Hutch\"), whose son may die as a result of a hunting accident."
