        "text": "The Agricultural Systems and Microbial Genomics (ASMG) Laboratory was established to support Dr. Dou and Dr. Pitta in their research endeavors\n\nDr. Pitta is the ruminant nutritionist and microbiologist at the Center for Animal Health and Productivity (CAHP), New Bolton Center, University of Pennsylvania.\n\nResearch at the ASMG lab focuses primarily on the gut microbial composition of ruminants utilizing advanced molecular methodologies. The alimentary tract of a ruminant is colonized by millions of microbes living in a symbiotic relationship with the host. Therefore, knowledge of the microbial composition of the entire gut can provide insights into improving the overall health and productivity of the animal.\n\nThe advent of next generation sequencers has greatly enhanced our ability to explore community microbial populations. The ASMG lab has the capabilities to isolate bacteria and methanogens from the gastrointestinal contents of different ruminant species as well as apply multi-omic approaches to better characterize and understand the functional potential of rumen microbiota. The primary areas of focus include deciphering dietary-microbe, microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions that play essential roles in maintaining health and production while also minimizing negative impacts on the environment. Research efforts at ASMG are to understand the role of microbiota in ruminal methanogenesis and determine the impacts of different inhibitors on enteric methane inhibition, application of precision technologies to advance animal productivity and early life microbial interventions to improve health and welfare, and productivity of dairy cattle. Please research projects for further details.\n\nIn addition, The ASMG group collaborates with other researchers and clinicians both within the University of Pennsylvania as well as at other institutions. Research findings are disseminated via publications and are presented at conferences. The ASMG group strives to educate and train next generation students in application of microbial genomics to help address global issues such as Food Insecurity, Climate Change, Sustainable Agricultural Systems, and Mitigation of Antimicrobial Resistance. Opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds, ranging from high school through postdoctoral are available at ASMG laboratory to further their careers in microbial genomics and its applications\n\nRead More About The ASMG Laboratory - Microbial Genomics\n\nOur research has involved studies on mammalian germ cells and early embryos. Initially, we developed a culture system and manipulation techniques for mouse eggs that are the foundation for subsequent mammalian egg and embryo experiments in the field, including nuclear transfer and in vitro fertilization of human eggs.\n\nWe then used these methods to show that mouse blastocysts can be colonized by foreign stem cells and result in chimeric adults, which led to the development of embryonic stem cells. Subsequently, we used these culture and manipulation techniques to develop transgenic mice. In recent years, our research has focused on male germline stem cells, and these studies demonstrated that spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) from a fertile male mouse can be transplanted to the testes of an infertile male where they will colonize the seminiferous tubules and generate donor cell-derived spermatozoa, thereby restoring fertility.\n\nIn addition, SSCs of mice and other rodents can be cultured in vitro and their number increased, and the SSCs can be frozen and preserved for long periods. The ability to culture, transplant and cryopreserve SSCs makes the germline of individual males immortal. The transplantation and freezing methods are readily transferrable to the SSCs of all mammalian species.\n\nHowever, a culture system for SSCs of nonrodent species has proven to be difficult to develop, and published reports of success have not been independently confirmed and are not universally accepted. Therefore, in recent studies we have attempted to develop a reliable system to culture human SSCs, which is essential to preserve and expand for later use the SSCs of prepubertal boys who will receive germ cell destroying treatment for cancer.\n\nAs part of these studies, we are establishing the genes and regulating mechanism used by mouse and human SSCs to survive and replicate, which will contribute to the understanding necessary for human SSC culture and expansion. In the long term, a culture system will also allow the development of techniques to support SSC differentiation in vitro with production of spermatozoa capable of fertilizing eggs.\n\nIn addition, the SSC assay system provides a powerful technique in which to test the conversion of somatic cells to functional SSCs. Over the past 10 years, we and others have identified transcription factors and micro RNAs that play key roles in SSC self-renewal. In current research, we plan to use this information to reprogram somatic cells into germ cells, specifically SSCs. The transplantation assay provides an unequivocal conformation of this reprogramming for a single cell.\n\nMoreover, it allows for the identification of gene activation during the differentiation process in vivo and production of progeny from sperm produced from reprogrammed cells. In the future, the approach could be used to address fertility problems in humans and possibly the correction of genetic defects.\n\nThis research is supported by grants from National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development and the Robert J. Kleberg, Jr. and Helen C. Kleberg Foundation.\n\nRead More About The Brinster Laboratory of Reproductive Physiology\n\nNitrogen, Phosphorus, and Integrated Management\n\nNitrogen and phosphorus are essential nutrients for growing plants and animals. Insufficient nutrients diminish yields; excessive applications translate to wasted resources and environmental pollution. The work of Dr. Dou’s group features an integrated system nutrient management approach, coupling nutrient optimization in animal feeding with manure management and targeted nutrient application to crops for enhanced production efficiency and reduced environmental footprint.\n\nPlease see relevant projects and publications in 'Research Projects' and 'Publications' tab below.\n\nIntegrated whole farm management based on nutrients (pathogen) flow pathway\n\nPathogens, Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), and Livestock Farming\n\nLivestock animals are important reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens as well as antimicrobial resistant determinants (antibiotic residues, AMR microbes, and AMR genes). What happens to these “microbial pollutants” in the post-shed environment? How long do they survive under different management conditions? What is their distribution pattern in the intrinsically linked farming sectors and the dissemination pathways to the broader terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems? What intervention may help mitigate relevant risks associated with animal farming concerning food safety and public health? The research of Dr. Dou’s group addresses some of these critical issues.\n\nPlease see relevant projects and publications in 'Research Projects' and 'Publications' tab below.\n\nFood Waste, Food Security, and Sustainability\n\nSustainable food security is an issue that intersects many of the contemporary challenges the world is struggling to deal with today, e.g. water scarcity, water pollution, resource limitation, land degradation, habitat and biodiversity loss, climate change, and hunger and poverty. Dr. Dou collaborates with national and international experts to examine sustainable food security issues from multiple dimensions, such as food waste reduction and reuse, engaging, and empowering smallholder farmers, etc.\n\nPlease see relevant projects and publications in 'Research Projects' and 'Publications' tab below.\n\nDeveloping Novel Feeds from Food Waste and Crop Residue Biomass from Cows\n\nLivestock farming is at a crossroads, its sustainable future challenged by competing interests for limited resources and urgent need to mitigate environmental and climate footprints, amid a rapidly growing global demand for animal protein. One viable solution overlooked, is to leverage the innate ability of animals as nature’s most effective recyclers, able to utilize a wide variety of plant biomass materials as feed resources in producing meats, milk, and eggs. This project will deploy an innovative sequential fermentation approach to create novel feeds for dairy cows using food waste of fruit and vegetable discards and post-harvest crop residues such as wheat straw and spent mushroom substrates, abundantly available but currently wasted or landfilled.\n\nPlease see relevant projects and publications in 'Research Projects' and 'Publications' tab below.\n\nRead More About The Dou Laboratory\n\nThe Equine Behavior Program and Laboratory at New Bolton Center has grown from within the Section of Reproductive Studies. Since the early 1980s the program, has had research as its core activity. The program has included involvement in related clinical and teaching in the veterinary school and continuing education programs nationally and internationally. The initial research focus of the laboratory was on stallion reproductive physiology and behavior.\n\nEarly research concentrated on the physiology and pharmacology of libido, erection, and ejaculation, with immediate application to clinical problems in breeding stallions and with relevance to the understanding of human sexual dysfunction.\n\nAnother long-standing research interest of our laboratory has been the effects of experience on sexu al function. In the 1990s our research and clinical work expanded beyond stallions to include reproductive and general behavior problems of horses.\n\nThe Behavior Lab is housed in The Havemeyer Barn at The Georgia and Philip Hofmann Center for Animal Reproduction.\n\nRead More About The Havemeyer Equine Behavior Research Lab\n\nThe “Modz Lab” is interested in the phenomenon of Retrotransposon Reactivation in development and disease. Making up nearly 50% of the human genome, retrotransposons have recently emerged as important features of Normal Biology across all mammalian species. Transposons have rewired regulatory networks and provided raw material for genetic innovation through co-option of innate regulatory sequences and repurposing (domestication) of proteins that were once used to invade our genomes. These events were critical in shaping evolution and are responsible for essential biological breakthroughs like the placenta, VDJ recombination, memory plasticity and much more.\n\nOur work is aimed at understanding the exciting and emerging roles that retrotransposons have throughout development where reactivation is essential and intentional. The genome goes through great lengths to suppress the activity of retrotransposons by evolving epigenetics mechanisms to silence these parasites until the invading elements is defeated and mutated over millions of years. A small handful of these retain regulatory and coding capacity that provide some benefit to the host, but the vast majority of these cases are completely unknown. For brief instances in the early preimplantation embryo (and likely the germline), these surveillance mechanisms are paradoxically relaxed and allow the retrotransposons to reactivate for unknown reasons. My work has shown at least one mechanism is essential for development in the mouse. I have generated Retrotransposon KnockOut (KO) mouse models to study distinct mechanisms that operate in the early embryo and found they control and participate in various essential processes. This is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what Retrotransposons are capable of. We next apply these findings to study the unintentional retrotransposon reactivations that occur during epigenetic breakdown associated with aging, disease and cancer.\n\nOur lab primarily focuses on how retrotransposons impact preimplantation embryo development and fertility in mice and adopt comparative biology studies using various mammalian species to learn about human health and reproduction. To this end, that lab has two major but linked focuses: Developmental Biology and Genome Editing.\n\nResearch Topics:\n\nStudy mammalian preimplantation embryos to understand the biological importance of retrotransposon reactivation.\n\nPhenotypical analysis and mechanistic understanding of retrotransposon knockout (KO) mouse models.\n\nDevelop Humanized mouse models to study Human specific retrotransposons.\n\nProbe embryos, germline and stem cells to understand retrotransposon regulation.\n\nExplore retrotransposon reactivation consequences outside of the embryo, where epigenetic breakdown occurs, such as aging, disease and cancer.\n\nImprovements to genome editing technologies (CRISPR-EZ) in mammalian embryos for longer inserts, higher efficiency and lower costs.\n\nVisit www.TheModzLab.org for additional information.\n\nRead More About The Modzelewski Laboratory\n\nLed by Katrin Hinrichs, DVM, PhD, DACT, the Harry Werner Endowed Professor of Equine Medicine and Chair of the Department of Clinical Studies-New Bolton Center, the Penn Equine Assisted Reproduction Laboratory (PEARL) performs both research and clinical work in equine assisted reproduction. The Laboratory conducts research into equine sperm capacitation (readiness for fertilization), oocyte maturation, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), standard in vitro fertilization, and equine embryo development, and is one of the few laboratories in the United States performing clinical ICSI to produce foals from client mares and stallions. Dr. Hinrichs has pioneered research in these areas, producing the first foal from ICSI and embryo culture in North America in 2003, and the first cloned horse foal in North America in 2005.\n\nDr. Hinrichs’ research has established methods for equine assisted reproductive techniques that are now used clinically worldwide, including methods for successfully holding and shipping equine oocytes, for performing equine embryo biopsy, which allows genetic diagnosis of embryos before transfer to avoid production of foals with genetic diseases, and methods for successful vitrification (freezing) of expanded equine blastocysts, which allows embryos to be produced from older or valuable mares year-round while still supporting the production of foals that have early birth dates.\n\nRead More About The PEARL-Penn Equine Assisted Reproduction Laboratory\n\nResearch Interests\n\nOur main research interest is innate immune recognition and elimination of pathogens. Our work focuses on the interaction between mosquitoes and the animal and human pathogens they transmit. As the most species-rich group of animals on the planet occupying a vast array of ecological niches, insects are a fantastic example of the potency of innate defenses.\n\nPoveLab on TV and in the news:\n\n★ The changing landscape of mosquito- and tick-borne diseases\n\n★ News piece by Tom Avril in Philly.com\n\n★ TV spot by John McDevitt for CBS 3 Philly\n\n★ See us on Xploration Awesome Planet \"Insects\" (Season 3 Episode 10)\n\n★ View UPenn Spotlight on Our Work\n\nRather than passive or willing carriers of pathogenic organism, mosquitoes are actually amazing pathogen killers. Taking mosquito interactions with malaria parasites as an example, the vast majority of the parasites ingested when a mosquito bites a malarious person are attacked and eliminated before they can mount an infection in the mosquito. It is the few parasites that survive (even one is sufficient), that are ultimately responsible for disease transmission. Similar interactions occur between mosquitoes and the other pathogens they transmit, like canine heartworm (Dirofilaria) and arboviruses (Zika, Dengue, Yellow Fever, West Nile, and Chikungunya).\n\nArthropod vectors such as mosquitoes, sand flies and ticks are responsible for transmission of a large number of animal and human diseases worldwide. Studying these organisms may reveal general insights about innate immune defense mechanisms as well as provide novel avenues for controlling the terrible diseases they spread.\n\nSome of the questions we are addressing:\n\nWhat is the basis of pathogen recognition by the mosquito innate immune system and how do some pathogens manage to escape?\n\nWhat is the biochemical mechanism leading from innate recognition to pathogen killing?\n\nHow is mosquito complement regulated?\n\nHow does steroid hormone signaling regulate mosquito immunity?\n\nRead More About The Povelones Laboratory\n\nCheck out the new Vaughan Laboratory Website\n\nDr. Vaughan’s research is focused on defining and understanding the relevant cell types and molecular mechanisms by which the mammalian lung is able to regenerate after severe injury. He is especially interested in elucidating the means by which epithelial progenitors contribute to repaired airway and alveolar units after various lung insults (influenza, ARDS, fibrosis). His studies suggest that physiological lung function is in fact dictated by progenitor cell fate choices after injury.\n\nDr. Vaughan and his group have developed a novel orthotopic cell transplantation assay which allows for the direct assessment of engraftment, proliferation, and differentiation potential of these stem cells. Further, he is actively investigating the roles of the Notch, Wnt, and BMP pathways in regulating the differentiation potential and fate of expanded progenitor cells post-injury.\n\nDr. Vaughan is part of the CAMB (DSRB) graduate group, and is a member of the Penn Institute for Regenerative Medicine (IRM).\n\nRead a recent interview with Dr. Vaughan by the Institute of Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania...\n\nInterested in Working in the Vaughan Lab?\n\nDr. Vaughan is currently seeking new graduate students to join his laboratory team. He welcomes inquiries for potential rotations from incoming students. Contact Dr. Vaughan directly at andrewva@vet.upenn.edu\n\nRead More About The Vaughan Laboratory\n\nOur group focuses on the study of regulation of meiosis, the biology of small non-coding RNAs (piRNAs), epigenetics of transposable elements, and biology of spermatogonial stem cells.\n\nMeiosis, a cell division unique to germ cells, allows the reciprocal exchange of genetic material between paternal and maternal genomes. Meiosis generates the genetic diversity necessary for evolution of species.\n\nAbnormality in meiosis is a leading cause of birth defects and infertility. Our research interests include molecular genetics of chromosomal synapsis, DNA double-strand break repair, homologous recombination, genetic causes of male infertility in humans, piRNA biogenesis, and epigenetic silencing of transposable elements.\n\nWe have performed two genome-wide screens to identify novel factors that regulate germ cell development in mice: a genomics screen has identified 36 germ cell-specific genes; a proteomics screen has uncovered more than 50 meiotic chromatin-associated proteins.\n\nFunctional characterization of a number of new genes in our laboratory has uncovered novel regulatory mechanisms underlying key biological processes unique to germ cells. On one hand, our studies provide molecular insights into the development of germ cells in mice. On the other hand, these mouse studies have important implications for understanding the genetic causes of male infertility in humans.\n\nWe employ a battery of the state-of-the-art technologies in our research: gene targeting, genome editing, genomics, proteomics, cell biological and molecular biological approaches.\n\nRead More About The Wang Laboratory\n\nWelcome to the Wolfe Lab, supervised by John H. Wolfe, Professor of Pathology and Medical Genetics in Pediatrics and Director, Walter Flato Goodman Center for Comparative Medical Genetics.\n\nDescription of Research\n\nOur lab works on transferring disease correcting genes into the central nervous system (CNS) in animal models of human genetic diseases. In these diseases, the CNS is often not rescued by the therapies that help the rest of the body. The lab studies both ex vivo gene transfer into neural stem cells that are then transplanted and in vivo transfer using vectors injected directly into the brain.\n\nOur studies involve comparisons of both the vectors used to introduce the genes into cells and the properties of the genes themselves. Additionally, we examine the ability of different cell types and subregions of the brain to be corrected. We also pursue new methods to follow the corrected cells and the expression of the correcting gene in the live animal using MRI and PET techniques. For a complete understanding of the therapy, we also are working on achieving a better understanding of the mechanism of these diseases in the brain.\n\nProjects\n\nProjects involve the molecular design and engineering of vectors, the understanding of the fate of vector-transferred genes in the brain, the regulation of gene expression from vectors, the biology of neural stem cell, the study of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), the use of imaging studies in genetic disease and gene therapy, and the proteomic and genomics analysis of the neurodegenerative brain. For students, projects can be tailored to interests, learning goals, and experience.\n\nRead More About The Wolfe Laboratory"
