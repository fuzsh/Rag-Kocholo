        "text": "Sorry Fugees fans. Looks like you won’t get to see the famed hip-hop group perform live this year after all.\n\nA U.S. leg of the “The Miseducation Anniversary Tour” featuring Lauryn Hill and the Fugees has been canceled according to Variety and the Independent.\n\nThe first show was scheduled to begin in Tampa, Fla., on Friday, Aug. 9.\n\nNo reason was provided, but scheduled dates were removed from Ticketmaster, news reports said.\n\nSeveral ticketholders posted screenshots of messages they received from Live Nation stating that the event had been canceled and that their money would be refunded.\n\nTickets remain on sale for the European leg of the tour that runs from Oct. 12-22, Variety said. It’s not known if those shows will be canceled as well.\n\n“The Miseducation Anniversary Tour” was scheduled to stop in Pa. on Aug. 21 at TD Pavilion at The Mann in Philadelphia.\n\nThe tour was designed to celebrate the Grammy-winning 1998 album “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” but would also include songs from the Fugees’ 1996 album \"The Score.” The shows would feature Hill and her former Fugees bandmates Pras and Wyclef Jean.\n\nIn November of last year, Hill and the Fugees postponed several tour dates due to what Hill said was severe vocal strain.\n\nA reunion tour was initially announced in 2021, but then postponed and canceled due to the COVID pandemic."
