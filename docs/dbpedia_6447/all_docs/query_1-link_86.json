        "text": "Since entering the league in 2008-09, DeBoer ranks fourth in regular season wins and first in games coached. In the 2023 postseason, the Stars became the fourth franchise Peter DeBoer has led to a Conference Finals/Semifinals appearance (also Vegas, San Jose & New Jersey), a feat accomplished by only one other head coach in NHL history â Scotty Bowman (5; St. Louis, Montreal, Buffalo, Pittsburgh & Detroit). Additionally, DeBoer is the only head coach in NHL history to lead a franchise to a Conference Finals/Semifinals appearance in his first season as head coach on four separate occasions. DeBoer has also reached the Stanley Cup Final on two occasions, first with New Jersey (2012) and then with San Jose (2016). Boasting a record of 78-64 in 142 postseason contests, DeBoer ranks second in playoff games coached behind Jon Cooper (145) and third in wins behind Cooper (86) and Joel Quenneville (79) since 2008-09. During the 2021 Stanley Cup Playoffs, DeBoer became the first coach in NHL history to win his first five Game 7 appearances and has a record of 7-0 in Game 7s, including a 2-1 victory over Seattle in the Western Conference Second Round on May 15, 2023. With the win, DeBoer became the third coach to win a Game 7 with four different teams, joining Darryl Sutter (8-3 with Calgary, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Jose) and Scotty Bowman (6-3 with Buffalo, Detroit, Montreal, Pittsburgh and St. Louis).\n\n&nbsp\n\nDeBoer joined the Stars after spending parts of three seasons as the head coach of the Vegas Golden Knights. Hired midway through the 2019-20 season, he guided the Golden Knights to the 2020 Western Conference Final against the Stars. In his time with Vegas, DeBoer earned a 98-50-12 record in 160 regular-season contests with a .650 points percentage. He led Vegas to the postseason in two of his three campaigns with the club, registering a 22-17 record in 39 postseason games and reaching the semifinal round in both the 2020 and 2021 Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\n&nbsp\n\nPrior to his time in Vegas, DeBoer served as the head coach for San Jose over five seasons (2015-19) and amassed a 198-129-34 record in 361 regular-season games. He qualified for the Stanley Cup Playoffs in four of his five campaigns with the Sharks and helped lead the team to its first Stanley Cup Final appearance in franchise history during the 2015-16 season.

Additionally, he served as the head coach for three seasons (2008-11) in Florida and recorded a 103-107-36 mark in 246 regular-season games.\n\n&nbsp\n\nHis extensive head coaching resume includes 13 seasons behind the bench in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), capturing the 2003 Memorial Cup Championship and two OHL championships (2003, 2008) with Kitchener. DeBoer won the OHL Coach of the Year award in 1999 and 2000 with Plymouth and captured the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) Coach of Year Award in 2000. He is one of eight coaches in OHL history to reach the 500-win plateau (539) and ranks eighth all-time in OHL wins.\n\n&nbsp\n\nDeBoer has represented Team Canada on several occasions on the international stage, capturing gold medals for his country at the 2015 IIHF World Championship and the 2005 World Junior Championship. He served on the coaching staff at four IIHF World Championships (2010, 2011, 2014, 2015), two World Junior Championships (1998, 2005) and at the 2007 Canada-Russia Super Series.\n\n&nbsp\n\nPrior to his coaching career, he was originally selected by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 12th round (237th overall) of the 1988 NHL Draft and played two seasons of professional hockey with the Milwaukee Admirals of the International Hockey League (IHL).\n\nDeBoer and his wife Susan, have one daughter, Abigail, and two sons, Jack and Matthew.\n\nSpott also spent two seasons with the Toronto Maple Leafs organization from 2013-15. He was an assistant coach with the Maple Leafs during the 2014-15 campaign and was the head coach of the Toronto Marlies (AHL) for the 2013-14 season.
