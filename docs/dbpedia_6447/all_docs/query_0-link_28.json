        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfessions Actor , Director , Screenwriter\n\nBirth name Christopher Shannon Penn\n\nNationality American\n\nBirth October 10, 1965 (Los Angeles, California – United States)\n\nDeath January 24, 2006 (Santa Monica, California – United States)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nBrother of Sean Penn .\n\nComing from a family of actors, Chris Penn took drama lessons from the age of twelve. In 1983, Francis Ford Coppola ‘s Rusty James revealed to the international public a new generation of actors to which he belonged along with Matt Dillon , Nicolas Cage and Mickey Rourke . The same year, he co-starred in Team Spirit alongside Tom Cruise then followed with the musical comedy Footloose , in which his partner was Kevin Bacon . Humiliated by Clint Eastwood in Pale Rider (1985), he remains in the shadow of his brother in the drama Like a Mad Dog (id.) by James Foley . It was not until 1992 and his role as gangster Nice Guy Eddie in Reservoir Dogs that Chris Penn literally exploded on the screen. Accustomed to playing violent characters with unexpected reactions, he was coldly shot down by Patricia Arquette in True Romance (1993) and, in desperation, killed his brother, played by Christopher Walken , in the mafia tragedy Our Funerals (1996). Subsequently, he was often confined to small appearances in police comedies like Rush Hour (1998) and Starsky and Hutch (2004)."
