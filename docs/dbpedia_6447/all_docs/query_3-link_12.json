        "text": "Character actor Chris Penn worked tirelessly to escape out from under the shadows of his older brothers, actor Sean Penn and musician Michael Penn, by carving a respectable onscreen résumé playing angry, deeply wounded men in films like \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1991), and \"The Funeral\" (1996). Like his brother Sean, Chris Penn started acting at a young age, offering solid support as impulsive young men in \"Footloose\" (1984), \"Pale Rider\" (1985) and in his brother's \"At Close Range\" (1986). \"Reservoir Dogs\" gave him entry into major features as a character player with enormous potential, as evidenced by his dramatic turn in Robert Altman's \"Short Cuts\" (1993). His career appeared to plateau in the late 1990s, though he continued to work steadily until his death in 2006 from health issues. His untimely departure robbed the entertainment industry of a talented player who had yet to find the proper vehicle for his abilities."
