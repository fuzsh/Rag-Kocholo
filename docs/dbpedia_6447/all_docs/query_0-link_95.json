        "text": "Nice Guy Eddie was the son of the crime boss Joe Cabot, and stood out from the rest of the cast, who were uniformly clad in black suits and ties,by wearing a repulsive shell suit and dripping with gold jewellery.\n\nClutching a mobile phone the size of a brick, he boasts of the extent of their operations - \"We've got places all over the place\" - while planning a diamond heist which is later to go spectacularly wrong.\n\nThe film's climax, in which three villains are engaged in a 'Mexican standoff', pointing guns at each other, created endless disputes amongst film nerds, since no one seemed to have shot Eddie.\n\n\"It was a mistake,\" Penn later explained. \"What was supposed to happen - and I don't know if Quentin's gonna like me giving this away, but it's too late now, he never told me not to - was Harvey Keitel was supposed to shoot Lawrence Tierney, then shoot me, then get squibbed.\n\n\"But what happened was the squib [a small explosive charge resembling a bullet hit] on Harvey went right off after he shot Lawrence, so he went down, but my squib went off anyway, so I went down. So, basically nobody shot Nice Guy Eddie. Quentin said, 'You know what? It'll be the biggest controversy of the film. We're leaving it.' He was definitely right.\"\n\nChristopher Ryan Penn was born in Los Angeles, the son of Leo Penn, a successful TV and film director, and his wife, the actress Eileen Ryan.\n\nMost sources give his date of birth as October 10 1965, though Penn was cagey on the subject; asked how old he was in 1996, he replied: \"I'm getting up there - I've stopped saying.\"\n\nHe began acting at the Loft Studios as a child, and took his first film role as Pete in Charlie and the Talking Buzzard in 1979.\n\nPenn, who shared with his brother a combative streak, was expelled from high school and spent some time as a boxer, but got his real break on screen in Francis Ford Coppola's Rumble Fish (1983), before playing Willard Hewitt in the absurd but popular dance movie Footloose the following year.\n\nThough he had a part in the western Pale Rider opposite Clint Eastwood, and appeared with his brother and mother in At Close Range, Penn then gained a reputation for trouble.\n\nA daughter with his then fiancee died two days after her birth, and he went off the rails, becoming a cocaine addict and being arrested for brawling and for carrying an unlicensed gun.\n\nHe worked briefly on a building site before giving up drugs and landing the role of Eddie. \"I knew that part would change everything,\" he said.\n\nPenn was excellent in Robert Altman's Short Cuts (1993) and Abel Ferrara's gangster movie The Funeral. He had roles in Mulholland Falls (1996) and Starsky and Hutch (2004).\n\nHe also appeared in tripe such as Best of the Best (a kick-boxing movie) and Best of the Best 2, and was the voice of a policeman in the video game 'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'.\n\nPenn appeared most recently in The Darwin Awards, which premiered at the Sundance Festival the day before he was found dead in an apartment in Santa Monica.\n\nHe never got married, though he lived for a time with the model Stefianna de la Cruz.\n\n© Telegraph"
