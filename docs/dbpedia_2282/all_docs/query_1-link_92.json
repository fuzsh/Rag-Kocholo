        "text": "I am Abbot Bernard Benedict, and since February 1st 2024, Pastor at Saint Matthias Catholic Church. I was born in Curaçao (Dutch Caribbean) and formed educationally in Europe and the America’s. Since 11th of July 1986 I have been a member of the Cistercian Order of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary where I served as a Prior and also an Abbot.\n\nI was raised in the sacramental church from birth and have been very active in the church, especially in the Caribbean Catholic Charismatic Renewal and Music Ministry. As a Monk I have been active since 1989 in loving service to my Lord Jesus, within the Church.\n\nMy calling, which came early on in my life, lead to me entering the religious Order and within the Order having received the ordinations which led to the calling of becoming the Abbot General of the Cistercian Order of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary with various religious worldwide.\n\nIn 2021 another calling came in my direction, with which I trusted our Lord God and as a response to that calling as of February 1s 2024 I am serving as Pastor at the Saint Matthias Catholic Church in Rockwall, Texas. As part of that calling I am also serving the Hispanic community here at Saint Matthias Catholic Church.\n\nFrom whichever religious background you may be, Saint Matthias welcomes you to better your understanding in Catholicism. Especially in a fast changing world, Saint Matthias Catholic Church would like to be that constant that is there to support you in your faith journey.\n\nI personally welcome the opportunity to visit with you if you would give me that honor. Just give me a call and let’s plan to meet and talk about our Lord and about how we can serve the Lord better together! Hope to see you soon!\n\nMay you be inspired to follow Jesus each day in your life and experience Him in your daily life!\n\nAbbot Bernard Benedict CSJM"
