        "text": "OUR QUEEN : MARY\n\nWe have new General Superior and General Council, to serve the Congregation. One of the main mission of the General Superior in union with the General Council is protecting the heritage of the Founders (Const a.1). One of the heritage is “a special veneration towards Mary”. It is in such a way important, since the name of the Congregation is “Congregation of the Brothers of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary”. Mary is venerated through many Feasts of Mary in the Church; one of which is celebrated today “Mary, the Queen”.\n\nMary is called “Our Queen” because that “...is bourne out by our faith in Him, who is the foundation of all our being” (C.a.2) and it is “fulfilled completely in Jesus” (Const. a.3). Many Church’s teacher call Jesus as the King of Kings and serve as Saviour of the whole World. We will try to follow Jesus like His Mother, Mary, because she is the nearest to Jesus in putting the Will of God, with the full grace of the Holy Spirit (Const. a. 10). On this position, Mary is called the Queen, on the side of the King of Kings, her Son. We remember, that she was present when the Son of God became man; she was present when the Son God was born; she was around when Her Son taught the disciples; she was present when the Son gave Himself on the Cross; she was with the Disciples when the Holy Spirit was given to His People. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church: Mary received it all because of a very deep reason.\n\nThe reasons are much more than her personal love for God the Father, or her personal “Yes” to the Holy Spirit and even her personal love to her Son Jesus, the Christ. It is of course much more than her human quality. She is our Queen because of her deepest feeling and understanding and life together with Jesus, her Son,- and in all that because of her being blessed among women in the love of the Trinity.\n\nIf we see in Mary our Queen, it is a sign of our faith to God, to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. It implies, that all our mind and heart and hands are ready to serve the Lord, the others and the whole World. That way, we unite ourselves with the whole Church. We become one of the sons and daughters of our Mother Church, the Spouse of Jesus Christ, to proclaim the Love in the Family of God."
