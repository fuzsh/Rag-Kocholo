        "text": "St. Bernard of Clairvaux Biography\n\nSt. Bernard of Clairvaux was a 12th century French monk and theologian, who was one of the most influential figures of his time. He was a key figure in the Cistercian Order and was a significant figure in the development of Western monasticism and spirituality.\n\nSt. Bernard was born into a noble French family in 1090 AD. At the age of 23, he left his home and joined the Cistercian Order, a newly-formed monastic order that emphasized a return to the simplicity of the early Christian monastic life. He became a monk at the Cistercian monastery of Cîteaux and quickly rose to prominence within the order.\n\nIn 1115 AD, Bernard was appointed to found a new monastery, Clairvaux, which quickly became one of the most important monastic centers of the Middle Ages. He became the abbot of the monastery and it had a strong influence on the development of Western monasticism and spirituality. Under his guidance, the monastery of Clairvaux grew rapidly, and he would go on to establish over sixty daughter-houses across Europe.\n\nSt. Bernard’s theology and preaching were also a central figure of his time. He became one of the most important thinkers of the 12th century, and his sermons were attended by thousands of people. He was a powerful advocate for the Church, and his writings and sermons were widely read and studied. He was also a strong advocate for the Second Crusade, preaching it to many European leaders and going on it himself.\n\nSt. Bernard’s theology was marked by his emphasis on the love of God and the importance of personal faith. He stressed the importance of humility, and encouraged his followers to seek a deep personal relationship with God. His sermons and writings emphasized the importance of meditation and contemplation in the spiritual life, and he was one of the first to encourage the use of the Jesus Prayer, a simple prayer of the heart.\n\nSt. Bernard’s influence extended beyond the monastic world. He was also sought after by political leaders of his time, including kings and popes, for counsel and guidance on various matters. He was a powerful voice for the Church and his writings, letters, and sermons had a major impact on the intellectual and spiritual life of the Middle Ages.\n\nHe died on August 20, 1153 AD, his tomb at Clairvaux quickly became a pilgrimage site, and he was canonized by Pope Alexander III in 1174. Today, his feast day is celebrated on August 20th by the Catholic Church and on August 21st by the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\nSt. Bernard is remembered as one of the most important figures of the Middle Ages and is considered one of the greatest spiritual masters of the Western Church. His teachings and writings continue to be studied and his influence in monasticism and spirituality is widely acknowledged. The Cistercian order that he helped to reform continues to thrive and his rule is still followed by many monasteries and monks today.\n\nThe Life of St. Bernard of Clairvaux\n\nSaint Bernard was born at Fontaines, in the year 1090, the third son of Tescelin and his wife Aleth, both of whom were worthy to be the parents of a Saint. All of their children were offered to God at their birth, and God accepted the offering, for their six sons became Monks at Citeaux and their one daughter a Nun. But Bernard was especially devoted to God’s service.\n\nHarassed with doubts and perplexities, one day he entered a church and prayed for guidance. He heard voice saying to him in the words of the Apocalypse (22:17) “And he that heareth, let him say: Come”; and when he left the church he had determined to accept the invitation of God. But he did not go alone: first his uncle, then his brothers, and finally several of his friends resolved to follow where he led, until he had gathered around him thirty disciples. For six months they led a community life at Chatillon, and when all difficulties had been removed they set out for Citeaux. Bernard’s arrival was the turning point in the history of Citeaux, as the entry of so many postulants ensured the future of the Order.\n\nIn 1115, Bernard, although young in years and young in the monastic life, was chosen to found a new monastery. The site selected presented almost hopeless difficulties. It was in the diocese of Langres, on the left bank of the Aube, called the Valley of Bitterness. Later the name was changed, perhaps by Bernard himself, to Clara Vallis (Clairvaux, or the Bright Valley). Bernard with twelve companions (four of whom were his brothers ) set out to face the hardships that awaited them-cold, hunger, and the want of everything.\n\nThe Great Preacher\n\nBernard encouraged his companions by precept and example. When their needs became known, relief was given. Later this monastery became known as the celebrated Abbey of Clairvaux, of which St. Bernard remained Abbot for the rest of his life. Clairvaux, in turn, led to the creation of one hundred and sixty other Cistercian houses. St. Bernard became the most conspicuous person in the 12th century.\n\nThe effect of his fervent, eloquent preaching in the diocese of William of Champeaux was astonishing and instantaneous. Men of all classes followed him to Clairvaux. He became, and remained until his death, the arbiter of kings, the counsellor of Popes, the champion of the Church. The influence he wielded on the spirituality of the West was enormous. He was commissioned by Pope Eugene III, to preach the Second Crusade in 1146. His preaching kindled the enthusiasm of Christendom and in influenced the European politics of his age.\n\nSt. Bernard died at Clairvaux on August 20, 1153, and was buried in the Ladye-Chapel of his Abbey. Since its destruction in 1792, his relics have been venerated in the neighboring parish church. St. Bernard was canonized by Pope Alexander III, in 1804, the first of the Cistercians to be so honored; and he was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church by Pope Pius VIII, in 1830.\n\nPrayer to St. Bernard\n\nPrayer for Humility\n\nO St. Bernard of Clairvaux, intercede for me that I may be humble in heart, obedient in all things to God’s will, and self-effacing in service to others. May I seek not my own interests, but the interests of Jesus Christ and of His holy Church.\n\nPrayer for Wisdom\n\nO St. Bernard of Clairvaux, prayerful and learned Doctor of the Church, I ask for your intercession that I may grow in wisdom and understanding. May I learn to discern God’s will in all things and live my life according to His holy plan.\n\nPrayer for Devotion to Mary\n\nO St. Bernard of Clairvaux, devoted lover of the Blessed Virgin Mary, I ask for your intercession that I may imitate your deep love and devotion to her. May I always seek her maternal protection, comfort, and guidance in all things, especially in moments of trial and temptation.\n\nPrayer for Strength in Persecution\n\nO St. Bernard of Clairvaux, who suffered persecution and ridicule for your faith, I ask for your intercession that I may have the strength to endure any persecution or opposition that I may face in my own life. May I remain steadfast in my faith, always trusting in God’s love and providence.\n\nSt. Bernard of Clairvaux: The Patron Saint of Beekeepers and the Cistercian Order\n\nSt. Bernard of Clairvaux was a 12th-century French abbot and preacher who is revered as one of the most important saints in the Western Church.
