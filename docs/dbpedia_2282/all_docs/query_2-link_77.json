        "text": "Mother Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, is one of the most revered figures in Christianity. She is often depicted as a symbol of purity, grace, and devotion. However, we must remember that Mary was also human and experienced many emotions throughout her life – just like you.\n\nIn this article, we highlight some of the events in Mary’s life where she experienced the human emotions that we do. Mary walks WITH people in their journey because she too walked a journey with Jesus. She understands us and leads us to Jesus.\n\nOne of the most significant moments in Mary’s life was when she learned that she would be the mother of Jesus. According to the Bible (Luke chapter 1), the angel Gabriel appeared to Mary and told her that she had been chosen to bear the son of God. Mary’s initial reaction was one of fear and confusion. This news must have been overwhelming for her, and we can only imagine the mix of emotions she must have felt. Fear, doubt, confusion, and even joy may have been among the many emotions she experienced at that moment. She was a young woman who had never been with a man, and the idea of becoming pregnant with the son of God was overwhelming.\n\nWe recall that Joseph had made plans to divorce Mary but decided not to on account of the angel of the Lord. (Matthew 1:19) Mary and Joseph had to work together to move forward. They likely had several conversations about what had happened to them.\n\nAs Mary’s pregnancy progressed, she likely experienced a mix of emotions. She may have felt joy and excitement at the prospect of becoming a mother but also anxiety and uncertainty about what the future would hold.\n\nWhen Mary and Joseph traveled to Bethlehem for the birth of Jesus, they faced several challenges. There was no room for them at the inn, and Mary gave birth in a stable (Luke 2:7). Despite the less-than-ideal circumstances (giving birth in a stable surrounded by animals), Mary likely felt an overwhelming sense of love and protectiveness for her newborn son. She may have felt a sense of vulnerability. Yet, she still found the strength to give birth to her son and care for him under these difficult circumstances.\n\nAs Jesus grew up, Mother Mary would have watched him go through the normal stages of childhood, including the challenges of adolescence. She would have experienced the same worries and fears that any mother would have for her child, even though she knew that Jesus was destined for greatness.\n\nWhen Jesus began his ministry, Mother Mary would have been proud of him, but also concerned for his safety. She would have witnessed his miracles and teachings, but also seen the opposition and persecution he faced from those who did not believe in him. She would have felt a mix of emotions, from joy and pride to fear and sadness.\n\nWhen Jesus was arrested and sentenced to death (John 18 and John 19), Mary was present at his crucifixion. The pain and grief she must have felt at watching her son suffer and die are difficult to imagine.\n\nIn all of these moments, Mother Mary experienced the full range of human emotions. She felt fear, doubt, confusion, joy, pride, sadness, and grief, just like any other human being. Yet, through it all, she remained faithful and devoted to God, and her unwavering faith and strength continue to inspire people today.\n\nIn conclusion, Mother Mary was not just a symbol of purity and grace, but also a human being who experienced the same emotions and challenges as the rest of us. Her story reminds us that even in the midst of difficult circumstances, we can find hope and strength in our faith. We can look to her example of unwavering devotion and trust in God as a source of inspiration and comfort in our own lives.\n\nWe invite you to learn more about The National Shrine of Mary Mother of the Church through our website.
