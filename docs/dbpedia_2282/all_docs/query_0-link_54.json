        "text": "What is Couples For Christ?\n\nCouples for Christ (CFC) is a Catholic Christian movement intended for the renewal and strengthening of Christian family life. The members have committed themselves to the Lord and to one another so that they may grow in maturity as men and women of God and fulfill their primary vocation of raising up families under the Lordship of Jesus Christ and for the service of the Kingdom of God.\n\nCouples for Christ is a work of Christ which raises up Christian couples and establishes Christian families committed to the work of evangelization, winning the world for Christ and Total Human Liberation through the power of the Holy Spirit. CFC grows mainly through the establishment of localized community ministry in different Catholic Parishes.\n\nWHY SUCH MINISTRY?\n\nIt is God’s plan that the family be the basic unit of society. However, there are many forces in the world today that would, wittingly or unwittingly, destroy the very foundations of the family. CFC wants to rise in defense of the family, which is God’s work. CFC wants to bring God’s strength and light to those who are struggling to be truly Christian families in the modern world.\n\nThrough the years, CFC has blossomed into a worldwide ministry, becoming a major force for the renewal of Christian family life and also of the church.\n\nHOW DOES CFC INTEND TO WORK FOR CHRISTIAN FAMILY RENEWAL?\n\n1. Individual renewal. Before one can consider the whole family, the husband and the wife first need to renew their commitment to God. CFC takes the basic message of Christianity and proclaims it anew so that those who hear it can make a renewed commitment to God in a way that will allow them to receive a fuller experience of the work of the Holy Spirit in their lives.\n\n2. Family renewal. As couples renew their commitment to God, they also renew their commitment to one another and to their Christian family life. Gradually, the new life that they find in the Lord filters down to all their family relationships.\n\n3. Church renewal. As individual families are renewed, they form a network of equally committed families that not only support one another but also strengthen the Church of which they are members.\n\nWHO CAN BECOME MEMBERS OF CFC?\n\nAny validly married couple can become members of CFC. Although a Catholic movement/organization, CFC remains OPEN to having non-validly married Catholic couple as well as non-Catholic Christians as members. CFC draws its membership from all sectors of society, young and old, rich and poor, etc. CFC transcends all cultural, economic, educational, social and other distinctions.\n\nRussell and Remy Acierto\n\nChapter Leaders\n\n(650) 270-8161\n\nrussellacierto@norcalcfc.com\n\nremyacierto@norcalcfc.com"
