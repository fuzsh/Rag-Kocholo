        "text": "Saint Bernard had more visibility, eloquence, and influence in his church and country than anyone of his day. The more he withdrew from secular affairs, the more kings, popes and bishops sought him. He was loved, hated, and the man of the twelfth century.\n\nBernard of Clairvaux is the eloquent and devotional doctor of the church. No other doctor or saint influenced more of his own family, friends, and relatives to join him in the service of God in religion than this humble monk. His charisma and holiness made him most noticeable and in demand by both church and country.\n\nThis holy priest and abbot efforts in the Crusades were a dismal failure from one aspect to make it known that might never makes right. His dedication especially to the Mother of God, St Mary, are well known and he is considered the last of the Fathers of the Church and a great Marian Doctor.\n\nSt. Bernard, 1091-1153. Devotional and Eloquent Doctor, Feast Aug 20th.\n\nThe illustrative St Bernard of Clairvaux was seen and heard more in the church and the world during his time on earth than anyone. He was sought for advice and favors by the high and the mighty to the common laborers and the poor during his lifetime. “Bernard was always writing letters castigating bishops, kings, and sometimes even the Pope”. Pope Eugenius commanded him to preach the Second Crusade and the origin and summary of the Crusades can be seen in the link below.\n\nhttp://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04543c.htm#I\n\nHe was the founder of many monasteries and their revivals. Imagine that before his death, the Benedictine Religious Order, to whom he belonged, had spread to one hundred and sixty monasteries across Europe. That was unprecedented in the history of the church and the world.\n\nGod used Bernard to light a spiritual fire. The Almighty has demonstrated throughout history that sincere prayer, dedication and devotion to noble causes will usher in amazing results even to this very day. Through this particular doctor of the church, God showed us that there was a divine power, force and gift behind Bernard. Great betterment for humankind can be achieved by each individual with divine influence and the power of God’s holiness, the Holy Spirit, as one’s Partner. God awaits us to do our part to effect similar and even greater results. With faith in the infinite One there is nothing that anyone can not achieve. All of us have special gifts for others to share according to the wisdom and providence of God.\n\nBy Bernard’s unique gift of eloquence, the church and its members benefited tremendously in the 12th century. He was for France and the church, the man of the century and the man who could do no wrong and would do everything wonderfully. Bernard’s eloquence was hardly his only talent. Yet for all his exceptional ability to articulate and motivate others toward God through his fluent and forceful words, his contributions in the Second Crusade were a military and dismal failure. This defeat was so devastating that it most likely hastened his death.\n\nBefore this crusade, his spiritual articulation was so overwhelming and moving that a great army was assembled. Although victory in the crusade was all but assured, it was nevertheless a colossal failure. This example is a vivid demonstration of might not making right even if endorsed by the Pope. It also shows that authentic and lasting victory is more in the spiritual gifts rather than the human gifts. It further shows that victory in the spiritual life is never achieved by violence toward others. However, violence or restraint used judiciously on oneself, such as fasting and the exercise of poverty, and under the guidance of the church, can sometimes be employed to keep in check our wayward human nature and its strong irregular tendencies.\n\nSt Bernard is also considered the Devotional Doctor because of the magnetic attraction many received due to his influence. He had great devotion to Jesus Christ crucified and his mother, Mary. This spiritual gift helped him bear all of his mistakes, failures and disappointments with charity and confidence. His famous prayer to Mary – the Memorare – is perhaps used more frequently than any other Marian prayer, beside the Hail Mary, than anywhere throughout the world. He inspired great devotion to the Mother of God. His writings on Mary have helped set the standard for the theology about Mary and those who study, write and focus on Mariology. Bernard spoke most eloquently about the things of God but none more eloquently than St Mary, the Mother of the Lord.\n\nThe following is a direct quote from Leonard Foley’s, OFM, book Saint of the Day (Lives and Lessons for Saints and Feast of the New Missal) which is listed in the doctoral sources/links. As St Bernard and the other doctors of the church remember Mary, so might we too. Listen in the following prayer, the rhythm, exquisite care, eloquence and sensitivity of Bernard’s words on Mary:\n\n“In dangers, in doubts, in difficulties, think of Mary, call upon Mary. Let not her name depart from your lips, never suffer it to leave your heart. And that you may more surely obtain the assistance of her prayer, neglect not to walk in her footsteps. With her for (your) guide, you shall never go astray; while invoking her, you shall never lose heart; So long as she is in your mind, you are safe from deception; while she holds your hand, you cannot fall; under her protection you have nothing to fear; if she walks before you, you shall not grow weary; if she shows you favor, you shall reach the goal.”\n\nTo have genuine devotion to God and Mary and to value the sacredness of life is to prize and treasure one’s Christian heritage and one’s cherished beliefs. We have lost or abandoned some sentimental substance of our Church’s inheritance. Implore Bernard to guide you toward God and your gallant heroes and heroines who lived unselfish and holy lives. Perhaps Catholics and Christians might seek Mary and their devotional side of faith. Perhaps novenas, rosaries, Stations of the Cross, prayers to the Infant Jesus, processions and lighting a candle will become more meaningful and rejuvenating through Bernard’s special intercession.\n\nThe following is a quote from Father Michael D Griffin, O.C.D,. taken from his book Saint Joseph – A Theological Introduction found in the doctoral sources/links listed on the sidebar.\n\n“Devotion to a particular saint always means that the saint in question is held in high personal regard. Not only do we have particular reverence for the saint, but we are spiritually fascinated by his life, works, and virtues. Somehow we are able spiritually to enter into his life: we seem to understand and grasp something of his unique spiritual genius. Not only that, but we want to be influenced by this saint, because the way he lived and practiced virtue on earth is viewed as a thing of compelling beauty.” -All of this paints a picture of St Bernard.\n\nBernard was considered the last of the Fathers of the Church. They were the ones who help set the foundation for the Catholic Church among whom where many doctors that preceded him. Bernard was a great defender of the faith, reformer of monastic life and a great healer of schism that was rife during his day. He was The man of the 12th Century. He was obviously a tremendous preacher who converted untold numbers. His popularity today might be compared to being on the cover page of every secular and religious magazine in the country. However, our humble monk always sought solitude and quiet. He always felt that he returned less of a spiritual person the more he talked or was away from his monastery.\n\nThe saint was a scripture scholar and a great theologian. His commentaries and books on the bible are most devotional and moving. Although he was called away from the world, he accepted his return to the world when obedience to the church required it. However, he also longed for aloneness with God in prayer in silence far from the distractions of the world. He saw no contradictions by God pulling him one direction one day and another direction the next.\n\nSt Bernard’s holiness and charisma was so impressive that more than thirty of his closest family members and relatives followed him when he entered the strict enclosure of the Cistercian monastery. Fr. Rengers’ book on the doctors, listed in the sources, tell us that his phenomenal recruitment effort may have been more attributed to Bernard’s saintly mother, Aleth (or Elizabeth) who had died immediately before he entered the Cistercian, than Bernard himself. His mother’s may have been the one responsible for his vocation as he originally had an inclination to serve God in the world rather than in the monastery.\n\nThe Cistercians are but one group of the Benedictines whose founder was St Benedict. The apparent dying community that he joined became revived. He obviously was very charismatic and he had immense zeal for the house of the Lord. He was hard on others but always more hard on himself trying to imitate the crucified Christ. This “mellifluous” doctor (so called because of his charming and sweet words from his inspired writings) was so hard on himself to the extent that he became ill. By that he learned more patience and understanding with others regarding suffering.\n\nAlthough the Abbot, Bernard, expressed himself about the things of God most eloquently to his fellow monks, he was a down-to-earth person who encouraged and assured his followers that they would find God more in the woods than in his words. Trees and stones, he felt, would teach that which one can never learn from master teachers.\n\nBernard’s Sermons on the Song of Songs reveal his spiritual feelings and expression. His writings, and all inspiring writings taken from the bible, will give one a foretaste of heaven and the enjoyment and taste of God’s inner world. God’s word imparts and enables one to relish one’s being as no other. God’s words, when couched and embellished by holy writers, describe divine love from a sensitive, sensual and sacred aspect. It can truly enamor, fascinate and motivate one to really want to give oneself to God more completely. Bernard’s words will set the embers of your heart ablaze. His phrases on divine love are warm, gentle and exciting. His expressions are sweet, soft and caressing. Bernard’s writings will give you a pair of wings to soar and experience God.\n\nSt Bernard beautifully encompasses the law of God into the love of God in his work “On Loving God”, taken from Abbot Dom John Eudes in one his many posted homilies on the Net. This particular homily is dated on March 14th, 2007 listed on his below website:\n\n——————————————–Abbot Dom John Eudes———————————-\n\nThe immaculate law of God, then, is charity … It is called law either because He lives by it or because no one possesses it except by His gift. Nor is it absurd that I say God lives by law since I say that law is nothing else than charity. For what preserves that supreme and ineffable unity in that supreme and blessed Trinity save charity? Charity then is a law and it is the law of the Lord that in a manner confines the Trinity in unity and binds it together in the bond of peace. (De diligendo Deo xii.35, PL 182:996).\n\nThrough the holy exercise and practice of spiritual reading, respect for life and one’s inner convictions, life will become more of a tremendous attraction. You will find yourself becoming more interested in the things of God. The sites, sounds and things of God will take on new meaning and importance. Perhaps God will draw you more to places and persons that reflect the holy. Maybe pilgrimages to the Holy Land or visits to mosques, temples, churches or monasteries will take on new meaning.\n\nGod can use a book, a lover, a sickness or anything to draw us to the Deity. The Spirit can reach into the joints, imaginations and hearts of each soul uniquely when it pleases God. Sometimes we seek God ardently but often we lose our first fervor. However, God is always seeking to touch and move us and to be our Guide and instruct us according to holy providence. The more we earnestly beg and beseech God, the more God hears us and reveals the divine presence mysteriously and devotionally within our soul. The more we pray, the more the Spirit prays with us to cooperate with God’s plan and purpose not only for ourselves but for others too. Gifts are always for sharing with all creations and especially God’s creatures. It does not take a doctor of the church to convert us. The Almighty can use the most insignificant, the most deplorable or the most blessed to achieve divine results.\n\nDuring this past decade, God has used his masterpiece, Mary, to impregnate us with God’s spiritual seed exactly as the Spirit planted the seed of his Son in the womb of Mary. The Creator wants to implode in us that we might know, understand, and appreciate new depths and discover more about the divine nature. God’s awareness and presence are everywhere. Now and then God breaks in on us and touches us in indescribable manners. Often, divine impressions and imprints are fleeting and sometime they remain. God asks that we remain faithful to all divine gifts. The more we are attuned to the needs of our souls with ample supply of prayer, reflection, and silence as it pertains to our lifestyle, the more the Holy One will invade our awareness with love, grace and the divine indwelling. Our church also assures us that within each person are our guardian angels. He is within, without and all about. The providence of God encompasses all holy spirits and angels.\n\nEarly monasticism was most instrumental in the development of angel devotion. St Bernard greatly favored advocating this type of devotion. He explained in his writings that our guarding angels are not only for children but all God’s creatures-young or old. Our angel represents us to God each instance of our creation and all angels encourage us to live in the presence of God in faith as they do in God’s actual presence. The bible reminds us of this and Jesus confirmed that our angels always behold our Father’s face. As we endeavor to do God’s will, let us pray for more devotion to serve God as the angels.\n\nAs human beings we realize that sin, temptation and vice surround us daily. Most can’t live in monasteries. We are called to act as angels though we know from human experience we are probably going to sin in some form right up to the time of our death unless we are protected by God’s benevolent love which is never withdrawn or kept back.\n\nBernard’s writing reminds us that God’s church offers us sacraments to lessen our inclination to sins or protect us from no sins at all. God’s life dwells in us through the sacraments and offers us an antidote and healing power that empowers us to do the impossible as Bernard did. Sin grieves the Holy Spirit. Charity unifies us with the Holy Spirit.\n\nGod’s love is outrageous and extravagant especially when we make time for prayer. Holy people are not naive to sin. Many, if not most, are plagued with trials and temptations frequently. Sin and mistakes keep us humble and dependent on God. Grace and love lift us upward to God confidently to dare and achieve all things.\n\nThe church is steeped in a wide variety of devotions to fit all. Merely lighting a devotional candle at home or church can enkindle fervor and ardor in one’s heart and mind. Devotions can be physical or interior acts. They can be expressed in outward actions such as soup kitchen support, prison or mental-institutional visits. Other types include group discussions on good literature, catechetical studies and bible-meetings. The Spirit of God guides all. Our guardian angels will lead us and communicate with us if we request and beseech this watchful companion. Devotion to human beings done in the spirit of charity can be as ennobling and enriching as devotion to the Blessed Sacrament. Corporal and Spiritual Works of Mercy enable us to act kind, compassionate and forgiving to others. It also allows us to see God in all creatures especially those who are in most need of God’s mercy.\n\nDevotion need not be associated with going to church. Everything is sacred. Obviously, some are more sacred. Discovering God’s place for us requires discretion and wisdom. Spiritual reading is non-replaceable devotion and helps us to be united to God. The church abounds in devotional possibilities. To name a few would include: the twelve shepherds, the fourteen holy helpers, the lives of the saints, the martyrs, and our heroes and heroines of war and life. Who can forget our gallant trailblazers who helped eliminated injustices, slavery, bad laws, child abuses and inequalities in our laws and statues through wise leadership and government? Who can fail to remember those who died, marched and stood up for civil rights and liberties?\n\nWe might also read about explorers like Christopher Columbus. Historical figures like Harriet Tubman, who gave new freedom and life to others through the “Underground Railroad”, is a fascinating figure we admired. We seek more knowledge and exploration about her and others like her. True devotion is knowing more and discovering how to venture out helping the less unfortunate even though it may imply risks and dangers.\n\nA new and exciting spiritual reading is Saintly Men of Modern Times , published by Our Sunday Visitor in 2003 and written by Joan Carroll Cruz, author of the best seller Relics, The Incorruptibles, and Secular Saints. Joan’s newer book with be followed by Saintly Women of Modern Times and Saintly Children and Teens of Modern Times. Our Sunday Visitor’s link is listed below and in the doctoral sources/links.\n\nHome\n\nSt Bernard, despite his failures and weaknesses, can help us in true devotion to Mary, acting virtuous and reducing our many anxieties. We should seek his tremendous counsels and wisdom. His example was heroic, faithful and deeply trusting in God and in His mother.\n\nHis harshness toward the Jews is well known but his charity covered a multitude of sins. This last sentence I wrote a while back and I’d like to make a retraction thanks to Sister Marianne who pointed out some information recently 8/19/07 and it it pointed out in the Encyclopedia Judaica that has an entry about him. It mentions his intervention on behalf of the Jews during their persecution in the Rhineland. If I remember correctly, St Bernard’s intervention is dealt with in some detail in the book Kirche und Synagogue, editors Karl-Heinrich Rengstorff and S. von Kortzfleisch. It gives [in full?] the text of his letter defending them (with an argument at the expense of the Muslim population).\n\n“From our vantage point, the crusades were a terrible mistake from the outset, but Bernard saw a threat to Christendom that needed to be stopped.”\n\nThe Cistercians, and all genuine contemplatives, are consecrated and dedicated women and men who are called to total surrender and abandonment to the divine good pleasure. They generally stay in one monastery for their entire life. These monks and many consecrated Christians live in separate locations and lead a life of labor, prayer and charity. They do not seek to be known. Their lives are hidden in God as Jesus’ life for the first thirty years of his human life. Relatively few people know about these truly holy people. They aim to be like Jesus more by their example than their words or works.\n\nBernard would have remained unknown if left up to him. But it wasn’t. It was God’s gifts manifested in him and the Holy Spirit that thrusted him into the public domain more than he wanted. But he was obedient to his superiors.\n\nOther religious Orders, such as the Dominicans and the Jesuits, are more known because they are not as hidden. The Trappists have had only a relative few writers who highlighted their history and perhaps St Bernard is the most known from the old tradition. New Fathers and Sister of the Strict Observance, OCSO, such as Pennington, Raymond, Merton, Raphael, Pollard and Keating and others are gifted and talented writers who proclaimed the word of God in an inspiring manner. These above writers have given us holy insights, ideas and inspiration to change ourselves and the world about us through God’s grace.\n\nPerhaps the most prolific and gifted writer and poet, in my opinion, is Merton. His book, The Sign of Jonah that was well read in 1950’s, opened spiritual vistas for many. See a Merton link below.\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/clcing/11xx.html\n\nAs Jesus Christ, Trappists, for the most part, live the words of God more than by writing about it. Those who follow God’s call to this way of life give up a lot but God blesses them immensely for themselves and all humankind. No one will ever know in our lifetime how much they contribute to holding our fragile world together by their prayerful lives, sacrifices and union with their Savior.\n\nThe church’s contemplatives are the spiritual glue and sinews that hold the mystical body of Christ together. Cistercians or Trappists as they are more popularly known are but one of many groups. The men number worldwide about 2,500 according the 1998 Catholic Almanac. The Benedictines number around 9,000. I do not have the figure for the women but typically they are more.\n\nThe church is extraordinarily rich with solitary and isolated monks. Some live apart from others and others, which include men and women, live chastely together. God invites all to assist others by the Almighty’s special call. It is only by God’s grace and our cooperation through prayer and sincerity that we will rediscover where the Spirit wants us to be. Only by the Holy Spirit will the genuine, blissful state of gazing on God, even in this life below, through faith, be given to us. That’s the art of contemplation.\n\nContemplation need not necessarily be associated with religion or the church. The Spirit of God fills, floods, and bathes all creation with divine light. More people fulfill their vocations by using monasteries and secluded settings as a place to discover God anew and later emit that light to those where they live and work. We are often called apart, temporarily, for 1 day or 20 years to be inundated with God’s light. Many have been religious, monks, nuns and priests then move on to fulfill their mission in other places. They serve and contribute to others in their neighborhoods, communities and businesses.\n\nThere are millions who promote fruits of contemplation with peacemaking, with nonviolence-attitudes and with conflict resolution themes. One in particular is Colman McCarthy, a former Trappist and syndicated writer for the Washington Post newspaper for many years. His articles in the Post, written over 20 years ago, from his book entitled, Thinkers and their Thoughts, highlighted individuals who made a significant contribution. For example: Benedict influenced Western Culture tremendously. Flannery O’Connor and her craft, Charles de Foucauld and his service to the desert poor are but few that Colman has included in his book. He is also the founder of Center for Teaching Peace.\n\nAnother peacemaking author and organizational leader includes M. Scott Peck and founder of the Foundation for Community Encouragement. His book The Road Less Traveled is the world’s best seller. It was on the NY Times list for over a decade. Dr. Peck has written over 10 other books on the subjects of a new psychology of love, traditional values and spiritual growth. He died in 2005 and millions have benefitted from his great insights that his books conveyed about finding the real meaning in life and living life with passion and conviction.\n\nContemplation also means concentrating and reflecting. Students are contemplatives. Directing all one’s energies on one’s duties and responsibilities is most pleasing to God. Aiming to be and do one’s best in one’s work thrills God. Not to give up or give in to temptation, trials and test of life, despite failures, because we are human, is to remain steadfast in one’s intention to do good and pleases God. God who sees all our struggles and will reward each according to his infinite wisdom.\n\nThe morning-offering prayer is a grand and noble devotion. Remember that contemplation is a habit of spiritual focusing as a form of private devotion. Saying a prayer to the church’s devotional doctor, St Bernard, will enable you to be guided by one of the masters. Bernard found God in private and public places and all of God’s holy creation. Despite all of his setbacks, sins and failures, he never gave up and trusted in God’s mother to pull him through hard times. We should too.\n\nSt Bernard of Clairvaux is certainly an excellent model for increase vocations for the church. The Catholic Church is struggling today with vocational strategies, responses, recruiting and cultural factors. The Bishops of the United States committee on vocations reported that from the year 1950-2000 the total Catholic population more than doubled while the total number of priests increased by only six percent. However, the bishops have a sense of hopefulness and confidence concerning meeting pastoral needs in light of fewer priests.\n\nSt Bernard is a grand model for assisting those to find God’s way in and out of the monastic calling and any calling in the world. Please pray for us, most eloquent and devotional doctor, and aid us in our allegiance to our holy Queen, St Mary.\n\nListed in the below link under Saint Isidore are many links and information about the subject of vocations.\n\nSt. Isidore 4/4\n\nBefore mentioning the last devotional aspect of St Bernard, I would like to acknowledge Cecilia McGowan whose quotes I have used and who wrote about St Bernard beautifully and inspiringly in Desert Call a quarterly, that is listed in the doctoral sources/links listed on the homepage.\n\nWe might remember as we pray with Bernard of Clairvaux, who lived in France, that Clairvaux means valley of light. God used divine light to touch others. God has used Our Lady who appeared in Paris, France, and at other sites in France that included: Lourdes, LaSalette, Pontmain, Laus, Rue du Bac, and others that have met church approval. Mary’s apparitions always touch us with light and inspiration exactly according to the gospel messages. Bernard wants us to remember that this holy Woman is the chosen one who has given us the “Light of the World.”\n\nRengers’ book, already mentioned, has given more subtitles to St Bernard than any other doctor including “Oracle of the Twelfth Century”, “Thaumaturgus (miracle-worker) of the West”, “Arbiter of Christendom” and more. Bernard had a charming personality and perhaps being cured by the Blessed Virgin encouraged him to show great mercy and concern toward all. “He seemed to be able to accept a candidate with the worst possible background and yet fashion him into a good monk. Once he saved a criminal from the hangman and took him to the novitiate” – Christopher Rengers.\n\nOne report is that the numbers of miracles he worked and recorded in his lifetime exceeded any other doctor or saints ever. One most notable generosity of Bernard was that in a time of famine, his monastery of Clairvaux gave out free meals. This amounted to 3,000 individuals. His kindness knew no bounds and his example spurred others to holiness. A former monk of Clairvaux was elected Pope as Eugene III.\n\nDespite his outward help, Bernard was primarily a man of silence, prayer and devotion. His devotion included the Sacred Heart, the Holy Name, the Blessed Virgin, St Joseph and the Guardian Angels. Father Christopher Rengers notes that many Religious Orders and doctors including Sts John of the Cross, Francis de Sales and Alphonsus Liguori read St Bernard extensively. One of Bernard classic is Canticle of Canticles is a great place to start."
