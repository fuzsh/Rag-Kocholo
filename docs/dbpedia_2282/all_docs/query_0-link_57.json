        "text": "Twenty minutes of spiritual reading.\n\nTopic: the spirit of the world is contrary to the spirit of God.\n\nExamination of conscience.\n\nOffering of a small sacrifice to God or some form of personal mortification in reparation for past sins with the intention of countering self-will and practicing purity of heart.\n\nPray a decade of the rosary or a full five decades.\n\nRecite the canticle of Our Lady, the Magnificat.\n\nPart I: Twelve Days\n\nEmptying Ourselves of the Spirit of the World\n\n\"If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before you.\" John 15:18\n\nThe spirit of the world is contrary to the spirit of Our Lord Jesus Christ. The spirit of the world consists essentially in the denial of God as creator and supreme ruler. As creator, the triune God created a universe subject to laws, and as supreme ruler He enforces these laws—laws which promote our well-being and eternal good.\n\nThe denial of God as creator and supreme ruler is mainly manifested in disobedience, rebellion and sin. This attitude seeks to create a world in which humans—rather than God—make the rules.\n\nSin: Its Spirit, Its Works and Its “Pomps”\n\nThe spirit of sin is manifested in the lust of the eyes, and the unlawful desire and pursuit of the pleasures of the flesh; in the pride of possessions and positions; in disobedience to God’s laws; and in the abuse of created things. The works of sin are all that is produced by disobedience to the Ten Commandments, works that darken the mind, produce error, and seduce, corrupt and weaken the will. The “pomps” of sin are the glamour, glitter and charm, which the devil attaches to persons, places and things to render sin alluring, attractive and seductive.\n\nPractices during the initial twelve days:\n\nPray the Veni Creator Spiritus and the Ave Maris Stella daily.\n\nRecommended reading:\n\nThe Holy Scriptures, The Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis, The Sinner’s Guide by Luiz de Granada, The Spiritual Combat by Dom Lorenzo Scupoli, Characters of the Passion by Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen.\n\nPart II: Week 1\n\nKnowledge of Self\n\n\"You have made us for Yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in You.\"\n\n— Saint Augustine\n\nDuring the first week, Saint Louis de Montfort recommends that we employ our prayer and pious actions in asking for knowledge of self. Knowledge of self is essential for knowledge of God.\n\nNarcissism vs. Low Self-Esteem: Both Distance Us from God\n\nThough we are excellent creatures, made to the image and likeness of God Himself, in our fallen state after original sin, we easily take ownership of what was freely given to us: life, senses, talents, appearance, possessions and positions—forgetting their source: God.\n\nOr, on the other extreme, usually because of lack of affirmation or direct abuse, we minimize our true worth, which keeps us from believing that we are immensely loved, and thus trusting in God.\n\nWhere the narcissist lacks humility, and tends to think of himself or herself as the ultimate gift to others, the self-doubter misunderstands humility, often compromises his or her personal dignity, and only feels useful when used.\n\nThere can also be a combination of both problems.\n\nReflecting on our contingency and shortcomings helps us to know who we are not. Only when we cease to be blinded by our own “greatness” and start to fall out of love with “self,” do we get a glimpse of Who God is, and begin to fall in love with Eternal Good.\n\nTrue self-esteem, the objective appreciation of who we are as creatures and heirs to heaven, counters both self-adoring narcissism and low self-esteem. Both attitudes keep us from seeking our true good and happiness in God, Who is supreme creator, yes, but also a father who has made us heirs to His kingdom—provided we want it.\n\nPractices to Help Counter Both Attitudes\n\nFor a reality check to the narcissist in us, Saint Louis recommends that we reflect on the fact that, as inheritors of the original sin of Adam and Eve, mankind is naturally inclined to evil. In the “Third Truth” of Part I, Chapter 2, the Saint demonstrates how we are vain and self-centered as peacocks, lazy as snails, groveling as toads, envious as serpents, gluttonous as hogs, and angry as tigers. Or we may choose to reflect on the three considerations of Saint Bernard: that we were made from the slime of the earth, the corruptibility and vulnerability of our present state, and our ultimate end as food of worms.\n\nFor low self-esteem and self-doubt, there is nothing better than to reflect on the Crucified, our God giving His life to the last drop of His blood for each of us, and to reflect on His immaculate mother offering Him up for us—indeed, we are that expensive.\n\nThere is also nothing more eye-opening and healing than spending time with the Eucharistic Lord in adoration, and developing a personal relationship with Him. Adoration has been called “divine radiation therapy.”\n\nUltimately, in all these reflections, the essential ingredient is honesty: to look at ourselves as we are, and to seek true conversion, and true healing.\n\nSaint Louis says we should pray to the Holy Ghost to enlighten us, and recommends the ejaculations: \"Lord, that I may know Thee!\" or \"Come Holy Ghost.\" Another good short prayer: \"Lord, who am I, and Who art Thou?\" Another: \"Jesus, Mary, I trust in Thee.\"\n\nPractices for Week 1:\n\nPray the Veni Creator Spiritus, the Ave Maris Stella and the Litany of the Holy Ghost daily.\n\nRecommended reading:\n\nThe Sacred Scriptures, The Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis, The Sinners Guide by Luiz de Granada, The Book of Confidence by Fr. Thomas de Saint-Laurent, Abandonment to Divine Providence, by Jean-Pierre de Caussade, Introduction to the Devout Life by Saint Francis de Sales, Fire Within by Fr. Thomas Dubay.\n\nPart III: Week 2\n\nKnowledge of Mary Most Holy\n\n\"Mary is the sanctuary and the repose of the Holy Trinity, where God dwells more magnificently and more divinely than any other place in the universe…\"\n\n— Saint Louis de Montfort\n\nThe main goal of Saint Louis de Montfort’s True Devotion is to seek union with Jesus through Mary.\n\nTherefore, during the second week of preparation for Total Consecration, Saint Louis directs us to apply all our prayers and works seeking to know the Blessed Virgin Mary, and for this he recommends reflecting on what he has written about Our Lady in this book, all the while invoking the Holy Ghost for knowledge of she who is His spouse. As the Saint says, “…the more He (the Holy Ghost) finds Mary, His dear and indissoluble Spouse, in any soul, the more active and mighty He becomes in producing Jesus Christ in that soul, and that soul in Jesus Christ.”\n\nSaint Louis calls Our Lady the “tabernacle of God.” Indeed, she is the true ark of the New Covenant. The first ark held the tablets of the law, the second ark held God Himself.\n\nSaint Augustine says that the world was unworthy to receive the Son of God directly from the Father’s hands. He was given through Mary so that the world could receive Him through her.\n\nWe should make acts of love and thanksgiving toward this creature, immaculate, as befitting the living tabernacle of the True God, free from the original sin that mars us, perfect in her correspondence to God’s grace and found worthy to become the mother of the Redeemer.\n\n“She is His (Jesus’) mysterious canal; she is His aqueduct, through which He makes His mercies flow gently and abundantly,” writes Saint Louis.\n\nIn Cana, at Mary’s request to alleviate a mere hosting difficulty, Jesus works a stupendous miracle. Noticing that their hosts are out of wine, Our Lady whispers her concern to her Son, who replies that in His eternal will the time is not yet for miracles. But in her trust and union with Him she knows that in His Heart He has said “yes” to her. And she says to the attendants, “Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye.” (John 2:5)\n\nThis is her role with Him on our behalf—powerful intercession and sure directive for our lives: “Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye.” She points the way to His Heart, and shows us child-like trust in a God deeply interested even in the details of our lives. This is the faith that works miracles.\n\nWe should gratefully think of her as our “Sorrowful Mother,” helping to give “birth” to each of us spiritually during the frightful labor of offering her Son for our salvation. We should think of her, amazing in the innocence, fortitude and generosity that allowed her to stand at that awful scaffold offering her perfect Son to the Father as the lamb without blemish for our blemishes.\n\nPractices for Week 2:\n\nPray the Litany of the Holy Ghost (to which may be added the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary), the Ave Maris Stella and five decades of the Holy Rosary daily.\n\nRecommended reading:\n\nThe Secret of the Rosary by Saint Louis Grignion de Montfort, The Glories of Mary by Saint Alphonsus de Liguori, Fatima, a Message More Urgent Than Ever by Luiz Sergio Solimeo, The Wonder of Guadalupe by Francis Johnston, Saint Bernadette Soubirous by Abbé François Trochu.\n\nPart IV: Week 3\n\nKnowledge of Our Lord Jesus Christ\n\n\"By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us, because God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we may live by Him.\" 1 John 4:9\n\nIn the third week, Saint Louis calls us to apply ourselves to the knowledge of Our Lord Jesus Christ. He recommends that we meditate upon the biblical prefiguring of our Lord’s submission to His Blessed Mother in the actions of Jacob and Rebecca. To assist us in the consideration of this mystery, he explains the history of Esau and Jacob as given in chapter 27 of the Book of Genesis and draws out lessons from which we may take spiritual profit. To these considerations the Saint adds the maternal obligations our Blessed Lady incurs on our behalf through the practice of holy slavery and reemphasizes its ultimate aim in the First Truth: “If, then, we establish the solid devotion to our Blessed Lady, it is only to establish more perfectly the devotion to Jesus Christ, and to put forward an easy and secure means for finding Jesus Christ.” The contemplation of the Incarnate Word’s example in this manner must of necessity bear fruit. Total Consecration to Jesus through Mary is the first and the most perfect of the “external practices” encouraged by Saint Louis de Montfort.\n\nSaint Louis says that if we want to know the mother we must know the Son, for she is the worthy Mother of God. For Our Lord Jesus Christ, true God and true man, is the second person of the Holy Trinity, a divine person with two natures: divine and human.\n\nIn an incomprehensible act of love, the second person of the Holy Trinity took on a human nature so as to be able to atone to His Father for the original sin of Adam and Eve and for the sins of humanity. No man, no matter how holy, could have bridged the gap created between God and man by sin. Yet it was only right that humanity atone for the offense. Since only God could sufficiently atone to God, the divine “solution” was a God made man so that as an integral part of humanity, Jesus Christ—God and man—could offer a just return to God.\n\nAnd here, of course, before this unfathomable divine solution, we go mute and adore this God-made-man before whom “every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth.” (Philippians 2:10)\n\nFor this period Saint Louis recommends saying the prayer of Saint Augustine in Part I of the Treatise on True Devotion (page 29), and to say many times a day: “Lord, that I may know Thee!” or “Lord, that I might see Who Thou art!”\n\nPractices for Week 3:\n\nPray the Veni Creator Spiritus, the Ave Maris Stella, and the Litany of the Most Holy Name of Jesus daily.\n\nRecommended reading:\n\nThe Sacred Scriptures, The Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis, Christ the Life of the Soul by Dom Columba Marmion, Christ in His Mysteries by Dom Columba Marmion.\n\nInstructions for the day of Total Consecration\n\nAt the end of the thirty-three days, Saint Louis entreats us to go to Confession and to receive Holy Communion with the intention of giving ourselves to Jesus Christ in the quality of slaves of love through the hands of Mary. After Holy Communion, which may be made according to the method recommended by the Saint, we should recite the formula of Consecration. This formula should either be handwritten or printed, but available to be signed as a contract.\n\nSaint Louis also recommends that on the day of Consecration, some offering be made as a tribute to Jesus Christ and Our Blessed Lady, either as a penance for our past unfaithfulness to the vows of our Baptism, or as a testimony of our allegiance to Jesus and Mary as Our Lord and Lady. This offering could take the form of a fast, a personal mortification, a money offering or even a candle, provided it be according to the capacity and means of each, a sincere gift. If a pin is all we can give, Our Lord, Who looks only to the heart’s intention, will accept it kindly.\n\nAt least once a year, on the anniversary of our Total Consecration, we should renew the same consecration, if possible, observing the same practices during the three weeks.\n\nSaint Louis also recommends that once a month, or even once a day, we renew our consecration by saying the words: “I am all Thine, and all I have belongs to Thee, O my sweet Jesus, by Mary Thy holy Mother.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD AND PRINT THIS CONSECRATION\n\nPrayers Recommended by Saint Louis de Montfort\n\nMAGNIFICAT\n\nMy soul doth magnify the Lord.\n\nAnd my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.\n\nBecause He hath regarded the humility of His handmaid;\n\nfor behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.\n\nBecause He that is mighty hath done great things to me;\n\nand holy is His name.\n\nAnd His mercy is from generation to generations, to them that fear Him.\n\nHe hath showed might in His arm;\n\nHe hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.\n\nHe hath put down the mighty from their seat;\n\nand hath exalted the humble.\n\nHe hath filled the hungry with good things;\n\nand the rich he hath sent empty away.\n\nHe hath received Israel His servant, being mindful of His mercy.\n\nAs He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever. Amen\n\nGlory be....\n\nVeni Creator Spiritus\n\nCome, O Creator Spirit blest!\n\nAnd in our souls take up thy rest;\n\nCome with Thy grace and heavenly aid,\n\nTo fill the hearts which Thou hast made.\n\nGreat Paraclete!

Who livest and reignest world without end. Amen\n\nMemorare by St. Bernard\n\nRemember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thy intercession was left unaided. Inspired with this confidence, I fly to thee, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother; to thee do I come; before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer me. Amen\n\nConsecration of Ourselves to Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Wisdom, by the Hands of Mary\n\nO Eternal and Incarnate Wisdom! O sweetest and most Adorable Jesus! True God and True Man, only Son of the Eternal Father, and of Mary always Virgin! I adore Thee profoundly in the bosom and splendors of Thy Father during eternity; and I adore Thee also in the Virginal bosom of Mary, Thy most worthy Mother, in the time of Thine Incarnation.\n\nI give Thee thanks for that Thou hast annihilated Thyself, in taking the form of a slave, in order to rescue me from the cruel slavery of the devil. I praise and glorify Thee for that Thou hast been pleased to submit Thyself to Mary, Thy holy Mother, in all things, in order to make me Thy faithful slave through her. But, alas! ungrateful and faithless as I have been, I have not kept the promises which I made so solemnly to Thee in my Baptism; I have not fulfilled my obligations; I do not deserve to be called Thy son, nor yet Thy slave; and as there is nothing in me which does not merit Thine anger and Thy repulse, I dare no more come by myself before Thy Most Holy and August Majesty. It is on this account that I have recourse to the intercession of Thy most holy Mother, whom Thou hast given me for a mediatrix with Thee. It is by her means that I hope to obtain of Thee contrition, and the pardon of my sins, the acquisition and the preservation of wisdom. I salute thee, then, O immaculate Mary, living tabernacle of the Divinity, where the Eternal Wisdom willed to be hidden, and to be adored by Angels and by men. I hail thee, O Queen of heaven and earth, to whose empire everything is subject which is under God.\n\nI salute thee, O sure refuge of sinners, whose mercy fails to no one. Hear the desires which I have of the Divine Wisdom; and for that end, receive the vows and offerings which my lowness presents to thee. I, (name), a faithless sinner, I renew and ratify to-day in thy hands the vows of my Baptism; I renounce forever Satan, his pomps and works; and I give myself entirely to Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Wisdom, to carry my cross after Him all the days of my life, and to be more faithful to Him than I have ever been before.\n\nIn the presence of all the heavenly court I choose thee this day for my Mother and Mistress. I deliver and consecrate to thee, as thy slave, my body and soul, my goods, both interior and exterior, and even the value of all my good actions, past, present, and future; leaving to you the entire and full right of disposing of me, and all that belongs to me, without exception, according to thy good pleasure, to the greatest glory of God, in time and in eternity.\n\nReceive, O benignant Virgin, this little offering of my slavery, in the honor of, and in union with, that subjection which the Eternal Wisdom deigned to have to thy Maternity, in homage to the power which both of you have over this little worm and miserable sinner, and in thanksgiving for the privileges with which the Holy Trinity hath favored thee. I protest that I wish henceforth, as thy true slave, to seek thy honor and to obey thee in all things.\n\nO admirable Mother, present me to thy dear Son as His eternal slave, so that as He hath redeemed me by thee, by thee He may receive me.\n\nO Mother of mercy, get me the grace to obtain the true Wisdom of God; and for that end put me in the number of those whom thou lovest, whom thou teachest, whom thou conductest, and whom thou nourishest and protectest, as thy children and thy slaves.\n\nO faithful Virgin, make me in all things so perfect a disciple, imitator, and slave of the Incarnate Wisdom, Jesus Christ thy Son, that I may attain, by thy intercession, and by thy example, to the fullness of His age on earth, and of His glory in the heavens. Amen"
