        "text": "Welcome to the website of Corpus Christi - St. Bernard Parish (a Roman Catholic faith community) in the 'Garden City' of Newton. Our parish, living and thriving here on the western edge of our city, provides much to our parishioners and those outside of that description - all by the grace and life of God our Father and in the name of His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nOur beautiful and reverent celebrations of the Mass on Sunday are made more so by the faithful and active participation of all present. The Mass's daily and Sunday celebrations provide an oasis of grace and faith for many parishioners and those who visit. Eucharistic Adoration offers a moment of silence with the Lord and enables us to hear the voice of our Shepherd. Through the Eucharist, we can accomplish the other works of service and mercy that so define our Catholic tradition.\n\nEach day, through the grace of Christ, we try to build this holy place of Corpus Christi-St. Bernard into a monument of what it means to be prayerfully and generously worthy of the promises of Christ-all in the middle of a public square, often alive with voices calling folks elsewhere. As you navigate these pages, please know that our parish community welcomes and prays for you.\n\nBlessings,\n\nFr. Dan O'Connell\n\nPastor\n\n@FrDanOConnell\n\nSchool is right around the corner!\n\nThe families at Julieâ€™s Family Learning Program could use help with back-to-school supplies for the upcoming year.\n\nDonations can be dropped off at Allen Place on Saturday, August 17th & 24th between 3:30-5:15pm and Sunday, August 18th & 25th between 7:30-11:30am.\n\nItems needed include: backpacks, 3-ring binders, paper, glue sticks, calculators, crayons, safety scissors, face masks, and travel umbrellas.\n\nA full list of school supplies can be found in our parish bulletin.\n\nThe Nineteenth Sunday Of Ordinary Time\n\nThis week, we focus on our faith and God's Divine Providence. Although he wishes to live no longer, the prophet Elijah returns to the zeal of living because of God's provision and the strength derived from divine support. In the Gospel, Jesus declares Himself as the \"Bread of Life,\" explaining that believing in Him and partaking of Him spiritually will lead to everlasting life; when we trust in God's provision, living a life of love and forgiveness, there is little we can't do!"
