        "text": "Mariology, in Christian, especially Roman Catholic, theology, the study of doctrines concerning Mary, the mother of Jesus; the term also refers to the content of these doctrines.\n\nThe primary methodological problem of Mariology lies in the very limited mention of Mary made in the New Testament and in the relative, although not complete, silence about Mary in the early church. Although Mary is mentioned in some early apocryphal (noncanonical) writings and baptismal creeds, theological disputes were the most significant factor in bringing Mary to theological prominence. At various times it was denied both that Jesus was authentically human and that he was fully divine. To the first charge, the assertion that he had a human mother was considered a convincing refutation. With regard to the second, the affirmation by the Council of Ephesus (431) that Mary was Theotokos (Greek: “God-Bearer”) became the principle upon which devotion to Mary in the East has primarily rested. In both Eastern and Western liturgical traditions, various feast days in her honour were established. These include the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God (January 1), the Feast of the Annunciation (March 25), the Feast of the Assumption of Mary (August 15), the Presentation of the Virgin Mary (November 21), and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (December 8), among others.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nChristianity Quiz\n\nThe tradition that she remained a virgin though she gave birth to Jesus was generally accepted in the early church. A further appreciation of her holiness led to the doctrine that she was so favoured by God’s grace that she could not have sinned and, in the view of some theologians, that she was even free from the effect of the disobedience of Adam. The latter doctrine, known as the Immaculate Conception, was formally proclaimed a matter of Roman Catholic belief by Pope Pius IX in 1854. The association of Mary in the work of Jesus developed into the view of Mary as everyone’s spiritual mother and as co-redemptrix—i.e., the partner with Jesus in the redemption of human beings. Her role in redemption was extended to her intercession in heaven and to the application of Christ’s merits to individual persons. The doctrine that after death Mary’s body was assumed into heaven was proclaimed by Pope Pius XII in 1950; the feast commemorating her dormition, or falling asleep, first originated in the Byzantine Empire.\n\nPost-Reformation Roman Catholic Mariology has generally been characterized by a sensitivity to Protestant criticisms. Popular piety was reflected in the establishment of lay groups and communities of priests or nuns devoted to Mary, such as the Oblates of Mary Immaculate (1816) and the Society of Mary (1817). A number of Marian apparitions were reported and approved, including Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Fátima, and shrines were built at Lourdes, France, and Fátima, Portugal, and other sites where Mary was said to have appeared. In the 20th century the teachings of several successive popes encouraged numerous pilgrimages in her honour and congresses devoted to her.\n\nOne of the most popular Marian devotions in Roman Catholicism is the Rosary of the Blessed Virgin, the prayers of which are recited with the aid of a chaplet, or rosary, and centre on the Hail Mary. Its origin is not certain, though it has been associated with St. Dominic, founder of the Dominican order in the early 13th century. It reached its definitive form in the 15th century through the preaching of the Dominican Alan de la Roche and his associates, who organized Rosary Confraternities at Douai in France and at Cologne. In 1520 Pope Leo X gave the rosary official approbation, and it has been repeatedly commended by the Roman Catholic Church."
