Ed has written for the trade press since 1986 and has worked on more than 140 books. Ed has worked on many other titles for Wiley, too, including Windows Server 2008 For Dummies, XML For Dummies, and Networking with NetWare For Dummies. Lately, heâs worked on various For Dummies custom titles, includ- ing booklets on clustered computing, mobile backhaul, XBRL Markup, and carrier Ethernet. Ed blogs, provides expert Q&A, and writes for several TechTarget.com Web sites, such as SearchNetworking.com and SearchWindows.com. He also writes for ITExpertVoice, Tomâs Hardware, Tomâs Guide, and more. When heâs not busy working, Ed likes to travel, shoot pool, and spend time with his family. He also loves to spend time in the kitchen cooking like mad, or sous- cheffinâ for his cuisine-crazy wife, Dina. Contact Ed by e-mail at etittel@ yahoo.com. Jeff Noble somehow manages to juggle being a principal user designer at a global software company, CA Technologies, associate editor of UItrends. com (a blog about the good, the bad, and the ugly of user interface design), and owner of Conquest Media (www.conquestmedia.com), a small Web and application design company in Austin, Texas. Jeff has more than twelve years of design experience and specializes in all aspects of Web sites and enterprise software applications (designing, building, optimizing, explain- ing, and so on). In addition to this title, heâs handled technical editing on six other For Dummies Web design and programming titles for Wiley. In what little spare time he has away from the computer, Jeff enjoys childish activi- ties like eating unhealthy amounts of candy and breaking things, as well as relaxing hobbies like hiking, traveling, and gardening. Jeff is available for Web site and enterprise application consulting. You can contact him by e-mail at [email protected].\n\nP:06\n\nAuthorsâ Acknowledgments Wow! Itâs hard to believe weâve hit the âlucky 13th editionâ for HTML For Dummies. Of all the books Iâve worked on, this oneâs covered more time and versions than the rest. So thanks again readers, for keeping this book going strong. Weâd also like to thank our readers and the Wiley editors for provid- ing welcome feedback to drive continuing improvement of this book. Donât stop now â keep telling us what you want. Especially, tell us what you liked and didnât like about this second full-color edition. Let me also thank some people from previous editions, including J. Michael Stewart, Natanya Anderson, Dori Smith, Tom Negrino, Mary Burmeister, Brock Kyle, Chelsea Valentine, Dawn Davidson, and Kim Lindros. And, for the second time, Iâm indebted to my co-author and friend, Jeff Noble, for infus- ing insight and enthusiasm. I am grateful for your ideas, your hard work, and your experience in reaching budding Web experts. Thanks, too, to Mary Kyle Inks, who expertly project-managed this effort. At Wiley, I must thank Bob Woerner and Jean Nelson for their outstanding efforts, and Brian Walls, Teresa Artman, and Christopher McGee for their efforts on design, layout, content, and coverage. A special shout-out to the friendly folks in Composition Services for artful page layouts, and for keeping all the color-coded elements straight. Thanks to my lovely wife, Dina Kutueva-Tittel, and inquisitive son, Gregory, for putting up with my sometimes whacky and intense schedule. Iâm not always as easy to live with as I could be, but hopefully, Iâll improve with time and effort. Also, thanks to my Dad, Al Tittel, for all heâs done for my family and me, and for dropping in more frequently. I hope youâre around to see our 14th edition come to print! Finally, profound thanks and remembrances to Cecilia Katherine Kociolek Tittel (4/3/1919â9/11/2009). Thanks, Mom, for encouraging my love of words and writing: I still miss you every day. Ed Tittel\n\nP:07\n\nIâd like to thank my girlfriend, Dr. Alison Marr, for generally putting up withme and giving me time and space to work on titles like this. Iâd like note thataccording to my calculations, Alison is approximately 15 times smarter than Iam but somehow still allows me to pretend that Iâm right all the time. I knowshe has tried to explain magic graphs at least a dozen times to me but I stilldonât get it â evidently itâs not about warlocks and magical fairies. Specialthanks to Ida F. Orengo, M.D. and the rest of the staff from the Baylor Collegeof Medicine in Houston, Texas. Without all of you, there is a decent chance Iwouldnât even be alive now.Thanks to Ed Tittel for allowing me to sit in again and handle even moreresponsibility with this latest edition. This title has been one of the biggestaccomplishments in my life and has opened up incredible opportunities tome and I thank you sincerely. To Slade Deliberto, it seems like only yesterdayyou taught me how to design my first Web site. Technology and softwarechanges over time, but a lot of what Iâve accomplished so far professionallygoes all the way back to your initial design and Photoshop lessons more thantwelve years ago.Big thanks to my boss and mentor Russell Wilson, youâve always supportedand believed in me and without a doubt have made me a better designer anda better person. I donât say it as much as I should, I owe you big time and Iappreciate everything you have done for me â there, you have it in writing.To CSS master Eric Meyer, thanks for agreeing to write the Foreword to thisbook. Iâve learned a lot from your volume of work over the years and havingmy name noted on a book with yours is a huge honor. Iâd also like to dedicatethis book in memory of my friend Zach Beatty who was tragically killed by adrunk driver in 1997. Please donât drink and drive, you might kill someone alot cooler than you.Jeff Noble\n\nP:08\n\nPublisherâs AcknowledgmentsWeâre proud of this book; please send us your comments at http://dummies.custhelp.com.For other comments, please contact our Customer Care Department within the U.S. at 877-762-2974,outside the U.S. at 317-572-3993, or fax 317-572-4002.Some of the people who helped bring this book to market include the following:Acquisitions, Editorial, and Media Composition ServicesDevelopment Project Coordinator: Kristie Rees Project Editor: Jean Nelson Layout and Graphics: Samantha K.

into a larger world.How so? Itâs an introduction to the fundamental underpinnings of the Web.With the knowledge gained from this book, you can start building your ownWeb pages â and whatâs more, look at Web pages that already exist andunderstand how they were assembled. Itâs like having a second sight, a magiccrystal ball, or X-ray vision. Whatâs more, itâs all a lot easier than you think.That may sound crazy, but it really isnât. The entire list of HTML elementscan be written on a piece of paper, and the 80% of elements you need to workwith on a daily basis are easy to understand. You can pick them up in wellunder an hour. CSS is a bit more complicated than that â writing all its prop-erties on one piece of paper might require legal-disclaimer-sized type â butthe basics are very straightforward and the rest of it comes with experience.Why, you may wonder, do you need to learn all this stuff when there areprograms like Dreamweaver that will do it for you? For the same reason asculptor needs to know how to chisel rock or an auto mechanic needs tounderstand how engines and transmissions work. When something goeswrong, you need to have the skills to get in there and fix it. And eventu-ally, with practice, youâll get to the point where you can build pages fromscratch much more efficiently and elegantly than any point-and-click tool canmanage.And thatâs why, even if youâre not usually comfortable with code listings andother monospaced-font text, you should relax. (Come on, deep breath. Holdit â and release. Good.) Think of the things you learn about in this bookas Lego pieces. Each piece on its own is very simple, but you can put themtogether in all kinds of interesting and sometimes astonishing ways. Thatâsthe fun of it!Every epic journey starts with a single step. Your first steps await in thepages that follow. Savor them. Youâll never look at the Web in the same wayagain.Eric A. Meyer\n\nP:22\n\nxx HTML, XHTML & CSS For Dummies, 7th Edition\n\nP:23\n\nIntroduction Welcome to the wild, wacky, and wonderful possibilities of the World Wide Web, or more simply, the Web. In this book, we reveal the ins and outs of the markup languages that are the Webâs lifeblood â the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and its cousin, XHTML, along with the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) language used to make other stuff look good. Because HTML and XHTML (we use (X)HTML in this book to refer to both) and CSS are used to build Web pages, learning to use them brings you into the fold of Web authors and content developers. If youâve tried to build your own Web pages but found it too forbidding, now you can relax. If you can dial a telephone or find your keys in the morning, you too can become an (X)HTML author. No kidding! This book keeps the technobabble to a minimum and sticks with plain English whenever possible. Besides plain talk about hypertext, (X)HTML, and the Web, we include lots of examples, plus tag-by-tag instructions to help you build Web pages with minimum of fuss. We also provide examples about what to do with your Web pages after theyâre created so you can publish them. We explain the differences between HTML4, HTML5, and XHTML as well, so you can decide whether you want to stick with the best-known and longest-lived Web markup language (HTML) or its later and greater successor (XHTML). This book has a companion Web site that contains (X)HTML and CSS exam- ples from its chapters in usable form â plus pointers to cool widgets you can use to embellish your own documents and amaze your friends. Visit www. dummieshtml.com and start browsing from there.About This Book Think of this book as a friendly, approachable guide to taking up (X)HTML and CSS and building readable, attractive Web pages. These things arenât hard to learn, but they pack lots of details that you must handle as you build your own Web pages. Topics in this book include:\n\nP:24\n\n2 HTML, XHTML & CSS For Dummies, 7th Edition â Designing and building Web pages â Uploading and publishing Web pages for the world to see â Testing and debugging your Web pages â Introducing HTML5 and Cascading Style Sheets 3 You can build Web pages without years of arduous training, advanced aes- thetic talents, or ritual ablutions in ice-cold streams. If you can tell someone how to drive to your house, you can build a useful Web document. The pur- pose of this book isnât to turn you into a rocket scientist (or, for that matter, rocket science into (X)HTML). The purpose is to show you the design and technical elements needed for a good-looking, readable Web page and to give you the confidence to build one! How to Use This Book This book tells you how to use (X)HTML and CSS to get your Web pages up and running on the World Wide Web. We tell you whatâs involved in designing and building effective Web documents that can bring your ideas and informa- tion to the online world â if thatâs what you want to do â and maybe have some high-tech fun communicating them. To make this book easier to read, we use some conventions with the text. For example, all (X)HTML and CSS code appears in monospaced type like this: <head><title>Whatâs in a Title?</title></head>... When you type (X)HTML code, CSS, or other related stuff, be sure to copy the information exactly as you see it, including the angle brackets (< and >), because thatâs part of the magic that makes (X)HTML and CSS work. Other- wise, you learn how to marshal and manage the content that makes your pages special, and we tell you exactly what to do to mix elements of (X)HTML and CSS with your own work. The margins on a book page donât have the same room as the vast reaches of cyberspace. Therefore, long lines of (X)HTML and CSS markup, or designa- tions for Web sites (called URLs, for Uniform Resource Locators), may wrap across two or more lines. Remember, your computer shows such lines as a single line of (X)HTML or CSS, or as a single URL â so if you type that hunk of code, do it on one line. Donât insert any hard returns if you see the line wrap. We clue you in that the markup is supposed to be all one line by breaking the line at a punctuation character and by indenting the overage, like this: http://www.infocadabra.transylvania.com/nexus/plexus/lexus/praxis/okay/this/ is/a/make-believe/URL/but/some/real/ones/are/SERIOUSLY/long-too.html\n\nP:25\n\nIntroduction 3HTML4 doesnât care if you type tag text in uppercase, lowercase, or both(except for character entities, also known as character codes). HTML5,XHTML, and CSS, however, want tag text in lowercase only. Thus, to makeyour work look like ours as much as possible, enter all (X)HTML and CSS tagtext, and all other code, in lowercase only.If you have an older edition of this book, this reverses earlier instructions.The keepers of the eternal and ever-awesome HTML standard, the WorldWide Web Consortium (W3C), have changed the rules, so we follow theirlead. We donât make the rules, but we do know how to play the game!Our code listings are color-coded where specific colors signify different typesof markup. We explain this in Chapter 1 in the section about color-codingmarkup. (Notice all the illustrations use pretty colors, too!)Three Presumptuous Assumptions They say that making assumptions makes a fool out of the person who makes them and the person who is subject to those assumptions. (And just who are they, anyway? We assume we know, but . . . never mind.) You donât need to be a wizard in the arcane arts of programming, nor do you need a PhD in computer science. You donât even need a detailed sense of whatâs going on in the innards of your computer to deal with the material in this book. Even so, practicality demands us to make a few assumptions about you, gentle reader: You can turn your computer on and off; you do know how to use a mouse and a keyboard; and you want to build your own Web pages for fun, profit, or some esoteric reason entirely of your own. We also assume you have a working Internet connection and a Web browser. If you can write a sentence and know the difference between a heading and a paragraph, you can build and publish your own documents on the Web. The rest consists of details â and we help you with those!How This Book Is Organized This book contains six major parts, arranged like Russian Matrioshki (nesting dolls). Parts contain at least three chapters, and each chapter contains sev- eral modular sections. This way, you can use this book to jump around, find topics or keywords in the index or table of contents, or read the whole book from cover to cover.\n\nP:26\n\n4 HTML, XHTML & CSS For Dummies, 7th Edition Part I: Getting to Know (X)HTML and CSS This part sets the stage for, overviews, and introduces the Web and the software that people use to mine its treasures. It also explains how the Web works, including the (X)HTML and CSS that this book covers, and the server- side software and services that deliver these goods to end users (when we arenât preoccupied with the innards of our systems). (X)HTML documents, also called Web pages, are the fundamental units of information, organization, and delivery on the Web. Here, you also discover what HTML is about, how hypertext can enrich ordinary text, and what CSS does to modify and manage how that text looks on display. Next you take a walk on the Web side and build your very first (X)HTML document. Part II: Formatting Web Pages with (X)HTML HTML mixes ordinary text with special characters called markup, used to instruct browsers how to display (X)HTML documents. In this part, you find out about markup in general and (X)HTML in particular. We start with a fasci- nating discussion of (X)HTML document organization and structure. (Well . . . we think itâs fascinating, and we hope you do, too.) Next we explain how text can be organized into blocks and lists. Then we tackle how the hyperlinks that put the H into (X)HTML work. After that, we discuss how you can find and use graphical images in your Web pages and make some fancy formatting maneuvers to spruce up those pages. Throughout this part, we include discussion of (X)HTML markup elements (tags) and how they work. By the time you finish Part II, expect to have a good overall idea of what HTML is and how to use it. Heck, we even include a chapter at the end of Part II that steers you clear of obsolete or no-longer- recommended markup so youâll know it when you see it (and avoid using that stale dross yourself). Part III: Taking Precise Control over Web Pages and Styles Part III starts with a discussion of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) â another form of markup language that lets (X)HTML deal purely with content while it deals with how Web pages look when theyâre displayed in a Web browser or as rendered on other devices (PDAs, mobile phones, and special assis- tive devices for visually impaired users). After exploring CSS syntax and structures and discovering how to use them, you find out how to manipu- late color and typefaces for text, backgrounds, and more on your Web\n\nP:27\n\nIntroduction 5pages. We give you lots of examples to help you design and build commer-cial-grade (X)HTML documents. You can get started working with related(X)HTML tag syntax and structures that you need to know so you can buildcomplex Web pages.Part IV: Scripting and (X)HTML(X)HTML isnât good at snazzing up text and graphics when theyâre on display(thatâs where CSS excels). And (X)HTML really canât do much by itself. Webdesigners often build interactive, dynamic Web pages using scripting tools toadd interactivity to an (X)HTML framework.In this part, you find out about scripting languages that enable Web pages tointeract with users and that also provide ways to respond to user input oractions and to grab and massage data along the way. Youâre introduced togeneral scripting languages, and we jump directly into the most popular suchlanguage â JavaScript. You discover the basic elements of this scriptinglanguage and how to add interactivity to Web pages. You also explore typicaluses for scripting that you can extend and add to your own Web site. We goon to explore how you can embed content from third parties into your Webpages, leverage other peopleâs dynamic content, spruce up your site withvery little effort, and get lots of nice returns from services like Flickr, Twitter,YouTube, and Google Maps.Throughout this part, examples, advice, and details show you how scriptingand embedded components can enhance your Web siteâs capabilities â andyour usersâ experiences when visiting your pages.Part V: The Future of (X)HTMLBig things are happening in the (X)HTML world, with lots of changes on theway. In this part, we lay the new stuff on you, show you how it looks andwhat it can do (when browsers cooperate, that is), and tell you what to soonexpect.You find a chapter on (X)HTML for mobile devices, such as smartphones,iPads, and other portable electronic doo-dads with Web access. You alsofind a chapter on a new and improved version of HTML â namely, HTML5 âcoming soon to a browser near you and maybe to your Web site. Plus, thereâsanother chapter on an upcoming version of CSS â namely, CSS3. We providecool examples, all of which you can view on our companion Web site at www.dummieshtml.com (or not, as your Web browser permits).\n\nP:28\n\n6 HTML, XHTML & CSS For Dummies, 7th Edition Part VI: The Part of Tens In this part, we sum up and distill the very essence of the mystic secrets of (X)HTML. Here you can read further about cool Web tools, review top doâs and donâts for HTML markup, and review how to catch and kill potential bugs and errors in your pages before anybody else sees them. Icons Used in This Book This icon signals technical details that are informative and interesting but arenât absolutely critical to writing HTML. This icon flags useful information that makes HTML markup or other impor- tant stuff even less complicated than you feared it might be. This icon calls out stuff you shouldnât pass by â donât overlook these gentle reminders (the life, sanity, or page you save could be your own). Watch out when you see this icon. It warns you of things you shouldnât do; consequences can be severe if you ignore accompanying bits of wisdom. Information highlighted with this icon gives best practices â advice we wish weâd had when we first started out! These techniques can save you time and money on migraine medication. Where to Go from Here This is where you pick a direction and hit the road! Where you start out doesnât matter. Donât worry. You can handle it. We know youâre getting ready to have the time of your life. Enjoy!\n\nP:29\n\nPart IGetting to Know(X)HTML and CSS\n\nP:30\n\nIn this part . . .Here, we explore and explain basic HTML document links and structures. We also explain the role thatWeb browsers play in delivering all this stuff to peopleâsdesktops. We even explain where the (X) comes from ânamely, a reworking of the original description of HTMLmarkup using XML syntax to create (X)HTML â and goon to help you understand what makes (X)HTML different(and possibly better, according to some) than plain oldHTML. We also look at general Web page anatomy, thevarious pieces and parts that make a Web page, and howCSS helps manage their presentation, placement, and evencolor when they appear on somebodyâs display.Next, we take you through the exercise of creating andviewing a simple Web page so you can understand whatâsinvolved. We also explain making changes to an existingWeb page and how to post your changes (or a new page)online.This part concludes with a rousing exhortation to figureout what youâre doing before making too much markuphappen. A well built house starts with a set of blueprintsand architectural drawings, and a Web page (and site)should start with a plan or a map, too, with some ideaof where your pages will reside in cyberspace and howhordes of users can find their way to them.\n\nP:31\n\nChapter 1The Least You Need to Know about HTML, CSS, and the WebIn This Chapterâ¶ Creating HTML in text filesâ¶ Serving and browsing Web pagesâ¶ Understanding links and URLsâ¶ Understanding basic HTML syntaxâ¶ Understanding basic CSS Welcome to the wonderful world of the Web, (X)HTML, and CSS. With just a little knowledge, some practice, and something to say, you can build your own little piece of cyberspace or improve on existing work. Youâll notice we use (X)HTML throughout this book. This is an acronym we made up to stand for âeither HTML or XHTML,â where HTML is Hypertext Markup Language, and XHTML is Extensible Hypertext Markup Language. Although HTML and XHTML arenât exactly identical, theyâre enough like each other for this reference to make sense. This book is your down-and-dirty guide to understanding Web documents, sprucing up an existing page, or creating complex and exciting pages that integrate intricate designs, multimedia, and scripting. The best way to start working with HTML is to jump right in, so thatâs what this chapter does: It brings you up to speed on the basics of how (X)HTML and CSS work behind the scenes inside Web pages, introducing you to their underlying building blocks. When youâre done with this chapter, youâll know how (X)HTML and CSS work so you can start creating or editing Web pages right away.\n\nP:32\n\n10 Part I: Getting to Know (X)HTML and CSS Web Pages in Their Natural Habitat Web pages can accommodate many kinds of content, such as text, graphics, forms, audio and video files, and even interactive games. Browse the Web for only a moment, and you see a buffet of information and content displayed in many ways. Every Web site is different, but most have one thing in common: the Hypertext Markup Language (also known as HTML). Youâll also run into Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) pretty regularly, too. Whatever information a Web page contains, every Web page is created using HTML (or some reasonable facsimile). HTML is the mortar that holds Web pages together; graphics, content, and other information are the bricks; CSS tells Web pages how they should look when on display. HTML files that produce Web pages are just text documents, as are XHTML and CSS files. This use of text documents is why the Web works as well as it does. Text is a universal language for computers. Any text file you create on a Windows computer â including any HTML, XHTML, or CSS file â works equally well on a Mac or any other operating system. But Web pages arenât merely text documents. Web pages are made with spe- cial, attention-deprived, sugar-loaded text called HTML, XHTML, or CSS. Each uses its own specific set of instructions that you include (along with your content) inside text files to specify how a page should look and behave. Stick with us to discover everything you need to know about (X)HTML and CSS! Hypertext Special instructions in HTML permit lines of text to point (that is, link) to something else in cyberspace. Such pointers are called hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are the glue that holds the World Wide Web together. In your Web browser, hyperlinks usually appear in blue and are underlined. When you click a hyperlink, it takes you somewhere else. Hypertext or not, a Web page is a text file, which means you can create and edit a Web page in any application that creates plain text (such as Notepad or TextEdit). Some software tools offer fancy options and applications (covered in Chapter 23) to help you create Web pages, but they generate the same text files that you create with plain-text editors. Weâre of the opinion, though, that those just getting started with HTML are best served by a simple text editor. Just break out Notepad on the PC (or TextEdit on the Mac), and youâre ready to go.\n\nP:33\n\n11Chapter 1: The Least You Need to Know about HTML, CSS, and the Web Steer clear of word processors like WordPad or Microsoft Word when creat- ing HTML. They introduce all kinds of extra code to Web pages that you may neither want nor need. The World Wide Web comes by its name honestly. Itâs quite literally a web of online pages hosted on Web servers around the world, connected in trillions of ways by hyperlinks that tie pages together. Without such links, the Web would be just a bunch of standalone pages. Much of the Webâs value comes from its ability to link to pages and other resources (such as images, downloadable files, and media presentations) on either the same Web site or at another site. For example, USA.gov (www.usa. gov) is a gateway Web site â its sole function is to provide access to other Web sites. If you arenât sure which government agency handles first-time loans for homebuyers, or you want to arrange a tour of the Capitol, visit the site shown in Figure 1-1 to find out. Figure 1-1: USA.gov uses hyperlinks to help visitors find government information. Web browsers were created specifically for the purpose of reading HTML instructions (known as markup) and displaying the resulting Web page.\n\nP:34\n\n12 Part I: Getting to Know (X)HTML and CSS Markup lives in a text file (with your content) to give orders to a browser. For example, look at the page shown in Figure 1-2. You can see how the page is made up and how it is formatted by examining its underlying HTML. Figure 1-2: To achieve its present good looks, this Web page incorporates multiple parts and numerous bits of HTML and CSS markup. This page includes an image, a heading that describes the page, several para- graphs of text about one of your authors, and an address block with links to a rÃ©sumÃ© and a list of publications. However, different components of the page use different formatting: â The heading at the top of the page is larger than text in the paragraphs. â Blocks of text are separated by more blank space than between contigu- ous lines of text within blocks. â Some text is in white, some orange, and some light blue.\n\nP:35\n\n13Chapter 1: The Least You Need to Know about HTML, CSS, and the Web The browser knows to display these components of the page in specific ways thanks to the HTML markup, shown in Listing 1-1. (Youâll see Listing 1-1 in all its glory at the end of the chapter.) Any text enclosed between angle brackets (less-than and greater-than signs: < >) is an HTML tag (often called the markup). For example, a p within brack- ets (<p>â¦</p> tags) identifies text inside paragraphs. The markup between <style> and </style> tags at the head of the file uses CSS to define the look and feel for various HTML elements used on this page. Thatâs really all there is to it. You embed the markup in a text file, along with text for readers to view, to tell the browser how to display your Web page. Tags and the content between (and within) the tags are collectively called elements. Angle brackets < > enclose HTML and XHTML markup, curly braces { } enclose CSS markup. Browsers The userâs piece in the Web puzzle is a Web browser. Web browsers read instructions written in HTML, XHTML, and CSS, and use those instructions to display Web page content on your screen. You should always write your HTML with the idea that people will view the content using a Web browser. Just remember that thereâs more than one kind of browser out there, and each one comes in several versions. Usually, Web browsers request and display Web pages available via the Internet from a Web server. You can also display HTML pages youâve saved on your own computer before making them available on a Web server on the Internet. When youâre developing your own HTML pages, you view these pages (called local pages) in your browser. You can use local pages to get a good idea of what people see after the page goes live on the Internet. Each Web browser interprets HTML in its own way. The same HTML may not look exactly alike from one browser to the next. When you work with basic HTML, variations will be minor, but as you add other elements (such as scripting and multimedia), rendering markup gets hairy. Chapter 2 shows how to use a Web browser to view a local copy of your first Web page. Some people use text-only Web browsers, such as Lynx, because either â Theyâre visually impaired and canât use a graphical display. â They like a lean, fast Web browser that displays only text.\n\nP:36\n\n14 Part I: Getting to Know (X)HTML and CSS A bevy of browsers The Web world is full of browsers of many shapes and sizes â or rather versions and feature sets. Some popular browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Google Chrome. Other browsers, such as Opera and Lynx, are also widely used. As an HTML developer, you must think beyond your own browser experience and preferences. Every user has his or her personal browser preferences and settings. Each browser renders HTML a bit differently. Every browser handles JavaScript, multimedia, style sheets, and other HTML add-ins differently too. Throw different operating systems into the mix, and things get really fun. Usually differences between browsers are minor. But sometimes a combination of HTML, text, and media brings a specific browser to its knees. When you work with HTML, test your pages on as many different browsers as you can. Install at least three different browsers on your own system for testing. We recommend the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome. Yahoo! has a fairly complete list of browsers at http://dir.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Software/Internet/World_Wide_Web/ Browsers Web servers Your HTML pages arenât much good if you canât share them with the world. Web servers make that possible. A Web server is a computer that â Connects to the Internet â Runs Web-server software â Responds to requests from Web browsers for Web pages Almost any computer can be a Web server, including your home computer. But Web servers generally are computers dedicated to the task. You donât need to be an Internet or computer guru to publish your Web pages, but you must find a Web server to serve your pages: â If youâre building pages for a company Web site, your IT department may have a Web server. (Ask your IT guru for the information.) â If youâre starting a new site, you need a host for your Web pages. Finding an inexpensive host is easy â all it takes is a simple Google search. One inexpensive host is GoDaddy (www.godaddy.com), with current monthly fees as low as $1.99 a month. You can even find free\n\nP:37\n\n15Chapter 1: The Least You Need to Know about HTML, CSS, and the Web hosts for your Web site with a little effort. Free Web Hosts maintains a list of free host providers. Check them out at www.free-webhosts. com. Chapter 3 shows how to determine your hosting needs and find the perfect provider.Anatomy of a URL The Web is made up of billions of resources, each of them linkable. A resourceâs exact location is the key to linking to it. Without an exact address (a Uniform Resource Locator, or URL), you canât use the Address bar in a Web browser to visit a Web page directly. URLs are the standard addressing system for Web resources. Each resource (Web page, site, or individual file) has a unique URL. URLs work a lot like your postal address. Figure 1-3 identifies the components of a URL.

Introducing Internet protocolsInteractions between browsers and servers the Internet. The good news is that Web brows-are made possible by a set of computer- ers and servers do all the HTTP work for you, socommunication instructions: Hypertext Transfer you only have to put your pages on a server orProtocol (HTTP). This protocol defines how type a Web address into a browser.browsers should request Web pages and howWeb servers should respond to those requests. To see how HTTP works, check out David Gourley and Brian Tottyâs chapter on HTTPHTTP isnât the only protocol at work on the Messages, available through Google bookInternet. The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol search with âunderstanding http transac-(SMTP) and Post Office Protocol (POP) make tionsâ as the search string. Start your search ate-mail exchange possible, and the File Transfer http://books.google.com, then scrollProtocol (FTP) allows you to upload, download, down until you see the link to âHTTP: the defini-move, copy, and delete files and folders across tive guideâ and check out Page 80.\n\nP:38\n\n16 Part I: Getting to Know (X)HTML and CSS Each URL component helps define the location of a Web page or resource: â Protocol: Specifies the protocol the browser follows to request the file. The Web page protocol is http:// (the usual start to most URLs). â Domain: Points to the general Web site (such as www.sun.com) where the file resides. A domain may host a few files (like a personal Web site) or millions of files (like a large corporate site, such as www.sun.com). â Path: Names the sequence of folders through which you must navigate to get to a specific file. For example, to get to a file in the evangcentral folder that resides in the developers folder, you use the /developers/evangcentral/ path. â Filename: Specifies which file in a directory path the browser accesses. Although the URL shown in Figure 1-3 is not publicly accessible, it points to the domain and offers a path that leads to a specific file named file.html: http://www.domain.com/mainfolder/subfolder/file.html Chapter 6 provides the complete details on how you use HTML and URLs to add hyperlinks to your Web pages, and Chapter 3 shows how to obtain a URL for your own Web site after youâre ready to move it to a Web server. (X)HTMLâs Component Parts The following section removes the mystery from the X. This section shows â The differences between HTML and XHTML â How HTML is written (its syntax) â Rules that govern use of HTML (and XHTML) â Names for important pieces and parts of HTML (and XHTML) markup â How to make the best, most correct use of (X)HTML capabilities HTML and XHTML: Whatâs the difference? HTML is Hypertext Markup Language, markup developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s to describe Web pages. HTML is now enshrined in numerous standard descriptions (specifications) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The last HTML specification was done in 1999.\n\nP:39\n\n17Chapter 1: The Least You Need to Know about HTML, CSS, and the Web When you put an X in front of HTML to get XHTML, you get a new, improved version of HTML based on the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). XML is designed to work and behave well with computers, software, and the Internet. The original formulation of HTML has some irregularities that can cause heartburn for software that reads HTML documents. XHTML, on the other hand, uses an extremely regular and predictable syntax thatâs easier for soft- ware to handle. XHTML will replace HTML someday, but HTML keeps on tick- ing. This book covers both varieties and shows you the steps to put the X in front of your own HTML documents and turn them into XHTML. â Most HTML and XHTML markup is identical. â In a few cases, HTML and XHTML markup looks a little different. â In a few cases, HTML and XHTML markup must be used differently. This book shows how to create code that works in both HTML and XHTML. Syntax and rules HTML is a straightforward language for describing Web page contents. XHTML is even less demanding. Their components are easy to use â when you know how to use a little bit of (X)HTML. Both HTML and XHTML markup have three types of components: â Elements: Identify different parts of an HTML page by using tags. â Attributes: Information about an instance of an element. â Entities: Non-ASCII text characters, such as copyright symbols (Â©) and accented letters (Ã). Entities originate from the Standard Generic Markup Language, or SGML. Every bit of HTML and/or XHTML markup that describes a Web pageâs con- tent includes some combination of elements, attributes, and entities. This chapter covers basic form and syntax for elements, attributes, and enti- ties. Parts II and III of the book show how elements and attributes: â Describe kinds of text (such as paragraphs or tables) â Create an effect on the page (such as changing a font style) â Add images and links to a page\n\nP:40\n\n18 Part I: Getting to Know (X)HTML and CSS Markup color-coding As we present HTML, XHTML, and CSS information in our code samples, we use color-coding to help you distinguish whatâs what by way of markup. Here is a color key that you should keep in mind as you read all of our code listings: â Purple Indicates the DOCTYPE declaration used in (X)HTML docu- ments. This is actually a totally different markup language known as the Standard Generalized Markup Language, or SGML. SGML is used to iden- tify what specific set of rules that (X)HTML documents follow in their construction and content. It also applies to codes for character entities, such as the following: &pos; &123; â Light green Indicates ordinary garden variety XHTML and HTML markup â Dark green Indicates XML markup â Orange Indicates Cascading Style Sheet, or CSS, markup â Blue Indicates JavaScript We only colorize markup in code listings and code blocks because it affects readability too much when code appears in body copy. In that case, we simply use a different, monospaced font â as youâll see in the discussions of the <html>, <head>, and <title> elements in our first paragraph that dis- cusses HTML markup here. One more thing: If you use an HTML editor, such as HTML Kit, Dreamweaver, Kompozer, or whatever, you find these tools also use text color to help you identify different kinds of markup. The thing is that none of these tools do this the same way, and none of them match the way we do it here â we picked out colors that would be easy to see (and distinguish) when viewed on a four-color printed page; whereas others picked their colors to look good on LCD displays. Elements Elements are the building blocks of (X)HTML. You use them to describe every piece of text on your page. Elements are made up of tags and the con- tent within those tags. There are two main types of elements: â Elements with content made up of a tag pair and whatever content sits between the opening and closing tags in the pair â Elements that insert something into the page, using a single tag\n\nP:41\n\n19Chapter 1: The Least You Need to Know about HTML, CSS, and the Web Tag pairs Elements that describe content use a tag pair to mark the beginning and the end of the element. Start and end tag pairs look like this: <tag>...</tag> Content â such as paragraphs, headings, tables, and lists â always uses a tag pair: â The start tag (<tag>) tells the browser, âThe element begins here.â â The end tag (</tag>) tells the browser, âThe element ends here.â Actual content is what occurs between a start tag and an end tag. For exam- ple, the Ed Tittel page in Listing 1-1 uses a paragraph element (<p>) to sur- round text for a paragraph (we omit CSS inline markup for clarity): <p>Ed started writing about computing subjects in 1986 for a Macintosh oriented monthly magazine. By 1989 he had contributed to such publications as LAN Times, Network World, Mac World, and LAN Magazine. He worked on his first book in 1991, and by 1994 had contributed to over a dozen different titles.</p> Single tags Elements that insert something into the page are called empty elements (because they enclose no content) and use just a single tag, like this: <tag /> Images and line breaks insert something into the HTML file, so they use one tag. One key difference between XHTML and HTML is that, in XHTML, all empty elements must end with a slash before the closing greater-than symbol. This is because XHTML is based on XML, and the XML rule is that you close empty elements with a slash, like this: <tag/> However, to make this kind of markup readable inside older browsers, you should insert a space before the closing slash, like this: <tag />\n\nP:42\n\n20 Part I: Getting to Know (X)HTML and CSS This space allows older browsers to ignore the closing slash (because they donât know about XHTML). Newer browsers that understand XHTML ignore the space and interpret the tag exactly, which is <tag/> (as per the XML rules). HTML doesnât require a slash with empty elements, but this markup is dep- recated (that is, identified as obsolete even though it still occurs in some markup). An HTML empty element looks like this: <tag /> Listing 1-1 uses the image element (<img />) to include an image on the page: <img src=âimages/header.gifâ alt=âheader graphicâ width=â794â height=â160â /> The <img /> element references an image. When the browser displays the page, it replaces the <img /> element with the file that it points to (an attri- bute does the pointing, as shown in the next section). Following the XHTML rule introduced earlier, what appears in HTML as <img> appears in XHTML as <img /> (and this applies to all single tag elements). You canât make up HTML or XHTML elements. Legal elements for (X)HTML belong to a very specific set â if you use elements that arenât part of that set, every browser ignores them. The elements you can use are defined in the HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 specifications. (The specs for HTML 4.01 can be found at www.w3.org/TR/html4, while the specs for XHTML 1.0 can be found at www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1.) Nesting Many page structures combine nested elements. Think of your nested ele- ments as suitcases that fit neatly inside one another. For example, a bulleted list uses two kinds of elements: â The <ul> element specifies that the list is unordered (bulleted). â The <li> elements mark each item in the list. When you combine elements by using this method, be sure you close the inside element completely before you close the outside element: <ul> <li>Item 1</li> <li>Item 2</li> </ul>\n\nP:43\n\n21Chapter 1: The Least You Need to Know about HTML, CSS, and the Web Attributes Attributes allow variety in how an element describes content or works. Attributes let you use elements differently depending on circumstances. For example, the <img /> element uses the src attribute to specify the location of the image you want to include on your page: <img src=âimages/header.gifâ alt=âheader graphicâ width=â794â height=â160â /> In this bit of HTML, the <img /> element itself is a general flag to the browser that you want to include an image; the src attribute provides the specifics on the image you want to include â header.gif in this instance. Other attributes (such as width and height) provide information about how to display that image, while the alt attribute provides a text alternative to the image that a text-only browser can display (or a text-to-speech reader can read aloud, for the visually impaired). Chapter 7 describes the <img /> element and its attributes in detail. You include attributes within the start tag of the element you want them with â after the element name but before the ending sign, like this: <tag attribute=âvalueâ attribute=âvalueâ> XML syntax rules decree that attribute values must always appear in quota- tion marks, but you can include the attributes and their values in any order within the start tag or within a single tag. Every (X)HTML element has a collection of attributes that can be used with it, but you canât mix and match attributes and elements however you please. Some attributes can take any text as a value because the value could be any- thing, like the location of an image or a page you want to link to. Others have a specific list of values the attribute can take, such as your options for align- ing text in a table cell. The HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 specifications define exactly which attributes you can use with any given element and which values (if explicitly defined) each attribute can take. Each chapter in Parts II and III covers which attributes you can use with each (X)HTML element. Also, see our online content for complete lists of depre- cated (X)HTML tags and attributes.\n\nP:44\n\n22 Part I: Getting to Know (X)HTML and CSS Entities Text makes the Web possible, but it has limitations. Entities are special char- acters that you can display on your Web page. Non-ASCII characters Basic American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) text defines a fairly small number of characters. It doesnât include some special characters, such as trademark symbols, fractions, and accented characters. For example, if we translate a paragraph of text from the page in Figure 1-2 into German, the result includes three u characters with umlauts (Ã¼), as shown in Figure 1-4. Figure 1-4: ASCII text canât represent all text characters, so HTML entities do the job instead. ASCII text doesnât include an umlauted u, so HTML uses entities to represent such characters. The browser replaces the entity with the character it refer- ences. Each entity begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;); entities come originally from SGML, so we color-code them in purple to reflect their origins. The following markup shows entities in bold: <html> <head> <style type=âtext/cssâ> body { font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; } cite { font-family: serif; font-style: italic; }\n\nP:45\n\n23Chapter 1: The Least You Need to Know about HTML, CSS, and the Web </style> <title>Ed auf Deutsch</title> </head> <body> <p>Ed Tittel hat seinen technischen Schriften im Jahre 1986 angefangen, als er f&uuml;r einen Macintosh monatlichen Zeitschrift Artikeln schrieb. In drei mehr Jahren, hat er auch f&uuml;r anderen Journalen wie <cite>LAN Times</cite>, <cite>Network World</cite>, und <cite>LAN Magazine</cite> merhrere Artikeln beigetragen. Er fertigte seinen ersten Buch im Jarhe 1991, und beim Ende des Jahres 1994 hat er auf ein Dutzend B&uuml;cher gearbeitet.</p> </body> </html> The entity that represents the umlauted u is &uuml;. (X)HTML character codes The encodings for the ISO-Latin-1 character set are supplied by default, and related entities (a pointer to a complete table appears in Chapter 24) can be invoked and used without special contortions. But using other encodings mentioned earlier requires inclusion of special markup to tell the browser it must interpret Unicode character codes. (Unicode is an international standard â ISO standard 10646, in fact â that embraces enough charac- ter codes to handle most unique alphabets, plus plenty of other symbols and nonalphabetic characters as well.) This special markup takes the form <meta http-equiv=âContent-Typeâ content=âtext/html; charset=UTF 8â>; because the value for charset reads UTF-8, you can reference common Unicode values that appear in Chapter 24. Although todayâs browsers support UTF-8 across the board, you can expect to see support for UTF-16 character codes showing up in the next year or two. This will let browsers deal more effectively with non-Roman alphabets like Arabic, kata kana (Japanese), or Hangul (Korean), which some browsers struggle to render correctly today. Tag characters HTML-savvy software assumes that some HTML characters, such as the greater-than and less-than signs, are meant to be hidden and not displayed on your finished Web page. If you actually want to show a greater-than or less-than sign on your page, youâre going to have to make your wishes clear to the browser. The following entities let you display characters that nor- mally are part of the hidden HTML markup: â less-than sign (<): &lt; â greater-than sign (>): &gt; â ampersand (&): &amp;\n\nP:46\n\n24 Part I: Getting to Know (X)HTML and CSS The < and > signs are used in markup, but these symbols are instructions to the browser and wonât show up on the page. If you need these symbols on the Web page, include the entities for them in your markup, like this: <p>The paragraph element identifies some text as a paragraph:</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p> In the preceding markup, the first line uses tags to describe a paragraph, and the second line shows how entities describe the < and > symbols. Figure 1-5 shows these entities as characters in a browser window.Figure 1-5: Entities let <, >, and & symbols appear in a browser window.Parts Is Parts: What Web Pages Are Made Of Comments include text in (X)HTML files that isnât displayed in the final page. Each comment is identified with two special sequences of markup characters:â Begin each comment with the string <!--â End each comment with the string -->In the following code, comments explain how each markup element functionsand where it fits into the HTML markup hierarchy.Elements are organized into a structure:â Some elements can occur only inside other elements.â Some elements are required for a well-structured (X)HTML document.<html> <!-- This tag should always occur at or near the beginning of any<head> well-formed HTML document --> <!-- The head element supplies information to label the whole HTML document -->\n\nP:47\n\n25Chapter 1: The Least You Need to Know about HTML, CSS, and the Web <title>Welcome to Ed Tittel.com</title> <!-- The text in the title element appears in the title bar of the browser window when the page is viewed --> </head> <!-- closes the head element --> <body> <!-- The content that appears on any Web page appears or is invoked from inside the body element --> <!-- Skip a bunch of copy here . . . --> <!-- Subtitle text --> <h1>Contact:</h1> <!-- List --> <ul> <li><b>Email:</b> etittel at yahoo dot com</li> <li><b>Address:</b> 2443 Arbor Drive, Round Rock, TX 78681-2160</li> <li><b>Phone:</b> 512-252-7497 (No solicitors, please)</li> <li>List of publications available in: <a href=âdocs/v_et.docâ target=â_blankâ>MS Word</a></li> <li>Resume available in: <a href=âdocs/Resu-et13.docâ target=â_ blankâ> MS Word</a></li> </ul></body> <!-- End of the body section --> </html> <!-- End of the HTML document --> The preceding document is broken into a head and a body. Within each sec- tion, certain kinds of elements appear. Many combinations are possible â and thatâs what you see throughout this book! To see complete, valid HTML files for any and all screen captures of pages we build in this book, visit the Web site at www.dummieshtml.com and check the area for each chapter. The preceding markup appears therein as 01Listing01.html, for example. Organizing HTML text Beyond the division into head and body sections, text can be organized in plenty of ways in HTML documents. Document heads Inside the head section, you can define all kinds of labels and information besides a title, primarily to describe the document that follows, such as the character sets used, meta data about the current document, scripts to be invoked, and style information. The body section is where real content lives and most (X)HTML elements appear.\n\nP:48\n\n26 Part I: Getting to Know (X)HTML and CSS Document headings Headings (denoted using elements h1 through h6) are different from the HTML document head. Individual headings structure the text that follows them, whereas the head identifies or describes the whole document. In the Ed Tittel page example, the h1 element sets off the Contact block at the bottom of the page. Paragraphs and more When you want running text on a Web page, the paragraph element, p (which includes the <p> and </p> tags), breaks text into paragraphs. You can also create horizontal rules (lines) by using the <hr /> element. HTML also includes all kinds of ways to emphasize or identify text inside paragraphs; Parts II and III of this book show a few of them. Lists HTML permits easy definition of unordered or bulleted lists. Various mecha- nisms to create other kinds of lists, including numbered lists, are also avail- able. Lists can be nested within lists to create as many levels of hierarchy as your list might need (perhaps when outlining a complex subject or model- ing a table of contents with several heading levels you want to represent). Chapter 5 covers creating lists in more detail. Tables In addition to providing a variety of listing mechanisms, HTML also includes markup for defining tables. (Tables were really popular at one time in HTML design, and they were used for all kinds of page layouts; today, theyâre used for tables, as they should be.) Structure is part of how markup works, so within the definition of a table, you can â Distinguish between column heads and table data â Manage how rows and columns are laid out Cascading Style Sheet markup CSS markup can occur in separate style-sheet documents, in a block of text in the head of an HTML document, or appended in the style attribute within individual HTML elements â and even in some combination of all three such forms! What CSS does is provide much more detailed control over\n\nP:49\n\n27Chapter 1: The Least You Need to Know about HTML, CSS, and the Web font selection, use of color for text and backgrounds, positioning of text and other elements on the page, and (as the old Ronco ad intones) âmuch, much more.â You delve into CSS in detail in Part III of this book, but we cover bits and pieces of CSS throughout the book as appropriate for the subject matter at hand. You can build a Web site without using CSS (using CSS makes more work), but itâs the right tool for precise control over look and layout! Images in HTML Documents Adding an image to any HTML document is easy. Careful and well-planned use of images adds greatly to Web pages. Chapter 7 shows how to grab images from files. Chapter 9 shows how to use complex markup to posi- tion and flow text around graphics. Along the way, you also discover how to select and use interesting and compelling images to add both allure and information to your Web pages. Links and navigation tools Web page structure should help visitors find their way around collections of pages, look for (and hopefully, find) items of interest, and get where they most want to go quickly and easily. Links provide the mechanism to bring people into your Web pages, so Chapter 6 shows how to â Reference external items or resources â Jump from one page to the next â Jump around inside a page â Add structure and organization to your pages The importance of structure and organization increases in relation to the amount of information that you want to present to your visitors. Navigation tools (which establish standard mechanisms and tools for moving around inside a Web site) provide ways to create and present your Web page (and site) structure to visitors as well as mechanisms for users to grab and use organized menus of choices When you add everything up, your result should be a well-organized set of information and images that are easy to understand, use, and navigate.\n\nP:50\n\n28 Part I: Getting to Know (X)HTML and CSS Listing 1-1: Meet an Author!
