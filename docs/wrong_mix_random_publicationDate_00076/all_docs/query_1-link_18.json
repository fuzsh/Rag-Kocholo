Box 85518 Lincoln, NE 68501-5518 CHANGE SERVICE REQUESTED December 3, 2004 Volume 26 Number 49 www.processor.com Products, News & Information Data Centers Can Trust. Since 1979 In This ISSUE Consultant TCO | There are certain factors across the board that could affect the total cost of hiring a consultant. Understanding these will help you better prepare for potential budgeting surprises. Internet-Based Backup | Rather than purchasing backup equipment and media and configuring and administering it, you may find it beneficial to subscribe to a service that lets you back your critical data to remote storage across the Internet. Hiring A Consultant | Consultants are often mocked, but for all the guff they take, a good one can be worth his weight in gold. The trick is knowing how to find one. Get On Patch & Update Lists | Systems administrators don't have to be left in the dark when patch, security, firmware, or other sup- port updates become available. Successfully Running VoIP | VoIP can be a tremendous cost saver for your business, but you must make sure the infrastruc- ture and expertise you have in-house are good enough to implement, service, and maintain VoIP. Fire Detection | Since their debut, data center fire detection devices have gotten better, cheaper, and more reli- able, while different systems offer their own mix of advantages and disadvantages.

DEPARTMENTS Upcoming IT Events 31 What's Next 31 What's Happening 31 Marketplace News 2 Product Releases 6 Opinions 20,21 MarketWatch 24 Consultants Can Be A Boon For Success, Identify Where Help Is Needed & Hire Outsourcers Carefully by Elizabeth Millard When a large project looms ahead and the in-house staff has some skill gaps, IT departments are aware of their choices: Either hire the appro- priate guru, train existing staff to get those skills sharpened, or bring in a consultant who specializes in the field. That third option, which can include hiring a lone expert or bringing in a whole team, has been growing in popularity as companies, especially in the small to medium-sized range, try to stretch their tech depart- ment dollars. But not all pro- jects are appropriate for con- sultant help. Companies should look at the areas where consultants can be useful and hire the outsourcers according- ly, but they should also be thinking about where consultants don't make sense. Here are some areas where consulting help can be a boon for a small to medium- sized enter- prise that wants to boost its tech power. Long-Range Planning For many IT departments, the to-do lists are long and comprehensive, but they often don't extend beyond the next few weeks, let alone months and years. It's vital to make sure that a com- pany is running well by having data storage policies in place and strong support measures, but it's also important to think about where the company should be, technology-wise, in the next five to 10 years. Understanding future directions can be difficult for managers who are used to tackling immediate prob- lems. \"SMEs in particular don't usu- ally sit back and think about their long-term strategy,\" says Helen Chan, an analyst at the Yankee Group research firm. \"Smaller com- panies are very tactical and reactive. They don't often have time to make strategic forecasts.\" Consultants can be useful, she notes, for determining items such as total cost of ownership for equipment and services and putting them into a long-range Go to Page 6, Column 1 Make The Most Of Leasing Tips & Tricks For Small To Medium-Sized Enterprises The Processor.com home page is updated each week v new articles and hardware news to help you keep curre Visit www.processor.com today. by Sandra Kay Miller The value of IT equipment is not in its ownership but its utility. In the rapidly changing world of technology, leasing hardware has become a popular option for SMEs to outfit their organizations with leading- edge IT resources without tying up short-term funds. Leasing involves entering into a contract with either a leasing company or a vendor for the use of equipment for a specific period at a predeter- mined price, with lease pay- ments typically being less than the original equipment costs. Consider cost-benefit analysis focused on a key comparison: What would be the overall cost of purchasing the equipment, factoring in items such as cred- it-line interest charges and depreciation-driven tax write- offs? Then, how would that In the rapidly changing world of technology, leasing hardware has become a popular option for SMEs. compare with the total cost of leasing (monthly fees over the course of the lease)? Before jumping in and signing a con- tract, carefully review the terms to determine how important factors such as maintenance and replacement costs for lost, stolen, or damaged goods are covered, as well as what hap- pens to the equipment at the close of the lease.

Tech stocks suffered a sell-off and then rebounded slightly, as well. The Dow closed at 10489.42, up from 10487.65 on Nov. 16, while the Nasdaq closed at 2085.19, up from 2078.62 on Nov. 16. I Computer Associates Taps IBM Exec For CEO Computer Associates selected John Swainson, a 26-year veteran of IBM, for its CEO. Ending a seven-month search, the troubled computer software company appointed Swainson as the first outsider to run the firm. Swainson replaces Sanjay Kumar, who was forced out earlier this year in an accounting scandal. Since July, Swainson had headed IBM's software sales group. Before that, he ran WebSphere, IBM's middleware suite. Kenneth Cron, a director, had been running CA temporarily. I Majority Of PeopleSoft Shareholders Vote For Deal A majority of PeopleSoft shareholders voted in favor of Oracle's $9.2 billion takeover bid, but PeopleSoft' s board of directors again rejected the offer. Oracle won nearly 61% of PeopleSoft shares, or 229 million of 376 million shares outstand- ing, for a $24-a-share tender offer that expired Nov. 19. Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, called upon PeopleSoft' s board to negotiate a definitive merger agreement. I Bill Adds 20,000 H-1B Visas Up to 20,000 more guest worker visas will be available annually to foreigners who earn advanced degrees in the United States, according to a bill passed by Congress. In a spending bill, Congress agreed to changes that require companies hiring H-1B workers to certify that the worker will not displace a U.S. worker. Businesses have pushed for the change because the year's limit had already been reached. The visas allow for- eign workers to work in the United States for up to six years. I Google Executives Cash Out Some Stock Shares of Google have nearly doubled since its August initial public offering, and executives of the search firm are cashing in. Venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers sold 5.4 million shares at $932 million. And Google co-founders and its CEO also disclosed plans to sell 16.6 million shares, valued at $2.8 billion, over the next 18 months in a diversification plan. Prior to the IPO, most of the parties scaled back their plans to sell stock. I NASD Bars Star Banker For Life The National Association of Securities Dealers barred former star banker Frank Quattrone for life for refusing to testify in a probe of his role in possible document destruction and obstruction of justice. The bar comes as Quattrone tries to appeal his conviction on two counts of obstruction of justice and one count of witness tampering. The NASD had previously fined him $30,000 and suspended him for one year. But it said his conduct was \"egregious\" and impeded an NASD investigation. I GE Wins Key Health Care Contract General Electric won a $200 million con- tract to provide digital-imaging systems to more than 70 British hospitals and clinics as part of the country's $18 billion project to wire its health care system. GE's award over eight years will allow the company to show- case technology to other potential govern- ment customers, as well. I NVIDIA Licenses Intel Technology Intel agreed to license patents and tech- nology that would allow NVIDIA to begin selling chipsets for PCs that use Intel micro- processors. The move opens up a multibil- lion-dollar chipset market to NVIDIA, which had previously been relegated to the 15% of the PC chipset market based on microprocessors from AMD. The compa- nies declined to provide further details, but NVIDIA is reportedly paying Intel royal- ties. The companies said the deal is a broad, multiyear patent cross-license, which lets companies design without fear of being sued by the other. I Kodak Makes Headway In Digital Cameras Eastman Kodak closed in on No. 1- ranked Sony in the digital camera market in the third quarter, according to IDC. Sony delivered 1 million consumer digital cameras in the quarter, only 10,000 more than Kodak. Canon ranked third with 800,000 shipments, followed by Olympus with 585,000. I Intel CEO Upbeat About Next Year Intel CEO Craig Barrett said he expects the chipmaker to report higher revenues in the first half of 2005. Meanwhile, Intel opened a new design center in Bangalore, In- dia, where the company has hired 800 people in the past year to design chips. He said that Intel may open a factory in India, as well. I Yahoo! & SBC Expand Alliance Yahoo! and SBC Communications expand- ed their relationship to allow Yahoo! to offer services on televisions and mobile phones, signaling a milestone in the convergence of the living room and the Internet. The deci- sion came a day after SBC said it would use Microsoft technology to launch video ser- vices over fiber-optic high-speed data lines. Yahoo! had sold cobranded Internet access with SBC since 2001. I Texas Pacific Group Tries Another Turnaround Texas Pacific Group said it agreed to buy Celerity Group, a producer of gas and chemi- cal delivery process modules used to make semiconductors, for an undisclosed sum. TPG assumed debt and will provide debt financing for the venture, which has more than $300 million in sales.

They can also factor in upgrade cycles based on what they've seen at other companies. Chan advises companies to look for a consultant that's familiar with their industry because such individ- uals can often help them create strategic plans based on the suc- cesses that they've seen at other companies in the same field. Process & Purchasing Double-Check Sometimes, an IT department might feel that it's on top of every- thing that needs to be done and has its strategies in place. In that case, a quick check by an outside resource could make sure that's really true. Doug Casey, head of interactive media at Connecticut-based ad agency Martino & Binzer, has been investigating getting a consultant because he wants to make the com- pany' s IT processes more stream- lined. \"I'm taking a step back and looking at where our costs are over the long haul,\" he says. \"It would be nice to have an idea about what we're getting for our money and get long-term agreements in place that don't have to be reviewed year after year.\" Having an outside resource that can look at a company's entire structure is valuable for seeing skill discrepancies, upgrade cost bloat, and trouble spots that could get larger over time. \"A second set of eyes is great,\" says Mike Ryder, president of net- work consulting company Safelink Networks. He compares doing a double-check through consultants to getting a second opinion when a doctor gives out a serious diagnosis. Ryder has been called in to take a look at hardware and software implementations done by techni- cal or support consultants, only to find that what was installed didn't make sense for the company. \"I've found hardware sold to small business customers that was too much for what they needed,\" he notes. \"Worse, I've seen fire- walls that weren't connected properly or didn't have data run- ning through them.\" Data Center Installation Consultants are often brought in during company moves, and for a good reason. When a data center is being built, expanded, or renovated, it pays to employ an expert in areas such as cooling systems, electrical issues, and flooring. Although gen- eral contractors can build a data center to specifications, IT depart- ments should make sure those specs are correct, and for that, a consul- tant can come in handy. Steve Harris, director of data center planning at Forsythe, a Storage & Security The wealth of products avail- able in data storage and security can be gratifying when IT man- agers go shopping. After all, the more products and services there consulting company, says that getting all the pieces put in place properly won't just prevent headaches — it could also protect the company from lawsuits. \"Improperly configured data centers could open a company to liability,\" he says. \"For example, if your customers experience down- time because you didn't put in the right cooling system, they could sue because of lost productivity.\" Also, making sure to get it right in the first place will help a compa- ny scale without fear of overbur- dening the system or squeezing too much equipment into one room. Harris notes that bringing in an expert when doing data center planning is like hiring an architect even when you know what kind of floor plan you want. Not Making Sense Here are some areas where it's better to have in-house help than high- powered consultancy assistance: • Tweaks and improvements to an application that's been created in-house. • Team building among IT department members: This should be done by the IT manager. • User education about software and hardware: Having IT department mem- bers do this creates an atmosphere of trust. • Asset management: It's often easier and more effective to have staff take on this task. \"There are so many competing standards and interoperability issues,\" she says. \"We get many calls from IT managers who just can't keep up with them.\" Nor do they have to, if they're willing to bring in consultants. Consultants don't have allegiances to specific vendors, so they I can make recommendations I that don't favor one type of I solution over another. I are, the more likely that competi- tion will keep prices low. But there's a downside, as well, says Ann Westerheim, president of Massachusetts-based consultancy Ekaru. Outside assistance can help SMEs navigate the maze of cen- tralized management, hosted ser- vices, hardware, and backup sys- tem upgrades. Consultants don't have allegiances to specific ven- dors (and a reference check before hiring them can confirm that's the case), so they can make recommen- dations that don't favor one type of solution over another. If a company needs a simple, tape-based backup instead of a pricey hosted service, Westerheim tells it that. \"There are many areas where a consultant can help, and some- times they only need to be called in for a few hours,\" says Wes- terheim. \"But those hours can make a big difference for a com- pany that's trying to stay on top of their IT needs.\" Global Gateway Services Virtual Booth 4056 • Virtual Product 2005 Singlefin is the ONLY company you need when it comes to protecting, managing and enhancing your existing IT infra- structure.

Go to Page 8, Column 1 The True Cost Of A Consultant When You Bring In Hired Guns, Get A Good Return On Your Investment by Ericka Chickowski The heyday of the IT consult- ing business may be over, but consultants are far from extinct. There is still plenty of need for these hired guns, and more of this demand is coming from small enterprises than ever. But before a business employs another consultant to light a fire under its organization, it should make sure that this arrangement won't burn up too much money. No matter what the situation, consultants are expensive. The total cost of hiring a consultant varies greatly. It depends on the project and who the consultant is: A small developing project done by a solo freelancer is going to be far cheaper than an ERP imple- mentation by one of the big five firms. However, there are certain factors across the board that could affect the TCO of consult- ing. Understanding these will help you better prepare for poten- tial budgeting surprises and even help you find ways to mitigate costs or decide to look for con- sulting alternatives. TCO Considerations When hiring consultants, most people expect to pay the hefty hourly rates associated with these experts. But even when they know what the rate is upfront, they still usually end up over budget at the end of a project. One of the most common cul- prits of this phenomenon is scope creep. Consultants are business people who like to put food on their tables. As such, they tend to find ways to stick around longer than you might need them. In order to prevent inflated consult- ing fees, it is important to clearly define the parameters of your con- sultant' s duties and keeping them strictly on task. If it is a large project that in- volves more than four consultants, it may also be necessary to have a dedicated project manager to guide the endeavor. Consulting project managers can often add to the overall TCO, but hiring one to keep things in order may actually prevent the total hours from piling up due to disorganization. It also allows your own managers to focus on day-to-day tasks. Because times are lean for consulting firms, you might even be able to arrange for a free CPM thrown into the bargain by your consulting vendor to keep your business. Other costs that can surprise IT managers are related to travel and living expenses. Oftentimes the best consultants for the project are from out of town. Be sure to nego- tiate travel and living expenses in concrete terms before the project starts in order to prevent footing the bill for your consultants living it up while in town. The more specific you make your responsi- bilities, the better. Finally, something that can't be concretely added into the TCO but that affects your costs nevertheless is the matter of intellectual property retention. Your contract should clearly state that any intellectual property created by the consultants under your employ belongs to your organization. This can prevent costly legal struggles in the future. In-House vs. Contracting Smaller enterprises generally use consultants to help when staffers are busy or too inexpe- rienced to get a project done. If time is a factor, consultants can usually get a project finished much more quickly than an al- ready-spread-thin employee. However, consultants aren't always necessarily the best choice. Sometimes it can pay greater divi- dends to train an employee to do a new task than to bring in a consul- tant to do it. For example, if you are developing software for the company and you don't plan on holding the consultant on retainer once the application is finished, you may want to train your employee instead of hiring a con- sultant. Once trained, your em- ployee can finish the project and provide long-term maintenance. This can prevent the drawn-out dependence on contractors that often happens in these situations. If you do choose to hire a con- tractor, it pays to know that there are alternatives to simply letting the consultant go on an open me- ter. Many contractors are willing to sign fixed-rate contracts or those based on milestones. Look beyond the traditional methods to save money and aggravation. They're Around For A Reason Consultants may be pricey, but they're still around for a reason. Consultants experienced in special- ized niches can bring real-world knowledge that would take years for your employees to learn. They can bring objective observation to quell organizational infighting, and they can somtimes reinvigorate a tired IT department. Being able to afford one is simply a matter of balancing priorities and picking the right person in your price range. Reducing Consulting Costs According to Forrester analysts Robert McNeill and Pascal Matzke, man- aging IT consulting vendor relationships can cost from 3% to 7% of the contract deal size. These analysts have suggested a few strategies to keep consulting costs in check. They include: Implementing and centralizing vendor management. Companies should task one person with overseeing relationships with consultants and should have a policy document that outlines how a consulting relationship with the company should work from start to finish. Consolidate the number of service providers. You can often get better deals if you use the same contractor to do multiple projects. Look for ways to consolidate at every turn. Construct risk/reward contracts. By creating contracts that pay extra for speedy completion of tasks or a job well done (or that apply monetary penalties in the opposite case), you can better ensure that the contractor will do a good job and that you are getting the most ROI from the project.

The RSA Sign- On Manager provides single sign- on access between Microsoft Windows, client/server, Web or mainframe applications, intranets, and the Internet. Businesses with the Sign-On Manager can also determine what level of authentica- tion is necessary. The Sign-On Manager in password-only mode is currently available with an SRP of $70 per user, while the two-factor authentication version has an SRP of $85 per user. ■ Trend Micro announced it will be broadening its family of Trend Micro Network VirusWall out- break prevention devices with the Network VirusWall 2500 and 300. The Network VirusWall 2500 lets IT managers secure multiple network segments and application servers with a single device, and support for Gigabit Ethernet offers IT security per- sonnel flexibility to defend new high-bandwidth network infra- structures. Trend Micro claims the Net- work VirusWall 300 will guard devices such as ATMs and self- service kiosks that are often hard to protect with customary mea- sures such as server-based or soft- ware solutions. The appliance implements a bi-directional securi- ty barrier that shields customer- facing service machines from becoming the starting point of an internal or external network attack. Per-unit prices for the Network VirusWall 2500 and 300 begin at $7,995 and $325, respec- tively. ■ WatchGuard Technologies unveiled the WatchGuard Gate- way Antivirus for E-mail for its Firebox X suite of security solu- tions. WatchGuard Gateway Anti- Virus for Email was created to offer maximum security and pro- tection for email. The software contains an extensive signature database of over 22,000 signatures of the most active global viruses, and new signatures are available from a high availability server array. WatchGuard also stated it will team with the worldwide open source antivirus community to constantly update its signature database. WatchGuard Gateway Antivirus is also available at a per-appliance licensing price instead of a per-user price, which WatchGuard claims should reduce costs to SMEs purchasing the solution for their Firebox X appli- ances. SERVERS ■ Dell's new PowerEdge 1855 blade servers support the latest technology including dual Xeon EM64T processors, PCI Express, and up to 16GB of DDR2 memory along with redundancy features such as hot-swappable power sup- plies, SCSI hard drives. Dual NICs and Fibre Channel support for SAN provide additional connectiv- ity. The chassis for the PowerEdge 1855 can support 10 blade servers in a 7U rack enclosure, and accord- ing to Dell, can reduce cables by as much as 70%. The chassis starts at $2,999 with each blade server priced at $1,699. A fully populated chassis runs $19,989. ■ Digi International introduced an enhanced Digi One IAP indus- trial device server, which features industrial protocol bridging. Protocol bridging is a Digi tech- nology that enables industrial Ethernet and serial protocols to transparently intercommuni- cate, letting organizations inte- grate MODBUS, Allen Bradley, and ASCII devices such as Programmable Logic Controllers, drives, bar code readers, scales, and RFID devices. In addition to protocol conversion, the Digi One IAP also acts as a traditional device server by allowing any industrial device with a serial port to connect to the Ethernet. Go to Page 10, Column 1 Make The Most Of Leasing Continued from Page 1 lease laptops for its mobile sales force. This meant Elixir didn't have to lay out a significant amount of capital for state-of-the- art equipment it knew would need to be replaced in two years. It also meant that the company's small IT department wouldn't have to worry about maintenance of the leased equipment. IT equipment leases generally vary from 24 to 48 months and offer a wide variety of agree- ments and end-of-lease options. Tax laws consider equipment purchased outright as a capital investment, meaning it will depreciate over a period. Be- cause the average useful life of IT equipment is approximately three years, it's possible that you will have capital tied up in obso- lete equipment. On the other hand, a lease's monthly payment is considered an operating expense. In most cases, this makes lease payments de- ductible for SMEs. In addition to the tax benefits of leasing IT equipment, capital or credit is not depleted by choosing to lease. Of course, it is always a good idea to consult a tax advisor before committing to the terms of any IT equipment lease. Out With The Old, In With The New Leasing IT equipment can guar- antee regular upgrades, as well as obsolete equipment disposal. At the close of most IT equipment leases, SMEs are given the option to either upgrade by exchanging the old stuff and negotiating a new lease, purchasing the equip- ment, or returning the equipment to the vendor. Often vendors will provide a clause to allow the SME to purchase leased equipment at the close of the lease for a reduced amount. End-of-lease terms for purchas- ing the equipment can range from the current market value to dollar buy-outs, which essentially only save the vendors from having to dispose of the equipment them- selves. Unscrupulous leasing companies commonly run scams that require the purchase of the equipment based on their fair- market value. This can lead to large sums of money unexpected- ly due at the close of the lease. Unwanted and outdated equip- ment leads to another advantage of leasing: disposal. Avoiding the costs and management associated with disposing outdated or non- functioning PCs is another big plus of leasing. With the En- vironmental Protection Agency introducing regulations that pre- vent transfer stations, landfills, and combustion facilities from receiving discarded IT equipment, the cost of disposing of a single PC can exceed $400, although out the hard way. During the two years in which it leased its lap- tops, the manuals and paperwork were disposed of, which lead to significant penalties upon the return of the laptops. For one or two systems, these penalties would have been acceptable; Preserving working capital while making predictable monthly payments for critical technology can help keep a stable balance sheet. most other leasing companies offer recycling services for their leased equipment. The Fine Print Despite all the advantages of leasing IT equipment, there is a downside, especially when the details of the contract are over- looked in an effort to secure the lowest rates. Penalties can be levied for a number of reasons leading to unexpected and exces- sive costs. Most leases require the equip- ment be returned to them in good working order with the origi- nal manuals and software that were initially included. Over the course of a long lease, equipment tends to break and manuals get lost. Elixir Technologies found however, the cost for the missing documentation on several leased laptops could have easily pur- chased a full system outright. Understand exactly who is responsible for the maintenance of leased equipment, especially the repair and maintenance time frame, should any problems be encountered. Can critical equip- ment be replaced immediately in the event of a failure? Some leas- ing companies require defective equipment be returned in order to be replaced, which could lead to unexpected downtime. SMEs should also be aware of the logistical issues for the trans- fer of information and applica- tions on leased IT equipment at the close of terms. Returning sys- tems to the leasing company with company data can pose a security risk in addition to racking up additional penalties. Additionally, any customization to leased equipment, such as spe- cialized peripheral cards, memo- ry, etc., must be accounted for and tracked by the lessee. Failure to remove company-owned assets is the SME' s loss. This was another lesson learned at Elixir. Its original leased lap- tops came with 128MB RAM; however, the company soon real- ized that was not sufficient to run its dual operating system configu- rations, and 256MB chips were purchased and installed in the leased machines. At the end of the lease when the laptops were returned, many of the company- owned memory chips were not removed. The leasing company charged penalties because the lap- tops were not returned with the original RAM. The Bottom Line Leasing compared to traditional financing has several advantages for SMEs. Preserving working capital while making predictable monthly payments for critical tech- nology can help keep a stable bal- ance sheet. The big advantage SMEs often overlook is the fact monthly lease payments remain flat against inflation. This actually reduces the cost of financing to you in real dollars.

Go to Page 11, Column 1 Save Your Critical Data Online A Safe Backup Method Is A Business Imperative by Tony Bradley One of the most crucial com- ponents of any corporate security and disaster recovery plan is to back up critical data. After all, data is money. Most network administrators understand the importance of regularly backing up their critical data. Traditionally this has been done using local tape drives attached to individual servers or a networked tape library that can automatically switch its own tapes and handle a much larg- er capacity of data. However, these backup systems are often slow and cumbersome and don't address the need for retaining data off site for recovery in the event of a total catastrophe. \"Analysts estimate nearly 50% of tape-based backups fail to restore correctly, which exposes these businesses to significant risk,\" says Scott Jarr, director of product management at Live Vault. One solution is to use an online, Internet-based backup service. Rather than purchasing equipment and media and configuring and administering it, you can subscribe to a service that lets you back your critical data to remote storage across the Internet. Raghu Kulkarni, a spokesman for Internet-based storage company IBackup, says, \"Online backup sys- tems work just like traditional backups. It does have one very important advantage: Instead of sending your backup files to a tape drive or other [local] media, an online backup system sends [encrypted] files over an Internet connection to a file storage system on an offsite computer.\" Service & Trust Are Key Much of the services offered and the underlying technology is simi- lar among the various companies. The net result is that, like any out- sourcing, choosing a provider of online, Internet-based backup ser- vices comes down to trust. If you are going to entrust the integrity and security of the company's crit- ical and sensitive data to a third party, there must first be a great deal of trust that they can meet the service levels they have agreed to and that the data will be secure. Tim Rice, president and CEO of FilesAnywhere.com, says, \"Businesses shopping for a high- quality service are choosing the company as much as they are the attributes of the service. The end product really is a pure service, and anytime you are buying a ser- vice, your decision focuses on the people that run the service.\" This sentiment is echoed by his competitors. Phil Gilmour, presi- dent and CEO of eVault, says, \"For the small business user, the technology is often assumed. We found over the years that the suc- cess in this market is not just in providing a product or service that works but how easy it is to implement and use and how easy we are to do business with.\" Backups The Old-Fashioned Way If using an online backup service is so simple and easy and ensures the data is protected offsite, why doesn't everybody do it? There are some cons to consider in making the decision to use a third party for backups. Although using an online ser- vice allows you to perform back- ups without the capital expense of purchasing the equipment and media and training to perform the backups in-house, the equipment will eventually be paid for, while a service has a perpetual cost. Another factor is the bandwidth and stability of the network con- nection between the site and the online backup vendor. Above all else is trust and liabili- ty. Regardless of how trustworthy and secure a third-party vendor claims to be, the legal and financial impact of having that data lost or compromised still falls to the com- pany. Serious consideration needs to be given to whether sensitive and critical company data should be trusted to a third party. Backing up critical data is a busi- ness imperative. For some business- es it is even a legal mandate. Best practices suggest that you maintain a current copy of the backup data offsite to recover in case of a cata- strophic data loss. Exploring your options in terms of an online, Internet-based backup solution can help you address many of these concerns all at one time. 1 Online Backup Providers The chart below represents the major players in the online, Internet-based backup arena.

A Consultant Guidebook Focus Piece How To Find The Right Person For Your Project by David Garrett Consultants are often mocked, but despite all the guff they take, a good one can be worth his weight in gold. The trick is knowing how to find one — what to look for, how to interview, and how to draw up a contract and master the other skills that help you find the best consultant for the job. Know Your Needs First, you need to know your own needs. What skills does your project demand? What is your project's scope? They're sim- ple questions, but they're rarely answered by small and midsized enterprises in search of outside help. The result? The consultant they choose tends to dictate the needs and scope of the project in a way that works for him — and his pocketbook. So, before you make a move, draw up a simple statement of scope (a form that lists the extent of your project in depth, including all its products, deadlines, and risks). Do this with care, as you'll give the statement of scope to potential consultants and ask them to make an estimate based upon it. Shop Around With knowledge of your project in hand, it' s time to find the person or team to do it. But where do you start? Only a fool starts with the phone book. True, you can find a hundred consultants in a snap by using the phone book, Google, or Yahoo!. But all you'll find are their names and phone numbers — not their worth or quality. Rather than start your search blindly, ask your colleagues in other firms for recom- mendations. Have they done a project like this in the past? If so, whom did they use? How were the results? Working by word of mouth is sure to find you a better consul- tant than choosing from a random list. If you strike out with your colleagues, call or write the trade group for the field you're working in. Telecom, IT, security, Internet law, and other fields all have guilds that can recommend consultants in your state, and consultants who register with the profession- al body in their field are likely to be better than consultants who don't. The Interview Once you've got a list of consultants, it's time to call them in for an interview (or a series of interviews, if your project is large enough to warrant one). When you meet a consultant, discuss your project in the bluntest of terms. Clarify what needs to be done, what you expect, and what you don't. Offer your statement of scope as a guideline for mak- ing an estimate. And ask to see an estimate in writing in no less than a week. For the rest of the interview, use the CARES guideline written by Diane Kubal of Fulcrum Network (www.fulcrumnet work.com), which hooks up companies with the right consultants for their projects. CARES stands for chemistry, added value, references, enthusiasm, and skill set. First is chemistry. Simply put, do you like the consultant? Can you see yourself work- ing with him for a week, a month, or a year? Employee Or Contractor? The line between consultant and employee can be razor-thin, but you need to walk it expertly to avoid future tax problems. If the answer to these questions is yes, then you have an employee, not a consultant, and you have to pay employment tax on his wages. • Did you train the worker? • Does the worker have to follow your instruc- tions on when, where, and how to work? • Do you offer him benefits, sick pay, or vacation pay? • Do you have exclusive rights to his work, or does he work for other firms, as well? • Do you provide the equipment and facilities the worker needs to finish his contract? • Do you set the worker's hours and decide the order and timing of projects? Next up is added value. What does this candidate bring to your project? Does she have fresh ideas or unique plans? As for your consultant's references, be sure to ask for at least two in your industry. You want a consultant who's worked with people in your field and knows the ground rules you play by. Next is enthusiasm. What's your consul- tant's energy level? Is she glad to work with you, or does this seem to be a job that's too small for her taste? You want a consultant who treats your work like her dream project. And last but not least is skill set. It goes without saying that your consultant must have the skills your project demands. But take the time to measure the depth of his skills. A year's worth of COBOL is worth less than a decade's.
