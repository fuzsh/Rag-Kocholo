        "text": "This paper analyzed the spatial and temporal variat ions of surface relative humidity in Nigeria in the context of clim ate variability and change. The study is based on the data collected from the N igerian Meteorological Agency, Oshodi, Lagos Nigeria for the period rangin g from 1950 - 2012 with variations in data length across the stations. Basi c data consist of monthly mean daily relative humidity values expressed in pe rcent at 0900 hours GMT from 20 meteorological stations spread across diffe rent ecological zones and climate belts in Nigeria. Statistical techniques us ed for the analyses include time series plots, correlation analysis, descriptiv e statistics, Mann-Kendall&#39;s rank correlation tests, bar charts and the least sq uare linear fitting of the linear regression model. These analyses were execut ed using MATLAB 2008, SPSS version 17 and the &#39;R&#39; programming language so ftware packages. The descriptive statistics indicate that the mean and t he coefficient ...\n\nFrom generation to generation man has being faced by the menace of climate change due to the adverse effect it projects. Recently in Nigeria and the world at large beginning and ending of different seasons have become unpredictable and this is attributed to the effects of climate change. No day passes without commentaries on adverse effect of climate change globally and otherwise. Climate change is of two types namely; natural causes (bio-geographical) and the artificial causes (anthropogenic). They thus present unfriendly environmental hazard such as: erosion, drought, desertification, etc. It thus became necessary to carry out a thorough research on the phenomenon of climate change. In this research work, the effects of climate change due to relative humidity and temperature has been considered with reference to southeastern Nigeria in order to deduce trends in relative humidity and temperature. The study has been carried out using meteorological data obtained from the Agro-meteorological unit of National Root Crops Research Institute (NRCRI) Umudike, Abia State, Nigeria.\n\nThis study examined the climatic water balance and aridity in the Western Lithoral hydrological zone of Nigeria. Monthly climatic data from 1976-2015 collected from six Nigeria Metrological Agency (NIMET) stations located in Ikeja, Ibadan, Akure, Abeokuta, Osogbo and Ilorin were used. The climatic variables are rainfall amount, temperature, sunshine hour, relative humidity and wind speed. The FAO Penman-Monteith method was adopted in estimating the potential evapotranspiration (PET). Water balance was determined from PET and rainfall amount. The spatial and temporal pattern of rainfall amount and PET were evaluated using universal kriging interpolation method, Mann-Kendall and regression trend analysis. The results of the Mann-Kendall and regression trend analysis revealed a statistically significant (Z= 2.74, P= 0.005) upward trend in rainfall amount between 1976 and 2015. Similarly, a statistically significant (Z= 4.40, p= 0.001) increasing trend was observed in PET during the same period. Six months of water surplus (May-October) and six months of water deficit (November-April) were identified. Overall, 27 years of water deficit was discovered over the 40 years period. Water balance pattern revealed the highest annual mean water surplus (324.51 mm) in the hinterland of Idanre, Akure, and Owo rather than the coastal city of Ikeja which can be attributed to orographic effect in the hinterland. The study area with a mean Aridity index (AI) of 0.94 can still be regarded as humid environment, although the spatial variability of AI indicates that the northern part is tending towards a dry sub-humid condition (AI= 0.76). This study recommends conservation of water surplus in the wet months for the augmentation of deficit in the dry months; this will not only boost agricultural production, but also alleviate water supply problem in the study area\n\nSpatial trends of rainfall and reference evapotranspiration (ET o ) are crucial for sustainable water resources management. Rainfall and ET o trends were evaluated and estimated using FAO Penman-Monteith model and their spatial distributions were mapped across Southeast Nigeria. Two spatial interpolation techniques, Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and Kriging in ArcGIS were employed for monthly, annual and seasonal rainfall and ET o . Results showed that rainfall increased gradually from North to South while ET o increased from South to North of the study area. ET o was found to be higher during dry seasons as the average rise in temperature within the period of study stood at 1.1%. There was a positive correlation of the predicted results obtained by the IDW and kriging methods with measured rainfall and ET o data, evaluated at R = 0.87(rainfall) and R = 0.83 (ET o ) for IDW method, and R = 0.92 (rainfall) and R = 0.50 (ET o ) for kriging method.
