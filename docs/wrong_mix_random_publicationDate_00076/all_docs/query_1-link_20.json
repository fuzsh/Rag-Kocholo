Box 85518 Lincoln, NE 68501-5518 CHANGE SERVICE REQUESTED April 1,2005 Volume 27 Number 13 www.processor.com Products, News & Information Data Centers Can Trust. Since 1979 Safeguarding & Saving Your Email Why Is It Such A Concern? by David Garrett What happens when email goes down? Now more than ever, the answer is chaos. Planned or unplanned, a sin- gle minute of email downtime can mean a host of annoyed users, angry customers, lost business, and untold thousands or tens of thousands of dollars of soft costs. Simply put, email has become as vital to doing business as telephones, and an email outage is to a business what a stroke is to the body. Consider these stats: A recent study by U.K. firm Creative Networks shows that most com- panies have 85 minutes of unplanned email downtime each month. It affects nearly half the staff (48%, a conserva- tive number) and cuts their pro- ductivity by 20%. Exchange users are even worse off. They have more than 120 minutes of unplanned downtime per month, in which they're 10% less productive. The bottom line? Unplanned Exchange downtime alone costs the average large firm more than $158,000 per year. Fear, Pure & Simple Numbers like these make email down- time a fear of network admins. But why is the threat of lost email so deep? What makes it so strong? In part, it's because email, like it or not, is a crucial office app. More and more it's the way that business is done in the modern enterprise. Merely browse through the email stores of any firm to confirm this; you'll find reams of contracts, plans, project management docs, spreadsheets, financial projec- tions, letters, memos, and more, all shared through email and forming a running palimpsest, a complete record of the way a firm does business. What's more, since Exchange and Notes, the world's most common email apps, both let users share contacts and calen- dars, a firm's common set of phone numbers, contact data, and group schedules are often stored in email programs. Go to Page 6, Column 1 Establishing A Security Office Do You Need A Specialized Staff To Set & Enforce Policy? by Douglas Schweitzer Organizations of all sizes concur: Security is critical. However, small to midsized companies (those with 250 to 1,000 employees) have been known to avoid what they per- ceive to be unnecessary securi- ty expenses — namely, the security office. Mike Podanoffsky, CTO at Sharecube.com, says, \"Many companies, particularly smaller ones, tend to believe that securi- ty issues are for large companies that present the most visible and lucrative targets. They hope that they cannot be found by being largely inconspicuous.\" The reality is that the Internet does not differentiate smaller from larger companies. If you're connected, you're ex- posed. \"The average time between when an unpatched system is placed on a public network and when it is success- fully compromised is four min- utes. Therefore, everyone is a target,\" adds Podanoffsky. According to Ken M. Shaur- ette, an information security solutions manager for MPC Solutions, \"Any organization as large as 250 to 1,000 employ- ees is certainly large enough to need a position and security strategy that addresses a holis- tic and defense-in-depth ap- proach to security in order to manage security risk and re- duce exposures.\" Providing for adequate measures that show proper levels of due diligence in order to minimize an organi- zation' s, and ultimately execu- tive management's, liability is supremely important. Staffing The Office Establishing a security office requires staffing it with appro- priate personnel. When organi- zations appoint employees already on staff for new posi- tions in an onsite security office, they must bear in mind Go to Page 7, Column 1 The reality is that the Internet does not differentiate smaller from larger companies. In This ISSUE COVER FOCUS Email Disaster Recovery When it comes to backup and disaster recovery, files are tough to back up and recover, databases are tougher, but email is next to impossible given that it's almost always doing a read or write somewhere.

Under terms of the ruling, Microsoft must make its Windows server source code more easily available to pro- grammers and produce a Windows Media Player- free version of Windows. The com- mission is investigating whether the Media Player-free version is as compatible with other software as the full version of Win- dows. As part of the original settlement, Microsoft also was to nominate a nonparti- san trustee to monitor its compliance with the ruling; the EU has rejected Microsoft's proposal to limit the powers of this trustee. I Business, IT Leaders Differ On Innovation Many companies risk growth opportuni- ties because their IT groups don't effective- ly respond to company needs, according to a study conducted by consulting firm A.T. Kearney. About 75% of the respondents say the best technology ideas in their com- panies don't originate in the IT department. And while more than 65% of business executives say IT innovation is important or critical to their company's success, typi- cally only 20% of a company's IT invest- ment is spent on innovation. One other noteworthy figure: 25% of those surveyed say their IT and business planning are fully integrated — that's down 7% from a similar survey conducted in 2002. I Ask Jeeves Purchased For $1.85 Billion InterActiveCorp bought the Ask Jeeves search engine for $1.85 billion, hoping to move into the Web search market through the deal. Ask Jeeves, which joins Ticketmaster, Expedia, and more than 40 other specialized consumer brands in the travel, retailing, ticketing, personals, media, financial services, real estate, and teleser- vices industries at IAC, will remain an independent brand. The search engine reported revenue of $261.3 million in 2004. I Dell Ends White-Box Program Dell announced it will end its white-box initiative; it has already stopped selling the 510D and 610D, its two white-box desktop systems. The decision to end the program was based on feedback from solution providers. Ending the program, says Dell, will help to emphasize Dell-branded systems in the solution-provider channel. Dell will continue to maintain the Solutionprovider direct.com Web site and supply parts to white-box solution providers. I Oracle To Acquire Retek Oracle will buy retail software and services firm Retek for an estimated $650 million. Oracle and rival SAP had been engaged in a bidding war for Retek since late February. SAP, which had offered $11 per share, dropped out of the bidding when Oracle agreed to pay $11.25 per share. Retek, which has about 525 workers, reported sales of $174.2 million in 2004. I Enterprises Not Equipped For IM Attacks Almost 50% of companies have no policy covering the use of instant messaging and peer-to-peer programs at work, according to a study conducted by SurfControl. Com- panies with no IM policy are vulnerable to a number of emerging security threats deliv- ered via IM. A similar study conducted by the American Management Association found that 78% of workplace IM users had downloaded free IM software from the Internet, even though few organizations advocate using IM. SurfControl issued a number of guidelines designed to keep enterprises safe from IM threats, including establishing a policy on the appropriate use of IM in the workplace, advising employees to never follow a link in an unsolicited IM, and implementing a filtering tool. I Dell Intends To Hire In India, Europe After opening its third Indian call center, Dell announced it plans to employ up to 1,500 people at the call center within a year. Dell currently employs more than 7,000 people in India; the new center opened with about 300 employees. Chair- man Michael Dell says the company will also build a manufacturing facility in Eastern Europe, its second in the area. By turning to outsourcing, industry analysts say companies such as Dell typically reduce their costs by up to 50%. I Oracle Profits Down, Sales Up After PeopleSoft Takeover Oracle reported that its quarterly net profits fell 15%, reflecting costs incurred in its acquisition of PeopleSoft. Sales for the quarter were $2.95 billion, an increase of 18%. Despite the profit drop, Oracle executives remain optimistic. CFO and Co-President Safra Catz told reporters the company was \"thrilled\" with the quarter. The news came the day after the company completed its purchase of software maker Retek. (See the \"Oracle To Acquire Retek\" news item above.) I Visual Studio & SQL Server Delayed Microsoft announced the release timeta- bles of Visual Studio 2005 and SQL Server 2005 have been pushed back. Both prod- ucts, originally expected to appear this summer, will instead ship late this year. The company also released pricing details for Visual Studio 2005. The Professional Edition will retail for $799 ($549 upgrade); the Standard Edition will cost $299 ($199 upgrade). The Express Edition will sell for $49. (For more on this topic, see Bill Vaughn's column on page 23 of this issue.) I Rambus, Infineon Settle Dispute Rambus and Infineon settled a patent dis- pute dating back to 2000, granting each other licenses to their technologies. In addi- tion, Infineon will pay Rambus $5.85 mil- lion each quarter for two years. Earlier this year, a federal judge dismissed Rambus' claims because the company reportedly destroyed documents related to the case.

Among these, one of the most harrowing kinds of experience is the loss of an email system and everything stored on it. Nothing makes users cry louder than being yanked from their email capability. But a scary story doesn't have to have a sad ending. Here's a trio of tales from companies that hit hard times and lived to tell about it. Power Struggle San Jose-based Power Integra- tions, a supplier of high-voltage analog integrated circuits, has over 90GB of email stored, and when the company began experi- encing intermittent problems with the server, the IT depart- ment got nervous. Power Integrations had been using a tape backup solution, but the IT department was increas- ingly uncomfortable with recov- ering from tape with every mail server failure. The weekly full backups took more than 50 hours to complete, and whenever the server would have problems, the recovery took more than a day. Having 300 employees wait while recoveries were performed became tiresome and dangerous for productivity. \"We desperately needed a better way to do backup,\" says Graham Bennett, the company's IT direc- tor. \"As an engineering company, we have a lot of crucial informa- tion going over email. We knew that would just increase in the future, and if we stuck with what we were doing, a real disaster would strike eventually.\" After considering a number of options, Power Integrations agreed to be a pilot customer for a new company, Data Domain, last April. The IT department was Recovery Center Centerstone Software, a Hop- kinton, Mass., -based developer of corporate real estate software, skeptical at first because it was dealing with an unproven compa- ny, but after a trial run with Data Domain's DD200 recovery appli- ance, they became believers. Power Integrations backed up the operating system, mail server software, and mail data to the DD200. Now the recovery win- dow has decreased from 14 hours to four, and full backup is done in a day and a half, not three days. \"I wanted to go with the big guys,\" Bennett remembers. \"I'm happy I was wrong.\" faced some of the same issues as Power Integrations. System fail- ures sent the IT department scram- bling to do fast recovery, but Damien Stefanidis, the company's director of client services, notes that problems often meant a com- plete manual rebuild of the sys- tem. \"This consumed significant amounts of time and resources, the two things that are always in short supply,\" he says. To do backup, Stefanidis relied on Windows Backup for Mi- crosoft Exchange and Veritas' Backup Exec for tape backups. He found that the Windows Backup didn't provide a granular level of recovery, such as an indi- vidual mailbox or a single email. And, although he praises the Veritas product, the company was still struggling with backups due to the volume of data, limited after-hours staff, and reduced server performance. Stefanidis contemplated replacing the exist- ing tape drives with higher capac- ity drives or a tape library, but the options were too expensive and wouldn't alleviate the perfor- mance impact that was incurred during backups. After considering a number of products, Stefanidis chose Xchange Restore and Xpress Restore from FilesX, software- based email recovery products that had the kind of granularity that Centerstone wanted. The FilesX system could take a snapshot of an Exchange server and do a restore Get On Track Denase Harris, president of Pokola, Okla., -based Diversified Computer Resources, had the kind of day no one should have to experience: The company's pri- mary server hard drive and tape backup system failed simultane- ously, making it impossible to access customer data, including email. It was considered a cata- strophic failure, with massive cor- ruption in the company's RAID level drive. \"It was a really bad situation to put it mildly,\" Harris says. \"We could restore some email and data, but not all of it. There were months of missing information.\" Even more frustrating, only one person could access the company database off the local copy at a time, slowing customer service to a painful crawl. To recover the lost data, Harris chose data recovery service San Jose-based Power Integrations, a supplier of high-voltage analog integrated circuits, has over 90GB of email stored, and when the company began experiencing intermittent I problems with the server, the IT I department got nervous. down to a single email if needed. That's what sold Stefanidis on the products. \"Before if I needed to restore Exchange data, I had to go through an extremely painful process of building a secondary server and then struggling with restoring our data to it,\" he says. \"Now the whole process can be performed in less than five minutes and I never have to leave my desk.\" Ontrack, which located the miss- ing information and email and restored the system in about two days. Harris liked going with a service, rather than trying to do the recovery herself, because she felt it would be much faster and more thorough. \"You really have not planned for the worst case scenario unless you have a clear plan for data recovery, should everything else fail,\" she says. Safeguarding & Saving Your Email Continued from Page 1 Why? With facts like these, one has to ask why email has become the master app of the enterprise. And one reason, sadly, is user ignorance. Although it's simpler, faster, and far more efficient to store docs on the network and send colleagues links to those docs, most users like to attach files to email and send them back and forth through Exchange and Notes. It's a technique they know and trust. What's more, most users' file stores, whether they're kept on the network or on their local hard drives, are chaotic at best. Files are rarely named with a standard con- vention, and they're even less often parceled into folders and subfolders for easy access. As a result, users turn to email as their default file store; they know, by and large, whom they sent a file to and when, and because of the advanced search and sort features of most email apps, it's simpler for users to find a lost document in their email than on the network drive. Head To Head: Exchange vs. Notes According to a 2002 study by The Radicati Group, Exchange, Microsoft's kingpin entry in the email world, is three times more costly in terms of downtime than rival Lotus Notes, produced by IBM. To ensure fairness, the study was jointly sponsored by Microsoft and IBM. It researched the down- time costs of both email systems on large corporate networks and found that Notes, while far less pricey in terms of downtime, also had a higher cost of administration, resulting in a nearly equal TCO for both systems. An Open Problem But for all this, email backups are infa- mous for their inefficiency, complexity, and unreliability. Why? In part it's because of the nature of backups themselves. After all, most back- ups follow a simple rule: In order to move data to a tape or disk, the data must not be in use at the time. But email is one of the few office apps that's never, ever idle. Whether it's 2 p.m. or 2 a.m., someone is online, checking and sending email. And for this reason alone, few email backups are ever fully complete. They may contain most of the email store, but they rarely, if ever, contain all of it. What's more, the Web is replete with nightmares of email failures, left by help- less, frantic admins in chat rooms and mes- sage boards where an expert might be able to explain why Exchange simply dropped its public folders without a hint of explana- tion. And a simple Google search on \"Ex- change backup\" or \"Notes backup\" will re- turn dozens of companies that offer third- party solutions to the problem, proof enough that backing up and restoring email with the utilities that email vendors offer by default is a tricky business at best. Is there a solution to all these prob- lems? Other articles in this issue will assess tactics for email backup, from online to offline, onsite to offsite. Which is best for you, of course, is a choice only you can make. How Much Downtime? How much downtime can a company afford? And does it vary by app or industry? Recent years have seen millions of dollars spent on researching this question. And while there's no magic number, there are hundreds of stats that are all but comforting: • The META Group reports that IT downtime costs American firms $1 million an hour in the aggregate. • META also puts the potential hourly loss in revenue at $1,107,274 for a retail firm, $996,802 for a bank, $643,250 for a utility, and $636,030 for a hospital or other health- care concern. • According to Gartner, 40% of companies struck by severe data loss are out of busi- ness within five years. April 1,2005 Processor.com Establishing A Security Office Continued from Page 1 that a security policy is key to ensuring that unit managers and process owners are ful- filling their responsibilities, especially when applying security to their realm of responsibility. A key attribute required of the person(s) in charge of the security office is communication ability. They may not actually be the ones implementing or enforcing the security controls, but they do need to be the ones overseeing what is being done and communicating within every level of the organization. Steve Crutchley, president and CTO of 4FrontSecurity, says, \"When it comes to deciding who is responsible for security, one must look closely to the organization, its past and, very importantly, its future.\" Understanding the business objectives, mis- sion, and needs is critical. Your company's security office (typically the IT department team) must develop a security policy that extends throughout the organization. \"That policy must be approved and adopt- ed by executive management. The policy sets the tone at the top, illustrating how important security is and whether the organization takes it seriously,\" says MPC's Shaurette. Says Crutchley, \"Policy also ensures process alignment across the organization, and policy should clearly state what is required by each process owner or unit manager when it comes to compliance. The days of asking, 'Are we compliant? Do we have security in place?' are long gone. We now continue the conversation and say, 'Prove it.' \" At minimum the office should be respon- sible for asking the right questions about the security activities of the organization: Are they adequate? Are they reasonable? Do they match accepted practices for other organizations of similar size, in the same type of industries, with similar assets and with risks much like our organization's? Office Duties Responsibilities of the security office include establishing policies and regulations, as well as ensuring compliance with stated security policies. The security office will also oversee the collection of objective evi- dence when security auditing is taking place. To ensure these duties are carried out acceptably, Crutchley says, \"There should be a Risk and Self Assessment program that provides management and staff a methodology for reporting back and ensur- ing compliance on a regular or predefined time basis. This will help the security orga- nization understand the business posture day-to-day.\" Responsibilities of the security office include establishing policies and regulations, as well as ensuring compliance. What happens if the organization opts to pare down expenses and, in so doing, comes up short on security? \"Federal sentencing guidelines are pretty clear that doing nothing increases the amount of executive liability,\" says Shaurette. \"If the organization is doing their best, can document that fact, and shows they are taking some reasonable steps to pro- vide security over information they have been entrusted, the liability will be reduced.\" And when it comes to leadership, the persons in charge of the security office can vary greatly. Their selection may create a lot of debate; just about everyone has a strong opinion in this area. Questions to consider include: Does the person need to have a four-year or maybe even a master's degree in business? Should he or she have a degree in IT? Is a degree really needed if the person can demonstrate competence, especially when it comes to the delicacy of security and communications? In-House Or Outsource? Security involves a highly specialized expertise. While system administrators do generally keep up to date with various security issues, companies should not rely solely on their casual knowledge to secure their systems. Instead, they should develop a security audit plan and actually measure their own effectiveness. They must address the following central questions: What is their security exposure? How is it being addressed? Do they have the right talent in-house to address these issues, and how can they verify their con- clusions through an independent third party? This is where outsourcing may be the better option for SMEs. Sharecube.com' s Podanoffsky agrees. \"Companies would do better to select a ver- ifying third party than to staff an in-house security office,\" he says. \"The qualifications of the professionals involved are key to a security audit. A security audit will identify all systems that pose a risk, then measure or test how well they are protected followed by specific actions required to protect these systems in the long run.\" Indeed, for some organizations a sepa- rate, specialized, and experienced third party is best suited for maintaining the enterprise's security. This is especially true Page 7 in instances where a skilled workforce can- not be easily maintained within the organi- zation solely for that purpose. Nevertheless, if properly trained person- nel are in place, such a staff will arguably have an even greater interest in ensuring the security needs of its employer, as opposed to the needs of merely one of its clients. Security Office Checklist A security office is established so that the organization can consolidate and assign security responsibilities to a single entity. The security office determines and develops poli- cy, ensures that employees are informed of security policies, and coordinates all security resources throughout the organization. Setting up the security office requires the following: □ Hiring or assigning employees to staff the office □ Identifying and naming the responsibilities of each staffer's position □ Delineating a hierarchy for incidence and other security reporting □ Determining the financial resources that will need to be allocated to run the office □ Naming known critical risk areas of the organization and providing workarounds Once the security office has been set up, the organization should ensure that it addresses the following tasks: □ Adequately training employees □ Informing employees relative to security matters and providing security certification □ Testing the system for breaches □ Incident detection □ Incident reporting □ Identity management MDU Access Concentrator VDSL Secure Routing Switch Virtual Booth 3936 • Virtual Product 1824 Virtual Booth 4163 • Virtual Product 2148 ► Supports 8/24-Port ADSL II+ Multi-service line cards with built in splitters & 8-port DMT VDSL 4 band line cards with built-in splitters ► Supports 14-port 10/1 OOMbps Fast Ethernet line cards ► Supports 4-pair fiber optic media converters line cards ► Full system management line cards ► Optional redundant power supply VERSA Technology, Inc. 471 1 Chino Avenue Chino, CA 91710 Phone:(909)591-8891 Fax:(909)591-6962 WEB: www.versatek.com EMAIL: sales@versatek.com Network Management Virtual Booth 4067 • Virtual Product 2025 -«ss:;: Alremote delivers intelligence and control from your remote network.

In corporate America, billions of email messages are exchanged every day. This vol- ume puts a tremendous strain on data center resources. New regulations that require businesses to store, archive, and be able to quickly retrieve digital information are putting an even greater strain on resources and data center administrators. For- tunately, vendors are focusing on the problem and launching products specifically designed for email backup and recovery. Although no product can make your email backup and recovery tasks go away completely, you'll feel better knowing you have tools in place to help your busi- ness stay in compliance. A Growing Marketplace Market research firm Yankee Group (\"Message Archiving: Bridging Security and Storage Markets,\" August 2004) predicts revenue for email archiving solu- tions will grow from $140 million in 2003 to $420 million in 2008. A huge driver for this market growth is the growing number of regulations, including Sarbox, HIP A A, and others, that business- es must comply with. Let's take a look at some of the main marketplace players in this arena. EMC/Legato EmailXtender. In October 2003, EMC finalized its acquisition of Legato, a soft- ware company specializing in email archiving, data protec- tion/recovery, and storage man- agement applications. Industry watchers saw the move as a way for EMC to add a portfolio of storage applications to its catalog of storage hardware. As a result, EMC now offers a couple of email retention and man- agement applications called Email- Xtender Archive and Email- Xtender. As with other product offerings, EMC/Legato' s applica- tion automatically moves content from email and instant messaging servers into online storage where the content is indexed and stored for later retrieval. EmailXtender extends Archive's capabilities by enabling the appli- cation of corporate policy-based rules to messaging content. For example, using policies to manage content allows administrators to assign message retention schedules based on content. The software also includes what EMC calls PST migration tools designed to elimi- nate the proliferation of unman- aged PST files. EmailXtender goes beyond Archive's capabilities by allowing the storage and management of email as a \"record of business.\" While Archive automatically moves messages to online storage and indexes content to facilitate later searching, EmailXtender also performs message lifecycle management and PST migration and features enhanced legal dis- covery capabilities. EmailXtender works on Ex- change, Notes/Domino, Bloom- berg Email, Unix Sendmail, and instant messaging applications. EmailXtender Archive works only on Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Notes/Domino. iLumin Assentor Enterprise. iLumin' s Assentor Enterprise suite is composed of four components: Archive, Discovery, Compliance, and Mailbox Manager. As with the EMC/Legato application, the Assentor suite is designed to pro- vide archiving, mailbox manage- ment, and content indexing and categorization in one package. The Assentor Archive supports Microsoft Exchange, Novell Group- Wise, Lotus Notes, Bloomberg Mail, and other popular email sys- tems. The software automatically captures all email and instant mes- saging content and is compatible with various types of optical-, tape-, and disk-based storage devices. Assentor' s Mailbox Manage- ment module allows users to access archived email via an inte- grated email client or Web-based interface. The goal is similar to that of other products: per- form automated email archiving formats, including PST or NSF, or results can be formatted as PDF files and printed. The Compliance module is de- signed to create workflows that without taking away users' access to email content. The Discovery module allows complex searches of email ar- chives. Search results can then be exported to various email archive enable the monitoring of messages by compliance reviewers. The reviewers can then take action whenever a particular message contains questionable, possibly noncompliant content. Messages The Tale Of The Tape The applications we covered in the previous pages are just a few of the large number of email archiving and backup products available today. The chart below summarizes the features for the products we discussed above and also gives you contact information. In most cases, pricing depends on the size of installation and the number of licenses you need.

Assentor Compliance also allows the addition of comments to email messages and logs all actions taken for a particular message. Sherpa Software Attender. Sherpa Software's Archive Attend- er is an automated email archiving tool for moving information out of email servers and into alternative storage locations. Archive Attender allows administrators and even users to set up archiving schedules through a Web-based interface based on message age, location, and size. Administrators are also able to grant individual users archiving rights, so everyday users can set up their own archiving schedules and manage their archives as they see fit. Archive Attender, as with other featured products, also allows the viewing of archived messages via Outlook or Outlook Web Access. Sherpa' s Mail Attender For Ex- change, Enterprise Edition com- bines three Sherpa products (Mail Attender for Exchange v.2.x, PST Attender, and PST Attender for Desktops) into one application. With this enterprise package, administrators get policy-based information management, statisti- cal reporting, content management and searching flexibility, and stor- age management. Veritas Enterprise Vault. In August 2004, Veritas purchased email archiving software developer KVault Software, acquiring KVS' Enterprise Vault email archiving application. Enterprise Vault performs automated, policy-controlled archiving of email to online stor- age. According to Veritas, the software automatically archives email messages and attachments from email servers. Information contained in user inboxes is still available via shortcuts, so users maintain access to their informa- tion while offloading the archiv- ing duties to the software. The product preserves users' folder hierarchies when email archives are backed up, so organi- zations are able to eliminate un- controlled, ad-hoc data storage in the form of email client archive files (such as Exchange PST or Notes NSF files) managed by indi- vidual users. Veritas has also developed two specialized versions of Enterprise Vault aimed at litigation support, dispute resolution, and industry- specific regulatory compliance. Both applications (Discovery Ac- celerator and Compliance Accel- erator) allow businesses to review, identify, mark, and locate messages based on content. Information Management: Beyond Simply Storage To maintain compliance, it is extremely important to effectively manage the flow, content, and stor- age of information. It is no longer sufficient to archive information and forget about it; the content and context must be understood well enough so that information can be easily retrieved. Even if your business only faces a minimal regulatory burden you're not off the hook. All it takes is one lawsuit and a barrage of discovery requests to severely test your infor- mation management system. April 1,2005 Processor.com Page 9 Managed Services, Email-Protection Style Just Knowing The Options Available To You Is Half The Battle by Chris A. MacKinnon Make no mistake about it, email is a critical business facet. But when email accounts and messages become corrupted or backups fail, lessons are learned the hard way. Having a sound email backup and recovery plan in time is paramount to busi- ness continuity. The good news is that you aren't without options. There are several national service companies that can help a small to medium-sized enterprise with email backup and recovery. Companies can choose from an email service buffet includ- ing outsourcing and in-house, do-it-your- self software. Outsourcing email control to managed service companies is becoming mainstream in the field of email protection. Christopher Furey, CEO for IT services company Savvy Networks, says, \"Due to the new file stor- age applications of email groupware sys- tems, the skill, training, and technology needed to protect these complex systems are more critical than ever. Email resides on the server, and the servers themselves often cannot be stopped or taken down for main- tenance. Protecting email systems today is a specialty discipline best left to experts who are familiar with the proper tools for the job and understand the process.\" Outsourcing email services relieves the onus of having to do it in-house. Most email backup and recovery solutions are conveniently done online, and many national service companies are helping to address business-specific regulatory com- pliance issues posed by government and industry regulations. The Options Online backup is done across the Inter- net or over VPNs. This popular form of email backup is convenient, reliable, auto- mated, and (best of all) fast. Backing up email to traditional server and tape-based systems takes longer and is typically more cumbersome. Email archiving is also being done online. Software is usually installed on an email server, which grabs outdated email and ships it offsite via the Internet to a data warehouse for archiving. If access to outdated email is necessary, message retrieval from an email server is easily done through a Web browser or compatible email application. The recovery aspect of email protection depends on the size of the information being restored. Online recovery is a great option for smaller recoveries, but for the larger recoveries, D2D (disk-to-disk) meth- ods and tape media are called in. Advantages/Disadvantages There are, of course, advantages and disadvantages to managed email services for the SME. \"The biggest advantage to managed backup services is the customer who usually has a trained backup adminis- trator assigned to ensure the nightly back- up is completing successfully. Statistics show even 50% of properly backed up sys- tems fail upon restore from tape; managed backup can really stack the odds of a suc- cessful recovery in the favor of the cus- tomer,\" says Furey. Jim Reinert, senior director of software and services for Ontrack Data Recovery, adds, \"Utilizing a managed email service is one less thing an SME has to worry about, support staff to assist in the setup and man- agement of offsite backup for Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Small Business Server, Novell GroupWise, Lotus Domino, and Oracle-based messaging systems. Savvy's partners assist customers with the onsite recovery process right in the cus- tomer's office if necessary. so convenience is a huge factor. In most cases, a managed email service will have more expensive equipment than an SME could afford, so an SME is getting a more reliable service that will provide better pro- tection for their data.\" But there are disadvantages, too. Reinert says, \"The disadvantages of using a man- aged email service include dealing with mailbox size quotas for every user, which causes employees to delete messages and can put a strain on communication. It's important that SMEs read the fine print when it comes to restoring old email, as there could be complications. The email service might charge a fee for restoring messages or might not be able to restore anything at all. SMEs need to be aware of what they're getting with their service.\" Furey agrees. \"The biggest disadvantage to managed offsite backup can be the increased recovery time that is typical when large data amounts need to be restored. This problem is inherent in online backup ser- vices because data restoration time is limit- ed by the speed of the customer's broad- band connection, which means a complete message store recovery can take many hours or even days to accomplish,\" he says. The Options At Work Knowing your options is part of the battle, but implementing them is para- mount. Here are a few prominent compa- nies that provide email backup and recov- ery services. Savvy Networks. Savvy Networks offers a service called SavvySafe, which supports managed offsite backup of most POP3 and IMAP email systems. The com- pany supports the more complex group- ware platforms and has specially trained Ontrack Data Recovery. Ontrack Data Recovery offers an email recovery soft- ware called PowerControls. The software copies and searches mailbox data straight from an unmounted Exchange database file. PowerControls restores message-level items from any previous full backup. PowerControls provides an easy-to-use interface allowing drag and drop on mail- boxes and messages from source to desti- nation. The program also features a com- mand line interface for batching repetitive processes such as multiple copy and export tasks. Live Vault. InSync from LiveVault is a data protection system that combines disk-based backup capabilities with auto- matic data transfer features (offsite using a secure network connection). The email service, which is geared for small and medium-sized companies, provides the full gamut, automating and integrating data backup, offsite storage, archiving, and recovery. The service features an optional onsite LiveVault TurboRe- store appliance for quick recovery of local data. InSync is available as a subscrip- tion service. EVault. EVault provides offsite data backup, recovery, and archival solutions. EVault' s ProMail is a complete, Web- based managed service solution that cap- tures, monitors, and archives email and instant messaging. The service features quick online retrieval of any email, plus complete message encryption and built-in security access to archived messages. EVault offers pay-as-you-go managed services, as well as licensed software solutions. With backup and recovery options from such companies as those mentioned here, your email will be in tip-top shape. While you're at it, you may want to round out your email protection with email security services. But that's another whole page full of options.

A recent MET A Group survey showed that eight out of 10 business users said that email is more important to them than the telephone. Folks get cranky with anything less than 100% uptime and more than 0% data loss when it comes to email. Today's email backup and recovery solutions are largely soft- ware-dependent. But an expensive email recovery solution is nothing without reliable hardware. If the drive you're storing backups on breaks and you have no redundan- cies built in, it doesn't matter how sophisticated your backup software is. You're still left with no data. As the storage demands of email increase, the importance of solid hardware will continue to grow. Today the average corpo- rate email user processes 10MB of email a day, and that is expected to grow by more than 50% in the coming years, according to The Radicati Group. Storage Networking, The Ideal Technology Storage networking is, of course, on any administrator's wish list in the ideal world. Setting up a NAS or SAN can help eliminate worry over failure points and can help end storage woes in pain points beyond email backups. SANs in particular will allow for built-in redundancy with remote mirroring, storage scalability should the number of email users rise rapidly, and greatly improved band- width performance. SAN. A SAN is an inde- pendent network of devices that makes data available at the block level rather than the file level. For high-traffic email backing up and archiv- ing, a SAN can be ideal because it is less likely to clog the LAN than NAS sys- tems in high volume situa- tions. It also can more easily handle heterogeneous storage systems, allowing you to back up snapshots on disk, archive messages on tape, and handle the rest of your backups with little trouble. Many SMEs are loathe to in- stall a SAN due to infrastructure requirements — for most it is just not feasible to go to Fibre Channel yet. Ever the knight in shining armor to smaller businesses, Dell has recently released an IP-based SAN server that eliminates the Fibre Channel problem. The Dell/ EMC AXlOOi uses iSCSI technol- ogy to maximize savings and ben- efits of an entry-level SAN. Re- leased in February, the server is available for $4,999. It is no mistake that Dell teamed up with EMC for that offering, as EMC is a known leader in SAN hardware. If you want to cut out the middlemen, go directly with an EMC system that includes the drives. EMC's Clariion CX300i is also an iSCSI-based SAN that comes configured with five 73 GB drives, software, and three years of service for $23,860. For those businesses that need ultimate flexibility with their stor- age array, the NetApp FAS200 is an affordable choice. You can use it with either Fibre Channel or 2000s are suited for the job. The systems were designed to consoli- date Exchange Server data and iSCSI SAN equipment and have the choice between file-level and block-level data access. Starting at $27,500 for one enclosure with 14 drives, it is competitive in the SAN market. NAS. Network-attached stor- age is much simpler to install out of the box than a SAN, as it is simply a set of storage devices attached to a gateway server that then hooks into the network. To the administrator it looks like one big drive. Setting up a NAS for email backups can be especially useful if you are a smaller busi- ness that can't afford a complicat- ed SAN setup but are running multiple email machines and would like to consolidate and simplify backup storage. Or per- haps you have simple email back- up demands, but you'd like to consolidate all of your backups onto one storage system. In any event, if you are looking for a NAS system specifically tai- lored for email continuity, HP's StorageWorks NAS 1200s and will directly support the Exchange Server 2003 Feature Pack. The 1200s start at $2,495, while prices for the 2000s begin at $5,800. Another affordable option is the Snap Server 4500. With 1TB of storage and 512MB of RAM, this NAS system has a starting price of $5,795. If you would like to imple- ment RAID arrays in the NAS layer but have limited experience setting these up, the 4500 comes equipped with a RAID wizard that greatly simplifies the process. The included software also facilitates snapshots for quick restores. For those departments looking for the flexibility of a NAS but the scope and power of a SAN, one option is BlueArc's Titan Silicon- Server, a sort of clustered NAS system that can achieve near-SAN performance. The price tag isn't cheap though; configurations start at $40,000. Other Possibilities When it comes to email backups, companies without the resources to put together a storage network are usually looking for economical ways to implement recovery so- lutions. Inevitably, the two options that come up most are RAID arrays and tape-based solutions. RAID. The allure of using RAID for email backups is a result of the first word in the acronym: redundancy. RAID arrays can give administrators warm fuzzy feelings of se- curity when it comes to the dependability of email back- ups. RAID 10 is a particular favorite because it stripes data across multiple disks and mir- rors the data as well so that if there is an error in a data block on one disk it can still be recovered on another. Still, RAID really isn't de- signed to be a replacement solu- tion for email backups. The idea is that RAID can help improve email uptime by reducing the number of times that your chosen backup media is necessary to restore the system. But there are a number of reasons why RAID shouldn't be used alone for email backups. The most critical is that RAID provides no fail-safes to mitigate the danger of data loss through user error. Equally lacking is the ability to easily remove the array from the system and store it in a safe place offsite — unless the array is under a storage net- work layer, in which case remote backups are possible. But if this is the case, there are plenty of options available due to your robust infrastructure. When connected directly to the email server, RAID backups will take longer than when connected to a storage network, and more Go to Page 11, Column 1 TalkSwitch by CENTREP0INT TECHNOLOGll Hybrid PSTN and VOIP Together as One for Small and Medium Business Big Business Phone System without the cost • Seemlessly connect Remote Offices and Remote Employees together using VoIP or regular PSTN lines • Maintain in-office functionality - even if you're at an off-site (or cell- phone) location • Answer your calls with sophisticated mutli-level auto-attendants and dial-by-name directories... and much more TalkSwitch was built on an idea so simple it's revolutionary; that small businesses deserve telephone systems that are as sophisticated and as powerful as big business systems / but without the big business prices.

You could also end up with a higher storage TCO because mirroring with RAID 10 inevitably eats up more drive space than expected. Another Achilles heel of RAID arrays for email backup is that of disk failure. If a disk totally quits, you could have a problem. And if more than one disk quits, you are in big trouble. Nevertheless smaller businesses that don't have the money to spend and are willing to bet on their karma (there have to be multiple points of failure to foil a RAID system using mirroring) will find RAID attractive. In these cases, it wouldn't hurt to use RAID in conjunction with occasional backups on media such as tapes or optical media in order to keep your bases covered. One inexpensive option for a direct- attached RAID system is the LaCie Biggest F800. The device starts at $1,499 for 1TB and supports RAID levels 0, 0+1, 5, and RAID 5+hot spare. Tape. The autumn years of tape are upon us. Disk space has gotten so affordable that tape is slowly being dropped in favor of disk-based backup solutions. Plus, tape backup systems require a lot more manpow- er to store, manage, and implement. But if you have tape equipment readily available or can find a great deal on it, it can still be put to use when it comes to email systems. Unfortunately, as a first line of defense for backing up email, the technology is so slow that it is impractical to use tapes alone. Because of slow deployment times, it would be difficult to ensure continuity during an email outage. Instead, the technology is best used as a supplement to disk-based email backups and to help archive important mes- sages in order to comply with government regulations. One of the biggest benefits of tapes is their portability. If used in conjunction with disk-based solutions, a business could feasi- bly back up email files continuously on disk and infrequently on tape. The tapes could be stored off site in the event that a major disas- ter destroys the disk-based system. In addition, tapes can be very beneficial when it comes to archiving email. While backing up is the act of saving all data files needed to keep email operational, archiving is simply saving messages with historical value. Because these files don't need to be accessed as quickly as operational files, the speed of implementation is not as big of an issue in this case. HP offers many tape solutions for a wide range of budgets. On the low end, the HP StorageWorks DAT 72 offers DDS-4 com- patibility with up to 72GB of compressed capacity starting at $849. For a more robust solution, the StorageWorks MSL5026 Tape Library offers Ultrall LVD SCSI interface and 26 cartridge slots for a native capacity of 2.86TB of backup for $5,270. Putting It All Together In the end, some of the best email backup solutions out there are going to be network storage-based. However, simpler solutions such as RAID and tape backups do have their uses if an organization is not solely dependant on them. For example, if an organization was going to back up an email server both to RAID disks and tapes, it could have proper redundancy, portability, and dependability Page 11 does this solution fit into your organiza- tion's overall backup plans? A network that suited all backup needs could be more cost effective. to do the job. But when creating hodge- podge backup systems, it is important to consider the overall TCO. In the end will it really save your business money? And how Email Backup Products There are a plethora of storage options available to improve your email backup infrastructure. When setting up your hardware, it is critical to ensure that your backup software package is compatible.

The Mazu Enforcer is a perimeter appliance that watches for network congestion that is caused by traffic-based threats, such as denial-of-service attacks. When the Mazu Enforcer detects an attack, it uses advanced heuristics to quickly identify the individual packets that are causing the problem. It can then filter out the attack traffic while minimizing the impact on legitimate traffic. The Enforcer also can dynamically adapt its filtering behavior as an attack progresses. Special Features • Regain and retain control during attacks • Maintain full availability of network resources • Customize and configure the deployment to meet the specific requirements of their environments Mazu 125 CambridgePark Drive, 4th Fl.
