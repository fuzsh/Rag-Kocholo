I study at Colegio Granadino and I am a tenth grader.I am passionate for soccer some people say that I am addicted to it, but I think that soccer is addicted to me its always asking for me every second. I also love my family, I will be a slave for them. I made this project because I want to show people what kind of music could represent some events of my life.I chose some great songs that I think that could represent me.Some experiences of my life were chosen for this work, I hope you enjoy this 3 memories with their corresponding songs. The first event I chose was when my dad was really weak and sick from a disease he had, and the song I chose for this shocking moment of my life was “Stay With Me” -Sam Smith.I chose this song because it's meaningful to me, I think this song describes exactly what I felt on those times. The second event I picked was the time the Colegio Granadinos soccer team won the Intercolegiados, and the song I chose for this is “We are the Champions” -Queen.This song was made by a band I really like, this song inspires me to play soccer and to do what I love to do. And last but not least was when I was told I was diagnosed of Osgood Schlatter Syndrome, which was a tragic moment of my life, the doctor told me I shouldn't play soccer in my life again because my knee (and also my syndrome) could get worst, but I took the risk and I played soccer, obviously with an orthopedic knee brace. The song I selected for this tragedy was “The Final Countdown” -Europe. I think this is a very popular song but I still chose it because its a song that marked me. In conclusion I am very thankful for you to reading my letter. I really hope you enjoy knowing some parts of my adventurous life, maybe the music I chose wasn't your genre but their songs I really love hearing. Thank you again for your time. S.

The text of the bill, which spans more than 1,800 pages, includes assistance to state and local governments, hazard pay for frontline health care workers, forgiveness of student debt and bolstering Medicaid and Medicare. The bill is known as the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or HEROES Act. The bill also includes provisions to assist farmers, protect renters and homeowners from evictions and foreclosures, and extend family and medical leave provisions previously approved by Congress. The legislation would also provide relief for essential workers, such as aviation, rail and Amtrak workers, as well as extend work visas for immigrants. “We are presenting a plan to do what is necessary to address the corona crisis,” Pelosi said in remarks at the Capitol announcing the legislation, explaining that the bill’s priorities were “opening our economy safely and soon, honoring our heroes, and then putting much needed money in the pockets of Americans.” In an interview with MSNBC on Monday evening, Pelosi said there is a “monumental” need for the next legislative package, with a focus on helping struggling Americans and cash-strapped states and localities. “We have a big need. It’s monumental. And therefore, it’s a great opportunity to say: let’s work together to get this done. There’s a way to open the economy based on science, testing, testing, testing and let’s get on with it. That’s what we’re here to do,” Pelosi told MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has suggested it is unnecessary to immediately begin work on a new aid package. He said during an appearance at a livestream event for the Trump campaign that he intends to “hit pause” on coronavirus relief funds. “We now have a debt the size of our economy,” he noted. “So I’ve said, and the president has said as well, that we have to take a pause here and take a look at what we’ve done.” Congress in March passed three massive legislative packages to offer coronavirus relief, including a $2 trillion package which expanded unemployment insurance and created a loan program for small businesses. In April, Congress passed an interim bill to bolster funding for the loans, known as the Paycheck Protection Program, which quickly ran out of funds. Governors and mayors across the country have called for financial assistance from the federal government. Pelosi suggested on Monday that the next legislative package include assistance for states and localities, as well as hazard pay for frontline health care workers. “To those who would suggest a pause, I’ll say the hunger doesn’t take a pause. The rent doesn’t take a pause. The hardship doesn’t take a pause,” Pelosi told Hayes on Monday. McConnell and House Republicans have previously indicated that they would want to see liability protections for businesses and health care employers in the next phase of coronavirus relief legislation.

In late 2008, a review indicated that the existing and planned facilities at ESC would not be able to meet the disposal demand after 2012. In order to meet this demand, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSARG) decided to implement a new contained aquatic disposal (CAD) ([2]) facility at the South of The Brothers (SB CMPs) which had been under consideration for a number of years. 1.1.2 The environmental acceptability of the construction and operation of the Project had been confirmed by findings of the associated Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study completed in 2005 under Agreement No. CE 12/2002(EP) ([3]). The Director of Environmental Protection (DEP) approved this EIA report under the Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance (Cap. 499) (EIAO) in September 2005 (EIA Register No.: AEIAR-089/2005). 1.1.3 In accordance with the EIA recommendation, prior to commencement of construction works for the SB CMPs, the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) undertook a detailed review and update of the EIA findings for the SB site ([4]). Findings of the EIA review undertaken in 2009/ 2010 confirmed that the construction and operation of the SB site had been predicted to be environmentally acceptable. 1.1.4 Environmental Permits (EPs) (EP-312/2008/A and EP-427/2011/A) were issued by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) to the CEDD, the Permit Holder, on 28 November 2008 for ESC CMP V and on 23 December 2011 for SB CMPs, respectively. Under the requirements of the EPs, an Environmental Monitoring and Audit (EM&A) programme as set out in the EM&A Manuals ([5]) ([6]) is required to be implemented for the CMPs. 1.1.5 The present EM&A programme under Agreement No. CE 23/2012 (EP) covers the dredging, disposal and capping operations of the SB CMPs as well as ESC CMPs. Detailed works schedule for ESC CMPs and SB CMPs is shown in Figure 1.1. In September 2016, the following works were being undertaken: · Disposal of contaminated mud at ESC CMP Vd; and · Capping operation at SB CMP 2. Figure 1.1 Works Schedule for ESC CMPs and SB CMPs 1.2 Reporting Period 1.2.1 This 49th Monthly Progress Report covers the EM&A activities for the reporting month of September 2016. 1.3 Details of Sampling and Laboratory Testing Activities 1.3.1 The following monitoring activities have been undertaken for ESC CMPs in September 2016: · Pit Specific Sediment Chemistry of ESC CMP Vd was undertaken on 1 September 2016; and · Water Column Profiling of ESC CMP Vd was undertaken on 2 September 2016. 1.3.2 No monitoring activities were scheduled to be undertaken for SB CMPs in September 2016. 1.4 Details of Outstanding Sampling and/or Analysis 1.4.1 No outstanding sampling and analysis remained for September 2016. 1.5 Brief Discussion of the Monitoring Results for ESC CMPs 1.5.1 Brief discussion of the monitoring results of the following activities for ESC CMPs is presented in this 49th Monthly Progress Report: · Water Column Profiling of ESC CMP Vd in September 2016; · Pit Specific Sediment Chemistry of ESC CMP Vd in August and September 2016; and · Cumulative Impact Sediment Chemistry of ESC CMPs in August 2016. 1.5.2 Water Column Profiling of ESC CMP Vd – September 2016 1.5.3 Water Column Profiling was undertaken at a total of two sampling stations (Upstream and Downstream stations) on 1 September 2016. The monitoring results have been assessed for compliance with the Water Quality Objectives (WQOs) set by Environmental Protection Department (EPD). This consists of a review of the EPD routine water quality monitoring data for the wet season period (April to October) of 2006 - 2015 from stations in the Northwestern Water Control Zone (WCZ), where the ESC CMPs are located ([7]). For Salinity, the averaged value obtained from the Reference stations was used for the basis as the WQO. Levels of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and Turbidity were also assessed for compliance with the Action and Limit Levels (see Table B1 of Annex B for details). In-situ Measurements 1.5.4 Analyses of results for September 2016 indicated that levels of Salinity, DO and pH complied with the WQOs at both Downstream and Upstream stations (Table B2 of Annex B). In addition, DO and Turbidity at all stations complied with the Action and Limit Levels (Table B1 of Annex B). Laboratory Measurements for Suspended Solids (SS) 1.5.5 Analyses of results for September 2016 indicated that the SS levels were higher than the WQO at both Upstream and Downstream stations. However, both Upstream and Downstream stations complied with the Action and Limit Levels (Table B1 of Annex B). 1.5.6 Overall, the monitoring results indicated that the mud disposal operation at ESC CMP Vd did not appear to cause any deterioration in water quality during this reporting period. 1.5.7 Pit Specific Sediment Chemistry of ESC CMP Vd – August and September 2016 1.5.8 Monitoring locations for Pit Specific Sediment Chemistry for ESC CMP Vd are shown in Figure 1.2. A total of six (6) monitoring stations were sampled in August and September 2016. 1.5.9 The concentrations of all inorganic contaminants were lower than the Lower Chemical Exceedance Level (LCEL) at all stations in August and September 2016 (Figures 1, 2, 5 and 6 of Annex C). 1.5.10 For organic contaminants, the concentrations of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) were similar amongst the stations in August and September 2016 (Figures 3 and 7 of Annex C). In August 2016, Tributyltin (TBT) concentrations were higher at Active Pit station ESC-NPAB and Pit Edge station ESC-NEAA whilst TBT concentrations were higher at Active Pit ESC-NPAA station in September 2016 (Figures 4 and 8 of Annex C). Low and High Molecular Weight Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Total Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), Total dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and 4,4’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) concentrations were below the limit of reporting at all stations in August and September 2016. 1.5.11 Overall, there is no evidence indicating any unacceptable environmental impacts to sediment quality as a result of the contaminated mud disposal operations at ESC CMP Vd in August and September 2016. Statistical analysis will be undertaken and presented in the quarterly report to investigate whether there are any unacceptable impacts in the area caused by the contaminated mud disposal. 1.5.12 Cumulative Impact Sediment Chemistry of ESC CMPs – August 2016 1.5.13 Monitoring locations for Cumulative Impact Sediment Chemistry for ESC CMPs are shown in Figure 1.3. A total of nine (9) monitoring stations were sampled in August 2016. 1.5.14 Analyses of results for the Cumulative Impact Sediment Chemistry Monitoring indicated that the concentrations of all inorganic contaminants were below the LCEL in August 2016 (Figures 9 and 10 of Annex C). 1.5.15 For organic contaminants, concentrations of TOC were observed to be similar among all stations (Figure 11 of Annex C). Concentrations of TBTs were recorded to be higher at Ma Wan station and Capped Pit station ESC-RCA (Figure 12 of Annex C). Total DDT, 4,4’-DDE, Total PCBs as well as Low and High Molecular Weight PAHs were recorded below the limit of reporting at all stations. 1.5.16 Overall, there is no evidence indicating any unacceptable environmental impacts to sediment quality as a result of the contaminated mud disposal operations at ESC CMP Vd in August 2016. Statistical analysis will be undertaken and presented in the quarterly report to investigate whether there are any unacceptable impacts in the area caused by the contaminated mud disposal. 1.6 Activities Scheduled for the Next Month 1.6.1 The following monitoring activities will be conducted in the next monthly period of October 2016 for ESC CMPs: · Water Column Profiling of ESC CMP Vd; · Routine Water Quality Monitoring of ESC CMP Vd; · Water Quality Monitoring During Dredging of ESC CMP Vb; and · Pit Specific Sediment Chemistry of ESC CMP Vd. 1.6.2 No monitoring activities will be scheduled in the next monthly period of October 2016 for SB CMPs. 1.6.3 The sampling schedule is presented in Annex A. 1.7 Study Programme 1.7.1 A summary of the Study programme is presented in Annex D. ([1]) According to the Management Framework of Dredged/ Excavated Sediment of ETWB TC(W) No. 34/2002, contaminated sediment in general shall mean those sediment requiring Type 2 – Confined Marine Disposal as determined according to this TC(W). ([2]) CAD options may involve use of excavated borrow pits, or may involve purpose-built excavated pits. CAD sites are those which involve filling a seabed pit with contaminated mud and capping it with uncontaminated material such that the original seabed level is restored and the contaminated material is isolated from the surrounding marine environment.7 ([3]) Detailed Site Selection Study for a Proposed Contaminated Mud Disposal Facility within the Airport East/ East of Sha Chau Area (Agreement No. CE 12/2002(EP)) ([4]) Under the CEDD study Contaminated Sediment Disposal Facility to the South of The Brothers (Agreement No. FM 2/2009) ([5]) ERM (2012) Environmental Monitoring and Audit (EM&A) Manual.

Over the past few years we have taking huge steps with that mission and we are now the world leader in sustainable guitar making. Replacing endangered timbers. Because we have always used unique timbers that are largely indigenous to Australia, the vast majority of our guitar build was always sustainable. In most cases, the only endangered wood on a Cole Clark was on the fretboard and bridge. Replacing those endangered timbers with sustainable, locally available alternatives such as Sheoak and Satin Box in 2015 allowed us to produce guitars made without any form of endangered timber for the first time. Today, 96% of our annual build contains no endangered wood, with the other 6% comprising ebony fretboards and bridges or rosewood left from prior to the CITES restrictions. See our environmental statement for more information. Urban Recovery. In 2014, we started engaging in Urban Recovery Projects. This is where trees in urban areas are dying, have come down in storms or through other natural causes or otherwise need to be removed for safety purposes. These trees usually become mulch. Instead, we liaise with local councils and arborists to have the tree delivered to our facility where we mill in house. This also means that much of the carbon that would have been lost when the tree was mulched remains in the guitar (Carbon sequestration). Around 30% of our timber comes through urban recovery. The rest comes from sustainable plantations and farms from Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland. The term ‘sustainability’ itself can be confusing and take on different meanings. Some guitar manufacturers will claim sustainable use of a timber based on the sourcing of that timber rather than it’s status as endangered. From our point of view, timbers on the IUCN Red List of threatened species are endangered and not using them at all, regardless of how it’s sourced should be the goal. It’s also essential that people know whether the timber they’re buying is truly sustainable. Woods are often grouped into larger families. Some are sustainable, others are not. ‘Mahogany’ is a great example. The term is used for a number of brown timbers. Without knowing the scientific term, it’s impossible to know whether that Mahogany is endangered, or even if it’s actually Mahogany. ‘Khaya’, commonly known as African Mahogany is in fact NOT a Mahogany. We use the scientific terms for our timbers on our timber page to help the customer make an informed choice and also to begin a wider discussion on ethical promotion of guitars.

How many concerts can you cram into just one lifetime? Let's find out together. Concert Manic! » Home Page My self-curated guitar festival with Aram Bajakian, Nels Cline, Marc Ribot and Stephen Ulrich By Sarah V. | May 31, 2015 - 2:02 pm | Concert review It’s been a very busy couple of weeks here in Concertville, having attended eleven sets of live music in the twelve days after I wrote my last blog post. (Edit: And I’ve attended four more concerts since I wrote that sentence because I haven’t found the time to finish this blog post all week!) I realized partway through that eleven-set run that I was in the middle of an inadvertent celebration of all things guitar, with several of my favorite guitarists playing multiple shows all in a row. The main event was Aram Bajakian’s residency at the Stone. I only made it to seven sets (going to the Stone is a lot harder when the MTA does late-night construction on your concert commute, grrr!) but I heard some wonderful music along the way. I have a hard time narrowing it down to favorites, since the music was so diverse that it’s hard to compare one set to the next; but I think my top three were Dálava; music inspired by “The Color of Pomegranates,” and his duo set with Alan Semerdjian. Aram did two sets of Dálava during his residency, one with a full band and one as a guitar/vocal duet. I saw the one with a full band, which was Aram Bajakian on guitar; Julia Ulehla doing vocals; Tom Swafford and Jake Shulman Ment playing violins; Frank London on trumpet; Shanir Blumenkranz on bass; and Ted Reichman on accordion. (It was funny since I’d had a fairly random interaction with someone the previous night on the subway, and said something about there not being enough good music written for accordions. And the very next night: great music with an accordion! Wish: granted.) I’d seen Dálava’s New York premiere a few months ago, and although I enjoyed that first show, I thought this set at the Stone was by far the better of the two. The attentive, appreciative audience at the Stone and the intimate space makes everything better, and I think the band was just feeling it more this time. The music is an unusual blend of old Eastern European folk music and modern downtown New York sensibility. Very interesting stuff. (Check it out here.) The duo set with Alan Semerdjian was really very special; Alan would recite poems (written by him as well as some poems by Armenian writers, translated into English, in tribute to the 100th anniversary of the 1915 Armenian genocide) while Aram played music to underscore and illustrate the texts. The poetry was excellent and thought-provoking, and the solo guitar accompaniment was beautiful. I would love to hear more of this collaboration, it really worked well and was an emotionally powerful experience.

Hopefully now that summer has arrived a couple of months early, the cold and flu season is over. I did manage to push through and get to a handful of shows, though I didn’t feel well enough to write about them until this week. Erik Friedlander‘s solo set at Dixon Place, premiering his new album “Illuminations,” was a real treat. The new album is a must-hear – I’ve really been enjoying it (you can listen and buy it by clicking here). It reminds me a little of “Volac,” the album he did for John Zorn’s Book of Angels series, but with a bit more of a classical sound. I hadn’t been to Dixon Place before and it was an excellent place to see a very focused and intense solo set, with no distracting noise from the street or a bar. It was a beautiful concert, and I was happy to bring home the new CD afterwards for some extended listening sessions. Here’s a piece from “Illuminations” that he performed in Krakow: The same night, and with a slightly overlapping set time, was Trevor Dunn’s band PROOFReaders, with Dunn on upright bass, Darius Jones on saxophone, Nate Wooley on trumpet and Ryan Sawyer on drums. Luckily this show was just a few blocks from Dixon Place at the Skinny, so we were able to scoot over there and only miss a little bit of the beginning of the show. They played a double set of Ornette Coleman tunes, so we definitely got our money’s worth even though we were late (not always a sure thing these days with lots of sub-60-minute sets happening in avant-garde/jazz venues). It was a great opportunity to relax on some comfy couches and take in some high-quality acoustic jazz performed by very talented musicians. What more can a jazz fan ask for? I don’t think the PROOFReaders have any recordings or videos available to share, but I will definitely go see them again if I get the chance.

Case in point: I’d had my concert calendar laid out for April since the first week of the month, but this week I ended up ditching my plans a couple of times for last-minute surprise concerts. One was announced just hours before the show, one was announced a few days in advance. Luckily, since I am a person who is relatively unattached to other people’s schedules, I was able to drop my plans and make it to both events. There was some kind of synchronicity at work, with two of my favorite female vocalists/songwriters announcing last-minute shows in Brooklyn two days apart; but the shows were pretty drastically different. The first one was a Record Store Day concert kicking off the Dresden Dolls‘ release of the Virginia Monologues, a vinyl collection of their two albums Yes, Virginia and No, Virginia. They did a free concert at the Rough Trade record store in Williamsburg, which I think has a capacity around 250 in the venue attached to the store. It was the first time I’d been there when the balcony was open, so I took the opportunity to nab a spot up there – it was an unusually hot day and the GA floor area was unpleasant, temperature-wise, so I was hoping the balcony would have a bit more airflow (it didn’t, but I had a nice view, so that was OK). The Dresden Dolls have been on hiatus for a while – I actually happened to catch their last performance, which was just a couple of songs at a benefit show in the Boston metro area in 2013. I’d enjoyed those two songs a lot so I figured it would be worth trekking out to Brooklyn early to check out a full set from them. Unfortunately the L train wasn’t running between Manhattan and Williamsburg on Record Store Day because the MTA hates us, so it took me close to two torturous hours to get there, including multiple trains, walking, and an illegal Uber street pick-up when I got desperate. I narrowly avoided taking the G train for the first time ever. But I got there, and I got in, and the awesome bartender gave me a free ice-cold non-alcoholic beverage, so it was all good. They came out pretty darn close to on-time (which was impressive and greatly appreciated as I was dripping sweat before the show even started – damn, Rough Trade, do you not have air conditioning??) and as expected, the show was intense. I have a bit of a weakness for melodramatic/cabaret type rock music, and the Dresden Dolls are pretty much the epitome of that. The whole set was good, but most of my favorites were towards the end – “Half Jack,” a cover of “War Pigs,” “Sing” and the explosive encore, “Girl Anachronism.” When I wasn’t watching the stage, I was enjoying watching the crowd up front – I don’t know if I’ve ever seen an audience enjoying themselves that much at a show! Dancing, singing, smiling. The joy on their faces was visible all the way up in the balcony.

The first really great set I saw in April was Doug Wieselman‘s solo performance at a house concert. I think he performed music exclusively from his recent album, From Water, which features pieces he wrote after being inspired by specific bodies of water. Some have obvious inspirations like “Pacific 1″ and “Pacific 2,” and some had more involved explanations – like “Train” which was inspired by the train that goes along the Hudson River (which is the one I take to my parents’ house, so I know it well – it’s beautiful) and even as far afield as “Kepler-22b,” which is an exoplanet that astronomers believe has a lot of water on it. Mr. Wieselman performed on solo clarinet and some electronics/pedals. I found this music to be particularly enjoyable in such an intimate and friendly setting. It was so easy to fully focus on and lose yourself in the sound. I’ve seen him play a few times before, but this set felt really special. Later that week I went with a friend to see Jolie Holland. Kind of a nice musical segue, because although these two concerts could hardly be more different, Doug Wieselman played a lot on her most recent album, Wine Dark Sea. And the lion’s share of her setlist was from that album, including one of my favorites, “Saint Dymphna.” For this particular live set, she had an unusual lineup featuring three electric guitars and no other instruments (although one guitarist swapped out his guitar for a harmonium on a couple of songs). Electric guitars are one of my favorite instruments, so I thought it made for a pretty fun band. It was a short-ish set, but the setlist was very well-chosen and included a new song that I really liked. After hearing it, I’m already looking forward to the next album! (She tends to go a few years between albums, but hopefully I don’t have to wait TOO long for it.) Edit for a late addition: My friend Mike W. sent me this great pic he took at the Jolie Holland concert from our vantagepoint at the corner of the stage: Tagged cyro baptista, doug wieselman, jeff parker, jolie holland, nels cline, nels cline singers, scott amendola, trevor dunn Last week’s concerts: Mat Maneri, Lucien Ban, Rudresh Mahanthappa, Banquet of the Spirits, Marc Ribot, Emeline Michel, and last but not least, Sex Mob By Sarah V. | March 31, 2015 - 1:56 am | Concert review …in that order! I had a pretty busy week, including checking out four new-to-me music venues in four days. It’s amazing how many different venues there are in New York – I’ve gone to 200+ concerts in this town and there’s still so many places I haven’t been. (I just checked my list, I’ve been to 18 different venues since January 1st this year.) The first concert of the week was a last-minute decision after being sick in bed for a couple of days. I made a swift recovery on the last day and decided I was OK to go downtown to the Cornelia Street Cafe to see Mat Maneri and Lucien Ban‘s new quintet. Unfortunately, since it was last minute, the early set was already sold out… but I decided to hang out and see if I could get in on the waitlist. Concert karma won out and I ended up being the last audience member allowed in, and yet somehow got a second row table. Score! I stayed for both sets and really enjoyed it. It’s a somewhat unusual mix of instruments – Lucien Ban on piano, Randy Peterson on drums, Tony Malaby on saxophone, Bob Stewart on tuba, and Mat Maneri on viola – but it worked really well. It’s hard to even pick favorites among the band – they were all so good. This video is a duet and not the same quintet we saw live, but perhaps it will give you an idea of the sort of music that Mr. Ban and Mr. Maneri come up with together: (OK, that sounds so nice that I just opened a tab in my browser and bought the album from Amazon MP3 so I can listen to it while I’m writing the rest of this article. I love the 21st century sometimes!) The second concert of the week was Tuesday evening at the Jazz Standard: Rudresh Mahanthappa‘s quintet playing “Bird Calls”. Believe it or not, this was my first visit to the Jazz Standard! I liked it a lot more than I thought I would – in my imagination, every jazz venue with table seating is overcrowded and annoying, and every jazz venue that serves food is terrible and overpriced. Happily, this venue turned out to be an exception to the rule, and we had a really nice time. I look forward to seeing more shows there. Venue aside, the concert itself was also very enjoyable – we’d seen (and liked) this band at Winter Jazzfest, but in this more relaxed and intimate venue, with better sound quality, it felt like a whole different ball game. As you may guess from the title, “Bird Calls” is heavily influenced and inspired by the music of Charlie Parker. (If you want to read about the album in-depth, check out this great article from All About Jazz.) Mr. Mahanthappa’s saxophone was clearly the star of the show, although he was supported by an excellent band. He made the intricate melodies and ideas seem effortless, and as the show went on, it just got better and better. Check out one of the tracks from “Bird Calls” here: The next night was a show I’d been particularly looking forward to: Cyro Baptista’s Banquet of the Spirits at the Harlem Stage Gatehouse. Another new-to-me venue, it is a pretty nice place to see a show and gets a lot of bonus points for being walkable from my apartment. Double bonus points: it was a free concert. (NB: you need to RSVP in advance for their free shows, so make sure you reserve a spot early.)

Nitibha, who has stepped in the web world with the series called “Nitibha Knows” on The Comic Wallah, a channel by Fabform, a digital venture by Vishal Mull, added that the scrutiny has brought a sense of responsibility about how she handles her life. “Life did change (after ‘Bigg Boss’) because all of a sudden I was someone who people recognised at the airport, on the streets while walking anywhere, so it is the recognition that comes with it, of course, brings in a lot of responsibility,” Nitibha told IANS. She added: “I cannot be reckless about the things that I’m doing, the actions I’m making. I am in the public eye, I am a known figure… if I upload picture in a swimming costume in a hotel when I’m staying there, it is also, you know it is picked up by the media.” “So, that is the kind of scrutiny that you’re put through but that also makes you feel very grateful about it because very few people can actually be known, so it is definitely great and I’m handling it well. I do feel restricted sometimes but I think that’s a part and parcel of the industry.” She left her job at Google to be part of “Bigg Boss” Season 10 as a commoner. Some people don’t like the constant scrutiny that comes with fame, and Nitibha says she is one of them. “I don’t want anything and everything I do to be scrutinised, monitored, commented on or judged. That is something nobody likes but it also, sort of, comes in with the fact that if you are being given the privilege of being a celebrity, of being a known figure or a personality in this country, then you have to also be responsible towards your actions because it can influence other people,” she added.

Among the studies listed below is one by Chikramane et al., who discovered nanoparticles of the original substances in homeopathic medicines at potencies as high as 200C in the year 2010. When long-time American homeopathy researcher Iris Bell, M.D. Ph.D. read this study, she had an idea: why not look at the science coming out about nanoparticles and physiology, a hot topic in medical research right now as it holds the promise of better drug absorption? She did that for two years and was struck by the similarities between what this nanomedicine science was discovering and what is known in homeopathy. This prompted Dr. Bell to formulate a theory as to how homeopathy works, which she published a paper about in October of 2012. See it here. What should happen next is testing of the theory as she suggests, and independent replications of the Chikramane experiment. If these things both turn up positive, we'll be able to say that we know broadly at least that we know how homeopathy works. Keep checking back here. What is in that water? No one has figured out, exactly, but they're working on it. It's becoming clearer and clearer that there is something in ultra-high dilutions, prepared the way homeopaths prepare them. Enough scientists are working on it that they have their own academic journal, the International Journal of High Dilution Research. They affect living things: E. Davenas, F. Beauvais, J. Amara, M. Oberbaum, B. Robinzon, A. Miadonnai, A. Tedeschi, B. Pomeranz, P. Fortner, P. Belon, J. Sainte-Laudy, B. Poitevin & J. Benveniste, Human basophil degranulation triggered by very dilute antiserum against IgE Nature 333, 816-818 (30 June 1988) [Warning: entire study including abstract behind paywall.] This is Jacques Benveniste’s famous “memory of water” study which led to the destruction of his sterling reputation by those who simply refused to believe his results. We list all the authors, instead of just “et al” as usual, to make the point that three other labs had to replicate the results before the paper was published—an unprecedented requirement. It has been replicated again since, however, as per this meta-analysis: Witt CM, et al, The in vitro evidence for an effect of high homeopathic potencies–a systematic review of the literature Compl Therap Med (2007) 15, 128-138) “From 75 publications, 67 experiments (1/3 of them replications) were evaluated. Nearly 3/4 of them found a high potency effect, and 2/3 of those 18 that scored 6 points or more and controlled contamination. Nearly 3/4 of all replications were positive. Design and experimental models of the reviewed experiments were inhomogenous, most were performed on basophiles.” (Same thing Benveniste was studying.) What frustrates the scientists is that this isn’t 100% reproducible. They are working on figuring out why. They shine the same way the original material does: Rey, L. Thermoluminescence of ultra-high dilutions of lithium chloride and sodium chloride Physica A 323 (2003) 67 – 74 “During that phase, their thermoluminescence has been studied and it was found that, despite their dilution beyond the Avogadro number, the emitted light was specific of the original salts dissolved initially.” They emit electromagnetic waves: Montagnier L. et al, Electromagnetic Signals are Produced by Aqueous Nanostructures Derived from Bacterial DNA SequencesInterdiscip Sci Comput Life Sci (2009) 1:81-90) Conclusion: solutions of bacteria and virus DNA, when so highly-diluted that nothing of the original substance remained, were still able to emit low frequency radio waves. The radio waves affected water molecules, and the water molecules remembered and emitted radio waves. Oh, and in case you think Luc Montagnier is some junk scientist, he’s the one who discovered the HIV virus, winning a Nobel Prize for doing so. Due to lack of funding for homeopathy-related research in Europe, he’s recently moved to China to continue studying this phenomenon. They can be told apart if you have the right equipment: Rao, ML. et al, The defining role of structure (including epitaxy) in the plausibility of homeopathy Homeopathy, Volume 96, Issue 3, July 2007, pp. 175-182. “Preliminary data obtained using Raman and Ultra-Violet–Visible (UV–VIS) spectroscopy illustrate the ability to distinguish two different homeopathic medicines (Nux vomica and Natrum muriaticum) from one another and to differentiate, within a given medicine, the 6c, 12c, and 30c potencies.” Same authors continue this line of investigation: Rao, ML et al: Characterization of the structure of ultra dilute sols with remarkable biological properties Materials Letters, Volume 62, Issues 10-11, April 15, 2008, pp. 1487-1490. “This opens up a whole new field of endeavor for inorganic materials scientists interested in biological effects.” They’re just… different. V. Elia and M. Niccoli, New Physico-Chemical Properties of Extremely-Diluted Aqueous Solutions, Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry, Vol. 75 (2004) 815–836. “The procedure of dilutions and succussions, even if there are no con vincing theoretical explanations yet, is capable of modifying in a permanent way the physico-chemical features of water.” And maybe they actually do have bits of the original material in them after all. Chikramane, PS et al, Extreme homeopathic dilutions retain starting materials: A nanoparticulate perspective Homeopathy 2010 Oct;99(4):231-42. “Using market samples of metal-derived medicines from reputable manufacturers, we have demonstrated for the first time by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), electron diffraction and chemical analysis by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES), the presence of physical entities in these extreme dilutions, in the form of nanoparticles of the starting metals and their aggregates.” What that last study points out… well, look at how recently it was published. Scientific research on high dilutions is ongoing. It’s a story that is still developing. Bonus: Here is a site with everything you could imaginably want to know about water, by a scientist who is arguably the world’s leading authority on it. From the “Memory of Water” page, a quote–note the certainty with which he says it– “Water does store and transmit information, concerning solutes, by means of its hydrogen-bonded network.” Another quote: “‘Maybe I should have thrown the data away’ -Jacques Benveniste, 1935-2004. But being a scientist and believing in his data he could not.” And here is a film on the properties of water. Fascinating stuff. © Hearthstone Independent\n\ncc/2021-04/en_middle_0083.json.gz/line57\n\n__label__cc\n\n0.747616\n\n0.252384\n\nProduction Co: Handmade Films Director: Jonathan Lyon Producer: Michael White Writer: Jonathan Lyon Cast: Eric Idle, Robbie Coltrane A bit of a one-trick pony but very funny thanks to the British comic sensibility, the charisma and chemistry between stars Coltrane and Idle and a healthy sense of the ribald and absurd.

He was a classic DJ with a hokey name but kept asking for me to be a DJ. Honestly, I am not one of those turntable scratching guys and repeatedly told him no. I said unless I can voice my opinion and mirror the kings like Howard Stern and Opie and Anthony what’s the point. Well, needless to say he said yes do it. One thing led to another and boom I was on their network. But life is short lived and I was quickly let go after, believe it or not, the network got scared that a sponsor would pull itself. I thought that since I was on the Internet and FCC shouldn’t be worried, but it’s the people that become scary. See I figured going to terrestrial radio is fine but I don’t want to be stuck working for a station that is worried the FCC is going to shut them down if I said the word Poop. Bullshit on that, and again boom the Phrase “Real People, Real Conversations, Real Life.” But who will listen, again as luck will have it Rick White from www.ktradio.org started talking to me and liked what he heard. So the merger between “Radio without Rules” and my sorry ass began. Quickly Moose, D.B. and Sober came in line and the show is cooking along and Ed Money’s Late Night began to take shape.

In an interview with Xinhua, Chui explained the reason why Macao should devise its first ever long-term plan, and how it will benefit the Macao people. Macao unveils the final version of its first five-year plan on Thursday, after almost one year of preparation. The plan sets out comprehensive development targets for the SAR, focusing on citizen's livelihood and Macao's diversified economy. \"The top-down design plan made with higher standards and vision is necessary for Macao's future development. The plan is not made in haste, the SAR needs it, the people want it,\" he said. The chief executive recalled that it has been 16 years since Macao has implemented the principle of \"one country, two systems,\" \"Macao people governing Macao,\" and high degree of autonomy. Macao people understand that Chinese mainland is the strong support for the SAR's economy development and improvement of people's life. Regional cooperation is a robust boost for Macao to diversify its economy. Macao has to follow the development plan of the whole country to promote its sustainable development. \"The experience that the government has learned shows that annual administrative policy and sub-plans are important, but short-term plans would not help us handle the changing situation, nor promote the SAR's public governance, long-term stability and prosperity,\" Chui said. The plan said Macao targets a \"world leisure and tour center\" as its future position, which has been recognized by China's 12th and 13th five-year plans, as well as by the Macao people. The plan highlights seven major targets, including maintaining stable economic growth, improving the structure of industries, improving its role as an international tourist city, raising the life quality of the residents and the quality of education, protecting environment, and strengthening the efficiency of the government and deepening the building of the legal system. Chui said the plan borrowed the concept of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development in China's five-year plan. Macao's version has covered the cooperation with the 13th five-year plan, Belt and Road Initiative, commercial cooperation platform between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, and regional cooperation. The SAR government had held over 40 public meetings to collect civil opinions and suggestions from more than 100 social groups. Over 4,000 letters had been sent to the government to deliver about 10,000 detailed opinions for the plan. \"The drafting process has three parts: preparatory research, public opinion collection, and plan publishing. I feel that our people recognize this plan, and are very active and reasonable in participating in the drafting process,\" Chui said. The plan focuses on citizen livelihood and sets out goals covering land use, traffic, medical service, education and job creation. It also prioritizes infrastructure projects for the next five years, such as construction of a light railway network, a fourth bridge between Macao and Taipa, expanding a waste incinerator, and building an electronic surveillance system. Macao started drafting this plan in October 2015, when a special committee was appointed to research and make a top-down design plan for Macao to become a world leisure and tour center in the mid 2030s. \"Everything's hard in the beginning. Macao didn't have long-term plan and the experience of making such plan before,\" the chief executive said. \"We need patience and strong will to start it. The SAR government took the responsibility and carry it out with wide view and scientific method.\" In order to make a good plan, Chui came to China's National Development and Reform Commission, and Tsinghua University's Center for China Studies several times for advice. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, and Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao SAR also offered help to the SAR government. \"During the drafting process, I deeply felt the support from the motherland to Macao,\" Chui said. He said this plan both considers the short-term, mid- and long-term interests, and reflects the will of people. Drafting such a plan is one important step to make the SAR governance more systematic, democratic and precise. The SAR government and people will joint their effort to raise Macao's competitiveness, and share the fruitful result. From this point of view, he added, drafting this plan is a breakthrough in the SAR government's efforts to implement \"one country, two systems\" principle.

With gov’t and corporate privacy issues, the players to be affected are more known and manageable, and impinging on their freedom to collect on us — or report what they find — feel like “regular” regulation. But what happens when the information being gathered about us is thanks to someone wearing a headset and simply streaming anything interesting that he or she sees, helpfully auto-tagged with our identities? Some bars and restaurants may try to ban Google Glass on the way in, but lessons from anything ranging from mobile phones to hats tell us who’s going to win that war in the longer term. Especially once the distribution of streaming devices has evened out, so it’s not just the occasional freak behaving anti-socially, but all of us doing so, we’ll need to look for other solutions if we don’t want to be stuck simply having to reconcile ourselves to no private moments in public. One place to mine is the realm of digital rights management. DRM has not worked out so well for copyrighted material in the public mainstream, like movies and music. But what if the kind of tagging by which stuff can ask — if not require — “don’t copy me” could be deployed for privacy purposes, more in the spirit of Creative Commons than the ill-fated Macrovision VHS copy protection scheme. How to do this? A start would be to allow people to set their expectations for a given environment, and to be able to broadcast them (without having to share their names, of course). If enough people in, say, a classroom, agree that the meeting is off the record, then recording devices will be alerted accordingly. They’ll still function, but they’ll show a message that the environment is expected to be off the record — and perhaps they’ll have a glowing LED or some other gentle indicator to tell others in the room that someone has chosen to record despite the norm. Perhaps, too, those recorded will be able to have some form of pseudonymous contact information embedded in the recording — so that if it should become public, they can choose to show that they were indeed the ones recorded (again without necessarily having to reveal identity) and then ask — not demand — some privilege in contextualizing or commenting upon the recording. Many of us might appreciate an opportunity to know about others’ preferences and expectations in a quiet, low-impact way, and then to respect them — or if not, to realize that that choice entails overriding the preferences of others. The function of the technology is not to impede certain uses by fiat — the way the old DRM did — but rather to allow people to see that other people are implicated by what they do, permitting the moral dimension of our enthusiastic use of technology to become more apparent. Update: PlaceAvoider appears to seek to implement some of this functionality. Yorick Wilks says: January 27th, 2014 at 8:51 pm (#) Im no lawyer (!) but isnt much of this covered by existing federal and state law (in the US at least) on video and sound recording of people with/without their consent. Or rather how do web/digital issues change the questions, if they do, from what applied to simpler technology? As i understand it, federal law says its legal to film people without their permission and to record any conversation to which one is a party, without the consent of others involved (one-party consent etc etc). Is the main issue the information gathering or the subsequent use/dissemination/ownership of it? The reference to DRM suggests the latter, but the classroom/preferences/groups environment suggests (to me) the former? Nice idea anyway! State law does indeed vary — and enforcement can be tricky. Public places are generally open to such recording, at least so long as it isn’t secret. I suppose wearing Glass or its counterparts might be seen as putting people on notice. But over the long term, this’ll be mediated by norms rather than law … Trevor Hughes says: January 28th, 2014 at 1:19 am (#) Hi JZ, Great post. And I agree about the complexity of peer to peer privacy. I attended an event in Brussels last week where the organizers included a package of photo privacy indicators in the conference bag. The four buttons were meant to be attached to your name badge, and each button represented a different status for the wearer with regards to the taking and posting of photos (take/share freely, ask my permission, blur, or don’t take at all). Seems like an analog version of the ideas you are describing. Erhardt Graeff says: Hey JZ, Where and how do you think this would intersect with recommendations around opt-in versus opt-out that we see between EU/OECD/FTC Fair Information Practices guidelines? Obviously, as stated above, there are different privacy expectations in public places. But as the internet continues to cease looking like an internet with computer endpoints and everything is considered information, are we forced to consider these as public places or is there another way we will need to characterize them that falls under FIPs-like jurisdiction? Erhardt I never quite understood opt-in vs. opt-out as a key issue for traditional privacy; when starting a new relationship between company and individual, it’s possible to prompt for certain expectations without assuming a default one way or the other. I guess for the p2p privacy issues we’re talking about here, the idea would be that the owner of a physical space, or alternately a certain majority or supermajority of its occupants, could set a default — which would determine whether, for that space, being “off the record” is the default or something which someone must explicitly seek.

Significant headway was made in commissioning the initial manufacturing system for MosaiQ™ consumables, while also advancing final development of the MosaiQ™ instrument, and we look forward to beginning field trials later in the calendar year,\" said Paul Cowan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Quotient. \"We are also excited by the positive results of our initial efforts to expand the use of MosaiQ™ to include molecular disease screening, which is expected to increase the addressable global market for MosaiQ™ within transfusion diagnostics to over $3.4 billion. At the same time, we continue to believe significant opportunities remain to expand the MosaiQTM platform into the broader field of routine medical diagnostic testing.\" MosaiQ™ Development Program Update MosaiQ™, Quotient's next-generation automation platform for blood grouping and disease screening, is at an advanced stage of development and commercial scale up. Current development efforts are focused on final assay optimization for the blood grouping and serological disease screening applications; further assay development and expansion of the test menu for NAT; commissioning the initial manufacturing system for MosaiQ™ consumables; and completing development of the MosaiQ™ instrument. Quotient intends to simultaneously launch its MosaiQ™ blood grouping consumable into the donor and patient testing markets with our commercial partner Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. Once licensed for sale, MosaiQ™ will be the first fully-automated solution for blood grouping, providing for the comprehensive characterization of donor and patient blood. Turnaround times using MosaiQ™ will be significantly quicker than existing methods. Quotient also intends to initially launch MosaiQ™ into the donor testing market with a partial serological disease screening consumable comprising assays for the detection of Cytomegalovirus (\"CMV\") and Syphilis. Following this initial launch, Quotient plans to launch a second disease screening consumable incorporating all mandated serological disease screening assays, including CMV; Syphilis; Hepatitis B (\"HBV\"), comprising Hepatitis B Surface Antigen and Hepatitis B Core Antibody; Hepatitis C (\"HCV\"); human immunodeficiency virus (\"HIV\"), comprising HIV Type 1 and HIV Type 2; Human T-Lymphotropic Antibodies (\"HTLV\"); and Chagas disease. In the fourth quarter of calendar 2015, Quotient completed an initial feasibility study demonstrating the ability to detect nucleic acid using the MosaiQ™ methodology. In the study, Quotient and its external development partner successfully detected DNA sequences of the conserved region of the human immunodeficiency virus (\"HIV\"). MosaiQ™ represents a truly novel testing platform for transfusion diagnostics, with a proven capability to detect antibodies, antigens and nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). Through MosaiQ™, Quotient aims to deliver substantial value to donor testing laboratories worldwide with a unified instrument platform to be utilized for blood grouping and both serological and molecular disease screening of donated red blood cells and plasma. During the fourth quarter of calendar 2015, Quotient continued the transfer of individual blood grouping assays to production, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of calendar 2016. The final probe set for the blood grouping panel has now been defined. Quotient has also completed a series of internal validation studies on individual assays being developed to detect CMV, Syphilis, HBV Surface Antigen and HIV Type 1 and Type 2. The results of all of these validation studies exceeded the Company's internal performance targets for this stage of the development process. In addition, Quotient commenced development of the remaining assays intended to be included on the second serological disease screening consumable to detect HBV, HCV, HTLV and Chagas disease and expects to report preliminary sensitivity and specificity data in the first quarter of calendar 2016. Based on results achieved to date, Quotient expects to transfer to production assays for the detection of CMV and Syphilis in the first quarter of calendar 2016 and the remaining serological disease screening assays in the second half of calendar 2016. Having established the feasibility of MosaiQ™ to detect nucleic acid, Quotient will now move forward with the next phase of development for NAT on the MosaiQ™ platform, involving further assay development and expansion of the test menu to include the HBV, HCV and West Nile viruses. Quotient expects to complete this next pha"
