B. Ramifications of Peak Oil are Too Shocking to Deal With The ramifications of Peak Oil are so serious that it is hard for anybody, including journalists and politicians, to accept it as reality. C. Why Bother? People will Just Kill the Messenger The average American may not be emotionally prepared to deal with Peak Oil. Peak Oil is a literal death sentence to much of our population as well as a figurative death sentence to the energy-intensive American way of life.\n\n…\n\nBush's Energy Advisor, Matthew Simmons, addressed this issue at the Paris Peak Oil Conference, stating: I think it is human nature, basically, to say that we really like to have pleasant thoughts. The one crying wolf is abandoned unless the wolf turns out to be already at the front door, and by then, the cry is generally too late. And crises are basically problems, by definition, that have gone ignored. And all great crises were ignored until it became too late to do anything about it.70 Peak Oil isn't \"Y2K Reloaded.\" Peak Oil differs from previous “end of the world” scenarios such as Y2K in the following ways: 1. Peak Oil is not an “if” but a “when.”\n\n…\n\nThese are just some simple steps you can begin taking immediately. 1. Educate yourself about Peak Oil and its ramifications. 2. Educate others. If you're not sure how to go about doing so, consider lending them this book or emailing them a link to lifeaftertheoilcrash. 3. Seek out like-minded folks. There are Peak Oil groups forming all over the country. I have a list of these groups available on my site, http://www.lifeaftertheoilcrash.net/groups 4. Perform Google searches for Peak Oil whenever you get the chance. As more people search for \"Peak Oil,\" the folks at Google will take notice. This may result in increased mainstream media coverage. 5.\n\nPeak Everything: Waking Up to the Century of Declines by Richard Heinberg, James Howard (frw) Kunstler\n\nAdam Curtis, addicted to oil, An Inconvenient Truth, anti-communist, Asilomar, back-to-the-land, carbon tax, classic study, clean water, Community Supported Agriculture, deindustrialization, delayed gratification, demographic transition, ending welfare as we know it, energy transition, Fractional reserve banking, greed is good, Haber-Bosch Process, happiness index / gross national happiness, income inequality, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), It's morning again in America, land reform, Lewis Mumford, means of production, oil shale / tar sands, peak oil, planned obsolescence, plutocrats, reserve currency, ride hailing / ride sharing, Ronald Reagan, the built environment, the scientific method, Thomas Malthus, too big to fail, urban planning\n\nHer workshops are designed to help participants process more thoroughly, quickly, and effectively the grief they feel over the destruction of people and planet, and to overcome the psychology of denial and helplessness that keeps them mired in the status quo. Workshop tools include ritualistic exercises and guided creative processes. In the past few years Joanna has been supportive of Peak Oil education and I’ve been delighted to offer public presentations with her on a couple of occasions. Some Peak Oil groups in North America and Australia have offered workshops based on her work, including one called “The Heart of Peak Oil” held in Melbourne in 2006. More than once I’ve heard the comment that at least some Peak Oil and Climate Change activists seem strangely happy despite the dire nature of their message. Perhaps the Kübler-Ross formula, though useful, is insufficient for the purpose of describing the full cycle of psychological reactions among environmental activists.\n\n…\n\nIf We Do This Well Chapter 3 - (post-) Hydrocarbon Aesthetics Designing for the Tragic Interlude of Cheap Abundance Hydrocarbon Style: Big, Fast, and Ugly Oh, To Be Hip Again Manifesto for a Post-Carbon Aesthetic ON NATURE’S LIMITS AND THE HUMAN CONDITION Chapter 4 - Five Axioms of Sustainability History and Background Five Axioms Evaluation Chapter 5 - Parrots and Peoples Chapter 6 - Population, Resources, and Human Idealism THE END OF ONE ERA, THE BEGINNING OF ANOTHER Chapter 7 - The Psychology of Peak Oil and Climate Change Explaining Our Incomprehension Acceptance and Beyond: Peak Oil Grief Collective PTSD A Model for Explanation and Treatment: Addiction and Dependency Proactive Application: Social Marketing Chapter 8 - Bridging Peak Oil and Climate Change Activism Differing Perspectives Differing Recommendations Supply Side, Demand Side Common Ground Chapter 9 - Boomers’ Last Chance?

Our socio-historical context takes some time and perspective to appreciate. Upon first encountering Peak Oil, most people tend to assume it is merely a single isolated problem to which there is a simple solution — whether of an eco-friendly nature (more renewable energy) or otherwise (more coal).\n\nOil Panic and the Global Crisis: Predictions and Myths by Steven M. Gorelick\n\nCalifornia gold rush, carbon footprint, energy security, energy transition, flex fuel, Ford Model T, income per capita, invention of the telephone, Jevons paradox, meta-analysis, North Sea oil, nowcasting, oil shale / tar sands, oil shock, peak oil, price elasticity of demand, price stability, profit motive, purchasing power parity, RAND corporation, statistical model, stock buybacks, Thomas Malthus\n\nThe oil analysts focus not on when the last drop of oil will be pumped from the ground but rather the time when oil production will reach its peak (“peak oil”). It is their belief that the occurrence of peak oil production marks the beginning of the end, that is, the point when production can no longer keep up with demand. The argument goes that at the peak of oil production, the 4 End of the Oil Era end is in sight, and it is urgent that a fundamental restructuring of our oilbased society begin. So, when do analysts say that “peak oil” will occur? Surprisingly, the projections do not differ by much. The average collective estimate is that global peak oil production will occur before 2025, with the more pessimistic analysts suggesting that the peak has already occurred and we just do not know it, and the optimists pushing the date out to almost 2050.\n\n…\n\nThe date corresponding to this peak (actually occurring in 1970) is the time of maximum oil production, or “peak oil” production. Beyond peak oil, supplies presumably become depleted more rapidly than production from new discoveries can be brought on line. The curve after the peak falls back toward a level of nominal production. Eventually, the resource is exhausted when cumulative production nears the value of the oil endowment. One might wonder how robust the curve-fitting procedure might be. That is, perhaps it is possible to fit the historical data with a variety of curves, each showing a different time to peak oil. It turns out that, even though the shapes of various curves that fit these data might be a bit different, the time of peak oil estimated using the approach does not vary by much.\n\n…\n\nAlso shown is a fit to production data using Hubbert’s approach but assuming an oil endowment value of 3 trillion barrels. The time of peak oil does not change substantially under these scenarios. (Data: EIA and Hubbert (1969)23) Many analysts have followed in Hubbert’s footsteps and made predictions of their own. There are various studies of the timing of peak oil production that show how different assumed oil endowment values and other factors, such as the growth of demand, affect the timing of global oil depletion. A 2004 study of global oil depletion in the journal Energy by Hallock and others looked at peak oil timing under a range of assumptions of oil endowment and future demand.\n\nPower Hungry: The Myths of \"Green\" Energy and the Real Fuels of the Future by Robert Bryce\n\nAbraham Maslow, addicted to oil, An Inconvenient Truth, Apollo 11, Bernie Madoff, carbon credits, carbon footprint, carbon tax, Cesare Marchetti: Marchetti’s constant, clean tech, collateralized debt obligation, corporate raider, correlation does not imply causation, Credit Default Swap, credit default swaps / collateralized debt obligations, decarbonisation, Deng Xiaoping, disinformation, electricity market, en.wikipedia.org, energy security, energy transition, flex fuel, Ford Model T, Glass-Steagall Act, greed is good, Hernando de Soto, hydraulic fracturing, hydrogen economy, Indoor air pollution, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Isaac Newton, James Watt: steam engine, Jevons paradox, Menlo Park, Michael Shellenberger, new economy, offshore financial centre, oil shale / tar sands, oil shock, peak oil, Ponzi scheme, purchasing power parity, RAND corporation, Ronald Reagan, Silicon Valley, smart grid, Stewart Brand, Ted Nordhaus, Thomas L Friedman, uranium enrichment, Whole Earth Catalog, WikiLeaks\n\n(The Megatrends Favoring Natural Gas and Nuclear) IN AUGUST 2009, Fatih Birol, the chief economist for the International Energy Agency, did something that has become almost commonplace: He predicted a date for peak oil. In an interview with the British newspaper, the Independent, Birol said that his agency now believes “peak oil will come perhaps by 2020.”1 Birol is one of dozens of prognosticators who have offered an opinion on the question of peak oil—the moment when the world reaches the limit of its ability to produce ever-increasing amounts of petroleum. Is Birol right? Maybe. We won’t know for certain until about 2020 whether his prediction was right or wrong. The importance of Birol’s prediction is not that he picked a date for peak oil; rather, it’s that he and so many other leading energy analysts are forecasting a peak.\n\n…\n\nFor comparison, the reserves-to-production ratio for natural gas is 60.4, meaning that at current extraction rates—and assuming no more gas is discovered—the world has more than 60 years of proved natural gas reserves left in the ground.55 And those numbers will undoubtedly grow in the years ahead as more gas resources get moved into the reserves category. The megatrend of increasing natural gas consumption and natural gas availability could scarcely be occurring at a better time. Over the past few years, worries about peak oil, and another possible peak—peak coal—have emerged as serious concerns. And that leads us to our next megatrend. Peak oil is one of the most emotional and hotly debated issues in the energy business. There is widespread disagreement about when the world will hit peak production. For instance, former Princeton University geology professor Kenneth Deffeyes claims the peak was hit on Thanksgiving Day, 2005.56 Veteran Houston-based energy analyst Henry Groppe says it occurred in 2006, and that the increases in production since then are due to production of natural gas liquids, not of crude.57 Houston stock analyst Marshall Adkins, of the brokerage firm Raymond James, contends the peak was hit in 2008.58 Other energy watchers claim that the global economic downturn has delayed any discussion about peak oil for the time being, perhaps until 2020 or so.59 What will reaching peak oil mean?\n\n…\n\nFor instance, former Princeton University geology professor Kenneth Deffeyes claims the peak was hit on Thanksgiving Day, 2005.56 Veteran Houston-based energy analyst Henry Groppe says it occurred in 2006, and that the increases in production since then are due to production of natural gas liquids, not of crude.57 Houston stock analyst Marshall Adkins, of the brokerage firm Raymond James, contends the peak was hit in 2008.58 Other energy watchers claim that the global economic downturn has delayed any discussion about peak oil for the time being, perhaps until 2020 or so.59 What will reaching peak oil mean? Well, it will almost certainly mean higher prices. But how much higher? Groppe, the dean of the Houston energy analysts, with more than five decades of experience in the sector, provides a succinct prediction: “The price of oil will have to be whatever is required to cause total consumption to decline.”60 Put another way, oil prices will rise to whatever level is needed in order to make alternative energy sources more economic and thereby cut demand for oil products.\n\nFinding Community: How to Join an Ecovillage or Intentional Community by Diana Leafe Christian\n\nback-to-the-land, dumpster diving, en.wikipedia.org, hive mind, intentional community, Lewis Mumford, off grid, off-the-grid, oil shock, peak oil\n\nRichard Heinberg is a journalist, editor, lecturer and the author of The Party’s Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Civilizations, Powerdown, and The Oil Depletion Protocol: A Plan to Avert Oil Wars, Terrorism and Economic Collapse. His is widely acknowledged as one of the world’s foremost Peak Oil educators. Introduction Ecovillages and Other Intentional Communities I f you ’ re seeking to create more of a “sense of community”in your life, or to live a more sustainable lifestyle in the good company of friends — especially now with the emergence of Peak Oil issues — this book can offer valuable insights and how-to advice. While you may know little about ecovillages or other kinds of intentional communities, the men and women you’ll meet in these pages will show you what these communities are about and why they’re increasingly appealing.\n\n…\n\nWe’ll consider these issues, and many others, in Chapter 22, “Choosing Your Community.” You also may be considering how life could be during the Peak Oil period of energy decline and ever-escalating costs of fuel, food, and everything else. Maybe you’re thinking a community would be a good place to live during hard times. For a consideration of the pros and cons of living in community relative to self-reliance and safety, see Appendix B, “Can Living in Community Make a Difference in an Age of Peak Oil?” Let’s assume you’ve considered these self-reliance issues, and you’re satisŠed with your course of action. Let’s say that in the communities you’ve visited and are considering further, you resonate with their values and mission and purpose, the people seemed friendly enough, you liked their lifestyle, the place met your aesthetic standards, there were several people you thought you could become good friends with, and you could live with these communities’ housing options, both physically and Šnancially.\n\n…\n\nKeep in mind that there are about ten times the number of people on the planet now as there were when humanity last depended entirely on wood for energy! Although things look bleak for current generations, Peak Oil offers humanity an opportunity to learn and prepare for the inevitable Peak Coal that will impact generations to come. It’s too late to 232 F I N D I N G C O M M U N I T Y hope for a pleasant decline from Peak Oil, but if we pay attention, humanity may choose to plan for a long and orderly Peak Coal. Is Intentional Community the Answer? Julian Darley, author of High Noon for Natural Gas and founder of the Post Carbon Institute, believes civilization is necessarily headed down the path of “re-localization”; that is, reversing the energy-fed globalization trend that has wracked the Earth for the past century or so.\n\nThe Option of Urbanism: Investing in a New American Dream by Christopher B.

The dollar will probably fall in value, making imported goods much more expensive, and the dollar 82 | THE OPTION OF URBANISM may lose its status as the world’s reserve currency. Some forecasters have suggested that peak oil, if it occurs without alternative energy sources under development, could trigger a global depression similar to the 1930s. The U.S. economy will have painted itself into a corner if peak oil arrives and the only option is drivable sub-urban development. James Kunstler, the author of The Long Emergency,58 painted a bleak picture of the United States’ future due to a “prodigious, unparalleled misallocation of resources” for drivable sub-urban development, which he forecasted will result in the collapse of the U.S. economy to a medieval level of output.\n\n…\n\nJames Kunstler, the author of The Long Emergency,58 painted a bleak picture of the United States’ future due to a “prodigious, unparalleled misallocation of resources” for drivable sub-urban development, which he forecasted will result in the collapse of the U.S. economy to a medieval level of output. Although Kunstler’s is doubtless an extreme and overly pessimistic view, the trauma caused to the U.S. drivable sub-urban economy when peak oil is reached, particularly if this realization happens suddenly, which many forecasters predict is possible if not probable, would be severe. There is one conclusion on which nearly all oil production forecasters, including most of the major oil companies, agree: it is not a matter of whether peak oil production arrives, it is only a matter of when, and the majority of forecasters feel that the peak will occur in the first third of the twenty-first century.59 F O R E I G N P O L I C Y.\n\n…\n\nCongressman Bartlett said that this situation poses a historically “unprecedented risk management problem” for the country that could fundamentally disrupt our economy and way of life.55 As reported in a U.S. Department of Energy–funded report in 2005, there is a growing minority opinion that oil production is approaching or may even be at peak production worldwide,56 just as the United States hit peak oil production in 1970. Chevron, the major oil company, had a massive advertising campaign in 2007 pointing this out to consumers. Whenever peak production is reached and the markets know for a fact that the supply will be on a future downward trajectory, the price will probably dramatically increase due to continued worldwide economic growth and demand for oil.\n\nThe Enigma of Capital: And the Crises of Capitalism by David Harvey\n\naccounting loophole / creative accounting, Alan Greenspan, anti-communist, Asian financial crisis, bank run, banking crisis, Bernie Madoff, Big bang: deregulation of the City of London, Bretton Woods, British Empire, business climate, call centre, capital controls, cotton gin, creative destruction, credit crunch, Credit Default Swap, David Ricardo: comparative advantage, deindustrialization, Deng Xiaoping, deskilling, equal pay for equal work, European colonialism, failed state, financial innovation, Frank Gehry, full employment, gentrification, Glass-Steagall Act, global reserve currency, Google Earth, Great Leap Forward, Guggenheim Bilbao, Gunnar Myrdal, guns versus butter model, Herbert Marcuse, illegal immigration, indoor plumbing, interest rate swap, invention of the steam engine, Jane Jacobs, joint-stock company, Joseph Schumpeter, Just-in-time delivery, land reform, liquidity trap, Long Term Capital Management, market bubble, means of production, megacity, microcredit, military-industrial complex, Money creation, moral hazard, mortgage debt, Myron Scholes, new economy, New Urbanism, Northern Rock, oil shale / tar sands, peak oil, Pearl River Delta, place-making, Ponzi scheme, precariat, reserve currency, Ronald Reagan, Savings and loan crisis, sharing economy, Shenzhen special economic zone , Silicon Valley, special drawing rights, special economic zone, statistical arbitrage, structural adjustment programs, subprime mortgage crisis, technological determinism, the built environment, the market place, The Theory of the Leisure Class by Thorstein Veblen, The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, Thomas L Friedman, Thomas Malthus, Thorstein Veblen, Timothy McVeigh, too big to fail, trickle-down economics, urban renewal, urban sprawl, vertical integration, white flight, women in the workforce\n\nThe fact that capitalism has, in the past, successfully navigated around natural barriers, and that it has often done so profitably since environmental technologies have long been big business and can certainly become much bigger (as the Obama administration proposes), does not mean that the nature question can never constitute some ultimate limit. But in terms of the immediate crisis of our time that began in 2006, the question of natural limits cannot, on the surface at least, be accorded primacy of place, with the possible exception of the role of so-called ‘peak oil’ and its impact on energy prices. The issue of peak oil requires, therefore, some commentary. As background it is worth noting that what began to appear as the greatest of all potential natural limits to capitalist development in eighteenth-century Britain was neatly transcended by the turn to fossil fuels and the invention of the steam engine.\n\n…\n\nWhile the situation elsewhere, particularly in Saudi Arabia (where there are rumours that peak production has already been achieved), the Middle East generally, Russia (where President Putin recently declared, though almost certainly for political rather than factual reasons, that peak oil has been passed) and Africa, is harder to monitor, the rise in oil prices from less than $20 a barrel in 2002 to $150 a barrel (and a doubling of gas prices at the pump for US consumers) by the summer of 2008 provided all the popular evidence needed to show that peak oil had arrived and was here to stay. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your view, oil prices suddenly plunged to less than $50 a barrel by the end of 2008, putting a big popular question mark over the relevance of the theory and opening the path towards central bank relaxation of fears over an oil-price rise led inflation and a consequent reduction of interest rates to close to zero in the United States at the end of 2008.\n\n…\n\nThose countries which relied heavily upon the US as a primary export market, particularly in east and south-east Asia, were ultimately pulled down, as were their stock markets, while raw material and commodity producers, which were riding high in early 2008 and considered themselves immune to the crisis, suddenly found themselves in serious difficulties as commodity and raw material prices plunged in the second half of 2008. Oil prices, which had risen to near $150 a barrel in the summer of 2008 (prompting a lot of chatter about ‘peak oil’), were back down to $40 within a few months, causing all manner of problems for Russia, Venezuela and the Gulf States. The collapse of the oil-revenue based building boom in the Gulf saw thousands of migrant workers from India, Palestine and south-east Asia sent home. Mexico, Ecuador, Haiti and Kerala in India, which depended heavily on remittances from those employed elsewhere, suddenly found household incomes drying up as overseas jobs in construction were lost and female domestic workers were cast off.\n\nThe Unwinding: An Inner History of the New America by George Packer\n\n\"World Economic Forum\" Davos, Affordable Care Act / Obamacare, Alan Greenspan, Apple's 1984 Super Bowl advert, bank run, Bear Stearns, big-box store, citizen journalism, clean tech, collateralized debt obligation, collective bargaining, company town, corporate raider, Credit Default Swap, credit default swaps / collateralized debt obligations, DeepMind, deindustrialization, diversified portfolio, East Village, El Camino Real, electricity market, Elon Musk, Fairchild Semiconductor, family office, financial engineering, financial independence, financial innovation, fixed income, Flash crash, food desert, gentrification, Glass-Steagall Act, global macro, Henry Ford's grandson gave labor union leader Walter Reuther a tour of the company’s new, automated factory…, high-speed rail, housing crisis, income inequality, independent contractor, informal economy, intentional community, Jane Jacobs, Larry Ellison, life extension, Long Term Capital Management, low skilled workers, Marc Andreessen, margin call, Mark Zuckerberg, market bubble, market fundamentalism, Maui Hawaii, Max Levchin, Menlo Park, military-industrial complex, Neal Stephenson, Neil Kinnock, new economy, New Journalism, obamacare, Occupy movement, off-the-grid, oil shock, PalmPilot, Patri Friedman, paypal mafia, peak oil, Peter Thiel, Ponzi scheme, proprietary trading, public intellectual, Richard Florida, Robert Bork, Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan: Tear down this wall, Savings and loan crisis, shareholder value, side project, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley billionaire, Silicon Valley startup, single-payer health, smart grid, Snow Crash, Steve Jobs, strikebreaker, tech worker, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, the scientific method, too big to fail, union organizing, uptick rule, urban planning, vertical integration, We are the 99%, We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters, white flight, white picket fence, zero-sum game\n\nHe stood up and said, “Since we’re all here advocating the same thing, and we’re going to go out and preach the gospel, one of the things that needs to be talked about is peak oil—because without it, nothing of what we’re doing makes any sense. How does the administration feel about peak oil?” Jones didn’t appear to be familiar with the Obama policy on peak oil, or even what peak oil was. He handed the question off to a woman from the Department of Energy, who spoke for half a minute, demonstrating that she didn’t know any more than Jones. Afterward, Dean decided that peak oil was just too hard for politicians to handle. It meant the end of suburban, fast-food, industrial America, including Wall Street—no wonder the White House didn’t have a position.\n\n…\n\nOne day, Dean was sitting on a bar stool at his kitchen table, surfing a website called “Whiskey and Gunpowder: The Independent Investor’s Daily Guide to Gold, Commodities, Profits and Freedom” on the lousy dial-up connection that was all you could get in Stokesdale, when he read the words “peak oil.” It meant the point when petroleum extraction would reach its maximum rate and begin to fall off. A geologist with Gulf Oil named M. King Hubbert came up with the theory in 1956. Hubbert predicted that the United States, the world’s largest oil producer, would hit its high point in domestic production around 1970—which was what happened, and which explained why oil prices became so volatile throughout the seventies. Hubbert’s theory was that the rest of the world would reach peak oil right around 2005. Dean stood up at the table, went weak in his knees, and stumbled backward.\n\n…\n\nDean stood up at the table, went weak in his knees, and stumbled backward. He had a vision of what peak oil would mean where he lived (Katrina had already given a glimpse): long-haul trucks coming to a standstill, food stranded on the highways, local people unable to eat or get to work or heat their homes. Riots, revolution. At least, things getting very chaotic very fast. People around here had guns, they had the Scotch-Irish mentality to fight. Then something like martial law, maybe a coup d’état. This was what America was facing. He knew that this moment would stay with him, just like discovering Napoleon Hill. Napoleon wrote about the power of concentration—that if you concentrated your mind on one subject for an extended period of time, things would start popping into your head and what you needed to know would be illuminated to you.\n\nLet them eat junk: how capitalism creates hunger and obesity by Robert Albritton\n\n\"RICO laws\" OR \"Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations\", Bretton Woods, California gold rush, carbon tax, clean water, collective bargaining, computer age, corporate personhood, creative destruction, deindustrialization, Food sovereignty, Haber-Bosch Process, illegal immigration, immigration reform, invisible hand, joint-stock company, joint-stock limited liability company, Kickstarter, land reform, late capitalism, means of production, military-industrial complex, offshore financial centre, oil shale / tar sands, peak oil, planned obsolescence, price stability, profit maximization, profit motive, South Sea Bubble, the built environment, union organizing, Unsafe at Any Speed, upwardly mobile\n\nEven so radical an innovation as transgenic organisms was rushed into use without adequate testing for their possible dramatically damaging and irreversible consequences, largely because corporations had invested so much in developing them that they could not afford a long delay in profiting from their use, and because these same corporations have enormous influence in government circles.5 A central problem with our current food system is its dependence on petroleum at a time when the price of petroleum will continue to climb because of dwindling supplies relative to demand, and at a time when burning fossil fuels contributes to global warming. Breaking the food system’s addiction to petroleum is both necessary and difficult. PEAK OIL AND BIOFUELS Over the past 40 years the US consumption of fossil fuel has increased 20-fold.6 Given the extent to which the US economy, 148 L E T T H E M E AT J U N K including agriculture and food, is tied to petrochemicals, and the likelihood that passing the “peak oil” point globally will lead to large and permanent price increases of petrochemicals, without radical changes, the prospects for the US economy are bleak. In the 1940s for every barrel of oil spent searching for oil, 100 barrels of oil were produced, and now for every barrel of oil spent, we get only 10 barrels.7 As we reach the point of “peak oil”, it takes almost as much oil to expand the supply as is gained by the new supply.\n\n…\n\nThe paper may contain up to 70% post consumer waste. 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Designed and produced for Pluto Press by Curran Publishing Services, Norwich Printed and bound in the European Union by CPI Antony Rowe Ltd, Chippenham and Eastbourne, England Contents Preface viii Part I Introduction 1 1 Introduction General introduction A framework for understanding capitalism Part II Understanding Capitalism 2 3 The Management of Agriculture and Food by Capital’s Deep Structures Capital’s profit orientation Capital, time and speed Capital, space and homogenization Capital and workers Capital and underconsumption Capital, oligopoly and globalization Capital and subjectivity Conclusions The Phase of Consumerism and the US Roots of the Current Agriculture and Food Regimes Consumerism’s profit orientation: petroleum, cars, suburbs and television Consumerism, time, and speed: unchecked toxicity and life on the run Consumerism, space and homogenization: suburbanization and monocultures [ v ] 2 3 10 17 18 26 30 33 37 41 43 46 49 51 56 61 64 vi CONTENTS Consumerism and workers: hiding the health costs of hazardous working conditions and low wages Consumerism and underconsumption: new forms of debt expansion and advertising Consumerism, oligopoly and globalization: a command economy of corporations Consumerism and subjectivity: the politics of fear Conclusions Part III The Historical Analysis of the US-Centred Global Food Regime 66 68 71 72 76 79 4 The Food Regime and Consumers’ Health Capitalist agriculture The case of tobacco The global food regime: a story of irrationality The obesity “epidemic” Sugar Meatification and fat consumption Hunger and starvation Salt Soy Pesticides Food additives Microorganisms Loss of nutrients Genetically modified organisms Supermarkets Fast food chains Conclusions 80 81 84 87 91 95 101 105 108 109 110 113 114 115 118 119 120 122 5 The Health of Agriculture and Food Workers Workers in the US agricultural and food systems Workers in the agricultural and food systems of developing countries Conclusions 124 125 Agriculture, Food Provisioning and the Environment Peak oil and biofuels 146 147 6 133 144 CONTENTS vii Global warming Land and deforestation Fresh water The oceans Species loss Genetically modified organisms Waste Conclusions 154 156 158 159 160 161 163 164 7 Food, Marketing and Choice in the United States Choice and the case of tobacco Marketing Marketing to children Choosing junk foods Consumer sovereignty Conclusions 165 167 171 172 177 178 180 8 Corporate Power, Food and Liberal Democracy Corporations and government Corporations and the legal system Corporations and science Conclusions 182 185 189 190 197 Part IV Conclusions 9 199 Agriculture, Food and the Fight for Democracy, Social Justice, Health and Sustainability Capitalism’s food failures Movements for change Toward a more effective and accountable public sector More accountable corporations Making markets democratically accountable Conclusions 200 201 203 204 205 208 210 Notes Bibliography Index 212 238 251 Preface On December 17, 2007 the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) announced at a press conference in Rome that 37 countries were in a food crisis requiring “urgent steps to protect the poor from soaring food prices.”1 One of the leading international business magazines, the Economist, published only minimal coverage of this crisis until its April 19, 2008 issue (four months later).\n\n…\n\nIn the 1940s for every barrel of oil spent searching for oil, 100 barrels of oil were produced, and now for every barrel of oil spent, we get only 10 barrels.7 As we reach the point of “peak oil”, it takes almost as much oil to expand the supply as is gained by the new supply. For example, the ecological damage involved in retrieving oil from the Alberta oil sands, and the amount of energy it takes to produce a single barrel of oil from the tar sands, raise serious doubts about the desirability and viability of the entire project.8 The Canadian oil sands are enriching many people at immense long-term environmental costs.\n\nThe Great Disruption: Why the Climate Crisis Will Bring on the End of Shopping and the Birth of a New World by Paul Gilding\n\n\"World Economic Forum\" Davos, airport security, Alan Greenspan, Albert Einstein, biodiversity loss, Bob Geldof, BRICs, carbon credits, carbon footprint, carbon tax, clean tech, clean water, Climategate, commoditize, corporate social responsibility, creative destruction, data science, decarbonisation, energy security, Exxon Valdez, failed state, fear of failure, geopolitical risk, income inequality, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), John Elkington, Joseph Schumpeter, market fundamentalism, mass immigration, Medieval Warm Period, Naomi Klein, negative emissions, Nelson Mandela, new economy, nuclear winter, Ocado, ocean acidification, oil shock, peak oil, Ponzi scheme, precautionary principle, purchasing power parity, retail therapy, Ronald Reagan, shareholder value, systems thinking, The Spirit Level, The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, union organizing, University of East Anglia, warehouse automation\n\nIf we have to eliminate the fossil-fuel industry to cut CO2 emissions, we will have lost $3 trillion of economic activity. If we don’t eliminate them, we will face runaway climate change with the potential for the loss of the insurance industry, the collapse of the food supply, and geopolitical crises and instability over water and refugees. If we get growth back on track as it was before 2008, then we will face peak oil and food shortages with prices soaring to new highs that stop growth again. The issue is not therefore whether growth is stopping, the issue is how it will stop, when we will accept that it has, and how we will then adjust to our new reality. So when you hear arguments in defense of growth, consider them not as the case against ending it, because this is not a decision we will get to make.\n\n…\n\nIt would require economic indicators that we were actually hitting the limits to really gain attention. The most obvious candidates for these were commodity prices, particularly food and oil. Oil was a good candidate for convincing evidence because it had long been predicted that we would at some point reach “peak oil”—the point after which oil extraction can no longer be increased. There was a clear and established link between economic growth and oil consumption that made the “growth hitting its limits” logic simple for people to understand. This would also be a good test of the techno-optimist view—that markets self-correct because as resources run out, prices rise and alternatives come onstream.\n\n…\n\nThis would also be a good test of the techno-optimist view—that markets self-correct because as resources run out, prices rise and alternatives come onstream. (While this is obviously correct in theory and over time, there are considerable challenges in the politics and economics of the transition and timing unless the price rises are steady and slow, which they rarely are.) Peak oil is a good example of limits being reached because of the suddenness of the impact, comparable conceptually to the collapse of fisheries we discussed earlier. It’s not that oil will soon run out; in fact nowhere close to it. Part of the way through global supplies, the rate of extraction of oil reaches a maximum as remaining reserves become increasingly difficult to extract.\n\nThe Locavore's Dilemma by Pierre Desrochers, Hiroko Shimizu\n\nair freight, back-to-the-land, biodiversity loss, Biosphere 2, British Empire, Columbian Exchange, Community Supported Agriculture, creative destruction, edge city, Edward Glaeser, food desert, food miles, Food sovereignty, global supply chain, Great Leap Forward, Gregor Mendel, intermodal, invention of agriculture, inventory management, invisible hand, Jane Jacobs, land tenure, megacity, moral hazard, mortgage debt, oil shale / tar sands, oil shock, peak oil, planetary scale, precautionary principle, profit motive, refrigerator car, Steven Pinker, tacit knowledge, the market place, The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, trade liberalization, Tragedy of the Commons, Tyler Cowen, Upton Sinclair, urban sprawl\n\nAs one University of Copenhagen economist observed at the time, the Danish agricultural performance was only as good as it turned out to be because the “Germans paid for the war effort,” and, overall, the Danish economy consumed some of its accumulated capital and suffered “heavy financial loss[es].”68 In Denmark, as elsewhere, increased national self-sufficiency would have been unsustainable in the long run and the adoption of this policy on an ever smaller geographical scale (i.e., locavorism), even less so. Peak Oil and Locavorism69 Another common belief among locavores in terms of food security is that their prescription prepares us for the unavoidable re-localization of our food system that will follow the imminent peak and later depletion of our supply of “cheap petroleum” in the next century. This argument, however, is fallacious, whether or not one believes in the peak oil rhetoric. For starters, even assuming a world in which hostile aliens have emptied all of our best oil fields, all credible analysts (there are always a few pessimistic outliers) tell us that, with minimal efforts to look beyond the ample economically recoverable reserves available at the moment, we could easily have enough coal to last us several centuries.70 It is true that rebuilding our global food supply chain around (mostly liquefied) coal would be more expensive, inconvenien,t and environmentally damaging than around petroleum-derived liquid fuels (which is why they displaced coal in the first place), but it does not present any insurmountable problem—indeed, South Africa’s Sasol, the world’s largest producer of coal-based liquids, already manufactures a completely synthetic jet fuel.\n\n…\n\nMegastores Shantytowns and Social Capital Higher Food Prices and Humanistic Pursuits Chapter 3 - Myth #2: Locavorism Delivers a Free Economic Lunch The Broken Window Fallacy Physical Geography and Agricultural Specialization The Importance of Latitude Economies of Scale The Debate Over Land Use Time and Trade-offs Chapter 4 - Myth #3: Locavorism Heals the Earth On the Unbalance of Nature Locavorism and the (Mis)management of Natural Resources The Basic Problems with Food Miles Blame It on the Poor People Green Cities and Trade Chapter 5 - Myth #4: Locavorism Increases Food Security The Third Horseman The Slaying of the Third Horseman (with Long Distance Trade) Agricultural Resilience: Diversification vs. Monocultures Overspecialization and Food Security Locavorism and Military Security Peak Oil and Locavorism Climate Change, Locavorism, and Food Security Chapter 6 - Myth #5: Locavorism Offers Tastier, More Nutritious, and Safer Food The Changing Human Body Taste Nutrition Food Safety Chapter 7 - Well-Meaning Coercion, Unintended Consequences, and Bad Outcomes A Brief Historical Overview of Government Intervention in Food Markets Public Food Reserves Food Export Restrictions and Bans Price Floors Price Ceilings On Appointing “Good” Czars Unleashing the Invisible Hand CONCLUSION EPILOGUE NOTES INDEX Copyright Page To Ferenc (“Ferko”) Csillag (1955–2005), dear friend and mentor.\n\n…\n\nFurthermore, because the liquid fraction of petroleum used to power container ships is for the most part the dirtiest and cheapest (so-called “bunker fuel”) for which there is at present little other demand,71 higher crude prices would have a much more pronounced effect on other segments of the food supply chain than on long distance maritime transportation. At any rate, the Peak Oil rhetoric should not be taken seriously. Pessimistic energy forecasts have a long history—predictions of imminent petroleum shortages were even made before the first oil well was drilled in Western Pennsylvania in the middle of the 19th century—and a truly awful track record.72 The main problem historically is that energy doomsayers never quite understood that humans are not only mouths to feed, but also brains to think and arms to work, along with the fact that resources are not fixed and permanent things that exist in and of themselves, but instead are created by always renewable human intellect and labor.\n\nA Line in the Tar Sands: Struggles for Environmental Justice by Tony Weis, Joshua Kahn Russell\n\naddicted to oil, Bakken shale, bilateral investment treaty, call centre, carbon footprint, clean water, colonial exploitation, conceptual framework, corporate social responsibility, decarbonisation, Deep Water Horizon, en.wikipedia.org, energy security, energy transition, Exxon Valdez, failed state, gentrification, global village, green new deal, guest worker program, happiness index / gross national happiness, high-speed rail, hydraulic fracturing, immigration reform, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), investor state dispute settlement, invisible hand, Jevons paradox, liberal capitalism, LNG terminal, market fundamentalism, means of production, megaproject, military-industrial complex, Naomi Klein, new economy, Occupy movement, off-the-grid, oil shale / tar sands, peak oil, profit maximization, public intellectual, race to the bottom, smart grid, special economic zone, WikiLeaks, working poor\n\nThis means that returns on investment are much lower in the tar sands than in places with cheaper production costs (such as the Middle East, historically.) At the same time, enormous capital investment is needed to enable the extraction, transport, and refining of bitumen. So it was not until world oil prices began to rise quickly in the face of growing limits to conventional supplies—reflecting the dynamics of “peak oil”10—that the tar sands industry became sufficiently profitable for many large-scale energy and financial corporations to ramp up their investments. Here, it is also helpful to remember that oil, coal, and natural gas account for roughly four-fifths of the world’s net primary energy supply (that is, the sum of energy used in all production, transportation, and households).11 Of these, oil is the most crucial, as both the greatest source of energy generation and the overwhelming source of liquid fuel that powers global transportation systems.\n\n…\n\nThe basic truth starts with the fact that fossil fuels permeate nearly every aspect of global capitalism and have a central function in powering the relentless pursuit of growth and profits. Thus, the race to expand the tar sands and other forms of extreme fossil energy is indeed necessary to perpetuate the current order of things and, at least in the near term, the success in this has been reflected in the diminished talk of peak oil. (Here, along with the tar sands, the explosive rise of fracking for oil and gas is especially notable.) Of course, extreme energy projects can mean great earnings for financiers from Wall Street to Bay Street, and for energy corporations from Calgary to Texas to Europe—though we must be clear that these industries also relate to jobs for ordinary people in countless ways, from the tar sands themselves, to automobile assembly lines, to a food system that runs on oil.\n\n…\n\nThese methods are what I refer to here as “extreme” extraction, from turning coal into liquid forms of energy, to hydraulic fracturing (or “fracking”) to open huge swaths of natural gas and trapped “tight” oil in the US and Russia, and the net result threatens to add years of life to the dying fossil fuel economy. While some industry champions celebrate this extreme extraction as having put questions of “peak oil” behind us, it in fact illustrates a central pillar: the fossil fuel industry is now turning its attention to scraping the proverbial bottom of the barrel. Of the various forms of extreme extraction, the tar sands in Canada are quite likely the most well known, a gigaproject that is slowly metastasizing into a teraproject, now widely recognized as the largest industrial project in human history.\n\nSuper Thinking: The Big Book of Mental Models by Gabriel Weinberg, Lauren McCann\n\nAbraham Maslow, Abraham Wald, affirmative action, Affordable Care Act / Obamacare, Airbnb, Albert Einstein, anti-pattern, Anton Chekhov, Apollo 13, Apple Newton, autonomous vehicles, bank run, barriers to entry, Bayesian statistics, Bernie Madoff, Bernie Sanders, Black Swan, Broken windows theory, business process, butterfly effect, Cal Newport, Clayton Christensen, cognitive dissonance, commoditize, correlation does not imply causation, crowdsourcing, Daniel Kahneman / Amos Tversky, dark pattern, David Attenborough, delayed gratification, deliberate practice, discounted cash flows, disruptive innovation, Donald Trump, Douglas Hofstadter, Dunning–Kruger effect, Edward Lorenz: Chaos theory, Edward Snowden, effective altruism, Elon Musk, en.wikipedia.org, experimental subject, fake news, fear of failure, feminist movement, Filter Bubble, framing effect, friendly fire, fundamental attribution error, Goodhart's law, Gödel, Escher, Bach, heat death of the universe, hindsight bias, housing crisis, if you see hoof prints, think horses—not zebras, Ignaz Semmelweis: hand washing, illegal immigration, imposter syndrome, incognito mode, income inequality, information asymmetry, Isaac Newton, Jeff Bezos, John Nash: game theory, karōshi / gwarosa / guolaosi, lateral thinking, loss aversion, Louis Pasteur, LuLaRoe, Lyft, mail merge, Mark Zuckerberg, meta-analysis, Metcalfe’s law, Milgram experiment, minimum viable product, moral hazard, mutually assured destruction, Nash equilibrium, Network effects, nocebo, nuclear winter, offshore financial centre, p-value, Paradox of Choice, Parkinson's law, Paul Graham, peak oil, Peter Thiel, phenotype, Pierre-Simon Laplace, placebo effect, Potemkin village, power law, precautionary principle, prediction markets, premature optimization, price anchoring, principal–agent problem, publication bias, recommendation engine, remote working, replication crisis, Richard Feynman, Richard Feynman: Challenger O-ring, Richard Thaler, ride hailing / ride sharing, Robert Metcalfe, Ronald Coase, Ronald Reagan, Salesforce, school choice, Schrödinger's Cat, selection bias, Shai Danziger, side project, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley startup, speech recognition, statistical model, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Steven Pinker, Streisand effect, sunk-cost fallacy, survivorship bias, systems thinking, The future is already here, The last Blockbuster video rental store is in Bend, Oregon, The Present Situation in Quantum Mechanics, the scientific method, The Wisdom of Crowds, Thomas Kuhn: the structure of scientific revolutions, Tragedy of the Commons, transaction costs, uber lyft, ultimatum game, uranium enrichment, urban planning, vertical integration, Vilfredo Pareto, warehouse robotics, WarGames: Global Thermonuclear War, When a measure becomes a target, wikimedia commons\n\nThis concept was actually popularized with oil, as peak oil is usually defined as the point in time when the maximum amount of oil is being extracted from Earth. After peak oil, the decline may be a slow one, but it will have begun, with oil production falling each year instead of rising. People have predicted peak oil many times. As far back as 1919, David White, the chief geologist of the U.S. Geological Survey, predicted in “The Unmined Supply of Petroleum in the United States” that the U.S. “peak of production will soon be passed, possibly within three years.” Many similar predictions have come and gone, and peak oil has still not occurred.\n\n…\n\nMany similar predictions have come and gone, and peak oil has still not occurred. What has happened instead is that increased demand has driven innovation in how to get more oil out of the ground, continually increasing yearly production. Now, though, a better argument for peak oil is starting to form as the oil market’s underlying structure is proving to be unhealthy. The effects of climate change are looming. Solar energy is quickly becoming cost-competitive with oil on a global scale. Increasing cost-competitiveness of electric cars and the advent of autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing services are threatening to collapse the car and truck markets as we know them.\n\n…\n\n., 38

late nineteenth century, with the exceptional interruptions of the 1970s and in the period running up to the peak in 2014. The renewables lobby is keen to argue that wind and solar are becoming grid-competitive. While they relied on a belief in peak oil this might well have turned out to be correct. But peak oil is nonsense: the renewables have not only to reduce their costs, but to do so faster than fossil fuels. The more successful renewables are, the lower the demand for oil, and hence the lower the price of oil as production centres on the incredibly cheap sources in the Middle East.\n\n…\n\nSource ISBN: 9780008404468 Ebook Edition © September 2020 ISBN: 9780008404475 Version: 2020-07-15 Dedication To Susie, Oliver, Laura, Amelie and Jake CONTENTS Cover Title Page Copyright Dedication Preface List of abbreviations Introduction PART ONE: 30 WASTED YEARS Chapter one: No progress Chapter two: Kyoto and Paris Chapter three: Going it alone PART TWO: THE NET ZERO ECONOMY Chapter four: Living within our environmental means Chapter five: The price of carbon Chapter six: Net zero infrastructures Chapter seven: Natural sequestration, offsetting, and carbon capture and storage PART THREE: AGRICULTURE, TRANSPORT AND ELECTRICITY Chapter eight: Agriculture: green, prosperous and low-carbon Chapter nine: Reinventing transport Chapter ten: The electric future Conclusions: A no regrets plan Endnotes Bibliography Index Acknowledgements About this Book About the Author About the Publisher PREFACE I thought I had finished writing about climate change a while ago, with my two books on the subject – The Carbon Crunch: How We’re Getting Climate Change Wrong – And How to Fix It and Burn Out: The Endgame for Fossil Fuels – and ‘The Cost of Energy Review’ (the Helm Review) I undertook for the UK government in 2017.[1] Back in 2012, in The Carbon Crunch I asked the question: why has so little been achieved? I wanted to puncture the complacency, and especially the peak oil fantasy – that we were going to run out of fossil fuels, and hence the oil price was heading north, making what looked like expensive renewables cheap by comparison. I followed this up in 2017 with Burn Out, pointing out that we have enough oil and gas to fry the planet many times over, and that the exit from fossil fuels will be messy for the great oil-producing countries, and messy for the renewables, as the price of oil and gas falls back.\n\n…\n\nWhat you see is a large and, in most cases, growing market over the next 20–30 years. You look at all the fossil fuel projects that cross your desk. You do the analysis. Perhaps you take a pessimistic view about future fossil fuel prices, given the sheer abundance of the resources available, which make a nonsense of all those peak oil and peak gas forecasts that were peddled by politicians and analysts up until the price collapsed in 2014 and then again in 2020.[15] You will be able to balance some of the possible price falls with cost reductions as technology keeps marching on, and every bit as fast as for the competing renewables.\n\nWhat We Say Goes: Conversations on U.S. Power in a Changing World by Noam Chomsky, David Barsamian\n\nbanking crisis, British Empire, Doomsday Clock, failed state, feminist movement, Howard Zinn, informal economy, liberation theology, mass immigration, microcredit, Mikhail Gorbachev, Monroe Doctrine, oil shale / tar sands, operational security, peak oil, RAND corporation, Ronald Reagan, Seymour Hersh, Thomas L Friedman, union organizing, Upton Sinclair, uranium enrichment, Washington Consensus\n\nAnyone who wants to apply for fissile materials can apply to the IAEA for peaceful use.39 That’s a very sensible proposal. As far as I’m aware, there is only one country in the world that has accepted it—Iran. Try to find a reference to that somewhere. David Korten has a new book out called The Great Turning.40 He describes a perfect storm that is looming consisting of three elements: peak oil, climate change, and the collapse of the U.S. dollar. Those are all problems, but I think a much more serious one than any of them is the threat of nuclear war. It’s not talked about much except in professional circles. If you read the literature by strategic analysts on disarmament, nuclear war is regarded as a serious and growing threat, a threat that’s been very sharply increased by the Bush administration’s aggressive militarism.\n\n…\n\nAlmost every economist knows that the United States is going to have to do something about the huge trade deficit. And there is only one thing you can do, and that is to weaken the dollar, which will increase inflation and the cost of commodities for consumers, but also could lead to a rise in exports and in manufacturing jobs. As for peak oil, that might actually be a blessing if it’s close. People talk about it as a catastrophe, but what they’re failing to notice is that continued use of oil could cause a worse catastrophe, maybe only one generation from now. Oil is finite. So at some point it will no longer be economical to use oil.\n\n…\n\nThere are many ambiguities, including whether it’s not going to be economically possible to refine oil from tar sands or to exploit other oil that’s currently hard to access. It may turn out that Venezuela has the largest reserves in the world, by some measures.42 It’s just very hard to get to. But peak oil will come. If this situation leads to sensible steps toward reconstructing our society and we accommodate to the fact that we cannot keep polluting the atmosphere, we cannot keep destroying the environment or else we’ll all die; if that happens sooner, fine. If it means that the Bush administration or a successor administration will mitigate this impending catastrophe, that would be good.\n\nThe New Map: Energy, Climate, and the Clash of Nations by Daniel Yergin\n\n\"RICO laws\" OR \"Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations\", 3D printing, 9 dash line, activist fund / activist shareholder / activist investor, addicted to oil, Admiral Zheng, Albert Einstein, American energy revolution, Asian financial crisis, autonomous vehicles, Ayatollah Khomeini, Bakken shale, Bernie Sanders, BRICs, British Empire, carbon tax, circular economy, clean tech, commodity super cycle, company town, coronavirus, COVID-19, decarbonisation, deep learning, Deng Xiaoping, Didi Chuxing, disruptive innovation, distributed generation, Donald Trump, driverless car, Edward Snowden, Elon Musk, energy security, energy transition, failed state, Ford Model T, geopolitical risk, gig economy, global pandemic, global supply chain, green new deal, Greta Thunberg, hydraulic fracturing, Indoor air pollution, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), inventory management, James Watt: steam engine, John Zimmer (Lyft cofounder), Kickstarter, LNG terminal, Lyft, Malacca Straits, Malcom McLean invented shipping containers, Masayoshi Son, Masdar, mass incarceration, megacity, megaproject, middle-income trap, Mikhail Gorbachev, mutually assured destruction, new economy, off grid, oil rush, oil shale / tar sands, oil shock, open economy, paypal mafia, peak oil, pension reform, power law, price mechanism, purchasing power parity, RAND corporation, rent-seeking, ride hailing / ride sharing, rolling blackouts, Ronald Reagan, Russian election interference, self-driving car, Silicon Valley, smart cities, social distancing, South China Sea, sovereign wealth fund, Suez crisis 1956, super pumped, supply-chain management, TED Talk, trade route, Travis Kalanick, Twitter Arab Spring, Uber and Lyft, uber lyft, ubercab, UNCLOS, UNCLOS, uranium enrichment, vertical integration, women in the workforce\n\nThe Middle East has been shaped, of course, not only by the maps of frontiers but by different kinds of maps—of geology, of oil and gas wells, of pipelines and tanker routes. The oil and gas, and the revenues and riches and power that flow from them, remain central to the identity of the region. Yet the oil price collapse that began in 2014 has fed into a new debate about the future of oil. Not much more than a decade ago, the world worried about “peak oil,” the idea that oil supplies would run out. The focus has shifted to “peak demand”: how long consumption of oil will continue to grow and when it will begin to decline. Will oil lose its value and importance in the decades to come? The demand collapse for oil in 2020 has further fueled the urgency for oil exporters to diversify and modernize their economies, which Abu Dhabi had begun in 2007 with its Vision 2030, and which Saudi Arabia is now trying to do in double time.\n\n…\n\nBy the 1980s, the domestic petroleum industry was meeting the nation’s needs and also producing a surplus of oil that was exported, principally to Japan.1 But economic growth sparked domestic demand for oil that eventually grew faster than domestic production. In 1993, China crossed an historic line—one that would shape its perspectives to the present day. It became a net importer of oil. Since then it has become increasingly dependent on imports. In the 2000s, alarms went off in Beijing about fear of peak oil supply, the world’s running out of oil, and the economic growth machine faltering. Apprehension grew about the possibility of bruising competition for constricted supplies, especially with the United States. Similar fears were also current in Washington in those years. In the decade and a half following its entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, China’s oil consumption increased two and a half times over.\n\n…\n\nBy this time, the door had already opened to the use of electricity in autos, owing to the uptake of hybrids, which combined an electric motor with a gasoline engine, stretching out the miles per gallon.2 Meanwhile, interest was growing in “clean tech” and renewables among Silicon Valley venture capital firms, in response to rising concern about climate change and the conviction that much money could potentially be made from them. That made it easier for Tesla to raise investment. The rapid rise in oil prices in those years reinforced the fears of “peak oil”—running out of petroleum—which made non-gasoline-powered transportation look increasingly interesting. And of critical importance were government policies—incentives, subsidies, and regulations on fuel economy and emissions. In California, CARB increased the targets for zero-emission vehicles and, with climate moving up the agenda, introduced limits on CO2 emissions.\n\nAround the World in 80 Plants by Steven Barstow\n\nfood miles, peak oil, the market place\n\nTaraxacum officinale FAMILY: Asteraceae CHINESE: Yaoyongpugongying ENGLISH: Common Dandelion FRENCH: Dent de Lion, Laiteron, Pissenlit GERMAN: Löwenzahn, Kuhblume, Pusteblume GREEK: Agrioradiko ITALIAN: Tarassaco Comune JAPANESE: Seiyou Tanpopo RUSSIAN: Oduvanchik, Oduvanchik Lekarstvennyi SPANISH: Achicoria amarga, Diente de León I never dreamed that my seed saving activities would lead me for a short period of time to be in control of future homeland security in the US, Canada, Europe and Japan! I’m dreaming? Illusions of grandeur? Well, read on… You’ve heard of peak oil, right? Let me introduce you to peak rubber! The price of rubber is being driven through the ceiling through a combination of factors. This includes increasing demand from developing economies increasing oil prices (synthetic rubbers are derived from crude oil). In addition, there is a serious leaf blight disease affecting the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Peak oil would also lead to falling availability of rubber in the world, unless natural sources could be boosted. Added to this, the wish in the US and other countries to be able to produce rubber at home, rather than relying on production in tropical countries where Hevea can be cultivated, led to renewed research into a species which previously found favour during World War II when natural rubber supplies from the tropics last dried up.\n\n…\n\nImagine a world without ready access to supermarkets offering more or less any vegetable at any time of the year. Actually, it doesn’t take much imagination. Here in Norway, I can remember that only 25 years ago there were only a handful of vegetables available in supermarkets in winter and the way things are going (climate change, peak oil etc.), in another 20 years seasonal vegetables should once again dominate our consumption. People have in the meantime become more accepting of weird and wonderful vegetables. Therefore, we should be looking at how to diversify locally produced vegetables, so that we can maintain a wide variety of local produce.\n\n…\n\nP. 170, 217, 239, 253, 260 Josselyn, John 166 Joyce,

more money for spares and new equipment, in case President Bush took some kind of military action. Whatever anyone thinks about Fidel Castro’s rule, Cuba is a fascinating object lesson in the new economics. Cuba has already lived through the economic and environmental shocks that climate change and peak oil hold in store for the rest of the world. Its sudden loss of access to cheap oil imports and its economic isolation were so extreme in 1990 at the end of the Cold War, and its reaction to the shock was so contrary to orthodox approaches, and so successful, that it was dubbed in Washington the ‘anti-model’.1 Then oil imports dropped by over half.\n\n…\n\nTaken together, the Green New Deal urged a programme of re-regulating finance and taxation plus a huge transformational programme aimed at substantially reducing the use of fossil fuels and, in the process, tackling the unemployment and decline in demand caused by the credit crunch. It involved policies and new funding mechanisms that will reduce emissions and allow us to cope better with the coming energy shortages caused by peak oil. The importance was not so much the details of the plan, but its pattern. What the Green New Deal understood was that these crises needed to be tackled together, in a way that modern government finds difficulty doing. There is no point in tackling the crises alone, nor is it possible. Tackling climate change needs to be done alongside redistributing the wealth of the planet.\n\n…\n\n(John Kenneth) 41, 51 gambling 14–15, 152 Gandhi, Mohandas (Mahatma) 18, 19, 21, 110, 112 Gates,
