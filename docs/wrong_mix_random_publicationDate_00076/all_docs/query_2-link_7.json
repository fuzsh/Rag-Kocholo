Ideally, the network infrastructure is supposed to have carefully designed strategies to scale up monitoring tools and techniques as the network grows, over time. Without this, there can be network performance challenges, downtimes due to failures, and most importantly, penetration attacks. These can lead to monetary losses as well as loss of reputation. Thus, there is a need for best practices to monitor network infrastructure in an agile manner. Network security monitoring involves collecting network packet data, segregating it among all the 7 OSI layers, and applying intelligent algorithms to get answers to security-related questions. The purpose is to know in real-time what is happening on the network at a detailed level, and strengthen security by hardening the processes, devices, appliances, software policies, etc. The Multi Router Traffic Grapher, or just simply MRTG, is free software for monitoring and measuring the traffic load on network links. It allows the user to see traffic load on a network over time in graphical form.\n\nbeginners-guide-to-observability.pdf\n\nbeginners-guide-to-observability.pdfValerioArvizzigno1\n\nThis document provides an introduction to observability. It defines observability as the ability to answer any question about a business or application at any time no matter how complex the infrastructure. Achieving observability requires instrumenting systems to collect metrics, traces, and logs and analyzing that data. Observability goes beyond monitoring to provide insights across all layers of a business. The document outlines the pillars of observability and how to achieve visibility through proper data collection and analysis tools. It provides examples of how organizations have benefited from observability solutions.\n\nHow to Leverage Open Architectures for Existing Systems\n\nHow to Leverage Open Architectures for Existing SystemsReal-Time Innovations (RTI)\n\nWatch the replay: http://event.on24.com/r.htm?e=830086&s=1&k=BF6DC01D4350A4D22655D80CBED9B3C5&partnerref=rti Economic realities dictate that \"new\" distributed systems are almost never entirely new creations. Existing capabilities which cannot be readily duplicated at minimal cost are often necessary and even critical components of otherwise new systems. How we address achieving interoperability with these legacy systems – whose data and interfaces are often less than completely defined – can be a critical cost and schedule risk item. Open standards such as the DoD's UAS Control Segment (UCS) Architecure and the Open Group's Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) provide architecture and data design standards which support new development and provide a means of rigorously capturing the data semantics of information in existing interfaces. At the protocol and implementation level, the OMG's Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard provides proven, cost effective design patterns which support the bridging and/or the migration of existing systems with new, open architectures.

Abstract: Network Slicing keeps growing in significance in the academic and industrial communities. Network Slicing can be defined from different functional or behavioral perspectives, as well as from different viewpoints depending on the stakeholder (e.g., verticals, solution providers, infrastructure owners) and the technical domain (e.g. cloud data centers, radio access, packet/optical transport networks). Standardization bodies and open source projects are being involved in some forms of network slicing support. How far are these views from each other? Is fragmentation leading to incompatible approaches or is there some hope of convergence, at least at conceptual levels? What is the next frontier in Network Slicing? These and other questions will be thrown to our panel experts after introducing their lightning viewpoints.

Our paper presents a study where we used open source NIDPS software. We show that NIDPS detection performance can be weak in the face of high-speed and high-load traffic in terms of missed alerts and missed logs. To counteract this problem, we have proposed and evaluated a solution that utilizes QoS, queues and parallel technologies in a multi-layer Cisco Catalyst Switch to increase NIDPSs detection performance. Our approach designs a novel QoS architecture to organise and improve throughput-forwardplan traffic in a layer 3 switch in order to improve NIDPS performance.\n\nPerformance Evaluation of a Network Using Simulation Tools or Packet Tracer\n\nPerformance Evaluation of a Network Using Simulation Tools or Packet TracerIOSRjournaljce\n\nToday, the importance of information and accessing information is increasing rapidly. With the advancement of technology, one of the greatest means of achieving knowledge are, computers have entered in many areas of our lives. But the most important of them are the communication fields. This study will be a practical guide for understanding how to assemble and analyze various parameters in network performance evaluation and when designing a network what is necessary to looking for to remove the consequences of degrading performance. Therefore, what can you do in a network performance evaluation using simulation tools such as Network Simulation or Packet tracer and how various parameters can be brought together successfully? CCNA, CCNP, HCNA and HCNP educational level has been used and important setting has been simulated one by one. At the result this is a good guide for a local or wide area network. Finally, the performance issues precautions described. Considering the necessary parameters, imaginary networks were designed and evaluated both in CISCO Packet Tracer and Huawei's eNSP simulation program. But it should not be left unsaid that the networks have been designed and evaluated in free virtual environments, not in a real laboratory. Therefore, it is impossible to make actual performance appraisal and output as there is no actual data available.\n\nHandover Parameters Self-optimization by Q-Learning in 4G Networks\n\nHandover Parameters Self-optimization by Q-Learning in 4G NetworksMohamed Raafat OMRI محمد رأفت عمري\n\nWith more and more customers using mobile communications it is important for the service providers to give their customers the best Quality-of-Service (QoS) they can afford. Many providers have taken to improving their networks and make them more appealing to customers. One such improvement that providers can deliver to their customers is to enhance reliability of the network meaning that customers' calls are less likely to be dropped by the network. This dissertation explores improving the reliability of a 4G network by optimizing the parameters used in handover. The process of handover within mobile communication networks is very important since it allows users to move around freely while still staying connected to the network. The most important parameters used in the handover process are the Time-to-Trigger (TTT) and Hysteresis (hys). These parameters are used to determine whether a base station is better than the serving base station by enough offset to warrant a handover taking place. The challenge in optimizing the handover parameters is that there is a fine balance that needs to be struck between calls being dropped due to a handover failing and the connection switching back and forth between two base stations, unnecessarily, wasting the network resources. In this project, we propose to use a machine learning technique known as Q-Learning to optimize the handover parameters by generating a policy that can be followed to adjust the parameters as needed. It was found that the implemented Q-Learning algorithm was capable of improving the Handover performance by minimizing the chosen Handover related Key Performance Indicators (KPI).\n\nAutomating a World-Class Technology Conference; Behind the Scenes of CiscoLive\n\nAutomating a World-Class Technology Conference; Behind the Scenes of CiscoLiveNetwork Automation Forum\n\nSpeaker: Jason Davis, Cisco Systems Abstract: Since 1987 CiscoLive has been the premiere event for networking education, collaboration and fun.

I am willing to bet the answer to this is quite often! Usually we have a list of our favorite commands that we will always use to quickly narrow down a specific problem type. Switch reloaded unexpectedly? \"show reload cause\" Fan failure? \"show environment power\" Fiber link reporting high errors or down on your monitoring system? \"show interface counters errors\", \"show interface transceiver\", \"show interface Mac detail\" Outputs like the above examples help you quickly pinpoint the source of your failures for remediation. SSH'ing into the boxes and running these commands by hand is time consuming, especially if you are for example a NOC dealing with numerous failures throughout the day. Most switch platforms have API's now and you can instead program against them to get these outputs in seconds. I will go over a variety of examples and creative ways to use these scripts for optimal use of your troubleshooting time and to get you away from continually doing these repetitive tasks by hand. NOTE: My tutorial examples will be using python and the Arista pyeapi module with Arista examples, but the concepts can easily be transferred to other platforms and languages.\n\nApplying Platform Engineering Principles to On-Premises Network Infrastructure\n\nApplying Platform Engineering Principles to On-Premises Network InfrastructureNetwork Automation Forum\n\nSpeaker: Kaon Thana, The New York Times Abstract: The challenges and solutions of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in the Classic Enterprise Network.

In this talk I will discuss the challenges we faced over the last few years adopting automation practices in the brownfield and and the real-world solutions (with examples) we used to overcome the pitfalls.\n\nEvolving the Network Automation Journey from Python to Platforms\n\nEvolving the Network Automation Journey from Python to PlatformsNetwork Automation Forum\n\nThis document discusses the challenges of network automation and proposes moving from a Python-based approach to platform engineering. It argues that previous attempts at network automation through abstractions, standardization, and single sources of truth have failed because networks are more complex than other IT domains. The document advocates separating automation and orchestration domains to allow for specialized tooling in each area. It also suggests that networks will evolve through exposing programmable interfaces without restrictions rather than top-down standardization. The document outlines how Itential supports these goals through its focus on network automation, integration of cloud and traditional networks, and partner ecosystem.\n\nA Real-World Approach to Intent-based Networking and Service Orchestration\n\nA Real-World Approach to Intent-based Networking and Service OrchestrationNetwork Automation Forum\n\nSpeaker: Chris Cummings, ESnet Abstract: Network Orchestration is a defining factor in next generation networks, enabling operators to deliver more consistent and reliable services. Using the collaboratively developed Workflow Orchestrator and other commercial and open source tools, ESnet has been able to successfully Orchestrate and Automate network configuration deployment for large swaths of the ESnet6 network. This approach has enabled rapid deployment of new network services, as well as ensuring that configuration standards are well enforced when deploying network services. During this talk, we will provide a brief history of automation at ESnet, Introduce The Workflow Orchestrator, dive into what our goals were for orchestration and automation in the ESnet6 project, describe the technology and process that we used to meet those goals, and then provide a live demonstration of ESnet’s orchestration tooling in action. Finally, we will discuss the lessons we learned along the way while developing this tooling, providing time for Q&A.\n\nAutoCon 0 Day One Keynote: John Willis\n\nAutoCon 0 Day One Keynote: John WillisNetwork Automation Forum\n\nJohn Willis has been a leader in the DevOps community since the onset.
