All ten episodes of the highly anticipated series will be available for streaming on Peacock starting Thursday, July 18.\n\nThe series, created by Robert Rodat, draws inspiration from Daniel P. Mannix’s nonfiction work of the same name. It delves into the dark, spectacle-driven arena of ancient Roman entertainment, highlighting the murky underbelly of the gladiatorial games that captivated the masses.\n\nEmmerich and Marco Kreuzpaintner share directing duties, each overseeing five episodes of the series.\n\nThe executive production team is a powerhouse lineup featuring Emmerich, Harald Kloser, Gianni Nunnari, Rodat, Stuart Ford, Lourdes Diaz, Miguel A. Palos Jr., Kreuzpaintner, Herbert G. Kloiber, Martin Moszkowicz, Oliver Berben, Jonas Bauer, Charles Holland, and Namit Malhotra."
