        "text": "\"You bury your doubts... You bury your memories of the war... But in the core of your being, we're all cowards before death.\" Sony Pictures Classics has revealed the full official trailer for the film Freud's Last Session, directed by filmmaker Matt Brown, based on Mark St. Germain's play of the same name. The film premiered at AFI Fest in Los Angeles last month (here's the teaser), and it will sneak into the awards season debuting in select theaters later in December before 2023 is over. On the eve of WWII, two of the greatest minds of the 20th Century, author C.S. Lewis and psychologist Sigmund Freud, converge for their own personal battle over the existence of God, each with opposing views. Freud's Last Session interweaves the lives of Freud & Lewis, past, present, and through fantasy, bursting from the confines of Freud's study on a dynamic journey. Starring Anthony Hopkins as Freud, Matthew Goode as Lewis, with Liv Lisa Fries and Jodi Balfour. The compelling film explores questions facing all of us; in history a moment that echoes current conflicts, seeks to understand freewill, and explores how these renowned intellects find connection within difference. An intriguing premise, I just hope it doesn't denigrate either side too much. Have a look.\n\nHere's the main official trailer (+ poster) for Matthew Brown's Freud's Last Session, from YouTube:\n\nYou can rewatch the first teaser for Brown's Freud's Last Session right here to view the first look again.\n\nSeptember 1939: Days after Hitler invades Poland, and as the threat of German bombs rattles England, Sigmund Freud (Anthony Hopkins) watches the world go mad. Having fled Nazi forces invading his homeland, Freud has brought his family from Vienna to London, where he's visited by author and Oxford theologian C.S. Lewis (Matthew Goode). Lewis — whose Chronicles of Narnia books would later gain worldwide acclaim — is an atheist turned Christian now hoping to confront the \"Father of Psychoanalysis\" about the gap between science & religion, faith & logic, and how studying the mind may miss the path of the soul. Through a colorful, sometimes contentious day-long debate, the two work to see the other's point of view while Britain enters WWII, Freud's daughter Anna (Liv Lisa Fries) reconciles hard truths within herself and her own career as an analyst, and Freud faces the cancer that'll soon be the cause of his death."
