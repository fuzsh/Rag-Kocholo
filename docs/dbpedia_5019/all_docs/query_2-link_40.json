        "text": "Even if his career began and ended with Hannibal Lecter, Anthony Hopkins would still be considered one of the definitive actors of our era. Luckily, Hannibal only scratches the surface of Hopkins' long illustrious career. He's equally adept at playing the hero or villain; the leader of men or the lowly servant. And this range has served him well over the decades.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nHopkins will be returning to theaters this week as he reprises his role as the all-powerful but ever-weary Odin in Thor: The Dark World. With that in mind, we've assembled a list of the ten best films Hopkins has appeared in, from early fare like The Bounty up through more recent efforts like Thor.\n\n10. The Edge\n\nDavid Mamet writes punchy, dialogue-heavy scripts that any actor would love to dig into. Hopkins got his chance when he starred in The Edge, a wilderness survival film written by Mamet and directed by Lee Tamahori. Hopkins played Charles Morse, a billionaire who made up for his lack of wilderness experience with a helpful survival guide and a photographic memory. Alec Baldwin starred opposite as Bob Green, a photographer stranded alongside Morse who may or may not be plotting to kill him and steal his wife and fortune. The Edge proved to be a terrifically intense film as the two men struggled against the elements and a relentless Kodiak bear. Mamet's flair for dialogue and his fascination with machismo and displays of aggression were in full force, and both actors suited their roles well.\n\n9. Bram Stoker's Dracula\n\nWith Bram Stoker's Dracula, director Francis Ford Coppola attempted a more faithful adaptation of the original novel than viewers were typically accustomed to. And while it included many of the characters and settings that are usually ignored or downplayed, the movie was really characterized by its focus on vampire sensuality and its efforts to cast Dracula as a more tragic figure.\n\nThis approach worked for the most part. Unfortunately, Bram Stoker's Dracula is pretty much the ultimate mixed bag when it comes to casting. In playing Jonathan Harker, Keanu Reeves affected a British accent about as well as Kevin Costner did in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Winona Ryder was only marginally better as Mina Harker. But the film benefited greatly from Gary Oldman's magnetic performance as Dracula and Hopkins' brutish, imposing Abraham Van Helsing. The two developed the Dracula/Van Helsing rivalry into one worthy of the ages.\n\n8. Thor\n\nFew comic book heroes (or their mythological inspirations, for that matter) have daddy issues quite as massive as Thor. And so the challenge with bringing Thor to the big screen isn't just in finding an actor with the physical presence and charisma to play the god of thunder, but casting someone with enough gravitas and intimidation factor to put the haughty young god in his place.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nLuckily, Marvel found men suited to both tasks. Hopkins made for a great Odin opposite Chris Hemsworth's Thor. He conveyed the proud, regal side of the king of Asgard, while also convincingly portraying a father fed up with his son's antics. The only problem with Hopkins' Odin was that he had so few scenes where the character wasn't locked in his Odinsleep. Hopefully the sequel can rectify that problem.\n\n7. The Bounty\n\nThere have been many variations on the familiar tale of the 1787 mutiny on the H.M.S. Bounty over the years. But with a cast as impressive as the one in Richard Donaldson's film version, a new take was more than justified. Donaldson based his take on Richard Hough's book, Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian.\n\nHopkins starred as Bligh, the captain of the ill-fated vessel. Mel Gibson played his friend, Fletcher Christian, while Daniel Day Lewis played Ship's Master John Fryer. Liam Neeson appeared in an early role as the treacherous Charles Churchill.\n\nThe Bounty offered an engrossing look at these troubled men and their fateful clash aboard the Bounty. Hopkins himself succeeded in portraying Bligh as a sensible, hard-working man who was forever affected by his friend's betrayal and his loss of fortunes.\n\n6. Meet Joe Black\n\nFor a lot of people, Meet Joe Black was the movie they had to pay money for in order to see the first Phantom Menace teaser trailer. But there was a decent drama waiting for anyone who stayed past the credits. Loosely based on the 1934 film Death Takes a Holiday, Meet Joe Black cast Hopkins as Bill Parish, a billionaire facing imminent death and Brad Pitt as Death himself.\n\nThe movie saw Parrish serve as Death's earthly guide, introducing him to others as Joe Black and fighting to stave off his own death just long enough to set his affairs in order. Of course, Death being in the body of Brad Pitt, he had his own issues with falling in love with Parrish's daughter.\n\n5. Nixon\n\nNixon is the second of director Oliver Stone's trilogy of Presidential films. The movie presents a fractured look at Richard Nixon's life via a series of flashbacks that occur during the tumultuous Watergate scandal. Stone aimed to paint a different portrait of Nixon than the familiar \"not a crook\" villain frequently spoofed in pop culture. His Nixon was heavily flawed and tortured both physically and psychologically.\n\nStone didn't opt for any of the more obvious choices when it came to casting Nixon. Even the studio was reluctant to accept Hopkins in the role. But Hopkins won over the doubters and naysayers in the end. He helped mold Nixon into a sympathetic figure, opting for subtlety where others might have hammed it up. And the performance nabbed him an Oscar nomination in the end\n\n4. Howards End\n\nBefore there was Downton Abbey, there was Howards End. Adapted from E.M Forster's classic novel, the movie focused on three very different branches of British social structure in the early 20th Century. Emma Thompson and Helena Bonham Carter played two unmarried, middle class sisters, while Vanessa Redgrave and Hopkins played an upper class couple who live at the titular estate. Sam West played a young clerk who represented the lower class.\n\nHowards End enjoyed strong performances all around that brought the classic source material to life. Thompson won most of the acclaim for her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel, which ended up nabbing her an Oscar, but Hopkins also delivered one of his more memorable performances as a man first repulsed and then entranced by his neighbor.\n\n3. The Remains of the Day\n\nOne year after Howards End made a big splash, Hopkins and Emma Thompson were back sharing the screen together in another film directed by James Ivory and adapted from a popular novel. Even the subject matter was familiar, shifting from early to mid-20th Century British estate life. But in this case, Hopkins' character was far lower on the social strata. He played James Stevens, head butler of Darlington House. Even as the estate was sold to an American congressman (Christopher Reeve), Stevens received a letter from Miss Kenton (Thompson), a former colleague and romantic interest who sparks feelings of longing and regret about a life that might have been.\n\nOnce again, this was a period piece that soared on the strength of Hopkins and Thompson's performances. Hopkins in particular displayed an impressive range and subtlety as he explored the many conflicting emotions of a man torn between his duty and his deeper desires.\n\n2. The Elephant Man\n\nFollowing his debut with Eraserhead, David Lynch broke into the mainstream with this biopic about Joseph Merrick (or John Merrick, as he's called in the film), the man whose physical deformity immortalized him as \"The Elephant Man.\" In hindsight, it was unusually sentimental territory for a filmmaker who usually dabbles in darker subject matter, but still a great film.\n\nJohn Hurt played Merrick, a heavily demanding role that required him to emote beneath a mountain of makeup and prosthetics cast from Merrick's actual skull. He succeeded so well that the role remains one of his best, and there was a huge outcry at the time that the prosthetics made him ineligible for an Academy Award nomination.\n\nBy comparison, Hopkins had the less physically demanding role of Dr. Treves, the surgeon who took in Merrick and allowed him to live a more comfortable and humane existence at London Hospital, but the kindly character suited his strengths well.\n\n1. Silence of the Lambs\n\nHannibal Lecter will always be Hopkins' definitive role as an actor, even as the new Hannibal TV series introduces a far different take on the popular psychiatrist/serial killer/cannibal/lover of fine food and art. Silence of the Lambs was directed by Jonathan Demme and adapted from Thomas Harris' second novel to feature Lecter. When a deranged serial killer known as Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) begins kidnapping female victims, a young FBI trainee named Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is tasked with interviewing an incarcerated Lecter for possible insight into Buffalo Bill's motives. Thus begins a game of mental cat and mouse between the idealistic agent and the ever-scheming Lecter.\n\nHopkins wasn't even the first to play the character. (That distinction goes to Brian Cox in 1986's Manhunter.) But from the moment he first appeared on screen, Hopkins defined the villain and made him as captivating as he was terrifying. Lecter became the sort of villain audiences couldn't help but root for as he manipulated his way into freedom and tormented his new companion.\n\nSilence of the Lambs spawned two more sequels with Hopkins reprising his role. Unfortunately, neither really captured the simple brilliance of the first. But even though Hopkins has passed the torch to Mads Mikkelsen, it's hard to imagine any actor eclipsing his version of Hannibal Lecter.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nJesse is a writer for various IGN channels.
