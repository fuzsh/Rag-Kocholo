        "text": "The credits for the new movie “Hitchcock” state that it is based on a book by Stephen Rebello. It isn’t, not really, though details and true stories from the book have been slipped into the mix amid amusing performances, historical re-creations and heavily perfumed fertilizer. The book, “Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of ‘Psycho,’ ” is a fast, diverting read that, true to its title, tracks how the master of suspense, sometimes with surprising effort, made his influential, perverse shocker. “Hitchcock,” by contrast, is rather like Norman Bates, that nervous pretty boy with mommy issues and a bobbing Adam’s apple, in that it too takes extravagant liberties with the dead.\n\nIt does so largely by doing what some disreputable Hitchcock biographical books have done: It reads him through his work, as if his movies were a direct reflection of his mind, soul and deepest, darkest desires. To that end, it is 1959 and Hitchcock — a fine Anthony Hopkins buried in a fat suit and under distracting facial prosthetics — is casting about for a new project. He’s just come off one of his greatest films, “North by Northwest,” which delighted the public and critics, a nice upturn after the disappointing reception of another of his supreme achievements, “Vertigo.” (In September, after five decades, “Vertigo” bumped “Citizen Kane” from the No. 1 spot in Sight and Sound’s critics’ poll of “the greatest films of all time.”)\n\nAt the premiere of “North by Northwest” a reporter asks Hitchcock, “You’re the most famous director in the history of the medium, but you’re 60 years old, shouldn’t you just quit while you’re ahead?” Thus challenged Hitchcock searches for “something fresh, something different.” What he finds is “Psycho.” Written by Robert Bloch, the 1959 novel was inspired by the macabre crimes of Ed Gein, the Wisconsin serial killer who decorated his home with human body parts and can be blamed for legions of horror films, including “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.” (Gein liked to walk around wearing the skin and body parts of his female victims, behavior echoed in “The Silence of the Lambs,” in which Mr. Hopkins plays a serial killer who’s the ultimate sophisticate.)\n\nBut Hitchcock isn’t simply taken with “Psycho,” he also becomes possessed by it. As he tries and sometimes struggles to make the movie (the studio isn’t keen on the material), the book and increasingly its inspiration take him over, disturbing his sleep and invading his dreams. At the same time he is having trouble with his wife, Alma (a crisp, overglammed Helen Mirren), who’s grown grievously unhappy with his fixation on the blondes who populate his work. She finds some refuge in a relationship with a sycophantic screenwriter, Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston), whose hovering attention contrasts sharply with Hitchcock’s standoffishness. Hitchcock, though, is apparently a much smaller man without Alma, who is at once his adviser, crutch and cinematic savior."
