        "text": "Of all the recurring themes at the movies, none is less constant or more prolific than the Holocaust. Every year introduces a few new ones. But although the subject is forever a sober and thoughtful one (to my knowledge, no comedy has ever been made about it, unless you count The Producers and other well-deserved political pokes by Charlie Chaplin, Jack Benny and Mel Brooks at Adolf Hitler, a subject ripe for ridicule if ever there was one) it’s worth remembering that not every film about the Holocaust (or, for that matter, World War II movies in general) is depressing beyond despair. Many are educational, historically illuminating and life-affirmingly positive. Into that category, add One Life, a noble, restrained and admirable footnote to history about Nicholas Winston, a mild-mannered British stockbroker with no driving political interests who saved hundreds of Jewish refugee children from Nazi extinction during the war without any military experience or otherwise personal knowledge about how to fight bureaucracy to improve a world in lethal danger of destruction. In another in a long line of memorable, effective and inspired performances that resonate with truth, Anthony Hopkins is a magnificent centerpiece.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

Increasingly unsettled by reports of innocent children killed in the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, Winton made a spur-of-the-moment decision to join a group of British friends in Prague for a first-hand look at the fates of children victimized by their German invaders. Appalled by what he witnessed, the young Winton (played impressively in the first part of the film by Johnny Flynn) returned to London a changed man, determined to aid helpless refugees escape their cruel fates with decency and courage.\n\nConscripting his indefatigable mother Babette (Helena Bonham Carter), herself a German refugee, as his partner in what became years of raising funds, acquiring visas and breaking British laws to transport 669 unaccompanied children from Prague to the safety of the UK and keep them there. The film’s most harrowing scene occurs when the ninth train miraculously scheduled to arrive from Poland was destroyed and hundreds of children were forcibly removed, returned to their families, and destined for the concentration camps.\n\nDespite his phenomenal accomplishments, “Nicky” Winton remained humble and almost anonymous into his retirement years during the 1980s, when his ever-patient wife Greta (wonderful Lena Olin) finally pleaded with him to clean out the aging files gathering dust in his office. For the first time in years, he decluttered their home and, one by one, discovered long-buried folders containing the names of all the children he saved, sparking memories of his forgotten wartime efforts."
