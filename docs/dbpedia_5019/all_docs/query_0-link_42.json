        "text": "THE REMAINS OF THE DAY MOVIE CAST: ANTHONY HOPKINS & PETER VAUGHAN\n\nShown together in a black and white publicity photograph for the 1993 film\n\nPhotograph signed: \"Anthony Hopkins\" and \"Peter Vaughan\", B/w 10x8. Publicity photograph for the 1993 film The Remains of the Day. The Remains of the Day (1993), based on the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, starred Hopkins as a butler whose loyalty is challenged by his master's Nazi ties and the love of a new housekeeper, played by Emma Thompson. It was nominated for eight Oscars, including Best Actor for Hopkins. ANTHONY HOPKINS burst full-flower onto the American scene in 1974 as an ex-Nazi doctor in QB VII. The actor became typed in intense, neurotic roles for the next several years in films such as Audrey Rose (1976), Magic (1978) and Bounty (1982). On TV, Hopkins played roles as varied (yet somehow intertwined) as Adolph Hitler, accused Lindbergh-baby kidnapper Bruno Richard Hauptmann and the Hunchback of Notre Dame. In 1991, Hopkins won an Academy Award for his bloodcurdling portrayal of murderer Hannibal \"The Cannibal\" Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, continuing the role in its sequels. In 1995, Hopkins earned considerable acclaim and an Oscar nomination for his uncanny interpretation (done without elaborate makeup) of President Richard M. Nixon in Nixon. Hopkins garnered another Oscar nomination in 1998, this time for Best Supporting Actor, for his work in the slavery epic Amistad. British character actor Peter Vaughan (1923-2016) appeared in films and television series for over 55 years, most notably Straw Dogs (1971), Citizen Smith (1977-1979), and Brazil (1985). Vaughan was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Our Friends in the North (1996). His final screen credit came as the beloved Master Aemon in the HBO series Game of Thrones (from 2011 to 2015).
