        "text": "Warner Bros. has released the trailer for its BBC Films collaboration, One Life, based upon a true story.\n\nThe film stars both legendary actor Anthony Hopkins and Operation Mincemeat star Johnny Flynn as real-life hero Nicholas Winton at different parts in his life.\n\nIn his youth, Winton became worried about all the Jewish children who had fled Nazi persecution in late 1930's Germany, and travelled from London to Prague to try and get as many out as possible.\n\nRelated: Anthony Hopkins lines up TV role in Gladiator-style series\n\nAlthough he managed to rescue almost 700 children before the borders closed, Winton spent his life racked with guilt over all the children he couldn't save.\n\nThat is, until 50 years later where he was invited to the studio of That's Life!, and was surprised to meet some of the children he saved as adults and hear about the lives they've lived.\n\nThe synopsis reads: \"Nicky is haunted by the fate of the children he wasn't able to help, and so it's not until he's surprised by the survivors on live television that he can accept that when facing devastating atrocities, saving even one life is a victory, and the British public learn the truth about the hero hidden in their midst.\"\n\nRelated: Ncuti Gatwa and Helena Bonham Carter lead all-star remake of Dickens classic\n\nAs well as Hopkins and Flynn, the film also stars Helena Bonham Carter as Babi Winton, Alias actress Lena Olin as Grete Winton, Jonathan Pryce as Martin Blake, and Samantha Spiro as Esther Rantzen.\n\nOne Life will next be shown at the London Film Festival, on October 12, and will receive a cinematic release on January 5, 2024 in the United Kingdom, whilst the United States will see it a little bit earlier on New Year's Day."
