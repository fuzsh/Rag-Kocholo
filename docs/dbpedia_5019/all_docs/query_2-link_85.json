        "text": "Sony Pictures Classics has acquired the film “Freud’s Last Session” starring Anthony Hopkins and Matthew Goode from Westend Films in a deal that includes all rights in North America, the Middle East, India, Eastern Europe (excluding Russia), Turkey, and worldwide airlines.\n\nThe film is directed by Matt Brown (“The Man Who Knew Infinity”) and written by Mark St. Germain (“The God Committee”) based on his play of the same name.\n\nThe film is described as the following: “On the eve of the Second World War and the end of his life, Sigmund Freud (Hopkins) invites iconic author C.S. Lewis (Goode) for a debate over the existence of God. Innovatively, the film explores Freud’s unique relationship with his lesbian daughter Anna, and Lewis’ unconventional romance with his best friend’s mother. ‘Freud’s Last Session’ interweaves past, present and fantasy, bursting from the confines of Freud’s study on a dynamic journey.”\n\nProduction is set to begin in the UK in late January 2023.\n\n“Freud’s Last Session” reunites Sony Pictures Classics with Hopkins following numerous collaborations, including the distributor’s first release 30 years ago, “Howard’s End,” and “The Father” in 2020, for which Hopkins won the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nThe film will also feature cinematography by Richard Pope, B.S.C., who has been nominated for two Oscars, including one for the Sony Pictures Classics release “Mr. Turner,” as well as production design by Luciana Arrighi, who won the Oscar for Best Art Direction for “Howards End.”\n\nThe deal was brokeredby CAA Media Finance with Westend Films, who also made deals in Australia (Sharmill Films), Italy (Adler), Portugal (NOS), Israel (United King) and Greece (Spentzos).\n\nSony Pictures Classics and Westend Films have worked together on previous titles such as Ralph Fiennes’ “The Invisible Woman” and Joseph Cedar’s “Footnote.”"
