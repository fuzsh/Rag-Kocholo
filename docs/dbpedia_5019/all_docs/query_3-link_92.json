        "text": "\"Why would come here to see me if you disagree so passionately with my views?\" Sony Pictures Classics has unveiled a first look teaser trailer for a film titled Freud's Last Session, directed by filmmaker Matt Brown, based on Mark St. Germain's play of the same name. The film is premiering at AFI Fest in LA this weekend, hence this trailer out now, and it will sneak into the awards season debuting in select theaters in December at the end of the year. On the eve of WWII, two of the greatest minds of the 20th Century, author C.S. Lewis and psychologist Sigmund Freud, converge for their own personal battle over the existence of God, each with opposing views. Freud's Last Session interweaves the lives of Freud & Lewis, past, present, and through fantasy, bursting from the confines of Freud's study on a dynamic journey. Starring Anthony Hopkins as Freud, Matthew Goode as Lewis, with Liv Lisa Fries and Jodi Balfour. The film explores questions facing all of us; in history a moment that echoes current conflicts, seeks to understand freewill, and explores how two renowned intellects find connection within difference. Looks like this will be riveting.\n\nHere's the first look teaser trailer for Matthew Brown's Freud's Last Session, direct from YouTube:\n\nSeptember 1939: Days after Hitler invades Poland, and as the threat of German bombs rattles England, Sigmund Freud (Anthony Hopkins) watches the world go mad. Having fled Nazi forces invading his homeland, Freud has brought his family from Vienna to London, where he's visited by author and Oxford theologian C.S. Lewis (Matthew Goode). Lewis — whose Chronicles of Narnia books would later gain worldwide acclaim — is an atheist turned Christian now hoping to confront the \"Father of Psychoanalysis\" about the gap between science & religion, faith & logic, and how studying the mind may miss the path of the soul. Through a colorful, sometimes contentious day-long debate, the two work to see the other's point of view while Britain enters WWII, Freud's daughter Anna (Liv Lisa Fries) reconciles hard truths within herself and her own career as an analyst, and Freud faces the cancer that'll soon be the cause of his death."
