        "text": "Since making his big-screen debut in 1968's The Lion in Winter, Sir Anthony Hopkins has become a household name in film and one of the most prolific actors of all time. The Welsh star featured in classic 20th-century movies from some of the biggest directors including David Lynch, Richard Attenborough, Steven Spielberg, and Francis Ford Coppola. Hopkins' acting prowess has seen him garner two Academy Awards for Best Actor from six nominations, two Emmy wins, and numerous other accolades including a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in 1993. Known for his dramatic and oftentimes terrifying roles, the seasoned actor is an ace at diving deep into roles, preferring to find spontaneity in a scene despite his masterful ability to memorize his lines.\n\nHopkins is behind some of cinema's most iconic characters including Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, and Red Dragon, but his prolific career has spanned so much more. He's played a Norse god, multiple doctors, and two U.S. presidents. With more than 100 acting credits, it's hard to narrow down the best, most moving, and critically acclaimed roles of his career, but we shall do our best.\n\nHere are EW's picks, in no particular order, for the best Anthony Hopkins roles, from Oscar winners like The Silence of the Lambs and The Father to fan favorites like Westworld and Thor.\n\n01 of 18\n\nDr. Hannibal Lecter, The Silence of the Lambs (1991)\n\nHopkins brought the brilliant and cunning Dr. Hannibal Lecter to life in Jonathan Demme's multiple Oscar-winning thriller, The Silence of the Lambs. Behind bars, Lecter is enlisted by the determined FBI rookie Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to catch a new serial killer, \"Buffalo Bill\" (Ted Levine).\n\nHopkins disappears into the unblinking cannibal, turning him into one of cinema's most iconic characters, with memorable quotes and spine-tingling stares into the camera. He's been parodied countless times, and while other actors have stepped into the role before and after with great acumen, namely Brian Cox and Mads Mikkelsen, no one's played Lecter with such incredible prestige as Hopkins.\n\nWhere to watch The Silence of the Lambs: Max\n\n02 of 18\n\nDr. Frederick Treves, The Elephant Man (1980)\n\nIn The Elephant Man, Hopkins plays Dr. Frederick Treves, a surgeon who rescues a heavily disfigured man who is a mistreated circus sideshow attraction in one of the least Lynchian movies of David Lynch's career.\n\nWhile John Hurt is the standout of the film, providing depth and empathy to the character of John Merrick, Hopkins' portrayal of the real-life doctor and author adds a human connection to the story that makes us confront our humanity.\n\nWhere to rent The Elephant Man: Amazon Prime Video\n\n03 of 18\n\nPope Benedict XVI, The Two Popes (2019)\n\nHopkins and his counterpart, Jonathan Pryce, were both nominated for Academy Awards in this intimate and tense biopic about the conversations and fragile alliance that the new, liberal Pope Francis (Pryce) forges with the conservative Pope Benedict XVI (Hopkins).\n\nHopkins is fantastic as the stubborn pope at the height of scandal, meandering from moments of real malice to unexpected tenderness. Watching Pope Benedict's uncharacteristically excited viewing of a World Cup match with Pope Francis is an enduring image of harmony.\n\nWhere to watch The Two Popes: Netflix\n\n04 of 18\n\nLt. Col. John Frost, A Bridge Too Far (1977)\n\nIn this epic retelling of Operation Market Garden, the Allies' attempt to capture numerous important bridges in the Netherlands during World War II, Hopkins plays the role of John Frost, a British airborne officer who became a legend after his heroics during the operation that led to his capture.\n\nHopkins does well to stand out in a film that also features Laurence Olivier, Sean Connery, Michael Caine, James Caan, Robert Redford, Gene Hackman, and more big-name stars. Director Richard Attenborough was so amazed by Hopkins' talent that he called him \"the greatest actor of his generation\" and the two began a long, fruitful working relationship.\n\nWhere to watch A Bridge Too Far: Amazon Prime Video\n\n05 of 18\n\nJohn Quincy Adams, Amistad (1997)\n\nIn this Steven Spielberg-directed drama, Hopkins plays the former president of the United States, John Quincy Adams. Then a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts, Adams is tapped to represent 53 captured Africans from Sierra Leone in front of the Supreme Court in order to help free them.\n\nWhile not as critically adored as other Spielberg films, Amistad shines in its character portrayals. Hopkins' high-pitched voice and moral gusto as the former president earned him an Oscar nomination alongside a cast that features Djimon Hounsou, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew McConaughey.\n\nWhere to watch Amistad: Amazon Prime Video\n\n06 of 18\n\nRichard M. Nixon, Nixon (1995)\n\nHopkins steps into the shoes of another former U.S. president; this time, he plays the disgraced 37th president, Richard Nixon, in Oliver Stone's Nixon. In this three-hour-plus biopic that sometimes veers into fantasy and speculation, Hopkins' portrayal of the life of Nixon from his early years into his presidency is one of his best.\n\nThe actor's pinpoint voice and mannerisms of the president work in showcasing a repressed and determined figure. As EW's critic wrote of Hopkins' acting, \"He uses his duplication of Nixon's neurotic mannerisms to burrow right into his mind.\"\n\nWhere to rent Nixon: Amazon Prime Video\n\n07 of 18\n\nStevens, The Remains of the Day (1993)\n\nA selfless butler who risked his life prior to World War II soon realizes that his loyalty to his employer may have been misguided in this Oscar-nominated adaptation of the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro.\n\nAs the butler who has spent 30 years of his life in total control, Hopkins provides depth and nuance to a man grappling with his morality and a burgeoning love for the head housekeeper, Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson). Thanks to the chemistry between the two leads, The Remains of the Day is one of those movies that makes you feel deep love for the characters at the heart of the film.\n\nWhere to rent The Remains of the Day: Amazon Prime Video\n\n08 of 18\n\nAnthony, The Father (2020)\n\nHopkins quite surprisingly won his second Oscar over the late Chadwick Boseman for his portrayal of a man living with dementia who refuses all help from his daughter (Olivia Colman).\n\nHis characterization of a stubborn man is subtle, oftentimes humorous, and heartbreaking. The result is, as EW's critic wrote, \"a profoundly moving meditation not just on perception and reality, but also on the limits of familial care.\"\n\nWhere to rent The Father: Amazon Prime Video\n\n09 of 18\n\nAdolf Hitler, The Bunker (1981)\n\nHopkins is no stranger to assuming the guise historical figures — in 1981, he won an Emmy for playing Adolf Hitler in a portrayal of the final weeks of his life during World War II.\n\nHis role is well-nuanced and precise, a stunning movie for the small screen that is well-acted and impressively moving.\n\n10 of 18\n\nAlfred Hitchcock, Hitchcock (2012)\n\nHopkins is fantastic in the role of the master of suspense, legendary director Alfred Hitchcock. In Hitchcock, his relationship with his wife (Helen Mirren) is explored while he attempts to make one of his most famous movies, 1960's Psycho.\n\nIn a cast that features Scarlett Johansson, Danny Huston, Toni Collette, Michael Stuhlbarg, Ralph Macchio, and Jessica Biel, Hopkins stands tall, embodying the spirit of the eccentric and driven director.\n\nWhere to rent Hitchcock: Amazon Prime Video\n\n11 of 18\n\nOdin, Thor franchise (2011–2017)\n\nThere has been no shortage of big-name actors entering the MCU and Hopkins was one of the most high-profile ones to fill the ever-expanding universe when he stepped into the shoes of Odin, King of Asgard and father to Chris Hemsworth's Thor.\n\nIt was clear that he had fun in the role of Odin throughout the original Thor trilogy, adding emotional resonance to a fractured family. A standout moment is Hopkins playing Loki disguised as Odin in Taika Waititi's Thor: Ragnarok.\n\nWhere to watch Thor, Thor: The Dark World, and Thor: Ragnarok: Disney+\n\n12 of 18\n\nProfessor Abraham Van Helsing, Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992)\n\nWhile Gary Oldman embodies the classic creature of horror, his counterpart, the vampire hunter Van Helsing, is portrayed by the commanding Hopkins in this colorful, fun, and blood-soaked adaptation of Bram Stoker's work from legendary director Francis Ford Coppola.\n\nAs the doctor and vampire hunter, Hopkins is a great presence on screen, sometimes just as scary as Dracula, cursing his foes and providing moving oration in this period horror-drama.\n\nWhere to rent Bram Stoker's Dracula: Amazon Prime Video\n\n13 of 18\n\nBurt Munro, The World's Fastest Indian (2005)\n\nStepping out of his usual wheelhouse, Hopkins stars in this high-octane biopic about Burt Munro, the New Zealander determined to fix up a 1920 Indian motorcycle to set the land speed world record.\n\nThe Academy Award winner does well in the shoes of the lesser-known historical figure in this film that highlights his passion and tenacity so well that we can't help but to cheer for him.\n\nWhere to watch The World's Fastest Indian: Amazon Prime Video\n\n14 of 18\n\nDr. Robert Ford, Westworld (2016–2018)\n\nIn a cast of big names and intriguing roles, Hopkins did his best to stand out as Dr. Robert Ford, creator of the robot amusement park on the hit HBO series Westworld.\n\nAs the omnipotent Dr. Ford, he was able to balance fear with fatherly compassion and mystery in a role that was suited to his ability as an actor. While the show would continue after his departure, Dr. Ford and his monologues and godlike presence would be sorely missed.\n\nWhere to buy Westworld: Amazon Prime Video\n\n15 of 18\n\nPierre Bezukhov, War & Peace (1972)\n\nEarly in his career, Hopkins played the central character of Leo Tolstoy's acclaimed piece of world literature in the 1972 BBC miniseries, War & Peace.\n\nAs the young count who inherits a large fortune, the actor is brilliant as a boy stumbling through the world trying to find love and peace amongst a world in turmoil. His performance earned him a BAFTA, a precursor to a career of award-winning and critically acclaimed work.\n\n16 of 18\n\nCol. William Ludlow, Legends of the Fall (1994)\n\nBased on a novella by Jim Harrison, Legends of the Fall is an epic tale about three brothers (Brad Pitt, Henry Thomas, and Aidan Quinn) living with their father (Hopkins) in remote Montana as they deal with love and betrayal during the brink of the first World War.\n\nWhile Pitt is the star of the film, Hopkins manages to shine in his own right as the patriarch of a family teetering on the edge of being torn apart by the shared love of the same woman (Julia Ormond). The jaded old colonel does his best to remain calm and keep his sons in line as he struggles with forces outside of his control.\n\nWhere to watch Legends of the Fall: Netflix\n\n17 of 18\n\nCorky, Magic (1978)\n\nHopkins proves he doesn't even need to appear onscreen to be as memorable as ever in this eerie psychological horror film about a failed magician who finds success as a ventriloquist — until his dummy begins to control his life.\n\nThe actor lends his voice to the dummy, Corky, adding perfect cadence and brilliant suspense to the terrifying trope of deadly dolls.\n\nWhere to watch Magic: Peacock\n\n18 of 18\n\nC.S. Lewis, Shadowlands (1993)\n\nHopkins reunites with his A Bridge Too Far director, Richard Attenborough, in this passionate love story. Here Hopkins plays C.S. Lewis, the acclaimed writer of The Chronicles of Narnia, who finds love when he meets the poet Joy Gresham (Debra Winger).\n\nHis quiet, shy portrayal of the author makes him even more relatable as he finds himself grappling with the newfound relationship that draws him out of his ever-reserved routine.\n\nWhere to rent Shadowlands: Amazon Prime Video"
