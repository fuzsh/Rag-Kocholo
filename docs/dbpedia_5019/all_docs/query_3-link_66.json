        "text": "After the 2020 Cannes Film Festival was canceled by the pandemic and the 2021 edition was scaled back — even kisses were forbade on the red carpet — the lavish French Riviera cinema soiree is set to return with a festival that promises to be something like normal.\n\nThis combination of photos shows key art for \"The Runaway Bunny,\" premiering March 25 on HBO Max, left, \"Tina,\" a documentary about Tina Turner premiering March 27 on HBO Max, center, and \"City on a Hill,\" a new series premiering March 28 on Showtime. He has grasped, at least for a proud man like Anthony, how one’s ego keeps fighting a battle it doesn’t know is already lost.”Ad— In Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin's revealing documentary “Tina,” Tina Turner surveys her tumultuous and extraordinary life. The film, which debuts Saturday on HBO and HBO Max, includes intimate interviews with the 81-year-old “Queen of Rock ‘n’ Roll,\" along with previously unseen footage, audio tapes and personal photos. The piercing Romanian documentary “Collective” was nominated for both best documentary and best international film — something only one previous film ( \"Honeyland,\" in 2020) — has ever managed to do.

Pictures, Netflix, A24, Searchlight Pictures, Focus Features, Amazon Studios, Netflix via AP)Normally, Academy Award nominations mean an Oscar bump in box office. This year, streaming services and digital rental platforms may get a bounce. On March 26, it will become available to rent on premium on-demand platforms and soon after for digital rental. — “Promising Young Woman”: Emerald Fennell's pitch-black #MeToo revenge comedy, from Focus Features, is available for $19.99 rental on digital platforms. Fennell, in her directorial debut, was nominated for best director and best screenplay, and star Carey Mulligan is up for best actress.\n\nIt’s a rare year when most of the Oscar nomination surprises are good ones, but 2020 was also a rare year for moviegoing and awards campaigns. Here’s our rundown of the snubs and surprises in the 93rd Academy Award nominations. FEMALE DIRECTORS GET THEIR SHOTFor 92 Academy Awards, only 5 women had ever been nominated for best director and never more than one in the same year. This year, the dubious honor goes to Glenn Close for her portrayal of Mamaw in Ron Howard’s adaptation of J.D. Starring Mads Mikkelsen, the film was well received, but seemed like a long shot for the major Oscars categories.\n\nThis image released by Netflix shows Michael Potts, from left, Chadwick Boseman and Colman Domingo in \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.\" (David Lee/Netflix via AP)NEW YORK – Half a year after his death, Chadwick Boseman was posthumously nominated for an Academy Award on Monday for his final performance in “Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.”The nomination for best actor was widely expected but still historic. Boseman is the first Black performer ever nominated posthumously for an Oscar. He was nominated alongside Steven Yeun (\"Minari\"), Riz Ahmed (\"Sound of Metal\"), Anthony Hopkins (\"The Father\") and Gary Oldman (\"Mank\"). Three months later, the August Wilson adaptation “Ma Rainey's Black Bottom” was released by Netflix.\n\nThis image released by Altitude shows, from left, Kosar Ali, Ruby Stokes and Bukky Bakray in a scene from \"Rocks.\" Much like previous Academy Awards controversies, last year's nominations by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts were denounced for their all-male directing nominees and all-white acting nominees, a backlash that spawned a #BaftasSoWhite hashtag. The British academy responded with a seven-month review. Also nominated are Lee Isaac Chung for the family drama “Minari” and Thomas Vinterberg for the Danish dark comedy “Another Round.”More films were nominated, too. ___AP's Hilary Fox contributed to this report from London___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\nThis image released by Paramount Pictures shows Andra Day in \"The United States vs Billie Holiday.\" (Takashi Seida/Paramount Pictures via AP)“The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” “Minari,” “Da 5 Bloods” and “One Night in Miami” are among the films AARP is honoring at its annual Movies for Grownups Awards, the nonprofit organization said Thursday. Director Lee Daniels’ “The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” starring Andra Day as the jazz singer, was named best picture, while the Korean American family drama “Minari” got best intergenerational film. “We focus on films made by and for grownups,” said Tim Appelo, the film and television critic for AARP. Catherine O’Hara took best actress for “Schitt’s Creek,” Mark Ruffalo got best actor for “I Know This Much is True” and “This Is Us” was named best series.\n\nHollywoods awards season has gone virtual. For Awards Daily founder Sasha Stone, who has been covering the Oscars since 2000, it’s like nothing she’s ever seen — an awards season without glamour, without red carpets, without anything that feels real. And awards season, such as it is, has gone virtual. The Oscar race will Zoomed. Not everyone is sorry that awards season — an increasingly bloated, overlong, high-priced slog from September to February — has been turned upside down.\n\nThis image released by HBO shows Diana Rigg as Olenna Tyrell in a scene from \"Game of Thrones.\" Rigg, who became a 1960s style icon as secret agent Emma Peel in TV series The Avengers, died Thursday, Sept. 10, 2020 at home with her family. (HBO via AP)LONDON – Diana Rigg, a commanding British actress whose career stretched from iconic 1960s spy series “The Avengers” to fantasy juggernaut “Game of Thrones,” has died. Rigg starred in “The Avengers” as secret agent Emma Peel alongside Patrick Macnee’s bowler-hatted John Steed. ___This story has been corrected to show that the last name of “The Avengers” actor is Macnee, not McNee.\n\nThis year, three of the four major fall film festivals, including Venice, are going forward despite the pandemic. This year, three of the four major fall film festivals all but Telluride, which had to cancel are going forward despite the pandemic. For a season predicated on badge-wearing throngs and marquee movies, its meant rethinking what a film festival is. A situation like this forces you to assess what is fundamental, says Dennis Lim, director of programming for the New York Film Festival. Anyone in Canada will be able to buy tickets to TIFF screenings, and New York Film Festival films will be briefly available nationwide.\n\n(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)LOS ANGELES, Calif. – An emotional Brad Pitt won his first acting Oscar on Sunday night, claiming the supporting actor trophy for “Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,” while referencing his own storied run in the industry where he is among the most famous and revered. Pitt beat out an iconic group that included Tom Hanks, Anthony Hopkins, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino. In earlier speeches, Pitt joked about DiCaprio and director Quentin Tarantino, and via Robbie zinged Brexit and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's departure from their royal roles in Britain. Pitt's ex-wife, Angelina Jolie, won a supporting-actress Oscar in 1999 — years before she and Pitt got together. Pitt was the only man in the category who had never won an acting Oscar."
