        "text": "Jonathan G slipped away from family to cover some shots for us. Here, Atlantic Road - The Highbury. Now residential but for many years The Highbury Hotel, a Methodist Holiday Home. An image search for the hotel suggests the garages were a prop for filming. (RL)\n\nAnother great shot from Andrew Baker who has done an impressive job of tracking down the exact location.\n\nBirkett Road, Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. In the background is Birnbeck Island which was also seen in 'Radio On'.\n\nWe shouldn't complain about sunshine but Jonathan managed a shot despite and notes that there has been a further sad decline in the terminal. (RL)\n\nSouth Parade once more but camera pointing slightly to the right. Building in the foreground was once a bank. Now Sass nightclub. Thanks Jonathan. (RL)\n\nA post-development shot taken a similar grey day in October 2014 sent in by Calvin Brady (SJ)\n\nThe Grand Pier at Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. The pier was seen in 'The Beauty Jungle', 'Sons and Lovers' and 'Deadly Strangers'.\n\nAided by the sighting of Annie Neumann's drinking fountain Ian Bell places this as Clevedon seafront, more or less opposite the bandstand on the B3130. He supports his identification with a capture from Google Earth. (RL)\n\n. . . and that it is, when he met his wife to be, she owned this very flat in Weston-super-Mare. Happy film-location link and the rest is history. This is flat 5 of a block called The Highbury overlooking Atlantic Road. Previously a guest house and before that a school. Info from Calvin. (SJ)"
