        "text": "2024 is shaping up to be an embarrassment of riches for Roman history buffs, with projects as varied as Ridley Scott’s “Gladiator 2” and Francis Ford Coppola’s Rome-inspired sci-fi epic “Megalopolis” expected to hit theaters later this year. The era will also be well-represented on television thanks to Roland Emmerich’s upcoming Peacock series “Those About to Die.”\n\nThe 10-episode series, which stars Anthony Hopkins as Roman Emperor Vespasian, is set in the world of gladiatorial combat. Adapted from Daniel P. Mannix’s nonfiction book of the same name, the show was developed by Robert Rodat and directed by Emmerich and Marco Kreuzpaintner. In addition to Hopkins, the ensemble cast includes Iwan Rheon, Sara Martins, Tom Hughes, Jojo Macari, and Moe Hashim.\n\n“I have always been fascinated by the history of the Roman Empire,” Emmerich said in a statement announcing the series. “So much still seems relevant for our society today – from the entanglement of politics and sports to the disciplines of the competitions, which haven’t changed much either over the last 2000 years. The most electrifying spectacles for the masses still involve two men in an arena, beating each other up, and the chariots of today are called race cars whose drivers still crash and often pay with their lives.”\n\nAll 10 episodes of “Those About to Die” debut on Peacock on Thursday, July 18. Watch the teaser below."
