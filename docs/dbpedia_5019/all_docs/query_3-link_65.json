        "text": "UPDATE, 8:30 AM: Peacock has dropped the official trailer for Those About To Die, starring Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins. “Life is of little value in Rome, living in the shadow of the rich and powerful, but all of this is about to change,” warns Hopkins’ Emperor Vaspasian at the opening of the trailer. “Soon I shall cross to the kingdom of darkness, but nothing is more important that protecting our beloved Rome.”\n\nThose About To Die will launch with all 10 episodes of the first season of the gladiator epic on July 18.\n\nWatch the trailer above and see series details below.\n\nPREVIOUS, April 7: Peacock has set the premiere date and released a teaser trailer for gladiator epic Those About To Die, starring Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins. All ten episodes of the series will drop Thursday, July 18 on the streamer.\n\nWritten by Robert Rodat, based on Daniel P. Mannix’s nonfiction classic of the same name, the series stars Hopkins as Emperor Vaspasian during the height of the Roman Empire. The epic drama is set in the corrupt world of the spectacle-driven gladiatorial competition, exploring a side of ancient Rome never before told — the dirty business of entertaining the masses, giving the mob what they want most…blood and sport. The series introduces an ensemble of characters from all corners of the Roman Empire who collide at the explosive intersection of sports, politics, and dynasties.\n\nThe ensemble cast also includes Iwan Rheon, Sara Martins, Tom Hughes, Jojo Macari, Moe Hashim, Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson, Rupert Penry-Jones, Gabriella Pession, Dimitri Leonidas, Emilio Sakraya, David Wurawa, Pepe Barroso, Gonçalo Almeida, Eneko Sagardoy and Romana Maggiora Vergano.\n\nThose About To Die is produced by Centropolis Entertainment, Hollywood Gang Productions and Street Entertainment. AGC Television is the studio.\n\nRoland Emmerich, Harald Kloser, Gianni Nunnari developed the show and brought it to AGC Studios. Emmerich and Marco Kreuzpaintner each direct five episodes of the 10-episode series and executive produce with Rodat, Stuart Ford, Lourdes Diaz, Miguel A. Palos Jr., Marco Kreuzpaintner, Herbert G. Kloiber, Martin Moszkowicz, Oliver Berben, Jonas Bauer, Charles Holland and Namit Malhotra.\n\nWatch the teaser trailer below:"
