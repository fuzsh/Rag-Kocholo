        "text": "IN the late 1930's, in a stately home of England called Darlington Hall, Stevens (Anthony Hopkins) is the butler. He's the supreme commander of a vast staff that includes the housekeeper, the underbutlers, the cooks, the maids, the footmen, the scullery helpers, even those people who work outside the great house. As the members of his staff are expected to serve him, so Stevens serves his master, Lord Darlington (James Fox). He serves without question. Or, as he says at one point, \"It's not my place to have an opinion.\"\n\nStevens is not just any butler. Through a combination of hard work, long hours, denial of his own needs and carefully blinkered intelligence, Stevens has become what his peers would acknowledge to be a great butler. In his world he's the equivalent to Lord Darlington, someone who, when the chips are down, is to be trusted. Stevens is a man of honor and dignity, which become for him, as for the intensely dim-witted Lord Darlington, fatal flaws.\n\nTaking this rather arcane story, adapted from Kazuo Ishiguro's award-winning novel, Ismail Merchant, the producer; James Ivory, the director, and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, the writer, have made \"The Remains of the Day,\" a spellbinding new tragi-comedy of high and most entertaining order. Here is an exquisite work that could become a quite unlikely smash.\n\nNothing that Mr. Merchant, Mr. Ivory and Ms. Jhabvala have done before -- not even \"The Bostonians,\" \"A Room With a View\" or \"Howards End\" -- has the psychological and political scope and the spare authority of this enchantingly realized film.\n\n\"The Remains of the Day,\" like the novel, is nothing if not metaphoric. Stevens is the proudly subservient, pre-World War II English working class. Darlington Hall is England. Stevens's fierce determination to serve, and the satisfaction it gives him, are the last, worn-out gasps of a feudal system that was supposed to have vanished centuries before.\n\nThe film also has its roots in history. The people who gather around Lord Darlington recall the members of the so-called \"Cliveden set.\" These were the high-minded, sometimes fascist-leaning, thoroughly wrongheaded English Tories who, in the years before Munich and the partition of Czechoslovakia in 1938, worked so hard to accommodate Hitler and to preserve England's rigid social hierarchies.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
