        "text": "Actor Born Philip Anthony Hopkins on Dec. 31, 1937 in Margam, Port Talbot, United Kingdom\n\nIn his Oscar-winning role as the brilliant cannibal, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, in 1991âs âThe Silence of the Lambs,â Hopkins scared the daylights out of audiences and gave new meaning to âfava beans\" and âChianti.â\n\nA poor student, young Hopkins found his calling at 15 when he met countryman Richard Burton. He attended the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in Cardiff and eventually found his way to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. It was the legendary Laurence Olivier, operating the Royal National Theatre, who invited him to join the troupe in 1965 as his understudy in âThe Dance of Death.â Hopkins, who was 30 years Olivierâs junior, stood in for the part when the veteran actor came down with appendicitis.\n\nHopkins made his film debut in 1968 as King Richard in the classic âThe Lion in Winter,â with Peter OâToole and Katharine Hepburn playing his parents.\n\nOver the next four decades, he worked in theater, TV and features. He won an Emmy for his role as convicted kidnapper and murderer Bruno Hauptmann in 1976âs âThe Lindbergh Kidnapping Caseâ and another Emmy as Adolf Hitler in the 1981 TV movie âThe Bunker.â\n\nHe reprised his role as Lecter two more times for 2001âs âHannibalâ and 2002âs âRed Dragon.â\n\nHopkins has also earned Oscar nominations for 1993âs âThe Remains of the Day,â 1995âs âNixonâ and 1997âs âAmistad.â In fact, he is the only actor to receive two nominations for playing presidents. He played Richard Nixon in âNixonâ and John Quincy Adams in âAmistad.â\n\nHeâs also ventured into directing, having starred in and directed the 1996 âAugustâ and 2007 âSlipstream.â He composed the score to both films.\n\nAlthough he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth and retains his British citizenship, Hopkins became an American citizen on April 12, 2000."
