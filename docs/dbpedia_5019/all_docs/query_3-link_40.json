Blessed with an acclaimed director (Fernando Meirelles, City of God & The Constant Gardener), a respected screenwriter (Peter Morgan, Frost/Nixon), and a high profile internatio...\n\nAlexander\n\nTo sum up Alexander in three words, I would choose the following: three-hour miscalculation. Although some aspects of Oliver Stone's sword-and-sandals epic are worthy of mention (and even praise), they are dwarfed by the missteps and examples of b...\n\nAll the King's Men\n\nWith remakes the likes of Poseidon, The Pink Panther, and The Wicker Man already dotting 2006's cinematic landscape, why not provide a new take on the 1949 political thriller, All the King's Men? In actuality, writer/director Steven Zaillian claims...\n\nAll the King's Men\n\nWith remakes the likes of Poseidon, The Pink Panther, and The Wicker Man already dotting 2006's cinematic landscape, why not provide a new take on the 1949 political thriller, All the King's Men? In actuality, writer/director Steven Zaillian claims...\n\nAmistad\n\nHere's a word analogy: Amistad is to The Lost World as Schindler's List is to Jurassic Park. In 1993, after Steven Spielberg made the monster dino hit, many critics described Schindler's List as the director's \"penance\" (as if there was a need for...\n\nArmageddon Time\n\nEveryone has their own coming-of-age story. For most, it has meaning for only one person; it’s rare that a coming-of-age experience translates into a universal story. Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast is an example of one that does. James Gray’s Arm...\n\nBeowulf\n\nThe legend of Beowulf, a mythical hero whose exploits were recounted in an 8th century epic poem, has gained unprecedented popularity some 1250 years after it was first told. With the success of The Lord of the Rings, which (along with the Harry P...\n\nBobby\n\nIn the movie business, there's no such thing as \"truth in titling.\" If there was, Bobby would be called A Bunch of Boring, No-Name, Cookie-Cutter Characters. Although that lacks the brevity and appeal of the real title, it's more illustrative of ...\n\nChaplin\n\nChaplin is Sir Richard Attenborough's account of the life and times of film great Charlie Chaplin. The story picks up in 1894, when Charlie is five, and lasts until 1972, five years before his death in 1977. Along the way, Attenborough gives us g...\n\nEdge, The\n\nAs \"survival in the wilderness\" films go, The Edge is a strange example. Leaving the theater, I didn't quite know what to make of it. In fact, I'll even admit to enjoying it on a certain level. I laughed frequently, but the problem is that I'm n..."
