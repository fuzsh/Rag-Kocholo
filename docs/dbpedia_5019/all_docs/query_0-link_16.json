Oscar®-winners Anthony Hopkins (The Silence of the Lambs) and Emma Thompson (Howards End) reunite with the acclaimed Merchant Ivory filmmaking team for this extraordinary and moving story of blind devotion and repressed love. Hopkins stars as Stevens, the perfect English butler - an ideal carried by him to fanatical lengths - as he serves his master, Lord Darlington, beautifully played by James Fox (The Servant). Darlington, like many other members of the British establishment in the 1930s, is duped by the Nazis into trying to establish a rapport between themselves and the British government. Thompson stars as the estate's housekeeper, a high-spirited, strong-minded young woman who watches the goings-on upstairs with horror. Despite her apprehensions, she and Stevens gradually fall in love, though neither will admit it, and only give vent to their charged feelings via fierce arguments. Marvelously acted by a supporting cast that includes Christopher Reeve and Hugh Grant.",

        "text": "Anthony Hopkins is magnificent as Stevens, with his blinkered code of honour, and Emma Thompson his match as the housekeeper.\n\nSeptember 8, 2023\n\nSublime filmmaking and performances turn Stevens’ every minute choice into a pillar of profound tragedy, giving us a maddeningly heartwrenching life lesson for the ages.\n\nAugust 25, 2023\n\nThe Remains of the Day is the perfect storm of writing, directing and acting.\n\nMarch 3, 2023\n\nYou can’t talk about great acting without thinking of The Remains of the Day...\n\nFebruary 7, 2023\n\nLike The Age of Innocence, here's another handsome period piece about a man who foolishly ignores the dictates of his heart.\n\nDecember 28, 2019\n\nBeautiful to look at and deeply moving in many scenes.\n\nNovember 5, 2019\n\nThe movie looks splendid. Arcadian views and honeyed filters have been largely resisted. But the content, that is to say, the script, has problems.\n\nAugust 14, 2018"
