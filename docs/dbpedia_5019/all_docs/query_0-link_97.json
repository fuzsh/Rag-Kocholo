        "text": "A deeply moving tale of sacrifices made for the sake of duty and the human cost of such devotion to tradition and protocol. This arresting drama features BAFTA winning performances from Anthony Hopkins as the reserved and dedicated butler Stevens and Emma Thompson as Miss Kenton, the head housekeeper. Once again working with director James Ivory, from a novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, the dynamic pair electrify a narrative set in the years leading up to and after World War II. Engaging with concepts of love, duty, repression, and regret, Stevens, the quintessential English butler, is unwaveringly devoted to his duties and the aristocratic household he serves. His loyalty to Lord Darlington (the brilliant James Fox), a misguided and morally complex aristocrat, forces him to suppress his own feelings and convictions. A poignant and emotionally charged exploration of the limitations of emotional expression in the face of rigid social hierarchies and societal expectations. The film earned critical acclaim for its performances and its thought-provoking portrayal of post-war British society."
