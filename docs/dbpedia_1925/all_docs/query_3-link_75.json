        "text": "The intent of this page is to help give possible explanations when one's DNA does not match any of the 'established' McManus lineages. This page may be helpful to those whose surname is different from McManus find their DNA results matching a McManus (Maguire, O'Connor, etc.)\n\nAs indicated on the prior page, there are three major sources of concern where there are pitfalls in using DNA as a research tool for genealogy. One must assume the science of the tool is sound as far as we know. But one should explore where the Genealogical and Social aspects affect the analysis process. While these two areas are different from their source, their effects do coincide and work together to give reasons for and explanations to 'interruptions'. More recent convention uses the term 'Non-Parental Event' or NPE. This term has a somewhat ambiguous connotation, but means the same thing.\n\nThe dictionary describes or defines an interruption as an act or event that breaks the continuity or conformity of something else. In a genealogical sense, it describes an act or event which breaks the continuity of a lineage. Where we use the term 'interruption' here, it is intended to mean a break in the direct lineage between a person and the commonly accepted progenitor of the family. In some cases this progenitor might not be known or documented, but the DNA analysis performed uncovers the fact that the inherited DNA of a person does not indicate a close kinship with person whose DNA derives from an 'established' lineage.\n\nWhile not entirely wieldy, the word 'interruption' suffices for this discussion. Below are types of 'interruptions' and some known instances where an interruption actually or may have taken place. In each instance, the item is marked '[known]' - which means it is documented and the DNA has or should prove it out, and '[possible]' where it is likely to be an interruption but the documentation has still to be consulted and DNA analysis of that lineage needs to be obtained and analyzed. In the case of currently living people, they are not included in this list out of respect for privacy unless they have given their consent.\n\nNote: Where slaves are listed for McManus - the intent is to show that these slaves might have adopted the surname of McManus upon emancipation.\n\nInterruptions of a McManus lineage\n\nBartholomew McMANUS, born 1777 in Dublin, Ireland.
