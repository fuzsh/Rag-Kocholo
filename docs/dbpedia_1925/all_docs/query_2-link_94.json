Call\n\n8:45-9:45 a.m. – Preparing for Victory: Crafting the Plan, with Craig L. Symonds, Ph.D.\n\nPlanning for the 1944 Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France took months. The plan included a massive deception campaign to confuse the German defenders. The logistics were overwhelming. The Allies needed to bring 150,000 men across the English Channel to attack the German-held beaches. If any part of this plan was leaked, the whole invasion could have failed. How did the Allies pull off such a complicated attack?\n\nCraig L. Symonds, Ph.D. is professor emeritus at the U. S. Naval Academy, where he served as chairman of the history department, and he is a U.S. Navy veteran. He is the author of several military history books, including “Lincoln and his Admirals,” and “Neptune: The Allied Invasion of Europe and the D-Day Landings.”\n\n10-11 a.m. – Victory Begins: The D-Day Invasion, with John C.

McManus, Ph.D. is the author of “The Americans at Normandy: The Summer of 1944,” and “The Dead and Those About to Die: D-Day: The Big Red One at Omaha Beach.” He is Curators’ Distinguished Professor of U.S. military history at the Missouri University of Science and Technology.\n\n11-11:45 a.m. – Exhibiting Power: D-Day Artifacts from the Museum, with Paul Morando\n\nThe National Museum of the United States Army has numerous artifacts from D-Day in the Global War Gallery.

Rabe, Ph.D.\n\nThe D-Day invasion had an enormous effect on the lives of those ordinary people who lived in Normandy at the time. They did extraordinary things in defense of liberty and freedom by providing food, gathering intelligence, and giving medical aid to the U.S. Army paratroopers who landed in their villages. Historian Stephen G. Rabe, son of one of these paratroopers, meticulously documents the forgotten lives of those who participated in this integral part of D-Day history.\n\nDr. Stephen G.

Yockelson, Ph.D.\n\nOne of the most significant aspects of the June 6, 1944 invasion was the U.S. Army’s daring airborne operations behind the German army’s coastal defenses. Military historian Mitchell Yockelson details the heroic actions of the 13,000 paratroopers and 4,000 glider infantrymen on D-Day and beyond. How did they manage this daring feat? What happened once they leapt from the safety of their planes? How did they fare once they made it to the ground?\n\nMitchell A. Yockelson, Ph.D., a former professor at the U.S. Naval Academy, is now an investigative archivist with the National Archives and Records Administration. He is the author of “The Paratrooper Generals: Matthew Ridgway, Maxwell Taylor, and the American Airborne from D-Day through Normandy.”\n\n3:15-3:30 p.m. – Conclusion\n\n3:30-5 p.m. – D-Day Exhibit Sneak Peek\n\nBe the first to explore the Museum’s latest special exhibit, “D-Day: Freedom from Above.” Experience the great invasion through the eyes of U.S. Army paratroopers.
