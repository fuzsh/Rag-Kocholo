        "text": "Generally regarded as the most distinguished regiment in the U.S. Army, the\n\n7th Infantry Regiment has fought in almost every engagement since the battle of\n\nNew Orleans in the War of 1812. Its lineage is detailed in a new book by\n\nMissouri University of Science and Technology historian Dr. John C.\n\nMcManus.\n\nThe book, titled “The 7th Infantry Regiment: Combat in an Age of Terror: The\n\nKorean War Through the Present,” is the first in a two-volume set. The second\n\nvolume, which covers the War of 1812 through World War II, is due out in\n\n2009.\n\n“Whenever military history is made, you can expect the 7th Infantry Regiment\n\nwill be there,” McManus says.\n\nThe project began as an investigation to see if any units in the U.S. Army\n\ncould trace their lineage all the way back to the Revolutionary War. In his\n\nresearch, McManus kept finding references to the 7th Infantry Regiment.\n\n“Time and time again, they were always in the thick of it,” McManus says. “I\n\nwas aware of the 7th Infantry, but I didn’t know what the story truly was. The\n\nmore I learned, the more I realized it was a story that needed to be told.”\n\nMcManus believes that a look at the history of the 7th Infantry can tell you\n\na great deal about American history in general because it reflects the culture\n\nof the day. He says it can tell us different things at different times.\n\nIn the 19th century, only white males were allowed to fight in our army but\n\nthat changes by the mid-20th century with desegregation, McManus says. At other\n\ntimes, foreign-born white men were fighting for us.\n\n“On the eve of the Civil War, more than half of the 7th Infantry are foreign\n\nborn. They came from Germany, Scotland, Ireland, Sweden. They were outsiders to\n\nAmerican life at that point in time.”\n\nMcManus says you can also see differences in the average 7th Infantry\n\nsoldier based on socioeconomic factors.\n\n“In the 19th century, the 7th Infantry was made up mainly of the poor and\n\nthe disaffected, but by the 20th century that was no longer the case,” he says.\n\n“Now it is more the everyday middle American who fights with the 7th\n\nInfantry.”\n\nWhile race and socioeconomic class have changed throughout the span of the\n\n7th Infantry, the one thing that has remained constant is gender integration,\n\nMcManus says.\n\n“The infantry remains a male-dominated environment and that hasn’t changed\n\nthroughout the infantry’s 200 years.”\n\nAlthough not in the military himself, McManus has always been fascinated by\n\nit.\n\n“I have always been interested in what warfare was really like for the\n\nperson who fights,” McManus says. “It seems like so many books I read as a kid\n\nwere very antiseptic. I didn’t like that. I knew there was a real story in\n\nthere of an average person doing the real fighting and that is what fascinates\n\nme.\n\nMcManus thinks of himself as more of an American social historian, because\n\nhe looking at Americans in the combat environment. “To me, that is the ultimate\n\nenvironment. It tells us a lot about them."
