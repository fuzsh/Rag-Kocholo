        "text": "Share music with others by starting your pathway to teaching while expanding your own skills.\n\nThe knowledge and skills Pacific University Music Education students gain are embedded within the context of a liberal arts education, preparing them to be well-rounded music teachers with a global vision. Choose a music education degree option that best fits you and your career goals.\n\nMusic Education Degree Pathways\n\nPacific University offers two different pathways for music education licensure.\n\nThe Bachelor of Music Education + teaching license (BME) program is a professional program that leads to Oregon teaching licensure within four years.\n\nThe Bachelor of Arts in Music Education, prepares students for teaching licensure through a graduate degree program, if desired.\n\nAll states require teachers to have a valid teaching license if they are to teach music in Pre-K-12 music education settings.\n\nA Career as a Music Educator\n\nBoth music education programs are designed to prepare students for a career in music education. In the United States, the demand for qualified music teachers is unfulfilled.\n\nOur graduates are music teachers in private and public schools, choir and church music directors, Fulbright Scholars, graduate students and professional musicians."
