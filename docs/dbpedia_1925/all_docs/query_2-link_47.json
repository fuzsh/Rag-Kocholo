A celebration of his life was held Nov. 20 in Eugene.\n\nMcManus was born Sept. 24, 1921, in La Grande where he spent his childhood.

He also received a master of arts degree from Columbia University in New York.\n\nHe served two years in the U.S. Army Air Force as a B-24 bomber pilot and was based in Italy during World War II.\n\nHe later wrote a book reflecting on his experiences during the war.

He always remembered with appreciation his band and orchestra experiences in La Grande as a student of Andy Loney's in the 1930s.\n\nIn 1996 he and his wife established a unitrust to benefit the La Grande School Music Department. Named Oregon Teacher of the Year in 1965, he was one of five finalists for National Teacher of the Year.\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Beth; sister, Patricia McManus Brand; brother, Richard McManus; son, Ed and his wife, Kim McManus; daughters, Ann and her husband, Dean Larson, and Kathy McManus; and four grandchildren.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to the U of O School of Music Scholarship Fund or any charity.\n\n."
