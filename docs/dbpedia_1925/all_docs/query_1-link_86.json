        "text": "A Time for Trumpets: The Untold Story of the Battle of the Bulge\n\nBy Charles B. MacDonald,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nHow many historians can claim to have fought in the Battle of the Bulge as a rifle company commander, documented it as a combat historian, and then written about it as a popular author? Only the great Charles B. MacDonald. In this remarkable work, published on the fortieth anniversary of the battle, he managed to convey both the human and strategic dimensions without missing a rhetorical beat. I love this book because it is so obviously the product of decades of reflection and research by a true master of the historical art.\n\nBy Charles B. MacDonald,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked A Time for Trumpets as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nOn December 16, 1944, the vanguard of three German armies, totaling half a million men, attacked U.S. forces in the Ardennes region of Belgium and Luxembourg, achieveing what had been considered impossible -- total surprise. In the most abysmal failure of battlefield intelligence in the history of the U.S. Army, 600,000 American soldiers found themselves facing Hitler's last desperate effort of the war.\n\nThe brutal confrontation that ensued became known as the Battle of the Bulge, the greatest battle ever fought by the U.S. Army -- a triumph of American ingenuity and dedication over an egregious failure in strategic intelligence.…\n\nPreview\n\nArdennes 1944: The Battle of the Bulge\n\nBy Antony Beevor,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nWhat happens when an author with a remarkable knack for insightful research and a gift for brilliant narrative prose takes on the task of telling a story of such epochal importance? A wonderful book that conveys the desperation of the moment and weaves this together with latter-year perspective. Among Beevor’s many insights, my favorite is his assertion that “the German leadership’s greatest mistake in the Ardennes offensive was to have misjudged the soldiers of an army they had affected to despise.” So very true! The Germans badly underestimated the U.S. Army and they paid the price for their dismissive chauvinism.\n\nBy Antony Beevor,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Ardennes 1944 as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe prizewinning historian and bestselling author of D-Day, Stalingrad, and The Battle of Arnhem reconstructs the Battle of the Bulge in this riveting new account\n\nOn December 16, 1944, Hitler launched his 'last gamble' in the snow-covered forests and gorges of the Ardennes in Belgium, believing he could split the Allies by driving all the way to Antwerp and forcing the Canadians and the British out of the war. Although his generals were doubtful of success, younger officers and NCOs were desperate to believe that their homes and families could be saved from the vengeful Red Army approaching from the…\n\nPreview\n\nSnow and Steel: The Battle of the Bulge, 1944-45\n\nBy Peter Caddick-Adams,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nHow many times have you read a 700-page book that feels more like 200 pages and actually leaves you wanting more? Caddick-Adams’s scope is magisterial and yet the abject beauty of his marvelous writing moves the narrative along with a crispness that is hard to appreciate until you find yourself deep into the book and feeling almost like you just started it. His chapters crackle with the depth and intensity of a polished staff ride, and that’s appropriate because this authoritative tome is the product of decades of on-site investigation, deep-dive archival research, and the illumination that came from more than a few of the author’s longtime personal friendships with key participants. I know of no World War II historian who writes more artfully and colorfully but without ever sacrificing good scholarship.\n\nBy Peter Caddick-Adams,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Snow and Steel as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nSnow and Steel is a huge reassessment of Hitler's last great throw of the dice: 'The Battle of the Bulge', the battle for the Ardennes 16 December 1944 to 25 January 1945. This was an utterly fascinating five weeks when for a time it looked like Hitler had outflanked the allied armies pushing toward the Rhine and might just throw them back to the Normandy beaches. It is also the context for the catastrophic events at Bastogne depicted so graphically in Band of Brothers.\n\nFor military history fans this is one of those touchstone battles of the second world war,…\n\nPreview\n\nBattle: The Story of the Bulge\n\nBy John Toland,\n\nWhy did I love this book?\n\nToland was a veritable genius at long-form historical storytelling. His books read like sweeping, epic novels. When he researched this book in the 1950s, he did not have the benefit of access to massive amounts of unclassified Army records that World War II historians of our time take for granted. But he did enjoy the advantage of proximity to the event and he used that asset to the hilt. He practiced immersion-style research, embedding himself on the ground for long stretches of time, forging relationships with civilians and combatants of both sides, from all ranks and dispositions. Then he had the consideration and presence of mind to save all this precious material—boxes and boxes of documents, photos, reports, interview transcripts, and the like--and donate it to the Library of Congress. I have researched these fascinating sources first hand so I can personally attest to their incredible value. Reading this book is like transporting yourself back in time to look over the shoulders of the participants as they fought the battle and, far too often, we're forced to make life and death decisions.\n\nBy John Toland,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Battle as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe perspective of 15 years, painstaking research, thousands of interviews, extensive analysis and evaluation, and the creative talent of John Toland [paint] the epic struggle on an immense canvas\n\nPreview"
