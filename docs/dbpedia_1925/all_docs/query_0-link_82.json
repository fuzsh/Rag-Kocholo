        "text": "These include death notices reported by December 1, 2022.\n\n’42\n\nJack Benson Corey on September 8, 2022. Born on June 8, 1920, in Meadville, Pennsylvania, Corey pursued his bachelor’s degree at Allegheny. According to his obituary, “In his junior year, the quakes of World War II led the U.S. government to implement what was known as the ‘Civilian Pilot Training Corp,’ giving Jack an opportunity to earn his pilot’s license in exchange for his commitment to serve. This commitment to liberty and country was one that came naturally for Jack, volunteering his service earlier than agreed in a peacetime draft in July 1941.\n\n“Sent out with the title of ‘fighter pilot’ first in his F6F Hellcat off the carriers in the Pacific Theater,” the obituary continued, “Sr. Grade Lieutenant Corey was actively engaged in the Bougainville Campaign, the Battle of Saipan, and the Battle of Tinian. Shot down by enemy fire and rescued out at sea by a U.S. ship, Jack survived and continued to fly and serve as a test-pilot until the end of World War II. Jack returned to Allegheny College as a hero, earning his Bachelor of Arts in 1942.”\n\nOn their way to explore California, Corey and his first wife, Kay, accepted an invitation to visit Texas. Corey’s first job in Houston was with Finch Oil Pipe Company. Eventually, he established his own successful business of Corey Supply Company in 1956. In 1984, he officially retired and moved from the city of Houston to his forever home, the 4C Ranch.\n\nIn addition to being a member of the Allegheny College Board of Trustees, he was also a member of the Allegheny College Class Agent Program and served on a Reunion Committee and as a volunteer.\n\nCorey was preceded in death by his parents (Claude and Edna), sister (Virginia), and first wife (Kay Corey). He is survived by his beloved wife, Foresteen Corey, six children and their spouses (Scott Corey, Kim ’86 and Will Schlinke, Doy and Tom Landry, Cher and Rodney Stevens, Brent and Jayme Cherry, and Kent Cherry); and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\n’47\n\nJean Emily Root Bankson on June 30, 2022. Jean Emily Bankson, age 98, of Camano Island, Washington passed away on June 30, 2022. Jean was born June 10, 1924 in Erie, Pennsylvania. Jean was active in Girl Scouts and attended Allegheny College. She was married to Rudy Bankson for 70 years. She was the Welcome Wagon Hostess for Kirkland and worked at Hancock Fabrics. She is preceded in death by husband Rudy and son Don; survived by sons Jim and Dave and daughter Gloria, their spouses Debra, Carol, Sally and Rick. There are seven grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren. She will be deeply missed.\n\nMartha Dundon Thompson Furey on October 20, 2021. Born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, in 1926, Furey graduated from Glen Ridge High School and Allegheny College. She taught kindergarten in New Jersey and Philadelphia prior to her marriage. She was active in many civic causes, including serving as president of The Women’s Branch of New Jersey Historical Society, Junior League of Newark, Kappa Kappa Gamma Alumni in New Jersey and Cape Cod. She also served on the Board of Trustees at her alma mater, Allegheny College, and on the Board of Trustees for Blair Academy, Blairstown, New Jersey. Furey was president of Park Liberty and Dale Realty Corp in Bloomfield, New Jersey. Furey and husband Clem retired to Osterville, Massachusetts, and in 2010, they moved to Kansas City to be closer to family.\n\nIn addition to being a member of the Allegheny College Board of Trustees, she was also a member of the Allegheny College Class Agent Program and served on a Reunion Committee and the Allegheny College Alumni Congress.\n\nShe was predeceased by husbands David Clark Thompson and Clement A. Furey and son Lewis Dundon Thompson. She is survived by children David C. Thompson (Lynne), Elizabeth T. Hamby (Roger), James T. Thompson ’81 (Kristal), and John H. Thompson (Ann); stepchildren Michael Furey (Nancy), William Furey (Debi), Patty Jones (Rick), Jeffrey Furey (Carolyn), and James Furey (Vickie); and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\n’48\n\nJulian “Jerry” “Specs Howard” Liebman on September 3, 2022. Broadcast industry legend Julian “Jerry” Liebman, aka Specs Howard, was an innovative entrepreneur, a generous mentor and, above all, the beloved patriarch of a large and loving family. Jerry, who was 96, died Sept. 3, 2022, in his Southfield home, with his cherished wife of 68 years, Ceil, at his side.\n\nJerry Liebman was born in 1926 in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, a small town outside Pittsburgh. After contracting polio in a local pool at age 8, doctors told his parents he would never walk again. Refusing to accept the dire prediction, his father bought him a bicycle to restore his leg strength. Not only did Jerry regain his ability to walk, he also acquired the resiliency, optimism and determination that fueled his remarkable life.\n\nHe attended Allegheny College, where he worked at the student radio station and discovered his calling. As a DJ in Sharon, Pennsylvania, Jerry met his lifelong partner and best friend, Celia. They shared a 68-year marriage filled with mutual love, devotion and respect, raising four children in a home based on Jewish values and traditions.\n\n“They were my inspiration for a loving relationship, the way he looked at her…,” said Kim Schon, the couple’s oldest grandchild.\n\nJerry Liebman became “Specs Howard” while working as a DJ at a Cleveland rock-and-roll station. When management decided he needed a trendier name, his trademark glasses made “Specs” a natural choice. Howard was chosen after a random perusal of the local phone book, and the name remained a permanent part of his professional persona.\n\nIn the midst of a successful run as a popular disc jockey in Cleveland, Jerry accepted an offer from WXYZ in Detroit and the family moved to Southfield. When the job ended due to changes in the radio business, Jerry decided to take a chance on a new venture rather than uproot the family again.\n\nIn 1970, he opened the school that later became the Specs Howard School of Media Arts. While his official mission was to teach the skills required for a career in broadcast arts, Jerry’s true passion was helping people achieve their potential, to reach goals they never imagined they could. His door was always open to students and employees who frequently sought the wise counsel he so generously dispensed.\n\nHe designed a curriculum based on his firsthand knowledge of the skills radio stations needed new employees to have. Using his contacts in the business, he developed the first program to place students in jobs after graduation. Many successful radio and TV personalities in Metro Detroit and across the country learned their trade at Specs Howard. Five decades and 16,000 students later, the school became part of Lawrence Technological University under the name Specs@LTU.\n\n“Jerry was a rock star…. He touched and inspired so many people,” said Rabbi Herschel Finman, a longtime friend who officiated the funeral service.\n\nOf all his remarkable achievements, Jerry was proudest of his family. His desk was covered with family photos and coming home for dinner was a priority despite his demanding career. He enjoyed special relationships with each of his children as well as his 13 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.\n\n“Growing up, he knew all of my friends and, later, he got to know my children’s friends,” said his daughter, Shelli Liebman Dorfman. “And he adored his grandchildren — they could get away with anything.”\n\nHe was an avid reader of newspapers and a variety of nonfiction books, accumulating an impressive store of knowledge on history, politics and numerous other subjects. The New York Times crossword puzzle was part of his daily routine until his final days.\n\nReligion was very important to Jerry and Celia, whose father was a rabbi, and Judaism was an essential part of their household. While walking to services with his son, Jon, he befriended the late Rabbi Shaiall Zachariash, which led Jerry to become a founding member of Congregation Shomrey Emunah, where he remained an active participant.\n\n“My dad always instilled how important it is to smile, stay positive and enjoy life,” said Alisa Zee, his daughter.\n\nJerry Liebman is survived by his wife, Ceil Liebman; children, Shelli (Dr. Michael) Dorfman, Martin (Judy) Liebman, Jonathan (Mindy) Liebman, Alisa Z. Liebman; grandchildren, Kimberly Schon, Richard (Dr. Penina) Dorfman, Stephanie (Avi) Beneson, Noah Liebman, Rabbi Miriam Liebman (Akiva Fishman), Tara Zdrojewski, Rana (Ty) Austin, Zoe Zdrojewski, Emma Claire Zdrojewski, Josh (Franny) Liebman, Rebecca (Phil) Janis, Emily Liebman and Adam Liebman; great-grandchildren, Shira Schon, Ari Schon, Jake Schon, Eitan Schon, Zevi Beneson, Rachel Beneson, Akiva Beneson, Elisheva Beneson, Noam Dorfman, Nathan Dorfman, Amalia Rose Fishman, Riley Janis, Avery Janis, Jacob Liebman. He is also fondly remembered by Bryan Schon, Dr. Sammi Siegel, Lester Sloan, Randy Zdrojewski and many other loving relatives and friends. He was the loving grandfather of the late Alexandra Zdrojewski..\n\nRobert E. Snyder on October 17, 2021. Robert E. Snyder, class of ’48 at Allegheny College, died on October 17th, 2021 just 11 days shy of his 98th birthday. Robert was a decorated officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. He served in World War II and in the Korean War. He was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. He married Hallie T. Schmidt ’51 at Allegheny College in a ceremony in February, 1951 in the Allegheny College chapel. She pre-deceased him on January 18th, 2005.\n\nLavina Smith Wood on September 21, 2022. Lavina S. Wood, 96, of Murrysville, passed away Wednesday, September 21, 2022, at her home surrounded by her loving family. She was born January 31, 1926, in Belle Vernon, PA, daughter of the late James and Thelma Smith. In addition to her parents, she is preceded in death by her husband, Robert K. Wood ’50. Lavina is survived by two children, James K. Wood (Darlene), and Susan Wood-Megrey; and four grandchildren; Lauren Wood, Christopher Wood-Megrey, Amber Wood, and Nicholas Wood-Megrey; and two great grandchildren.\n\n’49\n\nMartha Jane Zimmer Laderer on July 9, 2022. Martha Jane Zimmer Laderer, 94, of Conneaut Lake, passed peacefully away Saturday, July 9, 2022 at home with her family by her side. She was born October 23, 1927 in Emporium, PA, a daughter of Carl Robert and Martha Olive Ellis Zimmer.\n\nAfter she graduated from Emporium High School in 1945 and summa cum laude from Allegheny College in 1948, Martha married Edward Humphrey Laderer of Meadville on September 11, 1948.\n\nShe is survived by her husband, Edward; and five caring children, Harry (Marian) of Huntersville, NC, Ed (Amy) of Lakeland, FL, Laura ’82 (Terry ’81) Hartford of Pittsburgh, Marcy (Dave) Thomas of Blairsville, GA, and John (Jinny) of Babson Park, FL; 13 grandchildren (Ryan, Johnny, Ned, Leslie, T ’11, Mike, Colin ’13, Gabby, EJ, Jacob, Ally, Kayli and Mary) and 7 great-grandchildren (Annalies, Micah, Ellis, Benson, Lawrence, Johnny and Emery). Two brothers, C. Robert Zimmer and Dr. Frederick E. Zimmer ’42, and her sister, Mary Zimmer Brandt, preceded her in death.\n\nWhen not busy raising five children, attending hundreds of swim meets, and working as the program director at the YWCA, she researched the family genealogy. She traveled the United States and Europe and eventually published two books detailing the Laderer and Zimmer family roots.\n\nHowever, to the very end, her most precious time was spent with family members whom she loved “more than the sun, the moon, and the stars.” We could not have asked for a better wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother or role model. She will be greatly missed by her family.\n\nDr. Archie M. Richardson Jr. on November 15, 2022. Archie M. Richardson Jr., formerly of Tarentum, known as “Pa” by his loving family, passed away after his 94th birthday, Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2022. He was born Oct. 17, 1928, in Tarentum, to Archie M. Richardson, a local doctor and his wife, Rosalie Walter. Archie married Helen M. Harrison on June 8, 1950, a girl he had already known for several years. They knew each other for 80 years; 72 of those years they were married, raised a family of five children and traveled the world. He was a civil engineer in the Pittsburgh area and went to Afghanistan, India and Thailand with his family to teach engineering. He and his family returned to Pittsburgh, where they lived until 2022. His grandfather, George Richardson, was a Methodist preacher in the Pittsburgh area, and Archie and Helen attended the Methodist Church. Archie loved to travel, to meet people and learn about their ways. He loved his family and looked forward to family gatherings. One of the family’s favorite places was Chautauqua, N.Y., where family reunions were held over the July Fourth holiday, and Archie and Helen enjoyed their summers at the lake there for many years. Archie graduated from Tarentum High School in 1945, received his BS degree from Allegheny College, a master’s from the University of Pittsburgh, and his Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Survivors include his wife, Helen; and his children, Rosalie Sachs and her husband, Charles, Archie Richardson III and his wife, Deborah, David Richardson, Rebecca Lane and her husband, Jim, and Sam Richardson and his wife, Jacquie.

It is with profound sadness that the family of Hope H. Seibert announce her peaceful passing on Sunday, September 4, 2022 at the age of 94.\n\nShe will be lovingly remembered by her children: Barbara Trojanowski and Debra Vreeland (Judd) of Oxford, Md.; granddaughter Heather Anderson and great granddaughter Hadley Merriam of Bridgton, ME.\n\nShe was predeceased by her husband of 35 years, Robert W. Seibert ’48.\n\nHope grew up in Westfield, NJ. She attended Westfield High where she cultivated many lifetime friends. After high school graduation, she attended Allegheny College in PA and was a member of the Alpha Gamma Delta Sorority. She graduated with a BS degree, double majoring in Science and math with the goal of becoming a teacher. She spent many of her summers in Cape Cod, MA as an aide to an elderly woman and where she also found her love of the ocean. In 1949 she married her husband and after much moving around the country and raising her children, settled in Oxford, Maryland in the mid 70’s. She worked at Channel Marker, Inc. for many years as their secretary.\n\nHope loved spending time on the water, beach-combing, painting, reading and gardening. She was quick-witted, adventurous, and had an infectious spirit. She always laughed about her love affair with chocolate calling herself a “chocaholic”. We thank her for her love and all of the learned lessons over our lifetime.\n\nEdward Troy Wellejus on September 6, 2022. Whether it was chance or fate, Erie journalist Edward Troy Wellejus stumbled into the exciting work he would stay with for fifty years and which he quickly learned to love.\n\nWellejus, of South Shore Drive, Erie, died on September 6, 2022.\n\nA senior at Academy High School during World War II, when workers were in short supply, and as editor of the school paper, Wellejus was recruited by Erie Daily Times Sports editor Howard (Peg) Parsons to work nights in the Times Sports Department.\n\nThis double duty, student and sports writer, gave him some recognition, but it also had its costs. Wellejus was once denounced at an Academy football rally as “the traitor in our midst”, for writing a story about three Academy players who were injured and couldn’t play in the upcoming game between Academy and East High.\n\nBorn in Northumberland, PA on January 3, 1926, Wellejus was the son of the late Hans and Beatrice Lauer Wellejus Winn (late in life after the death of her husband, Mrs. Wellejus married William Winn, a longtime GE employee and the first Vice-President of GE Local 506).\n\nWellejus was a graduate of Academy in January of 1944. He received his army draft notice within weeks and by March was doing basic training at Fort McClelland, AL.\n\nIn August, he was in England awaiting the move to France. In December, at the Battle of the Bulge, much of the 87th Infantry regiment that he was in, was overwhelmed by the Germans in the last significant offensive of the war. For nearly two weeks, he and other prisoners were marched back into Germany. On his nineteenth birthday, on January 3, 1945, he was in an air raid shelter underneath Manheim, Germany, while allied bombers attacked the city. Wellejus was a prisoner until late April, when he was freed by the victorious allies.\n\nAfter the war, he returned to the Times as a reporter. When he was admitted to Allegheny College, the Times gave him a job as their Meadville correspondent.\n\nWhile at Allegheny, and after numerous trips back to Erie to see her, he married the former Alice White, also a graduate of Academy High School. Alice, who worked in Meadville to support her student husband, died on May 28, 2016. They had sixty eight years of a happy marriage.\n\nThe union produced three children, Michael Wellejus, a retired Erie School District music teacher; Rebecca (Becky) Wellejus, a retired Speech Language Pathologist; and Dr. Matthew Wellejus, (married to the former Aimee Beer), a Periodontist, Chief of the Dental facility at the Columbus, OH Veterans Administration Hospital.\n\nAlso surviving are four grandchildren, Troy Wellejus (Lynne) of Erie; Dr. Kevin Wellejus (Jill Hirst), a Veterinarian in Chilton, WI; Marshall Troy Wellejus and Emerson Rose Wellejus of Columbus, OH and two great-grandchildren, Claire Wellejus and Casey Alice Wellejus of Wisconsin.\n\nWellejus took pre-law at Allegheny and was admitted to Dickinson Law School, but the pull of newspaper work was too strong. Newspapering was then a very exciting profession. There was no competition from today’s rivals, television and the internet. Further, there was very keen competition between the then two Erie newspapers, the Times and Erie Dispatch Herald.\n\nFor nearly two decades, Wellejus served as City Hall reporter, visiting City Hall every work day. He later became Editorial Writer and Editorial Page Editor for the Times, retiring in 1993 when he was 67.\n\nIn his work as a journalist, Wellejus had a breakfast meeting with Eleanor Roosevelt; interviewed General George C. Marshall; attended a White House luncheon hosted by President Ronald Reagan; rode with President Jimmy Carter from the GE Plant to WICU; sat beside then Senator John F. Kennedy when he gave his famous address on 10th street outside the then Lawrence Hotel; and twice rode in the state plane with Governor Raymond P. Shafer – once to Atlantic City and once to Pittsburgh. Gov. Shafer, who had become a personal friend from Allegheny College days, came to Erie to be the speaker at a retirement dinner the Chamber of Commerce had for Wellejus.\n\nFor 25 years, Wellejus had a daily newscast on WJET radio, broadcasting from the editorial rooms of the Times. He was a regular on a weekly WSEE-TV show which featured local newsmakers. For two years, he hosted an interview show on WQLN-TV with state legislators. He also once discussed regional politics on national public TV when Jim Lehrer was in the area during a presidential campaign year.\n\nHe also did public relations work at Penn State Behrend for seven years, this before the college had a formal public relations department. He did graduate work at Gannon University, and he completed a journalism course at Columbia University in New York City.\n\nWellejus once made a motor trip around the entire rim of Lake Erie, writing stories at every stop. He rode a jeep through the entire length of the Millcreek tube, seeking weak points.\n\nWellejus was on friendly terms with nine of the ten Erie Mayors he dealt with, beginning with Charles R. Barber. He spent several days in New Haven, CT, studying the redevelopment of Mayor Richard C. Lee. This was preparatory to Erie’s decision to hire the famous planner, Maurice Rotival, to develop an Erie renewal effort.\n\nWellejus served as Secretary of the Erie Bicentennial Commission in 1995, which left its legacy of the Bicentennial Tower at the foot of State Street. He served on the boards of the Erie County Historical Society and Museums, Erie Humane Society, the Perry Memorial House Commission and WPSE – The Penn State Behrend radio station. He served as a panel member for ten years in determining the winner of the Chief Justice Samuel J. Roberts scholarship – an Erie County Bar Association effort.\n\nAlways interested in Erie history, Wellejus was the author of “Erie: Chronical of a Great Lake City”, published in 1980; “The Community, The Times and the Anniversary of the Times Publishing Company”, published in 1988 on the occasion of the paper’s 100th anniversary; “Historic Erie County”, published by the Erie County Historical Society in 2005; and was the principal writer of “Erie: Two Hundred Years As A Community.”\n\nWellejus was an honorary member of both the Erie Rotary Club and the Erie Kiwanis Club, the only Erie resident to serve at the same time as a member of both clubs. He was also a longtime member of the Y-Men’s Club, the Friday Noon discussion group and the Erie Maennerchor Club.\n\nIn 1981 after his first history book was published, Wellejus was named a Distinguished Pennsylvanian by the William Penn Committee in Philadelphia. In 1984 the Erie County Historical Society gave him an award for Outstanding Service to the Field of Local History, In 1986 Wellejus was given the Dr. Gertrude A. Barber Distinguished Service award. In 1993, after his retirement, the Erie Area Chamber of Commerce gave him the Louis J. Tullio Community Service Award.\n\n’50\n\nRobert Wayne “Bob” Adams on March 9, 2022. Robert Wayne “Bob” Adams, 98, of Monroeville passed away Wednesday, March 9, 2022.

He was the husband of 53 years to the late Dorothy Marie (Roha) Adams, who passed away in 2003. Bob enlisted in 1943 and began training in the Army Air Forces, which later became US Air Force. As a Cadet, he trained as a pilot, bombardier, and navigator. Later, the Army needed soldiers in the European front of WW2 and the Air Cadet program was cancelled. He then served as a radio operator in the infantry until the Germans surrendered. After a short leave, Bob was shipped off to the Pacific Theatre of operations where he served in the Philippines until operations concluded that phase of the war. He was Honorably Discharged on March 9, 1946. Through the years he was always proud of the time in the military and especially of his unit, The Blackhawks 86th Division, that he served with. He kept in touch with his fellow Blackhawks’ comrades well into his 90s, attending many of the reunions. He is survived by his son, Jeffrey (Karen) Adams, daughter, Jan (Rob) Adams, grandchildren, Kristen (Eric) Burgess, and Ryan (Amy) Adams, and great-grandsons, Lincoln & Parker Burgess, and Mason Adams.\n\nMarjorie Ann Beck Ritchie on July 12, 2022. Born in Karns City, Pennsylvania, she attended Karns City High. She graduated from Allegheny with a degree in education. As an undergraduate, she organized a women’s basketball team that played an intercollegiate schedule, an unusual accomplishment at the time. She also served on the Allegheny College Board of Trustees later in life. In addition, Ritchie was a member of the Allegheny College Timothy Alden Council Executive Committee and served as a volunteer, on a Reunion Committee, and on the Allegheny College Alumni Congress.\n\nAfter graduation, she had a job teaching elementary school in Willoughby, Ohio.

It is with sadness and love that we share the passing of our mother, Anne Marilyn Bowden, from cancer on January 21, 2021. Her final days were spent surrounded by family and in close contact with far-flung friends whose lives she enriched, and who honor her legacy by continuing to live their lives to their fullest in these most uncertain Times. Anne was born on February 28, 1935, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Dorothy (Paterson) and John Bowden. She grew up in Port Elgin, Ontario and Cleveland, Ohio,graduating from Cleveland Heights High School in 1952. The first in her family to attend college, she graduated from Allegheny College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and Phi Beta Kappa honors in 1956. Following graduation she was awarded a teaching Fulbright Scholarship to France. She married Eugene Borza in 1958 when they were both teachers at Lakewood High School, in Cleveland, Ohio. While Gene attended graduate school at the University of Chicago, Anne taught at the Chicago Lab School and raised their two children, Karen and Michael. The family moved to State College, PA in the early 1960s where Anne earned her Master’s Degree in English and taught at Penn State. She and Gene divorced in 1974. Eager to try her hand at editing, Anne worked for the Pennsylvania State University Alumni Association as associate editor for the alumni magazine, The Penn Stater, before returning to teaching. During the late 1970s to the mid 1980s Anne was a beloved English teacher at State College Area High School. To this day her former students vividly remember her subtle elegance, ability to breathe life into poetry, sharp wit, formidable vocabulary lists, inclusive teaching practices, and passion for excellence. Many of them have eagerly shared with us how her classes prepared them for life in ways they did not anticipate. In the early 1980s she met the love of her life, Jan Zwartendyk and she moved to Ottawa Canada to be with him. When not tending their ravishing garden or exploring Europe Anne worked as a consultant teaching public speaking and business writing for the Professional Development Institute. Upon Jan’s retirement they left the chilly Ottawa winters for the milder climate of State College, PA until 1996 when, ensorcelled by the pink sunsets and the mountains of the desert southwest, they moved to Tucson, AZ. There they quickly developed a tight-knit group of friends centered around their mutual interests in nature, music, and Havanese dogs. Anne generously gave her gift of time as a volunteer at numerous Tucson organizations including: as a docent at the Tohono Chul Botanical Gardens, as a meal provider for the Tucson Interfaith HIV/AIDS Network, and as a Court Appointed Special Advocate with Pima County CASA. As snowbirds Anne and Jan migrated between Tucson, AZ and Salem, OR where the highlight of their summers was taking care of their granddaughter Julia. Following Jan’s death in 2014 Anne moved permanently to Salem to be closer to her family and where she enjoyed learning tai chi, playing mahjongg, bird-watching, writing, and engaging in the camaraderie of Willamette University’s Institute for Continued Learning (ICL). A highlight of ICL was her 2016 presentation “Flight & Rescue”, the story of her father-in-law (Jan Zwartendyk Sr’s) efforts to help Jews escape the Nazi’s during WWII. A prolific writer Anne chronicled the life of her remarkable mother, who lived to be 106, in the 2009 biography “An Uncommon Life.” We are grateful for the many journals and letters she left to us, knowing that hearing her voice in her words would give us peace, and likely a raised eyebrow or two. Facing her terminal cancer diagnosis in the summer of 2020, Anne developed a clear set of goals: a lifelong Democrat, she would vote in the 2020 election and see Biden-Harris to the White House and her friend Deb Patterson elected to the Oregon State Senate office. With the presidential election (sort of) settled, but significantly weakened by her illness, Anne was determined to remain in this world to watch the Presidential Inauguration. She did. And on her final evening, as the fireworks lit up the Capitol Mall and it seemed as though the world might be righting itself, she smiled and pronounced it a good day. Anne was happiest when cooking up a feast, bird-watching, gardening, reading, and volunteering. She will be remembered by those who knew and loved her as a faithful, loyal, generous, and forgiving friend, and a consummate life-long learner. Anne is survived by her daughter, Karen Borza Arabas (Ed), of Salem, OR; her son, Michael John Borza, of Lake Oswego, OR; her granddaughter Julia Kathryn Arabas of Salem, OR; and her lifelong friend, Dorothy Skinner, of Alexandria, VA. She is preceded in death by her beloved husband, Jan Zwartendyk; her sister, Teri Sue Bowden; her brothers John Bowden and Glenn Bowden; her mother, Dorothy Bowden; and her father, John Wesley Bowden.\n\nColleen Diana Stone Lang on August 8, 2022.

Her passion was teaching. She was an elementary school teacher most of her life. After teaching, she gained the certification to become a travel agent. She was a huge part of the Pinole community. In the early years of Silver Creek, she helped run the swim team and created, directed, and produced the summer water ballet performances. When Silver Creek became the YMCA, she was named the Aquatics Director. Between the YMCA and Canyon Pool Swim School, she taught what seems like every kid in Pinole how to swim. A stroke and an MS Diagnosis in the early 90’s slowed her a bit, but not much. Most of all, she devoted her life to her kids and grandkids. Always with a quick wit, humor, and the sparkle in her blue eyes, she remained strong and positive until the end. Her greatest joy was her children and grandchildren.
