        "text": "The dawn of 1945 finds a U.S. Army at its peak in the Pacific Theater. Allied victory over Japan is all but assured. The only question is how many more months — or years — of fight does the enemy have left. Learn from Dr. John C. McManus about the final fierce struggles of World War II, including Luzon, Manila, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, and the Pacific War’s most prominent general, Douglas MacArthur, who faced complex challenges in Japan’s unconditional surrender and America’s lengthy occupation.\n\nJohn C. McManus, Ph.D., is Curators’ Distinguished Professor of U.S. military history at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. His critically acclaimed books include “September Hope,” “The Dead and Those About to Die,” “Island Infernos,” and “Fire and Fortitude,” recipient of the Gilder Lehrman Prize for Military History.\n\nRegister for virtual Book Talk on Feb. 15, 2024."
