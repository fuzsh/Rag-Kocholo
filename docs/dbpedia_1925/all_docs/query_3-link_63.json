AND REBECCA (TERRELL) McMANUS OF LANCASTER CO., SC\n\nJohn Hugh McManus, Sr. md Rebecca TERRELL, dau of Richmond and Catherine (???) TERRELL of Flat Creek, Lancaster District, SC. The dates for John come from his tombstone. Rebecca’s must be estimated based on incorrect censuses, her last-born child and an affidavit that they attended the wedding of Charles McManus 1799. John grew up in Chesterfield District along Big Lynch's River but by 1810 had moved across the river into Lancaster County. The records that define their lives are found in the common census, deeds, legal judgments, death records and the local newspaper.\n\nMilitary\n\nA John McMANUS, Patriot, recorded in B. G. Moss’ Roster of SC Patriots shows, \"His account of 41 days duty done in militia A 17 # 20.10 or # 2.18:6 3/4. No certificate for; nor the time the service performed - or in what year. Ex: J.H.; J. A. Mc. Ag.” The William Alford McManus genealogy indicates John H., Sr. was the Patriot. His known birth year, 1774, makes it highly unlikely. If he served, he surely would have applied for his own pension and the service been mentioned in his obituary. There is another John McManus of Edgefield Co., SC who may be the Patriot.\n\nCommunity & Property\n\nJ. Boykin in 1820 and John Lowery in 1819 completed surveys for Lancaster and Chesterfield Counties and in 1825 the first official SC maps were created, now known as Mills Maps. On the west side of Big Lynch's River are the two confluences of Wild Cat and Turkey Creeks identified respectively as the crossings at HOUGH’s FORD (SC9 today) and McMANUS' FORD (SR37 today).\n\nLynche's Creek between Hough's Ford and McManus Ford\n\nWhere you see the parallel lines are the roads from each crossing that meet on the east side of Lynches at the \"Road to the Courthouse\" in Chesterfield. Plats as early as 1790 show McManus Ford and McManus Road running across and through large parcels of land\n\nA slightly later plat (1832) shows “JOHN McMANUS’ BRIDGE.” His immediate neighbor was John MASSEY, Jr. and through several decades, they were to associate closely in amicable and not so amicable situations.\n\nMcManus Bridge\n\nOn 3 March 1806, Hugh McMANUS, for $100, deeded 200A to his son, John McMANUS, on both sides of Big Lynches Creek in Lancaster and Chesterfield Cos. Wit: Richmond TERRELL, father-in-law Richmond TERRELL; Prv. before John SIMPSON: Recorded on 15 Jan 1807. [1]\n\nIn 1810, John bought 103A from John WELSH, land once granted to Henry CATO in 1787. This land was bounded NE by Charles McMANUS, SW by Jacob FRIZZY and George McMANUS. Wit: Francis BETTIS and Edward TERRELL; Prv. bef Ben DEASON: Recorded 24 July 1813. We know George McMANUS lived on Turkey Creek at Taxahaw. [2]\n\nIn 1817, he purchased an additional 200A along the Waxhaw Rd. and the Spring Branch, adj. Charles PIGG and CAYGLE, an original grant to Andrew INGLIS. Wit: John BLACKMON, James DOUGLAS, Proved bef. B. DEASON; Recorded 1825.\n\nIn 1821, Hugh, again sold John 200A in Lancaster Dist., on the SW side of Lynches, bounded on the E by that Creek and on the SW by land of John MASSEY and the N and NW by his own land. Wit: Amos DEASON and Moses HOUGH. Stepmother, Elizabeth McMANUS, gave dower consent before B. Deason on 17 Sep 1825; Recorded 7 Dec 1825. [3]\n\nBy this time he had acquired over 700 acres along Lynches. One day in 1827 he commenced to perform some cleaning up of some of the property by \"cutting large trees and undergrowth.\" Soon after he received a subpoena to appear in court for \"trespassing\" onto property that was not his. John Massey, Jr. hired and paid a surveyor to confirm this along with locating the original deed writer, a Mr. Richard Todd, who lived 100 miles away, was to testify that this was the same land sold by the HEGLAR family to Massey (no date stated.) Our subject's response was that he could not be held liable since he had already obtained permission to do this from John Massey, Sr., father of the plaintiff. Some witnesses and testators included Elijah PHILLIPS, Ben DEASON, John ROBERTSON, Jacob FUNDERBURK and the father of the Plaintiff, John MASSEY, Senior., et al. After the first court date, Massey, Sr. stated he lived 20 miles from the courthouse and lost his subpoena suggesting he had not attended. At the second hearing he must have appeared as in 1830 he received payment for attending as called. No testimonies other than TODD's were recorded in the package, only subpoenas and receipts for payment. The damages requested were $10,000. The findings were for the plaintiff and he was awarded $4.50. [4]\n\nNot long after his father's death, John obtained a large parcel of land. As the result of a Sheriff's Sale on May 5, 1831 an Estate purchased by William WILLIAMS from Britton KENNINGTON was then put on sale to the highest bidder. For eighty dollars, John McMAINES was the high bidder for the 1060 acres more or less in Lancaster District, included goods, chattels, land and tenements. It was bound by lands of John McMAINUS, John MAFSEY, Joshua FUNDERBURK & Rebecca ROBERTSON and situate on the waters of Turkey Creek, a branch of Big Lynches Creek. Wit: Simon BECKHAM, Eli GILL. Signed, John Sims (Seal) Recorded 26 Feb 1833. Pr: Eli GILL [5] This is likely the land of the McMANUS-CATO-KENNINGTON Cemetery where the family of Ausborn/Osborne McMANUS lived and is buried.\n\nA year or so later we see the John McManus Bridge, above at the \"ford\" on the plat.\n\nCuriously, in 1844 another litigation occurred initiated by his step-mother and step-brother[6] in which John was said to partitioned the property unfairly. In this, some of the land was to be sold or re-partitioned. He stated: \"While on the survey it became a question whether the whole should not be sold, upon this occasion, John was anxious that no sale should be ordered, He said he would prefer that the land should be parcelled out among the adults if they could pay for it, and if they could not, that he would try to pay for the whole if afsigned to him, But he exprefsed apprehension that if sold, it would be bought by one MAFSEY, who adjoined it, to whom he entertained personal objections.\"\n\nIn 1850, John purchased 40 acres at $1.00 per acre from Glas CASTON, a Taxahaw tract beginning at a corner and running down Waxhaw Road and NE to a corner at the head of Tuckahoe Branch, thence east and North to the \"old ridge road\" continuing to the beginning point on Waxhaw Rd. It should be noted that Tuckaho Branch is just to the south and about parallel to Turkey Creek. This should give a clue as to the \"Waxhaw Road\" location that is spoken of often. The instrument was signed 7 Jan 1850, witnessed 12 Jan 1850 by neighbor, John MASSEY before J. R WELSH, Magst. and recorded on 27 Jan of that year. [7]\n\nThe acreage between McManus on Turkey Creek and Massey on Tuckahoe Creek were adjacent each other. In spite of the differences, the youngest sons of each John; namely Amos McManus and Joseph Copeland Massey, became best of friends. Amos was the executor for Joseph's estate after his death in the civil war.\n\nChildren of John and Rebecca\n\nRobert H. (1804 SC - ) md Tabithia WHITLEY and lived in White Co., TN and left descendants.\n\nWilliam \"Billie\" McManus (1805 SC – c1872 LCSC) md (1) Sarah E. HEGLER and (2) Rachel FUNDERBURK lived in LCSC who left descendants in Lancaster Co.\n\nSamuel McManus (1806 LCSC - 6 Feb 1891 LCSC) md Jane FUNDERBURK and lived in Lancaster County and left many descendants.\n\nHugh M. McManus (1814 SC – 13 Oct 1868 LCSC) md Ellender “Nellie” DEASON and lived in LCSC and left sons and daus, some of whom migrated to MS and TX.\n\nMary McManus (1807/1811 LCSC - ) md William FORD and lived in Fulton Co., GA and AL.\n\nRichmond McManus (1813 LCSC - ) md Elizabeth Shelby POLK and lived in Chesterfield and Lancaster Counties, SC and left three children.\n\nAmon McManus (1807/1811 SC - 15 Jul 1847 Puebla, Mexico). See Amon's profile for the obituary of his father.\n\nSarah McManus (8 Mar 1815 Taxahaw, LCSC - 26 Sep 1886 Cheraw, SC) md Keenan T. MORGAN (7 Jun 1805 Wilmington, NC – 6 May 1880) and lived in Cheraw, SC.\n\nCatherine McManus (11 Feb 1817 LCSC - 20 Dec 1886 LCSC) md her first cousin Calvin MASSEY (Nov 1824 SC - c1909 LCSC) s/o Drewry MASSEY and her aunt Mary “Polly” McMANUS. They lived in Lancaster county and had a least one son, Napoleon McManus who was born prior to their marriage. He was recognized legally (apparently an accepted practice in these situations?) and was recorded as McMANUS until he began using MASSEY after his parents died.\n\nMinerva McManus (1807/1811 LCSC - bef 1853 SC). Said by family tradition to have md Benjamin MASSEY.\n\nFrances McManus “Franky” (1819/1823 SC - ) md Aaron PHILLIPS son of Elijah and Sarah (MASSEY) PHILLIPS d/o John MASSEY (1776.VA – 1853.SC) and Joanna COOK (1780VA – bef 1857.SC)\n\nJohn H. McManus, Jr. John Hugh, Jr. (15 Mar 1824 SC - 21 Jul 1863 Richmond, VA) md Mary Minerva COOK and lived in SC and Union Co., NC and left four children, well documented.\n\nAmos McManus Amos W. (15 May 1826 SC - 5 Jul 1910 LCSC) md (1) Martha Ann HOUGH and (2) Rebecca Jane ROBERTS and lived in LCSC. He became Capt. Amos McMANUS of Co. H., \"Lancaster Invincibles.\" He had one daughter only, by his first wife who died soon after the infant's birth and who was raised by her aunt Sarah \"Sally\" McManus Joseph Copeland MASSEY, son of John, Jr., was Amos' best friend.\n\nRebecca Jane (1819/1820 SC - aft 1880 Hoboken, Marengo Co., AL) md Richard Henry HUDSON (30 Oct 1828 SC - 24 Jul 1879 Hoboken, Marengo Co., AL).\n\nFinal Preparations Pt. 1\n\nP. T. Hammond, Esq., Ordinary for said District [8] responded to Richard (sic) Richmond McManus re: his application for Letters of Administration on the [estate] of Rebecca McMANUS late of the District aforesaid, deceased. . . . admonish all kindred and creditors of the said deceased, to appear before me at our next Ordinary's Court for the said district on 19th day of Jan., inst to show cause why the sd admin. should not be granted. Signed 5 Jan 1864.\n\nIn 1860, this son Richmond is found on the agricultural census with a large plantation of slaves and is shown as a plantation manager. Also as executor of his father's estate since 1855, he was managing the farms of others - probably his siblings and at least one cousin, George McManus.\n\nTwo years later, by 18 October 1866 the siblings brought a reciprocal suit against Richmond to settle their parents' estate. Attorneys were Clyburn and DePass – thirteen years after John’s death! A search was made for out of state heirs which had no results. The Wills of John and Rebecca were apparently lost in the war but Richmond eventually produced \"a copy I made for safekeeping in my home.\"\n\nWill of John McManus\n\nSouth Carolina: Lancaster District} In the name of God, Amen; I John McMANUS of the District and State aforesaid, being in my usual health, of sound and disposing mind & memory & far advanced in life & thereby admonished that my days are drawing to a close & being desirous to dispose of what Estate I have acquired by a life of industry do hereby make, the following last Will and Testament to dispose of all & every Estate I may own, now & at my death.\n\n1st} I give devise & bequeath, to my beloved wife, Rebecca McManus, for & during her natural life or widowhood all the Real & personal Estate, which I now or may own at my death, Consisting of the lands upon which I reside & a small Tract in Chesterfield District, also my Negroes, ADAM, JIM*, FEREBY, ELLEN, TONY & their increase, also my stock of Horses, Cattle, Hogs, Sheep, Household & Kitchen furniture, crop Notes, Cash, plantation Tools, wagon & all other the Estate & property I may own at my death, At the death of my wife, the property & Estate given & devised her in this clause & Will is to be disposed of as follows:\n\nI give devise & bequeath to my Daughter John (sic - Sarah) MORGAN, Catherine MASSEY, Frances PHILLIPS, Rebecca Jane HUDSON, Mary FORD, & Grand daughter Mary Ann Clementine McMANUS MASSEY, child of my deceased daughter, MINERVA, a sum sufficient & so much thereof, of said property as will make them & Each Equal with the value of the Land which I have given off by deed as an advancement to my sons [9] & as is expressed in the deeds to my sons, My daughters aforesaid & grand Daughters will & are to be made equal out of this property with my sons for the Land I have given my sons, & then after my daughters are made equal with my sons I order, Will, and direct that the remainder or balance of said property be equally divided amongst my said daughters, & grand Daughters & my sons Robert, William, Samuel, Hugh, Richmond, John and Amos Share and Share alike.\n\nMy object is to make all my children equal & when I made deeds to my Sons I expressed the value of the Land for which they were to account as an Advancement. My daughters at the death of my wife or at my death if I survive her, will then receive & take property to make them & each equal with my sons, for the Land & then all my daughters & grand daughter & my sons aforesaid will receive & take equally of the balance after my daughters are made equal -- This Will is to embrace my whole Estate at my death & includes my Mill & bit of Land attached thereto. [Note: at the corner of the McManus Bridge was a grist mill known as the Stokes-Ammons Grist Mill. It isn't know if this is the mill he references but easily could be.]\n\nLastly, I nominate constitute and appoint my sons, RICHMOND, HUGH and AMOS McManus Executors of this my last Will and Testament & request them to take charge & superintend the Estate for their mother during her life time & at her death to see that the same is divided out according to my Will and herein declared. [Note: Hugh by 1868 was deceased and his heirs received his share.]\n\nIn witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand & seal this First day of September AD 1854. Signed Sealed & declared by JOHN McMANUS as his last Will & Testament in the presence of the Testator & of the persons who have subscribed as witnesses -- The Testator having declared this will was read to him before signing. John McMANUS (Ts) Wit: Silas BIRD; John CLYBURN; A J MILLER.\n\nFinal Preparations Pt. 2\n\nOn 13 Nov 1868 D. A Williams, JP posted another summons to all of the heirs named in the will again, including those out of state, to appear on 4th January AD 1869 to show cause. The immediate response:\n\nWe accept the legal service of the within Summons & consent to a Sale of the Lands & settlement of the Estate of John McMANUS dec’d as prayed for in the Petition November 14 1868. Test: N. B. McMANUS; D. J. HUNTER. Signed: Calvin (his mark) MASSEY; A McMANUS; K. T. MORGAN for Self & Wife; Samuel McMANUS; William McMANUS; R. McMANUS; (of TN), Elihu SHUTE for self and Wife; (grandchildren) Arzilla McMANUS, Lotta D. (mark) McMANUS; Angilla McMANUS, Robt. SNIPES and wife Ann; K. G. BILLINGS for Infant Defendants.\n\nNext appears, on the court date, the resolution and results, again the out of state heirs failing to show. Several years later however, Rebecca and Frances each signed over their Power of Attorney to Calvin MASSEY and Aaron PHILLIPS respectively. Ordered that the Petition in this case be taken pro confesso against the absent Defendants, Robert McMANUS, William FORD, & wife, Marry, Aaron PHILLIPS & wife Frances, R. H. HUDSON & wife Rebecca, S. V. McMANUS, (grandchildren) Amos McMANUS, Thurlow McMANUS, Sarah McMANUS & John McMANUS, they having failed to plead, answer or demur. January 4th 1869 D A WILLIAMS J.P., LC\n\nOn hearing the Petition and answer in the above stated cause, On Motion of De PASS & CLYBURN solicitors for Petitioners: It is ordered that the Sheriff of Lancaster County SC after advertising twenty one days in the “Lancaster Ledger” do sell at public auction at Lancaster Court House on the first Monday of April next the Real Estate of John McMANUS deceased which consists of one House and Lot at Taxahaw and Sixty Seven acres of Land bounded by lands of Amos McMANUS, J. W. A. PORTER and others & mentioned in the Petition in the above stated cause.\n\nGiven under my hand and seal this 6th day of March AD 1869 D A WILLIAMS JPLC Entered in Sheriffs Office March 8th 1869, JAMES D CASKEY, SLC: I have this day exposed to public outcry to the highest bidder 3 Tracts of land as the property John McMANUS dec’d to wit: One Acre more or less properly known as a house and Lot at Taxahaw, bid of by J V WELSH for $400.~ - Also 7 Acres more or less bid of by J C BLAKENEY for $70.00 ~ Also 60 Acres more or less known as the Home Place bid of by AMOS McMANUS for $1000.00. This April 5th 1869 J D CASKEY, SLC\n\nDeath & Legacy\n\nThe year of his death he and Rebecca testified for Sarah McManus in her application for a widow's pension for husband Charles. The interview was clearly one sided - insinuating senility on John's part and lying by Sarah. See Sarah McManus for transcription.\n\nThe Commissioner's Report of the 1844 litigation involving the re-partitioning of estate land and John's apprehension regarding its sale, prompted the Commissioner to remark: \"It appeared that ?some persons and John himself set a higher value upon the land than afsifsment of the commifsioners.\" It does seem that John McManus had a conservatory nature toward the land and held himself responsible for it. The McManus Bridge property remained in the hands of the family until the mid 20th century. The land around it is also still being maintained by descendants.\n\nJohn is buried in the McManus Family Cemetery of which his is the only fully legible stone and is still being maintained. The rest of the area is full of sunken places where clearly others are buried. One small stone shows \"CM\" which is likely for his daughter Catherine or possibly her husband Calvin.\n\nThe cemetery is in an old oak grove about 1/4mi from the Old Armstrong Place,\" aka, John Armstrong plantation.

The term ‘Hotch pot’ is used figuratively to signify the blending and mixing property belonging to different persons, in order to divide it equally among those entitled to it. For example, if a man seised of 30 acres of land, and having 2 children, should, on the marriage of one of them, give him 10 acres of it, and then die intestate seised of the remaining 20; now, in order to obtain his portion of the latter, the married child, must bring back the 10 acres he received, and add it to his father's estate, when an equal division of the whole will take place, and each be entitled to fifteen acres.
