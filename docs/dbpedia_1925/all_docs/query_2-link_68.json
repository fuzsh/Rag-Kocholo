        "text": "A weekend reading review! Timely in light of this being the weekend before Fourth of July!\n\nJohn C. McManus. To the End of the Earth. New York, NY: DC Comics, May 2, 2023. 436 pp.\n\n5 out of 5\n\nPurchase: Amazon\n\nDo you want to read a book about the US Army’s effort in fighting World War Two in Asia and the Pacific? This is written by a capable military historian; the author John McManus is the professor of military history at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. I actually did not realize that this is the final volume in a three volume trilogy and I supposed this shows how the volume is meaningful even if it is a stand alone reading. I think this is a must-read for those who love World War Two history and the Pacific theatre; and the author’s point is right on with how there’s a need for more of the US Army account of their efforts in the Pacific since often general readers know about the Pacific theatre more with the effort of the Marines and the Navy. Some can have the wrong idea to think that the Pacific was largely won by these two services when the reality is the US Army played a big role with the fight and victory in the Pacific.\n\nThis is such a large topic and went from the Myanmar/Burma road building project, the Philippines, China and Okinawa, Japan. I found it fascinating with how the author is able to weave in stories of individual soldiers fighting the war as grunts, to prisoners of war in the Philippines and also the account of military leadership of officers and generals. Interesting to me is the account of the surrender of the Japanese and the Japanese surprised at how merciful the Americans were to them. The details are fascinating of how the surrender ceremony took place in USS Missouri.\n\nThere’s so much details in the book that I can’t capture it all in this review. I can only recommend this to others. It led me, a Marine veteran, to appreciate the enormous contribution of the US Army in the Pacific. I plan now to read the other two earlier volume in this trilogy."
