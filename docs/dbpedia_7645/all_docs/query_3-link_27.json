His success as a developer during the 1960s allowed him to get into the TV business in the early 1970s with Telemilano, which grew into Mediaset, one of Italy's largest media companies.\n\nA gifted salesman, Berlusconi became a billionaire through holdings in media, food, insurance, advertising and construction.\n\nHe formed the political party Forza Italia in 1993 in response to corruption scandals that had weakened the Italian government, and took office as prime minister the following year.\n\nDespite a parade of lawsuits and scandals of his own -- from accusations of tax fraud to a 2010 sex scandal involving an underage prostitute -- Silvio Berlusconi remained the most powerful man in Italian politics, in and out of office, for 17 years.\n\nIn 2011, however, a prolonged financial crisis and three pending trials finally proved too much, and Berlusconi resigned as prime minister. He was convicted of tax fraud in Milan in October of 2012 and sentenced to four years in prison; he remained free while appealing the verdict but was banned from running for office until 2019 (a ban he fought).\n\nElected to the European Parliament in 2019, Berlusconi was the oldest serving member but not much of a participant, thanks in large part to getting the Covid virus. After a series of hospitalizations, he died in 2023."
