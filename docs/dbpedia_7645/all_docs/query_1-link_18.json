        "text": "Few Italians have wielded more influence and attracted more notoriety than Silvio Berlusconi: billionaire businessman, four-time prime minister, and member of the European Parliament.\n\nFor years he successfully brushed off sex scandals and allegations of corruption, until Italy's eurozone debt crisis in 2011 saw his influence temporarily wane.\n\nWorse was to come for the man whom many Italians had come to see as untouchable.\n\nHe was convicted of tax fraud in 2013 and ejected from the Italian Senate. Another conviction in 2015 made it look like his political career was finally over.\n\nBut despite suffering a heart attack that his doctor said could have killed him in 2016, and having emergency bowel surgery in 2019, the charismatic showman was set for yet another political comeback.\n\nEven though he was banned from holding public office due to his criminal record, he led his centre-right Forza Italia party to moderate electoral success in 2018. And a year later, with his ban lifted, won himself a seat in the European Parliament at the age of 82.\n\nHe graduated in law in 1961 and then set up Edilnord, a construction company, establishing himself as a residential housing developer around his native Milan.\n\nTen years later he launched a local cable-television outfit - Telemilano - which would grow into Italy's biggest media empire, Mediaset, controlling the country's three largest private TV stations.\n\nHis huge Fininvest holding company now has Mediaset and Italy's largest publishing house Mondadori under its umbrella, and has stakes in daily newspaper Il Giornale among other companies.\n\nBerlusconi sold AC Milan football club to Chinese investors for Â£628m (â¬740m) in 2017.\n\nHis children - Marina, Barbara, Pier Silvio, Eleonora and Luigi - all take part in the running of his business empire.\n\nIn 2018, Forza Italia was left out of the coalition with the right-wing Northern League despite a solid election performance â and Berlusconi could not have held public office himself in any event, due to his criminal record.\n\nBut that ban was overturned the same year, when he was deemed \"rehabilitated\" by the courts - and he announced he would contest the May 2019 European elections.\n\nIn those elections, Forza Italia picked up less than 10% of the vote in Italy â but enough for several seats, including Berlusconi's.\n\nIn October 2010, it emerged that Berlusconi had called a police station asking for the release of a 17-year-old girl, Karima \"Ruby\" El Mahroug.\n\nShe was being held for theft and was also said to have attended his \"bunga-bunga\" parties.\n\nIn June 2013 he was found guilty of paying her for sex, and of abuse of power. The case was eventually overturned in 2014."
