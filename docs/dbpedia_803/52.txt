The Newton's cradle is a device, and an effective teaching model, which demonstrates the principles of conservation of momentum and conservation of energy by using and observing of colliding swinging metal balls. Used at schools, usually during physics calsses to teach conservation of momentum, Newton's rules, elastic collisions.

As a popular educational device, Newton's Cradle consists of an odd number of identical metal spheres suspended from a frame in a horizontal line. This teaching aid consists of 5 nickel plated stainless steel balls (4.3 g each) with attached strings, metal frame and wooden base.

The device comes disassembled, and while it is pretty easy to put together, you must very careful and delicate while assembling it. The strings can warp easily and will make the cradle out of alignment. Wait to remove the styrofoam until after the uprights are screwed into place. Putting it together incorrectly can lead to string warping which will ruin your nice Newton's Cradle.

Dimensions: 14 x 11.5 x 13.5 cm.

Other names used: Newton's pendulum, Newton's balls, Newton's rocker. The name refers to English scientist, Sir Isaak Newton.
