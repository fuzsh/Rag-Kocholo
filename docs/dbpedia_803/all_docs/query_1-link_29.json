        "text": "This research is aimed at analyzing the velocity of motion of an object with the aid of technology. By using the application videopad to develop an understanding of mechanical concepts, learners are given the opportunity to build on their own knowledge through real world experience. To this end, a physics learning medium, i.e., a mechanical toy car, was developed following the principle of utilizing elements from the environment as a primary learning resource. As a subject matter physics is characterized by both difficult as well as easy concepts, such that not all concepts can be understood by learners only by reading, listening or showing. This learning medium was used to measure the velocity of a moving object by manipulating the trajectory of the toy car. This toy car, which was made out of a recycled drinking bottle, uses a DVD motor as an engine with a battery as power source. The method used was to allow the car to move along the prepared track, accompanied by progressive changes in the mass of its load. The motion of the car was video-recorded in mp4 format, then analyzed using videopad to determine the time and the distance taken. This learning medium was also designed to be able to explain some physical concepts related to mechanics, including one-dimensional motion, circular motion, motion dynamics, energy and work, as well as momentum and impulse.\n\nThis workshop aims to demonstrate how the Tracker Video Analysis and Modeling Tool engages, enables and empowers teachers to be learners so that we can be leaders in our teaching practice. Through this workshop, the kinematics of a falling ball and a projectile motion are explored using video analysis and in the later video modeling. We hope to lead and inspire other teachers by facilitating their experiences with this ICT–enabled video modeling pedagogy (Brown, 2008) and free tool for facilitating students-centered active learning, thus motivate students to be more self–directed.\n\nWe will share on the use of Tracker as a pedagogical tool in the effective learning and teaching of physics performance tasks taking root in some Singapore Grade 9 (Secondary 3) schools. We discuss the pedagogical use of Tracker help students to be like scientists in these 6 to 10 weeks where all Grade 9 students are to conduct a personal video analysis and where appropriate the 8 practices of sciences (1. ask question, 2. use models, 3. Plan and carry out investigation, 4. Analyse and interpret data, 5. Using mathematical and computational thinking, 6. Construct explanations, 7. Discuss from evidence and 8. Communicating information). We will situate our sharing on actual students work and discuss how tracker could be an effective pedagogical tool. Initial research findings suggest that allowing learners conduct performance task using Tracker, a free open source video analysis and modelling tool, guided by the 8 practices of sciences and engineering, could be an innovative and effe...\n\nThe educational use of video and multimedia is increasing rapidly in secondary and higher education across all disciplines. Videos for physics education can be found in many universities and other educational institutions websites all over the world. In the area of experimental physics, the available videos demonstrate mainly physical phenomena or physics experiments and only few of them allow for the quantitative estimation of physical parameters. In this work, we present characteristic videos of an ongoing project aiming at the development of a collection of educational videos that guide the users – students to measure data and to analyze them in order to calculate physical quantities. These videos can be used for physics teaching, as a demonstration, as a supplementary educational tool for the students' pre lab preparation and also in the physics lab, if the necessary equipment is not available or in case of time consuming measurements. The pilot use of a video related to the measurement of the lead attenuation coefficient in the lab is presented accompanied by the student assessment. The students favor the use of video mainly as a supplementary tool for their pre lab preparation and not as a substitute of the real experiment.\n\nThis exploratory study intends to model kinematics learning of a pair of student teachers when exposed to prescribed teaching strategies in a video-based laboratory. Two student teachers were chosen from the Francophone B.Ed. program of the Faculty of Education of a Canadian university. The study method consisted of having the participants interact with a video-based laboratory to complete two activities for learning properties of acceleration in rectilinear motion. Time limits were placed on the learning activities during which the researcher collected detailed multimodal information from the student teachers’ answers to questions, the graphs they produced from experimental data, and the videos taken during the learning sessions. As a result, we describe the learning approach each one followed, the evidence of conceptual change and the difficulties they face in tackling various aspects of the accelerated motion. We then specify advantages and limits of our research and propose reco..."
