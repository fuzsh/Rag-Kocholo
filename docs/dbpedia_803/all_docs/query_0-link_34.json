For this physics experiments for kids, you will make a newtonâ€™s pendulum to explore how what happens when two objects colide. This newton cradle project is fun for all ages from preschool, pre-k, kindergarten, first grade, 2nd grade, 3rd grade, and 4th grade students. With a few simple materials I will show you how to make a newtonâ€™s cradle; this is a SUPER cool and easy science experiment.\n\nNewtonâ€™s Cradle\n\nA Newtonâ€™s Cradle is a classic physics demonstration that is frequently seen in science museums or as a desk decoration. This Newtonâ€™s cradle project demonstrates the conservation of energy and momentum when the balls collide. While the idea of doing a physics science project with your kids probably sounds super complicated, donâ€™t worry â€“ itâ€™s not! This simple newtonâ€™s pendulum uses common objects to replicate this cradle of energy and observe how energy is transfered from one object to another. Try this how to make a Newtonâ€™s Cradle with preschoolers, kindergartners, grade 1, grade 2, grade 3, and grade 4 students.\n\nHow to Make a Newtonâ€™s Cradle\n\nAll you need to try this physics experiment are a few simple materials including:\n\n5 bouncy balls\n\n5 pushpins\n\nthread\n\n4 identical bottles at least 8â€³ tall\n\n4 bamboo skewers\n\nruler\n\ntape\n\nNewtons Cradle Project\n\nCarefully stick a pushpin into each of the bouncy balls. Now cut FIVE 17-inch long pieces of thread. Tie the center of one thread around the pushpin in the bouncy ball. Repeat with all 5 bouncy balls.\n\nNewton cradle pendulum\n\nMake sure all bottles are filled with liquid and have their cap securely in place. Place bottles at four corners of a rectangle that is 6 inches wide and 10 inches long. Set bamboo skewers across the bottles to form a rectangle. The shorter side wil have some of the stick hanging off on both ends. Now tape the skewers to the lids of the bottles to hod them in place.\n\nSwinging balls pendulum\n\nTie the ends of the bouncy ballâ€™s thread on opposite long side skewers makign sure that each ball hangs at the exact same heigh all in a row.\n\nEasy Science Experiments\n\nThey should all hang so they are almost touching and as low as possible. Add tape to the stick to ensure that each string doensâ€™t slide around.\n\nNewtonâ€™s Pendulum\n\nNow itâ€™s time to try your Newtons Cradle! Carefully pull back one ball from one end and let it go.\n\nFun Physics Experiments\n\nWatch the ball on the other end fly out!\n\nPhysics Experiments for Kids\n\nNow try pulling back two balls and see how many balls fly out the other side.\n\nNewtonâ€™s Third Law\n\nHis third law states that for every action (force) in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction. If object A exerts a force on object B, object B also exerts an equal and opposite force on object A.\n\nNewtonâ€™s cradle explanation\n\nWhenever two objects collide the total amount of kinetic energy stays the same. How much energy depends on the objects mass and the speed at which the items collide. So if the fast- moving object hits another object of the same mass that is sititng still, the momentum (movement) is transferred from the fast object to the still object. If the collision is statice, energy is not lost to friction, the still object will move at the same speed as the fast object and will not stop. In Newtonâ€™s cradle all the balls have the same mass and the hard rubber makes for a mostly elastic collision.\n\nWant to take it a step farther? What if you tried using ping pong balls which are lighter than the bouncy balls. Would it still work the same?\n\nFun Science Experiments for Kids\n\nLooking for more outdoor activities for kids and things to do in the summer?
