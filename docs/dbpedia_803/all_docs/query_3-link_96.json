        "text": "Worth the money\n\nI purchased this for my husbands office. He loved it. It is great quality and a good size for his desk. I did not see any flaws. The only thing I would suggest is be careful when you take it out of the box because the strings might get a little stick to the foam\n\nIs not a big deal but better to be precautious since the balls need to be aligned to bounce very well. Worth the money\n\nBest Cradle I’ve ever bought\n\nI like the glass base , I have seen one like this before, so as soon as I saw it I had to get it. The boxing is very well done, perfect for a present. Unlike the ones I have purchased in the past this one came assembled and all the balls were perfectly aligned. It actually bounces more than 40 seconds. Can’t wait to put it in my office. The only thing I will suggest is to remove the foam very carefully so you can take out the glass cradle easily.\n\nThis product is a must buy for all physics big fans like myself.\n\nVery happy with my purchase\n\nI always wanted this kinetic toy but with a base that was not black. When I saw this one I bought it right away. The balls are heavy enough to bounce for more than 40 seconds. This is well constructed and looks great specially in an office. The size is perfect. You dont even need to bother to put it together because it comes already assembled.\n\nBest cradle ever\n\nI am a physics geek and always like kinetic toys. In high school I remember my parents got me a cradle and I loved it. However I always thought a plain dark base was boring. When I saw this one was made of glass I did not think it twice I had to buy it. The product is amazing. Top quality and the packing looks great.\n\nIt come already assembled so I just had to take it from the foam box and it was ready\n\nI have already order 3 more for my kids\n\nAmazing, really fancy\n\nAmazing product. It looks so fancy. It comes already assembled and ready to be used. It looks great in my office. You can tell this newton cradle is high quality not only because of the balls and bars are stainless stell but also because the glass base has no sharp corners. The glass base is heavy and beautiful. Will buy again for sure\n\nSimply the best\n\nI bought it for my sister’s office and she loves it. Looks very nice and the quality is great. The best part is that it comes already assembled and ready to use. I am planning on getting a few for Christmas this year. The product arrived with a high quality box.\n\nStands out from everything else!\n\nSo happy with this cradle!\n\nI got it as a present for my birthday and I absolutely love it.\n\nI love physics and I had a few cradles before but they were all black, this one is gorgeous.\n\nThe base is made of glass, which makes it stand out from everything else I have in my office.\n\nGreat quality! Very happy!\n\nProfessional and Sharp-Looking\n\nOrdered this one as a present for my brother and he loved it! He brought it to his office.\n\nThe glass base stands out from a few other cradles I’ve bought before. It arrived in perfect condition and very fast. Now I am getting one for my boss for Christmas!\n\nGreat gift idea\n\nBeautiful design\n\nGot it as a gift for christmas for one of my cousins but it looked so good that I had to buy one for myself. Balls are aligned and tangle for up to 40ish seconds\n\nProduct is perfect for kids that love physics\n\nStands out from everything else!\n\nSo happy with this cradle!\n\nI got it as a present for my birthday and I absolutely love it.\n\nI love physics and I had a few cradles before but they were all black, this one is gorgeous.\n\nThe base is made of glass, which makes it stand out from everything else I have in my office.\n\nGreat quality! Very happy!\n\nGreat gift\n\nMy sister bought 5 of these as a present for the kids in her class and I couldn’t resist to take one =) I had to keep one for myself because I knew it was going to look great in my office. You can tell the product is high quality. Balls bounce an average of 35 seconds. The glass base looks well made and is very thick\n\nBeautiful Newton cradle\n\nIt came fully assembled which was very surprising since most cradles you have to assemble them. It has this great heavy glass base which I must say looks very cool. My sister bought it for me as my birthday present and honestly loved it. Balls are heavy and the package is great. Only thing will suggest to adults is if they bought this for kids make sure to remove the foam very carefully.\n\nVery pleased with this!\n\nBeautiful glass base with what appear to be solid connections from the strings to the frame. The moment I put it in my office immediately got the attention of everyone. The cradle has pretty good longevity I will say it tangles up to 50 seconds\n\nThe only thing I would suggest to everyone is be very careful when you remove the cradle from the box. I plan to buy one for my boss next week\n\nFantastic Cradle to Enjoy and Display!\n\nThe cradle is gorgeous! The spheres are aligned correctly and they knock back and forth between 30-60 secs depending on the force you initially apply. It is definitely one of the best displays I’ve had the pleasure of being able to use for the kids.\n\nGreat gift\n\nMy sister bought 5 of these as a present for the kids in her class and I couldn’t resist to take one =) I had to keep one for myself because I knew it was going to look great in my office.

The glass base looks well made and is very thick\n\nGood customer service\n\nProduct arrived damaged, but seller was very responsive, even on Christmas, and shipped out a replacement. The product looks nice, but suffers from the same problems as most Newtons cradles. The precision of construction does not allow for the kinetic energy to be transmitted as efficiently as I was hoping. But it works and looks nice.\n\nThis was probably the most awesome product i got!\n\nI had it with me carried inside my bag to show it to my friends 🙂\n\nAmazed hours of fun for the cat!\n\nAbsolutely love it! Even the cat loves it, hours worth of entertainment I never would have thought for my cat (whom never tangles or knocks over) when it was intended for me… So will purchase another for my office and leave this one at home!\n\nAwesome conversation starter\n\nGreat product, everything was intact and working as it should. The holographic paint really shines as the pendulum is in motion so to speak. It reflects off the metal balls and adds a shimmer effect depending which way it’s swinging. Because of the shimmer effect it’s a great conversation starter."
