Furthermore, veterinary treatments raise the public concerns regarding animal welfare, food safety and antimicrobial use. The costliest disease in the dairy industry is mastitis. The estimated cost of each case is from $155 to 224 in a dairy herd (Bewlwy et al, 2017. JDS 100:1471-1486). This high cost is due to reduction in the milk income loss, treatment, culling losses and discarded milk costs. There is a need for genetic selection tool that can predict the genomic value of young animals (i.e., heifers) to resist mastitis in future lactation seasons. We can use sequencing and genotyping technologies to discover mutations that accurately predict the genomic values for diseases such as mastitis. We also can understand the biology of mastitis resistance development and how we can prevent or minimize the number of incidences of mastitis in dairy farm.\n\nTherefore, the main objective of this project is to identify mutations, genes, molecular mechanisms, and pathways that control mastitis and then develop selection tool that evaluate heifers for mastitis.\n\nSpecific objectives:\n\n1. Reviewing and summarizing existing literature on mastitis\n\n2. Identify genes associated with mastitis diseases via genome-wide association analyses (GWAS)\n\n3. Perform in-silico pathway and gene network analyses to understand the biology behind the differences between animal in mastitis resistance\n\n4. Propose list of mutations that can be used in the industry as a selection tool to decrease the incidence of mastitis in dairy cattle\n\nThe student will work on:\n\na) conducting a comprehensive review of literature on Mastitis as one of the main inflammatory Diseases that affect dairy industry. The EACoN Research Scholar will review studies done on mastitis using transcription analyses, GWAS, Genomic Selection, and Genomic-based Animal Models;\n\nb) identify the problem of inflammatory disease and fertility in the dairy cattle industry and formulate a hypothesis and research objectives;\n\nc) sampling biological samples such as blood, milk and other samples for sequencing and genomic analyses as well as other metabolomic analyses.\n\nd) participating in designing and conducting GWAS and metabolomic experiments,\n\ne) handling big genomic data, as well as interpreting and discussing the research results,\n\nf) disseminating the project outcomes through national and international conferences or peer-reviewed journals publication.\n\nBy the end of this research activities, the BEACoN Research Scholar will be able to:\n\na) write a review of literature using the scientific writing approach, identifying a gap in the literature and formulate an idea that can be tested by fitting a appropriate hypothesis;\n\nb) handle dairy cow and perform sampling of blood, milk and other samples (in case we are still in-person)\n\nc) handle big-data sets and master related bioinformatic tools and databases.\n\nd) model genomic data using various methods of Data Analytics and solve real problems in the dairy cattle industry;\n\ne) gain experience in interpreting and graphical representation of the results using different tools such R software and other\n\nf) sharpen their problem solving, critical thinking, presentation and communication skills through writing and presenting research papers.\n\nRequired qualifications:\n\nstudent majoring in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)\n\nPreferred qualifications:\n\nPrior experience in data analytics and applied bioinformatics tools\n\nBack to top\n\nLuis Castro Lizano\n\n(he/him/his)\n\nlfcastro@calpoly.edu\n\nFood Science and Nutrition (CAFES)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nThe Effect of Yeast Selection on the Chemical and Sensory Properties of Hard Cider\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nYeasts play an important role in the production of fermented beverages such as hard cider. The performance of the yeasts will have a great effect on the aroma profile and chemical composition of the fermented product. Metabolic differences exist among yeast strains, and therefore there is a large range of commercially available yeasts that can be used to produce hard ciders with different chemical and sensory properties. While research has been performed on the effect of yeast strains on the sensory and chemical properties of wines and beers, there is very little information regarding the effects of different yeast strains on aroma and chemical development in hard cider. it is important for the cider industry to gain knowledge on the impact of yeast strains on hard cider properties, as it will allow cider makers to understand and control the characteristics of their product.\n\nThis project will evaluate the effect of yeast selection on the chemical and sensory properties of hard ciders. Hard ciders will be produced using various strains of beer, wine, and cider yeasts, and analysis of the sensory and chemical properties of the finished cider products will be performed. This project will provide valuable information to the cider industry to help with development of new products, thereby expanding the diversity of the cider market.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\n- Assist in the production of hard ciders.\n\n- Perform Chemical Analysis of the resulting hard cider treatments.\n\n- Assist in the Sensory Evaluation of the hard cider treatments.\n\n- Analyze both chemical and sensory data.\n\n- Assist in the development of manuscripts for publication of results as well as poster presentations for national\n\nconferences.\n\nThe BEACoN Research Scholar will gain experience and practical skills in the fermentation process, analytical and sensory techniques, research planning, data analysis, poster and oral presentations, and manuscript preparation. The main skill I wish to develop in the BEACoN Research Scholar is critical thinking.\n\nRequired courses:\n\nCHEM 128: General Chemistry for Agriculture and Life Science II\n\nPreferred courses:\n\nFSN 340: Fermented Foods\n\nCHEM 231: Quantitative Analysis\n\nBack to top\n\nCharlotte Decock\n\n(she/her/hers)\n\ncdecock@calpoly.edu\n\nNatural Resources Management and Environmental Sciences (CAFES)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nFrom Waste to Plant Food – Evaluating the Fertilizer Value of Algae Recovered from Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nCrop production heavily relies on inputs of synthetic fertilizers to meet crop nutrients requirements, most of which are derived from non-renewable resources. Recent supply chain shortages and geopolitical events have heavily impacted the supply and cost of such fertilizer products. This has triggered increased interest within the fertilizer industry and society as a whole to recover nutrients from waste streams, a concept that contributes to a more circular economy. These waste streams include sludge produced during wastewater treatment.\n\nCurrently, spent algae produced from municipal wastewater treatment facilities are typically landfilled. Algae are rich in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), two essential plant nutrients. Therefore, algae have potential to be used as a fertilizer product. N and P are typically slowly released from organic fertilizer sources such as algae, which can prevent loss of these nutrients to ground and surface waters, where they cause environmental pollution.\n\nMeanwhile, if nutrient release lags behind plant nutrient demand, yield losses can occur. In order to use algae sludge in fertilizer products, the behavior of algae in the soil needs to be better understood. In this project, we aim to identify potentially beneficial end-uses of algae sludge in crop production by evaluating the behavior of algae product in soil under laboratory conditions. The study aims to provide a proof-of-concept for the use of algae in fertilizer products. The overall goal is to provide the information required for fertilizer producers to consider the use of algae in commercial products.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nThe BEACoN research scholar will participate in laboratory experiments to assess the behavior of algae-based products in soil. To this end, we will set up laboratory incubation experiments, in which soil will be amended with algae and the release of plant available forms of nitrogen and phosphorus will be monitored over time. Under the guidance of the mentor, the BEACoN scholar will be engaged in the developing the experimental design and optimization of the analysis procedures. During weekly meetings, we will discuss relevant published literature.\n\nThe scholar will be trained on how to analyze and interpret the results from this project, and have various opportunities to communicate findings with project partners. This project if part of a larger project focused on optimizing the efficiency and sustainability of municipal waste water treatment. This project is a collaboration between environmental engineers, soil ecologists, municipalities, and fertilizer industry. The BEACoN scholar will have the opportunity to work within this interdisciplinary team and connect with stakeholders from these various sectors.\n\nIn this project, the BEACoN scholar will gain valuable knowledge about soil health, nutrient cycling, and plant nutrition. We will use standard operating procedures relevant to soil and plant nutrition research. The scholar will be guided through the principles of scientific research and learn how to refine a research question, formulate a hypothesis, conduct and experiment, collect and analyze data, and interpret the research findings in relation to the hypothesis and research question. The research will strengthen the scholar's skills in searching scientific databases, reading scientific papers and using Microsoft excel to manage, visualize and analyze data. In addition, the project offers a unique opportunity to work in an interdisciplinary team, a skill greatly sought after in industry.\n\nRequired experience:\n\nThis project is suitable for students with an interest in soil science, sustainable agriculture or environmental sciences. Research projects are most successful when participants are enthusiastic, motivated, have a strong desire to satisfy their curiosity, and show a great eye for detail.\n\nBack to top\n\nJoey Gray\n\n(she/her/hers)\n\njgray23@calpoly.edu\n\nExperience Industry Management (CAFES)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nTransgender Athlete Participation in Collegiate Sport\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nOne of the most debated sports topics today is transgender athlete participation in collegiate sport. Most of the research explores physical advantages and equality issues. While these factors seem central to transgender athlete participation, it is not difficult to find research that refutes another's findings. Transgender athlete participation in collegiate sport is not only complex but a sensitive topic, with many affiliated with collegiate sports hesitant to share their opinions. Despite the heightened focus on transgender participation in collegiate sport, empirical research on collegiate athletes', coaches', or athletic directors' perceptions is scarce. Studies specifically exploring transgender athlete perceptions are almost not existent.\n\nDepartment of Education (DOE) recently issued a notice of interpretation that Title IX also prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender. Therefore, under Title IX, those who identify as transgender cannot be discriminated against participation in collegiate sport based solely on their gender identity. The issue is not whether transgender athletes can participate in collegiate sport but on which team, the one that is the same as their biological sex at birth or gender identity.\n\nCurrent policies regarding trans-gender athletic participation are inconsistent, making a complicated issue even more difficult for all participants, coaches, fans, and organizations. What is clear, however, is there is a need for a more consistent policy. The National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) mission and priorities focus on academics, fairness, and well-being. More specifically, they state, \"The NCAA is committed to providing a fair, inclusive, and fulfilling environment for student-athletes and giving them a voice in the decision-making process\" (NCAA, 2021). Coach and athletic director views are essential as they interpret and enforce the rules.\n\nThus, our first project is a national survey that explores NCAA and NAIA student-athletes, coaches, and athletic directors' perceptions of transgender participation in collegiate sports. The second project focuses solely on transgender athlete perceptions. Both studies explore participant views regarding fairness, safety, and inclusion related to transgender athlete participation in collegiate sport. Given this topic's controversial and sensitive nature, our work will provide an anonymous opportunity for participants to have their voices heard and potentially contribute to future policies that will directly impact the future of collegiate sport.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nThe mentee will be responsible for assisting with the literature review, data collection, analysis, and submission of at least one article as a co-author. The student will also assist with developing semi-structured interviews, interview scheduling, observation, transcription, and coding.\n\nThe mentee will have a chance to be part of groundbreaking research on one of the most debated topics in sports today, transgender participation in collegiate sport. They will learn how to critique research articles and clean, analyze, and interpret data. In addition, they will learn qualitative methodology, interview techniques, coding data, and interpreting findings. The student will develop the ability to think independently and present objective interpretations of the data by learning to dissect a complex and sensitive issue that often presents conflicting findings.\n\nRequired qualifications:\n\nCandidates should be interested in sports issues and have strong reading, writing, and organizational skills.\n\nPreferred qualifications:\n\nExperience with sports as a participant and/or avid fan and LGBT+ issues.\n\nBack to top\n\nKevin Lin\n\n(he/him/his)\n\nyklin@calpoly.edu\n\nExperience Industry Management (CAFES)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nVirtual Event Experiences and Well-Being: Comparing Multimedia Videos and VR Using Physiological Sensors\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nAs an alternative to live events, virtual events have witnessed rapid growth because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The societal impact of virtual events is far beyond its ability to enable a new way of experiencing events during and post-pandemic. It empowers individuals to experience events at home without the risks associated with travel, and reduces environmental harm caused by mass tourism. The virtual events provide an inclusive opportunity for the low-income group and people with physical disabilities to have and enjoy such an experience.\n\nThe two approaches used to present a virtual event include using multimedia videos or using virtual reality (VR). However, previous studies have not investigated which approach can provide better virtual event experiences. Therefore, this research will adopt an innovative triangulated approach to examine virtual event experiences, including physiological sensors (eye trackers and skin conductance sensors), surveys, and interviews. The research goals are to compare the different effects of multimedia videos and VR on an immersive experience, perceived values, mindfulness, and psychological well-being; to evaluate people’s attention and emotional change when they experience virtual events; and to propose a framework for designing the virtual event experience.\n\nThis research will identify the factors that influence virtual event experiences and provide guide of best practices for its design. The proposed theoretical framework will give insights into enhancing the positive impact of virtual events on well-being. Additionally, this research project will actively involve students. Students will have the opportunity to learn the use of physiological sensors and develop skills in data collection and data analysis.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nUndergraduate students will be working on this study and assisting with data collection, data analysis, and dissemination. Students are vital for the success of this project, and funding will support their involvement and education in this research project.\n\nThe student will participate in:\n\nTraining\n\nCollecting eye tracking and biometric data\n\nConducting surveys\n\nInterviewing participants\n\nAnalyzing the data\n\nConference presentation\n\nWorking on this project may lead to independent studies and senior projects. The students will be actively involved in an innovative triangulated approach, including physiological sensors (eye trackers and skin conductance sensors), surveys, and interviews.\n\nIn particular, the student will be employing physiological sensors to carry out the experiment. In the first condition, participants will wear an eye tracker (i.e., Tobii Pro Glasses 3) and a skin conductance sensor (i.e., Empatica E4 Wristband). In the second condition, participants will wear a VR headset with eye tracking function (i.e., VIVE Pro Eye) and wear Empatica E4 Wristband. Eye tracking technology can record participants’ eye movements and the elements that attract attention. Skin conductance sensors can evaluate emotional changes, including heart rate, electrodermal activity, blood volume, etc.\n\nAnd the students learn to study these things in ways that develop sophisticated skills like critical thinking and articulate communication. In addition, I'll work with the student to help develop the student's survey construction and administration, data analysis, and presentation skills.\n\nRequired qualifications:\n\nGood communication and public speaking skills.\n\nPreferred qualifications:\n\nExperience with experimental design. Basic stats classes.\n\nBack to top\n\nSiroj Pokharel\n\n(he/him/his)\n\nspokhare@calpoly.edu\n\nAnimal Science (CAFES)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nUse of Essential Oil in Poultry Feed: The Overall Impact in Gut Microbiome and Health\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nRecently, antibiotics as feed additives in poultry resulted in increased productivity and lower consumer prices. Perhaps the good news for the producers and consumers, however, the administration of antibiotic feed additives at sub-therapeutic dosages increases the incidence of drug-resistant strains of foodborne pathogens. In recent years, the efficacy of essential oils (EO) has been studied in many in vitro assays. Studies including essential oils have gained popularity after the European Union legislation phased out antibiotics as feed additives in poultry feed. Some in vitro studies have shown that thymol, eugenol, and carvacrol were most effective against enteric pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium.\n\nEssential oils are often incorporated into the feed for better feed utilization and intake in birds. Many studies suggest that EO stimulates digestive enzyme secretion and stabilizes the gut ecosystem, leading to improved feed utilization and less exposure to growth-depressing disorders. This research will focus on utilizing products that contain oregano oil and microencapsulated EO that consist of thymol, eugenol, carvacrol, linalool, etc. These products will be mixed with the regular diet for poultry in various concentrations. Thus, we hypothesize that essential oil (EO) effectively reduces or eliminates enteric pathogens, such as Salmonella, from the intestinal gut of layers. Additionally, EO in feed can increase product performance and improve egg quality.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nEvaluate the effect of essential oil on the gut microbiome and gut health,\n\nCollect fecal matter from layers for enteric pathogen testing.\n\nPerform mesophilic aerobic bacteria, Escherichia coli and coliform, and Salmonella count on collected samples\n\nPrepare Media, autoclaving and other laboratory activities for bacterial isolation\n\nCollect and analyze data\n\nPresent the result in Spring symposium.\n\nThe Research Scholar will gain the following skills:\n\nLaboratory methods from sample collection to processing for microbiological analysis\n\nData collection, analysis using SPSS or SAS, and interpretation of the result\n\nData presentation\n\nRequired qualifications:\n\nBasic Microbiological Procedures\n\nBack to top\n\nSandy Shen\n\n(she/her/hers)\n\nyeshen@calpoly.edu\n\nExperience Industry Management (CAFES)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nVirtual Farm Tours: Investigating the Impacts on Happiness\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nLive virtual tours involve a tour guide launching a real-time video to participants. During the streaming, participants can communicate with each other via text- and/or video-based chat. The tour guide also engages in dialogues with participants. This new form of tourism empowers individuals to experience farms at home without the risks associated with large-scale travel. Virtual farm tours will also allow people with a physical disability to experience farms easier, or reduce the environmental harm caused by over- and mass travel. It is a more inclusive travel form and can help to enhance well-being.\n\nThis research will explore the key features of live virtual farm tours and investigate the relationships between those features, audience satisfaction, perceived value, and outcomes (i.e., happiness, intention to recommend the virtual tour, intention to visit the farm, and intention to buy the farm products). The findings can guide farmers to provide better live virtual farm tours and increase the sales of their agricultural products. More importantly, it could help the people with physical disabilities to have better tour experiences and improve their quality of life.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nBeyond regular meetings with the advisor, the student’s responsibilities in the project will be as follows:\n\nSearch the library database and collect literature related to virtual tours, well-being (happiness), and live-streaming technology in tourism and hospitality\n\nCollect online reviews from the Airbnb Online Experiences platform\n\nWrite a review of the literature and identify the features of live virtual tours\n\nAssist the faculty mentor in conducting interviews and collecting surveys\n\nDrafting the conference or peer-reviewed journal with the faculty mentor\n\nDisseminating the project outcomes through conference or peer-reviewed journals publications\n\nBy the end of this research program, the BEACoN Research Scholar will be able to:\n\nWrite a review of the literature using the academic writing approach\n\nLearn about the use of qualitative data analysis tools (e.g., Leximancer)\n\nMaster the techniques of conducting interviews and collecting surveys\n\nDevelop qualitative and quantitative skills\n\nGain experience in interpreting and graphical representation of the results using different tools (e.g., Excel, SPSS)\n\nSharpen their problem-solving, critical thinking, presentation, and communication skills through writing and presenting research papers.\n\nRequired qualifications:\n\nNo experiences/courses are required.

The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) was passed in 2014 requiring municipalities with high and medium priority basins to create a management plan. SGMA requires each municipality to develop and implement Groundwater Sustainability Plans (GSPs) by 2020 or 2022 depending on basin priority. Through a collaborative stakeholder process, the creation of GSPs is expected to consider multiple local perspectives including disadvantaged communities.\n\nIn California, disadvantaged communities have often been disproportionately affected by California’s water management problems such as groundwater overdraft and pollution. New groundwater management institutions need to consider the needs of minority populations, low-income populations, and Indigenous Peoples—those most impacted by environmental and public-health concerns. This research seeks to investigate how disadvantaged communities have been included in the creation of GSPs and provide recommendations for strategies that can be used to achieve their meaningful involvement in the rule development process.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nThe student will be expected to conduct literature review to find relevant peer reviewed journal articles and government documents. Student will work to collect data from the relevant government agencies detailing stakeholder participation in the rule development process. Lastly, student will be involved in developing a coding framework to categorize stakeholder engagement. If time permits, data entry using an Excel spreadsheet will be done.\n\nThe Research Scholar will gain the following skills:\n\n1) Literature review\n\n2) Research design\n\n3) Data management\n\nPreferred experience:\n\nInterest in community sustainability and natural resources management\n\nBack to top\n\nCollege of Architecture & Environmental Design\n\nClifford\n\nBioreceptive Materials: Experimental Air Purification Systems\n\nTrudell\n\nArchitectural Details for Circular Material Economies\n\nDale Clifford\n\n(he/him/his)\n\ndtcliffo@calpoly.edu\n\nArchitecture (CAED)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nBioreceptive Materials: Experimental Air Purification Systems\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nAt 450 million years old, mosses are the oldest land plants on earth, and they have learned to adapt and thrive in a changing environment. The human act of making buildings is thousands of years old by comparison, and the field of building technology has much to learn from the natural world. This project combines the hygroscopic and air purification abilities of moss with current technological advances in digital fabrication and simulation techniques to develop prototype building façade panels that promote healthy indoor air quality for buildings.\n\nPoor indoor air quality can trigger illness, such as cardiovascular disease and asthma, and the EPA estimates that sustained inhalation of particulate matter (generally fine particles PM 2.5) is responsible for nearly 50,000 premature deaths in the US alone. As indoor air quality is primarily affected by erature, humidity, and concentration of pollutants, this project attempts to find low-cost solutions to address the fact that most building have pollutant exposure limits that exceed federal guidelines.\n\nThe research will include study of surface textures that generate favorable habitats for moss growth, prototyping full-scale façade panels that support moss growth, simulating air flow through the panels, and installing and testing the panels on the Cal Poly campus. The student assistant will be engaged in air purification and construction technology research with support from faculty (Dale Clifford) and practicing professionals.Together we will construct and test an experimental building mock-up of a low-tech air purification system. To promote knowledge exchange between academia and practice we will hold bi-weekly meetings with the Seattle office of architecture firm NBBJ to better understand professional design constraints and experimental testing protocols.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nThe student will be engaged in all stages of the project over the course of two quarters. The student researcher will:\n\n• Help identify species of moss appropriate for the study\n\n• Digitally draw parametric surfaces suitable for moss growth\n\n• Prototype surface with the CAEDs 3-axis router\n\n• Perform air flow simulations to predict benefits in indoor air quality\n\nThe scheduling phases for the project are:\n\nPhase 1 (Week 0-10) (approx. 100 hrs)\n\nIdentification and cultivation of appropriate moss species.\n\nResearch traditional and state-of-the-art techniques building technologies that support plant growth.\n\nDocument and make drawings.\n\nMake scale 3-d assembly models\n\nTeam meetings\n\nPhase 2 (Week 11-15) (approx. 50 hrs)\n\nThe scholar will become adept at research methods used by creative fields. These include an integrated process of precedent research, physical modeling, 1:1 prototyping, and validation through computational simulation. The scholar will also learn data visualization techniques to convey complex information to a public audience.\n\nPreferred qualifications:\n\nSpatial thinking, an interest in plants, experience with 3-D modeling software.\n\nBack to top\n\nCarmen Trudell\n\n(she/her/hers)\n\nctrudell@calpoly.edu\n\nArchitecture (CAED)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nArchitectural Details for Circular Material Economies\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nThe design and construction of Architecture is intertwined with natural resources at every turn, and like most post-industrial era markets, it is deeply embedded in linear economies. The linear economy can be summarized by the pithy slogan “take, make, dispose” where natural resources are extracted, turned into products, and are then discarded after they are no longer useful. In recent decades, the fragility and destructive nature of current modes of economic development can no longer be embraced as advanced or desired. Therefore, researchers in many fields are encouraging a mode of development that aligns more closely with natural systems, coined the circular economy.\n\nThis research project will use the architectural detail, or how materials are assembled to make structures, walls, floors, and roofs, as the vehicle to illustrate viable models of material circularity. This project will seek example projects from around the world to illuminate as didactic models of economies which draw resources from rapidly renewable, and up-cycled streams, and assemble them so they can be fully disassembled and reused again when no longer needed. This model of architecture obtains a high-level of building integrity (durability, water-tightness, air-tightness, thermal comfort) without non-renewable materials that construction has come to rely heavily upon such as elastomeric sealants, adhesives, and coatings. The long-term goal of this research is to present a number of exemplary projects and design thinkers through an exhibition and symposium. The next two quarters will lay the foundation for the longer-term showcases, intended for fall 2023.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nWork collaboratively with Dr. Trudell to:\n\nconduct a literature review on circularity in architecture, design for disassembly, and cradle-to-cradle assemblies.\n\ncreate a catalog of exemplary projects and identify those that the designers should be interviewed and those that should be visited.\n\ndesign interviews for the selected design teams\n\nprepare for on-site visits of selected projects including an approach to documentation of observations\n\ndevelop a method of representing the material supply-chains for the selected projects for exhibition\n\ndevelop a method of representing the architectural details indicating how the systems perform and how complete disassembly is achieved.\n\nRequired qualifications:\n\nScholars must be able to digitally draw proficiently in Rhino, Adobe Illustrator, InDesign and Photoshop. Passion about material economies and building assemblies will make this endeavor mutually enjoyable. Reliability, attention-to-detail, and ability to assertively communicate in a collaborative setting are also required.\n\nPreferred qualifications:\n\nThird-year standing as an architecture, architectural engineering, or construction management student preferred.

Those inequities are even more evident in terms of the need for and access to prosthetic devices.\n\nBelonging to one or more of the previously-mentioned underserved minority groups increases an individual's risk of amputation. For instance, African Americans and Latinxs are 4 and 1.5 times more likely to suffer an amputation than white Americans, respectively. People who suffered from limb loss need accessible rehabilitation and prosthetic devices to help them overcome their financial, psychological, and physical challenges. However, a major obstacle those patients have to overcome is the cost of prosthetics. One way to increase access to prosthetic devices and make them more affordable is using Additive Manufacturing or 3D Printing technology.\n\nThe main objective of this research project is to design a supply chain network for 3D-printed prosthetic devices to serve underserved and rural communities. The designed supply chain network will contain 3D Printing hubs that manufacture prosthetics in locations closer to those communities, resulting in more accessibility and lower costs.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nconducting a comprehensive review of literature on the following topics:\n\nAccess to healthcare in underserved and rural communities in the United States in general and California in specific;\n\nThe use of 3D Printing technology in prosthetics manufacturing;\n\nSupply Chain network design and the problem of optimally locating 3D Printing manufacturing hubs\n\nformulating a problem statement and identifying the solution methodology\n\nimplementing the solution methodology to solve the problem of the 3D-printed prosthetics’ Supply Chain network design\n\ndesigning and conducting experiments\n\ndisseminating the project outcomes through peer-reviewed conference or journal papers\n\nThe Research Scholar will accomplish the following:\n\nconduct an in-depth review of literature, synthesize information from the literature review they ran, and identify research gaps\n\nincrease their knowledge and awareness of existing healthcare inequities affecting minority groups and underserved communities in the United States, the thing that could result in less affordable access to prosthetic devices\n\npractice the use of various methods of Data Analytics to model and solve supply chain and facility location problems\n\ngain experience in conducting experiments and analyzing results\n\nenhance their presentation and communication skills through writing and presenting research papers\n\nRequired qualifications/courses:\n\nCommunication and presentation skills course\n\nBackground in Industrial, Biomedical, Materials Engineering, or a related quantitative field\n\nPassionate about engineering applications in healthcare\n\nPreferred qualifications:\n\nKnowledge in one more of the following courses: Operations Research and Optimization, Operations Management, Supply Chain Management, Simulation, and Data Analytics.\n\nBack to top\n\nJean Lee\n\n(she/her/hers)\n\njlee473@calpoly.edu\n\nMaterials Engineering (CENG)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nUniversal versus Inclusive Product Design, and their Impacts\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nBoth universal and inclusive product design aim to make a product usable and useful to as many people as possible. However, universal design is characterized by a single solution without supplements to accommodate people with different needs, whereas inclusive design engages a diverse range of people in the design process and may result in different solutions and/or solutions that can be adapted to meet each user’s needs.\n\nThis project seeks to measure the impacts of universal and inclusive product design by measuring differences in quantitative metrics such as cost, market share, manufacturer’s stock price, and environmental impact for products that have been designed using a universal approach versus an inclusive approach versus a conventional approach. Changes in semi-quantitative metrics such as user experience and manufacturer reputation will also be described for products designed a universal approach versus an inclusive approach versus a conventional approach. A deliverable from this research will be to produce one or more curated product design case studies that will be made available as a resource that can be used by faculty who wish to infuse diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) into their courses.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nThe student will identify, collect, and analyze case studies of products that have been designed using universal, inclusive, and conventional approaches. Analysis of these case studies will focus on quantifying the impacts of universal versus inclusive versus conventional product designs via metrics such as cost, market share, stock price, and environmental impact through categories such as energy use or water use. The student will also identify and characterize semi-quantitative impacts of universal versus inclusive versus conventional product design, such as user experience and the reputation of the product manufacturer.\n\nThe student researcher will gain experience in performing literature searches, conducting critical and quantitative analyses of data, considering design through a DEI lens, and technical writing.\n\nRequired qualifications/courses:\n\nSTAT 312 or STAT 321 or equivalent\n\nIME 144 or equivalent\n\nMATE 210 (preferred, not required)\n\nThe student should have excellent critical thinking and analytical skills, excellent reading comprehension and technical writing skills, and an interest in learning about DEI issues.\n\nBack to top\n\nHans Mayer\n\n(he/him/his)\n\nhmayer@calpoly.edu\n\nMechanical Engineering (CENG)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nSpin Coating of Liquids – Developing an Engineering/Physics Lab for Undergraduates\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nAn essential part of semiconductor or microscale processing is lithography (aka “photolithography”) wherein a pattern is transferred from a mask into a layer of material using light. Lithography involves the use of a light-sensitive liquid-polymer solution called a “photoresist”. Uniform layers of photoresist, often as thin as 1 um (or approximately 1/50th of a human hair thickness), are formed on substrate materials through a spin-coating process whereby a dispensed puddle of liquid is centrifugally distributed and thinned.\n\nThe thickness of the spin-coated film is often a complicated function of the rotation speed, the spin time, and the photoresist density and viscosity. For photoresists used in semiconductor processing, the viscosity can be highly dependent on polymer and solvent concentrations and can vary during the spin coating process because of solvent evaporation. Because of the time- and speed-varying liquid properties, predictions of spin coating thickness can be quite complicated and often ‘recipes’ are developed and used. In contrast, the spin coating of Newtonian liquids (constant-viscosity liquids) can be captured through solutions to equations accessible to an undergraduate audience.\n\nRecently, the lack of domestic semiconductor processing capability has been recognized as a serious problem not only from a supply chain standpoint but from a national security standpoint. Thus, there has been a recent spotlight on bringing much of this type of manufacturing back to the United States. To meet these new manufacturing demands, the US educational system must train a growing number of students and get them interested in semiconductor processing. As part of this effort to draw attention to this field, the PI proposes a BEACoN project in which a student will help to develop and implement a laboratory experiment, targeted for an undergraduate engineering/physics audience, in which students can gain insight into the phenomenon of spin coating.\n\nThe goal of the project is to devise a set of experiments in which students compare the results of theory to measurements of spin coating thickness that shed light on the role of relevant variables in addition to probing the applicability of simplifying assumptions used in the development of theoretical models (for example, lack of importance of the initial puddle of dispensed resist). The design of the experiments will be transferrable to other labs/schools. The result of the project will be a peer-reviewed journal article in which this experiment can be shared with other university professors, and an enhanced appreciation for one of the many interesting aspects of semiconductor processing.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nThe BEACoN Research Scholar involved in this project will be an integral part of a small team of Mechanical Engineering undergraduate students who are all working toward the goal of investigating the “first bubble” event associated with the emptying of inverted single-outlet vessels (i.e., bottles) as described in the project description. As part of this team, the Scholar will be involved in both group and individual tasks (working closely with the mentor during weekly meetings and with other students outside of meeting times), and the degree of involvement in these tasks will be consistent with the 100 hr/quarter time commitment. Complexity of tasks will build as the project progresses.\n\nSpecific tasks will include the following:\n\n> Performing a literature review to (1) understand some of the basic theory behind the spin coating of Newtonian fluids (to a level appropriate for an undergraduate audience), (2) to develop an understanding of the role that non-Newtonian fluid behavior plays on spin coating – to more directly relate to semiconductor processing (e.g., photolithography), (3) develop an understanding of the typical tools used to measure film thickness (optical tools) so that they can contrast that with available tools and equipment at Cal Poly, and (4) determine the appropriate length, depth, and style of articles published in the American Journal of Physics.\n\n> Design a set of experiments to measure film thickness of spin coated Newtonian fluids using: a mass balance (to obtain average film thickness from a gravimetric analysis), a spectral reflectometer (available in the teaching cleanroom to be used for comparative measurements), and potentially a custom-built apparatus that can be implemented in a university lab setting (made from optical components). These experiments will probe the relationships between variables that appear in the theoretical models of spin coating, and include those that do not appear to demonstrate their lack of importance (e.g., substrate diameter). The design of these experiments will explore the use of digital imaging to capture stages of the spin coating process.\n\n> If necessary, modify existing equipment (e.g., a un-used spin coating from the teaching cleanroom) for the project based on the design of experiments. This will be done under the supervision of the PI and will use PI professional development funds. The Mustang 60 and Aero Hangar machine shops will be used for fabricating parts.\n\n> Perform experiments, record results manually and electronically (using spreadsheets, data files, images/movie files, etc.), and maintain the experimental equipment to ensure safe operation.\n\n> Work on preparing a draft manuscript for the American Journal of Physics. The audience for this journal is college-level physics and engineering educators and the articles generally describe projects that can be accomplished in university labs. The student will prepare an outline at the start of Spring, and work through Spring (while finishing experiments) to create a full draft including all figures and tables. The student and PI will submit the article at the end of Spring quarter 2023.\n\nThe skills and experiences gained by the BEACoN Research Scholar will be those typically acquired during the course of an experimental research program.\n\nSpecific to this project, by the end of the program the Scholar will have:\n\n> Gained knowledge and experience related to the planning and development of a set of systematic experiments including sourcing/developing equipment and procedures necessary to collect publication-quality data. This will include design and fabrication of some parts of the needed apparatus, and in-lab time working with equipment to collect data.\n\n> Gained practical skills working with various lab equipment including precision mass balances, optical equipment (both commercially available and custom-built from components), cameras, and a commercial grade spin coater. Some lab time will be spent in the Cal Poly Microfabrication Laboratory so student will acquire practical experience in a cleanroom environment.\n\n> Further development of theoretical fluid dynamics skills by working through published models for spin coating (e.g., re-deriving classic results). Further development of experimental analysis skills including statistical analysis of experimental data.\n\n> Student will acquire technical writing experience by generating the draft of a journal article. This writing experience will include creating high-quality figures (based on photographs, data, etc.).\n\n> Student will be invited to attend the SoCal Fluids Conference in April 2023 to see graduate-level research from other R1 institutions in the Southern California area. Although this isn’t necessarily a “skill”, experiencing a conference environment and seeing how other students present their research (and the style they use for slides and visuals) can be very informative for an early researcher. This travel will be paid by the PI.\n\nRequired qualifications:\n\nThe BEACoN Research Scholar selected for this project is required to have taken ME 341 (Fluid Mechanics I), or an acceptable course substitute, given the emphasis on fluid dynamics. If the interested Scholar is not an ME major, please provide evidence of coursework that would have covered fundamentals of fluid dynamics or a physics-based course in which differential equations are used to describe/calculate field equations. In addition, the BEACoN Research Scholar should have taken one laboratory-based course where they have had to keep a laboratory notebook, or document their work. It is also essential that the Scholar have an attention for detail.\n\nPreferred qualifications:\n\nIt would be preferable for a BEACoN Research Scholar to have some background in working with Excel and MATLAB (or Phython) for the experimental analysis part of the project. This could be gained through basic coursework (or in a CS/ME/PHYS class for the MATLAB or Python aspect). It would also be preferable, but not necessary, to have some basic hands-on laboratory and/or machine-shop experience (“red tag” level would be great – otherwise this could be thought of as added to the ‘skills’ that the student would acquire).\n\nBack to top\n\nTheresa Migler\n\n(she/her/hers)\n\ntmigler@calpoly.edu\n\nComputer Science and Software Engineering (CENG)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nAcademic Collaboration Network with an Eye Towards Gender and Ethnicity\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nThe Academic Collaboration Network with an Eye Towards Gender and Ethnicity research project is part of an ongoing effort to explore patterns of collaboration at public universities in California.

Over the past few years they have evolved from devices that could only filter the EM fields, to surfaces that can manipulate the EM fields at a macroscopic level. EM metasurfaces have unit-cells with sub-wavelength dimensions that can change the properties of EM waves to synthesize a desired distribution of EM fields in the near-field or far-field of their aperture. One the algorithmic side, one challenge is to understand how the metasurface has to be synthesized in order to create the desired EM fields. A promising solution to this problem is by using intelligent search methods such as evolutionary algorithms.\n\nThis project aims to use the functionalities of electromagnetic metasurfaces, and provide a solution to wireless connectivity in rural and under-served areas by synthesizing an EM response that provides optimal wireless coverage.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nThe project aims to create a computational model to analyze the information throughput to an area by studying the beamforming properties of the metasurface. To this end, the student will:\n\nCreate a computational model that calculates the reflected radiation pattern of an electromagnetic plane wave that impinges on the metasurface. The mentor will help the student gain a solid understanding of the model that has been developed, and code it in Matlab.\n\nNext, the student will implement an intelligent approach (evolutionary optimization) to determine the optimal reflection coefficient of the metasurface aperture, to maximize directivity, and in turn, information throughput of the system in an unbounded medium.\n\nIn the final stage, the student will use the codes developed to compute the information throughput of representative rural and urban-underserved areas through case studies, and provide a systematic analysis of the enhancement made in terms of wireless connectivity.\n\nResearch Scholar will gain skills and experience in:\n\nComputational modeling\n\nEvolutionary optimization\n\nSystem modeling and qualitative analysis of performance\n\nStrong proficiency with Matlab\n\nFundamental understanding of electromagnetic metasurfaces\n\nRequired qualifications:\n\nGood familiarity with Matlab, and programming in general\n\nPreferred qualifications:\n\nProficiency with Matlab\n\nBasic knowledge of electromagnetic waves\n\nBack to top\n\nLynne Slivovsky\n\n(she/her/hers)\n\nlslivovs@calpoly.edu\n\nComputer Engineering (CENG)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nUnderstanding Student Experiences Through Trauma-Informed and Intersectional Lenses\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nThis project reimagines how we conduct research and the ways in which we care for the well-being of our participants. Ratios and statistics without context can mask issues such as the student experience within a department and persistence rates within a major. As we aspire to address these issues and others, we engage with students to formally characterize the current culture of the Computer Engineering (CPE) department by learning about student experiences within the department. The goal of this engagement is to understand if/how harm is perpetuated towards students, particularly marginalized students who do not fit normative social constructions of identities like gender, race, sexuality, socioeconomic class, and ability. While centering marginalized student voices is critical when enacting change, we as researchers want to ensure we are not perpetuating harm in the ways we conduct research and engage with students.\n\nResearch methodologies that require participants to disclose personal experience often do not take into account possible trauma in those experiences and how those disclosures can perpetuate harm towards participants. Understanding potential student trauma through an intersectional lens, as in relation to structural and systemic oppression, is the foundation of our protocol used to inquire about the student experience and is particularly critical when marginalized peoples are disclosing their experiences. Our work is grounded in the Design Justice Principles outlined by the Design Justice Network and incorporates the values of Participatory Action Research. These foundational values center the care and well-being of participants. We will use this methodology to conduct interviews and focus groups with students about their experiences within the department. The data and analysis yielded from this protocol will inform the CPE department’s efforts in developing interventions and resources to better support students and create a culture and community of diversity and belonging.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nThe BEACoN Research Scholar will join an active engineering education research group with professors Lynne Slivovsky (CPE), Liz Thompson (GENE/IME), and Jane Lehr (ES/WGQS) and Cal Poly undergraduate/alumni researchers. They will gain experience in research methods and design, interview protocols, qualitative analysis, communication skills, and research paper writing. They will:\n\nLearn about our research methodology and the IRB process\n\nParticipate in a literature review\n\nConduct student interviews and/or focus groups\n\nDevelop qualitative data analysis skills\n\nContribute to research team meetings and meeting facilitation\n\nCo-author conference papers and journal articles\n\nThis project will be an exceptional opportunity for a BEACoN Research Scholar to gain expertise in engineering education research. Anticipated skills our mentee will gain are related to: research methods and design, interviewing and conducting interviews and focus groups, qualitative and quantitative analysis, data presentation and data management, and written and oral communication. They will have the opportunity to develop skills and capacities related to leadership, self-efficacy, knowledge of personal strengths and assets, and confidence in their future career plans. Aspirationally, we hope to be able to support them to attend and present their work at an engineering education conference.\n\nRequired qualifications:\n\nStudents with experience (through coursework or other training/experience) in either statistics/quantitative data analysis OR qualitative data analysis\n\nPreferred qualifications:\n\nStudents with interest in both quantitative and qualitative research methods.\n\nInterest and prior experience with perspectives and frameworks utilized in areas including Science & Technology Studies, Ethnic Studies, Women’s, Gender & Queer studies, or related areas.

They are emerging multifunctional electronic components providing tremendous novel opportunities for advancing a plethora of applications, such as healthcare, structural health monitoring, and robotics. Among the unique properties of nanocomposites, strain sensitivity (i.e., piezoresistive effect) has been commonly observed. While various strain-sensing nanocomposites have been developed using different manufacturing techniques, it still remains challenging to efficiently design the sensing performance of the complex nanocomposite material systems.\n\nThis project aims to investigate the effects of 2D and 3D structural design on the strain sensing performance of nanocomposites. Here, the nanocomposite ink will be developed based on Dr. Wang’s research group’s formulation, using carbon nanotubes, graphene, and polymers. The nanocomposite ink will be integrated with different 2D and 3D structures, which will be obtained via laser cutting and stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing. A series of mechanical and electrical experiments will be conducted to characterize the mechanical and sensing performance of the nanocomposite structures.

Since that time, that number of states has grown to 30, including 18 online, and a proposition will be voted on in California in a few weeks (Prop 27). The above quote was made in response to the explosion of individuals reporting addictive behavior related to sports from 3% before 2018 to 17% today (Kafka, 2022, Vox). During this time, sports gambling has similarly exploded as a business, from $310M in bets placed in 2018 to $7B today (O’Brien & He, 2021, Bloomberg), suggesting there is a clear incentive structure in place for companies to continue expanding this market. Yet, despite the rapid increase in this behavior, very little research has been performed to understand what gives rise to sports gambling behaviors and how it may heighten or alter the experience for the gambler.\n\nIn a prior study, Antony et al. (2021) showed that one important factor – surprise – could explain numerous behavioral, physiological, and neural factors related to sports viewing. These factors included game enjoyment, memory, pupil dilation, and brain responses (as measured using functional MRIs) related to the release of dopamine. One novelty of this study was that we quantified surprise by using advanced data analytics, which allowed for finding the probability of each team in a basketball game winning at each moment in time. Surprise was then considered to be the change in this probability from one moment to the next.\n\nSurprise is clearly critical to the sports viewing experience, but we do not only react to changes in a game – we also anticipate them. In other words, we know intuitively when a big moment in a game is approaching, and we can call this feeling suspense (Ely et al., 2015). If surprise reflects the difference from the prior moment to the current one, suspense reflects the anticipated difference from the current moment to the future. Just as one can calculate surprise, one can also calculate suspense to investigate the variance in upcoming win probability values from historical games in similar situations. For example, just as one might guess from their experience watching basketball games, this measure is also maximal when the score is close near the end of the game. How this measure of suspense predicts engagement is unknown, and how it may affect the viewer’s experience when there is an extra-game interest in the outcome (like a bet) is also unknown.\n\nThe first focus of this project involves validating this measure of suspense – behaviorally, physiologically, and neurally – while subjects watch the last 5 minutes of 9 different NCAA basketball games. Behaviorally, we will correlate our derived level of suspense with subjects’ ratings of suspense at each moment of the basketball games. Physiologically and neurally, we will ask whether suspense correlates with well-known signatures of attention such as increased pupil dilation and decreased EEG power between 8-12 Hz (or alpha power); this involves placing electrodes on participants’ scalps to measure brain activity.\n\nThe second focus of the project involves investigating how bets placed on the games affect these measures. Throughout the game clips, we will have subjects bet on whether a team will score between 6-10 times, and we will ask them to try to earn the most money to make the outcome motivationally relevant. Together, this will help us understand how suspense and sports betting alter brain activity.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nReading relevant literature and discussing it with me in our weekly meetings (in addition to discussing professional development topics), as to give them a strong overview of the prior work motivating this project;\n\ndata collection, including being present when the subjects watch the basketball clips; this involves scheduling time slots using Sona participant software (via the Department of Psychology and Child Development), sending reminder emails, giving participants instructions, facilitating questionnaires and the computer program used to run the study;\n\ndata organization & entry;\n\nanalyzing the data, including learning how to program to code how our quantification of suspense aligns with subject ratings and how bets affect behavioral, physiological, and neural measurements;\n\npresenting the data at the year-end BEACoN symposium;\n\nsubmitting an abstract for a poster presentation at a professional conference (should they be interested; this may occur after BEACoN concludes);\n\npotentially work on drafting a manuscript for publication (pending results; this may occur after BEACoN concludes).\n\nThe scholar will gain skills in psychological research methods, data entry and management, and computer programming (see more detail in the above question). These skills are integral in preparing them for graduate school and a variety of careers. For instance, should the BEACoN Research Scholar not continue into academia, knowing how to program will very much open doors immediately upon graduating. Additionally, they will gain skills in thinking critically about psychological theories and how to infuse data analysis with inferences we can make about the mind. They will learn how to ask and answer questions, and communicate this information in a way that applies to daily life and across disciplines. Lastly, students will gain experience writing and abstract and creating and presenting a poster, both for the BEACoN Research Symposium and a professional psychology conference.\n\nRequired qualifications/coursework:\n\nStrong time management and organizational skills; eagerness to learn; an interest in memory.\n\nPreferred qualifications/coursework:\n\nPrior coding experience is preferred. Also, given that our stimuli will be basketball games, an interest in basketball is desired. Lastly, the BEACoN Scholar would ideally have some knowledge of psychology (e.g., PSY 201/202, General Psychology, or AP Psychology from high school). Other preferred courses include Cognition (PSY 357), Cognitive Neuroscience (PSY 480), Memory (PSY 440), and Neuroscience (offered in CSM).\n\nBack to top\n\nDarrian Carroll\n\n(he/him/his)\n\ndrcarrol@calpoly.edu\n\nCommunication Studies (CLA)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nRacial Reverberations: Resistance for Voting Rights in the Rhetoric of Fannie Lou Hamer and Stacey Abrams\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nThis project aims to aid scholars and activists by investigating strategies Black people have used to attain and protect their right to vote. Throughout the history of struggling toward freedom in the US, Black people have faced issues that sustain and become systematic. One instance of systemic inequality faced by many Black people is the denial of their right to participate in free in fair elections. By turning back to the rhetoric of Fannie Lou Hamer and Stacey Abrams this project aims to unveil the similar argumentative strategies utilized by both women, “racial reverberations,” as they argued for something that continues to be a freedom deferred in our time: the right to vote.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nIn this project, the BEACoN Research scholar will collect information about and organize speeches by Fannie Lou Hamer and Stacey Abrams. After the speeches have been collected, the research scholar will summarize the speeches and organize them in a way that is easily accessible and searchable. Lastly, the Research Scholar would be asked to collect and organize historical information about Fannie Lou Hamer and Stacey Abrams.\n\nWhile working with this project, BEACoN Research Scholars can anticipate developing research skills, data management tactics, and an ability to practice critical analysis. I aim to direct Research Scholars in methods of collecting speeches and historical data. Throughout this project, Research Scholars will gain an ability to assess, collect, and analyze texts. It is my hope that by the end of the project Research Scholars will have improved their ability to do their own independent research.\n\nRequired qualifications:\n\nNo courses or previous experience is required for this position.\n\nPreferred qualifications/coursework:\n\nIdeally, the research scholar would have an interest in Black history and experience doing literary or rhetorical analysis. Moreover, ideally a Research Scholar would have experience working with archives or analyzing political campaigns.\n\nBack to top\n\nAshley Clemons\n\n(she/they)\n\nadclemon@calpoly.edu\n\nEnglish (CLA)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nKeepin’ It 313: A Women’s History of Contemporary Black Music and Art in Detroit\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nDetroit, Michigan, has been considered the “Paris of the Midwest” and the “Harlem of the Midwest.” However, for native Detroiters, this place is the Motor City, Motown, or simply, the “D.” Detroit’s Black communities are often misrepresented even as they have historically created the city’s aesthetic. Currently, there is a sort of Detroit En Vogue moment occurring in the mainstream, an increasing interest in telling Detroit’s stories. In her first book, Darkly: Black History and America’s Gothic Soul, fellow Detroit-native Leila Taylor argues, “There is no established literary genre of Northeast or Midwest Gothic, but there could be. Every county has its own macabre genius loci, every city its seedy underbelly.” As Taylor puts it, Black writers and artists are doing the work to retain and reimagine the relentless pains cloaked in spaces previously marketed as northern utopias. Many scholars discuss place and region-specific issues through writers in the cannon, such as T.S. Eliot, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and William Faulkner. Although few studies consider Detroit, much potential lies in studying Black music and arts in this city, particularly the contributions of Black women cultural producers as they confront racial and gendered displacements in deindustrialized America.\n\nKeepin’ It 313: A Women’s History of Contemporary Black Music and Art in Detroit argues that Detroit’s contemporary Black music, media power, literature, and cultural production establish a collective aesthetic that captures lived and reimagined experiences beyond the city’s ruin. I position Detroit as a signpost for experiences in other prominent Black towns across the United States facing major redevelopment following pervasive destruction, such as Post-Katrina New Orleans, Louisiana, and current-day Harlem, New York. Additionally, creators from these other struggling Black cities are taking up the work of bringing to the forefront Black Detroit’s stories. I draw from Detroit and Black feminist epistemologies to investigate how the city’s Black cultural aesthetic retains erased and overlooked histories. Also, I provide a much-needed, critical discourse that underscores Black labor and cultural identity. I look at ghosts as unending and ongoing in terms of liminal spaces. Broadly, my project answers—How do Black women writers and cultural producers tell us about the effects of racist systems that render Black bodies fungible in Detroit? How do Black women cultural producers, as griots, inject and celebrate the unretained stories of the abandoned? What does the art and music history tell us about Black Detroiters’ positionalities in the United States? How is Detroit as a stage or performative space lends a critical lens about mainstream’s discursive narratives?\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nResearch scholar would be expected to create a \"state of the field,\" a detailed summary of recent scholarship within the fields of African American literature and Detroit cultural production; two film reviews; and 1-2 book reviews.\n\nResearch scholar will gain the following skills:\n\nBasic research methods, qualitative research and analysis, data collection/ organization, conference presentation (submitting to CFP), and publication process.\n\nRequired qualifications:\n\nAbove average outcomes in ENGL 347:African American Literature\n\nStrong interest in Black women writers and cultural producers who write about Detroit, MI\n\nBackground knowledge on Black literary and cultural theories\n\nPreferred qualifications/coursework:\n\nExtensive knowledge on Toni Morrison's body of work\n\nBackground in social justice work or working with marginalized BIPOC groups\n\nResearch interest in former Black towns\n\nBasic knowledge in critical analysis and Black literary research\n\nResearch interest in Black playwrights.\n\nBack to top\n\nNikhil Deb\n\n(he/him/his)\n\nndeb@calpoly.edu\n\nSocial Sciences (CLA)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nAdaptation by Dispossession? Neoliberalism and Climate Change in the Global South\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nThis project attempts to analyze the ways in which economic and development activities in southern coastal Bangladesh, an area exceptionally vulnerable to and an experimental laboratory of climate change, reproduce the vulnerabilities of local communities by dispossessing them from the land to which they belong or are entitled. While climate change poses grave threats to the well-being of many marginalized populations worldwide, it also offers the opportunity to rethink our business-as-usual activities. To that end, what is required is a wide-ranging understanding of climate change grounded in the needs of the people who will likely bear the brunt of the climate crisis in places such as southern coastal Bangladesh.\n\nThis project will demonstrate how current institutionalized adaptation activities in the southern part of Bangladesh not only naturalize dispossession (what I call “adaptation by dispossession”) but also undermine local and everyday adaptation practices in the region. This project instead advocates for what climate justice scholars call “transformational adaptation,” a long-term process that aims to forge more fundamental and systemic change and thus focuses on redistributing power. The research is part of a multi-year book project on climate and neoliberalism in Bangladesh.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nThe primary responsibility of the BEACoN Scholar entails (1) collecting relevant peer-reviewed research papers; (2) preparing an annotated bibliography or literature review; (3) brainstorming ideas to reimagie the politics required for climate justice in the global South; (4) and perhaps preparing a collaborative paper for a conference presentation.\n\nThe BEACoN Research Scholar will be able to gain multiple skills after completing this project. First, the student scholar will grasp the approach, method, analysis required to write a good literature review and address the “so what” question in research. Second, by delving into relevant materials, the student scholar will understand the importance of connecting global political and economic dynamics with local sociohistorical and ecological realities to formulate a well-informed climate justice analysis. Third, the student will use imagination to link many long-term and short-term adverse consequences of top-down adaptation activities that relegate land-dependent communities to poverty and hunger. Fourth, the student scholar will understand potential alternatives to business-as-usual to forge a global climate justice agenda. Finally, the BEACoN Research Scholar will gain the skill of preparing and delivering a conference presentation.\n\nPreferred qualifications:\n\nIt would be a strength if the BEACoN Research Scholar likes to read, analyze, and write. And interest in the global South would be an exciting plus.\n\nBack to top\n\nG. Andrew Fricker\n\n(he/him/his)\n\nafricker@calpoly.edu\n\nSocial Sciences (CLA)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nMapping Social Justice in Space and Time\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nSocial justice, demographics and populations of people are highly structured in space and time. Populations of people live and migrate from place to place based on a complex array of push and pull factors. Understanding the spatial structure and Temporal dynamics of change are critical to understanding social justice and the environmental pressures that face marginalized populations. This research project aims to explore and examine social justice through the lens of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The BEACoN research scholar will learn how to analyze spatial GIS data and map social justice topics. The BEACoN scholar will have considerable leeway in choosing which aspect of 'social justice' they wish to map depending on their background, specific interests in case studies, marginalized populations, environmental stressors, and social movements. The topic of the research is left intentionally vague, so the BEACoN scholar can choose the social justice topic they want to research and map. The mentor will help guide the scholar towards realistic research questions, explore data, teach spatial tools and provide mentorship.\n\nThe following are a few hypothetical examples of research questions a BEACoN scholar could ask:\n\nWhat were the spatio-temporal dynamics of the Black Lives Matter protests, and what were the underlying demographic trends in these areas?\n\nWhich ethnic communities were most impacted by the COVID19 pandemic?\n\nHow did political pressure and economic opportunity in the last two decades influence migration from Mexico and Central America?\n\nWhat is the spatial relationship between toxic waste facilities, pollution and marginalized communities in CA?\n\nThe questions above are just a starting point for a conversation between the scholar and mentor to explore subjects relating to social justice, and can be expanded upon depending on the scholar's interests. The scholar can pick the aspect of social justice they want to map, and the mentor will teach the data analysis/GIS skills and guide the scholar through the scientific process. In person participation is encouraged, but not required.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nWithin the broad topic of 'social justice', the BEACoN scholar will be central to choosing the topic of the research itself. The scholar will be expected to come up with a research proposal on which aspect of 'social justice' they want to study, inlcuding the who, what, when and most importantly, where? After the scholar and mentor have settled on a set of research questions, the scholar will be expected to do an extensive 'data dig' to collect, and organize spatial and non-spatial data on the choosen topic. The scholar will need to take some basic coursework/tutorials in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to learn the basic skills of spatial analysis, which they will apply directly to answering the research question(s). Finally, the scholar will be expected to write up their results into a publishable manuscript and conference presentation to showcase their research.\n\nThe scholar will gain data search and management skills, basic statistical analysis and most importantly Geographic Information Systems (GIS). It's also possible the scholar can gain skills in remote sensing and field work depending on the research topic. The research scholar will be taught to 'think spatially' and to visualize data in maps, graphs, charts and tables. The scholar will also gain skills in literature review, manuscript preparation, research presentations and the peer-review process.\n\nRequired Qualifications/Coursework:\n\nThe scholar must have basic data literacy, and familiarity with GIS. At a minimum the research scholar must take a course in statistics and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as NR218/GEOG 218 or the community college equivalent.\n\nPreferred Qualifications/Coursework:\n\nAdditional courses in statistics, remote sensing, computer science, research methods, sociology, ethnic and gender studies are preferred but not required.\n\nBack to top\n\nLeanne Giordono\n\n(she/her/hers)\n\nlgiordon@calpoly.edu\n\nPolitical Science (CLA)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nThe Role of the Safety Net After Extreme Weather Events: A Scoping Review\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nExtreme weather events are expected to increase in the frequency and severity in the upcoming decade (Allen et al., 2018). Vulnerability to the impacts of climate change is expected to be higher in areas and among populations that experience high poverty and other barriers to inclusion and prosperity (Hallegatte et al., 2020; International Panel on Climate Change, 2022). In the United States, vulnerability to natural disasters among low-income individuals and families tends to be associated with place and type of residence, building construction and social exclusion (Fothergill & Peek, 2004).\n\nRecent survey findings by Zanocco et al. (2022) indicate that individuals who reported the highest native impacts from extreme weather are almost twice as likely to live in a low-income household. Evidence suggests that strong social safety nets increase resilience to climate change, especially when integrated with other efforts to build resilience and adapt to the growing risks of climate change (International Panel on Climate Change, 2022). Almost a decade ago, Gough (2013) identified these new risks as one of the primary challenges to social policy. More recently, Tenzing (2020) identified a global “social protection” approach intended to address issues of inequality and marginalization in the context of climate change.\n\nWhile the traditional safety net in the United States is distinct from disaster-related assistance responses, such as those provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), there is evidence that disaster-oriented programs may not fully meet the needs of individuals in poverty due in part to procedural inequities (Domingue & Emrich, 2019). Moreover, some research suggests that traditional safety net functions play an important post-event role, supplementing the resources received from disaster-related assistance sources (Deryugina, 2017).\n\nSeveral recent literature reviews (e.g., Brügger, 2020; Giordono et al., 2021; Howe, 2021) provide evidence of growing attention by scholars to the potential for extreme events to influence public beliefs and attitudes toward climate change, climate-oriented behaviors, and related mitigation and adaptation policies, with mixed results. However, there is little information about the degree to which extreme events have elicited changes to traditional safety net programs (e.g., those that provide food, housing, energy, and income assistance to low-income and vulnerable populations) in order to identify and address risks associated with a changing climate, and/or integrate with traditional emergency response and related resilience-building initiatives.\n\nThis project will use scoping review methods to map the body of literature where policy responses to extreme events converge with social policy and safety net programs targeting low-income and vulnerable populations. To the degree possible, the review will yield implications for policymakers and researchers.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nThe BEACoN scholar will assist with all tasks related to performing a scoping literature review, including: 1) developing and executing search queries; 2) organizing and categorizing search query results; 3) reviewing, analyzing and synthesizing the results from scholarly articles; 4) compiling an organized argument about the body of research resulting from analysis; 5) preparing a manuscript for peer-review; and 6) assisting with the publication submission and review process.\n\nNote: the last tasks in this list will depend on student interest and the productivity of the project. The scholar may take the lead on selected tasks, depending on interest and capacity.\n\nThe BEACoN scholar will gain skills related to performing a scoping literature review, including searching for and accessing new information; developing systems for storing and cataloguing research materials; analyzing and synthesizing research findings; and writing and presenting findings.\n\nRequired Qualifications/Coursework:\n\nInterest and/or experience with any of the following substantive areas: social policy and safety programs (e.g., food, housing, energy, income assistance) aimed at low-income and vulnerable populations; disaster and emergency management policy and programs; and/or climate change policy and programs.\n\nPreferred Qualifications/Coursework:\n\nExperience and broad knowledge of public policy, demonstrated by current or previous attendance (and good performance in) POLS 351 Intro to Public Policy and Administration are required. The BEACoN scholar should also have a keen interest and willingness to explore new and complex policy problems, as well as evidence of an ability to take initiative and make decisions independently.\n\nBack to top\n\nLydia Heberling & Becca Lucas\n\n(she/her/hers) - (she/her/hers)\n\nlheberli@calpoly.edu - relucas@calpoly.edu\n\nEthnic Studies (CLA)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nCounter-Mapping as Decolonization: Creating an Indigenous Walking Tour of Cal Poly's Campus\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nThe goal of this project is to produce an Indigenous Walking Tour of the Cal Poly campus that can be used by a diverse range of campus and community groups. Producing an Indigenous tour of the Cal Poly campus expands on the practice of the land acknowledgment by employing the tools of counter-mapping and Indigenous research methods to center Indigenous presence in our everyday lives. An Indigenous Walking Tour would map the Cal Poly campus by places, artworks, plants, names, and histories central to the yak titʸu titʸu yak tiłhini Northern Chumash Tribe. By creating this walking tour we will make visible, amplify, and celebrate living Indigenous traditions and knowledges. Cal Poly SLO sits on the traditional and unceded lands of the yak titʸu titʸu yak tiłhini peoples in a city established through the process of Spanish missionization of California Indian peoples in the 18th and 19th centuries. This project is one way we can contribute to the creation of better stories that un-erase California Indian and American Indian peoples in our local communities.\n\nCounter-mapping is a process of cartography that challenges the dominant views of the world. It can allow for marginalized voices to communicate their stories and reveal histories of their land. Counter-mapping creates multiple ways of knowing places and lands through diverse cartographic practices. This project is inspired by the University of Washington Indigenous Walking Tour, created by UW alum, Owen Oliver (Quinault and Isleta Pueblo). This project is secondarily inspired by the A Peoples’ History of UW digital map, created by a collective of University of Washington students who are allies and community members.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nThis project intends to hire 2 research scholars with tailored focuses:\n\nDr. Heberling's student mentee will have the opportunity to learn about counter-mapping as a research methodology and construct a literature review of counter-mapping projects and how they work. The student will then work with the faculty adviser to identify campus sites that fit the criteria for creating counter-narratives. Lastly, the student will have the opportunity to identify campus offices and entities who would benefit from participating in an Indigenous Walking Tour and test run the tour with at least one of these groups.\n\nDr. Lucas' student mentee will have the opportunity to develop research skills in Indigenous studies and dive deep into the local land and peoples history by working with a Tribal member of the yak titʸu titʸu yak tiłhini Northern Chumash Tribe. Additionally, this student will develop knowledge around ethnographic protocols while working with Indigenous communities, which will culminate in developing an IRB proposal. Finally, the student will create promotional material and outline communications strategy to promote the tour.\n\nBoth of the student mentees will learn foundational concepts in Indigenous research methods; how to engage with and create a critical cartography; how to create an IRB proposal; and how to engage in research according to and in relationship with tribal communities and their protocols.\n\nRequired Qualifications/Coursework:\n\nAt least one Ethnic Studies course or course where the students have learned a foundational understanding of settler colonialism, critical race, and/or Indigenous studies, such as (but not limited to) ES 253: Introduction to American Indian Studies.\n\nPreferred Qualifications/Coursework:\n\nIt would be ideal, but not required, if the students have taken ES/NR 360, “Ethnicity and the Land.” It is preferred that the students have an interest in decolonial geographies and spatial mapping and an understanding of California’s settler colonial history. A preference for students who have a demonstrated understanding of or relationship with Indigenous communities.\n\nBack to top\n\nNicole Jacobs\n\n(she/her/hers)\n\nnjacobs@calpoly.edu\n\nEnglish (CLA)\n\nResearch project Title:\n\nWhat Do Students Want and Need in a Disability Cultural Program?\n\nResearch Project Description:\n\nWhat are the critical components to designing both a space and a mission that is fully accessible to students at Cal Poly? During a successful BEACoN mentorship project last year, we developed a Disability Cultural Program proposal in collaboration with the students of the Disability Alliance. This year, I will work with a mentee to solicit both quantitative and qualitative feedback from the campus community about the priorities for a disability cultural program and space. In other words, how can Cal Poly students with disabilities build community, foster solidarity, and access additional resources to promote student success through a DCP? This project will examine the ways in which an inclusive and accessible meeting space and program for students could contribute to improving student experience and campus climate by forging community and solidarity.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nThe student mentee will engage in two distinct tasks: 1) help to develop, distribute, and interpret surveys on student, faculty, and staff priorities in developing a DCP and 2) conduct an audit of funding opportunities and collaborate on developing materials for grant writing.\n\nThe reserach scholar will gain skills in methods, data collection and management, and an introduction to grant writing.\n\nRequired Qualifications/Coursework:\n\nThe only requirement for this project is competent writing skills and willingness to learn about the social and political impact and implications of disability.\n\nPreferred Qualifications/Coursework:\n\nPreference will be given to students who have some working knowledge of disability justice and/or Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.

This project will explore the social and ethical implications of this area of research and examine its impacts for understandings and experiences of health. Examples of early-life adversity include child abuse and neglect, exposure to violence, and economic hardship - all of which are significantly shaped by race, class, gender, and other social conditions.\n\nAs a sociologist of health, science, and medicine, I am interested in whether and to what extent research on early-life adversity engages and addresses systemic forms of oppression and what forms of social change it imagines and makes possible. This project will examine these key questions through a critical analysis of peer-reviewed studies related to early-life adversity, in-depth interviews with parents, pediatricians, policymakers, scientists and advocates, and content analysis of media and news stories from recent years.\n\nBEACoN Research Scholar's role in project:\n\nThe BEACoN Research Scholar for this project will work with Dr. Lappé to gather and review key studies related to early-life adversity, collect and organize peer-reviewed publications on the topic, and create an annotated bibliography addressing key themes and issues in that literature. In addition, and based in part on the skills they bring to the project, the BEACoN Research Scholar may also review media related to early-life adversity and conduct a content analysis of key themes in news stories and other resources from recent years.
