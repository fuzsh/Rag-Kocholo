        "text": "I can name three unique problems that limit a teacher’s overall effectiveness.\n\nProblem #1 (Compartmentalized vs. Interdisciplinary Approach)\n\nElementary teachers are often mandated to teach each subject in isolation. There are the usual daily 90 minutes Math block, 120 minutes ELA block and the leftover time is for Science, Social Studies, and everything else like nutrition, moral and career education. In Pennsylvania, elementary teachers (from 3rd to 8th Grades) are held accountable for how their students perform in the Math and ELA standardized tests. 4th Grade and 8th Grade teachers are responsible for the Science test scores. For young children, this compartmentalized approach in separating each subject in different time blocks has more negative than positive impacts on how students view, evaluate and connect knowledge to the real world. It also underestimates the potentials of the human brain to develop and make complex connections based on unifying concepts. While teachers are getting an increased amount of curriculum responsibilities year after year, the school hours stay the same, forcing teachers to have to do more with less time. One effective solution is the word “integration.”\n\nI believe origami can be a unique engine to integrate the teaching of science, technology, reading & writing, engineering, art, and math (STREAM) to save time as well as to blend these interdisciplinary subjects to better serve student learning. I agreed that no one but maybe a handful of people on Earth are good at everything. However, I also believe our educational system at the elementary levels can nurture children to acquire multiple intelligences by exposing them to as many transferrable skills as possible. Furthermore, the more I can connect my students with as many subjects in their learning, the more creative I become and the more creative they become. When I am teaching science and math, I also teach reading, writing, speaking and listening. It’s time to break down these “subject siloes.”\n\nIn recent years, Finland, often considered as a global education leader, has shifted from the “traditional teaching by subjects” system to focus on “teaching by topics or themes.” Some called it “phenomenon” teaching. Because lessons in Science are revisited and reinforced by activities in Math, ELA and Art, students have more opportunities to be able to comprehend, retain, and assimilate difficult concepts. In higher education, online websites like Coursera is working with the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in offering courses to explore Art & Idea with themes like Places & Spaces, Art & Identity, Transforming Everyday Objects, and Art & Society. In addition, e-learning, emerging technology and the virtual classrooms are moving education to embrace the benefits of ubiquitous learning (learning anywhere, anytime and everywhere) which supports active knowledge making and differentiated learning. The massive number of origami tutorial videos can show anyone who wants to learn how to fold any objects from the basic crane to complex sculptures like dragons and phoenixes. Can a piece of paper and the act of folding also achieve these impacts of e-Learning? You can manage to find a piece of paper almost anywhere and anytime.\n\nI believe students in this new framework of ubiquitous learning would be more involved in planning and assessing their own learning which in turn, encourages students to take ownership and set more lofty yet achievable goals. I think origami can bridge ubiquitous learning from different disciplines demanded of our students on a daily basis. Teachers can cultivate the Modern Renaissance Child, the universal learner, the polymath inside their students at an early age. Our collective goals in the elementary schools need to change to the philosophy of “learn more through integration” rather than “learn one standard at a time.” In addition, teachers are challenged to remain curious themselves as they learn new knowledge and new methods to solve problems in our ever-changing world. This framework will not water down the demands of standards, but rather approach these standards with layers of complexities.\n\nProblem #2 (Left v. Right Brain)\n\nFrom my own teaching experience, each year I would have a group of students who claimed themselves as artists and a different group of students who claimed themselves as good in math. I believe students have been conditioned to think of themselves to be good at one thing but not the other. Recent neuroscience studies are debunking the “neuromyth” that learners are either more left-brain or right-brain dominant. It’s silly to think that each of us only use half of our brains more often than the other half. This phenomenon may also have been the result of traditional schools tend to focus on the left-brain modes of thinking with emphasis on objective, sequential, logical, analytic and rational academic subjects. On the other hand, our education system downplays the right-brain ways of thinking by justifying “true learning” cannot be subjective, intuitive, illogical, synthesizing and holistic. Who has time to promote illogical thinking? If a lesson is not timed and written down with clear objectives, it cannot be a good lesson. Or can it?\n\nAnother neuromyth related phenomenon manifests itself in my students’ handwriting. Because fine motor skills are not being reinforced and handwriting is not being taught explicitly in elementary school, each year I have at least three 5th grade students whose handwriting is completely illegible, another three students who print letters as big as those of a kindergartener, and another three students who write so tiny that it makes me ponder if their handwriting is an indicator of low self-esteem as well as the uncertainty of their own unique voice and identity. In addition, another three students lack the fine motor skills to draw and cut straight lines. That’s an estimated total of at least 12 out of the usual 30 students, or approximately 40% of the class, who have not taken advantages of learning by doing. Writing by hand is becoming less important since the introduction of laptops, chromebooks and iPads in my classroom. With the release of iPhones in 2007, almost all of my upcoming students (the Generation Z) have texted messages using their two thumbs, but these same students have never been taught how to write in cursives and use handwriting as an art form (calligraphy) for self-expression.\n\nPossible Solution\n\nPaper-folding can teach students how to use their hands to manipulate concepts, in turn, giving all children but especially the tactile-inclined and spatial-gifted students a fun and creative opportunity to shine. At the same time, I believe origami can improve mindfulness, focus and concentration in all children including those who are labeled hyperactive or too difficult to teach. What happens when we test the cliché “thinking outside the box” or “thinking outside of a square” by manipulating paper inside a square? My curriculum unit advocates a more whole-brained mode of learning. I hope to set a precedent to erase the neuro-myth of left and right brains learning in my own classroom.\n\nProblem #3 (Ineffective Math Instructions)\n\nEach year about 75% of my entering 5th grade students struggle with how to add and subtract fractions, and about 50% expressed that because math is getting more and more complicated, they don’t really like it anymore. From personal experiences, children love origami while most adults are skeptical of its value. When I tell adults that I use paper-folding to teach fractions, there are two typical responses: 1) “Really? That’s so cute and adorable.” 2) “Origami? That’s too difficult for me.” In my opinion, the first response is a nice, (most likely unintentional) backhanded compliment suggesting origami is a bit childish, and the second response is an admission that origami can be challenging and it demands discipline. Recently origami has become less a child play activity as more . There is an emerge of prominent origami experts a background in math, science, engineering, technology, and/or architecture. They value creativity as much as they value the hidden rules of folding. If there are rules to origami, then anyone who can follow these rules can also master origami.\n\nIn contrast, whenever I introduce origami to children of any age (say from ages 5 to 14), nine out of ten times, their eyes would widen, their hands start moving, and their voices echo these words: “Teach me! Teach me!” I have found that students who use origami to learn math have good number sense and often perform better in the standardized tests. Paper-folding is an untapped resource for supplementing math instruction; it may even improve math instruction by increasing student engagement. Can paper-folding boost memory and help students to master their conceptual understanding of math ideas as well as other subjects? I think origami is a great engine to support “schematic learning” with repeated failures and successes.\n\nBelow are photos of my former 5th grade students (FY 2017-2018) arranging their origami gift boxes to prepare for an oral presentation. On May 23, 2018, four of my students accompanied me to the Need in Deed Shout Out Celebration at the University of the Arts. Need in Deed is a Philadelphia-based service learning program designed to promote student’s voice. My students created 3 distinct boxes and send heartfelt messages to address the social issue of Kids Home Alone: 1) a cube with the message “You are not alone!” on an origami ring; 2) a rectangular prism with the message “Show love to someone who might need it today” on an origami heart 3) a tetrahedron with the messages “FREE” and “BEE yourself” on a yellow origami bee.\n\nGeneral Inquiries and Possible Solutions:\n\n1) How can origami transforms the teaching of math? A folded model is composed of geometric properties and math relationships. A crane unfolded provides a crease pattern filled with concepts of fractions and equations. Origami can also be used to teach perimeter, area, volume, and other number relationships. Origami models set a tangible stage for students to discuss geometric properties. Student can identify math relationships in a given origami model by using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to problem-solve.\n\n2) How can origami develop scientific thinking in students? Action origami can deepen the understanding of Newton’s Laws of Motion in many fun and creative ways. Teachers had written lessons using origami animals like jumping frogs to demonstrate the laws of physics. A spider origami model can illustrate how its anatomy is divided into 2 regions called cephalothorax and abdomen for a unit on Ecosystem. Origami written instructions and tutorial videos are great venues for students to practice their abilities as they follow the instruction step by step through visual representations.\n\n3) How can origami engineering sparks creative play leading to innovation? Art is a great platform for free thinking and aesthetic pleasures. Creativity is often a messy process of failed attempts. Origami can be used to structure lessons to allow a wide range of freedom with a razor-focus goal to innovate designs that is functional as well as elegant. Students can be challenged to identify global problems by creating origami inventions.\n\nAdditional Rationale as to Why Use Origami to Teach: Science materials can be costly. Physicist Manu Prakash and his team remarkably created a 50-cent microscope made of paper that is easy to made and easy to use; he believes this invention can revolutionize healthcare in developing countries. So what if you can conduct a series of low-cost experiments to test the theories of forces and motion with only paper? In Ancient China and Japan, paper was scarce and reserved only for the elites and religious reasons. For centuries, Japan has used recyclable, renewable and natural materials like paper, leaves, bamboo and grass for packaging everyday items like eggs and fruits. Today paper is easily accessible and comes in a variety of dimension, thickness, color and decorative designs. As people become more environmental friendly, paper is now recycled, remade and reused. One day in the future, paper may once again become a rarity, because computer will eventually replace textbooks, and deforestation will destroy more trees than we can plant new replacements.\n\nBecause origami tends to lead to minimalistic designs that are clear, simple and aesthetic pleasing to the eyes, it inherently follows many characteristics of good design. According to Dieter Rams (a German industrial design and retired academic), good design is innovative, aesthetic, unobtrusive, honest, long-lasting, environmentally friendly, thorough down to the last detail, makes a product useful and understandable. Lastly, good design “involves as little design as possible.” Dieter Rams’ ten principals of good design and the characteristics of origami favor a “less is better” philosophy. Folding a blank piece of paper is “creating something out of nothing” and the sky is the limits.\n\nRiddle: “Open, it stretches; closed, it rolls up. It can be contracted or expanded; hidden away or displayed.” – Fu Xian 傅咸 (239–294), zi Changyu 長虞 Answer: Paper\n\n“To most, the real beauty of origami lies in its simplicity, allowing everyone to create their interpretation of the world in paper.”– Vanessa Gould, director, Between the Folds\n\n“Even DNA is folded—you and I are born from folding.”– Paul Jackson, origami artist.\n\nMy Personal Experiences: As a child growing up in Hong Kong (the then British controlled-colony), paper folding was a shared hobby for all elementary classmates. I immigrated to the United States at the age of eleven (in 1977), folding paper cranes, cameras, gift boxes and other playful objects was one of my favorite pastimes. 折纸 Zhézhǐ (Chinese Mandarin pinyin) or zip3zi2 (Chinese Cantonese jyutping), the art of paperfolding was a healthy recreational obsession as well as a dexterous-gymnastics mind game of my childhood. As a child, I was unaware that the Japanese term origami (ori = to fold and kami = paper) was the more popular name known to the world until I was an adult, a college student majoring in art and architecture. Suddenly, origami is not just child play; it harbors and anchors an educational importance in exploring innovative ideas in art and architecture. Ever since my college years (1985 to 1989), I have continued to learn about origami through personal research with reading of theories and practices. The provocative 1994 book titled “Origami from Angelfish to Zen” by Peter Engel (a writer and an architect) introduces me to how origami can be linked uniquely with mathematics, history, art as well as the theories and practices of Japan’s legendary masters such as Akira Yoshizawa.\n\nBrief History of Paper and Origami: Paper was invented in China around 105 A.D and was used mainly for religious ceremonies as a luxury item. Monks brought paper to Japan in the 6th century and later during the Edo period (1603 to 1886) origami became recreational as well as ceremonial. Europe also has a tradition of paper folding dated back to the 12th century with the Moors introduced the mathematical aspects of paper-folding to Spain.\n\nBack to Basics: In general, an origami folder begins with a single uncut square piece of paper that can be creased. Origami paper (kami) comes in various sizes; most standard sizes are 3-inch, 6-inch and 10-inch squares and can be brought in most art & craft stores. Most origami products come with simple instructions and diagrams of basic folds like valley vs. mountain, pleats and reverse folds. There are also intermediate stages like bird base, fish base, water-bomb base, and frog base. The crane is one of the most recognizable origami designs partly popularized by the story of Sadako Sasaki (佐々木 禎子, January 7, 1943 – October 25, 1955) and the folding of a 1000 cranes. Origami representations include animate objects (example: a crane), inanimate objects (example: a camera), and abstract objects (example: a polyhedron).\n\nModern Origami Inspires Cutting-Edge Technology and Design: Today the word “origami” is used to include all types of folding, regardless of country of origin. As an artist, I’m thrilled when art and culture transform science and math. What I find intriguing is how advanced technology and modern math theories have recently made the “odd pairing” of origami and engineering a reality with real life applications. Scientists have developed a self-folding technology called aeroMorph. NASA is designing foldable solar arrays in a single rocket launch to harvest solar power to be wirelessly transmitted back to Earth. Origami is revolutionizing medical procedures to become less costly, less invasive and more efficient. Classic origami chompers have been turned into miniature forceps resulting in the design of super small surgical robotic tools. Here the traditional art form of origami is informing advanced engineering. What an exciting phenomena!\n\nOrigami artists are pushing origami to the extreme. There are computer programs like TreeMakers and Origamizer that have cracked the code with algorithms that could determine how to fold a piece of paper into any conceivable 3-D shapes. Scientists at the University of Twente in the Netherlands have created flat objects that morph into shapes that open and close like a blossoming flower after a drop of water. This is a cross between 4-D printing (self-assembling objects) and the craft of origami.\n\nIn Spring 2018, I took a seminar titled “Origami Engineering” with University of Pennsylvania Professor Cynthia Sung. This seminar broadens my knowledge of origami with topics such as kirigami, flat folding of maps, letterlocking, “fold and one cut”, tessellations and auxetics, treemaker vs. origamizer, modular origami, polyhedron folding, kinetic (action) origami, foldable and responsive soft meta-materials. I find it necessary to gather a partial list of modern origami experts. Please note: After each description, there is a website or a video link for additional information.\n\nNewton’s Three Laws of Motion\n\nWhile students may know what Newton’s laws say, many do not understand or simply do not believe what these laws mean. Misconceptions of these basic laws hinder future learning of physics. Origami can be used to help students to unlearn these misconceptions.\n\nBrief descriptions of Newton’s Three Laws of Motion:\n\n1st Law: Every object continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion, unless, acted on by a force applied from the outside. Therefore, both situations (objects at rest and object in motion) have the tendency to remain as balanced forces.\n\n2nd Law: Change of motion is proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts. The equation F = ma illustrating that unbalanced forces has an acceleration that depends directly on the net force applied to the object, and depends inversely on object’s mass.\n\n3rd Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore, forces always come in pairs like two pears. For example, when your foot pushing on the ground (ACTION), an equal and opposite force (REACTION) of the ground is pushing on your foot. Another common example is the Newton’s Cradle with pendulum balls.\n\nBrief Biography of Sir Isaac Newton\n\nFamous Quotes of Newton: We build too many walls and not enough bridges.\n\nI can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.\n\nIf I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of Giants.\n\nSir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) was an English physicist, astronomer, mathematician, philosophers and author. He is still considered by many as one of the most influential scientists of all time, and a key figure in modern scientific revolution.\n\nBesides his work on gravity, Newton developed the three laws of motion (the basic principles of modern physics). His discovery of calculus led the way to more powerful methods of solving math problems. His work in optics included the study of white light and the discovery of the color spectrum. Many of Newton’s experiments and discoveries were accomplished at a young age, but most were documented only in his notebooks. It was not until he was 42 years of age that he began writing and published his first book, Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) which is often accepted as the greatest scientific book ever written.\n\nNewton was a man of great ego, arrogance and temper. He had few close friends. His dispute with German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz over the invention of calculus is legendary. Fellow scientists like John Flamsteed, Robert Hooke, and Henry Oldenberg were also his rivals. In February 1676 Newton wrote to Hooke “if I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.” This famous quote was intended as an insult to Hooke, who was hunchbacked and may have suffered dwarfism, and definitely not a sign of Newton’s great humility.\n\nUnlike many intellectuals of his times, Newton was good with his hands. He could work with metal, wood and glass to construct things like his own telescopes. In his old age, Newton confided to his friend John Conduitt that he made his own tools because “if I had stayed for other people to make my tools and things for me, I would have never made anything of [my theories].”\n\nGlossary for Force and Motion\n\nacceleration: the rate at which velocity changes over time; an object accelerates if its speed, direction, or both change\n\nbalanced forces: two forces acting on an object in opposite directions and of equal sizes.\n\nunbalanced forces cause an object to move, stop, change speed, or change direction.\n\ncenter of gravity: an imaginary point in a body of matter where the total mass of the body may be thought to be concentrated. The concept is sometimes useful in designing static structures (e.g., buildings and bridges) or in predicting the behavior of a moving body when it is acted on by gravity.\n\nforce: a push or pull exerted on an object in order to change the motion of the object; force has size and direction.\n\nnet force: combination of all forces acting on an object\n\nfree fall: the motion of an object when only the force of gravity is acting on it\n\nfriction: a force that opposes motion between two surfaces that are in contact\n\ngravity: a force of attraction between objects that is due to their masses\n\ninertia: the tendency of an object to resist being moved or, if the object is moving, to resist a change in speed or direction until an outside force acts on the object\n\nmotion: an object’s change in position relative to a reference point\n\nmass: a measure of the amount of matter/inertial property in an object.\n\nweight: a measure of the gravity on an object, or the force needed to support it. The pull of gravity on the earth gives an object a downward acceleration of about 9.8 m/s2.\n\nprojectile motion: the curved path that an object follows when thrown, launched, or otherwise projected\n\nspeed: the distance traveled divided by the time it took to travel\n\nvelocity: the speed of an object in a particular direction\n\nAppendix P.1.1 (Page 1)\n\nThe Egg Container Paper Design Project\n\nStudent’s Name:_________________________________ Date Due:_______________\n\nGoal: Design and construct a paper container to protect the egg from a fall of over 3 meters (9 feet) from the ground.\n\nObjective: SWBAT to design and build an origami paper container that will protect a fragile egg from cracking under stressful landing and accident conditions IOT understand how energy is converted from potential to kinetic energy, and the amount of work done on the container versus the work done on the egg.\n\nEssential Question: Based on the fragility of an egg, what design concepts need to be considered to protect an egg during a drop from over 3 meters (9 feet) high?\n\nQuestions to be remindful of as you design your container:\n\nShould your container be made rigid; or is it better if the paper collapses?\n\nShould the egg be able to move, or should it be held immobile?\n\nWhat types of structures will absorb the shock of an impact?\n\nHow can it be designed to withstand multiple drops from successively greater heights?\n\nBackground Information: To reduce the effect of impacts due to accidents (primary in the automobile industry), engineers and scientists have been using origami to design foldable airbags and collapsing steering wheels. Preparation: Watch YouTube videos to learn how to make simple origami boxes of different shapes and designs.\n\nConstruction Rules:\n\nThe final container must be an original design.\n\nRequired Material: PAPER ONLY, any sizes and any thickness can be used.

Equilibrium is a state in which opposing forces are balanced. #9 What happens to a person without a seatbelt during a car crash? #10 What happens to a person wearing a seatbelt during a car crash?\n\nAppendix L5.1: Unit Assessment\n\nNewton’s Laws of Motion Questions (Page 8)\n\nDirection: Answer the following questions using complete sentences. Be sure to use Newton’s Laws of Motion in your answers.\n\nWhat happens according to Sir Issac Newton if you let an untied balloon go?\n\nDescribe what happens if you are riding a skateboard and hit something (like a curb) with the front wheels.\n\nDescribe what happens if you push someone who is the same size as you. What happens if he or she pushes back?\n\nDescribe why an archer would hold the bow and arrow next to his or her body while shooting at a target.\n\nWhat is another name for the first law of motion? Why is it given that name?\n\nWhy should we wear seatbelts – use one of Newton’s Laws in your answer?\n\nUsing Newton’s laws explain why heavier objects require more force than lighter objects to move or accelerate them?\n\nHow can Newton’s laws be used to explain how rockets are launched into space?\n\nExplain how each of Newton’s laws affects a game of Tug of War.\n\nHow do Newton’s laws affect your daily life?\n\nAnswer Key: Appendix L5.1: Unit Assessment Source:https://www.shakopee.k12.mn.us/cms/lib07/MN01909221/Centricity/Domain/293/Laws%20of%20Motion%20Questions%20KEY.pdf\n\nWhat happens according to Newton if you let an untied balloon go? Third Law: Air will rush out of the balloon forcing it to move through the air in the opposite direction, but equal in force.\n\nDescribe what happens if you are riding a skateboard and hit something (like a curb) with the front wheels. First Law: Your body will keep moving forward and fly off your skateboard since the curb only stops the board, not yourself.\n\nDescribe what happens if you push someone who has more mass than you. What happens if he or she pushes back? Second Law: If you put force on someone who has more mass than you, force will be put back on you. Because of the other person’s mass, you most likely will not have enough force to make him or her accelerate. If someone pushed you, you most likely would move in the direction of the force, since the other person has more mass.\n\nDescribe why an archer would hold the bow and arrow next to his or her body while shooting at a target. When the archer pull the bow and arrow apart, it forces the arrow out of the bow, but at the same time, the bow is forced in the opposite direction of the arrow (towards the archer). The arrcher’s shoulder is a new force that is introduced in order to keep your bow from flying away from him or her.\n\nWhat is another name for the first law of motion? Why is it given that name? Law of inertia (First Law): It is given that name because inertia is the tendency of an object to resist any change in its motion until an unbalanced force acts on it.\n\nWhy should we wear seatbelts – use one of Newton’s Laws in your answer? We should wear seatbelts so if we are in an accident our body doesn’t keep moving at the same speed and in the same direction that the car was going. A new force would be introduced to our bodies (the seatbelt) in order to keep our bodies in place.\n\nUsing Newton’s laws explain why heavier objects require more force than lighter objects to move or accelerate them? Second Law: Something with more mass moving at the same acceleration as a lighter object would require more force to change its speed or change its direction. Our formula F=m x a is derived from Newton’s second law.\n\nHow can Newton’s laws be used to explain how rockets are launched into space? Third law: when the rocket pushes out fire with a specific amount of force, the rocket will move in the opposite direction, but with the same amount of force, causing the rocket to shoot up into the air.\n\nExplain how each of Newton’s laws affects a game of Tug of War. First Law: The rope will stay in the same place until the tugging starts (when a new force is introduced). Second Law: We could measure a team’s force that they can pull the rope based on their body masses and the acceleration that they are causing the rope to move at. Third Law: One team pulls the rope towards themselves with a certain amount of force and the opposing team is also putting force on the rope. The same amount of force is applied from the ground to the people as they are putting on the ground.\n\nHow do Newton’s laws affect your daily life? Answers will vary, but EVERYTHING that happens in our lives can be connected back to one of Newton’s 3 laws of motion since force is involved in everything.\n\nAppendix L5.2: Individual Conferencing Record Sheet\n\nCopyright © Cengage Learning\n\nDate: Student’s Name & Grade: Purpose of Today’s Conference: Teacher’s Observations: Instructional Needs: Student’s Goals for Future:\n\nAppendix L5.2: Individual Conferencing Record Sheet\n\nCopyright © Cengage Learning\n\n<td\n\nDate: Student’s Name & Grade: Purpose of Today’s Conference: Teacher’s Observations: Instructional Needs: Student’s Goals for Future:\n\nAppendix A6: Unit Assessment:\n\nOral Presentation Grading Sheet\n\nName: ______________________________________ Score: ________(out of 16 points)\n\nProject:_____________________________________Subject:______________________\n\nGeneral Oral Presentation Rubric\n\n4 Excellent 3 Good 2 Fair\n\n1 Needs Improvement\n\nDelivery Holds attention of entire audience with the use of direct eye contact, seldom looking at notes.
