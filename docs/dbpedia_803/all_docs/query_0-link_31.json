It is based on the “Newton’sCradle” toy, and it involves colliding marbles (see video here). Of course, for every action within the lab, there is an equal and opposite reaction. One marble rolled in, one marble rolled out. One marble slowed down, one marble sped up. And thus, we proved that Newton’s 3rd Law is indeed true.\n\nPhysics Workbook 2\n\nTopics include 2D Motion, Vectors, Universal Gravitation, Fields, Circuits and Electromagnetism.
