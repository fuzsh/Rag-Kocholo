        "text": "Get ready to defy gravity and ignite curiosity with our Newton’s Cradle STEM challenge! It’s perfect for elementary students to explore momentum, energy, and Newton’s 3rd Law.\n\nIf you have ever had a Newton’s Cradle in your classroom then you will understand the fascination with this STEM Challenge! Kids absolutely love to watch a Newton’s Cradle clack endlessly together.\n\nI promise the first time we tried this challenge my fifth graders actually cheered when I announced what we were doing.\n\nIt’s the Famous Newton’s Cradle Challenge!\n\n“In this post, for your convenience, you may find Amazon Affiliate links to resources. This means that Amazon will pass on small percentages to me with your purchase of items. This will not create extra costs for you at all! It will help me keep this blog running!“\n\nTip 1- What is a Newton’s Cradle?\n\nWhat happens if you pull up two balls and release them? Two marbles fly out on the other side. This also works for three or four marbles!\n\nTIP: Purchase one of these devices to show students how they work! Spend time talking about the Law of Motion and why the marbles bounce they way they do.\n\nTip 2 – Steps to Building a Newtons’ Cradle\n\nHere is where the adventure begins! I thought it would be really neat to build a Newton’s Cradle!\n\nThe photos below show marbles hanging correctly.\n\nTIP 3 – More String Problems\n\nTIP 4 – Square the Frame\n\nTip 5 – Attaching the Marbles\n\nONE LAST TIP: This challenge is for 5th graders and above. I would also advise using this one with students that are accustomed to completing STEM Challenges. The resource will give you a lot more direction in the detailed teacher’s guide along with many more tips!\n\nGive this fabulous challenge a try! It’s a sure-fire way to engage your students with a fun project!\n\nOur Favorite STEM Books"
