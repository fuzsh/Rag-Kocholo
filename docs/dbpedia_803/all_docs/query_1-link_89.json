It connects scholars of English literature, performance studies, education, sociology, and many other disciplines whose work examines the past and present of the United States and also shapes how the nation imagines its future.\n\nStudents design their own course of study while investigating the many dimensions of U.S. life—race, gender, technology, religion, and mass media, for example. Because the program spans many disciplines, students benefit from access to faculty in economics, history, music, and other departments. American Studies offers endless opportunities to apply the full range of Stanford’s resources to the project of understanding the U.S. in a global context.\n\nAnthropology\n\nBA - Bachelor of Arts\n\nMA - Master of Arts\n\nPhD - Doctor of Philosophy\n\nUndergraduate Minor\n\nDepartmental Honors\n\nPhD Minor\n\nCoterminal Master's\n\nStanford’s Department of Anthropology focuses on the study of human beings and societies through the examination of social, historical, ecological, and biological change across time. Known for its innovative approaches, the department focuses on the full span of human history and full range of human societies and cultures, including those in marginalized parts of the world.\n\nStudents are encouraged to integrate theory and research methods as they explore a range of related subfields that include archaeology, ecology, evolution, linguistics, medical anthropology, political economy, and science and technology. Areas of faculty and student research include questions of social, cultural, and biological diversity and issues of power, identity, and inequality.\n\nView highlights of the anthropology department's undergraduate offerings.\n\nApplied Physics\n\nMS - Master of Science\n\nPhD - Doctor of Philosophy\n\nCoterminal Master's\n\nThe Department of Applied Physics focuses on solving technological and scientific challenges through the lens of physics. The department has a long tradition of building tools, from solid-state lasers to the atomic force microscope, with many advances becoming foundational in new fields of research and industries. Applied Physics has four main research areas: nano science and quantum engineering, lasers and particle accelerators, condensed matter physics, and experimental and theoretical biophysics.\n\nThrough collaboration and joint appointments with electrical engineering, biology, chemistry, and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, faculty and graduate students work on innovative concepts in foundational and applied physics that advance the boundaries of science.\n\nArchaeology\n\nBA - Bachelor of Arts\n\nUndergraduate Minor\n\nDepartmental Honors\n\nDrawing methods and ideas from the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, archaeology introduces students to robust, multifaceted analyses of material culture and human societies. Coursework intersects with history, biology, earth systems, classics, anthropology, and other disciplines.\n\nStanford archaeology advances innovative research across the globe. The Archaeology Center on campus supports interdisciplinary collaboration as a venue where Stanford faculty and visiting scholars work to make the experiences of people, from the ancient past to the modern era, accessible in new ways. Students can apply what they learn in the classroom by participating in summer field schools in Europe, South America, and California.\n\nArt and Art History\n\nBA - Bachelor of Arts\n\nMA - Master of Arts\n\nMFA - Master of Fine Arts\n\nPhD - Doctor of Philosophy\n\nUndergraduate Minor\n\nDepartmental Honors\n\nPhD Minor\n\nCoterminal Master's\n\nThe Department of Art and Art History at Stanford encompasses the history of art, the practice of art in the studio, and film and media studies. Courses investigate the historical development of images and media and their influence on society, as well as their relationship to other disciplines such as literature and music.\n\nCritical thinking and technical skills learned in the classroom inform the creation of artwork in studios, labs, screening rooms, and galleries on campus. Between lecture series, symposia, gallery exhibits, film screenings, and design presentations, the department participates in more than 60 events a year.\n\nView highlights of the art and art history department's undergraduate offerings.\n\nExplore careers of undergraduate art and art history alumni.\n\nAsian American Studies\n\nBA - Bachelor of Arts\n\nCenter for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CCSRE)\n\nUndergraduate Minor\n\nDepartmental Honors\n\nAsian American Studies (AAS) is dedicated to understanding Asian peoples in the U.S. from contemporary and historical points of view. With a broad range of interests and expertise, faculty in AAS take an interdisciplinary approach to studying the complex, diverse, and ever-changing cultures that constitute the Asian American experience.\n\nUndergraduates at Stanford may earn a major or minor in Asian American Studies by taking courses in many departments, including history, English, anthropology, and music. The program is a home for students exploring every dimension of Asian American life from art and literature to social and cultural history to politics and policy. It provides an excellent foundation for appreciating complexity within a diverse, interdependent world.\n\nBiology\n\nBS - Bachelor of Science\n\nMS - Master of Science\n\nPhD - Doctor of Philosophy\n\nUndergraduate Minor\n\nDepartmental Honors\n\nJoint Degrees\n\nCoterminal Master's\n\nStanford’s top-ranked Department of Biology encompasses many sub-disciplines ranging from molecular biology to ecology. Through a core set of courses and specialized electives, undergraduate students study and analyze the building blocks of life, from molecules and cells to organisms and ecosystems.\n\nUndergraduates and graduate students work with renowned faculty specializing in ecology, plant and animal physiology, population biology, genetics, immunology, neurobiology, cell and developmental biology, molecular biology, and biochemistry. In addition to working in labs on campus, students can pursue research at Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains and at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove on the Monterey Peninsula (which is part of the Doerr School of Sustainability).\n\nView highlights of the biology department's undergraduate offerings.\n\nGraduate joint degree offered: MD/PhD\n\nBiophysics\n\nMS - Master of Science\n\nPhD - Doctor of Philosophy\n\nThe Stanford Biophysics Program is an interdisciplinary, interdepartmental graduate training program that leads to a doctoral degree.

Faculty approach the relationship between humans and computers by way of theoretical and technical expertise in cognitive science, linguistics, philosophy, and other fields.\n\nStudents learn technical skills in mathematics and computer programming, along with a foundation based on humanistic perspectives and empirical research. Many students go on to pursue advanced studies in artificial intelligence, neuroscience, or the philosophy of language.\n\nGraduate joint degree offered: JD/MS\n\nTheater and Performance Studies\n\nBA - Bachelor of Arts\n\nMA - Master of Arts\n\nPhD - Doctor of Philosophy\n\nUndergraduate Minor\n\nDepartmental Honors\n\nPhD Minor\n\nAt Stanford’s Department of Theater and Performance Studies (TAPS), students receive instruction—in the classroom and onstage—from faculty as well as artists-in-residence. The curriculum integrates theory, criticism, and a historical study of drama with the experience of live performance in theater spaces on campus. Students apply analytical skills developed in courses to artistic endeavors that range from performing in classic dramas and stage-managing musicals to creating costumes for period pieces and directing experimental one-act plays.\n\nThe department also houses a Dance Division, in which students consider movement both as performance and as a cultural, political, and social lens for understanding the body and the world. Courses covering critical and historical perspectives on dance complement studio classes that teach forms ranging from ballet to hip-hop.\n\nView highlights of TAPS's undergraduate offerings.\n\nExplore careers of undergraduate TAPS alumni."
