        "text": "Here's a perfect way to learn about Newton's 3rd Law. This upper elementary STEM Challenge is a student favorite and easy prep for you. Editable lab sheets are included and will guide students through the design process.\n\nWhat is the challenge?\n\nStudents will use materials to design and create a Newton’s Cradle. In this event, students will review what they know about the laws of motion- especially the third law. Students will have to build the frame for the device, a way to attach strings to the marbles, and a way to attach strings to the frame. This can include measuring as the length of the strings is a factor.\n\nWhat is your prep?\n\nYou will need supplies in addition to this package. This includes craft sticks, straws or beads, masking tape, marbles, string, low-temp glue guns, and glue- one glue gun per team. The option of using low-temp glue for the assembly is yours to make. You may want to ask for parental help in your classroom- depending on the age of your students.\n\nNOTE: This was tested with fifth graders and is recommended for that age group or older students. This is an amazing challenge, but it is a challenge. It may take many tries to get the strings attached and working. Students will love the task and cheer when their device works - even if it works imperfectly!\n\nThe package specifically includes:\n\nCover\n\nTeacher background\n\nMaterials and preparation page\n\n9 pages of teacher directions\n\nConstraints list in 2 styles\n\nA special page of information about Newton’s Laws of Motion\n\n5 pages of photographs\n\nStudent lab sheet in 2 versions\n\nScoring rubric\n\nTerms of Use page\n\nForms for this challenge are provided in an editable format!\n\nStudent answer sheets are not included, but samples from student work are included in the teacher direction pages.\n\nThe page count listed for this package includes everything.\n\nThis challenge will need 1 - 2 class sessions to complete. We needed two full-class sessions to complete this project.\n\nThis challenge works perfectly with these Newton challenges:\n\nBuild a Bottle Car\n\nBuild an Egg Car\n\n➡️ Click here to save 20% on this STEM Challenge in a bundle of 3!\n\n➡️ Click here to save 20% on this STEM Challenge in a bundle of 6!\n\nNEWTON'S LAWS\n\nThe simplified version of the third law is that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nSo How Does This Apply to Newton’s Cradles?\n\nThis is easily demonstrated with a purchased Newton’s Cradle. We had to drop one marble, then 2, then 3, and then 4 to get every student to see that the force is always equal and works the same on opposite sides. Building a Newton’s Cradle is the perfect item to share with the third law of motion.\n\n*****************************************************************************\n\nBe the first to know about my new discounts, freebies, and product launches:\n\nClick here to follow my store.
