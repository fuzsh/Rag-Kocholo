        "text": "Joel and Daniel loved playing the bongo drums as part of the percussion at church on Sunday!\n\nI thought a good subject for their writing assignment this week would be to write a 'persuasive discussion' about getting some drums! Of course I made sure the boys understood that mum & dad were NOT going to be buying drums any time soon, no matter how persuasive their arguments turned out to be!\n\nDaniel ended up writing about getting a wooden drum box (Cajon) instead, and as he was googling it, he realised he might be able to make one with Dad! This persuasive writing assignment has introduced the next technology project! Go Home School!!\n\nWe picked up these 'roll a story' sheets at the library which looks like a good idea - might use it for their next narrative writing exercise.\n\nA new verse for the week - paraphased & continued from last week's verse.\n\nâ€‹Our grassheads are sprouting hair like anything - they will need a haircut soon!\n\nThis week for Science, we were doing lessons on 'forces' including friction, gravity, push, pull etc. We did some experiments by dropping different size balls from the same height (and an aeroplane) to see which would hit the ground first. Then they climbed on top of the shed to try another height.\n\nWe opened our next set of $3 Kmart science experiment boxes - this time Daniel's was about 'rockets' which was fantastic as it fitted with our topic of 'forces'. Here Daniel is launching his plastic bottle rocket with Dad's bike pump.\n\nJoel's kit was 'machines'. He made a a trebuchet (catapault), and a grabber.\n\nAnd Joel discovered Newton's first law of motion over breakfast this morning - by chance he made a type of 'Newtons cradle' with the washers that came in the 'machines' kit! We found that when he hit a washer into a line of washers, they all stayed still except the last one which bounced off the other end! Joel is my budding scientist!\n\nWhen science is more fun than food, it's a winner!"
