Newton's cradle demonstrates the conservation of momentum and energy through a series of swinging metal spheres suspended in a frame. When one sphere at the end is lifted and released, it transfers its momentum and energy to the next sphere in line, coming to a stop itself. This causes the last sphere to swing up nearly as high. The device shows that the final sphere receives most of the energy and momentum from the first sphere. More advanced physics is required to fully explain the interactions when three or more spheres collide simultaneously.",
