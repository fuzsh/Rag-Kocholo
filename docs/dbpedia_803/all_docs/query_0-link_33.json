This is definitely an oldie but a goodie and is a great gift for everyone on your holiday list. Disclosure: I was sent a sample in exchange for an honest review. All opinions shared are mine and mine alone.\n\ntheteacherswife Looks amazing in our collection! - My son is wildly obsessed with Newton's Cradle so I was excited to have the opportunity to review this product! I highly value educational products -especially ones that are fun like this one! Kids can't resist the urge to make it swing! The set takes only a few moments to put together out of the packaging, and it is SO incredibly reflective and shiny at first I thought the base was made of metal! (It's plastic.) It's a really great set though and larger than I was expecting! Definitely a great gift for kids and adults alike! It will make a stunning new addition to our office."
