        "text": "JUNE 8, 2009\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA, May 2009: The Halcyon Company, announced today that its co-founders & co-CEOs, Victor Kubicek and Derek Anderson, will produce Philip K. Dick's 1974 award winning science fiction novel \"FLOW MY TEARS, THE POLICEMAN SAID\". The Halcyon Company secured the first look rights to produce works by the author in conjunction with his estate's production arm, Electric Shepherd Productions. This is the first project to come from the deal and will be produced alongside Isa Dick Hackett and Laura Leslie, daughters of Philip K Dick and co Founders of \"ESP\". Dale Rosenbloom and John Alan Simon, longtime champions of the author's work, will also produce.\n\n\"FLOW MY TEARS, THE POLICEMAN SAID\" is the story of an adored, wealthy celebrity who wakes up after an assassination attempt to find no one seems to have ever heard of him. The novel is set in a futuristic dystopia, where America has become a police state following a second Civil War. Winner of The John W. Campbell Award for best science fiction novel in 1975, and nominated for both a Nebula Award and Hugo Award, the work artfully explores issues of identity, paranoia and redemption.\n\nPhilip K. Dick's works have been the basis for classic sci-fi movies such as BLADE RUNNER (1982), TOTAL RECALL (1990), MINORITY REPORT (1992) and most recently A SCANNER DARKLY (2006).\n\nMaking the announcement Anderson and Kubicek said: \"There is such a treasure trove of material in Philip K. Dick's work that it was a tough choice to decide which would be our debut film. His collection of sci-fi stories is truly unique and in a league of its own. Dick's work by its very nature is perfect for the big screen and we are thrilled to be working alongside Isa and Laura to make \"FLOW MY TEARS, THE POLICEMAN SAID\"\n\n\"Flow My Tears has always been a fan favorite, one which lends itself perfectly to film adaptation,\" said Isa Dick Hackett.\n\n\"We are thrilled to have the opportunity to team with this group in bringing it to film audiences. It is deeply gratifying to see this masterwork adapted for the screen,\" added Laura Leslie.\n\nRosenbloom and Simon said: \"We know that in Halcyon and Electric Shepherd we have found the right partners for this journey. We all share the same commitment to preserve the author's unique and complex vision of the future and the nature of reality itself. And we all share the same passion to produce a movie that achieves that rare balance to be both thoughtprovoking and entertaining in the widest sense possible.\"\n\nChristopher Tricarico brokered the deal on behalf of the Estate of Philip K. Dick and Electric Shepherd.\n\nOne of the most celebrated authors of the last century, Philip K Dick was inducted into the Library of America in 2007 and has received literary recognition unprecedented for a contemporary science fiction writer. His more than 40 novels and 125 short stories are all currently in print in the United States and have been translated into 25 languages.\n\nThe Halcyon Company has access to Dick's vast array of work and plans several features and TV projects to be made with Electric Shepherd Productions.\n\n###\n\nFor further information please contact DDA PR:\n\nUK: Aimee Anderson: +44 (0)20 7932 9871 / aimee.anderson@ddapr.com\n\nLA: Dana Archer: +1 310 205 4868 / dana.archer@ddapr.com\n\nThe Halcyon Company\n\nThe Halcyon Company is a privately financed, media development, production and financing company, headed by co-CEOs Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek. The company is designed to create, acquire, manage, publish and maintain the creative integrity of each and every project delivered by The Halcyon Company across traditional and non-traditional channels of distribution. In May 2007, Halcyon acquired all of the rights in relationship to the Terminator franchise. These rights include the right to produce any future Terminator films, as well as all future merchandising and licensing rights, certain future revenues derived from Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, as well as certain rights in the television project The Sarah Connor Chronicles and the sole right to produce all future Terminator projects in any new or existing media. In 2009, Warner Bros. will distribute the highly anticipated re-launch of the franchise, Terminator Salvation. Halcyon secured the highly-coveted first-look rights to the works of science fiction author Philip K. Dick. Through this unprecedented agreement, Halcyon will have the first option to develop in conjunction with Electric Shepherd for film adaptations, as well as television and other media projects, based on DickÂ¹s vast body of works. Halcyon recently signed biographer and long time Vanity Fair writer Bob Colacello to an exclusive agreement wherein Halcyon will have first look and option to produce all of Colacello's work into film and television that could take the form of feature films or television mini series.\n\nElectric Shepherd Productions. LLC\n\nElectric Shepherd Productions, LLC was founded by Laura Leslie and Isa Dick Hackett, daughters of the late science fiction author Philip K Dick. ESP is the production arm of the Dick Estate, dedicated to the stewardship and adaptation of the Philip K. Dick library across all media. Along with their brother Christopher Dick, the daughters have managed the library since Dick's death in 1982. ESP is currently in development on several other projects based on the works of Philip K. Dick, including Adjustment Bureau, based on the short story Adjustment Team starring Matt Damon that begins shooting in fall of 2009; the Disney/Pixar animated feature King Of The Elves, slated for release in 2012; and an adaptation of the novel UBIK. Many of Dick's other works have been successfully adapted for the screen, including Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report and A Scanner Darkly.\n\nDale Rosenbloom and John Alan Simon\n\nDale \"Chip\" Rosenbloom of Open Pictures and John Alan Simon of Discover Films recently produced Radio Free Albemuth from the posthumously published semi-autobiographical novel by Philip K. Dick. Simon wrote the screenplay adaptation and directed the film. Simon also produced The Getaway starring Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger\n\nRosenbloom combines award-winning, groundbreaking filmmaking with leadership of a marquee National Football League franchise. He has made his mark in both disciplines as Founder and Owner of Open Pictures, one of Hollywood's most active and innovative companies, and Owner/Chairman and managing partner of the St. Louis Rams. Chip has produced, written, and or directed more than 20 feature films over the past two decades. These include the acclaimed multi million unit DVD Shiloh film franchise, which Warner Bros. is rereleasing this fall in DVD, and Fuel, the Sundance Award-winning documentary on alternative energy currently in release."
