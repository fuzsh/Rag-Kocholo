Reeves, Ron Bartrie, and Lynn Brant (T.A.).Thanks to David Reidenour for the photo and the identifications.\n\nField Camp 1963\n\nStudents\n\nIn 1963 the Geological Sciences Curriculum included Departments of Geology, Geophysics-Geochemistry, and Mineralogy. GSc 470, Introduction to Field Geology, was taught during the academic terms, and Field Geology (GSc 472) was taught as a summer course in the West. It is unclear, from the University General Catalog, which majors were required to take GSc 472, but probably geophysicists were not.

Rob Scholten taught the camp that year with Larry Ramspott, who was then an Assistant Professor at the University of Georgia, as his assistant, and Lynn Brant, who had been at the camp the previous year, as TA.\n\nDifferent groups of 3-4 drove the vehicles out. Lynn Brant was in our vehicle. We stayed one night at \"Wendt,\" SD at a ranch where they had stayed the previous year [see Lynn Brant's story on the 1962 webpage]. The ranch was quite large, but the owner could neither read nor write (except his name), and his spouse did not want any of those oil rigs on their property. Their living room had a walk-in stone fireplace, where you could place large logs, and then a sunken area in front of it, and a wide stairway that went to the second floor. We then drove west and over the Bighorns (and had our first snowball fight) before arriving at YBRA. I believe that it was the 4th of July when we were collecting feldspar crystals (which I still have) from a granite in the Beartooths when we got a blizzard that dropped about 7-8\" of snow before we got back to YBRA.\n\nWe collected near YBRA and then spent a couple of days touring the Beartooths, Yellowstone, and Hebgen Lake on our way to Lima, Montana. We spent most of our six weeks camped at the campground on Little Sheep Creek near Lima; we typically had Sundays to go into Lima. There were about 10 of us there, along with a couple of graduate students who were working in the area (the names of Donovan B Kelly and Robert W Hall from the 1962 camp list both look familiar). One of the grad students got sick and stayed in the Lima Hotel for a while. [See Lynn Brant's recollections below: that was actually Don Kelly, an undergrad.] Another graduate student was a tall, thin guy [Herm Witte: read Bob Gardner's story] who put wheat germ on everything and constantly bragged about how much he could eat, until one day I came back hungry: he had 7 burgers without buns, so I had 8 burgers with buns and toppings!\n\nEach student pair had a block of the Tendoy Range to map using air photos. Our base maps only contained ridgelines and streams, so all mapping had to be done on the photos. We completed a map, cross section, and report, usually by the light of a gas lamp in the tent to stay warm enough to work in the evening. My map wasn't too bad. I started working in that area again in 1983 when I joined the Montana Bureau of Mines & Geology at Montana Tech and have continued to do work there.\n\nMy partner was Mitch Smith (who was wounded in Vietnam; I later ran into him in the late 60's in southern California). Mitch and I were assigned a 28 square mile area west of Dell, Montana that was the northernmost of the five areas and included Timber Butte Mtn and Dixon Mtn to just south of Big Sheep Creek. Bob Gardner (who later joined the faculty at the University of South Carolina) partnered with Dave Reidenouer (who I believe later worked for the PA Survey) to map the the adjacent area to the south between Big Sheep Creek and Little Sheep Creek. T K Reeves and Mary had the next area to the south, which they could walk to from the camp on Little Sheep Creek. Another team was farther south in an area that included Garfield Mtn (the highest peak in the area) along the continental divide.\n\nOne of the short day-projects that we had to do was to sketch the \"wailing wall\" along Big Sheep Creek (sec.15, T14S, R10W). My original sketch in 1963 was not very good, but I redid the sketch and analyzed the outcrop for the 1989 Tobacco Root Geological Society meeting in Dillon, so other field-camp people can see it again today in: Northwest Geology, volume 18, p.33. They may also recognize the outcrop with folds about 2 miles west of the Red Rock fault scarp on Big Sheep Creek (sec. 25, 36, T13S, R10W) on p.27, and the Red Rock fault scarp, which we trenched, near the road to camp on Little Sheep Creek (p.23).\n\nRob's spouse [Marsha] cooked our meals for us, and I believe that his son was there as well. Rob took us to Dillon one evening for a steak dinner; we visited Bannock; some of our group participated in the cow-milking contest at the Rodeo in Dillon; we took a two day trip to see volcanics in Idaho; and at the end of the camp, we took a trip to Butte and Anaconda and Glacier National Park. On the trip to visit volcanics in Idaho, we climbed up a steep slope of volcanic material and I remember that Rob was surprised that I climbed it faster than he did, but not by much. (Of course nowadays at YBRA there are an increasing number of students who can climb the hill faster than I can!) We came down the far side and collected beautiful petrified wood (with tree rings and worm-holes or ant-holes well preserved) so everyone picked as many pieces as they could carry in their arms. It was several miles back to the vehicles, however, so the trail was marked by pieces of petrified wood. I still have the 3 pieces I brought back along with an unusual gizzard-stone(?).\n\nThe small groups drove the vehicles back to PA after Glacier, while Rob went back to the camp on Little Sheep Creek (a bear had raided it once we had left!). Our van (Mitch, Bob, Dave, and I) drove north from Glacier National Park into Canada, detouring far enough west to \"set foot\" in British Columbia and to see some spectacular folds before heading back east to Medicine Hat and then straight across southern Canada to Winnipeg, then south into the USA and across the northern peninsula of Michigan, then south to the Turnpike and back to PA. [DHE: This short side trip gained some notoriety in later years and has now reached legendary status.]\n\nI know that Rob taught the 1962 camp in the same area, and I believe that he also taught the 1964 and 1961 camps there as well.\n\nOf all the faculty members at PSU, Rob and his field camp had the greatest impact on me. Dick Jahns and Lauren Wright were also quite important to me. That 6-weeks camp in one area really gives people the time to learn how to map, and those principles can then be applied to any area and any rocks. Having since mapped some 40-50 7.5-minute quadrangles in many different types of rocks, I know that initial long period of time in one area was more important than a variety of short projects in different rock types. Of course most camps today don't operate that way, including YBRA.\n\nSome additional comments by Lynn Brant on the 1963 field camp\n\nI was at the Penn State summer camp among the Lima Peaks in 1962 as a student and 1963 as a student instructor. I also popped in several times in 1964 when Oscar Huh and I were working on limestones in Idaho.\n\nYes, I read Jerry's piece. He tells it pretty well. There were a couple points I remember slightly differently. The guy who got sick and spent a night or two in Idaho Falls was Don Kelly who was in my class but who worked in Greenland the summer of 62 and took summer camp in 63. I was with him in Idaho Falls that weekend he was sick, and we watched a partial eclipse of the sun from the hotel window.\n\nLynn's comments about the previous year's field camp\n\nLynn Brant remembers about the 1962 field camp.... most of this narrative is from an article in the Fall 2005 Earth News from the Department of Earth Science, University of Northern Iowa\n\nGeology field camp, as any old geologist will tell you, can be quite adventurous, sometimes even educational. My experience in 1962 was like that.\n\nAfter a spring field course of mapping and measuring sections in a Pennsylvania quarry, five of us piled into a brand new International Travelall, the mother of all SUVs, and headed to Montana to see the real thing. The five of us made it, but the Travelall didn't. It was a nice, straight portion of a South Dakota highway. I totaled the vehicle and sent Nan to the hospital in Pierre. A few days later, we retrieved Nan and resumed our travels in other vehicles of the Penn State caravan. Nan carried a 40-pound backpack that summer with her recovering collar bone which was broken in the accident. Tough woman!\n\nNan's roommate during her two days in the hospital was Florence Williams, the wife of a rancher, who, I think, had fallen off a ladder. When we came home we stopped at their ranch and had a nice visit. Their place was near a former town site called Wendt. Dick Williams was kind of a show-off. He pretended to be a big drinker, fast in his cars, and all the rest you would associate with a cowboy. Actually, it wasn't a show -- he really was that sort of guy!! But he was likeable. We stopped there in 1963 (maybe twice) because I got to know the Williams pretty well over the years.\n\nWe entered southwest Montana and then crossed Centennial Valley on the gravel road that nearly mired several of the vehicles. But, oh, what scenery! That was as close to heaven as I had ever been. The green valley and snowcapped mountains set in the \"big sky\" of Montana!\n\nPenn State's camp was a small Forest Service campground at the end of a long, lonely road. Lima was ten miles away and the Lima Peaks rose around us. Accommodations were two persons to a tent, and the dining hall was a tarp strung over a picnic table. The nearest telephone, refrigerator, and running water were in Lima. The nearest grocery store and fresh meat were in Dillon, some 40 or 50 miles away. The camp managers bought food once a week in Dillon, and on that one night each week we had fresh meat, some fresh fruit, maybe some wine, and delicious strawberry pie from Skeet's Cafe. The rest of the week was kind of thin. It was that summer that I learned that two eggs for breakfast was a real luxury. We had a chance to get a shower at the Lima Hotel on Saturday, whether we needed it or not. By Friday or Saturday my socks stood up by themselves! The evening entertainment was singing ribald songs around the campfire and, of course, working on our maps.\n\nUndergrads in camp that summer were Ron Smith (who later got his MS with Al Guber), Ed Dowling, Jim Lovejoy, Art Fuller, Al Bowser, Lynn Brant, Linda Williamson, Peter Groth, Nan Stewart, and Malcolm Stewart. Graduate students, some getting introduced to their thesis work: John Haas [PhD66], Sam Romberger [PhD68], Ivo Lucchitta [PhD67], Baerbel Koesters [PhD66], who later married Ivo and had a career with USGS/NASA, John M'Gonigal [PhD65] and his wife, and Skip Lenker [Earle S Lenker, PhD62], who had his T-bird along. There was a highschool-aged helper, Ron Bortree, Rob and Marsha Scholten, and Peter Scholten (only ten years old that summer but he was as fast up the mountains as his dad!). I think maybe Marsha was the main cook that summer. Then Lauren Wright and Ben Troxel visited for a while and went out with the students to help teach.\n\nBefore going west in 62, one of the veterans from 1961 advised me to always be first up a mountain (to demonstrate enthusiasm). I tried! But Rob was fast and his wife and son were faster. There were several times I headed up the hill as fast as I could go, and even though I was the first of the students, I was met by the Scholten family on the top! Once we were some distance from the vehicles when Rob finished his lecture and the whole group headed back. I decided to be first but Rob was ahead of me. Neither of us admitted to being in a race but that we were. He beat me but I gave him a good run!!\n\nWe worked in teams of two, and each team was responsible for mapping a designated area. Al was my partner, and we mapped a 28-square-mile expanse of mostly Mesozoic sedimentary rocks on the south side of the Lima Peaks. To reach the area each day we drove a 1948 Jeep (just like the ones used on MASH, except ours was a faded maroon color) to Lima, down the paved road at 40 mph (because that was its top speed) and then several miles across ranch land to where we started our walk of up to seven miles to reach the far corner of our area. We mapped on air photos. There were no topographic maps for that part of Montana in 1962.\n\nOne day Al and I tried approaching our area by crossing the mountain. We got the Jeep up to a grassy meadow near a sheepherder's wagon. Then we started across the talus toward a saddle on a ridge. I thought I heard water running, but because we were on boulders on the side of a steep mountain, I couldn't figure out where the water was coming from. Then I noticed that I heard it only when I took a step. Holy Smokes!!! The whole side of the mountain was slowly moving down slope with every step! Surrounded by big boulders and with a cliff below us, I realized that if we started a rock slide they wouldn't even know where to look for our remains! We quickly got off the slope and returned to the Jeep, shaken but alive. No geology done that day!\n\nWhen the course ended, the five of us who had been in the ill-fated Travelall started home together. My companions were Pete, Linda, Nan and Malcolm, plus a ground squirrel in a cage. Malcolm and I had decided to grow a beard that summer, at a time when nobody grew beards. Pete was clean-shaven: to impress Linda, I suspect. Malcolm was married to Nan, so he wasn't trying to impress anyone. We left Lima in a Plymouth station wagon that had been seriously abused that summer by one of the grad students (always blame the grad students). We made it to Butte by nightfall, where we tried to turn around in a school and found we had no working transmission. (I swear, I wasn't driving that time!!) We were stuck on the edge of a town that had a reputation for being rough. Besides, the copper miners in Butte had gone on strike that very day. But we were tough. We had just spent a summer in the mountains of Montana and we had our sleeping bags. No problem. The police didn't see it that way in the middle of the night, though. We had to explain why we were sleeping in the school yard and why we were driving a vehicle registered to The Pennsylvania State University. Our beards and the caged squirrel didn't help matters. Neither did the fact that Pete was in his underwear as he locked up the car again. \"You get some pants on before daylight. You're in a residential area young man!\" said the cop.\n\nIt took two days to fix the transmission, but in the era of sending checks through the mail we waited for six days before the garage would let us go. Meanwhile we checked into an old hotel in downtown Butte for only $5.00 a night for all five of us, six counting the squirrel. For that we got a parlor, a bedroom, and a bathroom with a tub, as long as we promised not to sleep in the bed. So we rolled out our sleeping bags, placed the squirrel on the fireplace mantle and went to sleep. Money was short. We made a rule that if you couldn't eat it or read it you didn't buy it! We ate for five nights in a row in the three Chinese restaurants in town because Nan thought we could get the most food for our buck that way.\n\nAfter Butte we traveled to Glacier National Park and home to Pennsylvania through Billings, Montana, and Iowa. Coming down the long hill into Billings from the rimrocks we heard on the radio \"Ramblin Rose\" by Nat King Cole for the first time. Every time I hear that song I think of that sunny, hot day in August so many years ago.\n\nThere were other adventures that summer, like the time the sheriff and I went up that lonely road with a loaded 30-30, which we figured we might have to use (and not on a bear!). But as everyone knows, there are some stories from field camp best left untold. Within a few years Pete and Linda got married, Nan and Malcolm got divorced, and Al married my sister. And I lived happily ever after.\n\nAn essay by Don Kelly on the Wild Cow Milking Contest, with comments by Ed Beutner, Rob Scholten, and Jerry Bartholomew\n\nA version of Don Kelly's story, My First Wild Cow, appeared in the March/April 2008 issue of The Penn Stater alumni magazine (p. 13), accompanied by this illustration by Martin Jarrie\n\nEd Beutner, Rob Scholten, and Don Kelly on the Wild Cow Milking Contest\n\nED BEUTNER: \"I was working in Idaho, but I remember driving over to Lima to meet to spend the 4th of July with the field camp group and the other grad students (Baerbel Luchitta, Oscar Huh, Bob Ryder) who had gathered. To uphold the honor of Penn State, several of the group (fortunately not including me) entered the wild cow milking contest at the local rodeo, an event which required consumption of a lot of beer by all of us beforehand. This event involved a team of three being given a rope at the other end of which was a range cow. The goal was to get a perceptible amount of milk from the cow into a Coke bottle. The cow, on her part, tried to drag the trio face down across the arena through the dirt and cow poop\"\n\nA LETTER TO THE EDITOR OF THE SUMMER COLLEGIAN, July 18, 1963, entitled \"Geologists Defend University's Honor\":\n\n\"Who says students are getting soft? Not those at the Penn State Geology Camp in Montana!\n\nThis is to inform you that, at the Lima, Montana, rodeo the PSU Wild Cow Milking Team, consisting of Lynn Brant, Don Kelly and Mitch Smith, wrestled the maddest, snortingest, stampingest, bellowing range cow these parts have seen in many a year, held her fast by head and tail, and milked her to deafening applause in the stands in 52 seconds flat!\n\nTrue, they didn't win, but they did beat several teams of life-long husky cowpokes. I figure the folks back East would want to know that Penn State's honor is being properly defended in the woolly West!\n\n------ Robert Scholten, Associate Professor of Geology\"\n\nMy First Wild Cow for Dear Old State\n\nOr, Take one wild cow, add pop bottle and spit\n\nby Donovan Kelly\n\nI hadn't thought about that wild cow, the one I attacked with a pop bottle, in a long time. I mean, who thinks much about the summer of 1963 these days? Shoot, I have trouble remembering last summer.\n\nBut there I was, in the middle of a vanity search, looking to see where Google might find my name on the web, when my summer of 63 popped up. Who would have thought that Penn State had a web page just for the summer geology field camp program? Or that my 1963 field camp in Montana would have its own page and include a fleeting reference to me and my first wild cow?\n\nIt was not love at first sight. It was war. The honor of all easterners was at stake. We saw how the good old boys of Montana looked at us. We saw them in their tall boots, jeans and long-sleeve shirts laughing at our shorts and tee shirts.\n\nMaybe they thought we were after their women, but all we wanted was their geology. Just enough to fill our map, write a report and pass a class that had kept us on the road for 6 weeks. This was my last class before graduation and I already had a real job waiting for me. Geophysical Services Inc. had promised me a return to the Arctic and an assignment on the North Slope of Alaska. (What I got was West Texas, Louisiana, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.)\n\nBefore we could map Montana geology and drink local beer, we had to first win acceptance from the locals. Our leader, Dr. Scholten, said winning over the locals was an important lesson for all geologists to learn. You can look it up in my notes. Little did I know that I would spend 30 years at USGS doing just that, working with the news media to try and make the world safer for geologists.\n\nI think it was Dr. Scholten himself who suggested that we enter the local Lima rodeo to earn goodwill and show them we were just regular people. Or maybe it was the devil himself who suggested it, thinking he would get a good laugh. Both got their laughs, and both were smart enough not to enter themselves.\n\nFor a number of reasons, we passed up bull riding. In fact, the only event we were remotely qualified for was the wild cow milking contest. As fate would have it, I was the only student present who had actually milked anything before. Most of my milking experience had been with goats, but one summer I did dabble in cows. But what we faced was not those gentle Pennsylvania milking cows strapped in a barn and munching hay. These were free-roaming cows fresh off the range that had never had any friendly human contact. Mama cows who were extra frantic because they were looking for their lost calves and whose udders were painfully swollen.\n\nDid I mention that these 800-pound cows were running loose in an arena and being hooted on by the locals? My teammates, Lynn Brant and Mitch Smith, were to hold the cow still enough and long enough, for me to get some milk into a tight-lipped Coke bottle. \"Got to see some color,\" the judges explained.\n\nOur cow never got what I would call still, but I did manage to squirt some milk into the bottle and went racing back to the judges. I think we came in second. The judge looked at my cow-trodden and plop-plastered feet and proud grin and then at the bottle. \"Looks like real milk,\" he said. \"Most people know enough to just spit in the bottle.\"\n\nMaybe it was a put down, but at least we were able to drink beer with the locals after that. And next time, I'll just spit in the bottle.\n\n(P. S. Yes, I'm the one who got sick and spent a week in the Lima railroad hotel with Goldie who made me oatmeal and sent daily updates to my mother. Sorry, Lynn, I don't remember the partial eclipse. Just an excess of train whistles and oatmeal. After recovering, I stayed over at field camp after the other undergraduates left to finish my geology report. I ended up hitchhiking back to Pennsylvania. Rest of the story will cost you a beer.

In that same spirit, I don't know if you remember or not, but there was also a dance at the schoolhouse in Monida (south of Lima a few miles on I-15) that at least some of us went to. That old school house was not in too bad of shape in 1983 when I moved to Butte, where I lived and worked for a decade, but it is now in ruins.\n\nLeonard (Bob) Gardner's recollections of Herm and the Bug\n\nGypsum beds in Oklahoma. To the right: Herm Witte and The Bug. Photo courtesy of David Reidenour\n\nBob Gardner recalls Herm and the Bug at the 1963 camp\n\nI read Jerry Bartholomew's recollections of the 1963 field camp. He refers to a tall skinny grad student with thick glasses who ate wheat germ. This was Herman Witte. He was from Trenton NJ and did a MS in Geology at Penn State. I believe that he then went to the University of Alabama to study psychiatry but have since lost track of him. Just before we started out on the cross-country geology tour, Herm's mother bought him a brand new Volkswagon Bug. A day or so later the carravan was camping somewhere in southern Ohio. The next morning Herm announced that he had to take his Bug in to have its 500 mile checkup. Larry Lattman, who was leading that leg of the tour, said \"God damn it Herm, we can't wait for you to take your car in for service!\" So off we went minus Herm. Several days later we were riding the dirt back roads of southwestern Missouri to meet a mining geologist who was going to show us the lead-zinc deposits of that area. Suddenly up ahead we saw a yellow Bug making circles in the road. It was Herm! \" How the hell did you ever find us out here?\" Well it turned out that Herm had stopped at a restaurant on US 66 in Joplin the night before and by pure chance had met the geologist who we were going to meet the next day.\n\nHerm pulled off another similar stroke of good luck several days later in Carlsbad NM. We were staying in a KOA campground and on Sunday morning had gone out to see the Caverns. We came back around noon to have lunch and a short siesta. At about 2PM the caravan set off to tour a potash mine just west of Carlsbad. At the mine we boarded an elevator and went down about a thousand feet to the potash workings. From there we walked about a mile along one of the drifts and then noticed that Herm and Dave Reidenour were not with us. Later, as our host was discussing the geochemical origin of the deposits and the mining methods used to extract them, we heard voices coming down the drift. And then into our midst came Herm and Dave, unescorted. They had overslept and missed the caravan. So they set out into the dessert in the Bug looking for us in one of a dozen or so mines in the area. As luck would have it they stumbled upon the right mine, and the elevator operator sent them down with instructions as to which drift to follow.\n\nUnfortunately Herm's luck ran out later in Montana. One morning, while driving to his map area, he hit a boulder that had rolled onto the road and had to be towed into Lima for repairs.\n\nClick on the thumbnails to enlarge the images: (The first five images are from 1963, thanks to David Reidnour, in addition to the lead photo on the 1963 recollections page and the lead photo on the Herm and Bug page.

The remaining twelve of us marched off into the Teton Wilderness Area [which lies east of the park] with Barry, making the group number a lucky thirteen. However, we didn't learn where we were going or how we were to get there until the evening before we set off; Barry told us only to buy 11 days worth of nonperishable food in Jackson Hole earlier in the day. Of course, this also meant that we didn't know what was to happen until after the vans had left with the others. (The sole of one of my boots had detached by this point so I also decided to buy a new pair of boots while in town.)\n\nI was with Barry when he picked up some mail in Jackson Hole. He seemed particularly irritated with a letter from Wayne Burnham and then declared that the Department Chairman had doubled the liability insurance when he heard where we were going and how we were to get there.\n\nBefore describing the trip I should say that Barry had enlisted our group prior to the start of field camp and had warned us that his session would involve extended backpacking and would be physically demanding. So we knew about that and had appropriate gear. Well... most of us did... one fellow had a boy scout pack with an external frame that was not kind to his back.\n\nThe first morning we drove to a lodge [Togwotee Lodge] and descended a rather long trail down to a tributary of the Snake River [the Buffalo Fork]. In the course of the trip we would cross the continental divide and the headwaters of the Yellowstone River. The entire trip involved hiking approximately 100 miles. Barry had outlined the trip with us on the map as we set off. He had pointed out the locations of two ranger stations and what was to be done if someone or, particularly, if Barry was injured during the course of the trip. A second, backup map was given to one of the more experienced of us (not me) should Barry's copy get lost. At one point on the descent, Barry decided that the switchbacks were taking too long so we took an off-trail \"short cut\". I recall this involved scrambling over a lot of blow-down and much cussing.\n\nWe finally rejoined the trail and proceeded up-river through a very dry bottom dotted with sagebrush and not much overhead cover. The dry soil, churned by the passage of packhorses, rose in puffs of dust as we trudged along in the hot sun. We were already tired from the off trail adventure, though it wasn't yet noon. I was dragging at the back of the line, which was to become my station for the entire journey because my feet were blistering. It was then that I noticed an odd looking, amorphous cloud wafting toward me through the line of hikers. The cloud turned out to be mosquitoes, and they were very hungry. I recall wiping my arms and leaving behind disturbing amounts of blood -- as much from the marchers in front as from me. The mosquitoes became our constant companions, leaving us only once that I recall; that would be late in afternoon of the following day while we crossed the divide in a hail of water and ice.\n\nThe first night, though, was very pleasant and a welcome relief for all of us. We camped in woods at the edge of a meadow being used by some horse packers. We had a nice fire going and were enjoying some of the more perishable (and heavier) food. At one point we heard a rustling in the darkness beyond the edge of our vision. We could make out the shape of a large beast moving about and assumed one of the packers' horses had gotten loose of its hobble. Our mistake became obvious when the head of a moose loomed out of the darkness, peering at us. Its curiosity satisfied, the moose disappeared into the night and that was the last we saw of it.\n\nThe next morning my feet seemed to have swollen. They no longer fit very well in my boots, which were still size 9.5, though soggy (and cold) from having trudged several times across the stream the previous day. The morning of the second day was uneventful. I was having difficulty keeping up, but found that I could manage if I didn't stop walking when the others took rest breaks. This became my routine for the rest of the trip. It began to cloud and rain softly after lunch. As we began our ascent of the switchbacks toward the Continental Divide at Two Oceans Pass, Barry told everyone to have warm clothes, and such rain gear as we had, ready and to not delay in putting them on if the weather took a bad turn. This was good advice, because the rain steadily increased in intensity and changed to sleet and then hail as we approached and crossed the 10,000+ foot-high divide. I should mention that the trails, unlike eastern trails, were relatively easy, having been designed for pack trains. That is, except for the fords.\n\nWe came to the most difficult of the fords as night descended on the Yellowstone side of the divide. In the dark we faced the Yellowstone, swollen by the summer melt to over-waist depth. By the time I got there, a rope had been strung from a tree on the far bank to one fellow anchoring it on my side. Most of the guys were already on the far bank and a couple were stationed in the river helping the stragglers across. Most of us had only one change of clothes, so we stripped to our skivvies in the vain hope of keeping something dry and waded into the river. The packs we removed and handed overhead in monkey-brigade fashion, to avoid having them partially submerged by the rushing water. We had worked out the scheme of using a rope for support in a previous deep ford; this tactic proved a key factor in none of us going for a night swim in that cold water. We camped at the nearest reasonable spot, which was in sight of the place we had forded. Before long a fire was going and nearby trees were festooned with ropes from which were hung thirteen pairs of socks, pants, shirts, and various undergarments. It was a cold, wet night, but we were all relieved that the day had ended and no one was otherwise much the worse for it.\n\nThe next day was great -- more or less flat walking downstream along the Yellowstone to the area we where we would camp for three days to do some geology. The sun came out and along the way we were treated to glorious views of a giant glacial valley and its hanging water falls. We stopped hiking early to camp near a cobble-strewn bank of the river. Barry passed out some extra fishing gear and we all went fishing for a few hours. Enough were caught to feed us all. That evening we treated ourselves to golden trout fried in a cast iron pan one of the horse packers had left hanging on a tree. Sitting on the bank watching the moonlit Yellowstone wash by, while eating that fish, is one of my fondest memories of the trip.\n\nSoon after the fish was consumed, we began to notice an odd metallic sound coming from the brush just outside of camp. After a brief hunt for the source of the sound we discovered Bob (the experienced one) huddled around something he obviously wanted to keep to himself. It was a metal bowl in which he had been stirring with his metal spoon this glop that turned out to be instant pudding (Jello green pistachio instant pudding). Bob was convinced to share some of his delicacy with us and it was generally agreed that it was the best desert we had ever tasted. Bob, it seems, had devoted a surprising portion of his precious pack space to this wonderful stuff. (I don't know about the others, but for many years thereafter I never failed to take Jello instant pudding, and always some pistachio, on camping trips.)\n\nOver the next three days we engaged mapping exercises that consisted mostly of measuring volcanic sections. Barry indicated to us that this area was being mapped by a friend of his from the USGS, Bob Crandall. However, Bob accessed the area by helicopter and couldn't spend much time on the ground. So, Barry assured us that our work would contribute greatly to this effort. I'm not sure our work was as useful as Barry suggested it might be, but it sounded like a reasonable excuse for the effort expended in reaching the place.\n\nOne morning during our stay in the area we heard a bellow coming from the vicinity of Barry's tent: \"An A in the course for anyone who has prunes.\" Wayne Narr and I searched our packs, because we knew that we had something like prunes. They were figs, which I dutifully presented to Barry. (A couple of months later I learned that both Wayne and I got an A for field camp, though I'm certain it had nothing to do with the figs.) The figs had been one of the brighter food selections Wayne and I had made for the trip. Most of the guys had scrounged what they could from the markets in Jackson Hole, because we couldn't afford the freeze-dried goodies that were available at the camping supply places. One of the less successful selections we made was this stuff that had recently hit the market - hamburger helper. Neither of us knew what it was, but it was obviously dry (therefore light) and from its name we figured it must be something like hamburger. We discovered that while it is possible to boil hamburger helper into some kind of porridge, its taste leaves something to be desired in the absence of hamburger.\n\nThe march back out of the Teton Wilderness was less eventful. We accomplished it in one less day, though. The last day was a forced march of about 25 miles. I recall that we were making good time and at one point Barry offered us the option of pushing for the trailhead or camping through the evening. Everyone, except me, voted to push on. I didn't want to because my feet were slowing me down. Well, the vote decided it and we forged ahead. Barry asked Bob to lag behind with me to make sure that I made it. As it turned out we arrived at the valley of the mosquitoes well before dinnertime. Barry was waiting there with a few of the others so we could end the journey together. The mosquitoes were still biting, but by this time we didn't pay much attention. They had ceased raising welts.\n\nWe made it back to the lodge around four or five in the afternoon. There was a bar in the lodge and Barry took us right in and bought a round of beer for us all. No one at the bar seemed to take undo notice of us, though I'm not sure why. It must have looked (and smelled) like a scene out of Gunsmoke as the cowhands were coming to town. During the journey we had washed, sort of, but not with much conviction, and most of us were wearing clothes that had been changed perhaps once in the past week. I don't remember the brand of the beer, but I am certain it was the best tasting I have ever encountered. While we enjoyed the beer, Barry convinced the owner to open up the kitchen early for dinner. We all sat down to a full meal and then repaired to a dormitory setup in the attic of the place to wash and take a nap. After sleeping for about an hour or two every one of us went back to the dinning room and ate a second full meal. I think that second chicken fried steak was just as good as the first one. The second pie was pretty good too.\n\nIn retrospect, I don't think any of us that made the trip thought of it as the 'death march.' That was a term coined by others. It has been 30 years since that summer of 1975, and it was an adventure I well remember.\"\n\n[addendum after reading Steve's piece] Scree skiing! I heartily joined in that bit of fun, which was probably why the soles of my boots were flapping in the breeze not long after White Mountain. I think it was Randy Woods who helped me get some mule skin on my feet during lunch that first day of the march. We hadn't stopped moving long enough to do it before then. By that time, though, the blisters had risen. So we cut donut holes in the patches of mule skin, which helped a little. My feet were toughened from field camp, but no match for the stiff leather of those logger's boots -- not one of the wiser purchases I've made.\n\nSteve's story reminded me of a few things I'd forgotten, like the grizzly bear and the powdered tequila (I think I got a taste of the stuff the night of the trout fry. Thanks Steve).\n\nLike Steve, I had a few after-field camp adventures. I went back to White Mountain to help Charlie Faust (then with the USGS) and his partner Daffodil (a dog, whom Charlie referred to as Dafferdowndilly) with his mapping of that area. Late one afternoon, we left White Mountain and went to Cathedral Cliffs to collect some basalt samples from the Heart Mtn. Slide detachment zone. Charlie (who was more intelligent than I) stayed at the car after directing me to climb up through a breach in the 50 ft+ high lower escarpment. Above this was a slope of tuff that led up to the detachment zone. I got up there well enough and got my prize, but on the way back across the slope the thin cover of pebble-sized scree slipped from beneath my feet. I quickly found myself sliding down the slope toward the cliff of basalt columns below. I splayed my arms and legs, but this only slowed my slide enough to give me time to think about it. I realized that I was either going to stop this or it would likely be the end of me. Fortunately, I still had my rock hammer in my hand and was able to stop the slide by digging its spade end into the soft rock with as much force as I could muster. Once I got my self seated upright and turned around, I was rewarded with the most spectacular and beautiful sight I think I've ever had. The sun was low in the sky and was shedding a gorgeous golden light over the valley and the scattered patches of cloud that had moved in below me. The clouds cast dark shadows and were shedding rain and lightning on the ground beneath. It was dark by the time I got back to the car and met Charlie and his dog. I don't recall what happened to that rock.\n\nField Camp 1975\n\nSteve Mellon's thoughts on the Teton Wilderness trip and his succeeding career\n\nI was on the death march. We mapped the Wapati Formation, as I remember it. Actually, I would not refer to it as a \"death march.\" I rather enjoyed it and have done a similar hike many times since. I thought we had a nice tight team, got some mapping done, and everyone made it back safe and sound! It is a very pleasurable memory and something I will never forget!\n\nTell Barry I said Hi! Ask him about tequila behind the rocks! He thought I was crazy for packing it in and the empty out--oh yeah we told everyone it was powdered tequila!\n\nThe fella with the boy scout back pack in Jim’s description went with me after the 10-day trip to work at Johns Manville, the Stillwater company, at Brass Monkey Camp. He left Brass Monkey before I did. I stayed until I had to go back to make the fall classes. Another field camp member, Randy Scott, worked on a sampling crew with me. And Bob Fullerton made four field campers working at Brass Monkey.\n\nI remember all the events Jim describes, and I enjoyed it all. The horse thing was on the trail, and Randy Wood, my tent partner, and I could tell they were following us. They came right at us, and we jumped 40 feet when they broke onto the trail. I was more in the middle to front of the line as I remember it.\n\nRandy and I in one photo are clowning around on a log we had to walk over a creek (big, cold and fast-moving). Yeah we were wet, and my tent partner twisted his ankle on the first day, but we stayed up with the pack. Jim must have been without mule skin?? I remember the fish fry and I remember mapping and looking from a ridge during lunch (PB&J) down on a thick huckleberry patch -- and then the berries moved! A grizzly bear! We ended lunch, moved down a scree slope and back to camp early!\n\nRandy Wood was also the main guy who ran down scree slopes on White Mountain [on the Heart Mountain project] at the end of each day. He never fell, and we called it scree skiing. See who remembers that deal! I remember crossing the Yellowstone; one guy slipped and almost lost his pack. I remember that two folks were staged downstream to grab any packs or folks. I remember sponge baths in creeks and the river that were very cold; we splashed, lathered up and jumped back in. Rough duty, but we had fun too!\n\nDoes anyone remember asking Barry what the large hunks of meat were on the sharpened pine limbs? After we were in more than a day, we saw 5-6 of them along our trail. Barry says -- Bear traps to keep bears in here because they put the distempered bears from Yellowstone here. Course he was testing our metal!\n\nWhat a team we were after that trip. In 1975 we worked hard, played hard, and had the experience of a lifetime! I think it prepared me for life as a field geologist, that and my opportunity to work at Stillwater. One opportunity lead to another etc. Not sure you know the Stillwater story... Duff offered everyone an opportunity to go to Stillwater after field camp. Only three accepted. Everyone wanted to get back to finish out the summer before it was over. Some of us were in love with the mountains, however, and saw an opportunity beyond comparison -- a chance to do geology, walk in the mountains every day, get paid, and fed all you could eat. I think I lasted the longest and really did not want to leave. I could tell you many stories that happened while I was at Brass Monkey Camp! Pink snow, stranded OVN by chopper, folks almost cut by chopper blades for dumb moves, down drafts and see you in AM, walking blasting caps off the skid of the chopper onto shear rock ledge, tying the 3rd cap on, blasting outcrop, fishing in isolated ponds, off days-camp parties, etc. I got to do a lot of neat projects -- adit mapping (Fog Pond), adit sampling, winky drilling and core logging, outcrop mapping and sample blasting.\n\nThis experience led to my next opportunity with Phelps Dodge as an exploration geologist. My curriculum at PSU and field camp/Stillwater experience impressed PD, so I advanced ahead of folks with MS degrees. I impressed them with my interpretation and classification of saprolite in the Piedmont. I could actually see through sap and classify rock type etc. which had a 90% hit ratio when petro reports came back. Duff and Charlie Thornton had lot to do with this! That then got me into grad school [South Dakota School of Mines] even though I was a \"marginal\" student.\n\nIn grad school I had a paid mapping thesis, with Union Carbide, on a skarn. I had lots of money for geochem, petro, maps, printing, photos, etc. Union Carbide wanted a deposit, and I wanted a thesis.\n\nThen that lead to AMAX and exploration work. I worked for them at 3 mines for another 6 years. Then the industry took a downturn, and I switched to environmental work, building tailings and construction dams. Then in 1994/5 I permitted the only stand-alone in-situ copper mine operational in both the US and the world, to this point, for BHP (Magma Copper). We permitted what was said not to be do-able! I think Barry's determination and rock mechanics courses had something to do with that.\n\nWithout Field Camp, Barry's toughening course, and Duff's opportunity for me to work at Stillwater, I would definitely have been behind the eight ball. Duff and Barry opened doors that would have been closed for me!\n\nPS.. the rigorous curriculum at PSU paid off many times over... make folks take the calculus, physics, and chem load that we had to take in the 1970's – it really helped me in grad school and in industry!\n\nAdditional remarks by Barry Voight on the 1975 trip\n\nThese guys have great memories and/or really good field notebooks. I remember pretty much all of it, including the tinny sounds in the bushes that turned into a pistachio-coated spoon and the challenging Yellowstone fording. Pistachio thus became a regular import into the Iceland project in late 1970s-1980s. The take-off and return spot for the trek was Togwotee Lodge, on the road heading east from Jackson Hole. The trout were cutthroats. Like Jim, I remember our first tall beer in the Lodge, at the end of that long dusty and sweaty day, as the best I ever had.\n\nIncidentally the drinking age in Wyoming was 17. Otherwise of course, these lads could not have had alcoholic beverages. Or Steve's magic powder, the freeze-dried cactus fluff destined to make a million for the inventor. Or be ready for enlistment at Parris Island.\n\nI'm guessing I didn't teach the full field camp that year, but came out to take over from Duff to do the last 3 weeks or so, i.e. Heart Mountain area project (White Mtn etc), and then lead the whole group through Yellowstone, Hebgen earthquake area, then Jackson Hole, before splitting and wrapping it up with our little trek.\n\nOn this trip (or another a year or so before?) the PSU group was joined by Bart Jenks and his wife. Bart taught Mech Eng at PSU and was on crutches or wheelchair because of polio as a kid, but they were doing a camping trip through the west and were with us at White Mtn, Jackson Hole too, when we split up. Impressive to see him get around in the field; inspiring really. Bart worked with me on a mechanical model of the Heart Mtn movement.\n\nJoan Schweinsberger Richarde on the 1975 Alta Experience and a Volcanology Field Trip\n\nI just found the wonderful archive of Field Camp memories.... Thank you for your work on it! I was one of the students in Summer of 1975. The 1974 field camp group had the second part of field camp in Dillon, Montana (after YBRA, Red Lodge) but I think there was a scheduling conflict at Dillon, so Derrill Kerrick & Barry Voight made other plans. For our field camp, we split into two groups after Red Lodge. The group pictured for 1975 chose the Teton Wilderness experience with Dr. Voight. The other group, including myself, drove to Salt Lake City with Dr. Kerrick, to be the first PSU field camp to study the contact metamorphism up at Alta. Once I knew what we'd be studying up at Alta, there was no question which option I'd take! For me Alta was the perfect culmination of field camp... studying everything I loved most -- igneous & metamorphic petrology. It was the perfect textbook example of the P-T changes in mineralogy through the sediment layers that the intrusion intersected.\n\nThat same year, Dr. C.P. Thornton gave a graduate course in Volcanology (Spring 1975), followed by a special field trip looking at igneous & volcanic features in Colorado, Arizona, Southern Utah, Death Valley, & New Mexico. That trip was the most fun & exciting learning experience of my education at Penn State. Only 2 undergrads were admitted to the class and field trip. They were Bob Dickson & myself, Joan Schweinsberger. Because the end of the trip with Dr. Thornton was after the Field Camp group was already on the cross-country trip, Bob & I were dropped off in Kansas City to take a bus up to Minnesota (Duluth I think), to join the Field Camp group enroute.\n\nLooking at the years of pictures at YBRA brought back so many memories. I thought we had taken a photo of the whole group on the porch just like the 1991 picture, but perhaps it got lost along the way. Again thanks for the archive!\n\nIn my professional life, I go by the name Joan Richarde since 1984. I moved to Missoula, Montana in '82, having fallen in love with the West on those two field trips late spring & summer 1975. I'd love to have my email address added to the\n\nlist for Field Camp 1975. If another Red Lodge reunion is ever planned, please let me know...\n\nAll the best,\n\nJoan Richarde\n\nMontana Public Radio, www.mtpr.org\n\nClick on the thumbnails to enlarge the pictures: (thanks to Steve Mellon, Barry Voight, Wayne Narr, Gay Deamer, and Duff Gold for the images)\n\nAlumni Field Camp 1975 Photos\n\nGroup in the Badlands.

One of my memories is of getting a speeding ticket in Red Lodge (I was one of the official drivers) with a van full of slightly inebriated (never) geology students. I paid the Montana State Trooper on the spot.\n\nMy very best memory is of going down in a lead-zinc mine outside Park City, Utah with Dr. Ohmoto. We signed the visitors log and were given an embossed brass tag to put in our coveralls. It matched the number near our signature. When we asked what this was for, we were told, \"in case your body is burned beyond recognition\". That was a great tour!!!\n\nProfessor Gene Williams on Field Camps in Utah in the 1970s\n\nYou asked me to give you some thoughts about my experiences at our Geology Summer Camp held in Alta, Utah, where I was an instructor for several years in the mid 1970s. It is a sobering thought to know that our students there, so young and vibrant, apprehensive at being in the field for the first time in such forbidding terranes, are now well into their professional careers. I cannot remember all their faces or their names, but I can still see them, with their packs and picks, boarding the vans in the morning in the parking lot of the Alta Peruvian Lodge for the trip down Little Cottonwood Canyon to the field area along the Watch Front above Salt Lake City. For them, as well as for their teachers, the moment of truth has finally arrived. For after years of sitting in classroom and laboratory, the student finally gets to face the rocks alone, and will find out how well he or she was instructed and has learned, and whether or not he or she has the capacity to apply such knowledge -- in effect, if he or she has the makings of a geologist. I would hope that experience at Alta provided a solid base for future progress, because the geology of that area was most inspiring and wide-ranging. I have no way of knowing how well they fared, for I have heard from very few.\n\nNow I see, between the partings in the dark clouds of the past, high on the Wasatch Front, small clusters of our students in the process of making their maps. When I approach one of the parties, after much climbing, one of its members comes forward to meet me. He is their leader, not because a vote was taken, but probably because he just took charge naturally. He is not necessarily the brightest or the most aggressive, but somehow had the ability to command, just the way leaders emerged when I was in the military. He had to report the progress of the work, answer my questions, and hear any criticism I might offer. Dividing the students into field parties, although necessary, made it difficult to evaluate the final reports submitted by each student, because so much of the work was a joint effort. I don't think we ever solved this difficulty in grading the final reports.\n\nPeering once again through the mists of the past, I see myself in the basement of the Alta Peruvian Lodge, making drawings on large sheets of brown wrapping paper. Ah!! Now it's all coming back.... I am transcribing my field notes and diagrams to be put on exhibit that evening. They represent the results of observations I had made when I was out visiting the field parties. It demonstrated to the students the kind of observations an experience field geologist would make, and thus set a kind of standard for the next day's work. In effect, the diagrams said, this is what you should have seen today so that you may see more tomorrow. I tried to do this for all the parties I visited so no one party had the advantage.\n\nThe clouds part once again, and I see a small, balding man in the process of giving a lecture in the dining room of the Alta Peruvian. The subject is a report of the U.S. Geological Survey entitled \"Lake Bonneville\" by G K Gilbert. The lecturer is Dr. Larry Lattman, a Professor of Geomorphology at Penn State, and the subject the history of a Pleistocene lake which once occupied a much larger area surrounding the present Great Salt Lake. The next day we will travel to the valley to examine the evidence. For the history of the lake presented by Gilbert is one of the great classical papers in American geology. In addition to providing the student with relevant technical aspects of a subject, it would be desirable if one could illustrate, by example, something which would represent the best of its kind as a way of providing inspiration. Thus the students heard one of the most brilliant lecturers in geology speaking about one of America's greatest geologists and how he worked out the history of Lake Bonneville. It is not necessary that everybody be good, but that there be an example of it somewhere. That was a day, some forty years ago, near Salt Lake City, Utah, where that excellence was both seen and heard. This was a rare treat, not only for the students but for all the faculty as well.\n\nLeft: Gene Williams examining the Wasatch Fault\n\nDuring my thirty years on the faculty at Penn State, I participated, in varying degrees, in Penn State Geology Field Camps. They all had something to offer, but I felt that Alta was the most exciting, not only for excellence of exposure and varietie of problems and history, but also because few, if any, of the faculty were familiar with the geology of the region. So we had to learn along with the students. If effect, we had to teach by example. Standing at the outcrop, facing students and colleagues, one had to \"speak plain French.\" If one could not, they would find you out, and you would lose your influence, to be taken over by another. So there were natural leaders among faculty, just as there were among students. It was for the director of the camp to find this out and to use the staff accordingly. The camp director at Alta, Derrill Kerrick, was excellent in this regard.\n\nAnd now, one final thought. Living in such close quarters with students and colleagues, one quickly learns about their personal and professional strengths and weaknesses, as well as your own, which is probably more important. I will give just one example. Sometime, during my stay at Alta, the camp was visited by Wayne Burnham, the Geoscience Department Head. I was surprised to see him, because I felt that he did not have a high regard for field geology, inasmuch as his field was experimental geochemistry. Well, I was wrong, very wrong. The next day, I was even more surprised when he visited us in the field. I was in the process of visiting one of the field parties mapping faulted alluvial fans high along the front of the Wasatch Range when I saw, far down the valley, a figure climbing up toward us. As he approached, I saw that it was Wayne, huffing and puffing and obviously not in the best of shape. He said to continue on with what we were doing; he would just observe. But after a short while he asked a few pertinent questions and made some critical observations. He had traveled some thousands of miles not just to review our efforts at the camp but to participate and to contribute. Now, I'm really surprised and embarrassed because I realized that in all the years I had known Wayne, I had judged him to be a narrow specialist, and here he was talking about tectonics and sedimentation, my two specialties. For years you can pass your colleagues in the hall or see them in the conference room and really know little about them, a condition that can be corrected by a few days in the field. If I were a chair of a geology department, I think I might require all members to teach Summer Camp at least once, if only for getting them to know and appreciate their colleagues.\n\nAlthough the lengthening years now cast longer shadows on my memories of our summer camp at Alta, I feel that what I have related here is, for the most part, accurate and will remain one of the most pleasing periods of my teaching career, made possible by willing and able students, even though I cannot recall them all individually. It was, indeed, \"a time to remember.\"\n\n---- Gene\n\nClick on the thumbnails to enlarge the images:\n\nAlumni Field Camp 1976 Photos\n\nField camp group in Albion Basin.

One, on the way out, where we (Mark Pawlewicz was the driver) forgot a guy (nice quiet guy) in some dusty little town after a shopping (drinking?) trip. We drove back to the camp. The next morning someone noticed he was missing. We drove back to town that morning and found him sleeping on a bench in front of a closed store. He was really mad, but he told a hilarious story about trying to stay warm with a mangy little stray dog -- the only other living thing in town that night. Contact Pawlewicz; he can tell the story better and probably remembers the forgotten one's name.\n\nSchroder came within an inch of a horrible death after he set loose a landslide of boulders and scree (after we were repeatedly told to keep off the slope). He was chased down the slope by a boulder three times his size. Every time the oblong boulder made a revolution, it would catch him in the back of the legs, looking like it was going to pull him under. We took him to a regional hospital in (Eau Claire?) Wisconsin where he was stitched-up.\n\nI have a few other stories, but they are probably not suitable for the website. One about....\n\nAdditional Comments by Mark Pawlewicz about Penn State Field Camp 1977\n\nPierre's story -- he remembers well but missed a small detail. The missing camper was Joe Taglieri. He helped me with\n\ndriving that year; we did the cross country trip also. The missed connection was in the Black Hills. We had gone in town to see Rushmore. Joe wanted to get a shower, or maybe it was both a shower and laundry. We would have been happy for either. He was my partner on the first exercise, mapping the Wasatch front. I did indeed forget to pick him up, but then no one else noticed he was missing! His story about the evening on a bench was quite funny -- it was in the telling. He had the whole town to himself.\n\nIn your group picture at Albion basin, that is me in the orange hat and no shirt. In the parking lot group photo, Frank Repplier sits on the far left and Kim Thomas (only on cross country trip) is sitting on the blacktop several people to the right. Deane Smith (in the khakis) is on the far right. He was only in camp on the cross country portion. He loved the pegmatites in the Black Hills!\n\nProfessor Gene Williams on Field Camps in Utah in the 1970s\n\nYou asked me to give you some thoughts about my experiences at our Geology Summer Camp held in Alta, Utah, where I was an instructor for several years in the mid 1970s.

Our fearless grad student TA was Dick Craig who survived the cross-country trip both out and back.\n\nThe second night we missed a turn and instead of camping in a state park, we ended up pulling off the road and pitching our tents on grazing land. We all managed to miss the cow pies, but a few unlucky folks pitched their tents on ant mounds(!). So we awoke about an hour later to lots of yelling and swatting. A few ant bite victims slept in the van.....\n\nDean drove our van thru Rocky Mountain National Park along the winding roadway with steep drop-offs. It was hot (no AC), so we had windows down. A huge insect flew in the window and landed on the ceiling right over Dean. The whole crew tried to figure out how to get this thing to fly away so it wouldn't land on Dean (who might just drive off the cliff). We tried to convince him to pull over, but since we'd just started this leg of the trip. and we were the last van, he wouldn't. Finally, one clever person asked for the map of Nebraska. John was riding shotgun and passed the map back in the van. The unusual request got Dean to pull over at the next opportunity (and make a few colorful comments about \"we're in Colorado, so why do you want the @#$%^ map of Nebraska!\"). Dean nearly jumped out of the van when he saw the creature. As soon as the van stopped, the map was used to crush the insect. There were bug guts/limbs flying everywhere! From then on, \"hand me the map of Nebraska\" was used as a warning phrase (we still use it -- our daughter knows this story!)\n\nThe first part of field camp was on the Wasatch Front and was taught by Gene Williams and Derrill Kerrick. The second half at the Albion Basin was taught by Duff Gold and Art Rose. The first project we did (and I have some photos) was mapping the fault-displaced glacial sediments along the Wasatch. Then we did the work across from the Peruvian, and then the work around the stock, including the skarns. We had a trip to the Black Rocks volcanic area, and we also visited the Bingham Canyon copper mine. At Black Rocks we're the group that was nearly thrown out of the Campground.... we were a lot noisier than the Boy Scouts.\n\nDuring the first few days of the Wasatch mapping exercise, most of the students ran out of water very early in the day because we weren't used to the >90 deg. temps/desert environment. One group got really dehydrated one day, so we ignored the \"rule\" and knocked on a door in the development to ask for water. We ended up with cookies and lemonade --- from a geology professor's wife (oops). Needless to say we were ratted on, and the whole camp got a lecture.\n\nIn addition to Derrill's \"lost\" story, another \"lost\" story happened when we switched areas. One morning someone drove the professors to SLC airport, and they left at the same time the vans did. Gloria DePaolis was the driver of the Super Crustum (takeoff on the vehicle brand name Super Custom -- but the crew was the rowdiest... hence the nickname). Gloria was the last driver in the queue that morning and when she got to a key turn, she continued to follow the vehicle with the professors, not the vans going to the field location. She thus earned her own song -- a version of GLORIA (\"she drives the wrong waaay\"). We sang this with great gusto at every opportunity ( including years later!).\n\nOn the first trip up the mountain at Alta, Terry picked up an unexploded shell (from the avalanche guns) and showed it to me [Kate]. I told him to carefully put it right back on the ground... and explained what it was! Terry hadn't notice the sign explaining what they were. We marked the location on our maps and reported it later that day. We were the first to discover one. We thought it was wild to have an icon for bombs on our map legend. Later in the summer we were formally introduced to the \"grey fox\" who ran the gun (and detonated the shell we found). His real name escapes me...\n\nThe Peruvian was terrible the year we were there. It was better sleeping in the campground! The food was a constant complaint. The cook was a real character, one of these scary guys. He really couldn't cook but took offense at every comment about the food. About halfway through the camp someone drove to SLC and bought a bunch of \"real food\" including Captain Crunch, etc. Duff throught that was really funny. The cook was NOT amused, however. At the end of camp a whole group ganged up and threw the cook into the pool! We did call it the \"Peruvian Slodge,\" and even decorated the sign out front with an extra S (see the photo).\n\nI [Kate] didn't go back with the crew, so I'm not sure what the stops were eastbound. I stayed for the IOGOD conference at Snowbird and took Greyhound back, with 3 boxes of rocks as luggage!\n\nProfessor Gene Williams on Field Camps in Utah in the 1970s\n\nYou asked me to give you some thoughts about my experiences at our Geology Summer Camp held in Alta, Utah, where I was an instructor for several years in the mid 1970s. It is a sobering thought to know that our students there, so young and vibrant, apprehensive at being in the field for the first time in such forbidding terranes, are now well into their professional careers. I cannot remember all their faces or their names, but I can still see them, with their packs and picks, boarding the vans in the morning in the parking lot of the Alta Peruvian Lodge for the trip down Little Cottonwood Canyon to the field area along the Watch Front above Salt Lake City. For them, as well as for their teachers, the moment of truth has finally arrived. For after years of sitting in classroom and laboratory, the student finally gets to face the rocks alone, and will find out how well he or she was instructed and has learned, and whether or not he or she has the capacity to apply such knowledge -- in effect, if he or she has the makings of a geologist. I would hope that experience at Alta provided a solid base for future progress, because the geology of that area was most inspiring and wide-ranging. I have no way of knowing how well they fared, for I have heard from very few.\n\nNow I see, between the partings in the dark clouds of the past, high on the Wasatch Front, small clusters of our students in the process of making their maps. When I approach one of the parties, after much climbing, one of its members comes forward to meet me. He is their leader, not because a vote was taken, but probably because he just took charge naturally. He is not necessarily the brightest or the most aggressive, but somehow had the ability to command, just the way leaders emerged when I was in the military. He had to report the progress of the work, answer my questions, and hear any criticism I might offer. Dividing the students into field parties, although necessary, made it difficult to evaluate the final reports submitted by each student, because so much of the work was a joint effort. I don't think we ever solved this difficulty in grading the final reports.\n\nPeering once again through the mists of the past, I see myself in the basement of the Alta Peruvian Lodge, making drawings on large sheets of brown wrapping paper. Ah!! Now it's all coming back.... I am transcribing my field notes and diagrams to be put on exhibit that evening. They represent the results of observations I had made when I was out visiting the field parties. It demonstrated to the students the kind of observations an experience field geologist would make, and thus set a kind of standard for the next day's work. In effect, the diagrams said, this is what you should have seen today so that you may see more tomorrow. I tried to do this for all the parties I visited so no one party had the advantage.\n\nThe clouds part once again, and I see a small, balding man in the process of giving a lecture in the dining room of the Alta Peruvian. The subject is a report of the U.S. Geological Survey entitled \"Lake Bonneville\" by G K Gilbert. The lecturer is Dr. Larry Lattman, a Professor of Geomorphology at Penn State, and the subject the history of a Pleistocene lake which once occupied a much larger area surrounding the present Great Salt Lake. The next day we will travel to the valley to examine the evidence. For the history of the lake presented by Gilbert is one of the great classical papers in American geology. In addition to providing the student with relevant technical aspects of a subject, it would be desirable if one could illustrate, by example, something which would represent the best of its kind as a way of providing inspiration. Thus the students heard one of the most brilliant lecturers in geology speaking about one of America's greatest geologists and how he worked out the history of Lake Bonneville. It is not necessary that everybody be good, but that there be an example of it somewhere. That was a day, some forty years ago, near Salt Lake City, Utah, where that excellence was both seen and heard. This was a rare treat, not only for the students but for all the faculty as well.\n\nLeft: Gene Williams examining the Wasatch Fault\n\nDuring my thirty years on the faculty at Penn State, I participated, in varying degrees, in Penn State Geology Field Camps. They all had something to offer, but I felt that Alta was the most exciting, not only for excellence of exposure and varietie of problems and history, but also because few, if any, of the faculty were familiar with the geology of the region. So we had to learn along with the students. If effect, we had to teach by example. Standing at the outcrop, facing students and colleagues, one had to \"speak plain French.\" If one could not, they would find you out, and you would lose your influence, to be taken over by another. So there were natural leaders among faculty, just as there were among students. It was for the director of the camp to find this out and to use the staff accordingly. The camp director at Alta, Derrill Kerrick, was excellent in this regard.\n\nAnd now, one final thought. Living in such close quarters with students and colleagues, one quickly learns about their personal and professional strengths and weaknesses, as well as your own, which is probably more important. I will give just one example. Sometime, during my stay at Alta, the camp was visited by Wayne Burnham, the Geoscience Department Head. I was surprised to see him, because I felt that he did not have a high regard for field geology, inasmuch as his field was experimental geochemistry. Well, I was wrong, very wrong. The next day, I was even more surprised when he visited us in the field. I was in the process of visiting one of the field parties mapping faulted alluvial fans high along the front of the Wasatch Range when I saw, far down the valley, a figure climbing up toward us. As he approached, I saw that it was Wayne, huffing and puffing and obviously not in the best of shape. He said to continue on with what we were doing; he would just observe. But after a short while he asked a few pertinent questions and made some critical observations. He had traveled some thousands of miles not just to review our efforts at the camp but to participate and to contribute. Now, I'm really surprised and embarrassed because I realized that in all the years I had known Wayne, I had judged him to be a narrow specialist, and here he was talking about tectonics and sedimentation, my two specialties. For years you can pass your colleagues in the hall or see them in the conference room and really know little about them, a condition that can be corrected by a few days in the field. If I were a chair of a geology department, I think I might require all members to teach Summer Camp at least once, if only for getting them to know and appreciate their colleagues.\n\nAlthough the lengthening years now cast longer shadows on my memories of our summer camp at Alta, I feel that what I have related here is, for the most part, accurate and will remain one of the most pleasing periods of my teaching career, made possible by willing and able students, even though I cannot recall them all individually. It was, indeed, \"a time to remember.\"\n\n---- Gene\n\n1978 Penn State Geosciences Field Camp\n\nDerrill Kerrick remembers that in 1978 the students were not happy with the food or the quality of the facilities at the Alta Peruvian Lodge. They took to calling it the Alta Peruvian Slodge (see photo and the recollections of Kate and Dan Chess). At the end of camp they sabotaged the plumbing system with toilet paper, a system that teetered on the edge of functionality in the best of circumstances.\n\nHe also remembers that two students, while mapping on the Alta stock isograds project, lost track of where they were, both on the map and on the ground. They crossed over the ridge between Alta and Snowbird and, by now WAY out of the area, headed down toward Heber City. They somehow ended up in Provo, to which Dick Craig drove and picked them up.\n\nSome additional remarks on the Peruvian over the years\n\nDavid Eggler\n\nAs Derrill and Kate and Dan Chess say in the accompanying pieces, in 1978 the students were not happy with the food or the quality of the facilities at the Alta Peruvian Lodge.\n\nThe field school did not return to the Peruvian until 1981. By then, the facility architecture had changed considerably, much closer to its present configuration. The school subsequently used the Peruvian, except for 1987, through 2000. After 2000, the Peruvian essentially suspended all summer activities. I stayed at the Peruvian from 1984 through 2000, except in 1987 when we stayed in the Alta Lodge up the road. The food ranged from pretty good to very good. For the most part, the cooks were professionals, although we had to deal with our share of summering ski bums. And the \"endless fruit salads\" -- there would be a reception, conference, or wedding at the resort, after which we'd get the excellent leftovers. The leftovers lasted for a meal or two, but the fruit salad would be put in the refrigerator and added to for days and days afterwards, appearing nightly at our meal. On the other hand, for several years, the Peruvian had a Sunday brunch. For a slight premium, we could dine with the \"real people\" on linen tablecloths, with piano music in the background, on an excellent brunch buffet. And on Sunday evenings, although we had to barbecue them ourselves, we'd have burgers and steaks. I have heard rumors that in years past field camp would foot the bill for a keg on weekends.\n\nAlumni from various eras will remember the cast of characters at the resort, including RT, Ed, and Jerry, although sometime in the 1990s the staff became much more \"corporate.\" The characters started with the owner, John Cahir. He would appear occasionally in his Porsche, in his earlier years accompanied by young women and in later years talking up marathons and biking. He also would occasionally treat the faculty, in earlier years, to dinners at his restaurant near the foot of the canyon, La Caille, with its resident peacocks. Those dinners were, unfortunately, before my time.\n\nThe physical facility improved over the years, particularly in the 1990s, when the resort used more professional construction people and fewer summering ski bums. The plumbing system, which dated from the time that a pair of wooden, three-story barracks buildings were hauled up the canyon from the shuttered Bushnell Hospital at Brigham, was reworked several times, although some of the hot/cold faucets were still reversed. The Alta Peruvian is today an excellent and relatively inexpensive place to stay for skiing in some of the most wonderful snow on Earth\n\nClick on the images to enlarge: (thanks to Kate and Dan Chess for the photos)\n\nAlumni Field Camp 1978 Photos\n\nStockdale kimberlite pipe, Kansas\n\nField Camp 1979\n\nStudents\n\nIn 1979 the Geological Sciences degree was changed to Geosciences, and options became the general option, biogeology, and geophysics. The general option and biogeology required Geosc 470, Introduction to Field Geology, during the academic year and summer Geosc 472, Field Geology. A pre-camp cross-country excursion was available as GSc 471. Most of these names are from the database of 1980 Geosciences alumni that, hopefully, is a proxy for 1979 field camp, although some may have attended a year earlier. Some of these alumni, in addition, may have been geophysics option, so would not have attended field camp.

The field camp exercises were all in the Salt Lake area. I specifically recall that the Parleys Canyon exercise required crossing I-80. Having been through Salt Lake City fairly regularly in the last 15 years, I can say that you couldn't cross I-80 on foot now as we did then (leaving aside whether it was prudent to do so even then). I also remember, not fondly, the moraine climb.\"\n\nDave McCarren: \"Many memories of those trips. I took the field trip in '79 and graduated in '79. Mike Reading did also. We were both in ROTC and those summer requirements prevented us from taking the trip in the junior summer. I don't get much of an opportunity to talk about Geology anymore, although I do have a couple friends in the Geology Department here at the University of Delaware that I occasionally get to interact with. After 20 years in the Navy, with 13 as a Naval Oceanographer, my time is mostly spent making sure our biotech researchers can get their projects moving.\"\n\nProfessor Gene Williams on Field Camps in Utah in the 1970s\n\nYou asked me to give you some thoughts about my experiences at our Geology Summer Camp held in Alta, Utah, where I was an instructor for several years in the mid 1970s.
