        "text": "I have a box of letters, a box of photos, a box of dance DVDs, a file box, a box of journals, two boxes of performance programs. And then I have this box. I came across it, unlabeled, while reorganizing my office over the summer, an every-few-years kind of task.\n\nAt first, I couldn’t tell what distinguished this container, a shoebox half-full of dance-related items, from the rest. Why did these materials merit their own storage space? As I examined them one by one, I began to suspect I had set them aside because I didn’t want them to get lost in any other box. Most of them had some relationship to my work, as a dancer and dance writer, and they all carried a little extra charge of personal meaning: ticket stubs from especially moving performances; the badge I wore to get backstage when I toured with Riverdance; my student registration card from the old Merce Cunningham studio, where I would attend the 6pm class after my day job at Dance Magazine. To save my future self from the same confusion, I took a Sharpie and gave the box a name: Dance Past Special.\n\nThe box contains mostly ephemera from shows I danced in or shows I’ve seen, plus a few other artifacts. They don’t correspond to transcendent moments (though there are a few of those) so much as gentle turning points in my life, some of which I wouldn’t see clearly until years later. Sifting through them floods my mind with stories, memories, associations, many long-dormant. I could delve into those here. I could reflect on the evanescence of live performance and these keepsakes as a small rejoinder. But what came over me as I held them in my hands, in the face of so much feeling, was a desire to simply catalogue, to list.\n\nTo that end, what follows is an inventory of what’s in the box (including a few things I added in this summer’s cleaning frenzy), roughly in order of when each item came into my life. I tried to name and date them without description, but I added a few additional details about the item itself or the circumstances of its acquisition, where I felt so moved."
