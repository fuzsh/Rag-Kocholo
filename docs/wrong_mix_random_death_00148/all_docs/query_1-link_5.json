        "text": "First-look rights to the works of late sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick have been acquired by the Halcyon Co., which is planning several features and TV projects from his tales to be made with his estate’s Electric Shepherd Prods.\n\nThe deal gives Halcyon CEOs Victor Kubicek and Derek Anderson access to more than 45 novels and 120 short stories, some of which will be developed with Electric’s Isa Dick Hackett and Laura Leslie, the author’s daughters.\n\nScreen adaptations of Dick’s work, including “Total Recall,” “Minority Report,” “A Scanner Darkly” and “Blade Runner,” have grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.\n\nKubicek and Anderson say the first one or two projects will be announced shortly, aimed for a 2009 release. “His writing is so prescient,” said Kubicek, who cited Dick’s 1969 novel “Ubik” as a work that predicted today’s rampant consumerism.\n\nOther top titles that may receive small- or big-screen treatment include “The Man in the High Castle,” “The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch” and “The Transmigration of Timothy Archer.” Other media ventures, including Web-based projects, also may be developed.\n\nIn May, Halcyon acquired all rights to the “Terminator” franchise and is now planning the TV project “The Sarah Connor Chronicles,” set to air on Fox in January.\n\nRussell Binder of Striker Entertainment and Peter Levin of Bellrock Media helped arrange the deal."
