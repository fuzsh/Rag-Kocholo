        "text": "Amazon’s anthology series Philip K. Dick’s Electric Dreams is adding to its roster.\n\nJanelle Monae (Hidden Figures, Moonlight) and Juno Temple (Vinyl) have signed on to star in one of the episodes of the forthcoming series, which hails from exec producer Bryan Cranston.\n\nThe two will headline the “Autofac” episode, which centers on a massive, automatic product-manufacturing factory that continues to operate according to the principles of consumerism — humans consume products to be happy, despite society and the world as we know it having collapsed. In order to consume continuously, they must be denied freedom of choice and free will. When a small band of rebels decide to shut down the factory, they discover they may actually be the perfect consumers after all.\n\nTemple will play Emily, one of the rebels, while Monae will portray Alexis, an Autofac representative. Jay Paulson (Mad Men) and David Lyons (Revolution) will also appear in the episode. Pacific Rim scribe Travis Beacham wrote the installment, which Peter Horton (Grey’s Anatomy, thirtysomething) will direct.\n\nPhilip K. Dick’s Electric Dreams is a sci-fi anthology series made up of 10 stand-alone episodes inspired by author Philip K. Dick’s renowned short stories. Other writers on the project include including Ronald D. Moore (Battlestar Galactica, Outlander), Michael Dinner (Justified), Tony Grisoni (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas), Jack Thorne (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child), Matthew Graham (Doctor Who), David Farr (The Night Manager), Dee Rees (Mudbound).\n\nMonae and Temple join an impressive cast list that also includes Steve Buscemi, Greg Kinnear, Mireille Enos, Anna Paquin, Terrence Howard, Timothy Spall, Richard Madden, Holliday Grainger, Mel Rodriguez, Vera Farmiga, Jack Reynor, Benedict Wong, Geraldine Chaplin and Cranston.\n\nCranston exec produces the series with Moonshot Entertainment producing partner James Degus, Moore and Maril Davis of Tall Ship Productions, Michael Dinner of Rooney McP Productions, Isa Dick Hackett, Kalen Egan and Christopher Tricarico of Electric Shepherd Productions, David Kanter and Matt DeRoss of Anonymous Content, Lila Rawlings and Marigo Kehoe of Left Bank Pictures, Don Kurt and Kate DiMento. Sony Pictures TV will produce.\n\nOriginally commissioned by the U.K.’s Channel 4 in May 2016, Amazon acquired the U.S. rights to the series in February. The project is expected to debut later this year."
