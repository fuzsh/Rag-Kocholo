        "text": "Philip K. Dick, one of the most visionary practitioners of science fiction in the 20th century experienced a series of quasi-mystical events starting in February 1974 that profoundly altered the course of his life and his work. Known by the shorthand of 2-3-74, these experiences defy rational explanation, something Dick himself would attest to as he spent the remaining 8 years of his life obsessively trying to figure them out. By focusing on Dick's work during and after 2-3-74, the novels A Scanner Darkly (1977), VALIS (1981) and The Divine Invasion (1981), this thesis will argue that the events of 2-3-74 led Dick back from an abyss and gave his work a new direction. Dick's work, so overtly social and political in nature, will provide the backdrop to critically examine the decade of excess, the swinging 60's in America and will show how Dick's fiction had reached the same impasse that the counter-culture had reached in its promises of revolution and a new mode of consciousness in society. Using the works of such cultural theorists as Zygmunt Bauman, Anthony Giddens and Daniel Bell, Dick's vitriolic A Scanner Darkly will reveal the end of the road that Dick was travelling on and VALIS and The Divine Invasion¸ both works which deal with 2-3-74 will help us construct a map for the trajectory that Dick's work took after 2-3-74. Leo Tolstoy's A Confession (1882) will elucidate the universality of Dick's despair and using William James's excellent study, The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902) as a backdrop, the thesis will also compare Dick's experiences with those of Carl Jung, who's experiments with his own unconscious, documented in Liber Novus (2009) have finally seen the light of day after almost a century of secrecy and who's analytic experiments bore similar fruit to Dick's own metanoia.\n\nThis paper demonstrates the question of utopia and dystopia, the issues of human conflicts with technology, deterioration of society and nature vis-à-vis fanciful technological worlds, dystopian dominance of technology over humans, and searching for redemption in Philip K. Dick’s novels. It also says about disadvantages of mechanization of life and high-technology as a disastrous advancement which leads to dystopian world. Technology is known as a double-edged sword and human usually thinks about the beneficial and utopia-making edge of it, but Dick’s novels show his fears of war, social failure, emerging of military technology and political struggles; and he portrays turning of life which is looking for a utopia into a dystopia on the other edge of this sword.\n\nPhilip K. Dick was one of the most prolific and influential SF authors of the 20th century. However, Dick’s literary success did not come without major biographical pitfalls. While Dick published thirty-nine novels in his lifetime, many of which were ground-breaking, radical reimaginings of the SF genre (such as Ubik, The Man in the High Castle and Martian Time-Slip) many were trashy, underdeveloped and rushed (Vulcan’s Hammer, Dr. Futurity, and Our Friends from Frolix 8). On closer inspection, this literary division corresponds closely to issues in Dick’s own personal life. Dick was a torn individual. On the one hand he was a literary-SF genius who pushed the boundaries of the genre by redefining postmodernism as a spiritual phenomenon (as in Ubik, A Scanner Darkly and Do Android Dream of Electric Sheep?). On the other hand, he was an alienated failure who had numerous mainstream works rejected for publication. Interestingly his moments of literary genius correspond to high points in his life when he was doing well with family, friends and spouses, and his trashy lows link closely to struggles with amphetamine abuse, the death of friends and psychotic episodes. This paper will address the fluctuating mental health of Philip K. Dick by deconstructing the narrative dynamics of A Scanner Darkly and VALIS. I will show how these texts represent forms of biographical self-exploration where Dick addresses the material causes of psychological ill-health in postmodernity (and himself), at the same time as generating transcendent salvific responses to fragmentation and alienation through creating his own postmodern theologies."
