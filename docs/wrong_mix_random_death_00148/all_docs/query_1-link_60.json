Dick's novels have inspired many films like Minority Report and Total Recall. But the most famous adaptation is Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, starring Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, hunting rogue \"replicants.\"\n\n2️⃣ Director's Perspective: Ridley Scott never read the book \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" on which Blade Runner is based. He found it too dense! 📚\n\n3️⃣ Author's Reaction: Philip K. Dick initially hated the script but later appreciated the rewrite by David Webb Peoples. 🎬\n\n4️⃣ Alternate Endings: The original theatrical ending was happy, using outtakes from Stanley Kubrick's The Shining! 🌄\n\n5️⃣ Audience Reactions: Test audiences hated the movie at first. A voice-over was added, but Harrison Ford wasn't a fan of it. 🎤\n\n6️⃣ Deckard's True Identity: Ridley Scott confirmed that Rick Deckard is a replicant. 🤖\n\n7️⃣ The Blade Runner Curse: Companies whose logos appeared in the film, like Atari and Pan Am, faced major business issues soon after. 📉\n\nBlade Runner is a sci-fi masterpiece with a fascinating history!
