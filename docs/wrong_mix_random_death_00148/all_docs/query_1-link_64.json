        "text": "“Faith of Our Fathers”\n\nby\n\nPhilip K. Dick\n\nOn the streets of Hanoi he found himself facing a legless peddler who rode a little wooden cart and called shrilly to every passer-by. Chien slowed, listened, but did not stop; business at the Ministry of Cultural Artifacts cropped into his mind and deflected his attention: it was as if he were alone, and none of those on bicyles and scooters and jet-powered motorcycles remained. And likewise it was as if the legless peddler did not exist.\n\n“Comrade,” the peddler called however, and pursued him on his cart; a helium battery operated the drive and sent the cart scuttling expertly after Chien. “I possess a wide spectrum of time-tested herbal remedies complete with testimonials from thousands of loyal users; advise me of your malady and I can assist.”\n\nChien, pausing, said, “Yes, but I have no malady.” Except, he thought, for the chronic one of those employed by the Central Committee, that of career opportunism testing constantly the gates of each official position. Including mine.\n\n“I can cure for example radiation sickness,” the peddler chanted, still pursuing him. “Or expand, if necessary, the element of sexual prowess. I can reverse carcinomatous progressions, even the dreaded melanomae, what you would call black cancers.” Lifting a tray of bottles, small aluminum cans and assorted powders in plastic jars, the peddler sang, “If a rival persists in trying to usurp your gainful bureaucratic position, I can purvey an ointment which, appearing as a dermal balm, is in actuality a desperately effective toxin. And my prices, comrade, are low. And as a special favor to one so distinguished in bearing as yourself I will accept the postwar inflationary paper dollars reputedly of international exchange but in reality damn near no better than bathroom tissue.” Continue reading ““Faith of Our Fathers” — Philip K. Dick” →\n\n“Piper in the Woods”\n\nby\n\nPhilip K. Dick\n\nFirst published in Imagination: Stories of Science and Fantasy, February 1953 and made available via Project Gutenberg.\n\n“Well, Corporal Westerburg,” Doctor Henry Harris said gently, “just why do you think you’re a plant?”\n\nAs he spoke, Harris glanced down again at the card on his desk. It was from the Base Commander himself, made out in Cox’s heavy scrawl: Doc, this is the lad I told you about. Talk to him and try to find out how he got this delusion. He’s from the new Garrison, the new check-station on Asteroid Y-3, and we don’t want anything to go wrong there. Especially a silly damn thing like this!\n\nHarris pushed the card aside and stared back up at the youth across the desk from him. The young man seemed ill at ease and appeared to be avoiding answering the question Harris had put to him. Harris frowned. Westerburg was a good-looking chap, actually handsome in his Patrol uniform, a shock of blond hair over one eye. He was tall, almost six feet, a fine healthy lad, just two years out of Training, according to the card. Born in Detroit. Had measles when he was nine. Interested in jet engines, tennis, and girls. Twenty-six years old.\n\n“Well, Corporal Westerburg,” Doctor Harris said again. “Why do you think you’re a plant?”\n\nThe Corporal looked up shyly. He cleared his throat. “Sir, I am a plant, I don’t just think so. I’ve been a plant for several days, now.”\n\n“I see.” The Doctor nodded. “You mean that you weren’t always a plant?”\n\n“No, sir. I just became a plant recently.”\n\n“And what were you before you became a plant?”\n\n“Well, sir, I was just like the rest of you.”\n\nThere was silence. Doctor Harris took up his pen and scratched a few lines, but nothing of importance came. A plant? And such a healthy-looking lad! Harris removed his steel-rimmed glasses and polished them with his handkerchief. He put them on again and leaned back in his chair. “Care for a cigarette, Corporal?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\nThe Doctor lit one himself, resting his arm on the edge of the chair. “Corporal, you must realize that there are very few men who become plants, especially on such short notice. I have to admit you are the first person who has ever told me such a thing.”\n\n“Yes, sir, I realize it’s quite rare.”\n\n“You can understand why I’m interested, then. When you say you’re a plant, you mean you’re not capable of mobility? Or do you mean you’re a vegetable, as opposed to an animal? Or just what?”\n\nThe Corporal looked away. “I can’t tell you any more,” he murmured. “I’m sorry, sir.”\n\n“Well, would you mind telling me how you became a plant?”\n\nCorporal Westerburg hesitated. He stared down at the floor, then out the window at the spaceport, then at a fly on the desk. At last he stood up, getting slowly to his feet. “I can’t even tell you that, sir,” he said.\n\n“You can’t? Why not?”\n\n“Because—because I promised not to.”\n\nContinue reading “Read “Piper in the Woods,” Philip K. Dick’s early short story about men turning into plants” →"
