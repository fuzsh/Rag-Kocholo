        "text": "Hello Pat,\n\nI was born in the Bronx in 1961 and we lived on Bronx Blvd. I attended Immaculate Conception School until 1970, when we moved to Germany.\n\nDoes anybody remember the candy store on Carpenter Ave. called Bernies?\n\nMy grandparents lived on Olinville Ave. Does anybody have a connection to the above?\n\nUnfortunately I do not remember much, as I was so young when we moved away. I was also born in the Royal Hospital, somebody mentioned here. So it burnt down? How can a hospital burn down?\n\nDoes anybody remember St. Marys Church? I believe that's gone as well. Tell me, how can a church get shut down or torn down?\n\nOn Bronx Blvd. there stood a beautiful white mansion with long pillars in front of it. Where did it go?\n\nEven tho I was ripped away from the Bronx in 1970, when I was 8 years and 8 months old... I do remember a little here and there...\n\nThe icecream truck, playing in the park across the street, the almost blind man who would show us tricks, some of my neighbors and their names, my piano teacher, a snow blizzard, getting stuck in the deep snow with my boots, not being able to get out. I remember my skates and they sure were heavy. When I took them off, my feet would still vibrate...\n\nI only wish I had a time machine. I would go back in time.\n\nMy mom and I always reminisce and try to look up information on the internet. Well rite now I am sitting here with tears in my eyes. Like I said, just give me a time machine. Please.\n\nIf any of this, rings a bell, it would be great to hear from you. I will see, if anybody hopefully, left a message.\n\nMany thanks!My Name is JOHN RICHMOND .I will love to share my testimony to all the people in the forum cos i never thought i will have my girlfriend back and she means so much to me..The girl i want to get marry to left me 4 weeks to our wedding for another man..,When i called her she never picked my calls,She deleted me on her facebook and she changed her facebook status from engage to Single...when i went to her place of work she told her boss she never want to see me..I lost my job as a result of this cos i cant get myself anymore,my life was upside down and everything did not go smooth with my life...I tried all i could do to have her back to all did not work out until i met a Man when i Travel to Africa to execute some business have been developing some years back..I told him my problem and all have passed through in getting her back and how i lost my job...he told me he gonna help me...i don't believe that in the first place.but he swore he will help me out and he told me the reason why my girlfriend left me and also told me some hidden secrets.i was amazed when i heard that from him..he said he will cast a spell for me and i will see the results in the next couple of days..then i travel back to Germany the following day and i called him when i got home and he said he's busy casting those spells and he has bought all the materials needed for the spells,he said am gonna see positive results in the next 2 days that is Thursday...My girlfriend called me at exactly 12:35pm on Thursday and apologies for all she had done ..she said,she never knew what she's doing and her sudden behavior was not intentional and she promised not to do that again.it was like am dreaming when i heard that from her and when we ended the call,i called the man and told him my my girl friend called and he said i haven't seen anything yet... he said i will also get my job back in 3 days time..and when its Sunday,they called me at my place of work that i should resume work on Monday and they gonna compensate me for the time limit i have spent at home without working..My life is back into shape,i have my girlfriend back and we are happily married now with a baby boy and i have my job back too.This man is really powerful..if we have up to 20 people like him in the world,the world would have been a better place..he has also helped many of my friends to solve many problems and they are all happy now..Am posting this to the forum for anybody that is interested in meeting the man for help.you can mail him uzorspelltemple@gmail.com I cant give out his number cos he told me he don't want to be disturbed by many people across the world..he said his email is okay and he also have a web site if you want to visit him there' he will replied to any emails asap..hope he helped u out too..good luck. his web site is/ www.uzorspelltemple.webs.comTo Joel Rosenberg, There was a Yeshiva Boys school (Yeshiva Zichron Moshe), that was on 167th St. and Morris Ave., that moved into Temple Zion in 1969. I started Kindergarten there at that time. They were there for a few years until around 1974 when the school moved to Pelham Parkway. I lived in the next building. The synagogue stayed open for another 15 years or so, even though in the 1970's, the neighborhood started going downhill. Co-op City opened and many people moved there. The last Rabbi at Temple Zion, which was now called Congregation Zichron Moshe, was Rabbi Michael Rosenberg. He worked tirelessly to make sure that there would be a place for people to pray, even when the building was sold and we had to move, our landlord was nice enough to give us a small room in one of his other buildings about seven blocks away. Eventually, there weren't enough people to make the quorum and the synagogue closed and eventually liquidated. The area at that time, was still better than the side streets. At this time There are some people who are buying Co-ops in the Yankee Stadium area, because they want to be near Manhattan. Many good wishes.I was looking up Dr. Leff, because my brother and I were born at the maternity hospital on the Concourse, and I was curious about the scandal that closed it down. The search led to this site where I found kindred spirits since I have the same fond feelings as Pat about my childhood home. I lived on the corner of Walton Ave. and 172nd St. and went to PS 64. My memories include; Saturday afternoons at the Surrey movie theater on Mt Eden, Charlotte Russes and warm rye bread from the Garden and Friedhoffers bakeries on 170th St, sprinklers at Claremont Park on a hot day, the penny candy store on Townsend near PS 64, the pool on Jerome Ave., and Olinsky's supermarket where my uncle was a part owner. Milk and seltzer got delivered right to the door of our walk up apt. and my mother would throw money out the window for Bungalow Bar ice cream and the whip and merry-go-round rides on a trucks that parked in front of our building on a regular basis. One very interesting memory is entertainers singing to accordian music performing in the back courtyard of our U shaped building where there were clothes lines strung every which way from kitchen windows. The housewives would show their appreciation by throwing change wrapped in tissues from the windows. People looked out for each other and everything you wanted was right in your neighborhood unlike the suburbs we fled to in the early 60's. 1960's When school was called off we would find ourselves sleigh-riding down 197st ending at Decatur Ave. It was a two block slide with a right turn, an iron fence kept you from flying off the road and directed you toward a wall or on coming traffic... a mound of snow was the target that slowed you down and hopefully stopped the ride. Parents could watch from the windows as we stayed out into the night... no fear!\n\nThought I would share about a street not posted about... but I too had ties to the Concourse and those beautiful building. Anyone remember Sol's, a fruit and vegetable store across from Poe Park, on Kingsbridge? I was the delivery boy (Dave) and knew what the insides of those buildings looked like as I made deliveries to most of them.\n\nNearby was my pick for \"best pizza\"... Vinnie's. I recall my 18th birthday there with the guys - the celebration was a mistake... I had been drinking there since I was 15 and Vinnie asked how old I was...\n\nFordham Road had a little burger place next to the RKO that made the burgers on a grill in the window. Anyone remember the name of that place? First time I ever had a cherry coke was there.\n\nIt is amazing how a couple of blocks made a neighborhood and formed a community... now we look back and we realize how much we all were alike. The Bronx taught ya how to be what you became... enjoy!Wow! This is amazing! I moved to the Bronx in 1961. W188st, I believe. The building backed on 'The Aqui' the aqueduct that was lined with benches and bike riders and kids playing. One block off Fordham Rd. St Nicholas of Tolentine was just a bock away as well. I went to PS 33 briefly. I remember it had turrets. Then on to EBB. I remember Mr Liebner and Ms Fox. Mrs Gilmour was my English teacher but died of lung cancer, as I recall. We moved to 1928 loring pl, a block off Burnside Ave and near NYU campus. And the hall of fame that you can still see from the Deegan. On real hot days, my younger brother and me would walk across the bridge from Fordham\n\nRd to a pool. Miramar? I can't remember. After all day in the pool we would walk home. That has to a 2 mile hike\n\nAnd all up hill. I think about it now and wonder how we did it. My family briefly owned a candy store on Burnside Ave and loring place called Mac's. I remember walking home alone at about midnight from the Beatles Concert in Shea. My only concession to the time was to take the stairs up from the Tremont sta and not use the underpass.\n\nI had moved to E 176 at then. It was 1966 and suddenly, without warning, the Bronx we all knew and loved started to disintegrate. My father became ill and in my senior year at Walton HS I moved upstate. I ended up on this site because I decided to look up my old grade school, St Dominic's, on the 1600 block of White Plains Road. Lo and behold, it closed its doors in Jan of 2011 :-( So sad! I actually remember when they built the \"new\" auditorium at St Dominic's and Sr Justina was the name of the nun I had in kindergarten. Van Nest Park was located right across the street. I used to play there as a child, back in the early 50s. There was a great concrete sand box, what seemed like huge monkey bars, swings, a slide, and a teeter-totter. I just read that the \"old\" park equipment was replaced, back in the 90s. I saw pictures on line and for sure the old equipment was a lot cooler than what they put in. There was also a great little luncheonette across the street from the Park, on the Van Nest side, called Baldi's. I used to go there and buy a coke every now and then. They would serve it in a paper cone shaped cup that was placed inside an aluminum holder. Crazy, right? I wonder where Mr Baldi and his family are now. The whole neighborhood was very Italian back then. Everyone was from the \"old country\" including my parents. I was first generation, born at Westchester Hospital. That was the American Dream. We lived about a block away from the park, in a cool little brick building with 3 apartments: 1733 White Plains Rd. Mr Brunetti owned the building and operated the barbershop on the main floor. He and his wife had 2 sons and they owned a gorgeous black & white collie who would peacefully sit, guarding the door. Her name was Beauty. I forget the last name of the family that lived on the top floor. They also had 2 sons, Alfie & Renny. Alfie was closer to my age, so we played together a lot. I remember actually being allowed to walk to the A & P by myself. It was about a block away and I had to cross Morris Park by myself to get there! We moved to the Jersey Shore the summer before I entered 3rd grade. I loved having a yard with grass and being allowed to ride my bike everywhere, but I still have good memories of my very first home and my first school back on White Plains Rd. And I'm glad I can say I'm from the Bronx! Thank you, Pat Morgan, for letting me take this trip down memory lane.\n\nI spent the first 6-7 years of my life in the Bronx, first on Valentine and then Mace Avenue before moving to the suburbs but it is my grandparents' apt on Walton that I remember most. Unfortunately, I could not recall the exact address and everyone who would have known had passed away but a few summers ago while recovering from surgery I had time on my hands and starting researching. Then I called the NY Public Library, 42nd Street branch (I've lived in Boston over 40 years)and found they have phone directories on microfilm from all the boroughs going back decades so on a trip to NY I went in person and found the exact address. Finally, on a recent trip into the city I schlepped up the Bx and walked over to 2195 Walton, much the same color brick as your apt, Pat, and with the exterior fire escapes. There is now a gate with a buzzer system so I couldn't get closer to the building but I took many pictures before winding my way up to the Grand Concourse and walking by many landmarks like Loew's Paradise and the Dollar Savings where I had my first passbook account. Of course, Alexander's is gone and Fordham Road is very different as are the stores on the GC. Krums and Jahns and Zaro's are all gone replaced by other places, but as I walked up towards Kingsbridge Road through Poe Park, I felt that I had returned home in a very nostalgic way. Your pictures are far better than anything I took, but it triggered so many happy memories and made me make the pilgrimage in person, so thank you, Pat, for spurring me on and for the photo gallery that I look back on every time I'm feeling a little down. Vive The Bronx!Edward Henn\n\nBorn Oct. 1943 in Westchester Square Hospital. My parents and the 10 kids lived at 3065 Roberts Avenue, Apt. #C, just across from P.S. 71 in the Pelham Bay area. The 12 of us lived in a 3-bedroom, 1 bath apartment. That's right..ONE BATH! But the neighborhood was wonderful. Attended O.L.A. (Our Lady of the Assumption) across Bruckner Blvd off Country Club Road. This was just after the war and hardly anyone owned a car. So we kids would play in the gutter all day long. Or in the empty lots or on somebody's stoop. Despite the fact that much of the Bronx went downhill in the 60's and 70's, our old neighborhood wasn't affected by the downturn. Recently, Pelham Bay was listed as one of the top 10 areas to live in NYC. Good schools, friendly environment, easy access to the park are some reasons why. We left in 1951 when I was nearly 8 years old. We moved to Huntington, Long Island. I thought I would never recover leaving my beloved Bronx. Now retired from the post office, I travel all over the country. Believe it or not, twice a year I drive all the way To the Bronx just for a visit. Just this past April I was able to rent a house for 1 week on Crosby Avenue. Well my God, I am rejuvenated. Next time I hope it's for a lot longer. I came upon this sight after reading Avery Corman's book about his old neighborhood around the concourse. A delightful tale for all us Bronxites, a trip down memory lane.Wow, this is a great site! Thank you for sharing the pictures! I loved reading everyone's stories. My parents grew up in the Bronx (Arthur Ave section) and moved to Pelham Parkway in the late 70's when I was around 2 years old. We lived at 780 Pelham Parkway south for about 19 years. I would love to know if anyone from my old building is on here. There was a lady named Loretta who was a pianist and gave me lessons in her apartment. She was eccentric and talented and wore flowing scarves and clothing. There was an old Jewish couple that used to keep lollipops for me, because I was the only child in the building. Rumor had it that another old couple had a daughter who was a concert pianist. We all knew each other back in the 80's and looked out for each other. The building was beautiful with stained glass windows and the custodian and porter put up a Christmas tree and menorah with lights in the lobby every year. We were just 2 blocks from the 2 and 5 train, with easy access to anywhere. Anyone remember these stores: Say Yogurt, Camera Stop, Popcorn and Movies, Showtime video (when you had to walk to the store and rent a video, The yarn/knitting store where Florence gave directions to make sweaters, etc., Bothsides clothing store, Disco City, (toy store), Six Brothers Diner, Royals, (Hallmark store)Joshap (Sp?) Ice cream store, U Save, MDS, (kids clothing) .... I wish I had taken some pictures back then. You don't realize how important it will be! Thanks again for sharing :) My family & I moved to the South Bronx in 1966. I remember because my younger brother was born right after we moved there...at the time it was a very nice area (163rd St. between Kelly St. & Tiffany St.). Then around 1969 most of the Landlords around the neighborhood (sorry but they all were Jewish Landlords) started burning down their own property while tenants were still living inside these buildings. My family were also robbed approximately 3 times while living there. I remember the last time our apartment was broken in while we were out visiting family, we when return home we had a big hole in our living room wall, because next door to our apartment was vacant. They robbers took almost everything we possessed (which wasn't much) but it was a lot to us at the time. Overall, we started hearing fire trucks almost every night, about 2 to 3 times a night. It was burning down all around that neighborhood. In 1972 our father got killed (stabbed in a bar while on the telephone by a gang member because he thought my father was a gang rival) in the neighborhood on Intervale Ave. So we moved in with our Aunt who had six children already, my mom had four so we slept all over that apartment but we were safe. In the meantime, my mom was waiting for our new apt. to be ready...in 1973 we moved in the Davidson Housing(just built) which is located on Home St./Union Ave./& Prospect Ave. the building circulates around those streets (its a very large building). We no longer live there but our ties are there until this very day...we call it the Ranch. Until this very day we still go visit and have old timers day & stay connected...even a lot of the original people who lived there moved away some out of state or even out of the country, but we all join up together from time to time & coe back to the South Bronx...Summertime is the greatest time to meet up forty-one years (41 yrs.) of friendship. Can't beat that, its a beautiful thing...we have at least 3 generations that know each other and meet up with each other every year...that's why I love the South Bronx & it's my history. Right now I live in Harlem where I was born and raise before moving to the Bronx, but I'm not to far away, I can walk across the bridge and I'm in the BX baby. That's my story... I hope you like it.This is a wonderful site, so thank you so much. I spent the first 11 years of my life at 1430 Plimpton Avenue. I attended PS 104 until 1958 when we moved to Rockland County. A few years ago I took a walk down memory lane and was sad to see 1430 was gone. PS 104 - gone or at least not in use. I remembered Plimpton Ave. as being longer but so much had changed. I used to roller skate down the street and loved the corner candy store which I believe also had a soda fountain in it. Had so much fun in the building jumping down the stairs. We lived in apartment 6K and the elevator was always getting stuck and the fire dept. would come to free us. Names I remember from 1430: Siegel, Furst, Gade or Glade, Sheffler, Popkin, Kiley (not sure of all the spellings). My second grade teacher was Mrs. Muller (I loved her). I also remember that up until grade 5 we had wonderful puppet shows at the school. Used to wear a navy skirt and white blouse with navy tie once a week for auditorium. I was able to wave to my mom during our recess in the school yard. Anyway, I am sorry for rambling, but it brings back so many memories. Would love to see a post from someone else from 1430. Regards. Ed Kosow,\n\nI noticed you wrote that in 1966 you remember a tragic car accident that killed a pedestrian close to school, PS 70. I am currently trying to help one of my good friends whom was adopted, find his biological parents and all he knows is his mom's first name is Milagros, he knows his original last name but has been unable to obtain his original birth certificate since it is sealed. He is also aware that his father was killed in a tragic car accident in the month of either november or december of 1966, his father passed away 2 months before his birth. I have been trying to do a diligent search to find newspaper articles that might state the man's name that was killed in that accident to see if that might possibly be my friend's biological father. Do you happen to remember what month that car accident took place? i know it might be far fetched but do you happen to remember a name of the victim? or where i would be able to obtain a newspaper article from then to do my own research. thank you so much. i hope to hear from someone soon. we'd be eternally grateful. please feel free to email me with further information at sylera.caban@gmail.comI was just checking some of the rest of the comments down the list.\n\nTo Howard toward the bottom of the list. I had a couple with the name Lebzelter in my building at 1939 Grand Concourse.\n\nI believe that those were their names. They lived on the 4th floor, right below me.\n\nThey were very nice. They moved to queens after a while.\n\nAt that time, the Concourse wasn't as grand as it used to be, although the buildings were still pretty nice, the neighborhood was changing.\n\nI remember lots of things from those years:\n\nWoolworths on Burnside Avenue, where they sold (live) pet fish and birds and the food counter, where you could eat something.\n\nThe kosher butcher shop on 183rd St. near Jerome Avenue,\n\nwhere nothing was packaged and they cut the meat to your specifications.\n\nThe kosher deli on 183rd and the Concourse called Smoot Bros. Deli.\n\nI loved getting a frankfurter there, every Sunday.\n\nMy Bar Mitzvah in 1977 in the old Temple Zion was one of the last things they catered.\n\nThe theatre on Jerome and Tremont Avenue.\n\nHow the police would close off the center of the Concourse on Sundays during the summer, when there was no Yankee home game, so we could ride our bikes, from one end of the Concourse to the other.\n\nThe Carvel ice cream store is still there on 182nd Street and the Concourse.\n\nShipman's, which I believe was next to Krums candy on Fordham Road and sold art supplies and things.\n\nThey moved downtown 2 blocks and soon closed.\n\nThe barber shop on Burnside Avenue near Creston Avenue, where as a child you got a lollipop after your haircut.\n\nNinth Federal Savings Bank on Burnside Avenue and Walton Avenue, where many of us had our first bank accounts.\n\nIt is gone many years now.\n\nThe A&P or Grand Union supermarket on the Concourse near 181st Street where you could smell the fresh ground coffee they sold, which was 2 doors away from the Daitch supermarket.\n\nThe Adler Shoe store on the corner of Fordham Road and the Concourse, near the Dollar Savings Bank.\n\nI hope you remember these things too.\n\nHopefully, more to come. It's good to reminisceI grew up on 2295 Morris Avenue at 183rd Street on the third floor of a walk up building in the mid to late 60's.\n\nI moved to the Concourse & Tremont in the early 1970's, in an Art Deco building. I lived there until 2005, when I got married and moved to Washington Heights. When I moved, the rent was at least triple what it was when I moved in.\n\nBy the way, the building that was blue on the Concourse at Echo place near Tremont, wasn't always blue. It was the Yeshiva (elementary school) I started in, Yeshiva Zichron Moshe, which was previously on 167th Street and Morris Avenue, since Morris crossed to the other side of the concourse near Mt. Eden.\n\nThe Yeshiva on the Concourse also had a Synagogue. It was originally called Temple Zion and they used to have weddings there, before my time.\n\nIn the mid 1970's the Yeshiva moved to Pelham Parkway at Wallace and Brady Avenue and closed about 4 years later.\n\nNo neighborhood can compare to the bronx, with its parks, stores, the Concourse and many other things, even today.\n\nUnfortunately, my old neighborhood has gotten worse, but there are still some nice parts of the bronx.\n\nLet's try to bring back the Bronx, for old times sake and new times.I remember my father buying the tree from the freight yard in bundles of 3, and giving my two grandmothers the nice ones and always getting the skinny crummy one. I was born in the Bronx,at home (not of course by choice)and while being taken out on a stretcher the fist person who saw me was the cat lady (you all remember the (every street had one) woman that would put tins of cat food under the car tires causing flats). Almost giving my father a heart attack. Feral cats running around the stretcher. I remember Tony the butcher on Tremont Ave with the ceramic cow in the window and him putting me in there with it. Fish market next store,with loads of cats in the alley way. Normas toy store. Echo park and sleigh riding, pony rides at Van Cortlandt, going to the Gates of Heaven and seeing people getting off of the train with picnic baskets. The Zoo, Fordum Road shopping. Going to bed on summer nights and listening to kids still playing and hearing the murmurs of the old peoples voices sitting in front of the apartment building because it was to hot in there apartments to sleep. Or how about when you were on the train and you would see people sleeping on mattresses on the fire escapes. Being able to run down the subway stairs on one side of the concourse and come up on the other side of the street. The apartment building on the Concourse with the indoor swimming pool that you could look in the ground floor windows and watch them swim. Every body knowing one another, and neighborhoods being like extended family's. There were no real secrets living in such close proximities to each other. My father lived at 1911 Anthony Ave his father was a police sergeant in the Bronx. His name was Joseph McMahon. Wow, I found your site quite by accident but i am so happy that i did. I got so full of emotion to see the old neighborhood again. I grew up on the Grand Concourse. i remember cooling off on hot summer days in the fire hydrant. My uncle was the super at 2815 Grand Concourse. So we had a ball in the basement. To a little kid, a building basement was a virtual wonderland. There were so many things to discover. When i think of the number of times that my sister and I nearly killed ourselves with new \"game\" ideas. I wish we could stay kids forever. Our building was old so it still had working dumbwaiters. That was a treat just to watch my uncle pull the rope to send the little elevator up to the different floors for all the shut-in senior citizens to send their garbage down.\n\nWe all had such a care free life back then. I remember them closing the Concourse for parades. I remember attending St. Philip Neri church on Bedford Park. In fact, i think i was the first black altar boy the church ever had. And Boy do i remember Tony's Pizzaria on Bedford Park. They had the best pizza in the whole world. Till this day, i still hold every slice of pizza to Tony's Pizzaria standard. They made their pies the old fashion way. They even had the old manual metal cash registers with the little tabs that popped up when you pressed a key. Oh man i miss those days.\n\nThank you so much for the pictures. I remember each and every picture on this site. I passed by each and every one of those buildings on a regular basis while growing up. I Went to PS 46 and Our Lady of Refuge across the street, then St. Philip Neri elementary school. Then Cardinal Hayes HS and then Lehman College. Hung out at Tracey Towers. Oh my goodness we had fun. Those were definitely the days. I wish we could stay young forever.\n\nThanks again for the memories.Thanks For The Memories... Does anyone remember the cadet corp on Jerome Ave and 170th St. I was a Cadet which briefly cured my hunger to serve my country as my mom, dad, aunt and uncles did in WWII, Korea, and Vietnam. Unfortunately my health would not allow me to join :(\n\nI was began my journey from Manhattan to the Bronx in 1966, My parents moved to 147th and Bergan Ave in 1966 two years after my birth. We then moved to 1437 College Ave until my parents divorced. I lived on College Ave from 1968 until 1973. I remember Sunshine Grocery Store, Bob and Marty's Meat Market on 170th's Street. My mother and me later moved to 1571 Sheridan Ave. I lived there until she passed in 1989, I later relocated to NC in 1992. I remember attending Beth Miriam Jacob Pre-School on Mt. Eden which later became a Head Start Program. I attended PS (CES)70 on Weeks Ave, later I attended St. Simon Stock and Sacred Heart Middle School; I spent one year at Academy of Mt.St. Ursula as well as Harry S. Truman HS. I completed W.H. Taft in 1982. My mother was an assistant teacher at PS 53 from the early 70's until the early 80's when she began working at Jr. HS 117. (The Way We Were) I recall how the Grand Concourse was once the cleanest classiest part of the Bronx,next to Madison and 5th if one wants to be technical. My best times were going to the movie theater on Mt. Eden, I recall seeing \"True Grit, Funny Girl and Lady, Oliver, To Sir With Love etc. Let's not forget to mention the Lowes Paradise on near Fordham Rd showing ET and by the early 80's the theater gun fights due to uncivilized immature new comers. Best place to shop... everyone shopped at Alexanders or Lohmens. The good old days. Anyone remember the Grand Concourse Bakery near Yankee Stadium... I need some Prune Danishes. I have not been home in over 20+ years. I would like to thank the owner of this site for...\" And Remember 1975.....\n\nGood morning, yesterday\n\nYou wake up and time has slipped away\n\nAnd suddenly it's hard to find\n\nThe memories you left behind\n\nRemember, do you remember?\n\nThe laughter and the tears\n\nThe shadows of misty yesteryears\n\nThe good times and the bad you've seen\n\nAnd all the others in between\n\nRemember, do you remember\n\nThe times of your life?

MY MY MY!!! So cool to have stumbled here. My Grandparents were living in the Bronx in the 30's till the early 40's all the time...then end of the 50's only part of the time(they had a country home by then). I was born in Manhattan and then moved to 1695 Grand Concourse around 1958. My Grandparents lived at 1684 Grand Concourse!!! We left in 1962 and moved to the suburbs in CT., my Dad continued commuting to the city on the Metro total 'MAD MEN'...HA!!! Everything mentioned here pretty much I can relate to. I miss the food the walking and the architectural beauty. MISS ALEXANDERS...AND SUZANNE'S SHOPPING!!! I lived in the Bronx again a couple of times a grown up (with my sister) as my daughter got a Dance scholarship to the Bronx Theater of Dance and went to Moshulu in 8th grade...I worked at a couple of diners!!! I moved back again alone in 1996 to Weschester...where I worked in White Plains as a Headhunter in the mortgage biz.,..loved it!!! Last time to 'my home'...was a short time around 03 visited my sister who always lived in the same apt. across from the Woodlawn Cemetery! FABULOUS PLACE!! miss it think of it love it!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH AND HELLO EVERYBODY!!!I found this site googling Bronx Art Deco. A New York friend of mine said he was taking a tour of Art Deco San Francisco and I said he should see The Bronx First.\n\nI spent 1949-1964 at College Avenue and 167 St, after having been born in Bronx Hospital. Could anything be more Bronx than that? I loved the neighborhood, and the convenience of getting to Midtown in 15-20 minutes on a choice of two express trains. I went to Bx. Science although Taft would have been fine then.\n\nI actually was in the old neighborhood two weeks ago with my best friend from 1950. Of course, it's not a Jewish neighborhood anymore, but it actually looked better in some ways than when I lived there. The vacant lots had nice new buildings. There were definitely more trees on the street than when I was growing up. I still the Art Deco buldings. I always wished mine had been. :)\n\nWith luck, some priced-out Manhattanites will rediscover The Bronx and it can be a wonderful mixed neighborhood for all.\n\nIt still amuses me when the Times tries to pin a label on my neighborhood. It is NOT Morrisania, nor Melrose, nor Highbridge. For us, the entire neighborhood up to Fordham was, and will always be to me \"The West Bronx\". I Was Born In Bronx New York. In Morrisana Hospital. I lived on 1482 Brook Avenue\n\nDown in a Basement House where I could always see out in the kitchen window to\n\nThe backyard where I did see the passenger trains going by. I lived around the block\n\nFrom a Catholic Church that was on Webster Avenue. I went to P.S. 42 School And\n\nDown the street from the school was P.S.55 School. I too remember Bathcape and\n\nWhere I use to go to the stores and the 5&10, and this Market to where they had\n\nLive Chickens, and live Turkies. And I saw live Rabbits too. And that Milk store that\n\nI use to go and buy Milk and Butter too. I. Remember the apples on a stick that was\n\nCalled jellie apples. And this Big Block of ice that the man use to push along on the\n\nSide Walk. The man would scrape on the ice and would put the scrap up ice in a paper\n\nCup and then put some red flavor syrup on it. And the children would call it Icy. It\n\nCosted a dime. I wonder is it still someone out there who do still remembers the\n\n1400 Block of Brook Avenue in the Bronx.\n\nAnd too I use to go and be in Claramont Park all the time too. And the Merry\n\nGo Rounds Rides that use to come around for the kids to get on for a Dime. And\n\nThe icecream cones costed a Dime. And some little cakes did too. So all the Blocks\n\nThat I\"ve been on has been my stompping Ground. And too I want to ask, Has\n\nAnyone of you out there have been going to Danceing School? That was Ballet\n\nAnd Tap School? I use too go to one every Saturday. The Name of the Danceing\n\nSchool Was Called StartTime. And it would be a T.V Program that came on\n\nTelevision every Saturday Night with all those children on there. These are my\n\nMemory Lane. And I Still have a lot more of Memories.I found your site because I put \"Olinsky's Supermarket\" into the search engine. It ws on University Avenue across from Featherbed Lane. How many times I passed that market on the bus that I took from The \"Conc\" at Tremont Avenue to Washington Heights to go to church. We lived at 2206 Valentine Avenue on the southeast corner of 182nd Street. I went to PS 115 and for junior high to JHS 79 Creston Junior High. The art deco is beautiful. What made the place special were the people. On Sundays we would walk on The Grand Concourse and see our neighbors, stare into the shop windows and, in our case, walk up to Sutter's Bakery just north of Fordham Road (across from ALEXANDER\"S) and buy the best of quality baked goods. In the fall, my brother and I anxiously awaited the toy catalog from Shipman's. We would pour over the wonderful toys> they were on the \"CONC\" just north of Krum's. Remember Krum's Candy and Ice Cream? Alexander's? When I was an infant in 1943 my mother could go shopping at Alexander's and leave me in my carriage outside the store in good weather and inside in bad weather where a matron watched over us. Anyone of you ever take the Fordham Trolley to TIBBET'S Brook Park in Yonkers or to Pelham Parkway? I did. My friends would come to deocrate our Christmas TREE AND I would go to their homes to light Hannukah candles. I learned Yiddish from the grandparents. And then I would regale in seeing the young women outside St. Simon Stock Church on Ryer Avenue and 183rd Street, particularly on Easter when they were in their new finery including their hats. The sanctuary was always open for prayer. In those days my friend Larry and I would ride on the city subways to explore the city, unaccompanied, without fear of molestation. Fifteen cents for car fare each way and a bag lunch and we were off. My friend David and I would sit in our living room and read books. My friend Barry had a TV in 1947 so I would sit in his apartment and watch with hom on the five-inch screen of their Dumont TV. Lots of sweet memories. I am Thomas Merjanian. tmerj@optonline.net in Valley Cottage, NY. Thanks for this site.There is a website \"Bronx Board\" with graduation pictures from Macombs Jr. H.S PS 82 dating back to 1944, photos of the Old Bronx and message boards to post and receive. It is a great site and has been around for quite a long time. I lived at 80 Brandt Place,right off University Avenue and 176th Street and spent a great deal of time after school and in the evening with friends at \"The Benches.\" Also was a member of a club we formed called \"The Stars\", all girls with burgundy colored jackets. Had teachers like Miss Sheridan, Mrs. Saracheck and a teacher of Spanish who played guitar at Macombs. Mr. Hickey and Miss Riley ran a very tight ship. We belly whopped down Nelson Avenue in winter and turned onthe hydrants in summer. Slept on the fire escape or tar beach for a breeze, and without fear. Grew up straight, strong, and caring for others with a solid, no nonsense foundation by our parents, by example. We became street kids with insight and built-in intelligence,quite different from the street kids of today. We had role models and heroes who were discreet and considerate of the fragility of kids, so kept their own foibles hidden and gave us only the best of the best. This is the foundation which shaped my character, as well as my brother and cousins...all Bronx kids...and proud of it. Living in Manhattan, a far cry from a 5 story walk-up, I have never forgotten my roots.I was born in Bronx Hospital on Jan 28, 1939 I lived at 541 Union ave. went to PS 25 left in 1949. use to swim in the east river, my brothers and myself would sneak into the Ace theater on Saturday, wait for the crowds to leave and walk in backwards, we could not afford the Nickle, my Mother use to send me to buy her cigarettes at the corner store union and southern blvd. 3 for a nickle.Kissed my first Girlfriend she was 4 I was six, Lois T-, Had a friend Eddie Sharkie, (Wonder where he is now) Had the street bully (Tommy)throw a rusty knife at me and stick in my back, called up to my Mom she told me to pull it out missed my spine by not much still carry that scar to this day. Some nights I dream that I have moved back into that building, living in that small apt. its all fixed up but it's so small, I wonder how us 4 boys ever lived in that small bedroom in bunk beds. Remember the Ice man carrying up Ice on his back he was so strong and big, coal being loaded into the building through the coal chute, the snow storm or 1947 when they use to move all the snow to the corner and we had a snow mountain, flying down dead mans hill in Saint Mary's Park on borrowed roller skates and running into a car and chipping my front teeth,(Father gave me a good licking for that ) took 50 years to get them repaired.\n\nalso lived on Morris ave, Holland Ave. and last but not least 215 E Gun Hill Rd but that another story. Have friends to this day that Live on City Island, and when in NY meetup at Fiddlers Elbow on E. Tremont ave, had a girlfriend (Mary Ann)lived on Belmont ave. and we would listen to Dion and the Belmont's singing on the corner, So many memories so little time.Moved to Queens, and now retired to Delray Beach Fl. (They call S. Fl. the 5th borough. met someone Eddie and his wife today that reminded me of the Ace theater, can you imagine that small world. Hi, I was brought home from Lebanon Hospital in February, 1961 to 840 Grand Concourse where my brother was best friends with Linda and Susan and Diane. I loved and still love the Bronx. I have lived on Cape Cod up in Massachusetts for 20 years, but my mailbox is painted with pinstripes and the NY symbol. My kids are all Yankee fans. We go to Yankee Stadium a couple of times a year for games. My brother still has a ticket package. The Bronx is still very much a part of our lives. Very close friends of mine live in Woodlawn, Pelham Parkway, and Riverdale. I love the Grand Concourse; I rode the city bus to my high school up the concourse every day to Bedford Park Blvd. and the Academy of Mt. St. Ursula. My brother attended All Hallows High for 12 years. My mother was an Italian Catholic who joined Hadassah!!! I hope I spelled that right. We still visit the Belmont section, Arthur Ave. and 187th Street, for food. In fact, I take my high school students from Cape Cod down to the city for the day and we always stop in Belmont for food and shopping!!!! The Yankee Stadium area is gorgeous, Belmont is still terrific, Pelham Parkway is still pretty sweet, and Riverdale and Woodlawn are looking good,too. Riverdale is still great for Jewish Deli food. Those of you who have been away, come back for a visit!!! I'm a Bronx girl, graduate of Lehman College, and proud of it. Go Yankees!Hi. Thanks for the memories. I lived in The Bronx for 61 years before moving to Israel 16 years ago. I loved living in NY and I miss it terribly. For a number of years we kept our apartment on Pelham Parkway, but gave it up about six years ago.\n\nFor the first 5 years of my life I lived on Gerard Avenue near the Yankee Stadium. My brother used to sell \"Who's Who in the Major Leagues\" near the entrance of the Stadium. We used to frequent Molloly Playground. We moved further North before I started school.\n\nFor nine months we lived on the Gr. Conc. and Bedford Park Blvd., but then moved to 196th St. and Creston Avenue. I attended P. S. 46 and then Evander Childs H.S. I chose that H.S. because it taught Hebrew for 4 years. I hated the school, but I loved certain subjects, Hebrew the most. Then my family bought a house on Bainbridge Ave., & 194th or 195th St. I went to Hunter College in The Bronx where I met the man I married.\n\nMy husband & I moved to 177th St. & Walton in 1963. We lived there with our son until 1970 when we moved to the Pelham Parkway area - Barker Ave. between Mace & Waring - where I lived until moving to Israel in 1996. My son went to SAR Academy in Riverdale and then to Yeshiva HS. He moved to Israel the day after he graduated high school.\n\nI got to your site through Stewart Levine who I met when he visited Israel a number of years ago. We discovered that we knew a lot of the same people and went to the same places in The Bronx, and I'm certain our paths must have crossed in The Bronx at some time or other.\n\nThanks again for posting the photos.\n\nI grew up in 1535 University avenue,born 1959.\n\nMoved across the street to 164W 174 th street.\n\nI lived there until I was 8 years old.We were a mixed community,I'm Black, and had plenty of Jewish,German friends with whom I always got along .The ones from Undercliff were a bit unlike most of us,to be sure!\n\nThere was one very special charm of The Bronx in those days\n\nCertainaly the charm was Sedwick Houses!\n\nI'll never know why it worked so well but I guess I have my parents to thank.\n\nI live in Sweden now but I sure miss those special moments just having turned 53.\n\nChirley's candy store,\n\nthe 2 pizza shops,15/20 cent slices and both were different but good.PS 109,104,64,82( Park Plaza at it's worst yuck!)Sedwick nursery school was my first real encounter with other kids!I always wanted a fancier world and soon got it in my early 20's but only now can I truly appreciate what I really had back then.\n\nI put a lot of effort into denying my Bronx roots for years. Sigh,tears,Glad you are all here to share this with me!I'm one of you and you will always be what made me who I am,thank you.\n\nNealTo JAY and GUEST:\n\nI didn't know that Marty had a toy store further east on Tremont Avenue. I lived on Anthony Avenue at 175th street and used to go to Sam's candy store a lot. This is where we bought all our school supplies, spaldeens, comic books, etc. I remember Burt who was behind the soda fountain and made great egg creams and chocolate malteds - sometimes he played \"strikeouts\" with us in the PS 28 school yard. There was also Louis (Looie) who took care of the stationery section and watched over the spaldeens and bubble gum cards that were kept behind a glass case. Sam watched over everything else.\n\nAll the stores that were on East Tremont Avenue between Anthony Avenue and The Grand Concourse, are GONE! Some friends and I returned to The Bronx almost nine years ago for a walk through our old neighborhood. Many of the apartment buildings that were there in the 40s and 50s were torn down and replaced with smaller, three story houses and office buildings. You can see what the area looks like now by going into GOOGLE, select \"maps\" type in an address, click \"search\" and then select \"street view\". You can then \"drive\" down the blocks by using your mouse and see what's on either side of the street.Such an impressive written display of pride for a place so many of us called home. I was born in 1949 and lived on Walton Ave. (West Bronx) near the Grand Concorse where we all used to \"hang out.\" I went to PS 64, Wade Jr.High and Taft High where I graduated from in '67. My dad and uncle owned a retail store on 170th St. (between Walton and Jerome) for many years by the name of Kimballs Inc. Does anyone remember this store? My dad bought my uncle out at some point but retained the name. He continued to travel there for quite some time even after we moved to Ft.Lee, NJ right after my graduation from Taft. It seemed that either you moved to Queens, Westchester or NJ at that time, but you DID move because unfortunately, the old neighborhood was falling into deep dispair. Some time later, (don't remember the year) a few stores on my dad's block suffered a raging fire. That was a sign to us and we relinquished the business. Was anyone around that neighborhood during that time? Would love to hear YOUR memories. This has brought back so many fond memories that I didn't even know I had. Thank you. What a treat!I am a 73 year old Bronx girl...lived at 2720 Grand Concourse, one block North of Poe PaRK(rmember the dances?),PS 46 between Briggs and Bainbridge Avenue.Graduated from Evander Childs HS although Walton was closer, took wo buses each day to school and home cause my firedns went to Evqnder and did not wnat to go an all girls school. My fondest memories are of my great free childhood in the Bronx, playi8ng junmprope on Valentine Avenue, my pink spaldine,chalk for Potsy, and my ready made friends onthe treet til dark... leaving doors and windows open notfearing danger.It was a time tht will never again be....What a great placde to grow up. such simple pleasures...NAt And jacks deli on Valentine avenue. Iggy's barber shop, Zaro's(original) bakery, oh those onion rolls, the appetizing stores, and the corner candy store....hot summers with n o ar cnoitioning but we survived, Orchard Beach, Alexanders, Simco, AS Beck and Bakers shoe store on Frlodham Road. The Valentine, Fordham and Lido Grand and Paradise Theatres ,k JAcob Schiff Center and of course Krums....Oh for those days again...Those sweet romances...\n\nSt James Park and the roller rink on Jerome Avenue....Van Cortlandt Park....\n\nI could go on and on and still smell the summer rain on the hotcement sidewalks.\n\nThe street hawkers, \"I cash clothes\", the Italian opera singer we would throw money down to in rolled up napkins, The merry go round truck, Bungalow Bar and good Humor, Adventurers Inn and Freedom Land, Shorehaven... I need to go back again in my mond and feel comforted...I did take a trip back about ten years ago and cried seeing how \"my\" Bronx has crumbled...I close my eyes and see it as it was....My mother and father created and had an Art Gaallery Picture Frame store opposite Poe park,( Maidoff Gallery)no relation to Bernie!) it was a time of peace and beauty... How lucky I was to be there at that time....Love to all of my fellow Bronxites...hang on to those golden memories... My mother moved almost every 6 months when I was a child growing up in the Bronx. We lived at 1559 Vyse Avenue, on Nelson Avenue, 2078 Creston Avenue, 1975 Walton Avenue, we moved down the street on Walton Avenue but I can't remember the building number. We lived on Eastburn Avenue, 110 Mount Hope Place, and as an adult I lived at 2114 Aqueduct Avenue across from Bronx Community College.\n\nI went to C.S. 50 (we lived across the street) in 1972.\n\nI went to P.S. 73 in 1973, maybe in 1974.\n\nI went to P.S. 28 in 1975 and 1976 (it was so cold walking there from Walton Avenue and crossing the Grand Concourse. My mother use to boil and egg so our hands would stay warm. We were able to go outside for lunch and we would go to a pizza shop on Tremont Avenue and get a pizza and an icy for $1.\n\nI went to J.H.S. 117 from 1976- June 1979 and it went up to the 9th grade, but I left and went to Fashion Industries and then ended up graduateing from Theodore Roosevelt High School on Fordham Road. I actually went back to JHS 117 and taught there for 4 yrs and was the speaker at the graduation.\n\nI attended Lehman College which has Gothic Art. Then I attended City College, but relocated to VA in 1994.\n\nI have a twin sister name Lisa and everyone always got us mixed up.\n\nI read just about every comment but didn't see the great Bronx past time of going outside in the summer to play in the fire hydrant. We use to jump rope, play hopscotch and stuck ball in the street. Mr. Softee always came through when mom was broke, and someone always had a boombox blasting on the stoop.\n\nWe use to go to the RKO and Lowe's Paradise as kids and my father bought us a book called, \"The Beautiful Bronx\" back in the day.\n\nI was a kid when the Yankee Stadium was FIRST remodeled and we would watch as they put the letters up spelling Yankee Stadium. I wish we had took pictures and documented that stuff back then, they would be priceless right now.\n\nI remember penny candy, rum caramel now-and-laters, squirrel nuts and mary janes.\n\nI live in rural VA and people always ask why we moved. I don't miss people brakng into to my car to steal my son's car seat, my car being picked up for parking tickets, aggressive driving and the trash. I do love my fond memories as a child, the block parties, walking to Orchard Beach, Manhattan, and selling used magazines we found in the trash. I packed bags at the E&B food store on Jerome Avenue and worked the Summer Youth Program.\n\nThanks for the pictures Pat!\n\nGinaI stumbled over your site while googling \"Krums\". I lived at 1583 Macombs Road - that building was the last one left standing north of the Cross Bronx Expressway. I went to PS 104 and used to walk up Featherbed Lane and then Nelson Avenue to get there. My favorite aunt lived on Davidson Avenue, and I'd often walk to her house. I remember those steps!!!\n\nI spent the first 10 years of my life in that neighborhood, and it will always remain a fond memory. I'll never forget the Moishe's supermarket we used to shop at - the tiny deli where we'd buy franks with saurkraut. But especially sledding down Macombs Hill on a snowy day when the schools had been closed! On special Saturday nights, we would walk down Mt. Eden Avenue (and then all the way up) to the Grand Concourse, then stroll all the way to Fordham Road to go to Krum's for an ice cream sundae (or, in my case, an ice cream soda!) We didn't have much -- but those family walks are something I will always treasure. Sadly, many many years ago, I traveled back to visit the old neighborhood, and hardly recognized it. They say you can't go home again -- but thanks for the wonderful pictures and memories.\n\nCarole Mannion\n\nMyrtle Beach, SCMet someone today who asked, \"Have you ever heard of Featherbed Lane?\" Of course I have. My mom did all her shopping there. I don't remember it, I was seven when we moved. But as you said, those first years hold special memories. Love the picture of the Grand Concourse flatiron building. Pretty sure my pediatrician was in that building.\n\nWe lived at 1430 Plimpton Avenue. Most people have never heard of it, first street off the E.L.Grant Highway. My cousins were a block or two down on Shakespeare Avenue. Went to PS 104 around the corner through first grade, and our shul was just at the end of our block.\n\nIt's so sad, my building isn't even there anymore. I was never able to take my kids back and show them. A typical 6-story walkup... didn't you just love the lobbies of those buildings?\n\nI remember living in a 1 bedroom apartment (4 of us in one BR!) until I was 7. I remember jumping rope with the older girls and always being the 'steady ender'. I remember my first day of kindergarten in 1960, the tail end of a hurricane, so wet and windy, but so excited to finally go to school. I remember running around in and out of our neighbors' apartments, and having multiple 'parents' in the building, and spending hours in the (not always so) fresh air, and always having someone to play with.\n\nAnd Francine Silberberg, if you're out there, I'd love to walk down memory lane with you.\n\nWish I had time to read through all your comments, but the first hundred or so will have to do for now.\n\nDo I sound like our parents when I say, \"Here's to the good old days\"? Well, they were!I was born in 1957 & originally lived at 1500 Grand Concourse. There was a Chinese restaurant and a dry cleaner on the block. I remember when the first supermarket in the area opened. i think it was named \"Food Stop.\" When I was 8 we moved to 201 E. Mt. Eden Parkway. My father was the associate director of Lebanon Hospital and his commute was all of a 3 block walk. I graduated from P.S. 70 in June 1969. PS 70 had a beautiful indoor pool and I remember Mr. Leffler was the swim instructor. My teachers at PS 70 were: Mrs. Nestenpower (1st grade), Mrs. Marden (3rd grade), Mrs. Benjamin (3rd grade), ??? (4th Grade), Mrs. Slobody (5th Grade, that was the music class) and Mrs. Arnauer (6th grade). How do I remember their names???\n\nI then attended JHS 117 (Wade JHS).The neighborhood was starting to change in a bad way and I made the SP and graduated after 2 years. I made Bx. Science but decided to attend The HS for the Performing Arts once accepted. We moved out of the Bx. after I had finished the 10th grade and we headed to the safe borough of Queens.\n\nMy entire family lived within a 15 walk of my apartment. When I was in the 6th grade everybody began moving away. My grandparents had lived at the corner of Clarke Place & Jerome Avenue for almost 40 years and they moved to Co-Op City (Section 5, Building 26). My grandmother's 2 sisters and brother and teir families all moved to Atlanta, GA. An so began the exodus.\n\nThings I remember:\n\n-Krum's candy store on the Concourse near Fordham Road\n\n-Alexander's\n\n-Movies at the Luxor, Kent and Loew's Paradise theaters\n\n-Jahn's and the KITCHEN SINK\n\n-Little League baseball and the annual baseball season parade on the Concourse\n\n-The YMHA on the Concourse near 167th Street (I earned a brown belt in judo there)\n\n-Working as a runner in the beauty parlor my mother went to on 17oth Street\n\n-Hebrew school at the Mt. Eden Jewish Center/Rabbi David Hollander\n\n-The library across from PS 70\n\n-Stickball in the schoolyard\n\n-Riding bikes at Poe Park\n\n-The playground at Claremont Park\n\n-Taking the #1 bus to Riverdale to go ice skating\n\n-Walking to Yankee Stadium with my grandfather\n\n-Charlotte Rousse pastries\n\n-Two slices of pizza and a soda and getting change for $1. Toppings???? There were no toppings then.\n\n-Sitting on the fire escape with my grandmother on hot sticky days in June\n\n-Escaping the city to go to the Catskills after school let out in June and returning just after Labor Day\n\n-Susan Bass......my first crush\n\n-Taking the Jerome Avenue train to Van Cortland Park\n\n-My classmates and friends from my childhood; Clifton Anderson, Lee Rosenthal, Michael Cohen, Steven Cohen, David Pinsky,Leslie Malar, Michael Dain, Bruce Dain, Mrs. Dain, Danny Cavanaugh\n\n-My neighborhood kosher deli and its mouth watering foods (knishes, pastrami, corned beef, tongue & brisket). I remember the owner's son was killed in Vietnam and he was never the same and shortly afterwards, he closed the deli.\n\n-Attending numerous affairs at a catering hall on the other side of Mt. Eden Parkway. I don't remember its name.I just came across this site and forgot that I had posted comments a year or so ago. I don't know where to begin, what with all the memories flooding into my brain from this second visit. I lived at 1208 college Ave, then moved to 210 Mt. Hope Place...attended PS 53, PS 22 (first year when it opened!), Taft HS etc. I well remember all the shops on Tremont Ave, The Fleetwood Theater, The A&P on 167th St,the Kent, Luxor, Devon, and on and on. I lived in London for 18 years and came back to the states in 2005. (Not by choice as these were still the corrupt Bush years-but that's another story)..what struck me was how much the buildings on Mt. Hope Place leading up to PS 28 in the photos could very well have been in London...beautiful architecture as are so many of the apartment houses still standing. Also I well remember how safe and clean it was everywhere, the trolly cars, Cascade swimming pool on Jerome and 167th St, the Ascot on the Grand Concurse where 'foreign' fils were shown, the large playing field of PS 53, ...I am sure that 90% of everyone who moved elsewhere over the years would NEVER have left if the Bronx stayed as we knew it before it went downhill...Having lived in Europe and traveled to many countries, I am always dismayed at how Americn cities (the Bronx being just one of countless examples) become abandoned and dangerous and 'downtown' hardly exists in so many places. 'Downtown' in Europe's cities are viable and hardly changed over the centuries...and mostly safe and thriving. I blame TV for so much of what destroyed our culture...for those of us who remember, there were glorious movie palaces, night clubs, restaurants, stage shows, dance bands and show bands, and so forth where people went out to partake of all this.. It is mostly all gone now and people have retired to places such as Florida and Arizona where that special spark of life is simply not there. I lived in Europe in regard to a musical career as a soloist on the bassoon and am now back in the states and living in Brooklyn...and still performing in jazz and classical.....The main point of these comments is to express the many fond memories I have, and will always have, of growning up in the Bronx...My wife is from Brooklyn and she considers Brooklyn superior to the Bronx....fuggedaboutit...Da Bronx was da best...And the ONLY other places where THE is used as part of a full place name are THE VATICAN and THE HAGUE..perhaps a few others, but THE BRONX was the best! danbassoon2@aol.com if anyone wants to make contact..I noticed a Joan Lang and a reference to Evelyn Adler from Mt. Hope Place along the way. What is it about the Bronx that makes us all miss it so, including myself? I think because it was a slower, happier, really rich home life, when many of us still had our grandparents, aunts and uncles living nearby.\n\nI grew up at 65 East 190th Street between Alexander's and St. James Park just off the Grand Concourse. Left the Bronx for Miami Beach in 1954 when my Dad had enough of shoveling his car out of the snow every Winter.\n\nI only spent the first 9 years of my life in the Bronx, but I have a lot of great, still-vivid memories:\n\nAttending PS33 which always looked like a giant European castle to me; Going to the Plunge (Crotona?)on a hot day and drinking orange drink in those little triangular-shaped waxed containers; eating dinner out at The Chinese Casino restaurant near the Concourse and my Dad telling me every time the soy sauce was really 'Black Bug's Blood'; Walking with Mom and Sis to Loew's Paradise and spending more time watching the moving ceiling, twinkling stars, statues and exploring the many levels and alcoves than the movies. I remember the swords made into lamps hanging in the bathrooms. Those were the days parents could let their kids wander alone in a movie house without fear of some pedophile hurting them. Visiting my friend David Braunstein, who's Grandma lived with him and always had fresh-baked cookies waiting; Going to Nedicks or Gorman's for a hot dog and grape drink before the Loew's Grand; Visiting my Dad's combination billiard parlor and bowling alley on the Concourse, and meeting all the professional wrestlers who hung out there. They used to ask me to 'make a muscle' with my puny, twig little-kid arms and go 'ooh' and 'aah' as they squeezed it; The kids playing stickball or 'Off The Stoop' with their bright-pink 'Spaldeen' ball; Other kids shooting marbles with cigar boxes their Dad gave them which had little holes cut out to shoot into; Still others flipping and trading baseball cards (nobody I knew ever traded football cards, but we had those too); A visit to John's Butcher Shop and being a little scared of the pile of bloody, staring chicken heads on the floor; A visit to Mooney and Benny's Fruit Stand and always getting a dill pickle as a gift from them; The barber shop on Jerome Avenue under the elevated train, where the barber always got me to be still by telling me he cut off the last little boy's ear because he squirmed too much (it always worked!); Krum's, where they could have charged for the smells alone!; World's best pizza on Arthur Avenue when the whole family would walk down together and we would magia and listen to the wonderful, happy Italian music always being played; Playing endlessly in St. James Park, a green and beautiful refuge in the big city.\n\nI could keep going but we all have this greeat storehouse of warm, pleasant memories from our early childhoods.\n\nThanks Pat for sharing those great photos of a place and time that, like Margret Mitchell said, is now \"Gone With The Wind.\" Formally Vaughn Featherstone (aka Baby Boscoe): Born at New York Hospital.\n\nGrew up in the Williamsbridge area of the Bronx. The #2 train. Lived at 1836 Watcon avenue (near Bruckner BLVD) until I was 4. Moved to 223rd street (between Laconia & Paulding ave) until I was 8. Moved to 220th street (b'tween Barnes & white Plains road). Stayed there until I joined the military in 1981 (moved from the Bronx in '87). I go back when finances are right (every 2-3 years).\n\nI miss the hell out of the Bronx. My neighborhood is trashed now (gangs) but I still miss it. No place better. Miss going to Haffen Pool near The Valley, hanging out in Bronx Park, riding the 2 train from 241st street to New Lots Avenue. I miss riding the trains PERIOD!\n\nI used to take the 4 to Burnside avenue and walk to Gun Hill road and home just for the hell of it. Got robbed on Fordham road when I was 15 in front of Thom McCan's. They only got a dollar. hahaha! Used to go to Alexander's just to dream. Got my first set of turntables from Krazy Eddie's!!!\n\nHanging out on Mosholu Parkway, River ave, Rucker park and up near the Reservoir. The first time I saw Grant's Tomb I was like, \"Oh shit!!!\"\n\nI remember the blackout, Son of Sam acting crazy and the dude that was shooting peeps from rooftops. I forgot what type of weapon he had. I was young. I remember when the mafia shot up Paul Castallano (I think his nae, was) and the Daily News had it on the front page. I was a paperboy and was like, \"Ma, did you see this?!\"\n\nBest spots (in order):\n\nBoccia's: best bakery I have EVER eaten in my life! Still the best! Their eclairs were incredible!\n\nFrank's Pizza (3770 White Plains Road): STILL THERE after all of these years! Best pizza's on the planet!\n\nCarvell (225th street/White Plains Road): Ice cream was ridiculous.\n\nJamaican store (225th street): Had Beef patties that would have you like a crack head begging for crack.\n\nDamn, I miss home! F. 22-Oct-2010 13:21\n\nLAURA F.\n\nGreat photos, great memories! Here's mine: Went to PS 114, JHS 22 and Taft HS. I lived on Gerard Ave, between 165th St and McClennan Ave until I was 20. Went to the Y on 165th St and the Concourse.\n\nI remember Sadie's Candy Store on Gerard and 165th St, the grand 167th St Cafeteria (loved the egg barley!), the Jewish deli, Kent movie theater, the Chinese Restaurant, the fancy lighting store (never went in there!) and the stationery store, all on 167th St between Gerard and River Aves. Also, a pet store on River Ave between McClennan and 167th St.\n\nOn 161st St between Gerard and River Aves I remember Addie Vallen's and Barton's. I also remember the shopping area on 170th St, and that wonderful record store where I used to buy 45s for 69 cents! Can't remember the name of that store. *sob*\n\nAnd the fabulous Fordham Rd shopping area! The Lowe's Paradise, Krum's, (Uptown it's) Alexander's, the RKO Fordham, Deli City, Woolworth's 5 & 10 (how I miss all those Woolworth's! Duane Reade is NOT a substitute!), and all the shoe stores on Fordham Rd, ha.\n\nWhen I was 20 we moved to the Concourse and 196th St. Never felt attached to that area like I did to my li'l home town of Gerard and 165th.\n\nGoogle queen of cyberspace.\n\nIN RESPONSE TO YOUR POSTING, I LIVED AT 1068 GERARD AVENUE AND SADIE'S CANDY STORE WS ACROSS THE STREET FROM WHERE I LIVED. THERE WAS ALSO A DRUG STORE ACROSS FROM THE CANDY STORE. I LIVED THERE FROM 1952-1962, WENT TO P. S. 114 AND THEN 22 AND THEN MOVED TO UEENS. WEHRE DID YOU LIVE? My grandparents on both sides lived in the Bronx for many years. I remember visiting them with my family when I was a kid in the 1950s. My paternal grandparents lived on Marion Ave. My maternal grandmother lived on Davidson Avenue. I remember the welcoming smell of the marble tiled floor when you entered her apartment building. I loved the dumb waiter. The German \"super\" and his wife lived in an apartment across the street. They were so nice, although I had a little bit of a problem understanding them because of their German accents.I used to look out the bedroom to watch kids playing stoop ball across the street. My grandmother and I would walk up to the end of the street. There was a Horn and Hardart's automat there, and I loved to look at all the different food in the glass cases and try to decide what I wanted to eat. We would shop at the grocery store just down from the automat (on Jerome Ave.?). It had a German name beginning with a D (I remember how to pronounce the name but not how to spell it (maybe you can help me there). We sometimes would stop at the corner tavern on the way home where my grandmother's roomer Jimmy (from Greece) used to make us a turkey-on-rye sandwich--the best ever. I hate to think what the old neighborhood looks like today. I will just cherish the memories I have from the good old days. Thanks for sharing your memories and beautiful photos of the Bronx.I was born in Lebanon Hospital in June 1960; my name is Marlene. My pediatrician was Dr. Zucker. I lived on 2195 Walton Ave. Looking for Jamie Hoffman, Judy Cohen, Robert Zane, Kenny Stolen, (PS 79 and EBB) or anyone who might remember me! I used to sit on the stoop with Judy, eat pixie sticks bought from the local candy store and playfully argue about who was better--the Beatles or Simon & Garfunkel, circa 1967! I played Twister at Jamie's house, blasting Magical Mystery Tour, while her grandma says, \"What happened to those boys? They used to be so clean-cut!\" Dad bought me mono records (lps) from Alexanders, downstairs area. Upstairs, the swinging '60s mannequins wearing fashionable styles of the day, colorful minis with go-go boots (I had day-glo orange ones, and white patent leather ones). Having eaten too many sundaes at Krums, I actually had to get my clothes from Robert Hall, where they carried half-sizes, like 6X, for chubby me! Lowes Paradise on Sundays, followed by dinner at a Chinese place by Kress; visits to Van Cortland Park! My favorite was walking to all the shops on the Concourse, admiring wedding window displays--i want a diamond crown tiara like the ones in the window. Then mom buys me white frosted lipstick from the pharmacy, just like Ethel Kennedy wears (I'm cool now!). Pizza wars, 10 cents vs. the guy two stores away for 5 cents a slice! Some hippie shops. A Horn & Hardet (sp?) with the best custard in little tins. And, of course, the best ever pretzel with a vanilla egg cream at a candy store on a hill leading down to Burnside Ave! Those were the days; it's true...no cell phones, just talking with your best friend through two cups linked together by a string! erica\n\nA blast from the past and i guess for me its back to the future. i was born in bronx lebanon hospital back in 1959 i understand for the first 2 years of my life we lived on valentines' ave. then moved to monroe ave.. i remember going to p.s. 28 for kindergarten and my older sister was the class monitor. she was in 4th grade. then i had ms. parada in first grade - who when i had her had a nervous breakdown and was absent for most of the term. but i do remember so many things. i remember a boy named richie who lived upstairs from me on monroe ave. and his brother jackie and mom harriet. i remember walking to the ave. where my mom shopped and i believe there was a small movie theater there. but the best was going to fordham road and going to the loew's paradise theater and krums afterward. then shopping at alexander's. it's unbelievable how things change. one culture moves out another moves in. in april of first grade we moved to van cortlandt ave. where i then attended p.s. 95. i went to 143 from there and then on to john f. kennedy (which i understand is one of the schools in the process of being closed down). in 1982 i got married moved to brooklyn and was there until the year 2006 when i got divorced and moved back to the bronx. i now work on ogden ave. back in the south bronx. i guess you can say that i am back from the future. funny how things are. great website to reminisce about things. thank you.Just came across this website..I was trying to find photos of the Cascade swimming pool on Jerome Ave. Having lived in England for some 18 years and traveled to many countries, the Bronx holds up very well in regard to Europe... the buildings, neighborhoods, theatres, restaurants, etc. Unfortunately it is mostly all gone...I blame both the Cross Bronx Expressway and TV for the disintigration of what was indeed a very special place. I also had a four year nightmare experience trapped in South Florida...ran for my life and am now in Brooklyn. My wife is from Brooklyn and does not understand what it was like growing up in the Bronx. Went to PS 53, PS 22 (first year it was built). then Taft..lived at 1208 College Ave...last time I saw it there was nothing but a hole. Then walked to a local small candy store one block down from PS 53 and there was the son of the original owner still inside...he recognized me! Virtally all the small children in the store were black and I was quite surprised to see him there many years later. Having seen how in Europe, such destruction and decay is not the norm...just the opposite in fact, I am always stunned at how this can happen..the Bronx being just one example of many throughout the USA..and the 'downtown' in all of Europe means a viable place for people to assemble, stroll, shop, eat, etc. while in many cities here, 'downtown' is a dangerous place at night. Anyhow, those of us who grew up in the Bronx really did have a very special chidhood. Wish it was still there. Maybe someone could also cover my neighborhood. Boston Post Road and Corsa, where the horizontal marquis of the Leow's Post Road movie house still stands and, with paint peeling, looks somewhat like a blasted heath. We bused to Fordham and loved the Paradise with it's twinkling stars in the ceiling and the 2 giant African goldfish... huge, like sci-fi. One died and Cecil B. DeMille, or whoever, never replaced him. Sadly, one day, his significant other was gone too. My friend and I used to crawl under the immaculate toilet stalls in the posh ladies room after we locked them all, and die laughing when the fat and mean matron in her white uniform had to crawl under to unlock them while we pretended to preen in front of the elegant dressing table mirrors. No one ever got onto us. My friend became a doctor and moved away, of course. So did I. Manhattan and then California. But I still remember the joys of growing up there before the neighborhood went. We loved the flavored chocolate covered marshmallows at Krum's and used to buy them hand sorted by weight. I had my first white chocolate there. And until about the age of 14 I did my shopping uptown at Alexander's before I graduated to Macy's, and then to the better stores on Fifth Ave. There was much laughter in those days, and there still is, but the corner candy store with the egg creams, the real NY made-fresh-to-order pizza shop, and the neighborhood Chinese restaurant where they'd give us iced water to go in real glasses when we were kids playing running games on hot summer days, and we always brought their crystal back unbroken... all that's gone, never to return like the 60's and airline travel that once involved running to catch planes. I lived in that area of the Bronx from about the age of 8 and grew up with my childhood friends, some in my immediate Boston Post Road area, and some in Concourse housing, to win scholarships and solidly move on.\n\nNice to share.Pat...adding to your memories of your Walton Avenue building, my late father's first dentist, from age eight until my dad's untimely death in 1972, was Walton Avenue's own Dr. Leon Kossin. If you do a \"Google search\" of Dr. Kossin, you'll find him listed in a directory from 1931-1932, indicating Dr. Kossin's Walton Avenue address BEFORE he moved his dental offices in 1936 to The Grand Concourse's \"Fish Building\" -- that beautiful Art Deco structure with the multi-color mosaic tiles at its base forming a fish tank.\n\nWhile Dr. Kossin practiced dentistry on Walton Avenue, my paternal grandparents ran a fruit-and-vegetable store there. My dad, my uncles, and my aunts were required to help my grandparents run the store. Dr. Kossin told me during one of my dental visits to him that he always purchased his family's fresh fruits and vegetables from my grandparents' Walton Avenue store, where Dr. Kossin would see my dad sitting on an old-fashioned wooden crate doing his homework while waiting on customers.\n\nI was born in year 1951 at The Bronx-Lebanon Hospital on Mount Eden Avenue just after that hospital was converted from a World War II U.S. Army hospital to what it was before the war: a civilian hospital. I grew-up on The Grand Concourse, residing at 1355 Grand Concourse -- on the top floor in this non-elevator building, located between Marcy and Elliott Place and close to the wide 170th Street shopping neighborhood.\n\nThe paternal grandparents I had mentioned in this post resided close-by, on Wythe Place between Jerome Avenue and The Grand Concourse. We were family friends with DAVE BUNIS, who owned the 170th Street BUNIS SHOE STORE. We also were friendly with the RUDIN family, which operated the BARTON'S CHOCOLATIER on 170th Street. The S & A variety store was on the corner of Wythe Place and 170th Street, with Roosevelt Gardens Apartments just up the block at 170th Street and The Grand Concourse.\n\nOn 170th Street there was a jewelry store with an outdoor glass display directly in front of the jewelry store's entrance. Right next-door there was a large toy store. We kids loved going to that toy store with our parents and grandparents.\n\nAn air-raid siren sat atop the Woodlawn-Jerome #4 train station at 170th Street. As a small child I learned that the siren noise emanated from that subway-mounted siren.\n\nWe went to Claremont Park and to John Mulally Park. During the Christmas holiday season we attended the Christ The King Church bazaar...from my bedroom window I could see the bazaar with all its colors and lights. There were even tents for weather-protection. This was the 1950's when nuns still wore traditional clergy clothing, complete with very large headware. Our area was religiously-diverse...Roman Catholic parish churches and synagogues were all within convenient walking-distance.\n\nIn 1954 New York Yankee DON LARSEN \"pitched the perfect game\" only a few blocks south in Yankee Stadium. Nearby, The Concourse Plaza Hotel was still in its heyday and hosted weekly dances. The German Lorelei Fountain across the street from the hotel upheld the park's majesty. Art Deco buildings adorned The Grand Concourse and its environs.\n\nBarry F. BealickI just happened to pop in on this web site-Looking for familiar names. Surprisingly I only found 2 that I knew. Luari Rovin Ward (who now is an accomplished and published interior designer) The other is Jay Popper-( however I can't quite put the name with the face).I was born in the Bronx at Dr. Leffs' in 1945. Lived in 1405 Walton ave.(the corner of 170th st.)I attended p.s. 64-(I still remember Mrs. Zimmerman and \"Sexy Sybel for the life of me I now can't remember her last name-but they were very attractive and great teachers). I attended Wade JHS 117 and went on to graduate from the H.S. of Music and Art class of 1963. Later on attending The School of Visual Arts. I still touch base with a whole network of Bronx friends who mostly attended Taft H.S.. I ended up marrying my wife of 37 years who was also a Bronx gal-Barbara Weiner who attended EBB JHS and graduated Walton H.S. class of 66. She went on to to CCNY and got her Masters at Columbia. In 69 I lived in Dallas Tex.then moved back to Manhattan. By this time my parents had left the Bronx. My wife and I live right across the Hudson in Fort Lee N.J.. From time to time aside from making the trek to Yankee Stadium we ocassionally take ourselfs on a touring journey of all the the old huants and places of interest that have been mentioned in these previous passages.\n\nThere seems to be a magical and also an incredibly nostalgic attachment that our fellow Bronxites share.-For the most part most of us grew up of modest means, amongst concrete towers, with little pockets of greenery. We relied on public transportation,we lacked the amenities that the more affluent suburban neighborhoods offered or the the glitzy neihborhoods of Manhattan but I think the special relationship we all had with the \"old neighborhood\" lies with the quality of the people, our friends, teachers, shopkeepers, yes even the neihborhood cops. We lived in a world where the streets were safe,and clean, the schools were great and our general quality of life was as good if not better than mostother residential areas.\n\nRecently (a little over a year ago) we had a neighborhood reunion. There were people there that hadn't seen each other in 40 years it was fantastic. The next day 5 of us jumped in a jeep and traversed the Bonx. The Stadium, Muhlaley Park (I don't think I'm spelling it right), Taft H.S.,Jordan L Mott JHS, Sherman and Sheridan aves., Morris ave. The the site of the old Sugar Bowl.170th st (none of the older stores are there any longer). The school yards of p.s. 64 have been totally renovated with astro turf and state of the art recreational equipment. Drove up the El Grant highway -the Steps, Davidson ave., PS91, Jerome ave. Mt. Eden the Concourse. The revamped Paridise, Fordham Rd.. Roosevelt H.S. Arthur Ave..For the most part most of the structures were still in tact, but the character of the neihborhhods has drastically changed. However you can see here and there there are pockets of revitalization. Hopefully this will continue on so that future generations will enjoy the same experiences that we had a couple of generations ago\n\nFordham U.Hello, and thanks for sharing your wonderful photo history of the Bronx. I moved there with my parents when I was a baby in 1953 and remained until 4th grade. We lived on Morrs Park Ave., directly across from Our Lady of Solace where I went to school. My Aunt Doris Marchetti and her parents Tessy and Peter lived on Victor Street. I remember the Bronx Zoo and eating egg salad sandwiches with my parents Anna and Mario Mazzei on a hill overlooking the Zoo. I remember the park and playground on the Grand. Concourse and the time one winter daywhen my parents walked there with me from our house to go ice skating. When we arrived I found I had forgotten my skate's ankle strap and my dad went all the way back home (walking or on bus?) to retrieve it. I remember the closed off \"play stret\" we played hopscotch on along the side of OLS school on Holland Ave. I remember there was a fire once at school and the lady that owned the corner candy store came to pick us u at school and brought us all home. I remember my friends Sherrill Powell from Wallace Ave, and my friends MarySue Ferroni and Lorraine Pallazollo from my building. I remember the sun in my eyes as I looked up to our kitchen window (on the 4th floor) so that my mother could toss down my school beret in a paper bag when I forgot it. I remember walking with my mom to get rotisseroie chicken from such a store near Fordham. I remember collecting green stamps and thinking why was collecting \"books\" such a big deal when we had so many books in the shelves. I remember going on the roof with my mom occassionally And fearing I would get swept off or fall through the crackly bubbled roofing paper. Finally I remember my mom hanging laundry from he living room window that looked onto an open paved area below, as I picked the gravel composite from the window sill which I could barely reach.Just came across your weibsite after doing a search for present photos of the old Zenith movie theater and these pics bring back so many memories, When I saw the pic of the steps leading to and frokm Davidson Ave. I really started to have tears in my eyes. I'm sure those are the same steps right by P.S. 53 (?.) I lived on Morris Ave. between 170th Street and 169th but closer to the corner of 170th near Taft High. I went to P.S. 88, 53, Jr high 22 and Taft but my family moved to Forest Hills, Queens in my senior year after I was attacked by a gang soon after my birthday and the ring my parents had given me for my birthday was stolen. The building I lived in---1347 Morris Ave.--isn't there any more but the address is as a new building that was going up from what I've seen on the net has the same address number.\n\nI was a member of the Y, the Jewish one, on the Grand Concourse and it was a good place to go to mingle with friends and especially to dance The Hop LOL. There was a pool too where all the teeens would go in summer I thikl near Yankee Stadium. I remember you had to walk up a flight of stairs to get to it and it was awlays busy. It was an outside pool and you paid admission. Best of all of course were the mom and pop candy stores with their egg creams. Ahh.. a world gone now. I was Born in the old Lincoln Hospital which is now the bronx Towed Car lot...my mother told me I was supposed to be an \"observed\" birth for the nursing students, but I was coming and the nursing teacher tried to stop the birth by tying my mother's legs closed. I lived in a hotel on E. 157 and Park Avenue then moved into the Bronx Riger Projects when they openned in 1955. I attended PS 106 then was bussed to JHS !@& in Parkchester after the Civil Rights Bill was signed by Kennedy. I remember catching bees and lightning bugs in mayonaise jars during the fall and being yelled at for walking on the grass in the projects. because I was bussed I was fortunate not to have fallen into the stereotyped cluches of Hispanics at the time...lazy, junkies, hoods...I went to the Dances at Bronx House and had many classmates who lived in and around the Lydig Avenue area. WE used to have our Musicale's at Columbus H.S. I remember taking the #6 train to the last stop and taking the #12 bus to Orchard Beach and wishing I were rich so I could rent an umbrella and beach chair. on rare occasions we could buy a coke from those guys who walked along the beach with those big silver cans on their backs. I remember seeing King Kong at that movie theatre West Farms next to the motel. Going to the zoo with my father and renting a rowboat to go up the Bronx River.my first job was as a paperboy for the NY Post. I swear I had Supreme Court Justice Sonia SotoMayor as a customer ! I delivered all along Bruckner Boulevard before itbecame an expressway. I remember Korvettes....that was my first credit card. I attended Music and Art HS and graduated in 1971. I met my first wife Paula there. She lived on Lacombe avenue. The family still has the house but that neighborhood went down fast.My son by Paula still lives there. Her maiden name was Paula Edwards and she came from the Throggs Neck Projects. I started working at the old carwash on E. TRemont Ave up the block from the E. 180 St IRT train station. I began working for the city in 1975 first at the NY Public Library at the Mott Haven branch on E. 140 St and Alexander Avenue. later i would get a picture of\n\nPope Paul II driving past the 040 precinct...and get hit by a cop motorcycle for the effort ! When I finally built a bicycle from old parts you would find i the many garbage-strewn lots around the Bronx I would venture off in serach of things I had heard about...Ven Cortlandt park, Riverdale, Hunts Point. Ironically I would become a Paramedic with NYC Emergency Medical Service, now associated with the Fire Department, and later a NYPD Officer starting at the 048 precinct, then the 050 and finally the 045, so all of these sojourns on my bicycle would become useful. I never got lost going to a call anywhere in the Bronx ! I was on a foot post at E. 161 and the Conc when I got the call my father had died at the numbers hole he worked in at the corner of E. 174 St and Bronx River Avenue, across from the Projects. I live in Putnam County NY now on the banks of the Croton Reservoir, the place where NYC gets their drinking water. I am retired but on occasion I travel down to the Bronx to see my brothers who live there or to just get a sack of White CAstles from Boston Road and Allerton Avenue or E. Tremont Avenue at WEstchester Square. The memories sustain me and they comfort me. I was born on May 30 1916 at Fordham Hospital after the midwife failed my mother in delivery in our apartment at 380 E 173 St. Grew up among Irish, German and Jewish families. Went to PS 28, 70 and Clinton High School. Loved the swimming pool at PS 70 except during the time when the girls had the pool and the boys had to spend the period under the shower. Neighborhood games included stoopball, double dutch, potsie and boys stickball on Carter Ave next to the garage. Police confiscated our sticks because of garage complaints, but hinted to us where they hid them.\n\nHalloween was fun day when we'd put on old clothes and fill our mothers stockings with flour to bang everything and every kid available. When we ran out of flour, we would go to Tierney's hot water pipe sleeve factory on 173 St and Anthony Ave, gather up piled sawdust resulting from trimming the sleeves down to size and blown out the fctory vent. Little did we know the dust was filled with asbestos.\n\nOn Decoration Day (Memorial Day) we would go up to Grand Concourse to enjoy watching the parade which included marching bands, World War 1 and Spanish-American War veterans marching in step with the music. There were even a few Civil War veterans in chauffered Packards waving to us as they passed by. This happened around 1926.\n\nThere were many movie houses in the neighborhood including the Benenson (Fenway), Fox Crotona, Metro, Burnside, Blenheim (Delux) Tremont and others. The first movie I ever remember seeing was \"The Phantom of the Opera\". Was so scared, I hid behind a post.\n\nAh, those were the days to remember.\n\ni grew up in the highbridge section of the bx. ps 11, ps 73 and of course sacred heart. it is truly a unique experience to be a bronxite and especially to be from highbridge. i was truly suprised to see only 1 or 2 emails from people from my neighborhood. i remember so many of the places mentioned and even had forgotten a few.\n\ni live in florida now, as so many other former bronx people do but have never felt at home anywhere but the bronx.\n\nmy mother worked at morrisania hospital and then for the borough president at 161st for 35 yrs.\n\ni went to walton h.s. and just learned a short time ago that it no longer exists. that was a tough school to get through. the teachers and principal, mrs. heffernan took nothing from all of the girls there. i believe there were 3,000 plus girls there the yr. i graduated (1963) everyone from that time thought the parochial schools had strictest policies but i would put walton against them anytime.\n\nwe moved out of 1304 merriam ave in 1965. we stayed as long as we could. people were getting mugged and beaten up. girls weren't safe. so sad as mentioned by others that before this time you could leave your doors open and no one would bother you. what great neighbors we had. truly a melting pot of nationalities and religions.\n\nmy mother did the typing for some of the meetings held in her office and said the idea for the projects was to bring in different cultures and low income families to see a better way of life. well we had a very diverse population then but by the 70s the area was no longer diverse. there was only 1 or 2 ethnics left.\n\nit was a horrible feeling to be forced from your homes and to try and find somewhere else safe to live. before you knew everyone in your neighborhood and they watched out for you, after there was never the same feeling of community.\n\ni now check real estate sites for the old neighborhood and see news articles that say it is coming back. the prices for homes and condos seem to reflect it. i have mentioned to my husband, who is also from that area, that it is still affordable and he just shakes his head and thinks i am crazy. after reading all the mail i know i have found other crazies. thanx for those great pictures. i have always loved the architecture of our bldgs. This was great.\n\nThank you for takeing me back. My uncle used to own a record store on West Avenue calld the Soul Stop\n\nand he owned the building on top of the records store.\n\nGod I walked all over the concourse as a child.\n\nMy family used to take night walks after dinner.\n\nWe would walk from Belmont Avenue up Tremont Avenue to the Concourse.\n\nAnd back every night.\n\nI found my dog names Sam on the concourse.\n\nI patted him on, his head and that was it.\n\nHe followed my family all the way home from the Concourse.\n\nThe next night we took him back to the same spot I found him.\n\nI let him go. The dog walked away.\n\nSo we proceeded to walk back home.\n\nand as we got to the front of building\n\nwho Came to meet and greet us.\n\nSame.\n\nOn live Belmont Avenue, near the lowest theater.\n\noh my I do I remove the block parties, barbecues PA L.summer camp.\n\ni live in Crotona park as a child i lovd Indian Lake play in the summer time.\n\nMy grandmother lived 656 E 176 St .\n\nSitting in front of the building in the summer.\n\nseeing the Fire hydrant a hot summer day.\n\nPraying not to get thrown in the hydrant and mess up my heir\n\nI always could run and walk up those steps on 174 St .\n\ni had family who lived up the block from the steps.\n\nI remember black light parties, waistline parties, and even rent parties,\n\nI was the youngest one at every party.\n\nThe Bronx was a wonderful please were i and my family growing up.\n\nI truly miss the family I had everyone looked out for one another.\n\nI remember having my first kiss in the Bronx.\n\nI had a remarkable lovely childhood in the Bronx. Hi this has been wonderful, was born an raised in the Bronx, what wonderful memories, I agree, best place to have lived an grown up there, born in 46. lived first on 180 th st. then moved to Hull ave. and lastly to sedgwick, off of fordham rd. a few blk. down from St. Tolentines, use to go there for fri. nite dances, went to EBB. jhs. then Roosevelt. rember going to the roller rink on Jerome ave. loved Alexanders, Loews pardise theater, was amazing, loved to go to krums, ice cream parlor, and Jahns. poe park, was great. Remember going for rides on the staten Island ferry, for a nickel, remember riding uses and trains for 15 cnts, and getting transfers to boot, to go anywhere. Remember going to orcard Beach, or to miramar pool, pool in manhattan, right across the 207 th. st.bridge, lived down the road from nyu. and hall of fame. I remember when I was real young, on 180th st. thay use to come around with a truck, with rides on it, lil, carousel, and ferris wheel. Remember the man coming, with the fruit an veg. cart, pulled by a horse. remember the ice man delivering the ice. also remember the man coming on sat. mornings, playing the harmonica, or someone playing the accordian, how about the monkey an organ grinder. oh yes, those were the day. thanku so much for all the wonderful memories, to share. Proud to have, lived an grown up in the Bronx, n.y. I grew up on Webb Avenue between Ames Place and 195th Street, Attended PS86 (Charlie Klein, Principal) from 1943 - 1949, and then on to PS79 (Creston Jr. High) in the SP program. From there to De Witt Clinton, class of 1954 (Walter Degnan, Principal) and then to CCNY. \"Graduated\" from Kingsbridge Heights Jewish Center, the place of my Bar Mitzvah.\n\nThe Bronx was just an absolutely great place to grow up. We played in the streets and the school yards and there was never a concern for safety. As real young kids, we had to walk up and down the stairs of the train station at Jerome Avenue and Kingsbridge Road to go to the Kingsbridge Theater (10 or 12 cents admission!)\n\nI would get 25 cents to go the Yankee games (I was first an avid Giants fan, then an equally avid Dodger fan but the Yanks were closer to go to games). The tickets were free, courtesy of the Police Athletic League. 10 cents was for the round trip subway (actually elevated all the way) to get to Yankee Stadium, and 15 cents to buy a soda to go along with my bag lunch.\n\nOh, such fond memories, but alas, they have been tarnished by return trips to the area many years ago (my mother-in-law still lived on Creston near 198th Street) and the deteriorization was horrible. After she was moved to Ft. Lee, NJ, for safety considerations, I have never returned there because I want to retain only the good images in my memory.\n\nOh, for a good kosher hot dog with kraut (and a soda, also for 25 cents when I went to PS 79 at the kosher deli across from the school), or a twisted pretzel from Izzy, the pretzel man.\n\nThanks for publishing these photos of (good) times gone by.\n\nMel M.Feeling nostalgic-did searches for various Bronx locales and was amazed to find not only the photos, but all the memories people shared.\n\nI was born September, 1937, Royal Hospital. My dad had finished medical school and was\n\nan intern at Beth David Hospital in NYC-but interns weren't supposed to be married back then! He started a practice in the same building we lived in on Townsend Avenue.\n\nBy the time I was 4 he was called to active duty for the duration of WWII and we followed\n\nhim to different bases till he went to New Guinea. We always came back to the Bronx\n\nwhenever we could to visit relatives on Morris Avenue and to go to the Mt Eden Shul. All\n\nI remember was sitting in the women's \"gallery\" upstairs with my grandmother and nothing was said in English. After the war my parents bought a house on Cedar Avenue-going down\n\nFordham Rd it was the last street before the bridge over to Inwood. Many of my friends\n\nlived 2 blocks away on Sedgwick. I can't remember if my first school was PS 90 or 91!\n\nMr Spiro was the principle (I began there in 1946 in 4th grade). Went to EBB then was supposed to choose Walton or Roosevelt. I didn't want to go to either and used my aunt's\n\naddress to go to Taft-graduated 1955. In early 1956 my parents had sold the house and moved to Westchester and I got married and lived in the Kingsbridge section till we too\n\nwent to Westchester. I did come back to have my first child born in Lebanon Hospital, 1958. Memories-wow, I could fill a book!\n\nDuring the 40s I remember street vendors in horse drawn carts-the Dugans man sold cake,\n\nthere was a knife sharpener guy and the rag man who called out \"I buy old clothes\".\n\nlate 40s thru 50's-roller skating in the streets and once in a while at the indoor rink\n\non Jerome Avenue. I remember when buses replaced the trolley car. We went a couple of\n\ntimes a month riding across Fordham to hang out at the Bronx Zoo. Alexanders was the only place to buy clothes for my family! My dad had a family medical practice in the\n\nSouth Bronx on Union Avenue. I remember that when I was not much older then 12 it was not unusual for us kids to take the subway to go hang out in Manhattan. Nobody worried\n\nabout safety. We went to ice skate in Central Park, to the Museum of Natural History, to\n\nsee the Xmas decorations and go to the show at Radio City Music Hall. Of course the Pardise is memorable, but we also went to RKO Fordham and Loews. Remember when there waa a Third Avenue El? Anybody remember the Windsor Theatre going way down Fordham? It had\n\ntriple features and even some vaudeville acts-and stage plays till around 1953 or so.\n\nI'm also remembering when the put up the \"luxurious\" Fordham Hill apartments. Very\n\nparticular management-friends who lived there said they weren't allowed to hang up their\n\nown pictures! Maintenance staff had to do it. Some of my Irish friends who were 2 years\n\nolder graduated HS at St Nicholas of Tolentine. It's still there-the church but not the H.S. I remember rushing home from school to catch the '51 world series on tv. It was\n\nDimaggio's last season, Mantle's first...and I had a major crush on Mickey!\n\nAh, the ramblings of a 72 year old! I have 4 kids, 9 grandkids-none will ever know\n\nwhat it was like to grow up in that kind of neighborhood and with that degree of freedom\n\nto roam the whole borough and the city too. Oh, oh-can't leave this out-at EBB (where\n\nboys had shop and girls had an apartment to learn cooking and cleaning) often went to lunch at a Jewish deli to get hot dogs and potato knishes and to a bakery to get something that has never been duplicated in quite the same delicious way-a Charlotte Russe Hi, I am making some enquiries on the off chance that someone may know the Wilson Family, I dont know much really except the Mother was so I am lead to believe German and the father U,S they had a son called Scolfied Wilson who was born in 1955, the father was a Broker in precious minerals and worked away a lot on business, leaving his son with MUM a lot until his un timely death( the father that is ) died when his young son was but 12 years of age, leaving a widow and son to manage alone, they left The bronx to go back to germany and stayed there for a number of years, but for how long I do not know, and then came back to USA. If any one has any info on this small family then I would like to hear something even if its a teeny bit, ( it seems the ancestors were"
