        "text": "The Halcyon Company is a privately financed, media development company headed by Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek respectively. They are perhaps known for recently acquiring the development rights to the Terminator franchise.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe company was co-founded by Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek.\n\nIn May 2007, Halcyon acquired all of the rights in relationship to the Terminator franchise. These rights include the right to produce any future Terminator films, as well as all future merchandising and licensing rights, certain future revenues derived from Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, as well as certain rights in the television project Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles and the sole right to produce all future Terminator projects in any new or existing media.\n\nWarner Bros. acquired the North American distribution rights, allowing them to distribute the upcoming Terminator film, Terminator Salvation. The film began production in early 2008.\n\nIn November 2007, the company reported that it was creating its own video games subsidiary, Halcyon Games and will be making a video game adaptation of the upcoming film.\n\nFirst Look Rights to Philip K. Dick Works[]\n\nIn October 2007, Halcyon acquired the first-look rights to the works of writer Philip K. Dick. This includes access to more than 45 novels and 120 short stories, selected of which will be developed in co-operation with Electric Shepherd Productions, which is owned by Dick's daughters.\n\nScreen adaptions of Dick's work include films of Total Recall, Blade Runner, and Minority Report. Potential new adaptions from Dick's work include Ubik, The Man in the High Castle, The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer.\n\nFilmography[]"
