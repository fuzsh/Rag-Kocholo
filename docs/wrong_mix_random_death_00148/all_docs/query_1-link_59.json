        "text": "Toronto- and Los Angeles-based virtual reality (VR) studio Secret Location has adapted a Philip K. Dick short story for VR, and is set to debut the resulting experience at the Venice Film Festival next month. It’s the first-ever adaptation of one of the author’s works for VR.\n\nPhilip K. Dick’s “The Great C” was first published in 1953. The story is about a post-apocalyptic world ruled by a computer that requires yearly sacrifices from a nearby tribe. Secret Location‘s adaptation focuses on a woman who has to decide whether she should rebel against those cruel traditions.\n\n“Philip K. Dick’s wonderfully forward-thinking stories have always felt primed for telling in equally forward-thinking mediums,” said Secret Location co-founder and president Ryan Andal. “Pairing ‘The Great C’s’ provocative themes with our VR development prowess is helping us redefine how we consume sci-fi stories.”\n\nFollowing it premiere at the Venice Film Festival, “The Great C” will debut as a timed exclusive at select location-based VR venues in September. After that, it will be released on Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Playstation VR as well.\n\nPopular on Variety"
