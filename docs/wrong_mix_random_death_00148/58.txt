Blurb: "The most consistently brilliant sf writer in the world is Philip K. Dick, author of more good short stories that I can count. He presents subsidiary characters so that leap alive off the page; he creates obsessive, almost paranoid, terror when the action calls for in-the ties the plot lines into knots b time-travel devices and then meticulous untangles every last thread again. If you want to witness a master of sf ringing changes the rest of us have never dreamed of, read Philip K. Dick."

-JOHN BRUNNER

"The best of Philip K. Dick's novelettes and short stories show the same fertile speculative mind that distinguishes his novels, plus an exuber-ant, almost extravagant love of wild melodramatic action. You'll find reflections of our own society in these pictures of the future, plus one of Dick's most characteristic qualities: the chilling symbolism of absolute nightmare

-ANTHONY BOUCHER

"If there is such a thing as 'black science fic-tion,' Philip K. Dick is its Pirandello, its Beckett and its Pinter. No other creative intellect qualifies."

-HARLAN ELLISON
