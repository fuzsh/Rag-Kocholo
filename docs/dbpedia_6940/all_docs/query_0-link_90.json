In addition to respecting all basic human rights, a just society invests in equal opportunities, reparations for past injustices, and privileges within a society. By drawing attention to areas of injustice, social justice advocates work to change laws, raise awareness, and shift public attitudes. Movies can be one of the most effective and accessible vehicles for progress. Here are 13 social justice movies everyone should see:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n#1. The Janes #2. Loving #3. Bedlam #4. The Accused #5. Fruitvale Station #6. The Invisible War #7. The Hate U Give #8. Coded Bias #9. Writing with Fire #10. Belly of the Beast #11. Dear White People #12. Spotlight #13. Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution\n\nThe Janes (2022)\n\nDirectors: Tia Lessin and Emma Pildes\n\nBefore Roe v. Wade, a group of Chicago activists called “The Janes” built an underground network in the late 1960s. They helped women access safe low-cost or free abortions. Ads would appear in places where women tended to gather, reading “Pregnant? Call Jane.” For years, only a few of the group members, including leaders Ruth Surgal and Jody Parsons, spoke publicly. In this 2022 documentary, more women came forward about their activist roles for the first time. The Supreme Court has now overturned Roe v. Wade, making “The Janes” essential viewing for those who care about reproductive rights.\n\nLoving (2016)\n\nDirector/writer: Jeff Nichols\n\nIn 1958, Richard and Mildred Loving were sentenced to a year in prison. Their crime? They were an interracial couple. Mildred, a woman of color, and Richard, who was white, had violated Virginia’s Racial Integrity Act of 1924 by getting married. They appealed their conviction until it reached the U.S. Supreme Court. This film, starring Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton, tells the story of the couple and their fight to have their marriage recognized. The film received many award nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Ruth Negga for Best Actress.\n\nBedlam (2019)\n\nDirector/writer: Kenneth Paul Rosenburg\n\nFilmed over five years, this powerful documentary exposes the mental health crisis facing the United States. Viewers go into psychiatric emergency rooms, jails with psychiatric patients, and homeless camps. The director, who is also a psychiatrist, brings his personal experience into the film, as well. His late sister had schizophrenia. The film features experts, activists, individuals with mental illness, and family members of those struggling with mental illness. The film has been screened by organizations like the American Psychiatric Association, the Vera Institute of Justice, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and others. The 2019 book BEDLAM: An Intimate Journey in America’s Mental Health Crisis, expands on the film’s ideas and provides concrete solutions.\n\nThe Accused (1988)\n\nDirector: Jonathon Kaplan\n\nAfter Sarah (Jodie Foster) is gang-raped in public at a bar, she and the deputy district attorney try to get justice. The problem? Sarah was taking drugs and acting flirtatiously, therefore not fitting the role of a “perfect victim.” The attorney must demonstrate that Sarah’s actions did not bring the attack on herself and that the rapists are the ones on trial, not Sarah. The case must also reckon with everyone who watched the attack instead of stopping it. While controversial in some areas (including in the filmmaker’s decision to depict the assault), the film was ahead of its time in tackling issues such as victim-blaming, harassment, and the court system. Jodie Foster won the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nFruitvale Station (2013)\n\nDirector/writer: Ryan Coogler\n\nBased on true events, “Fruitvale Station” tells the story of 22-year-old Oscar Grant, a Black man killed by a BART police officer at Fruitvale Station in Oakland, California. Viewers follow Oscar during his last day alive on New Year’s Eve, 2009. He argues with his girlfriend, tries to get his job back, and goes to his mother’s birthday party. Through these seemingly mundane events, the film paints a picture of a life cut off for no good reason, drawing attention to police brutality in a realistic, truthful way. The film propelled both Michael B. Jordan and director/writer Ryan Coogler into superstardom. “Fruitvale Station” has a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe Invisible War (2012)\n\nDirector/writer: Kirby Dick\n\nThis documentary pulls back the curtain on sexual assault within the US military. It follows veterans from all branches of the United States Armed Forces as they share their stories of harassment and assault. When survivors tried to get justice, the military justice system punished them instead of the perpetrators. More often than not, the careers of those who came forward were destroyed. The film significantly increased awareness of the issue and led to policy changes. “The Invisible War” won a Peabody Award and was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 85th Academy Awards.\n\nThe Hate U Give (2018)\n\nDirector: George Tillman, Jr.\n\nBased on the bestselling YA novel by Angie Thomas, “The Hate U Give” tells the story of 16-year-old Starr Carter. After leaving a party, Starr and her best friend Khali try to drive home. They’re stopped by a police officer, who orders Khalil to get out of the car. When the teenager reaches for a hairbrush, the cop shoots and kills Khalil in front of Starr. The film explores the aftermath of the murder as it becomes national news and Starr deals with her grief and desire to bring Khalil’s killer to justice. The film features Amandla Stenberg as Starr, who won the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture.\n\nCoded Bias (2020)\n\nDirector: Shalini Kantayya\n\nAs artificial intelligence weaves itself into more of our lives, who is watching out for us? In this documentary, M.I.T. Media Lab computer scientist Joy Buolamwini discovers that some facial recognition technology doesn’t recognize dark-skinned faces or women. This means that the algorithms meant to eliminate bias and prejudice are just as biased as the people programming them. Why does this matter? As AI seeps into areas like housing, job interview selections, healthcare access, and more, that bias spreads, too. Buolamwini begins advocating for more transparency and accountability. The film features other figures in the field, including data journalists, watchdog activists, human rights lawyers, and more.\n\nWriting with Fire (2021)\n\nDirector: Sushmit Ghosh and Rintu Thomas\n\nAfter 14 years of print, the newspaper Khabar Lahirya, which is run by Dalit women, starts the move to digital journalism. With smartphones, the female journalists report from India’s most dangerous regions, risking their safety and lives to share the truth. The film follows these journalists as they defy tradition. “Writing with Fire” was the first Indian feature documentary to receive an Academy Award nomination. It has received universal critical acclaim and international awards.\n\nBelly of the Beast (2020)\n\nDirector: Erika Cohn\n\nFilmed over seven years, “Belly of the Beast” exposes the horrendous human rights violations happening in female prisons like the Central California Women’s Facility. The investigation uncovers violations like sexual abuse, assault, forced sterilizations, poor healthcare, and targeted malice against women of color. With accounts from current and formerly incarcerated people as well as lawyers, “Belly of the Beast” reveals how eugenics is still a part of society and how it targets some of the most vulnerable people in the country. The film was a 2021 Peabody Nominee and won an Emmy for Outstanding Current Affairs Documentary.\n\nDear White People (2014)\n\nDirector/writer: Justin Simien\n\nThis satirical comedy-drama follows a group of Black students at a fictional Ivy League college. Student Samantha White (Tessa Thompson) sparks controversy when she criticizes white people on her radio show. When she runs to become the head of house of an all-Black house on campus, tensions increase, including between her and Troy, her ex-boyfriend. Things reach a tipping point when an influential white student throws a blackface party. Through dark humor, the film examines racial identity in the supposed “post-racial” America before Donald Trump’s election, as well as what it means for young people to try and find themselves. In 2017, Netflix adapted the series into a show which ran for four seasons.\n\nSpotlight (2015)\n\nDirector: Tom McCarthy\n\nIn 2001, The Boston Globe’s “Spotlight” investigative team began looking at sexual abuse in the Catholic church. Initially reporting on one story, the team uncovers a disturbing pattern involving other priests in Massachusetts. They also learn that the Church is actively protecting abusive priests. The newspaper’s coverage increased awareness and reporting on the many other abuse cases in the United States and abroad. One of the most striking movies about how journalism holds the powerful accountable, “Spotlight” received six Academy Award nominations and won Best Picture.\n\nCrip Camp: A Disability Revolution (2020)\n\nDirector/writer: Nicole Newnham and James LeBrecht\n\nIn 1971, teenagers head off to summer camp at Camp Jened, a camp designed as a “free-spirited” camp for teens with disabilities. Years later, James LeBrecht, who was born with spina bifida, talks to his co-director Nicole Newnham about how he wants to see a documentary involving his work as a disability rights advocate. He mentions wanting to see a movie about Camp Jened. It became more than a fun place for kids with disabilities; it inspired a group to join the disability rights movement and advocate for radical change. The movie was released on Netflix in 2020 and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature."
