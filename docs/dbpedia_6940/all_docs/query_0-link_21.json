        "text": "''What has always troubled me about 'King Lear' is that Shakespeare gives his characters no past. We are plunged directly into the agonies of their present dilemmas without knowing how they came to this point.'' Unexpected criticism of the Bard from an unlikely source, but the thought takes on greater meaning as Akira Kurosawa pursues it in discussing ''Ran,'' his newest film, which has been called an adaptation of ''King Lear.'' ''How did Lear acquire the power that, as an old man, he abuses with such disastrous effects? Without knowing his past, I've never really understood the ferocity of his daughters' response to Lear's feeble attempts to shed his royal power. In 'Ran' I've tried to give Lear a history. I try to make clear that his power must rest upon a lifetime of bloodthirsty savagery. Forced to confront the consequences of his misdeeds, he is driven mad. But only by confronting his evil head on can he transcend it and begin to struggle again toward virtue.''\n\nAt 75, Japan's most acclaimed film director has taken on one of the most challenging monuments of Western literature and produced what many critics have hailed as the crowning work in a career studded with masterpieces. In ''Ran,'' which translates as ''Chaos'' or ''Turmoil,'' he manages to balance the familiar domestic tragedy of ''Lear'' against the panoramic background of Japan's 16th-century civil wars. His epic film opens this Friday at Cinema 1. Reviewing ''Ran'' at the opening of the New York Film Festival last September, Vincent Canby compared it to the greatest epics of Sergei Eisenstein, D. W. Griffith and Abel Gance - hallowed company for this Japanese director who greatly admires all three giants of world cinema.\n\nThis is not the first time Mr. Kurosawa has turned to Shakespeare for inspiration. His ''Throne of Blood'' (1957), a transposition of ''Macbeth'' to Japan's medieval era of civil warfare, attracted the admiration even of Shakespearean purists and is considered one of the most successful film adaptations of Shakespeare. ''The Bad Sleep Well'' (1960) has been called ''a Japanese 'Hamlet' in modern dress,'' although Mr. Kurosawa claims no such parallel to Shakespeare's play. In the case of ''Ran,'' he does not deny the relationship to ''King Lear,'' but insists that it is secondary. ''I started out to make a film about Motonari Mori, the 16th-century warlord whose three sons are admired in Japan as paragons of filial virtue,'' he said. ''What might their story be like, I wondered, if the sons had not been so good? It was only after I was well into writing the script about these imaginary unfilial sons of the Mori clan that the similarities to 'Lear' occurred to me. Since my story is set in medieval Japan, the protagonist's children had to be men; to divide a realm among daughters would have been unthinkable.''\n\nWith a budget of $12 million, ''Ran'' is the most expensive film ever made in Japan, and its completion represents a hard-won victory for Mr. Kurosawa. Writing with two colleagues, as is his custom, he had completed the first script for ''Ran'' nearly a decade ago. Over the intervening years, however, one Japanese producer after another shied away from the intimidating scale of the project, fearing Mr. Kurosawa's reputation for obsessive perfectionism and disregard for budgets and schedules."
