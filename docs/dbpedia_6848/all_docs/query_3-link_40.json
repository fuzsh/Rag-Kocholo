        "text": "Mr. Dave Gelly wrote in the fully packed Sunday issue of the UK-based “Observer” the following about our OSCAR PETERSON/BEN WEBSTER album “During This Time”:\n\n“A beautifully recorded CD and DVD package, previously unreleased, of a 1972 concert in Hannover. Peterson, leading his trio, is as immaculate as usual. Simply watching the ease with which he brings off wonders of virtuosity is almost enough in itself. Webster, by this stage, was ailing and reduced to sitting down to play the tenor saxophone, but he still had his moments, and there’s a beauty here. His performance of Ellington’s Come Sunday is as delicate and full of feeling as any I ever heard. This may have been his last really great performance. He died nine months later.”\n\nNicolas Pillai of LONDON JAZZ Magazine also listened to “During The Time” done by Oscar Peterson, Ben Webster, Tony Inzalaco and Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen wrote the following in his review:\n\n“NHØP provides typically urbane, intricate solos, while Inzalaco and Webster riff nicely off one another. Peterson displays his customary ease at switching roles, sometimes a bandleader, sometimes an accompanist. Skipping tempo, his piano’s notes tumble and fall into place, a percussive cascade. During Webster’s solo in Ben’s Blues, Peterson stops playing and leans back, clicking his fingers and clapping in time. It’s a moment of perfect happiness, one of many in this magnificent concert.”\n\nYou can read the whole review via this link:"
