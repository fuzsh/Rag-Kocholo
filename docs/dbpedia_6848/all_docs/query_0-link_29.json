        "text": "Previously Unissued: Ben & Oscar's last ever collaboration!\n\nThis outstanding DVD gives us the rare opportunity to not only listen to one of the most important and influential tenor saxophonists in jazz: Ben Webster, but to see him in performance, exquisitely backed by the Oscar Peterson Trio (featuring Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen). This performance marks their final collaboration (and their only known recording together after 1959), as Ben died less than a year later, on September 20, 1973.\n\nBen Webster (ts), Oscar Peterson (p), N.H.Ø.P. (b) & Tony Inzalco (d). NDR Jazzworkshop TV broadcast. Live at the Funkhaus, Hannover, December 14, 1972.\n\nTracks:\n\n1. Poutin'\n\n2. Sunday\n\n3. I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good\n\n4. Perdido, 5. Come Sunday\n\n6. For All We Know\n\n7. Cottontail.\n\nRunning time: 55 min. (Color / Stereo)\n\nNOTE: Although German TV recorded tracks 8 to 10, they were not filmed, as the original broadcast was shorter than the actual concert. In order to complete Ben Webster's performance from this evening (\"Autumn Leaves\" is a piano solo by Peterson), these are included as audio bonus tracks.\n\nBonus Audio Tracks from the concert:\n\n8. Ben's Blues\n\n9. In a Mellow Tone\n\n10. Autumn Leaves\n\nBonus audio running time: 23 min."
