        "text": "Thomas Clausen 3\n\nRain\n\nBaystate (Japan) 1982\n\nRJL-8035 (LP) w/obi, insert.\n\nsleeve : EX+(one very small and slightly spot, still good.)\n\nmedia : EX/EX(some slightly surface noises.)\n\nThe Danish jazz pianist Thomas Clausen, known for his work with Palle Mikkelborg's group Mirror, and with visiting Danish soloists such as Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis, Ben Webster, Joe Henderson and Elvin Jones, has recorded a trio album with bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen and drummer Aage Tanggaard. All but B1 are composed by Thomas Clausen, and the rest of the album is modern jazz, mainly straight-ahead bebop, but, with A1 maintaining its coolness and building emotionally; A2 features a nice bass solo intertwined with a minimalist refrained piano arpeggio; B2 builds in intensity towards the latter half of the album. Check out the essential urban contemporary jazz that combines the lyrical and urban sensibilities of ECM's Scandinavian counterparts. It's a great feeling.\n\nA1:Julie\n\nA2:Rain"
