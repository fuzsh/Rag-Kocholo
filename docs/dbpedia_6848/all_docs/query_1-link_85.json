Wondering specifically about Webster Plays Ballads.\n\nIt's here: Ben Webster Plays Ballads - Remastered - Storyville Records - The Best in Jazz since 1952\n\nAny input is greatly appreciated!\n\nAnother bump. I'm curious as well.\n\nThe language on the web site (\"The audio has been remastered specifically for vinyl\") suggests to me that these were cut from digital (hopefully hi-res), but with no info on who mastered them or where they were pressed (nothing on Discogs either), I'm hesitant to take the plunge.\n\nWhole series:\n\nBig Bill Broonzy / An Evening With Big Bill Broonzy\n\nMagic Slim / Born On A Bad Sign\n\nSonny Boy Williamson II / The Blues Of Sonny Boy Williamson\n\nArchie Shepp & John Tchicai / Archie Shepp & The New York Contemporary Five\n\nBud Powell & Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen (NHØP) / Bouncing With Bud\n\nBen Webster / Ben Webster Plays Ballads\n\nSahib Shihab / Sentiments\n\nCharlie Parker / Charlie Parker In Sweden 1950"
