        "meta_description": "At Montmartre 1965/66 by Ben Webster, released 16 March 2020\n\n1. Pennies from Heaven\n2. Blues in B Flat\n3. My Romance, Pt. 1\n4. In a Mellotone\n5. How Long Has This Been Going On\n6. Sunday\n7. Someone to Watch over Me\n8. Cottontail, Pt. 1\n9. Danny Boy\n10. Gone with the Wind\n11. Cottontail, Pt. 2\n12. My Romance, Pt. 2\n\nNever before released, this 74-minute CD contains 12 tracks recorded live during two gigs at the Montmartre jazz club in Copenhagen in 1965 and 1966. Except for one original composition by Webster, the repertoire on the CD consists of standards, almost half of which are ballads. A fine improvisator, Ben Webster nevertheless always sticks to the melody, throwing in his trademark tonal distortions and variations which includes characteristic ”growls”, ”shouts”, bent notes and his famous, airy ”whisper”. The two rhythm sections are comprised of three internationally-acclaimed Danes, one Swede, and the famous American pianist Kenny Drew. This wonderful CD serves to strengthen Ben Webster’s title as the ballad master of the tenor saxophone; check out his rendition of ”Someone To Watch Out Over Me”, for example.",
