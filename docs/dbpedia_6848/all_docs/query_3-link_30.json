        "text": "Born in Montreal, Canada in 1945 to parents from the West Indies, Oscar Peterson became one of the most renowned pianists in jazz history.\n\nOn February 22-23 in The Appel Room at Jazz at Lincoln Center, six extraordinary pianists come together to celebrate Piano Master: The Oscar Peterson Story. This special event celebrates the 70th anniversary of Peterson’s 1949 epic United States debut concert at Carnegie Hall.\n\nThe all-star piano lineup consists of NEA Jazz Master Kenny Barron, Afro-Cuban jazz legend Gonzalo Rubalcaba, rising stars Gerald Clayton and Ben Paterson, and Peterson’s two protégés: Robi Botos and Benny Green. The rhythm section also features the best in the business: bassist John Clayton (this evening’s Music Director), drummer Jeff Hamilton and guitarist Uls Wakenius with vocalist Paul Marinaro.\n\nAs a child, Oscar Peterson studied the classical music of Franz Liszt, practicing four to six hours a day. He eventually came to love jazz and boogie woogie and earned the nickname “the Brown Bomber of the Boogie Woogie.” By 1950 he joined up with bassist Ray Brown as a duo and eventually worked duos with Barney Kessel, Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, Joe Pass, Count Basie, and Herbie Hancock. He later collaborated with Ben Webster, Clark Terry, Milt Jackson and with his protégé Benny Green. Peterson’s main influences were Teddy Wilson, Nat King Cole, and Art Tatum.\n\n{\"id\":67,\"instanceName\":\"Oscar Peterson LIVE - C Jam Blues: - Ad = JIE Winter Mag (copy)\",\"videos\":[{\"videoType\":\"youtube\",\"title\":\"Oscar Peterson -

It was largely through him that I really got into jazz. In Philly, where I’m from, we had one of the best jazz radio stations back in the late-50s. That’s how I heard a lot of music. That’s how I fell into the music. Bill got me my first gig playing in a band he played in.”\n\nOf this evening’s Oscar Peterson salute, Barron replies, “I appreciated his prowess at the keyboard, his mastery of the piano. Going back to the 50s when I first heard him, he was just astounding, really astounding. It is an honor to play this show for him.”\n\nBarron has performed with just about everybody including some soulful hard bop with Freddie Hubbard and Stanley Turrentine. But before that he honed his chops with Roy Haynes, Lee Morgan, James Moody, Dizzy Gillespie, Yusef Latef, Milt Jackson, and then on to Ron Carter, Buster Williams, Ben Riley, Charlie Rouse, Sonny Stitt, Eddie Harris, Eddie “Lockjaw”, Harry “Sweets” Edison, Stan Getz and Charlie Haden. More recently he’s worked with Grady Tate, Ann Hampton Calloway, Gretchen Parlato, Dave Holland, and Lionel Loueke. He is a piano man in demand!\n\n“The piano functions the same as a guitar. It supplies the harmony, that’s #1,” Barron explains. “It supplies the harmony for everything. No matter who’s playing or what’s being played, you have to have the piano underneath, harmonic underpinning. The piano serves that function, as well as being as a solo instrument. That’s the importance of the piano. That’s the instrument that got me!\n\nBarron was a professor at Rutgers University for 25 years before also teaching several years at Juilliard. He has since taken a break at the music schools. He has a love for his students and the art of teaching. “I’m trying to learn as much as I can now. Its great to be able to give back and that’s what its really all about…is to give back. With the students, by the time they got to me, they were almost fully formed. They were on their way to developing their own musical personalities. What I do is offer refinement, more than anything else; touch and developing melodic ideas and things like that.\n\nTo attend a great concert and be moved by it and walk out feeling inspired and fulfilled, that is what makes this art form called jazz almost spiritual. “Well, it is magic in a sense. Each person, and on any instrument, each person has their own particular, individual touch. In the case of the piano, or horn, trumpet or saxophone, it’s developing their own individual sound. For me, it was Tommy Flanagan and Hank Jones. That’s who got me, in terms of how I touch the piano. I can listen to Monk and identify him because his sound was a lot more percussive, or Randy Weston, they were both very percussive players. I could listen to the way Barry Harris would play lines and I could hear that he was influenced by Bud Powell.\n\nThe variety of pianists on this bill is wide and varied. Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba received the praise of Chicago Tribune writer Howard Reich, “… Gonzalo Rubalcaba ranks among the most accomplished jazz pianists in the world today and perhaps stands at the top of that elite group, thanks to a colossal technique and an unfettered musical imagination.” Four time Grammy® nominated pianist Gerald Clayton studied with Kenny Barron. In 2018, upcoming pianist Ben Paterson was named as the First Place winner of the inaugural Ellis Marsalis International Jazz Piano Competition. Hungarian-born and raised in Canada, pianist Robi Bota is also a protégé of Oscar Peterson and has worked with everyone from Branford Marsalis to Chaka Khan. This performance promises to leave you with a whole new vision of the piano as a prominent jazz essential.\n\n“I love playing at Jazz at Lincoln Center,” exclaims Kenny Barron. “The pianos, in all the rooms, the pianos are great. As a matter of fact, when they first opened, Bill Charlap and I tried several pianos at the Steinway factory for Dizzy’s Club. The sound, in all the rooms, the sound is really good. It’s spacious. I love playing there.”\n\n“Everybody’s different and that’s the way it should be.” – Kenny Barron\n\nFor further information/TIX – visit: jazz.org\n\nSenior writer: Scott H.
