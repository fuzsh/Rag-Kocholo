        "text": "French pianist Petrucciani and Danish bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen are now dead, but this amazing 1994 live set captures the virtuosity of both at its awe-inspiring peak. Technical wizardry is taken for granted, but it's the prodigious speed of reaction and fertility of invention that knocks you back. In fact, the double-CD set is too much to swallow at one listening and I would recommend taking it a few tracks at a time. The tunes are all well-known standards, but it's what they do with them that counts."
