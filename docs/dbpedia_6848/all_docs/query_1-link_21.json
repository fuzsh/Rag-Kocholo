        "text": "Alex Riel was born September 1940 in Copenhagen, Denmark, and has since the sixties remained firmly established as one of the most significant and influential jazz drummers in Europe. Â His career began in the early sixties where he was the house drummer at the legendary jazz club \"Montmartre\" in Copenhagen. The rhythm section also included bass player Niels-Henning Ãrsted Pedersen and alternately pianists Tete Montuliu and Kenny Drew. During this time Alex Riel got to accompany a vast number of visiting international stars as Ben Webster, Dexter Gordon, Kenny Dorham, Don Byas, Donald Byrd, Yusef Lateef and many more.\n\nThis experience led to Alex Riel being chosen as the âDanish Jazz Musician Of the Yearâ in 1965, and shortly hereafter he released his first recording as a bandleader. It was a trio recording with Niels-Henning Ãrsted Pedersen and Kenny Drew which has now become collectorâs item.Â In 1965-66 Alex Riel also toured in Europe as a member of the renowned pianist Bill Evansâ trio with bassist Eddie Gomez. Â\n\nOver the years Alex Riel has played with an impressive number of fine jazz musicians representing both the traditional and the modern way. His very first impression of jazz drumming was that of Big Sid Catlett and Zutty Zingleton, and this early influence is still perceptible in his playing. However Rielâs appearance with musicians such as Wayne Shorter, Freddie Hubbard, Jackie McLean, Archie Shepp, Michel Petrucciani, Gary Burton, John Scofield etc has made him widely known as an outstanding modern drummer taking up the styles of drummers Elvin Jones, Roy Haynes and Tony Williams.\n\nAlex Riel has also been working a great deal outside the jazz area. He was a founding member of âThe Savage Roseâ - one of the most significant Scandinavian rock groups ever â with whom he recorded several albums. They toured extensively around Europe and US in the late 60s and early 70s. In 1969 they played at the original Newport Festival in USA where they shared the stage with Jethru Tull and James Brown. In addition to this, Alex Riel has drawn attention to himself as a rock drummer through his long time work with the successful Danish singer and composer Sebastian. Riel has furthermore been playing in a number of jazz-rock fusion bands.Â\n\nEver since the late 50âs Alex Riel has played as a sideman on several hundred jazz recordings with various international artists. During the last decade heâs been releasing CDâs in his own name as well.
