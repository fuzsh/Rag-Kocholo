The most reliable pickup- real top quality. It is also PA-friendly and well sounding also when playing arco. I can warmly recommend it!\n\nAnders Jormin - Sweden\n\nJAHMAL NICHOLS\n\nby JAHMAL NICHOLS\n\nDouble bass\n\n\"Wilson pickup is in a league of its own with its own unique sound that will go with any style and any player!!! \" Jahmal Nichols - USA\n\nFLORIAN GALOW\n\nby FLORIAN GALOW\n\nDouble bass\n\n\"In 1992 i had the great honour and pleasure to meet Niels Henning Ørsted-Pedersen for lessons in Ishøy at his home. In the evening i wanted to pay for the lessons, but he didn‘t took the Money but told me to buy the Wilson Pickup which i also used!! Since this time i use the K4 and with his perfectness i created my own sound. I am very thankful to met Ole Boje Wilson in Lübeck and looking foreward to see him and his Kind wife soon again!\n\nThank you for this fantastic pickupsystem,\"\n\nYours, Florian Galow - Germany\n\nASIER SUBERBIOLA\n\nby ASIER SUBERBIOLA\n\nDouble bass\n\n“I have been using the Wilson Pick ups (V1&V2) in the last 3 years. I played with them in several styles from world music, to jazz, rock or electronic music, many times adding effects as wah-wah and delays. The sound of this pick-up is very pure and pizzicato sound is simply amazing! I recommend Wilson to professionals who are looking for getting the most accoustic sound possible when they are amplifying their instrument with a pick up.”\n\nAsier Suberbiola - Spain\n\nYARKIN TUNCER\n\nby YARKIN TUNCER\n\nDouble bass\n\nI can't believe how a piezo pick-up is that much sharp and precise of magnetic so that it can give an acoustic tone away from the electronic sound of the magnetic. As a performer who have tried several pick-ups and magnetics, this is the BEST pick-up I have ever tried in terms of articulation, sustain, harmonics and clarity. Therefore, it also offers ease of playing ! I found the tone I was seeking for and I highly recommend who wants to acquire good tone from their bass.\n\nThanks a lot Wilson !\n\nYarkın Tuncer - Turkey\n\nELLEN ANDREA WANG\n\nDouble bass\n\n\"You´re sound is your signature! The Wilson Pickup System has helped me form my sound on stage. I can always rely on it giving me the best possible sound, from smaller jazz clubs to big concert venues. I really enjoy using Wilson.\"\n\nEllen Andrea Wang, Norway, 2018\n\nPETE SAGE\n\nby PETE SAGE\n\nViolin\n\nThank heavens I found Wilson pickups for my violins by coincidence after having spent a small fortune on other systems, some of which were bordering on useless for my expectations or just didn´t offer the range of flexibility which the Wilson pickups have.\n\nI chose the twin pickup system after trying one system out first as I have four differently tuned violins on stage which, with other systems, produced differing sound levels and tonal quality. The Wilson gave me the opportunity to solve those problems instantly and the jack-plug which is built into the chin rest presented an uncluttered violin surface. The sound level and tone I can get on stage is astonishing earning great praise from our sound engineers. The other main advantage is that the pickup system can be built into any bridge allowing for easy maintenance.\n\nSome musicians might find the system to be expensive but in the long-run, much better to buy a Wilson at the start instead of spending thousands of Euros on experiments as I did.\n\nLast but not least, the crowning glory of all is the personal help given by Wilson.\n\nMany, many thanks Ole!\n\nPete Sage, Germany 2018\n\nhttps://www.universal-music.de/santiano/\n\nSANDY CAMERON\n\nby SANDY CAMERON\n\nViolin\n\nIt has been such a joy and privilege to use the Wilson pickup. As a classical violinist who enjoys playing a variety of musical genres, it is a blessing to be able to use a pickup that is both safe and of premium quality. With the Wilson pickup, I don't have to sacrifice the best sound of my instrument; nor do I have to worry about physical damage to the surface of my violin. Thank you, Wilson Pickups!\n\nSandy Cameron, US 2016\n\nNIELS-HENNING ØRSTED PEDERSEN (May 27th 1946 - April 19th 2005)\n\nby NIELS-HENNING ØRSTED PEDERSEN (May 27th 1946 - April 19th 2005)\n\nI think that the sound production of this pick-up is the closest one can possibly get to the paradox of an \"amplified acoustic double bass\"! The WILSON Pick-up is the best transducer for double bass I have ever seen and heard. An Excellent offer to the bass players who want their sound amplified but tolerate absolutely no distortion of their music. I can warmly recommend the WILSON Pick-up system.\n\nNiels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen DK (1946 -2005)\n\nBO STIEF\n\nby BO STIEF\n\nDouble bass\n\nWilson Pickup. In my world the Wilson Pick-up rules. I have been a happy and satisfied Wilson user since 1986. I am very interested in sound. I have been doing a lot of studio work through my life. When you record a lot you have the chance to get to know your sound. The Wilson Pick-up gives me the sound that is closest to the sound of my 200-year-old great upright acous-tic sound. The nuances details the sustain and the singing sound of my beautiful bass comes out with the Wilson system. Live the Wilson Pickup always works. You get a clear reliable sound that also works with effects. As soon as new bass pickup and microphone systems arrive on the scene I always try them but my sound is a Wilson sound.Recently I found a Stagg Stick Bass. Particularly this bass fits my hands. I chanced the sound system on the bass to a Wilson 4. Now I can travel with a well sounding upright. Thanks to Wilson, Bo Stief, DK\n\nCHRIS MINH DOKY\n\nDouble bass\n\nI love using the Wilson Pick-up System. Not only does it sound very natural but it also gives me a very strong signal without feeding back. I have used it for years with my own band and bands like Michael Brecker Quartet to David Sanborn to Mike Stern. This alone shows you the wide spectrum of this pick up. Acoustic jazz funk and jazz-rock. For the acoustic bass the Wilson Pick Up got it all! Chris Minh Doky - Denmark\n\nMADS TOLLING\n\nby MADS TOLLING\n\nViolin\n\nUsing the Wilson V2 pickup for violin:\n\n\"I have enjoyed using the Wilson Pickup Systems on my violin for the past 15 years. The amplified sound is very close to my violin´s acoustic tone and without feeding back. Keep up the good work, Wilson!\"\n\nMads Tolling, US 2014\n\nJIMMI ROGER PEDERSEN\n\nDouble bass\n\nJRP using Wilson K4 pickup on his double bass. He studied double bass with Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen (NHØP) at Rhythmic Music Conservatory in Copenhagen, Denmark. For more than 15 years Jimmi toured with legendary jazz pianist Horace Parlan and backed artists such as Benny Bailey, Al Grey and Lee Konitz. He has 100+ records to his credit including two solo bass albums. Jimmi was nominated as best solo instrumentalist in The 2009 JPF Music Awards in Nashville, TN USA.\n\nJimmi Roger Pedersen, Denmark\n\nKIM SJØGREN\n\nby KIM SJØGREN\n\nViolin\n\nDuring the last many years I have been experimenting with a great many systems for amplification for violins, and to date, the Wilson Pickup System is the most perfect one I have come across. It is small, reliable and the system wich gets nearest to the natural sound of a violin. In short: I can warmly recommend the system to violinists with a need to amplifying their instrument. Kim Sjøgren, Violin - Denmark.\n\nHANS BACKENROTH\n\nby HANS BACKENROTH\n\nDouble bass\n\n\"Wilson pickup was a major revolution for bass players when it came on the market. I've been using it since 1988 and after 26 years it's still \"the pickup\" for me. It seems to work with every kind of amplifier (and bass) which makes touring so easy - I can put all my concentration on the music and always know that my instrument will sound true for all the listeners\".\n\nHans Backenroth, Sweden.\n\nDUDU LIMA\n\nby DUDU LIMA\n\nDouble bass\n\n\"Great sound... the first word that came into my mind when I think about Wilson Pick-ups!!!\n\nNo feed backs,natural big sound ,take the best from the instrument!!!I have used this system in the last 13 years...always great moments!!!In record sessions on studio,or live sessions the quality is amazing,great signal!!!On my solo carrear or playing with Stanley Jordan,Milton Nascimento and other great musicians always the best sound!!!\"\n\nDudu Lima, Brazil\n\nMORTEN RAMSBØL\n\nby MORTEN RAMSBØL\n\nDouble bass\n\nProfessor at University of Music and Performing Arts, Graz, Austria.\n\nGot my “old faithful” re-installed on my new bass.\n\nThank you, Ole Boje Wilson!\n\nThe Swiss Army knife of pick ups.\n\nMorten Ramsbøl, DK\n\nPhoto by: Una Stade\n\nCATYA MARÉ\n\nby CATYA MARÉ\n\nViolin\n\nA multiple award winning composer, music producer,\n\nclassical crossover violinist, visual artist and writer\n\nfrom Germany, now located in California.\n\n\"Wilson Pickups are the best in my opinion.\n\nI have used them on international stages for years.\n\nCatya Maré, www.catyamare.com\"\n\nARILD ANDERSEN\n\nby ARILD ANDERSEN\n\nDouble bass\n\nI have used the Wilson Pickup system for more than 20 years and still find it the absolute best on the market. It creates a warm and distinct sound with no feedback problems.The pickup reproduce exactly the sustain and punch you put into the instrument without having to deal with finger noise or an overly amplified attack which I find in a lot of the piezo pickups on the market. I always use a blend of Wilson and an acoustic microphone on all my recordings.Arild Andersen Norway Played with Jan Garbarek Sam Rivers Don Cherry John Abercrombie Bill Frisell Stan Getz John Scofield Pat Metheny Ralph Towner Paul Bley Gary Burton among others.\n\nSVEND ASMUSSEN\n\nby SVEND ASMUSSEN\n\nViolin\n\nI have great pleasure in giving my warmest recommendation to Wilson Pickup System. In my opinion it?s the most elegant solution of the problem natural electric amplification of the violin.Svend Asmussen\n\nAPRIL GUTHRIE\n\nby APRIL GUTHRIE\n\nCello\n\nI am finding the cello pickup lovely. I have only had one chance to use it in a bigger venue and the sound was good even with a short soundcheck. I find that just using it with my amp in smaller venues is great. The sound is very true to the instrument and easy to use for a quick pickup setup. I have already had many compliments on it....mostly that people don't realize that I am amplified until they see the amp on the floor which is wonderful.April Guthrie USA\n\nLINCOLN GOINES\n\nby LINCOLN GOINES\n\nDouble bass\n\nIn combination with a microphone or alone the K4 is the best pickup system I have used on my bass. Arco or pizzicato it produces a full natural and even sound from top to bottom with excellent dynamic range and volume capabilities.Lincoln Goines US\n\nMATHILDE BONDO\n\nby MATHILDE BONDO\n\nViolin\n\nUsing Wilson V2 pickup for violin\n\nINGEMAR IHLIS\n\nby INGEMAR IHLIS\n\nViolin\n\nFirst time I had the chance to play violin with a Wilson pickup was in a television comedy show.\n\nThe pickup was installed in an electric stock violin and the staff, the audience and I were very surprised with that great sound.\n\nI have been playing with the Wilson violin pickup in my cheap acoustic violin for many years, and the sound is very impressive. The sound is close to my expensive Italian violin and I am so pleased to play my violin amplified with this fantastic pickup.\n\nIngemar Ihlis, Sweden\n\nMICHAEL MALMGREN\n\nby MICHAEL MALMGREN\n\nDouble bass\n\n“Trying to sound as if rock & roll had never existed, Bo Kaspers Orkester managed to become one of the best-selling Swedish bands of the '90s.”\n\nBass player Michael Malmgren use the Wilson K4 pickup on his double bass.\n\nMichael Malmgren, Sweden\n\nDAVE ELLIS\n\nby DAVE ELLIS\n\nDouble bass\n\nI have been amplifying my double bass for over twenty years and in that time have used most if not all of the pickups available on the market. In my opinion the WILSON PICKUP is by far the fullest clearest and most natural sounding pickup of them all. Response is immediate and the instruments tone is accurately reproduced pizzicato and arco right through the entire dynamic range. Also very importantly the pickup does not mute tone as all of the other contact type pickups.My best wishes thanks and congratulations.Dave Ellis Australia\n\nTONY COE\n\nby TONY COE\n\nDouble bass\n\nI've been playing the double bass since 1960 and used them all but have never seen such attention to detail this pickup has. This individual pole design the Wilson employs seems unique and makes a great jazz bass sound Tony Coe/ The Jazz Shades - 2013.\n\nTIZIANO ZANOTTI\n\nby TIZIANO ZANOTTI\n\nDouble bass\n\nI have been using the Wilson K1 for many years with great satisfaction for both pizzicato and bow. In all my youtube videos and CDs I have used this pickup! Now I have upgraded to the K4 and I am even happier. More videos and recordings to come... Thanks a lot J?rgen and Ole! (T.

No more fear of live gigs werever they took place small clubs or large stages. The full warm and clear bass sound that was only in my dreams became a reality. No complicated gear to regulate impedances or EQ problems. Direct from the Wilson pick up to amp or mixing able and HELAS there it is. Since then i recomend it to any one who asks me about bass amlification. GO FOR IT !!!!Alberto Jorge. Portugal\n\nION ZACON\n\nby ION ZACON\n\nViolin\n\nDear Mr. Wilson During the last couple of days I have been testing the V2 Pickup in several acoustic systems different places and music studios. I can tell you that I have never heard something even appropriate to this clear natural and powerful sound! It is definitely the model that I have been looking for since it is unbelievable how it's equally reproducing the whole violin's spectrum starting from the G-string and finishing with the highest notes. Considering the fact that on my work on stage the music's volume is extremely high there are no feedback problems. Thank you once again for such a professional made pickup!\n\nIon Zacon Moldova.\n\nFRIDOLIN BERGER\n\nby FRIDOLIN BERGER\n\nDouble bass\n\nI've been using the Wilson pickup for many years it has always given me an excellent sound and has never let me down.\n\nDANIEL PEZZOTTI\n\nby DANIEL PEZZOTTI\n\nCello\n\nThe new Wilson Pickup System for Cello is a great innovation and wonderful offer to the cello players who want a natural amplified and well defined tone. All pizzocato effects have bass-like sound and many special arco effects appear very clearly.It is a pleasure to play with this Pickup-system in concerts because they are neither feedback nor crash like in other systems I tested.I can warmly recommend the Wilson Pickup System it is actually the best for violoncello on the market and can be used for any kind of musicDaniel Pezzotti\n\nTORGEIR BOLSTAD\n\nby TORGEIR BOLSTAD\n\nDouble bass\n\nAfter trying numerous different pickups that did not work the way i wanted I finally ended up with Wilson K4 and it blew me away. Plug it in - Flat EQ and that?s just about it. True-sounding reliability and no feedback whatsoever.\n\nTOM KENNEDY\n\nby TOM KENNEDY\n\nDouble bass\n\nHello I am writing to you upon my discovery of your webpage. I have used your Wilson K4 pickup on my basses for the last 20 years and believe that I can truly represent the quality and playability of your product even on my latest travel instrument the Eminence 4RN EUB. I get wonderful comments on the sound of my instrument constantly and always attribute it to your pickup system. From my vintage 200 year old bohemian instrument to my travel EUB you will always find a wilson pickup. Thanks for your time Tom Kennedy www.tomkennedymusic.com\n\nMICHAEL FRASER\n\nby MICHAEL FRASER\n\nViolin\n\nMy Wilson Pick Up helps me achieve the most natural sounding violin tone. Over the past 6 years it has wowed audiences with it's clarity and effectiveness. Having a good sound is an essential part of any performance. I'm looking forward to many more years of use. Thank you. Michael\n\nYASUHITO MORI\n\nby YASUHITO MORI\n\nWILSON Pick-up gives a natural acoustic bass-sound not only by pizzicato but even by arco. WILSON Pick-up gives the natural bow-sound. That is why I always use WILSON Pick-up.- Yasuhito Mori Sweden/Japan\n\nCARLOS D'l PUERTO\n\nThis pick-up system is really fantastic it reproduces a warm and distinct sound and has no feed back problems- Carlos d l Puerto Cuba/USA\n\nGEORGE MRAZ\n\nby GEORGE MRAZ\n\nThe WILSON Pick-up for double bass gives a very realistic reproduction of the acoustic sound and is simply the best I have ever used. The same has been said by the great sound engineers Rudy van Gelder and David Baker when they recorded me on several recent albums directly from the Pick-up. I highly recommend the WILSON Pick-up.- George Mraz USA\n\nPIERRE BOUSSAGUET\n\nby PIERRE BOUSSAGUET\n\nThe Wilson pickup-system is to me the best amplified bass sound I ever used or heard. This implicates that you can be sured to be heard in any musical situation and in any register.Using it has changed my playing totally: Because you can hear all of the sound up tothe end of the vibration you really work on each note and not only on the attack. That's changing your perception and control of each hand and the synchronization of them. This consciousness of the sound forces you to be much more responsible of each note you'ld play. Pierre Boussaguet. France 2013\n\nWAYNE DARLING\n\nby WAYNE DARLING\n\nThe WILSON Pick-up is great! It has that natural wood sound that I am looking for in amplified pizzicato and arco performances.- Wayne Darling Austria\n\nJEAN-PHILIPPE VIRET\n\nby JEAN-PHILIPPE VIRET\n\nI really love to play with your pickup system. Wherever I play jazz clubs TV studios concerts etc. I can find the sound I like to play with. Thanks to the WILSON?s pickup I dare at last to play with a bow at the stage with any amplification system. The sustain reproduction is really accurate not too long not too short and I like it very much.Jean-Philippe Viret. Paris\n\nMICHEL GAUDRY\n\nby MICHEL GAUDRY\n\nWILSON PICKUPFORMIDABLE !....M.Gaudry France\n\nJAY ANDERSON\n\nby JAY ANDERSON\n\nI just want you to know that I just got home from having David Gage install the pickup. He did a good job with the installation. When i got home I plugged the bass into my amplifier and it sounded grat immediately! I think your pickup will give me everything that wasn?t getting with other bass amplification systems.Sincerely Jay Anderson\n\nJENNIFER LEITHAM\n\nby JENNIFER LEITHAM\n\nI have been using a WILSON PICKUP since they first were available. I feel that it has the most natural sound of any pickup that I used. Its response is even in all registers and I never fail to get compliments on its quality from sound and recording engineers.When I switch from pizzicato to arco there is no dramatic increase in volume like there is with other pickups. The WILSON PICKUP makes my bass sound as though it were completely acoustic at all volume levels. Jennifer Jane Leitham, USA\n\nMARC JOHNSON\n\nby MARC JOHNSON\n\nWILSON PICKUP is very well suited for the type of music I play with that instrument. The sound is focused and gives me the puch that the bass has as well as the body and warmth. Plus the capacity for pure arco amplification is unsurpassed by anything I have yet seen or heard. I heartly recommend this pickup to any bass player who is serious about reproducing the sound of the instrument.All the best Marc Johnson\n\nKOOS SERIERSE\n\nby KOOS SERIERSE\n\nTo me the most important quality of the WILSON PICKUP SYSTEM is its natural and acoustic sound. It is also a very durable system and creates no distortion what so ever while in the midst of a T.V. or an otherwise complex recording situation. I have used the WILSON for many years now and I?m very happy with it.Sincerely Koos Serierse\n\nEBERHARD WEBER\n\nby EBERHARD WEBER\n\nI use the WILSON PICK UP on my electric fivestring bass together with a magnetic pick up. The result is extraordinarily good. It adds the necessary acoustic amount to my slightly electric sound. In addition - although my special bass has no resonance body - I can still use it occasionally as the only pick up especially when the circumstances like electric interferences do not allow to use a magnetic pick up system. I can highly recommend the WILSON Pick-up SYSTEM. I'm very satisfied.- Eberhard Weber France\n\nARNI EGILSSON\n\nby ARNI EGILSSON\n\nI have had a chance to try out your pickup for several weeks now and am very pleased to inform you that the WILSON PICKUP is the best pickup I have ever used. What I especially like is how even and how well it works for arco bass.Best regards Arni Egilsson\n\nHEIN VAN DE GEYN\n\nI would like to tell you how happy I am with your pickup. I have been using it for more years with satisfaction. The sound is very clear and clean. The way it picks up the bowing is extraordinary it is by far the best very well balanced with the pizzicato-sound.Hein van de Geyn\n\nJESPER LUNDGAARD\n\nby JESPER LUNDGAARD\n\nWorld famous jazz bassist, band leader and composer, using the K4 pickup for double bass since 1986\n\nDAN PLISKOW\n\nby DAN PLISKOW\n\nI've had a wilson on both of my basses for 20 years and love the natural sound of my basses that it reproduces.
