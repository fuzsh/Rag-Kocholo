Sunday the 10th of january 1965 Ben Webster came to Denmark for the first time. He played at the Radio Concert Hall with Kenny Drew (p), Alex Riel (dr) and Niels Henning Ørsted Pedersen (b). He was brought here by promoter Anders Stefansen and the producer was Børge Roger Henrichsen.

This concert became a prelude to a love affair, as Webster later returned to Denmark to spent the four last years of his life. This concert is the reason why we in the Ben Webster Foundation do what we do. The concert is available on CD Ben Webster’s First Concert in Denmark. Storyville 1018480.
