        "text": "Herman Bruce, a retired fisherman hailing from New Bedford, Massachusetts, holds a legacy of 55 years within the fishing industry. With ancestral roots tracing back to Newfoundland, Herman's family immigrated to the United States during the 1930s. Herman's father initially cast his nets in New London, CT, before eventually anchoring in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Herman's earliest memories are of the sea, as he began his journey assisting in the maintenance of his father's fishing vessel. From diligently painting pen boards to navigating the rhythm of sea life, Herman's passion for fishing was nurtured at a young age. As the years rolled on, Herman graduated from summers spent fishing to becoming a seasoned ground fisherman, marking his full-time entry into the industry during the early 1960s. For two decades, Herman carved a niche in ground fishing before making a strategic shift into scalloping. He owned a series of Eastern rig draggers and several scallop boats, including his current vessel that sails out of New Bedford.\n\nScope and Content Note\n\nHerman traces his family lineage to Newfoundland, highlighting their immigration story to the United States during the 1930s.
