        "text": "ARTIST'S STATEMENT\n\nIn response to a long and windy question by and enthusiastic interviewer about the psychological content in photographs, the great Mexican photographer Alvarez Bravo replied simply,\n\n“What is important is what was taken.”\n\nThe work you see here represents only a tiny fraction of my visual obsession with Mexico. In between assignments and commercial projects all over Mexico I have shot tens of thousands of photos. From white egrets on the lakes of Catamaco, to “Day of the Dead” candle light all night vigils in the cemeteries of Michoacan. Textures, colors, shapes and symbols... always trying to capture what I now realize is to me the unknown and unknowable soul of a deep Mexicanismo. The journey is richly rewarding though sometimes painful, doubtful as to whether I’ve gotten any closer to the goal. But what goal?\n\nAt some point in my career I learned to focus on the work and let the results take care of themselves. I found that for me “creativity would often happen during productivity” and so just get to work! Many of these images have stories and if you catch me in front of one of those I may burn your ear with the story. But what I really hope is that some of you viewers find in some of these images simply “what is important is what is taken.”\n\nGracias.\n\nBruce Herman is an internationally known photographer working and living in Los Cabos for the past 15 years. Bruce first came to Cabo as a young surfer in the 70’s, returning often over the years for both work and play. As a fashion photographer working out of Paris and Los Angeles he came many times ot produce catalogues and magazine spreads on Los Cabos beautiful beaches.\n\nIn the mid 90’s Bruce made the good decision to move here. He quickly became involved as a destination photographer in the growing Mexico tourism industry. His photos of Los Cabos and Mexico have appeared in travel magazines, guide books, and other publications through out the world. His work appears all over Los Cabos, promoting tourism, real estate and the time share industry. Three books of his work on Los Cabos have been published. Bruce has won the prestigious Lente de Plata (Silver Lens) award two times, once presented by former president Ernesto Zedillo and more recently by Vicente Fox for his contributions to Mexico tourism."
