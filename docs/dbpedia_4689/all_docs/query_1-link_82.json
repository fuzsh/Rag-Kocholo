        "text": "Post by gee on\n\nJust as we bemoan the total LACK of any action being taken re The Hollies back catalogue so Bear Family release a 66 track 2CD Anthology re the 50th Anniversary of their fellow Manchester sixties pop colleagues Hermans Hermits - with tracks appearing in true stereo for the first time - compiled by a certain Ron Furmanek !\n\nsurely such a project devoted to The Hollies,prelude to a proper long overdue sonic overhaul of The Hollies catalogue might be an idea too...??\n\nIF this 2CD set at least can be done for Herman...well surely a new Hollies such set is an idea ?\n\nmy copy arrived today - and while Ron has done a pretty thorough job of work on this project I must say that TWO notable track omissions rather surprised me\n\nfirst up HH final UK hit single 'Lady Barbara' (which reached No.13 in 1970, also No.7 in New Zealand) is absent from the set...which concludes with 'Bet Yer Life I Do' (that made no.22 in 1970, a hit only in the UK)\n\n- so missing out a BIGGER UK chart hit baffles me - while it's even included in the accompanying CD booklet discography\n\nthis is somewhat like me say compiling the DEFINITIVE Hollies Anthology....and omitting 'Gasoline Alley Bred' from it...!\n\nalso an annoying (to me) omission is Graham Gouldman's superb song 'It's Nice To Be Out In The Morning' - which was both in the film and on the soundtrack of 'Mrs Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter'\n\nthis GG gem 'namechecks' places and areas of his native Manchester...it's another of his 'observational' songs (as was 'Look Through Any Window' of course)\n\nGouldman even salutes Sir Matt Busby's famous Manchester United football team of that mid sixties era...and it's three most famous players - (Sir) Bobby Charlton, Georgie Best, and Denis Law (an Englishman, an Irishman, and a Scotsman - which sounds like the beginning of a joke...) - but was certainly NO joke for the opposing teams and the famous legendary trio are immortalised together in statues facing across to Sir Matt's statue at United's ground 'Old Trafford'\n\nGraham Gouldman's verse dedicated to them is:\n\n'United's ground where the Champions score a hundred goals and the Red stands roar...\n\nBobby Charlton, Best, and Law...\n\nit's a most fantastic day when they play...'\n\ncombined with a nifty guitar hook this 'flowing' song is a delightful piece of social comment re Manchester and the sixties times Gouldman knew so well..\n\nSurely this song, which exists in a true stereo version, was more worthy of inclusion than the weak comedy cover of the old George Formby 1930's era song; 'Leaning On A Lamp Post' which DOES appear on the 2CD set...\n\nFor strangely missing off those two stronger songs yet including a few lesser ones, I can't really call this a DEFINITIVE HH collection...but otherwise it is a pretty strong effort\n\nPost by gee on\n\n'Lady Barbara' reaching no.13 in the UK chart of course made it a bigger UK hit than either;\n\n'Gasoline Alley Bred', 'Hey Willy', 'Long Cool Woman', 'The Baby' and 'Curly Billy'(!) - so regardless of whether some deem it to be 'bloody awful' (maybe that's a bit harsh, while I am not that keen on it either it's not as bad as some hits I've heard) the fact is many UK singles purchasers obviously DID rate it\n\nwhile the fact that it was credited to 'Peter Noone & Hermits Hermits' - probably due to them knowing Peter was to go solo thereafter (tho' the rest of the group never split up then) - doesn't really matter either (the final single IS included on a few UK HH compilations) as 'Lady Barbara' was released on Mickie Most's RAK Records label for EMI so was readily available for inclusion...\n\nHH managed some 21 UK chart singles over 1964 to 1970 - only one less than The Beatles, Hollies, Dave Clark Five with 22 chart singles each...and of course enjoyed a few years of strong American chart success besides other countries notably Canada as Bee advises above...\n\nwe may dismiss them as merely a simplistic pop group but they did some deeper recordings too such as the class distinction of 'The Man With The Cigar', the social comment of 'Gaslight Street', plus covered songs by Ray Davies, Donovan and Bruce Woodley of The Seekers (whose song 'Rattler' was a gem both by HH and by The Seekers) and of course cut some great Graham Gouldman songs - he tailored songs for HH, and gave them a few more than he did to both The Hollies and The Yardbirds, so Gouldman certainly rated the group\n\nI have read that HH enjoying the brief 'Hermania' actually outsold The Beatles in the USA in 1966 (probably when Lennon's 'Bigger than Jesus' remark was going down like a lead balloon...)\n\nLike the DC5 after their USA heyday ended - when a number of music writers casually just dismiss HH as 'finished' - the actual UK chart details contradict that as they then scored more decent hit singles back home enjoying quite a strong run of Top Twenty UK hits over 1967 to 1970 with;\n\n'There's A Kind of Hush' (no.7), 'I Can Take Or Leave Your Loving' (no.11,) 'Sleepy Joe' (no.12),'Sunshine Girl' (no.8),'Something Is Happening' (no.6), 'My Sentimental Friend' (no.2), 'Years May Come, Years May Go' (no.7)....plus a few lesser chart singles in that period before 'Bet Yer Life I Do' and 'Lady Barbara' scoring a total of some eleven UK chart singles overall between 1967 and 1970\n\nso even if one might loathe the group the chart facts prove that many other people back then did NOT share that view...\n\nHH were essentially kept as a pop group overall of course, and some singles were stronger than others - their better singles and 'B' sides, album tracks were fine examples of sixties pop music\n\nFil of 'Wings of Pegasus' here does an interesting observation of Hermans Hermits proving they were playing live in 1966 - he notes how guitarist Derek Leckenby makes an error but then expertly covers it (!)\n\nFil also himself here makes a small error in that he does mix up lead guitarist Derek Leckenby and rhythm guitarist Keith Hopwood's names\n\n- note here the lead guitarist who was not a vocalist stands back from their front line as Karl Green on bass guitar and Keith Hopwood on rhythm guitar were the harmony and backing vocalists"
