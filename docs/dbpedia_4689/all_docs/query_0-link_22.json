        "text": "Bruce G. Herman, a nationally recognized expert on worker training who fought to preserve New York City’s garment district and to revive manufacturing across the country, died on Feb. 7 in Manhattan. He was 54.\n\nThe cause was pancreatic cancer, his wife, Jennifer, said.\n\nMr. Herman, a Brooklyn resident, devoted himself to saving and creating manufacturing jobs, whether as president of the Garment Industry Development Corporation, a labor-management partnership, or as New York State’s deputy labor commissioner. Because of his expertise on work-force matters, he often testified before Congressional and state legislative committees.\n\n“When a lot of the intellectual elite was writing off manufacturing, Bruce championed manufacturing,” said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project. “He doubled down on it and was committed to rebuilding a vibrant manufacturing sector.”\n\nAfter the World Trade Center was destroyed, in 2001, he devoted himself to helping the families of the 79 workers at Windows on the World, the restaurant atop one of the towers, who were killed, and to finding jobs for the 350 Windows workers who survived.\n\nBruce Gregory Herman was born on March 23, 1957, in Lancaster, Pa., the son of Samuel and Arlene Herman. After graduating from Penn Manor High School, in Millersville, Pa., he attended Dickinson College, where he received a bachelor’s degree in political science. He obtained a master’s degree in political science at Columbia University.\n\nHe married Jennifer Kleinberg in 1998, and is survived by her; their three sons, Luke, Taylor and Carter; his parents; two brothers, Michael and Steven; and two sisters, Sandra Herman and Christine Fisher.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1998, Mr. Herman was president of the Garment Industry Development Corporation.\n\n“He really turned it into a major force,” said Bruce Raynor, former president of Unite Here, the apparel-workers’ union. “He showed that there was a real role for start-up apparel companies. In this industry, a start-up company can, two years later, become a major player.”"
