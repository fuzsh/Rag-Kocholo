        "text": "His listeners knew Dave Herman’s voice — but perhaps they didn’t really know him.\n\nThe legendary New York-area radio DJ’s arrest this week in a child sex-crime case has taken area residents aback, including Allan Sniffen of Bedford Hills, the moderator of the online New York Radio Message Board site, where Herman weighed in with comments as recently as this month.\n\n“You never felt Dave Herman was putting on an act when he was on the air,” Sniffen said. “You always thought that he was sincere.\n\n“He seemed like a straight-forward, decent, on-air kind of guy,” Sniffen added. “It shocks me.”\n\nOn Thursday, Sniffen and everyone else who had listened to Herman talk and spin records on WNEW-FM and other New York radio stations over the years learned Herman, 77, had been arrested at an airport in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Prosecutors said Herman had arranged for a woman he knew as “Kris” and her 7-year-old daughter, known as “Lexi,” to meet him so he could have sex with the girl at his vacation home there.\n\n“Kris” was actually an investigator with the Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office, who had first communicated with Herman in an online chat room in late November 2012, according to a criminal complaint by Special Agent Mark Lubischer of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHerman, who was on the air for much of the last 40 years, has a home in St. Croix and ties to Rockland County.\n\nHerman’s latest post on Sniffen’s message board was on Oct. 9, when he weighed in on a discussion about a pair of WNEW DJs of the past, writing, “I still can’t get used to the fact that Pete (Fornatale) and Rosko (William Roscoe) are both gone.”\n\nThat comment came just nine days after he allegedly contacted the undercover investigator to make travel arrangements for his would-be victim.\n\nHerman was known as an exceptional rock music DJ who presented himself as warm, funny and relaxed on air, said Alec Cumming, a co-author of the book, “New York City Radio,” which traces the history of the city’s radio industry. Cumming said he spoke to Herman once or twice while working on the book.\n\n“He was especially strong as the morning guy for WNEW-FM, combining great rock cuts amidst traffic, sports and weather,” Cumming said. “People of my generation — I’m 52 — will remember Dave quite well, and I’m sure we’re all shocked and heartbroken at the news. If Dave did what he did, he should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. But the Dave Herman I remember was a great guy — a welcoming, New York-savvy voice for a very intimate and important medium.”\n\nRichard Neer, a sportscaster who worked with Herman for 25 years, including at WNEW, said he and other former colleagues were flabbergasted at the allegations because “it’s out of the realm of the guy we knew.” Several others of Herman’s on-air colleagues from what is considered the golden era of FM radio remained mum on his arrest Friday, declining to comment when contacted.\n\nHerman’s former listeners turned to Facebook, Twitter and other online outlets to voice their surprise and disgust.\n\n“This is shocking,” Joanne Malandrino-Daly, of Mahopac, wrote on lohud.com. “Always wondered what had become of Dave Herman but never, ever, expected something like this. Back in the day he was one of the best DJs at NEW with daily dose of Bruce Juice, etc.” (a reference to Herman regularly playing Bruce Springsteen in the morning).\n\nHerman presented himself as a hip, laid-back and upbeat person who was easy to talk to, said Scott Humphrey, 37, of Highland. Humphrey said his ex-girlfriend had been good friends with Herman and the former DJ stayed at the couple’s house for several days on one occasion a few years ago.\n\n“He’s the coolest grandfather,” Humphrey said. “He walks around with his baseball cap, smoking his Marlboro lights with a nice hop in his step.”\n\nAssemblywoman Amy Paulin, D-Scarsdale, who has passed legislation to strengthen penalties for human trafficking, said she can remember hearing Herman’s voice on the radio growing up in Brooklyn.\n\n“It’s very disturbing. Unfortunately it’s not uncommon,” she said of the charges in the case. “We hear about these predators being out there all the time.”\n\nKiera Pollock of the Center for Safety and Change in New City said her organization counsels parents to monitor their children’s online activity and to teach children to be cautious about sharing information and photos.\n\nThe complaint alleges Herman, having found his victim, had clear ideas about what he wanted to do with her.\n\n“Age 6 is the perfect time to start her being loved that way,” Herman allegedly wrote, adding “I find girls that age incredibly sexy, soft, and their innocence is also a huge turn on for me.”\n\nHe was charged with one count of attempting to transport a minor in interstate commerce with the intent that the minor engage in illegal sexual activity. He faces at least 10 years and up to life in prison and a maximum $250,000 fine if convicted.\n\nAt a court appearance Friday in District Court of the Virgin Islands, Herman was ordered detained until his transfer to New Jersey. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Newark said Herman would be held in Puerto Rico, likely for a couple of weeks.\n\nLast month, Herman spoke to the investigator and asked for names and dates of birth for “Kris” and “Lexi” so that he could buy airline tickets for them to meet him in St. Croix. He bought the tickets on Sept. 30, according to the complaint, and in subsequent conversations with “Kris” even asked if he would need to get a car seat for when the girl was in St. Croix.\n\nStaff writer Hoa Nguyen contributed to this report."
