        "text": "Eleanor Herman is the New York Times bestselling author of Sex with Kings and Sex with the Queen, non-fiction works on the love lives of European royals through the centuries; Mistress of the Vatican, the biography of a woman who ran the Catholic Church in the 17th century for her reputed lover, Pope Innocent; and King Peggy, the true story of a Washington, DC secretary who became a king of Ghana.\n\nIn 2015 her first YA novel came out, Legacy of Kings, first of the four-book Blood of Gods and Royals series, on the adventures of Alexander the Great at sixteen. It has been optioned by the WB network for a TV series. She has appeared on the National Geographic Channel, The History Channel, and the American Heroes Channel to comment about historical matters.\n\nEleanor is so immersed in the past she is sometimes surprised to find herself in the present. She lives in McLean, VA with her husband, four rescue cats, and a dog, and sneaks out to the movies periodically, not to see the movie, but actually to eat the hot buttered popcorn.\n\nRelated Videos"
