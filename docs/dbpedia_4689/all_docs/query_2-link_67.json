        "text": "Union Grove – Herman Walter Emer, Sr. passed away at his residence on Tuesday, October 11, 2022.\n\nHerman was born in Milwaukee to the late Andrew and Emily (nee: Krebs) Emer. He faithfully served our country with the United States Army from 1963 through 1966. Herman was united in marriage with Rosemary Conigliaro on November 1, 1975. Herman spent many years working as a foreman at Greene Manufacturing. He loved working on cars, keeping them running smoothly and even taking on the task of rebuilding them. He had a passion for using his extensive inventory of tools, which allowed him to fix virtually anything that was not working. Herman enjoyed traveling in his RV and on occasion found time to visit a casino when time allowed. He was always punctual, rather being early than late. The most important thing to Herman was his family. He instilled the importance of family watching out for each other and taking care of each other. Herman was always willing to help, no matter what was asked of him.\n\nSurviving are his children; Earl (Mitsuko) Brinkman from Japan, Carol (Rick) Baynes from Arizona, Frank (Stacy) Brinkman from College Grove, TN, Herman Jr. (Rachel) Emer from Pleasant Prairie, Marguerite (Ron) MacDonald from Franklin, WI; grandchildren; Ashley (Danny) Farkas, Brittny (Justin) Zlotek, Steven Baynes; Kelli (Matt) Wolff, Michael, Kirsten and Mitchell Brinkman; Rebecca (Purna) Prakash, Amelia, Autumn and Sullivan Emer; Brett (Tina) MacDonald, Alex (Kristy) MacDonald, Corey (fiancé Maygan Neisius) MacDonald; great-grandchildren; Reagan and Brody Farkas; Zander and Warrick Zlotek; Rowan Wolff; and Lucca MacDonald; sisters, Jeannie and Audrey Emer, brothers George (Cindy) Emer and Andrew Emer, Jr; and special friend, Renate Rivera. Herman was preceded in death by his wife, Rosemary; his parents, Andrew and Emily; sister, Janice and brother, Anthony Emer.\n\nVisitation for Herman will be held at Draeger-Langendorf Funeral Home on Tuesday, October 18, 2022 beginning at 9:00AM. A service of remembrance will begin around 10:30AM. Full military honors for Herman will be at 11:00AM. His committal service will follow at 1:00PM at Holy Cross Cemetery, 7301 West Nash Street, Milwaukee, WI 53216. Family and friends will meet at the front entrance."
