        "text": "After 93 years, Marian Jane Herman was called home by our loving God. We know Pops waited for her at the pearly gates to welcome her to Heaven. Born on July 7, 1930, to Michael and Mary Unger, who preceded her in death, she was also preceded in death by her brothers, William Unger, Robert Unger, and a sister, Theresa Kovach. On October 2, 1954, Marian married Stanley Edward Herman, who passed away in 2016 after 62 years of marriage. Marian and Stanley were loving parents to ten children, with a daughter, Marie, who passed away after birth. Surviving to honor Mom’s loving memory are Katherine (Joseph) Wisniewski; William (Cheryl) Herman; Edward (Patti) Herman; Rose Runnels ; Mary Dibble; Patricia (Sam) Fuller; Margaret Herman; Joseph (Nancy) Herman; and Karen (Jim) Lawrence. Two sisters, Joan Seach and Helen Arend and a number of nieces and nephews survive to cherish her memory.\n\n17 grandchildren and eight great grandchildren survive, as well. A grandson, Michael Wisniewski, passed away in 2009.\n\nMarian was the constant anchor for her family, and any time you asked what makes her the happiest, she would say her family. She repeatedly told her children , “My kids, grandkids and great grandkids are everything to me.” She did not just say this; she lived it. For birthdays, she would let us choose what kind of cake and meal we wanted, letting us be “king’ or “queen” for the day. She enjoyed putting others in the limelight, but was humble, never wanting to be the center of attention. She will be affectionately remembered as “Mama Bear.” Her sense of humor was constant with her three sons, playing her pranks on April Fool’s Day, or making up a story when she did not have much to say. She provided advice to her daughters from cooking to relationships and was the biggest cheerleader for all nine children! She often said, “If you mess with my kids, you mess with me!” She even donned a football helmet and tennis racket to protect her family against a bird that got into the basement. Her faith carried her through many tough times in life. She was known throughout several Catholic parishes, including Saint Joseph (Mishawaka) and Saint John the Baptist (South Bend) especially for her active involvement in making rosaries and teaching others. Her love and kindness towards others left an indelible mark.\n\nMom had a love for flowers and plants. Flowers always bloomed for her even when others could not get them to grow. This gift was apparent in her gorgeous rose bushes, daisies, mums, daffodils, lilies of the valley and more! Mama Bear was known for her amazing kiflis and taught her daughters and granddaughters her secrets to deliciousness by supervising this lengthy 2-day process! Mom was never too busy to lend a helping hand; give support; laugh or cry with her children and grandchildren, and give her motherly strength by saying, “You are a Herman. You can do or be anything!” Mom loved to watch sports, and often joked how her wedding vows were to “love, honor, and obey the Cubs’ schedule.” Mom enjoyed watching Notre Dame football and was an avid Purdue fan in support of her sons’ alma mater.\n\nMama Bear taught us all that there might not be a lot of money, with nine children, but there was never a shortage of love! Mom was a jack of all trades, or a Marian-Jane of all trades, to be more accurate! She made matching Christmas skirts for all six daughters when her girls were growing up. She would often climb a ladder and shake the pears from her dad’s pear tree, while the kids put them in baskets for their Grandpaw. She was not one to give up. Some called it stubborn. We called it determination. Huge on family traditions, she would make bacon, eggs, and toast at 1:30 a.m. after midnight Mass for Christmas. Then, she would have to wrap Christmas gifts for nine children, sometimes forgetting which gift was intended for which child. If the wrong name were on, the girls would just swap. Her homemade milkshakes were a favorite of all her children, as was her popcorn and pies. A highlight over the last few months was experiencing her first slumber party with her six daughters. Calling her boys to find out what time and channel Purdue played was a regularity, as was breakfast at The Curve with two sons and birthday lunches at Red Lobster with her third son.\n\nAs an attentive Grandma/Great Grandma, she was the best! Her chocolate chip cookies were a favorite “staple” when grandkids came home from college. She adoringly watched the grandkids when they were younger, creating an extra special bond. She was the “hub” for family communication, with grandkids following in their parents’ footsteps to tell Grandma first. Mom, just know you will always be our hub—gone from this earth, but never forgotten as our angel. Pleasant dreams, Mom. Rest in peace now.\n\nVisitation will be on Tuesday, May 21st, from 3-7 PM at Palmer Funeral Home- Bubb Chapel, 3910 N. Main Street in Mishawaka, where the rosary will be said at 5:30 PM. The funeral Mass will be held at Saint Joseph Catholic Church, Mishawaka at 11 AM on Wednesday, May 22nd.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made in loving memory of Marian Herman to Sisters of the Holy Cross or Mishawaka Catholic School."
