        "text": "3.1K\n\nVeteran DJ Bruce “Cousin Brucie” Morrow had been planning to present a free June 8 concert at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel with Herman’s Hermits (starring Peter Noone), Tommy Roe and The Soundtrack of Our Lives. But the show has been postponed because of dangerous air conditions due to the Canadian wildfires.\n\nMorrow has posted on Facebook: “URGENT BULLETIN !! THE PNC SHOW FOR 6/8/23 HAS BEEN CANCELLED-Due to the Smoke Situation. Please call any of your friends who were coming to the Show. It will be Rescheduled. We are all disappointed, however, it’s truly safer for all of us.”\n\n(JUNE 10 UPDATE: The new date has been announced. It is July 13, with Jay Siegel’s Tokens and The Soundtrack of Our lives opening.)\n\nThe information also may be posted on the website of the Garden State Arts Foundation, which is presenting the concert.\n\nThe forecast is for air conditions in New Jersey to remain dangerous on June 8 before improving on June 9 and 10."
