        "text": "biography\n\nBorn Harold Herman Brix in Tacoma, Washington, on May 19, 1906, actor Bruce Bennett was born into a wealthy family. He first found fame at the 1928 Olympic games under his real name. He broke the world record for the shot-put on his first toss and won a silver medal in Amsterdam. His world record was short-lived, as a teammate broke his record minutes later. Prior to winning the silver, Bennett had been a track and football star at the University of Washington. He completed his college education after his success at the 1928 Olympic games, working a series of odd jobs until heading to Hollywood in 1930 upon meeting silent film star Douglas Fairbanks, who encouraged the young man to try his hand at acting. He toiled mostly in bit parts for the next few years and initially lost the role of Tarzan to Johnny Weissmuller after a shoulder injury.\n\nThrowing the shot-put at the 1928 Olympic games\n\nBy 1934, Edgar Rice Burroughs had become dissatisfied with the portrayal of his Tarzan character in films; whereas Burroughs' Tarzan was erudite, thoughtful, and a well-spoken member of the landed gentry, film Tarzans up to that point spoke in monosyllabic utterances (if at all) and were basically human forms of the beasts that roamed the jungle. However, Burroughs had leased the rights to the character to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and had little control over the portrayal of the king of the jungle in MGM's wildly successful Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films. Burroughs decided to film his own Tarzan movie and selected Herman Brix for his 1935 feature The New Adventures of Tarzan, produced by Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises, Inc. and released as both a 12-chapter serial (265 minutes total) and a full-length 75-minute feature. Burroughs shifted the action of the film from the African jungles to Guatemala, and it was filmed in extremely primitive conditions in Guatemala. Although Brix is good in the role, most American audiences didn't have a chance to see the film. At the time, MGM had stronghold on the American film industry and managed to block widespread distribution of the film. However, Burroughs had more success in Europe and Asia, where the film proved to be very popular.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Herman Brix decided to shed his identity as a former athlete and former Tarzan, changing his name to Bruce Bennett. He signed with Columbia Studios in the late 1930s, initially appearing in small roles and uncredited parts in comedy films like Blondie Brings Up Baby (1939), The Spook Speaks (1940), and the Three Stooges short No Census, No Feeling (1940). His career quickly gained momentum, and soon Bennett was starring in a variety of film genres, including westerns and war films. Of all Tarzan actors, Bennett had by far the longest and most versatile acting career. Bennett's career benefited from a move up to Warner Bros. where he starred in the drama Mildred Pierce (1945; with Joan Crawford, Ann Blyth, and Eve Arden), portraying Mildred's weary husband. He went on to star in the dramas A Stolen Life (1946; with Bette Davis, Glenn Ford, and Dane Clark) and Nora Prentiss (1947; with Ann Sheridan and Rosemary DeCamp), but perhaps his best film is the adventure The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948; with Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston, and Tim Holt).\n\nthe films of bruce bennett\n\nThe New Adventures of Tarzan (1935)\n\nScenes from the 1935 serial The New Adventures of Tarzan\n\nHawk of the Wilderness (1938)\n\nBennett stars as Kioga in the twelve-chapter Republic serial Hawk of the Wilderness\n\nThe Lone Ranger (1938)\n\nWith Lee Powell in the Republic serial The Lone Ranger\n\nHonolulu Lu (1941)\n\nWith Lupe Velez and Forrest Tucker in the Columbia comedy Honolulu Lu\n\nSahara (1943)\n\nBennett as Waco Hoyt in the Columbia war picture Sahara\n\nCheyenne (1947)\n\nBennett as outlaw Ed Landers in the Warner Bros. western Cheyenne\n\nSmart Girls Don't Talk (1948)\n\nFrom the Warner Bros. crime drama Smart Girls Don't Talk with Virginia Mayo\n\nThe Second Face (1950)\n\nWith Ella Raines and John Sutton in the drama The Second Face\n\nCalvary Charge (1951)\n\nWith Ronald Reagan in the Paramount western Cavalry Charge\n\nThe Big Tip Off (1955)\n\nFrom the Allied Artists film noir thriller The Big Tip Off with Richard Conte\n\nDaniel Boone, Trail Blazer (1956)\n\nBennett as the title character in Republic's Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer\n\nFlaming Frontier (1958)\n\nFrom the 20th Century Fox B western Flaming Frontier with Shane Rimmer\n\nThe Cosmic Man (1959)\n\nFrom the Allied Artists science fiction release The Cosmic Man.

Nonetheless, he acted in films and television on occasion. In 1961, he wrote and starred in the campy low-budget flick The Fiend of Dope Island. In addition he occasionally accepted roles in TV productions; he was frequently seen on Perry Mason, among other shows. His last film was the low-budget science fiction flick The Clones (1974; with Gregory Sierra and Alex Nicol), after which Bennett retired from acting. In his later years, he made frequent appearances at autograph conventions. Sadly, Bruce Bennett passed away on February 24, 2007, after breaking a hip. He was survived by a daughter, a son, and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Bennett's wife Jeanette, whom he married in 1933, passed away in June 2000."
