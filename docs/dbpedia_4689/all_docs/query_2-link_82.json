He was 100.\n\nBrix, who later adopted the stage name Bruce Bennett and appeared as Joan Crawford’s husband in “Mildred Pierce” and as an ill-fated gold prospector in “The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,” died of complications of a broken hip Saturday at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center, his son, Christopher, said Tuesday.\n\nA former University of Washington football and track-and-field star who played in the 1926 Rose Bowl, Brix moved to Los Angeles in 1929 after being invited to compete for the Los Angeles Athletic Club.\n\nHe became friends with actor Douglas Fairbanks, who arranged a screen test for the handsome young athlete at Paramount. While playing a small role as a running back in the 1931 Paramount college football movie “Touchdown,” Brix broke his shoulder.\n\nThe injury caused the world-record-setting shot-putter to fail to qualify for the 1932 Olympic trials. It also ended his chance to play Tarzan at MGM, where he is said to have been the studio’s leading candidate for the role.\n\nTwo years later, Brix got his chance to play the jungle hero in “The New Adventures of Tarzan,” produced by an independent film company whose principals included Tarzan author Edgar Rice Burroughs.\n\nOver the next several years, Brix appeared in more than a dozen films, including the serials “Shadow Over Chinatown,” “The Fighting Devil Dogs,” “Hawk of the Wilderness” and “The Lone Ranger.”\n\nAfter making yet another serial, “Daredevils of the Red Circle” in 1939, he realized he had to do something to break being typecast in action roles.\n\nAs Bruce Bennett, he began carving out a new career as an actor, initially under contract at Columbia Pictures and then at Warner Bros. Among his many credits during this period are “The Officer and the Lady,” “Atlantic Convoy,” “Sahara” and “Dark Passage.”\n\nWalker Edmiston, voice of Keebler elf\n\nWalker Edmiston, an actor who was the voice of many cartoon and puppet characters, including Ernie the Keebler elf in TV commercials, has died. He was 81.\n\nEdmiston died of complications from cancer Feb. 15 at his home in Woodland Hills, said his daughter, Erin Edmiston. He worked until becoming ill in January, she said.\n\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s, Edmiston had a children’s show on local television, “The Walker Edmiston Show,” which featured his own puppets, including Kingsley the Lion and Ravenswood the Buzzard.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, he voiced many characters on shows created by Sid and Marty Krofft, including Dr. Blinkey and Orson the Vulture on “H.R. Pufnstuf” and Sparky the Firefly on “Bugaloos.”\n\nEdmiston also had acting roles in episodes of such TV series as “Gunsmoke,” “Mission: Impossible” and “The Dukes of Hazzard” and performed for nearly 20 years on “Adventures in Odyssey,” a radio series produced by the nonprofit group Focus on the Family.\n\nHal Rothman, Vegas history expert\n\nHal Rothman, a writer, professor and expert on all things Las Vegas, died Sunday after a yearlong battle with Lou Gehrig’s disease. He was 48.\n\nRothman died Sunday night of complications related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, his wife, Lauralee Rothman, said.\n\nRothman hosted a radio show, wrote a column in the Las Vegas Sun and wrote several books. He began teaching history at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in 1992, when the Las Vegas Strip was leading southern Nevada into a decade-long economic boom. He focused on the city’s reinvention and growth in his 2002 book, “Neon Metropolis: How Las Vegas Started the Twenty-first Century.”\n\nHis analysis made him the media’s choice for thoughtful perspective on the city. He was quoted in or appeared on almost every national news outlet, including the New York Times, Newsweek magazine, “ABC World News Tonight,” the Wall Street Journal, the “CBS Evening News,” CNN and National Public Radio.\n\nThis report includes information from the Los Angeles Times and the Associated Press.\n\nOriginally Published: February 28, 2007 at 11:01 p.m."
