        "text": "[This story contains spoilers from season 12, episode nine of Curb Your Enthusiasm, “Ken/Kendra.”]\n\nLife imitated art again with the latest Curb Your Enthusiasm. Or, if you ask show boss Jeff Schaffer, “life imitated silly art.”\n\nThe silly art he is referring to is when Curb‘s Larry David (played by the real Larry David) gave Bruce Springsteen COVID-19, forcing him to cancel his music tour. Springsteen had made a brief cameo earlier in the season in the “Lawn Jockey” episode, where the Boss praised Larry for becoming a liberal hero after he (unknowingly) stood up against a Georgia 2021 voting law that makes it illegal to provide food or water to voters in line at the polls.\n\n“That’s Larry David’s middle name: Larry ‘Involvement’ David,” said Springsteen on CNN when making his first Curb cameo.\n\nNow, in the ninth episode of season 12 — the penultimate episode before the Emmy-winning HBO comedy’s series finale this weekend — Springsteen returns. In the show, the Boss is so impressed with Larry’s political stance that he wants to meet the Seinfeld creator in real life.\n\nBut when they sit down at a table together in the home of the Greenes (Susie Essman and Jeff Garlin), several things go awry. First, Springsteen’s manager Ken (played by trans comedian Ian Harvie) identifies himself as being formerly Kendra Morris and recalls how they used to have sex (and always on the floor). This prompts one of the episode’s best lines when Springsteen is aghast at Larry being a “floor fucker,” and Schaffer says that line was all the Boss.\n\n“Bruce telling Larry, ‘I never took you for a floor fucker,’ is one of my favorite moments ever — like, in life,” recalls Schaffer when speaking to The Hollywood Reporter about the episode. “We knew we were going to be talking about floor fucking, but that was all Bruce. That was Bruce chiming in, which was amazing. We were like, ‘What! He’s so funny.'”\n\nSchaffer adds, “If the music thing doesn’t work out, he definitely has a future in comedy.”\n\nThe uncomfortable exchange ends up cutting Larry’s meet-and-greet with the Boss short, but not before a mix-up over their water glasses. The next day, Larry comes down with COVID, and he soon hears on the TV that Springsteen is also sick with COVID, is blaming Larry David for giving it to him and has to cancel several shows on his current tour. Today anchors Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb deliver the news that Springsteen’s health is in danger, and now the world is very mad at Larry David.\n\nThis, of course, will not bode well for Larry’s reputation for his upcoming trial, where he faces up to one year in prison and a fine of $10,000 for obstructing the election process in the state of Georgia. He also was threatened in this episode with being “Me Too-ed” after he offended his masseuse.\n\nThe COVID Curb plotline was written in 2022, and they filmed the scene with Springsteen in one day in December 2022, on the improv comedy’s final day of shooting that year. “It was a long time to keep that one secret,” says Schaffer.\n\nThen, flash-forward to February 2023, when Schaffer and David were editing the season, and Springsteen in real life ended up postponing three of his shows in one week “due to illness.” Then, in April 2023, Springsteen and wife Patti Scialfa came down with COVID. And in August 2023, the Boss ended up postponing more shows after having “taken ill.” In September, it was then revealed he had been diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease, and he ended up canceling all remaining 2023 dates so he could recover.\n\n“Bruce got sick and had to cancel his tour, and I just turned to Larry and said, ‘You have an amazing ability to manifest negative things. You are the supreme negative manifester,'” Schaffer recalls. “I remember going, ‘Oh my God, it’s exactly what we did.’ In the show, we say he had complications so his health was really at risk. It played out just like we said — which I feel terrible about! The good news is he got better, and he was hilarious. Happy ending.”\n\nSchaffer says when they initially reached out to Springsteen’s manager, they never thought the guest role would materialize. But quickly after the pitch, the Boss said yes; he was a fan of the show. After they wrapped, they sent Springsteen his scenes, because the Curb team was so happy with the final result.\n\n“He loved them, which was great. He was putting a lot of faith in us,” says Schaffer. “He’d seen the show, but a lot of people haven’t worked the way we do, where it’s not all scripted. Lots of things get said. And we kept telling him, ‘We’ll use the best stuff,’ so he could try everything. And he played around. He knew the basic beats, but he was in there adding and slugging around. We showed him the scenes because we were so happy with how they turned out.”\n\nThe plot around how Larry likes to have sex ends up circling around when his ex-wife Cheryl (played by Cheryl Hines) calls him out for lying to her about why he wanted to have sex on the floor. (“It’s hot, like in the movies,” she says he told her.)\n\n“Larry being a floor fucker because he wants to avoid depressing post-coital conversation was a story from one of our consulting producers that we thought was really funny. Ian Harvie had been on our radar for a while, and we knew he was the right person for this part. He was perfect,” says Schaffer. “Then as we were writing, it became clear that the reason the restaurant they ate at ended up getting a C rating had to be because a waiter was fucking on the floor. It’s perfect that after hearing how vile a human being is for not wanting to have any emotional attachment to anyone you’ve just had sex with, Larry’s response is not that he’ll change his ways but that he’d love to meet this guy. ‘We have something in common.’ So, I don’t think Larry has learned his lesson.”\n\nSchaffer still marvels that they got Springsteen to do such a big role and coyly teases that the Boss might make some sort of return in next week’s finale.\n\n“Everyone was so excited that Bruce had that brief cameo in episode two, and Larry and I were sitting there thinking, ‘If you guys only knew that he’s doing all these scenes in show nine.’ We were able to shoot a lot of stuff with Bruce in the one day we had him.”\n\nHe adds, “Things come back to haunt Larry every week. His life is a comedy haunted mansion, everything boomerangs.”\n\nBelow, with only one episode remaining before Curb signs off for good (maybe, hopefully not), Schaffer takes THR through some more highlights from the penultimate episode in season 12, “Ken/Kendra.”"
