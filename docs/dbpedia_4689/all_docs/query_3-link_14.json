        "text": "An Artist's Look at Theology, Art, and Philosophy\n\nDear Tom,\n\nThanks for writing again—and for this unusually philosophical response to my letter! In response: my theology of art is my theology. Period. I think of God as the Artist and all human artists as eternal apprentices. Consequently, all my thinking about God involves the centrality of beauty and the act of making. As I’ve said many times, we were made by a Maker to be makers. . . .\n\nBruce\n\nIn a series of fictional letters, respected artist and educator Bruce Herman passes on wisdom to a younger generation. He explores a wide array of practical, philosophical, and theological issues, such as:\n\nWhat is art versus craft? What is good art?\n\nWhat is the calling of an artist? Of a Christian artist?\n\nWhat do you do when you're stuck in your creative process?\n\nHow should Christians relate to the contemporary art scene?\n\nWhat is beauty, and how is it relevant in our world?\n\nFull of personal stories and behind-the-scene looks at Herman’s own artistic process, Makers by Nature also features full-color artwork by Herman and several of his former students. Artists and art lovers will find insight, wonder, and encouragement to consider the Maker’s invitation to creativity, however it takes shape."
