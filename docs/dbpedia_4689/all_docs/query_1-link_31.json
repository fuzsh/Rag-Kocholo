        "meta_description": "Vespers - light into Light by Jeff Johnson with Janet Chvatal, released 12 April 2005\n\n1. Vespers (light into Light)\n2. Christ Before Me\n3. Prayer Of St. Francis\n4. Wait For The Lord\n5. Deep Within\n6. Agnus Dei\n7. Magnificat\n8. Teach Me Thy Way, O Lord\n9. Blessed Is The Man (Alleluia)\n10. Grant Us Your Peace, O Lord\n\nInspired by the traditional evensong service, here is a richly textured musical meditation featuring the collaboration between keyboardist and vocalist, Jeff Johnson and classical singer, Janet Chvatal. Instrumental and vocal compositions segue with Taizé and Latin chants in this ancient - future, contemporary Celtic-tinged soundtrack.\r\n\r\nFeaturing –\r\nJeff Johnson: Keyboards, percussion &amp; vocals\r\nJanet Chvatal: Vocals &amp; chants\r\nBrian Dunning: Flute &amp; whistles\r\nJohn Fitzpatrick: Violin\r\nJozef Lupták: Cello\r\nTim Ellis: Electric Guitar\r\nPhil Baker: Electric Bass\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction –\r\nIt will become quite clear from the opening piece that this recording does not intend to follow the traditional Vespers liturgy. Yet, the practice of marking the end of each day with the recitation of Psalms, music and prayer is one that all Christians can appreciate.\r\n\r\nVespers has always been associated with light. The name comes from a word for &#39;evening star&#39; and for many years it was celebrated at the hour of sunset. Eventually, it was established at the twelfth hour (6:00 pm) of the offices of the day and the practice of lighting torches and candles became a powerful metaphor for what David once described:\r\n\r\nIf I say, &quot;Surely the darkness will overwhelm me,\r\nAnd the light around me will be night,&quot;\r\nEven the darkness is not dark to You,\r\nAnd the night is as bright as the day.\r\nDarkness and light are alike to You.\r\n- Psalm 139:11-12(NAS)\r\n\r\nSo, while this is not a traditional Vespers liturgy, the collection of compositions here celebrates this &quot;light into Light.&quot; As you listen, my hope is that the music will inspire you to a greater belief in God&#39;s faithfulness to all who have placed their hope and trust in His great mercy.\r\n– Jeff Johnson\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic Reviews –\r\n\r\nThis time Johnson manages a coup with the vocal accompaniment of the great Janet Chvatal. And this album isn&#39;t all languid and quiet, either - the title track employs percussion and understated electronica along with familiar flutes, whistles, fiddles, and Johnson&#39;s trusty keyboard. Thoughtful - not unlike contemplative worship.\r\n– Dave Urbanski/YouthWorker Journal",
