        "text": "Family was the most important element in Herm Hendricks' life. He was a loving husband and father who emphasized the importance of education and religious faith. He regarded his children as his greatest achievement, and he was the happiest when he was in their warm company.\n\nWith a victorious end to the Great War, thousands of young soldiers returned home to their civilian lives. Amid the growing demands of a peacetime nation, the economy flourished and national industry burgeoned. In this time of growth and prosperity, John Hendricks and his wife Josephine Durham discovered another reason to celebrate. They were expecting a child. On May 1, 1926 at home in Muskegon Hgts. they were blessed with the healthy birth of their son Herman.\n\nThe eldest of eight children, Herm grew up in Muskegon Heights with the company of his many brothers and sisters. Even as a youngster, family was at the center of Herm's life. He was very close with his siblings, and he was deeply affected by the loss of his sister Donna, who died from rheumatic fever when she was only four years old. Herm was raised in a structured, organized home. His father provided for the family through his job on a manufacturing line, and his mother stayed at home to raise the children.\n\nHerm grew up in a traditional environment where his Dutch heritage played an important role. He and his family were charter members of Grace Christian Reformed Church in Muskegon, and their faith was a part of everyday life. Herm attended Christian schools where he received the academic and religious education that would guide him throughout his life. He made many friends among his classmates, especially on the baseball team. Though Herm enjoyed all sports, his build was too slight for football or soccer. His love for baseball continued into his adult years, when he would cheer for the Tigers and regularly take his family to games.\n\nLike most American families, the Hendricks struggled during the Great Depression. In order to help his family, Herm began working at the local Kroger Food Store as a teenager. At the age of seventeen he dropped out of school to join the Navy, and he served during the Second World War. His tour of duty included the Asiatic Pacific Theatre and the Philippines.\n\nAfter earning his honorable discharge, Herm returned to Michigan and settled into his civilian life. In 1950 he was introduced to an attractive young woman name Frances Ruth DeWitt. She was serving in the Navy as a certified nurse, and Herm was working in sales for a tobacco/candy company. They quickly fell in love, and after a romantic courtship they were married on February 17, 1951 in Waukegan, Illinois.\n\nThe young newlyweds settled in Montague, Michigan where they would live for one year before relocating to Muskegon Heights. They were blessed with two wonderful children. Susan was born in 1951, followed by Bruce in 1958. Herm was a kind, loving father who always kept his children in the center of his heart. Although he never graduated high school, he was a lifelong learner and thoroughly self-educated. Through his own example, he showed his children the value of knowledge and education. He encouraged his kids to work hard in school, and he proudly watched them proceed from high school all the way to graduate school. Susan became an obstetrician and Bruce did his graduate work in law and business.\n\nShortly after moving to Muskegon, Herm changed careers and began working for Teledyne Continental Company where he was a contractor for the military. Throughout his career, he sought to better himself by taking several college courses. He was a valuable employee, and he retired with the title of Supervisor. Herm was also involved in several organizations, including the VFW, Kiwanis, and Elks. He was a past president of the National Management Association, where he also served for many years on the Executive Board.\n\nIn 1960 Herm and his family moved to Norton Shores where they settled into the home at 5156 Hillview Drive. This was where Susan and Bruce spent most of their childhoods, and it would remain the family home until Herm and Fran sold it to their son Bruce and his family.\n\nWith retirement Herm discovered more time to spend with his family. He and Fran moved to Indian Creek in Florida. Herm devoted himself to his hobbies. He spent countless hours playing bridge with his friends. He was an avid reader whose favorite books included World War II nonfiction, mysteries, and biographies. He loved to sing, and his voice was beautiful. He participated in the church choir, but he sounded the best when he was singing a solo. He could do more than just carry a tune. His voice resembled Bing Crosby, and his style recalled the Big Band music of his youth. He was also a gifted whistler. Herm maintained his love for sports, and as he grew older he continually refined his golf game. He played this sport throughout his life, and he was quite talented. He was a part of the Churchill Athletic Association. When he could no longer play he gave his clubs to his grandson Chris.\n\nHerm and Fran were true companions. They were both early risers, often getting out of bed before daybreak. Although Herm woke early, he was a very heavy sleeper. His daughter remembers the time when she waited for him to pick her up. He didn't arrive, and finally she found a ride home. When she reached her front door, she knocked and knocked and knocked, knocked for several minutes until finally rousing Herm from his slumber.\n\nIn 1987 Herm and Fran purchased a home in Fort Meyers Beach, Florida where they spent their winters. They liked Florida so much that they decided to live in the Sunshine State permanently. These were some of their happiest years, filled with togetherness and reminiscing. After more than fifty wonderful years, their marriage ended on March 31, 2003 when Fran passed away. Herm was devastated by this loss, but his faith and the support of his family helped to guide him through his grief. Following Fran's death, he moved in with his daughter Susan who helped to care for him. His health gradually declined, and eventually he required full time attention. He moved into Rose Arbor Hospice, where he died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nHerm devoted his life to his family, and in the company of his beloved wife, children, and grandkids, a familiar smile always brimmed over his lips. His kindness and gentle ways earned him a place in the hearts of many. Among the many people who loved him, he will be greatly missed and frequently remembered.\n\nHerm died on August 21, 2006 at Rose Arbor Hospice Residence in Kalamazoo, MI. Herm was preceded in death by his wife Frances in 2003. Also preceding him in death were: 3 sisters: Donna Hendricks, Colleen Stafford, and Karen Hendricks. He is survived by 2 children: Susan Kay Hendricks, MD of Kalamazoo, MI, Bruce (Lana) Hendricks of Muskegon, MI: 2 grandchildren: Nicholas and Christopher Hendricks of Muskegon, 3 sisters: Jane Braddy of Newaygo, MI; Kay (Clinton) Heil of Muskegon,: Marlene McPherson of South Bend, IN; 1 brother, Eugene Hendricks of Muskegon; 1 brother- and sister-in-law, Herbert and Edith Anderson of Cable Lake, MI; 1 sister-in-law, Doris DeWitt of Stevensville, MI and many nieces and nephews. Cremation services provided by the Life Story Funeral Home, Betzler-Kalamazoo. A service to honor Herm's life will be held Saturday, August 26, 2006, 12 noon in Grace Christian Reformed Church, 2500 East Laketon Avenue, Muskegon. Food and fellowship will follow at the church. Private interment will take place at Sunrise Memorial Gardens next to his beloved wife, Fran. Memorial contribution may be made to Rose Arbor Hospice, 5473 Croyden, Kalamazoo, MI 49006.
