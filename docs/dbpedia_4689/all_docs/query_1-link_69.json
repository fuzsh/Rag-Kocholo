        "text": "Hal Bruce is a veteran, full time entertainer from Nova Scotia, Canada, and got his musical start the night The Beatles took the world by storm on the Ed Sullivan Show back in February 1964. Ever since then, he has not looked back. He knows every Beatles song ever recorded, and can play any one of them upon request, all in the original keys and each one with the vocal styling of the originals. His uncanny ability to sound like John, Paul or George is something not too many people have been able to achieve and has been hailed as quite arguably the “Best Solo Beatles Artist” in the world!\n\nHe has been inducted to 3 Halls Of Fame, one in Liverpool, one in Louisville, and the third (just as this programme is being read by you), in the Nova Scotia Music Hall Of Fame.\n\nHal has performed on the same bill as: Jefferson Airplane, Peter Noone (of Herman’s Hermits), Spencer Davis Group, Joey Molland of Badfinger, Searchers, Gerry Marsden of The Pacemakers, Beach Boys, Stampeders, Blood Sweat and Tears, Turtles, Mickey Dolenz of The Monkees, Grass Roots, Guess Who, and Denny Doherty of The Mamas and The Papas. Also, recently, he was chosen out of over 65 bands, to open for Peter Asher for two-Sold Out Concerts in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nHe has played in many concert settings where the 1960s greats performed in places like: The Cavern Club, Empire Theatre and Philharmonic Hall in Liverpool, England, Australia’s Centennial Hall, The Cavern Club in Adelaide and in different countries like Argentina, Sweden, France, Belgium, Hungary, Holland, Luxembourg, USA, The Caribbean, The Mediterranean, and of course Canada.\n\nHal’s “One man…One guitar…Big sound!” approach to his performances has netted many return visits to various venues around the world, both large and small alike. He performs the classics from the last 60 years of Pop, Rock and Roll, and Country and folk, to venues like Festivals, Corporate, Private, Theatres, Special Features, etc.\n\nIn 2004, Hal set a world-record by playing all 214 released Beatles songs in a non-stop medley in front of an audience of over 5,000 people in Cleveland, Ohio…and since then, he has recreated the feat in places like Louisville, Kentucky in 2005, Liverpool, England in 2006, Halifax, Nova Scotia in 2010 and in Washington, DC in 2010, and back in Louisville just this past May.\n\nCome out this week and see Hal do his thing, as he celebrates his 16th visit to Liverpool’s Beatles festivities… You’re witnessing one guitar and one voice, but you are hearing so much more, and all without computer trickery or sampling."
