        "text": "A Los Angeles native, Allisyn Snyder launched her career in the entertainment industry at 4 years old (as Allisyn Arm). Allisyn worked steadily, with TV appearances including Friends, Strong Medicine, Judging Amy, and Still Standing. At the age of 11, she landed a series regular position in Disney Channel's Sonny With A Chance, followed by its spin off, So Random!, a children's live audience sketch comedy show that utilized her catalog of many character voices and physical comedy skills. Allisyn has become iconic as the mousy oddball Heather Wilmore in all four seasons of NBC's A.P. Bio opposite Glenn Howerton and Patton Oswalt, with Decider saying, \"Allisyn Ashley Arm Is TV's Greatest Scene Stealer... (her) 'words said to laughs earned' ratio is absurd. A.P. Bio has the best young cast on TV, but no character on this or any other series produces more humor with fewer lines than Jack's devious, peculiar protege Heather.\" At 15, her steady childhood acting career morphed into a passion for working behind the camera, setting her foundation with cinematography studies at Glendale CC after graduating at 15. At 17, Allisyn began writing sketches for AwesomenessTV, with several airing on Nickelodeon. At 18, Allisyn created YouTube personality Astrid Clover, assisted by Joey Luthman and Allisyn's now-husband Dylan Snyder, together releasing a new episode every Friday for 7 years while gaining a loyal following over 350 original episodes. In 2016, Allisyn began writing and producing films alongside Dylan Snyder, forming Watch The Footage Productions. Her directorial debut, the queer screen-life horror film Howdy, Neighbor! had its Los Angeles premiere at the historic TCL Chinese Theatre as a part of Screamfest 2023. Growing up with an active lifestyle, Allisyn has been trained in trapeze, aerial silks, dance, kickboxing, and roller derby. She is a certified Advanced Open Water (AOW) scuba diver and Nitrox diver with a lifetime of swimming lessons and ocean experience. She is also a prolific artist, with her dark and whimsical creations invited to gallery showings since she was 15 years old."
