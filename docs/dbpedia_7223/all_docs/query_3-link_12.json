        "text": "Allisyn Ashley Arm landed her big break when she was cast on the Disney series \"Sonny with a Chance\" (Disney, 2009-2011), but many fans knew her even better from her successful career on YouTube. Born in Glendale, California in 1996, Arm began showing a major interest in performing practically from birth. She signed with a talent agency at age four, and soon booked her first commercial jobs. Arm made her TV debut in 2002 on an episode of \"Strong Medicine\" (Lifetime, 2000-06), and quickly landed more guest starring roles on other shows like \"Friends\" (NBC, 1994-2004) and \"Judging Amy\" (CBS, 1999-2005). Arm also landed roles in feature films including the Michael Douglas dramedy \"King of California\" (2007), and explored voice acting on the animated series \"Dive Olly Dive!\" (Voom, 2005-06). After co-starring on \"Sonny with a Chance\" as Zora, Arm continued the role on the spin-off \"So Random!\" (Disney, 2011-12). She launched her YouTube channel in 2014 playing a character she wrote for herself called Astrid Clover. The character became a huge success, raising Arm's profile considerably. In 2018, she joined the cast of the comedy series \"A.P. Bio\" (NBC, 2018-) as shy but quirky high school student Heather."
