        "text": "Julien Smith · CEO of Practice, Author\n\nThese days my routine starts at 8:00am. I begin almost every day with some basic data checking about my business and 1000 words of freehand writing, which I have been doing as long as I can possibly remember. I got it from Julia Cameron’s The Artist’s Way, and have been sticking with it since my early 20s.\n\nDepending on whether I’m deliberately dieting or not, I’m likely more often than not to be fasting until noon or longer. During this time I drink 3 cups of black coffee which I make with a Chemex from 8:00am til noon. It keeps me focused on work things for the most part, and the calm routine of making coffee by hand is something that follows me wherever I happen to be.\n\nJohn Zeratsky · Author, Designer\n\nMost mornings, I wake up around 6:30am—a little earlier in the summer, a little later in the winter (I live in Wisconsin, where the sun rises at 5:00am in June and at 7:00am in December).\n\nI sit up in bed and grab my glasses and watch from the nightstand. I have a sip of water, say good morning to my wife, Michelle, and then walk into the kitchen. I start coffee and feed the cats. One cat eats faster than the other, so I have to monitor them during breakfast. By the time they are done, the coffee is ready, so I pour myself a cup and go look out the window for a minute.\n\nSo far, about twenty minutes into my day, I haven’t looked at a phone, computer, or other screen. We charge our devices inside a cabinet in the dining room, so they are out of sight and mostly out of mind. The physical barrier forces a deliberate decision about when to take that first look, and I’ve configured my devices to make them as distraction-free as possible. Normally I’ll check my phone first, turning on the screen without unlocking it to see if I missed an important text or call overnight. Then I’ll grab my computer and sit down at the dining room table with my coffee.\n\nI like to start my day with a meaningful chunk of work. It might be writing an article or working on a presentation. It could be some design work or web development for Make Time or one of my other projects. Occasionally, it’s not on the computer but maybe a project around the apartment or even some reading. This is my daily “Highlight” that I describe in Make Time.\n\nI view the first few hours of the day as “free,” unclaimed time. If I don’t use it deliberately, I’ll squander it on email or Twitter or the news or some other mindless timesuck that doesn’t make me feel good. Plus, I’ve learned that my focus is better in the morning than it is later in the day; I want to make good use of that time.\n\nAfter an hour or two, I eat breakfast, drink a second cup of coffee, jump in the shower, and get dressed—not always in that order. By 10:00am I’m ready to head to the office, continue working at home, or have a meeting—although I normally save meetings for the afternoon.\n\nExciting news, our book is available! Order online or purchase from your local bookstore today Exciting news, our book is available! Order online or purchase from your local bookstore today.\n\nKate Nafisi · Designer, Finisher\n\nI have a couple of rituals I like to do rather than a strict routine. When I do my rituals four out of seven days a week, I feel more balanced and energized.\n\nIn a few bullet points:\n\n6:00am:\n\nWake up to my phone alarm\n\nFumble in the dark to put on my blue-and-white cotton dressing gown (a grid-patterned kimono my father bought me in Japan). I also fumble around in the pitch black for my handmade felted woolen eco slippers, discarded somewhere by the bed the night before. With one eye open, I walk slowly down the wooden stairs my husband made, descending from our mezzanine/mattress/bedroom into our kitchenette.\n\nDrink lemon water\n\nDo my matcha tea ritual\n\nDo my gratitude ritual\n\nMeditate with chanting\n\n7:00am:\n\nPut on a record\n\nHave breakfast with my husband (Abi)\n\nCheck email and messages\n\n8:00am:\n\nDrink a fruit smoothie\n\nHead to the woodworking workshop\n\nWilf Richards · Coop Co-Founder\n\nI have an alarm set for 7:00am, but I normally wake up before that and listen to some Radio 4 comedy in bed. In truth, the 7:00am alarm is really my “start meditation” alarm, which I do in bed.\n\nI’ll ideally then get up at 7:30am, weigh myself, drink a glass of water, and use an app to do some stretches. If I feel like it I’ll then do a workout too. Then it’s on to breakfast and decaf coffee. I really like to watch a TED talk or do a puzzle or crossword during this time. Then work starts at 9:00am, which either involves staying in if it’s an admin day, or getting out on the smallholding for outdoor tasks.\n\nJosh Gross · Founding Partner at Planetary\n\nDoes “get smacked in the face repeatedly by the dog until I get out of bed” qualify as a complete morning routine? No? Well, in that case…\n\nI wake up at approximately 7:00am every morning. I try to be as consistent as possible with this because it helps set the pace for the rest of the day. Once I’m up, the first thing I do is put on the kettle and prep my coffee—I use a French press because I really enjoy the zen-ness of the process. My personal favorite is the GROSCHE Madrid French Press. Easy to wash and high quality.\n\nOnce the kettle is on, I feed the dog (Lady) and then check my email, take a shower, and pull up the news (typically Curbed, Reddit, and Google News). I take note of any emails that need an urgent response, but I don’t respond until after at least the first sip of coffee; mornings are “my time” and I try to keep it that way.\n\nThe last thing I do before starting work for the day is take the dog out for a walk, if my partner hasn’t. Then I’m out the door! …Or at my desk, if I’m working from home. (As part of a distributed team, I keep an office but don’t always go in.)\n\nMelissa Clark · New York Times Food Writer\n\nThe phone alarm goes off at 6:16am; I meant to set it for 6:15 but am too lazy to adjust it, and it really doesn’t matter. Bach cello suites to quietly lull me out of bed. The goal is to not wake my husband, who sleeps for another half hour. I keep quiet in the bathroom, too, trying not to clang around with my toothbrush and neti pot and nail brush and all the other morning ablutions. Then I throw on leggings and a sweatshirt, the mom uniform of Park Slope. It takes me fifteen minutes to get downstairs. Then I’ve got thirty minutes to myself before I have to wake up the kid (Dahlia, who’s ten) at 7:00am.\n\nI drink a full twelve-ounce glass of water, spiked with lemon. The rule is that I can’t have tea until I drink up the water, and since I really want tea, I do it. Then I have tea, well-steeped Assam with whole milk.\n\nI have twenty-five minutes left for early morning emails and planning my day. What do I need to get done? I make a mental list and organize myself, checking the calendar, checking my list of due dates for recipes I’m working on. Do I have enough orzo for the pasta salad I need to make today, or should I stop at the store on the way home from walking the kid to school?\n\nThen there is yoga. Every morning I think about doing twenty minutes of restorative yoga from Glo before I wake the kid. I’ve done that exactly three times in the last year. But maybe today will be the day I make it four times!\n\nAt 7:00am I wake the kid and empty the dishwasher while making her a smoothie (I slip in an egg white if there’s one left over in the fridge or add yogurt). Then she gets buttered whole grain toast and honey. While she eats breakfast I make her lunch—she just started eating sandwiches, thank the sandwich gods. In years past, I’d poach a chicken breast some mornings because she’s spoiled and I’m a food writer, so it’s actually no big deal for me to poach a little chicken breast and there’s always fresh thyme in the fridge. But I’m glad those days are over. Sometimes she just gets a container of salami, plus fruit and cut up cucumbers. Depends on how tired I am.\n\nAt about 7:15am my husband comes downstairs, and he makes me more tea while I make him a jammy egg with soft butter and salt and pepper, and toast cut thickly and spread with so much butter it leaks out the other side. It’s nice to do these things for each other; it makes us both feel taken care of.\n\nTwo and a half days a week (Tuesday, Thursday, and every other Friday) I walk the kiddo 1.2 miles to school and back. On those days we rush out the door (homework, lunch, knitting for her elective all in the bookbag—check, check, check). We are out the door by 8:07am to get her there by 8:22 or 8:23, depending on how many dogs we stop to talk to. School starts at 8:25am and she hates being late. I could use some of that.\n\nThen I walk home, arriving by 8:40am or so. Then I sit down at my computer and get to work.\n\nAt this point, I have not eaten anything yet. I don’t get hungry until around 10:00-11:00am, and my rule is don’t eat if you’re not hungry. Unless there are cookies.\n\nPaul Murphy · Third Grade Teacher\n\nI teach in an elementary school where the students don’t arrive until 8:30am, so I take advantage of the relatively late start to steal some extra sleep. I like sleep. I like it better than toast, and toast ain’t bad.\n\nMy phone’s alarm is set for 7:00am. Once it goes off, I hit the snooze, which buys me five more minutes. Then I hit the snooze again for another five minutes. I almost always hit it a third time because I like things in threes.\n\nThen I get up and limp to the bathroom because I’m old, and there’s just about always some lower body part that aches. I pee. After that, I head to the kitchen. My daughter, who’s twelve, is usually perched at the kitchen table eating a Pop Tart. I grunt a good morning. She grunts one back. Then I make her lunch. It is invariably a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on white bread (because we’re old school) and a bag of Cheez-Its (because she loves edible squares). I amble into our garage (which is the worst part of my morning during winter) and pull a Capri Sun out of the beer fridge. Then I put those three items in her lunch box.\n\nAt this point, I have a decision to make: I can either crawl back into bed and delay adulting for fifteen more minutes by playing on my phone, or I can get in the shower and start my day. Depending on what I need to do at work, I make that choice. At some point, I run across my wife, who is also getting ready to teach. We say pleasant things, give each other a kiss, and she takes my daughter to school. Eventually, I end up in the shower. As soon as that’s done, it’s off to work. I have a six-minute commute, eight if there’s a tractor up ahead. I show up at school sometime between 7:45am and 8:15am, depending on whether I snuck back under the covers after making the PB&J. I eat nothing. Once I get to work, I usually fill my insulated tumbler for the morning and start in on my to-do list, so I’m prepared when the students arrive.\n\nDenise Lee · Founder of Alala\n\nI’m naturally a night owl; however, after running my own business for the last six years, I’ve forced myself to be more of a morning person because I find mornings to be the most productive time of the day.\n\nI wake up around 6:00-6:30am (before the alarm rings, most days) because my dog starts moving around in bed. After getting up, I take him out for a quick walk and then head to my workout. After getting my endorphins high, another thing I try to do every day is come up with one good idea in the shower; usually it hits me without my having to think too hard, and it’s honestly my favorite thing about the morning. I wrap up my morning with a smoothie and vitamins, then head into work.\n\nAmy Nelson · CEO of The Riveter\n\nIt’s not easy to get a head start on the day when you’re competing with three small children. For me, this means 5:00am wake-up calls.\n\nFirst item on the agenda is time for myself, which typically looks like running for 20-30 minutes on the treadmill in our garage and scrolling through news briefings (I’m loyal to the BroadSheet, Katie Couric’s Wake-Up Call, and theSkimm). The quiet quickly fades by 6:00am, and the house comes to life with the buzz of my girls (ages four, three, and one), our rescue dog, and the amazing team that makes all the pieces of our puzzle work (my husband, my mother, and my nanny, if she’s arrived).\n\nAfter stumbling toward a cup of coffee, I head to the kitchen to prepare a very basic breakfast for everyone. (It’s definitely more on the bowl-of-cereal- or yogurt-cup-side of things; we aren’t winning any gourmet chef awards in my house!) It can be hard to align schedules in the evening, so we’ve swapped the dinner routine for some quality family time to start the day, and we sit down for “family breakfast” around the table.\n\nAs soon as everyone is on their way to preschool or morning activities, I drive to The Riveter’s HQ in southern Seattle. My commute varies from day to day, but this is generally a time to take phone calls, wrangle childcare, schedule personal appointments, and mentally review the day ahead. I also call my dad in Ohio, whom I miss and am constantly trying to convince to move to Seattle. It’s also time to brainstorm and find some “blue sky” (as blue as Seattle will allow) to reflect on larger priorities and goals for my company, and myself!\n\nRick Smith · Founder and CEO, Axon\n\nI wake up at 6:00am, weigh myself, and take an EKG on my Apple Watch. I have occasional cardiac arrhythmias, so it’s good to check every morning. I also check my sleep hours using an Oura Smart Ring. (I set a goal of sleeping for seven and a half hours every night.)\n\nThen I brush my teeth and chug a good, eighteen-ounce cup of water. After that, I hit the gym downstairs in my basement, then grab a quick breakfast with my kids and drive them to school. By 8:00am, I’m at Axon headquarters, where I head to the locker rooms to grab a quick shower before starting work. When I’m not in the office, I’m in my home office settling in.\n\nGeorge Foreman III · Retired Professional Boxer\n\n5:30am: Check emails, texts, and social media for any emergencies.\n\n6:00am: Drink coffee and have a bowl of oatmeal.\n\n7:00-7:30am: Respond to time-sensitive emails.\n\n7:30-11:00am: Higher-order work (the most important things that require strategic thinking).\n\n11:00am onwards: Communications and “busy” work. I am constantly on the road—walking real estate, doing interviews, attending speaking engagements, inspecting our locations, etc. My office is wherever my laptop is. I try to spend one day in the office a week whenever I can.\n\nCarly Stein · Founder of Beekeeper’s Naturals\n\nI wake up at 7:00am. The first thing I do upon waking is five minutes of gratitude journaling using the Five Minute Journal. It’s beautifully designed with a few simple, targeted prompts for each morning and evening. I really love that it gets me in the habit of being more thoughtful about my days.\n\nFor my other journaling, I use a basic composition book—nothing fancy. I go through so many journals, I like to keep things simple.\n\nNext, I practice around ten minutes of meditation, sometimes a little more.\n\nBecause my days are so unpredictable, I make sure to fit in a workout early on. I’ll take a spoonful of B.Powered Superfood Honey for a little energy boost and head off to a workout. That might be SoulCycle, Barry’s Bootcamp, yoga, or a chill run on the beach. When I get home, I’ll get ready for work and make breakfast—usually a smoothie. While I’m drinking, I’ll do three morning pages of free writing (I’m working my way through The Artist’s Way) which clears my slate and gets me ready to tackle the day.\n\nShirley Meerson · Wellness Coach\n\nI wake up naturally between 7:00-7:30am. My morning routine consists of doing five things in five minutes. These are simple steps designed so that I run my day, and the day doesn’t run me.\n\n1) Prayer: I start my day with love, appreciation, kindness, and gratitude. I say a prayer while I’m still in bed. I switch it up when I feel like it—the prayer can be spiritual or religious, or it can be an affirmation or goal.\n\n2) Light: I get myself over to a window and open the curtains to let the light in. This shuts down the sleep hormone, melatonin, in my body, which allows the body’s natural circadian rhythm to know that I’m now awake.\n\n3) Breathe: I now do some deep breathing from my diaphragm. After three rounds of conscious slow breathing, my body feels superb.\n\n4) Hydrate: Next I drink water at room temperature because my body is dehydrated from the long night of sleep. This water helps to flush out toxins, fire up my metabolism, and give fuel to my brain.\n\n5) Self-affirmation: As I pass a mirror on the way to the bathroom, I stop and give myself some love. I greet myself as I’d greet someone I care about, am happy to see, and love dearly. Positivity rules! I just speak directly to myself in the mirror and say: “Good morning, have a wonderful day, you’re beautiful.” Or I just wave and smile.\n\nIt takes me about five minutes to complete these simple steps to start my day with love and appreciation. For the most part, I’m not hung up about the order of these five hacks. Upon completion I begin my pattern of making coffee or tea, meditating, qigong, reading, and stretching.\n\nHayley Leibson · Serial Entrepreneur\n\nI wake up at 6:30am. From bed, I hold my iPhone close to my face because I’m nearsighted, and I check for updates first on Slack, then email, Facebook Messenger, and the weather. I respond to anything urgent right away. I then wash my face, brush my teeth, and put in my contact lenses whilst listening to The Wall Street Journal Tech News Briefing podcast, and NPR on Spotify through my Google Home.\n\nI use all cruelty-free vegan and environmentally friendly makeup and skincare products made by at least one woman founder. I love Tarte Cosmetics for makeup (found at Sephora and online), and I have been a huge supporter of the skincare company Alaffia (found at Whole Foods and online) for 12 years. Alaffia’s product sales help conduct empowerment projects in West Africa, including maternal care, bicycles for education, school supplies, and school construction. My favorite Alaffia product is their handcrafted Fermented Coconut Oil made at their co-op in Togo, West Africa. I use it every day after a shower, and it leaves my skin incredibly soft and smooth. The final step of my skincare routine involves MyChelle’s Sun Shield Tinted Liquid SPF 50 sunscreen. It’s by far the best sunscreen for the face I’ve found to date. It smells good, applies beautifully, and doesn’t leave your skin feeling oily.\n\nAfter doing my makeup and hair, I make my bed, pack a gym bag, and grab my yoga mat, reusable water bottle, Warby Parker sunglasses, Thistle for lunch, and Guayaki Yerba Mate Raspberry tea, and I walk to CorePower Yoga for either a 7:00 or 7:30am class. Thistle is a plant-based meal subscriptions service. I’ve been subscribing to Thistle’s vegan salads for weekday lunches for the past six months and have noticed my skin has become clearer and I have more energy throughout the day. Before Thistle, I had a really tough time getting enough vegetables in my diet and would spend too much time and money finding lunch during the workday.\n\nAfter yoga, I shower and change clothes, and pick up MUSH Vanilla Bean overnight oats (also a female founded company) for breakfast. I then listen to a Simple Habit meditation on my walk to work feeling energized, happy, and full of gratitude.\n\nSarah Morgan · Digital Strategist\n\nI wake up around 6:30am to my one-year-old puppy licking my hand, jumping on and off the bed, and playing with anything he shouldn’t to get my attention and get me up. I grab whatever clothes are nearby, wrangle a leash on him, and head out for a walk.\n\nOnce we’re back, we both get breakfast and, since it’s still too early for me to properly function, I spend thirty minutes to an hour watching TV, listening to a podcast, or reading. I know a lot of people opt for working out, journaling, or meditating, but my goal is simply to start my day in a positive mindset and feeling energized. Sometimes an episode of The Real Housewives is all I need to get in a good mood. Once I feel alive and ready to rock, I jump into my most important task of the day.\n\nTina McCorkindale · President/CEO, Institute for PR\n\nI wake up between 5:00-5:15am every morning. I immediately grab my phone and read the news/check social media for 15-30 minutes. Even though I work from home, I put on yoga pants, a hoodie, and I brush my hair. While I’m on the West Coast, I work with people on the East Coast, so I often have early-morning calls.\n\nSince I prepare my coffee machine (with ten cups of decaf coffee) the night before, it starts brewing at 5:00am. I pour my coffee in an obscenely large travel mug (twenty-four ounces) and a coffee carafe, so I don’t have to keep refilling after each cup. I let Waffles the dog outside and get to work.\n\nSam Crawford · Blogger, The Man Blueprint\n\nI wake up anywhere between 5:00-7:00am. I have all the good intentions of getting up at 5:00am (and have written about this extensively), but sometimes, mostly during the winter, I find it hard to stick to the routine.\n\nFor this reason, I usually push my alarm back to 7:00am, which is early enough for me to get everything I need done but late enough that I feel like I’ve had a nice sleep in.\n\nI’ll then down a pint of water. If you’re not getting that top-notch H2O in you from the off, you’re not doing it right. A big glass of cold water straight after getting up will wake you up quicker than anything else.\n\nI then do an in-bed stretching routine I found on The Art of Manliness a few years ago. After that, I bend down to touch my toes for five deep breaths and then reach up to the ceiling for another five breaths. I follow that up with twenty resistance band shoulder dislocations. These sound painful but they’re really not. They’re such a great tool for keeping your shoulders healthy. I’ve been working out for about seven years now and haven’t had a single shoulder injury since I started doing them.\n\nI then do the Wim Hof Method. It’s all about breathing (can you see a theme throughout my mornings yet?) and can help with immunity, fitness, anxiety, and a whole host of other modern-day ailments, apparently.\n\nAfter that, I get dressed and head out for a forty-five-minute walk with a weighted vest on (I’ll skip this if I’m short on time). Weighted vests are a great way to make your walk an even more effective cardio workout without your even noticing. Because the weight is pretty evenly distributed, you barely notice a difference in difficulty while getting the added bonus over your standard walks. It can weigh up to 30kg (~66lbs), but I usually go with 10kg (~22lbs) so I’m not nearly dying halfway through.\n\nAlso, getting dressed signals that I need to stop being a big layabout and triggers me to take action. The simple act of getting out of my cute little jim jams makes me want to kickstart the day with a bang, which helps me to take action a lot easier.\n\nWhen I return home, I inhale some essential oils diluted in a bowl of boiling water. This is like my own personal face sauna. I put a few drops of peppermint oil in a bowl, pour a load of boiling water into it, and cover my head and the bowl with a towel. Then I take about twenty deep breaths and get the good stuff flowing through my sinuses. I feel like this really wakes me up and relaxes me at the same time. It’s novel and I like it.\n\nI then take an ice bath. This clears the cobwebs off just in case everything else fails. I try to do about fifty deep breaths while in there, which helps me to not freak out at the cold. The rush I feel when I get out is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.\n\nJean Chatzky · Financial Editor, The Today Show\n\nI get up between 5:00-7:00am, depending upon whether I’m working early on television or have a deadline. When I have a deadline, I find that the early-morning hours (before emails start to roll in) are my most effective writing hours.\n\nWhen I’m in the process of writing a book, the 5:00am wake-up time can go on for months. It’s something I learned from my mother, who received her master’s degree in educational psychology when my brothers and I were in grade and middle school. She would get her work done before anyone in the house was awake. So, I get up. I let the dog out, make the coffee, let the dog back in, feed him, and then sit down at my computer and type. After two hours, I try to exercise, which usually means heading out for a run or hopping on my Peloton.\n\nGideon Akande · Celebrity Fitness Trainer\n\nEvery morning, my alarm goes off between 4:30 and 5:00am. I wake up early because I see my first client at 5:45am. I need this time to get myself alert and active, and I have to factor in my commute.\n\nI check my phone for any important communications that may alter the course of my day and plan accordingly. I then proceed to shower and dress with minimal distraction (avoiding social media, the news, and other things that could slow down my morning), before heading out of the house to my first client.\n\nMara Schiavocampo · Emmy Award-Winning Journalist\n\nI try to wake up between 5:30 and 6:30am. I set my alarm for 5:30am, but sometimes I end up hitting snooze several times. I’m a night owl by nature, so waking up early is absolutely painful for me. I know that it makes a huge difference in my productivity and overall happiness, which is why I push myself to do it even though I don’t want to. But I’m not someone who bounces out of bed. Those first few minutes are brutal.\n\nI leave my phone downstairs in the kitchen so I’m forced to get up and walk down a flight of stairs to turn it off. Then I immediately check messages, all of my social media accounts, and a few news sites. I do this to wake myself up. I stand at the counter and scroll for about fifteen minutes. Then I really get started. I make a double shot of espresso and down it like medicine. I go back upstairs and get dressed in my gym clothes, brush my teeth and hair—the whole routine. I grab my gym bag, kiss my husband, peek in on the kids, and go back downstairs.\n\nI roll out my yoga mat and do about ten minutes of stretching. I read somewhere that physical movement prepares the mind for meditation. I don’t know if that’s true, but it works for me. It also helps to wake me up a little more so I don’t fall asleep while meditating. After stretching I sit on the couch and spend a few minutes reading a spiritual text. Then I do some journaling. Most often that consists of making lists: gratitude, prayers, my intentions for the day (specific tasks I’d like to complete). I pray and then meditate for about ten minutes. I use mala beads and go all the way around once. Then I grab my gym bag and head out to a class—either yoga, spin, or bootcamp. Some days I’ll work out on my own, but I prefer classes because they push me much harder. After class I have a protein shake, shower, and then start tackling the list of intentions I made that morning.\n\nJosh LaJaunie · Runner\n\nI usually wake up around 4:00am and begin my run by 4:30 or so, while waiting for the gym to open at 5:00. After an hour of running, I go inside my gym where I do some body-weight strength work—usually pull-ups, push-ups, and dips.\n\nLauren Berger · Founder of Intern Queen\n\nI typically wake up between 6:00-6:30am (I’m guilty of pressing snooze a few times!). I like to make my to-do list the night before, so I’m focused first thing and don’t get distracted by emails, etc. I walk downstairs, sit at my kitchen barstools, and dive into the first two tasks on my to-do list.\n\nMy husband is usually working as well at this time; he’s in charge of coffee—lots of coffee! Once it gets closer to 7:45am, I grab either a banana or eggs, pack up my work bag, and run upstairs to do hair/makeup and get ready for the day. On the way to the office (a three-minute commute), I grab a grande iced coffee and call my best friend who lives in Oklahoma for a quick (really quick) catch-up.\n\nSabrina Zohar · Co-Founder of Softwear\n\nNew year, new ritual, amiright? I usually gauge what time I go to bed by what time I need to be up. I value sleep, but I also value getting my work done. As a new entrepreneur, I am fine-tuning that balance every day.\n\nI typically start my morning anywhere between 8:00-9:00am with a meditation. I prefer guided meditations through Insight Timer, but even sitting in silence focusing on your breathing is a great way to clear your mind and set the path you want to take for the day. After meditating, I come upstairs to make my favorite morning coffee using a collagen-and-superfood creamer. Then I take my pup to the park to run it out. I end my morning ritual by journaling and jotting down five things I am grateful for. I think it is incredibly important to have goals and visions of the future we want to build, but we must also give thanks for the amazing things we have built thus far.\n\nMy morning routine lasts about forty-five minutes total. I usually aim to finish around 9:30-10:00am, so I can hit the ground running and start the day productively.\n\nKhajak Keledjian · Founder of Inscape\n\nI wake up at 4:45am naturally—the Ayurvedic teachings say to wake up around one and a half hours before sunrise. Once I wake up, I spend five minutes or so daydreaming in bed and breathing to acclimate before I touch my phone. Then, I take fifteen minutes to wash up, brush my teeth, etc.\n\nI then do forty-five minutes of yoga, listening to chants and mantras or a mixture of Russian and Tibetan body movement, followed by thirty minutes of advanced pranayama (breathing). Next, I practice meditation for 30-45 minutes (and sometimes for an hour on the weekend).\n\nI read The New York Times and scan through emails once I’m done with my yoga, breathwork, and meditation, and then I spend twenty minutes on the Simply Piano app on my iPad—I’m learning to play piano this way. Around the time I’m done playing piano, my daughters, Dalita and Ava (ages four and two) wake up. Sometimes we read a chapter of a book and I make them masala chai (they call it “special tea”); other times we’re simply playful and play hide and seek.\n\nThen I shower and sit with my wife and children while they have breakfast. Sometimes we’ll have a quick play on the gongs because my daughter Ava loves to play with me. She’s two and a half years old and even likes to ride her bike right into the gongs!\n\nLiz Fosslien · Illustrator\n\nI wake up every day at 6:30am, even when I’ve gone to bed at 3:00am, and even when I’ve just switched time zones. This is a curse, not a blessing.\n\nAfter I wake up, I usually try to doze or listen to podcasts for a bit. I get out of bed between 7:15 and 7:45am, put in my contacts, wash my face, and then start making coffee. While the water is heating, I take three vitamins. I have a big Ziploc bag I filled with important vitamins, but I can’t remember what they are. The vitamins each have different shapes, so I know I’m taking one of each that I’m supposed to be taking.\n\nOnce I’ve made coffee, I eat and then toggle between email and National Affairs Findings. National Affairs Findings is a daily round up of abstracts from academic papers focused on a theme (crime, gender, housing, etc.). I highly recommend it. If my boyfriend is awake, I’ll read him my favorite abstracts and we’ll discuss the research results. Then I look at my to-do list and pick the three most important/pressing items. This helps me figure out how to structure the rest of my day.\n\nAround 8:30am, I go to the gym. You have to go the gym before your brain has a chance to convince you not to go to the gym. (I’m also propelled out the door by the fact that the gym only offers validated parking until 9:30am on weekdays.)\n\nTara Hanrahan · Corporate Spa Director\n\nI wake up at 5:30am Monday through Friday. I’m normally awake before my alarm and snuggle in bed for a few minutes (but not for too long, otherwise my brain will try to talk me out of getting up!). I get up, weigh myself on the Fitbit Aria scale, make my bed (well, pull the covers up), and throw on my gym clothes to exercise.\n\nI get home from exercising just after 6:30am. I light some incense and run the bath. I always have a bath in the morning and a shower at night. I adore having morning baths. I live in a condo and my bathroom has floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook the street, so I love having a look at people as they walk by, imagining their lives, and giving them a silent cheer. Opposite me is a local hotel that hangs its laundry on the roof to dry, and I lazily view the people hanging the sheets out.\n\nI have a beautiful range of bath oils and salts to use. I’m an aromatherapist, and scents/aromas are very important to me. I also work with spas, so different skin and body products feature quite prominently in my routine! I choose the bath oil based on how I want to feel—it’s normally an uplifting, energizing blend like eucalyptus and rosemary or perhaps a sensual blend like rose and black pepper. I also throw in a handful of magnesium salt—fabulous for just after exercise. While the bath is getting ready, I do my morning skincare routine. This involves a cleansing balm, a citrus-infused warm towel compress, and a gentle press exfoliant. Then I apply a face mask, depending on what my skin needs for that day, and that stays on until I finish my bath.\n\nI prepare my clothes for the day. I normally have an idea already of what I will wear, and I lay the clothes on my bed. I choose my accessories (jewelry, shoes, etc.) and get them organized.\n\nThen I go out to the kitchen, make a life-affirming espresso, and choose what to listen to while I’m in the bath. It’s normally affirmations or a ten-minute morning meditation (from my YouTube playlist). I do a dry skin body brush all over for a few minutes to increase circulation and get rid of any dry skin. I jump/fall/plop into the bath and lie back, sipping my coffee, perusing people walking down below on the street, all while listening to the lovely words.\n\nThen I get out, dry myself off, and use a dry body oil to moisturize my skin. I have struggled with weight for many years and have tended to ignore my body. I find that the self-nurturing process of massaging myself with oils allows me to reconnect. (It helps that I am a trained massage therapist.) So, I do that, then I layer serums on my face (I’m a fan of the Korean beauty trend of layering), and go to my perfume bar. I choose my scent for the day, spray a few pumps in the air, and walk through it.\n\nI change the music to something upbeat and get dressed. Then I sit down at my duchess (dressing table) and do my makeup. I might also say some quick mirror affirmations.\n\nThen I get breakfast organized. I sit outside on my balcony to have breakfast and write. I have a little book that I write in daily—just some musings on what’s come up. I’ll then come back inside and floss and clean my teeth. Then I put on my lipstick and shoes, grab my handbag, and leave for work. It only takes twelve minutes to drive to work, so I normally listen to a TED Talk on the way.\n\nThe above sounds as though it takes many hours, but it doesn’t! I normally leave home just before 8:00am. I arrive at work and I feel so accomplished and full of energy. I feel as though I am on my path, and that carries me through for the rest of the day!\n\nJules Clancy · Cookbook Author\n\nI have my alarm set for 4:50am and mostly get up as soon as it goes off (thanks to following Mel Robbins’ 5 Second Rule). I still can’t believe I’ve become an early riser, but since having children, my mornings are my me time.\n\nGenerally, I’ll then weigh myself, test my blood sugar (I’m a type 2 diabetic), and then do two sets of fifty kettlebell swings, which gets my heart rate going and wakes me up. I’ll then get dressed and sneak into my studio while the rest of the house sleeps.\n\nI meditate using transcendental meditation for twenty minutes and then do some journaling/goal-writing and affirmations. Lately I’ve been substituting the journaling with visualization exercises from Maxwell Maltz’s Psycho Cybernetics.\n\nI then do half an hour of work from about 6:00am, usually something creative that requires a fresh mind. After that I go for a walk for thirty or sixty minutes (depending on the day), feed my chooks (Australian for chickens), and collect the eggs. I’m still excited that every morning we have super fresh eggs!\n\nBreakfast is next. Pancakes or porridge (oatmeal) for my boys (three and five years old) and some sort of eggs, usually with potatoes, for my Irishman. Black coffee for me. I fast until lunchtime because it helps with my blood sugar and it’s much easier in the morning than having to cook breakfast for one more person!\n\nCatherine Duc · Grammy-Nominated Composer\n\nI wake up around 6:15am and drink a large glass of water before preparing my breakfast. I listen to podcasts while preparing and eating my breakfast, alternating between The Productivity Show, The EDM Prodcast, and various finance and personal development podcasts. I also check my music-related email during this time.\n\nI’ll then clean up the kitchen and get ready for work (my day job is in finance and I do music part-time). It’s only a ten-minute walk to the train station, so I walk, although there are two bus routes right outside my apartment that go to the station. I really enjoy walking, and the fresh air wakes me up. There’s a small waterfall on the way, so it’s very picturesque.\n\nThe train ride into the city (Melbourne) is about twenty minutes, so I use that time to do a bit of reading for leisure. In the mornings, the train is super crowded and has standing room only, so it’s impossible to read a large technical book. Sometimes you can barely get your phone out!\n\nI then walk from the station to the office. After turning on the computer and unpacking my things, I make coffee on the espresso machine at work. I used to make coffee later in the morning, but I find having coffee first thing makes me really productive (yes, I know I’m addicted!) and allows me to do a lot of the work that requires concentration during the first two hours of the day. There are not many phone calls until mid-morning, so this is an ideal time to power through the to-do list. I always schedule my tasks the day before, with the most important tasks first, while also being conscious to build in some time for other things that may come up throughout the day.\n\nRobert Greene · Author\n\nMy morning routine changed after I had a stroke about four months ago.\n\nPrior to the stroke I would wake up around 7:30-8:00am without an alarm clock. I have the privilege of working for myself so I don’t have to put up with the tyranny of an alarm clock. Instead, I wake up to the sun pouring into the bedroom.\n\nAfter brushing my teeth I would then go into my office and take out two black meditation cushions and do a morning meditation. I would sit in a lotus position next to the window and meditate for thirty-five minutes. I’ve been doing a form of zen meditation for over eight years, every morning without fail. After my morning meditation I would eat breakfast with a cup of black tea and read The New York Times—I’m kind of old-school so I still get the paper version, although lately this has felt a bit ridiculous because by the time it arrives everything within it is sort of irrelevant.\n\nThen I would wash the dishes, take a shower, and every other day I would have a shave. I enjoy my morning shaving routine. A couple years ago I started using a heavy-duty German razor with extremely sharp Japanese blades that can really cut your face up, so you have to be very careful. Along with an old-fashioned shaving cream and a brush, I do a sort of barber-shop ritual. I enjoy it very much. After this, I would get dressed and get to work.\n\nI would only do two or three hours of writing a day because that was all I could stomach; an hour in the morning and maybe two hours in the afternoon, and that’s about it. After lunch I would take a nap—I’m a big believer in naps—and then I would get back to writing at about 3:00-3:30pm, and then at the end of that I would feel pretty exhausted and ready to exercise.\n\nNicole Gibbons · Interior Designer\n\nMy alarm is set for 6:45am, but sometimes I snooze and wake up around 7:00. The first thing I do is meditate while sitting up in bed. I call it “beditation!” I have so much more on my plate now than ever before, so meditation really helps me clear my head so I can be more focused throughout the day. I also do a daily gratitude journal using the Five Minute Journal app on my phone.\n\nI’m in the early stages of building a new company, so it’s “all in” 24/7. We’re still all working together in one room for long hours, and it’s because of this that my morning “me time” is so sacred. I’m a true introvert and really need alone time to recharge, to think, and to get focused. On mornings when I don’t have ample time to get centered before work, I feel really frazzled. Typically, after I finish my meditation and journaling, I scroll through my team Slack and emails and glance at my calendar.\n\nBy 7:45am, I’m in the shower, and by 8:15 I’m ready to rock. After I’m dressed, I always straighten up my bed and tackle one housekeeping task, such as loading the dishwasher or organizing laundry to be picked up. I spend the next 45-60 minutes in the kitchen with my laptop. I eat breakfast, scroll through news headlines, take care of personal tasks or calls, and catch up on emails and work. I head out at around 9:00am, and my day is pretty full once I hit the office.\n\nSam Conniff Allende · Serial Entrepreneur\n\nI wake up at 5:30am and very, very quietly leave the house (I have two small children), run five kilometers to my office, shower, and get dressed.\n\nOnce I’m at the office I tackle the hardest part of the entire day—deciding on the one-three things I want to accomplish before I go home. (Hopefully I’ll accomplish more, but if it comes down to it, these are the essentials.) From 7:00-11:00am, I have four hours of “monk” time as Cal Newport calls it in his book Deep Work. During this time, all notifications are switched off and I permit myself only to write, read, and think.\n\nJeremy Anderberg · Editor and Podcast Producer\n\nThe alarm goes off at 5:00am. This is primarily for my wife (since I work from home), but I’m happy to be the first one out of bed to head downstairs to make coffee. For about the last five years, I’ve been making a French press every single morning, using coffee beans I’ve roasted myself. A Keurig takes a couple minutes (if it needs to heat up); a French press takes about ten. So it takes about five times longer, but it’s about one-hundred times better in taste. Totally, completely worth it.\n\nIn the four minutes that the coffee is steeping, I play a little game with myself to see if I can unload the dishwasher before the timer goes off. (With two small kids, and a lot of home cooking, the dishwasher runs every night.) I usually win.\n\nAfter coffee is made, I have about thirty minutes to myself while my wife is getting ready for work to just read a book—a “real,” physical book—at the kitchen table. It’s often something work-related or intellectual in nature. I’m wired to be able to dive right into heady stuff that early in the morning, so I take advantage of it. If it’s a particularly busy work season I’ll start in on emails or writing or podcast producing right away. Far more often than not, though, my day starts with reading.\n\nAfter that, my wife usually makes a smoothie, and then she joins me for some reading until she wakes up our nine-month-old at 6:15am for some breakfast and quick mommy time before heading off to work at 6:40 or so. From there, dad’s in charge, and it’s just hang-out time for about twenty minutes until the three-year-old is up at 7:00. Both kids are in daycare, so from getting dressed, to breakfast, to making lunches, to daycare drop-off, I’m busy until about 8:00am, at which point, I’m back home in my office, I spend about fifteen minutes planning my day (using the rule of three framework), and then I’m off and running.\n\nSabrina Hall · Multidisciplinary Designer\n\nMy alarm goes off at 6:05am (though I occasionally snooze). I then prepare my coffee and a protein-and-fruit shake and am out the door by 6:35. From there I commute to my work gym where I exercise for an hour.\n\nThis routine is new—I’m about six months in and enjoying the results thus far. I consider myself a night owl, so the earlier wake-up time has been quite the learning experience.\n\nMy sleep schedule varied constantly over the last five years when I was an independent consultant. I was always working, looking for work, making pitches, and trying to find my way though what at the time felt like a sea of unknown. I was comfortable with staying up later at night as it was the best time for me to concentrate and take care of tasks without interruption.\n\nThe shift started about two years ago after becoming engrossed in the care of a loved one while still consulting. I realized that I did not have enough bandwidth to do it all and started to feel the effects on my health. I was constantly sluggish, exhausted, and burnt out. After taking some time to reevaluate, I started the process of self-care, which included working out with a trainer. However, she only had availability in the mornings, so this was the first step toward an earlier routine.\n\nWorking through and keeping this routine made me realize I had to prioritize sleep more than before. Why? Well, because I felt awful working out after only four or five hours of sleep, and my trainer reminded me that it was generally unhealthy. While it initially felt like a gargantuan undertaking, I learned that I can start my day earlier and maximize things for my health while still taking care of personal and professional responsibilities. I now make my morning workout a priority regardless of where I am working and what time I have to start. I will say that I am still not a morning person… I still struggle with waking up early, but I’m accustomed to my routine and appreciate and respect it enough to not break it.\n\nDempsey Marks · Personal Trainer\n\nI wake up between 7:00 and 7:30am. I usually have my alarm set for 7:30am but often wake up before it goes off. When I do wake before it goes off, I get up. I believe it’s my body’s way of telling me it’s ready to start the day, and I don’t like re-starting my sleep cycle.\n\nOnce I’m awake I like to lie in bed and try to remember my dreams. I tend to have very vivid dreams and believe that we can learn a lot from our dreams about our hopes, anxieties, etc., so I spend a bit of time seeing if I can recall them. Dreams are known to work out emotions and solve problems. They are also known to help people function psychologically. I believe they are crucial to our emotional and mental health. I love getting a quick glimpse into my inner mind and creativity. It’s usually funny and revealing.\n\nAfter thinking about my dreams, I glance at my phone to see if I have any missed calls or texts. I don’t check social media or respond to anyone, though (unless it’s urgent, of course). It’s important for me to start my own day before consuming the content of others. Checking social media first slows me down and distracts me. Not only does it bog me down, it interferes with my focus. Research backs this up and shows the negative impact from attention deficit to depression. It’s not the best way to start off the day and accomplish one’s goals.\n\nIf my boyfriend is still in bed, we’ll spend a few minutes talking before I get up to brush my teeth and wash my face. After that I put on my workout clothes (because I like to train in the morning) and take my morning vitamins and supplements. Then I either walk to my local coffee shop (which takes about five minutes) or head to the kitchen to make coffee. Once I’ve had my coffee, I head out to my workout.\n\nZara Terez Tisch · Co-Founder of Terez\n\nI try my hardest to not be awake between 5:00-7:00am, but with two kids and three dogs it’s not easy.\n\nMy alarm is always set to 7:30am, and I pray I’m able to sleep in until then. But what usually happens is Chilaquiles (Chili for short, our new bernedoodle puppy) wakes us up earlier to go to the bathroom—usually around 5:16am sharp—crazy that he is so punctual right? We have got to a point where he will go back to sleep afterward in our bed, which has been an incredible improvement for us. The next one to wake up is usually my son, Ty, at around 7:00-7:30am, and after that the whole house begins to explode! Dogs barking and kids running around, which doesn’t really allow me to have a quiet sleepy morning. That’s when the day officially starts.\n\nSometimes I try to get a little more sleep and let David (my husband) go help with getting the kids ready for the day… I love to sleep as long as possible! Once I get up, I check my phone for anything urgent with Terez, then I wash my face, brush my teeth, moisturize, put on deodorant, take my vitamins, and get dressed—in that order! I’m a creature of habit.\n\nProfessor M.S. Rao · International Leadership Guru\n\nI wake up at 4:00am every day. I express my gratitude to God for gifting me one more day to freely share my knowledge with the world. I drink lots of water, brush my teeth, go to the washroom, and then go to my laptop to write books and articles for 3-4 hours. I am highly creative and productive early in the morning. I write whatever comes to my mind on the topic that I decided on the previous night—my mind is fresh with peace and tranquillity as there is no noise in the early morning.\n\nNext, I have breakfast. I am blessed with a brilliant and beautiful wife, Padmavathy, who wakes up a little later and offers me dried fruits and nuts―almonds, dates, cashews, and pistachios. She offers me a spoonful of honey and I enjoy it. She then gives me tea. My wife is an expert in making tea. After breakfast, I proceed to the gym.\n\nSusan Lin · Lead Product Designer, Cloudflare\n\nI wake up at around 7:30am. Mango Roll, my Mame Shiba Inu, sleeps at the foot of the bed and is ready to go when I get up. She has breakfast while I grab a cappuccino from the common area. There is an espresso machine in the complex I live in. She snarfs up her food before I return with my coffee.\n\nI then grab a cardigan with pockets so there’s plenty of room for the keys, dog treats, and poop bags. While having my coffee, I take Mango Roll on her morning walk, which loops through the nearby park and nature trail. I don’t take my phone with me. Sometimes we’ll take longer, especially if there’s another dog that she can play with to burn energy.\n\nWhen I come back, Mango is released. She drinks up plenty of water and takes a nap by the window. I fix myself breakfast and get ready for work. I don’t look at my phone until right before I leave, and only to check that nothing has come up affecting my commute, and to start the music for my walk. (After getting on the train, I switch to an audiobook.)\n\nDr. Anthony Youn · Plastic Surgeon\n\nOn most mornings when I’m not performing surgery, I wake up around 6:30am. I shower, brush my teeth, shave, and change into my suit. Next, I bring my two dogs, Bella and Macks, out for a walk. They are both rescue dogs whom we adopted about two years ago. Then I set out their food for them. Once they are done eating, I give them their medications and eye drops, and then they both go back to bed. What a life! By this time, my wife and children are waking up, and I sit down with my kids to have breakfast together. Typically, my breakfast consists of a green smoothie and maybe some scrambled eggs and gluten-free toast.\n\nAround 7:45am I drive my car to work and start the day. Once I get to the office I take a look at my patient schedule and post a “Good morning” message on Instagram. Then it’s time to see patients!\n\nOn surgery mornings I wake up around 5:45am, shower, shave, brush my teeth, and change into my scrubs. Then I head to the hospital and eat a breakfast of scrambled eggs, fresh fruit, and granola while I go over my patient surgery charts for the day. Once I’m done with the charts and breakfast, I walk over to the operating room locker room, change into hospital-issued scrubs, and go to mark my first patient for surgery. On these mornings my wife takes care of the dogs and kids since I’m up so early.\n\nDanette May · Health and Mindfulness Expert\n\nIn addition to finding time for myself each day, I have to get two little girls ready for school and manage a full-time business with my husband. I typically wake up around 5:30am. I love being up when everyone is still sleeping, when there is a stillness in our home. My favorite ritual that keeps me grounded every day is watching the sunrise while I sip on warm lemon water.\n\nOnce I exit my bedroom, I immediately heat water, pour it into my favorite mug, and squeeze juice from half of a lemon into it. I do this daily because it is one of the healthiest ways to begin your morning. Lemon juice balances your pH levels and guides your body to “healthy” mode. I love this morning routine, and I never start my day without it.\n\nAfter watching the sunrise, I sit for a minute and read or do soul writing. Once everyone begins to emerge from their beds (around 6:30am), I make myself my delicious Cacao Bliss coffee, which is packed with superfoods and provides the energy I need to take charge of my morning. I then help my girls pack their lunches and send them off to school.\n\nAt around 7:30am I head to the mountains with my one-year-old lab. This is an extraordinary time for me. The crisp mountain air, the smell of fresh pine, and the barren nature trails light my soul on fire. As I walk, I declare my “I am” affirmations, such as “I am love. I am successful. I am happy. I am inspired.”\n\nJamie Melzer · Fruit Jerky Entrepreneur\n\nI wake up naturally between 7:00-7:30am, after a good nine hours of sleep. Uncoincidentally, this is when my three year old wakes up as well. Historically, early alarms and I have not gotten along so well. Back in my banking days I used a vibrating alarm under my pillow to wake me up, so that I could be at my desk by 6:15am. I did this for years and still never adapted to it. As far as my body and brain are concerned, 5:00am may as well be 2:00am.\n\nImmediately after I wake up I peek at my phone screen to make sure there were no emergency calls or texts overnight. (Is that weird?) Then, if all is good, I make my way to the kitchen to start my morning routine. I start my day by drinking twenty-four ounces of water in the first fifteen minutes after I wake up. I won’t let myself drink coffee until I’ve had my water and taken my probiotics. Next up is my version of a Bulletproof coffee. It contains Four Sigmatic Mushroom Coffee, Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides, Fourth & Heart vanilla ghee, and Bulletproof Brain Octane Oil. (No, these are not ads—I just love them so much!) I add boiling hot water and combine them all in a blender for a delicious frothy coffee that keeps me full and focused for hours.\n\nNext, I text my husband to say good morning and wish him a good day. He usually beats me to it. We have done this daily for eight years, and I hope that we will always do it. I then spend about thirty minutes drinking my coffee and checking my emails and social media (work, not personal) to gauge my to-do list for the day. I address anything urgent before moving on to my morning workout.\n\nBefore I leave in the morning I make my bed, throw pillows and all. With all of the chaos around me, my brain can’t handle an unmade bed. Lastly, I try not to schedule meetings until after 11:00am. This gives me the morning to accomplish my routine, some office work, and my workout before running around town.\n\nSuzanne Gibbs Howard · Dean of IDEO U\n\nDuring the week, I wake up some time between 6:00 and 7:00am, and as late as possible on weekends. I don’t like to see the hours before 6:00am, so if I need to wake up before then, I lie to myself and set my clock forward and still set my wake up time at 6:00am. This little joke on myself always keeps me happy.\n\nJohn Jantsch · Small Business Marketing Consultant\n\nI get up between 5:00-5:30am and make a pot of pour-over coffee. While the coffee is brewing I drink twenty ounces of water with lemon squeezed into it and do a stretching routine, which mostly consists of yoga poses; typically downward dog to sphinx, to warrior one, with some Bikhram, half moon, and standing on one leg. It’s kind of my version of a sun salutation, I suppose. I then meditate for about ten minutes and read from the sacred text I’m working on at that moment (it changes).\n\nNext, I take my wife coffee in bed (I’ve been doing this for about 35 years) and we usually talk about the day for half an hour. Five or six times a week I exercise—a mixture of weights, yoga, running, and biking. I used to run a lot more, but now I think I enjoy the higher intensity weights stuff more.\n\nThen I walk or ride my bike to work. It’s only about a mile.\n\nJake Knapp · Productivity Author\n\nThe alarm goes off at 6:30am. I wake up and put on running shorts and a T-shirt. Then I head to the kitchen for a glass of water. I have breakfast—which is almost always oatmeal, plain yogurt, and nuts—with my wife and sons.\n\nNext, I exercise. On many days, I walk with my thirteen-year-old son to his school (which is about two miles away) and then run home. On other days, I go for a run in the park. Nothing heroic, just 25-30 minutes. Sometimes I do something else, and when I need a rest day, I take it. Starting my day with exercise gives me a big mood and energy boost throughout the day and makes me feel like I’ve accomplished something right off the bat. One of the big keys for me is getting dressed in running clothes right when I wake up, because it sets the default to exercise—my family expects it, and I expect it too.\n\nThen I decide what I want to be my “highlight” for the day. This is an idea I got from my friend John Zeratsky. Every morning, I choose one big thing to focus on and make time for it rather than reacting to everything in my inbox and on my to-do list.\n\nFinally, I have a cup of coffee and get to work.\n\nAshley Eckstein · Actress, Fangirl Trendsetter\n\nWhile the time I wake up is never consistent, I try to keep my overall morning routine the same. I actually really love my mornings! Mornings are my time for me, and I like to use them to ease into my day.\n\nA pretty standard morning for me starts at 5:00am. I drink two eight-ounce glasses of water and then make coffee.\n\nThe next part of my routine is inspired by Lewis Carroll and my favorite quote from Alice in Wonderland. The Queen said to Alice, “Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.” I always believe in at least one impossible thing that can happen that day. I truly believe that the more one believes in the impossible, the sooner the impossible becomes possible. It just takes practice—and practice, of course, makes perfect!\n\nAfter that, it’s time for breakfast, coffee, and TV for an hour. This is usually when I watch my favorite guilty pleasure shows like The Bachelor or The Bachelorette. After an hour, depending on what city I’m in, I do some sort of workout. I enjoy TRX classes, hot yoga, and jogging/hiking around my neighborhood.\n\nKrista Suh · Activist, Screenwriter\n\nI adjust my morning routine according to my intuition, a practice I cheekily call Pussy Schedules in my book because I’m letting my feminine intuition make the decisions! I like to keep my morning time very slow and private—kind of like women who choose to have a water birth, so the baby comes out of the watery womb into… more water. Similarly I like to come out of sleep and not immediately be inundated with people and meetings and demands and performances, and instead be in a peaceful place, in bed, awake.\n\nI try as often as possible to arrange my schedule so I don’t need to set an alarm, and generally that means I wake up around 8:00am. If I sleep past that I figure I needed those hours and don’t chastise myself for it.\n\nI try to not schedule anything involving showing my face or being “on” before 11:00am, so oftentimes I’ll work from bed in the mornings, and I favor the type of work that involves doing journaling exercises, meditating, and daydreaming. At some point I transition from journaling work into what I call “scheming” work because I like the nefarious undertone to that word. Scheming often involves logistics, collaborations, scheduling—I’ll “groom” my schedule over and over, getting very acquainted with my calendar, sometimes drawing it in my journal even though it’s all in my calendar app. To that end, I keep my laptop, paper notebook, pen, and iPhone all by my bed, as well as a tall glass of water because I’m often dehydrated!\n\nWhen my mouth gets too-gross feeling (the icky taste outweighs my natural laziness and desire to stay in bed), I’ll get up to brush my teeth, wash my face, and put my hair into a bun (having my hair out of my face is a signal to my body that it’s time to work!). I generally don’t shower in the morning—I like showering in the nighttime by candlelight.\n\n{% include content_banner.html %}\n\nFrom there, I’ll go to the kitchen and make hot water with lemon and eat some breakfast, usually yogurt or eggs. I usually return to my bed at that point and do more work on my laptop. If I’m cold I go under the covers, if I’m fine temperature-wise I make the bed and work on top of the coverlet. If I have a phone meeting I generally take it from my bed-cocoon-hive.\n\nKim Leutwyler · Painter\n\nI usually wake up at 7:43am, although that can vary based on how late I went to bed the night prior. I cannot set my alarm for times that end in 5 or 0 (not sure why exactly). I remain in bed to read news, check emails, and answer direct messages on social media.\n\nAfter 5-10 minutes my pup realizes I am awake and swats my iPhone out of my hand so that I will give her a morning cuddle. When we get out of bed, I let her outside and start boiling water in a kettle on the stove to make a pour-over coffee. If it feels like a painting day, I skip the shower and brekky, wandering straight into the studio (aka spare bedroom in the house) to stare at whatever painting I am working on. I begin painting almost immediately, and this lasts for 6-10 uninterrupted hours until I am absolutely starving or desperately need to pee.\n\nAshley Turchin · Co-Founder of ANTHOM\n\nAlarms are the bane of my existence, so I rarely set one. I tend to wake up naturally at around 7:00am. Immediately after I wake up, I walk blindly to the pre-prepared coffee pot and click the ‘on’ button. I pour two cups—one for me and one for my husband—bring them back to bed, and then we talk about our plans for the day and read our morning emails.\n\nAt 7:30am (or 8:00, if I go to the gym) I take a shower, do quick makeup, blend our daily smoothies (organic spinach, kale, strawberries, blueberries, banana, flax seed, and ginger), and am out the door. I’m a practical woman who likes functionality so I’m usually wearing something comfortable. Depending on what my day entails I can change or get dressed up at the store.\n\nAinsley Earhardt · Co-Host of Fox & Friends\n\nI wake up around 3:00am when my alarm goes off, and I snooze for a few minutes. When I finally roll out of bed, I check the baby monitor to make sure that Hayden, my daughter, is okay. After I get up, I get ready and go into the kitchen before I leave to grab either a cup of coffee or a glass of water. I make sure to get all my ducks in a row before I head out the door and go to work. On my way to work, I read my Jesus Calling daily devotion and put in earbuds and listen to hymns. Once I’ve read my devotion, I read through what’s coming up on the show one more time (because I’ve studied it the night before). I also read emails and go through materials that producers have sent me throughout the night.\n\nWhen I arrive at Fox, I’m still listening to my music and I go straight to hair and makeup. I’ll take out the music, turn on the television, and listen to Fox & Friends First to hear the latest headlines while I’m getting my hair and makeup done.\n\nI then head to my office at around 5:00am. I sit in my office with hot ginger tea and have about fifty minutes until we go live. I have the TV on and continue to listen to Fox & Friends First or flip around to other channels to see what they are airing. I log onto my computer and look through our rundown and any news of the day that’s been added since I last looked. I read through a lot of articles, especially the wires, to make sure I’m fully prepared. Then, I put all of my articles inside a manila folder and on the outside of the folder I write notes. I’m very visual—once I’ve read the article, I’ll highlight anything in it that I like and then I transfer that to the outside of my folder by writing it large so it’s easy to read. I then get ready for the show and head to the set about ten minutes before we go live on Fox & Friends from 6:00-9:00am.\n\nDes Traynor · Co-Founder of Intercom\n\nI wake up around 7:00am. After showering and dressing, I drink coffee in my kitchen while doing a quick pass of emails and my calendar in case there’s anything urgent (rare) and mentally planning the important tasks I have to work on. Three times a week I have a gym class at 8:00am, which is pretty crap but necessary.\n\nI’ve been trying the 16/8 method of intermittent fasting, which is actually a lot easier than I thought. As a result, I don’t eat breakfast.\n\nMitch Joel · Founder of Six Pixels Group\n\nI’ve got three extremely young children, so my morning routine usually looks like something out of the comics in the back of newspapers. It’s crazy town.\n\nI’m typically up at 5:00-5:30am navigating the children. From there it’s usually shower, get ready to go to work, get my stuff together, and run out of my home office. I then head down to my office parking. Before I come into the office every morning I use Headspace to get in my mindfulness meditation practice.\n\nNext, I grab a coffee—caffeinated or decaffeinated, depending on how I’m feeling and how hard I’m running. Then I head into the office. First thing in the morning, I really enjoy going through my email inbox and getting all the stuff that isn’t imperative or that has been sitting there for a while out of the way. Then I go through my list of tasks that I need to accomplish that day. I follow that with some form of writing, whether it’s an article that I’m going to post online or something that is due, before getting into my actual day.\n\nEsmé Weijun Wang · Novelist\n\nI tend to wake up between 4:30-5:00am. I don’t use an alarm. Once awake, I wash up and make coffee, which I drink while doing my morning journaling. I do a particular morning ritual in my journal that includes writing down my morning prayers of gratitude, my wishes, and my intentions for the day, and doing a tarot card pull to give me some guidance. I choose one item to be the day’s biggest priority—if I could only get one thing done that day, what would it be? Next, I choose 2-3 other tasks to sit on the priority list. I use the Things app to keep track of my tasks and projects, in addition to using a paper journal.\n\nI also keep a Things I Did Today list, which is basically what it sounds like. Keeping such a list is a good way of reminding myself of what I’ve actually accomplished instead of beating myself up over my endless list of tasks.\n\nAli Bonar · Co-Founder of Kween\n\nI’m not a morning person… but I’m not a night person, either. I guess you could say I’m an afternoon person? Or more candidly, a “loves to sleep” person? Either way, it’s a daily struggle to peel myself out of bed, so I need all the help I can get.\n\nThat said, my morning routine begins the night before: I lay out my workout clothes (bonus points for matching socks… it’s the little things), fill up my water bottle and put it next to my bed (I read somewhere that Jennifer Aniston chugs water in the morning, so I hopped on that train real quick), and set my alarm. I always put my alarm just out of reach, so I have to get out of bed to turn it off. It’s pure torture, really, but it prevents me from falling back asleep. Right before I go to bed, I queue up my Instagram post for the next morning, so I can quickly press “post” without thinking about it.\n\nFast forward to morning. My alarm usually goes off around 5:00 or 5:30am, depending on the workout class I’ve decided to commit myself to that day. I’m a member at Equinox (I know, I know… but the eucalyptus-scented towels just got me, okay?!) and I’m dabbling with Corepower Yoga, too. The only reason I work out in the AM is because—if I’m lucky—I’m still half-asleep during the class and don’t fully wake up until it’s over (#blessed).\n\nI come home, shower, get ready for work, and I’m out the door by 8:15am. I don’t eat breakfast at home since we have a fully stocked kitchen at work. I walk to work, which takes me around an hour because of 1) San Francisco’s hills and 2) my stubby little legs. I love this time of day though, because I get to catch up on podcasts—I’m currently loving Second Life and The Foodpreneur. If I’m caught up on podcasts, I’ll usually call my mom and dad (the Creators, as I call ’em), who are both living their best lives and traveling the globe. Ah, retirement.\n\nCal Newport · Author, Georgetown University Professor\n\nI usually wake up somewhere between 6:00 and 7:00am. On most weekday mornings I’ll then run down the street to a nearby park where I do twenty-five pull-ups to get the day started.\n\nBy the time I return home, the rest of my family is usually up, so we eat breakfast together while I read the paper. I then hang out with my boys until around 8:30am, which is when my work day typically begins.\n\nJacqueline Claudia · Founder, CEO of LoveTheWild\n\nMost mornings, I have my alarm set for 5:20am, though I’m usually up on my own by 5:00am and going through my email while I wait for the alarm to go off.\n\nAfter I get up, I throw on my workout clothes, head downstairs, turn on the espresso machine for my hubby, let the dogs out, and head out for a yoga class a few blocks from my house. The only class offered by CorePower at 6:00am is Yoga Sculpt. I call it jazzercise because the only thing it has in common with yoga is that you bring a yoga mat, but it’s better than nothing!\n\nWhen I get back, I take a super quick shower and help get the kids ready for school. My hubby makes me a Bulletproof coffee or a mocha with a heart on it. When the weather is nice, we steal a few quiet minutes on the porch in the sunshine while we drink our coffee. During lacrosse season, when our evenings are monopolized by practices, I put something in the crockpot for dinner. Then it’s time to double check that everyone has a snack and water bottle for school, shoes, and a jacket before we’re out the door at 8:10am. I drop the kids off at school and then I head to the office.\n\nAubrey Marcus · CEO of Onnit\n\nI wake up around 8:30am, typically after falling asleep sometime around 1:30am. I produce some of my best work at night, so I’ve created a structure that goes with my natural rhythm rather than trying to fight it.\n\nThe first thing I do after waking up is hydrate. I get twelve ounces of room temperature spring water, a dash of himalayan salt, and some lemon and crush it to rehydrate from the water I lost overnight. I then strip off my clothes, put on my goggles, and head out to the pool. The combination of the cold water, the movement of swimming laps, and the sunlight is the absolute ideal combination. The cold water boosts norepinephrine and drops my cortisol levels, and the sunlight and the movement sets my circadian rhythm. When I’m not at home, I’ll try anything from sneakily attacking my fiancée in bed with some morning jiu jitsu, or simply doing a few push-ups, burpees, or a little yoga. Not only does this make me feel more alert for the day, it helps me fall asleep later at night.\n\nBenjamin Hardy · Author, PhD candidate\n\nI wake up between 5:00-6:00am without an alarm. I throw on my gym clothes, grab some water or a pre-workout drink (I often switch between caffeinated and non-caffeinated), and drive to the gym. In the gym parking lot I say a prayer for inspiration and open my journal. I then write for ten to fifteen minutes focusing on my goals and plans for the day. I’ll then put on my headphones and listen to an audiobook during my forty-minute workout.\n\nOnce home, I get started on my most important work for the day. My most important job on any given day is to get clarity and get into the right frame of mind, what I’d call a “peak” or heightened state. I do this through meditation, prayer, journal writing, listening to uplifting content, and fitness.\n\nHowever, once I’m in that state I must do something with it. And that’s where my creative output is at its peak. One of the reasons I’m able to publish basically anything I write is because I pay very close attention to my pre-writing routine, and I only write when I’m in the right mental and emotional state. Thus, my most important job is to live in that state as consistently as possible. It’s the purpose of my morning routine: getting into that state so I can then work from that state.\n\nThus, the state is a means to an end—doing high quality work. Although it’s enjoyable in and of itself, because I’m in flow.\n\nDerik Mills · Founder, CEO of YogaGlo\n\nI tend to wake up naturally between 5:30 and 6:30am, depending on when I fall asleep the night before. The first thing I do is go to the kitchen to make tea. I’m a bit of a slow riser. While the water heats up and the tea steeps, I do some light stretching in the kitchen to let my body know it’s time to wake up. Where we currently live is very close to nature. I drink my tea on the balcony and listen to the sunrise sounds of birds and take in the changing colors of the sky. There is something so grounding and nourishing about being part of the dawn and what feels like the earth waking up.\n\nMy early morning routine varies depending on whether or not I ride. I ride my mountain bike or cyclocross bike in the Santa Monica Mountains three days a week, typically Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. My non-ride mornings look like this (in order): Tea, meditation, yoga asana and qigong (and two days a week I add in strength training), smoothie. My ride mornings look like this (in order): Tea, pre-ride food, stretch, ride (which I treat as a meditation), stretch (which I often don’t leave enough time to do), smoothie.\n\nFor me to start and maintain a routine, I need to remove any decision fatigue. I make enough decisions throughout the day, so I prefer for my morning self-care routine or preparation for the day to require very little decision making. (I also like to reduce decision time on what I’m going to wear for the day. When I find a pair of pants or type of shirt I like, I buy them in multiples and in different colors.) My cycling coach creates my riding workouts, and I have my go-to favorites for yoga and meditation on YogaGlo. I also leave my yoga mat rolled out and other exercise equipment ready nearby so I don’t spend any time prepping for yoga and fitness. The above routine and their full planned durations is ideal. My priorities are my company and my wife and family, all of which sometimes shorten the time I have for the routine.\n\nMorning is also the best time for me to write. When I’m writing something I tend to work on it after tea, which then shifts the above schedules a bit. Also, if the surf is great, then that may take priority (but that’s very rare these days). Sometimes I swap a ride for a hike, depending on how my body is feeling.\n\nEliza Blank · Founder, CEO of The Sill\n\nMy alarm goes off every morning at 6:30am, but I generally stay in bed for the first thirty minutes of my day. I check in on the business—email, calendar, and the sales numbers that came in overnight while I was asleep. It gets me excited for the day ahead.\n\nBy 7:00am I’m out of bed for a shower and breakfast. I never leave the house without a good breakfast. I usually don’t have another meal until dinner, so I never skip it. I always do a quick read of theSkimm and then have coffee. I get my coffee at this amazing Brazilian cafe in our neighborhood called O Cafe. They serve organic, sustainable coffee and the most amazing pao de queijo. Lunch is usually just an accumulation of snacks and (more) coffee throughout the day.\n\nUnless I have important meetings, I generally keep it pretty casual. My typical uniform includes Madewell jeans, a T-shirt or sweater, and tied-back hair. I try to keep it simple so I can get out the door quickly.\n\nOnce I’m ready to head out, I double back to make the bed and wash any dishes from breakfast. It makes me feel like I’ve already accomplished something important before my day truly begins. And it’s nice to come home to a clean apartment at the end of the day.\n\nJudge Jeremy Fogel · Senior U.S. District Judge\n\nI usually wake up between 5:30 and 6:00am. I get the newspaper, make a cup of coffee, and put on quiet classical music. Listening to the kind of music I do—my favorites are Bach, Handel, and the baroque-era composers—almost always has a calming effect on me, and the structure of the music seems to engage my attention.\n\nI check my email and read the paper before having a light breakfast and getting ready for work.\n\nJoel Gascoigne · Co-Founder and CEO of Buffer\n\nI try to make sure I get at least seven and a half hours of sleep. Sleep is important! I wake up around 6:30am and drink 500 milliliters (16.9 ounces) of water as soon after getting up as I can. I quickly check company emails for any emergencies, and then most days I do thirty minutes of cardio (swimming or running) and then ten minutes in the sauna. I then have a simple breakfast before starting work.\n\nThis gives me the best start to my day that I’ve found, gets the endorphins going, and makes me feel refreshed and ready to make progress.\n\nJulie Zhuo · VP of Product Design, Facebook\n\nI wake up to my alarm at 7:00am. I might close my eyes and, depending on how sleepy I am, be in bed for another five minutes or so before getting up.\n\nMy phone (alarm) is in my bedroom, but I have to actually get up to turn it off (I have it charging across the room so it’s not next to the bed).\n\nVanessa Van Edwards · Behavioral Investigator\n\nI wake up around 7:00am and try not to use an alarm. I instead try to wake up naturally at the same time every morning.\n\nI usually cuddle with my husband and ask him about his agenda for the day. Then I start my day by picking fresh tea leaves in my garden. This time of morning it is beautiful outside, and I love getting the fresh leaves (usually mint—I have six different kinds of mint plants!). Then I hand grind the tea leaves and wait while they steep. This is the closest thing to meditation that I do. The manual process of clipping, crushing, and steeping the leaves wakes up all of my senses. Then, at 7:45am, I take my tea and read a non-fiction book to warm up my brain for the day. I try to read books that could inspire my work: behavioral books, self-help, and research non-fiction. It helps get me in the right mindset. After about 30-45 minutes of reading I get to my desk.\n\nLily Percy · Executive Producer\n\nI usually wake up between 6:30-7:00am. If my body is feeling up for it, I’ll take an early morning Pilates Reformer class, or run on the treadmill or work out on the elliptical in my apartment building’s gym.\n\nOnce I’ve showered, dressed, and gotten everything ready for work, I’ll sit down and eat breakfast, which is usually a bowl of quinoa porridge (Martha Stewart has a great recipe!).\n\nAfter eating I’ll spend about five minutes reading, meditating, and praying, usually guided by words from the Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hahn in his book Peace is Every Breath. The subtitle for this book is “A Practice for Our Busy Lives” and it is exactly that. Thich Nhat Hahn guides you through meditations that you say out loud and reflect on while you eat breakfast, brush your teeth, shower, and get dressed. They are practical and helpful and I especially appreciate the guidance to be mindful in the things that I am doing in the morning, and not just on sitting and breathing. Depending on how I’m feeling, I will also alternate reading out loud from Cheryl Strayed’s wonderful book of quotations, Brave Enough—I treat the book as a kind of Magic 8 Ball; I open it up to a random page and see what Cheryl has to inspire me with that day, and I take time to reflect on her wisdom—and Daily Prayer with the Corrymeela Community, a book of prayers by the amazing poet Pádraig Ó Tuama. The prayers in his book are healing and comforting and always create a space of internal reflection and contemplation for me as I read them out loud. Reading words out loud to myself in the morning from these books gives me direction for the day, or whatever I am feeling or needing to hear at the time, and are essential in making sure I feel present and centered to face the day ahead. These five minutes are incredibly helpful in making sure I feel present and centered to face the day ahead.\n\nLior Arussy · CEO of Strativity\n\nRoutine is a strange word for someone who flies 250,000 miles a year. I have three primary routines. The first one is when I’m at home, the second when I travel, and the third when I’m on stage.\n\nAt home, my day starts between 5:00-6:00am. I get up and check my phone (it’s not by my bed by design) with a quick scan to see if our international offices, which are on different time zones, need something urgent. Otherwise, I get the basics done—brushing my teeth, shaving, washing my face, and getting dressed. I then check on my youngest son, who is usually already awake. My routine then continues with the Jewish morning prayers and a quick study of Jewish scriptures. These practices align me to the “why” in life before I go and deal with the “what” and the “how.”\n\nWhen I’m traveling, my wake-up time varies. I start my day at the hotel gym, which is really empty at 3:00am, so I have it all to myself. I always try to keep to Eastern Standard Time, hence the early wake up.\n\nOn days when I’m on stage, I need to get into the zone. I usually refrain from any emails or other distractions in the morning. Following the basics of my routine, I also review my stage notes one last time. I like to write them by hand—I can commit them to memory better that way. Then I listen to my special playlist (including “Stand By You” by Rachel Platten, “Some Nights” by Fun, “Power to the People” by The Black Eyed Peas, “Hall of Fame” by The Script, and “One Day” by Matisyahu) to get me all pumped and ready to perform on stage.\n\nBrent Gleeson · Navy SEAL Veteran\n\nMy morning routine has evolved significantly over the years as I have gone from Navy SEAL operator to entrepreneur to husband and father of three. As one can imagine, the priorities of my morning activities have shifted.\n\nFor example, years ago during graduate school and the evolution of my first company, the routine was simple. I would wake up at 5:00am, make the bed, drive twenty minutes to La Jolla (San Diego), and swim one or two miles. At 6:30am, I would get coffee and a light snack at the usual spot and then head to the office, strapping in at 7:00am for a long day of work.\n\nWhen I got married and the children started flowing, things evolved. Adaptation and prioritization are key—that is, if you want to be happily married! I awake at 6:00am largely because my children dictate my routine. Our three-year-old comes into the room promptly at 6:00am (as if she has a perfect internal alarm clock) and crawls into bed with us, followed shortly after by her one-year-old brother (although he has to be retrieved from his crib).\n\nWe cuddle and play with the youngest kids for twenty minutes or so before getting up to start the day. This involves making sure our eleven-year-old is ready for school, answering a few emails, and making my to-do list. This part is critical. A to-do list that isn’t properly prioritized is just a disorganized mess of things that either won’t get done or will get done poorly.\n\nAfter taking our oldest son to school, it’s execution time.\n\nChristy Wright · Founder of Business Boutique\n\nI have three morning routines depending on what time I wake up:\n\nI wake up at 4:15am to work out. I get ready, get some coffee, and head to the gym. I work out from about 5:00 to 6:00am, and then I come home and drink another cup of coffee before helping with my boys (getting them milk, changing their diapers, helping them go potty, etc.). Then I get in the shower and get ready for work.\n\nI wake up at 6:00am. Get coffee, help with the boys, shower, and get ready for work.\n\nI wake up to my son hitting me on the head with his Mickey Mouse stuffed animal and scramble the rest of the morning because I didn’t wake up before the kids to get a head start. That’s real life with little ones!\n\nWhitney Johnson · Leading Management Thinker\n\nOnce I roll out of bed between 5:00 and 5:30am, I go downstairs and get myself a great big glass of ice water. I then head back upstairs to my office​, sit at my desk, and read a scriptural text. During this time of meditation and thinking, I have thoughts and ideas of things I need to do that day that weren’t already on my calendar. Normally they’re about people I need to reach out to, sometimes business-related and sometimes not. This is when my brain is clearest and I am the least likely to edit my ideas or thoughts. I tend to think a bit more expansively during this time.\n\nAs I’m thinking, I pull out a piece of scratch paper and make a to-do list. This is in addition to my master Excel spreadsheet that lists things I want to accomplish during the day, the week, and the quarter.\n\nIn the morning I’m thirsty but not very hungry, so I eat between 8:00 and 9:00am. My favorite breakfasts include leftovers—this past week I had chicken and cheese enchiladas for breakfast—but a staple is scrambled eggs with cheese. I love cheese, and it is low on carbohydrates (I’m pre-diabetic), so even better.\n\nThis, of course, is when I’m at home. When I’m on the road, my routine varies slightly. I generally travel to either speak or consult with a corporate client, so I wake up early, mentally run through my notes and what I’m going to say while still lying in bed, and then meditate and pray before heading out.\n\nCorbett Barr · Independent Entrepreneur\n\nI wake up around 8:30am. My wife and I take our dog for a walk every morning for about thirty minutes. I find this helps get the blood flowing and wakes up my brain.\n\nAfter the walk, some days I stop at a coffee shop and get to work right away. Other days I work from home, and start by brewing some green tea. I typically eat breakfast around 10:00am and work until 1:00pm or so. From there, a few days a week I take a break to work out (running outside or doing bodyweight exercises at home).\n\nGrant Faulkner · Executive Director of NaNoWriMo\n\nI generally wake up around 4:30am and make a pot of coffee. Twyla Tharp said that in order to get to the gym in the mornings, she focuses only on getting to the cab because she knows if she makes it to the cab, then she’s good. The pot of coffee is my cab.\n\nOn ideal days, I read one reflection from a book called 365 Tao: Daily Meditations, and then I meditate for five minutes. I sometimes write in my journal for a few minutes to remember details from the previous day—and to just warm up creatively. I then dive into whatever writing project I have going and try to stay off the internet so I can focus as intensely as possible. My dog Buster usually joins me by this point, and he sleeps on my lap with my laptop perched on top of him (he’s now a key part of my creative process).\n\nUnfortunately, around 6:00 or 6:15am, I have to switch to my long queue of email because if I don’t triage it and answer as many as possible, it becomes overwhelming. At 6:30, I rouse my kids from sleep to get ready for school, and then I walk Buster and try to think through my morning’s writing.\n\nAfter the mad rush to get the kids to school, I go to work for part two of my morning routine—my day job at NaNoWriMo.\n\nMelanie Deziel · Branded-Content Strategist\n\nWhen I had a desk job in the corporate world, I had a much more efficiency-focused routine centered mostly on accomplishing the necessary tasks as quickly as possible to get out the door. Since I started my own consulting firm two years ago, a big part of my goal was to feel more content and less anxious about my schedule and my work, so I’ve tried to focus on creating a calmer and “un-rushed” feeling in the morning so I can ease into my day. This is especially important because my work as a speaker and consultant means a lot of travel, so that morning calm is key to preparing for a gig.\n\nWhile this means there’s a little variability to my mornings day-to-day, I try not to beat myself up over it. Being calm and open to shifts in my routine is better than being rigid about it and creating a feeling of failure when I can’t make it happen.\n\nI generally set my alarm for 7:15am, with the knowledge that I’ve got time to snooze once or twice if my bed is just too comfy. I’m up and at ’em by 7:30, and the first thing I do is make the bed, every single morning. I remember hearing a few years ago that making the bed in the mornings sets you up for a productive day; whether it’s true or not, I can’t say, but I do it without fail.\n\nMy fiancé usually makes breakfast for us, so while he’s prepping I take my phone off “Do Not Disturb” mode and do a quick email audit to ensure there’s no changes to my schedule I need to know about ahead of time. We eat together in our PJs every morning; it’s great to be able to spend that time together before the day gets crazy.\n\nOnce breakfast is done, we clean up and get the day started. Teeth brushing, face washing, vitamins, and getting dressed. My goal is to be out the door by 9:15am, starting my commute by 9:30, and to be at one of my favorite cafés to kick off the day’s work by 10:00.\n\nBob Guest · Entrepreneur, Bike Rider\n\nMy routine these days varies depending on whether it’s a bike-riding day or a walk-in-the-park-with-Bear day. (Bear is my seven-year-old Blue Merle Shetland Sheepdog.)\n\nTuesdays and Thursdays are bike days (weather permitting). On these mornings, I wake up at 4:45am, hit snooze once, check the weather to be sure we won’t be rained out, and then get out of bed. I wash my face, brush my teeth, put on seasonally appropriate biking clothes, and head downstairs. Bear usually trails me around throughout the morning, so I feed him, make myself a Nespresso, and once we’re both done we head out for a walk around the neighborhood. Getting outside before leaving on the bike ride is helpful because I can tell if I’ve dressed appropriately. To be on time I have to be out the door and on my bike by 6:15am. Right before leaving I give Bear a treat so he lets me go without a fuss.\n\nI always turn on MapMyRide when I head out because I keep track of my annual mileage. Every year I try to make it to 2,000 miles. In 2017 I was at 2,075, so I only just made it. In 2016 I hit 2,200. I was aiming for 3,000 this past year, but it didn’t end up working out. Next time…\n\nThe guys I ride with have fall-out-of-bed-and-get-on-their-bikes routines, but I need some time in the morning to settle in to the day. When I oversleep and have to race to get out the door, I just don’t ride as well. I meet my two friends at the “Parkthanon” in Prospect Park, Brooklyn. I have no idea what it was originally built for, but we’ve dubbed it that because it reminds us of the Parthenon. From there, we do five laps around the park, and after we say goodbye I usually sprint up “Look Out Mountain” (another landmark name I’ve made up) on the way home. I have a love/hate relationship with hills and like to do this for the challenge of it.\n\nAfter finishing the sprint, I head home—that’s about nineteen miles total. Once I’m back home, I eat breakfast, which is almost always high-fiber flakes with raisins and nuts, fresh fruit in the summer, and almond milk. Sometimes I read the paper or look through the New York Times on my phone a bit, and then I shower, get dressed, kiss my wife (who is still asleep nine out of ten mornings), gather up Bear, hop in the car, and go to work.\n\nMondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are my walk-with-Bear-in-the-park mornings. I set the alarm a little later for these days—5:30am instead of 4:45am. The same single-snooze ritual usually occurs, and then I get up, brush my teeth, shower, and check the weather. When I head downstairs I feed Bear, make some coffee, and have breakfast. Once Bear and I finish eating, I pick up a poop bag and am out the door by 6:30am. Our house is only a block and a half from the park, so I walk up through the Parade Ground and enter through an “unofficial” side entrance on Parkside Avenue.\n\nTypically we walk clockwise around the lake and follow a path into the Peninsula area. There are lots of wooded paths with undulating twists and turns, and all of it is right in Brooklyn’s backyard. There’s a path we usually follow around to the Nethermead (the Peninsula and Nethermead are designated dog areas until 9:00am), and then we walk around the boat house, past the skating rink, and begin to walk home. The whole thing is more than three miles, and it usually takes an hour and a half. It’s such a beautiful way to start the day. In winter the park is usually quieter and still dark at that hour, and the sun comes up while we’re walking. In the summer months you have to get out earlier to catch the sunrise; that’s one of the nicer things about winter. The whole thing gives me time to walk under the trees and think about life, as well as what’s in store for my day. When I see something beautiful I take a picture and post it on Instagram. I often run into people and dogs whom I know—I’ve actually made some really great friends from our morning walks. We’re usually back home by 8:00am, and then I grab my bag, get Bear in the car, and we head to work together.\n\nKara Goldin · Founder of Hint Inc\n\nI wake up every morning at 5:30am on the dot. The first thing I do is check my email and my calendar. This gives me a chance to see what’s in store for the day and to make sure I don’t miss any urgent emails that came in since the night before.\n\nNext on the agenda is a large latte and a hike with my two dogs. I live in Marin County, so there are beautiful hikes right outside my door, and taking the time every morning to enjoy the outdoors and get some exercise refreshes me and gets me ready to tackle any challenges that come my way.\n\nWhen I get home, I make myself a healthy smoothie and then take advantage of a small fifteen-minute window before I take the kids to school. I usually use this time to check in with staff or to cross a quick task off my to-do list for the day. After I shower and drop off the kids, I head into the office feeling energized and ready to take on my day.\n\nKevin Warren · Chief Commercial Officer, Xerox\n\nI typically wake up at 5:30am and, depending on where I am, start working out in my home gym in Washington, D.C. or in the gym in my condo complex in Connecticut by 5:45am.\n\nAfter my workout I practice about fifteen minutes of mindfulness/meditation/yoga before I hit the shower. I grab a coffee and a light breakfast to start my day in the office, typically around 7:30am.\n\nDavid Gallo · Media, Set, and Production Designer\n\nI’ve never had a morning routine. I don’t know how you establish a routine when you never know where you’re going to wake up or what you’re going to do that day. Some days I wake up in a hotel room and don’t need to get to the theater until noon. Other days I have to race to Sesame Street by 8:00am. Many days I drink coffee and read the news until I need to start work.\n\nOn my favorite days, I have my kids. I usually put out cereal and bowls for them before they go to bed, but when I get up I often make them another breakfast anyway, like eggs or French toast. I have to admit that I put way more time into arranging the assorted cereal boxes and bowls I leave out for the girls the night before than I put into thinking about the nutritional value of the food itself. But they don’t seem to mind. I make their young lives more surreal—recently I made them an elaborate Stonehenge affair from two dozen mini cereal boxes.\n\nJing Wei · Illustrator\n\nI should probably preface this by saying that I’m not much of a morning person. That, combined with the fact that I’m a freelancer, is a dangerous situation.\n\nMy mornings can vary wildly depending on what my day looks like. Some days I’m out the door at 8:00am, other days I work at home in my PJs until 2:00pm. But most days I wake up comfortably around 9:00am. From there, I take a shower, wrestle with my eyeliner (I won’t admit the amount of time it takes to do this), sit down with a mug of tea, and look over what I need to do that day. I like to have simple, quiet mornings to balance out the workday. The last thing I want is to wake up to a list of tasks, especially because my job often involves a million tiny to-dos. I like to create pockets of down time for myself anywhere I can in the day.\n\nOnicia Muller · Writer and Comedian\n\nMy morning routine is consistent, but there aren’t any hard rules.\n\nWhile still in bed, between 6:00 and 7:00am, I pray and look at funny content my husband finds on Reddit and other sites. He isn’t fully awake, so this is our way of spending quality time without having deep conversations. Between 7:00 and 8:00am I eat, work out, and dress (when I have a meeting). Between 8:00 and 8:30am, I review my agenda. I start working at 8:30am.\n\nSometimes I do these things out of order. For example, when I’m working on a script, I start writing at 6:00am. Eating breakfast, working out, and looking at memes can wait until 8:30am. Creative writing requires my best energy. I strive to bust out those pages before my inner critic wakes up. I learned this from Julia Cameron’s The Artist’s Way.\n\nSteven Heller · MFA Design Program Co-Chair, SVA\n\nI wake up between 4:30 and 5:00am. I’ll get up, go to the computer, and check my email. Then I turn to my blog, The Daily Heller (Print Magazine). The day’s item usually launches automatically between 1:00 and 2:00am, so I’ll share it on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nWhen I’m in the mood, I’ll run across the street to the gym at around 6:00am. By anywhere from 7:15-7:45am, I’ve started walking to my work about a mile or two away. Once I get there, I write down whatever is due on that particular day, or work on answers to questions like these.\n\nTracy Chou · Entrepreneur, Diversity Advocate\n\nCaveat: I don’t have a very set routine!\n\nThat said, here is what a typical morning might look like: I wake up at 6:00am or 7:00am, before my alarm. From bed, while still groggy and with my phone close to my face because I’m nearsighted, I check for updates on email and all social apps—Twitter first, then Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. After I brush my teeth and put on my contacts so I can see, I eat breakfast. Meanwhile, I tell Alexa to play Spotify so I have some music to listen to as I get ready. After I’ve eaten, I do my makeup and hair, check the weather, and get dressed. Then I pack my gym bag, make my bed, and head out the door, while calling to Alexa to turn off the music.\n\nLeigh Martinuzzi · Blogger, Podcaster\n\nI endeavour to keep my bedtime and wake-up time regular. Currently, I’m in bed by 10:00pm and awake by 5:00am. The essential elements I include in my morning routine are e"
