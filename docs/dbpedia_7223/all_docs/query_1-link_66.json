        "text": "Ok it's making me crazy! I KNOW I've seen this person perform SOMEWHERE and I think it was on one of our Disney cruises. I even remember his puppets!!\n\nDoes anyone else remember seeing him?? (He's on Comedy Central right now. lol)\n\nAnyway, I think he might be a bit to \"racy\" for Disney tastes.\n\nIndeed, one of his routines recounts being on a cruise ship, and the guests being called upon to look over the sides for a missing passenger (\"Do we win a prize if we find him!?\"). I don't think Disney would go for that...\n\nHA! I was just having this conversation with my husband. I KNOW we saw him on one of our DCL cruises. And tonight he was on TV and my daughter got excited and yelled \"That's the guy from the Disney Boat\".\n\nAnd I especially remember Walter.\n\noh my Gosh!!!!!!\n\nIs there anyway to know if/when he would be on DCL again?\n\nI could get DH to go for a cruise rather quickly if we knew he was going to be onboard providing the entertainment. We love to watch his shows. He is hysterical.\n\nMy favorite is Peanut!\n\nBTW how long ago was he on DCL?\n\nHi Terry....I have wondered the same thing.\n\nMy DS loves him. He and some buddies saw him about a month ago locally. He'd love to go again.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving!\n\nHI there Dizzyworld. We're kinda neighbors!\n\nWe did your see him locally? I didn't see any advertisements for a show around here. Bummer....we probably would've gone to see him.\n\nI do think he used a tennis ball in his act too.\n\nI also remember the first time I saw him on TV. I thought I had seen him on DCl. It has been a few years since then, but I remember Walter and Peanut from the cruise. I doubt Achmed will ever do the cruise circuit. I can't imagine a puppet telling the guest \"I Kill you\" ever making it on DCL\n\nEpisode #18 - \"Hart to Hart\"\n\nSonny convinces Tawni to fire her overbearing manager, not realizing its Tawnis mother. When Tawni fires her mom as a manager, she also fires her mom as a mom. So Tawni goes to Sonny's house and has Sonny as her maid, which prompts Sonny and Connie to devise a plan to get Tawni and her mom back together. Meanwhile, Nico and Grady try to get past the new security guard Jeff's dummy Walter (who appears to have a mind of his own) so they can use Chad's private bathroom. Chad discovers this and Jeff later onfesses to using the bathroom because of Walter's fan devotion to Chad. So Random! Sketch:\n\n\"Dumb Blond\":Tawni is the only So Random! actor/actress seen reheasrsing this sketch. Tawni plays a dumb blond with her own television cooking show in this offensive sketch. Absent: Allisyn Ashley Arm as Zora Lancaster\n\nGuest Starring: Christina Moore as Tammi Hart, Nancy McKeon as Connie, Jeff Dunham as Jeff\n\nSaw this episode this past weekend with my 6 year old daughter.\n\nWe love Jeff Dunham!!!\n\nWe saw a guy on one of our Disney cruises that did the tennis ball act but it was not Jeff Dunham."
