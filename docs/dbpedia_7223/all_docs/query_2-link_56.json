        "text": "Harry & Meghan update… Travis Scott’s Astronomical… A message from Dr. Anthony Fauci… Demi Lovato gets candid… and Kristin Cavallari & Jay Cutler are getting a divorce\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle may have cut off all communication with the Daily Mail, but that doesn’t stop the Daily Mail from writing about them. The British tabloid claims that Harry and Meghan have given an interview for a book called Thoroughly Modern Royals: The Real World of Harry and Meghan. It’s being written by royal reporters, Carolyn Durand and Omid Scobie, whom I follow on Twitter per the recommendation of a KiddNation family member. Sources told the Daily Mail that Harry and Meghan gave an interview to Carolyn and Omid before they fled England. Omid is reportedly close to Meghan, so the book is expected to shed a real positive light on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, beginning with their courtship and give some inside scoop on the drama that led to Megxit. It’s expected to be released on August 11.\n\nThe quarantine worked in Travis Scott’s favor as more than 12.3M people logged in at the same time for his Fortnite concert, breaking the previous record of 10.7M set by Marshmello in February of last year. During the virtual performance, fans were treated to Travis’ new single, “The Scotts,” and they got two loading screens for free. They also got to watch Travis morph into a cyborg and a giant…there was a sequence inspired by Tron…gamers got to go underwater…They packed a lot into that 15 minutes! And Epic Games also added Travis to their Icon Series, so players can get his outfits, emotes, gear and whatever else y’all get when you play Fortnite.\n\nRemember when Dr. Fauci was asked who he’d like to play him in a “Saturday Night Live” skit and he said Brad Pitt? Well, Dr. Fauci, your wish has come true! SNL had another go at a live quarantine edition this weekend, and Brad opened the show as Dr. Fauci. He then took a moment to thank Dr. Fauci and all the healthcare workers before announcing, “Live, kinda, from all across America, it’s Saturday night!!” Among the other celebrities popping up in skits were Adam Sandler, Paul Rudd, Jason Sudeikis, Charles Barkley and DJ Khaled. Miley Cyrus was the musical guest.\n\nDemi Lovato and the cast of “Sonny with a Chance” reunited for a virtual chat that was posted on Saturday. Right out of the gate, Allisyn Ashley Arm — who played Zora Lancaster — asked what everyone had been up to. Demi said, “I went to rehab…Several times!” Demi was 19 when left the show at the end of its second season to get treatment for “physical and emotional issues.” The rest of the cast continued in the spinoff, “So Random!” Demi told Tiffany Thornton — who played Tawni Hart in both shows — that she was her biggest inspiration during that time. Demi also said she didn’t expect the show to go on without her but she was happy it did. She also said she would love to reunite with the cast for a new project.\n\nKristin Cavallari and Jay Cutler have announced they’re getting a divorce. A source told “Us Weekly” that they actually filed on Friday before making the announcement Sunday. Kristen and Jay were actually introduced by Giuliana Rancic back in 2010 and started dating shortly after that. He proposed a year later, but after 3 months, Kristin called off the wedding because she didn’t think Jay was ready for that kind of commitment. But later that year, they got back together, got married and had 3 kids. But yesterday they made identical announcements on their Instagrams, “With great sadness, after 10 years together we have come to a loving conclusion to get a divorce….”"
