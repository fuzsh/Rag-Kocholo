        "text": "Meeting the cast of Camp Rock\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nCamp Rock 2 was a Disney Channel Original Movie that was a sequel to Camp Rock. It premiered on the Disney Channel on September 3, 2010.\n\nMitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) returns to Camp Rock with her mother Connie (Maria Canals-Barrera) for another year of summer camp. A rival camp called Camp Star was opened by a old friend of Camp Rack’s owner. Luke Williams (Matthew Finley , MDot) is the most talented performer of Camp Star. He is kind of the leader. He sings Fire at the bonfire when both camps come together. Many counselors and campers leave Camp Rock to go to Camp Star. The Jonas Brothers return as members of a band called Connect 3. When we first meet them, their tour bus has a flat tire and their bus driver Oliver (Big Rob) is trying to fix it. It rolls down a hill and the boys make it to the camp in a truck full of chickens. Chloe Bridges plays Dana the daughter of Camp Star’s owner. Nate (Nick Jonas) falls in love with her and sings Introducing Me to prove he really does love her and can share his thoughts with her! Roshon Fegan and Jordin Francis play Sander and Barron, two talented friends who like hip hop. Tess (Meaghan Martin) decides to go to Camp Star. At the Final Jam, she and Luke Sing “Tear it Down” Frankie Jonas plays Trevor. He takes video of the camp at that video is used at Final Jam when Camp Rock plays What We Came Here For.\n\nThere is a lot of funny parts in Camp Rock 2. There was also a lot of cool songs. At the end, there is a show down between the camps!\n\nI was lucky enough to go to a screening of Camp Rock 2 a few months before it was on TV. We went to the Disney Studios and watched it there. After we met Paul Hoen and a few other people who made the movie. That was cool. They didn’t let us take cameras in but that’s where the pic above was taken.\n\nDemi Lovato plays Mitchie Torres. I met her at a free concert in Glendale. She signed my Friends For Change Poster and was really sweet. She tried to meet a whole lot of fans that day, so I only saw her for a little while.\n\nI haven’t officially met the Jonas Brothers but I went to and their Burn It Up tour, the Road Dogs Game and and The Camp Rock 2 tour in September 2010. I had front row seats so I really enjoyed the concert. I met Ashley Greene there. We went to the bathroom and when we came back, she was in our seat! I took a pic bit it doesn’t really belong here.\n\nSome of the Cast of Camp Rock\n\nDemi and Joe singing Wouldn’t Change a Thing\n\nI’ve met many members of the cast at different events, screenings, premieres, and charities. They have all been nice. I hope you follow them all on Twitter and follow @CR2News .. they are huge supporters of the movie and members of the cast!\n\nMarie Canals-Barrera before the concert\n\nMaria also plays Theresa, the mom on Wizards of Waverly Place. She is married to David Barrera and have two little girls. She is very nice and helps charities and her daughters’ school. She even did a book reading at a local book store and invited her fans to come down to meet her.\n\nFollow her on Twitter at @Maria_CB\n\nAlyson Stoner at the Step-Up 3D Premiere\n\nI’ve met Alyson about 7 times. She is an awesome dancer and loves to support her friends and charities. She went to Shane Harper’ s concert at the Roxy. She was also at the premiere of Jake T. Austin’s movie The Perfect Game. She attended Debby Ryan’s 16 Wishes premiere and she played basketball with the Hollywood Knights. I met her at these events and a couple of charity events too. She is SOOOOOOO sweet.\n\nFollow her at @AlysonOnTour\n\nRoshon Fegan at 16 Wishes Premiere\n\nRoshon was great in Camp Rock but he is even more amazing as Ty in Shake it Up. He is 18 and I’ve met him a couple of times at premieres and at tapings. He is very nice and sweet and super talented.\n\nFollow him at @YaBoyRo\n\nChloe Bridges at 16 Wishes Premiere\n\nChloe Bridges at a charity event in LA\n\nChloe starred in Legally Blondes with Britanny Curran and was Dana in CR2. A lot of people wished that Nick was singing to them instead of her!\n\nI’ve met her at a premiere and a charity. She was very nice to me and my friends.\n\nHer Twitter is @ChloeBridges\n\nMDot at a charity event in Hollywood\n\nMatthew Finley , MDot plays Luke Williams. He is so talented and sweet. I wrote a whole blog just for him. Please check it out!\n\nHis Twitter is @4MDot please follow him.\n\nMeaghan Martin\n\nI only met Meaghan who plays Tess one time. She was very nice.\n\nHer Twitter is @EtteJNahgaem\n\nI loved the movie! I think Demi and the Jonas Brothers are great together. I loved all the supporting cast and I hope they all have a lot of success in their lives and their careers.\n\nI hope you liked this Blog, my mom and I worked hard on it!\n\nFollow me on Twitter at @AlexiRob\n\nCheck my pics of another stars on Flickr http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexirob/\n\nPlease share this with friends ..\n\nThanks\n\nMeeting Joey King\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nJoey King was born in Las Vegas on July 30, 1999. Her older sisters Haley and Kelli are also actresses. She was named after her grandfather Joseph. Her first commercial was for Life cereal at age 4. Since then, she has been in over 100 commercials. She has also done voice overs in Ice Age, Dawn of the Dinosaurs and Horton Hears a Who. Her first movie was called Grace. She had to act like she was drowning in the ocean. She really enjoyed the experience and was hooked on acting ever since. She was in a movie called Quarantine and got to walk the red carpet at the premiere. She really enjoyed that experience. She also worked on a movie called Battle Los Angeles where she plays a girl named Kirsten. Lucas Till is also in this movie. It should be in theaters on March 11, 2011.\n\nI’ve met Joey at premieres a meet and greet and at charity events. Her mom says that if Joey had a choice between going to an awards show, a party or doing charity work, she would do the charity work. She really loves helping kids who are sick and she went to a children’s hospital for a screening of Ramona and Beezus. I met her at an event for Children’s Hospital Orange County. Her mom told my mom that Joey really wanted to help St. Jude’s hospital with their fund raiser. The day before Ariana Grande served as a waitress and people colored a Chili’s coloring sheet and donated a dollar to St Jude’s. ( We were there that day and wrote a blog) The next day, Joey went to Chili’s restaurant to help. Because she is so young they didn’t let her serve food but she still helped by getting people to donate money.\n\nThis picture was taken at the premiere of Debby Ryan’s movie 16 wishes!\n\nThis picture was taken t the premiere of Jake T Austin’s movie called, The Perfect Game. Moises Arias and Ryan Ochoa also starred in this movie. The t-shirt Joey is wearing was made for her with a picture from the movie on it!\n\nThis picture was from a charity event in the San Fernando Valley called Habitat for Humanity.

She is very loving and offers “Free Hugs”.\n\nOnce she tweeted that she would be at a charity event in Hollywood. We live near there so my mom said we could go. WooHoo! When we got there we found out it was a fund raiser and tickets cost $150 each! My mom talked to the ticket lady and explained we only wanted to see Ari..So the lady let us both go for $150. That’s a lot of money but my mom loves to support charities and I REALLY wanted to meet Ariana. We listened to a lot of awesome singers from Broadway sing that night. We met Matt Doyle, Tom Link and also met the actor who played Sebastian from Little Mermaid!\n\nAriana was awesome. She sang “Beautiful” and one other song. The crowd LOVED her! After, we went up to her. She was with her mom. They were super nice and we got an autograph and lots of pictures. We ran into her again out in the lobby. We told her how much we loved her on Victorious. Her voice in real life is different from Cat’s. She explained that has 3 voices, her “Cat” voice, her “real” voice and her singing voice.\n\nIn September, she tweeted that she would be at an event at the Santa Monica Pier. It was a charity for the earth called Roots and Shoots. It was the same day as the Jonas Brothers’ Road Dogs Game. We went and waited but had to leave to get to the game before she got there.

When we arrived there were a few friends we knew from Twitter. We all sat together and soon Ariana arrived to serve us.

Ariana spent a lot of time at our table and even sang Happy Birthday to someone at our table!\n\nDAN SCHNEIDER\n\nERIK LANGE\n\nDaniella Monet ME Ariana Grande\n\nI think it was really cool of the Dan, Erik and Daniella to come out and be so nice to their fans and support Ariana and this awesome charity.\n\nMy mom tweeted that the “Free Hug” I got at the Broadway event cost her $150. She never thought Ariana would actually see that tweet but she did. Ariana is such a cool person that she thought that it was pretty funny. She also gave me a shout out n Twitter and talked about me in a chat!\n\nI hope we see Ariana Grande again soon!\n\nI have met other members of the cast too:\n\nI met both Avan and Victoria Justice at the Teen Choice Awards.

My mom said we could take the day off of school go to the concert, spend the night in O.C. go to Disneyland the next day since we had a pass! The concert was great! I loved the hotel and the next morning, we headed off to Disneyland. When we went into It’s a Small World it was cloudy. When we came out it was raining. We had parkas but Disneyland in the rain isn’t too fun. I told my mom I wanted to go home. It was only like 1 o’clock so it was kind of a bummer. We got home by about 3:00. I went to my room and was hanging out in my room. About an hour later my mom bursts through my door and says, “Do you want to meet Selena Gomez?” I was like “sure”! So, I put on a Selena Gomez Wizards of Waverley Place shirt and we ran to the car. My mom said that she got on Twitter and found out that Selena had been tweeting that she was going to do a signing with her and the Scene at a secret place in the San Fernando Valley. Every so often, she gave a new clue.. like it’s in the valley, it has a yummy treat, Finally at 4:00 exactly she tweeted Menchies and the address:\n\nSelena and the Scene were going to give the first 100 people tickets to their first ever concert at the Roxy. She planned to stay as late as possible to meet as many fans as she could. We drove as fast as it was safe to. When we got there it was crazy! A line was forming outside and people were trying to find parking. My mom and I got there and I had a poster I made for Selena if I ever met her. It was always in the car. People were a little suprised that I was so prepared with my T shirt and my poster.\n\nPaparazzi were across the street and soon the line began moving fast. People were coming out with signed pink cards and tickets. We just missed the cut off for tickets but I still got to meet her and the guys!\n\nWe went down some stairs. The security made my mom put her camera away. Selena looked up at me and said, “I like your glasses.” I gave her the poster. She smiled and got up and gave me a hug and a kiss! You can see her lipstick on my cheek in the picture above. She stayed really late and met about 500 fans that day!\n\nSelena Gomez is one of the nicest celebs I’ve met. I’ve seen her in concert at the House of Blues in Anahiem, the LA County fair and I went to a CD signing at the Southcoast Plaza, We waited about 7 hours to meet her that day. She was so sweet again meeting as many people as possible and staying much later than she had to. She recently had a concert at the Roxy. Tickets were $150.00 and included a meet and greet. We couldn’t afford to get tickets but we went down anyway hoping to see her on the way out! Some of our friends from Twitter were hanging around outside. Someone who worked at the Roxy saw me and brought me and some of my friends in to see the concert! It was great! Selena even brought a little girl on stage to sing a Year Without Rain with her!\n\nSelena really is an amazing person! I feel lucky to have met her twice and seen her in concert 3 times!\n\nI have more pics on my Flickr and Twitpic\n\nI hope you enjoyed my story\n\nI’m on Twitter @alexirob\n\nMeeting stars and supporting them, their charities, and their projects is my hobby!\n\nMeeting Justin Bieber Never say Never Screening\n\nMy Fan Encounter 11/19/09\n\nI met Justin Beiber on November 19, 2009 at Universal Citywalk in Los Angeles. The first 500 people who pre ordered his My World CD about a month before then received wristbands and were able to get their CD’s autographed following a free concert. My mom and I lined up at 4am and waited until the store opened. We were all alone in front of that store for hours.. finally a few other fans lined up behind us.. We pre-ordered 3 Cd’s for $10.00. We invited my friends at school to join us but no one was interested. November 19th finally arrived and we tried to sell our 2 extra CD’s to people. I guess people thought we were tricking them and it took a while for people to buy them from us so we didn’t lose any money. The 500 people who pre ordered th CD’s were allowed to enter a blocked off area in front of the stage and by the time Justin did take the stage 1000’s of screaming fans were packed in the surrounding area. There were several warnings to back up because the fans in the very front were being pushed into barricades. Justin came out and also asked fans to back up saying that fans in the front were getting “squished”. After the last song all the fans tried to rush the stage but only the 500 with wristbands were allowed to go on stage and get thier CD autographed. The people were saying we had to put our cameras away but my mm got pretty up[set since we were the FIRST people to pre oder the CD. So one of the workers took my mom’s camera took the picture above and Justin signed my CD. When he saw my shirt, he said “I like you shirt! You’re awesome” and he gave me a high five!\n\nNever Say Never 3D\n\nOne year later, Justin has written a biography, performed all over the world and filmed an amazing 3D Movie called Never Say Never 3D\n\nMy mom and I were invited to a screening at the Paramount Studios Lot. We aren’t famous and we don’t know anyone who worked on the film. We just got invited from an E-mail to Girl Scout troops. I also saw some recruiters outside of a theatre in Burbank. We weren’t sure it was Never say Never 3D but the paper said, “You are invited to a private screening of a highly anticipated Musical 3D movie.\n\nWell, we arrived at the lot early and a long line had already formed. We were given a survey asking our ages and what shows we’ve seen and what musical artists we liked! Soon we were led on the lot and offered popcorn and water! Once the theater was full a man came to the front and said, “Thank You for coming. You are the first people in the world to be able to watch Justin Beiber’s Never Say Never 3D! The crowd applauded as many had already guessed correctly that this was the movie we’d see.\n\nThe movie starts out with You Tube clips of baby animals sneezing and babies laughing, then a video of one of Justin’s early performances played. We next see Justin backstage at Madison Square Gardens preparing to take the stage. We then go back to 10 days before and the movie follows Justin and his incredible team as they handle the ups and downs of those 10 days. Often baby pics and video clips of his early days were played as well. We learn about his mom having him as a teenager, his dad leaving them when Justin was 10 months old and how Justin began to play drums and sing at a very young age. We saw his grandparents interviewed and how important they were helping raise Justin.\n\nThe fan clips were so funny! Before concerts, the film crew would pull some fans aside and film them talking about Justin Beiber. One amazing thing that was covered was how before shows 20-30 tickets were held back and Scooter and Patty or others would go out and find fans without tickets and surprise them with great seats. Also, we saw the girls who were pulled on stage during “One Less Lonely Girl”.\n\nThere were several clips of Justin singing with other singers, Miley Cyrus, Boys II Men, Usher, Jaden Smith, Ludicris, etc.\n\nWe meet his voice coach who has a huge role in his life. We also see how Scooter Braun discovered him on You Tube and did everything he had to do to get Justin to the USA to launch his career. Radio stations and record labels weren’t interested in him and they had to work hard to get his music played on the radio! His first concert was in front of 40 fans at a water park in the rain! You see Kenny his body guard, his stylist, and his friends from Canada.\n\nYou get the sense that Justin has a team of caring committed people that are going to keep him grounded, humble, and healthy. The team prays before each performance. The one time Justin had to cancel a show due to poor health, you see how upset he is to disappoint his fans and how his “team” tries to help him cope!\n\nThe special 3D effects are amazing. You see every freckle and zit on each fan and at one point Justin stands in front of a screen and flips his hair. It’s so amazing and high definition!\n\nThis movie is very fun and enjoyable. It has a great mix of documentary, music and humor!\n\nGo see it in February!\n\nTips for Spotting Celebrity Posers on Twitter\n\nTwitter is an awesome way to feel connected and close to their favorite celebrities on Twitter! Anyone can open an account on Twitter and pose as a celebrity. Posers can use pictures found online, link You Tube and fan accounts, and trick lots of people!\n\nTwitter does have a system to verify celebrity accounts and you will see a blue circle with a check mark if an account is verified.(There is also a fake one of these too. Check a real verified account like Justin Bieber so you know what a real one looks like) From what I’ve read, celebs need to have a lot of followers and a lot of posers and file to get verified status. This takes a while. In the meantime, posers pop up. Followers feel honored and excited to get a reply, RT, or follow by someone they think is a celebrity. You have to do a little research and use common sense to spot Twitter posers! Many posers pose as child celebrities because they know many followers will be young people. I have over 1000 followers on Twitter and I know a bunch of my followers are following posers! I really want to help you guys out and get posers exposed! These people are obviously lonely and bored. I kind of feel sorry for them but what they are doing is WRONG!!!\n\nYou may wonder how we know so much. It’s because when we meet them we ask!\n\nAlexirob’s 10 Tips to Spot a Celebrity Poser\n\n1. People who should be following them, aren’t! If the star is a child or part of a cast are the parents or cast mates following them? Carolina Sunshine had a poser yet none of the Shake It Up cast was following her!\n\n2. Posers often ask for shout outs or follows from other celebrities. Real celebs DON’T do this!\n\n3. Posers only post pics that are found easily on other websites like Just Jared or Ocean Up. Real celebs stars post funny pics from set or just candid pics of their everyday lives like their snack or pet!\n\n4. Posers often mess up and confuse their lives and the celeb their posing as. One asked for shout outs on her real birthday (not the celeb’s)\n\n5. Posers Tweet and reply a LOT. Real celebs have super busy lives and come on Twitter every so often and then only for a while.\n\n6. I find that if you look at whose following them or who they follow you’ll see a lot of posers on both lists.\n\n7. They tweet other child stars that aren’t following them. A Noah poser was tweeting Madison De La Garza, Emily Grace, and others, but they wern’t following her.\n\n8. Their Twitter name is really close to the celebs but they double a letter or switch 2 letters like “ie” or “ei” or switch an “i” and an “l”\n\n9. Try to expose other posers who are posing as the same celeb.\n\n10. They say that there account is “secret” just for fans.. that’s why their family or cast isn’t following.\n\n11. A Twitter follower added that the real celeb has more followers! If you look at a few accounts that are supposed to be for a celeb the one with the most followers is almost always the real one. I have to say though that some celebs are very shy. Carline Sunshine’s posers have more followers than her real account!\n\nSTARS THAT HAVE NO TWITTER as of 2/5/11\n\nHailee Steinfeld\n\nDakota & Elle Fanning\n\nAvalon Robbins\n\nStars That Have Very Successful or a lot of Posers\n\nSterling Knight-real @sterlingknight\n\nEmily Grace- real @EmilyGraceEms\n\nCaroline Sunshine real- @4castisSunshine\n\nKenton Duty real- @Kentonjduty\n\nNoah Cyrus real – @ForevsNoahCyrus\n\nLeo Howard real @IamLeoHoward\n\nBailee Madison real @BaileeMadison\n\nI hope this helps!
