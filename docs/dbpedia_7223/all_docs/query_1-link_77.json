        "text": "Sonny with a Chance is an American sitcom created by Steve Marmel which aired for two seasons on Disney Channel from February 8, 2009 to January 2, 2011. The series follows the experiences of teenager Sonny Munroe, portrayed by Demi Lovato, who becomes the newest accepted cast member of her favorite live comedy television show, So Random!.\n\nContents\n\nDemi lovato s big break audition sonny with a chance disney channel\n\nCharacters\n\nProduction\n\nCritical reception\n\nDemi Lovatos departure and So Random\n\nSo Random\n\nMackenzie Falls\n\nTheme song and opening sequence\n\nVideo game\n\nSoundtrack\n\nComplete seasons\n\nSeason 1\n\nSeason 2\n\nReferences\n\nThe series debuted on February 8, 2009, in the United States. This is the first Disney Channel Original Series to be shot and aired in high-definition from the beginning. Like most of Disney Channel's sitcoms, it is shot on tape but uses a \"filmized\" appearance. The second season, some scenes are shot on location. The series is one of the three Disney Channel Original Series to feature a show-within-a-show, along with The Famous Jett Jackson and Shake It Up. On June 1, 2009, TV Guide reported that Disney Channel had renewed Sonny with a Chance for a second season, with Gary Marsh saying \"Sonny was a hit right out of the gate\". The second season premiered on March 14, 2010 to 6.3 million viewers, and was reportedly cancelled over a year later on April 19, 2011 following Lovato's official departure announcement and Disney Channel's decision to rebrand the series.\n\nDisney Channel originally renewed the series for a third season on November 12, 2010, but Lovato's role was at an uncertainty at the time after she checked into treatment two weeks prior. No word on whether Lovato would return to her role had been said, and production on the season carried out as planned in January 2011 without Lovato, focusing on the So Random! aspect rather than behind the scenes. An official name change to So Random! was announced on April 4, 2011, and later that month Lovato announced that she would not be returning to her role as Sonny Munroe, putting an end to Sonny with a Chance. So Random! premiered on Disney Channel on June 5, 2011 to an audience of 4.1 million viewers, but ratings soon dropped and the series was cancelled after a 26-episode first season.\n\nCharacters\n\nDemi Lovato as Allison \"Sonny\" Munroe\n\nTiffany Thornton as Tawni Hart\n\nSterling Knight as Chad Dylan Cooper\n\nBrandon Mychal Smith as Nico Harris\n\nDoug Brochu as Grady Mitchell\n\nAllisyn Ashley Arm as Zora Lancaster\n\nProduction\n\nThe original working title for the series was Sketchpad!, and the original name for the main character was Molly Munroe. The show's title was later changed to Welcome to Mollywood. After the first publicity materials about the show were released, the lead character's name was then changed to Holli and the title changed once again to Welcome to Holliwood. The main character's name was later changed to Sonny Munroe, and the show's title was changed for a final time to Sonny with a Chance. The name is a play on the words \"Sunny with a chance of rain\", as heard in weather forecasts, reflecting the many comical situations in which the cast find themselves in each episode. Originally Lovato auditioned with Bridgit Mendler for the role, but Lovato was chosen.\n\nSonny with a Chance has a show-within-a-show, So Random!, complete with fully produced sketches. The show's executive producer Brian Robbins previously wrote for and served as an executive producer on the real-life kids sketch comedy series All That and The Amanda Show for Nickelodeon.\n\nGary Marsh, president of entertainment, Disney Channel Worldwide, stated \"This series is rooted in one of the core thematic attributes that we stand for, which is following your dreams, there also was the opportunity to do a hybrid show.\" The show began production on September 15, 2008 and the first season was taped at Stage 11 at NBC Studios in Burbank, California; for the second season, the show's production moved to Hollywood Center Studios in Hollywood, California, where The Suite Life on Deck, Wizards of Waverly Place and Jonas are also filmed.\n\nCritical reception\n\nCurrently the most watched episode of the series is \"Walk a Mile in My Pants\" with 6.3 million viewers. The episode \"Gassie Passes\" is the least watched episode, scoring 2.9 million viewers.\n\nDemi Lovato's departure and So Random!\n\nIt was announced on November 12, 2010 that the third season would begin production without Lovato, due to her recovering from health issues. The series would now focus on the sketch/comedy/music-variety show So Random!, centering on guest stars, sketches, digital shorts, and musical performances, a similar format to Saturday Night Live, but targeted at a much younger audience. Production of the third season began on January 30, 2011.\n\nOn April 19, 2011, People.com reported that Demi Lovato would not be returning for the third season. As a result, the show would be renamed So Random! and focus only on the sketches rather than the behind-the-scenes antics. As a result of Lovato's departure from Sonny with a Chance, the series is the second Disney Channel original series to have its lead actor/actress leave during the series' run (after So Weird), and the fourth Disney Channel series to have a main cast member leave the series during its run (with That's So Raven and Jonas also included).\n\nThe third season was then turned into its own new series based on its new format.\n\nSo Random!\n\nSo Random! is a comedy sketch series that employs most of the main cast. It often causes the cast of Sonny with a Chance to dress in ridiculous costumes, and act out nonsensical situations. This was spun-off to its own series after Lovato's departure.\n\nMackenzie Falls\n\nThe enemies of the So Random! group, Mackenzie Falls is a tween drama series featuring comedic overacting. The show is similar to Dawson's Creek and Gossip Girl, among others. The show's name, Mackenzie Falls, comes from Chad's character's name and the name of the town (which is located near a waterfall). In the season two episode \"The Legend of Candy Face\", the cast of So Random! made a parody of Mackenzie Falls titled Mackenzie Stalls, which was set in a bathroom. Minisodes and promos can be seen on the Sonny with a Chance website.\n\nTheme song and opening sequence\n\nThe show's theme song \"So Far, So Great\", was written and produced by Jeanne Lurie, Chen Neeman and Aristedis \"Aris\" Archontis, who have each written songs for several artists on Disney-owned Hollywood Records. It is performed by series actress Demi Lovato. The theme is of pop-rock style (the music cues composed by Chris Alan Lee and Scott Clausen, signaling scene changes and commercial breaks are styled similarly).\n\nA full-length version of this theme was released via the Radio Disney network on March 31, 2009, less than two months after the show's U.S. premiere. The theme song is also featured as a track on the Disney compilation album, Disney Channel Playlist, released by Walt Disney Records on June 9, 2009. The song is also available as the bonus track on Lovato's second album Here We Go Again, released by Hollywood Records on July 21, 2009.\n\nIn the Russian version of the series (\"Дайте Санни шанс\" aka Give Sonny a Chance), the cast member's names are rendered in Cyrillic—and the intro is performed by a different Russian girl in Russian (not by Demi Lovato). Otherwise, in translation the intro music is not changed.\n\nIn the Brazilian Portuguese version (\"Sunny Entre Estrelas\"), the intro music is sung in translation.\n\nVideo game\n\nSonny with a Chance is a video game published by Disney Interactive Studios for the Nintendo DS. It was released on March 16, 2010 in America.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on October 5, 2010. It was preceded by the single \"Me, Myself and Time\", was released on August 3, 2010.\n\nComplete seasons\n\nThe complete first season was released on May 7, 2010 in Poland and Mexico, and on August 26, 2010 in Germany.\n\nSeason 1\n\nThe series originally premiered on February 8, 2009 on Disney Channel, Family Channel, and Disney Channel (UK and Ireland). In Australia it premiered on April 27, 2009 on Disney Channel and on February 13, 2010 on Seven Network. In New Zealand the series premiered on April 27, 2009 on Disney Channel and on August 15, 2010 on TV2. The series started airing on May 22, 2009 on Disney Channel (India), on September 5, 2009 on Disney Channel (Europe, Middle East and Africa), and on October 17, 2009 on Disney Channel (Southeast Asia).\n\nSeason 2\n\nThe second season originally premiered on March 14, 2010. It premiered on April 5, 2010 in Canada and on April 23, 2010 in the UK and Ireland. In New Zealand it premiered on May 10, 2010 on Disney Channel.
