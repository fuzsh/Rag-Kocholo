Snyder also voiced the character Stormy in the Disney Junior series Jake and the Never Land Pirates. Regarding her roles, she told People (magazine), \"I watch a lot of SNL skits online. I love Chris Farley and Jim Carrey. I always think, 'What would Jim Carrey do in this scene?' He's a lot of my inspiration for my character (Zora).\"[10]\n\nIn 2014, Snyder developed a YouTube personality named Astrid Clover. The web series ran for 7 years, with more than 350 episodes.[11]"
