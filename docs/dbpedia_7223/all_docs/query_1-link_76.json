(stylized as SO R@n:D0ᴟ!) is an American Disney Channel sketch comedy series that premiered on June 5, 2011. It was announced as an independent series after Demi Lovato left the parent series, Sonny with a Chance.[1] The series stars the other actors of Sonny with a Chance: Tiffany Thornton, Sterling Knight, Brandon Mychal Smith, Doug Brochu and Allisyn Ashley Arm as well as other featured actors that recur in the series. The series premiere was watched by 4.1 million viewers.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Concept, production and premise\n\n2 Cast\n\n2.1 Main cast\n\n2.2 Recurring characters\n\n2.3 Guest stars and artists\n\n3 Episodes\n\n4 Release\n\n4.1 Critical reception\n\n5 Music\n\n6 International release\n\n7 See also\n\n8 References\n\n9 External links\n\nConcept, production and premise\n\nIn Sonny with a Chance, Demi Lovato plays the title character, Sonny Munroe, a new member of the cast of the sketch comedy show So Random!, which is presented as a show-within-a-show. The series follows the experiences of Sonny, and the rest of the cast. The full length sketch comedy episode format was played within Sonny with a Chance during season 2 of the series for the Christmas and Halloween episodes. In October 2010, Lovato underwent treatment for \"physical and emotional issues,\" and in April 2011 she confirmed that she would not be returning to Sonny with a Chance for its third season.[3] She stated that returning to acting immediately wouldn't be healthy for her recovery.[4]\n\nFollowing Lovato's departure from the series, So Random! was introduced as its own series that will focus more on comedy skits than Sonny with a Chance. Filming for the season began on January 30, 2011.[5] Each episode will feature sketch comedy skits with the So Random! cast, as well as a musical performance by a guest star. Originally intended to be a third season of Sonny with a Chance, Disney began to describe the show as a separate series following Lovato's confirmed departure.[1]\n\nEach episode typically consists of five or six sketches. Though it is formatted as a sketch comedy series, So Random! retains the fictional universe style of the sitcom it spun off from, with the main cast members playing both the characters they originated on Sonny with a Chance, in addition to playing the characters appearing in each of the sketches; in addition, each episode is typically written by two writers (whereas opening segments and sketches in a traditional sketch comedy series are written by a team of up to twelve writers).\n\nCast\n\nMain cast\n\nExcept for Lovato, the main cast of So Random! is identical to that of its parent series, Sonny with a Chance.[6]\n\nTiffany Thornton as Tawni Hart, who likes to be the center of attention.\n\nSterling Knight as Chad Dylan Cooper.
