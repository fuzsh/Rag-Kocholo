        "text": "Allisyn Snyder was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and has been steadily working in the entertainment industry for 21 years as an actress. She is well-known as the mousy high school-er, Heather, on the NBC show “A.P. Bio,” and for her series regular role of Zora in the hit Disney shows “Sonny with a Chance” and “So Random.” Allisyn was always fascinated by the directors' work, and yearned to one day express her artistic creativity through that channel. She graduated at age 15 and began studying cinematography at Glendale Community College. In 2014, she developed a YouTube personality named Astrid Clover and has produced over 350 episodes of the web series which has a loyal following. Allisyn started producing films in 2016 alongside her now-husband, Dylan Snyder, forming Watch The Footage (WTF) Productions with producer Bob Morrison, and fellow filmmaker Bryan Morrison. Several WTF shorts have gained distribution through Fun Size Horror (FSH) and can be found on Amazon as part of FSH's Shocktale Party series. Snyder's short films have received accolades at over 30 festivals, including Independent Shorts Awards where she was awarded the Platinum Award for Best Director (Female) in 2019 for her work on \"Nasty Habits.\"\n\nBryan Morrison is an editor and cinematographer originally from Frederick, Maryland. Morrison started to produce his own films as a teenager, and after graduating, enrolled in the University of North Carolina School of the Arts filmmaking program with a concentration in Picture Editing and Sound Design. In 2016, he visited Los Angeles over the summer to work on “Strangers,” a short film written and directed by Allisyn Snyder. Morrison and Snyders's working synergies were immediately evident, and their shared passion for filmmaking quickly developed into a tradition, with him flying out every summer to work with Allisyn and her small crew. In 2018, he graduated UNCSA and moved to Los Angeles permanently to follow his dreams. Some of Morrison’s credits include “Dead Leaf Butterfly” (2018), “Roaches 2: The Rescue” (2018), “It’s Just A Story” (2017), “Your Mother’s A Whore!” (2017), and “Weeji” (2017). Morrison won the Silver Award for Best Editing in Independent Shorts Awards 2019 for his work on \"Nasty Habits.\"\n\nDylan Snyder co-manages Watch The Footage Productions and has experience in many departments. He’s worked as a 1st A.D. in three Watch The Footage films, and had his directing debut in 2018 on “Dead Leaf Butterfly,” where he won International Independent Film Awards Silver Winner for Best Director. Snyder also has an extensive acting resume and is recognizable from his work on Disney XD’s hit series “Kickin’ It.” Beginning his acting career in community theatre at the age of four, Snyder is known for his acting, singing, and dancing abilities, starring as Young Tarzan in the 2006 Broadway musical, “Tarzan,” and as Timmy in the 2009 feature film, “Life During Wartime.” He recently starred in films “Flock of Flour” and “Crabs,” and co-starred in the season 3 premiere of “Better Call Saul.” Snyder took home Best Director (Male) at Indie Short Fest 2020 for his work on “Room 566,” which was also awarded Best Horror Short.\n\nJoey Luthman is an actor and filmmaker out of Los Angeles, California, well known for his work on “Weeds,” “Kickin’ It,” “How To Rock,” “The Goldbergs,” “General Hospital,” “Long Road Home,” and much more. Growing up as a child actor with consistent work, Luthman decided to pursue a career behind the camera and enrolled in Glendale College for cinematography and editing, inspired by Ron Howard’s transition from acting into directing. Luthman was the Director of Photography on the short film “Dead Leaf Butterfly” (2018) which he co-wrote, and was the Silver Winner at International Independent Film Awards for Cinematography.\n\nBob Morrison A career banker, Bob was lured into the film industry by his son Bryan, who developed an early passion for the art of cinema. In 2012, Bob and Bryan met Disney Channel actor, Allisyn Snyder (then Allisyn Ashley Arm), at a charity event in their Maryland hometown. With a passion for mentoring and helping talented youth develop their fledgling careers, Bob kept in touch and readily agreed to serve as their producer. In 2015, Bob flew his son out to Los Angeles to facilitate his first short film, alongside Allisyn Snyder. Over the next several years, Bob produced a bevy of short films, each with increasing complexity, effects, length, experienced cast, and budget, with many picked up for distribution via Fun Size Horror. Bob co-founded Watch The Footage (WTF) Productions, helping a young aspiring female filmmaker and visionary launch and manage her own production company."
