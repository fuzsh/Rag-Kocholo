        "text": "Sonny With A Chance (2010)\n\nAlready well on her way to stardom, Demi Lovato starred in the Disney Channel series Sonny With A Chance. One unique aspect of the show (which actually spawned its own series) was that Demi’s character, Sonny Munroe, appeared on a show within the show called So Random!. That “show” was a sketch comedy series that featured an outstanding cast of young comedic actors that I’ll get to in a minute.\n\nIn Sonny‘s second season, a So Random! Halloween special was shown with Shaquille O’Neal as the special guest host and music from Lovato (as Sonny) Brandon Mychal Smith (as Nico), and Allstar Weekend.\n\nThe episode features sketches that include the Check-It-Out Girls, The Monster Under My Bed, Halloween Party Do’s and Don’t’s, and a comedic song, Making Babies Cry. Between skits, the cast is shown backstage in a couple of humorous moments featuring Shaquille O’Neal dealing with the anxiety of performing in front of a crowd and being helped by Chad Dylan Cooper (Sterling Knight).\n\nOf all of the Disney Channel shows that I watched with my daughter while she was growing up, Sonny was one of my favorites. So Random! became its own series and it was enjoyable as well. Both shows had the same key cast members with the exception of Lovato, who moved on for health reasons before the third season of Sonny, which became the first and only season of So Random!, went into production.\n\nThis particular episode is light, funny, and not scary at all. The comedy is solid, especially for a children’s show, and is anchored by the solid performances of Lovato, Tiffany Thornton, Doug Brochu, Brandon Mychal Smith, and Allisyn Ashley Arm. Knight’s brief appearance as Chad is funny and O’Neal does a great job poking fun at himself and performing in the skits.\n\nIf you have younger children and want to give them something to laugh at without scaring them at all, check out this episode of Sonny With A Chance. It’s available on home media and on Disney+ at the moment.\n\nThanks for reading my post. I’ll have another for you tomorrow!"
