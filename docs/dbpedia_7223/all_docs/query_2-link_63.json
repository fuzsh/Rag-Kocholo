        "text": "2\n\nposted by Selena_01\n\nSonny With a Chance is a Disney Channel original comedy television series, created by Steve Marmel, that follows the experiences of teenager Sonny Munroe, portrayed by Demi Lovato, who becomes the newest cast member of her favorite live comedy show, So Random!. The series debuted on February 8, 2009 in the United States. This is the first Disney Channel Original Series to be shot and aired in high-definition from the beginning; like most of Disney Channel's sitcoms, it is shot on tape, but utilizes a 'filmized' appearance.[2]\n\nCharacters\n\nMain characters\n\nDemi Lovato as Allison \"Sonny\" Munroe [3] - A friendly, sweet teen from Wisconsin who landed a role on her favorite TV show, So Random! and excitedly went to star in it. She also has an on and off love/hate relationship with Chad.\n\nTiffany Thornton as Tawni Hart - A main cast member of So Random! who is jealous of Sonny at first, but every so often, they become worst friends. Tawni is a diva; she loves mirrors and everything about herself.\n\nSterling Knight as Chad Dylan Cooper (Chad Dylan Goldfarb - mentioned once in Season 1, \"Guess Who's Coming to Guest Star\") - A teen heartthrob on Mackenzie Falls, the rival tween TV series of So Random!. He is very egotistical and self-centered, although he does occasionally have a soft side. He also has an off and on love/hate relationship with Sonny.\n\nBrandon Mychal Smith as Nico Harris - A cast member of So Random! who is best friends with Grady. A running gag throughout the series is Nico jumping into Grady's arms when he gets scared.\n\nDoug Brochu as Grady Mitchell - A cast member of So Random!. He is best friends with Nico. Grady is always involved in strange plans with Nico.\n\nAllisyn Ashley Arm as Zora Lancaster - A cast member of So Random!. She is very smart, crazy and clever. Every once in a while, she also has a rather sadistic mind. The character played a large role in season 1, but has been absent for most of season 2 so far.\n\nNotable guest stars\n\nSelena Gomez as herself (Season 1, \"Battle of the Networks' Stars\")\n\nJeff Dunham and his dummy Walter as Officer Dilman (Jeff) and Officer Rothband (Walter) (Season 1, \"Hart to Hart\")\n\nChristina Moore as Tawni's mom and manager, Tammi (Season 1, \"Hart to Hart\")\n\nKelly Blatz as James Conroy (Season 1, \"Sonny With a Chance of Dating\")\n\nEric Toms as Gilroy Smith (Season 1, \"Sonny So Far\")\n\nGenevieve Hannelius as Dakota Condor (Season 1 & 2, \"Sonny and the Studio Brat\", \"Cookie Monsters\", \"Gassie Passes\", and \"High School Miserable\")\n\nSam Lerner as Dinka (Season 2, \"Sonny Get Your Goat\")\n\nRobert Clotworthy as Dr. Spector (Season 2, \"Walk a Mile in My Pants\")\n\nGuy Burnet as Trey Brothers (Season 2, \"Sonny With a Song\")\n\nRaven-Symon√© as Amber Ericcs (Season 2, \"That's So Sonny\")\n\nProduction\n\nThe original working title for the series was Sketchpad!, and the original name for the main character was Molly Munroe. The show's title was later changed to Welcome to Mollywood, and then an article in Tiger Beat stated Demi Lovato would be starring in \"Mollywood\". The lead character's name was then changed Holli and the title changed once again to Welcome to Holliwood. The main character's name was later changed to Sonny Munroe, and the show's title was changed a final time to Sonny with a Chance.\n\nSonny With a Chance has a show-within-a-show, So Random!, complete with fully-produced sketches. Sonny With a Chance's executive producer Brian Robbins previously wrote for and served as an executive producer on the real-life kids sketch comedy series All That for Nickelodeon.\n\nGary Marsh, president of entertainment, Disney Channel Worldwide, stated \"This series is rooted in one of the core thematic attributes that we stand for, which is following your dream, there also was the opportunity to do a hybrid show.\"[4] The show began production on September 15, 2008 and the first season was taped at Stage 11 at NBC Studios in Burbank, California;[4] for the second season, the show's production moved to Hollywood Center Studios in Hollywood, California, where The Suite Life on Deck, Wizards of Waverly Place and JONAS are also taped.\n\nShows within the show\n\nSo Random!\n\nSo Random! is the fictional TV sketch comedy show featured within Disney's Sonny With a Chance. This is similar to other kids' sketch television series such as All That, The Amanda Show, and You Can't Do That on Television, or a child-oriented version of Saturday Night Live and MadTV in which cast members perform scripted comedy sketches. The fact that the sketches are often short makes it a quickfire sketch show, like the Australian shows Comedy Inc. or Fast Forward. So Random! sketches featured in episodes of Sonny With a Chance often focus on absurd situations. Nico, Grady, Zora, Tawni, and Sonny, the five regular stars of So Random!, perform and help to write and edit the show's sketch. It should be noted that they might replace cast members once in a while.\n\nSo Random! and a drama called MacKenzie Falls' had a rivalry for two years because MacKenzie Falls often criticizes the cast of So Random! for being on a comedy show, claiming that they're not real actors. The two shows got closer when Sonny tried to make things better and because of Sonny and Chad's on-and-off \"relationship\". Both may have crushes on each other as seen on episode called \"Sonny: So Far\" and upcoming season 2 episode \"Falling For The Falls\" Part 1 & 2 when Chad asks Sonny out.\n\nMackenzie Falls\n\nMackenzie Falls is a fictional popular prime time drama aimed at tweens starring Chad Dylan Cooper as Mackenzie. The only other known cast members are Portlyn, Chloe, Penelope, Trevor, and Devon.[5] The show films on a soundstage adjacent to So Random![6] The Guardian describes Mackenzie Falls as \"basically every teen drama from Dawson's Creek to Gossip Girl shoved into a blender\".[7] Mackenzie Falls' far-fetched and confusing plots parody those of teen dramas and prompt Tawni to ask Chad, \"What is your show even about?\"[8] Although a Mackenzie Falls episode has never been aired during Sonny With a Chance, the Mackenzie Falls season finale cliffhanger short is included as a bonus feature on the Season 1 DVD.\n\nA longstanding rivalry exists between the cast of Mackenzie Falls and that of So Random!. The cast of Mackenzie Falls often criticizes the cast of So Random! for being on a comedy show, claiming that they're not real actors. Mackenzie Falls cast members all exhibit snobbish behavior and are afraid that So Random! will become more popular than Mackenzie Falls. Chad Dylan Cooper acts as the leader, since the other cast members follow his cues. The upscale Mackenzie Falls studio includes a chocolate fountain, gourmet snacks, massage room, and a meditation room for its actors. The studio cook enjoys Mackenzie Falls more than So Random! and therefore expresses favoritism for the former cast, demonstrated when she fed the Mackenzie Falls cast dishes such as steak and lobster and the So Random! cast dog food and \"chicken knuckles.\" Mackenzie Falls and So Random! got closer when Sonny joined the cast of So Random!, mainly because of Sonny and Chad's on again/off again sometimes more-than-friendship. In \"The Legend Of Candy Face\" a parody sketch is made by the cast of So Random!, called \"Mackenzie Stalls\".\n\nDisney has created a web site that reflects websites for other Disney shows. Characters listed along with Chad Dylan Cooper in Mackenzie Falls are Devon, who is always jealous of his half-brother, Mackenzie; Penelope, the former love interest; Chloe, the new girl who is not as rich as the others (her father is worth only $10 million) and therefore she is hated by Penelope, yet wants to be with Mackenzie, and Mackenzie's best friend, Trevor. Confirmed as a future guest star is upcoming rapper Sid Hyet, who will play himself in the fictional show. The school they go to is called Westkick Prep School, possibly an allusion to Ed Westwick, who is best known for his character in Gossip Girl, a drama similar to Mackenzie Falls.[citation needed]\n\nEpisodes\n\nMain article: List of Sonny With a Chance episodes\n\nSeasons Episodes First air date !yes Last air date\n\n1 21 February 8, 2009 November 22, 2009\n\n2 TBA March 14, 2010 TBA\n\nTheme song and opening sequence\n\nThe show's theme song \"So Far, So Great\", was written by Jeanne Lurie, Chen Neeman and Aristedis \"Aris\" Archontis, who have each written songs for several artists on Disney-owned Hollywood Records. It is performed by series star Demi Lovato. The theme is of pop-rock style (the music cues composed by Scott Clausen and Christopher Lee, signaling scene changes and commercial breaks are styled similarly).\n\nA full-length version of this theme was released via the Radio Disney network on March 31, 2009, less than two months after the show's U.S. premiere. The theme song is also featured as a track on the Disney compilation album, Disney Channel Playlist, released by Walt Disney Records on June 9, 2009. It is also available as the 14th track on Demi Lovato's sophomore album Here We Go Again, released by Hollywood Records on July 21, 2009.\n\nThe opening sequence (which slides in from the top of the screen at the end of the teaser scene) begins with a shot of a ringing telephone, which Sonny picks up. After presumably getting the call from Hollywood to appear on So Random!, she screams into the phone, drops it and quickly packs a suitcase. The background suddenly changes from Sonny's bedroom to an airplane headed to California (though this portion contradicts a statement in the pilot episode by Sonny's mother Connie that they drove from Wisconsin to California). It continues by showing Sonny in L.A., then showing shots of the other characters (Tawni, who does a quick shine of a star with her picture on it; Chad looking out the window in the back of a limousine; Grady and Nico messing around; and Zora, atop of a mechanical monster machine she is controlling). The sequence ends with the entire cast walking together then stopping and posing, which then switches to Sonny walks next to the show's title logo where she knocks it into place, timed exactly while Sonny says \"Yow!\" just before the theme ends, in a manner similar to the end of the That's So Raven opening titles. The opening sequence for season two remains virtually the same, with only the portion where Sonny knocking the title logo into place being reshot.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe official Sonny With a Chance soundtrack album will feature a total of 23 songs (3 songs from season 1 & 20 songs from season 2). It will be released in the United States on September 22, 2010 and is currently in development.\n\nReccorded Traks\n\nMe, Myself and Time\n\nSo Far So Great\n\n[edit] DVD releases\n\nTitle Release date Episodes\n\nSonny With a Chance: Sonny's Big Break August 25, 2009 (USA) \"Sketchy Beginnings\", \"West Coast Story\", \"Sonny At The Falls\", \"Cheater Girls\", \"Sonny In The Middle\" bonus Episode\n\nBonus features include a never before seen episode entitled, \"Sonny in the Middle\".
