        "text": "Sonny With a Chance Season 3 First Taping\n\nSonny With a Chance premiered on the Disney Channel on February 8, 2009. It has an awesome, talented cast. Demi Lovato stars as Sonny Munroe. Sonny comes to LA to star in a show called So Random. Her co-stars are Nico (Brandon Smith), Grady (Doug Brochu), Tawni (Tiffany Thornton), and Zora(Allisyn Arm). A rival show called MacKenzie Falls shoots on the same lot. The lead actor on that show is Chad Dylan Cooper played by Sterling Knight!\n\nDemi toured with the Jonas Brothers and the cast of Camp Rock in the summer and early fall of 2010. She entered a residential treatment center for private problems. We have met Demi a few times and found her to be very sweet and caring. We believe that she was very hurt by mean people and had some problems that she needed professionals to help her with.\n\nWith Demi in treatment, SWAC fans wondered what would happen with season 3. Some people thought the series would be canceled.\n\nWell on February 1st 2011, we attended the first taping of season 3 of Sonny With a Chance!\n\nWe arrived at the studio with several friends who were in our group. It took a long time for the workers to come out and check us in. We were told after waiting two hours that we couldn’t bring our cameras in because they changed the audience seating area and the set and they want it to be a surprise when it airs. So we put our cameras away! We saw a bunch of our Twitter friends in line! It is fun to have freinds who share our hobby!\n\nThen they came by and said the audience is going to be on camera now and on the same level as the set! The seats weren’t high up and weren’t regular chairs. The seating area now was filled with stools, director chairs, couches, and small round tables with chairs like at an ice cream shop. They also said that since we might be on TV we couldn’t have logos on our clothes. We turned our shirts around and/or turned them backwards. We then had to fill out papers that said it was ok for them to put us on TV. Then they had us go in and they took pictures of us one by one with a board with our name on it proving we said it was OKto put us on TV and we had to go through a metal detector.\n\nThey finally let us in! We passed by some racks of clothes and a trailer and a lady passed out bags of popcorn! They let our group sit in director chairs. The set had a bunch of different doors and was two stories high. Two smaller sets were built for this episode. One looked like a kitchen and one was a like living room! The warm up guys came out and got us excited. They were going to give away prizes. There was even a DJ. Later ,they would pass out pizza and candy!\n\nPeople wondered if Demi would visit or be in the show but she wasn’t there. She still is going to out patient treatment and Disney has said they will give her all the time she needs to get better!\n\nWe had read that with Sonny gone, the season might be just So Random sketches without a real story about Sonny and Chad. They may have written a few episodes like this but now that Demi is out of treatment might change future episodes…\n\nThe first skit was with two kids in a kitchen and TONY HAWK and Doug Brochu are Lunch Ladies, in dresses wigs and hairnets. selling some gross cafeteria food like Mac and Sneeze! We watched that skit get filmed like 5 times. They tried different jokes and camera angles. It was really funny!\n\nAllisyn Arm did a skit where she threw a huge tantrum and ripped the head off her unicorn because her mom brought her cubed ice instead of crushed.\n\nOne weird thing about So Random is that Chad Dylan Cooper is a regular now! The cast are nice to him and accept him!\n\nThey did a really funny skit where Chad was dressed like a crazy ,Samari bank robber and the So Random Cast were Ninjas but they were safety minded Ninjas so they had to put on their helmets, then their shin guards, then their full body padding. Then, they had to put down their floor mats. All this time, Chad’s character is waiting to fight them.. Tiffany laughed so hard during this skit they had to tape it again.. It was my favorite!\n\nA few skits they had filmed another day. One was a music video where Doug and Brandon wanted to make wearing socks with sandals cool!\n\nOne was the Housewives of New Jersey . Tiffany and Sterling were in this one but we didn’t recognize the other housewives….\n\nOne was with a Clay Aiken character and Allisyn asks for his autographs.\n\nOne was Brandon playing Bragging Benson. That was really silly. He would “brag” about things, but each thing was some thing he failed at.\n\nThe warm up guy was giving these “dollars” away. They have the date of the show as the serial number 02022011\n\nIt also says Season Three 2011 and the signature says Sonny with a Chance.\n\nNear the end Sterling said something like, “When I agreed to be part of the So Random cast is was on two conditions, one I get to say Watch Mackenzie falls, Thursdays 8 central 9 Pacific and two I get to introduce MacKenzie Falls’ biggest fan, Tony Hawk. Then Tony said, “I never saw Mackenzie Falls and I don’t know who you are but……” and they did another little skit.\n\nTony had to leave early and wasn’t going to stay to the end of the show. My friend who was with us is a tom boy. She looks just like a boy. Everyone thinks she’s a boy and she loves Tony Hawk. She was even wearing a Tony Hawk T-shirt. She had turned it around because we weren’t supposed to let logos show in case we were on TV. Well, my mom asked the warm up guy if Tony could sign my friend’s shirt and he said no since Tony had to leave. We were watching Tony sign the wall. On the new set, there is a black and white checkered wall. They are going to have all the guest stars sign a white square. After Tony signed the wall, he signed a SKATEBOARD! The warm up guy said someone in the audience was going to win it!\n\nThe taping lasted like 4-5 hours. We were so tired and just as it was ending, The warm up guy, Ezra and his brother in law , Darren, said they decided to give the skateboard to someone who was wearing a TONY HAWK shirt! So my friend won it!\n\nAt the end, the stars signed posters and books for fans. Allisyn remembered me (Alexi) since we’ve met several times. Some people snuck in cameras and got pics, too.\n\nBrandon Smith’s parents and sister was there. They were so proud of him and laughed super loud at all his jokes! My mom talked to his parents and they said he had a great time visiting the White House!\n\nWell a few other things happened that were funny and surprising but we don’t want to spoil the whole show for you. It was really fun!\n\nWe think Demi will return and then things will go back to the way they were but this is a great way to keep the series going while she gets better! Let’s keep watching the show and keep the ratings up so it doesn’t get canceled. We think we heard this episode will air in May but we might be wrong. We also think the episode will be called Sonny With A Chance of So Random. We don’t think they’ll change the name of the show to So Random even though the stars were tweeting #SoRandom last night. We think it’s just because that episode was all So Random Skits\n\nSupport the show and the actors. Watch SWAC Tweet about it\n\n@TheRealTiffany\n\n@DugyFresh\n\n@BrandonSmithCeo\n\n@S_Knight05\n\n@Allisyn_A_Arm\n\nI hope you enjoyed this blog. My mom ad I worked hard on it!\n\nFollow me on Twitter @Alexirob\n\nCheck out My pics on Flickr Alexirob\n\nMeeting the cast of Sonny with a Chance\n\nOn February 8th, 2009 Disney premiered a brand new comedy called Sonny with a Chance.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSonny with a Chance is about a teenager named Allison Munroe “Sonny” (Demi Lovato) who is the new star of a show called So Random!. Her co- star’s are Nico, Grady, Tawni and Zora. A rival show called Mackenzie falls films on the same lot. The star of that show is Chad Dylan Cooper. He is very full of himself and thinks every girl is in love with him!\n\nThe show is really funny and since it’s a show within a show, crazy things are always happening.\n\nJoe Jonas, G. Hannelius, Allstar weekend and Shaquille O’ Neil have been some of the many guest stars!\n\nG plays a recurring role as the daughter of the head of the studio. Her character is also known as Sharkota- since she has quite a temper and if a member of the cast makes her angry, she says her dad will fire them.\n\nI have met every member of the cast at least once. Allisyn Arm and Doug Brochu support SEVERAL charities so I have run into them several times!\n\nThe cast is really fun, sweet and talented!\n\nDEMI LOVATO\n\nDemi plays Sonny, the main character. She has a lot of energy and loves to do sketches with her cast masts. She writes music and is nervous about sharing the songs with her friends. She dated Chad Dylan Cooper then broke up with him! One character she plays is Sicky Vicky.\n\nDemi Lovato is 18 years old and began acting on the Barney show. She also is a talented singer and has had concerts. She also played Mitchie Torres in Camp Rock and Camp Rock 2. She also co-starred with Selena Gomez in Princess Protection Program. I met her at a free concert in Glendale as part of Shop Til U Rock last summer! She signed my Friends for Life poster. When she saw I didn’t have Selena’s autograph, she said, “Maybe I can help you with that!” I also saw her as part of the Camp Rock 2 /Jonas Brothers/ Demi Lovato concert in September, 2010.\n\nDemi has no Twitter right now and is getting treatment for some issues she’s having.\n\nDemi at the Irvine Camp Rock 2/Jonas Brothers Demi Lovato concert\n\nSTERLING KNIGHT\n\nSterling plays Chad Dylan Cooper. Chad is really confident and thinks he’s a super guy and thinks all girls everywhere are in love with him. He is really self-centered but sometimes shows a softer side of himself to Sonny.

He, Tiffany Thornton and Allstar Weekend hung out with about 100 fans in a big backyard for an afternoon! In real life Sterling is pretty shy. He’s really nice and quiet too.

He comes up with lots of reasons to just hang out with Nico.\n\nDoug Brochu is a REALLY NICE GUY! His brother is Chris Brochu and his mom and dad come with him for some of the charity events he’s involved in!\n\nI’ve met Doug about 4-5 times. He is so cool.
