        "text": "Technically the third season of what once was Sonny With a Chance, So Random! was a 2011 Sketch Comedy series on the Disney Channel. So Random! was a Show Within a Show in Sonny With a Chance that the characters were stars on and snippets would be shown in between the off-set plots.\n\nHowever, Demi Lovato, who played Sonny, refused to reprise her role after the second season in order to focus on her musical career and resolve some personal issues. The show was retooled and defictionalized into its own show, losing the backstage plots and becoming a full-fledged Sketch Comedy show complete with special and musical guests.\n\nOnly had one season and ended in 2012.\n\nTropes used in So Random! include:\n\nAction Girl: In the Wheel of Fortune Parody, the Vanna White girl got so annoyed by Fred, that she ripped off a piece of the board, and bashed it onto Fred's head.\n\nVanna: You're welcome, America!\n\nApparently, Strawberry Shortcake as well, in a parody segment called \"Strawberry Shortbread Saves the Earth\".\n\nAdorkable: Becky, the Girl Who was Raised By *|DUN DUN DUNNN* Beavers!\n\nAffectionate Parody / Stylistic Suck: Similar to its role in Sonny With a Chance, it is a parody of All That, You Can't Do That on Television, The Amanda Show, MMC, etc. and its tone reflects that. Unfortunately, without knowing this, or with the burden of it having to stay true to its parodic nature and hold together as its own entity sans SWAC, it can come across as over the top or mediocre in its own right.\n\nAge-Inappropriate Dress: Your Daughters Closet, the only store that sells cool clothes to moms who are too old to rock them!\n\nThe Band Minus the Face: At least where the nucleus of the cast is concerned, it is basically Sonny With a Chance minus Sonny. The behind the scenes plotlines concerning Sonny have been abandoned as well, but the behind the scenes part came for one episode only- the one where Tony Hawk guest starred.\n\nBig Damn Movie: Parodied with Strawberry Shortbread Saves the Earth.\n\nBeware the Nice Ones: Tantrum Girl.\n\nBerserk Button: In the \"Tantrum Girl\" skits, EVERYTHING.\n\nIncluding the fact that people think she throws tantrums.\n\nBreaking the Fourth Wall: In Miss Piggy's episode, we see her talking to Kermit on the phone. Her side of the conversation (we don't hear Kermit's) goes something like:\n\nCall Back: In one of the Tantrum Girl skits, Allisyn Ashley Arm wears her Blossom Scout uniform from Sonny With A Chance.\n\nGlendovia, the imaginary country featured in a Sonny With a Chance episode, gets a fair mention in one sketch.\n\nCannot Convey Sarcasm: The eponymous character of \"Possibly Sarcastic Skip\", was born with a terrible disease that makes everything he says sarcastic, whether he intends it that way or not.\n\nCaptain Ersatz: One of the sketches has a cheery food-themed girl named Strawberry Shortbread. Of course, it's definitely not Strawberry Shortcake: This one avenges her friends and saves the world from extraterrestrials!\n\nCaptain Obvious: Taylor Swift in the Wheel of Fortune sketch:\n\nAlso, a literal incarnation of the trope (a captain who goes around pointing out obvious things) in one episode.\n\nCatch Phrase: \"Oh, you're not going to believe this!\"\n\n\"Tell ya WUUUUUUUT!\"\n\n\"Well I don't mean to BRAG but..\"\n\n\"Angus, you know that pose drives me CRAAAAAZZYYY!\"\n\n\"I knnnnnoooooorrrrrr!\"\n\n\"I don't play by the rules. (food item)!\" (crashes into something)\n\n\"Have you seen my shins? They're like sticks.\"\n\nDawson Casting: Tiffany Thorton, who plays Tawni, who is stated as been in her late teens, in real-life 26.\n\nDead Baby Comedy: The \"Zombie Man\" skits. One of them involves Zombie Man eating his teacher and then using her bones as a science project.\n\nA Dog Ate My Homework: Not a dog, but a monkey took it instead. (Actually, the monkey force-fed the dog the homework). The dog did, however, eat the plane tickets.\n\nExtreme Doormat: Subverted. The Goth girl from the Garage Band sketches acts like one, but she goes Berserk Button at the not raging people who try to join the band.\n\nDefictionalization\n\nDo-It-Yourself Theme Tune: Sung by cast member Brandon Mychal Smith, titled \"So Random (It's A Party In Here)\".\n\nFunny Foreigner: Angus, the Australian Supermodel.\n\nOne sketch revolves around a guy named Oscar who got expelled, but goes back as Olaf, a transfer student from Glendovia.\n\nGame Show Appearance: One skit had cast members as Fred, Taylor Swift and Willow Smith on Wheel of Fortune.\n\nGetting Crap Past the Radar: In one Mr. Goodman sketch, he takes his class to an art museum. One of the paintings is a still life with fruit, which includes a melon with a slice removed, giving it a quite vaginal shape. Mr. Goodman keeps poking that very painting, in that very spot, ostensibly to point out it's a paint-by-numbers (it's not).\n\nZombie Man- he eats people (off-screen). It's Played for Laughs.\n\nGoth: The \"girl in the garage band\" sketches. The other band members could count, to a lesser extent.\n\nGrammar Nazi: MC Grammar, to the point of getting beat up.\n\nGirlfriend in Canada: Played straight and discussed in the \"Learning Spanish with Reynaldo Rivera\" sketch.\n\nHide Your Pregnancy: Presumably what's going to happen with Tiffany Thornton, since she's pregnant with her first child.\n\nHitler Ate Sugar: Joked with in in skit:\n\nIdiosyncratic Episode Naming: Unusually for a Kid Com these days, averted. Episodes are named for the (usually)musical guest.\n\nImprobably Predictable: In a school news sketch, one of the anchors keeps handing the other letters responding to his response to the previous letter. At one point, the other anchor asks \"when did you find the time to write all these letters and how did you know what I was going to say?\", which is replied to with a letter saying \"Because you're very predictable\".\n\nIronic Echo: In the \"MC Grammar\" sketch."
