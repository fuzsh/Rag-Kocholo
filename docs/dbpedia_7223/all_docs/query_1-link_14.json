        "text": "Their big break! Sonny With a Chance premiered via Disney Channel in February 2009 and the show’s stars — Demi Lovato, Tiffany Thornton, Brandon Mychal Smith, Sterling Knight, Doug Brochu and Allisyn Ashley Arm — skyrocketed to immediate fame.\n\nFor two seasons, the sitcom made viewers laugh out loud as they watched teenager Sonny Monroe adjust to her new life in Hollywood after being invited to join the cast of sketch comedy series So Random. Once the show came to an end in January 2011, some of the original stars stuck around for a new series titled So Random! — which aired on the network for one season from 2011 until 2012. Demi, for one, didn’t return to their title role as Sonny for the new series.\n\n“It made sense for me to go ahead and leave the show to focus on my music,” the told People in April 2011 about leaving the show. “It’s kind of sad for me that a chapter of my life has ended but there couldn’t be a better time for me to move on.”\n\nAfter more than 10 years apart, the Sonny With a Chance stars reunited for an April 2020 virtual reunion amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. At the time, Demi told their former castmates that they’d love to get everyone back together for a completely new project.\n\n“I love all of you guys so much, but I went through so much during that show that I would rather just start a whole new project with all of you,” the “Skyscraper” musician explained. “I had the best time with you guys and when I think about the show, I miss you guys. And I miss spending time with you and joking and going to Kitchen 24 on our lunch breaks … If we were ever to do anything, I think we should just do a whole new thing.”\n\nDuring the same reunion, Demi recalled the moment they found out the show would continue with out their character, noting “you don’t expect your show to go on without you, but it did.”\n\n“But I couldn’t have been happier for everybody,” they added. “I just wasn’t in a period of time when I was ready to be on camera again. I could not go back into that environment and there were other things that factored into it.”\n\nScroll through our gallery to see what the Sonny With A Chance stars have been up to since the show ended."
