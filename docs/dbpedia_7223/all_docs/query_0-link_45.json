on monday that in making a routine traffic stop the police can permit a trained dog to sniff the car for drugs without the need for any particular reason to suspect the driver of a narcotics violation the 6to2 decision set aside a ruling by the illinois supreme court which held in 2003 that a state trooper who had stopped a man for speeding had broadened the scope of the encounter beyond

kerry max cook played by aidan quinn below the case mr cook was twice found guilty and sentenced for the 1977 killing of linda jo edwards in 1996 the texas court of criminal appeals reversed his second conviction and ordered another trial saying that prosecutorial and police misconduct has tainted this entire matter from the outset mr cook instead agreed to plead no contest to a murder charge in exchange for time served the critique david e dobbs the prosecutor who handled the 1996 plea deal but was not involved in the earlier misconduct said the plea accurately reflected the facts he is unequivocally guilty of this crime mr dobbs said gary gauger played by brian dennehy below the case in 1993 mr gauger was convicted of killing his parents the year before the trial judge initially sentenced him to death but later reduced the sentence to life in prison in 1996 an appeals court ordered that he be retried ruling that some incriminating statements mr gauger had made during many hours of questioning should not have been presented to the jury because police officers did not have cause to arrest him prosecutors instead dropped the charges and members of the outlaws a motorcycle gang confessed to the murders the critique in 2003 a federal appeals court judge in chicago richard a posner summarized some of the facts in an interim ruling in mr gaugers civil suit for false arrest the absence of signs of forced entry or a struggle he wrote together with gaugers suspicious behavior and statements the financial benefit to him of his parents death his share of their estate was several hundred thousand dollars and his acknowledgment that members of the outlaws motorcycle gang had been occasional customers of his fathers motorcycle shop has left a lingering suspicion that he

this offense the court ruled physical evidence also exists to establish that someone other than hayes committed the offense at the retrial in 1997 the jury heard evidence that mr hayess dna was found inside the victim pamela albertson and also that hairs found clutched in her hand were inconsistent with those of mr hayes he was acquitted the critique the acquittal on retrial was based on reasonable doubt not actual innocence said ward a campbell a supervising deputy state attorney general in sacramento who has studied cases of people released from death row delbert tibbs played by delroy lindo below the case in 1975 mr tibbs was sentenced to death for murdering terry milroy and to life for raping cynthia nadeau two florida hitchhikers the only evidence against him was ms nadeaus testimony the next year the florida supreme court reversed his conviction and granted him a new trial saying there was a very real possibility that tibbs had nothing to do with these crimes years passed as appeals courts considered whether a retrial should be barred as double jeopardy in 1982 the united states supreme court ruled that a retrial was appropriate soon afterward prosecutors dropped the case the critique joseph dalessandro a state attorney told the florida commission on capital cases in 2002 that ms nadeau had progressed from a marijuana smoker to a crack user and i could not put her up on the stand so i declined to prosecute he added tibbs in my opinion was never an innocent man wrongfully accused he was a lucky human being he was guilty he was lucky and now he is
