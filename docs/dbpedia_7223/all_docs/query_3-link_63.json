        "text": "Meeting the cast of Sonny with a Chance\n\nOn February 8th, 2009 Disney premiered a brand new comedy called Sonny with a Chance.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSonny with a Chance is about a teenager named Allison Munroe “Sonny” (Demi Lovato) who is the new star of a show called So Random!. Her co- star’s are Nico, Grady, Tawni and Zora. A rival show called Mackenzie falls films on the same lot. The star of that show is Chad Dylan Cooper. He is very full of himself and thinks every girl is in love with him!\n\nThe show is really funny and since it’s a show within a show, crazy things are always happening.\n\nJoe Jonas, G. Hannelius, Allstar weekend and Shaquille O’ Neil have been some of the many guest stars!\n\nG plays a recurring role as the daughter of the head of the studio. Her character is also known as Sharkota- since she has quite a temper and if a member of the cast makes her angry, she says her dad will fire them.\n\nI have met every member of the cast at least once. Allisyn Arm and Doug Brochu support SEVERAL charities so I have run into them several times!\n\nThe cast is really fun, sweet and talented!\n\nDEMI LOVATO\n\nDemi plays Sonny, the main character. She has a lot of energy and loves to do sketches with her cast masts. She writes music and is nervous about sharing the songs with her friends. She dated Chad Dylan Cooper then broke up with him! One character she plays is Sicky Vicky.\n\nDemi Lovato is 18 years old and began acting on the Barney show. She also is a talented singer and has had concerts. She also played Mitchie Torres in Camp Rock and Camp Rock 2. She also co-starred with Selena Gomez in Princess Protection Program. I met her at a free concert in Glendale as part of Shop Til U Rock last summer! She signed my Friends for Life poster. When she saw I didn’t have Selena’s autograph, she said, “Maybe I can help you with that!” I also saw her as part of the Camp Rock 2 /Jonas Brothers/ Demi Lovato concert in September, 2010.\n\nDemi has no Twitter right now and is getting treatment for some issues she’s having.\n\nDemi at the Irvine Camp Rock 2/Jonas Brothers Demi Lovato concert\n\nSTERLING KNIGHT\n\nSterling plays Chad Dylan Cooper. Chad is really confident and thinks he’s a super guy and thinks all girls everywhere are in love with him. He is really self-centered but sometimes shows a softer side of himself to Sonny. In one episode, Chad said he had a double who did all the dangerous things like play darts, eat Mexican food, ride a bike.\n\nI met Sterling at a charity event called Falling Whistles. He, Tiffany Thornton and Allstar Weekend hung out with about 100 fans in a big backyard for an afternoon! In real life Sterling is pretty shy. He’s really nice and quiet too. He signed my Converse!\n\nHis Twitter is @S_Knight05\n\nI also met him at a signing at Disney D23 Expo in Anaheim. He was very nice meeting many fans that day and signing my Friends for life poster!\n\nTIFFANY THORNTON\n\nTiffany plays Tawni Hart. She is really a diva and thinks she is so pretty and perfect. When Sonny first comes to So Random! she is jealous and hides all of Sonny’s fan mail. The two become friends and help each other out now.\n\nIn real life, Tiffany is 24. She was born in Texas. She is a great singer. She sang at the Falling Whistles event and was awesome. You can find videos of her singing on You Tube! She has acted in a show called Quintuplets and Hatching Pete a Disney Channel Original Movie. She was nominated for a\n\nTeen Choice Award in 2010.\n\nHer Twitter is @TheRealTiffany\n\nTiffany at the 16 Wishes Screening\n\nAllisyn Ashley Arm\n\nAllisyn plays Zora Lancaster. Her character is the youngest. She is always popping out of unexpected spots and surprising people. She is very clever and uses Sherlock Holmes type skills to solve mysteries on the set! She dresses in really original outfits and her hair is in interesting styles!\n\nAllisyn was born in Glendale, California and has been acting since she was four and a half. She loves supporting charities and attending premieres. I have met her 6-7 times. She and her dad are super sweet to my mom and me! I think Allisyn is amazing, working on a show with all older people and supporting so many charities!\n\nHer Twitter is @Allisyn_A_Arm\n\nAllisyn at the Step Up 3D Premiere\n\nAllisyn after the Hollywood Christmas Parade\n\nDOUG BROCHU\n\nDoug plays Grady Mitchell. Nico played by Brandon Mychal Smith is his best friend. Grady can be a little dumb and gets tricked easily. He plays silly character in So Random sketches. He likes to eat and hates to exercise. He comes up with lots of reasons to just hang out with Nico.\n\nDoug Brochu is a REALLY NICE GUY! His brother is Chris Brochu and his mom and dad come with him for some of the charity events he’s involved in!\n\nI’ve met Doug about 4-5 times. He is so cool. He wants to help people less fortunate and has a HUGE heart! He walked with us at Habitat for Humanity, planted plants and raised walls. I’ve also met him at premieres, the Hollywood Christmas Parade and he came to Mitchell Musso’s first concert at the House of Blues. He was at a charity event called Drive Out Hunger. He was hanging out with Ashley Argota, Rachael Bell, and Steven and John French who are going to star in the Suite Life Movie called Two for the Road! Doug has guest starred on Pair of Kings, iCarly, and Zoey 101.He loves to play video games. His good friend is Nathan Kress.\n\nHis Twitter is @DugyFresh\n\nDoug as Oogie on Pair of Kings\n\nDoug after the Hollywood Christmas Parade\n\nBRANDON MYCHAL SMITH\n\nBrandon plays Nico Harris, Grady’s best friend. He thinks he’s a lady’s man but he always ends up striking out! he often jumps into Grady’s arms when things go wrong!\n\nBrandon was born in Los Angeles. He has been in Starstruck, Suite Life of Zack and Cody, That’s So Raven and Phil of the Future. He attends charity events and premieres too. I’ve met him about 3-4 times. He’s always been a gentleman. He began on Skating with the Stars but had to quit due to health problems.\n\nHis twitter is @BrandonSmithCEO\n\nI’ve really enjoyed this show! It premiered on my birthday last year. We really love and support Demi Lovato. We hope she gets all the love, support and help she needs! We would love to see more episodes of Sonny with a Chance!\n\nI hope you follow the stars of #SWAC on Twitter and show your support!\n\nI hope you enjoyed this Blog. My mom and I write them together!\n\nI have tons of Pics on Flickr\n\nFollow me on Twitter @AlexiRob\n\nPlease Share and comment"
