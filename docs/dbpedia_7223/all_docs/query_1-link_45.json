        "text": "Sonny is hosting a Walk-a-Thon For Books where all the participants will be wearing Tawni's Extreme Skinny Jeans, although Sonny and the rest of So Random! have trouble walking in the jeans while Tawni was comfortable with the jeans. Chad finds out about the upcoming event, so he and the rest of Mackenzie Falls decide to host a Walk-A-Thon Against Books where all the contestants will also be wearing Tawni's Extreme Skinny Jeans. However, the next day, Tawni becomes incapacitated, and is sent to hospital, accompanied by Sonny. Upon arriving the hospital, Tawni is diagnosed with SPS (Skinny Pants Syndrome), an infection that cuts the blood circulation, where it affects your ability to walk. Then, a TV network broadcasts the \"Walk-A-Thon\" events, where both teams also become incapacitated, because of the SPS, so they all end up in hospital and have their pants cut off, much to Tawni's dismay. Later that day, Tawni is given the balloon pants, a medicine that she has to wear until her legs are healed. Tawni becomes fed up with her balloon pants, and she tries to wear the skinny jeans, only to learn that all her fans also suffered SPS, so Tawni and everyone decide to make charity music video \"Stop SPS\", in order to fight against SPS.\n\nSo Random! sketches:\n\n\"Sicky Vicky\": Sonny plays Vicky, a sick girl who hosts a TV show from her bed giving tips about fun things to do when you are sick.\n\nUntitled Hula Sketch: The cast rehearses a hula sketch.\n\n\"Stop SPS\": The casts of So Random! and Mackenzie Falls unite to film the music video to stop Skinny Pants Syndrome.\n\nAbsent: Allisyn Ashley Arm as Zora\n\nNote: On this episode's first broadcast, the widescreen picture seen on Disney Channel HD was mistakenly compressed into the 4:3 center cut picture on Disney Channel's SD feed; the rebroadcast on March 21, 2010 corrected this. This is the first episode broadcast that was taped at Hollywood Center Studios, joining Wizards of Waverly Place, The Suite Life on Deck and Jonas at the lot; the series was shot at NBC Studios in Burbank for the first season. The series' record breaking season premiere was led in by the season finale for Hannah Montana, which topped the week with 7.6 million viewers.\n\nSonny and Tawni are invited on an exchange program to Glendovia because of the success of their \"Check-it-Out Girls\" sketch, but refuse to go together due to an unknown argument. When Tawni goes she is shocked to discover that it is a cultural wasteland and that the Glendovians think the characters are real check out girls. Meanwhile, an exchange student impresses a girl Nico and Grady like, and they both think it is because of his mustache. They then wear a mustache trying to impress her, but they get themselves stuck in their own mustaches because of the glue.\n\nSo Random! sketch:\n\n\"The Check-it-out Girls\": A popular sketch which was a recurring segment in Season 1.\n\nGuest Stars: Michael Kostroff as Marshall, Sam Lerner as Dinka\n\nAbsent: Allisyn Ashley Arm as Zora\n\nTitle Reference: Annie Get Your Gun\n\nSonny’s favorite musician, Trey Brothers, is visiting and she would like to spend time with him to show him some songs she has written. However, Tawni likes Trey and thinks Sonny is trying to steal him from her. So she says that Sonny's song is her song. But then things get more complicated when Trey steals \"Tawni's song\". Meanwhile, Nico and Grady try to find out how to work a magic box.\n\nGuest star: Guy Burnet as Trey Brothers\n\nAbsent: Allisyn Ashley Arm as Zora\n\nSongs featured: \"Me, Myself and Time\"\n\nNote: This episode is Sonny's first time performing a song.\n\nWhen the casts of So Random! and Mackenzie Falls keep doing ridiculous things to each other, Sonny tries to make peace so Ms. Bitterman decides do take them to the woods so they can start trusting each other. While on a team building retreat in the woods, Ms. Bitterman tells the group about the legend of \"Candyface\". When mysterious events start happening and personal items are found broken, the So Random! cast is convinced that \"Candyface\" is responsible.\n\nSo Random! sketch:\n\n\"Mackenzie Stalls\": The cast of So Random! parody Mackenzie Falls, but instead of the setting being by a waterfall, the setting of the sketch is in a school bathroom.\n\nGuest stars: Vicki Lewis as Mrs. Bitterman, William Jonathan Georges as Devon, Leslie-Anne Huff as Penelope, Ashley Jackson as Chloe and DeVaughn Nixon as Trevor\n\nNote: Chad's hair is short in the beginning, but after the theme, it's long again. Ms. Bitterman makes a joke about a guy named Bernie who \"made off\" with her money, referencing Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme scandal of 2008.\n\nWhen Grace, an elderly woman, wins the \"Be So Random! for a Day\" contest, the So Random! cast ends up planning an \"old geezer\" sketch that not only offends Grace and her entire retirement home, but all elderly people. Grace and her friends turn the tables and play a practical joke on the cast. Meanwhile, Chad attempts to help a group of kids with their fear of clowns and ends up looking like one himself.\n\nReferences\n\nDuring one sketch, other Disney Channel shows are (verbally) parodied, including That's So Raven, Wizards of Waverly Place, and Hannah Montana.\n\nThe end-credits sequence features parodies of routines from The Benny Hill Show (the \"Yakety Sax\" chase-sequences, and patting Jackie Wright's bald head), and Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (Arte Johnson's \"man on a tricycle\").\n\nGuest stars: Estelle Harris as Grace Gallagher, Carol Locatell as Edith and Larry Gelman as Buddy\n\nAbsent: Allisyn Ashley Arm as Zora\n\nSonny and Chad try to keep their relationship a secret from their fellow So Random! and Mackenzie Falls cast members. However, they keep slipping up and saying the words \"Chad\" and \"Sonny\" during their rehearsals. This makes the cast members of both shows suspicious. When they go on their first date, Chad messes up because he is nervous and ends up spitting water on Sonny. The cast of So Random! then finds out about their date when the incident is posted on the cover of \"Tween Weekly\" magazine. Chad blames Sonny for what happened and Sonny, infuriated, \"breaks up\" with him. He then climbs through her window into her house to apologize, and shows Sonny a billboard he had made that says he is a fool for her. They then restart their relationship and have a \"second first date\" as the rest of So Random! watches angrily.\n\nLast Appearance of: Connie Munroe\n\nSonny celebrating her one-year anniversary with So Random! is hindered when is she accused of being a thief, from stealing a necklace at a department store, to stealing Nico and Grady's gold coin and possibly stealing the idea of the \"Sicky Vicky\" sketch. When proof of the contrary is to no avail, she is fired from the show. Sonny is eventually cleared of accusations and re-hired after it's revealed that one of the female cast members from Mackenzie Falls was the one to frame Sonny and attempted to kill her and her friends because of her relationship with Chad. Meanwhile, Tawni is annoyed at the fact that she is constantly ignored.\n\nAbsent: Allisyn Ashley Arm as Zora (in part one only)\n\nGuest stars: Leslie-Anne Huff as Penelope and Regan Burns as Ryan Loughlin\n\nNote: This episode was broadcast in a 4:3 letterboxed format on Disney Channel's standard definition feed. Also, when showing Sonny back in Wisconsin, she is wearing a brown wig, because in season 1, her hair is brown in contrast to season 2, where her hair is black. She had to wear a wig because they were filmed together, but one was before her hair changed to black.\n\nChad is upset that he does not have 1,000,000 fans on Flitter (a parody of Twitter) and things get worse when they start to decrease. Sonny enlists the help of Amber Algoode, the president of his fan club and a master of disguise to fix things. Amber uses her disguises to spy on the other So Random! cast members to hear what they think of Chad. When she finds out that they like Chad now that he is dating Sonny, Amber insists that Chad dump Sonny, so that people will find him interesting again and to reach his 1,000,000 fans mark.\n\nSpecial guest star: Raven-Symoné as Amber Algoode\n\nAbsent: Allisyn Ashley Arm as Zora\n\nWhen revealed in an interview that they have yet to share a kiss, Sonny and Chad start to feel pressured by their friends and fans to make it happen. After coming to the realization that there was a lot less pressure when they were just friends, Sonny and Chad decide to break up; they then have their first kiss, finally deciding to get back together. Meanwhile, Nico and Grady believe their temporary dressing room is being haunted by a dead comedian.\n\nSo Random! sketch: \"The Toilet Genie and the Nerd\": Grady plays The Toilet Genie, a genie from a high school bathroom toilet who grants wishes to nerd Nico.\n\nAbsent: Allisyn Ashley Arm as Zora\n\nGuest star: Johari Johnson as Tia\n\nGrady's older brother Grant makes another visit into town just when Grady was about to spend some alone time alone while the other cast members are on vacation, except for Tawni when a hurricane canceles her cruise. Chad is fired from \"Mackenzie Falls\" with Grant being as the new Mackenzie.\n\nAbsent: Brandon Mychal Smith as Nico and Allisyn Ashley Arm as Zora, but their names are both mentioned.\n\nLast Appearance of: Mr. Condor\n\nNote: This is the second time that Brandon Mychal Smith was absent for an episode. He was absent for only one episode in the first season.\n\nDelta House and the yellow and blue hats are a parody of the movie \"National Lampoon's Animal House\".\n\nMarshall is frustrated by the cast's unfunny sketch ideas with the cast later making a video making fun of him. Marshall sees the video realizing how mean he was and decides to quit \"So Random\" to pursue his own acting career with a one-man play entitled \"My Life with Ma\".\n\nSo Random! sketch: Two sketches related to the Japanese herb Wasabi including the game show \"Where's the Wasabi?\" and a Wasabi public service announcement featuring Grady.\n\nGuest star: Benjamin Byron Davis as Savage Stan\n\nAbsent: Sterling Knight as Chad Dylan Cooper\n\nNote: This is the third time that Sterling Knight was absent for an episode and his only time being absent this season.\n\nLast Appearance of: Marshall Pike\n\nSonny writes a song about Chad after breaking up with him, because he's very self-centered in her point of view, but has hard time performing it. Meanwhile, Grady develops a crush on Mel Winters (Skyler Day), a waitress at the Random's new hangout \"The Patio\". Coincidentally she is also Sonny's new neighbor. At first, they hate each other, and Mel thinks that the crowd will hate her singing, but Sonny thinks that they will like it, so they make a bet. Later, she almost performs the song, but Sonny realizes that Chad paid the audience to clap at everything before she sang, so that Sonny would win the bet. She then confronts Chad, who was behind a shrub at the Patio, and they fight once more. Then, the next day, she gets a real crowd, and performs the song and Mel and Sonny develop a friendship. Later, Chad and Sonny run into each other. They talk, and he walks away. She starts humming the song she wrote, while walking away, revealing that she still has feelings for Chad.\n\nAbsent: Allisyn Ashley Arm as Zora\n\nFinal Appearance of: Sonny Munroe\n\nNote: This is the final episode of Sonny With a Chance due to Lovato's departure. This was supposed to be a turning point in the show. So Random! continues without Demi Lovato. In the sequel show, Chad Dylan Cooper (Sterling Knight) joins the cast of So Random replacing Sonny Munroe. This is also Sonny's fourth and final time performing a song.\n\nSongs featured: \"What to Do\""
