        "text": "NEW ORLEANS — Look out, Miley and Hilary, here comes Demi.\n\nDisney Channel has greenlighted the live-action comedy series “Welcome to Mollywood,” starring Demi Lovato of the network’s upcoming Jonas Brothers movie “Camp Rock.”\n\nIt’s a role that could potentially put Lovato on the teen queen career path trod so successfully by Miley Cyrus and Hilary Duff.\n\nThe tentatively titled series — executive produced by Brian Robbins, Sharla Sumpter Bridgett, Steve Marmel and Michael Feldman — centers on Molly (Lovato), a 15-year-old small-town girl who, after a nationwide search, is chosen to join the cast of the most popular and long-running teen sketch comedy show on television. The sitcom will feature a show-within-a-show with fully produced comedy sketches.\n\nLovato was introduced to Disney Channel viewers last year in the shortform comedy series “As the Bell Rings.” She also co-stars in Disney’s upcoming telefilm “Princess Protection Program.”\n\nLovato also has a recording contract with Disney’s Hollywood Records and will tour with the Jonas Brothers in the summer.\n\nThe “Mollywood” cast also includes Tiffany Thornton, Brandon Mychal Smith, Doug Brochu and Allisyn Ashley Arm. It is set to go into production in September.\n\n“This series is rooted in one of the core thematic attributes that we stand for, which is following your dream,” said Gary Marsh, president of entertainment at Disney Channels Worldwide. “There also was the opportunity to do a hybrid show.”\n\nThe pilot was directed by Lee Shallat Chemel, marking her fourth pilot to go to series at Disney Channel, and was written Marmel and Feldman. It is produced by It’s a Laugh Prods."
