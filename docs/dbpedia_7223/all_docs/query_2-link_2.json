        "text": "\"Sweet! I'm no longer the weird one!\"\n\n------â€” Zora Lancaster, upon Sonny's arrival, \"Sketchy Beginnings\"\n\nZora Lancaster, at 13 years old, is the youngest, smallest, and most intelligent member of the So Random! cast. Zora has a photographic memory and a near genius IQ. She is considered the craziest cast member of So Random!.\n\nBiography[]\n\nZora is quickly labeled \"the weird one\", and it usually stands true. Quirky as she may, she is also childish, she's also been seen to have some brains in her head. She uses those brains to get even with other cast members. More than her fellow cast members, certainly. She opts to work in the background mostly, but when she is in front she makes her presence known - showing she's not shy in the least, but rather she chooses to keep her actions under wraps. She can play the violin and is often in the valve in Sonny and Tawni's dressing room, mostly stemming from her claustrophilia (love of confined spaces) which was also demonstrated in High School Miserable where Zora was amused seeing Martha shove a girl into a book locker. Zora is shown to be a very sneaky girl, but a little caring. She is part of the Blossom Scouts, and puts her knowledge of first aid into action, she's not above using manipulation to encourage people to buy her cookies. Zora hates Dakota and always calls her evil and attempts to fight her. Zora also host a celebrity prank show called \"Celebrity Practical Joke'D\". She successfully pranked Chad by gluing his feet to the floor, fulling his convertible with elephant manure and gluing his face to the window. She fell in love in the episode \"Sonny With a 100% Chance of Meddling\". She used to be a fan of MacKenzie Falls. In the episode \"Sonny With a Grant\" Zora was absent because she went home to Portland, Oregon which shows she was born there before she came to California to arrive at So Random!\n\nFilmography[]\n\nYear\n\nFilm\n\nRole\n\nOther notes\n\n2005-present\n\nSo Random!\n\nVarious\n\nComedy Show, Main Role\n\n2009-present Prank'd\n\nHerself\n\nPrank Show, Host\n\n2009 Chad Dylan Cooper: The Chad Dylan Cooper Story\n\nHerself/Various\n\nDrama Film, Lead Role\n\n2010\n\nGassie and We\n\nSusie\n\nFilm, Main Role\n\n.\n\nSketch Characters in Sonny With a Chance[]\n\nZora appears the least in the sketches of all cast members of So Random!.\n\nToilet was a toilet in an unseen \"Barf Sketch\" mentioned in the season one episode, \"Sketchy Beginnings\".\n\nM.C.
