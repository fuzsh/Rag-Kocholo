        "text": "Recently, the cult sitcom, Friends has been enjoying a new resurgence on Netflix. The timeless series complete with ubiquitous but hilarious jokes and endearing quirks has also spawned an amazing new find that was somehow never observed before. Seems like there is more than meets the eye in this household drama. While we don’t have all the answers yet, we do have one eye opening discovery here for you.\n\nSpanning an amazing 10 seasons, we feel like we’ve been through all the ups and downs with the gang. But what about the lesser known cast that has also made our favourite characters who they are? Yes, this is what the kids from Friends look like now.\n\nElizabeth Tan"
