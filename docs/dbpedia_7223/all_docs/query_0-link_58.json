        "text": "A Penny for Your ThoughtsHow are we to find eight short English wordsthat actually stand for autumn?One peculiar way to die of lonelinessis to try. Pretend November hasa sliver of ice in her throat.Pretend it is nice, pretend the sliverof ice is nice, and beckons you.Talk for half an hour about the little churchyardfull of the graves of people who have diedeating nachos. Go on until you can go no further brown.Let the river flow. It is written in stone.Let the sparrows take your only coinand fly with it, twittering over some main event.What color ribbon will you wear in your hair?Now the clouds look burnt. But first they burned.To you I must tell all or lie.From Trances of the Blast by Mary RuefleUsed by permission of Wave Bookswww.wavepoetry.com"
