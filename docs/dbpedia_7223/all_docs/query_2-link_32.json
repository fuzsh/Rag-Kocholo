        "text": "Sonny With a Chance (retitled So Random! for season 3) is a Disney Channel Original Series about Sonny Monroe (Demi Lovato) who moves from her home in Wisconsin to Hollywood to star in her favorite sketch comedy show, So Random!. There she meets with her cast mates, Tawni Hart (Tiffany Thornton), Nico Harris (Brandon Mychal Smith), Grady Mitchell (Doug Brochu), and Zora Lancaster (Allisyn Ashley Arm). The cast is rivaled with another show in the same studio, MacKenzie Falls starring Chad Dylan Cooper (Sterling Knight). The show premiered on May 29, 2009.\n\n21 Episodes by February 8 - November 22, 2009\n\nSonny: I can't believe I'm really here! Mom!\n\nConnie: Ahhh! This is so exciting! All right. Come here. Now hold still. (rubs Sonny's face)\n\nSonny: Mom! Stop it! Stop it! Cut it out! We don't need more sunblock. I'm inside.\n\nConnie: Alright, I'm sorry. You know, it's not everyday I hand my beautiful daughter over to show business.\n\nSonny: Look mom. We talked about this. Show business is not going to change me.\n\nConnie: You've got a big head.\n\nSonny: What? I do not. I'm the same girl I was back home in Wisconsin.\n\nConnie: With a much bigger head.\n\nSonny: My head is the exact same size as-\n\nConnie: (turns Sonny around)\n\nSonny: (sees a large picture of herself) Whoa. I do have a big head. Cool!\n\nMarshall: Ah! There she is! There's my new star!\n\nSonny: Mr. Pike!\n\nMarshall: (shakes Sonny's hand) Please, it's Marshall. (shakes Connie's hand) Connie we're so thrilled to have Sonny join our family. Oh, and I promise you, she's in very good hands here.\n\nConnie: Good. Because you know what we do to people in Wisconsin who make promises they can't keep.\n\nMarshall: You make them into cheese. (laughs then stop) I can see where Sonny gets her sense of humor.\n\nSonny: Actually I get it from my dad. She's not kidding. But she is hovering.\n\nConnie: Alright. Alright. I can take a hint. Someone wants their mom to leave. Okay, come here. Before I go I know I have said this many times but-\n\nSonny: Don't talk to strangers.\n\nConnie: No, but yes.\n\nSonny: Don't swim after eating?\n\n'Connie: No but yes.\n\nSonny: Don't skateboard with a sucker in your mouth.\n\nConnie: I am trying to tell you how proud I am of you. I just, couldn't be prouder... [rubbing Sonny's face]\n\nSonny: You just put a little bit more sun block on me, didn't you?\n\nConnie: No, but yes.\n\nSonny: Bye! [hugs mom]\n\nMarshall: Well, here we are kiddo. This is the prop house.\n\nSonny: Oh my gosh, this is so cool. I've read about this place. Wow, this is where the cast hangs out. This is the gnome from the gnome sketch. And, that's the sarcophagus for the mommy dearest sketch. [sighs] Wow. And, ah, that's a pink hat that I've never really seen before.\n\nMarshall: Yep. One day, there'll be props in here from sketches you're in, maybe one of your hats. Anyway, just know as executive producer, I'm always here for you. [beep]\n\nintercom: Marshall, your mother is on line four.\n\nMarshall: Take a message.\n\nintercom: And five.\n\nMarshall: I gotta go. [walks away]\n\nSonny: [walks to sarcophagus, opens it and sees Zora] Ahh!\n\nZora: Ahh!\n\nSonny: Ahh!\n\nZora: Ahh! Don't you knock?\n\nSonny: Sorry, I didn't realize anyone was here. But, your Zora, and I'm Sonny. I'm new.\n\nZora: Ha. Obviously, otherwise, you would have knocked. Now, if you'll mind... (shut sarcophagus.)\n\nGrady: You play the mother, I play the baby. You play the stomach, I play the barf.\n\nNico: I thought you like playing the barf, bro.\n\nGrady: No, I like playing the barf. It's the funniest thing that comes out of you, but you know.\n\nSonny: Hey guys. [holds her hand out]\n\nNico: Hello there. Nico. [kisses Sonny's hand] But you knew that.\n\nGrady: Grady, but you knew that.\n\nSonny: And I'm Sonny! But I knew that!\n\nSonny: Hey, does this fat suit make me look fat?\n\nTawni: You're in a fat suit?\n\nSonny Ha, ha. See, I was going to tell you how good you did in that fast food sketch, but now I don't think I'm going to.\n\nTawni: You just did.\n\nSonny: Darn my niceness!\n\nSonny: Oh, my gosh! I know you! You're... You're...\n\nChad: [pointing at picture of himself] Him? Chad Dylan Cooper.\n\nSonny: You're MacKenzie on MacKenzie Falls!\n\nSonny: Yes! No! No! Madge is my waitress character. And all this belongs to Madge, too. :[gestures to her fat suit] Hi, I'm Sonny.\n\nChad: Sonny. That's a nice name.\n\nSonny: [reads Chad's autograph] Sonny, thanks for the yogurt. Chad Dylan Cooper. I-I didn't give you any yogurt! Chad Dylan Cooper just stole my yogurt! [talks to an anonymous person] Oh, my gosh! Chad Dylan Cooper just stole my yogurt!\n\nSonny: We were trying to make peace.\n\nChad: Please, you were trying to trap us.\n\nSonny: Trap you? You've obviously been watching your show too much. You know, not everything is cutthroat and gossipy? Sometimes people do things because they're trying to be nice.\n\nChad: Do they, Sonny? Do they, really? Look, it was sweet of you to put that picnic together. It was way sweet. But the bad blood between our two shows has run too deep for too long to be healed by a bowl of egg salad, and even the best of intentions. [holds Sonny's hand] Just because you wish for something doesn't make it so.\n\nSonny: Oh, Chad Dylan--\n\nChad: Shh. The time for talking is over. I must go. So run-- run back to your show, and put your sweet little dreams of peace to bed. [walks away]\n\nSonny: (staring at Chad) What just happened?\n\nThe Interview\n\nChad: You know. A lot of people say that it's So Random! that we won this award. But it's not So Random! ... it's never So Random! . Because Mackenzie Falls rules! Thank you, Tweens!\n\nZora: There SHE Is!\n\nSonny: Hey, guys. Where have you been?\n\nGrady: Where have we been? Where have you been?\n\nSonny: I asked you first.\n\nNico: What happened with Chad?\n\nSonny: Well, see, I went... [ turns on a hairdryer and its whirring loudly ] [inaudible ) - ( whirring stops ) - And that's why everything is okay.\n\nGrady: Did you get back our stuff?\n\nSonny: (whirring loudly but Zora turns off the hairdryer)\n\nZora: Stop blowing and start talking.\n\nSonny: Well, interesting story.\n\nTawni: Did it go something like this? Blah Blah Blah Peace picnic! Blah Blah Blah Oh, I've got nothing.\n\nSonny: Actually, I'm acting like a chicken. I'm not afraid to act like a fool. (continues bawking)\n\nTyler: and that's why she is my pet\n\n(scratching sonny's hair and turning it into a chicken comb)\n\nChad: FINE! I'LL TAKE YOU ON MUSICAL CHAIRS!\n\nSonny: Good. See you at noon.\n\nChad: Yes you will! You smell like ham.\n\nSonny: I've seen you're acting. That makes two of us.\n\nChad: (he and Sonny left in musical chairs) Looks like it's just you, me, and one more thing you're not gonna get.\n\nSonny: You know, you're acting pretty confident for someone who's gonna lose!\n\nChad: Ha ha ha. At least I can act.\n\nSonny: Can you, Chad? Can you, really?\n\nNico: She's givin' it right back to him.\n\nTawni: We might actually win!\n\nSo Random Cast: Yes! Yes! (music stops and Sonny trips) No!\n\nSonny: Ow! It's my ankle, it really hurts. I think something snapped.\n\nChad: (forgets the game) Oh, man... that looks really serious. We'd better get you to a doctor. Just take my hand.\n\nSonny: (grabs his hand then smiles and pulls him down, then jumps into the chair to win the game) Peace out, suckas!!\n\nSo Random Cast: (cheers for Sonny)\n\nTawni: (hugs Sonny but then lets go shortly)\n\nChad: You tricked me!\n\nSonny: No... I was acting!\n\nChad: Not bad. Perhaps there's a spot for you on MacKenzie Falls... after Portlyn disappears in a mysterious ballooning accident.\n\nChad: You know Sonny, didn't seem like your friends where very supportive. It was almost like they were dissing you.\n\nSonny: Oh, them mocking me and making fun of my idea was just their way of, mocking me and making fun of my idea.\n\nChad: Well, you do things differently at \"So Random\". At the Falls, if one of us cries, we all cry. Let's just assume that when one of you laughs, you all laugh.\n\n--- (The \"So Random\" cast enters Stage 2, where it is the \"Mackenzie Falls\" cast)\n\nTawni: I'd like to have a word with you.\n\nGirl of the \"Mackenzie Falls\"\" cast: Is that word goodbye?\n\nTawni: Oh, if I was talking to you the word would be \"moise drie exfoliate\"\n\nSonny: You know, over at the Falls they trust and support each other.\n\nGrady: Did you hear it? She call it the \"Falls\". The \"Falls\".\n\nTawni: Well, if you like the \"Falls\" so much, why don't you go back there?\n\nNico: Yeah, go over there and stick your head in the trust and support fountain.\n\n.Sonny: Well, if you want me to, then maybe I'll go.\n\nTawni: Good.\n\nSonny: Good.\n\nSonny: (drops the pen) Fine! You have seen the last of Sonny Munroe! I mean other than the fact that we have to rehearse.\n\nTawni, Nico, Grady, Zora: (agreeing with Sonny)\n\nSonny: But other than that you have seen the last of Sonny Munroe! (leaves but comes back) Actually I forgot my jacket.\n\nSo Random Cast: (laughing at how silly that Sonny forgot her jacket)\n\nSonny: Other than that, you have seen the last of Sonny Munroe! (leaves then comes back again) I don't even have a jacket!\n\nSo Random Cast: (laughing again that Sonny doesn't even have a jacket)\n\nSonny: Now for the last time, you have seen the last of Sonny Munroe! I say, good day. (finally leaves)\n\n(In the cafeteria, Zora slaps Tawni in the face)\n\nZora: Snap out of it, woman!\n\nTawni: Thank you.\n\nZora: No, thank you! (Starts laughing like a psycho)\n\nGrady: Oh, look. She's making the lobster talk.\n\nAt the prop house:\n\nZora: This is hard for me to say but Sonny is blind!\n\nSo Random Cast: (looks at her confused)\n\nNico: What do you mean she's blind?\n\nZora: Well he said she couldn't see me. And that could mean one thing: blind. Oh, and they got her all tied up in a bell tower!\n\nGrady: How do you know?\n\nZora: Well I heard this loud chime.\n\nTawni: Are you sure it's not a gong in a meditation room?\n\nZora: Oh that's insane. I'm telling you. Something smells fishy.\n\nGrady: This is like that episode of Mackenzie Falls where they-where they blinded that girl and brainwashed her.\n\nSo Random Cast: (looks at him in shock)\n\nGrady: (smiles nervously) Not that I watch it.\n\nNico: Not that I watch it either, but that was never really an episode.\n\nZora: Because this is really happening people!\n\nTawni: Wait, something else is happening. My palms are sweaty. My heart's racing.\n\nNico: I think you're caring.\n\nTawni: (confused) What?\n\nNico: For someone besides yourself.\n\nTawni: WHAT?! We have to stop that! We got to get Sonny back! Not for her but for me!\n\nZora: Well, I have a plan but you guys are going to have to trust me. (crouches down in a circle with Nico and Grady)\n\nTawni: Trusting, caring. It's all too much!\n\nGrady: (pushes Tawni's head down)\n\nTawni: Whoa!\n\nZora: (tells them her plan)\n\nTawni: My hair itches.\n\nGrady: I have never felt more free. I was born to wear a cape.\n\nZora: (shocks Grady)\n\nGrady: Oww! What was that for?\n\nZora: I just mastered my powers. Now back in your poses!\n\nChad: You trust me, don't you?\n\nSonny: No, I don't think I do.\n\nChad: Of course you can. Wait, who is talking while I am acting?\n\nSonny: (looks around and acts like she did nothing)\n\nZora: Watch out for the security guard! He's ten feet tall, with arms like tree trunks and legs that...won't be back for ten minutes?\n\nSo Random Cast: What?\n\nGrady: Oh man! What are we going do for ten minutes?\n\nNico: Zora, do your thing.\n\nZora: (shocks Grady)\n\nGrady: Owwww!!\n\nTawni: Let's do this thing!\n\n(Everyone goes inside the MacKenzie Falls set.)\n\nZora: Sonny!\n\nNico: We're now called \"Loser Force Four\"!\n\n(The cast pose)\n\nSonny: Oww, you gave us a name!\n\nGrady: You gave us a reason to give us a name.\n\n(The cast looks at Grady confused)\n\nGrady: We're at the \"Falls\". I'm felling dramatic.\n\nSonny: You missed me.\n\nTawni: I, experienced caring. It was awful.\n\n(Sonny laughs)\n\nGrady: We're here to apologize to you and ask you to come back.\n\nGirl from \"Mackenzie Falls\" cast: Maybe she doesn't want to come back to you losers.\n\nNico: Loser? \"Loser Force Four\".\n\nChad: Whoa. Never saw a group of losers so proud to call themselves losers.\n\nSonny: Well, you know what. I'm probably calling myself loser too. Well, so I guess that makes us \"Loser Force Five\"!\n\n(She pose)\n\nSonny: C'mon guys. (She whispers \"Loser Force Five\")\n\nThe \"So Random\" cast: \"Loser Force Five\"!\n\n(The cast pose)\n\nMarshall: All right. Rehearsal for So You Think You Can Pee Pee Dance. In 5, 4, 3.\n\nSonny: (wearing a blond wig) This is So You Think You Can Pee Pee Dance! Flo!\n\nTawni: (comes out of a bathroom stall and dances awkwardly)\n\nSonny: Pia!\n\nZora: (comes out of another stall wearing a ballerina costume and dances)\n\nSonny: Agua!\n\nNico: (comes out of a stall and dances)\n\nSonny: And Wee Diddy!\n\nGrady: (wearing gangster clothes and dances)\n\n(Everyone starts dancing.)\n\nSonny: What's up peeps? I know you're all flushed with excitement. Because we are streaming live across the world! The final votes have trickled in. We're about to find who will become number one at holding number one. Right after this (makes a hissing sound). So You Think You Can Pee Pee Dance is brought to you by water! (pours water in a cup)\n\n(All of the dancers can't hold it in anymore and run to the stalls.)\n\nMarshall: (claps) Great rehearsal guys. Now I need a pee pee break.\n\nSonny: Hi, this is Sonny, and you've reached me at 555-0125, you know what to do.\n\n[Sonny's cell phone rings as a cow]\n\nSonny: Hey, my first phone call. Hello?\n\nTawni: Yeah it's me. Could you keep it down? I have twenty pounds of fan mail to go through.\n\nSonny: Fan Mail? Did I get any?\n\n[Sonny's cell phone rings]\n\nSonny: Hello?\n\nTawni: Aw, I was hoping to get your machine. Anyway, no fan mail for you. Sorry\n\nSonny: That's okay!\n\nTawni: Um, I said you had NO fan mail.\n\nSonny: I heard you.\n\nTawni: Doesn't that bother you? I mean when I joined the show, my fan mail started right away.\n\nSonny: Doesn't bother me.\n\n[Sonny's cell phone rings again]\n\nSonny: Hello?\n\nTawni: Does it bother you now?\n\nSonny: I'm off to rehearsal. Besides, I'm not going to let this bother me. I'm way too mature.[Sonny takes baby bottle prop and hat to the rehearsal]\n\nSonny: Wah, Wah, Wah! That's no good. [higher pitched] Wah, Wah, Wah.\n\nTawni: Still crying about no fan mail?\n\nSonny:: No. I told you. I'm totally fine with that.\n\nTawni: Maybe someday, you'll get a fan letter like everyone else. Me, Zora, Grady, Niko, Marshall,...Me.\n\nSonny: Well for your information. I did get a fan letter. From Royalty. A king no less.\n\nTawni: Oh, really? Could it be the Hunan King? Does he live in a noodle palace?\n\nSonny: Actually, he's got seven locations. Okay, fine it's just a menu. I didn't get any stupid fan mail.\n\nTawni: Sweetie, I know it must hurt to be so unpopular. Well, I don't know. I can only imagine. Just like you can only imagine what it's like to actually BE popular. You see, every fan letter is like a hug from a friend.\n\nSonny: Is this pep talk almost over?\n\nTawni: Let's see. I got more pep. So yeah, all done!\n\nSonny: I have fans. They just haven't had time to write yet.\n\nTawni: Keep dreaming!\n\nSonny: It's time. [gets pen and paper and begins to write herself a fan letter from \"Eric\"]\n\nSonny as Eric: Dear Sonny...\n\n[Tawni starts to hide the fan mail with the rest of Sonny's fan mail she's been hiding] [Sonny takes off the costume of Eric]\n\nSonny: Those are all for me!\n\nTawni: No! They're all for-Sonny?\n\nSonny: You've been hiding my fan mail.\n\nTawni: You're pretending to be your own fan?\n\nSonny: You committed mail fraud!\n\nTawni: You committed fan fraud!\n\nSonny: Fan fraud's not illegal!\n\nTawni: Mail fraud's not embarrassing!\n\nChad: (sees Sonny putting \"Eric\" into a box) I knew I recognized you. You're Weird Beard. Why are you Weird Beard?\n\nSonny: Why do you care?\n\nChad: I don't know. Let's give it a shot.\n\nSonny: Well, I sent myself a fan letter, pretended to be my own fan, and now I get to go out on stage and meet the fan I'm pretending to be.\n\nChad: Why would you write yourself a fan letter?\n\nSonny: Because I lost faith in myself.\n\nChad: Oh. Classic case of actor insecurity. You start doubting your abilities, wondering whether you were good enough and whether you deserve to be on TV.\n\nSonny: So you've been through this before?\n\nChad: No, no. No, but I made you think I had which is why I'll never go through it. Whew!\n\nSonny: You are unbelievable! I knew it. You don't care. I thought we were having a real moment here.\n\nMarshall: Now please welcome back to the stage the cast of So Random!\n\nSonny: Well, that's my cue.\n\nChad: So what are you gonna do?\n\nSonny: You don't care, remember? But I do. Now excuse me while I go out there and embarrass myself.\n\nSonny: Let's just get this over with. Marshall, I have to say something. Eric is...\n\nChad: (as Eric) Your biggest fan!\n\nTawni: That's impossible. Eric is not real!\n\nChad: But I'm standing right here. Let's give it up for Sonny!\n\nSonny: Why are you helping me?\n\nChad: I'm not helping you. I just wanted to try on the beard.\n\nSonny: Sounds like somebody cares.\n\nChad: Somebody... wanted to try on a weird beard.\n\nSonny: Cares.\n\nChad: Beards.\n\nSonny: Cares.\n\nChad: Beards.\n\nSonny: Cares.\n\nChad: Beards.\n\nSonny: Beards.\n\nChad: Cares.\n\nSonny: Gotcha!\n\nTawni: Any fan of Sonny's is a fan of mine! Right?\n\nSonny as Eric: Not necessarily.\n\nMarshall: All right. Places everyone! Places everyone! This is the final rehearsal for the Check It Out Girls sketch. And action!\n\nSonny: So check it out. Yesterday I got a manicure. Check it out. (shows her fingers to Tawni)\n\nTawni: Ooh! Check those out! Check you out!\n\nSonny: Yeah right?\n\nNico: Uh excuse me uh, could you check me out?\n\nSonny and Tawni: Sure!\n\nSonny: Check out his vest.\n\nTawni: His vest? Check out his boots.\n\nSonny: His boots? Check out his hair.\n\nNico: Uh, yeah I'm right here. I want you to check out my items alright?\n\nSonny: (scoffs) Check out your items? Check out his attitude!\n\nTawni: His attitude? Check out his breath.\n\nNico: You know what? Forget it! (leaves)\n\nGrady: Excuse me? How about checking out my groceries?\n\nSonny and Tawni: Sure!\n\nSonny: Check out his cereal!\n\nTawni: Check out his tuna panini!\n\nGrady: Alright drop the panini and give me all of your money! (points his finger in his jacket pocket)\n\n(Sonny and Tawni just stare at him while chewing their gum.)\n\nSonny: Check out greedy panini guy.\n\nTawni: Check out his finger in his jacket.\n\nSonny: Check out his jacket.\n\nTawni: Check out my jacket! (takes out her jacket)\n\nSonny: Oh my gosh! Check it out, I have the same jacket! (takes out her jacket)\n\nGrady: I'm trying to rob ya here!\n\nTawni: Check out Mr. Pushy!\n\nSonny: Check out Mr. Pushy's pants.\n\nTawni: His pants? Check out Mr. Pushy's-\n\nGrady: Ugh! Forget it! (leaves)\n\nSonny: Check it out, he was kinda cute.\n\nTawni: Check you out! He was a robber!\n\nSonny: Not a good one!\n\nTawni: Right? Maybe he'll come back tomorrow.\n\nSonny: Ooh! And then we could recheck him out!\n\nSonny: Check out dance?\n\nTawni: Check out dance.\n\nTawni: Are you insulting me with geometry?\n\nMarshal: Hello Connie, what brings you down?\n\nConnie: Oh, rainy days, sad movies. Let's see, my daughter's math grades. We need to talk.\n\nSonny: Are you sure you don't want to talk about rainy days?\n\nMarshal: You two go. It's beautiful thing, these mother daughter talks.\n\nConnie: You too Marshal.\n\nMarshal: It's beautiful thing, these mother, daughter, Marshal talks.\n\nMs. Bitterman: Don't forget you have a geometry test coming up. For everyone but Zora, that means circles ands squares.\n\nMs. Bitterman: So Sonny do you know why you are here?\n\nSonny: No.\n\nMs. Bitterman: Seriously I need you to tell me, honestly I don't know I'm completely lost.\n\nConnie: Well I'll tell you why were here, Sonny can you tell me what the first letter in disappointment is? [Shows a test paper marked with a D]\n\nMarshal: Well at least she didn't Fisappiont you. 'fisappoint' it starts with an F and that's worse than a D. Sonny you're mother asked you a question.\n\nTawni: The name of the sketch is 'The Check it out Girls'. I can't do it alone.\n\nSonny: Are you saying you need me?\n\nTawni: No, I'm saying I already asked Marshal and he said I can't do it alone.\n\nTawni: Insult me again.\n\nSonny: You're a rhombus!\n\nTawni: I'm a what?\n\nSonny: A parallelogram with four equals sides!\n\nSonny: Check it out, we still have time!\n\nTawni: Check it out! We're going to make it on the show!\n\n(The door closes.)\n\nSonny: No! Check it out, it's closed!\n\nAnnouncer: Are you ready to get So Random?!\n\nTawni: (whines)\n\nSonny: I've got an idea. Hurry.\n\nTawni: (follows Sonny but stops when she sees her picture on the door) Wait, where did that come from? (tries to wipe a smudge off her picture)\n\nSonny: (climbing a ladder) Come on!\n\nTawni: Sorry. (climbs the ladder) Move it! Move it! Move it!\n\nSonny: Hurrying!\n\n(On top of the Check it Out Girls set.)\n\nSonny: (pushing ropes aside) Careful. Careful.\n\nTawni: What's with all these ropes?\n\n(The theme music starts of the Check It Out Girls starts.)\n\nSonny: That's our theme music! (shaking her head to the music with Tawni) Hurry!\n\nTawni: (follows Sonny)\n\nGrady: So check this out. Yesterday I got a manicure. Check it out!\n\nTawni: Check out our break being over!\n\n(Audience applauds.)\n\nSonny: Check out the snake.\n\nTawni: No you check out the snake.\n\nSonny: You check out the snake.\n\nTawni: No you check out the snake.\n\nSonny: Check out neither of us checking out the snake!\n\nChad: So I, uh, guess I'll be seeing you at my party tonight?\n\nSonny: Yeah. As much as I'd love to come bask in the glory of your Chadness, I can't make it.\n\nChad: So you were the no? You were the one person I invited who's not coming? Wow. I always knew this would happen to me someday. I just really expected it to come from a Tisdale or a Montana.\n\nChad: (at his party) Hey, Sonny. Glad you could make it. Did you get me a gift?\n\nSonny: See, I didn't really have time to shop.\n\nChad: Yeah. Security!\n\nSonny: Wait. I'm here to apologize to my best friend.\n\nChad: Oh, that's so sweet. Security!\n\nLucy: Sonny there you... (gasps) Oh my Chad. It's you! It's him!\n\nChad: It's us. (referring to his cardboard cut out) Now if you don't mind he needs a shave.(referring to when Nico and Grady drew a beard on his cut out)\n\nLucy: He's even cuter than his cardboard cut out.\n\nAt the prop house: [Tawni, Nico and Grady are all on their phones and Zora is on the internet.]\n\nSonny: You guys, come on. Get off the Internet. We have to come up with a sketch for this week's show.\n\n[Everyone ignores her.]\n\nSonny: You're not even listening to me.\n\n[Everyone still ignores her.]\n\nSonny: You're not even listening to me when I'm telling you you're not listening to me.\n\nTawni: You know what hurts the most? That you would actually have the same dress as me.\n\nSonny: Okay. We'll go through everything in my closet and make sure Sharona never catches us in the same outfit again. [picks up a outfit] So do you have anything like this?\n\nTawni: [makes a gagging face]\n\nSonny: Okay, this one's safe. [picks up a skort] What about these?\n\nTawni: Kuwats?\n\nSonny: It's a skort. You know, shorts in the back, skirt in the front. It's like a mullet for your butt. [smiles]\n\nTawni: [makes a gagging expression again]\n\nSonny: Okay, so what are you wearing to the Oh No You Didn't awards? [smiles]\n\nTawni: Shame and a strapless party dress. But mostly shame.\n\nSonny: Tawni, come on. Sharona's had her fun. She'll never pit us against each other again. It's over.\n\nZora: [opens the vent] This just in. Sharona says: \"Sonny's hair is fab and Tawni's hair is drab.\"\n\nTawni: [opens her mouth in shock and turns to Sonny]\n\nSonny: [flips her hair] Okay now it's over.\n\nTawni: [looks at her cellphone with Sonny] How could Sharona compare these two photos?\n\nTawni: She used my picture from the Bad Hair Day sketch and yours is touched up and pretty.\n\nSonny: Actually that's my picture from my student ID. Didn't it turn out good?\n\nTawni: [crying] My clothes are ugly, my hair is ugly. My entire life is ugly! I need a tissue.\n\nSonny: Here, just use my skort.\n\nTawni: Even the things I blow my nose into are ugly!\n\nSonny: [enters her dressing room with sad violin music playing] Hey Tawni, are you ready to go back to rehers-AHHH! [covers her mouth in shock]\n\nTawni: [sitting by her mirror with no hair]\n\nSonny: You shaved your head.\n\nTawni: Actually it's a bald cap. But symbolically yes, I did shave my head.\n\nSonny: Sharona has driven you into wearing a bald cap?\n\nTawni: If I don't have the best hair, I might as well have no hair at all! [sits down]\n\nSonny: Well what does it say? Look she-she wrote things on the meat. [reads the meat] \"Meat. Dead. You're.\" [realizes something] You're dead meat! She's threatening us!\n\nTawni: Oh no! She wrote on the sausages too! [reads the sausages] \"If any of you show your faces at the Oh No You Didn'ts, I will tear you all to pieces! Sharona.\"\n\nSonny: Come on, we're not really afraid of her. Are we Tawni?\n\nTawni: I'm a little afraid.\n\nSonny: Yeah me too.\n\nZora: Oh no! She's thinking again!\n\nChad: [reading] \"Thanks for the memories. Nico and Grady.\" Do I know a Nico and Grady?\n\nSonny: (meatball sauce on her mouth) Hi mom.\n\nSantiago Heraldo: Hold on. So nice girl from Wisconsin is tight with the Hollywood bad boy?\n\nSonny: Well, I wouldn't say we were--\n\nChad: Oh, we're very good friends.\n\nSonny: Actually, we can't stand each other.\n\nChad: And this is the kind of fun we get to have every day.\n\nSonny: Which apparently is starting today.\n\nChad: Isn't she adorable? That's why Sonny's my favorite member of So Random.\n\nSonny: Really?\n\nChad: Yes, really. Santiago you are lucky to be getting this interview this girl's going places. Speaking of which I got to go.\n\nSantiago Heraldo: You've got some dog's to shove.\n\nChad: Shoving dogs towards bowls of food that I lovingly lay out for them. You know why I love puppies.\n\nSonny: (after Chad hands her a puppy) Oh, he's so cute!\n\nChad: Yeah, when I saw him I thought of you.\n\nSonny: That's a compliment, right?\n\nChad: Of course.\n\nGrady: (with meat sauce on his face) I love meatball Monday.\n\nTawni (walks in) Here's a Tawni tip for you. It's even tastier if some of it lands in your mouth.\n\nGrady: Yeah, well (pointing at face) I'm saving this for later\n\nSonny: Can I have that seat? (girl moves)\n\nChad: Wow. You are workin' the diva thing.\n\nSonny: I'm not a diva, Chad.\n\nChad: I know that.\n\nSonny: Well, then tell Santiago. I want people to know me for who I am.\n\nChad: And I want people to know me for who I'm not. Look, I like you. And I'm sorry the rest of the world doesn't know the real you.\n\nSonny: It's your fault.\n\nChad: Is it, Sonny? Is it, really?\n\nSonny: Yes. It is. Really!\n\nChad: (Sonny shows up where he's building dog houses) I know what you're doing.\n\nSonny: Do you, Chad? Do you really?\n\nChad: (after Sonny busts him) Well played, Monroe.\n\nSonny: Props accepted.\n\nChad: We should hang out sometime.\n\nSonny: Camera's off, Chad.\n\nChad: I know. (they smile at each other)\n\nSonny: Well at least there is some variety. (sees someone with a taco) That looks tasty. (looks up and sees a cute guy) That looks really tasty! I meant the food on your plate.\n\nSonny: The teapot has a name. It's Sonny.\n\nJames: Yes you are. What's your name?\n\nSonny: Smooth...\n\nJames: Yes I am.\n\n[Sonny gets a huge smile]\n\nJames: You can call me James.\n\nChad: Sonny.\n\nSonny: Chad.\n\nChad: [to James] Anyway they're shooting our scene we should probably go.\n\nSonny [to James] Oh, you're on Mackenzie Falls this week? Let me guess, stuck up Mackenzie being chased by bad boy bank robber.\n\nChad: Let me guess, Life of the Boston Tea Party.\n\nSonny: Well, at least my show brings joy to the viewers.\n\nChad: At least my show has viewers.\n\nJames: Wow. What's goin' on here?\n\nChad: Nothing.\n\nSonny: It's beyond nothing.\n\nChad: It's certainly nothing to be late over. Our scene's up first after lunch. Sonny.\n\nSonny: Chad. (Chad walks away)\n\nJames: You know, for something you said was nothing, that sure seemed like something.\n\nSonny: Oh, well, you know, it's a day-to-day something. Sometimes hour-by-hour. I don't know, it's complicated. He's complicated.\n\nJames: Well, I'm not. My name's James Conroy, and I'd like to take you out tonight.\n\nSonny: Well, there's nothing complicated about that.\n\nJames: So I can take that as a yes?\n\nSonny: You can take that as a maybe.\n\nTawni: [Puts a scarf on the neck] Beyoncé. [Puts a scarf on the forhead] Tyra. And a pirate! Arrr!\n\n[Sonny comes in and sighs]\n\nTawni: What are you all sighed about?\n\nSonny: Oh, was I sighing? Sorry.\n\n[Then Sonny starts humming]\n\nTawni: Ah! Now you're humming!\n\nSonny: Was I humming? Sorry again.\n\n(Sonny smiles)\n\nTawni: Ok, that's not just sighing and humming. That's boy sighing and humming! Who asked you out?\n\nSonny: Well I'm not gonna brag but... JAMES CONROY!\n\nTawni: James Conroy?\n\nSonny: Yes!\n\nTawni: No!\n\nSonny: No?\n\nTawni: No!\n\nSonny: Why?\n\n.Tawni: Because...\n\nSonny: Because why?\n\nTawni: Because, my best friend dated him and he dumped her. It wasn't pretty. Her face broke out and she started using poly extra pants.\n\nSonny: Look, I doubt anything is gonna happen between James and me.\n\nTawni: Let me guess. He asked you out and you said no?\n\nSonny: Yes.\n\nTawni: That's how it starts. You say no and he turns on the charm!\n\nMan: Sonny Munroe, bouquet of flowers for you at the front desk.\n\nTawni: And here comes the charm!\n\n(Tawni and Sonny have the bouquet)\n\nSonny: Wow! (Sonny reads a card) \"Hi teapot.\" Ow. \"It was nice meeting you. Any chances we can go out tonight? Your bad boy, James.\" You know, maybe is not such a jerk after all.\n\nTawni: Oh right. Maybe I'm ugly. Use your brain!\n\nSonny: Look, I appreciate the warning, but maybe your friend and James didn't had chemistry.\n\n(Sonny's phone rings and she answers)\n\nSonny: Chad? What do you want Chad?\n\nJames: It's James.\n\nSonny: [To Tawni] It's James.\n\nTawni: Hang up.\n\nSonny: Hey James. How's it going? I loved the flowers! They're so beautiful.\n\nJames: It was my pleasure.\n\n(Chad sees James with his phone)\n\nChad: Dude, is that my phone?\n\nJames: Oh, yeah it is. Thanks. (To Sonny) I gotta make this fast. Do you wanna go out tonight?\n\nSonny: Tonight?\n\nTawni: No no no.\n\nSonny: I'd love to.\n\nJames: Cool.\n\nSonny: Cool.\n\nJames: Bye.\n\nSonny: Bye.\n\nJames: You hang up first.\n\nSonny: No you hang up.\n\nTawni: I'll hang up!\n\n(Twani hangs up the phone)\n\nTawni: Fine, don't listen to me. But when you're heart is broken into a milion pieces and spread all over the floor, just remember. Tawni Hart doesn't vacuem.\n\nTawni: Where's your idiot friend?\n\nChad: Bart! [Bart comes out]\n\nTawni: Not that idiot. James. Yeah, the one who's going out with Sonny tonight.\n\nChad: I'm sorry, what?\n\nTawni: James, Sonny, date, tonight.\n\nChad: Date? Sonny? Tonight? James?\n\nTawni: So where is he?\n\nChad: Right now he's breaking into the first bank of MacKenzie Falls. [sirens go]\n\nJames: [Off camera] Give me all your money!\n\nTawni: What is your show even about?\n\nChad: Oh, this week's our Christmas episode. Yeah, in the end he realizes he had a wonderful life.\n\nTawni: Look, just tell James to back off of Sonny.\n\nChad: Why do you want him to back off Sonny?\n\nTawni: Why are you wearing a bib?\n\nChad: Jealous?\n\nTawni: I have my own bib!\n\nChad: Not of the bib, of Sonny! What...?\n\nTawni: No. I'm trying to protect her. Why do you want him to back off Sonny?\n\nChad: I... never said I did.\n\nTawni: Oh, your lips say I don't care, but your eyes say I do care! So, you just tell your friend to back off from Tawni Hart! ...Well not back off from me, back off from me, Tawni Hart!\n\n(James and Sonny are looking at the menu)\n\nSonny: So, what looks good?\n\nJames: You.\n\n(Tawni arrives)\n\nTawni: Sorry I'm late!\n\nSonny: Tawni?\n\nJames: Tawni?\n\nTawni: James. So, what did I missed?\n\nSonny: An invitation. What are you doing here?\n\nTawni: I like chicken fingers and skiball.\n\nChad: Uh, sorry I'm late. What did I missed?\n\nJames: Tawni likes chicken fingers and skiball! What are you doing here?\n\nChad: Can't be hanging out with a bro? (looks at Tawnie) So what are you doing here?\n\nTawni: What are YOU doing here?\n\nJames: (to Sonny) What are they doing here?\n\nSonny: What are we still doing here?\n\nSonny: Do you really think I would kiss you?\n\nChad: Well that's what I'm gonna put on my blog. (Rolls across arcade floor) Peace out suckas! Blahaa!\n\nJames Conroy: [Tawni and Sonny are fighting about James] Oh, she is so cute when she's angry!\n\nChad: Sonny's always cute. She can't do anything without it being cute. Stupid cute!\n\nJames: No dude! I'm talking about TAWNI!\n\nSonny: Quick! Hold my hand! [grabs Chad's hand]\n\nChad: Don't tell me what to do!\n\nSonny: We're on a fake date. We have to make it look believable.\n\nChad: Well, if you wanna hold hands you have to switch sides.\n\nSonny: Why?\n\nChad: 'Cause this is my holding hand. [holds up other hand]\n\nSonny: Fine. And just so you know, this is our first and last fake date.\n\nChad: Good.\n\nSonny: Good! Now smile like you're having the time of your life. [walk over to their table with huge smiles]\n\nJames: [To Tawni] You know I was surprised when you said yes.\n\nTawni: Well, you texted you called. You just don't let a girl say no, do you bad boy?\n\nJames: No. [Notices Sonny and Chad flirting with each other] You've got to be kidding me! She's already on a date? Man, she works fast!\n\nTawni: Let's not talk about Sonny and how she's completely over you. Let's talk about... Me! And how much I'm into you! I like us!\n\nJames: Really...\n\n'Tawni: Lookie! I just changed my online status to 're dating James Conroy'. And I got into your account and changed your status to 'Crazy for Tawni Heart!'\n\nSonny: [James and Tawni look at them] They're looking this way. Put your arm around me.\n\nChad: Well, I would, but you sat on the wrong side. This arm says let's cuddle, and this arm says 'Hey, good game bro!'\n\nSonny: Well, I'm saying just put one of them around me. (Chad puts his arm around Sonny)\n\nChad: Oh, you should probably put your head on my shoulder.\n\nSonny: Okay. (puts her head on Chad's shoulder) This is nice... in theory.\n\nChad: We, uh ... make a good couple. Hypothetically.\n\n'Tawni: You know what I want? Potato skins. And to go to Paris with you in the spring!\n\nJames: That's four months from now, who knows what I- I mean we- I mean you- Will be doing by then? [starts texting and looks up at Sonny]\n\n[Grady and Nico enter]\n\nGrady: There she is.\n\nNico: Granted it won't be as good as the froyo, but a mushy is a close second.\n\nGrady: It won't be as creamy, but at least I'll still be able to feel the frozen goodness. [They walk over to the Mushy machine]\n\n[Nico notices Sonny and Chad flirting with each other]\n\nNico: Check that out...\n\nGrady: [still talking about the mushy machine] I see it. I could almost taste it.\n\nNico: Not that! Over there. Sonny and Chad...\n\nGrady: What? Woah!\n\nSonny: Ha! I just got a text! From... You?\n\nChad: What? That jerk still has my phone?\n\nSonny: And he already wants me back!\n\nChad: [disappointed] Already...\n\n[Niko and Grady join Sonny And Chad at their table]\n\nNiko: Well, well well.\n\nSonny: Uhhh...\n\nGrady: You guys on a date?\n\nSonny:It's fake.\n\nGrady: Then why didn't you ask one of us to be your fake date?\n\nNico: Obviously, she doesn't think we're good enough to be her fake date.\n\nGrady: Either one of us would've made a much better fake date than Chip Drama-pants over here.\n\nChad: I don't think so.\n\nNico: Wooooooww Chip!\n\nSonny: Alright, can we talk about this later?\n\nNico: Fine. But just so you know, I've been in 3, 4, 5 fake relationships, so I could've helped you with your little fake date.\n\nJames: Oh, so this is a fake date.\n\nSonny: No! This is real. As real as can be.\n\nGrady: So you're lying to us.\n\nSonny: No!\n\nJames: So you're lying to me?\n\nSonny: No! Would I do this if I were on a fake date? [Puts her hand over Chad's mouth and kisses him]\n\nChad: So...are you having fun on your date?\n\nJames: I was! Until it was rudely interrupted! (referring to Chad)\n\nChad: I know! Tawni's a piece of work right?\n\nSonny: And 3 mini muffins for the little girl from \"Children having a Dream\" foundation.\n\nTawni: (holding up a magazine with the \"Mackenzie Falls\" cast) Three pictures of \"Mackenzie Falls\" and no Tawni. (flipping the pages) No Tawni, no Tawni. NO TAWNI! (closes the magazine)\n\nSonny: Bananas. If the girl is needed, I'm sure she'll \"needed\" some potassium. Hahaha.\n\n(Tawni tries to take a banana, but Sonny hits her in the arm)\n\nSonny: Hey. They're not for you! They're for Dakota. The underprivileged girl is gonna spend a dream day at \"So Random\".\n\nTawni: I'm underprivileged.\n\nSonny: You're underphotographed not underprivileged.\n\nTawni: Underphotographed is much worse. Do I get a muffin basket? No!\n\nSonny: Let's focus on what's important here. As the embassador of fun, I promised her the best day ever.\n\nTawni: Who nominated you as the embassador of fun?\n\nSonny: Well, I did. I even have a hat. (Sonny puts on a hat) Embassador of fun. (pointing to the hat)\n\nTawni: Oww, is this the little darling from the children's foundation?\n\n(Zora opens her sarcophagus)\n\nZora: Ow. EVIL.\n\nSonny: Zora, she is not evil. She might have anger issues, but mostly she's...\n\nDakota: Disappointed!\n\nTawni: Because you got stuck with Sonny? Friend, I know how you feel.\n\nDakota: No! I'm disappointed that none of you is Chad Dylan Cooper!\n\n\"So Random\" cast: Ahhh!\n\nGrady: Well, ahaha, according to the world wibe web, we are much cooler that Chad Dylan!\n\nDakota: Hahaha. This isn't it about cool! It's about HOT! Chad Dylan Cooper is HOT!!! Get out of my way, old ladie! (pushes Tawni away)\n\nDakota: My daddy thinks I'm and angle.\n\nZora: Obviously he doesn't has a very good sense of direction.\n\nTawni: [holding up magazine showing MacKenzie Falls cast in cool places] And who do you see there? And there, and there, and there! [flipping through magazine]\n\nGrady: Chad Dylan Cooper, and the cast of MacKenzie Falls.\n\nNico: Yeah, she's right we need to be seen in cool places.\n\nTawni: Yes, that's why we're going to a place so cool, so exclusive, so underground, it doesn't even exist.\n\nGrady: We're going to Narnia?\n\n[Later - The Basement - Tawni dancing]\n\nGrady: [holding a sword] This isn't Narnia!\n\nZora: [scooting past Chad and Dakota] Evil!\n\nChad: (Chad's voicemail) Hey you've reached Chad Dylan Cooper. Sorry I can't come to the phone right now, because if you were important enough, you'd have the number to my phone I answer!\n\nSonny: Let's go get some ice-cream\n\n(Dakota roll's her eyes)\n\nChad: (scared) Oh Daddy?\n\nSonny: Daddy, there's your funny little punchline! Boy is he gonna be mad at you for yelling at his daughter!\n\nMr. Condor: Sonny, you brought my precious angel to a Hollywood club?\n\n(Sonny and Chad start backing away)\n\nChad: Looks like he's mad at you.\n\nMr. Condor: Oh no, he's mad at you too!\n\nSonny: Actually Mr. Condor, it's a really funny story!\n\nChad: Trust me it's really not that funny.\n\nChad: Whoa, watch it.\n\nSonny: Chad? Oh my gosh what happened? (refers to Chad's black eye)\n\nChad: Oh, I just got in a huge fight over at the Falls.\n\nSonny: (nods) They don't like you either?\n\nChad: Funny. No we were shooting a scene. I know it's hard to believe I can look this good when I look this bad huh? (Sonny looks down) Normally that would've charmed you. What's up with you?\n\nSonny: Nothing, I'm just a little bummed. I missed my prom back home and I just got some pictures from my best friend.\n\nChad: Oh pshht. You're not missing much! I've been to a bunch of proms and they have all ended in disaster.\n\nSonny: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.\n\nChad: Yeah, episode 10, my hair caught on fire. Last year's season finale, my date turns out to be my long lost sister...\n\nSonny: What? Chad those are fake proms.\n\nChad: Fake proms, real proms they all stink.\n\nSonny: No they don't! They're romantic! You know a girl dreams her whole life about going to the prom and sharing that perfect dance with a very special guy.\n\nChad: And then he gets hit in the head by a faulty disco ball, episode 16!\n\nSonny: You know what Chad? you wouldn't know real romance if it punched you in the face. In fact you wouldn't know a real punch in the face if it punched you in the face, because there is nothing real about you.\n\nChad: Well here's something real for you, I really don't wanna stand here and talk to you.\n\nSonny: Good! Cause I really don't wanna stand here and talk to you!\n\nChad: Good!\n\nSonny: Good!\n\nChad: Good! (Sonny and Chad turn and walk different directions) (Chads phone rings) Hello?\n\nSonny: Good!\n\n(Chad's phone rings)\n\nChad: Hello (Sonny on the phone)\n\nSonny: Good!\n\n(On the prop house)\n\nSonny: (Chad on the phone) Good!\n\nChad: Good!\n\nSonny: Good!\n\nChad: Good!\n\nSonny: Good and goodbye!\n\n(Sonny hangs up)\n\nSonny: (to the cast) Chad says \"hi\".\n\nTawni: What did he really said?\n\nSonny: Well, he said that all proms stink! They don't stink. You guys know that. (The cast looks confused) Oh my gosh, you don't know that! You've never been to a prom?\n\nTawni: I've been working since my first diaper commercial.\n\nZora: I'm eleven.\n\nNico: I was on the road doing my one man show.\n\nGrady: \"NICO\".\n\nSonny: Well, we're gonna change all that. Because I'm thinking we can have our own prom!\n\nGrady: You mean a prom sketch?\n\nSonny: No. Like a real prom. Dancing and twinkling lights and a really cool theme!\n\nNico: Girls.\n\nSonny: That's not a theme, Nico.\n\nNico: I know. I was just thinking about girls.\n\nSonny: And I'm thinking we have a really cool theme! Something fantastice, something magical, something we've all dreamed about.\n\nTawni: \"Tawni Town\"!\n\n--- (Sonny's phone rings)\n\nSonny: (Chad on the phone) Hello.\n\nChad: Good.\n\n(Sonny hangs up furious)\n\nSonny: Well, Chad, you were right. All proms end in disaster.\n\nChad: Do they Sonny? Do they really? 'Cause sometimes I heard, you get to have that perfect dance, with that one special person. [takes out headphones] You're just going to have to settle for me.\n\n[Chad and Sonny start dancing]\n\nSonny: [giggles] This is sweet!\n\nChad: I have my moments.\n\nSonny: You're gonna press play?\n\nChad: Oh right, sorry!\n\n--- (At the prop house)\n\nNico: You had to ask Marshall.\n\nZora: Always gotta do everything by the book.\n\nSonny: Oh yeah? Is that what you think? (the cast waves \"yes\") Is that what you all think? (The cast says \"yes\") Well, I, just checked out a new book. And it's called \"We're having a secret prom= by Sonny Munroe!\n\nNico: Are you suggesting...\n\nSonny: That's right. A secret prom.\n\nTawni: A secret prom?\n\nZora: A secret prom?\n\nNico: A secret prom?\n\nGrady: A secr...\n\nSonny: Ok, I think we've said enough times.\n\nChad: Oh, hey Sonny.\n\nSonny: Sorry Chad, can't talk, I'm in a hurry.\n\nChad: Oh right, right that whole secret prom, [Sonny turns around] They're not that much of a secret when every kid on the lot is walking around with fliers that read 'Secret Prom!'\n\nSonny: Aren't you exited? I'm even exited about how exited I am!\n\nChad: Yeah, we're not really feeling that over at the Falls...mostly we just think it's dumb?\n\nSonny: Well, if you think it's so dumb, then maybe you and your little snobby friends at Mackenzie Falls shouldn't come.\n\nChad: Well maybe we won't.\n\nSonny: Good! 'Cause your officially uninvited.\n\nChad: Good 'Cause we officially wouldn't have come anyway.\n\nSonny: You're only saying that cause I just uninvited you.\n\nChad: You only uninvited me because I just said I didn't wanna come.\n\nSonny: Are we done here?\n\nChad: Oh we're beyond done.\n\nSonny: Good!\n\nChad: Good!\n\nSonny: Good!\n\nChad: Good!\n\nSonny: So we're good?\n\nChad: Oh we're so good.\n\nTawni: Hey Sonny. You're not suddenly interested on being prom queen. Right?\n\nSonny: No.\n\nTawni: Ok, then. You look really pretty.\n\n(Sonny does a big smile)\n\nSonny: Well, Chad, you were right. All proms end in disaster.\n\nChad: Do they Sonny? Do they really? 'Cause sometimes I heard, you get to have that perfect dance, with that one special person. [takes out headphones] You're just going to have to settle for me.\n\n[Chad and Sonny start dancing]\n\nSonny: [giggles] This is sweet!\n\nChad: I have my moments.\n\nSonny: You're gonna press play?\n\nChad: Oh right, sorry!\n\nChad: Then you and me are going to have to go to Lookout Mountain.\n\nSonny: I'm not going to Lookout Mountain with you. That's a date place.\n\nChad: Do you want them broken up?\n\nSonny: Yes.\n\nChad: Pick you up at eight. (winks at Sonny)\n\nSonny: (smiles)\n\nSonny: How it this suppose to break up Bitterman and Marshall?\n\nChad: It's all in the script.\n\nSonny: What script?!\n\nChad: (takes out Mackenzie falls script) Episode 319 of Mackenzie Falls! Bigfoot gets the girl, it's a classic!\n\nSonny: (takes script away from Chad) Oh my gosh! This is your plan? This isn't real! This is a show!\n\nChad: Sonny, sometimes life imitates art! Okay? And this piece of art happens to be about a couple who takes a drive up Lookout Mountain for a romantic evening...\n\nNico: Yeah, and then Bigfoot comes out the woods and scares them!\n\nChad: Yeah, and the guy gets so freaked out, he runs away.\n\nSonny: And that gets the girl to break up with him...\n\nChad: Exactly!\n\nSonny: Oh my gosh...THAT IS THE WORST PLAN I'VE EVER HEARD FROM THE WORST SHOW I'VE NEVER SEEN! (Chad looks insulted)\n\nChad: Well, here come the lovebirds, so unless you like the chewy tastes of worms...\n\nSonny: Nico, put your head back on!\n\nSonny': With this. (holds up a salt shaker)\n\nGrady: A magic salt shaker?\n\nSonny: If anyone gets caught eat the instructions! Got any questions? (Grady raises his hand) Yes Grady?\n\nGrady: What happens if I've already eaten lunch? I'm kinda full. Do I still have to eat the instructions?\n\nSonny: Yes.\n\nGrady: Well can you put the instructions on cake?\n\nSonny: No!\n\nGrady: Cookies?\n\nSonny: No! NOW GO! GO! GO!\n\n(Nico and Grady march out the room)\n\nSonny:(to Tawni) You wanna go get some cake?\n\nTawni: Ooh...and cookies.\n\nSonny: I can't just come between love.\n\nTawni: I don't want you to come between it, I want you to crush it!\n\nSonny: Guys I have a confession to make. I asked for a cup of water but I filled it up with soda. (sees that it's not Nico, Grady and Tawni) And you're not Nico, Grady or Tawni. (laughs nervously) I was-I was kidding about the soda. (goes to another table when she think she sees the real Grady) Guys the weirdest thing just happened to me and it's happening again! (sees more Nico, Grady and Tawni lookalikes) Oh no. It's that dream where I end up on t.v. wearing nothing but a hat. (checks if she's in a dream)\n\nGrady: (walks in the cafeteria with Nico) (referring to someone that looks like Nico) What is up Nico? My man, my man! You were great in that Gassie sketch. Just funny.\n\nNico: I'm standing right next you.\n\nGrady: No you're not. You're right there standing next to me. (sees two people that look like them then gasps) Dude, this means our time machine has worked!\n\nNico: That wasn't a time machine! It was a clock! And that ain't you! And those aren't Sonnies! And those aren't-\n\nTawni: (gasps) Then who the heck are you people?\n\nNico: Now that's definitely Tawni.\n\nGrady: That's Tawni.\n\nNico: What is going on in here? (sees the real Sonny) Uh Sonny are we in your stupid hat dream?\n\nSonny: I have no idea what's going on.\n\nSonny: Chad what is all this and I should've known you were behind it.Why are you all dressed up like a paper boy?\n\nChad: I'm casting a TV movie about my life. \"Chad Dylan Cooper: the Chad Dylan Cooper's story, Chad Dylan Cooper production.\n\nChad: Hi, you must be Sonny, I'm Chad.\n\nSonny: (reading the script) Oh my gosh! You're Chad Dylan Cooper! Possibly the greatest actor of our generation! (stops reading) Are you kidding me with this?\n\nChad: Sonny, I'm giving you a chance here, okay? Just read the lines. Let's just jump to the part where Sonny punches my costar. AND ACTION!\n\nSonny: I never punched your costar.\n\nChad: (singsong) Diva!\n\nSonny: Are you kidding me? I'm so not a diva!\n\nChad: Really, Sonny? Really?\n\nSonny: You know what? This is ridiculous. I'm out of here.\n\nChad: Fine!\n\nSonny: Fine!\n\nChad: Good!\n\nSonny: Good! And good luck trying to find a better me than me. Because nobody knows me the way that I know me. (opens the door and sees Selena Gomez)\n\nSonny: (shocked) Oh my gosh! Selena Gomez!\n\nSelena: (smiles)\n\nSonny: Can I get your autograph? Here, sign this lousy script.\n\nSelena: (walks past Sonny) Hey Chad. I got your text. And yes, I'll play the part of Sonny.\n\nSonny: (shocked) What?!\n\nSelena: Personally I think the character's kind of dull but I'll liven her up. (turns to Sonny) And you are?\n\nSonny: The dull girl that you need to liven up.\n\nChad: (speaks through the megaphone) Awkward.\n\nSonny: (walking to table with snacks with Selena following her) Can I help you?\n\nSelena: No, no. Carry on.\n\n(Sonny picks up a cup and Selena picks up a cup then Sonny puts the cup down and so does Selena. Sonny and Selena then pick up a snack and throw it behind them and Selena's snack hits a guy. The guy runs off scared. Sonny does a dance and Selena just stares at her.)\n\nSelena: (into tape recorder) Not a very good dancer.\n\nSonny: What are you doing and why are you saying things about me into a recorder?\n\nSelena: Well if I'm going to play you I want to play you honestly and realistically. (into tape recorder) Flat hair.\n\nSonny: My hair is not flat!\n\nSelena: (into tape recorder) Defensive about hair.\n\nSonny: Would you stop?\n\nSelena: Look, I'm sorry. It's just that I really like to get into my characters.\n\nSonny: Oh, I know how you feel. One time I played a dog in a sketch. I got so into my character (laughs) I dug a hole in the backyard.\n\nSelena: (laughs)\n\nSonny: And then I ate my homework. Oh then I bit the mailman!\n\nSelena: (laughs)\n\nSonny: Well, if someone has to play me I'm glad it's Selena Gomez.\n\nSelena: Aww, thank you.\n\nSonny: If there's anything you want to know about me, just ask.\n\nSelena: I just want to know...are you mad at me because I got the part and you didn't?\n\nSonny: What? (high pitched) Girl, no. No.\n\nSelena: (into tape recorder) Voice gets high when in denial.\n\nSonny: (high pitched) I am not- (low pitched) I am not in denial. Look you don't know Chad. It's just...this is so typical of him. He just wants to push my buttons.\n\nSelena: (into tape recorder) Has buttons.\n\nSelena: Okay, now we're about to do the scene when you barge in the set of MacKenzie Falls. Now when this happened, do you remember how you felt?\n\nSonny: Probably mad because I'm always mad when I have to go see Chad.\n\nSelena: Right, but clearly you're mad at yourself because of how much you like him.\n\nSonny: Right...WHAT?! I don't like Chad! (low pitched) I mean, I don't like Chad.\n\nSelena: (shows Sonny the script) Sure you do. It's right here in the script.\n\nSonny: What?! Give me that! (takes the script and reads it) All it says is, \"Fine! Fine! Good! Good! Fine! Fine!\"\n\nSelena: It's not what the lines say. It's what's between the lines.\n\nSonny: (scoffs) There is nothing between those lines. Trust me.\n\nSelena: (holding her tape recorder)\n\nSonny: (takes the tape recorder) Now hear this. I'm not indenial. Which, I know sounds like I'm indenial but I'm not. So.....we're good. (gives the tape recorder back)\n\nChad: (walks in and talks through megaphone) Okay people. Here we go. Chad Dylan Cooper: The Chad Dylan Cooper Story. Sonny Barges in Mackenzie Falls Set: Take 1. (to Selena) Ms. Gomez, on your mark if you please.\n\nSelena: (gets ready to do the scene)\n\nChad: Thank you. (to Sonny in megaphone) No extras on set.\n\nSonny: (leaves the set)\n\nChad: Okay people. I want to see real energy and real emotion. And ACTION! (gives his megaphone, scarf and beret to Bart and prepares for the scene) Look Portlyn, summer's almost over and once the falls come back to the Falls I need to be free. Shh. Time for talking is over.\n\nSelena: (walks on set) What's the matter with you?!\n\nChad: What's the matter with me?! What's the matter with.....Wait those words didn't come out of your mouth.\n\nSelena: You've got great legs Portlyn. Let's see how they move. (punches Portlyn and Portlyn falls on a chair)\n\nSonny: Hey! I never punched-\n\nBart: (to Sonny) Shhhh!\n\nChad: What do you think you're doing? You can't just barge in here and interrupt Chad Dylan Cooper when he's in the middle of making MacKenzie Falls magic.\n\nSelena: I think I made my point.\n\nChad: Good.\n\nSelena: Good.\n\nChad: Fine.\n\nSelena: Fine. (jumps on Chad)\n\nChad: Goo-. Whoa.\n\nSonny: (shocked and takes the megaphone) Cut! Cut! Cut it out!\n\nSonny: I can't believe you kissed Chad! Where in the script does it say that 'Sonny kisses Chad?'\n\nSelena: It's not in the script. I told you, I wanted to play your character honestly.\n\nSonny: (laughs) And you think that I would kiss him?\n\nSelena: Yes I do.\n\nSonny: Well, I would never kiss him.\n\nSelena: In that scene?\n\nSonny: No! Not anywhere! Not in a scene, not in a dream. Not in car. Not near, not far, not here, not there, not anywhere- I'm rhyming aren't I? See, I do that when I don't want to kiss someone.\n\nSelena: Really, Sonny, really?\n\nSonny: Now you sound like Chad!\n\nSelena: Huh, well that line is in the script. Page eighteen, twenty two and twice on thirty nine.\n\nSonny: He does say that a lot. (both Sonny and Selena laugh)\n\nSelena: Well maybe it's because he has the same issues as you do.\n\nSonny: Wha-? Pfft! What are you? Some kind of expert on how people feel about each other? Some sort of relationship...wh-what's the word? [gasps] WIZARD! YES! You like to sprinkle your wizardy relationship dust over people who you think you know, but you don't! No, you don't! So you know what I say? I say good day wizard! [walks away then comes back] I say good day!\n\nSelena: [into recorder] Thinks I'm actually wizard.\n\nSonny: (wearing a wizard costume) Abracadabra!\n\nSelena: Oh what is this now?\n\nSonny: Well how do you like me playing you? Look at me, I'm Selena Gomez! I'm the relationship wizard! I know everything! Edgbono eutusis!\n\nSelena: Check it out! I'm Sonny from Wisconsin! I'm just an exploding ball of sunshine! Check it out! Check it out!\n\nSonny: Look at me! I'm Selena! I went to acting school so I could learn how to do this! Cashmerious appearous! [waves invisible wand in Selena's face] Yeah! It's an invisible wand!\n\nSelena: Well look at me! I'm Sonny and I'm ticking off the person who's playing me in a movie, and maybe I shouldn't because she can make me look really bad!\n\nSonny: Well look at me, I'm Selena and, I'd never do that to Sonny girl!\n\nChad: (to Selena) Hey Selena. (looks at Sonny) Hey Scary Potter.\n\nSonny: (frowns)\n\nChad: Don't mind me ladies. I'm just here to get a fresh beret and recharge my microphone. (switches berets and gets a new megaphone) [into megaphone] See ya on set. (leaves)\n\nSelena: I don't know what you see in that guy.\n\nSonny: Are you kidding me? I don't see anything in that guy and I wish you would stop insisting that I do.\n\nSelena: Well if you think I'm playing it wrong then maybe you should just show me.\n\nSonny: Fine, I will.\n\nSelena: Fine, you're hired.\n\nSonny: Fine!\n\nSelena: Good!\n\nSonny: Good!\n\nSelena: Fine!\n\nSonny: Fine! Great! Now we're doing it! (leaves)\n\nSelena: Oh.\n\n[Nico and Grady walk into the prophouse and find their lookalikes are gone.]\n\nNico: Hey, where'd we go? (Tawni walks in)\n\nTawni: I forgot something.\n\nGrady: Wha-[Tawni slaps him and walks out]\n\nNico: Oh, you're gonna need some ice for that.\n\nGrady: What did I do?\n\nChad: Oh Sonny, try to stop yourself from falling in love with me, I beg you.\n\nSonny: [rolls her eyes]\n\nSelena: I'm just a small town girl with a big town dream, and meeting you was the biggest dream of all.\n\nSonny: Okay, CUT CUT CUT CUT CUT CUT!\n\nChad: Again! Really?\n\nSelena: It's okay Chad. She's helping me out.\n\nSonny: Okay now Selena, remember your biggest dream is to be on So Random! Chad is just a monster who wakes you up! (glares at Chad) Oh and remember that you hate him! You just really, really hate him! [Chad glares at Sonny] Action. [walks off set]\n\nChad: Sonny-\n\nSonny: Oh and one more thing! He is the worst actor of our generation!\n\nChad: BART![Bart comes out and gives Chad a megaphone] CUT! CUT! Stop the lying!\n\nSonny: You stop the lying!\n\nChad: You stop the lying!\n\nSelena: STOP! STOP BEING- STOP, JUST STOP IT!\n\n(Chad and Sonny stop.)\n\nSelena: Gosh I was wrong! You too should never be together!\n\nSonny: Finally! I've been trying to tell her that all day!\n\nChad: You've been trying to tell her that? I've been trying to tell her that too!\n\nSonny: Well I told her first. She thinks she some relationship wizard.\n\nChad: Yeah with her wizardly magic beans. Look if I want to like you [through megaphone] then I will.\n\nSonny: Yeah and if I want to like you then [through megaphone] I will.\n\nChad: If I want to think you have pretty hair then I will.\n\nSonny: And if I want to think you have sparkly eyes then I will.\n\nChad: [In Megaphone] Yes so take that Selena!\n\nSonny: [In Megaphone] In your face Gomez!

Awww, she seems nice. I should call her.\n\nChad: Why? You're gonna become BFFs with Selena Gomez?\n\nSonny: Pfft... It could happen! So... do you really think I have pretty hair?\n\nChad: I dunno...

Everyone says there in cahoots. You win; I'm tired with this paranoia. Just prank me and get it over with.\n\nChad: Sorry, Sonny I'm already doing a prank. It's called Tawni's fake audition. It was actually inspired by your audition. I guess that makes you Chad's little helper.\n\nTawni: I'm Fashonita! That was perfect.\n\nChad: (laughing) Thanks for the idea Sonny.\n\nChad: Maple syrup? Really? Maple syrup?\n\nSonny: Chad, I'm sorry after you did something nice just to be nice..\n\nChad: I know! Syruped and feathered my friend, but don't worry. I'm planning on returning the favor.\n\nGrady: With some flowers?\n\nChad: With a prank?

We're your friends.\n\nChad: Ugh! Stupid cookie!\n\nSonny: I once had a friend who was a little bloomer. She was only one merit badge shy of becoming a full grown blossom scout. [Starts having flash back]\n\nMrs. Mongergoure: Sonny Monroe, you will NEVER be a Blossom Scout!!! [Rips of Sonny's stouch. Sonny starts crying. Flashback ends and Sonny if still crying.]\n\nSonny: My friend never got to realize her dream.\n\nTawni: I'm not really paying attention. And I can already tell this friend of yours is you.\n\nZora: Well would you or your friend like to buy a box of cookies?\n\nSonny: You know what put me down for a box\n\nZora: ONE STINKING BOX I'M TRYING TO BREAK THE COOKIE SELLING RECORD!\n\nZora: It's the only record I don't currently hold!\n\nGilroy: Please give it up for Chad Dylan Cooper!\n\n(Chad sits down)\n\nSonny: Hey! (whispering) What are you doing here?\n\nChad: (coughs) I'm here promoting my book.\n\nSonny: You wrote a book?\n\nChad: (scoffs) No, I read a book.\n\nGilroy: Hey, what are you two whispering about [pointing to Chad and Sonny] one of your \"secret dates\"?\n\n[Sonny and Chad laughs]\n\nChad: I'm just here to talk about my book.\n\nGilroy: Actually you're not; I wanted you both here so I could get your reaction to this. Let's roll the clip!\n\n[Chad, Sonny and Tawni all look towards screen; clip shows Chad and Sonny on set of Mackenzie Falls]\n\n[After clip]\n\nTawni: Whoa.\n\nSonny: Where did you get that?\n\nGilroy: Didn't know you were being filmed, huh? Apparently someone in Mackenzie Falls doesn't like Sonny very much. So as we say on the show...GOTCHA!\n\nSonny: What? You 'gotched' nothing, alright? That was totally taken out of context.\n\nGilroy: That's what I do! If I were to wait for things to be in context I would not have a show. Still, seems the two of you have little something, something going on... care to comment?\n\nSonny: Yup! Right after this commercial break!\n\nGilroy: We're not taking a break.\n\nSonny: Well, we are! Let's go. (drags Chad off stage)\n\nTawni: You're leaving me here by myself?\n\nSonny: Yes.\n\nTawni: YES!\n\nTawni: Rubber pencil!\n\nSonny: I can't believe Gilroy tried to do that to us!\n\nChad: That guy's a jerk. I can't believe I read that book for nothing.\n\nSonny: You know, Tawni and I made a pact earlier that we wouldn't tell anyone secrets, and I think that we should probably do the same thing.\n\nChad: Okay fine, I didn't read the book! [Sonny looks at him] Wha-oh, you were talking about the us, (Sonny nods) yeah, we don't have secrets!....Do we?\n\nSonny: Uh-I don't know, do we?\n\n[Sonny and Chad on the monitor]\n\nSonny: I mean, what is that, like us liking each other?\n\nChad: Yeah, I mean I don't really want to talk about my feelings in front of the live studio audience.\n\nSonny: Yeah, yeah yeah right, I mean especially feelings we've never talked about before.\n\nChad: Yeah..you have feelings?\n\nSonny: Do you have feelings?\n\nChad: I-I mean since you're really asking...it's just the two of us....\n\nSonny: Right! I mean there's no cameras this time or anything.\n\nChad: Yeah, I really...I just....\n\nSonny: No, listen. It's what I'm here for. [Chad smiles at her) You go first!\n\nChad: No you go first.\n\nSonny: No you g- ok same time.\n\nChad: Yeah.\n\nSonny: One... two...\n\nChad: I was gonna say that yeah, um, two and a half?\n\n[Tanwi grabs the remote and turns off camera]\n\nTawni: [After she steals Gilroy's remote and Gilroy tries to take it back]No no no! It's time for Tawni Talk! Have a seat!\n\n[Gilroy sits down.]:\n\nGilroy: The camera's over there.\n\nTawni: Oh. Hey America!\n\n[Gilroy takes back remote and turns on monitor.]:\n\nTawni:Hey!\n\nSonny: That was so much easier to say than I thought it would be.\n\nGilroy: [Screams] What was easy? What did they say? I almost had them!\n\nTawni: Gotcha!\n\n25 Episodes by March 14, 2010 - January 2, 2011\n\nSonny: (runs up to Tawni, Nico and Grady) You guys! You guys! Stop eating!\n\nNico: Alright! Turn around! Let me see your butt!\n\nSonny: (confused) What?\n\nSonny: Hey Chad. Did you hear about my Walk-a-Thon for books?\n\nChad: Oh yes, we did. And I have to say Sonny, you are very inspiring.\n\nSonny: Well, we have so much. It's important that we give back.\n\nChad: (laughs) Aah no, I meant you inspired me to have a Walk-a-Thon against your Walk-a-Thon.\n\nSonny: (Pauses to look at the flyer Chad handed to her) A Walk-a-thon against books? How could you be against books?\n\nChad: That's easy. The more you read, the less you watch MacKenzie Falls.\n\nSonny: That's your cause, To get people to watch more TV?\n\nChad: Are you not listening? It's to get them to read less. I'll see you at the Walk-a-Thon to read less books. (turns and turns back around) I've got something to tell you Sonny. We're gonna raise more money than you.\n\nSonny: For what?\n\nChad: To not buy books.\n\nSonny: That doesn't even make sense!\n\nChad: Aah. Guess all that reading you're doing isn't making you any smarter now, is it? See ya.\n\nChad: We're gonna look hotter than you at the Walk-a-Thon.\n\nSonny: (laughs) Giving back is what's hot!\n\nChad: That's what people who don't look hot say.\n\n(Nico and Grady are rolling around the floor, trying to button Tawni's Extreme Skinny Jeans.)\n\nNico: These pants are so skinny!\n\nNico: Tawni's pants are squishing my gluttons maxmi moola!\n\nGrady: (stands up)I signed up for a Walk-a-Thon. Not to have my internal organs crushed by Tawni's jeans!\n\nSonny: (walks out of the photo booth and trying to button her jeans) I want my mommy jeans back!\n\nGrady: This is impossible.\n\nSonny: We have to make this work! The only way we can get Tawni to walk with us is for us to wear her jeans because her fans will see on TV us wearing her jeans which will raise money for more books and less money for no books and everybody wins except Chad!!!!!! Hey now that I got that out I can button my pants.\n\nGrady: Well good for you because I'm never getting these things on.\n\nNico: Me neither.\n\nTawni: (walks in) Yes you will. Thanks to the Tawni Hart Butt Horn.\n\n(The So Random crew all fall down)\n\nNews Reporter: Chad, can I get a comment?\n\nChad: Well-(screams) We win, suck-ahh!(falls down)\n\n(The rest of Makenzie Falls crew fall down dramatically)\n\nNews Reporter: Oh no! MacKenzie Falls is down too! What is happening?!\n\nSonny: SPS is happening.\n\nChad: Sonny! Sonny, come here!

I can take it.\n\nDoctor: You have L.B.S.\n\nChad: (gasps) Leading Boy Syndrome?!\n\nDoctor: No. Lack of Book Syndrome! Also known as Lazy Butt Syndrome! LBS is also the abbreviation of pounds, (starts poking Chad), which is what you are going to gain if you don't stop watching yourself on T.V.\n\nChad: Can't you just cut my pants off? You know how you do?\n\nDoctor: Read two books, then call me in the morning, Mr. Cooper. (hands Chad a prescription)\n\nChad: (Looks at prescription) Actually it's Dylan Cooper.\n\nDoctor: Not anymore, I removed your Dylan while you were under.\n\nChad: NO! What did you do to it?!\n\nDoctor: I gave it to someone who wouldn't waste it! (Opens curtains to reveal Grady)\n\nDoctor: Good afternoon, Mr. Grady Dylan Mitchell.\n\nGrady: Just got my Dylan. I've been waiting for 2 years!\n\nChad: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! (cries) WHY?!\n\n(Chad wakes up)\n\nChad: I must have fallen asleep reading. Stupid books. That was horrible! (closes book)\n\nTawni: I don't know why you're packing, you're not going anywhere until you apologize!\n\nSonny: I don't know why you're packing because I'm not apologizing!\n\nTawni: Of course you're apologizing it's your thing, you apologize.

(Pretends to rip circle)\n\nTawni: Give me that! (They start fighting for the circle)\n\nSonny: Got it! (Tawni cries)\n\nTawni: Why is Chad Dylan Cooper selling Glandovian horn whitner?\n\nTawni: Check out its chicken neck.\n\nSonny: Check out its chicken arms.\n\nTawni and Sonny: They're called wings.\n\nSonny: It felt so good to check it out with you.\n\nTawni: Really? 'Cause I thought that you thought Dinka was better than me.\n\nSonny: And I thought that you thought you're partner was better than me.\n\nTawni: My partner was a goat.\n\nSonny: My partner sang like one.\n\nTawni and Sonny: I'm sorry. (hugs each other)\n\nTawni: Oooh. I'm seeing a lot of angry people over your shoulder.\n\nSonny: And I'm watching a goat go to the bathroom over yours.\n\nBella: Gassie! Stay! And don't lick yourself. I just brushed you.\n\nSonny: (knocks on Gassie's door) Gassie.\n\nGassie: (walks out through the doggy door)\n\nSonny: (to Gassie and pets him) Awww. There you are. You know, I used to have a dog just like you in Wisconsin. Yeah, except he was a beagle with three legs and one eye. We called him Lucky! Or... or Limpy. Or Blindy. But, you know, it didn't matter what we called him because he was deaf too! You know what else he loved? We think. Meatballs. Yeah, you smell? (feeds Gassie the meatballs) Awwww. I bet she never feeds you treats huh?\n\nBella: Gassie!\n\nSonny: (throws some more meatballs through Gassie's door) Gassie go! Go! Hurry!\n\n(Gassie goes back inside his dressing room. Sonny stuffs the rest of the meatballs inside her mouth)\n\nBella: What are you doing here?\n\nSonny: (mouth full) Nothing.\n\nBella: Were you playing with Gassie?\n\nSonny: (shakes her head) Nuh unh!\n\nBella: (stares at Sonny)\n\nSonny: (stares back at Bella)\n\nBella: (stares back at Sonny) I'm watching you. (leaves)\n\nSonny: (spits the meatballs out and puts them on the floor)\n\nGassie: (walks back out)\n\nSonny: You heard Bella, Gassie. She doesn't want me playing with you anymore. (has an idea) But she didn't say anything about you playing with me!\n\nGassie: (farts)\n\nSonny: I'll take that as a yes! Come on Gassie!\n\nGassie: (follows Sonny)\n\nSonny: I didn't come here to argue I came here to give Gassie some dog time. Beneath the trees and on grass...\n\nChad: Except the grass is plastic and the trees are cardboard because[through the bull-horn]THIS IS A SET.\n\nSonny: Good then what Gassie is doing to that bush over there wont kill it.\n\nSo Random Cast: (sees Gassie dead) NO!\n\nZora: Please tell me he's sleeping.\n\nSonny: Okay, he's sleeping.\n\nZora: DON'T LIE TO ME!!!\n\nTawni: What did you do?\n\nSonny: I don't know! It was going so well. I told him to sit and he sat. I told him roll over he rolled over. I told him to play dead HE DIED!\n\nGrady: (feels Gassie's paws) You guys should feel this.\n\n(Everybody is disgusted.)\n\n[Looking at the Gassie & We movie poster]\n\nTawni: Why is Gassie's head bigger then mine?\n\nSonny: Well, I'm not sure that it is.\n\n[Lunch-box lets out a farting sound]\n\nSonny: Gross! you want people to buy that and then put food in it?\n\nZora: Gross sells sister.\n\nDakota: You have have very nice blue eyes.\n\nGrady: Why thank you.\n\nDakota: It'd be a shame if you lost one of them!\n\nGrady: Yeah it would.\n\nDakota: Now hand me to the Matador![Grady hands her to Nico]\n\nNico: Hola?\n\nChad: You just found out your boyfriend's a vampire,you're scared,you're confused,you have two holes in your neck what do you do? AND ACTION!\n\nTawni: Bravo.\n\nSonny: (closes the painting and turns to Tawni)\n\nTawni: Well played. I can't believed you tricked me.\n\nSonny: Tawni, you don't understand.\n\nTawni: No, you don't understand. I can't believe you tricked me.\n\nSonny: (smiling nervously)\n\nTawni: I'm so proud! (hugs Sonny)\n\nSonny: And I thought you weren't a hugger.\n\nTawni: And I thought you were above manipulative to get a boy. Apparently it's opposite day!\n\nTawni: Aw. You have a song pillow?\n\nSonny: Yeah.\n\nTawni: Can I see it?\n\nSonny: No.\n\nTawni: (grabs one side of the pillow and pulling it) GIVE ME THE PILLOW!!!! I know you're in love with him!\n\nSonny: (pulling the other side) No I'm not!\n\n(The song pillow tears up and Sonny's songs fly all over the place.)\n\nSonny: MY SONGS! (looking through her songs)\n\nTawni: (reading Sonny's songs) \"Girl Plus Boy Equals Joy\" \"Girl Plus Boy Equals Soy\" \"Girl Plus Boy Equals Annoying\"\n\nSonny: Annoying? I didn't write that.\n\nTawni: No I did. See that's how easy it is to make horrible songs.\n\nSonny: Look, I wrote those when I was pretty young. (picks up a sheet) This is the song I wanted to show him.\n\nTawni: (reads) \"Me, Myself and Time.\" Let's hear it.\n\nSonny: What?\n\nTawni: You heard me.\n\nSonny: I don't really feel comfortable-\n\nTawni: SING!\n\nSonny: (smiles nervously and then sings) I can make the rain stop if I wanna just by my attitude.\n\nTawni: Huh. Not bad.\n\nSonny: Really?!\n\nTawni: Not the song. Using music to get a musician. Why didn't I think of that?\n\nChad: Chad Dylan Cooper fears nothing.\n\nSonny: Spiders.\n\nChad: Not little ones.\n\nSonny: Heights.\n\nChad: Not low ones.\n\nChad: Bangs and Fangs, We all get bitten by vampires and get awesome hair.\n\nNico: Is your show written by monkeys?\n\nSonny: (pulls the curtain and sees Tawni) Tawni?!\n\nTawni: You're right. I am a lying, self serving, song stealing phony! (confused) How did I get in this box?\n\nSonny: And besides, I'm more of a dabbler anyways. (in a British accent) Dabbler, dabbler, dabbler.\n\nTawni: If you won't sing it honey, I will.\n\nSonny: (thinks for a few seconds, covers Tawni with the curtain and goes onstage)\n\nAnnouncer: Ladies and gentlemen, singing her original song, \"Me, Myself and Time\", Sonny Munroe!\n\n(Everyone is watching Sonny perform.)\n\nNico: Wow.\n\nGrady: Yeah.\n\nMarshall: Who knew?\n\nTawni: She's great right?\n\n(Nico, Grady and Marshall look at her.)\n\nTawni: It's opposite day.\n\nSnowy: My men might be short but I'm living large.\n\nCindy: If the slipper fits, you too can be a princess.\n\nBeauty: With all the beauty rest I get, is there any wonder why I'm so hot?\n\nAll: We are the real princesses of New Jersey.\n\nIn the hair saloon:\n\nSnowy: Hey Beauty, what are you wearing tonight?\n\nBeauty: I'm thinking of wearing my mini gown.\n\nSnowy: Aah, the one with the leopard pattern?\n\nBeauty: You know it. [growls]\n\nSnowy: It's gonna be like Beauty and the Beast wrapped up in one. [both laugh nasally] So Beauty and I are getting mani padis 'cause I'm throwing a ball tonight. It's going to be very A-list. There's gonna be fairies, godmothers, singing mice. Ah the whole Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Bang. [laughs snobbishly] It's ridiculous.\n\nCindy: Well, well, well, if it ain't the second and third fairest of them all.\n\nSnowy: Cindy, how did you know we where here? [laughs nervously]\n\nFlashback:\n\nCindy: Mirror Mirror on the wall, are those 2 witches at the mall?\n\nMirror: Yeah, they're getting their nails done. But you didn't hear it from me.\n\nFlashback ends\n\nCindy: I can't believe you didn't invite me to your ball.\n\nSnowy: Oh, you mean you didn't get the invitation?\n\n[Both smile at each other then roll their eyes.]\n\nSnowy: Yeah like I was going to invite her, right? Last ball I threw, stroke of midnight, her dress is trashed, one shoe on, one shoe off. She's driving around in a pumpkin.\n\nCindy: Ha. They think that they're so much better than me.\n\nBack at the hair salon:\n\nCindy: Your mother's a witch.\n\nSnowy: Your mother's a witch.\n\nBeauty: Princesses, princesses. All of our mothers are witches.\n\nBoth:: [agreeing]\n\nSnowy: Sorry I flew off the handle. [shows Cindy a apple] Apple?\n\nCindy: Thanks. [takes out her gum, eats the apple and falls on the ground]\n\nBeauty: [laughs] She falls for that every time.\n\nSnowy: I guess we know who the dumbest of them all is. It's ridiculous.\n\nSonny: [in Snowy voice] I know. It's ridiculous, right? [flips her hair]\n\nTawni: (singing) I've never, ever been to public school.\n\nSonny: Oh no.\n\nMartha: What is she doing?\n\nSonny: She's trying to tell us how miserable she is.\n\nTawni: I never thought that it would be this cruel.\n\nMartha: By singing?\n\nSonny: Looks like it.\n\nNico: (singing) It's endless. We're friendless.\n\nGrady: (walks in and sings) It's nothing but pain.\n\nSonny: Apparently the only high school they know is the musical one.\n\nZora: (singing) And no one in this dump knows our name.\n\nSonny: Alright Martha, give me a boost.\n\nMartha: (helps Sonny up on a lunch table)\n\n(Music starts playing.)\n\nSonny: (singing) I know you think that this is probably my fault.\n\nTawni: We do.\n\nSonny: The catty comments and the constant assault.\n\nGrady: It's cool.\n\nSonny: I was here once and I'm still alive. So listen if you wanna survive (gets down) inside this-\n\nSo Random Cast: High School Miserable.\n\nTawni: I never I thought I'd be invisible.\n\nSo Random Cast: This High School Miserable.\n\nSonny: We got to keep being indivisible.\n\nSo Random Cast: In this High School Miserable. Don't understand what's happening to me. In this High School Miserable. (stands on lunch tables) Someone get me back on T.V.\n\nAnnouncer: On the next Mackenzie Stalls, backed up passions overflow.\n\nSonny: I thought we were destined to be together. Now I can never forgive you. You left the toilet seat up!\n\nGrady: It was a moment of weakness, but I'm not the only one with a secret shame.\n\nSonny: (gasps) You mean?\n\nGrady: Yes! You forgot to flush.\n\nAnnouncer: Lack of hygiene leads to lack of trust.\n\nTawni: I can't hold it in anymore. Tell me the truth. Did you wash your hands?\n\nNico: Of course I did.\n\nTawni: Lies! (slaps Nico)\n\nNico: Ohhh!\n\nAnnouncer: And someone didn't read the writing on stall.\n\nSonny: You're not welcome here, Mackenzie.\n\nGrady: Why? Because I'm richer than you?\n\nSonny: No, because this is the girls bathroom.\n\nGrady: (gasps) WHY?!?!?!?!\n\nSonny: And you're zipper is open.\n\nGrady: WHY?!?!?!?!?!\n\nAnnouncer: In a world flushed with drama, the number one show is now number two. Mackenzie Stalls.\n\nZora: Starring Chad Dylan Pooper.\n\nChad: (watching the sketch and becomes furious) Pooper?! Oh, it's on! Plunger! (catches a plunger thrown at him and walks away)\n\n(The So Random cast walk in the prophouse with toilet paper and plungers on themselves.)\n\nSonny: I told you that if we made fun of Mackenzie Falls on our show they would get back at us.\n\nNico: I don't care. Doing that Mackenzie Stalls sketch was worth getting plunged in the head.\n\nGrady: Look at me. I'm a toilet unicorn.\n\nSonny: Yeah, well at least you got the front half. (turns and there's a plunger on her butt)\n\n(The So Random cast pull the plungers out of themselves.)\n\nZora: You know what I think? Our humiliation calls for major retaliation. I'm talking glue,fire ants,and a sizzling fajita. Who's with me?\n\nTawni: Chicken or Steak?\n\nSonny: No. No more revenge. No more retaliation. No more fajitas.\n\nTawni: Ms. Bitterman, does hitting Sonny with a log count as a 'woodsy' activity?\n\nChad: And if we do it all together, does it count as bonding?\n\nMs.Bitterman: If you pick the log out together, yes.\n\nZora: Quick! Everybody agree on a log!\n\nSonny: (runs away)\n\nMs.Bitterman: You have been paired up with the person you dislike the most.\n\nGrady: I should be with Aquaman!\n\nMs.Bitterman: From reality.\n\nMs.Bitterman: Now, the minefield consists of various...\n\nZora: Moose dung!\n\nMs.Bitterman: There's other dung.\n\nChloe: Poop to your left! Poop to your left!\n\nGrady: I can't 'go' with people watching.\n\nChad: Have you guys been breathing in too much bug spray? It looks like a wolf in a hoodie. Your Candy Face could be... anything?\n\nGrady: Even Candy Face.\n\nZora: Somebody wake Sonny!\n\nTawni: Good idea! If Candy Face gets Sonny then maybe he'll leave the rest of us alone!\n\nSo Random Cast: (everyone pulls Sonny's sleeping bag but she's not there)\n\nZora: Sonny's gone!\n\n(A girlish scream is heard.)\n\n(The So Random cast is looking for Sonny)\n\nZora: Sonny! Sonny! We found her! She's over here!\n\nSonny: (lying on the ground)\n\nGrady: (helping Sonny up with Nico) How's she looking?\n\nTawni: Terrible, so she must be okay.\n\nChad: If you’ll excuse me, it’s time to say buenos noches to señor smoothie.(walks away)\n\nNico: Chad, watch out! There's a snake!\n\nChad: I'm not falling for it!\n\n[screams like a girl]\n\nNico: There... really was a snake.\n\nSonny: He has got to learn how to trust.\n\n[Chad screams again]\n\nGrady: And scream like a dude!\n\nSonny: (watching the video on Zora's camera and sees herself sleep walking and destroying Senor Smoothie) I must have been sleepwalking. I must have been the one who broke the heater and Grady's GameGuy. Oooh and killed Senor Smoothie. I'm Candy Face. I'm Candy Face! I'm Candy Face! And I'm destroying the evidence. (throws the camera against a stump and breaks it)\n\nNico: What was that?!\n\nSonny: Ahhh! (throws the camera and her gloves on the ground) It's Candy Face!\n\n(The So Random cast come out of the tent.)\n\nSonny: Candy Face! She- he- it broke your camera!\n\nZora: It's like the monster is deliberately destroying everything that's important to us!\n\nTawni: And yet he gently deposits you.\n\n(The Mackenzie Falls cast come out of their tent.)\n\nChad: Let me guess, Candy Face... broke the camera. There's no evidence to prove it you guys are right. One of you is responsible for this and I'm pretty sure it's-\n\nSonny: No, no, no! (crying and hugs Chad) Chad, Chad, Chad! It happened right in front of me and it was so scary. The only thing I could think of was if only Chad Dylan Cooper, the greatest actor of our generation, was here to save us.\n\nChad: He is (holds Sonny) and he will.\n\nChloe: You believe her?\n\nChad: I believe that she's not a good enough actor to lie this convincingly.\n\nSonny: (nods)\n\n(Mackenzie Falls cast agree with Chad.)\n\nDevon: I'm sorry I accused you guys of stealing my electric man scaping device.\n\nGrady: I'm sorry I blamed you for the death of my Game Guy.\n\nNico: I'm sorry I tried to hit on you while I was blindfolded.\n\nPenelope: And I'm sorry you don't realize what league you're in.\n\nSonny: You see what's happening here? Trust. Which means our job here is done. So we can just take that trust, put it in a bottle, wrap a little bow around it, bring it back to the studio because together we can-\n\n'Zora: KILL CANDY FACE!\n\nSo Random and Mackenzie Falls cast: Yeah!\n\nSonny: Or we can capture him and rehabilitate him.\n\nSo Random and Mackenzie Falls cast: NO!\n\nChad: Everybody in to the Mac Falls tent. We'll huddle there for safety there tonight. Tomorrow, our first trust exercise is weapon building!\n\nSo Random and Mackenzie Falls Cast: Whoo! (everyone goes inside the tent)\n\nZora: We're hunting monsters! (hugs) Sonny, this is the best retreat ever! (leaves)\n\nSonny: (shocked expression)\n\nGrady: Candy's supposed to melt in your mouth not into your skin.\n\nSonny: (starts sleepwalking with a blanket and candy on her face that makes her look like she's wearing a mask) Roar! (knocks the table down)\n\nSonny: (walks towards the Mackenzie Falls tent)\n\nSo Random and Mackenzie Falls cast: (wake up) Candy Face!\n\nSonny: Roar!

And you did beat the bull. Ole!\n\nChad: Well if it isn't the face of geezer hatred.\n\nSonny: *sighs* You heard?\n\nChad: We all saw it, didn't we kids?\n\nNico: Did you bring the kids here to boo us?\n\nChad: No, we came here to thank you.\n\nTawni: Really?\n\nChad: Yeah, because for just a minute their fear of clowns took a backseat to their grandparents tears. My grandma called me, told me not to watch the show, told her it was ok I already didn't.\n\nSonny: You know someday someones gonna expose you for the jerk you are [Pulls off Chad's hood and sees the hair curlers] OH MY GOSH!\n\nTawni: OH MY GOSH!\n\nChad:[Tries to cover his hair] OH MY GOSH!\n\nSonny: Hair curlers?\n\nChad: No. Girls wear curlers.

But your seventeen.\n\nChad: Buddy was seventeen and before he knew it it was melon!\n\nSonny: Melon?\n\nChad: Melon I tell ya!\n\nChad: What are you doing? These kids have an extreme fear of clowns the slightest bit comedy can set them off!\n\nSonny: Then why'd you bring them here!\n\nChad: This is the closest thing to a comedy free zone I know.\n\nSonny: Well, I'm officially your girlfriend.\n\nGrady: (gasps)\n\nSonny: Officially your fake girlfriend.\n\nGrady: Oh.

But listen-\n\nChad: Who makes up something like that?\n\nSonny: Who needs a free lance tennis judge?\n\nChad: Actually I'm hosting my annual charity tournament and I don't want to lose again\n\nSonny: Oh I see.

When two people are this right for each other there's only one thing to do.\n\nChad: How long have you felt this way?\n\nSonny: Just since yesterday. It hasn't been long but it hit me like a ton of bricks.\n\nChad: I mean I guess I feel the same way.\n\nSonny: Well then do something about it!\n\nChad: Okay I will\n\nSonny: Great!\n\nChad: Sonny will you go out with me?\n\n(Sonny looks shocked)\n\nSonny: I-I'm sorry, did you just ask me out?!\n\nChad: I'm sorry, didn't you just beg me to?\n\nSonny: Wait did you think I was talking about... Oh dear this is awkward!\n\nChad: (laughs awkwardly) Sure is...
