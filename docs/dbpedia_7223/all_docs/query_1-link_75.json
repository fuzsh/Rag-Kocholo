        "text": "March 18, 2005 – The Disney Channel Original Series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody Premieres\n\n“You and me got the world to see so come on down.”\n\nOn March 18, 2005, the Disney Channel Original Series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody premiered. It was highly successful, not only being nominated and winning several awards, but spawning a sequel series The Suite Life on Deck. It ran for 87 episodes in 3 seasons, and was created by Danny Kallis and Jim Geoghan. It starred Cole Sprouse as Cody Martin, Dylan Sprouse as Zack Martin, Brenda Song as London Tipton, Ashley Tisdale as Maddie Fitzpatrick, Phil Lewis as Mr. Moseby, and Kim Rhodes as Carey Martin.\n\nThe first episode, “Hotel Hangout,” begins at the Tipton Hotel, where twins Zack and Cody Martin are bummed that their mom Carey can’t take them to the park, as she has to rehearse her performance, but she allows them to invite friends from school. Unfortunately, as new kids, Zack and Cody don’t have any friends, but Carey reassures them that this won’t always be the case. Meanwhile, heiress London Tipton, whose father owns the Tipton Hotel, has effectively been grounded within the hotel as punishment for her poor grades. Candy-counter cashier Maddie Fitzpatrick has been overhearing the conversation between London and hotel manager Mr. Moseby, and Moseby hires Maddie as London’s tutor.\n\nAt their new school, Zack and Cody are still having trouble making friends, until they meet kids Max and Tapeworm, and invite them over to their home at the hotel. Max is seen as quite a dancer (and a girl, which Zack and Cody didn’t realize), and Carey asks her for help with her dance moves. Meanwhile, London and Maddie’s study session isn’t going as Maddie planned, as London spends her time shopping online. Maddie decides to get downstairs, as she wants to run into her crush, the new lifeguard. London offers to help Maddie with getting her crush’s attention. The next day at school, word is out that the twins live at the Tipton Hotel, and they are invited to be part of the popular group, abandoning Max and Tapeworm.\n\nMaddie goes back to work at the counter, and uses London’s advice to score a date with the lifeguard, and London offers to help Maddie get dressed for her date. When the popular kids show up at the hotel to hang out with Zack and Cody, they ruin the experience for all the other guests and are rude to Max and Tapeworm. Cody is reluctant to do something so mean, but Zack is desperate to be popular and convinces Cody to ditch them. Later, Carey tells them that they need to make sure that the entire school doesn’t show up at the hotel, but popular ringleader Drew invites more and more people to hang out at the hotel, much to the annoyance of Moseby. After the date with the lifeguard, Maddie doesn’t want to go out with him again, which confuses London. In the end, London convinces Maddie to dump the lifeguard, but Maddie ends up finding herself arranging another date. Moseby warns London that if Maddie doesn’t help pull London’s grades up, she will have to go to a private school with a uniform.\n\nCody realizes that they are being used by the kids from school, although Zack doesn’t care so long as he is considered cool. The head bellman Esteban warns the twins that Moseby has ordered him to remove all the kids from the premises, and finally, Zack agrees to help Cody get rid of the kids. When the lifeguard shows up to ask Maddie out for another date, Maddie tries to let him down gently, but she finally gets the nerve to dump him. London manages to pass her exam with a D+, and is awarded with a plasma television from her father. Zack and Cody continue to work on dumping all the kids from their school from the hotel, except for Drew and his crew. The two finally stand up to Drew, although not without consequence, which includes a mishap with the hotel’s satellite dish. Max and Tapeworm show up to help Zack and Cody, impressed by their standing up to Drew, and giving the twins their first real friends.\n\nMarch 13, 2013 – The Disney Channel Original Series Special The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex Premieres\n\n“People should appreciate you for who you are, not for what they think you should be.”\n\nOn March 13, 2013, the special for the Disney Channel Original Series The Wizards of Waverly Place entitled The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex premiered. The cast of the show returned for the special, except for David Henrie. It received 5.9 million viewers on its premiere. The special was directed by Victor Gonzalez, and written by Vince Cheung, Ben Montanio, and Dan Berendsen. It starred Selena Gomez as Alex, Jake T. Austin as Max, Jennifer Stone as Harper, Gregg Sulkin as Mason, Beau Mirchoff as Dominic, Maria Canals Barrera as Theresa, and David DeLuise as Jerry.\n\nThe special starts in a crystal cavern high in the mountains, where Alex is standing in front of the Crystals of Justice, accused of trying to destroy the world. Alex tries to defend herself (poorly), and she is found guilty of treason. She implores the Crystals to review the events that led up to the charge, and they send her back through the time vortex to when the events began. Alex is taken back to a night at the drive-in with her best friend Harper, although Alex’s dad Jerry finds that the two have made their own makeshift drive-in in the living room. Jerry lectures Alex on her immaturity as the Family Wizard. Alex’s boyfriend Mason and her mom Theresa show up with supplies for a surprise party for Alex’s older brother Justin. Alex is jealous that no one threw her a party, and Jerry lectures her again about using magic for selfish reasons. Unfortunately, Justin won’t make it to the party, as he’s too busy at Wiz Tech to make it. Jerry reveals there was another reason for the party: the family is heading to Italy for a family reunion. Alex decides to make it easier for everyone and creates a portal to Italy from their living room, and once again gets scolded by Jerry for using selfish magic.\n\nBefore Alex can remove the portal, her younger brother Max steps through to get a girl’s phone number, leaving Jerry and Theresa with no choice but to chase after him. They manage to retrieve him and head back to the New York apartment, but Alex doesn’t know how to undo the spell. When Jerry compares her to Justin, Alex gets upset, as she thinks Jerry wanted Justin to be the family wizard, and zaps herself away to the back of a Jumbotron to sulk. She is found by Justin’s friend Dominic, who asks her about joining the Wizard Council. He gives her the confidence that she could be a powerful wizard and gives her a friendship bracelet. Mason arrives and scares Dominic away, surprising her with a picnic. When Alex changes the food he’s made, he gets upset with her, as he also believes she’s just using her magic selfishly.\n\nWhen Alex gets home, she still doesn’t know how to get rid of the door, and Max keeps traveling through to find a girl. Alex relates to Harper how she hates how everyone wants her to change, and Harper tells her that she should be loved for who she are, not who she should be. Alex decides to change her personality for the better with magic. Unfortunately, all of Alex’s bad parts end up in a nearby mirror. While Alex thinks she’s trapped, the mirror version seems to have a plan to get back at her. Jerry and Theresa, having gone to search for Max again in Italy, meet up with Jerry’s family, and find that Max has fallen for his cousin. Back in New York, Harper is taking advantage of Alex’s good nature, but the mood sours when they hear a mirror break. They realize that Evil Alex has gone through the door to Italy, and when they find her parents, Alex tries to convince them that she’s changed, but they don’t believe her.\n\nEvil Alex stumbles upon Max trying to kiss his cousin Francesca, and traps him in the friendship bracelet from Dominic. The rest of the family is taken on a tour of the family vineyard, where Jerry and Theresa are asked to go stomp grapes, and the two begin to fight, throwing grapes at each other. While they fight, they suddenly disappear; Alex believes her evil self must have done something terrible. When Jerry and Theresa find themselves in Evil Alex’s bracelet, and are surprised to find that Evil Alex has teamed up with Dominic. Mason accidentally discovers Evil Alex and Dominic together, and walks away sadly before Dominic takes Evil Alex away to the Tower of Pisa. At the Tower, Dominic reveals his plan to rid the world of mortals. He needs Alex’s help to set his plan in motion, as she is the most powerful Family Wizard of their generation. Alex and Harper rush to the tower to stop them, but Harper is captured in the bracelet. Dominic reveals that he is the nephew of Alex’s old nemesis Gorog, the leader of the Dark Angels, and Alex refuses to cooperate, except when Evil Alex goes to trap Dominic in the bracelet.\n\nAlex manages to find Mason, but he is still angry with her after he thought he saw her with Dominic. Unfortunately, Evil Alex arrives, and Mason has to determine which is the real Alex. He picks the Evil Alex, and is brought back to the Tower of Pisa, where Dominic is waiting to trap Mason in the bracelet. Back in the apartment, Alex stares at some photos of her family, Mason, and Harper, and remembers Harper’s words about being appreciated for who she is. Realizing that everyone will need to accept Alex the way she is, she decides to save the world again, and heads to Pisa. Alex and Evil Alex get into an argument over who will go first with their bargain, but Alex has to cast the spell first, with all the mortals being wiped away from the Earth and trapped in beads. Alex is then given the bracelet back, but before she can undo the spell and save her family, she is brought before Crystals of Justice. Dominic is then brought before the board to give his testimony, and he blames her for the entire thing. Alex is found guilty again, and sentenced to death. Unfortunately, what Dominic failed to notice is that one of the charms on the charm bracelet is broken: Mason’s.\n\nMason manages to find Alex’s cell and breaks her out, where they rush off back to Pisa. Alex confronts Dominic and Evil Alex, and when Evil Alex heads back to New York, Alex is there to fight her. Evil Alex manages to run away, and Alex finds her behind the Jumbotron. The two continue to duke it out, and Alex manages to save her family, although it’s seen that she didn’t actually destroy her evil self. Alex heads back to Pisa, and finds herself trapped and has the bracelet taken away by Dominic, but she finally is able to destroy her evil self. Dominic throws the bracelet over the side of the tower, but Alex manages to save her family. Mason throws Dominic over the side of the tower, ending the plan. Evil Alex revives, and plans on taking over the world herself. When Alex decides to cast a spell to get rid of her powers, Evil Alex disappears within her, and her wand also vanishes, which brings back all the mortals. Back before the Crystals of Justice again, they laud her for her bravery, but refuse to give her back her powers because they believe she is not mature enough. Alex is angry that no one seems to accept her just as she is, except for Harper. The council is moved by her appreciation for Harper, and decides to give Alex her powers back. The family enjoys the rest of the family reunion, but Harper and Alex decide to remain in Italy for a while after Jerry and Theresa see the mess that the fight between Alexes left behind.\n\nJanuary 5, 1997 – The Television Sitcom Flash Forward Premieres on Disney Channel\n\n“Are you gonna play? Or are you gonna hide out the rest of your life?”\n\nOn January 5, 1997, the teen sitcom Flash Forward premiered on the Disney Channel. It was the first series to be branded as a Disney Channel Original Series, and centers around best friends Tucker James and Becca Fisher as they navigate through the eighth grade. The series lasted for one season with 26 episodes in total.

Tucker helps a new, pretty girl onto the bus, but is afraid to go on after her as he’s afraid of the bus driver. When Becca arrives at school, she greets her friend Chris, and the two are thrilled that they are now eighth graders, which means they rule the school. Tucker’s friend Miles reserves his friend’s seat, and Tucker arrives, mimicking many of the faculty members before heading to his seat, which is then occupied by a new student, Jack, who doesn’t like Tucker and his antics.\n\nBecca and Chris talk by Becca’s locker later, and are upset that they don’t have any classes together, except for P.E. Becca decides to go to the vice principal’s office to complain with Chris, only Chris doesn’t show. Becca presents her case alone, but the vice principal refuses to grant her request; not only that, she misses her chance to sign up for the newspaper. Meanwhile in the boys locker room, Jack locks Tucker out in only his towel, where he is spotted by the entire student body. It gets even worse when his towel falls off, and Tucker embarrasses himself in front of Kerry, the pretty new girl. Later Tucker heads to his audition as the DJ for the school announcements, and keeps the students laughing until Jack shows up with Tucker’s stolen underwear. Jack decides to audition, much to Tucker’s dismay.\n\nLater, Tucker and Becca commiserate over their eighth grade woes. Later, Chris shows up to apologize, and convinces Becca to go talk to the actual head of the school newspaper, Mr. Hargreaves. She gives him an impassioned speech and presents an article she’d written over the summer, but as it doesn’t seem to get her anywhere she leaves, forgetting her article. Fortunately, Becca receives good news when she gets home – Mr. Hargreaves called her house, asking her to meet him after study period to discuss her article. Tucker is still upset about being embarrassed, and begrudgingly gets up when he hears Becca calling for him to play hockey, and she convinces him that everything will be okay, especially when she tells him that Kerry thought he was cute.\n\nSeptember 21, 2001 – The Disney Channel Original Animated Series The Proud Family Premieres\n\n“Stop all that whining, girl! Your name is ‘Proud,’ not ‘Punk!’”\n\nOn September 21, 2001, the Disney Channel Original Animated Series The Proud Family premiered. Although the first animated DCOS, it was not animated by Disney Television Animation, but by Jambalaya Studios and Y.R. Studio and distributed by Buena Vista Television. The series garnered good reviews from critics, and won several awards, including an Annie Award in 2004 for Outstanding Character Design in an Animated Television Production. The series ran for 3 seasons with 54 episodes, as well as an animated movie. The series was created by Bruce W. Smith, and the theme song, “Here Comes Penny Proud,” features the talents of Solange Knowles and Destiny’s Child. The series starred Kyla Pratt as Penny, Tommy Davidson as Oscar, Paula Jai Parker as Trudy, Jo Marie Payton as Suga Mama, Karen Malina White as Dijonay, Orlando Brown as Sticky, Alisa Reyes as LaCienega, and Soleil Moon Frye as Zoey.\n\nThe first episode, “Bring it On,” starts with cheerleading tryouts, with Penny’s best friend Dijonay as the captain. There’s only one position open, and the candidates are less than stellar. Penny is the shoe-in for the open part, until Dijonay’s old friend LaCienega tries for the role. She impresses everyone with her gymnastic abilities, and it turns out that LaCienega and Penny are tied for the open spot. Torn between the two, Dijonay decides to have a cheer-off. Back at Penny’s house, her father Oscar spies a moving van across the stree and starts spying on the new neighbors, much to the frustration of his wife Trudy. Oscar’s mother Suga Mama has already met the neighbors and invited them over for dinner, and Penny blanches when she finds that LaCienega is the new neighbor. Trudy tells Penny she should try and get to know her better, but Penny doubts it.\n\nAs the Boulevardes family comes over for dinner, Oscar and Felix bond over big screen televisions, while LaCienega sucks up to Trudy. Trudy buys into LaCienega’s act, and Penny is told to try and be her friend. When Penny tries again at school the next day, LaCienega snaps at her and tells her to shove off. Penny decides to sit with the Gross Sisters, the bullies of the school. When Penny admits that she wishes that LaCienega would go away, the Gross Sisters decide to help Penny out with her wish. Penny arrives home and complains that she won’t make the squad, as Dijonay is picking LaCienega. Suga Mama advises Penny to get a gimmick. Penny’s friend Sticky warns Penny that the Gross Sisters have rigged the stage to become a giant CD, and will cause LaCienega to fly off the stage. Reluctantly, Penny heads over to the school to stop their plan. Unfortunately, Penny accidentally sets off the trap, and pushes LaCienega out of the way, becoming the victim herself. Everyone watches as Penny is sent flying off the stage.\n\nLater, Penny is seen limping onto the field on crutches, and LaCienega refuses to thank her for rescuing her. Dijonay apologizes to Penny after seeing LaCienega’s true colors, and tells her that Penny will always be her best friend. The episode ends with Oscar and Felix being caught by their wives in Felix’s home theater, as they pretended to be on a camping trip to get away from their “nagging wives.”\n\nAugust 26, 2000 – The Disney Channel Original Series In a Heartbeat Premieres\n\n“Sir, my name is Hank Beecham, this is Val and Tyler, and we’re here to help.”\n\nOn August 26, 2000, the Disney Channel Original Series In a Heartbeat premiered. It was based on the lives of real teenage volunteer EMTs. The first episode shown was a two-part pilot; the series lasted twenty-one episodes in total, ending after one season. The series was created by Jon Felson, Steve Reiss, and Patricia Green. It starred Shawn Ashmore as Tyler Connell, Reagan Pasternak as Val Lanier, Danso Gordon as Hank Beecham, Christopher Ralph as Jamie Waite, Lauren Collins as Brooke Lanier, and Jackie Rosenbaum as Caitie Roth.\n\nThe pilot episode begins with the football team’s practice, with player Tyler Connell eyeing cheerleader Val Lanier before getting sacked. Behind the bleachers, a group of kids are hanging out and discussing piercings. Tyler and teammate Hank Beecham hear a strange beeping noise and rush off the field, followed by Val. The beeping is an emergency call, and the three are part of a volunteer EMT squad that has to make their way to an accident. The man isn’t happy to see kids taking care of him, and panics, demanding to see a real doctor. Fortunately, the kids are able to calm him down and save his life. Back at the station house, the kids discuss the case before their boss Alex comes in to let them know about rookie orientation the next day, and warns them not to be late. Alex then has to talk with the mayor, trying to convince her not to put kids doing mandatory community service on the squad; he soon meets Dr. Jennifer Perino, who is tapped to be his assistant (and possible replacement).\n\nThe next day at the orientation, Tyler, Val, and Hank explains what happens, when they are interrupted by a pair of gossiping kids, including Jamie Waite, who was earlier seen hanging behind the bleachers. Jamie, who must perform mandatory community service, would rather “play a doctor on TV” than be one. Tyler and Val obviously have chemistry, but Val is very cautious about a relationship, as it’s very complicated between each other. She tries to explain things to her friend Caitie, who is another behind-the-bleachers kid, and pushes Val to reveal her feelings, although the two get in an argument over their different lifestyles. Tyler has to work with Jamie, although Jamie can’t understand why there’s so many rules and regulations to deal with equipment.\n\nVal and her sister Brooke, who also helps with the squad, are also dealing with a difficult home life, as their parents are fighting once again. Val explains it to Tyler when they sit on the bleachers at lunch, and he understands, as his life is rather difficult as well, with his parents being divorced. He advises her not to jump to the worst case scenario, as not every marriage ends in divorce. Soon after, the team heads out on another call, only to find that the lady that called want them to resuscitate a dog. While Tyler refuses to treat an animal, Jamie decided to at least give it a shot. While it looks like the two are finally getting along, another argument ensues when Jamie can’t find an orange cone again, even though he says he bought one. Alex is ready to fire him, but Jennifer refuses to let him. Val tries to make up with Caitie, but Caitie refuses to accept Val’s apology. Val once again opens up to Tyler about the fight, and the two get even closer, until an emergency sounds. The group rushes to a call, which happens to be Val’s dad. Her father had a heart attack, and she tries to keep calm, but is having a hard time.\n\nThe second half of the pilot begins at the hospital, where Val and her family find that her father’s heart attack was severe, but he is alive. Tyler stays with the family to help Val, and offers to talk with her, but she decides to stay in the room with her family. While at the hospital, Caitie arrives to give Val support, trying to apologize, and the two become friends again. Meanwhile, Jamie is on call with Hank, and finds that some guy driving around town has stolen his cone, who thinks that the cone is one of the three stooges. Seeing that the guy has some mental issues and not a lot of friends, Jessie tries to let the guy keep the cone, but Hank tells him they need to take the cone back. Later that night, there’s another emergency call, and the kids head to a multi-car crash, and Jessie finally realizes the severity of the situation he’s in.\n\nJennifer is leaving the building late at night, when she spots Hank crying in his car. He tries to go visit them in the hospital, and is caught by Jennifer when he tries to leave. Hank is having a hard time dealing with the accident, as there was a five-year-old in the car with a possible spinal injury. She offers him someone to talk to if he should need it, and she thanks him. Val finds Alex to talk to, as her father may need a heart transplant, and she may need to give up the squad to take care of her family. He offers to reduce her time for a week and see what happens. Alex then is ready to fire Jamie, but Jamie wishes to prove Alex wrong, proving that he can do this job better than expected. Jennifer is able to find information about the family for Hank, and he thanks her for finding out the condition for him. Later, Val is taking care of Brooke, and Tyler drops by to see how she’s doing. He brings her a good-luck charm – a leprechaun snowglobe – to give to her father, and the two play Scrabble with Brooke. The episode ends with team seen coping with their lives and their responsibilities.\n\nApril 4, 2010 – The Disney Channel Original Series Good Luck Charlie Premieres\n\n“It’s your big sister Teddy here, and I’m making this video diary to help you survive our…special family.”\n\nOn April 4, 2010, the Disney Channel Original Series Good Luck Charlie premiered with the first episode, “Study Date.” The comedy series is about the Duncan family, who is adjusting to life after the birth of youngest child Charlotte, better known as Charlie. The episodes also feature a “video diary” filmed by Charlie’s sister Teddy, who provides advice for Charlie dealing with the events of the episode. Throughout its run, the series received positive reviews, and was nominated for several awards. It ended its run on February 16, 2014, after four seasons and 97 episodes. The series was created by Phil Baker and Drew Vaupen, and stars Bridgit Mendler as Teddy Duncan, Leigh-Allyn Baker as Amy Duncan, Bradley Steven Perry as Gabe Duncan, Mia Talerico as Charlie Duncan, Eric Allan Kramer as Bob Duncan, and Jason Dolley as PJ Duncan.\n\nThe episode begins at the Duncan residence, with Teddy filming a video diary for her little sister Charlie. Mom Amy looks a little worse for wear, while eldest brother PJ finishes his homework due the day before, and father Bob gets ready for work as an exterminator. Teddy nearly forgets her younger brother Gabe, who declares that Charlie ruined his life. Amy then asks the family for help with Charlie when she reminds them that she will be returning to work as a nurse that night. Teddy says she has a study date at the library, but Amy forces her to cancel. That night, Amy heads to work and leaves Charlie with Bob, but is worried about this. Teddy invites her study date Spencer to the house, although Bob isn’t happy about it. Teddy and Spencer get close on the couch, although there are many distractions in the form of her family. Teddy goes downstairs to force her brother to turn down the volume on his electric guitar, and she threatens him. PJ’s best friend Emmett has a huge crush on Teddy, and visibly makes his affections known, but Teddy hardly notices him.\n\nWhen Teddy returns to the study date, and the mood turns romantic. As they get ready to kiss, Gabe interrupts them, as he hasn’t been fed dinner. As Bob calls Teddy for help, he trips on a rubber duck on the stairs and throws Charlie up in the air. Luckily, he catches her, but ends up injured enough to have to be taken to the hospital, leaving Teddy alone to take care of Charlie. PJ drives Bob to the hospital, annoying Bob by singing and trying to play the license plate game. Teddy takes care of Charlie while still trying to spend time with Spencer, although their earlier romantic mood is long gone. At the hospital, Bob makes PJ promise to be careful and not alert Amy. PJ disguises himself as a doctor while he looks for the doctor taking care of Bob, and ends up in a room with a kid who has a fishhook in his lip. When Teddy has to leave to take care of her Gabe, Spencer scares Emmett away from the house.\n\nAmy discovers PJ at the hospital, and he accidentally reveals that Bob’s in the hospital. Amy panics, and wonders if she should go back to work full time, and starts to cry. Bob reassures her that she’s not a terrible mother, but she still isn’t convinced that she’s making the right decision. Teddy goes next door to pick up Gabe, who snuck into his neighbor’s house to eat her food. Gabe refuses to go, though, as he feels like everyone’s forgotten him. Teddy reminds him that she was once in the same position as he was, and things will get better. Teddy finally gets everything in order, and she and Spencer attempt to kiss, when they are once again interrupted by Teddy’s father entering through the door, doped up on pain medication and announcing that he has a bruised coccyx. Spencer’s ride arrives, and Teddy walks him to the door, slightly upset that she didn’t get her kiss. She ends the episode with the end of her video diary, and a text from Spencer asking her to hang out tomorrow night."
