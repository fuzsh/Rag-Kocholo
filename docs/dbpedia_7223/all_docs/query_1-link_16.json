        "text": "So Random co-stars Audrey (I’m gonna marry Zach Feldman) Whitby and Allisyn (Tantrum Girl) Arm were in Audrey’s home town of Elkhart, Indiana this week. The two taught sketch comedy at The Elkhart Civic Theater and on Friday night helped the local food bank!\n\nHere’s a pic Allisyn posted on Instagram as they prepared to sign autographs!!\n\nHere’s what the Elkhart Civic Theater website had to say ..\n\n“Elkhart Civic Theatre and Church Community Services are proud to announce that former Elkhart Civic Theatre actress Audrey Whitby along with her TV Co-Star Allisyn Ashley Arm, both of the Disney Channel’s sketch comedy show “So Random”, will host an outreach program and autograph signing party on Friday June 15, 2012. To be held in the Church Community Services food warehouse from 4:00 – 5:30 PM, the only cost to attend the event will be a donation of non-perishable food items for the food pantry and $1 for the ECT Glenn Gosling and Lillian Conley Scholarship Fund.\n\nThe public is invited to come to Church Community Services with a book or stuffed animal to be signed, but the actresses are also supplying pictures and articles that they will sign, and there will be episodes of the show “So Random” for the public to view. Church Community Services is looking forward to welcoming Audrey, Allisyn, and their fans to their campus at907 Oakland Ave., Elkhart.\n\n“Audrey and Allisyn are grateful for the public, and want to do something to help the community that Audrey was once a part. The girls and ECTeam felt that with this event, CCS will help many deserving families, as well as help Elkhart Civic Theatre give back to local college students through its scholarship program.” says John Shoup, Artistic Director at ECT.\n\n“It’s fun to get unique opportunities like this to spread the word about what we do. The giving spirit of these two young women, and the fact that they choose to direct it to our community says a lot to us here inElkhart,” says Rod Roberson, executive director of Church Community Services. “We’ve seen lots of local young people getting involved in service to their neighbors. Audrey and Allisyn are showing that our neighborhood is even larger than we thought.”\n\nBIOGRAPHIES\n\nAudrey Whitby started her career in community theatre here in Northern Indianaat the age of 6. By age 11, Audrey was an American Girl doll model, starred in lots of fun commercials, and had been in over 50 musical theatre productions. Moving with her mother and actress sister Maddie to Los Angeles at age 12, she has guest starred on ”Dog with a Blog” and “Austin and Ally”, and recently starred in her own Nickelodeon pilot, “Bad Fairy”. Now 16, she has done 17 episodes on Disney’s sketch comedy show “So Random”, and when not acting, loves surfing, longboarding, and roller derby.\n\nAllisyn Ashley Arm is 16 years old and has been acting professionally for over a decade, with many great television and movie roles including: “Judging Amy,” “Still Standing,” “Friends,” and “King of California.” Allisyn has also found success on the stage, as a voice-over artist, and in commercials… (over 50!). For the last four years, Allisyn has been a series regular on Disney Channel Hit shows, “Sonny With A Chance,” and “So Random”.\n\nI think it’s awesome when young stars use their fame to give back to their community! I bet they made lots of kids very happy Friday. The food and money raised will make a difference for a long time to come!!"
