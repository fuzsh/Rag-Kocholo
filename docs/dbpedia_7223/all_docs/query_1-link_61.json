        "text": "By Alec K. A. Lewis\n\nWriter & Editor for “The AlecLewReview”\n\nStarting off the show, Damien Johanssen (Damien Haas) tries to convince Audrey Vale (Audrey Whitby) & Zora Lancaster (Allisyn Arm) that they should be tired of watching random sketches and try “SO LOGICAL” (where everything is dull). Needless to say, it is not what they want. China Anne McClain appears in the sketch and the music fades in and the show begins.\n\nThe cast starts off the show with reminiscing about things that happened 5 seconds ago and then Nico Harris introduces China Anne McClain to the show.\n\nThe first sketch of the show is “Teachers don’t try to be cool” with Mr. Goodman (Shayne Topp), where he and his class are at the museum and Mr. Goodman, who does not play by the rules, destroys everything as well as injuring himself repeatedly in the process.\n\nAs the show plays on, we lead up to the performance of “Unstoppable” by guest star China Anne McClain with China taking a part in a few sketches throughout the show.\n\nPhenomenal acting by The Randoms, as well as hilarity by the sketches of the show. The acting and comedy by The Randoms keeps you in stitches all throughout the show and I highly encourage you to watch the show.\n\nChina Anne McClain’s performance of “Unstoppable” at the end of the show was amazing and catchy.\n\nIt has been a great season so far, and with the addition of Audrey Whitby and Bridget Shergalis after the second episode, the show has become even better.\n\nHoping to review the “New Boyz” episode in a few weeks where Audrey Whitby is back as a main character of her sketch.\n\nUntil then, rock on!\n\nRating: 2 Thumbs Up & an A++\n\nThe show So Random stays at the top of my Watchlist along with Austin & Ally and Shake It Up.\n\nSpecial Guest:\n\nChina Anne McClain as Herself\n\nCAST\n\nAllisyn Ashley Arm as Zora Lancaster\n\nTiffany Thornton as Tawni Hart\n\nSterling Knight as Chad Dylan Cooper\n\nDoug Brochu as Grady Mitchell\n\nBrandon Mychal Smith as Nico Harris\n\nAudrey Whitby as Audrey Vale\n\nMatthew Scott Montgomery as Matthew Bailey\n\nShayne Topp as Shayne Zabo\n\nDamien C. Haas as Damien Johanssen\n\nBridget Shergalis as Bridget Cook\n\nSee more…\n\nLINK COPYRIGHTS © 2012 Internet Movie Database.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nSHOW COPYRIGHT © 2012 Disney Channel, It’s a Laugh Productions & Varsity Pictures.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nBy Alec K. A. Lewis\n\nWriter & Editor for “The AlecLewReview”\n\nWhat more inappropriate place for a flash mob than in the Operating Room?\n\nWell, the Randoms bring humour to the stage in the first set with another addition of “Inappropriate Places for a Flash Mob.”\n\nOpening the show, new cast members “Shayne Zabo”, “Bridget Cook”, “Damian Johanssen” & “Matthew Scott Montgomery”\n\n“Becky Beaver” (Allisyn Ashley Arm) finds love in wood shop with her shop partner, Gary (Sterling Knight). Shawna (Bridget Shergalis) encourages her to pursue her affection for Gary with some pretty bad puns mixed into the advice. Attempting to hide the secret that she was “Raised by Beavers”, Becky continually tries to hide her teeth and fight her attraction to wood. Unfortunately, Mr. Seaton (Brandon Michyl Smith) is trapped under a fallen shelf and the secret finally comes out when Becky decides to save Mr. Seaton with her beaver teeth and abilities. Gary reveals soon after a secret of his own and we move onto the next main sketch.\n\nAfter a quick sketch, we arrive at “Madeline Online” where Madeline is a online “cyber-brat” who blogs about everything that goes on around her, which completely hurts everyone at school. When her computer and phone is taken away, the teacher uses the technology herself and finds in the end, “You better think twice, before you hit send.”\n\n“Simple Country Boy” (Shayne Topp) returns to the screen, where he teaches the flight attendants how to land a commercial jet, with some knowledge most everyone but those who were trained in that field, don’t even know.\n\nReturning from a commercial break, Sterling Knight plays a student (Skip) who is hard to figure out when he is being sarcastic. Confusing everyone with everything he says, he winds up in hot water with a girl who is crushing on him. “What is that supposed to mean?” pretty much sums it up.\n\n“The Ready Set” ends the show with a musical performance of “Young Forever”.\n\nRating: 2 Thumbs Up & an A+\n\nThe show So Random stays at the top of my Watchlist along with Austin & Ally and Shake It Up.\n\nCAST\n\nAllisyn Ashley Arm as Zora Lancaster\n\nTiffany Thornton as Tawni Hart\n\nSterling Knight as Chad Dylan Cooper\n\nDoug Brochu as Grady Mitchell\n\nBrandon Michael Smith as Nico Harris\n\nAudrey Whitby as Audrey Vale\n\nMatthew Scott Montgomery as Matthew Bailey\n\nShayne Topp as Shayne Zabo\n\nDamien C.

A. Lewis\n\nWriter & Editor for “The AlecLewReview”\n\nStarting off the show with Sally Jensen Kid Lawyer (Allisyn Arm), Cole Sprouse and Dylan Sprouse star in the sketch about cartoon character dangers, including the twins as cartoon Popeye (Dylan Sprouse) and a real person trying to be Popeye (Cole Sprouse), and a whole slew of cartoon characters that get arrested.\n\nThe theme music and opening sequence roll and we cut to stage where Cole & Dylan are introduced and are announced to be the first twin guests on the show. A highly entertaining opening exchange about the the superstition of twins being able to finish each others sentences and feel each other’s pain, among other things. An amazing introduction that you have to see.\n\nThe show continues with Sam Herman defending his client (Matthew Scott Montgomery), and the court finds him “NOT GROOVY”. When it doesn’t seem to make much sense, it becomes apparent when everyone breaks into a flash mob. Another great episode of “Inappropriate Places for a Flash Mob” with, as usual, most of the cast members appear in the sketch, such as Bridget Shergalis, Allisyn Arm, Shayne Topp, Brandon Michael Smith and many more.\n\nWe return to the show with the sketch “Teachers… Don’t Try to Be Cool” where Mr. Goodman (Shayne Topp) is back, where he continues to try to be cool even when he is sick. Getting worse and worse, Mr. Goodman throws yet another object out the window and lies down. One of his students, Lilly Baxter (Audrey Whitby) appears as a tortoise with a bow tie in a hallucination, after which Mr. Goodman stands up and sneezes himself out of the room. Mr. Goodman makes a few more attempts to try to be cool and then it ends.\n\nFollowing that sketch, a man (Shayne Topp) gets into a staring contest with the man sitting on the bench next to him (Damien C. Haas). Another man (Matthew Scott Montgomery) shows up 60 years later, and finds for his missing “mannequin,” also finding that Shayne was in a staring contest with it for so long without realizing it was not an actual person. Feeling up to a challenge, the man sits sits down and it starts all over again.\n\nNow “The Anime Brothers” are back and up against the new Botformer Bros. (played by Cole & Dylan Sprouse). However, as the battle engages, the twins find out that they are at the wrong school and leave in a panic.\n\nFor the final part of the show, there is the one final sketch: An insider look by Chad Dylan Cooper (Sterling Knight) of the popular Disney show “The Suite Life on Deck”. The insider look reveals the existence of ANOTHER brother, Skippy Sprouse (Matthew Scott Montgomery). The parody of the show shows how Skippy repeatedly screwed up the show, and why he was not in the show. Debby Ryan & “Mr. Moesby” (Brandon Michael Smith) reminisce about the terror Skippy was, and ending with Skippy ruining the interview. The episode ends with the stage revolving around to reveal Cole & Dylan Sprouse sitting on stools, with everyone expecting a musical performance, only to be told by the twins that they don’t do music.\n\n“The Randoms” are disappointed, but end the show with some banter between the twins and themselves, which was entertaining.\n\nRating: 2 Thumbs Up & an A\n\nCAST\n\nCole Sprouse & Dylan Sprouse\n\nDebby Ryan\n\nAllisyn Ashley Arm as Zora Lancaster\n\nTiffany Thornton as Tawni Hart\n\nSterling Knight as Chad Dylan Cooper\n\nDoug Brochu as Grady Mitchell\n\nBrandon Michael Smith as Nico Harris\n\nAudrey Whitby as Audrey Vale\n\nMatthew Scott Montgomery as Matthew Bailey\n\nShayne Topp as Shayne Zabo\n\nDamien C.
