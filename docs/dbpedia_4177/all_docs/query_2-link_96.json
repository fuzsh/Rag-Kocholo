        "text": "Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening\n\nBy Miguel Lopez |\n\nWe get dirty with a preview build of Dante's third coming.\n\nSpiffy:\n\nDifferent combat styles bring some nice variety to the fighting; the game is much deeper and better structured than its predecessors.\n\nIffy:\n\nDante is his usually bad self, which may be bad, depending on your sensibilities.\n\nI'll go out and say it: if you were nonplussed by Devil May Cry 2's abbreviated play-through time, and generally forgiving difficulty level, you may want to consider yourself vindicated by its successor. Actually, \"successor\" might not completely accurate, given that the game is technically a prequel to the original. But go ahead and feel vindicated, despite. From the looks of it, Devil May Cry 3 is being built around all the things that we loved about the first game, and expanding upon them quite generously. I, for one, was ready to write off the series as another one of those perpetually iterative franchises that never seems to change for the better. But after spending some time with a preview version of DMC 3, I'm close to ready to taking all that back.\n\nEveryone Needs an Evil Twin\n\nIn any case, it's a prequel, and as such, the younger Dante whose shoes you find yourself in is 10 times more brash and mouthy than you're used to if you'd believe that. Much of the action apparently revolves around family drama, specifically involving Dante's twin brother, Virgil. The game starts out appropriately enough: Dante, lounging behind the office desk of his yet-to-be-furnished demon-slaying business, receives an unexpected caller. The man -- a brooding, soft-spoken stranger named Arkham -- brings Dante an invitation to visit his brother.\n\nFar from a scented length of parchment, however, the form that the invitation takes is a gaggle of hellspawn, from whose limbs issue blades that end up piercing Dante's flesh every which way. Of course, our unfazed hero, while munching on a slice of pizza, manages to dispatch them all with the very blades they've stuck into his flesh. Many other acts of cockiness and defiance accompany all this. I don't want to spoil them for you. And worry not -- after the intro cinema, there's a second wave of demons that you actually get to kill on your own. It wouldn't be fair if the cinematic directors got to have all the fun, would it?\n\nVersatile/My Style Switches Like a\n\nDante has always been a multifaceted fighter, but DMC 3 is the first game in the series that truly seems to capitalize on this. It works like this: at the game's outset, Dante has four distinct fighting styles that he can work with. At first glance, each one only differs slightly in how it performs; Dante will be able to swing his melee weapon, and shoot his guns, regardless of which one is active. The differences become more pronounced once you start to improve in each of these styles; the more you use them, the more abilities within them become unlocked. As you'd assume, when a particular style is fully jacked-up, it's quite formidable, but know this: you can only realistically master one particular style in each play through. Your data, however, carries over each time you play, so if you've mastered Swordsmanship the first time around, feel free to work on Trickster, or Gunslinger, or what have you.\n\nNext: Page 2 >>\n\nPage: 1 2"
