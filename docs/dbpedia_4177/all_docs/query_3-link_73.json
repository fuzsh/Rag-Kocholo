        "text": "The main improvement, though, is the Style system. Dante's got four styles and each suits a certain style of play, levelling up with prolonged use. Our favourite is Trickster - allowing you to nip in and out with quick hits and combo-kill enemies - but veterans might want to test themselves with the elegant Royal Guard for huge combos and massive style points.\n\nThe whole system works beautifully - and again, the slight alteration in difficulty means you're less likely to be punished for flitting between styles rather than sticking with just one all the way through.The trouble is, though, once you start to prod under the surface of 'new' Devil May Cry, you realise what else has changed - almost nothing.\n\nThere's exactly one new boss (Jester, the tricksy character who dances past bullets and bleeds streamers), who turns up halfway through for a scrap. Trouble is, this doesn't fit the story and it's rubbish anyway, because all he does is sling some generic electro-balls around while you hollow-point his confetti lungs out.\n\nAbove: It looks like he's taking a bow. What a performance - bravo! Encore!"
