        "text": "What a hard question! On my first play through, I used Gunslinger and Swordmaster, and on the second run, I also started to use Trickster (it helps a lot when fighting against Vergil, haha). So maybe one of those would be the most useful style to me... but which one? I don't know. But I know it that if I mastered Royal Guard, it would be great. I've tried it a bit and succeeded at blocking something, but it's still a bit hazy part to me as to how exactly I did it, lol.\n\nWell the first idea that came to mind when I first bought the game was that probably all the styles are almost equal and I should probably choose the one that fits most, so since I was (and still am ) a sword maniac I immediatelly chose Swordsmaster. However, the more I played the more I realized the Swordsmaster only allows you to use different attack moves - which you already have however basic they might be. Same thing with the Gunslinger. If they made you stronger with 'swords' or something that would be nice, but no. Then it all comes down to Royal Guard and Trickster. Trickster is the easiest one to adapt yourself into, as it's always better to NOT get hit at all and your reflexes find it easy to 'think like that'. Royal Guard is for masters. You just sit there getting hit with no damage at all, and then release and possibly kill your enemy in one hit. It definitely is the best.\n\nHowever, Trickster is the one for me. Easy to use and fun. I play DMC3 after years and adapt easily to it, while to go back to how good I once was with RG is really a pain Trickster ftw! It saves both time and you.\n\nswordmaster. i came here to kick some demons? should it feel like an obligation,run for your life thing? nah,lets have some fun while at it,swordmaster,cause i enjoy owning my enemies with multiple hits variety and mid air by multiple weapons. vergil interested me in trickster,as darkslayer is practicaly a combination of the two,you can't go around with rebelion and slash people mid air in trickster the way you would with swordmaster though dante's beowulf is on the other hand,slow in swordmaster,especially the annoying 'go to hell!' move that hardly deals the damage it showcases with. royal guard is just no fun,excluding dmc4 where you can switch styles in-game. too monotonic... dopelganger is nice against vergil in mission 20 and at some other places,quicksilver was like fighting with no styles,i don't know how to use it,seams to drain the dt too fast. my list:\n\nSSS.darkslayer - multi air slashes\n\nSS.swordmaster - air slash combinations\n\nS.trickster - evasion,battle speed\n\nA.doppelganger - beowulf combo chains\n\nB.royal guard - guard and release,not really play worthy\n\nC.quicksilver - don't really understand the mechanics but its probably more fun then gunslinger\n\nD.gunslinger - not really a fan of guns"
