        "text": "Hell Vanguard\n\nDifficulty (DMD):\n\nLocation: End of Mission 2.\n\nRecommended Style: Trickster\n\nHell Vanguard's Profile\n\nThe first time you face the Hell Vanguard will obviously be the hardest, since his attacks are fast and very damaging when they connect, but it will prepare you for later on when he becomes a regular enemy. Fortunately when you learn his rather limited routine (he has 3 attacks in total) and keep on your toes he becomes a breeze. The ideal style for this battle is the Trickster style, as it will even out the speed difference between you two and help you evade his teleportation attacks.\n\nThe best method to avoid his attacks is by performing a jump (or air-hike if available) and using Trickster's ability to dash out of the way whenever he disappears, while this isn't a fool-proof strategy, I did find I was able to defeat the Hell Vanguard without being hit a single time this way. Take advantage of when he swings his scythe at you, after he misses he is left vulnerable for a few seconds and this is your chance to lay into him with some valuable stinger and combo shots.\n\nCerberus\n\nDifficulty (DMD):\n\nLocation: End of Mission 3.\n\nRecommended Style: Swordmaster\n\nCerberus' Profile\n\nConsidering Cerberus' is the second boss in the game, he really doesn't pull any punches! Even now I still find I have trouble with this boss. The first thing I must advise is to NOT just charge up to him and start slashing away, defeating Cerberus requires patience and an aggressive strategy will get you nowhere fast.\n\nFirst off, whip out Ebony and Ivory and chip away at the protective ice around his heads (and feet if you find time), this will allow you to actually harm him. Once you have done that it is recommended you give him some time to use one of his techniques and stay as distant from him as possible, this will give you ample time to dodge one of his many attacks. When he has done this, you then charge him and give him a quick slashing with your Swordmaster abilities, but try not to linger too long as you will have no time to evade his attacks as most of them are produced almost instantly. If you can dish out enough damage in one go then Cerberus will slump to the floor in pain for a moment, which grants you time to get a few extra hits in.\n\nAfter a while Cerberus will tend to regenerate the ice around his heads and limbs again, return to the entrance (as far back as possible) and fire away at his icing once again, followed by repeating the strategy I mentioned above. But beware of camping in a far corner or the back of the room, Cerberus is capable of reaching you from there. Your best bet is to not rush and just play it safe, keep an eye on Cerberus' condition and posture and use any health items when necessary.\n\nGigapede\n\nDifficulty (DMD):\n\nLocation: End of Mission 4.\n\nRecommended Style: Swordmaster\n\nGigapede's Profile\n\nGigapede isn't a particuarly difficult boss provided you are careful and watch out for his attacks, but he does take a while to beat as alot of the time he uses a tunnel-network type way of escaping. One of the fun parts of this boss fight is that you have alot of room to play with in this arena (it's massive!), this is mainly to compensate for Gigapede's ridiculously huge size though.\n\nI highly recommend you stick to the upper level for this fight, as you will need to jump on Gigapede's back when he appears out of his tunnels and hack at him while he flies around the level. Gigapede will attempt to shake you off his back from time to time by performing a barrel roll in the air, all you need to do is perform a jump and start blasting your dual pistols to keep you airborne until he finishes his roll, this will allow you to continue pummelling him from behind.\n\nIf you ever fall on the lower floor, try and return to the upper area as fast as possible as Gigapede has an electric attack that will virtually blanket the lower floor and you will also be wasting valuable time while he flies around the level. Keep an eye out for Gigapede's purple orb type attack though, they will follow you wherever you go but provided you are fast enough they will collide with a wall and diminish.\n\nAs I say, this isn't a particularly tough battle, even if you die once to this foe there's a good chance you'll have seen everything all he has to throw at you the second time round.\n\nAgni & Rudra\n\nDifficulty (DMD):\n\nLocation: End of Mission 5.\n\nRecommended Style: Swordmaster / Trickster\n\nAgni and Rudra's Profile\n\nThis battle sees you fighting two bosses at once, and I'll start by saying you'll make it a mush easier fight if you can lower both of their health bars to virtually nothing before defeating one, this is because when one is defeated, the remaining boss will become incredibly strong and if you are able to lower his health enough it is possible to defeat him in one hit in this state.\n\nA good strategy for this battle is by luring the two enemies into hitting each other with their weapons by strafing out of the way at the last second, this will cause they to be temporarily stunned and allow you to get a few quick hits in. Their techniques remain virtually the same throughout the entire battle so you don't have to worry about any surprises halfway through the fight. When the two run to the back of the room it means they are preparing to charge you so get some hits in with your handguns and go airborne to evade their attacks. And for Heaven's sake, make sure you dish out the damage to both of them equally and get both of their health as low as possible before defeating one or you will only be making the battle harder for yourself!\n\nThe key to beating these two is by either dodging their attacks or tricking them into striking each other and slashing away at them (it isn't quite this simple in practice but the concept still works).\n\nVergil #1\n\nDifficulty (DMD):\n\nLocation: End of Mission 7.\n\nRecommended Style: Royalguard / Trickster\n\nVergil's Profile\n\nYour first scrap with Vergil will easily be the most entertaining boss fight thus far, the whole idea of the seemingly invincible twins facing each other just sounds to good to be true! I recommend the Trickster style for this fight as you will need to be quick on your feet to avoid Vergil's deadly sword skills. Vergil is a master of swordplay and going toe-to-toe with him isn't a very wise plan, a good idea would be to provoke him into swinging at you and performing the SkyStar (double jump plus dash) technique out of the way if it's available. this will allow you to take advantage while he is preparing for the next attack, quickly get a Stinger attack in followed by a few slash's, but be careful he has a tendency of retaliating mid-combo and you will need to get out of the way.\n\nYou would also do well to fire off a few rounds of your handguns when there is a bit of distance between the two of you. Towards the end of the fight Vergil will begin to teleport to the edges of the roof and launch projectiles at you\n\nHeart of Leviathan\n\nDifficulty (DMD):\n\nLocation: End of Mission 8.\n\nRecommended Style: Swordmaster\n\nHeart of Leviathan's Profile\n\nYou should be thankful that you don't have to fight the entire Leviathan creature (by comparison it even dwarfs the Gigapede!), only it's heart, which to be honest is still bigger then you but it still beats fighting a couple hundred foot long monster. The Heart of Leviathan has three main parts to it; the Core and two pods either side of you, but to further complicate matters, you must first repeatedly attack one of the side pods in order to open up the protective layer covering the core, but you only have a short window of time to get some attacks in before it closes again and you are forced to repeat the process.\n\nVery simple in theory but the constantly spawning enemies will try and medal with your plans, I personally advise that you try and evade their attacks and focus on taking out the main side pods, and since the enemies are fairly slow you will have some time to attack the core before they come anywhere close. The core only has two attacks and both of them are very predictable and rather easy to dodge, one of which being an attack which involves three ridiculously slow energy balls homing in on your position, a good way to deal with these is stand behind the lesser enemies and have them take the blast for you. The second attack consists of a small red laser beam which works it's way from either the left hand side of the room to the right or vice versa, you can dodge this by jumping up and prolonging your time in the air by blasting away with your dual pistols. Although when the boss has lost around half of it's health a second laser beam will be added from then on.\n\nNevan\n\nDifficulty (DMD):\n\nLocation: End of Mission 9.\n\nRecommended Style: Gunslinger\n\nNevan's Profile\n\nFortunately this boss starts off pretty simple, and provided you learn her routine you can walk over her with ease. Nevan has a tendency of creating a shield of bats around her at regular intervals and it's up to you to remove this shield before she can receive any damage, this can be done by just slashing away with your Rebellion or any other weapon of choice. At the start of the fight she only has four specific attacks but fortunately she has a nasty habit of speaking a line which refers to the move she is about to perform. Her main attack consists of her hurling a string of bats at your direction, but these can be easily avoided by strafing or even walking out the way, this will also help lessen the amount of bats she has protecting her.\n\nIt's usually a case of avoiding her attacks, then giving her a good pummelling when you get the chance to weaken her shield then really letting rip when she's vulnerable. It also helps to get a few charged shots off with your ebony and ivory from a safe distance. Shortly after she loses a small amount of health she will add two new techniques to her arsenal, one of which is criminally easy to dodge, she basically electrifies the entire floor but simply jumping into the air and staying there till the effect wares off is all that's necessary. The second attack she occasionally performs is similar to Griffon's from the original Devil May Cry, where several electrical pillars are launched at you either horizontally or vertically, but these are equally simple to dodge by standing towards the side of the room and running to the opposite when she propels them at you.\n\nTowards the end of the fight she will attempt a life-leech type attack where she teleports to the center of the room and purposely removes her shield, be careful though as she intends to grab onto you and sap the life from you and use it to heal herself, and on the Dante Must Die difficulty she really makes a meal out of it (haha!). One way of avoiding this is to transform into your Devil Trigger form and she will be unable to perform that attack and with her shield down you can get in some well deserved hits. She will also attempt to use her original techniques but much faster, but provided you hang in there you should be able to beat her relatively easy.\n\nBeowulf\n\nDifficulty (DMD):\n\nLocation: End of Mission 11.\n\nRecommended Style: Trickster\n\nBeowulf's Profile\n\nBeowulf is definitely one of my favourite bosses, he forces you to be on the defensive and should you get hit by one of his devastating attacks you'll realise just how essential it is to keep on your toes. While he is a rather slow individual, his power more then makes up for it. During the start of the battle he pretty much sticks to a single strategy of throwing his fists around violently whenever you're close, and he has a habit of chasing you so don't expect to hide in a corner with your firearms throughout the fight.\n\nAfter he's taken a bit of a beating from you he will begin to run up to one of the corners of the arena and stomp on the floor till a large column falls, which he will propel at you pretty fast, you can either dodge this or blow it up using the Kalinna-Ann. One of his other new attacks consists of him launches multiple beams of light at you and these can be tricky to evade. He is also capable of transforming into a Devil Trigger like mode where his power will increase for a short time. Towards the end of the fight he will start pulling off moves at random, at this point it means he's fairly weak and the rest of the fight should be fairly straight forward.\n\nGreyon\n\nDifficulty (DMD):\n\nLocation: End of Mission 12.\n\nRecommended Style: Gunslinger\n\nGreyon's Profile\n\nThe start of the fight with Greyon may be a little misleading, don't go thinking it's a walk in the park simply because he keeps charging at you along the bridge and you can just jump out the way. After you've taken out a small portion of his health the bridge will collapse and the fight will continue in the coliseum below. This part is pretty straight forward as Greyon runs around the outside of the area firing missiles at you from his carriage, these are fairly easy to avoid provided you don't get careless. Eventually Greyon will begin to run down the center of the coliseum directly at you, this is your cue to get a few hits in. Whenever he's stationary you should always run up to him and strike him as fast as possible, sometimes he will collapse on his side for a short period of time allowing you to get some extra hits in.\n\nYou should use this strategy for a good duration of the fight until eventually Greyon will develop the ability to slow down time (he'll still move at his regular speed though), this can leave you with less time to doge an attack but I personally didn't find it to do all that much harm.\n\nYour best bet is to dodge his main attacks, wait until he is stationary and really lay into him when you get the chance.\n\nVergil #2\n\nDifficulty (DMD):\n\nLocation: End of Mission 13.\n\nRecommended Style: Royalguard / Trickster\n\nVergil's Profile\n\nGreat! Another chance to test your metal against your twin brother! Fortunately for you that this fight is fairly similar to the previous one. While Vergil has changed a few of his techniques and equipped Beowulf's gauntlets and boots, the basic premise of ducking and weaving and striking when he's vulnerable still remains. But what makes this fight all the more exciting is that you are both capable of using the Devil Trigger ability, but it's best not to try and go face-to-face with Vergil in this form as he will quickly sap your life away.\n\nLike the previous fight with Vergil, he uses a few combos here and there but always leaves a weak spot when he's preparing for the next set of moves so use this oppertunity to get a Stinger hit in, and a couple combos of your own. After you taken off a fair amount of his health he will start performing his Devil Trigger ability, and your hits won't do anywhere near as much damage, so our main goal is to knock him out of that state. Evade his attacks and strike whenever the opportunity shows itself. As the fight progresses Vergil will be able to sustain his transformation for longer and at more frequent intervals.\n\nLady\n\nDifficulty (DMD):\n\nLocation: End of Mission 16.\n\nRecommended Style: Gunslinger\n\nLady's Profile\n\nLady is quite possibly the easiest boss in the game, and unlike any of the previous bosses Lady does in fact become even easier as you progress. As she is a human and she's smart enough to realise that going toe-to-toe with a demon such as yourself wouldn't be such a great idea, she tries and keep as much distance from you as she can. Her primary weapon is her handgun, which deals very minute damage, and her secondary weapon is her Rocket Launcher that she likes to call Kalinna Ann, fortunately the rockets are very easy to dodge.\n\nWhile using your firearms you will deal a decent amount of damage but you will want to try and get in close and get a few melee hits in, this can pose difficult though as she is almost constantly on the move. A great way of countering her attacks is by using your Devil Trigger transformation to charge her and the damage she tries to dish out with be insignificant compared to what you give her. The only time you should be slightly worried is when she starts tossing multiple grenades at you, at this point you should keep your distance until she has exhausted her supply and then continue the assault. She will sometimes attempt to escape by using her grapple hook so try and stop her before she is able to do so.\n\nWhen she is nearing death, she will begin using a new technique where she will basically plant her rocket launcher into the ground and fire off a few heat seeking rockets your way, the benefit of this is that setting up this technique consumes a lot of time and she is extremely vulnerable during this period, making it idea to rush her position and give her a few slashes with your Rebellion.\n\nDoppleganger\n\nDifficulty (DMD):\n\nLocation: End of Mission 17.\n\nRecommended Style: Trickster\n\nDoppleganger's Profile\n\nDoppleganger is a very limited opponent, he will use the same tactic throughout the entire course of the fight, and once you learn his routine he isn't really all that much of a challenge, it isn't uncommon to defeat Doppleganger without taking a hit. Anyway, you will notice that at first your attacks will not inflict any damage to him, we need to turn on the lights surrounding the room to weaken him, to do this we must attack the shutters covering them. A good way of going about this is by striking the cover twice with your Rebellion, and before hitting it the third time wait for Doppleganger to charge you and hit it that final time to open it up right as he's within the perimeter, causing him to be temporarily stunned, which is your chance to tear into him with your favourite weapon, I personally recommend either the Rebellion or Beowulf by the way.\n\nHe will regularly attack you with an energy blast, followed by lunging forward and attacking you, both of which can easily be dodged with a quick Air Hike manoeuvre (or Wall Hike if you are using the Trickster style). Other then that he is a pretty straight forward boss, especially compared to some of your previous adversaries. I don't doubt you will breeze through him if you keep focused.\n\nArkham\n\nDifficulty (DMD):\n\nLocation: End of Mission 19.\n\nRecommended Style: Doppleganger\n\nArkham's Profile\n\nIf someone told you that Arkham absorbs the power of Sparda, I bet you would never have guessed he would have looked like that! But yes, the overwhelming power of Sparda was just too much for him and has turned him into some kind of blob, mutant... thing. Any who, \"Arkham's\" moves list isn't all that extensive, although the ones he has do pack a punch, provided you keep moving that will help ensure that his attacks miss more often then not. The only time you should begin to worry is when Arkham sinks into the floor and sends these small creatures after you, a good way of avoiding the majority of these if by keeping your distance and letting them explode from outside your radius, and disperse of the stragglers with a few simple sword swings or by equipping the Kalinna Ann. Once they are done with Arkham will rear his ugly head again which is your cue to give him a good beating and repeat the process till he loses around half of his health and a cutscene will interrupt the fight.\n\nOnce the short movie sequence has ended you will be informed that you will no longer be able to initiate your devil transformation, but as a trade-off, you will be able to control Vergil as well as Dante at the same time (how cool is that?). Vergil's help is definitely a welcomed addition, it's effectively like having a permanent Doppleganger technique! From here on it's pretty straight forward, it is possible to just hack away at Arkham and heal whenever your life gets too low, don't worry about Vergil though, he's invincible!\n\nVergil (Final)\n\nDifficulty (DMD):\n\nLocation: Start of Mission 20.\n\nRecommended Style: Royalguard / Trickster\n\nVergil's Profile\n\nAs you may have guessed, Vergil is your final foe and he really gives you a run for your money. All the training, levelling up, upgrades, etc you have done up until now has been preparation for this last duel. I hope you have alot of health items collected in your inventory because you will need them, fortunately though, if you do die, there is no level to backtrack, you just start the fight with Vergil again, which is a bonus.\n\nI wish I could give you the definitive guide to defeating Vergil, but the only real comfort I can offer is that every time you die (and let's be honest, you will) you will gain that little extra insight to his techniques and hopefully be able to read him that little bit better the next time round. As for his attacks, his basic combo attack is capable of depleting almost your entire health gauge, especially in his devil trigger form. It is essential you keep your distance when he performs this attack, and quickly charge in with a stinger attack to wobble him, but you must be almost lightning speed as his recovery time has increased alot since your last encounter.\n\nHe will also use the energy sphere technique that you would have witnessed in the last battle, only with a few extra energy spheres this time round, dodge them however you can. Every so often he will also use his devil trigger ability, at this point you should play it careful as his attacks are potentially lethal, try and keep your distance and blast away with your twin pistols (this will also help negate his health regenerating ability).\n\nIt's safe to say he pretty much holds onto this strategy throughout the fight but simply reading this isn't a sure-fire way to defeating him, he will catch you out with his attacks very often at first as his speed is just incredible. All I can suggest is hang in there, learn from his techniques and reflexes and try to predict his next move. Best of luck!"
