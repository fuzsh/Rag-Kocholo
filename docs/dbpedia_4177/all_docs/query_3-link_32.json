        "text": "Capcom has been re-releasing their older games on the Nintendo Switch. With Devil May Cry and Devil May Cry 2 available on the system, Capcom is completing the original trilogy with the final game. With Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening coming this February 20th.\n\nThis version will cost $19.99 and include everything from the Special Edition. This includes the ability to play as Vergil, the Blood Palace survival mode, and an easier difficulty compared to the original PS2 game.\n\nDevil May Cry 3 continued the seriesâ€™ trademark for intense, non-stop action with flair, while introducing the new \"style\" based combat system with six selectable options including Swordmaster and Gunslinger that change up the gameplay. Each style has its own range of features, and players can power up their favorite style for increased special attack abilities, bringing an extra level of strategy to the action. Devil May Cry 3 also introduced the ability to switch between currently equipped weapons on the fly for additional combat freedom.\n\nDevil May Cry 3 is considered the best in the series and is a prequel to the first 2 games. With Dante in his earlier years of being a demon hunter attempting to stop his brother Vergil from opening the gates to hell.\n\nThe game was praised for its incredible combo system and high-challenge. Especially after Devil May Cry 2's reception which many criticized for being too easy. A special edition would eventually release that included Vergil as a playable character and reduce the game's difficulty. The primary criticism for the special edition is that Vergil's campaign was not an original adventure but a copy of Dante's adventure."
