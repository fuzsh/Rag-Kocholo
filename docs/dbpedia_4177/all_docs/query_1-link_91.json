        "text": "Yes, I believe another thread for the re-released version was worth doing. Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition is well worth 50 bucks, but excluding that, it's only $20 to pick up!\n\nIn response to a few things, I'd like to get to the difficulty first. It's true that if you browse through the link I provided, you'll see that it was supposedly easier. I can only say the harsh beating was important, the challenge is what made the game so popular in the first place. My reason for even bothering with the series, because of the nasty attacks and incredible gameplay. But even so, from what I've seen in videos and IRL, this somehow beats the original DMC3 by a few inches.\n\nChanges - Advantages/Disadvantages\n\nGoods:\n\nVergil is playable with his own unique style called Dark Slayer.\n\n20% Turbo Speed is available for battle.\n\nGold Orb save system.\n\nNew difficulty levels.\n\nReturn of Bloody Palace Mode from Devil May Cry 2.\n\nMovie Mode to review Dante's and Vergils new videos.\n\nDante is still playable with all the goodies he possessed before.\n\nVergil is a completely different player in the series.\n\nWhat stands out the most is Vergil, Movie Mode and definitely keeping a good thing there, with new additions that doesn't destroy the gameplay from the previous. For my last point, he is nothing like Dante/Lucia from DMC2. In that game, both characters barely had the potential to be ''seperate characters.'' More like two begins who changed clothes and added one minor difference. On the other hand, Dante's evil twin is packed with new moves, sprite of course and other eye candy animations to keep your appeal. It's about time we fans can control Vergil, I've waited too long for the chance. (Chapter 19 in DMC3 was your only chance to use him, but watered down.) Anyone who played the original knows Vergil would murder Dante, so Capcom gave us the chance to give him a spin in combat.\n\nBads:\n\nVergil is almighty compared to Dante.\n\nOnly has his unique style opposed to the 6 Dante can use, which loses the variety of strategy you could control and enjoy throughout the game.\n\nDifficulty will seem non existant in some form for those who were used to the hard jammed difficulty from DMC, SE's is much easier thanks to Vergil's power.\n\nCan't unlock most of the games new content unless you have a save from DMC3 (can be imported) or beat the game. That includes Vergil's Story, Bloody Palace, Very Hard Mode and so on.\n\nFunny thing is, the bad will probably please those who complained of how hard the game was. Even if I label it bad in sheer opinion, it's also a good thing. More people can enjoy the game without the worry of dieing as much, and basically it's not as complexed when it comes to Vergil's term. Now a major problem would be not being able to get a hold of Vergil's story right away if requirements aren't met. DMC3 has been doing so well that they even came out with my DMC3 Manga Code: Dante and Vergil to come. Even the price is still set to $50 here and a few places. My suggestion is to either find a cheaper price elsewhere, depending on your area/location, or simply beat the game on this SE version. Rather unfortunate considering Vergil is meant to be the star of Special Addition, but some will have to cope. Also back to variety, moves of course will be limited for the controlled Dante counter. With only one style that's expected, but all powerful demonic killing ability is available to make up for it. It's a win/lose situation. Anyone who's me and always liked the DMC series (besides 2 o.o), you'll still find this re-vamped version worth getting. Also with a $20 price, not much to lose at all. (works even better for those who never got to DMC3) I'll stop here before I keep going on, you judge on if to grab or not from snooping out more info. Don't forget to share thoughts here. (To my surprise, this beats the very first DMC... DMC 3 was good, but I still had them tied... now with SE on the block, I donno.)\n\n~Blade~"
