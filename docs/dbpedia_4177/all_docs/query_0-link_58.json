        "meta_description": "For the longest time, Devil May Cry 1 was my favorite in the series for its simplicity, aesthetics, and Dante's initial design. This didn't mean that I didn't like DMC3 just as much though, I always enjoyed my playthroughs of the game, watched the cutscenes multiple times, and thought Dante's and Vergil's sibling rivalry made the game's story engaging. After finally getting around to playing the game as Vergil, I think DMC3 is now my favorite in the series. <br><br>Dante &amp; Vergil do have some similar weapons and abilities, but enough changes to make them feel different. Right off the gate, Vergil has access to devil trigger which makes the first few missions a breeze to go through. Like with Dante, you still have to buy new moves to unlock his full moveset. I've never fully unlocked either of their movesets, but from what I've played Vergil's is slightly more fun to use and stronger than Dante's. Despite this, Dante is still a blast to play too and I really like the weapons he has too except Nevan, that one didn't really resonate with me gameplay-wise. <br><br>DMC3 is a prequel that explains how Dante got the name for his shop and a few other events that happen in the first game. It may not have the most complex or best plot ever,  but in this story, Dante and Vergil steal the show. Personality-wise, Dante is at his peak here. His silly quips towards the other characters and the situations he gets in are genuinely funny. His goofy personality with the blend of getting serious when he needs to add that level of realism to Dante which is why he is one of my favorite video game characters. Besides being extremely quotable, Vergil is a fantastic villain whose tragic backstory, more serious personality, and his approach to gaining more power make him a masterclass rival to Dante and a lovable villain. I always looked forward to seeing the sons of Sparda banter with each other and the boss fights you get with Vergil are easily the best parts of the game. The final battle is a very intense, climactic finale that is fun and challenging to fight with an ending that will give you an emotional punch to the gut. <br><br>Devil May Cry 3 is a fantastic prequel and character action game that is one of the best in the genre defined by its enthralling gameplay and characters. I'd rank it an SSS.",
