        "text": "How cute are these real-life Once couples? By now, most everyone knows that Josh Dallas and Ginnifer Goodwin are both an on-screen and an off-screen couple. Interestingly, Jennifer Morrison (who plays Emma Swan) and Sebastian Stan (Jefferson/Mad Hatter), have also supposedly been linked romantically since 1√ó17 ‚ÄúHat Trick‚Äù was filmed back in Spring, 2012. Looks like things are going strong for both couples, who were just recently filmed at the the ‚ÄòPUNK Chaos to Couture‚Äô Costume Institute 2013 Met Gala together (May 6th, NYC).\n\nMad Swan: Jennifer Morrison and her date Sebastian Stan\n\nIt‚Äôs Snowing: Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas\n\nI saw a miniature version of one of the pictures of JMO & SS and I almost didn‚Äôt recognize him! For a moment I panicked thinking they had broken up and she was with someone else and then I found the other ones. His hair is so different! Loving JMO‚Äôs ‚ÄúMad Swan‚Äù hairdo though (I don‚Äôt know how better to describe that!)\n\nNot sure this is the best look for these four‚Ä¶but the couples themselves are definitely adorable! I loved that MRJ interview the other day where it was mentioned.\n\nKeeper of Hook's Trenchcoat.\n\nThat punk theme really made the actors and actresses make some interesting fashion choices earlier this week, LOL üòÜ\n\nJen‚Äôs hair is actually pulled into a french braid and then punked out to make the mohawk (I wish I could find the behind the scenes article I saw yesterday but I can‚Äôt right now) and I actually really liked her dress. She and Sebastian are adorable and I am SO happy that they‚Äôre still together. üòÄ I LOVE Josh in the bowtie and Ginny‚Äôs eye makeup probably took about an hour to put on and then two hours to get it all off again! That‚Äôs a whole lot of eye makeup. There‚Äôs an adorable picture of Ginny and Jen together from inside the party that Jen posted to Instagram yesterday although I don‚Äôt know how to link it here. Maybe someone else will find it!\n\n#MoreBOOMLessGloom\n\nYes, I totally agree with all your comments. I think it is so incredibly adorable and gives us so many feels when on-screen pairs become real couples! I am happy for JMo and Seb, and GG and JD. I wish them all the happiness in the world and hope they stay strong!\n\nKeeper of: Hook's eyebrow action, Emma's eye-rolls, David's sarcasm, Snow's \"She's kind of out of town\" to Tiny, and Rumple's \"Not telling.\""
