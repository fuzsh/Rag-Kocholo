        "text": "Once Upon a Time is coming to an end on ABC. Season 7 took the show in some bold new directions by replacing almost the entire cast and bidding a fond farewell to the characters who drove the fairy tale action for the majority of the series. Unfortunately for fans who love the new directions, Once Upon a Time did get the axe, and not too many episodes are left. The good news is that the series finale will bring back a number of familiar faces, including Jennifer Morrison herself as Emma.\n\nJennifer Morrison will reprise her role as Emma, and Emma won't be the only member of her family to appear. Snow White and Charming will be back as well, as Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas are both slated to appear in the finale. Additionally, Emilie de Ravin will return to play Belle once more. Once Upon a Time co-creators Eddy Kitsis and Adam Horowitz said this in a statement about the finale returns:\n\nThe series finale will mark the first time that Snow White and Charming turn up since the Season 6 finale. They got their own little happily-ever-after when they moved to a new house to raise baby Neal together, but Once Upon a Time will apparently bring them back for one more adventure. Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas as Snow and Charming set the series in motion back in the beginning, so it's only fitting that they're back for the end.\n\nThe series finale will mark the second time that both Jennifer Morrison and Emilie de Ravin appear in Season 7. Morrison turned up in the second episode of the seventh season as Emma to help explain what on earth happened between the end of Season 6 and Season 7, as well as to delight Emma/Hook fans everywhere with the reveal that she's pregnant with their child. Emilie de Ravin made an appearance to motivate Rumplestiltskin and reward fans who were missing Belle.\n\nThese four won't be the only characters from the first six seasons to return. Sean Maguire will be back as Robin Hood, Victoria Smurfit as Cruella de Vil, JoAnne Garcia-Swisher as Ariel, Robbie Kay as Peter Pan, Lee Arenberg as Leroy/Grumpy, Keegan Tracy as Mother Superior/Blue Fairy, and Tony Amendola as Marco/Geppetto. Rebecca Mader will remain as Zelena through the finale, and Jared Gilmore and Beverley Elliott will pop up as Young Henry and Granny in flashbacks for the twentieth episode."
