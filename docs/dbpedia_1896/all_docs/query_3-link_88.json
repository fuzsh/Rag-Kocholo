        "text": "ABC‘s Once Upon a Time may not be the simplest premise for a series, but what would one expect from the minds of former Lost writers and producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis?\n\nPHOTOS: Fall TV’s 12 Most Anticipated Shows\n\nThe series follows cynical bail bondswoman, Emma Swan (House’s Jennifer Morrison). She meets a young boy who insists that fairy tale characters actually exist and a curse has trapped them in the modern time, but even they don’t know it.\n\n“So, that’s how you’re mixing the reality and the fantasy is that those characters are living amongst us,” Morrison tells The Hollywood Reporter. “And it is fated in our storytelling that there’s a savior who’s going to come back and reverse the curse.”\n\nAs far as we know, Morrison’s character is the only one that isn’t derived from a fairy tale in the series. But costar, Ginnifer Goodwin (Big Love), not only plays Morrison’s mother, but also gives us a new take on the iconic Snow White.\n\nPHOTOS: ABC’s New Season TV Shows\n\n“We modernized her in many ways, because we wanted to make her relatable,” Goodwin tells us. “Unfortunately, as obsessed as I am with all of those Grimm’s slash Disney princesses, I do think women have evolved socially in so many ways… I think that we had the leeway to explore the sides of the character that you don’t know.”\n\nOnce Upon a Time premieres this Sunday at 8 p.m. on ABC.\n\nWatch THR’s full interview with Goodwin and Morrison below.\n\nEmail: Jethro.Nededog@thr.com; Twitter: @TheRealJethro\n\nRELATED\n\nTV Review: ‘Once Upon a Time’ and ‘Grimm’\n\n‘Covert Affairs’ Eion Bailey Plays the Perfect Stranger on ‘Once Upon a Time’"
