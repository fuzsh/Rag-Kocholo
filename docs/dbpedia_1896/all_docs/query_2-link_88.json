        "text": "In early June, Deadline announced that Margot Robbie would be playing Sharon Tate in Quentin Tarantino's next film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which is all about the Manson family murders in the '60s.\n\nYesterday, the Oscar-nominated actress posted a first look of herself in character. She looks exactly like Sharon Tate, the slain actress and model, who was married to director Roman Polanski. She also looks very much like herself, if we're being completely honest. 1960s beauty standards â‰ˆ 2018 beauty standards, no?\n\nIn June, Robbie's co-star Leonardo DiCaprio shared a photo of himself in character as Tate's neighbor, an actor named Rick Dalton, and Brad Pitt, who plays Dalton's on-screen stunt double Cliff Booth.\n\nRobbie, of course, has lots of experience with elaborate costumes and melting into very different roles. Last year, she was nominated for an Oscar for her role as Tonya Harding, in the same year that she played the demure Daphne Milne in Goodbye Christopher Robin. She was also a force as supervillain Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood will be in theaters in July 2019."
