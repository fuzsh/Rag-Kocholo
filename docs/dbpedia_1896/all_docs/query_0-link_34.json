        "text": "After years portraying Emma Swan on ABC's Once Upon A Time, actress Jennifer Morrison has been free of the drama and available to take the lead for new TV projects. Now, it looks like she's doing just that, as Morrison has signed on for the CBS pilot Under The Bridge, which has the potential to be the network's hot new fall drama. Scrub up and strap in, as Morrison is heading for a doctor drama that sounds far removed from a fairy tale.\n\nMorrison will play Caitlin Lancaster, a cardiothoracic surgeon who gets pulled from her self-appointed work break when her husband Michael gets voted off the medical practice board that the couple founded together. Under The Bridge will focus on Caitlin's drive to save her business and mend her relationship with her husband, as well as the friends that also work at the practice, following this dreadful chain of events.\n\nWill Caitlin be forced to choose between happiness for her marriage or for the business, or is this a situation where she can have both? Caitlin is described as being inoffensively ambitious, according to TVLine, but it sounds like she might need to get her claws sharpened.\n\nSupergirl actor David Ajalaw was previously cast in the pilot as the character Dan, who eyes for Caitlin back in the day. Dan got upset when she ended up marrying his best friend instead, and is now apparently getting some revenge. He votes alongside the board to remove Michael from the practice, which is taken as a personal sleight. Yeesh, it sounds like this place would be dramatic to work for.\n\nAs mentioned previously, Jennifer Morrison is attached as the lead, but the character's husband Michael has yet to be cast. This has the potential to be the first major television series for Morrison after Once Upon A Time provided CBS gives it the green light, although not her first major onscreen role. Morrison has appeared in the film world since the ABC series' ending.\n\nUnder The Bridge is written by Rina Mimoun, who has also written for dramas like Everwood, Dawson's Creek, and Mistresses. It's just the latest in a slew of recently announced CBS pilots competing to earn series orders. Grey's Anatomy vet Sarah Drew has a new project, Mike Colter's involved in a supernatural religious drama, and former NCIS star Pauley Perrette just joined a comedy pilot. Each one sounds like it could be a winner, so it will be interesting to see which, if any, gets rejected."
