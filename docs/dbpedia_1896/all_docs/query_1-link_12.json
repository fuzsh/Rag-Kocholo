        "text": "Unfortunately for fans of the ABC drama Once Upon a Time, the fairytale is drawing to a close. ABC announced its cancellation of the series this past February. The good news is that Jennifer Morrison is returning for the finale. Yesterday, the actress, who previously starred as Emma Swann on the cult hit, shared a selfie and a heartfelt message with fans, after she finished filming her final scenes for the series. Morrison left the show voluntarily at the end of Season 6, while many of her other cast members were let go to pave the way for a reinvention of the series, which included an almost entirely new cast. You can take a look at her message, below.\n\nFor Once Upon a Time's seventh season, the show underwent a massive reboot, which included an enormous cast shakeup. ABC also moved the show from its Sunday night slot into the ever-ominous Friday zone. The writing had been on the wall for a while. When she announced her exit from the series on Instagram, Jennifer Morrison assured fans that she planned to appear in one episode of Season 7. She similarly returned for the series finale of House.\n\nThe beloved actress kept her word to Once Upon a Time's passionate fans, when she came back earlier this season. In Episode 2 of Season 7, Jennifer Morrison returned as Emma Swan, to help complete the fan favorite's storyline. That included leaving her romance with Killian aka Hook (Colin O'Donoghue) on a happy note. Towards the end of Season 6, Emma and Killian actually got married. When Morrison returned to wrap-up Emma's story in Episode 2 of Season 7, it was revealed they were having their first baby.\n\nJennifer Morrison is not the only actor returning for the Once Upon a Time finale. Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, and Emilie de Ravin are among many other cast members set to return for the series finale. ABC previously announced that the two-part series finale would start on May 11 and conclude on May 18. The final episode is entitled \"Leaving Stroybrooke.\" Regarding the cast members returning for the finale, Once Upon a Time creators Adam Horowitz and Eddy Kitsis also told TV Line about the show's ending:\n\nEmma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) returning for the series finale is the perfect bit of full circle closure, fans of the show need. After all, Emma is the character the series originally revolved around. Having spent many seasons trying to find her happily ever after, she finally got it. With her return for the series finale, Once Upon a Time fans have to wonder if her happy ending will stick, and hope it does. Tune in for the final episodes of Once Upon A Time on Fridays at 8 p.m. ET, only on ABC."
