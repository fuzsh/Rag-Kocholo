Throughout the ABC drama’s five seasons, many major figures have perished along the way.\n\nBelow, The Hollywood Reporter rounds up all of the deceased Storybrooke and Enchanted Forest residents and remembers how they met their makers. This does not include those who have died and come back to life, like Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle) or Captain Hook (Colin O’Donoghue).\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nSubscribe Sign Up"
