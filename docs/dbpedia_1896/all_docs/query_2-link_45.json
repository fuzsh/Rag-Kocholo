        "text": "Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino's ninth film, is a fictional story centered around one of the darkest true crime events in American history: The murders committed by Charles Manson's \"family\" of cult members, including that of rising actress Sharon Tate. While it wasn't the only Manson-related project to hit theaters in 2019, Tarantino's candy-hued feature was the one that nabbed ten 2020 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Directing, as well as acting noms for Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt.\n\nThe movie's two main characters, actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Pitt), exist on the outskirts of Tinseltown and aim to boost their respective star potential. Their lives eventually intersect with Tate (Margot Robbie) and members of the Manson Family, who were living on a piece of land used to shoot Westerns called Spahn Ranch.\n\nDalton and Booth's quest for fame runs parallel to Tate's, whose career had just began to blossom, as well as Manson's: His failed dream to become a famous musician is thought to be a reason—if not the reason—he sent four of his followers to 10050 Cielo Drive in 1969.\n\nDiCaprio and Pitt's characters are fictional, though their friendship bears a strong resemblance to that of Burt Reynolds and his stuntman, Hal Needham. So who were the real-life people portrayed in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood? Find out below.\n\nMargot Robbie as Sharon Tate\n\nA model before her acting career began to take off, Tate's best-known film credits are her role as Jennifer North in 1967's Valley of the Dolls, and a part in horror-comedy The Fearless Vampire Killers. The latter was directed by her future husband, Roman Polanski.\n\nDamon Herriman as Charles Manson\n\nAfter spending much of his adult life in incarceration, Charles Manson began to amass a group of followers in 1967 who eventually became known as the Manson Family. Though Manson, a white supremacist and failed musician, didn't technically commit the nine murders that made headlines in the summer of 1969, he was convicted of seven counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder due to his major role. Manson died in prison in 2017.\n\nDakota Fanning as Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme\n\nA diehard member of the Manson Family, Fromme was nicknamed \"Squeaky\" by Spahn Ranch owner George Spahn, for the noise he claimed she made whenever he touched her. Though never directly connected to any Manson Family murders, Fromme did protest in and out of the courthouse throughout the trial. In 1975, she was convicted of an assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford, and spent 34 years in prison. She says she still loves Charles Manson to this day.\n\nMike Moh as Bruce Lee\n\nThe San Francisco-born actor and Hong Kong martial arts action star is best known in America for his roles in Enter the Dragon, Fist of Fury and TV show The Green Hornet, but he also served as \"karate advisor\" on the 1968 film The Wrecking Crew, which co-starred Sharon Tate. He was also good friends with both Jay Sebring and Steve McQueen. Lee's work had a clear influence on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood director Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill 1 & 2.\n\nBruce Dern as George Spahn\n\nGeorge Spahn was the owner of Spahn Ranch, the 55-acre property that served as a shooting location for Western movies before falling into disrepair. In the late 1960s, Spahn let Manson and his cult members reside on Spahn Ranch rent-free, in exchange for on-site work and sex with the girls of the Manson Family.\n\nAustin Butler as Charles \"Tex\" Watson\n\nConsidered Charles Manson's second in command, Tex Watson participated in both the Tate and LaBianca murders and was sentenced to life in prison for his connection to seven murders total.\n\nEmile Hirsch as Jay Sebring\n\nA close friend and ex-boyfriend of Sharon Tate's who was also murdered at Cielo Drive, Jay Sebring was a celebrity hair stylist thought to inspire Warren Beatty in his role in the film Shampoo. A fixture on the 1960s Hollywood scene, Sebring was also friends with Bruce Lee, who taught him martial arts.\n\nLuke Perry as Wayne Maunder\n\nMaunder was a Western actor who starred in the series Lancer from 1968-1970; in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, the late Luke Perry plays Maunder during his Lancer days.\n\nTimothy Olyphant as James Stacy\n\nJames Stacy co-starred as Wayne Maunder's character's brother, Johnny Madrid Lancer, on Lancer. Stacy was married to actress-singer Connie Stevens from 1963 to 1968.\n\nDreama Walker as Connie Stevens\n\nIn 1969, the singer-actress was famously quoted as saying that the Tate/LaBianca murders had \"scared the daylights out of everyone\" in Beverly Hills, reportedly stoking the fear that led residents to stock up on guns.\n\nRafał Zawierucha as Roman Polanski\n\nThe Rosemary's Baby director married Sharon Tate in 1968; Tate was eight-and-a-half months pregnant with their son when she was killed. Polanski was delayed in London for work at the time of her murder.\n\nDamian Lewis as Steve McQueen\n\nMcQueen was a movie star who became known for his iconic action scenes and car chases, in particular. A close friend of Jay Sebring—who introduced the actor to Bruce Lee—McQueen delivered the eulogy at Sebring's funeral.\n\nRumer Willis as Joanna Pettet\n\nThe British actress was a friend of Sharon Tate's. Pettet and another friend, Barbara Lewis, came over for lunch at 10050 Cielo Drive earlier on the day Tate was murdered. Her husband at the time, Alex Cord, was one of Jay Sebring's clients."
