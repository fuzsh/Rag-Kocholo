        "text": "Prepare yourselves for Jennifer Morrison's Once Upon a Time swan song. The actress took to Instagram to announce she is leaving the ABC fairy tale drama after season six.\n\n\"As I reached the end of my 6 year contract on Once Upon a Time, I was faced with a significant decision. ABC, Eddy Kitsis, and Adam Horowitz very generously invited me to continue as a series regular. After very careful consideration, I have decided that creatively and personally, it is time for me to move on,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"Emma Swan is one my favorite characters that I have ever played. My 6 years on Once Upon a Time has changed my life in the most beautiful ways. I am absolutely blown away by the passion and commitment of the Oncer fans. I am so honored to have been a central part of such a special show.\"\n\n\"The past six years of collaborating with Jennifer as Emma Swan have been truly magical. Watching her breathe life into Emma, she accomplished more than we could have dreamed possible—she gave life to a brand-new Disney Princess, filled with strength and intelligence and an incredible closet full of red leather jackets,\" Adam Horowitz and Eddy Kitsis said in a statement. \"We'll miss seeing her every day, but her imprint upon Once Upon a Time is indelible. She will always be a part of the show and its heart and soul. That said, just because Jennifer won't be back every week doesn't mean we won't see our savior again.\"\n\nEddy Kitsis, executive producer, added: \"I think if there's one thing this show has done, it's reinvented itself every year and so this show has the ability to be many different shows so we feel like creatively it's time to end a few stories but the new show, we feel like this is the kind of show that regenerates. And I think when you see the ending you'll go, ‘Oh yeah!'\"\n\nBut, if the show does end after season six, it will be a satisfying ending."
