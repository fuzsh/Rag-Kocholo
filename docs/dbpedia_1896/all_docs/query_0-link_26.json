        "text": "Adam Horowitz finally confirmed it via twitter yesterday:\n\nFor all those of who have been asking‚Ä¶ YES, ‚Ä™#OnceUponATime‚Ä¨ is scheduled to be at Comic Con. Details shortly! Hope to see you there!\n\nAccording to Once-Storybrooke.net:\n\nWho‚Äôs coming to the SDCC? @JoshDallas @GinnyGoodwin @JenMorrisonlive @RobertCarlyle_ @LanaParrilla @RaphaelSbarge @MeghanrOry @EmiliedeRavin\n\n‚Äî-\n\nMore info on the panel from TV Guide.\n\nThe actors present will be: Jennifer Morrison, Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, Lana Parrilla, Meghan Ory and Emilie de Ravin, as well as OUAT creators Adam Horowitz and Eddy Kitsis.\n\nAnd the panel will take place in Ballroom 20 at 11am on July 14th! Huge ‚Äòpromotion‚Äô compared to the small room they were in last year. Advice from someone who was there last year: GET IN LINE EARLY! Like, 7-8am early.\n\nThere will also be an autograph session in Room 28C from 12:15 to 1:00. Keep in mind, there will probably be some kind of lottery to decide who gets an autograph. Last year, they gave out tickets, and if yours had a stamp on it, it meant you could go get your autograph.\n\n‚Äî from tvguide\n\nRumbelle will be at Comic Con üòÄ üòÄ Any Oncers going to Comic Con this year?\n\nOkay, Robert Carlyle isn‚Äôt on the second list. He has to be there! I need both him and Emilie at ComicCon for Rumbelley good spoilers and moments!\n\nNo chance for me at ComicCon living in PA. However, last week we did have AnthroCon, largest convention of Furries in the world. Didn‚Äôt go to that, either. But it was unusual seeing all the furries, mascots, and costumes on the news for a few days.\n\nKeeper of Rumplestiltskin's and Neal's spears and war paint and crystal ball.\n\nI assume TVGuide would have the better information since their guy is the one who will be moderating. The date seems to be before the supposed start filming so maybe Robert won‚Äôt be back on this side of the pond yet. (Can you conference call table reads?) But sometimes the panel listings have people added and removed as I recall.\n\nFeel bad Jared doesn‚Äôt get to go though, seems like he really wanted to.\n\nI really wish we could go to Comic Con! If anyone can go, would you please try to get some audio from the cast? If nothing else, even something like ‚ÄúHi, this is ____ or you know me as ___ from Once Upon a Time, and you‚Äôre listening to ONCE podcast‚Äù would make our day.\n\nSan Diego‚Äôs Comic-Con International has announced their plans for Saturday, July 14. As to be expected, there are some great TV panels planned, including Once Upon A Time ‚Ä¶.\n\n11:00-11:45 Once Upon a Time‚Äî Magic is coming! Moderator William Keck (TV Guide Magazine senior editor and columnist) takes you to Storybrooke, where a curse placed on its fairytale inhabitants by the Evil Queen has been broken and reality and myth have merged. It‚Äôs a place where magic is about to be introduced, but with it comes its own set of consequences. Co-creators and executive producers Edward Kitsis (Lost, Tron: Legacy) and Adam Horowitz (Lost, Tron: Legacy), along with Ginnifer Goodwin (Big Love), Jennifer Morrison (House), Lana Parrilla (24), Josh Dallas (Thor), Emilie de Ravin (Lost), and Meghan Ory (Vampire High) engage in a Q&A about their hit TV series. Ballroom 20\n\nhttp://www.ksitetv.com/vampire-diaries/comic-con-saturday-tv-panels-once-upon-a-time-tvd-glee-grimm-more/15069\n\n\"That‚Äôs how you know you‚Äôve really got a home. When you leave it, there‚Äôs this feeling that you can‚Äôt shake. You just miss it.\" Neal Cassidy"
