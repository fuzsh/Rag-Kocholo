        "text": "“This Is Us” has enlisted “Once Upon a Time” alum Jennifer Morrison for a recurring guest role on Season 4, Deadline has confirmed.\n\nFor now, details about her character on the NBC hit are being closely guarded.\n\nAs Deadline reported last month, NBC gave “This Is Us” a mega-renewal, ordering three more seasons. In its most recent Season 3, the popular drama averaged a 3.79 rating in adults 18-49 and 13.8 million total viewers (Live+7). Season 4 of the series is set to premiere on Tuesday, September 24.\n\nMorrison appeared on “Once Upon a Time” for seven seasons. She will be seen next in the political drama, “The Report,” directed by Scott Z. Burns. The film is slated for a September 27 release.\n\nThe actress, director, and producer remains in demand, with numerous television and film projects in the pipeline.\n\nIn April 2016, she launched her own production banner, Apartment 3C Productions.\n\nThe company’s award-winning first feature “Sun Dogs,” which Morrison directed, was written by Anthony Tambakis and stars Michael Angarano, Melissa Benoist, Allison Janney, and Ed O’Neill.\n\n“Sun Dogs” recently won both Grand Jury Prize and Best Picture at the 2018 Mammoth Film Festival. The film was picked up by Netflix."
