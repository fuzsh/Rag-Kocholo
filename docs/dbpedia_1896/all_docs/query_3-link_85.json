        "text": "Jennifer Morrison's fairytale is over, as she has decided to quit Once Upon a Time and will not be back as a series regular if the show gets renewed for a seventh season.\n\nThe actress, who plays Emma Swan in the ABC fantasy series, broke the news on her Instagram account earlier today (Monday, May 8).\n\nIn her message to the show's fans, Morrison acknowledged that she was approached over the possibility to extend her contract, but declined the offer.\n\n\"After very careful consideration, I have decided that creatively and personally, it is time for me to move on,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Emma Swan is one of my favourite characters that I have ever played. My six years on Once Upon a Time has changed my life in the most beautiful ways. I am absolutely blown away by the passion and commitment of the Oncer fans. I am so honoured to have been a central part of such a special show.\"\n\nMorrison added that she will appear in one episode of season seven, if ABC picks the series up for another year. So the season six finale might not be the last we see of Emma Swan.\n\n\"If ABC Network does in fact order a season seven, I have agreed to appear in one episode, and I will most certainly continue to watch Once Upon a Time,\" she said.\n\n\"The creativity of the showrunners has always inspired me, and I cannot wait to see the ways that they continue to develop and reinvent the show.\"\n\nCo-creators Adam Horowitz and Eddy Kitsis have also paid tribute to the star (via TVLine).\n\n\"The past six years of collaborating with Jennifer as Emma Swan have been truly magical,\" they said.\n\n\"Watching her breathe life into Emma, she accomplished more than we could have dreamed possible â€“ she gave life to a brand-new Disney Princess, filled with strength and intelligence and an incredible closet full of red leather jackets.\n\n\"We'll miss seeing her every day, but her imprint upon Once Upon a Time is indelible. She will always be a part of the show and its heart and soul.\"\n\nThere's no word yet on which stars will be returning to the show if a season seven happens, but reports suggest that Robert Carlyle, Lana Parrilla and Colin O'Donoghue were also offered contract extensions.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether or not they will sign on."
