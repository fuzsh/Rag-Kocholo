According to Deadline, Jennifer Morrison won’t be returning as a series regular to Once Upon a Time if the series is renewed for a seventh season.\n\nFollowing a special musical episode that saw Morrison’s Swan marrying Colin O’Donoghue’s Captain Hook, Morrison, who has been with the show since the beginning, took to Instagram to announce her decision. “As I reached the end of my 6 year contract on Once Upon a Time, I was faced with a significant decision,” the actress wrote. “After very careful consideration, I have decided that creatively and personally, it is time for me to move on.”\n\nSince hearing the news, fans have been tweeting to share their sadness, with one Oncer writing, “How is there a Once Upon a Time without Jennifer!” Another joked, “Will Olivia Wilde now replace Jennifer Morrison” making reference to both actresses’ stints on House, when Wilde was brought in just as Morrison’s role on the show was scaled back.\n\nMorrison is expected to reprise her Once Upon a Time role as a potential guest star. In a statement, show creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz said, “The past six years of collaborating with Jennifer as Emma Swan have been truly magical. Watching her breathe life into Emma, she accomplished more than we could have dreamed possible — she gave life to a brand-new Disney Princess, filled with strength and intelligence and an incredible closet full of red leather jackets. We’ll miss seeing her every day, but her imprint upon Once Upon a Time is indelible. She will always be a part of the show and its heart and soul. That said, just because Jennifer won’t be back every week doesn’t mean we won’t see our savior again.”\n\nThe two-hour season finale of Once Upon a Time airs Sunday, May 14, at 8 p.m. on ABC.\n\nWatch: Doctor Who Star Peter Capaldi on why he decided to leave the show: ‘It’s a bit of a television factory’\n\nRead more from Yahoo TV:\n\nShould ‘Once Upon a Time’ Close the Book Without Jennifer Morrison?\n\n‘Once Upon a Time’ Musical Postmortem: Lana Parrilla Talks Channeling Bowie\n\n‘Once Upon a Time’ Hero and Villain of the Week: Music Lesson"
