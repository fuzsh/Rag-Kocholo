        "text": "Jennifer Morrison isn't the only Once Upon a Time star leaving the show.\n\nRebecca Mader – who plays Zelena (aka the Wicked Witch of the West) – will also be departing, making the announcement on her Instagram page after a seventh season was confirmed by ABC.\n\nShe began by congratulating the creators of the show as well as stars Lana Parrilla (Regina), Robert Carlyle (Rumplestiltskin), and Colin O'Donoghue (Hook) for the pick-up, before explaining her situation.\n\n\"A lot of you have been asking if I will be joining everyone in season 7, so I wanted to let you know personally that unfortunately I am not,\" she wrote.\n\n\"This wasn't my choice but a creative decision of the show that I totally respect and understand.\"\n\nMader spent a large part of her post praising the fans, calling them special for making her time feel \"meaningful\".\n\n\"The most important thing is that you all know how much you mean to me,\" she said.\n\n\"I am told frequently both online and in person that by being a part of such a special show, I have in some way changed someone's life. This is hugely meaningful to me.\n\n\"I am here to let you know that I am the one who has changed. Not just by playing such a well-written multi-dimensional character, but by the fandom itself. I have heard your stories, your pain, your struggles, your achievements, and I have truly felt you.\"\n\nSo we now know that Zelena is going as well as Emma Swan (although Jennifer Morrison did say she would be appearing as a guest in one episode). And we know that Regina, Rumplestiltskin and Hook will be back.\n\nBut what about Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin), Prince Charming (Josh Dallas), Henry Mills (Jared S Gilmore), and Belle (Emilie de Ravin)?\n\nWe guess we'll find out soon enough..."
