        "text": "“Once Upon a Time” alum Jennifer Morrison has been cast in a recurring role on Season 4 of “This Is Us.”\n\nDetails about her character are still being kept under wraps, an individual with knowledge of production tells TheWrap.\n\nBut if you’re already desperate to find out who Morrison is playing, you can start crossing off the days until you’ll have your answer, as NBC announced earlier this week the Dan Fogelman-created drama will debut its fourth season on Tuesday, Sept. 24.\n\nThe premiere date news follows last month’s announcement that the broadcast network had handed the series an unprecedented three-season renewal, ensuring you’ll still be with the Pearson Family through at least Season 6.\n\n“This Is Us” stars Milo Ventimiglia, Mandy Moore, Sterling K. Brown, Chrissy Metz, Justin Hartley, Chris Sullivan and Susan Kelechi Watson.\n\nThe series is executive produced by Fogelman, Isaac Aptaker, Elizabeth Berger, John Requa, Glenn Ficarra, Ken Olin, Charlie Gogolak and Jess Rosenthal.\n\nMorrison is best known for her roles as Dr. Allison Cameron on the Fox medical drama “House” and Emma Swan on ABC’s “Once Upon a Time.” She also had a notable recurring arc as Ted Mosby’s (Josh Radnor) love interest Zoey on the CBS sitcom “How I Met Your Mother.”\n\nOn the big screen, Morrison can next be seen in “The Report,” directed by Scott Z. Burns. Her other film credits include “Superfly,” “Back Roads,” “The Darkness,” “Alpha Alert,” “The List” and “Warrior.”\n\nTVLine first reported the news of Morrison’s casting."
