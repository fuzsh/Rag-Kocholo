        "text": "LISTEN HERE: ITUNES | POCKET CASTS | OVERCAST | SPOTIFY\n\nMy guest today is Hollywood actress, producer and director Jennifer Morrison. She’s known for her roles as Dr. Allison Cameron in the medical-drama series House and Emma Swan in an adventure-fantasy series called Once Upon a Time. She also appeared in movies like Star Trek and TV shows like This is Us and How I Met Your Mother.\n\nWe got connected through a workshop I hosted called “How to Crush it on Twitter,” which is exactly the kind of wonderful serendipity I talk about when I talk about why you should share your ideas online. We begin this conversation talking about Jennifer’s time playing clarinet in a marching band. Then, we spoke about how she finds inspiration for stories, chooses what to work on, and how she takes on the role of a character. But the best part comes at the end when we talk about imagination and a movie called “Field of Dreams.” Please enjoy my conversation with Jennifer Morrison.\n\nLinks\n\nFind Jennifer here:\n\nTwitter\n\nInstagram\n\nIMDB\n\nOther Links:\n\nThis is Us (Jennifer starts in Season 4)\n\nBands of America\n\nDavid’s Essay: What the Hell is Going On\n\nHaruki Murakami: IQ84\n\nShownotes\n\n1:36- How Jennifer Morrison began playing clarinet and what separates a world class marching band from a mediocre one.
