        "text": "It’s Kevin and Cassidy, together again! Justin Hartley and Jennifer Morrison, whose characters enjoyed a memorable friendship on NBC’s This Is Us, will reunite in the Season 1 finale of CBS’ Tracker.\n\nHartley recently let slip to Collider that Morrison would appear on the show in a “key role,” playing “an old family friend of [Colter’s] from way back when they were kids.” He teased: “That whole family dynamic leaks out a little bit through her experience with him in the finale.”\n\nMore from TVLine\n\n<em>Tracker’</em>s Melissa Roxburgh Weighs In on Colter and Dory’s Reunion, Shares Hope for Scenes With Jensen Ackles\n\n<em>Tracker</em>: Jensen Ackles Cast as Colter’s Brother Russell — Get Airdate and Storyline Scoop\n\nYoung Sheldon's Lance Barber and Zoe Perry Discuss 'Grounding' George Sr., Replacing 'Mom' in Big Bang Prequel\n\nSo, how do Hartley and Morrison’s characters cross paths? Airing on Sunday, May 19 (9/8c), the show’s first season finale finds Colter investigating the disappearance of two storm chasers — one of whom is the daughter of Morrison’s Lizzy Hawking, an old family friend — believed by local police to have accidentally drowned. But there’s always more to the story, so Hartley’s character makes sure to “uncover the seedy underbelly of a small town resort” in the process.\n\nMorrison is the latest in a series of significant castings for the CBS procedural. Not only did Hartley’s real-life wife Sofia Pernas guest-star as a fellow tracker earlier this season, but the show recently announced that Jensen Ackles (Supernatural) will appear on May 12 as Colter’s estranged brother Russell, and Melissa Roxburgh (Manifest) made her debut on May 5 as Colter’s sister Dory.\n\nTracker, which premiered after the Super Bowl to 18.4 million viewers, was renewed for a second season in March.\n\nCBS Reveals Finale Spoilers for 20 Shows\n\nView List\n\nBest of TVLine\n\nStars Who Almost Played Other TV Roles — on Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, Lost, Gilmore Girls, Friends and Other Shows\n\nTV Stars Almost Cast in Other Roles\n\nFall TV Preview: Who's In?
