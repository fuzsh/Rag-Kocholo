        "text": "Former House co-star Jennifer Morrison has signed on for a major recurring role on the upcoming sixth season of the CBS comedy How I Met Your Mother. The role, a new love interest for lead Josh Radnor‘s Ted Mosby, is described as a rabble-rousing activist who may or may not end up being the proverbial mother of Ted’s 2 children. Morrison landed the role shortly after reading with Radnor yesterday. In her comedy series debut, Morrison, who starts on the 20th TV-produced HIMYM on Monday, will appear in at least 5 and as many as 10-13 episodes.\n\nSince she left House last year, Morrison, repped by UTA and John Carrabino, did a Broadway play, filmed the upcoming Lionsgate movie Warrior and shot an episode of NBC’s upcoming drama series Chase."
