        "text": "Highest Rated: 94% Star Trek (2009)\n\nLowest Rated: 3% The Darkness (2016)\n\nBirthday: Apr 12, 1979\n\nBirthplace: Chicago, Illinois, USA\n\nAs the sympathetic and conflicted immunologist Dr. Allison Cameron on the hit television medical drama, \"House, M.D.\" (Fox, 2004-2012), actress Jennifer Morrison brought a touch of humanity, not to mention pulchritude, to the grave and occasionally morbid series. Prior to her breakthrough series role, Morrison had her career start in feature films, playing small supporting parts in films like \"Intersection\" (1994) and \"Miracle on 34th Street\" (1994). Following forays into the horror genre with \"Stir of Echoes\" (1999) and \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" (2000), Morrison began to make strides on the small screen; first with an episode of \"Touched By an Angel\" (CBS, 1994-2003), then with a prominent recurring role on the teen hit \"Dawson's Creek\" (The WB, 1998-2003). After appearing in \"Surviving Christmas\" (2004) and \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" (2005), Morrison landed the role of a lifetime on \"House M.D.,\" where she spent six seasons as immunologist Dr. Allison Cameron while being romantically involved in real life with co-star Jesse Spencer until 2007. Written off the show in 2009, Morrison moved on to play the mother of James T. Kirk in the \"Star Trek\" (2009) reboot before playing bounty hunter Emma Swan on the fairy tale hybrid series \"Once Upon a Time\" (ABC, 2011- ), where the talented young actress continued to thrive as a beloved TV star.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n94% Star Trek 84% Warrior 82% The Report 80% Sun Dogs 71% All Creatures Here Below 68% Bombshell 68% Stir of Echoes 53% Back Roads\n\nPhotos\n\nJennifer Morrison Ginnifer Goodwin, Jennifer Morrison in attendance for PaleyFest 2012 Panel Discussion with ONCE UPON A TIME, Saban Theatre, Beverly Hills, CA March 4, 2012.
