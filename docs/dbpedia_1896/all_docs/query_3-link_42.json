        "text": "Actor / Director / Producer\n\nJennifer Morrison is a multi-talented force whose dynamic work can be seen both in front of and behind the camera. In front of the camera, Morrison most recently co-starred on NBC’s widely acclaimed show “This Is Us” as Cassidy Sharp in an arc that carried over three seasons. She played the American Marine veteran who was battling an addiction while struggling to return to a normal civilian life. Morrison’s role was pivotal on the show as her character created a link in the broken Pearson family. Aside from acting, she has successfully shifted to directing as well as producing through her company, Apartment 3C Productions. Morrison’s next directing project will be for Peacock’s second season of their hit true-crime series “Dr. Death.” Morrison directed and executive produced the first four episodes of season two, set to premiere on December 21, 2023.\n\nMorrison has been a primetime television fixture for more than a decade. Her first big break came in the leading role of Dr. Allison Cameron on the Emmy Award winning medical drama, “House.” For six seasons, Morrison played an immunologist alongside Hugh Laurie, whose idealism and sincerity often brought her into conflict with her cynical boss, including unresolved romantic feelings for him. Most notably, Morrison was later cast as the beloved Emma Swan in ABC’s fan favorite “Once Upon A Time.” Over seven seasons, Morrison portrayed the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming, who audiences learn is the only person with the ability to break the curse cast over a fictional Maine town, comprised of fairy tale characters who are unaware of their true identities. The show, whose first season premiered as the top-rated drama series, received positive reviews by critics and garnered numerous award nominations, including Creative Arts Emmys, People’s Choice Awards and Teen Choice Awards. In between, Morrison starred in the sixth season on CBS’ award-winning long-running comedy “How I Met Your Mother” as Zoey Pierson. Zoey, a mischievous architecture whiz and headstrong social activist, was a humorous addition to the cast as Ted Mosby’s love interest.\n\nMorrison has honed her exceptional skills behind the camera, directing for various projects, including HBO’s “Euphoria” and the 2017 comedy-drama film, “Sun Dogs,” which she also produced through Apartment 3C Productions. Additional directing credits are Peacock’s “One of Us is Lying,” Paramount+’s “Joe Pickett,” AppleTV’s “Surface” and “Rise of The Pink Ladies” on Paramount+.\n\nIn 2016, Morrison launched her production company, Apartment 3C Productions, with the vision of utilizing the experience she has gained from working alongside talented directors and visionaries throughout her career, in order to craft her own voice as a storyteller across all mediums. Apartment 3C Productions has recently partnered with Anonymous Content to create a docuseries highlighting the passion and heart behind a family venture.\n\nMorrison is no stranger to the big screen either. At just 14, Morrison made her feature film debut in the 1994 film, “Intersection,” alongside Richard Gere and Sharon Stone, leading to a starring role in the horror film, “Urban Legends: Final Cut.” Her other acting credits include a starring role in “Warrior” alongside Nick Nolte, Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton; “Bombshell” with Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie; “The Report” with Annette Bening and Adam Driver; J.J. Abrams’ “Star Trek;” “Mr. & Mrs. Smith” starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie; NEON’S “Assassination Nation;” Warner Bros’ “Grind;” and Blumhouse’s “The Darkness.” In addition to her robust filmography, Morrison has appeared both on and off-Broadway as Kate Keller in “The Miracle Worker” in 2010 and Stephanie in “The End of Longing” in 2017."
