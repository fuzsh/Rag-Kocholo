When asked who her favourite character was on the series, she said “Baby Hope.”\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nJennifer Morrison talks hope, Baby Hope and her exit from Once Upon a Time at Calgary Expo Back to video\n\nApparently, this character has not had a lot of screen time yet on the series, which is currently airing its final season without Morrison.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Calgary Herald ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Calgary Herald ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\n“Oh shoot, did I just give away something I shouldn’t give away?” she said. “Oh well, it’s over. My baby’s name is Hope and she is adorable. You’ll meet her eventually. I’m totally in trouble.”\n\nMorrison told the Calgary Expo audience that she hasn’t actually been watching Season 7. She also talked about her exit from the series, which she announced last year. She will be returning “for a little bit” in the series finale, which is scheduled to air on May 18.\n\nUnlike Morrison’s departure from the series House, in which she played Dr. Allison Cameron for six seasons, her exit from Once Upon a Time was her own decision rather than the producers, she said.\n\n“My contract was up and I was personally really struggling with being away from home so much,” she said. “It’s nine-and-half, almost 10 months out of the year when you add it all up and it was six years of my life. I was away from the family and my friends and I was not feeling like it was the right thing for my life to be so far away from my life. So I made the decision on that one to do what I felt was right for my life.”\n\nMorrison has moved on to writing and directing, among other things. That includes directing her feature debut, the comedy drama Sun Dogs. But while the actress has a sterling record of being involved in projects that garner strong fan response — she was in How I Met Your Mother, House, was an original producer of Glee and even achieved geek-royalty status by playing Captain James T. Kirk’s mother on the 2009 Star Trek reboot — most of the questions on Saturday afternoon were focused on her time playing Emma Swan on the ABC favourite.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe series has found a devoted audience with its romantic and occasionally dark mash-up of fairy tales and folklore that borrows from, and often deliciously twists, characters from Disney franchises. The series began with Emma Swan being reunited with her 10-year-old son Henry, who she gave up for adoption. She learns she is the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming and returns to Storybrooke, Maine to help break a curse imposed by an evil queen. She becomes involved with a bunch of fairy tale characters, including an evil Peter Pan, a dashing Captain Hook and a creepy Rumplestiltskin.\n\nMorrison was asked a number of geeky questions about her favourite scenes, favourite colour (red) and favourite episode (Last year’s Song In Your Heart, a musical episode). She was even asked by a young fan which of her love interests in the series was the best kisser. (She plead “the fifth” and declined to answer.)\n\nStill, it was clear that while she made have left Storybrooke behind, the series and character still meant a great deal to her.\n\n“It’s a show about hope and a show about positivity and about connectivity and I think there aren’t a lot of shows like that,” she said. “It’s really nice to be a part of something that encourages people to believe in themselves and believe in the best versions of themselves and to have hope to have the life that they have.”\n\nThe Calgary Comic and Entertainment Expo runs until Sunday at Stampede Park.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
