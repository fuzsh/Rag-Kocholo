        "text": "Justin Hartley is reunited with an old friend during Sunday’s Tracker finale (CBS, 9/8c) — and TVLine has an exclusive first look.\n\nThe above trailer marks the debut of Hartley’s This Is Us co-star Jennifer Morrison, who guest-stars in the dramatic conclusion to CBS’ freshman hit. The episode, titled “The Storm,” sees Colter investigate the disappearance of two amateur storm chasers — one of whom is the daughter of Morrison’s Lizzy Hawking, an old family friend — that the local police have written off as an accidental drowning. Before long, “Colter’s expert tracking skills lead him to uncover the seedy underbelly of a small town resort,” according to the official logline, and that’s where things get real intense.\n\nHartley previously let slip to Collider that Morrison would appear on the show in a “key role,” playing “an old family friend of [Colter’s] from way back when they were kids…. That whole family dynamic leaks out a little bit through her experience with him in the finale.”\n\nMorrison is the latest in a series of significant castings for the CBS procedural. Not only did Hartley’s real-life wife Sofia Pernas guest-star as a fellow rewardist earlier this season, but the show recently welcomed Melissa Roxburgh (Manifest) as Colter’s sister Dory, and Jensen Ackles (Supernatural) as Colter’s estranged brother Russell. (Both Roxburgh and Ackles are expected to be back, though neither will appear in the May 19 finale.)\n\nThe House and Once Upon a Time vet joined This Is Us in Season 4 as Cassidy Sharp, a Marine recently returned from duty whose rough reentry into normal life tore her family apart. She eventually befriended Hartley’s Kevin Pearson, and remained a fixture on the NBC drama through its sixth and final season.\n\nTracker was previously renewed for Season 2. It will return to CBS this fall in its new, Sundays-at-8 time slot, where it lead into Season 5 of Queen Latifah’s The Equalizer. A premiere date has not yet been announced."
