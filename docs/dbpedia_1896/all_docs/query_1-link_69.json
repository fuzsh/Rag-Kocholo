        "text": "There is going to be a massive void to fill when ABC‚Äôs Once Upon a Time returns for its newly announced seventh season.\n\nOriginal stars Ginnifer Goodwin (Snow White), Josh Dallas (Prince Charming), Jared Gilmore (Henry) and Emilie de Ravin (Belle) are joining Jennifer Morrison and Rebecca Mader by exiting the series after season six, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.\n\nSet to return for season seven are Lana Parrilla (Regina), Robert Carlyle (Mr. Gold) and Colin O‚ÄôDonoghue (Captain Hook), who re-signed new contracts for the rebooted seventh season, which is said to include a big time jump.\n\n‚ÄúWords can‚Äôt do justice to what Ginny, Josh, Emilie, Rebecca and Jared brought to Once Upon a Time ‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôll try ‚Ä¶ Never have we had the privilege of working with a more talented group of collaborators,‚Äù creators/showrunners Eddy Kitsis and Adam Horowitz said in a joint statement. ‚ÄúEach brought unique talent, incredible intelligence, and their own individual bit of magic as they gave life to these iconic characters. ‚Ä¶ We can‚Äôt thank them enough for the hard work, dedication and passion they delivered day in and day out. Without them there would be no Once Upon a Time. As Once continues, this group will always be the beating heart of the show. And even though we won‚Äôt be with them every week, in a show about magic and hope, we fervently believe it won‚Äôt be the last we see of them.‚Äù (Morrison is expected to return for one episode next season.)\n\nGoodwin and Dallas met, married and had two sons together during their six-year run on the show. Their departures come as little surprise, as the couple had been expected to exit after season six.\n\n‚ÄúGinny reinvented Snow White for a modern audience ‚Äî there was no way she would be stuck cleaning up after dwarfs, she created an iconic empowered heroine for the 21st century,‚Äù said Kitsis and Horowitz. ‚ÄúJosh mined the depths of Prince Charming ‚Äî a character who in myth was just a ‚Äòtype‚Äô but in his superlative interpretation became a complex man fighting for love and family.‚Äù\n\nDe Ravin was a guest-star in season one and was promoted to a regular for season two. She leaves after reuniting with Kitsis and Horowitz following her role on ABC‚Äôs Lost.\n\n‚ÄúEmilie took the character of Belle to a deep and soulful place, bringing great intelligence and warmth to the character, making her fiercely independent, strong-willed but also an eternal optimist who saw only the best in all those she encountered,‚Äù said the producers.\n\nDe Ravin opened up about her departure late Friday on Instagram. ‚ÄúWhile I would have loved to continue exploring Belle‚Äôs journey, the show has decided to move in a different creative direction,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúMassive thank you to all the fans for your incredible love & support towards me & this character over the past 6 yrs. It‚Äôs been an honor & a privilege to bring Belle to life üôÇ Congrats to Adam & Eddy & the returning cast & crew!! I wish you all a wonderful 7th Season!!‚Äù\n\nMader, who also came from Lost, announced her departure late Thursday and said her exit was a creative choice by the show and not something she wanted.\n\n‚ÄúRebecca took us on a broomstick roller coaster ride as she reinvented the Wicked Witch of the West by finding the pain beneath the green. She made the character soar to incredible heights while always keeping her grounded and relatable,‚Äù said Kitsis and Horowitz.\n\nGilmore, meanwhile, has grown up on the show. His Henry will likely be featured in the rebooted seventh season with The Walking Dead alum Andrew J. West playing an older version of the character.\n\n‚ÄúJared literally grew up before the eyes of millions, from a child actor with enormous innate talent to a young man whose abilities continue to astound as he created a character who truly, as we say on the show, has the heart of the truest believer,‚Äù said Kitsis and Horowitz.\n\nOnce is poised to feature a big time jump next season, which will include West and Jane the Virgin‚Äòs Alison Fernandez, who both will make their debut in Sunday‚Äôs two-hour season finale.\n\n‚ÄúThere are set endpoints to different stories,‚Äù Horowitz said recently of the supersized episode. ‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt new stories for different characters. I think that by the end of the season finale, a lot of what we‚Äôve been doing for the last six years is wrapped up ‚Äî we hope in a very satisfying way ‚Äî and then we move forward in a way that at the end of it, hopefully you‚Äôll see what we‚Äôre hoping to do in season seven.‚Äù\n\nAdded Kitsis: ‚ÄúWe feel like we‚Äôve completed this story, and the next chapter of Once Upon a Time will be completely different. ‚Ä¶ Creatively, it‚Äôs time to end a few stories.‚Äù"
