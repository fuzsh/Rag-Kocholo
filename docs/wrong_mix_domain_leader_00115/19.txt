Biography[]

Alec Douglas-Home was born on 2 July 1903 in London to Charles Douglas-Home, later 13th Earl of Home. He studied at Eton College and represented it at various sporting events. He became involved in the Unionist Party in the 1929 and utlimately was elected to the House of Commons in 1931 and became involved with the Conservative government, eventually becoming a parliamentary aide to Neville Chamberlain. In 1940, he volunteered for military service, but was diagnosed with spinal tuberculosis and instead he underwent an operation and spent the following years recovering. In 1943, he returned to the House of Commons and participated in Leopold Amery’s cabinet’ policymaking related to foreign affairs. In the 1945 general election, however, he lost his seat to the Labour Party candidate, but narrowly defeated him again in 1949. In 1951, his father died and Douglas-Home inherited the title Earl of Home, becoming a member of the House of Lords, but shortly after he was nominated by Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies to become the Governor-General of Australia. He replaced Herbert Vere Evatt in the office after Evatt started a constitutional crisis in Australia for refusing to grant Menzies an early election after a proposal was passed through the House of Representatives but rejected by the Senate. Shortly after arriving in Canberra, Douglas-Home called an early election for 1952.
