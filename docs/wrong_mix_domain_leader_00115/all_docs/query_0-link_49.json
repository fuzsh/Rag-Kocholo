        "text": "On 13 November 2023, former UK Prime Minister David Cameron was appointed as Britain’s Foreign Secretary by current PM Rishi Sunak in a cabinet reshuffle. Cameron, who had been away from frontline politics since his resignation in 2016, was seen as a surprising pick due to how uncommon it was for a former Head of State or Government to serve under a successor.\n\nAfter all, once one have led a country, there isn’t much higher one can go on the career ladder. Thus, accepting any other role may often be seen as a demotion, especially when one has already left a legacy that warrants either a well-deserved retirement or more lucrative prospects such as book deals or speaking tours.\n\nHowever, like David Cameron, there have been a number of world leaders from all around the world who over the years have chosen to work under their successors following their own tenure at the very top. Be it due to some sort of demotion or a personal desire to continue serving the people, here are 4 world leaders who served under their successors."
