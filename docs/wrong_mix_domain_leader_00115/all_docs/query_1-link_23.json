For many people, the feeling that 'it was time for a change' might affect the way they vote.\n\nI agree with The History Man in several of his well-thought-out points. One area he did not touch too deeply is that of Defence, where the TSR2 would survive because Alec Douglas-Home is not hell-bent on destroying British Industry. But the effects would be far greater in the shipbuilding sector.\n\nUpon their retention of power, the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth II, the much maligned CVA-01 project would be ordered in December 1964. I have seen a great deal of speculation that she would be built on the Clyde, with an earlier shotgun marriage of John Brown, Fairfield, Alexander Stephens and Connell into Upper Clyde Shipbuilders. The noted British naval historian David Hobbs points out that the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders received some £ 60 million in government subsidies by the time it folded in 1972 – roughly the same as the cost of building the aircraft carrier. While this is true, about £ 23.5 million went to Cunard to fund the large transatlantic liner QE 2, and would have been ponied out anyway to that ship at John Brown. Still, some £ 36 million plus would be available for HMS Queen Elizabeth II. Additional funding would come from avoiding the huge cost overruns on the F-4K and F-4M Phantoms by using GE J-79 engines instead of Rolls-Royce Speys. With the TSR 2 going forward, there is no pressure for British content in the Phantoms.\n\nI doubt HMS Queen Elizabeth II would be built on the Clyde. Harland and Wolff, Belfast had the best time and cost record for completing aircraft carriers postwar, and the best management team. She would be laid down in December 1965-January 1966, thus too far to cancel if a March 1966 election were lost. Her launch will come 24-30 months later, and she will complete in the summer of 1970. The only real competitor is Cammell-Laird, Birkenhead (CL), which is committed to the “Resolution” class SSBN programme.\n\nThe fifth SSBN, HMS Ramilles will not be cancelled, and ordered, probably in January 1965 from Vickers-Armstrong, Barrow (VAB). She is laid down on the slip vacated by HMS Resolution in December 1966, launched in June 1969 and completed in July 1970. Again, orders for her reactor have absorbed enough money to make her immune from cancellation. Displaced from VAB, the nuclear attack submarine HMS Churchill is ordered from CL in October 1965 with her OTL building time.\n\nThe Conservatives will also accept, rather than reject a South African order for three “Oberon” class submarines in 1965. The Conservative policy was to sell weapons useful for national defense, but not internal security. Submarines could not be used in crowd control, neither could Hawker Siddeley Buccaneer S 50. The Conservatives will sell the additional 20 Buccaneers in 1965, and an additional ten Westland Wasp ASW helicopters. The Conservatives pragmatically knew the South Africans would place orders with rival French firms if denied British arms. (In the OTL, the South Africans purchased French “Daphne” class boats.) The Douglas-Home Government will place the May 1965 order with Chatham Dockyard where three Canadian “Oberons” are being built.\n\nIn August 1965, the Indian Navy also sought a trio of “Oberons” which the Wilson Government rejected in OTL. The reason given was to avoid fueling an arms race in the Third World. The Indians were not amused, the Pakistani Navy acquired the USS Diablo (SS-479) a modernized “Fleet Snorkel” World War II vintage submarine in 1964. The Indian Navy also had an alternative supplier in the Soviet Union which sold three “Foxtrot” class submarines in September 1965. The Soviet vessels were much cheaper, but the Indian Navy wanted, and were willing to pay for the much more capable “Oberon” class. The Indian Navy ordered a fourth boat in June 1966, two in March 1968, and a final pair in January 1970. These follow-on orders would have gone to British yards if the first three were sold. The following table gives estimated building data.\n\nSubmarine Builder Order Laid Down Launched Completed\n\nSAS Maria Van Reebock Chatham Mar 65 Nov 66 Oct 68 Jun 70\n\nSAS Emily Hobhouse Chatham Mar 65 Jun 67 Apr 70 Jan 71\n\nSAS Joanna Van Der Merve Chatham Mar 65 Nov 68 Oct 70 Jul 71\n\nINS Kalvari CL Aug 65 Mar 66 May 67 Jul 68\n\nINS Kandera CL Aug 65 May 66 Sep 67 Jan 69\n\nINS Karanj Scotts Aug 65 Oct 67 Jan 69 Oct 70\n\nINS Kesura CL Jun 66 May 68 Aug 69 Dec 70\n\nINS Vagir Chatham Mar 68 May 70 Nov 71 May 73\n\nINS Vela CL Mar 68 Dec 69 Oct 71 Aug 73\n\nINS Vagli Scotts Jan 70 Dec 70 Oct 72 Aug 74\n\nINS Vagsheer Chatham Jan 70 Jan 72 Jul 73 Dec 74\n\n(Apologies - I cannot get the table to format)\n\nThere are three significant advantages of the RN orders and additional construction of conventionally powered submarines for export. The first is the exports reduce the hemorrhaging balance of payments over a period of ten years by about £ 130 million to perhaps as much as £ 150 million. While that does not solve all the problems with Sterling in the 1960s and 1970s, it certainly will help. The second is the incentive for Chatham and CL to be modernized with newer, more efficient construction techniques. Harland and Wolff and Scotts were already ahead in that field. The third is not just the additional employment in British industries but the kind of employment. There are powerful incentives to train a younger workforce for the modernized shipyards instead of milking the last remnants of the expanded labour pool left from the Second World War.\n\nThe single part of the superb The History Man analysis I disagree with is the withdrawal from East of Suez will remain as OTL. The reason for this precipitous action was actions by Kuwait, Bahrain, Iran and other nations under the umbrella of British protection to join the short-lived boycott and embargo of oil exports to Great Britain after the Six-Day War. In addition, nations East of Suez were placing increasing restrictions on overflights of RAF aircraft to and from Singapore. Perceived as a mix between a double-cross and grotesque ingratitude, the shock waves through Whitehall led to a consensus to let the former clients fend for themselves. They were unworthy of a single additional tuppence. This reappraisal would happen regardless of whether Conservatives or Labour held power, and the Heath Government did not reverse the policy when it came to power in 1970.\n\nHaving said that, the retention of a Royal Navy carrier strike force and its supporting escorts and fleet train would enable the British Government to continue to project power East of Suez if it so desired. In addition, the Argentines will never attempt to capture the Falklands in April 1982."
