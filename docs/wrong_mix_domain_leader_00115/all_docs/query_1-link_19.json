        "text": "Sir Alec Douglas-Home, previously Earl Home, was a Conservative politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1963 to 1964, succeeding Harold Macmillan.\n\nThe Light's agents in the Conservative Party had ensured he became party leader, seeing him as a fool who'd be a good fall guy for their plot to destroy the US and the Soviet Union. Sir Francis White later remarked that this was why his rise was so \"surprising\". After the assassination of his Defence Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister, he was steered into appointing Light men, including his Chief Whip, Sir Robert Devere, to those positions. However, the Intrusion Countermeasures Group, the Seventh Doctor, and Ace were able to thwart the plot and save Douglas-Home's life. The Doctor and Ace briefly met him at the Starfire launch and he was able to call off an army pursuit of them. (AUDIO: 1963: The Assassination Games [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn 1964, there was a failed attempt to kidnap him, which was subsequently covered up by the British government. Sir Toby Kinsella once remarked that the civil service's job was \"trying to work out what Earl Home [accidentally calling him that] thinks so we can agree with him before he's said it.\" (AUDIO: The Pelage Project [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nLater that year, he was succeeded by Harold Wilson as the Labour Party won the general election. General Peters regarded Douglas-Home as ineffectual but believed that he had the right idea about the United Kingdom's place in the world. (AUDIO: State of Emergency [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nA photograph of Douglas-Home was present, along with other holders of the office, on the stairs of 10 Downing Street.
