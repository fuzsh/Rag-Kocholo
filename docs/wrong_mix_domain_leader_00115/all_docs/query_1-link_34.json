        "text": "Yes - Sunak and Starmer's meetings with the King are published in the Court Circular, the official listing of the day's Royal events. The entry for July 5th states:\n\nThe Rt Hon Rishi Sunak MP had an audience of The King this morning and tendered his resignation as Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury which His Majesty was graciously pleased to accept. Mrs Murty was also received by The King.\n\nHis Majesty received in audience the Rt Hon Sir Keir Starmer MP today and requested him to form a new Administration. The Rt Hon Sir Keir Starmer MP accepted The King’s offer and kissed hands upon his appointment as Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury.\n\nLady Starmer was also received by His Majesty.\n\nThe list of business transacted at Privy Council meetings is also published, with the meeting for July 6th including Sir Keir and several of his ministers swearing or affirming their oaths of office:\n\nThis day the Right Honourable Sir Keir Starmer KCB KC (Prime Minister) did, by His Majesty’s command, make solemn affirmation as First Lord of the Treasury.\n\nThe King doesn't tell Westminster who is boss, it is the other way round.\n\nThe King appointing the PM is a formality - everyone knows who the PM is before it happens. The King is not making a decision, he is rubber stamping a decision that has already been made. In the case of a general election, this decision is made by the public choice picking which party holds a majority and thus which party's leader is now PM. Kier Starmer did not go to the King until the election was (almost) complete and everyone knew that he had a majority in Parliament.\n\nWhen the PM is changed mid-Parliament, the decision is made by the party choosing its new leader, but again that decision is made before the new leader goes to the King. Thus, when Rishi Sunak became PM his appointment as Party Leader was made before the meeting with the King.\n\nSo the new PM isn't coming back from the King and saying to Westminster, \"The King says I'm the boss now\", the PM is going to the King and saying \"Westminster says I'm the boss now\"."
