        "text": "The costs were sky-high, too\n\nIn June 1964, a Cabinet Office civil servant drew up a worried memo for the Prime Minister, Alec Douglas-Home.\n\nLess than two years after the British and French Governments had signed a deal to develop the Concorde supersonic aircraft, and five years before its maiden test flight, the project was already spiralling out of control.\n\n\"There were always doubts about this project,\" the civil servant wrote, pointing out that it was already projected to cost as much as two Channel Tunnels.\n\nEven assuming the host of technical snags could be ironed out, the sales outlook was highly uncertain, and state airline BOAC risked being saddled with \"yet another unwelcome and uneconomic aircraft\".\n\nThe Anglo-French entente made the project hard to junk outright, the civil servant conceded, but \"a complete commitment... should be avoided for the time being.\"\n\nInevitable disaster\n\nShame no-one listened.\n\nCONCORDE TIMELINE\n\n1962: Anglo-French accord signed\n\n1962: \"Concorde\" name coined by Charles de Gaulle\n\n1964: New UK Labour Government withdraws from project\n\n1965: Government returns to project\n\n1966: First prototypes assembled\n\n1967: First Concorde unveiled\n\n1969: First test flight in UK\n\n1975: Bookings begin for first scheduled services, to Bahrain and Rio\n\n1976: Commercial services begin; Washington routes added\n\n1977: Services to New York begin, after years of opposition over noise levels\n\n1978: Governments announce no more Concordes will be built\n\n1980-81: Services to many destinations discontinued amid mounting concern over Concorde's economic viability\n\n1982: Air France cuts back all services except New York route\n\n1994: BA cuts back routes to focus on New York and charter market\n\n2000: Air France Concorde crashes near Paris - first major incident in 25 years\n\n2001: Services restart after almost 18 months on the ground and £17m in safety investment\n\n2003: Concorde flies for the last time\n\nConcorde has always appealed far more to politicians and engineers than to administrators and economists.\n\nA trawl through the cabinet archives for Concorde's development phase - slowly becoming public under Britain's 30-year disclosure rules - reveals a torrent of official contempt for the project.\n\nAs late as 1971, when the aircraft was to all intents and purposes a fait accompli, Concorde was being called \"a commercial disaster\", which \"should never have been started\".\n\nBut the same paper conceded that political considerations gave London no choice but to \"commit itself whole-heartedly and publicly to Concorde\".\n\nA big-budget project powered by politicians, but reviled by those who fund and administer it, was never going to be an economic success.\n\nIn 1962, Concorde was projected to cost £160m (about £2bn or $3.1bn in today's money).\n\nBy 1975, the year before commercial launch, more than £1.2bn - at least £11bn today - had been spent.\n\nThat's partly because the designers ran into a number of unforeseen problems, especially surrounding noise levels and the aircraft's revolutionary drooping nose.\n\nBut the overrun was also the result of interminable political spats across the Channel.\n\nAt one point, work was halted after the French insisted that the plane should have a Gallic final letter \"e\" in its name - the British stolidly referred to it as \"Concord\" during development.\n\nThe French, of course, got their way.\n\nWhite elephant\n\nIf you force yourself to forget about the horrible trouble and expense of developing the aircraft, it is just about possible to make a commercial case for it.\n\nNot exactly the lap of luxury\n\nBritish Airways was always reluctant to talk precise numbers, but it was reckoned to make a £20m annual operating profit from its London-New York Concorde service.\n\nBut even that figure is flattering.\n\nConcorde was foisted on British Airways and Air France by their governments; not a single aircraft was ever commercially sold.\n\nMany airports refused to welcome Concorde, citing noise regulations.\n\nAnd although Concorde became the transport of choice for a few hundred rock stars and fashion designers, many of the well-heeled were put off by the cramped cabin conditions and sky-high prices.\n\nOn Concorde, a return flight across the Atlantic could easily cost £8,000, compared with £3,000 or so in vastly more comfortable first class on a Jumbo Jet.\n\nWhen Concorde returned to service in 2001 after its Paris crash, it simply failed to convince enough people to fly.\n\nFast is past\n\nFor British Airways, the scrapping of Concorde means some £84m in write-off costs, not a major financial blow, even in these uncertain times.\n\nThe way ahead?\n\nBut the implications for the wider aviation industry are far more profound.\n\nConcorde may prove to be not only the world's only supersonic commercial aircraft, but also its last.\n\nOver the past couple of years, a host of supersonic projects have foundered.\n\nBoeing pulled the plug on its Sonic Cruiser project in December; a prototype from Japan's National Aeronautics Laboratory failed in a test flight last July; a $20bn French project to develop a mach-2 jet seems to have been mothballed.\n\nThe most ambitious project, an orbiting aircraft on the drawing board at Nasa, may be throttled by the agency's current Space Shuttle worries.\n\nA different sort of super\n\nAerospace fashion swings aside, it's not hard to see why.\n\nEngineering difficulties, still unresolved despite Concorde, make developing a viable supersonic passenger jet a $30bn-plus dream.\n\nNow, airlines are switching their focus from supersonic to so-called super-efficient aircraft - planes capable of carrying passengers as cheaply, not as quickly, as possible.\n\nAirbus' A380 super-jumbo, a whopping aircraft that seems to be selling tolerably well, is the first of this breed; Boeing is developing a smaller super-efficient model that will look something like its current 767.\n\nAs for the last Concordes, those former symbols of the white heat of European technology, British Airways plans to donate them to museums."
