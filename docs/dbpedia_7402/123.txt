For this quiz, we've only gone out and rounded up 33 movies from the '40s right up to today, and all you've got do is tell us the name of the movie.

It's really that simple. Before you go charging in, however, do check your spelling before you hit submit as misspellings are counted as incorrect answers.

As always, no checking Google, no checking Wikipedia, and no reverse-image searching for any of the answers.

If you get all 33 right, consider yourself very smart altogether and enjoy our muted respect for doing that well in this.

Good luck!
