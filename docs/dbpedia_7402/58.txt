Click the far-left pop-up menu, then choose or add search criteria.

For example, to search for only a certain type of item instead of all items, choose Kind. Or to search for any item whose name contains a particular word or phrase, choose Name.

To add criteria, choose Other, then select each attribute you want to add. For example, to search copyright information, select Copyright in the list of attributes, then click OK.

To search using Boolean operators (OR, AND, or NOT), press and hold the Option key, then click the button that appears.

You can set criteria and specify that Any, All, or None of them must be met.

To show metadata for a file, select the file, then choose File > Get Info.

kind:images created:8/16/23 searches for images created on a specific date.

kind:music by:“glenn miller” searches for music by Glenn Miller.
