And TITLE.movie is really expensive after the first year. I was thinking TITLEthemovie.com as a potential or TITLE-movie.com.\n\nWhat options do you think are best for a movie title domain. FYI it's a one word title with many extensions (except .movie).\n\nFor a one word title, adding the \"The\" may be a simple and effective solution. After all, there are likely books or other entities associated with that one word. \"XtheMovie or TheXMovie distinguishes itself from other venues.\n\nThe hyphen may be effective, but that probably would be something worth sorting out with customer research polling, along with the other choices.\n\nStarting out, though, don't be afraid of .net or some other less exciting extension. If you hit the big screen, the big bucks would likely then be there to buy the most desirable choices.\n\nGood luck with that screenplay. Sounds exciting!\n\n;\n\nIMO - TITLEthemovie.com.\n\nIt's descriptive to what it is and always will be - TITLEthemovie. Also there is no need to change it if it makes the 'big screen and big bucks', because movies have a shelve life and thus would be a waste of money to spend on another domain, which is why studios don't go out and spend big money for a exact match to their movie titles.\n\nImpact\n\n7,494\n\nYou understand the importance of a name or just doing it as a hobby as if end user it should be clear you get what you pay for.\n\ntopdom\n\nTop Member\n\nImpact\n\n2,416\n\nIsn't film better than movie already. Movie is very American. FIlm is European and global. Just like store v.s. shop.\n\nMile v.s. kilometer, inch v.s.centimeter. fahrenheit versus celcius, pound versus kilogram.\n\nWhich one do you think is the correct one:\n\nCannes Movie Festival\n\nCannes Film Festival\n\nAtlanta Movie Festival\n\nAtlanta Film Festival\n\nSundance Movie Festival\n\nSundance FIlm Festival\n\nBut in plural case movie might work better than film (movies v.s.films). In singular case film is better imo.\n\nVideo and Film would be good for brandables, Movies would be good for descriptive ones.\n\nLast edited: Oct 5, 2022\n\ntopdom\n\nTop Member\n\nImpact\n\n2,416\n\nIs it just one movie. Then , thetitlemovie.com, or titlemovie.net can be good choices. titlethemovie, is too bad.\n\nMovie title makes sense, title movie doesn't make much sense, unless title is the name of the movie.\n\ntitlethemovie makes sense only, if you are adding titles to movies.\n\nLast edited: Oct 5, 2022\n\nReddstagg\n\nThe-Billionaire.com Top Member\n\nImpact\n\n3,677\n\nGood morning.\n\nFirstly, congratulations on your endeavour. I once wrote a book and it is much more difficult a task than most people realize.\n\nThe following information is correct to the best of my knowledge but before proceeding please seek and pay for professional copyright advice before proceeding.\n\nThe title of a book cannot be copyrighted which is why there may be several different books with the same title. This is a little known fact but it opens up the realms of possibility.\n\nWith regard to movie titles the same may also be true but may only be true of movies which use the title of a book as the title of the movie. I'm fairly certain that over the years I have seen more than one movie with the same title so it may be beneficial to check it out before proceeding further.\n\nI wish you luck with you plans.\n\nRgrds,\n\nReddstagg\n\nRecons.Com\n\nTop Member\n\nImpact\n\n21,044\n\nMovies don't really need great names, imo.

What I was trying to allude to was substituting \"Title\" with \"Doggy,\" purely as an example (and dog lover). It could just as well be \"MyTitle.com or \"MyTitleMovie.com\"\n\nI understood as much. Most movies, though, do choose names that would be quite pricy for an exact match or even The+, My+ combo. Avatar, Matrix etc.\n\nEven for 2022, here are some movies: Scream, Fresh, X, Pearl, The Lost City, Coda, The Northman, Hustle, Nope, Vengeance, Smile, Bros etc.\n\nAs you can see, they are not any worse than Doggy... Just as entrepreneurs, the movie producers are lazy in branding and will go for short, snappy name that they can't really truly own with few rare exceptions (like Matrix having stronger association to the movie than to anything else).\n\nLast edited: Oct 6, 2022\n\nHotKey\n\nMade in Canada Top Member\n\nImpact\n\n12,743\n\nA couple of suggestions, and keeping to Recons valid short shelf-life assertion: you could add a hyphen between the keywords (name-movie.com), or use another relevant extension like dot-stream, if this is something that might be placed on a streaming platform.\n\nLoveCatchyDomains\n\nDaring to Live Top Member\n\nImpact\n\n3,414\n\nA couple of suggestions, and keeping to Recons valid short shelf-life assertion: you could add a hyphen between the keywords (name-movie.com), or use another relevant extension like dot-stream, if this is something that might be placed on a streaming platform.\n\nThe permutations are endless.

Trademark? Someone already planning something that can impact your marketing?\n\nConsider a different title, one that also has all the social media handles available\n\nLast edited: Oct 12, 2022\n\nImpact\n\n9,540\n\nThere are movies that got made only because the screenplay had a great title.
