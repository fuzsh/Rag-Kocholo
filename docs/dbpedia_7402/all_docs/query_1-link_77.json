        "text": "Stylistic Convention (written and spoken)\n\nIn English, the names of creators of a creative work (painting, drawing, movie, sculpture, cartoon, piece of music, song, etc., etc.) can be placed in front of the work to mean: the creative work created by that person.\n\nBeethoven symphony means: a symphony composed by Beethoven\n\nPicasso painting means: a painting painted by Picasso\n\nMiller play: a play written by (Arthur) Miller\n\nGiacometti sculpture: a sculpture sculpted by Giacometti\n\nHitchcock movie: a movie directed by Hitchcock\n\nMies building: a building designed by Mies (van der Rohe)\n\nThis is just usage. There is no grammatical explanation for it, really. I call this a stylistic convention: using a creator's name (proper noun) in front of the work to mean: the work created by a particular creator. Of course, you can use grammatical terms to describe it but it will not help you understand how to use it. (By that I mean: it will not help you understand that a Hitchcock movie is a movie directed by Hitchcock.)\n\nIf you were comparing two directors, you could say or write this one of two ways:\n\n- The [this, that] Cameron movie is better than the [this, that] Hitchcock movie.\n\nOr:\n\n- Cameron's movie is better than Hitchcock's movie.\n\nIn critics' language, in written form, the name + noun form usually prevails, unless there is some specific reason for using the possessive, for clarity's sake, for example.\n\nIn the case of Cameron's movie, it is not really that it belongs to him, as if this were a weird possessive case, unless copyright to it is being discussed,for example.\n\nThe meaning of the possessive in these cases is : a movie directed by Cameron (likewise with other verbs for other creations: painted by, written by, composed by etc.) So the possessive is really used to mean: by. A Picasso painting is a painting [painted] by Picasso. And not \"of\"."
