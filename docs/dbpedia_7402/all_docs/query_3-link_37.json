For example, a user could type “Imagine brother takes the throne illegally, Hollywood, in recent years,” and Movieuncover would recognize this is likely about royal family battles over power.\n\nHow to use it:\n\n1. Visit movieuncover.com.\n\n2. In the text box, type in a description of the movie or series you’re thinking of. Be as detailed or as vague as you like.\n\n3. The AI analyzes your description, identifies the underlying theme, and presents you with a selection of titles that match your criteria."
