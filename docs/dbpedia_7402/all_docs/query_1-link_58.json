        "text": "Old Hollywood can be a great source of inspiration for baby names. If you associate a particular movie with cherished childhood memories, naming your child after a character or actor from the film could be a sweet way to remember them. Maybe you always watched It’s a Wonderful Life during the holidays or sang tunes from The Sound of Music with your grandparents. Maybe you grew to love a film or star on your own. Perhaps, you just love the elegance of names from the golden age of cinema.\n\nWhatever your reason, classic movies have many baby name options to choose from. Between the many glamorous stars and the memorable characters they play, the options are nearly endless. Read on for a few of our favorites.\n\nClassic Movie Baby Names for Girls\n\nAnita\n\nOrigin: Spanish | Meaning: Grace\n\nFans of West Side Story could take inspiration from the character of Anita. The character was played flawlessly by Rita Moreno in the 1961 version of the film and by Ariana DeBose in the 2021 remake.\n\nAudrey\n\nOrigin: British | Meaning: Noble Strength\n\nYou can’t get more classic than Audrey Hepburn, star of Roman Holiday, My Fair Lady, and Breakfast at Tiffany’s, among several others.\n\nAva\n\nOrigin: Latin | Meaning: Bird\n\nAva is brought to our list thanks to the legendary starlet Ava Gardner. Gardner starred in Show Boat, The Barefoot Contessa, and many other hit films.\n\nBette\n\nOrigin: Hebrew | Meaning: God’s Promise\n\nOne of the main reasons to look to Old Hollywood for baby name inspiration is all of the classic names. One of our favorites is this uncommon option inspired by actress Bette Davis.\n\nClaudette\n\nOrigin: French | Meaning: Enclosure\n\nAn old-fashioned name to be sure, Claudette Colbert is known for staring in some stunning roles, such as Cleopatra and It Happened One Night.\n\nDebbie\n\nOrigin: Hebrew | Meaning: Bee\n\nMoms who were once ’90s babies may know her more as Marnie Piper’s witchy grandma in Halloweentown, but Debbie Reynolds has been gracing our televisions much longer. One of the most well known films from her early days (and one of our favorites) will leave you singin’ in the rain.\n\nDorothy\n\nOrigin: English, Greek | Meaning: Gift of God\n\nDorothy pays homage to the adventurous, pure-hearted hero of The Wizard of Oz. This movie somehow still feels magical and relevant despite being more than 80 years old.\n\nEliza\n\nOrigin: Hebrew | Meaning: God is Satisfaction, Joyful\n\nEliza from the 1964 film My Fair Lady was a charming character. This “joyful” name is the shortened form of Elizabeth.\n\nEsther\n\nOrigin: Persian | Meaning: Star\n\nEsther appears in the Old Testament and means “star.” It was also the name of the character played by Judy Garland in the 1944 Christmas musical Meet Me in St. Louis.\n\nGeorgine\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: Farmer\n\nMore known for her dance moves but also some notable film roles—like that of “Miss Torso” in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1954 film Rear Window—is Georgine Darcy. We love this unique spin on the more common Georgina and the feminine version of George.\n\nGilda\n\nOrigin: Filipino, English | Meaning: Golden\n\nBrought to our list by a love triangle for the ages, Gilda was played by the incomparable Rita Hayworth. It would be tough to find a name more perfect to honor the “golden” age of Hollywood than this one.\n\nGlinda\n\nOrigin: Welsh | Meaning: Fair\n\nImagine a child’s delight when she learns that the glittering “good witch” from The Wizard of Oz shares her name.\n\nGrace\n\nOrigin: Latin | Meaning: Favor\n\nGrace Kelly epitomized old glamour, starring in a number of Hitchock films and other mid-century hits.\n\nHolly\n\nOrigin: British | Meaning: The Holly Tree\n\nThis sweet name with a nod to Christmas is brought to our list by the complicated but iconic character, Holly Golightly, played by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany’s.\n\nIlsa\n\nOrigin: German, Spanish, Dutch | Meaning: God’s Promise\n\nIlsa is inspired by the tragic heroine of the 1942 film Casablanca, often referred to as one of the greatest romance movies ever made.\n\nKatharine/Katherine\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: Pure\n\nAs far as timeless names go, Katharine truly never goes out of style. This inclusion is brought to us by another well-known Hepburn who starred in The Philadelphia Story, Katharine Hepburn.\n\nLana\n\nOrigin: Slavic | Meaning: Shining, Light, Blessed\n\nA list of baby names inspired by classic movies would be incomplete without The Postman Always Rings Twice actress, Lana Turner. Not to mention, her character’s title, Cora, also makes for great baby name consideration.\n\nLeia\n\nOrigin: Hebrew, Greek, Hindi, Hawaiian | Meaning: Heavenly Flowers\n\nWith her commanding confidence, Princess Leia from Star Wars makes a very cool namesake for a modern girl.\n\nLena\n\nOrigin: British, Hebrew, Norwegian | Meaning: Torch, Ray of Light, Tower\n\nLena is historically used as a nickname for many different names, including Helen, Alina, and Magdalena. It’s also one of the characters from the seminal play and 1961 film, A Raisin in the Sun.\n\nLorelei\n\nOrigin: German | Meaning: Enchantress\n\nThis unique name is inspired by Marilyn Monroe’s character, Lorelei Lee, from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\n\nLucille\n\nOrigin: French | Meaning: Light\n\nWhile most well known for her work on her television series, I Love Lucy, Lucille Ball also graced the big screen more than once.\n\nMae\n\nOrigin: British | Meaning: Mae\n\nMore commonly seen as a middle name option, this short but sweet title is brought to our list by leading lady Mae West.\n\nMaria\n\nOrigin: Latin | Meaning: Star of the Sea, Beloved\n\nMaria, which has long been one of the most popular names in Latin America, pays homage to two beloved classics: The Sound of Music and West Side Story.\n\nSabrina\n\nOrigin: Welsh, Arabic | Meaning: Patience\n\nThis lovely name references the 1954 film, Sabrina, starring Audrey Hepburn. (However, no one has to know if you’re low-key more familiar with the ’90s sitcom Sabrina The Teenage Witch.)\n\nTiffany\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: Manifestation of God\n\nWhether you prefer being inspired by classic movies or a staple in the jewelry game, Tiffany is a must to consider. This name is, of course, brought to our list by one of Audrey Hepburn’s many shining roles as Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany’s.\n\nVivien\n\nOrigin: Latin, French | Meaning: Lively\n\nThe name Vivien, which means “lively,” is shared by British actress Vivien Leigh. She’s known for her roles in Gone with the Wind and A Streetcar Named Desire.\n\nZuzu\n\nOrigin: Czech, Yiddish | Meaning: Lily, Sweet\n\nThere’s something fun and unexpected about names that start with “Z,” and Zuzu Bailey, a character in the 1946 Christmas classic It’s a Wonderful Life, is no exception.\n\nClassic Movie Baby Names for Boys\n\nAlfred\n\nOrigin: British | Meaning: Elf\n\nThe brains behind many of our of favorite Golden Age films is Alfred Hitchcock. A little one with this historical name is sure to make a name for himself, too.\n\nBernardo\n\nOrigin: Portuguese | Meaning: Strong as a Bear\n\nThe name of the smooth leader of the Sharks in West Side Story, Bernardo, means “strong as a bear.” (If nothing else, it’d be a fun excuse for a teddy-bear-themed nursery).\n\nClark\n\nOrigin: English | Meaning: Scribe, Clerk\n\nThe name Clark may bring to mind “The King of Hollywood,” Clark Gable. And, for fans of The Postal Service, the song is named after the actor.\n\nCooper\n\nOrigin: English | Meaning: Barrel Maker\n\nGary Cooper is a two-time Best Actor Oscar winner and his occupational surname meaning “barrel maker” is an adorable choice for your very own award-winning guy.\n\nDon\n\nOrigin: English, Irish | Meaning: Chief, Noble\n\nDon, the name of one of the characters in the delightful 1952 musical Singin’ in the Rain, means “chief” or “noble.”\n\nFord\n\nOrigin: Old English | Meaning: Shallow Body of Water\n\nFor an unexpected choice, you could name your child Ford, inspired by Francis Ford Coppola’s Godfather trilogy, as well as Harrison Ford of Indiana Jones and Star Wars fame.\n\nFred\n\nOrigin: German | Meaning: Peace\n\nThis name is shared by Fred Astaire, widely considered one of the greatest American dancers in history.\n\nGeorge\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: Farmer, Earth Worker\n\nGeorge Bailey, the endearing, self-sacrificing protagonist of the holiday tearjerker, It’s a Wonderful Life, would make a meaningful namesake.\n\nIrving\n\nOrigin: Scottish | Meaning: Green River\n\nNominated for Best Supporting Actor once upon a time was Eddie Albert for his role as the photographer, Irving Radovich, in Roman Holiday. Though old-school, the name is as classic as it is noble.\n\nLuke\n\nOrigin: English, Latin, Greek | Meaning: Light-giving\n\nWhile Luke is a very old, Biblical name, it’s now inextricable from the humble hero of the original Star Wars trilogy, Luke Skywalker.\n\nSamuel/Sammy\n\nOrigin: Hebrew | Meaning: God has Heard\n\nSamuel “Sammy” Davis Jr. was groundbreaking as a Black performer at a time when Hollywood was still highly segregated. The inspiring namesake started his career in vaudeville at the age of three—not to put any performing pressure on your little guy!\n\nStewart\n\nOrigin: English, Scottish, Gaelic | Meaning: Steward\n\nInspired by actor Jimmy Stewart, a little one with this title is sure to be a star, as his namesake was in several of the most well-known classic Hollywood movies. A few of our favorites are It’s a Wonderful Life and Rear Window, just to name a few.\n\nTurner\n\nOrigin: English, Old French | Meaning: Lathe\n\nHollywood starlet Lana Turner played some incomparable roles, like Lora Meredith in Imitation of Life and Cora Smith in The Postman Always Rings Twice. We love this surname turned first name that’s perfect for a little boy.\n\nVictor\n\nOrigin: Latin | Meaning: Winner, Conqueror\n\nThe name of one of the love interests in Casablanca, Victor, means “winner” or “conqueror.”\n\nWalter\n\nOrigins: German | Meaning: Commander of the Army\n\nCary Grant made a name for himself with each and every role he took on. A favorite may be the male protagonist in His Girl Friday, Walter Burns.\n\nGender-Neutral Baby Names Inspired by Classic Films\n\nCary\n\nOrigin: Welsh | Meaning: Pure\n\nBefore we all associated the name “Carrie” with Sex and the City or the ’70s horror film, it was famously the name of actor Cary Grant. He starred in many movies, including four Hitchcock films. (Fun fact, his original name was Archibald!)\n\nGene/Eugene\n\nOrigin: Greek | Meaning: Wellborn, Noble\n\nFans of Singin’ in the Rain and the 1915 film, An American in Paris, might associate the name Gene—a nickname for Eugene—with classic Hollywood star Gene Kelly.\n\nHudson\n\nOrigin: English | Meaning: Son of Hudd\n\nA prominent member of the Golden Age of Hollywood is none other than Rock Hudson. We love this out-of-the-box baby name for either a little boy or girl.\n\nKelly\n\nOrigin: Irish | Meaning: War\n\nSpeaking of Gene Kelly, there is also great baby name potential from his surname as well.\n\nMonroe\n\nOrigin: Scottish and Irish Gaelic | Meaning: Mouth of the River Roe\n\nWhile Marilyn Monroe epitomized the mid-century starlet, her last name on its own is growing in popularity as an unexpected and sophisticated name for a boy or girl.\n\nNorth\n\nOrigin: Middle English | Meaning: Northern\n\nWe may have Kim Kardashian and Kanye West to thank for putting this baby name on the map. But in this case, we were inspired to include this unique baby name because of the 1959 thriller, North by Northwest.\n\nRobin\n\nOrigin: English | Meaning: Bright, Shining, Famous"
