        "text": "Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey have been making it work since 2003 — in more ways than one.\n\nThe pair first got together when Robert was starring in Gothika alongside Halle Berry. Susan (then Susan Levin) was producing the film through her job with Silver Pictures.\n\nAt first, Susan wasn't too sure about Robert, in part because she didn't want to date the star of one of the movies she was working on, but also because — as she told The Hollywood Reporter in 2014 — she found him \"interesting but weird.\"\n\nBut soon enough, the producer agreed to a date with the actor, and things took off from there. Within a few months, the pair were engaged and two years later, they said, 'I do.'\n\nNow, Robert and Susan share two children and have formed their own production company, Team Downey.\n\nFrom their first meeting to their success as parents and business partners, here is a complete timeline of Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey's relationship.\n\n2003: Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey meet\n\nSusan and Robert met while he was starring in the 2003 psychological thriller Gothika alongside Berry and Penélope Cruz, which Susan was producing.\n\n\"We were up in Montreal prepping for Gothika, and we had lunch with the director and Halle Berry,\" Susan told The Hollywood Reporter of getting to know Robert. \"Everybody else ordered Japanese, but Robert told us how oatmeal was the 'superfood.' He brought his own packets of oatmeal to have at lunch. And he had this box of various herbs and stuff. And then he started doing these yoga moves. I mean, he was interesting but weird.\"\n\nOctober 9, 2003: Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey make their red carpet debut\n\nIn October 2003, Robert brought Susan as his date to the premiere of The Singing Detective, a musical that Robert starred in with Katie Holmes, Robin Wright and Adrien Brody. The event marked their first public appearance together.\n\nNovember 5, 2003: Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey get engaged\n\nA month later, Robert asked Susan to marry him. In 2004, the couple shared the story of their engagement during an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show.\n\n\"It was her birthday and I wanted to get her before she turned 30, so I waited right before midnight, and I got her a bunch of stuff and then there was a ring,\" Robert told Winfrey. \"And she opened that, and I said … What did I say?\"\n\nSusan answered, \"'I was wondering if, maybe, you'd wanna, like, be my wife one day.' \"\n\nAccording to a 2014 Hollywood Reporter interview, while the proposal happened only months after they started dating, Susan insisted on a longer engagement.\n\nAugust 27, 2005: Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey get married\n\nOn Aug. 27, 2005, nearly two years after getting engaged, Susan and Robert tied the knot. As reported by PEOPLE, the pair got married on Long Island, New York and celebrity guests included Sting, Keanu Reeves and Billy Joel. A source told PEOPLE that Robert was nervous before the ceremony, so he blew off steam earlier in the day by doing a 30-minute kung fu session and going for a swim with his son, Indio (from his first marriage to Deborah Falconer).\n\n2008: Susan Downey gets Robert Downey Jr. cast in a major role\n\nSusan is responsible for Robert taking on one of his biggest roles: Sherlock Holmes. In 2008, Susan was producing Guy Ritchie's movie RocknRolla around the same time that Ritchie was hired to direct Sherlock Holmes.\n\n\"If Susan hadn't been in the room, Robert probably wouldn't have become Sherlock Holmes. She facilitated it, definitely,\" Ritchie told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nSusan also produced the film as well as its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.\n\n\"It's much better to spend four months together than four months apart, and she's a great producer,\" Robert told PEOPLE of the experience.\n\nJanuary 17, 2010: Robert Downey Jr. mentions Susan Downey in his Golden Globes speech\n\nIn 2010, Robert won the Golden Globe for best actor for Sherlock Holmes. During his acceptance speech, he jokingly shared that Susan had encouraged him not to prepare his speech ahead of time.\n\n\"I would like to thank Susan Downey for telling me that Matt Damon was going to win, so don't bother to prepare a speech,\" he said on stage. He then sarcastically talked about who he didn't want to thank: \"I really don't want to thank my wife, because I could be bussing tables at the Daily Grill right now, if not for her.\"\n\nSusan said afterward, \"I know he didn't have [a speech] fully prepared, but he is really good off the cuff, and he actually tends to do better when he doesn't plan things.\"\n\nJune 2010: Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey start Team Downey\n\nLater that year, the couple founded their own production company, Team Downey.\n\n\"We played with other names, like RoSuDo,\" Susan told THR. \"But everyone was like, 'What the heck's that?' If you have to explain that it means Robert Susan Downey, then it's not going to work.\"\n\nYears later, in 2020, the company signed a first-look, one-year deal with premium cable channel HBO.\n\n\"We're excited to roll up our sleeves, expand the partnership, and tell stories that meet the standard their brand has come to represent,\" the couple said in a joint statement to THR.\n\nAugust 31, 2011: Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey announce they're expecting a baby\n\nIn August 2011, Robert's rep confirmed to PEOPLE that he and Susan were expecting their first child together.\n\n\"Robert and Susan could not be more excited over this news,\" his rep said. \"They can't wait to welcome this new baby into their wonderful family.\"\n\nThe actor had previously predicted that he would have another child soon. \"I think I will be wrist-deep in doo-doo within 18 months. I'm calling it right here,\" he said in 2010.\n\nFebruary 7, 2012: Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey welcome their son\n\nThe couple welcomed their son, Exton Elias Downey, on Feb. 7, 2012, as the actor's rep confirmed to PEOPLE. A friend of the pair said, \"Everyone is healthy and they couldn't be happier.\"\n\nPrior to his birth, Robert had revealed the baby's sex publicly, even though it wasn't planned.\n\n\"I could never really stay mad at him, but I can tell you it genuinely wasn't something we planned to reveal,\" Susan said. \"If I told you the name, then she would lop off my head with a machete,\" added Robert.\n\nJuly 9, 2014: Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey have another baby on the way\n\nIn July 2014, Robert announced that he and Susan were expecting their second child on Twitter. \"Yo. Susan. Me. Baby. Girl. November. Scorpio?\" he wrote. The news was then confirmed by PEOPLE.\n\nThat November, Robert was honored with the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film at the BAFTA Awards and during his acceptance speech, he made a joke about the pregnancy.\n\n\"The second pregnancy has been extraordinarily tough for me. Self-prescribed mandatory bed rest was of some benefit. At least my milk is finally coming in,\" he said.\n\nOctober 10, 2014: Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey release their first movie together\n\nTeam Downey produced and released its first film, the legal drama The Judge, in October 2014. In it, Robert starred as a lawyer who returns to his hometown and confronts a strained relationship with his father, played by Robert Duvall.\n\n\"Whether you're working together all of the time or not, you always have to give each other space and kind of read it,\" Susan told PEOPLE in 2014. Of working with her husband, she said, \"He's a little bit of a slower start in the morning than I am, so I have to make sure that there's enough coffee in his system before I start throwing questions his way.\"\n\nNovember 4, 2014: Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey welcome their daughter\n\nSusan and Robert welcomed their daughter, Avri Roel Downey, on Nov. 4, 2014. The Iron Man star announced the news in a humorous Facebook post.\n\n\"After 9 months of intensive development, Team Downey is pleased to announce our 2014 fall/winter project,\" he wrote. \"Principal photography commenced 11-14 and will continue until she says, 'Dad! You are embarrassing me … I'm 30, this has gotta stop.' \"\n\nHe continued, \"Yep … Avri Roel Downey joined the party @ 3:22 a.m. on November 4th … she's 7lbs even, spans 20 inches, and is accompanied by a variety of Susan's traits that have seemingly overwritten my 'junk DNA.' \"\n\nAugust 27, 2015: Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey celebrate their 10th anniversary\n\nThe couple celebrated 10 years of marriage in 2015. Robert posted about the milestone on his Instagram account.\n\n\"A perfect 10. Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Downey,\" he wrote next to a photo of them standing on a beach wearing black shirts and sunglasses.\n\nJanuary 17, 2020: Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey's Dolittle premieres\n\nRobert and Susan worked together again on the Team Downey production Dolittle, which premiered in January 2020. Robert played the title character, Dr. Dolittle, a man who can speak to animals.\n\n\"It was fun to pick something that our kids could see,\" Susan told Extra during a joint interview with her husband. \"Because even though he's let our son see the Marvel movies — certain ones — they weren't able to see any of the movies that we've worked on.\"\n\n\"We don't like going too long without having an extremely difficult project together, whether it's a movie or a kid,\" Robert said, to which Susan quipped, \"Or a house.\"\n\nJune 4, 2021: Susan Downey and Robert Downey Jr. release Sweet Tooth\n\nTeam Downey made its Netflix debut with the show Sweet Tooth, which is about a boy who is half-human, half-deer and lives in a world where human-animal hybrid children started being born following a pandemic.\n\nAs with Dolittle, the couple were glad that they got to share Sweet Tooth with their children. \"I just hope people have the experience that we get to have with our kids, where we cuddle up on the couch and all watch it together,\" Susan said in a feature for Netflix.\n\nNovember 6, 2021: Robert Downey Jr. celebrates Susan Downey's birthday\n\nIn November 2021, Robert shared a sweet Instagram post for his wife's birthday, which included an important vow.\n\n\"Adjusting the halo on my heaven sent partner Mrs D ... you are my everything, and November 6th, Always a day of gratitude, for your blessed birth,\" he wrote next to a photo of him placing an invincible halo on Susan's head. He continued, \"P.S. I will never watch ahead on a co-viewed streaming show … That is my eternal vow … \"\n\nApril 4, 2023: Robert Downey Jr. calls marriage to Susan Downey \"sublime\"\n\nOn his 58th birthday, Robert took a moment to look back at the past 365 days and note what he's grateful for. The Iron Man star posted a video on Instagram filled with memories — photos and video clips of time spent with family and friends.\n\n\"The sweet 17 of marriage — sublime!\" he captioned a photo with Susan, referring to the couple's wedding anniversary in August.\n\nFebruary 24, 2024: Robert Downey Jr. thanks Susan Downey in SAG Awards acceptance speech\n\nRobert won outstanding performance by a male actor in a supporting role at the 2024 Screen Actors Guild Awards. During his acceptance speech, the Oppenheimer star gave Susan a memorable shout-out.\n\n\"For 22 years, she has flawlessly portrayed a sane and rational individual who is happily married to an actor,\" Downey quipped, before dedicating the award to the couple's first child. \"Exton Elias this one's for you,\" he added.\n\nMarch 10, 2024: Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey share a sweet moment at the Oscars\n\nSusan accompanied Robert to the 2024 Oscars, where he won Best Supporting Actor for his role in Oppenheimer.\n\nWhile talking to PEOPLE later that evening, the actor revealed the \"best part of the night,\" a sweet moment he shared with his wife.\n\n\"There was a commercial break and we just touched heads, like two dinosaurs that were letting each other know that we were a couple. And it was great,\" Robert said.\n\nApril 8, 2024: Susan Downey says she would \"never be who I am\" without Robert Downey Jr.\n\nSusan sung her husband's praises while talking to Esquire for the magazine's spring 2024 issue.\n\n“Everybody loves the simple narrative of somehow I came in and turned his life around and blah, blah, blah. But I can tell you that I would never be who I am without him in my life,\" she said. \"His trajectory is just the easier one to chart because he’s had to live his ups and downs in public. When we met, we were fortunate that he was in a place where he was open to do things differently than he had historically. But you know what? So was I.”\n\nRobert also talked about their marriage, admitting that he still catches himself studying Susan \"as though I'm a private investigator.\"\n\n“It’s beyond us being two humans who cohabitate and have built a life together. There’s something about her that remains almost entirely a mystery,\" he said."
