        "text": "A summary of this guidance is presented on the page about the basic principles of reference list entries. Additional information and examples are available in Chapters 9 and 10 of the Publication Manual.\n\nIf a work does not have an author, date, title, or source, visit the page on how to adjust reference list entries when reference information is missing.\n\nThe author refers broadly to the person(s) or group(s) responsible for a work. An author may be\n\nan individual,\n\nmultiple people,\n\na group (institution, government agency, organization, etc.), or\n\na combination of people and groups.\n\nThis element includes not only authors of articles, books, reports, and other works but also others who played primary roles in the creation of a work, such as editors of books, directors of films, principal investigators of grants, podcast hosts, and so on.\n\nWhen you cannot determine who the author is, treat the work as having no author.\n\nThe date refers to the date of publication of the work. The date will take one of the following forms:\n\nyear only;\n\nyear, month, and day (i.e., an exact date);\n\nyear and month;\n\nyear and season; or\n\nrange of dates (e.g., range of years, range of exact dates).\n\nWhen you cannot determine the date of publication, treat the work as having no date.\n\nIf a date of last update is available (such as for a webpage), use it in the reference. Do not include a date of last review in a reference because content that has been reviewed has not necessarily been changed.\n\nRetrieval dates\n\n‚Å†\n\nInclude a retrieval date only if the work is unarchived and designed to change over time. Most references do not include retrieval dates. Examples of some that do are in Chapter 10 of the Publication Manual and on the reference examples page.\n\nWhen a retrieval date is needed, use the following format for it.\n\nThe title refers to the title of the work being cited. Titles fall into two broad categories:\n\nworks that stand alone (e.g., whole books, reports, gray literature, dissertations and theses, informally published works, data sets, videos, films, TV series, albums, podcasts, social media, and works on websites) and\n\nworks that are part of a greater whole (e.g., periodical articles, edited book chapters, TV and podcast episodes, and songs).\n\nWhen a work stands alone (e.g., a report), the title of that work appears in the title element of the reference. When a work is part of a greater whole (e.g., a journal article or edited book chapter), the title of the article or chapter appears in the title element of the reference and the title of the greater whole (the journal or edited book) appears in the source element.\n\nWhen the title of the work cannot be determined, treat the work as having no title.\n\nThe source indicates where readers can retrieve the cited work. As with titles, sources fall into two broad categories: works that are part of a greater whole and works that stand alone.\n\nThe source for a work that is part of a greater whole (e.g., journal article, edited book chapter) is that greater whole (i.e., the journal or edited book), plus any applicable DOI or URL.\n\nThe source for a work that stands alone (e.g., whole book, report, dissertation, thesis, film, TV series, podcast, data set, informally published work, social media, webpage) is the publisher of the work, database or archive, social media site, or website, plus any applicable DOI or URL.\n\nA location is not required in the source element for most works (e.g., do not include the publisher location for book references).\n\nWorks associated with a specific location (e.g., artwork in a museum, conference presentations) include location information in the source and, depending on the work, may also include a DOI or URL.\n\nIf a work is not recoverable, treat it as having no source.\n\nDatabase information in the source\n\nDatabase and archive information is seldom needed in reference list entries. For example, if you retrieved a work from an academic research database, the reference very rarely includes the name of the database or the URL of the work on the database.\n\nVisit the page on database information in references to learn when and how to include database information in references.\n\nVisit the page on DOIs or URLs to learn how to include DOIs and URLs in references."
