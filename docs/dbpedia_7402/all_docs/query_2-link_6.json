        "text": "Another case, hopefully not one of many (because that would kind of make the question a list request): Jean-Luc Godard's Goodbye To Language from 2014. From IMDb's trivia section:\n\nThe film's title never appears on screen. The end credits just list peoples' names, without any indication of what work they contributed to the project.\n\nThen again, this is Godard, so it's not very surprising.\n\nEDIT: Sure enough, I just remembered yet another instance of this: Gregg Araki's Smiley Face (2007) with the hilarious Anna Faris. The title itself never appears in the opening or closing credits but is simply represented by an image of a huge yellow smiley just like this. :) [Source: I verified this myself.]\n\nThe 1996 film Schizopolis written and directed by Steven Soderbergh has no opening or closing credits.\n\nThe closest we get is the word \"SCHIZOPOLIS\" on the T-shirt of an otherwise naked man being chased by two other men (ostensibly medical personnel chasing down a crazy person). We also receive the onscreen words \"No fish were harmed in the making of this film\" apropos of nothing near the beginning of the film.\n\nAt the end of the film, the man's shirt reads \"THE END\" when he is caught and soon after there is a Blipvert style one-frame flash of the obligatory copyright notice. The blurry nature of the notice is due to trying to isolate the frame via VLC. This was the best of only two tries from the Criterion DVD and a crap video card.\n\nFor a while there were fun threats of a Son of Schizopolis sequel, but it looks like the window may have closed on that one."
