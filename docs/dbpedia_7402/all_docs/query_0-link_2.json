        "text": "\"Never Kill a Boy on the First Date\" is the fifth episode of the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer television show, and the fifth episode in the series. Written by Rob Des Hotel and Dean Batali, and directed by David Semel, it was originally broadcast on March 31, 1997, on The WB network.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nA CRANKY SLAYER IS A CARELESS SLAYER — Buffy tries to maintain some semblance of a normal teenage social life by opting for a hot date instead of helping Giles protect Sunnydale from a violent vampire prophecy. As she's blinded by love, Buffy ignores the signs of the dark forces aligning against her. Meanwhile, while Buffy's being romanced, The Master is plotting her demise by invoking the wrath of the \"Anointed One,\" a great warrior vampire who is The Master's most powerful weapon against the slayer.[1]\n\nSummary[]\n\nThe Master reads a prophecy from the Writings of Aurelius to his minions:\n\n\"And there will be a time of crisis, of worlds hanging in the balance. And in this time shall come the Anointed, the Master's great warrior. And the Slayer will not know him, will not stop him, and he will lead her into hell. As it is written, so it shall be. Five will die, and from their ashes, the Anointed One shall rise. The Brethren of Aurelius shall greet him and usher him to his immortal destiny.\"\n\nBuffy finally gets a date when sensitive hunk Owen shows an interest in her. To Giles's exasperation, all Buffy can think about is impressing him with an uncharacteristic interest in poetry. In the school cafeteria, Buffy has to fight off Cordelia to sit at one table with Owen, but it is worth it. He asks Buffy out on a date to the Bronze that very evening.\n\nHowever, Giles has found out about the prophecy from the symbol on a ring they found in the cemetery. He is convinced that the Anointed One will rise that night, and so, despite Buffy's protests, they spend hours sitting on graves waiting for a vampire to rise. None does, however, and though Giles is certain that his calculations are correct, he calls their fruitless stake-out quits. Buffy rushes to the Bronze, only to see Owen dancing with Cordelia. Crushed, she leaves without trying to talk to him.\n\nAt the same time, in a van on the way to Sunnydale, a young boy talks to a man, who stands up and begins to lecture the other passengers on God's judgment, quoting prophecies. Suddenly, a vampire walks in front of the van, causing it to crash. Another vampire swarms the wreck, attacking the passengers, including the religious man.\n\nThe next morning, Owen asks Buffy out on another date that night and even gives her a pocket watch so that she doesn't miss it this time. Buffy jumps at the opportunity while Xander stews in his jealousy.\n\nWhen evening comes, Giles shows up at Buffy's house, waving a newspaper that shows five people died when the van crashed, among them the suspected murderer Andrew Borba, the man who was quoting prophecies. Buffy insists on going to the Bronze, though, so Giles decides to check the Sunnydale Funeral Home himself. However, vampires also appear and go after him, and Giles traps himself in a room. Xander and Willow find him and run back to the Bronze to get Buffy.\n\nThere, first Cordelia, then Angel try to come in between Buffy and Owen. Finally, Xander and Willow convince her to come to the funeral home by subtly pretending to be a couple that wants to do something daring on a double date. When Buffy figures out what has happened, she tries to leave Owen, but he insists on tagging along and witnesses Borba rising as a vampire in the funeral home. In the ensuing fight, Borba knocks Owen unconscious. Buffy, angry that he has \"killed [her] date,\" kills Borba by sliding him into the burning furnace.\n\nThe next morning, Owen is extremely excited about what they've been through and wants more. This is what he likes about Buffy, he says, and almost being killed made him feel alive. Buffy realizes that there is no way that she can have a relationship with him; sooner or later, he will get himself killed. With a heavy heart, she breaks up with him.\n\nGiles comforts Buffy about her sacrifices by telling her what a burden it was for him as a ten-year-old to find out his destiny was to be a Watcher when he would rather have been a fighter pilot or possibly a grocer. Both agree that at least the Master will be unhappy too because the Anointed One was destroyed.\n\nIn his underground lair, the Master welcomes the real Anointed — the young boy from the van.\n\nContinuity[]\n\nAfter throwing a minion across the room, the Master says, \"Here endeth the lesson,\" which is later spoken by Spike (\"Fool for Love\") and Buffy (\"Showtime\").\n\nBuffy and the gang believe they have actually stopped the Anointed One, but they will learn otherwise in \"Prophecy Girl.\"\n\nGiles asserts that he doesn't have an instruction manual; there is a Slayer Handbook, but Giles decided not to use it with Buffy, as he reveals in \"What's My Line? Part Two.\"\n\nCordelia's line when she sees Angel, \"Hello, salty goodness!\", will be repeated when she reverts back to her teenage persona and first sees Angel in \"Spin the Bottle.\"\n\nGiles mentions his father and his grandmother were Watchers, which is later shown in Tales of the Vampires and Daddy Issues, Part One.\n\nGiles's interest in being a fighter pilot, disrupted by beginning his Watcher studies at the early age of ten, is shown through his great-aunt's memories in Women of a Certain Age.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nIndividuals[]\n\nAngel\n\nAndrew Borba\n\nAurelius (Only
