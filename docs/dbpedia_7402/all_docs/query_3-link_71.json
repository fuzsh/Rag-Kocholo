        "text": "Data blending is a method for combining data from multiple sources. Data blending brings in additional information from a secondary data source and displays it with data from the primary data source directly in the view.\n\nData blending is particularly useful when the blend relationshipâthe linking fieldsâneed to vary on a sheet-by-sheet basis, or when combining published data sources.\n\nOptions to combine data\n\nThere are several ways to combine data, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nRelationships are the default method and can be used in most instances, including across tables with different levels of detail. Relationships are flexible and adapt to the structure of the analysis on a sheet by sheet basis. However, you can't create relationships between tables from published data sources.\n\nJoins combine tables by adding more columns of data across similar row structures. This can cause data loss or duplication if tables are at different levels of detail, and joins must be established before analysis can begin. You can't use a published data source in a join.\n\nBlends, unlike relationships or joins, never combine the data directly. Instead, blends query each data source independently, aggregate the results to the appropriate level, then present the results together visually in the view. Because of this, blends can handle different levels of detail and also work with published data sources. Blends don't create a new, blended data source (and therefore can't be published as a \"blended data source\"). Instead, they are simply blended results visualized per sheet.\n\nUnderstand primary and secondary data sources\n\nData blending requires a primary data source and at least one secondary data source. The first data source used in the view becomes the primary data source and defines the view. This can restrict values from the secondary data sourceâonly values that have corresponding matches in the primary data source appear in the view. This is comparable to a left join.\n\nFor example, if the primary data source has a Month field that only contains April, May, and June, any view built around months will only display April, May, and June, even if the secondary data source has values for twelve months. If the desired analysis involves all twelve months, try switching which data source is primary by rebuilding the sheet and using the other data source first.\n\nWork across blended data sources\n\nDue to the nature of a data blend, there are some things to keep in mind when working across blended data sources.\n\nPerforming calculations with fields from more than one data source can be slightly different than an ordinary calculation. A calculation must be created in a single data source; the top of the calculation editor indicates which data source the calculation is in.\n\nAggregation. Any fields used from another data source will come in with an aggregationâby default, SUM, but this can be changed. Because calculations cannot mix aggregate and non-aggregate arguments, fields from the calculation's host data source must also be aggregated. (In the images below, the SUM aggregation was added automatically and the sum aggregation was added manually.)\n\nDot notation. Any field referenced in the calculation that belong to another data source refers to its data source using dot notation. (In the images below, for the calculation built in Sample - Superstore, the Sales Target field becomes [Sales.Targets].[Sales Target]. When the calculation is built in SalesÂ Targets, the Sales field becomes [Sample - Superstore].[Sales].)\n\nThese are equivalent versions of the same calculation built in each data source. In both cases, this is SUM(Sales) / SUM(Sales Target).\n\nIn addition to handling calculations slightly differently, there are some limitations on secondary data sources. You may not be able to sort by a field from a secondary data source, and action filters may not work as expected with blended data. For more information, see Other data blending issues.\n\nDefine blend relationships for blending\n\nIn order for Tableau to know how to combine the data from multiple sources, there must be a common dimension or dimensions between the data sources. This common dimension is called the linking field. Active linking fields are identified in the Data pane for the secondary data source with an active link icon ( ) and potential linking fields are identified with a broken link icon ( ). Linking fields are not indicated on the primary data source.\n\nFor example, in a blend of transactional and quota data, a geographic field might be the desired the linking field so you can analyze both quota and performance towards that quota for the same region.\n\nNote: In order for the blend to function, the linking fields must also share values or members. Tableau builds the view of blended data based on the shared values. For example, if Color is the linking field in both data sources, Tableau will match data on \"Purple\" from the primary and \"Purple\" from the secondary. But \"Lt. Blue\" will not map correctly to \"Light Blue\", so one of them would need to be realiased. Like renaming fields to help Tableau identify linking fields, you can edit aliases for members in those fields. For more information, see Create Aliases to Rename Members in the View.\n\nEstablish a link\n\nIf the linking field in the primary and secondary data sources have the same name, Tableau automatically creates the relationship. When a primary data source is established (that is, a field is in use in the view) and the secondary data source is selected in the Data pane, any fields with the same name between the two data sources will display a link icon ( or ) in the secondary data source. If the related field from the primary data source is used in the view, the link becomes active automatically.\n\nIf there are no link icons on the secondary data source, you may need to help Tableau establish the link in one of two ways:Â\n\nIf common dimensions donât have the same name (such as \"Title\" and \"Book Title\"), renaming one will let Tableau identify them as common dimensions and establish the link.\n\nAlternatively, you can manually define a relationship between the fields in the primary and secondary data sources. See below for more information on creating manual link relationship\n\nThere can be as many active or potential linking fields as necessary. Click the broken link icon ( ) in the data pane to make the relationship active.\n\nAs with relationships or joins, there are times when the links between the data sources are defined by more than one field. For example, if regional sales quotas are monthly, a blend between transactional sales data and quota data needs to be established on both region and month for the correct data to be brought together in the view. Multiple links can be active at the same time.\n\nDifferences between joins and data blending\n\nData blending simulates a traditional left join. The main difference between the two is when the aggregation is performed. A join combines the data and then aggregates. A blend aggregates and then combines the data.\n\nLeft join\n\nWhen you use a left join to combine data, a query is sent to the database where the join is performed. A left join returns all rows from the left table and any corresponding rows from the right table. The results of the join are then sent back to Tableau and aggregated for display in the visualization.\n\nA left join takes all rows from the left table. The common columns are User IDÂ and Patron ID; where there is corresponding information from the right table, that data is returned. Otherwise, there is a null.\n\nÂ\n\nSuppose you have the same tables, but flip the order. This new left join produces different results. Again, a left join takes all the data from the new left table, but essentially ignores a row from the right table. The row of data for User ID = 4Â is not included because there is no row for Patron ID = 4 in the left table.\n\nData blending\n\nWhen you use data blending to combine data, a query is sent to the database for each data source that is used on the sheet. The results of the queries are sent back to Tableau as aggregated data and presented together in the visualization.\n\nNote:Â Aggregating measures is straightforwardâwe can take the sum, average, maximum, or other aggregation of a number with ease. Measure values are aggregated based on how the field is aggregated in the view. However, all fields from a secondary data source must be aggregated. How does that work for dimensions?Â Dimension values are aggregated using the ATTR aggregate function, which returns a single value for all rows in the secondary data source. If there are multiple values contained in those rows, an asterisk (*) is shown. This can be interpreted as \"there are multiple values in the secondary data source for this mark in the view\".\n\nThe view uses all values from the primary data source (functioning as the left table) and the corresponding rows from the secondary data source (the right table) based on the linking field(s).\n\nSuppose you have the following tables. If the linking fields are User IDÂ and Patron ID, not all values can be a part of the resulting table because of the following:\n\nA row in the left table does not have a corresponding row match in the right table, as indicated by the null value in the results.\n\nThere are multiple corresponding values in the rows in the right table, as indicated by the asterisk (*) in the results.\n\nWhen measures are involved, they are also aggregated, as seen below:\n\nImportant: an asterisk (*) in a view with blended data indicates multiple values. This can be resolved by ensuring there is only one matching value in the secondary data source for each mark in the primary data source, potentially by swapping the primary and secondary data sources. For more information, see Troubleshoot Data Blending.\n\nData blending at a glance\n\nData blending occurs on a sheet-by sheet basis.\n\nThe order in which fields are used determines which data source is the primary versus the secondary data source.\n\nThe primary data source is indicated with a blue check mark, any secondary data sources and fields from secondary data sources have an orange check mark.\n\nLinking fields can be automatically determined based on shared field names or the blend relationship can be manually created.\n\nData blending behaves similarly to a left join, which may result in missing data from the secondary data source.\n\nAsterisks (*)Â may appear. This indicates multiple dimension values in a single mark, because data blending takes aggregated results and combines them in the view.\n\nA secondary data source can be used to re-alias the field values in a primary data source. For more information, see Alias Field Values Using Data Blending.\n\nData blending limitations"
