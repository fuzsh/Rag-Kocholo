        "text": "Adam Wingard’s MonsterVerse sequel, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, will be making its streaming debut on Max next month. If you want to watch the epic film from home, discover when Godzilla x Kong will arrive on the streaming platform.\n\nGodzilla X Kong is the fifth film in Legendary Pictures' Monsterverse and the sequel to 2021's Godzilla vs. Kong. The movie features the return of the Titans, who must now team up to face the Skar King — a gigantic creature that resembles Kong and threatens to destroy civilization. Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, Dan Stevens, Kaylee Hottle, Alex Ferns, and Fala Chen round out The New Empire cast.\n\nWingard described the antagonist in Godzilla x Kong as a “devilish, Kong-type character” that the Titans must defeat. “We wanted to come up with an antagonist that would both be a match for Kong and Godzilla, and that’s really hard to do,” he explained to IGN in December. “There’s a lot more to this character and how he’s a threat, and that’s going to be something that’s going to be fun to kind of dole out.”\n\nForbesDoes 'Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire' Have A Post-Credits Scene?\n\nThe director added that he didn’t want to separate Godzilla and Kong after seeing the audience’s positive reaction to the 2021 film, which grossed over 470 million at the box office, even during the COVID pandemic.\n\n“As soon as the [last] movie came out and the audiences started to see it, I was like, ‘You just can’t separate these two guys again,’” Wingard said. “It’s too exciting having them in one movie. And now, the next one has to be about the continuation of that relationship, which is going to be the team-up.”\n\nDiscover when Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is coming to Max below.\n\nWhen Is Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire Coming To Max?\n\nGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire will begin streaming on Max on July 4, 2024.\n\nAccording to Max, a version of the film with American Sign Language (ASL) will also stream exclusively on Max the same day. “This ASL version of the film was produced exclusively for Max, with ASL performer Otis Jones (Deaf West Theatre) providing interpretation,” according to the press release. “GODZILLA X KONG: THE NEW EMPIRE in ASL will be displayed as a unique title on the Max app, identifiable by its key art featuring the sign language symbol.”\n\nThe theater to Max streaming timeline for Godzilla X Kong is almost three months (or 97 days), which is longer than other recent Warner Bros. films. For example, Wonka reached Max after 84 days, whereas Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom had a shorter timeline, debuting on the streaming platform just 67 days after its December premiere.\n\nHow To Watch Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire On Max\n\nTo watch Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire on Max, you’ll need to sign up for a subscription to the site. The streaming service offers three subscription plans: With ads is $9.99 per month, ad-free is $16.99 per month, and ultimate ad-free is $20.99 per month.\n\nHow To Watch Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire On Digital\n\nGodzilla X Kong: The New Empire is currently available to purchase or rent on video-on-demand sites like Amazon Prime Video, AppleTV, YouTube, Fandango at Home, and more. The film was also released on 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and DVD from online and physical retailers on June 11.\n\nThe critical reception of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire so far has been mixed. While the action-packed film boasts a 91% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, the critics rating sits much lower at 54%."
