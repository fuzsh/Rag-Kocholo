The film stars Patrick Stewart, Carla Gugino and Matthew Lillard. The film was released on January 14, 2015, by IFC Films.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film revolves around Tobi, a middle-aged ex-dancer now working as a ballet instructor at the Juilliard School in New York City. He is asked for an interview by husband and wife Mike and Lisa, who claim Lisa is preparing a dissertation on the dance community of the 1960s. Through the course of the interview, Mike's questions keep getting more and more personal. He finally reveals that he suspects that Tobi is his biological father, as indicated by Mike's mother on her deathbed. When Tobi denies this, Mike forcefully takes a DNA sample from Tobi and rushes to a police lab, where his friend Jim performs a DNA test.\n\nOutraged by Mike's violence, Lisa stays to clean up the mess Mike made. She bonds with Tobi as a person and Tobi reveals that he knows he is Mike's father, but denied it out of shame. He declined to raise the newborn boy, abandoning Mike in favor of his dancing career. The mother then asked that he never talk to them again. He also reveals that he paid a part of Mike's college tuition. Tobi framed the pregnancy and decision to raise the child anyway as a choice the mother made; Mike explained that the mother was not raised to see abortion as a choice.\n\nWhen Mike returns to take Lisa home, the three have an argument. Tobi tells Mike to treat his wife well. After further intense argument, in which Mike graphically tells Tobi he chose to make his life so that no one loves him, the pair leave. Lisa convinces Tobi to tell Mike the truth and Tobi invites the pair for brunch the next day.\n\nOn their way to Tobi's house the next morning, Mike is called by Jim, who tells him that the DNA was not a match. When Lisa and Mike tell Tobi this, he has an anxiety attack, and politely asks them to let him be alone. As the movie ends, Tobi is heard calling friends to take them up on an offer of a dinner party.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nPatrick Stewart as Tobi Powell\n\nCarla Gugino as Lisa\n\nMatthew Lillard as Mike\n\nMaduka Steady as Cabbie\n\nJaime Tirelli as Raul\n\nRob Yang as Jim\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 17, 2013, Patrick Stewart, Carla Gugino, and Matthew Lillard joined the cast.[3]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 18, 2014.[4] The film was released theatrically on January 14, 2015, by IFC Films.[5]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nMatch received positive reviews from critics.
