        "text": "In the cemetery, Buffy is watching Trinity fight a vampire. She kicks him in the face with a high roundhouse kick, forcing him to step backward to keep his balance. The vampire does a jumping half-twisting crescent kick, knocking her to the ground.\n\nBuffy intervenes and pulls him away. He tries two punches, and Buffy neatly blocks them. On his third punch she grabs hold of his arm and hits him in the face with a high front snap kick. Letting go of the vampire's arm, Buffy punches him squarely in the midsection and follows up with a swinging punch to his face, sending him to the ground.\n\n\"We haven't been properly introduced.\" She pulls out a stake. \"I'm Buffy, and you're history!\" She plunges the stake into him as he gets up. He falls and bursts into ashes. She walks over to Trinity and helps her from the ground. \"You have to stop leaving your guard open.\"\n\nGiles pops up from behind a crypt. \"Poor technique.\" He comes around to the girls. \"Prioritizing, sub-par...execution was adequate, but a bit too bloody for my taste.\"\n\nBuffy rolls her eyes. \"Giles, don't mention it. It was my pleasure to make the world safe for humanity again.\"\n\n\"I'm not saying that your methods are without merit, it's, uh, y-you're spending too much time and energy. It should simply be; plunge, and move on. Plunge and...\" He notices something on the ground. \"Hello.\" He bends over to pick up a ring with his pen.\"\n\nBuffy sees the ring. \"Oh, that's great! I kill 'em, you fence their stuff.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Trinity asks.\n\n\"I don't know.\" He says.\n\n\"But it bothers you.\" Buffy states.\n\n\"Yes! Well, I...I thought this vampire was just on a random kill, but it may be something else.\"\n\n\"Something big?\" Trinity asks.\n\n\"Yes. I'd best consult my books.\"\n\nThe Master slams a book down on his lectern. He opens it and reads. \"'And there will be a time of crisis, of worlds hanging in the balance. And in this time shall come the Anointed, the Master's great warrior. And the Slayer will not know him, will not stop him, and he will lead her into Hell.' As it is written, so shall it be.\" He picks up the book and walks. \"'Five will die, and from their ashes the Anointed shall rise. The Brethren of Aurelius shall greet him and usher him to his immortal destiny.'\" He stops by one of the brethren. \"As it is written, so shall it be. 'And one of the brethren shall go out hunting the night before and get himself killed, because he couldn't wait to finish his job before he ate.' Oh, wait.\" He grabs one of the brethren by the throat. \"That's not written anywhere.\" He lifts the vampire off his feet. \"The Anointed will be my greatest weapon against the Slayer! If you fail to bring him to me, if you allow that girl to stop you...\" He throws the vampire into a coffin. \"Here endeth the lesson.\" He slams the book shut and walks off.\n\nBuffy walks Trinity home. \"I did good right?\" Trinity asks. \"For a first time?\"\n\nBuffy nods. \"You still have a lot to learn.\"\n\nTrinity stuffs her hands into her pockets as they walk. \"Thanks again...for training me.\"\n\n\"I admit that I was a little skeptical at first, but you have a lot of potential.\" They fall into silence as they turn a corner. \"So your parents never wig about you being out all the time? Your schedule has been pretty flexible.\"\n\nTrinity takes a moment to answer. \"It's easy when you live alone. I'm an orphan.\"\n\nBuffy stops walking, causing Trinity to stop and look at her. \"I'm sorry.\""
