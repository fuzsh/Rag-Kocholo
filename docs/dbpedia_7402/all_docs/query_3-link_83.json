        "text": "Required parameters part string\n\nThe part parameter specifies a comma-separated list of one or more search resource properties that the API response will include. Set the parameter value to snippet. Filters (specify 0 or 1 of the following parameters) forContentOwner boolean\n\nThis parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request, and it is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.\n\nThe forContentOwner parameter restricts the search to only retrieve videos owned by the content owner identified by the onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter. If forContentOwner is set to true, the request must also meet these requirements:\n\nThe onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter is required.\n\nThe user authorizing the request must be using an account linked to the specified content owner.\n\nThe type parameter value must be set to video.\n\nNone of the following other parameters can be set: videoDefinition, videoDimension, videoDuration, videoEmbeddable, videoLicense, videoPaidProductPlacement, videoSyndicated, videoType.\n\nforDeveloper boolean\n\nThis parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. The forDeveloper parameter restricts the search to only retrieve videos uploaded via the developer's application or website. The API server uses the request's authorization credentials to identify the developer. The forDeveloper parameter can be used in conjunction with optional search parameters like the q parameter.\n\nFor this feature, each uploaded video is automatically tagged with the project number that is associated with the developer's application in the Google Developers Console.\n\nWhen a search request subsequently sets the forDeveloper parameter to true, the API server uses the request's authorization credentials to identify the developer. Therefore, a developer can restrict results to videos uploaded through the developer's own app or website but not to videos uploaded through other apps or sites. forMine boolean\n\nThis parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. The forMine parameter restricts the search to only retrieve videos owned by the authenticated user. If you set this parameter to true, then the type parameter's value must also be set to video. In addition, none of the following other parameters can be set in the same request: videoDefinition, videoDimension, videoDuration, videoEmbeddable, videoLicense, videoPaidProductPlacement, videoSyndicated, videoType. Optional parameters channelId string\n\nThe channelId parameter indicates that the API response should only contain resources created by the channel.\n\nNote: Search results are constrained to a maximum of 500 videos if your request specifies a value for the channelId parameter and sets the type parameter value to video, but it does not also set one of the forContentOwner, forDeveloper, or forMine filters. channelType string\n\nThe channelType parameter lets you restrict a search to a particular type of channel.\n\nAcceptable values are:\n\nany – Return all channels.\n\nshow – Only retrieve shows.\n\neventType string\n\nThe eventType parameter restricts a search to broadcast events. If you specify a value for this parameter, you must also set the type parameter's value to video.\n\nAcceptable values are:\n\ncompleted – Only include completed broadcasts.\n\nlive – Only include active broadcasts.\n\nupcoming – Only include upcoming broadcasts.\n\nlocation string\n\nThe location parameter, in conjunction with the locationRadius parameter, defines a circular geographic area and also restricts a search to videos that specify, in their metadata, a geographic location that falls within that area. The parameter value is a string that specifies latitude/longitude coordinates e.g. (37.42307,-122.08427).\n\nThe location parameter value identifies the point at the center of the area.\n\nThe locationRadius parameter specifies the maximum distance that the location associated with a video can be from that point for the video to still be included in the search results.\n\nThe API returns an error if your request specifies a value for the location parameter but does not also specify a value for the locationRadius parameter.\n\nNote: If you specify a value for this parameter, you must also set the type parameter's value to video. locationRadius string\n\nThe locationRadius parameter, in conjunction with the location parameter, defines a circular geographic area.\n\nThe parameter value must be a floating point number followed by a measurement unit. Valid measurement units are m, km, ft, and mi. For example, valid parameter values include 1500m, 5km, 10000ft, and 0.75mi. The API does not support locationRadius parameter values larger than 1000 kilometers.\n\nNote: See the definition of the location parameter for more information. maxResults unsigned integer\n\nThe maxResults parameter specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the result set. Acceptable values are 0 to 50, inclusive. The default value is 5. onBehalfOfContentOwner string\n\nThis parameter can only be used in a properly authorized request. Note: This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.\n\nThe onBehalfOfContentOwner parameter indicates that the request's authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner. order string\n\nThe order parameter specifies the method that will be used to order resources in the API response. The default value is relevance.\n\nAcceptable values are:\n\ndate – Resources are sorted in reverse chronological order based on the date they were created.\n\nrating – Resources are sorted from highest to lowest rating.\n\nrelevance – Resources are sorted based on their relevance to the search query. This is the default value for this parameter.\n\ntitle – Resources are sorted alphabetically by title.\n\nvideoCount – Channels are sorted in descending order of their number of uploaded videos.\n\nviewCount – Resources are sorted from highest to lowest number of views. For live broadcasts, videos are sorted by number of concurrent viewers while the broadcasts are ongoing.\n\npageToken string\n\nThe pageToken parameter identifies a specific page in the result set that should be returned. In an API response, the nextPageToken and prevPageToken properties identify other pages that could be retrieved. publishedAfter datetime\n\nThe publishedAfter parameter indicates that the API response should only contain resources created at or after the specified time. The value is an RFC 3339 formatted date-time value (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z). publishedBefore datetime\n\nThe publishedBefore parameter indicates that the API response should only contain resources created before or at the specified time. The value is an RFC 3339 formatted date-time value (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z). q string\n\nThe q parameter specifies the query term to search for.\n\nYour request can also use the Boolean NOT (-) and OR (|) operators to exclude videos or to find videos that are associated with one of several search terms. For example, to search for videos matching either \"boating\" or \"sailing\", set the q parameter value to boating|sailing. Similarly, to search for videos matching either \"boating\" or \"sailing\" but not \"fishing\", set the q parameter value to boating|sailing -fishing. Note that the pipe character must be URL-escaped when it is sent in your API request. The URL-escaped value for the pipe character is %7C. regionCode string\n\nThe regionCode parameter instructs the API to return search results for videos that can be viewed in the specified country. The parameter value is an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. relevanceLanguage string\n\nThe relevanceLanguage parameter instructs the API to return search results that are most relevant to the specified language. The parameter value is typically an ISO 639-1 two-letter language code. However, you should use the values zh-Hans for simplified Chinese and zh-Hant for traditional Chinese. Please note that results in other languages will still be returned if they are highly relevant to the search query term. safeSearch string\n\nThe safeSearch parameter indicates whether the search results should include restricted content as well as standard content.\n\nAcceptable values are:\n\nmoderate – YouTube will filter some content from search results and, at the least, will filter content that is restricted in your locale. Based on their content, search results could be removed from search results or demoted in search results. This is the default parameter value.\n\nnone – YouTube will not filter the search result set.\n\nstrict – YouTube will try to exclude all restricted content from the search result set. Based on their content, search results could be removed from search results or demoted in search results.\n\ntopicId string\n\nThe topicId parameter indicates that the API response should only contain resources associated with the specified topic. The value identifies a Freebase topic ID.\n\nImportant: Due to the deprecation of Freebase and the Freebase API, the topicId parameter started working differently as of February 27, 2017. At that time, YouTube started supporting a small set of curated topic IDs, and you can only use that smaller set of IDs as values for this parameter.\n\nSee topic IDs supported as of February 15, 2017\n\nTopics Music topics /m/04rlf Music (parent topic) /m/02mscn Christian music /m/0ggq0m Classical music /m/01lyv Country /m/02lkt Electronic music /m/0glt670 Hip hop music /m/05rwpb Independent music /m/03_d0 Jazz /m/028sqc Music of Asia /m/0g293 Music of Latin America /m/064t9 Pop music /m/06cqb Reggae /m/06j6l Rhythm and blues /m/06by7 Rock music /m/0gywn Soul music Gaming topics /m/0bzvm2 Gaming (parent topic) /m/025zzc Action game /m/02ntfj Action-adventure game /m/0b1vjn Casual game /m/02hygl Music video game /m/04q1x3q Puzzle video game /m/01sjng Racing video game /m/0403l3g Role-playing video game /m/021bp2 Simulation video game /m/022dc6 Sports game /m/03hf_rm Strategy video game Sports topics /m/06ntj Sports (parent topic) /m/0jm_ American football /m/018jz Baseball /m/018w8 Basketball /m/01cgz Boxing /m/09xp_ Cricket /m/02vx4 Football /m/037hz Golf /m/03tmr Ice hockey /m/01h7lh Mixed martial arts /m/0410tth Motorsport /m/07bs0 Tennis /m/07_53 Volleyball Entertainment topics /m/02jjt Entertainment (parent topic) /m/09kqc Humor /m/02vxn Movies /m/05qjc Performing arts /m/066wd Professional wrestling /m/0f2f9 TV shows Lifestyle topics /m/019_rr Lifestyle (parent topic) /m/032tl Fashion /m/027x7n Fitness /m/02wbm Food /m/03glg Hobby /m/068hy Pets /m/041xxh Physical attractiveness [Beauty] /m/07c1v Technology /m/07bxq Tourism /m/07yv9 Vehicles Society topics /m/098wr Society (parent topic) /m/09s1f Business /m/0kt51 Health /m/01h6rj Military /m/05qt0 Politics /m/06bvp Religion Other topics /m/01k8wb Knowledge\n\ntype string\n\nThe type parameter restricts a search query to only retrieve a particular type of resource.
