        "text": "If Excel is installed on your computer, you can take advantage of the advanced charting capabilities in Word.\n\nWhat do you want to do?\n\nLearn about charts\n\nStep 1: Create a basic chart\n\nInsert a chart by embedding it into your document\n\nPaste a linked Excel chart into your document\n\nArrange the Excel worksheet data\n\nStep 2: Change the layout or style of a chart\n\nApply a predefined chart layout\n\nApply a predefined chart style\n\nChange the format of chart elements manually\n\nStep 3: Add or remove titles or data labels\n\nAdd a chart title\n\nAdd axis titles\n\nAdd data labels\n\nStep 4: Show or hide a legend\n\nStep 5: Display or hide primary chart axes or gridlines\n\nStep 6: Move or resize a chart\n\nMove a chart\n\nResize a chart\n\nStep 7: Save a chart as a template\n\nLearn about charts\n\nCharts are used to display series of numeric data in a graphical format to make it easier to understand large quantities of data and the relationship between different series of data.\n\n1. Worksheet data\n\n2. Chart created from worksheet data\n\nExcel supports many types of charts to help you display data in ways that are meaningful to your audience. When you create a chart or change an existing chart, you can select from a variety of chart types (such as a column chart or a pie chart) and their subtypes (such as a stacked column chart or a pie in 3-D chart). You can also create a combination chart by using more than one chart type in your chart.\n\nFor more information about the chart types that you can select in Excel, see Available chart types.\n\nGetting to know the elements of a chart\n\nA chart has many elements. Some of these elements are displayed by default, others can be added as needed. You can change the display of the chart elements by moving them to other locations in the chart, resizing them, or by changing the format. You can also remove chart elements that you do not want to display.\n\n1. The chart area of the chart.\n\n2. The plot area of the chart.\n\n3. The data points of the data series that are plotted in the chart.\n\n4. The horizontal (category) and vertical (value) axis along which the data is plotted in the chart.\n\n5. The legend of the chart.\n\n6. A chart and axis title that you can use in the chart.\n\n7. A data label that you can use to identify the details of a data point in a data series.\n\nModifying a basic chart to meet your needs\n\nAfter you create a chart, you can modify any one of its elements. For example, you might want to change the way that axes are displayed, add a chart title, move or hide the legend, or display additional chart elements.\n\nTo modify a chart, you can:\n\nChange the display of chart axes You can specify the scale of axes and adjust the interval between the values or categories that are displayed. To make your chart easier to read, you can also add tick marks to an axis, and specify the interval at which they will appear.\n\nAdd titles and data labels to a chart To help clarify the information that appears in your chart, you can add a chart title, axis titles, and data labels.\n\nAdd a legend or data table You can show or hide a legend, change its location, or modify the legend entries. In some charts, you can also show a data table that displays the legend keys and the values that are presented in the chart.\n\nApply special options for each chart type Special lines (such as high-low lines and trendlines), bars (such as up-down bars and error bars), data markers, and other options are available for different chart types.\n\nApplying a predefined chart layout and chart style for a professional look\n\nInstead of manually adding or changing chart elements or formatting the chart, you can quickly apply a predefined chart layout and chart style to your chart. Word provides a variety of useful predefined layouts and styles that you can select, but you can fine-tune a layout or style if it is needed by making manual changes to the layout and format of individual chart elements, such as the chart area, plot area, data series, or legend of the chart.\n\nWhen you apply a predefined chart layout, a specific set of chart elements (such as titles, a legend, a data table, or data labels) are displayed in a specific arrangement in your chart. You can select from a variety of layouts that are provided for each chart type.\n\nWhen you apply a predefined chart style, the chart is formatted based on the document theme that you have applied, so that your chart matches your organization's or your own theme colors (a set of colors), theme fonts (a set of heading and body text fonts), and theme effects (a set of lines and fill effects).\n\nYou cannot create your own chart layouts or styles, but you can create chart templates that include the chart layout and formatting that you want.\n\nAdding eye-catching formatting to a chart\n\nIn addition to applying a predefined chart style, you can easily apply formatting to individual chart elements such as data markers, the chart area, the plot area, and the numbers and text in titles and labels to give your chart a custom, eye-catching look. You can apply specific shape styles and WordArt styles, and you can also format the shapes and text of chart elements manually.\n\nTo add formatting, you can:\n\nFill chart elements You can use colors, textures, pictures, and gradient fills to help draw attention to specific chart elements.\n\nChange the outline of chart elements You can use colors, line styles, and line weights to emphasize chart elements.\n\nAdd special effects to chart elements You can apply special effects, such as shadow, reflection, glow, soft edges, bevel, and 3-D rotation to chart element shapes, which gives your chart a finished look.\n\nFormat text and numbers You can format text and numbers in titles, labels, and text boxes on a chart as you would text and numbers on a worksheet. To make text and numbers stand out, you can even apply WordArt styles.\n\nReusing charts by creating chart templates\n\nIf you want to reuse a chart that you customized to meet your needs, you can save that chart as a chart template (*.crtx) in the chart templates folder. When you create a chart, you can then apply the chart template just as you would any other built-in chart type. In fact, chart templates are custom chart types — you can also use them to change the chart type of an existing chart. If you use a specific chart template frequently, you can save it as the default chart type.\n\nTop of Page\n\nStep 1: Create a basic chart\n\nYou can add a chart to your Word document in one of two ways: insert a chart by embedding it into your Word document or paste an Excel chart into your Word document that is linked to data in an Excel worksheet. The main differences between embedded charts and linked charts are where the data is stored and how you update the data after you place it in the Word document.\n\nNote: Some chart types require a specific data arrangement in the Excel worksheet. For more information, see Arrange the Excel worksheet data.\n\nInsert a chart by embedding it in your document\n\nWhen you embed an Excel chart, information in the Word file doesn't change if you modify the source Excel file. Embedded objects become part of the Word file and, after they are inserted, they are no longer part of the source file.\n\nBecause the information is totally contained in one Word document, embedding is useful when you don't want the information to reflect changes in the source file, or when you don't want the document recipients to be concerned with updating the linked information.\n\nIn your Word document, click Insert > Chart.\n\nSelect the type of chart you want, such as column or pie chart, and click OK. (If you’re not sure which to choose, move down the All Charts list to preview each type.)\n\nEnter your data into the spreadsheet that automatically opens with the chart. The chart will update to match the data after you finish typing data into one cell and move to the next.\n\nTop of Page\n\nPaste a linked Excel chart into your document\n\nYou can create and copy a chart in an external Excel worksheet, and paste a linked version of the chart into your Word document. When a chart is linked, information can be updated if the external Excel worksheet is modified. Linked data is stored in the Excel worksheet. The Word document stores only the location of the source file, and it displays a representation of the linked data.\n\nLinking is also useful when you want to include information that is maintained independently, such as data collected by a different department, and when you need to keep that information up-to-date in a Word document. For more information about creating charts in Excel, see Create a chart.\n\nIn Excel, select the chart by clicking its border, and then on the Home tab, in the Clipboard group, click Cut.\n\nThe chart is removed, but the data remains in Excel.\n\nIn Word, click where you want to insert the chart in the document.\n\nOn the Home tab, in the Clipboard group, click Paste.\n\nThe Paste Options button indicates that the chart is linked to data in Excel.\n\nSave the Word document with the chart that you linked to data in Excel.\n\nWhen you reopen the Word document, click Yes to update the Excel data.\n\nYou can also create visual representations of information by using SmartArt graphics. For more information, see Create a SmartArt graphic.\n\nTop of Page\n\nArrange the Excel worksheet data\n\nFor most charts, such as column and bar charts, you can plot the data that you arrange in rows or columns on a worksheet into a chart. However, some chart types (such as pie and bubble charts) require a specific data arrangement.\n\nOn the worksheet, arrange the data that you want to plot in a chart.\n\nThe data can be arranged in rows or columns — Excel automatically determines the best way to plot the data in the chart. Some chart types (such as pie and bubble charts) require a specific data arrangement as described in the following table.\n\nFor this chart type\n\nArrange the data\n\nSelect the cells that contain the data that you want to use for the chart.\n\nTip: If you select only one cell, Excel automatically plots all cells that contain data that is adjacent to that cell into a chart. If the cells that you want to plot in a chart are not in a continuous range, you can select nonadjacent cells or ranges as long as the selection forms a rectangle. You can also hide the rows or columns that you do not want to plot in the chart.\n\nHow to select cells, ranges, rows, or columns\n\nTo select\n\nDo this\n\nTo cancel a selection of cells, click any cell on the worksheet.\n\nOn the Insert tab, in the Charts group, do one of the following:\n\nClick the chart type, and then click a chart subtype that you want to use.\n\nTo see all available chart types, click a chart type, and then click All Chart Types or the More menu item to display the Insert Chart dialog box, click the arrows to scroll through all available chart types and chart subtypes, and then click the ones that you want to use.\n\nA ScreenTip displays the chart type name when you rest the mouse pointer over any chart type or chart subtype. For more information about the chart types that you can use, see Available chart types.\n\nBy default, the chart is placed on the worksheet as an embedded chart. If you want to place the chart in a separate chart sheet, you can change its location by doing the following:\n\nClick the embedded chart to select it.\n\nThis displays the Chart Tools tab.\n\nOn the Design tab, in the Location group, click Move Chart.\n\nUnder Choose where you want the chart to be placed, do one of the following:\n\nTo display the chart in a chart sheet, click New sheet.\n\nIf you want to replace the suggested name for the chart, you can type a new name in the New sheet box.\n\nTo display the chart as an embedded chart in a worksheet, click Object in, and then click a worksheet in the Object in box.\n\nTo quickly create a chart that is based on the default chart type, select the data that you want to use for the chart, and then press ALT+F1. When you press ALT+F1, the chart is displayed as an embedded chart.\n\nWhen you create a chart, Excel determines the orientation of the data series based on the nnumber of worksheet rows and columns that are included in the chart. After you create a chart, you can change the way that worksheet rows and columns are plotted in the chart by switching rows to columns or vice versa.\n\nIf you no longer need a chart, you can delete it. Click the chart to select it, and then press DELETE.\n\nTop of Page\n\nStep 2: Change the layout or style of a chart\n\nAfter you create a chart, you can instantly change its look. Instead of manually adding or changing chart elements or formatting the chart, you can quickly apply a predefined layout and style to your chart. Word provides a variety of useful predefined layouts and styles (or quick layouts and quick styles) that you can select from, but you can customize a layout or style as needed by manually changing the layout and format of individual chart elements.\n\nApply a predefined chart layout\n\nClick the chart that you want to format by using a predefined chart layout.\n\nThis displays the Chart Tools tab, adding the Design and Format tabs.\n\nOn the Design tab, in the Chart Layouts group, click Quick Layout, and then click the chart layout that you want to use.\n\nTo see all available layouts, click More .\n\nTop of Page\n\nApply a predefined chart style\n\nClick the chart that you want to format by using a predefined chart style.\n\nThis displays the Chart Tools, adding the Design and Format tabs.\n\nOn the Design tab, in the Chart Styles group, click the chart style that you want to use.\n\nTo see all predefined chart styles, click More .\n\nTop of Page\n\nChange the format of chart elements manually\n\nClick the chart or the chart element for which you want to change the style, or do the following to select a chart element from a list of chart elements.\n\nClick a chart to display the Chart Tools.\n\nOn the Format tab, in the Current Selection group, click the arrow next to the Chart Elements box, and then click the chart element that you want.\n\nOn the Format tab, do any of the following:\n\nTo format any selected chart element, in the Current Selection group, click Format Selection, and then select the formatting options that you want.\n\nTo format the shape of a selected chart element, in the Shape Styles group, click the style that you want, or click Shape Fill, Shape Outline, or Shape Effects, and then select the formatting options that you want.\n\nTo format the text in a selected chart element by using WordArt, in the WordArt Styles group, click the style that you want, or click Text Fill, Text Outline, or Text Effects, and then select the formatting options that you want.\n\nNote: After you apply a WordArt style, you cannot remove the WordArt format. If you do not want the WordArt style that you applied, you can select another WordArt style, or you can click Undo on the Quick Access Toolbar to return to the previous text format.\n\nTip: To use regular text formatting to format the text in chart elements, you can right-click or select the text, and then click the formatting options that you want on the Mini toolbar. You can also use the formatting buttons on the Ribbon (Home tab, Font group).\n\nTop of Page\n\nStep 3: Add or remove titles or data labels\n\nTo make a chart easier to understand, you can add titles, such as a chart title and axis titles. Axis titles are typically available for all axes that can be displayed in a chart, including depth (series) axes in 3-D charts. Some chart types (such as radar charts) have axes, but they cannot display axis titles. Chart types that do not have axes (such as pie and doughnut charts) cannot display axis titles either.\n\nYou can also link chart and axis titles to corresponding text in worksheet cells by creating a reference to those cells. Linked titles are automatically updated in the chart when you change the corresponding text on the worksheet.\n\nTo quickly identify a data series in a chart, you can add data labels to the data points of the chart. By default, the data labels are linked to values on the worksheet, and they update automatically when changes are made to these values.\n\nAdd a chart title\n\nClick the chart to which you want to add a title, and then click the Chart Elements button.\n\nIn the Chart Elements list that appears, select Chart Title.\n\nIn the Chart Title text box that appears in the chart, type the text that you want.\n\nTo insert a line break, click to place the pointer where you want to break the line, and then press ENTER.\n\nTo format the text, select it, and then click the formatting options that you want on the Mini toolbar.\n\nTop of Page\n\nAdd axis titles\n\nClick the chart to which you want to add axis titles, and then click the Chart Elements button.\n\nIn the Chart Elements list that appears, select Axis Titles.\n\nSelect the axis titles that are added to your chart and type the text that you want.\n\nTo format the text, select it, and then click the formatting options that you want on the Mini toolbar.\n\nTop of Page\n\nAdd data labels\n\nClick the chart to which you want to add data labels, and then click the Chart Elements button.\n\nIn the Chart Elements list that appears, select Data Labels.\n\nSelect the data labels that are added to your chart and type the text that you want.\n\nNote: Depending on the chart type that you used, different data label options will be available.\n\nFor more information about how to change data label entries or how to reposition data labels, see Add or remove data labels in a chart.\n\nTop of Page\n\nStep 4: Show or hide a legend\n\nWhen you create a chart, the legend appears, but you can hide the legend or change its location after you create the chart.\n\nClick the chart in which you want to show or hide the legend, and then click the Chart Elements button.\n\nIn the Chart Elements list that appears, select or clear Legend.\n\nWhen a chart has a legend displayed, you can modify the individual legend entries. For more information, see Modify chart legend entries.\n\nTop of Page\n\nStep 5: Display or hide primary chart axes or gridlines\n\nWhen you create a chart, primary axes are displayed for most chart types. You can turn them on or off as needed. When you add axes, you can specify the level of detail that you want the axes to display. A depth axis is displayed when you create a 3-D chart.\n\nTo make a chart easier to read, you can display or hide the horizontal and vertical chart gridlines that extend from any horizontal and vertical axes across the plot area of the chart.\n\nClick the chart in which you want to display or hide axes or gridlines, and then click the Chart Elements button.\n\nIn the Chart Elements list that appears, select or clear Axes or Gridlines.\n\nTop of Page\n\nStep 6: Move or resize a chart\n\nYou can move a chart to any location on a document. You can also change the size of the chart for a better fit.\n\nMove a chart\n\nTo move a chart, drag it to the location that you want.\n\nTop of Page\n\nResize a chart\n\nTo resize a chart, do one of the following:\n\nClick the chart, and then drag the sizing handles to the size that you want.\n\nOn the Format tab, in the Size group, enter the size in the Shape Height and Shape Width box.\n\nFor more sizing options, on the Format tab, in the Size group, click the Dialog Box Launcher . On the Size tab, you can select options to size, rotate, or scale the chart.\n\nTop of Page\n\nStep 7: Save a chart as a template\n\nIf you want to create another chart like the one that you just created, you can save the chart as a template that you can use as the basis for other similar charts.\n\nRight-click the chart that you want to save as a template, and then click Save as Template.\n\nNote: A chart template contains chart formatting and stores the colors that are in use when you save the chart as a template. When you use a chart template to create a chart in another workbook, the new chart uses the colors of the chart template — not the colors of the document theme that is currently applied to the workbook. To use the document theme colors instead of the chart template colors, right-click the chart area, and then click Reset to Match Style on the shortcut menu.\n\nTop of Page"
