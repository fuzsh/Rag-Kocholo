        "text": "2023 film by Celine Song\n\nPast LivesDirected byCeline SongWritten byCeline SongProduced byStarringCinematographyShabier KirchnerEdited byKeith FraaseMusic by\n\nProduction\n\ncompanies\n\nDistributed byA24\n\nRelease dates\n\nRunning time\n\n106 minutes[1]Country\n\nUnited States[2][3]\n\nSouth KoreaLanguages\n\nEnglish\n\nKorean\n\nBox office$42.5 million[4]\n\nPast Lives is a 2023 romantic drama film written and directed by Celine Song in her feature directorial debut. Starring Greta Lee, Teo Yoo, and John Magaro, it follows two childhood friends over the course of 24 years while they contemplate the nature of their relationship as they grow apart, living different lives. The plot is semi-autobiographical and inspired by real events from Song's life.[5]\n\nPast Lives premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2023, and was released theatrically in the United States on June 2, 2023. It was named one of the top ten films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute, receiving critical acclaim and multiple accolades, including five nominations at the 81st Golden Globe Awards.[6][7] At the 96th Academy Awards, it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2000, Seoul, South Korea, Na Young and Hae Sung are 12-year-old classmates who develop feelings for one another and go on a date set up by their parents. Shortly thereafter, Na Young's family immigrates to Toronto and the two lose contact. Na Young changes her name to Nora Moon.\n\nTwelve years later, in 2012, Hae Sung has finished his military service and Nora has moved to New York City. One day, Nora discovers on Facebook that Hae Sung had posted that he was looking for Na Young, unaware of her name change. They reconnect through video calls but are unable to visit each other, as Nora plans to attend a writer's retreat in Montauk and Hae Sung is moving to China for a Mandarin language exchange. Eventually, Nora tells Hae Sung they should stop talking for a while, as she wants to focus on her writing and life in New York.\n\nAt her retreat, Nora meets Arthur Zaturansky and they fall in love, at one point discussing the Buddhist-derived concept of inyeon (인연, dependent origination), how a relationship between two souls in the present life is influenced by their relationships in thousands of past lives. Hae Sung also meets a woman, whom he begins to date.\n\nTwelve more years pass, with Arthur and Nora married and living in New York. Hae Sung, no longer with his girlfriend, goes to meet Nora there. Arthur wonders if he is a roadblock in their own imperfect love story, suggesting to Nora that, if another man with a similar appeal had met her at the time, Nora would have engaged him and married him to secure a green card for U.S. residency. Nora affirms that she loves Arthur. The following night, the three go out to dinner. Initially, Nora translates each dialogue, but eventually speaks with Hae Sung exclusively in Korean. He wonders what they were to each other in their past lives, and what would have happened if she had never left South Korea and they stayed together. When Nora goes to the bathroom, Hae Sung apologizes to Arthur for speaking alone with Nora, but Arthur says he is glad to have met him.\n\nThey return to Arthur and Nora's apartment. Hae Sung invites them to visit him in South Korea and calls for an Uber. Nora waits with him, and the two exchange long, meaningful looks at each other until the Uber arrives. Hae Sung wonders whether they were, at that moment, experiencing a past life, and asks Nora what their relationship will be in their next life. She says she does not know. Hae Sung says, \"I'll see you then.\" He leaves in the car and she walks back to her apartment, crying in Arthur's arms.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2020, it was announced Choi Woo-shik would star in the film, with Celine Song set to direct from a screenplay she wrote, and A24 set to produce and distribute alongside Killer Films and CJ ENM.[8] In August 2021, it was announced that Greta Lee, Teo Yoo, and John Magaro joined the cast of the film, with Yoo replacing Choi.[9]\n\nCinematographer Shabier Kirchner shot Past Lives on 35 mm film.[10] Production took place during July and August 2021 at locations around New York, including the city's ferries, and under and along the landmark Manhattan Bridge. The apartment sets for Hae Sung and Nora's Skype/Zoom conversations were built adjacent to one another at Greenpoint Studios, Brooklyn, and filmed simultaneously. The production then moved to Seoul, South Korea, and filmed from late October to early November.[11]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Past Lives (soundtrack)\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2023.[12] It was also screened at 73rd Berlin International Film Festival on February 19, 2023.[13] Later that month, StudioCanal and CJ ENM were among the distributors acquiring the international distribution rights.[14] It was the opening film for the 2023 Seattle International Film Festival.[15] Past Lives had a limited theatrical release in the United States on June 2, 2023,[16] before expanding to more theaters on June 9; it was released nationwide on June 23.[17]\n\nIt was screened at the 28th Busan International Film Festival as part of \"Korean American Special Exhibition: Korean Diaspora\" on 5 October 2023.[18]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nPast Lives grossed $11.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $31.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $42.3 million.[4]\n\nThe film grossed $232,266 from four theaters in its opening weekend, an average of $55,066 per venue.[19] By its sixth weekend, the film had a running total of $8.4 million.[20]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 95% of 307 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"A remarkable debut for writer-director Celine Song, Past Lives uses the bonds between its sensitively sketched central characters to support trenchant observations on the human condition.\"[21] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 94 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[22] ABC News reported that the film received critical acclaim.[23]\n\nManola Darghis, writing for The New York Times, compared the film to French romantic cinema, complimenting its restraint in the presentation of its main themes, and stating: \"The movie’s modesty — its intimacy, human scale, humble locations and lack of visual oomph — is one of its strengths. The characters live in homes that are pleasant yet ordinary, the kind that you can imagine hanging out in, the kind you want to hang out in. There are few big, look-at-me details, though you might notice a poster for Jacques Rivette’s 1974 classic Céline and Julie Go Boating in Nora’s father’s home office in Seoul.\"[24] Writing in The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw was fulsome in his praise of the film comparing it to those of Richard Linklater, Noah Baumbach, and Greta Gerwig. He said of the film: \"Past Lives is a glorious date movie, and a movie for every occasion, too. As ever with films like this, there is an auxiliary pleasure in wondering how much of her own past life Song has used. It's a must-see.\"[25]\n\nFilmmaker Daniel Scheinert, who co-directed A24's Everything Everywhere All at Once with his partner Daniel Kwan, praised the film, saying: \"It's remarkable, the way she [Celine Song] pushed past the story of 'picking mister right' and the story of 'fighting to win the girl' and somehow brought her audience to this painfully relatable heartbreak on the other side of those stories. I'm inspired by it. And mystified by how the filmmaking team did it. But when I was lucky enough to see a Q&A and have some brunch with Celine, I saw how curious and thoughtful and passionate and charmingly bossy she was, and I was instantly convinced that this movie was no accident. It's a smart, confident, unique poem because Celine is a smart, confident, unique poet.\"[26] Filmmaker Christopher Nolan also praised the film and named it one of his favorites, describing it as \"subtle in a beautiful sort of way\".[27]\n\nRetrospective lists\n\n[edit]\n\nCollider ranked it number 7 on its list of the \"20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far\", calling it \"a story that could only exist because of modern circumstances, but feels timeless in its approach. How does someone choose between two lovers, one that represents the most fruitful days of her youth, and the other someone she has grown to love as part of her reality? Celine Song examines these critical conversations through the perspective of an immigrant story.\"[28]\n\nIn 2024, IndieWire included it on its list of the \"Best American Independent Movies of the 21st Century\".[29]\n\nThe National Society of Film Critics named the film its best picture of 2023.[30]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nAward Date of ceremony Category Nominee(s) Result Ref.
