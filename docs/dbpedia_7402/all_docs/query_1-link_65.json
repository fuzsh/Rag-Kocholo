        "text": "For other uses of this name, see One Piece (Disambiguation).\n\nThe One Piece Movies are theatrical films produced and released by Toei Animation. While generally made with the same cast and crew as the TV anime, they tend to boast much higher production values and animation quality.\n\nInitially, these movies were released annually as part of Toei's springtime 'Anime Fair' events, always as a double feature with various Digimon films. After the third movie (released in 2002), Toei discontinued the fair, and all subsequent movies were produced as standalone features (with the exception of the eleventh movie, released as a double feature with Toriko 3D Movie: Kaimaku! Gourmet Adventure!! for Toei's 2011 'Jump Heroes' event).\n\nMost of the movies have completely original stand-alone plots set broadly around the contemporary story arc, but movies 8 and 9 directly adapt storylines from the manga. For the first nine movies, Eiichiro Oda was not involved in the films any more than other anime projects; This changed with the production of movie 10, for which Oda wrote the story and served as executive producer. Oda would also be heavily involved in movies 12, 13, and 15, for which he is credited as \"general producer\" (総合プロデューサー, sōgō purodyūsā?). These four movies all carry the subtitle 'One Piece Film'.\n\nThree of these movies had shorts accompanying them: The Adventure on Clockwork Island with Jango's Dance Carnival, Chopper's Island of Strange Animals with Dream Soccer King, and The Curse of the Sacred Sword with Take Aim! The Pirate Baseball King.\n\nSeveral movie-length TV Specials have also been produced by Toei.\n\nTheatrical Movies[]\n\nOne Piece: The Movie\n\nClockwork Island Adventure\n\nChopper's Kingdom on the Island of Strange Animals\n\nDead End Adventure\n\nThe Cursed Holy Sword\n\nBaron Omatsuri and the Secret Island\n\nThe Giant Mechanical Soldier of Karakuri Castle\n\nEpisode of Arabasta: The Desert Princess and the Pirates\n\nEpisode of Chopper Plus: Bloom in Winter, Miracle Sakura\n\nOne Piece Film: Strong World\n\nOne Piece 3D: Straw Hat Chase\n\nOne Piece Film: Z\n\nOne Piece Film: Gold\n\nOne Piece: Stampede\n\nOne Piece Film: Red\n\nTrivia[]\n\nMovies 1-3 and 11, being released as double-features, are all under an hour long.\n\nThe animation in Movie 6 was experimental. Much of the world was produced in CGI and was similar to that of Gunbound. However it was used again, albeit to a lesser extent, for Movie 9, and the character design was used for Episode 388.\n\nLike with many anime movies, the One Piece Movie 7 featured scenes in the preview animations that never actually were seen in the movie itself. These included Sanji fighting a raptor-like mecha (which was changed to a man in a machine) and Zoro's fight against one of the machines was much longer. While the other One Piece movies also suffered such scene cuts, Movie 7 was noted for having the most noticeable cuts.\n\nMovies 8 and 9 are both based on story arcs of the anime/manga of One Piece. Episode of Arabasta: The Desert Princess and the Pirates is based on the Arabasta Arc and Episode of Chopper Plus: Bloom in Winter, Miracle Sakura is based on the Drum Island Arc.\n\nMovie 4's ending follows directly into Movie 5's opening, making these films the only ones to be linked.\n\nSo far, only Movies 8, 10, and 12-15 have been dubbed by Funimation, and there were no movies dubbed by 4Kids. Movies 1-7 and 9 were also released with English subtitles in the UK via Manga Entertainment.\n\nMovie 1 was animated using cels rather than the digital animation utilized for the TV series and later films.\n\nMovies 1-4 were transferred to 35mm film, while Movie 5 onwards were transferred to digital, looking sharper as a result.\n\nMovie 11 was the first One Piece film to be animated in CGI, and the first film to be in 3D. A 3D version of Movie 13 was also released.\n\nSite Navigation[]\n\nSea of Survival: Super Rookies SagaEast Blue:Cover Stories:Arabasta:Cover Stories:Sky Island:Cover Stories:Water 7:Cover Stories:Thriller Bark:Cover Story:Summit War:Cover Stories:\n\nThe Final Sea: The New World SagaFish-Man Island:Cover Story:Dressrosa:Cover Stories:Whole Cake Island:Cover Stories:Wano Country:Cover Stories:Final:Cover Stories:\n\nNon-CanonFiller Arcs:Movies:Specials:Featurettes:OVAs:\n\nOther Related StoriesSupplementary Stories:Omake:Crossovers:One-Shots:Events:"
