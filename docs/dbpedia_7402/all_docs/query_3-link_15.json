Even so, you may occasionally still have trouble matching a particular item.\n\nIn cases where the item is completely unmatched, the menu will instead simply be Match, but it otherwise works similarly.\n\nRelated Page: Your Media\n\nOpening Fix Match\n\nTo access the feature:\n\nOpen the details screen for the item in Plex Web App\n\nClick the … in the main action bar to expose additional actions\n\nChoose Fix Match…\n\nTip!: For television libraries, Fix Match… is only available at the show level (not at the season or episode level).\n\nRelated Page:\n\nUsing Fix Match\n\nIt looks like we didn’t name our content well enough and our 2012 animated Disney movie Brave instead got matched as the 2007 drama The Brave One. Luckily, we can easily correct that with the Fix Match… action.\n\nBy default, when you open the Fix Match window, a search will be performed and suggested matches will be displayed.\n\nYou’ll see the name of the match and other information, to help you choose the correct result. (If you’re using an older metadata agent, your results may not have as much information.)\n\nThe top match of “Brave” released in 2012 looks like the correct one. If we choose that and let the metadata get downloaded, we end up with the correct result.\n\nSometimes, though, you may still need to do additional searching or matching.\n\nSearch Options\n\nIf you select Search Options at the top of the window, you’ll be able to customize the search being performed.\n\nYou can specify the name/title to search, the year, and even adjust the language to search. Once you’ve entered the desired information and pressed the Search button, you’ll again be presented with results of the search.\n\nTips\n\nThere are a couple of neat tricks you can use to help with matching."
