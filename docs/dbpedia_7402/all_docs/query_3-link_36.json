        "text": "using version 10.0.12.2 (UC1) on windows 7 home ultimate.\n\nWhen I start a new project and save the edit file the first time, its name goes atop the monitor window. If I re-save (or \"save as\") a new version of my project/edit file (the \".MVP\" file) with a different name, the monitor window header does not reflect that change. It always shows that first project name given, when the project was first started. This means, if I have a couple different edit versions, when working on any one version edit, I cannot see what version I'm working on.\n\nAny advice from anyone? Maybe I'm not using the program correctly?\n\nDoes anyone else have this problem?\n\nBoris\n\nHi Boris\n\nIf you look more closely at the names at the top you will see that when you use Save project as the naming does change as shown in this example\n\nThis project initially started out named 3D Test 3 the attached movie is also called 3D Test 3 - MEP does this without you knowing - look on the tab just above the timeline in 2013 or click the film reel icon in MX and previous versions to see the movie name.\n\nBecause the project name and the movie name are the same you only get one name at the top of the screen.\n\nWhen you save the project with a different name eg 3D Test 3a as in the image above you can see the project has changed but the movie has not - because they are now different the title bar shows in the example that I have 3D Test 3a project loaded with the 3D Test 3 movie..\n\nIt is not until you rename the movie to match the project name that the two merge to one name again.\n\nThis leads to the question - Why does not MEP rename the movie as well?\n\nMEP can load different movies into one project - like my current project as shown below\n\nTo clarify - each movie was created as a seperate project and then loaded into the composite project so I will end up with 7 seperate movies with menus etc on one disc.\n\nYou will also see in a multi movie project that the movie name changes in the title bar to match the one you are working on in the timeline.\n\nJohn\n\nTo clarify - each movie was created as a seperate project and then loaded into the composite project so I will end up with 7 seperate movies with menus etc on one disc.\n\nYou will also see in a multi movie project that the movie name changes in the title bar to match the one you are working on in the timeline.\n\nJohn\n\nTHanks John and George,\n\nI'm having a little trouble wrapping my brain around this, but I do acknowledgeI guess my problem is linguistic... or maybe Magix problem is linguistic (since they are not native english speakers... um, but then neither am I):\n\nTo me \"project\" is a \"larger\" term than \"movie.\" So there can be multiple movies involved in one project, but there can not be more than one project associated with a movie (usually).\n\nBut it sounds like \"project\" means i.e. the .MVP file, and \"movie\" means the encompassing folder/directory that contains all the component parts, various edits (i.e. \"projects\" ==.MVP files).\n\nIs that right?\n\nthanks\n\nBoris\n\nYou've nearly got it! Yes each project, be it with one movie or many, is saved as a .MVP file. But a movie's resources need not be associated with a particular folder or directory though that might be a good option for a workflow.\n\nI'd describe a 'movie' as everything that's on the timeline (clips, images, audio, titles, transitions & other effects). If you have a multi movie project you can only see the tracks for one movie at time -- hence the convention of showing both a project name and the (currently visible and editable) movie name at the top of the window.\n\nThis is still confusing to me. As I understand it, the .MVP file stores all of the 'metadata' which describes what you see on the timeline: the in out cut points, pointers to source files, various adjustments you make to the source files (e.g. stereoscopic alignments, audio levels, etc.). And I'm guessing that is what is also called the \"PROJECT.\"\n\nYou've nearly got it! Yes each project, be it with one movie or many, is saved as a .MVP file.

In your description, you've given similar meanings to the two words. Yet you also say \"multi-movie project,\" which implies that movies are what's on the timeline, and the project is a larger concept encompassing all.\n\nOr.. the only way I can reconcile all the description you give... can a project file - .MVP file - contain more than one \"movie,\" each of which has it's own discrete, separate timeline? But the how do switch between different movies in an .MVP file?\n\nHey thanks, that film reel icon is new to me. (Apologies, I am apparently not very perceptive). Sadly, as often seems the case with MEP, answering one question only begets more questions.\n\nI noticed I can change the name of the \"movie\" in that pulldown menu. So I did that, an \"saved as\" a new movie name_2. Then I went back to the movie reel icon, and it no longer showed the original. (That is, I would have expected it now to give me the choice of two versions: the original \"name\" movie, and the new \"name_2\" movie. This is often how I work with stills or drawings, you know? When I make some changes but want to preserve the immediately prior version, I \"save as\" a new version.\n\nThe other odd thing is that though the pull-down invites me to save a new \"movie,\" the file that is actually being saved is an .MVP file, which I thought was a \"project.\"\n\nI'm sorry I'm being so dense on this, and if you give up on me, I wouldn't hold it against you. But frankly, I still don't understand what they mean by \"movie\" versus \"project.\" Plus, lacking this understanding, I don't really know how to manage the content in terms of versioning. About the only thing I understand, is that if I want to save a different version of my work, to have that change reflected in the filename AND have the older version accessible to me, I have to start a new \"project.\"\n\n\"Or.. the only way I can reconcile all the description you give... can a project file - .MVP file - contain more than one \"movie,\" each of which has it's own discrete, separate timeline?

How to switch between different movies has recently changed from a little film reel icon with a drop down menu:"
