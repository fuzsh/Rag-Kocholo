        "text": "Open Forum question via email from Brittany:\n\nIs it ever okay for two very different movies to share the same title if the title is something vague or common, even a single word? For example, the word I was thinking of was “Hero”, but my screenplay’s subject matter is completely unrelated to the 2002 Jet Li film. I forsee a lot of problems down the road if I don’t come up with something more original, but it got me thinking — what is the etiquette when it comes to situations like this? Should an appropriate number of years have passed before a film with a similar name comes out, or should the title be abandoned altogether?"
