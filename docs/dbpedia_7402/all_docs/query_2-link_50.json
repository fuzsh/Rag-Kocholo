        "text": "On Disney+\n\nAs Variety first reported, Kathryn Hahn will star in this “WandaVision” spin-off series about Agatha Harkness, the witch she played to Emmy-nominated perfection. “WandaVision” head writer Jac Schaeffer will write and executive produce the show, part of her overall deal with Marvel Studios and 20th Television. In keeping with Hahn’s performance, the new show will be a dark comedy — and a mischievous one.\n\nThe show was first announced with the title “Agatha: House of Harkness”; in July 2022, that was updated to “Agatha: Coven of Chaos,” then in Sept. 2023, updated again to “Agatha: Darkhold Diaries,” and finally in May 2024 to “Agatha: The Lying Witch With Great Wardrobe.” The real title was finally revealed at Disney’s 2024 upfront presentation as “Agatha All Along,” evoking the instant classic song about the witch from “WandaVision.”\n\nPatti LuPone, Aubrey Plaza, Joe Locke (“Heartstopper”), Sasheer Zamata (“Saturday Night Live”), Ali Ahn (“The Diplomat”) and Miles Gutierrez-Riley (“The Wilds”) will costar, with Debra Jo Rupp and Emma Caulfield Ford reprising their roles from “WandaVision.”\n\nMCU Tie-In: Unclear, but Agatha’s connection to Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) certainly seems to provide ample storytelling possibilities, especially since, when we last saw Agatha, she’d been trapped by Wanda in her sitcom persona of Agnes, the quintessential sitcom nosy neighbor. A second “WandaVision” spin-off focusing on Paul Bettany’s Vision is also in development (more on that series below).\n\nOn Disney+\n\nUnlike the smooth, modern look of “What If…?”, this animated show will harken back to Peter Parker’s comic book origins as he begins his journey to become Spider-Man.\n\nThis version of Peter’s life will feature a bunch of new characters, including Nico Minoru, from the Runaways team; a new crush who isn’t Mary Jane or Gwen Stacey; Amadeus Cho, who becomes a new Hulk in the comics; a Wakandan exchange student; and Harry Osborn, with Harry’s father Norman serving as Peter’s mentor. (Well, at first, anyway.)\n\nCharlie Cox will be voicing the role of Daredevil, and Doctor Strange will appear as well (though it’s unclear if Benedict Cumberbatch will voice that role). Paul F. Tompkins will voice a new character named Bentley Witman.\n\nWe’ll also see some classic Spidey villains, including Unicorn, Chameleon, Scorpion, Speed Demon, Tarantula, Rhino, Butane and Doc Ock.\n\nJeff Trammel (Cartoon Network’s “Craig of the Creek”) is the head writer and executive producer.\n\nSeason 2 is also in the works.\n\nMCU Tie-In: Early press materials had indicated that this show is a prequel to the Tom Holland storyline in the MCU, but details unveiled at San Diego Comic-Con 2022 — like the appearance of Harry and Norman Osborn — threw cold water on that idea. So: multiverse!\n\nIn Theaters\n\nThe new Captain America, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), fights the good fight without the support of the Avengers, who disbanded in the wake of “Endgame.” Also returning from “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” are Carl Lumbly as Isaiah Bradley, a.k.a. the first Black supersoldier (who told Sam in “FAWS” that the U.S. would never accept a Black Captain America), and Danny Ramirez as Joaquín Torres, who inherits the Falcon moniker from Sam. Shira Haas (“Unorthodox”) joins the cast as Ruth Bat-Seraph, a.k.a. Sabra. In the comics, Sabra is a mutant who works as an agent of the Israeli Mossad, but a spokesperson for Marvel tells Variety that the filmmakers are taking “a new approach” with the character.\n\nJulius Onah (“Luce,” “The Cloverfield Paradox”) is directing from a screenplay by “FAWS” head writer Malcolm Spellman and staff writer Dalan Musson, with Matthew Orton (“Moon Knight”) writing material for additional photography in 2024.\n\nThe film was originally subtitled “New World Order,” but Disney announced it was changed to “Brave New World” in June 2023. While main photography concluded before the SAG-AFTRA strike, Disney pushed the film from a May 2024 release to Feb. 2025.\n\nMCU Tie-In: Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, will appear as the president of the United States in “Brave New World” — played by Harrison Ford, replacing the late actor William Hurt, who originated the role in 2008’s “The Incredible Hulk” and played it several times, most recently in 2021’s “Black Widow.” As the first trailer all but confirmed, Ross will also transform into the Red Hulk.\n\nAnother character who began in “The Incredible Hulk” is also returning: Tim Blake Nelson will play Samuel Sterns, a.k.a. The Leader. In that film, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) forces Samuel to use blood samples from Bruce Banner (played by Edward Norton) to transform Emil into the Abomination. In the aftermath, some of Bruce’s blood lands on an open wound on Emil’s skull, transforming him into The Leader. Seventeen years later, we’ll finally see what happened next for Samuel.\n\nThe Leader and Ross may not be the only MCU legacy characters to return for “Brave New World,” especially since the anti-hero team-up movie “Thunderbolts” is set to follow later in 2025, which features disgraced former Captain America John Walker (Wyatt Russell), a.k.a. U.S. Agent, and the shadowy operative Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) — two characters first introduced on “FAWS.” And then there’s the post-credits tease for “FAWS,” in which Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) revealed herself to be the nefarious Power Broker just as she’s pardoned and brought back into the U.S. government — what’s to become of her?\n\nOn Disney+\n\nAfter “Daredevil” ran for three seasons on Netflix through 2018, Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) faded back into the shadows once the streamer cut ties with Marvel in advance of the debut of Disney+. After Murdock popped up as Peter Parker’s lawyer in 2021’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home” — and his nemesis, Kingpin (Vincent D’Onofrio), reemerged the same month as the lead villain on “Hawkeye” — there was a great deal of anticipation that the Man Without Fear would return to fight crime again.\n\nIn May 2022, Variety reported that Matt Corman and Chris Ord (“Covert Affairs”) signed up to write and executive produce a new “Daredevil” series, which Feige announced will unfold over 18 episodes — triple the usual number for a drama series in the MCU.\n\nSince then, the show underwent a significant creative overhaul: Corman and Ord exited the series midway through production, and Dario Scardapane (“The Punisher”) stepped in as the new showrunner. Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead (“Loki,” “Hawkeye”) will direct the bulk of the episodes of Season 1, which will most likely not consist of all 18 episodes.\n\nMCU Tie-In: Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and especially Maya Lopez (Alaqua Cox) have a complicated relationship with Kingpin, so either of those characters could factor on the show. Matt’s burgeoning relationship with Jennifer Walters (Tatiana Maslany), a.k.a. the title hero of “She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,” could also wind up on the show (though that seems like much more of a stretch).\n\nThe big question, however, has been if the events of Netflix’s “Daredevil” are part of the MCU and would be incorporated into “Daredevil: Born Again.” For years, Marvel Studios was publicly coy, and privately dismissive, about whether it would be integrating the Netflix shows into its storytelling. But in Jan. 2024, Marvel executive Brad Winderbaum told Screen Rant that he was “confident” that the Netflix series was part of “the sacred timeline” — i.e., the main MCU — which means Jon Bernthal’s Frank Castle (aka the Punisher) will be bringing all of his Netflix baggage with him when he appears on “Born Again.” Whether any of the other Netflix Marvel characters — including Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Mike Colter (Luke Cage) or Danny Rand aka Iron Fist (Finn Jones) — will also return remains to be seen.\n\nIn Theaters\n\nMarvel Studios’ answer to DC’s Suicide Squad, “Thunderbolts” is a team of anti-heroes — or reformed villains, depending on your point of view — who are formed at first to do bad but then decide to try to make up for the errors of their ways.\n\nJake Schreier (“Paper Towns”) will direct from a script by Eric Pearson (“Black Widow”). The team will include Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes (aka the Winter Soldier) from “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” and “Captain America: The Winter Soldier”; Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova from “Black Widow” and “Hawkeye”; David Harbour as Alexei Shostakov (aka Red Guardian) from “Black Widow”; Wyatt Russell as John Walker (aka U.S. Agent) from “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier”; Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr (aka Ghost) from “Ant-Man and the Wasp”; Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster from “Black Widow”; and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine from “Falcon and Winter Soldier,” “Black Widow” and “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.”\n\n“Thunderbolts” was originally set to open in late 2024, until the SAG-AFTRA strike delayed production and pushed its release to 2025.\n\nAt CinemaCon in 2024, Kevin Feige revealed that the title to the film includes an asterisk, and then teased that Marvel “won’t talk more about that until after the movie comes out.”\n\nMCU Tie-In: All of these characters carry a lot of baggage with them from their earlier appearances, which will no doubt factor into whatever transpires in “Thunderbolts.” With “Captain America: New World Order” opening a few months earlier, one also expects Sam Wilson, aka Captain America (Anthony Mackie), could play some kind of role here. And given that Baron Zemo (Daniel Brühl) is a major character in the Thunderbolts in the comics, he could pop up as well.\n\nIn Theaters\n\nWhen Disney bought 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios), Marvel fans knew it would mean that the X-Men and the Fantastic Four — the two classic Marvel franchises that had heretofore existed outside the MCU — would finally join the fold.\n\nMatt Shakman (“WandaVision”) will direct the film. He took over from “Spider-Man” filmmaker Jon Watts, who was originally announced as the director by Feige in December 2020, but backed out of the project in April 2022, citing superhero cinema fatigue.\n\nIn November 2023, news leaked that Marvel was eyeing Pedro Pascal to play Reed Richards, aka Mr. Fantastic. Four months later, the studio officially announced the full foursome: Pascal, Vanessa Kirby (as Sue Storm, aka Invisible Woman), Joseph Quinn (as Johnny Storm, aka the Human Torch) and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (as Ben Grimm, aka Thing).\n\nJulia Garner (“Ozark”) will play Shalla-Bal, a variant of the Silver Surfer, and Ralph Ineson (“The Witch”) will play the main antagonist, Galactus. John Malkovich, Paul Walter Hauser and Natasha Lyonne will costar.\n\nMCU Tie-In: Unclear, especially since this film will be set in an alternate universe from the Sacred Timeline. But in the comics, the Fantastic Four play a critical role in the “Secret Wars” series, and Victor von Doom is their main enemy, so they’re sure to play a part in “Avengers: Doomsday.”\n\nIn Theaters\n\nIn the same way that “Avengers: Infinity War” led into “Avengers: Endgame,” “Doomsday” will lead into “Secret Wars,” with Robert Downey Jr. returning to the MCU to play Dr. Victor von Doom, easily the biggest, most important villain in the Marvel comics universe. The directors and one of the screenwriters of “Infinity War” and “Endgame” — Joe and Anthony Russo, and Stephen McFeely — are also returning to Marvel to direct and write “Doomsday” and “Secret Wars.”\n\nGetting to this point has been bumpy in the extreme. This project was originally titled “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty,” with Jonathan Majors playing the titular main villain, Destin Daniel Cretton (“Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings”) directing, and Jeff Loveness (“Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania”) and then Michael Waldron (“Loki”) writing. By the time Marvel parted ways with Majors hours after the actor’s conviction in December 2023 for misdemeanor assault and harassment, the original conception of the project was all but cooked.\n\nMCU Tie-In: Given Doom’s main adversaries are the Fantastic Four, it’s safe to assume they will play a significant role in “Doomsday.”\n\nIn Theaters\n\nIn 2015, Marvel Comics published a nearly year-long miniseries called “Secret Wars,” in which an incursion between the main Marvel universe (Earth-616) and the Ultimate Marvel universe (Earth-1610) caused the destruction of both. Afterwards, many variants of Marvel characters find themselves living on a post-apocalyptic planet called Battleworld.\n\nHow the MCU will get to this point (if this is indeed the plot of the movie) remains something of a mystery, although several major players in the comic book storyline — including the Fantastic Four (Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach) and their mortal enemy Victor von Doom (Robert Downey Jr.) — are now set to make their debuts in the MCU in the run up to this film and its predecessor, “Avengers: Doomsday.” Joe and Anthony Russo will direct both films, and Stephen McFeely will handle the the screenplay.\n\nSomething else to consider: Following “Secret Wars,” Marvel Comics more-or-less rebooted, launching “all-new, all-different” versions of many of its most beloved titles. Most curious, indeed.\n\nMCU Tie-In: Given its storyline and placement at the end of the Multiverse Saga, expect all of the characters to show up in this one.\n\nIn Theaters\n\nBack when he was making the Marvel series “Luke Cage” for Netflix, Mahershala Ali made it known to Marvel Studios that he wanted to star in a remake of “Blade,” the superhero franchise about the sword-wielding half-vampire first headlined by Wesley Snipes (and credited by many for paving the way for the superhero cinema renaissance). Marvel, smartly, said yes.\n\nSince then, however, two directors — Bassam Tariq (“Mogul Mowgli”) and Yann Demange (“Lovecraft Country”) — have departed the film and at least six screenwriters have been tapped to write the screenplay. The bumpy development process has pushed “Blade” back twice — from 2023 to 2024, then again to 2025, and finally off the release calendar entirely until the script gets to the right place.\n\nMCU Tie-In: Unclear, but Ali did make an audio-only cameo in one of the post-credits scenes in “Eternals” with Kit Harington’s Dane Whitman.\n\nOn Disney+\n\nPretty much everything you need to know about this animated series is right there in the title: A zombie apocalypse causes most of the Avengers to turn into super-powered, flesh-craving undead. The title comes from the 2005-2006 comic book mini-series written by, who else, “The Walking Dead” creator Robert Kirkman, with art by Sean Phillips; those comics were already loosely adapted on an episode of the first season of “What If…?”\n\nThis series will feature zombie versions of Clint Barton, Captain Marvel, Captain America (cut in half), the Abomination from “The Incredible Hulk” and “Shang-Chi,” Ghost from “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” Scarlet Witch, Okoye from “Black Panther” and Ikaris from “Eternals.” Taking them on will be Yelena Belova and Red Guardian (along with a team of Widows) from “Black Widow,” Shang-Chi and his BFF Katy, Kate Bishop from “Hawkeye,” Jimmy Woo from “Ant-Man and the Wasp” and “WandaVision,” Death Dealer from “Shang-Chi,” Ms. Marvel, and a biker gang of Skrulls from “Captain Marvel.”\n\n“What If…?” director Bryan Andrews is also directing this show, with Zeb Wells (“Robot Chicken”) serving as head writer and executive producer.\n\nMCU Tie-In: Unclear.\n\nAll Episodes on Disney+ and Hulu\n\nAs Variety first reported in March 2021, Alaqua Cox stars in this “Hawkeye” spin-off series as Maya Lopez, a deaf Native American who works as an enforcer for the New York crime boss Wilson “Kingpin” Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio). The show is the first standalone superhero series about a Native American character.\n\nAs such, the central cast of the series is made up of indigenous actors, including Zahn McClarnon (“Reservation Dogs”), reprising his role as Maya’s father, and Native American acting legend Graham Greene (“Dances With Wolves,” “Wind River,” “1883”). Also among the cast: Chaske Spencer (“Wild Indian”), Tantoo Cardinal (“Killers of the Flower Moon”), Devery Jacobs (“Reservation Dogs”) and Cody Lightning (“Hey, Viktor!”).\n\nSydney Freeland (“Reservation Dogs,” “Star Trek: Strange New Worlds”) and Catriona McKenzie (“The Walking Dead,” “Shining Vale”) direct.\n\nIn a first for Marvel, all five episodes of the show will premiere at the same time. The show is also Marvel’s first to debut simultaneously on Hulu and Disney+, and to be rated TV-MA.\n\nMCU Tie-In: Kingpin first wreaked havoc on Netflix’s “Daredevil” series and reemerged in December 2021 on the Disney+ series “Hawkeye.” His nemesis, Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil (Charlie Cox), also shows up on the series, after first popping up in “Spider-Man: No Way Home” and on “She-Hulk: Attorney at Law.”\n\nAll Episodes on Disney+\n\nWith the 20th Century Fox “X-Men” movies dead and gone following Disney’s acquisition of the studio, many fans thought Marvel Studios would first reboot the mutant superheroes in a series of live-action films or TV series.\n\nInstead, Marvel revived the seminal Saturday morning “X-Men” animated series, which ran for five seasons from 1992 through 1997 and is widely considered to be the reason Fox decided to make a live-action “X-Men” movie. The series updates the story from the original series, focusing on the mutants Rogue, Beast, Gambit, Jean Grey, Wolverine, Storm, Jubilee and Cyclops; they’ll be led by Magneto, sporting long hair and a purple suit. (On the original series finale, Prof. Charles Xavier is forced to leave Earth to be cured after a crippling attack.)\n\nThe X-Men are joined on the show by Cable, Bishop, Forge, Morph and Nightcrawler. Mr. Sinister, Bolivar Trask, Emma Frost and Sebastian Shaw also appear.\n\nBeau DeMayo (Netflix’s “The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf”) is the head writer.\n\nMCU Tie-In: With the multiverse in full bloom, “X-Men ’97” didn’t link up with any of the MCU, a distinction further emphasized with the introduction of “Marvel Animation” logo at the opening of ever episode. But Marvel also has “Deadpool & Wolverine” in later 2024, so who knows what self-aware shenanigans may be afoot.\n\nCurrently Playing In Theaters\n\nWhile Fox’s “X-Men” movies officially ended with the twin flops of “Dark Phoenix” and “The New Mutants” prior to the sale to Disney, the two “Deadpool” spin-off films remain the most financially successful “X-Men” movies ever made, earning $1.57 billion combined. That’s enough cash to convince Disney and Marvel Studios to make their first R-rated superhero movie, and their first movie starring a character from the Fox era.\n\nIn March 2022, Reynolds announced that regular collaborator Shawn Levy (“Free Guy,” “The Adam Project”) will direct the film, with “Deadpool” screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick writing it. Later that year, Reynolds revealed that Hugh Jackman will return as Wolverine again — though, based on his costuming, perhaps not the version of Wolverine he retired in 2017’s “Logan.”\n\nMCU Tie-In: In the teaser, Wade Wilson is captured by the Time Variance Authority from “Loki,” where he meets an official played by Matthew Macfadyen, who shows him a bunch of clips from, well, the MCU. The presence of the TVA implies that any Marvel variant from the Fox era could show up in “Deadpool & Wolverine,” suggesting that this film could do for the Fox Marvel era what “Spider-Man: No Way Home” did for the Sony Marvel era."
