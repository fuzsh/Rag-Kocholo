Behind the Scenes Trivia

Locker check

In the scene when Buffy and Giles are checking in the morgue lockers for vampires, the items in the background change (light, scale, vent, etc.) but the angle of the wall in the background doesn’t. They obviously kept the camera in the same place for each shot.

Cordelia sees Angel: "Hello, salty goodness."

Buffy: "If the apocalypse comes, beep me."

Buffy: "See, this is a school, and we have students, and they check out books, and then they learn things."

Giles: "I was beginning to suspect that was a myth."

Giles: "Alright, I-I'll just jump in my time machine, go back to the twelfth century and ask the vampires to postpone their ancient prophecy for a few days while you take in dinner and a show."

Buffy: "Okay, at this point you're abusing sarcasm."

Giles: "If your identity as the Slayer is revealed it could put you and all those around you in grave danger.

Buffy: Well, in that case I won't wear my button that says, 'I'm the Slayer, ask me how!'"

Angel: "You're here on a date?"

Buffy: "Yes! Why is it such a shock to everyone?"

Giles: "Uh, two more of the brethren came in here. They came after me. But I was more than a match for them."

Buffy: "Meaning?"

Giles: "I hid."

Giles: "Buffy, when I said you could slay vampires and have a social life, I didn't mean at the same time. "
