        "text": "There has been buzz about rift in the Bachchan parivaar\n\nAishwarya Rai Bachchan's issues with her mother-in-law Jaya Bachchan came to the fore front last year at Ambani's party in Juhu. However the latest buzz doing rounds is that the young Bachchan couple - Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek are now heading for divorce! It seems that all's not well between the blue-eyed couple of Bollywood. This isn't the first time that reports of problem in the Abhi-Ash marriage has made headlines. So will Aishwarya and Abhishek like Hrithik Roshan and Sussanne Khan announce their separation?Abhishek Bachchan has often accompanied his wifey to Cannes Film Festival, while he missed traveling last year and instead we spotted Aaradhya Bachchan being closely guarded by mommy and security, this time too Ash is going solo. Is there indeed trouble in the Bachchan paradise. The family has kept their personal life extremely guarded. Aishwarya has in fact remained away from the limelight and shutter bugs ever since she became a mommy. And with reports of her comeback making headlines, the latest news will certainly make Abhi-Ash fans sad.\n\nAccording to a leading daily, \"Like the Gandhi's in Politics we have the Bachchan's in Bollywood. You can criticize them, you can loathe them, but you can't ignore them. Everything seems to be going very smoothly in this royal family but looks can be deceptive.\" They suggest that Aishwaryaand Abhishek may get divorced soon.\n\nThe couple has been married seven years now and we hope like in the past this matter is resolved and the couple continue to live happily ever after!"
