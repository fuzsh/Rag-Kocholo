        "text": "Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan have been the most talked about couple in Bollywood. Their love story was no less than a fairy tale. They met during a photoshoot of Dhai Akshar Prem Ke in 1999 and became friends. The friendship then went ahead and on the sets of Umrao Jaan in 2006, he realised his feelings and proposed Aishwarya Rai. They got married in 2007 and it was a royal wedding. They had the most beautiful love story and they also welcomed their first child in 2011. Aaradhya Bachchan is a reflection of her parents. We have seen her sharing a good bond with the entire family. She is also close to Aishwarya's parents.\n\nTop TV News and Entertainment News are easily available, follow BollywoodLife on WhatsApp.\n\nAishwarya and Abhishek will not get separated?\n\nHowever, there have been reports of issues between this beautiful paradise. It has been said that Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan are about to get separated. There have been stories about things not being well between them. They have also been appearing separately for events. Recently, they did not attend Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's wedding together.\n\nThis made everyone believe that they are not staying together. Some reports on the internet also say that they are getting divorced soon. However, the latest reports in DNA state that the divorce will not happen. One of the strongest reason for this is that there has never been a single divorce in the Bachchan family.\n\nThis is reportedly one of the big reasons that despite their rift, they will not get separated. We have seen earlier that when Abhishek and Karisma Kapoor's engagement was called off, there were issues between Shweta Bachchan and her husband Nikhil Nanda.\n\nHere's a video on Aishwarya and Abhishek\n\nNikhil Nanda was related to Karisma and hence the issues cropped up. But still, they did not get divorced. Similarly, there have been many reports of issues between Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan as well. But even they did not get separated.\n\nStay tuned to BollywoodLife for the latest scoops and updates from Bollywood, Hollywood, South, TV and Web-Series."
