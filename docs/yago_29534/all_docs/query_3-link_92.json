        "text": "When Abhishek Bachchan had first met Miss World, Aishwarya Rai in Switzerland during the shooting of her film, Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya, he was smitten by her beauty, just like all of us. However, Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai had never thought that from being co-stars they will end up tying the knot and creating their own 'happily ever after'. While Aishwarya is the synonym of beauty and grace, Abhishek is known for his wits and amazing acting skills. Together, this beautiful union have been making our hearts flutter since 2007.\n\nWe all will agree that everyone was waiting with popeyed to see a glimpse of Bollywood superstar, Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan's son, Abhishek Bachchan's fairytale wedding with the world beauty, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. The duo has given us 'Couple Goals' when we had no idea about it.\n\nAishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan's past relationship\n\nBefore Abhishek Bachchan had found love in Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, the duo had quite a few linkups and relations. And their past relationships are still etched in the heart and mind of their millions of fans.\n\nAishwarya Rai's relationship with Salman Khan\n\nAishwarya Rai with Salman Khan\n\nAishwarya Rai and Salman Khan's relationship was one of the hottest topics in the late 1990s. They were the 'it' couple back then, but destiny had other plans and they had parted ways in 2002. The breakup was an ugly one and it had affected Aishwarya's goodwill in the industry, and she had lost many projects because of it and Salman Khan's influence (reportedly).\n\nAishwarya Rai's rumoured relationship with Vivek Oberoi\n\nAishwarya Rai with Vivek Oberoi\n\nVivek Oberoi had reportedly dated Aishwarya Rai in the early 2000s, but they had soon parted ways on a bitter note. And in 2009, Vivek had finally opened up about his breakup on Farah Khan's show, Tere Mere Beech Mein, wherein, he had confessed how he held the infamous press conference against Salman Khan to please Aishwarya.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan's relationship with Karisma Kapoor\n\nIn the '90s, Abhishek Bachchan and Karisma Kapoor were considered the 'it' couple. The duo was about to get married. In fact, we still remember how Jaya Bachchan had introduced Karisma as her future daughter-in-law during a press conference. However, soon the engagement was called off and no one knows the actual reason for it. Abhishek Bachchan and Karisma Kapoor had met each other at the former's sister, Shweta Bachchan's wedding in 1997.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai's first meeting\n\nAbhishek Bachchan had first met his ladylove, Aishwarya Rai in Switzerland. He was in the country for the location recce of a film, which his father, Amitabh Bachchan was making. Abhishek had narrated his first meeting to YouTuber, Ranveer Allahbadia for his podcast and had shared:\n\n\"I first met her when I was a production boy. There was a film my father was making called Mrityudata, and I had gone for the location recce to Switzerland because the company felt that because I had grown up in Switzerland in boarding school that I would be able to take them to nice locations. I had been there for a couple of days, all alone. And that's when a childhood friend of mine, Bobby Deol, was shooting for his first film -- Aur Pyar Ho Gaya. And he got to know I was there and said 'Hey, why don't you come over for dinner?' And that's the first time when they were shooting when I met Aishwarya.\"\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai's magical love story – From co-stars to soulmates\n\nNo one knows how love blossomed between Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai. But there are some, who say that the sparks of love ignited between the two while shooting for the item song, Kajra Re, on the sets of Bunty Aur Babli (2005). However, it was in 2006-2007, when they had gotten a lot of time to spend together as they were shooting three films, Umrao Jaan, Guru and Dhoom 2. It was especially during the year and a half shooting period of Dhoom 2, when they had started developing feelings towards each other. Aishwarya's uncomplicated nature and smiling face just made Abhishek weak in his knees.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan proposed Aishwarya Rai in a filmy way in 2007\n\nIt was after the premiere of the film, Guru, in Toronto, when Abhishek Bachchan had proposed to Aishwarya Rai in New York, and she had immediately accepted his proposal. Abhishek had shared the details to Oprah Winfrey in the couple's first interview post their wedding. He had said:\n\n\"I was filming in New York for a movie. And, I used to stand on the balcony of my hotel room and wish that, 'One day, wouldn't it be nice if I was together with her, married.' Years later, we were there for the premiere of Guru. After the premiere, we were back in the hotel. So, I took her to the very same balcony, and I asked her to marry me.\"\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's with Oprah Winfrey in 2009\n\nHowever, not many know Abhishek’s dream proposal was sans a sparking ring, but a prop from the sets of their film, Guru. It was the same ring that he had proposed Aishwarya in Mani Ratnam's film. In fact, he had asked the producer if he could keep the ring, for sentimental reasons. In a 2010 interview with a magazine, Aishwarya had opened up on the same and had shared:\n\n\"He is original and real, like our relationship. There is nothing predictable or boring about our life. We nurture each other. The gesture was spontaneous and meaningful. God has been kind to us. We can certainly afford those standard rocks. But do we need them?\"\n\nAlso Read: When Abhishek Bachchan Gave Savage Reaction To A Fan, Who Expressed His Wish To Marry Aishwarya Rai\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai’s hush-hush engagement\n\nAfter the formal proposal, Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai were back in Mumbai and had gotten engaged on January 14, 2007, at the Bachchan's residence. After that, both the actors became a little more open about their relationship. They were even spotted going to the movies and nightclubs together. Aishwarya had also started visiting the Bachchans more often.\n\nThe troubles Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan had faced before the wedding\n\nIt is said that every story has its own ups and downs, and Abhishek and Aishwarya's love story was no different. There were a few turbulences that came their way before they had tied the knot. However, the biggest was the news of Aishwarya having a manglik dosh in her kundali (it is an astrological birth chart). Hence, she was first required to marry a tree to get rid of the manglik dosh. As regressive as that may sound, those were the stories pouring out during their wedding. A famous Brahmin Vedic had said:\n\n\"Aishwarya will have to marry either a peepal or banana tree or with an idol of Lord Vishnu (of gold or silver), in case she is manglik. Kumbh Vivah (the ritual of marrying tree to ward off evil effects of being manglik) is performed for manglik girls to ward off ill effects.\"\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai's beautiful wedding\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's wedding\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's wedding is still considered a fairytale affair. We all remember sitting in front of our television screens during those times and hoping to get a glimpse of the bride and the groom. Their wedding had become the 'wedding of the decade' without social media and hashtags. It was on April 20, 2007, when Aishwarya and Abhishek had exchanged the wedding vows and had left the entire nation starry-eyed. Every time, we get a glimpse of the duo together, our heart rushes a beat and we crave love like 'Abhi-Aish'.\n\nAishwarya Rai's 75 lakh worth wedding saree\n\nOn the wedding day, Aishwarya was looking gorgeous as a South-Indian bride. She had opted for a beautiful golden Kanjeevaram saree and her traditional jewellery had added more charm to her look. The gorgeous ensemble was made by fashion designer, Neeta Lulla, and the saree had a beautiful gold border. The saree had real gold-thread work and had a lot of crystals on it. And the price of the saree was Rs 75 Lakh, and it was one of the most expensive sarees ever.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan's wedding look\n\nAbhishek had complemented Aishwarya in a white sherwani with real-gold work on it. However, it is the choice of jewellery that had made his look complete and on point.\n\nAishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan's honeymoon\n\nAfter Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's grand wedding, the duo had jetted off for a month-long honeymoon in Europe. In a media interaction, Aishwarya had revealed that when an air-hostess had called her Mrs Bachchan, she had felt that she is finally married. She had said:\n\n\"The stewardess welcomed me on board saying, 'Welcome, Mrs Bachchan.' And Abhishek and I just looked at each other and burst out laughing! And it hit me, I'm married! I'm Mrs Bachchan!\"\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's age difference\n\nAishwarya Rai Bachchan is three years older than Abhishek Bachchan. However, the age difference never became a problem between the two. In fact, their bond grew stronger with the passing of years. Today, after so many years of togetherness, they both still love each other immensely. Aishwarya had said in one of her interviews:\n\n\"Abhishek is my source of inspiration. He is always so supportive. Whenever I am confused and don't know what to do, I look at him and he solves the duality in me like magic. He is the real 'Padma Shri' and I'm his 'Padma Shrimati'.\"\n\nOn the other hand, this is what Abhishek thinks about his ladylove, which he had revealed during a media interaction:\n\n\"Aishwarya is my anchor. She is my buddy, my closest friend. I can discuss anything with her. Our relationship is not based on her being Aishwarya Rai or me coming from an illustrious family. It is just about two people falling in love which has organically grown. We started during Guru. It was meant to be.\"\n\nAlso Read: When Abhishek Bachchan Revealed Why He Has Never Kissed Wifey, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan On Screen\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's daughter, Aaradhya Bachchan\n\nOn November 16, 2011, Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan had welcomed their daughter, Aaradhya Bachchan, into the world.

I love her and you know I have always loved her.\" When Karan had asked her if Aishwarya is the perfect choice for the family, Jaya had stated, \"I think so, it is wonderful that she is such a big star herself. But when we are together, I have never seen her push herself and I like that quality.\"\n\nAishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan's net worth\n\nAbhishek and Aishwarya never leave any chance of showing their love for each other.
