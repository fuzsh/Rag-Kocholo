        "text": "Often regarded as the power couple of the film industry, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan hardly skip a moment to paint the town red with their mushy romance and cute PDAs on social media. Even after so many years of their happy married life, they still manage to give tons of couple goals to young lovers with the way they treat, love, care and support each other. However, do you know about the controversial incident when Jhanvi Kapoor had slit her wrist to stop Aishwarya and Abhishek’s wedding? If not. Scroll down to know it all!\n\nFor the unversed, on their wedding day, Aishwarya Rai had looked simply out of this world in her beautiful golden Kanjeevaram saree. The actress had teamed it up with some breathtaking traditional jewellery. On the other side, Abhishek Bachchan had complimented his ladylove in a white sherwani with real-gold work all over it. Even to this very day, Aishwarya and Abhishek’s wedding pictures hold something special that convinces us that they overshadow everyone else.\n\nRecommended Read: Nita Ambani Playing Dandiya With Anil Ambani At Isha’s Pre-Wedding Is All About ‘Bhabhi-Devar’ Bond\n\nRemaining Time -9:45\n\nIt was on April 20, 2007, when Abhishek Bachchan had got married to his ladylove, Aishwarya Rai, in an intimate wedding at his residence, Prateeksha. However, earlier on their D-day, while preparations for the couple’s wedding were in full throttle, a huge controversy was unfolding outside Bachchan’s residence, Prateeksha. A model named, Jhanvi Kapoor (Not to be mistaken with Sridevi’s daughter, Janhvi Kapoor) had created a major stir in the headlines after she claimed that Abhishek was already married to her. The shocking allegations broke the news channels in no time. Jhanvi had also tried to file a case against Abhishek at Juhu Police Station. But because of the lack of proof, it wasn’t registered by the police.\n\nWhile most people claimed it was a publicity stunt by the model, who had worked with Abhishek Bachchan in the film, Dus, the model kept accusing the actor of cheating, as she self-proclaimed that he was married to her. Initially, the protest from Jhanvi Kapoor was quite controlled, but after it was revealed that Abhishek Bachchan had denied all the allegations against him from the model stationed outside his home, she had opted for a bloody turn. Jhanvi had attempted suicide by cutting her wrist to prove her love for Abhishek.\n\nDon’t Miss: When Criminal Lawyer, Ram Jethmalani Kissed Dharmendra Passionately At His 91st Birthday Party\n\nAs soon as she had slit her wrist, Jhanvi Kapoor was taken to a nearby hospital. The model kept blaming Aishwarya Rai for stealing away her alleged husband, Abhishek, from her. However, soon Juhu Police Station charged the model with attempting suicide under Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nMoreover, she was soon released from police custody after paying a sum of Rs. 10,000. The controversial incident was overshadowed by Abhishek’s stunning wedding with his ladylove, Aishwarya Rai. After the couple’s marriage, Jhanvi Kapoor was never spotted outside their residence, nor had she made statements in the media.\n\nIt was on November 16, 2011, when Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan had embraced parenthood for the first time after they had welcomed a baby girl into their lives, whom they had named, Aaradhya Bachchan."
