        "text": "This is what the post said\n\nThe caption of the Instagram post that Abhishek liked further elaborated on the topic of divorce, stating, \"Divorce is never easy for anyone. Who doesn't dream of a happily ever after or envision recreating those heartwarming videos of elderly couples holding hands as they cross the street?\" This activity has added fuel to the rumors about his potential separation from Aishwarya, with whom he has been married since 2007.\n\nSeparate appearances at Anant-Radhika's wedding raised doubts\n\nRecently, at Anant Ambani-Radhika Merchant's wedding, Abhishek arrived with his father Amitabh Bachchan, mother Jaya Bachchan, sister Shweta Bachchan, brother-in-law Nikhil Nanda, niece Navya Nanda, and nephew Agastya Nanda. However, Aishwarya made her appearance separately with their daughter Aaradhya. Despite their separate arrivals, inside visuals from the event showed that the couple were seated together.\n\nWork: Couple's upcoming film projects"
