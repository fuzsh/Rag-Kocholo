        "text": "MUMBAI: Are they? Aren’t they? One social media post liked by Abhishek Bachchan has let netizens wonder if his marriage to Bollywood diva Aishwarya Rai has hit the doldrums.\n\nWhispers of a possible estrangement have floated on the Internet, ever since the power couple appeared less frequently at events and were often seen arriving separately. Earlier, AB Jr was also seen sans his wedding ring which triggered more speculations of separation. His wife was also seen attending the Anant Ambani-Radhika Merchant wedding with her daughter and sans him.\n\nThe ‘Bunty Aur Bali’ actor set tongues wagging as eagle-eyed netizens discovered that he liked a post highlighting the difficulties of a “grey divorce.”\n\nFor the uninitiated, “grey divorce” is a term for couples who seek separation after the age of 50.\n\nAuthor Heena Khandelwal shared a post featuring an image with the text, “When love stops being easy. Couples who have been married are now parting ways. What has prompted their decision and why are grey divorces on the rise?” The picture accompanied a caption discussing an article about the increasing number of divorce cases.\n\n‘Shogun,’ ‘The Bear’ lead nominees for TV’s Emmy Awards\n\nThe post goes on to elucidate the challenges of parting ways after spending decades together, building a life and a family. Separation in your twilight years is never easy.\n\n“Divorce is never easy for anyone. Who doesn’t dream of a happily ever after or envision recreating those heartwarming videos of elderly couples holding hands as they cross the street? Yet, sometimes life doesn’t unfold as we hoped. But how do people cope when they separate after decades together, after spending a significant portion of their lives relying on each other for both big and small things? What drives them to sever ties, and what challenges do they face? This story delves into these questions. Coincidentally, ‘grey divorces’ or ‘silver splitters’—terms for those seeking marital dissolution typically after age 50—are on the rise globally. The reasons, though varied, are not surprising,” the post read."
