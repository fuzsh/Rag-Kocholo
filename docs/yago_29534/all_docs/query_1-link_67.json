They have been having problems for years. Now matters have come to a head.” The report added a divorce between the couple is unlikely to happen in near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid this, an interview of the actress has gone viral when she awarded the Padma Shri back in 2009 and while talking about the honour, she spoke about her family and Abhishekâs support.\n\nShe Â said, âProfessionally what was wonderful was being bestowed with the Padma Shri. People from the fraternity said you are the youngest from the industry to have received it thus far. I owe it to my parents and I devote it to them. It was very special when my in-laws said we welcome the fifth Padma Shri into the family.â\n\nShe added, âI am blessed with the best husband in the world because it reflects on his strength that he can stand by his woman on a public platform at every given opportunity and applaud her.â\n\nhey are one of the most loved and adored couple in the industry but over the last few months, there have been multiple instances when people have observed troubles in their marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhenÂ Aishwarya Rai Bachchan Â cropped Shweta Bachchan\n\nThe occasion was Amitabh Bachchanâs 80th birthday bash. Shweta Bachchan took to her official Instagram handle and posted a photo where Amitabh Bachchan can be seen accompanied by his better half, Jaya Bachchan, and grandchildren, Aaradhya Bachchan, Navya Naveli Nandaand Agastya Nanda.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan Â sans his wedding ring\n\nAt a recent event, when the Refugee actor was spotted sans his wedding ring, a user on Reddit wrote how he has been attending public events and being clicked without his ring for quite some time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBig Bâ s cryptic tweet\n\nSharing a picture of himself, the star wrote- âT 4854 â everything said everything done .. so do the done and done the do.â"
