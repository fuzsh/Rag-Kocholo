        "text": "In Bollywood, every move a celebrity makes is closely watched by their fans and media. Recently, the personal lives of Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have become the talk of the town after they arrived separately at Ambani's wedding events. The couple, who have been married for over a decade and share a daughter, Aaradhya, are now in the news for some worrying reasons.\n\nIt all started when Abhishek Bachchan liked a post about divorce on social media. This small action caused a big stir, leading to many questions about his marriage with the former Miss World, Aishwarya Rai.\n\nFor years, Abhishek and Aishwarya have been seen as one of Bollywood's happiest couples. Their love story began on the sets of the movie Guru and has always been in the spotlight. They have always looked happy together, from their grand wedding in 2007 to their many public appearances. But now, things seem to be different.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C9hqYqwC9Fp/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\n\nAbhishek liked the post about the hardships and emotional pain of divorce. Celebrities often like various posts without thinking much about it, but fans and the media have taken this as a sign of trouble in their marriage. This has led to many rumours, with many wondering if the Bachchan family is heading for a separation. They have not been seen together in public as much as before. They even appeared separately at the recent Ambani wedding festivities, which was very unusual for them as a family.\n\nAbhishek, usually very private, has not said anything about these rumours, which has only made people talk more. Aishwarya, on the other hand, has also stayed silent. Some fans hope that these rumours are just thatâ€”rumours. But others believe there might be some truth to them.\n\nThere will surely be more news about this in the coming days. Fans are eagerly waiting for an official statement from the Bachchans. Until then, the rumours about Abhishek and Aishwarya's separation will keep making headlines, adding another dramatic chapter to the story of Bollywood's famous stars."
