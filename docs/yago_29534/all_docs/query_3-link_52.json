        "text": "Rumors are swirling about potential troubles in the marriage of Bollywood’s power couple, Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai. These speculations have been fueled by their recent solo appearances at public events and a particular action by Abhishek on social media that has caught the attention of many.\n\nThe buzz began when Abhishek liked an Instagram post discussing the increasing trend of ‘grey divorces’ or ‘silver splitters’—couples who part ways after many years of marriage. This action did not go unnoticed, and netizens quickly began to draw connections to his own marriage.\n\nHeena Khandelwal, the original poster, has since responded to the widespread media coverage generated by Abhishek’s interaction with her content. In her follow-up post, Heena expressed her delight at having her work noticed by Abhishek, stating, “I was elated when Abhishek liked the post. It is an achievement for any writer or journalist when their work is well-received.”\n\nHowever, Heena also shared her dismay over how much attention Abhishek’s single like had received, saying, “I am not familiar with his personal life, but it seems his single like on the post has been blown out of proportion. While he certainly doesn’t need me to defend him, I feel a bit disheartened that my Instagram story highlighting his like has contributed to this situation.”\n\nShe further noted that her story, titled “When Love Stops Being Easy,” which explores the experiences of couples who part ways after decades together, has resonated with many readers. “Many people, including those who did not like or comment on the post, have reached out to me to express their appreciation for both the story and its subject matter,” she added, emphasizing the positive reception her piece has received.\n\nMeanwhile, Aishwarya Rai has also fueled speculation about a possible rift with the Bachchan family. At the high-profile wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant, Aishwarya attended with her daughter Aaradhya, but noticeably without the rest of the Bachchan clan, who were present in full force. Additionally, she skipped a joint appearance with her father-in-law Amitabh Bachchan at the couple’s “shubh aashirwad” event the following day."
