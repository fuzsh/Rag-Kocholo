        "text": "Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have been married to for 16 years, and even have a daughter named Aaradhya. They are one of the most loved and adored couple in the industry but over the last few months, there have been multiple instances when people have observed troubles in their marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are the instances that only fueled the rumours\n\nWhen Aishwarya Rai Bachchan cropped Shweta Bachchan\n\nThe occasion was Amitabh Bachchanâs 80th birthday bash. Shweta Bachchan took to her official Instagram handle and posted a photo where Amitabh Bachchan can be seen accompanied by his better half, Jaya Bachchan, and grandchildren, Aaradhya Bachchan, Navya Naveli Nandaand Agastya Nanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShwetaâs post came just after Aishwarya Rai Bachchan dropped the same photograph on her social media account. However, she had cropped out Jaya Bachchan, Navya Naveli, and Agastya Nanda from the frame, focusing on only Big B and daughter Aaradhya. Posting the picture on the photo-sharing app, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan penned in the comment section, âAlwaysâ¦God Blesssss.â\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbhishek Bachchan sans his wedding ring\n\nAt a recent event, when the Refugee actor was spotted sans his wedding ring, a user on Reddit wrote how he has been attending public events and being clicked without his ring for quite some time.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan unfollows Aishwarya Rai\n\nThe Brahmastra actor, who follows a very small number of people, now doesnât follow Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, thus fanning rumours. While a section of users asserted that they never followed each other, a few others speculated that it could be Big Bâs privacy settings on his account that restricted people from seeing whom he follows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBig Bâ s cryptic tweet\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSharing a picture of himself, the star wrote- âT 4854 â everything said everything done .. so do the done and done the do.â"
