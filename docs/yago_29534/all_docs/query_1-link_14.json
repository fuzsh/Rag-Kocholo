        "text": "Renowned Indian astrologer Jagan Nath Guruji has predicted a potential separation between Bollywood stars Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, citing astrological reasons.\n\nJagan Nath Guruji, who has made predictions about many famous Bollywood couples, stated that according to astrology, the marriage between Abhishek and Aishwarya was not destined to last. However, their daughter Aaradhya’s love has kept the couple together.\n\nSpeculation about their separation has been rife in Indian media over the past year, but the couple has not commented on these rumours.\n\nThe rumours gained momentum when Abhishek attended a wedding with his parents, Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan, while Aishwarya and Aaradhya attended separately.\n\nFurther fuel was added when Abhishek liked a social media post about divorce, and Amitabh Bachchan unfollowed Aishwarya on social media.\n\nIn an interview with Indian media, Jagan Nath Guruji said, \"There are many aspects of their relationship that people do not know.\n\nAccording to astrology, their marriage was not meant to last, but their daughter's love has kept them together.\n\n\"The separation was evident in their horoscopes long ago, but both Abhishek and Aishwarya have made efforts to maintain their relationship despite the negative influences in their birth charts.\"\n\nGuruji predicted that due to various circumstances, Abhishek and Aishwarya might separate soon.\n\nAlthough he did not definitively say they would divorce, he indicated a higher likelihood of separation in the coming years due to a lack of love in their relationship.\n\nDespite this, he believes that respect and friendship will remain between them.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai got married in 2007, and their daughter Aaradhya was born in 2011."
