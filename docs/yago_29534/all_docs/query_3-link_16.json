        "text": "Bollywood actors Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan celebrated their 17th wedding anniversary on Saturday. Taking to social media, Aishwarya shared an adorable post which also featured her daughter Aaradhya. She added a heart emoji in the caption, to sum up her feelings.\n\nThe snaps show the family of three smiling from ear to ear as they pose for the lens at home. The adorable portrait shows Aishwarya flaunting bright red lips and highlighted strands. Aaradhya was seen ditching her signature bangs, replacing them with a side parting while Abhishek kept it casual with a white t-shirt.\n\nCheck out the snaps below!\n\nAlso read: Crazy fan encounter! Fan refuses to leave Atif Aslam on stage; escorted by security\n\nAbhishek and Aishwarya shared screen space in Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke (2000), Kuch Naa Kaho (2003), Dhoom 2 (2006), Umrao Jaan (2006), Guru (2007), Sarkar Raj (2008), and Raavan (2010).\n\nAbhishek was last seen in R Balki's 2023 film Ghoomer. He is currently gearing up for his next project with Shoojit Sircar and Be Happy on Amazon Prime Video. Aishwarya, on the other hand, was last seen in Mani Ratnam's Ponniyin Selvan: I and II.\n\nAlso read: Matty Healy unaffected by Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department, says his aunt\n\nThere has been a tonne of speculation surrounding Abhishek and Aishwarya's marriage. However, the couple has always refrained from commenting on the same. In January, Abhishek shared a post about failure which further sparked separation rumours. The post read, \"The fear of failing will destroy your dreams. Learning from failure will build your dreams.\"\n\nShweta Bachchan also shared a cryptic note in January without mentioning anyone. It read, \"Words are events, they do things, change things. They transform both speaker and hearer; they feed energy back and forth and amplify it. They feed understanding or emotion back and forth and amplify it.\""
