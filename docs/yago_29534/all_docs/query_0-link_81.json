        "text": "The media had banned the Bachchan Family for a long time\n\nWhen Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan got married way back in 2007, it was the wedding of the year. From top stars to politicians to Mumbai’s elite, people attended the functions. The Bachchan family went all out to ensure privacy of the couple and events. There were many rumours around the marriage, including that Aishwarya Rai Bachchan got married to a tree to end the influence of Mars on her marital chart. She was rumoured to be a Manglik.\n\nIn an interview to a digital channel, top paparazzi photographer Varinder Chawla has revealed how the Bachchan family went the extra mile to keep it private. The paps had gathered at vantage points outside his bungalow to get a sneak peek. But a bus had blocked their view. It seems the Bachchans made an entry to Prateeksha from their other bungalow. They had extra security provided by their BFF Amar Singh. When the paps got ahead of the barricade, they were manhandled by the security. This left the media fuming.\n\nHe said he had never seen such a big ban. The whole family was boycotted by the media. Varinder Chawla was quoted as saying to Hindi Rush, “When the Bachchan family would come for some events, photographers would place the camera down or up in the air as a sign of protest.”"
