        "text": "Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan celebrated their 14th wedding anniversary on April 20 this year. While the star couple tied the knot in 2007, their love story started way back in 1997 when the actor was still a production boy. In a recent interview, Abhishek revealed that it was Bobby Deol who first introduced him to Aishwarya. Bobby was shooting for his debut film Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya opposite Aishwarya in Switzerland where Abhishek had gone for a recce for Amitabh Bachchan's film Mrityudata.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWHAT DID ABHISHEK BACHCHAN SAY?\n\nDuring a recent podcast with YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia, Abhishek Bachchan revealed how he first met Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. He said that back then he was a production boy and Aishwarya was shooting for Bobby Deol's debut film Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya. When asked if he had a crush on her back then, Abhishek said, \"Who doesn't crush on her? I mean, come on, come on.\"\n\nRecalling his first meeting with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, the Guru actor said, \"I first met her when I was a production boy. There was a film my father was making called Mrityudata, and I had gone for the location recce to Switzerland, because the company felt that because I had grown up in Switzerland in boarding school that I would be able to take them to nice locations. I had been there for a couple of days, all alone. And that's when a childhood friend of mine, Bobby Deol, was shooting for his first film - Aur Pyar Ho Gaya. And he got to know I was there, and said 'Hey, why don't you come over for dinner?' And that's the first time, when they were shooting, when I met Aishwarya.\"\n\nHOW DID ABHISHEK-AISHWARYA CELEBRATE THEIR 14TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY?\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan celebrated their 14th wedding anniversary on April 20. Since the couple could not be together on their special day, as Abhishek is currently shooting in Lucknow, they made the most of the moment by chatting on a video call. Aishwarya shared a screenshot of her video call with Abhishek. Aaradhya Bachchan can also be seen in the picture. The Guru actress captioned the post with love-struck and heart-shaped emojis.\n\nTHE AISHWARYA-ABHISHEK LOVE STORY\n\nAishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan tied the knot on April 20, 2007. The couple started dating during the shooting of their film Umrao Jaan (2006). Abhishek finally proposed to Aishwarya in 2007 after the premiere of their film Guru in New York.\n\nIn an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Abhishek had revealed, “I was filming in New York for a movie, and I used to stand on my balcony of my hotel room and wish that one day wouldn't it be nice if I was together with [Aishwarya], married? So I took her to the very same balcony, and I asked her to marry me.”\n\nThe couple has worked together on films such as Dhai Akshar Prem Ke, Guru, Raavan, Sarkar Raaj, Umrao Jaan and Dhoom 2, among others. They were blessed with Aaradhya on November 16, 2011."
