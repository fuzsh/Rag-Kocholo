        "text": "Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai's separation rumours intensified after he liked a post on divorce. Their fans, however, are relieved after learning the real reason behind acknowledging the post,\n\nAbhishek Bachchan stirred up rumours of his split from his wife Aishwarya through his most recent social media post. The actor liked an Instagram post on divorce recently. The caption shared by author Heena Khandelwal read, “When love stops being easy. Couples who have been married are now parting ways. What has prompted their decision and why are grey divorces on the rise?” Aishwarya and Abhishek tied the knot in a traditional ceremony in 2007. The couple welcomed their daughter Aaradhya in November 2011.\n\nBut thanks to Reddit, a fact-check has emerged that clarified why Abhishek Bachchan liked the article about divorce. Aishwarya Rai’s close friend Dr Zirak Marker contributed to the article which is why Junior Bachchan acknowledged it, as per the website. For those who don’t know, Marker and Aishwarya starred in Farooq Sheikh’s legendary series ‘Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai‘ many years ago.\n\nHere’s Why Abhishek Bachchan Liked The Divorce Post\n\nThe real reason why Abhishek liked that IG post: Aishwarya’s longtime friend Zirak Marker contributed to the article.\n\nbyu/goldengirlsunehri inBollyBlindsNGossip\n\nThe Reddit post quickly went viral as Abhishek and Aishwarya’s fans sighed a relief. One of the users wrote, “So, this divorce post which people took as a confirmation of divorce is him being a supportive partner and therefore may be a confirmation of not being divorced.” Another user wrote, “This is funny and stupid of him at the same time lol, But wouldn’t it be very easy for them to state to refute the rumours and ask the media not to spread fake news? Especially since they were used to maintaining the perfect public image and clearing up any misunderstandings about them?”\n\nWho is Dr Zirak Marker, Aishwarya Rai’s Close Friend?\n\nZirak is a well-known psychiatrist and adult and pediatric psychoanalyst. He attended Jai Hind College in Mumbai with Aishwarya, thus their relationship dates back a long distance. She additionally released his book, Parenting in the Age of Anxiety, in 2016. Aishwarya, Abhishek, and their daughter Aaradhya Bachchan are frequently spotted on vacation with him and his spouse, parent coach Priya Marker.\n\nIn fact, Abhishek and Zirak follow each other on Instagram, assuming those stats are any indication of how to calculate real-life equations. Since Aishwarya isn’t on Instagram very often and only follows Abhishek.\n\nAishwarya Rai, Abhishek Bachchan Separation Rumours\n\nThe couple arrived separately at Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s recent wedding ceremony. As Aishwarya took pictures with Aaradhya, Abhishek posed with the Bachchans and Nanda family. Later on in the ceremony, Abhishek was spotted seated alongside Aishwarya and Aaradhya.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have shared the screen space in films like Guru, Dhoom 2, Raavan, Umrao Jaan, Kuch Naa Kaho, and Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke."
