The couple, who have been subject to various speculations, showcased a united front in numerous pictures and videos from the event.\n\nAishwarya, accompanied by her mother Brindya Rai, made a stylish entrance in a black and golden suit paired with heels and a matching bag. Abhishek Bachchan, flanked by his father Amitabh Bachchan and nephew Agastya Nanda, sported a navy blue shirt, matching pants, and sneakers. The family’s striking entrance put to rest any rumors of strained relations.\n\nAishwarya greeted attendees with smiles and waves as she stepped out of her car, joined by Abhishek, Amitabh, and Agastya. The couple engaged in conversation, displaying affectionate gestures, with Abhishek putting his arm around Aishwarya as they entered the school.\n\nReflecting on their family journey, Abhishek and Aishwarya tied the knot on April 20, 2007, in an intimate ceremony at Amitabh Bachchan’s residence, Prateeksha. Collaborating in films like “Guru” and “Dhoom 2,” the duo welcomed their first child, Aaradhya, on November 16, 2011.\n\nIn recent projects, Abhishek Bachchan featured in the movie “Ghoomer,” portraying a cricket mentor guiding a young cricketer played by Saiyami Kher. Aishwarya Rai garnered attention for her role in Mani Ratnam’s period drama film “Ponniyin Selvan – 2,” receiving overwhelming response. Aishwarya also made headlines for her glamorous appearance at Paris Fashion Week 2023."
