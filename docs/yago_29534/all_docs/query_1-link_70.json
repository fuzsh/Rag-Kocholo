        "text": "Actor Abhishek Bachchan sparked social media buzz after liking an Instagram post about divorce. The post, originally shared by an author, discussed the challenges of divorce. A user then captured a screenshot of Bachchan's like and shared it further on Reddit.\n\nThe post read, \"When love stops being easy\". Meanwhile, the caption read, \"Divorce is never easy for anyone. Who doesn’t dream of a happily ever after or envision recreating those heartwarming videos of elderly couples holding hands as they cross the street? Yet, sometimes life doesn’t unfold as we hoped. But how do people cope when they separate after decades together, after spending a significant portion of their lives relying on each other for both big and small things (sic)?\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nIt continues, \"What drives them to sever ties, and what challenges do they face? This story delves into these questions. Coincidentally, ‘grey divorces’ or ‘silver splitters’—terms for those seeking marital dissolution typically after age 50—are on the rise globally. The reasons, though varied, are not surprising (sic).\"\n\nSee the post here:\n\nAbhishek Bachchan, who is married to Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, reacted to the post by hitting the like button.\n\nSee his reaction here:\n\nRecently, Abhishek attended the wedding festivities of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant. While his wife Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and their daughter Aaradhya posed for the paparazzi together, Abhishek was seen with his parents. However, an inside video from the wedding ceremony showed Aishwarya and Aaradhya seated with Abhishek Bachchan.\n\nMeanwhile, on the work front, Abhishek Bachchan is expected to feature in Shah Rukh Khan's forthcoming film, tentatively titled King. His father, superstar Amitabh Bachchan, almost confirmed the reports by reposting a social media post by PeepingMoon, which claimed his role in SRK's film.\n\nSee the post here:\n\nIt was reported that Abhishek has been cast as the antagonist in 'King'. While details about his villainous role are kept under wraps, it is known that he will be portraying a complex character."
