        "text": "With their simultaneous presence at an event, B-town's power couple Abhishek Bachchan and his wife Aishwarya Rai appear to have put an end to any divorce whispers.\n\nThe pair attended the Dhirubhai Ambani International School Annual Day ceremony in Mumbai, where their daughter Aaradhya is a student. Aside from them, the whole Bachchan family attended the ceremony, including Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, and Agastya Nanda. Their photos and videos quickly became popular on social media and went global. Junior B donned a navy blue shirt with matching trousers and trainers, while Aishwarya looked elegant in a black and gold suit and shoes.\n\nAbhishek and Aishwarya married on April 20, 2007, in an intimate wedding ceremony. On November 16, 2011, they became the joyful parents of a girl, Aaradhya. Meanwhile, although Aishwarya was most recently seen in Mani Ratnam's magnum opus 'Ponniyin Selvan: II,' Abhishek received widespread recognition for his portrayal in the critically acclaimed sports drama film 'Ghoomer.'"
