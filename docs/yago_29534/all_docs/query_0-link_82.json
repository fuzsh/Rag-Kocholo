        "meta_description": "While the speculations around Aishwarya Rai's marriage with  Abhishek Bachchan continue, an old interview of the actress has cropped up on the internet. It is no secret that Ash was honoured with the prestigious Padma Shri in 2009 for her contribution to the entertainment industry. Soon after, the ‘Jodhaa Akbar’ actress had spoken about her in-laws’ reaction to her victory in an interview with the Verve magazine. Aishwarya had reportedly said, ‘Professionally what was wonderful was being bestowed with the Padma Shri. People from the fraternity said you are the youngest from the industry to have received it thus far. I owe it to my parents and I devote it to them. It was very special when my in-laws said we welcome the fifth Padma Shri into the family.’ Notably, Amitabh Bachchan’s father Harivansh Rai Bachchan, who was a Hindi poet, bagged the Padma Shri award in 1976, while Big B himself has received three such prestigious awards in his illustrious career. Jaya Bachchan received Padma Shri in the year 1992, and then Ash was the next one to bring the award to the Bachchan clan. She had even showered praises on her husband Abhishek Bachchan in the same interview as she said, ‘I am blessed with the best husband in the world because it reflects on his strength that he can stand by his woman on a public platform at every given opportunity and applaud her.’For more news and updates, stay tuned to ETimes.",
