        "text": "Reddit users provide insight into Bachchan's social media activity\n\nDr Marker, who has contributed to the article titled When Love Stops Being Easy, has reportedly been a longtime friend of Rai. Per reports, the child, adolescent, and family psychiatrist, Marker, even appeared with her on the show Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai with Farooq Sheikh many years ago. According to Redditors, Bachchan's \"like\" was likely due to this connection. Notably, Bachchan follows Marker on Instagram, while Rai does not.\n\nBachchan family, Rai's 'separate' appearance at Ambani wedding sparked rumors"
