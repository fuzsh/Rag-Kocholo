        "text": "Abhishek Bachchan tied the knot with the love of his life, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, in a traditional wedding in 2007. Since then, they have been together and are parents to a daughter, Aaradhya Bachchan. However, for a few months, netizens have been speculating that troubles hit the couple's marriage and that there's a rift between Jaya Bachchan and her daughter, Shweta Bachchan Nanda, with their bahu, Aishwarya.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAishwarya Bachchan stated when she is called the 'other woman' in Abhishek's life\n\nNow, we stumbled upon an old candid conversation between Abhishek Bachchan and his wife, Aishwarya Rai, along with Karan Johar on his popular reality show, Koffee With Karan. It was from the time when Abhishek and Aishwarya graced the show soon after tying the knot. During their conversation, the host of the show, known for his talent for digging truths from celebrities' lives, asked Abhishek Bachchan if he is ever gets torn between the three women in his life - his mother, Jaya Bachchan, his sister, Shweta Bachchan Nanda and his wife, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. Karan asked:\n\n“You feel Abhishek, at any point, you’ve been torn between the three women in your life? Because you know, you have the apple of Jaya aunty’s eyes and Shweta’s life and now you have another woman in your life. Have you ever felt that you need to juggle the act at all?”\n\nSuggested Read: When Natasa Stankovic Recalled Meeting Hardik Pandya For First Time At Nightclub, 'I Hadn't Seen...'\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nAbhishek Bachchan gave a witty reply when asked if he's torn between Aishwarya, Jaya and Shweta\n\nTo this, Aishwarya instantly said, “The only time the wife will be called the other woman.” However, Abhishek responded wittily and mentioned that all three women in his life should be given credit. Moreover, Abhishek wisely revealed the good bond between Aishwarya and Jaya, and added:\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"I think credit has to be given entirely to the girls. I have very little to do with it. What works also is that Maa and her (Aishwarya) are very close. They talk about everything. When a woman first comes to her husband’s house, she feels a bit out of place, evidently and obviously. I think the only person who can truly fill that void is her mother-in-law.”\n\nAbhishek Bachchan liked a post on 'divorce' rising speculations about his split with Aishwarya Rai\n\nA few days back, the internet went buzz when Abhishek liked a post on 'divorce' raising speculations about his split with Aishwarya. It was a post by an author, Heena Khandelwal, on IG, wherein she elaborately talked about divorce. The post featured a cover of an article/book about 'divorce', along with the title, \"When love stops being easy.\" In the caption of it, Heena also gave details about the hardship of separation, including how couples who had spent years of togetherness cope with parting ways with one another and how it would be so difficult for them to accept the change. The subhead under the headline of the article could be read as:\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Couples who have been married are now parting ways.
