        "text": "Bollywood’s famous couple, Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai, have been the subject of ongoing rumors, with speculations swirling on social media about a rift in their relationship.\n\nAmidst the news of a possible separation, a video has gone viral, allegedly announcing their divorce.\n\nIn the video, Abhishek Bachchan can be heard saying, “Aishwarya and I decided to separate in July.”\n\nHowever, Indian media has dismissed the video as ‘fake.’\n\nThe video reportedly suffers from lip-syncing issues and appears to have been created using artificial intelligence.\n\nUpon closer examination, it becomes evident that the lip-syncing in the video is flawed, and the manipulations are apparent.\n\nMore, Abhishek’s statements in the video are incomplete.\n\nThis is not the first time deepfake technology has been used against Bollywood celebrities. Actors like Aamir Khan, Ranveer Singh, Katrina Kaif, Kajol, and Rashmika Mandanna have also been targeted in similar ways.\n\nRumors about Abhishek and Aishwarya’s separation intensified after Abhishek Bachchan attended a public event, where photos surfaced on Instagram showing him without his wedding ring.\n\nInstead of the widespread rumors on mainstream and social media, neither Abhishek Bachchan nor Aishwarya Rai has issued any official statement addressing the divorce rumors."
