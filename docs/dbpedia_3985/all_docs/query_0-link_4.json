Umaiya b. ‘Amrd The date and the place of his birth are equally milmown and the only date we know for certain is thatpf his death, which occurred in Samarra in the year a.h. 245 (a.d. 869/860) in the reign of al-Mutawakkil All the sources agree about this date,^ some adding the month, Dhul-Hijja, and the day, namely the 23rd of this month.^ Ibn Habib belonged to the philological school of Baghdad, as shown by his nisha al-Ba^dadi ’’ generally given to him.^ He was considered to be a great scholar, well versed in all branches of Arabic learning, especially in poetry, history, genealogy, and grammar, of which the Mtdh al-muliahhar bears ample evidence. He was a pupil of Ibn al-A^rabi,^ Qutrub,^ Abu ‘Ubaida,® Abul-Yaqzan,^ and Ibn al-KelbiA This last fact is of outstanding importance with regard to the hitdh al-muhahhar, as Hi^am b. Muhammad al-Kelbi (or Ibn al-Kelbi, as he is usually called) and his father Muhammad b. as-Salb al-Kelbi are amongst the greatest authorities on the events of Arabian antiquity, on genealogy, and on customs of ^Q JdhiUya. Ibn al-Kelbi is the author of the JamJiamt al-ansdb, b, wovk unfortunately still unedited, of which Muhammad b. Habib is the rdwt^ As a matter of fact Ibn al-Kelbi’s name appears in the principal Isndd at the beginning of the Mtdb al-muJiabbar bearing witness ^ Fihrist, 106 ; YaqM, yU 47^, citing Fihrist. 2 See, for instance, Hajji Klial. ii, I284, 310^ ; v, 82g, 162io, etc, j v, 430^,, the date is omitted, a gap being left after 4;^. ® Ibn.

The trend of his interest may be gathered from the titles of his works, of which only few survive and only one so far has been edited.^ We find among them works concerned more or less only (as far as one can guess from the titles) with the philological aspect of the subject, or which seem at least to have been arranged and collected from this point of view, as, for instance, such titles as J^l Jc* or would suggest.

The only work in tke list concerned at all with Hadith is the philological study on the uncommon expressions in the Hadi& : aJ-I mentioiied above. We shall see the same fact in the Utah al-muhabbar which, although deal- ing to a great extent with facts of Islamic history, is not in the least interested in theological questions or Qur'anic problems. Concluding from the arrangement of the hitdb ahmuJmbbar, where we find many lists arranged under various headings/ and from the titles of his works, we may suppose that most of his works were written for the sake of classifying and cataloguing his material in a systematical way. Among the Arabic scholars Muhammad b. Habib was w^ell knowm for accuracy and trustworthiness.^ He was renowned for his scholarship and knowledge in grammar as w^ell as in history and genealogy. There are, how^ever, two stories which contradict each other on this subject ; the first claiming his superiority even over his own teacher, Ibn al-x4.‘rabi, the other trying to diminish his fame. In the first instance Muhammad b. al-' Abbas al-Yazidi says that he had heard Ibn Habib boasting that he had asked his master Ibn al-A'rabi for the explanation of eighteen difficulties in poems of at-Tirimmah ; Ibn al-A‘rabi did not know how to explain one of them, saying each time : I don’t know, I don’t know.^ The second story tries to show Ibn Habib’s inferiority to ^adab : The latter relates that he went to Muhammad b. Habib’s lecture because he had heard that he was dictating the poems of Hassan b. Thabit. When Muhammad b. Habib realized his presence he stopped his dictation until Thadab had left, though the latter urged him to go on. As Muhammad b. ^ Yaq., loc. cit. ; Fihr., loc. cit., where should be inserted. 2 Fihr„ loc. cit. : and ^U-Vl j j .Up ^ oUll j, thus also Yaq,, loc. cit. ® Agh,f X, 15623 ff. ; Yaqbt, vii, 8^2 in the biography of Ibn ai-A‘rabi. HIS kitIb al-mxjhabbar 5 Habib did not use to go to the mosque and teach there Thadab tried to induce him to do so. When Ibn Habib at last went to the mosque people assembled to hear him and he was asked for the explanation of some difScult verses. He complied, but avoided to explain one difficult phrase. When asked again he had to admit his ignorance on this point, whereupon Thadab explained the expression. Muhammad b. Habib never went to the mosque again and I^adab kept aloof from him.^ It is, of course, very difficult to decide how far such a story aiming at diminishing the scholar’s fame can be trusted. It is told by al-Marzubani, who also accuses Ibn Habib of having falsified the books of which he w^as the rdwi and having substituted his own name instead of that of the author ; thus the Cy* ^ said to have been written by Isma‘il b. Abi 'Ubaidallah, although it is now found in the list of Ibn Habib’s works. It is equally impossible to decide whether this accusation is justified. In any case Muhammad b. Habib seems to have been rather a prolific writer. The list of his boobs and editions in FiJirist comprises thirty-five, and in Yaqut thirty-nine works, among them five duvdns of poets. ^ Hajj] Khalifa mentions the names of fourteen of his works, ^ referring to some of them more than once, and in the Bughya we find the names of twenty-one works, among them the duvdns of three poets. ^ Yaqut, loc. cit., 475, cf. Bughya, 3 O 2 . 2 Yaqut, loc, cit., 475 ; Fihr,, loc. cit. ; for tlie accusation see Yaq., ioc. cit., 474 ; Buglyya, 30i, ® The two lists agree with each other if one disregards such differences as appear to be due to copyists’ errors or the lack of diacritical marks, as, e.g., ^ in Fihr,, against ^Ji JyJ Cr^ Y'aqut. See also Isdba, iw, 443, lOff., 665 (Ko. 641). ^ Ibn Habib’s works are mentioned H.

For and see below. 6 MUHAMMAD IBK HABIb AJTD It IS Strange ttat Ibn Habib, ^vbo was recognized as a trust- worthy scholar and whose liistorical and genealogical know- ledge, as the Mtdb al-muliabbar proves, was vcrv great, does not seem to be quoted as authority as often as one would suppose. Thus Tabari does not seem to refer to him at all, ^ m the MvfaMaliydt he is quoted nine times ; in the Jfjhdni he IS cited comparatively often ; ^ Hawawi « quotes a passage from Ibu Habib’s hiidb d-^nuHalif tva4-mumalif fi-v-nasab,^ and Ibn Hajar w'ho refers to him occasionally even mentions the Mab al-muhabbar.^ The work is also quoted by Ibn al- Adin.-^® In the hitdb asmd' Mail al-‘arab by Ibn al-A'rabi he is quoted four times.® On the other hand, as mentioned above, he is one of the principal authorities for the Naqd'id of Jarir and al-Ferazdaq.’ ' The Work The htdb al-muhabbar seems to have been the most important among Muhammad b. Habib’s works. In Yaqut’s list its excellence is expressly mentioned : •uT There has been some uncertainty on the ’ Cf.

In tiie Filirist ^ it is called wMck title also occurs in Hajj! lOialifa.^ Suck a mistake is easily explained : a form like or the in- formant or '' narrator ('*' nuntius ’’ in Hajji lOiaL, v, 435, transl.) seemed to be so much more obvious than the rather uncommon word the adorned one, the gilt one . The title-page of the only copy still extant calls the work the word being vocalized and the being marked with the distinctive sign. Thus there seems to be no doubt possible as to the correctness of this title.® In the choice of a title for his works Ibn Habib shows some preference for this verbal form ; in the bibliographies as given in Fihfist, Yaqut, and Bu cjh tjd it occurs several times. We find there a Utah al-mu^ajjar, hit. al-muwashsM, hit. al-muwa sluh a‘ . hit. al-munammaq.* All these titles seem to indicate that the work deals with a great variety of topics, as indeed is the case with the hiicib ul-^ntihubbdT.

It will be worth while to add a more detailed description to this summary statement. On the whole the manuscript has been carefully written and the text was faithfully reproduced from the copv. Although the copyist was sparse in vocalizing his transcript, vowels are generally added where there could be any doubt about the reading, especially in verbal forms. The\" lack of voweUing^ is sometimes felt in the genealogical lists where the vocalization of a name is often doubtful. On the other hand those consonants wliich generally are the cause of difBcuities are carefully marked with the diacritical signs. Thus j, ^ are throughout discriminated by the muhmila, r , q, J, J-, generaUy provided with diacritical marks ; only o and ^5 being left undiscriminated very often, and o, O, j, sometimes. Some orthographical points should be noted : the 1 is generaUy omitted in such names as .fUU, jUJl almost always written o^, dlU, and also other names are occasionally written with- out it, as, e.g., instead of or \\\\ is occasionally written for X as in JS'lf or jjff; 1 . throughout for f ; T for ^1; » is omitted almost generally.’- Copyist’s errors seem “Stance occurring on fob 14a„ where al-Wahd b. <Abd al-Melik is said to have led 'the T>il- grimage mneteen years after his death. Omissions of words or sentences occur occasionaUy, but these have been added ^ A. Gliandour Bey, in ibid. ^ These are, of course, common features in Arabic manuscripts.

So far I have been able to find out only one instance where a few words are omitted ; on fol. 89&j3 three words seem to he missing as a comparison of the passage with the parallel text in the NaqcTid shows. ^ Of course it is possible that there are omissions in the hundreds of genealogies, but it will be almost impossible to find these out as many of the names occurring in these genealogies are entirely unknown and not found anjwdiere else. Dittographies occur occasionally, in some instances already observed by the copyist himself and crossed out. In a few places a blank occurs where the scribe either was unable to read his copy or where he found it already defective, as on fol. The manuscript itself is well preserved, only occasionally the paper is broken, but nowhere so badly as to render the words illegible, and only to^vards the end of the w'ork (from fol. 165& onwards) the inner margin (i.e. the end of the lines on the verso and the beginning of those of the recto page) of lines 8 to 10 are blurred by water.^ Unfortunately the manuscript is not complete, breaking off in the middle of a chapter (on on foL 172&.

Beginning with a survey of the history of the world it soons turns to events nearer to an Arab's interest, the history of the Arabian Peninsula before and after the advent of Muhammad. The author’s principal endeavour in the book, however, is not to give the full report of the events, but to give a skeleton account of them laying emphasis on the collection of the facts rather than relating the course of the events. Thus the book contains a great number of lists : lists of the maghdzt and sardya, lists of governors, lists of the leaders of the pilgrimage from the beginning of the Islamic era up to the date of Ibn Habib’s death supplemented by as-Sukkari who died a.h. 275 ^ and an unknown author ^ up to A.H. 279. Lists of people who limped, fists of people whose mother was a Christian or an Abyssinian woman, fists of people who bought their freedom are instances of this adduced at random. The main feature of the work is the mass of genealogical material which is nowhere else found in such completeness. It strikes an uncommon note, too, in that these genealogies are widely concerned with the relationship on the mother’s side going back to the mother, the mother’s mother, the mother’s mother’s mother, and so on, often bringing the genealogy back in this way to the remotest times of Arabian antiquity. We cannot examine here the question how far such genealogies may be trusted (and in fact there are a few instances of contradictory statements with regard to genealogy in the work itself) ; in any case, however, it is but seldom that other authors consider this side of genealogy.® This interest in questions of genealogy ^ Or 290, tims Bughya, SlGg. 2 See beiow, p. 19. ® Ibn Sa'd occasionally mentions the mother’s mother or the mother’s maternal grandmother of, say, a caliph, but he does not go much farther. 14 MUHAMMAD IBN HABIB AND and kinsHp is also shown in a chapter headed j o!>Uul <131 (fol. 376u-41c8g) which gives a hst of all persons who were the Prophet’s relations only by the fact that they were related to one of the Prophet’s wives. One can imagine that such relationships, or claims of being related to the Prophet, even if remotely, played a role in the life of the Islamic state, for instance with regard to pensions (‘afd’ and nsq) or the claim for an office and similar things, and that it was considered useful and important to make a compre- hensive list of all those persons who could claim any relation- ship to the Prophet. Lists of a similar Mud do occm’ in other works, as, for instance, an enumeration of those who were present or Mlled at Badr ^ or of those who emigrated to Abyssinia.^ But what gives the hitdb al-muJiabbar its value and its distinctive character is not only the completeness of the material but also the preference shown for this way of classifying it. Among these lists mention may be made of two more which seem to me to be especially interesting and valuable. These are the lists of women of the Qurai^ and AnsS.r who did homage to the Prophet (fol. Mlfeig-lbOSg) and the much shorter Hst of women amongst the mushrikun (fol. I 5 O 64 „), which gives only the names of sk women who did not become Muslims together with their husbands (by the way, quite an interesting piece of evidence for the independence of Arabic women m ancient times). The other is the Hst of women who had three husbands and more (fol. 1516, Although the fact that divorce was easy in Arabia and that women used to marry and be divorced and remarry often Iba HabSb seems to have specialhsed in this side of geneaJogieal research as IS shoTO by the titles of others of his works : as, for instance.

Ibn Hish., p. 208fls. to be divorced again is well known, sucli a list giving only the names of tbe woman and ber successive husbands is very impressive. Such lists are of considerable value for the student of Arabic and Islamic history, as they may help to explain many facts recorded in the Arabic chronicles which have hitherto been unexplained, and also explain the connections of personalities to each other and the interdependence of events. In many cases these lists are interrupted by a tale in con- nection with a man or an event mentioned, but wherever such an interruption seemed necessary to the author it is done as briefly as possible. Brevity is, on the whole, a characteristic trait of the composition of this work. The importance of this book does not only lie in these hsts. There are a great many narratives and anecdotes concerned with both pre-Islamic and Islamic subjects. Many of these are entirely new, others found only in few other sources. The chapters on O.isi 1^1 (fol. 69%5--7763) and (foL 7764-84%5) or the chapter on the ancient fairs LUl^l (j (fol. 9464 - 96 ^ 9 ), for in- stance, contain rich material entirely or almost entirely unknown. The chapter on customs of the JdhiUya Js2jLw>^^ l,^»<4£S|yW i w-aW ^ (fol. 109&4~120%6) is especially valuable, not only because its content is important and partly new but also as it collects material otherwise dispersed. I was particularly interested in a detailed description of the nieisir-gsme and its rules, and of the different prayers addressed to the various idols at the pilgrimage. Two more instances may be quoted : Fol. 66i.g the era of j.uJ! is mentioned. The only parallel which I have been able to find so far is in al-Biruni, ahd&dr al-bdqiya, p. 347_io- The names of Aus and Hasaba, the sons of Aznam b. 'Ubaid b. Thalaba b. Yarbu^ b. Hanzala b.

When they returned the Prophet said to Mm : evil is what you have done.’’ TMs seems to be the only place where this expedition is recorded, as neither the expedition nor the name of its leader seejns to be mentioned elsewhere. But even in those parts of the book to which parallels can be found in the works of other authors accessible to us the information given in the kitdb al-muliabhar very often differs from that in the parallel texts. This assertion holds good especially with regard to dates, even of such well-known events as the date of the accession and the death of the caliphs. An instance of the difference between the version in the Iciicib al-muhahhar and a parallel in another source is the story of al-Qattal al-Kilabi (fol. 826i ff.) which is found also in AgMm, xx, 158 ff. But although Muhammad b. Habib and his rdwi as-Sukkari are quoted as authorities in this parallel text, the narrative as told in Aghdm differs from our text. The chapters on the women called 'Atikah and Fatimah among the Prophet’s ancestresses may be adduced as another example of such divergences. Ibn Sakl in his Tahaqdt, i, 1, p. 32, has a chapter on the same subject : ^“1^1 j i (jbSj The Isndd given at the head ^ Kind communication from Professor Levi Della Vida. It is noteworthy that the ‘am al-ghadr is not mentioned in s,v. akadr, which shows that this era had entirely fallen into oblivion in later times. HIS KITAB AL-MUHABBAR of the chapter is : i-®- the Isndd agrees ^dth that given at the beginning of the kildb al-muljabbar. Nevertheless, there are differences between the two representations of the same subject ; Ibn Sa^d not only mentions thirteen women called 'Atikah among Muham- mad's ancestresses against Ibn Habib's twelve, but he also reaches them by different genealogical ways. The same can be observed right at the beginning of the work in the calculation of the time which passed from the Creation of the World to Muhammad’s time. Such a chapter is found almost generally at the beginning of historical works by Arabic authors. Of course, the subject offers the best opportunities for substituting figures according to the author’s fancy ; but apparently a common style had developed and most authors count the generations ( and not the years between one patriarch and the other, between the Flood and the Immigration into Egypt, and so on. In the two chapters devoted to this subject in the Idtdb al-muhabbar Ibn Habib does not count by generations but by years, which of course is rather dangerous. Here and also in later chapters dealing with biblical legends and history ^ again Ibn al- Kelbi is the authority for Ibn Habib’s version as well as that of other authors (e.g. Ibn Sa'd, i, 1, p. 26? n., and the appro- priate passages in Tabari and others). In this particular instance Ibn Habib protects himself against possible critics by stating himself (foL 6bj% tu) that the differences in the statements of the various authorities are %^ery great and that Allah knows best. Especially in the middle part of the work the narrative is frequently interrupted by verses. Such verses occur also in the first and third part, but not so often. The more frequent occurrence of poems in the second third of the book coincides with, and is explained by, the fact that in this section we find most of the narratives and no longer only lists of names ^ See below, p. 21. JliAS. JAlSfUARY 1930. 2 18 MVHjmSUD IBX HABIB AXD whieli occupy the greater part of the first section and abound again towards the end of the book. Many of them have not been found at aU in other works, others could vet be traced only in few .sources, while in some cases only one'or two of the verses are quoted in other works. In a few cases even the poet’s name could not yet be identified from other works. Thus, the Idtdb aUmhabhar adds to our knowledge of Arabic poetry. Altlioiigli tlxe work is not dated we can infer tlie appx’oximate date of the compilation of its bulk from internal evidence. The list of sons-in-law of the caliplis ends with al-lYathiq (fol. 24ff,,3) who died in A.H. 2.82 ; as the sons-in-Iaw of al- 1 utawakkil in whose reign Ibn Habib died are not included in the enumeration of sons-in-law of tlie Prophet, the caliphs, and other personalities of outstanding importance, the con- clusion may be drawn that the book was written in the reign of al-Wadiiq in or before a.h. 232. The same conclusion IS borne out by the list of crucified persons which ends with a man, Ahmad b. Nasr b. Malik b. al-Haigiam aI-Khuza‘i crucified by al-Wadiiq (fol. 169a..). The list of peoprwbose heads were cut off and exhibited ends with Ishaq b. Isnitfil at-Tiflisi whom ai-Mutawakkil executed (fol. 1706j). As far as can be judged at the present stage of the^xamina- ion of the book none of tbe other lists goes beyond the events lying within the scope of Ibn Habib’s own life.i Muhammad b. Habib can safely be regarded as the author of information on events which have happened between the ms tile list ofthe chiefs of the caliphs’ bwlymiard ffol ISIA 133a„) ending iinth al-Mutawakkil {whose reign began that of b\" tTat °of their ‘c;£“ HIS kitAb al~muhabbab 19 time of al-Wa&iq's death, and 245, the date of Ibn Habib’s death, and whieh the latter may have added after 232. But all informatioii which goes beyond this date was of course added to Muhammad b. Habib’s original work. In one instance this appears quite distinctly. It occurs in the enumera- tion of the caliphs and the leaders of the Hajj (fol ISfeis^.) which is continued from the year 245 up to 279. These addi- tions were made by the as-Sukkari and by some other person.^ In this connection mention may be made of the following passage in the first chapter (fol. 5% f.) ; As 245 is the year of Ibn Habib’s death it seems not imlil^ely that this note has been added by as-Sukkari as a sign of honour for his master. The Sohhces and the Isnad The problem of the sources of the Mtdb al-miihabbar is not easily solved and the solution is made more difficult even by the haphazard way in W'hich Ibn Habib treats the Isnad. Only very seldom does he mention his authority and even when he does so it is not always quite evident how much of the information has been derived from the authority quoted. The rdwi of the Mtdb al-nmlmbbar is Abu Sa'id al-Hasan b. al-Husain b. 'Ubaidallah b. al-'Ala’ b. Abi Sufra as-Sukkari,^ as appears from the Isnad at the beginning of the work given below. As-Sukkari is mentioned further on foL ib^, 19a9, 39ajL7j 4:8%, 143&ig, and 164^7 f.. Ibn al-KeIbi seems to be the principal authority for the work, as not only does ^ The date of as-Sukkarf s death is related differently, either 275 or 290 {thus Bughya, p. 219g). Against Rieii’s opinion expressed in his note on the MS. in the Catalogue of the Brit. Mus,, loc. cit., that this passage in the kit. al-inul},. “ favours the later of the above dates ’’ speaks the fact that the list is not continued beyond the accession of al-Mn‘tadid in the year 279. It seems more likely that either a copyist or a reader has made this entry, perhaps in the margin of his copy which has later been inserted in the text before as-Sukkari’s concluding note: y\\ dA Cf. A 2 See, for instance, Yaqut, iii, 62 ff. ; Bu aJim . 218 u.ff. 20 MUHAMMAD IBN HABIB AXD his name appear in the Isndd Mith which the book begins, but as he is also the scholar whom Ibn Habib mentions most often. This statement is corroborated l>y the fact that Ibn al-Eelbi is known to have been Ibn Habib’s teacher ; the probability is increased by the fact already mentioned above that the author of the Utah aUmihahhar was the rdwi of Ibn al-Kelbi’s Janiharat al-ansdb. Therefore we may assume that especially in the genealogical pas.sages of rhe book Ibn Habib makes use of material handed over to him by Ibn al-Kelbi.i On the other hand it must be admitted that there are differences between the text of the Jdfdb aUmhabhar and parallel texts even when Ibn al-Kelbi is referred to explicitly as authority for the parallel text. An instance of this has already been given. ^ The Isndds in which Ibn al-Kelbi is mentioned are the following : o: juJ-l v /v- i-S -x.*- J’i IIOI. \"TUI ^ CfJ a* a* ^ (fob Sas f. ; the same sequence also fols. 57bj^^ and c (j! ^ ^y \\ Jli Aot*., (fol. 48ai ff.) 1 A proof for the correctness of this statement may be seen in that in the hit. al-mul. we find names for which the only other som Jamharat al-ansdh,Q.g.

Most probably the information given under his name has also come to Ibn Habib through Ibn al-Kelbi.

It may be said, however, that besides these writings Ibn al-Kelbi’s works generally were used by Ibn Habib since the ground covered by the hitdb al-miiliabbar coincides with that in which Ibn al-Kelbi was interested. Thus we are justified in saying that most probably Ibn al-Ivelbi was the principal autho.rity for Ibn Habib's hitdb al-muhabbaf although it will be necessary further to examine the problem of the source in each case individually. Thus only we shall be able to answer the question with some degree of certainty. But Ibn al-Kelbi was not the only authority from whom Muhammad b. Habib derived his material for his voluminous 1 The titles have been taken from Yaqut’s article on Ibn ai-Kelbi, in which the Fihrist is quoted, vol. vii, p. 249 ff. HIS KITiB AL-MTJHABBAB 23 work.

This tablet is of a type of which the following are the best examples so far published : Chiera, STA. 22 and 23 ; Jean, SA. LXXVI ; Genouillac, TEO. 5680, 6037, 6046, 6052, 6056, 6162. These, like the British Museum tablet transliterated above, are Umma texts. They seem not to occur in so full a form in the collections from other sites. It happens that the first line of the British Museum tablet is identical with the JRAS. JAXrATLY 1939. 3 34 SUMERIAN TABLETS OE THE THIRD DYNASTY OP UR last lines of Genonillac, TEO. 6056^ in quantity of money and in year of date. On Genouillacfs text the amount of money is described as the lahni^ i.e. the balance of the capital (sag-mg-ga-m) after expenditure (zig-ga). On the British Museum tablet that same amount is described as the si~ni~th, i.e. the ‘‘remainder'’ from the same year, Bur Sin 5. The agent {dam-qar) is the same in both texts : Seskalla. Hence the B JI. tablet is the sequel to Gen., TEO. 6056 in the series of balanced accounts {nig-Hd^ig) of the agent Seskalla. The number of tablets of the tjqie of the British Museum tablet published here, is very small in comparison vith the large numbers of tablets of other types published from Unmia. The reason is, no doubt, that most tablets are day-to-day records of receipt and expenditure, whereas tablets of the type we are considering cover expenditure over a longer period, and concern a special class, the dam-qar. The essential elements of such tablets are the following : — 1 . Statement of amomrt of money and/or goods wdtli their money equivalent, from various sources (as si-ni4b, i.e. remainder from a previous year which is named, or as diib, i.e. account, of one or more persons, or as hi-N-ta, i.e. from one or more persons). 2. The total amount (su-nigin) in a single denomination (always money except Jean, SA. LXXVI, where throughout only barley (se) is mentioned). 3. This total is described as “capital” (sag-nig-ga-ra), 4. The main body of the tablet is introduced by the term id~bi4a, i.e. “ out of this ” (capital sum), and consists of a list of goods with their equivalent in money (with which, no doubt, they were purchased) and the names of the persons accountable for the transaction {dub-NN). 6. The total (su-nigin) of the several amounts of money expended {zig-ga-dm) is then stated. If the amount of money expended is greater than the capital sum given in the early part of the tablet, the excess {dir) is stated ; if it is less (as in our tablet) the balance (hl-ni) is given ; if neither more nor SUMERIAN TABLETS OF THE THIRD DTNASTy OF UR less tliatt the capital is expended no comparison is needed or made. 6. Finally the entire tablet is described as nig-sid-ag, except in Gen,; TEO. 6046, where we have sag-mg-ga, i.e. capital We have:-— . nig-sid-ag Ses-kal-Ia dam-qar (B.M. 106064 ; Gen., TEO. 6056) mg-M-ag Ur'-^^Diinin-zid-da danvqar (Cliiera, STA. 22; TEO. 5680) mg-sid-ag Pad-da dam-qar (Cliiera, STA. 23) mg-Md-ag Sag-kxid-da dam-qar (Gen., TEO. 6162) nig-sid-ag Inini-ma-iii-zi dani-qar (ib. 6052) nig-sid-ag dam-qar-ne, Lu-kal-la (ib. 6037) mg-sid-ag se, Lu-kal-la, ki-Urda-ta (Jean, §A. TiXIKYl) sag-mg-ga-ra dam-qar-ne (Gen., TEO, 6046). Hence the conclusion seems justified that tablets of tliis type are balanced accounts {nig-sid-ag) setting forth in the first part of the tablet the capital resources on hand and, in the rest of the tablet, the amounts drawn on the capital for various items of expenditure. The capital (cf. TEO. 6046) and the expenditure are assigned to the dam-qar or trader ; probably not a private trader but one in the employ of the temple or temple-state. One element of the scheme of the tablet deserves notice. In each colimm of the tablet there is one or more blank spaces which vary in depth from a space sujSicient for four or five lines to spaces suificient for two lines of writing. By this device the items recorded on the tablet are separated into groups. These groups are described by a phrase immediately following the blank space. Thus in Col. 1, sag-mg-ga-ra, capital, describes the items which have preceded iL Hence the other plirases zig-ga hal-a, nig-KU du^-hk which immediately follow blanks in other columns refer not to what follows, but to what precedes. 36 SUMERIAN TABLETS OE THE THIRD DYNASTY OR UR There is no descriptive phrase after the blank space in column 2. The reason for tliis is that each item has already been described as nig-KU of something. Had each item been nifj-KU of the same thing, the description would have followed the blank space, as in column 3 where the preceding items are all described as nig-KU diiQ-hu. In Rev. 1, first part, there is no need of a descriptive phrase after the blanlc because the items have already been described as receifits of Liikalla, but in one instance the tablet was not sealed {&ub mi-ra-a). Tw’o of the descriptive phrases are difficult : — (i) zig-ga hal-a, “ expenditure bal~a J' As already noted, the phrase describes what has preceded, i.e. a list of items all set out in exactly the same form : commodity, its money value, dub (tablet, sealed) of H (thus referring to the written source whence the summary statement lias been taken). Because none of these items is, in the tablet, associated with cult or cult-objects, it would seem that the equation BAL == naqu is unlikely here. Bal=enu, with the possible meaning “ to exchange would suit very w^ell, and would indicate that the items recorded on the lines following the last blank space are mere exchanges of the several commodities for money. (ii) nig-KU. Probably nig-dib; cf. KU-ba in lii-kuTg- KU-ba-me [Orientalia 34, pp. 33, 34, where pre-Sargonic Lagash instances of KU-ba are cited). In Ur III we have dumu KU-ba-me, ITT. iii, 6128, El ; v, 9563 ; lu mg-KU-ba- ge-ne (Contenau, HEU. 14, 4 ; Fish, JR. 764 ; Genouillac, CP. 34, 8). dib = harm ; hence nig-d%h a thing appointed, ear- marked so to speak, for the objects mentioned. The contexts of nig-KU on Ur III Umma texts are given in Schneider, Das Drehem und Bjohaarchw, 2 Heft, 1 Teil, p. 68 f. For Ur III Lagash, cf. e.g. Hussey, ST.

It is unfortunate that tablets of Ur III which mention these things do not tell us much of the uses to which they were put. But the following contexts are of interest. We need not consider the common things, barley and wool, whose use for food and clothing and as w’-ages are well known. imdaMah, gj^psum ; cf. Thompson, Diet., p. 148 f. ; there are few references on Ur III tablets.

An Umma tablet, Schneider, DDT. 155, gives an audited inventory made by Datirra the overseer of the lu~tug, usually translated '' clothier ”, The things mentioned in the list are garments of \\^rious kinds and ie and im-lah. The, as it seems, association of lye and gypsum with garments suggests, I think, that they are part of the stock of the clothier, and were, probably, used for washing the clothes, so that the lu-ldg was, amongst other things, a sort of laundryman. The other commodities mentioned on the text, dates, fats, honey, and wine, are sometimes associated ivith cults, chiefly on Lagash tablets of Ur III. And they are so associated on our tablet.

The Structere of ' the Arabian and Persian Lute in the Middle Ages By HEIS'Ry GEORGE FARMER rilHE most popular mstranient of music with both the Arabs and the Persians during what we term the Middle Ages was the lute. It was to them what the lyre and cithara were to the Greeks of old. At the same time it was not an instrument of the people. It was the instrument of the professional musician and all music theory was made con- formable to its teclinic|iie. So highly was the lute esteemed that one writer composed a book about it entitled the Kitab al-'iiqud %va%su'ud ft awsdf ah' id (\" The Book of the Unanimities and Felicities in the Praises of the Lute Its author was the famous mathematician Ibn Yiious (d. 1009). Some specimens of these and similar eulogies may be found in the Nihdyat ahamb of AI-Nuwair! (d. 1332) ^ and the Safmat al-mulh of Shihab al-Din Muhammad ibn Ismail (d. 1857).^ Yet whilst so much has been written about this '‘Queen of Instruments ’b and we know almost every technical musical detail^ i.e. the number and position of its strings as well as the nmnber and precise location of its frets, we know very little of the actual construction of the lute, although this information is to be found in several Arabic and Persian writers from the ninth to the fifteenth century. In view of this it is my intention to give extracts from these authors. To European musicographers these specifications have some value, firstly because it was from the Arabs that Europe borrowed the lute (Arabic al-ud\\ and secondly because we have no information concerning the structure of the European lute during the Middle Ages, the earliest being contained in a manuscript in the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris (Latin, 7295), which dates from the opening of the fifteenth century. ^ Cairo, 1923, vol. v, p, 114 seq. ^ Cairo, 1891-2, p. 467 seq. 42 STRUCTURE OF THE AKABIAJS AJTD PERSIAN LUTE §1 First of all it iiitist. be remembered tbat tb,e; instriimeiit was called aVml because it was made of ’wood the name having been adopted when the wooden-bellied lute superceded the skin-bellied lute of the mbab It is true that other explanations are given for the-, origin of this name by both Arabic writers and Orientalists but, in most cases, without .any logical grounds. , The most recent of these explanations has been given by the late Baron Rodolphe D'Erlanger who, with Sidi Muhammad al-Maniibi ai-Sanfisi, gave us that excellent- translation .of Al-Farabi’s Kitah ahmustqt al-Icabw {La^mmique ambe^ i, Paris, 1930 ; ii, Paris, 1935). In this work Baron D’Erlanger stated that the great Arabic lexico- grapliers Al-Jauliari and AhFxruzabadi gave another sense of the word ‘ud as meaning a tortoise and from this he argues that the word is merely a translation of the Greek xikvs. In point of fact neither the SiMli of Al-Jauhari nor the Qdmus of Al-Firuzabadi contain any such statement ! §2 The earliest account, meagre as it is, of the structure of the lute, concerns the instrument used at the court of Khalif Harim (d. 809) by the famous minstrel Ziryab. The instru- ment constructed by the latter, although the same size as the lute generally used, was one-third hghter. Ziryab appears to have been the first to use silk strings for his lute, and these were not spun in hot water as was the custom. The gut strings used by him were made from the gut of a young lion. According to him, this gut gave a much purer tone {tarmi- num) and it was not affected by changes of temperature. Further, it stood the strain of the plectrum {midrdb) much longer. Incidentally it was Ziryab who introduced a plec- trum of eagle's talon instead of that of wood which had formerly been used. ^ See my Studies in Oriental Musical Instruments^ i, pp. 91-9, and the Sncyclopsedia of Istam, iv, 985 seq. STKUCTURE OF THE AEABIAH AND PEBSIAN LUTE ^6 Ziryab is also credited with having introduced a fifth string on the lute. Hitherto there had only been four strings, viz. the zlr {or highest string) which was yellow, the ma^nd (or second string) which was red, the maMath (or third string) which was white, and the bamm (or lowest string) which was black.^ The new fifth string was placed by Ziryab between the matUath and mathnd strings, a different proceeding from that which obtained in the East. It is not until the time of Al-Kindi (d. ca, 874) that w'e get precise specifications. He was one of the first writers on the theory of music in Arabic and we possess fragments of four of his treatises on the subject.^ Three of these are in the Staatsbibliothek at Berlin, whilst another is in the British Museum. It is from one of the former manuscripts that I quote the followdiig extract on the structure of the lute. Unfortunately, the fragment begins in the middle of the author’s account of the dimensions of the instrument, but we are still able to get a fair picture of the sme of the lute of his day.^ Seemingly the depth of the lute was half of the breadth at the widest part. At this widest part was the beating-place of the strings {madrib al-motdr). This 'was usually a strip of tortoise-shell afiixed to the belly so as to prevent the plectrum (midrab) from damaging the slender wood of which the belly was made. It was fixed at a distance of 6*76 cm. (= 3 asdbl) ^ from the bridge-tailpiece (musht), because greater revsonance in the instrument was found at this widest part. As the depth of beating place was a tenth of the length of ^ Ai-Maqqari, ii, 84, 86, Idem, The Hiatxiry of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain, . . . translated ... by Pascual de Oayangos, i, 411; ii, 119. ^ See my article “ Some Musical MSS.

Then follows a passage on, the thickness of the wood ^ , ■ , ‘Mt is necessary that its [the lute’s] sound-chest ijmn) should be. as thin as possible, and that this should be ..general, .;so that there is .not in the back ) any place thinner nor thicker, than any other place, ilnd likewise in its belly (batn), .because a difference in. the thinness or thickness of its parts would interfere with the evenness {istawW} of the [sound of the] strings and the concord {ittifdq) of the notes.” The material from which the strings are made .and their thickness are the.n de.scribed : — “ And as for the strings, they are four.^ The first of them is the bmmn [or lowest string]. And it is of thin gut made up of four strands {tabaqdt) firmly twisted together. It is of equal gauge throughout, there being not a finer nor thicker gauge in one place than another. After this is the nmthlath [or third string], and it is similar to the bamm [string] except that it is made up of three strands. After this is the matlvm [or second string], and it is not so thick as the [string] as it is made up of only two strands. It is, however, of silk, but is of the same gauge as if it were made up of two strands of gut. After this is the zir [or highest string], and it is less than the maMnd by one strand, . . . And it is of silk and of the same gauge as if it 'were made up of one strand of gut. So the bamfn [string] is made up of four strands because it is the foundation of the principal notes, which are the bass notes [al-nagkam ahkibar), which issue from the wudest part of the larynx. ... And there are two reasons why the mathna and zir [strings] ^ According to the Halbat al-kumait it was from the w'ood of the pistachio tree that it w'as made. 2 Five strings were certainly known during the first half of the ninth century. See the Kitdb al-agham, v, 53. Al-Maqqarl, Analectes^ ii, 86-7. In another treatise by Al-Kindi, British Museum Manuscript, Or. 2361, foL 236v., five strings are mentioned. STRUCTITRE OF THE ARABIAN AND PERSIAN LUTE 46 are made of silk, unlike tke hamm and maMath [strings, whicli are made of gut]. The first reason is that silk, when stretched taut, is finer in tone than gut. The second reason is that these strings require a tautness, on account of their high pitch, wdiich one or two strands of gut are not capable of sustaining.” § 3 A little more information is to be gleaned from the Iliwan al-Safa’ (tenth century) whose rasd'il have so often been printed. Here is what the author of the risdlai al-musiql has to say ^ : — It has been said, ' Seek help in every art from its own people.^ So we say that the people of this art [of music] have said that we ought to make the instrument which is called the lute {al-'ud) of WDod Qchashab), its length and its width and its depth being in the most excellent proportions. These are that its length should be half as much again as its width, and its depth should be the half of it [i.e. half of the width]. And the neck {^uyiq) should be a quarter of the length. And its boards {alwdh) ^ should be thin and made from light wood. And its belly {ivajh, lit. ^ face ') especially should be of thin, hard, and light wood, such as will resound when [the instrument is] played. Then come the four strings, each one being thicker than the other, in the most excellent proportions. And this is that the thickness of the bamm [string] is one-third thicker than the nmtkla^ [string], and the thickness of the nmthlath [string] is one-third thicker than the mathnd [string], and the nia-^nd [string] is one-third thicker than the zir [string]. And . . . the bamm [string] will be made up of sixty-four threads {tdqdi) of silk, and the fmMa^ [string] of forty-eight threads, and the maAnd [string] of thirty-six threads, and the zir [string] of tw^enty-seven threads,” ^ Bombay edition, i, 98. ® Tiiis refers to tbe slender strips of wood, graduated at the extremities, out of which the beautiful arched back of the lute was made. 46 STRUCTUBE' OF TEE; ABABIAN AND PERSIAN LUTE According to tMs miter all ■the. strings were made of silk, whereas Al-K’incil.reconimends silk for the two higher strings only.,' § 4 ' Perhaps, the: most. interesting of these writers on, the con-., strnction of the lute is a certain Abul-Hasan Muhammad ibn al-Hasan, commonly known as Ibii al-Tahhan al-Musiqi (fourteenth century), whose Hwwt al-fimun wa salivat al- malizmi exists in a solitary exemplar in the Dar al-Kutub at Cairo.^ Here, in substance, is what Ibn al-Tahhan has tO' say about the construction of the lute : — '^Take seasoned larch wood {^arbm) which is without flaws, and cut very thin for the belly of the lute. It should be of two or three pieces rather than of one piece. The back should be of thinner wood than the belly, but it should be cut in narrow strips, equally measured, which are placed side by side. The best lutes are made of eleven strips, although thirteen strips are sometimes used, so that the back may be nicely vaulted. The paper [fastened inside] which holds the strips together, should be of the best mansun, . . . The neck should be made slender, so that the hand may close around it when it is held. A strong peg-box {banjalca) ^ must also be made, and likewise the pegs (maldwt). Attention must also be paid to the bridge-tailpiece and nut (anf), as they are both important. “ As for the belly (= safh, flat surface), and its ornamenta- tion (naqsk), this latter should be neatly done and securely fixed, otherwise a buzzing sound will result when you play down [the fingerboard] with the fourth finger (JcMnsir). It is advisable that this ornamentation should not be high. Eather let it be flat. As for the bridge-tailpiece, it should not be weighted by anything, and should not be made of ivory, ebony, gold, ^ Press mark, funun jamtJa, 539. ^ Called the banjah in Villoteau, Description de VSgyptCy 1st edition, i, 850. STRUCTURE OP THE ARABIAH AHD PERSIAN LUTE 47 or any precious thing, because it makes the sound of the lute dull. The decoration of the lute is made with aloes wood, sandal wood, or camphor tree wood, but all this is simply for show. '' The dimensions of the lute should be as follows : — \" Its length should be 180 cm. (=40 asdhi’' madmuma). Its width should be 72 cm. (=16 asdbi' madmuma). Its depth should be 27 cm. (=12 asdW), The bridge-tailpiece should be placed at about 4-| cm. (= 2 asdbi‘ odd) [from the bottom]. The neck should be 29*25 cm. (= 1 sMbr + 1 'aqd) in length. The peg-box should be 29*25 cm. in length. The number of the pegs should be eight unless there is a zlr Mdd string when there will be ten strings, but this is not known in our times.^ . . . \" The best lutes are those which are uncarved and un- decorated, and are made from one kind of wood. If it is desirable that it should be decorated with ebony, this should be as light and thin as possible, and sparsely used. \" Extreme heat and cold spoil a lute. So does the sea air, body perspiration, the fire, the sun . . . and wrapping it up. . . . Cracking and bumping spoil it as do boils on the wood.’’ This lute, as described by Ibn al-Tahhan, is of considerable dimensions. It is a real archlute such as we sometimes see delineated in Arabic and Persian manuscripts. §5 In a contemporary Persian work, the Kanz al4uhaf,^ we also have a description of the structure of the lute, although what is more interesting is an account of the manufacture ^ Here we see that each of the four (or five) strings was doubled, i.e. two strings were tuned to the same note, as they are to-day. 2 Its date is fixed by a chronogram which is either 1346, 1355, or 1362. Manuscripts are to be found in several libraries, in the present case it is the British Museum copy. Or, 2361, fol. 261v, which has been used. 48 STELX^TURE OR THE 'ARABIA^^;' AJS^D PEESIAH LUTE of silk and gut strings. Of the construction of the lute the author says . The -wise are agreed that wood of medium weight is re- quisite in the making of a lute. The wood must be well matured and not green. The best wood for this purpose is ^dh wood which comes from Daiya-bar, although sometimes the wood of Sardis ■ is found good. ■ ■ ‘'As for the dimensions of the lute the length should be 162 cm. (= 36 the width 33*75 cm. (—15 august), and the depth 16*875 cm. (— 7|- angu^t). The measurement of the bridge-tailpiece should be 13*5 cm. (—6 cmgu^t), \" Another authority says that the length of the lute should be one and a half times as much as its width, and the depth should be one-half of its width. '' The length of the neck should be a quarter of the length of the lute, and a fingerboard = board) should be placed on the face of the neck. \" Strings are made of either silk or of gut. With silk strings, they should be white, smooth, of equal gauge and well finished. These are boiled in water and ashes, and are then washed two or three times in pure water and dried in the shade. \" The strings are then twisted into the following gauges. The bam string is made of 64 threads, the fnatMath of 48, the mathid of 32, the zvr string of 24, and the had string of 16. \" A paste of moderate consistency is then made of gum and a httle essence of saffron. This is rubbed on the strings with a piece of linen until it has penetrated into all the parts, when the string is dried, \" As for gut strings, the gut from sheep is better than gut from goats. Some say that white sheep gut is better than black gut, but this is an exaggeration. . . , \" If the gut be fine the ham string is made of three-ply, hut, if coarse, of two-ply. Some make the maihMth string similarly, but really it should be less than the ham string by STRUCTURE OP THE ARABIAN AND PERSIAN LUTE 49 one ply. Tlie strings are stained with saffron or whitewash, this being rubhed into the strings until they are dry.’’ From the dimensions stated this instrument must also have been a cHtarrone or archlute. Another type of lute was the rubdb. It was a double-chested instrument still c|uite common in the Middle East. In the Kam al4uJiaf we are told how the tone of this instrument was improved as follo\"Ws : — - “ Some people powder glass and mix it with glue, which is then poured on the sound-chest in order that the tone of the instrument may be increased.” In the year 1837 a harp-maker of London, named J. F. Grosjean, took out a patent for improving the quality in the tone of stringed instruments. His ^‘improvement” was precisely what we have already seen in the Kmiz ahtuhaf. Here is what the London harp-maker says in the ^precis of his “ patent “ My improvement consists in applying vitrified or crystallized matters to sounding-boards . . , whereby I am enabled to obtain greater fullness and richness of tone. . . . Powdered glass ground very fine is sifted evenly over the sounding-board, which has previously been warmed and coated with cement.” §6 Finally, I give an extract from a work entitled the Kitdb Icashf al-Jmmum (fifteenth century), the solitary exemplar of which is preserved in the Top Qapu Saray Library at StambouL^ “ The name ‘ud (lute) is derived from al-awda (“ the return”), meaning that the days of pleasure may return ^ Abridgments of Specifications relating to Music and Musical Instruments, A.D. 1694-1866.

JRAS. JANUARY 1939. 4 50 STBtrCTURE OF THE ABiLBIA^iT AKB PE'ESIAN LUTE [in the joy of the music of the', lute]. And the small lute with six strings is called the Aa^ta,.mid it is the tarabmb?- . . , ' “ Al-Khwarizmi ^ asked Abul-GhaliyTa ibn .Saman [or Siilaiman] about the lute. He .said, on .the authority of Salih, ibn 'Abdallah ibn Karim al-Nisabiirl, that, there were fom essentials to 'the, lute, viz. wood as thin as 'possible, a tone as sweet as possible, strings as fine as possible, and form and contour as perfect as possible. .... \" It is agreed that the lighter the wood the better the tone. The ancients used four kinds of “wood, which is the best method, viz. beech (2:^.), elm (dwrdar), walnut (saz),^ and vine all of which have qualities which do not exist in other woods., '' Beech gives a ringing tone and is polishable ; elm gives a fineness and is soft ; walnut lasts for ever, is safe from the moth-worm (sus), and has a sweet smell. Any other wood used along with it is likewise safe from attack by the moth-worm. Vine . . . has a quality only to be found in the treasury of kings. If these four woods are unobtainable, others may be used but they are not so good. \" The first man who made the ten-stringed lute was Ah Farabi ^ and the reason is this. A man died in the city in which he was living, and as he was one of the leading men . , . Al-Farabi went to the funeral. . . . "
