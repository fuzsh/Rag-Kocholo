        "text": "City in Kerman province, Iran\n\nFor the administrative divisions, see Kerman province and Kerman County. For other places with the same name, see Kerman.\n\nCity in Iran\n\nKerman (Persian: كرمان; [kʲeɾˈmɒːn] ⓘ)[a] is a city in the Central District of Kerman County, Kerman province, Iran, serving as capital of the province, the county, and the district.[7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Timeline of Kerman\n\nKerman was founded as a defensive outpost, with the name Veh-Ardashir, by Ardashir I, founder of the Sasanian Empire, in the 3rd century AD.[8] After the Battle of Nahāvand in 642, the city came under Muslim rule. At first the city's relative isolation allowed Kharijites and Zoroastrians to thrive there, but the Kharijites were wiped out in 698, and the population was mostly Muslim by 725. Already in the eighth century the city was famous for its manufacture of cashmere wool shawls and other textiles. The Abbasid Caliphate's authority over the region was weak, and power passed in the tenth century to the Buyid emirs. The region and city fell to Mahmud of Ghazni in the late tenth century. The name Kerman was adopted at some point in the tenth century.[9]\n\nUnder the rule of the Seljuk Turks in the 11th and 12th centuries, Kerman remained virtually independent, conquering Oman and Fars.[10] When Marco Polo visited Kerman in 1271, it had become a major trade emporium linking the Persian Gulf with Khorasan and Central Asia.[11] Subsequently, however, the city was sacked many times by various invaders. Kerman expanded rapidly during the Safavid dynasty. Carpets and rugs were exported to England and Germany during this period.[12]\n\nIn 1793 Lotf Ali Khan defeated the Qajars, and in 1794 he captured Kerman. But soon after he was besieged in Kerman for six months by Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar. When the city fell to Agha Mohammad Khan, angered by the popular support that Lotf Ali Khan had received,[clarification needed] many of the male inhabitants were killed or blinded, and a pile was made out of 20,000 detached eyeballs and poured in front of the victorious Agha Mohammad Khan.[13] Many women and children were sold into slavery, and in 90 days the city turned into ruins. However, the Zoroastrians of Kerman who had been strong supporters of Lotf Ali Khan suffered the wrath of the founder of Qajar dynasty the most during this period.\n\nThe present city of Kerman was rebuilt in the 19th century to the northwest of the old city, but the city did not return to its former size until the 20th century.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nEthnicity and religion\n\n[edit]\n\nThe people of Kerman are Persians, and most are Muslim. Kerman is a religious conservative city. Kerman has a small Zoroastrian minority.[citation needed]\n\nPopulation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe population of the city in 1996 was 385,000.[14] At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city's population was 496,684 in 127,806 households.[15] The following census in 2011 counted 534,441 people in 147,922 households.[16] The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 537,718 people in 162,677 households.[5]\n\nIt is the largest and most developed city in the province and one of the most important cities in southeastern Iran. It is also one of the largest cities of Iran in terms of area. Kerman is famous for its long history and strong cultural heritage.[17] The city is home to many historic mosques and Zoroastrian fire temples. Kerman has been the capital city of Iranian dynasties several times during its history. It is located on a large, flat plain, 800 km (500 mi) south-east of Tehran, the capital of Iran.[18]\n\nPopulation development\n\n[edit]\n\nSome of these figures are estimates only, official census results are indicated with (¹).[19]\n\nYear Population 1896 ¹ 40,228 1906 55,000 1916 ¹ 52,154 1926 ¹ 55,048 1936 75,000 1946 ¹ 97,363 1956 ¹ 101,716 1966 ¹ 140,761 1976 ¹ 254,786 1986 310,000 1991 350,000 1996 ¹ 384,991\n\nYear Population 2001 450,000 2006 ¹ 515,414 2011 ¹ 734,442\n\n¹ official census results\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nSurrounding municipalities\n\n[edit]\n\nNorthwest = Anar/North = Ravar/Northeast = Shahdad/West = Rafsanjan/Center = Kerman/South = Jiroft/Southwest = Sirjan/Southeast = Mahan/East = Bam\n\nKerman is located on a high margin of Kavir-e Lut (Lut Desert) in the south-central part of Iran. The city is surrounded by mountains. Kerman is also located along the Saheb Al Zaman mountain. The city is 1,755 m (5,758 ft) above sea level, making it third in elevation among provincial capitals in Iran. Winter brings very cold nights to Kerman. Mountains in the south and southeast Jftan Joopar and Plvar and Kerman[clarification needed] have snow all year round. Kerman is located at latitude 30.29 and longitude 57.06.[20][21]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nKerman has a cold desert climate (BWk, according to the Köppen climate classification), with hot summers and cool to cold winters. Precipitation is scarce throughout the year.\n\nThe city's many districts are surrounded by mountains. The northern part of the city is located in an arid desert area, while the highland of the southern part of the city enjoys a more moderate climate.\n\nThe city of Kerman has a moderate climate. The average annual rainfall is 148 mm. Otherwise, its climate is relatively cool (by Iranian standards).[12]\n\nGeological characteristics\n\n[edit]\n\nFor Iranian paleontologists, Kerman has always been considered a fossil paradise. The discovery of new dinosaur footprints in 2005 renewed hopes for better understanding the history of this area.[25][26]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nPolitics in Kerman are influenced by the former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, his brother and Vice President Mohammad Hashemi Rafsanjani and Hossein Marashi, both from nearby Rafsanjan. Mohammad Javad Bahonar was born in Kerman. He was an Iranian scholar, Shiite theologian and politician who served as the Prime minister of Iran from 15 to 30 August 1981 when he was assassinated by Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK).\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Kerman carpet\n\nThe economy of Kerman is mostly based on farming, notably nut farming and also mining.Pistachios are an important part of the economy in Kerman.\n\nCarpet weaving is one of the main industries of the city, and the carpets produced there are renowned internationally.[11] Carpet weaving is a very old tradition in Kerman.

The province's mineral wealth includes copper and coal.[11]\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe only Iranian anthropology museum dedicated to Zoroastrianism is located in the Kerman's Fire Temple, showcasing the ancient history of Zoroastrians. The idea of launching the museum along with the library of Kerman's Zoroastrian Society came to light in 1983, when the head of the society, Parviz Vakhashouri, and the former head of the library, Mehran Gheibi, collected cultural heritage artifacts of Kerman's Zoroastrian community. These two officials added many other objects to this collection. The museum was officially inaugurated during Jashn-e Tirgan in 2005 by Iran's Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization (ICHHTO).\n\nJashn-e Tirgan or Tiregan is an ancient Iranian rain festival observed on July 1. The festivity refers to archangel Tir (literally meaning arrow) or Tishtar (lightning), who appear in the sky to generate thunder and lightning for providing much needed rain.\n\nThe Sadeh ceremony is celebrated every year in Kerman.\n\nAlso, the archeological ancient areas of Jiroft and Tappe Yahya Baft are located south of Kerman. Rayen Castle is also located in Rayen town, southeast of Kerman.\n\nSome of the handicrafts and souvenirs of the province of Kerman are traditional embroidery known as pateh, carpets, rugs, jajeems, kilims (a coarse carpet), satchels, and other hand woven articles. Caraway seeds and pistachios from Rafsanjan, Zarand, and Kerman are best of the main items of this province.[29]\n\nSport\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is home to athletic teams representing different sports.
