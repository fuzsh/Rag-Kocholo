        "text": "Sweden, January 10 – 24, 2024\n\nThis blog entry describes a trip to Sweden that involved time in Stockholm, the small arctic town of Abisko, and the city of Luleå (pronounced LOO-lee-oh). The objective of the trip was to visit our youngest daughter, to travel north of the Arctic Circle to see the Aurora Borealis, and to experience a smaller Swedish city on the Gulf of Bothnia. on our way back to Stockholm. I hope you enjoy the following summary and, best of all, the pictures!\n\nWednesday, January 10, 2024\n\nWe began our trip by flying out of Fargo, North Dakota via Delta Airlines. We were to fly to Stockholm (ARN) via the Twin Cities (MSP) and Amsterdam (AMS). At MSP, we boarded plane, de-iced, and then sat on tarmac. We later learned our delay was due to medical situation on the plane which required the plane to return to gate so the affected passenger could receive care. We eventually left for Amsterdam 2 hours after our scheduled departure. Luckily, we had a four hour scheduled layover at AMS.\n\nThursday January 11\n\n8,669 steps, 3.74 miles, 61 minutes “exercising”. (For purposes of this blog entry, exercising is as defined by my Apple Watch.)\n\nUpon our arrival in Stockholm, we rode the Arlanda Express train to the Central Station, the location of our hotel for the next two nights: the Radisson Blu Waterfront hotel. We enjoyed a beautiful standard room overlooking Gamla Stan, City Hall, and one of the many waterways between the many islands of the Stockholm archipelago. Our daughter joined us at 6:45 p.m. to take us for a walk to combat the effects of jet lag. After walking around central Stockholm for a while and finding the local pub at which we wanted to dine closed for the night, we settled on O’Leary’s Pub. We dined on a pulled pork sandwich and loaded nachos. We then made our way back to our hotel to get some sleep.\n\nFriday, January 12\n\n20,690 steps, 9.17 miles, 159 minutes exercising.\n\nI awoke at 9:30 a.m. and bought a cinnamon roll, smoothie, and coffee from the nearby train station. After eating the roll and drinking the coffee, I returned to the room, packed up my Nikon camera and headed out for a long walk through Gamla Stan to get moving after our long airplane journey. Our daughter gave me the name of a coffee shop located on eastern Gamla Stan adjacent to the water, so my objective had been established. I walked around city hall, through its courtyard, and toward Gamla Stan. I then walked through the old city and found the coffee shop to which I was referred. After a cup of coffee, I walked along the water, the palace, and parliament on my way back to the hotel.\n\nAfter completing our preparations for the day, we bought tickets for the train to visit our daughter at her apartment. Her beautiful apartment is efficient, well laid out and spacious (by European standards). Her deck overlooks a hill on which multiple children were sledding. We decided to head out for a small snack to hold us over until dinner. We walked north of her apartment to a bridge that crosses the train tracks. We then made our way to a lovely, small Italian restaurant located in the small mall on the east side of the tracks. The atmosphere was warm and the owner very friendly. We shared a pizza and a charcuterie plate, which were both very good.\n\nWe then made several train trips to arrive at the entertainment and shopping area surrounding the Globe. We then walked to the Sjöstaden Skybar to enjoy dinner and have a cocktail while enjoying the view from the restaurant’s 38th floor location in the southern part of Stockholm. As to beverages, we enjoyed a “Proper Sour”, a red wine, and a “Fairy Godmother.” For dinner, we had a Salmon salad, Risotto, and a Labhne Salad (a Mediterranean salad). All the food was very, very good and the restaurant well worth the visit. From the restaurant we made our journey back to the hotel to retire for the evening, while our daughter made her way back to her apartment.\n\nSaturday, January 13\n\n12,848 steps, 5.37 miles, 59 minutes exercising.\n\nThis evening we embarked on the 16.5 hour night train journey north of the Arctic Circle to Abisko. As a result, we need to pack up our luggage and spend the day out and about until our rail departure. We awoke at 10:30 a.m. (yikes!) and began packing while our daughter made her way to our hotel room. While our luggage was stored by the hotel, we walked around and hit all the outdoor sporting goods stores so my wife could find some new boots, visited a couple of malls, and toured the Downtown Camper (DC) hotel and its facilities. As far as food goes, we had lunch at Sin Ramen (very good ramen options and atmosphere) and paused mid-afternoon for a snack in DC’s lower level cafe off of Drottninggatan. We then meandered back to the hotel to collect our luggage and board the night train. After getting settled in our 3-person sleeping cabin, we headed to the dining car to enjoy our evening meal (chickpea salad, roast chicken with root vegetables, and Swedish meatballs).\n\nAfter dinner we returned to our cabin for some sleep. The motion of the train both rocked us to sleep and, periodically, woke us up depending on the moment. In general, however, it was a quiet and comfortable ride (although the cabin was small and required some ingenuity as to storage of bags and order of going to bed).\n\nSunday, January 14\n\n7,458 steps, 3.29 miles, 43 minutes exercising.\n\nWe were awakened at 5:15 a.m. to prepare for a change in trains, a modification to what we booked due to a train derailment beyond our destination. Although we ended up standing on the platform in -11C weather for about 20 minutes, the transfer was smooth and uneventful. In the new train, however, we did not have a sleeping cabin but were placed in regular bus-like seats for the remaining 4 hours or so of our trip.\n\nAfter arriving in Abisko, we disembarked from the train and walked to our home for the next four nights, the Abisko Mountain Lodge.\n\nThe lodge, established in 2007, is located in the middle of the one and only wilderness of Northern Europe. As our rooms were not yet ready, we relaxed in the comfortable lounge for an hour or so and then walked to the nearby grocery store, known for its extensive supply of candy! While at the store we found some food for lunch (the AML does not serve lunch) as well as some snacks for the upcoming days. Upon our return we found our rooms were ready for us, so we moved into our rooms, unpacked our gear, and took a well-deserved nap. Then, after playing the game “Scout” in the lounge, we moved to the restaurant for dinner. Given its far-north location, the quality of food and selection of wine and other drinks is exceptional. For dinner, we had two appetizers (Creme Ninon and Fried Goat Cheese), and two main courses (Moose Tartar and Arctic Char). The details of each Michelin-quality dish can be found here. We each also enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner, each specifically paired with the entree we had chosen. After dinner we retired to our rooms for a well deserved sleep.\n\nA bit about Abisko. To start with, at a latitude of 68.95 degrees north, Abisko is more than 1,600 miles north of St. Paul, Minnesota (44.95 degrees north latitude), and approximately 120 miles north of the Arctic Circle. While we were there, we only experienced a couple hours of light each day. There is a huge underground iron ore mine to the southeast of Abisko in Kiruna. Furthermore, to the west in Narvik, Norway lies an ocean port that, despite the temperatures in the area, never freezes due to water circulating from the Gulf of Mexico. Abisko originally served as the site for the workers constructing the railroad connecting the iron ore mine with the port, from which this valuable resource can be shipped year-round. Now, of course, Abisko also serves as a location for tourist activities related to the outdoors in every season of the year. In the winter, and the reason for this specific trip, Abisko serves as one of the best locations in the world to view the Aurora Borealis due to unusually clear skies in the area, the result of the impact of topographical features on weather from the coast that might otherwise obscure one’s view of the “Northern Lights.” Abisko is located in Sápmi, the cultural region traditionally inhabited by the Sámi people. According to Wikipedia, the region stretches over four countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. On the north, it is bounded by the Barents Sea, on the west by the Norwegian Sea, and on the east by the White Sea. The area is historically referred to as Lapland in English. The largest part of Sápmi lies north of the Arctic Circle. The Swedish part of Sápmi is characterized by great rivers running from the northwest to the southeast. The climate is subarctic/tundra and vegetation is sparse, except in the densely forested southern portion. North of the Arctic Circle polar nights characterize the winter season and the midnight sun the summer season—both phenomena are longer the further north you go. Reindeers, wolves, bears, and birds are the main forms of animal life, in addition to a myriad of insects in the short summer.\n\nMonday, January 15\n\n14,196 steps, 5.73 miles, 43 minutes exercising.\n\nThis morning we met in the restaurant at 8 a.m. for breakfast. The breakfast is served in a buffet style and includes a variety of lunch meats and cheeses, pickled herring, more than a dozen jams, homemade breads, sausage and eggs, hard-boiled eggs, and more. The buffet was wonderful, was neatly displayed, and satisfied everyone in our group. After breakfast we prepared for a two-hour walk through nearby Abisko National Park. This 19,000 acre park lies adjacent to the Abisko Tourist Center, a wonderful jumping off point for outdoor activities all year-round.\n\nOur tour consisted of a two-hour hike through the birch forest, along the Abiskojåkka river, down to Torneträsk Lake, and back to the tourist center. In the course of our hike, we saw six moose, three mothers with their respective calves! Our guides, James and Celia, were knowledgable of the area, its history, its importance in the Sami culture, and its flora and fauna. Even though it was -10 degrees Fahrenheit, our clothing was adequate and we stayed reasonably comfortable during our walk. After our walk we were returned to AML, at which point we stripped off our extra layers of clothes and enjoyed the bag lunches prepared for us by the lodge (except for the sandwiches, which we constructed). Other than the sandwich, the lunch consisted of an apple, a pear juice box, a candy bar and cinnamon roll. We then sat around the lodge, relaxed in the lobby, and snacked on candy from the grocery store.\n\nToday was the first of our 6-hour Northern Lights tours hosted by Lights of Vikings. The tour begins at 6 p.m. with dinner at our lodging place, the Abisko Mountain Lodge! Tonight, we all chose Suovas as our main course. Suovas is a stew with smoked and salted meat from reindeer, goose, and deer served with potato puree, pickled cucumber, and lingonberries. For dessert we had cloud berries with vanilla ice cream. Both were delicious. It will be difficult to pick the entree for the next two nights of the tour!\n\nAfter dinner, we bundled up for the tour, piled into our awaiting minivan, and headed west towards Norway. After about a 30 minute drive, we pulled into a plowed parking lot about 10 minutes from the Norwegian border, put on wind-blocking overalls, and began our observation of the lights. At first, they were a faint glow on the northern horizon. As the night progressed, however, they expanded both in direction (southward) and intensity. There’s no way to adequately describe the dancing and undulation of the lights. The only thing I can really describe are the colors. From green to yellow to pink to red, the colors were brilliant not only to the naked eye, but even more so through a camera which has a more nuanced ability to pick up the various colors. The following pictures give a small sampling of what we were able to see.\n\nAbout 1.5 hours into the viewing part of the tour and after the lights had dimmed a little, our guides (Filipe and Marta) started a fire in a nearby shelter so we could warm up a bit. Over the next 1.5 hours or so we moved in and out of the shelter to alternatively warm up and to watch the progression of the Auroroa Borealis as it ebbed and flowed in strength, texture and pattern.The group then collectively agreed we’d seen enough and should return to our respective lodging. We returned to the lodge, ate the remainder of our lunch, and retired for the night, agreeing that we would meet at 8:45 for breakfast.\n\nTuesday, January 16\n\n9,090 steps, 4.06 miles, 30 minutes exercising.\n\nThis morning we awoke to a text from our daughter asking where we were for breakfast. What a good night’s sleep it had been! We quickly got organized and convened in the dining room for the buffet breakfast. After breakfast we moved to the lounge where we were mostly alone for the next several hours. Around noon we ate our bag lunch in preparation for our afternoon’s activities.\n\nWe then got dressed for our 2-hour dog sledding excursion, employing what we had learned from the night before with regard to cold management (although we had done well, there were a couple of tweaks, such as using foot warmers, we wanted to use for an excursion where you are not walking around). The dog-sledding operator was located next door to the AML so our walk was short. Because we still had the overalls from the night before, upon arrival we were given only an insulated poncho to keep us warm as we moved through the falling snow, permafrost and forest. The three of us were placed on one sled, the heaviest in the back and the lightest in the front. After going over a few safety precautions, we were ready to begin. The dogs were very excited and barking in anticipation of our 15 Km or so journey. Once we began, we travelled over varying terrain at varying speeds. The wind was cold on our faces, probably worst for our daughter in the front. The air temperature at the time of our tour was -1 Fahrenheit (about -18 C). In the middle of the tour we stopped briefly to give the dogs (and the humans) a break and a chance to stretch their legs. The dogs took advantage of the situation and chose to roll in the snow, relieve themselves, and periodically nip at their neighbors as they anticipated the next leg of our journey. While on the move, the dogs were also very entertaining as they would bite at the snow to get water, relive themselves while on the move, and nip at their neighbors while in motion. As to the age of the dogs, they ranged from about 1.5 to 8 years of age, with an average age of 3.5. At the conclusion of our trip, we were able to greet he dogs, each of which had its own personality. Some were very friendly and wanted to be petted, while others moved away as you approached. In the end, while cold outside, we enjoyed the tour and reveled in the fact that we had now gone dog-sledding north of the Arctic Circle. My apologies for the few pictures related to this activity. The air was so cold, and the layers of clothing so thick, it was impossible to take out your camera to get photos!\n\nTonight was the second of our 6-hour Northern Lights tours. For our dinner we each selected the Eldost (vegetarian option), which consists of grilled Swedish handcrafted cheese served with charred lettuce, pickled onion, smoked almonds, grilled corn & croutons. As to the tour, the day had been mostly cloudy and snowing, and the evening was no different. As we drove west in an effort to find clear skies (typical in cold weather – the temperature was around 0 degrees Fahrenheit, -17 C), we continued to find overcast conditions, even as far away as the Norwegian border. In addition, this evening was very windy with snow drifting along the edges of the highway. Eventually we ended up at the same location as we had the preceding night. This time, however, the parking lot was full of semi trailer rigs, presumably due to the blowing snow, and the shelter had already been occupied by a different tour group. So, as the guides indicated this was the best location for seeing the Northern Lights and that we’d simply have to wait to see if they became visible, we hiked out into the snow to find a space relatively free from the wind and away from the lights of the parking lot. We found such a spot, packed down the snow with our feet, and built a fire in the snow to allow us to keep warm during our vigil. Over three hours passed with more than 14 people huddled around the fire to keep warm. Among the group were people from the USA (Minnesota and Maryland), Singapore, Australia, and Argentina! Such diversity made it difficult to find a campfire song workable for everyone! At only one point during our time around the fire did the Northern Lights become visible, and then primarily to the camera (i.e., not to the naked eye). Around 11 p.m. or so the guides decided it was time to end our “punishment” and return to Abisko. As one of the guide’s vans would not start, we piled everyone into the remaining vans to return to town. To be honest, while we saw NO Northern Lights, the evening wasn’t all that bad. Sitting around a campfire on deerskins was quite comfortable (at least for us) and the time passed rather quickly.\n\nAnd now, let me tell you a quick side story. It became clear during dinner that one young woman did not have adequate footwear for the conditions (she was wearing tennis shoes), particularly if it had been a night good for viewing of the Aurora Borealis when you end up standing on the cold ground for hours on end (it later became clear there were a few others in the group that also had inadequate footwear). Because we had an extra pair of women’s boots with us, our daughter offered them to the young woman who reluctantly accepted. At the end of the tour, she admitted the boots had been very helpful and expressed deep appreciation for our daughter’s kind gesture.\n\nAfter we got back to the lodge, we learned that our train back to Luleå on Thursday had been replaced with a bus due to expected temperatures well below 0 F, adding about 1 hour to the trip (7 hours instead of 6). Not a big deal, and safer as the train tracks are very remote and can present danger if a train derails or breaks down. We finally retired about 1 a.m. for a good night’s sleep.\n\nWednesday, January 17\n\n12,743 steps, 5.34 miles, 52 minutes exercising.\n\nToday my day began with a cup of coffee in the restaurant at 7:45 a.m. It was the first morning I got up early enough to catch up on the news and work on the prior day’s blog entry. I was later joined by my wife and daughter so we could enjoy our breakfast together. After relaxing and playing games near the wood stove for a while, we had lunch and decided to go for a walk down to the lake adjacent to the town (Lake Torneträsk). It was very cold again today, so we bundled up and headed out. We walked to town, found the passage under the highway, and followed the train down to the harbor.\n\nThere appeared to be many fish houses on shore awaiting their relocation to the lake in mid-February when the ice is thick enough to support them and the vehicles that move them. There were also a number of quaint little cabins along the shore, similar to those we saw on the path down to the lake. After taking a few pictures, we headed back to town to the grocery store to look for moose sausage. We left the grocery store and headed to the nearby Abisko Guesthouse to determine what souvenirs it had available. The Guesthouse is one of approximately 4 lodging options in Abisko: the Abisko Mountain Lodge; abisko.net Hostel and Huskies; the Abisko Guesthouse; and the Abisko Hostel. About one mile to the northwest, the Abisko STF Turistation also provides tourists a broad array of recreational and lodging options. Its location at the edge of the Abisko National Park provides easy access to hiking and walking trails. Each of the options has, of course, its own pros and cons related to amenities, accessibility of activities, and restaurant options.\n\nAfter buying a small souvenir, we headed back to the AML to warm up before our dinner and last night of our Northern Lights tours. As we sat in the lounge we decided to have a cocktail. While I had previously raised with the staff the idea of having a Manhattan (they had expressed reservations as they had not made one before and lacked a cherry to put in the drink), tonight I convinced them that we could concoct a delicious beverage if we worked together. So, Malin and I pulled together Blanton’s bourbon, sweet vermouth, and lingonberries to blend what we later named the Arctic Manhattan! It was delicious with the lingonberries adding both the fruit component of the cherry and the bitter characteristic of the bitters. Who knows, perhaps it will end up on their menu!\n\nWe later met Filipe in the restaurant and sat down for our last dinner at AML. For tonight’s meal, our daughter again chose the Souvas stew, while my wife and I chose the “Norwegian Skrei Cod,” poached cod with brown butter and soy hollandaise sauce, roasted red beetroot, sunchoke crisps, green kale, and chives. The cod was spectacular, with the sauce being a bit sweet, the fish plentiful, and the vegetables were the perfect level of tenderness. After dinner Filipe, my wife, and I headed out for another COLD night of Aurora watching. The temperature was well below zero, so we immediately started a fire. We were joined by a group from Lima, Peru, a nursing student from Zurich, Switzerland, and the owner of Lights of Vikings (a gentleman originally from Turkey). We sat around the fire and, periodically, were able to get up to observe the Northern Lights. The lights, while plainly visible, were not as large or intense as those we’d seen on Monday night. They were, however, beautiful and pleasure to watch as they ebbed and flowed across the dark sky. At about 10:45 the group decided they’d seen enough and broke up to go back to Abisko and Kiruna.\n\nThursday, January 18\n\n7,051 steps, 3.18 miles, 42 minutes exercising.\n\nToday we had breakfast, repacked all our gear, and checked out of the Abisko Mountain Lodge. Due to a derailment west of Abisko and other decisions by the train company, our train to Luleå has been replaced by a bus. So, shortly after noon we headed down to the bus stop, loaded the beautiful bus and, after a short wait, proceeded eastward to Luleå (a 7 hour journey). The journey was comfortable and went very quickly as we read, took naps, listened to music, and simply enjoyed the scenery. The route was heavily wooded and snow covered the branches of the surrounding conifer trees. The headlights of the bus glistened off the newly falling snow, providing a beautiful setting I shall never forget. In some ways, the bus was, in fact, superior to the train. Concerning Luleå‘s location, its latitude of 65.58 degrees north places it more than 1,400 miles north of St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nFrom Wikipedia: “Luleå is a city on the coast of northern Sweden, and the capital of Norrbotten County, the northernmost county in Sweden. Luleå has 48,728 inhabitants in its urban core (2018) and is the seat of Luleå Municipality (with a total population of about 79,000). Luleå is Sweden’s 25th largest city and Norrbotten County’s largest city. Luleå is considered as the world’s largest brackish water archipelago with 1,312 islands, several rivers and vast forestland. Luleå has the seventh biggest harbour in Sweden for shipping goods. It has a large steel industry and is a centre for extensive research.” More information about Luleå can be found on its tourism site.\n\nUpon arriving in Luleå, we walked several blocks to our hotel, the Elite Stadshotellet Luleå. After getting settled in, we walked a block down the street to a restaurant named “CG”, an abbreviation for Carne Grill. The atmosphere of the restaurant was similar to that of the St. Paul Grill or Kinkaids in that it was warm and inviting, and the service excellent. My wife enjoyed a bowl of lobster soup and a side of potatoes for her meal, our daughter had halibut, and I enjoyed Reindeer steak. To state the main element of the menu item, of course, does not do the meal justice. To fully appreciate it, you must look at how the meal was prepared and its accompaniments (see the menu descriptions here). For dessert, I enjoyed a selection of three cheeses, our daughter had the Crème Brûlée, and my wife enjoyed a sweet delicacy called “french toast” (caramel, ice cream, blueberries atop a small piece of french toast). After dinner we retired to our hotel for a good night’s sleep.\n\nFriday, January 19\n\n13.984 steps, 6.0 miles, 81 minutes exercising.\n\nThis morning began with breakfast in the beautiful ballroom of the hotel. The breakfast spread was extensive and kept well stocked by the staff. After breakfast, we spent some time chatting in the room. We then decided to go for a walk on the Luleå Ice Road.\n\nFrom the Lulea University of Technology: “In wintertime, roads are ploughed through the ice-covered sea, making it possible to travel to the islands by car, snowmobile, skis, skates or on foot. It is certainly a special feeling to travel over the wide open spaces.\n\nEach winter, approximately 25 km of ice roads are ploughed to the Luleå archipelago. It is dependent upon the weather and ice conditions as to how early they are ready.\n\nIn central Luleå, from North Harbour to Gråsjälören, there is an ice road that is usually ready between January and February. It is a popular stretch for lunchtime walks and weekend excursions. You can ice skate here, long distance ski, go by kick-sled or walk. Along the ice roads there are also sheltered areas with places to barbecue. Some of the islands have Wintertime facilities that are open during the weekends and offer food and refreshments. One especially popular activity for Luleå’s residents is to drive out to Hindersön for freshly made waffles.” We walked for a couple of miles on the ice and returned to our hotel through old city.\n\nTo tide ourselves over until dinner we stopped at a coffee shop called “Friends” and enjoyed a pear and feta cheese pizza and a Semmelkladdkaka (a combination between the traditional Swedish Chocolate Gooey Cake “Kladdkaka” which is famous for its gooey inside and the classic semlor when it comes to the ingredients: mostly almond, cardamom and whipped cream). We returned to our hotel for a brief rest, and then went downstairs to eat at one of the restaurants attached to the hotel. After dinner we returned to our room to play a few games.\n\nSaturday, January 20\n\n10,893 steps, 4.81 miles, 51 minutes exercising.\n\nToday is the last morning of our Lapland journey. We ate breakfast in the hotel dining room, packed and checked out of the hotel. We made our way via taxi to the local airport for our early afternoon flight to Stockholm. The airport had only 5 gates and today facilitated only 6 departing flights. Five were to Stockholm and one was to the Canary Islands! Our flight was uneventful and we landed in Stockholm shortly after 4 p.m. We made our way to our hotel and went to Tweed for a cocktail before dinner. We had visited Tweed on an earlier visit and were excited to return to this exceptionally well-stocked bar. I have never seen so many varieties and selections of quality alcohol in one bar before! We each had a cocktail over the 1.5 hours before dinner. We then walked across Gamla Stan to Tradition Restaurant for dinner. Tradition is one of our favorite Stockholm restaurants as evidenced by the fact that we have eaten there each of our last three visits to the city!\n\nTonight I ate the mushroom toast (Svamptoast) as an appetizer and had Köttbullar (Swedish meatballs, potato purée, cream sauce, cucumber, lingonberries) for dinner, my wife and our daughter each had Kroppkakor (Swedish potato dumplings, pork, browned butter, lingonberries). We then walked to the metro station to go back to our hotel to retire for the evening.\n\nSunday, January 21\n\n17,237 steps, 7.48 miles, 103 minutes exercising.\n\nThis morning started with the cheese sandwich from the previous day’s flight, a cup of coffee, and some time spent writing this summary. We then headed to the Slussen area to meet our daughter and four of her friends for brunch. We spent several hours chatting about life in Sweden, travel, pets, and just generally getting to know each other. What a wonderful group of people they were. We’re so appreciative that our daughter has made friends such as these! After brunch we went to our daughter’s apartment and then shopping. We returned to her apartment, hung some curtains, and then headed off the Skansen, the “world’s oldest open air museum” according to their website. We have been to Skansen before, but in the summer. For this trip, our purpose was to visit Skansen’s Winter Lights exhibit, described on its website as: “With over a dozen large custom-made light installations, a bespoke soundscape, and a multitude of other lighting effects and decorations throughout the trail, Winter Lights surrounds you in a full sensory experience!” We spent 1 to 1.5 hours walking around the park enjoying the music, lights, and performers. While somewhat expensive for the experience, it was an enjoyable way to spend a winter’s evening.\n\nAfter we left Skansen we returned to the center of the city in search of a place for dinner. In search of something different tonight, we chose a Lebanese restaurant located near the harbor. This restaurant, the Lebanon Meza Lounge, was new to all of us and was very good. We chose nine different small plates to share, which was the perfect amount of food! To be specific for those among you who love Lebanese food, we ordered Hoummos, Halloumi Salad, Warak Inab, Ardishoki, Calamari, Jebneh Meazi Orikka, Fatajer Sbenigh, Makanek, and Krajdes Moukli.\n\nAfter the meal, we enjoyed a cup of white tea, headed back to the train station to see our daughter off to her apartment, and then returned to our hotel.\n\nMonday, January 22\n\n14,073 steps, 5.81 miles, 54 minutes exercising.\n\nToday began with a pastry, a cup of coffee, and time spent on this summary. I walked over to the train station to get my breakfast. Today the weather was pretty wet and rainy. As a result, the sidewalks have turned into slushy ice. One of the things we’ve noticed is that the city of Stockholm does not clear the sidewalks. The responsibility, if any exists at all, appears to lie with the property owner. Most sidewalks remain uncleared which makes walking a bit of a challenge at times. As far as today, because of the weather and because we’ve been going pretty hard, it will be a quiet one.\n\nOur daughter arrived at our hotel at approximately 10:15 a.m. When we got going we headed for the train station to go to the Mall of Scandinavia, located north of downtown Stockholm. The mall is a beautiful facility, with winding walkways and attractive stores. We made our way to an Indian restaurant for lunch. The service was fast and the food very good. After that we walked through the mall for awhile until we arrived at the movie theatre. We had decided to watch the movie “Wonka” as our afternoon entertainment since the weather outside was unpleasant. After the movie we continued to walk through the mall for awhile before ultimately catching a train to go back downtown. We again walked around some of the retail shops several blocks from our hotel before going to TAK restaurant for our 6:30 p.m. dinner reservation. On a previous trip to Stockholm we had visited the bar floor of TAK. Tonight, we visited the restaurant portion of the business. The restaurant was very different from the bar. While both are very modern in their finishes and atmosphere, the bar is very loud while the restaurant is very calm. TAK is a TripAdvisor award-winning restaurant, and descibes its food as follows: “Modern Scandinavian dishes influenced by Japanese cooking methods and flavours. Complex creations that are easy to enjoy.”\n\nWe began our meal with: Kimchi Josper bread with soy butter; a Spicy tuna handroll with chili, lime, and coriander; and a Crab handroll with pickled celeriac, seaweed tempura, and tarragon dressing. Our entrees consisted of: Celeriac and potato terrine with lingonberry hoisin, hazelnut furikake, and cabbage and pear salad; Kakuni braised pork belly with soy, honey, fermented plum, pickled plum, and garlic kale; and Norwegian Cod with cauliflower purée, hoshi ebi sauce and shrimp crumble. The meals were very good and beautifully presented. In addition, I had a “Caramel and Whiskey” cocktail made with Shinobu 10 year peated whiskey, bourbon, miso-butter, and bitters. The drink had an orange twist on top and was different from any cocktail I had every tasted. It was wonderful! After dinner we accompanied our daughter back to her train and returned to our hotel for the evening.\n\nTuesday, January 23\n\n14,546 steps, 6.2 miles, 57 minutes exercising.\n\nThis morning began with coffee and a banana in the hotel room. We checked in for our flights, backed our bags, and checked out of the hotel. We left our bags with the front desk, grabbed a Semla for breakfast at the Espresso House (kind of like Starbucks in the U.S.), met our daughter, and made our way to the Nordic Museum, located on Djurgården, an island in central Stockholm, near Skansen. According to Wikipedia, the museum is “dedicated to the cultural history and ethnography of Sweden from the early modern period (in Swedish history, it is said to begin in 1520) to the contemporary period. The museum was founded in the late 19th century by Artur Hazelius, who also founded the open-air museum Skansen. It was, for a long time, part of the museum, until the institutions were made independent of each other in 1963.” A central figure in the museum is the statue of Gustav Vasa (1496-1560). According to the plaque at the museum, the statue (see the photo below) was sculpted of oak by Carl Milles and painted purple and gilt by his wife Olga. The early 16th century was a troubled time in Sweden. The king of Denmark ruled the country and there was much dissatisfaction. A revolt was planned and when the time came Gustav Vasa became one of its leaders. He was elected king of a united Sweden on 6 June 1523.\n\nAfter spending several hours touring the museum, particularly the Arctic exhibit, we ate lunch in the museum cafe, did some clothes shopping, retrieved our bags, and made our way to the train station. We said goodbye to our daughter, boarded the Arlanda Express, and travelled to the Arlanda Airport Radisson Blu hotel for the night before our early morning flight. We ate dinner at the local bar (a hamburger and veal schnitzel). We then retired for the night in anticipation of our flights home.\n\nWednesday, January 24\n\n6303 steps, 2.76 miles, 18 minutes exercising.\n\nWe awoke early this morning, checked out of the hotel, made our way through security, and waited in the Pearl Lounge (KLM’s lounge). At the appointed time, we went to our gate only to learn that our flight had been delayed due to the winds in Amsterdam. We returned to the lounge to await a later boarding call. In the end, our plane ended up taking off more than two hour after its scheduled departure time, causing us to miss our connecting flight out of Amsterdam. Because we checked in for our flights through KLM as directed by the Delta app, we were unable to make any changes while in the air, and unable to call Delta to figure out when we could get on flights to get us back to Fargo. When we landed, we immediately called Delta and were informed we had been booked on a flight in two hours that would result in our arrival in Fargo only three hours later than our original schedule. Not a bad result given the situation in Amsterdam! Unfortunately, our luggage chose to stay behind in Amsterdam for a few days, and arrived at our home on Friday, January 26th.\n\nIn Closing and Some Additional Photos\n\nOur trip was very enjoyable. Having gone to Sweden four times in recent years, we are getting more and more familiar with the culture and Stockholm. We find the people to be very friendly, the food to be delicious, and getting around to be fairly easy! We encourage you to give it a try!\n\nWhen exploring our 2023 travel destination, we noticed a gaping hole in our wall map that shows the countries to which we’ve traveled. Taking note of that fact, and after looking at multiple alternatives, we decided to travel to “the Stans” to discover an area and cultures with which we are generally unfamiliar. I also wanted to see some of the ancient Silk Road in person. In all honesty, we didn’t know what to expect. Would we be stepping back in time? Would we see an overwhelming amount of Soviet influence lingering since the breakup of the USSR in 1991? The purpose of this blog is tell you what we found. But first, a little context.\n\nA Brief History of the Region\n\nHaving a sense of the history of this region helps explain some of its current culture. Of course, the diversity and size of the region makes it impossible to explain its history in a few paragraphs, but the following summary from Britannica provides a start.\n\n“The human occupation of Central Asia dates back to the late Pleistocene Epoch, approximately 25,000 to 35,000 years ago, but the first identifiable human groups to live there were the Cimmerians and Scythians (1st millennium BCE) in the west and the Hsiung-nu people (from 200 BCE) in the east. In the 6th century CE the first Turkic people established an empire that lasted for two centuries and greatly influenced the region’s subsequent ethnic character. Another Turkic people, the Uighurs, rose to dominance in the 8th century, and their rule in turn gave way to that of the Khitans and then to the Karakhanids, a Turkic people closely related to the Uighurs. The region was gradually Islamized beginning in the 11th–12th century, a process that was virtually complete by the 15th century. The Mongols took over almost all of Central Asia in the 13th century, and their rule in the form of various independent khanates lasted until the conquests of Timur (Tamerlane) about 1400. Following the breakup of his dynasty, southern Central Asia became divided into several rival khanates that were ruled by his descendants. By the end of the 15th century all of these Timurid possessions had fallen into the hands of the Uzbek people. Russia’s conquest of the region began in the 17th century and continued until the last independent Uzbek khanates were annexed or made into protectorates in the 1870s. Soviet rule replaced that of the Russian tsars after the Russian Revolution of 1917, and thereafter the region was increasingly integrated into the Soviet system through a planned economy and improved communications. In the 1920s and ’30s the Soviet government created five Soviet socialist republics out of the region: the Kazakh S.S.R., the Uzbek S.S.R., the Kirgiz S.S.R., the Tajik S.S.R., and the Turkmen S.S.R. Under Soviet rule, southern Central Asia undertook the large-scale cultivation of cotton to supply the U.S.S.R.’s textile industry with raw material. When the Soviet Union collapsed, all five Central Asian Soviet socialist republics obtained their independence in 1991, becoming the sovereign and independent nations of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.”\n\nThe “Stans” Today\n\nAs you read through this blog entry, there are some important things to consider, including:\n\nAs mentioned above, the countries we visited became independent states very abruptly in 1991 upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union. So, despite centuries of tribal and imperialism history, the modern independent governance of each country is only 32 years old.\n\nThe average annual salary in the United States is approximately $74,700. The average annual salary of the four countries we visited is:\n\n$4,020 in Uzbekistan;\n\n$1,908 in Tajikistan;\n\n$7,800 in Kazakhstan; and,\n\n$3,348 in Kyrgyzstan.\n\nThe estimated 2023 GDP per capita is set forth below. By comparison, the similar US GDP per capita is approximately $80,000.\n\nUzbekistan: $2,563.\n\nTajikistan: $1,277.\n\nKazakhstan: $12,306.\n\nKyrgyzstan: $1,736.\n\nThe population of each country is as roughly as set forth below. Recognize in each case that the majority of the population is located in urban areas.\n\nUzbekistan: 35 million over 173,351 square miles, yielding an average population density of 201 people per square mile.\n\nTajikistan: 10 million over 55,039 square miles, yielding an average population density of 182 people per square mile.\n\nKazakhstan: 19 million over 1.05 million square miles, yielding a population density of 18 people per square mile.\n\nKyrgyzstan: 7 million over 77,201 square miles, yielding a population density of 91 people per square mile.\n\nOur Itinerary\n\nWhen choosing our itinerary, we examined recommendations from several tour operators to get a “feel” for the options and what we might expect. In the end, we selected Silk Road Treasure Tours, an operation run by Zulya Rajabova from a base in New Jersey. Zulya is a native Uzbek from Bukhara, where her extended family still lives, and from which they assist with the on-the-ground planning for the trip. We chose an itinerary very similar to that offered to her larger group tours, but opted to travel alone (i.e., not part of a larger group). A summary of our itinerary is provided below:\n\n– September 12 – 14\n\nTashkent, Uzbekistan. Lodging: Tashkent Palace. 3 nights.\n\n– September 14 – 16\n\nSamarkand, Uzbekistan with 9/15 daytrip to Penjikent, Tajkistan..\n\nLodging: Grand Samarkand Superior Hotel. 2 nights.\n\n– September 16 – 18\n\nBukhara, Uzbekistan. Lodging: Sasha & Son Boutique Hotel. 2 nights.\n\n– September 18 – 20\n\nKhiva, Uzekistan. Lodging: Asia Khiva Hotel. 2 nights,\n\n– September 20/21\n\nTashkent, Uzbekistan following late night flight from Khiva.\n\nLodging: Tashkent Palace. 1 night.\n\n– September 21 – 24\n\nAlmaty, Kazakstan following afternoon flight from Tashkent.

The hotel is part of the Lotte chain of hotels, and was a very nice property in a good location for walking around to see some sites of interest. The hotel was well appointed and had an excellent breakfast selection. Our guide for the entire Uzbek portion of the trip, Mr. Bek, met us the next morning to provide an overview of the city, and to get us moving so as to assist with jet lag. We began with some Uzbekistan history while standing in front of the Alisher Navoiy Theater, built during the Soviet period for ballet and other arts.\n\nWe then walked north along Mustafa Kemal Ataturk Street (past Florya Cafe) to a street market with several merchants selling various things including Soviet memorabilia, woodcrafts, clothing, and toys. We when walked through a park to the Mustakillik Maydoni metro station. We hopped on the metro and travelled to a metro station near Amir Temur Square, a tribute to Tamerlane from the 14th century. We toured the park, including getting a picture of the Tamerlane statue, as well as the Uzbekistan Hotel.\n\nThis hotel was apparently built during the Soviet era, as evidenced by its concrete, blocky appearance. We then walked back to the Florya Cafe where we enjoyed lunch. Our lunches consisted of a “mixed sandwich” (pepperoni and salami sandwich with tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and mayo) and Dolmas (Dolmades), bread, and tea. We then walked back to our hotel to rest for a while. Later in the afternoon we went for a walk through a neighboring park filled with trees and lined with restaurants and playgrounds for children to play in. We also explored the hotel to learn more about our restaurant choices for dinner.\n\nThe next day, September 13, we toured the following sites:\n\nKhasret Imam complex. This complex consists of the Khasret Imam Mosque built in just 4 months in 2007 at the instruction of President Karimov. Within the mosque the columns are made of sandalwood from India, dark green marble from Turkey, and the interior of the blue-tiled dome is decorated with genuine gold leaf.\n\nAbu Bakr Kaffal Shashi Shrine. The Kaffal Shashi mausoleum stands at the northwest corner of the Khasret Imam square. It commemorates the life of Abu Bakr Mohammed Kaffal Shashi, a native poet, linguist, polymath, and scholar who lived in the 10th century and traveled widely throughout the Islamic world.\n\nMuyi Mubarak Library. This building contains dozens of historical documents, including the world’s oldest Qu’ran. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to take a picture of the document.\n\nSheik Tellya Mosque. This mosque, built in 1856, was formerly Tashkent’s main place of worship. The mosque has attractively carved pillars and painted ceilings, although not as ornate as the Khasret Imam Mosque that replaced it.\n\nCentral Asia Pilaf Center. Plov (pilaf) is a common dish throughout Central Asia. Uzbeks in particular, however, have made it into a uniquely national obsession. This obsession is celebrated in full force at the Central Asian Pilaf Center in Tashkent. Typical plov consists of rice, carrots, and meat cooked together, but every corner of Uzbekistan makes its own version and claims to have the best one. Not only is plov an important source of nourishment for the Uzbeks, but it also represents hospitality, community, and identity; it’s not uncommon to see it served at weddings or festivals. At large gatherings, plov chefs, called osphaz, can prepare a giant meal for up to 1,000 people from a single cauldron (kazan). The menu at the Plov Center is simple; there’s plov, salad, and drinks. Customers get to choose how much rice, how much meat, and whether or not they’d like an egg or kazy(horse sausage, similar to Kazakh shuzhuk). Each batch is cooked in a giant, wood-fired kazan, then scooped onto customers’ plates in the cavernous dining hall.\n\nChor-Su Bazaar. This bazaar, housed in a building designed by Vladimir Asimov, Sabrina Adylov, et al, as a late example of Soviet Modernism style. The building has a characteristic blue dome. The bazaar is the largest in Tashkent, and shows the expansive range of items available in the area, whether food or otherwise. It also puts on display the realities and diversity of local life in a major city in Tashkent. The bazaar is, as one writer puts it, as modern as it needs to be and as local as it should be, with the region’s legacy intertwined within all of it.\n\nThe Crying Mother Monument. Fronted by an eternal flame, this monument was constructed in 1999 to honor the 400,000 Uzbek soldiers who died in WWII. The niches along its two wood column corridors enshrine the soldiers’ names.\n\nAbdul Kasim Medreseh. This complex, consisting of a madrasa, a mosque, and a khanaqah, was the site of the signing of a peace treaty in 1865 following the Russian capture of Tashkent. Following the October revolution of 1919, the building was shut down, and later was used by a Tashkent toy factory and fell into disrepair. It was renovated in the early 1980’s and inaugurated in 1987. Today, this Madrasah houses the Khurnamad Association for Craftsman, including painters, jewelers, wood engravers, and miniaturists practicing their skills.\n\nOn September 14, we started the day with a small breakfast at 6:30, checked out of the hotel, and were driven to the high-speed train station for our 2 hour and 20 minute journey to Samarkand. While on the train ride we passed through small farming communities, fields of vegetables, corn and cotton (a major agricultural good in Uzbekistan), and people going about their everyday lives by many means of transportation, including walking, biking, and riding a horse. In the fields we periodically saw cattle, horses, and the occasional donkey. The buildings along the route ranged from fairly new to old and in disrepair. This area is very flat, and quite arid.\n\nSamarkand, Uzbekistan\n\nUpon arrival in Samarkand we spent our day visiting the following sites:\n\nBumazhnaya Fabrika “Meros”. This tourist attraction demonstrated the art of making paper from Mulberry tree bark, oil for plov, and ceramics. All activities were powered only by water and involved several steps. The paper making was probably the most interesting in that it involved many steps and nuances that you wouldn’t normally think of (e.g., stripping the bark down to make it thin, soaking the bark in water for various amount of time at various stages of the process, pulverizing the pulp using a huge log and water-driven piston, and pressing out the water).\n\nWine tasting at Khovrenko. The Khovrenko wine factory has been producing wines here since 1868. The winery grows grapes throughout Uzbekistan and has dozens of factories around the country. While wine is not greatly consumed in the region, the winery produces a handful of good quality wines often a blend of Georgian grapes, French grapes and Azerbaijanian grapes. In addition, the winery produces some sweet dessert wines, a couple of cognacs, and a port-like elixir. While enjoyable, I chose not to bring any bottles home.\n\nUleg Bek observatory. The remains of Uleg Bek’s 15th century observatory is one of the great archaeological discoveries of the 20th century. Uleg Bek’s 30 meter quadrant, designed to observe star positions, was part of the three-story observatory built in the 1420s. All that currently remains is the instrument’s huge curved track, unearthed in 1908. This site was one of the highlights of the trip, and highlighted the contribution of Central Asia to math and science during the medieval period.\n\nAfter our day’s touring, we enjoyed dinner at Samarkand Restaurant, a huge venue with one dining area with an Uzbek theme and a smaller one with a Russian theme (in addition to party rooms and individual dining suites).\n\nThe establishment was brightly colored and loud with music and the festivities of parties going on throughout the venue (see the video below).\n\nOur hotel while in Samarkand, the Grand Samarkand Superior Hotel, was a small boutique hotel with a very nice breakfast, and beautiful rooms.\n\nMore about Samarkand from Britannica:\n\n“Samarqand is a city in east-central Uzbekistan that is one of the oldest cities of Central Asia. Known as Maracanda in the 4th century BCE, it was the capital of Sogdiana and was captured by Alexander the Great in 329 BCE. The city was later ruled by Central Asian Turks (6th century CE), the Arabs (8th century), the Samanids of Iran (9th–10th century), and various Turkic peoples (11th–13th century) before it was annexed by the Khwārezm-Shāh dynasty (early 13th century) and destroyed by the Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan (1220). After it revolted against its Mongol rulers (1365), Samarkand became the capital of the empire of Timur (Tamerlane), who made the city the most important economic and cultural centre in Central Asia. Samarkand was conquered by Uzbeks in 1500 and became part of the khanate of Bukhara. By the 18th century it had declined, and from the 1720s to the 1770s it was uninhabited. Only after it became a provincial capital of the Russian Empire (1887) and a railroad centre did it recover economically. It was briefly (1924–36) the capital of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. Samarkand today consists of an old city dating from medieval times and a new section built after the Russian conquest of the area in the 19th century.”\n\nDay Trip to Tajikistan\n\nThe morning of September 15 started with breakfast in the hotel restaurant. We were then driven to the border of Uzbekistan/Tajikistan. To get into Tajikistan we had to leave our guide and driver behind at the Uzbekistan border, walk to a fence where we showed our passports to a guard, walk though passport control to get the stamp showing that we were leaving Uzbekistan, walk to a guard to let us into the Tajikistan passport control area, get our day-bags scanned, walk through passport control to get a stamp showing our entry into Tajikistan, walk to another guard and show him our passports to allow us to enter Tajikistan, and then meet our guide and driver on the Tajikistan side of the border. The distance from start to finish is just over 1/2 mile and is mostly open, which made us feel like we were part of a prisoner exchange! But, we made it through without incident and met our guide, Barbad, and our driver, Devashtich.\n\nOur first decision was whether we wanted to drive to the Seven Lakes area, which would take about 4 hours total. Luckily we had a Toyota Prada (like a Land Rover) that was built for the trip, so we agreed it would be a great adventure. We started by driving through Penjikent, an ancient city on the Silk Road that was our ultimate destination for our day in Tajikistan. We drove for several miles southeast of Penjikent before turning south on a paved road. The paved road eventually turned to gravel, and then to rocks, and then to rocks on steep, narrow inclines. And, we’d only just begun our 4 hour journey.\n\nOn our way we experienced very rough driving conditions, charming remote villages, gasoline put in our vehicle using a bucket and a funnel, darling children in school uniforms, many donkeys, goats pretending to be mountain goats (or at least wishing they were), a security check as we entered the area of a gold mine administered by the Chinese, and road repair which delayed our journey until an excavator laid out a new road for us using the bucket on this large piece of machinery.\n\nAs to the lakes, they are found at the western edge of the Fan Mountains in the Shing Valley. The valley is known for its seven lakes, formed after an earthquake made a series of dams across the valley (or if you prefer, according to legend formed by seven beautiful but lovelorn daughters transforming into water to be at one with their tears).\n\nWhile were were able to get to only four of the seven lakes due to time limitations, their individual and collective beauty was breathtaking as each enjoyed a unique topography and color, due to the differing minerals running into each lake and the direction from which the light struck the water. After we finished taking pictures of all the lakes, we made our return journey to Penjikent, which did not seem to take as long as our journey to the fourth lake.\n\nWhile in Penjikent we first toured the local bazaar. We then ate a wonderful plov lunch, accompanied by fresh fruit, bread, and a tomato salad, at the local tourist center.\n\nWe then drove to the remains of the ancient Penjikent city, which existed from the 5th to the 8th centuries CE. We wandered the site, marveling at the size of the city given its age, and enjoyed the view over the modern city of Penjikent.\n\nMore about the ancient city of Penjikent:\n\nFounded over 2,500 years ago, the ancient city of Panjikent survived as a wealthy trading city in the Silk Road until the 8th century AD. The city, as told by historians, was inhabited by the Sogdian civilization who were skilled merchants and craftsmen. It is believed that at its peak, five to ten thousand people lived here. Evidence on site shows that merchants in Panjakent were in constant trade with India and China. The Sogdians were known for their excellent fur and fabrics. By exchanging luxury goods for silver articles, the city of Panjikent was able to develop a great level of wealth.\n\nWe next traveled to the Rudaki Historical Museum. We concluded our visit by stopping at the Sarazm Archaeological Site, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nMore about the ancient ruins at Sarazm:\n\nSarazm, which means “where the land begins”, is an archaeological site bearing testimony to the development of human settlements in Central Asia, from the 4th millennium BCE to the end of the 3rd millennium BCE. The ruins demonstrate the early development of proto-urbanization in this region. This centre of settlement, one of the oldest in Central Asia, is situated between a mountainous region suitable for cattle rearing by nomadic pastoralists, and a large valley conducive to the development of agriculture and irrigation by the first settled populations in the region. Sarazm also demonstrates the existence of commercial and cultural exchanges and trade relations with peoples over an extensive geographical area, extending from the steppes of Central Asia and Turkmenistan, to the Iranian plateau, the Indus valley and as far as the Indian Ocean.\n\nWe parted ways with Barbad and Devashtich and made our way back through the gauntlet that is the border between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. This time, however, we didn’t have to scan our bags….\n\nBack to Samarkand\n\nAfter rejoining Bek and Temur (our driver), we returned to our hotel for a brief rest before dinner. At 7 p.m., we were picked up and taken to Hanzade for dinner. This beautifully decorated restaurant was loud with music and busy with people, including one table of 20+ women of various generations. As has been typical on this trip thus far, we had tea, bread, salad, and wonderful entrees including a shrimp/salmon skewer and the “Aphrodite” chicken salad. All were wonderful dishes. As we learned as the evening progressed, the women at the large table were there to celebrate the birthday of a member of their group. And celebrate they did! The music was turned up, the cake was brought out, the birthday song was sung, and the women danced in the middle of the restaurant for probably 15 minutes! It was a joyous celebration and you couldn’t help but smile as this group of women helped celebrate another year around the sun for a friend. After dinner we jumped in the car and drove to Gur-e-Amir Mausoleum and to Registan Square for the light show displayed on the medressas surrounding the square. We stopped at the monument to Islam Karimov, independent Uzbekistan’s first president, received a brief history of the Registan Square, and then settled in for the one-half hour show, which was pure fun. The music was loud and the synchronized lights a joy to watch!\n\nThe next day, September 16, began with a daytime visit to each of the Gur-e-Amir Mausoleum and Registan Square.\n\nAbout the Gur-e-Amir Mausoleum:\n\n“The beautiful portal and trademark fluted azure dome of the Gur-e-Amir Mausoleum marks the final resting place of Timur (Tamerlane), along with two sons and two grandsons (including Ulugbek). It’s a surprisingly modest building, largely because Timur was never expecting to be buried here.\n\nTimur had built a simple crypt for himself at Shakhrisabz, and had this one built in 1404 for his grandson and proposed heir, Mohammed Sultan, who had died the previous year. But the story goes that when Timur died unexpectedly of pneumonia in Kazakhstan (in the course of planning an expedition against the Chinese) in the winter of 1405, the passes back to Shakhrisabz were snowed in and he was interred here instead.\n\nAs with other Muslim mausoleums, the stones are just markers; the actual crypts are in a chamber beneath. In the centre is Timur’s stone, once a single block of dark-green jade. In 1740 the warlord Nadir Shah carried it off to Persia, where it was accidentally broken in two – from which time Nadir Shah is said to have had a run of very bad luck, including the near death of his son. At the urging of his religious advisers he returned the stone to Samarkand and, of course, his son recovered.\n\nThe plain marble marker to the left of Timur’s is that of Ulugbek; to the right is that of Mir Said Baraka, one of Timur’s spiritual advisors. In front lies Mohammed Sultan. The stones behind Timur’s mark the graves of his sons Shah Rukh (the father of Ulugbek) and Miran Shah. Behind these lies Sheikh Seyid Umar, the most revered of Timur’s teachers, said to be a descendant of the Prophet Mohammed. Timur ordered Gur-e-Amir built around Umar’s tomb.\n\nThe Soviet anthropologist Mikhail Gerasimov opened the crypts in 1941 and, among other things, confirmed that Timur was tall (1.7m) and lame in the right leg and right arm (from injuries suffered when he was 25) – and that Ulugbek died from being beheaded. According to every tour guide’s favourite anecdote, he found on Timur’s grave an inscription to the effect that ‘whoever opens this will be defeated by an enemy more fearsome than I’. The next day, 22 June, Hitler attacked the Soviet Union.”\n\n– Lioy, Stephen; Kaminski, Anna; Mayhew, Bradley; Walker, Jenny. Lonely Planet Central Asia (Travel Guide) (pp. 605-606). Lonely Planet. Kindle Edition.\n\nThe Registan, “Sandy Place” in Tajik, was medieval Samarkand’s commercial center and was likely a wall-to-wall bazaar. The three medressas bordering the square are among the oldest preserved in Central Asia, any older having been destroyed by Chinggis (Genghis) Khan. The Uleg Bek Medressa on the western side is original, having been completed in 1420. Uleg Bek is said to have taught mathematics here. The stars on the portal reflect his love of astronomy. At the rear is a large mosque with a beautiful blue painted interior. The other two medressas are rough imitations by the Shaybanid Emir Yalangtush. The Ser Dor (Lion) Medressa on the eastern side was finished in 1636 and is decorated with roaring felines that look like tigers, but are meant to be lions. The lions, the deer they are chasing, and the Mongolian-faced, Zoroastrian-inspired suns rising from their backs are all unusual, flouting Islamic prohibitions against the depiction of live animals. In between is the Tilla-Kari (Gold-covered) Medressa, completed in 1660, with a pleasant, garden-like courtyard. The related mosque is intricately decorated with blue and gold to symbolize Samarkand’s wealth. The mosque’s ceiling is flat but its tapered design makes it look domed from the inside.\n\nFor lunch we ate at an outside cafe. The establishment was crowded, as seems to always be the case, but we quickly found a table in the shade of a tent. I ordered Montu, a boiled, meat filled wonton-type skin, while my wife ordered stuffed peppers in a broth. After lunch we visited the following sites:\n\nBibi-Khanym Mosque. Once one of the Islamic world’s mosques, it pushed contemporary construction techniques to the limit, so much so that the dome started crumbling even before construction had finished. Legend says that Bibi-Khanym, Timur’s Chinese wife, ordered the mosque built as a surprise while he was away. The architect fell in love with her and refused to finish the project unless he could give her a kiss. The kiss left a mark and Timur, seeing it, executed the architect and decreed that women should, from that point forward, wear veils so as not to tempt other men. The interior courtyard contains an enormous marble Qu’ran stand, as well as two smaller mosques.\n\nIslam Karimov mausoleum. Samarkand is known for its medieval mosques and mausoleums, but there is also a rather recent edition – the Mausoleum of the First President of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov. There are multiple quotes from the Qu’ran inscribed all around the mausoleum and the entrances. The complex was constructed after Karimov died from a stroke in 2016 during his 25th year as President, on his fourth seven-year term. Prior to presidency, he was the leader of the communist party in the Uzbek SSR. Besides the mausoleum, Samarkand also has a massive statue of him on the city’s center, just outside the UNESCO’s Registan (see photo above).\n\nShahizinda Islamic Tomb. This site provides an avenue of mausoleums, containing some of the richest tile work in the Muslim world, some dating to the 14th and 15th centuries.. The name, which means “Tomb of the Living King,” refers to its original, innermost an holiest shrine, a complex of cool quiet rooms around what is probably the grave of Qusam ibn-Abbas, who is said to have brought Islam to the area in the 7th century. One of the most beautiful tombs is the Shodi Mulk Oko Mausoleum (1372), the resting place of a sister and niece of Timur. The exquisite majolica and terracotta work here was of such exceptional quality that it merited almost no restoration.\n\nTomb of the Hebrew Prophet Daniel. This long, low structure is topped with five domes and contains an 18 meter long sarcophagus, it’s length due to the legend that Daniel’s body grows by one-half inch per year. As a result, the sarcophagus has been enlarged over the centuries. Daniel’s remains, which date from at least the 5th century BCE, were brought here by Timur from Susa, Iran, where another alleged tomb of Daniel can also be found.\n\nFor dinner we ate, with Bek and Temur, at Karimbek Restaurant. For this meal we had so much food, including water, tea, a large basket of bread, two salads/appetizers, a bowl of soup, and three main courses. All for $22. The food and service were good, as was the atmosphere.\n\nWe then drove to the train station, where we waited about an hour to board our 9 p.m., 1-1/2 hour train ride to Bukhara. We arrived at our hotel, Sasha and Son, at about 11 p.m., cleaned up and went to bed. The Sasha and Son hotel is a small, apparently family run, hotel with a lot of charm Our room was very large, and uniquely decorated. It was one of my favorite places to stay in terms of being quaint and unlike any other option.\n\nBukhara, Uzbekistan\n\nOur day today, September 17, began with a light breakfast, after which we began our exploring with a stop at the Samanid Mausoleum, the oldest Muslim monument and one of its most architecturally interesting. The structure was built in 905 for Ismail Samani, the founder of the Samanid dynasty, his father, and his grandson. It’s intricate terracotta brickwork disguises walls almost six feet thick, helping it largely survive restoration for 11 centuries.\n\nOn our way from the mosque to the local bazaar, we walked past a remaining section of the wall that surrounded Bukhara in ancient times.\n\nWe then were off to tour the following sites:\n\nChashma Mausoleum. The “Spring of Job” mausoleum dates from the 12th century. Legend has it that the prophet Job struck his staff on the ground here, causing a spring to appear whose water then cured him of his many boils and ulcers. Inside is a museum about water management in Bukhara (interesting given the competing interests for, and limited supply of, water in the region) and a tap where pilgrims drink from the spring. Just recall what happened to the Aral Sea and you’ll understand why this museum is interesting.\n\nArk of Bukhara. The Ark is Bukhara’s oldest structure, occupied from the 5th century up until 1920 when it was bombed by the Red Army. It served for years as the residence of the emirs of Bukhara. While it’s about 80% ruins, some royal quarters remain serving as interesting museums. The oldest surviving part of the Ark is the vast Reception and Coronation Court. The last coronation to take place was Alim Khan’s in 1910. Other areas of note include open-air royal stables and a room for drums and musical instruments used during public spectacles in the square below.\n\nToday we ate lunch at the house of the parents of our tour operator, Zulya Rajabova.\n\nZulya’s parents love to meet foreign travelers and are frequent hosts of her clients. In addition to plentiful, fabulous food prepared served by these wonderful hosts and other of Zulya’s relatives, we enjoyed dancing entertainment provided by one of Zulya’s nieces (age 7) and two of her nephews (ages 11 and 14). Following an exchange of gifts we returned to our vehicle to visit the Kalon Minaret and Mosque.\n\nAbout the Kolan Minaret:\n\nWhen it was built in 1127, the Kalon Minaret was probably the tallest building in Central Asia – kalon means ‘great’ in Tajik. It’s an incredible piece of work, 47 meters tall with 10 meter-deep foundations (including reeds stacked underneath in an early form of earthquake-proofing), and has stood for almost nine centuries. Chinggis (Genghis) Khan was so dumbfounded by it that he ordered it spared while his troops ransacked the rest of the city. The minaret is an architectural masterpiece. Its 14 ornamental bands, all different, include the first use of the glazed blue tiles that were to saturate Central Asia under the Timurids. Up and down the southern and eastern sides are faintly lighter patches, marking the restoration of damage caused by Soviet general Frunze’s artillery in 1920. At the foot of the minaret, on the site of an earlier mosque destroyed by Chinggis Khan, is the 16th-century congregational Kalon Mosque.\n\nWe then returned to our hotel to rest for a few minutes before walking to a nearby traditional folk dancing and fashion show at Nodir Devonbegi Madrasah.\n\nWe then enjoyed dinner at Bella Italia where our meals consisted of spinach ravioli, Caesar Salad, and a 4-cheese pizza. There was bread too. So much bread!\n\nOur September 18 began with a visit to Sitorai Moh Khossa, the summer palace. It is located 3.5 miles to the north of Bukhara and belonged to the last governing emir of Bukhara Said Alimkhan (1911-1920). The name of the palace means “stars meet the moon”. The three-building compound incorporates elements of both Russian and traditional Bukharan architecture. Highlights included peacocks, beautiful tile fireplaces, a turtle in the “Swimming pool”.\n\nWe then began our 6.5 hour drive through the desert to Khiva. Highlights of our journey included:\n\nEndless miles of sand.\n\nA natural gas pipeline under construction.\n\nWild horses.\n\nAn abandoned Soviet checkpoint on the highway.\n\nSome of the worst highway road conditions I’ve ever seen due to ongoing construction begun by the Germans 10 years ago and taken over in recent years by the Chinese. According to our guide, while the pace of construction has improved, the quality has suffered.\n\nSeveral restaurants or gas stations that were dilapidated, closed, or both, which led to great difficulty in finding a working toilet, particularly a western style toilet. In our effort to find such a toilet, over a span of probably one and one-half hours we:\n\nstopped at a restaurant that was closed (although Bek and I did receive bites from several small, but potent, mosquitos); a gas station that was closed, but whose caretaker told us we could use the restrooms but, since they had no water, we’d have to use a nearby water jug to flush the toilets (by the way, they were disgustingly dirty so went unused by us); and a restaurant that was open but that had only eastern style toilets.\n\nencountered a long line of vehicles that had been waiting at a railroad crossing for over an hour in anticipation of a train they had been told was imminent (the train arrived approximately 20 minutes after we arrived; it consisted of the engine only. See the photo below. Also, praise for our driver, Zafar, who adeptly positioned us towards the front of the long line of cars and trucks that had stopped for the train so we could get ahead of the trucks which would have seriously slowed our progress to Khiva. Also, because the roads from the bridge westward were so badly potholed, drivers were often driving on the wrong side of the road looking for the smoothest path. It was like bumper cars at the state fair, but without the bumping.\n\nstopped at yet another store that had only eastern toilets.\n\ndrove 10 minutes or so down some very bumpy, dusty dirt roads to find a hotel that appeared on Google maps but did not, in fact, exist (when we asked a local where we could find the hotel, she simply told us there was no such building).\n\nlocated a “camping hotel” that finally allowed us to use a western style toilet within the hotel.\n\nKhiva, Uzbekistan\n\nWe arrived at our hotel at approximately 6 p.m., filled the laundry sack with 20 items, and handed it to our receptionist. The laundry was done 2 hours later at a cost of approximately $13! The hotel is a beautiful complex. In this hotel we had a 2-room suite, which was not expected. The resort has a pool, a bar, restaurant, etc. The grounds were lovely with tiled walkways, lots of green space, and herbs and vegetables planted among the trees in the green space, presumably for the kitchen.\n\nAt 7 p.m. we walked into the old city of Khiva and ate at a restaurant called the “Terrassa Cafe and More.” The view from the resturant was spectacular! We each had the Dill Noodle dinner, a local dish. We then walked back to the hotel and, because my wife had been under the weather, she went promptly to bed. I stayed up to read about the sites in Khiva in preparation or the day ahead.\n\nAbout Khiva, the museum under the sky, from TripAdvisor:\n\nWhen you enter the 2,500-year-old city of Khiva you travel back in time to an earlier millenium – a land of caravanserais built to quench the thirst of travelling silk traders and madrassahs filled with young students studying the Koran. Khiva – the exotic and undiscovered masterpieces in the desert. Like an oasis in the sand, the city of Khiva is remarkably well kept – aquamarine tiles line the 800-year-old minarets and ancient stones pave the streets. Every corner you turn is another exotic angle. The Khan’s palace is a labyrinth of courtyards and hidden rooms and you’ll have the day to explore this enormous open-air museum.\n\nThis morning of September 19 we met Bek in the lobby at 10 a.m. and began our tour of Khiva. We began by walking along the outside of Itchan Kala. Our hotel is located just outside the south gate, so we walked around to the west gate so we could buy tickets for the various museums within the old city.\n\nWhile in the city today we toured the following sites:\n\nMohammed Amin Madrassa. This madrassa is currently occupied by, and run as, the Khiva Madrassah Hotel. The madrassah was built in 1851-1855 years and reconstructed in the year 2000. There are 40 rooms in the hotel, typically very small as they were the rooms used for teaching while the building functioned as a madrassah. It’s important to note that the rooms on the main floor are very dark as there are no windows and, hence, no natural light.\n\nKalta Minor Minaret. This minaret was begun in 1851 by Mohammed Amin Khan who, according to legend, wanted to build a minaret so tall he could see all the way to Bukhara. Unfortunately, the khan died in 1855 leaving the minaret unfinished.\n\nKunya Ark, an ancient fortress of Khiva, and one of the khan’s palaces in Itchan Kala. It was first built in the 12th century by Ok Shaykh Bobo, then expanded by the khans in the 17th century The khans’ harem, mint, stables, arsenal, barracks, mosque and jail were all here. The most interesting rooms in the palace include (1) the throne room, which included a raised, circular dais where the Royal Yurt would be constructed even though the khans were no longer nomadic, and (2) the watchtower, which provides a stellar view over the top of the city.\n\nAnd now a bit of history for the area:\n\nMuhammad Rahim Kahn II (1864 – 1910) was a philosopher and poet, popularly known under the pen name as Firuz. He became the first to introduce lithography to Central Asia in 1874. More than 20 madrases, mosques, and minarets were built in Khorezm under his leadership. In total, there were 126 madrases and 165 Korikhona (schools of Qu’ran readers). Most of the architectural monuments of the city were built during his reign.\n\nJuma Mosque, a 10th – 18th century mosque in Khiva, Uzbekistan. It is one of the principal monuments of Itchan Kala, the walled old city of Khiva, which is a World Heritage Site. It stands in the middle of Itchan Kala, on the road connecting the west gate (Ota darvoza) and the east gate (Polvon darvoza). The mosque was first documented in the 10th century, but it was rebuilt in 1788. It is a large one-story brick building with a flat roof, supported by 212 wooden columns in 17 rows. Its total size is 55 x 46 meters, and its minaret is 42 meters high\n\nFor dinner, we returned to Terrassa, the balcony from which we enjoyed a beautiful sunset.\n\nWe also had the opportunity to watch local residents bake bread using the community bread oven located below on the edge of the square adjacent to the restaurant. The process includes the placement of a circle of dough on a slightly mounded piece of leather (or cloth of some sort) with a glove attached to the back of it. The dough is then sprinkled with water, lowered into the oven, and slapped to the side of the oven and freed from the gloved, domed transfer vehicle. The bread bakes while clinging to the side of the oven until the person monitoring it decides it’s done. It is then pried off the side of the oven to make room for the next disk. This night the people baking must have been a neighborhood group or baking for a small business as they baked multiple batches of bread over the span of several hours. We then walked back to the hotel for the night.\n\nOn September 20, we began our day with a small breakfast at the hotel. Met Bek at 9 a.m. to tour a museum describing the first school in Khiva, built in 1940, that educated both boys and girls. We then visited the following sites:\n\nSaid Islam Khodja Madrassa. The Islam Khodja complex stands to the southeast of the main east-west street in Khiva’s Ichan Kala (old city) and includes a madrasa and minaret. Although it was built fairly recently it was constructed according to traditional principles in exacting detail, and its level of craftsmanship is among the highest in the city. The site is named after Islam Khodja, the grand vizier (and also first cousin) of Muhammad Rahmi Bahadur II, the ruler of the Khanate of Khiva from 1864-1910. Islam Khodja was a modernizer who introduced new amenities to the city including a hospital, telegraph office, and non-parochial schools. Although he lived long enough to see the complex completed, he was stabbed to death in 1913.\n\nPahlavon Mahmud Tomb and adjacent cemetary. Pahlavan Mahmud was an Iranian poet and wrestler who lived from 1247-1326. Also known as Puria-ye-Wali, Mahmud was lionized as the paragon of Iranian chivalry (javanmardi) and esteemed for his literary and athletic accomplishments. Although he was not strictly a religious figure, his tomb became a popular place of pilgrimage in both Khoy (in Iran) and Khiva (in Uzbekistan), both of which claimed Mahmud as their own.\n\nMadrasah Shergazi Khan. It was built in the XVIII century, located in the centre of Ichan Kala. According to legend, madrasah was built by slaves for one year, captured by Shergazi-Khan during the attack of Khorasan and Meshhed. After the construction, Shergazi-Khan promised to free captives, but his promise wasn’t kept. As a result, infuriated prisoners killed Shergazi-khan in his own unfinished madrasah.\n\nNurullabay Palace. The palace is located in Dishan-Kale – the outer city of Khiva and is famous for its magnificence, beauty and charm. The palace differs from other palaces built by other khans in different periods. During the reign of Muhammad Rahim Khan I, the old city (now Itchan Kala) was already crowded due to the large number of houses built there and it was impossible to build large palaces with gardens there. So, Muhammad Rahim Khan I ordered to build for his sons Mahmud-tyurya and Muhammad-tyurya country palaces “howli” (made of rammed clay blocks) to the west of the city (Itchan-Kala) walls.\n\nBesh Khovli Complex. Tash-Hovli — a palace complex in Khiva, the main palace of the Khivan khans. The palace was located in east part of Khiva built by Allakuli-hanom. Construction of the palace took about 8 years, from 1830 to 1838. The first built the residential quarter of a harem, then mekhmonkhon — the place for formal receptions, and the last — an arzkhona, the courtroom.\n\nAyaz Kala in desert north of Urgench. The Khorezm Fortresses, or Elliq Qala in Uzbek, are a collection of more than 50 desert fortresses in Karakalpakstan and the Khorezm Region of Uzbekistan. They were built on the edge of the Kizilkum Desert at different points between the fourth century BCE and the seventh century CE as a means of protection from nomad raids. Ayaz Kala is an archeological site with three fortresses, the earliest of which dates from the 4th century BCE. The footprint of the best preserved fortress is huge, measuring 182×152 meters. Some of the remaining sections of wall are 10 meters high, with regularly spaced towers. There is a massive gateway, battlements with crenellated tops, ramparts, and the remains of vaulted ceilings.\n\nWe were then taken to the airport in Urgench for our late night flight to Tashkent, arriving at approximately 1 a.m. on September 21. We were transferred in the late morning to the Tashkent Airport for our flight to Almaty, Kazakhstan for the next chapter in our journey.\n\nAlmaty, Kazakhstan\n\nWe were met at the Almaty airport by our guide, Alma, and our driver, Davlet. After checking in and cleaning up, we walked to the Navat Restaurant near our Rixos hotel.\n\nAs in Uzbekistan, more food was ordered than we could possibly eat.\n\nFirst, a little bit about Kazakhstan:\n\nThe world’s ninth-biggest country is the most economically advanced of the ‘Stans’, thanks to its abundant reserves of oil and most other valuable minerals. This means generally better standards of accommodation, restaurants and transport than elsewhere in Central Asia. The biggest city, Almaty, is almost reminiscent of Europe with its leafy avenues, glossy shopping centers and hedonistic nightlife.\n\nOn September 22, I was under the weather and unable to participate in the tour. The remainder of the group, however, took in the following sites:\n\nGreen Bazaar. This clean, organized, and colorful bazaar provides a broad array of tastes and smells from Asia. There are delineated sections for meats, bread, spices, herbs, vegetables, nuts, dried fruits, and more. The lamb heads and horse meat sections are a must-see.\n\nCentral State Museum. Almaty’s best museum takes you through Kazakhstan’s history from Bronze Age burials and nomadic culture to WWII sacrifices, telecommunications and the transfer of the capital to Astana, with many beautiful artefacts on display. A large replica of the Golden Man (a national symbol of Kazakhstan; a 3rd- or 4th-century warrior whose gold-clad remains were uncovered in 1969) stands in the entrance hall. The museum also includes a traditional yurt showing the lodging used by the nomads in the area.\n\nKök-Töbe Hill. This 1100 meter hill on the city’s south edge is crowned by a 372 meter-high TV tower visible from far and wide, and affords great views over the city and the mountains. Accessed by a cable car, the top of the hill provides an assortment of attractions, including a ropes course, a small zoo containing some beautiful birds, and an amusement park.\n\nThe adventurers then had dinner at Tyubetegika, a highly-rated restaurant known for its local cuisine. Thankfully, they brought some food back to the hotel so I could enjoy a meal as well.\n\nOn September 23, we began by driving south towards the Zailiyskiy Alatau mountains, which form the border between Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Within the mountain range is the Medeu Skating Rink and ski resort, which offers a great location to view the mountains, enjoy a scenic vista over the city of Almaty, and enjoy a cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate. After riding the gondolas to the top of the ski resort, wandering around to take pictures, and playing in the snow, we returned to our vehicle and the city.\n\nAfter a lunch of Dolmades and a sausage pita, we headed to Panfilov Park, named in honor of Kazakh soldiers who perished in various wars during the 20th century, including in World War II when they fought to defend Moscow. The park also holds the Ascension Cathedral, a beautiful Russian Orthodox Church made completely of wood and without nails.\n\nWe also visited the Museum of Folk Musical Instruments, which contained an impressive of historical instruments including mouth harps, violins, traditional Kazakh instruments such as wooden harps and horns, bagpipes, the lute-like two-stringed dombra and the viola-like kobyz. We next visited the Independence Monument, a stone column topped with a replica Golden Man standing on a winged snow leopard. Around its base are statues of a Kazakh family; behind is a semicircular wall of low-relief bronze sculptures depicting scenes from Kazakhstan’s history, from Golden Man times at the left end to President Nazarbayev at the right.\n\nOn September 24, we enjoyed a small breakfast at the hotel and began driving from Almaty to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. This involved taking our luggage and walking through passport control on both the Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan sides of the border, as well as Kyrgyzstan customs. In the meantime, our driver had to take the vehicle through the same process. We met up on the Kyrgyzstan side of the border and made our way to the city. We began our day’s tour with a stop at Victory Square, which features a dome-like structure with only three supports, meant to symbolize the supports of yurt. The structure sits above an eternal flame commemorating the 40th anniversary of the end of WWII.\n\nWe then proceeded to Ala Too Square, which includes a triumphant statue of Айкол Манас (Mighty Manas). Bishkek’s nominal center has a photogenic quality – especially when slowly goose-stepping soldiers change the guard beside the soaring national flagpole.\n\nBehind the guard’s station is the newly renovated National Historical Museum, which contains literally thousands of exhibits about the cultural heritage of the Kyrgyz people, whose sculptures and objects date from antiquity to the end of the 20th century.\n\nBehind the museum is Bishkek’s statue of Lenin, recently moved from prominent Ala Too Square to its more remote, current location. We then checked into our hotel, had dinner, and retired for the night.\n\nThis morning, September 25, we packed up and headed towards Issyk Kul, the world’s second largest alpine lake (the largest is Lake Titicaca located in South America). The lake is approximately 108 miles long, 36 miles wide, and around 2,100 feet deep at its deepest point. Our destination, the Karven Four Seasons Resort, is a popular summer destination for both Kazakh and Russian vacationers. On the way, however, we first stopped at a UNESCO Heritage Site which includes the ruins of ancient Balasagun City, a medieval settlement founded in the early tenth century. The most noticeable structure at this site is the Burana Tower, a medieval minaret made of fired brick. It is considered to be the earliest surviving minaret in Central Asia. Followers of Islam, Syro-Nestorianism, and Buddhism lived in Balasagun, which was an important stop on the Silk Roads and a place of intercultural exchange.\n\nAfter returning to our vehicle, we stopped for lunch at a small restaurant along the road paralleling Issyk Kul. We then continued on to our resort, checked in, and drove 15 – 20 minutes for a scheduled horse ride by the lake. While Paula decided not to embark on the ride, Davlet and I mounted our trusty steeds and followed the owner of the horses for a 1-hour ride. My horse, Erika, was a 9-year old filly, while Davlet’s was a 23-year old Nomad Games champion. Kyrgyzstan, by the way, is the resounding Nomad Games champion, a designation of which the residents are very proud.\n\nWe then returned to the resort and went for a walk. While simple by US standards, the resort is beautifully landscaped, has a beautiful waterfront, and a spectacular view of the mountains on the other side of the lake. After our walk we met our guide and driver for dinner at the resort restaurant. We were the only people in the restaurant, which supported our suspicion that we were two of very few guests at the resort. I suspect that was a consequence of the timing of our trip.\n\nToday, September 26, we checked out of our resort and drove east until we reached the town of Grigoryevka, at which point we turned north into a national park (see map).\n\nWe drove through the beautiful gorge until it opened up into a pasture-like area, at which point we turned east.\n\nAfter a few miles, we stopped for a demonstration of Golden Eagle hunting by a local hunter and two of his eagles. The female eagles are captured when they are young and trained for two years. For purposes of our demonstration, the eagle was taken a hundred yards away by one handler while the other carried a live rabbit to a site in an open area. Upon a signal, the eagle was released and the 2nd handler walked away from the rabbit. Within minutes, the eagle was on the rabbit and killing it through suffocation. Typically, the hunter would take the prey from the eagle, but today the eagle was allowed to enjoy the fruits of her labor.\n\nWe the returned to our vehicle and drove back to the highway while observing yaks, cows, donkeys, horses, goats, and sheep along the way.\n\nAfter lunch, we headed back to Bishkek. Upon arrival in the city, we headed to the Osh Bazaar, the most central bazaar in Bishkek, to do some shopping for souvenirs.\n\nWe then returned to our hotel, cleaned up, and went to dinner with Alma and Davlet at Pishpek restaurant. In addition to enjoying a wonderful last dinner in Central Asia, Alma had arranged for a birthday cake for Paula to celebrate her birthday (the reason for the trip, after all). We had a fun evening celebrating time with our new friends, and returned to the hotel for our last night in Kyrgyzstan.\n\nToday, September 27, we left early for the airport and bade goodbye to Davlet and\n\nAlma. Our flights to Istanbul was uneventful, although we had to literally run through the new, very large airport to get to our connecting flight. The flight to Amsterdam was also uneventful, although our flight from Amsterdam to Minneapolis on September 28 was canceled, resulting an additional day in Amsterdam. In any event, we finally made it home at 8 p.m. on Friday, September 29, after 24 days on the road.\n\nRecommended Books\n\n“Lonely Planet Central Asia (Travel Guide), Kindle Edition“, by Stephen Lioy, Anna Kaminski, Bradley Mayhew, and Jenny Walker. Thanks to this guide in particular as it helped tremendously with some of the descriptions herein.\n\n“The Great Game: The Struggle for Empire in Central Asia” by Peter Hopkirk.\n\n“The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia” by Rene Grousset.\n\nIn addition to the books recommended above, let me also recommend AbeBooks, a website where you can find high quality used books at significantly reduced prices.\n\nTrip Statistics\n\nNumber of countries visited: 5\n\nNumber of flights: 11\n\nNumber of hotels: 9\n\nTime zone difference: 10/11 hours, depending on location.\n\nOther Interesting Observations\n\nThere are many, many different spellings for the names of people and places (e.g., Uleg Bek, Ulegbbek, and Uleg-Bek). While I’ve tried to be consistent throughout this blog, they were times where I chose to leave a variant as it was within a summary from an external source. My apologies for any confusion this may cause.\n\nThe further we moved from urban centers, eastern-style toilets became more prominent.\n\nThe vast majority of the population in the Stans are Muslim, although the extent to which the faith is followed varies by location and individual.\n\nTea and bread was served at every meal. And, every meal was huge! Ensuring guests are satisfied at meals appears to be a big part of hospitality in Central Asia.\n\nBottled water was highly recommended for consumption as the tap water could invoke “Temur’s Revenge” (Gary’s name for traveller’s diarrhea in Central Asia, AKA “Montezuma’s Revenge” in Mexico).\n\nThe traffic in the urban areas was very, very heavy. I shudder to think how much time we spent at stop lights in Tashkent, Samarkand, Almaty, and Bishkek. I would not, under any circumstances, rent a car in any of these cities.\n\nDespite several warnings about being prepared to be stopped by the police, it never occurred for us, and the “police presence” seemed lighter than we expected.\n\nAnd, Because We All Like Food….\n\nIn Closing, My Thanks\n\nMy thanks to all the various travel guides and contributors to the multitude of websites that address the various facets of Central Asia. I have borrowed from their research and summaries to make this private blog as interesting as possible through descriptions and historical context. And, thank you for reading this blog. If you’ve made it this far, I am truly impressed by your dedication!\n\nThis blog entry describes, on a day-by-day basis, our recent 31-day visit to Costa Rica! But, for those of you who just want the basics, here’s an executive summary.\n\nWe stayed three nights at Nayara Springs resort near the Arenal volcano. This is in the rainforest so is much greener than along the Pacific coast which was then in its dry season. We next stayed 28 nights at Bahia Pez Vela, a resort south of Playas del Coco, a small town on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Our lodging at both locations was exactly what wanted for each part of the trip.\n\nThree sets of couples joined us: R & J, R2 & J2, and B & K. For purposes of their privacy their names are not used in the blog. We thoroughly enjoyed their visits as we enjoyed together fellowship, food, and card/dice games!\n\nWe did not rent a car as they are very expensive in Costa Rica. Instead, we had nearly a dozen tours lined up, all of which included transportation, and taxis were available if we wanted to go somewhere.\n\nWe ate a lot of food at a lot of good restaurants. The Maracuya Beach Club (“Maracuya”; Maracuya means Passion Fruit) located at the resort was the best of all of them. Consequently, and because of its convenience, we ate at Maracuya more than 20 times. We periodically ate in the villa, usually breakfast.\n\nThe tours we took were fantastic, both in the Arenal area and from Bahia Pez Villa (thank you Shaman Tours)! We experienced unique animals, plants, topography, micro-climates, and food. We also got to swim in volcano heated pools, swim in a blue river tinted by minerals from the volcano, and take a mud bath!\n\nSo much for the summary. Now for the agonizing detail, Internet links, and pictures!\n\nSunday, February 12\n\nFlew out early from MSP (7:54 a.m. departure). Flight was fairly smooth. Arrived at Liberia, Costa Rica (LIR) a little bit early. Met our driver (Miguel) who drove us approximately 2.75 hours to Nayara Springs (NS). The first 1/2 of the drive is fairly flat and straight. Then, you hit the mountains where the wind generators are found. In the midst of the mountains is Lake Arenal, a 19 mile long and approx 3 mile wide man-made lake (the biggest in Central America). The lake is utilized to create hydroelectric power for the country, and creates from 15 – 30 percent of the country’s energy, depending on who is telling you about the lake.\n\nUpon arrival at NS at approximately 4:30 p.m., we went through a check-in process and were then whisked away to Villa 35, our home for the next 3 nights. The villa was beautiful, well-appointed, and spacious. Breakfast, yoga, and most things in the mini bar were complimentary. This night we had a 6:30 dinner reservation at the onsite Italian restaurant Mis Amore. The food was very good. P ordered a table pasta which involved the preparation of the dish in a large cheese wheel using a blowtorch, a massive spoon, and previously cooked pasta! We then went back to the room to enjoy the private deck with an infinity whirlpool.\n\nMonday, February 13\n\nWe began our day with breakfast delivered to our room. We then met our tour guide at the reception area for a 1/2 day hanging bridge tour at Mistico Park. This tour involved a several hour walk through the rainforest on paths, fixed bridges, and 6 hanging bridges. The hanging bridges varied in height and length, but each was a cable suspension bridge with an aluminum walkway, chain link sides, and cables for suspension. Some were as long as several hundred meters and 30+ meters above the valley floor. We were shown several examples of snakes, birds, and insects, as well as of trees and plants. Our tour guide was a young man named Gustavo, a birder who expressed a keen interest in one day spotting the Great Grey Owl in Minnesota. We exchanged contact information in the event he is able to get a visit to visit the US and does, in fact, make his way to Minnesota. At the conclusion of the tour, we ate lunch with our guide and driver in the picnic area of the park. The lunches had been prepared by the NS kitchens, and included sandwiches and, in my case, a Nordic bagel with Smoked Trout.\n\nAfter our tour we returned to our villa to enjoy the whirlpool and to rest. We later ventured out to explore the resort a little bit. At 5:30 we then returned to the reception area where we met David, our guide for a Night Walk Tour, which involved walking through the rainforest with flashlights to spot frogs, insects, and whatever else we might stumble upon. During this 2 hour journey we saw the famous red-eyed tree frog, several other species of frogs, several insects, and many impressive spiders. After the walk we returned to NS for our dinner at the onsite restaurant Amor Loco, a plush lounge with dark wood furniture and velvety cushions and chairs. There was live music performed by a single musician, and the frogs were chirping merrily. The food was, once again, very good and the service was top-notch.\n\nTuesday, February 14\n\nToday we booked no tours until early afternoon. Our breakfast was delivered at 10:30, and consisted of an omelette, Nordic Bagle, fresh bread, fruit and juices. We met our tour guide at 1:55 p.m. in the reception area. Melanie, a 27 year old native Costa Rican, first took us to a harbor on Lake Arsenal for a brief boat ride, during which we discovered wildlife long the shore of the lake (e.g., herons, Cormorants) and enjoyed beautiful scenery of the rainforest and the Arenal Volcano, an active volcano that experienced its last major eruption in 1968.\n\nAfter the boat ride we traveled in our van to a private park that provides hiking trails at the base of the volcano, including walking over some of the lava flows from the 1968 eruption. We chose the trail of nearly 2 miles in length, which took almost 2 hours to complete. The trail is the closest you can legally get to the volcano, and provided some great views of the volcano, the lake and the surrounding rainforest. Melanie provided us with a great deal of information related to the history of the volcano, the property on which the park sits (which was devastated by the volcano’s eruption), and the flora and fauna found within the park. Her description of the leaf-cutting ants and their nest was particularly interesting.\n\nAfter our tour we returned to NS for our last night at the resort. Our dinner was not scheduled until 8 p.m., so we took yet another dip in the whirlpool and began organizing our things for departure the next morning. At about 7:30 we began walking to Ayla Restaurant, a Mediterranean-themed restaurant located in the adjacent sister-resort, Nayara Tented Camp. As we began walking we realized that the trails were quite dark given the environment, and that we had no flashlight with us. Just as we were turning around to return to our villa to get a flashlight, a resort golf cart appeared and offered to take us to the restaurant. We happily accepted and, after seeing the ups and downs of the trails to the restaurant, were glad we did. The paths were very steep at times a"
