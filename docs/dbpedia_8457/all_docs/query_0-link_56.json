        "text": "The Holy Savior Cathedral (Armenian: ÕÕ¸ÖÖÕ¢ Ô±Õ´Õ¥Õ¶Õ¡ÖÖÕ¯Õ«Õ¹ ÕÕ¡Õ¶Ö â Surb Amenaprkich Vank; Persian: Ú©ÙÛØ³Ø§Û Ø¢Ù ÙØ§Ù¾Ø±Ú©ÛÚ â KelisÄ ye ÄmenÄperkiÄ), also known the Church of the Saintly Sisters, is a cathedral located in the New Julfa district of Isfahan, Iran. It is commonly referred to as the Vank (ÕÕ¡Õ¶Ö; ÙØ§ÙÚ©), which means \"monastery\" or \"convent\" in the Armenian language.\n\nHistory\n\nThe cathedral was established in 1606, built by the hundreds of thousands of Armenians who were forcibly resettled by Shah Abbas I in his new capital as part of his scorched-earth policy in Armenia during the Ottoman War of 1603-1618.[1]\n\nThe varying fortunes and independence of this suburb across the Zayande River and its eclectic mix of European missionaries, mercenaries and travelers can be traced almost chronologically in the cathedral's combination of building styles and contrasts in its external and internal architectural treatment.\n\nConstruction\n\nThe construction is believed to have begun in 1606 by the first arrivals,[1] and completed with major alterations to design between 1655 and 1664 under the supervision of Archbishop David. The cathedral consists of a domed sanctuary, much like an Iranian mosque, but with the significant addition of a semi-octagonal apse and raised chancel usually seen in western churches. The cathedral's exteriors are in relatively modern brickwork and are exceptionally plain compared to its elaborately decorated interior.\n\nFrescos\n\nThe interior is covered with fine frescos and gilded carvings and includes a wainscot of rich tile work. The delicately blue and gold painted central dome depicts the Biblical story of the creation of the world and man's expulsion from Eden. Pendentives throughout the church are painted with a motif of a cherub's head surrounded by folded wings typical of Armenian art. The ceiling above the entrance is painted with delicate floral motifs in the style of Persian miniature. Two sections, or bands, of murals run around the interior walls: the top section depicts events from the life of Jesus, while the bottom section depicts tortures inflicted upon Armenian martyrs by the Ottoman Empire.\n\nInterior of the Cathedral\n\nCeiling of the Holy Savior Cathedral\n\nDepiction of Heaven, Earth, and Hell inside the Holy Savior Cathedral\n\nInterior view of the Holy Savior Cathedral\n\nInterior view of the Holy Savior Cathedral\n\nCourtyard\n\nThe courtyard contains a large freestanding belfry towering over the graves of both Orthodox and Protestant Christians. The graves include those of Sir George Malcolm, an English army officer, Alexander Decover, Russian consul and banker, and Andrew Jukes, English surgeon and agent of the British government.[2] A tile work plaque inscribed in Armenian can be seen by the entrance to the cathedral. Graves are also placed along the exterior wall before the entrance, with inscriptions in Armenian. In one corner of the courtyard, there is a raised area with a memorial to the 1915 Armenian genocide in Turkey. Across the courtyard and facing the cathedral, there is a building housing a library and museum. Outside of this building are several carved stones showing scenes from the Bible.\n\nAn old photograph of the Holy Savior Cathedral from the 1930s\n\nEntrance of the courtyard\n\nThe cathedral\n\nThe courtyard of the Holy Savior Cathedral\n\nEntrance of the Holy Savior Cathedral\n\nVank Cathedral at night\n\nSee also\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Vank Cathedral.\n\nNew Julfa\n\nFereydan\n\nHoly Saviour Monastery of Old Julfa\n\nReferences\n\nMore Photos, Tishineh"
