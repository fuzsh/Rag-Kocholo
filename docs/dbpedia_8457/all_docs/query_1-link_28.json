The deaths of three others were also reported as suspicious and linked to femicide. The motives for 11 cases were cited as “honour-related,” eight cases involve “family disputes” or divorce requests. The motives for the murders of three women remain unclear.\n\nOut of the confirmed 23 cases, 10 were killed with firearms, nine through strangulation, one by burning, one with a knife, and one with hammer blows. The method of killing for one victim is unknown. The perpetrators were all close family members, including fathers, brothers, husbands, ex-husbands, and relatives such as cousins.\n\nEight of the victims were single, and 14 were married. One had separated from her husband. Seven of the confirmed cases of femicide, and one suspicious case, involved victims under the age of 18, with six of them being victims of child marriage and forced marriage.\n\nSix of the murdered women resided in urban areas, while 17 lived in rural areas. By provincial distribution, 10 victims were from West Azerbaijan Province, eight from Kermanshah Province, four from Kurdistan Province, and one from Ilam Province.\n\nThe KHRN has been able to directly document, through its own sources or by referencing other credible sources, 23 cases of femicide and three suspicious deaths of women:\n\nFirouzeh Moradi, a 26-year-old from Kermanshah, was killed in January 2023 during a family dispute, stabbed by her brother.

On 1 October 2023, the 17-year-old encountered an assault by government agents, commonly known as the morality police, on the Shohada Metro line in Tehran for not wearing a hijab. Following the blow to her head, she lost consciousness.\n\nSince the transfer of their daughter to a military hospital and the widespread dissemination of news about Geravand’s beatings by government agents in Tehran’s Shohada Metro line due to her hijab, her family was under the control and pressure of security forces. They were even forced to participate in television interviews to deny the news of their daughter’s beating by government agents.\n\nAfter announcing the news of Geravand’s death, the Islamic Republic first took her body hostage, preventing its transfer for burial in Kermanshah, her birthplace or Kuhdasht, the residence of her paternal and maternal relatives. The funeral ceremony in Tehran was also heavily controlled by security forces, resulting in the detention of dozens of people, including Geravand’s relatives, families of protesters killed during last year’s anti-government protests, and civil and political activists.\n\nArrests, sentences, political prisoners\n\nIn continuation of this report, we will take a look at instances of arrests, prison sentences, and dismissals for Kurdish women activists, as well as the situation of Kurdish women political prisoners from November 25, 2022, to November 25, 2023.\n\nIn the past year, at least 39 Kurdish women have been arrested by security forces in various cities in Kurdistan on various charges. Different sentences have been issued for 16 Kurdish women, with three Kurdish women being transferred to prison for the execution of sentences, and at least four Kurdish women being expelled from their jobs due to political or labour activities."
