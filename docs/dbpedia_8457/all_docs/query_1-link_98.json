Articles submitted for publication are subject to review by the editors and/or outside readers. Manuscripts should be no more than 40 double-spaced typed pages of text (not including endnotes) and have no more than 15-20 illustrations. Exceptions can be made for articles dealing with unpublished visual or textual primary sources, but if they are particularly long, they may be divided into two or more parts for publication in successive volumes. Both text and endnotes should be double-spaced; endnotes should conform to the usage of the Chicago Manual of Style. Illustrations should be labeled and accompanied by a double-spaced caption list. Authors are responsible for obtaining permission to reproduce copyrighted illustrations and for supplying the proper credit-line information.

That special volume, conceived to pay tribute to Oleg on his retirement from Harvard, was published in 1993. A few years ago, over an excellent lunch (food and conviviality often bring Oleg to mind), a small subset of the Muqarnas editorial committee—namely, Gülru Necipoqlu and Julia Bailey—noted that Oleg’s so-called retirement had in no way diminished his intellectual productivity or inspirational status. We concurred that the time had arrived to pay tribute to our former teacher—who, with his eightieth birthday (in 2009) on the horizon, was now a senior scholar in every sense—by preparing a second honorary volume of Muqarnas, to be published ﬁfteen years after the ﬁrst. We found it particularly appropriate that the publication date would coincide with the thirtieth anniversary of the Aga Khan Program of Islamic Architecture, whose Harvard branch Oleg was instrumental in founding. It is largely thanks to the broad scope of this program, the parameters of which were established in 1978, that courses taught at Harvard and MIT in the ﬁeld of Islamic art and architecture have transcended their former narrow, medieval focus to encompass the early modern and modern periods in addition to a broader cultural geography.\n\nTo lend unity to the contents of the volume and show Oleg’s resounding impact on the expansion of the ﬁeld we adopted the subtitle Frontiers of Islamic Art and Architecture: Essays in Celebration of Oleg Grabar’s Eightieth Birthday. The project couldn’t be a surprise: we needed Oleg’s guidance in choosing who among his many admirers and beneﬁciaries should be invited to submit an essay. It was he, then, who came up with a list of potential contributors, which he limited to former students and past or recent colleagues. He also expressed the wish that submissions should relate to his scholarship and interests or in some way reﬂect a personal connection to him; we therefore asked authors to “engage directly with some aspect of Oleg’s work, whether the subject be a monument or object, a theme, a problem, or a methodology that he has addressed in his publications.” Not everyone invited was free to contribute, and the prior commitments of those who couldn’t—books to ﬁnish, departments to run, exhibitions to organize and catalogue, museums to direct—in themselves testify to the prestige of Oleg’s legacy. But the greater number of invitees responded enthusiastically, with essays short or long—in some cases much longer than the usual Muqarnas article—witty or earnest, and ranging in geographical scope from Marrakech to Agra and in temporal span from the pre-Islamic period to the twentieth century. In their splendid diversity, all are united in expressing their indebtedness to and affection for Oleg.

The Syriac churchman Bar Penkaye, who wrote about 690, held the Arab invaders to have been “naked men riding without armor or shield.” 1 In the same vein Michael the Syrian (d. 1199) reports that a certain Hiran sent by the last Sasanid emperor to spy on the Arabs told his employer that the invaders were “a barefoot people, naked and weak, but very brave.”2 A Muslim text dating from, perhaps, the later eighth century similarly insists that the invaders were “barefoot and naked, without equipment, strength, weapons, or provisions.”3 In all three texts the word “naked” seems to be used in the sense of poorly equipped and lacking body armor rather than devoid of clothes, and all three depict the Arabs as poorly equipped in order to highlight the extraordinary, God-assisted nature of the Arab conquests. “I have a sharp arrowhead that penetrates iron, but it is no use against the naked,” as Rustam says in the Sh¸hn¸ma, in his premonition of the fall of the Sasanids. 4 But precisely what did the Arab invaders wear? It would be the ﬁrst question to spring to Oleg Grabar’s mind. Under normal circumstances it would be the last to spring to mine, for as Oleg is fond of telling his colleagues, historians tend to ignore the concrete physical manifestation of things; in particular, they do not think of the way things looked and so miss an important dimension of the past. I have always pleaded guilty to that charge. Having beneﬁted from Oleg’s lively company and warm heart for over ten years, however, I shall now try to make amends, if only with a triﬂ ing offering: how should we tell a ﬁlmmaker who wanted to screen the story of the Arab conquests to depict the conquerors? More precisely, how should we tell him to depict the desert Arabs who participated in the conquests, for the bedouin will not have been dressed in the same way as the settled Arabs, and I should like to keep things simple. Most of us would probably reply that the hypothetical ﬁlmmaker should depict the bedouin warriors as men in kafﬁyehs and ﬂowing robes, along the lines\n\nfamiliar from Lawrence of Arabia and countless Hollywood ﬁlms; but as far as the bedouin of pre-Islamic Arabia are concerned, it would seem that we are wrong. Though “naked” may be a little hyperbolic, both literary and iconographic evidence suggests that it is not far from the truth. To start with the literary evidence, Ammianus Marcellinus, commander of the eastern armies about 350 AD, tells us that the Arabs of the Syrian desert were “warriors of equal rank, half nude, clad in dyed cloaks as far as the loins.”5 The word he uses for their cloaks is sagulum, a short, military tunic, and one wonders how literally one should take him: were they wearing Roman army issue, passed down from relatives and friends who had served in the Roman army, or alternatively stolen from unlucky soldiers? (“When bedouin raiders in the desert encountered someone from the settled areas, it was their custom to accost him with the command, Ishla¥ y¸ walad, ‘Strip, boy!’ meaning that they intended to rob him of his clothing,” as Jabbur says of the Syrian bedouin many centuries later.6) Ammianus does not tell us what, if anything, the warriors wore on their heads, but of another Arab, this time one in Roman service at Adrianople, he says that he was long haired and naked except for a loincloth.7 In the same vein Malka, a fourth-century Syrian who was captured by bedouin between Aleppo and Edessa and whose adventures were recorded by Jerome, describes how the Ishmaelites descended upon his party of about seventy travelers “with their long hair ﬂying from under their headbands.” He did not think of them as wearing turbans or kafﬁyehs, then, or as shielding their heads from the sun by any kind of head cover at all. Like Ammianus, he says that they wore cloaks over their “half-naked bodies,” but he adds that they wore broad military boots (caligae).8 Again one wonders if they were wearing Roman army issue. They transported Malka into the desert and set him to work as a shepherd, and there he “learned to go naked,” he says, presumably meaning that he learned\n\npatricia crone\n\n2\n\nFig. 1. Ivory carving, right arm of the Chair of Maximianus. Museo Arcivescovile, Ravenna. (Photo: Alinari/Art Resource, NY)\n\nto cover himself with a mere skin: this seems to have been all that slaves wore in pre-Islamic Arabia.9 One would infer that he had handed over his clothes to his captors. We now turn to the iconographic evidence, looking at it region by region.\n\nSYRIA To start in Syria, there is a representation of seminaked bedouin in an ivory carving from a chair made in the ﬁrst half of the sixth century in Antioch or (under Syro-Palestinian inﬂuence) Alexandria (ﬁg. 1).10 It depicts Joseph’s brothers selling Joseph to two Saracens: the brothers are represented by the three ﬁgures on the left, Joseph stands in the middle, and two Saracens appear with two camels behind them to the right. The Saracens, who are armed with a bow and a spear respectively, have long, apparently plaited hair and wear nothing on their heads or their upper torsos, merely loose garments wrapped around their waists, which reach as far as their ankles but expose one of their legs as they walk. The brothers are also scantily clad, but in more military-looking outﬁts, and it is they rather than the Saracens who are wearing boots. The Saracens are shod in sandals. There is of course no guarantee that the carving is based on observation rather than artistic convention, but one point is clear: it was not as heavily clad ﬁgures in the\n\nstyle of Lawrence of Arabia that bedouin were envisaged in sixth-century Syria. Another ivory carving on the same chair shows the Saracens selling Joseph to Potiphar (ﬁg. 2). Here Joseph is seen twice, ﬁrst on a camel (on the left) and next between Potiphar and one of the Saracens, to whom she is handing money. Potiphar is wearing classical-looking robes. The Saracens’ robes also appear more ﬂowing than in the ﬁrst panel, but here as there their lower body wraps are split in the middle, exposing their legs, and their arms are bare. In fact, their entire upper torsos could be bare, though it is hard to tell. The short tunic that Joseph is wearing clearly includes a drape over one shoulder, and the adult Saracens could have a similar item on their shoulders.11 Maybe the artist dressed his characters in classical clothes in order to conjure up a bygone age. In any case, he depicted the Saracens with the same long, apparently plaited hair as in the ﬁrst panel, and he gave them sandals, too, but not any kind of headgear. One would take it to have been long hair of this kind that Malka saw ﬂowing under headbands. Yet another sixth-century carving, also a Syrian or Syro-Egyptian work, depicts two brothers selling Joseph to a Saracen.12 Joseph and his brothers are wearing short tunics similar to those in which rural people are depicted on the mosaic ﬂoors of sixth-century churches in Madaba.13 The Saracen is wearing a mantle that leaves the left part of his chest exposed, but what he is wearing underneath\n\nwhat did the bedouin of the arab conquests look like?\n\n3\n\nFig. 2. Ivory carving, right arm of the Chair of Maximianus. Museo Arcivescovile, Ravenna. (Photo: Alinari/Art Resource, NY)\n\nis not clear. All four are barefoot and bareheaded. Finally, we have the depiction a man armed with a bow, sword, and whip, leading a camel (ﬁg. 3); this appears on the mosaic ﬂoor of the church of the monastery of Kayanos at {Uyun Musa, at the eastern top of the Dead Sea, dated by Piccirillo to the second half of the sixth century.14 In Picirillo’s words, the man “is half naked, wearing a long loincloth reaching beneath his knees with a cloak thrown over his left shoulder that covers his forearm.” Picirillo suggests that he was an auxiliary soldier and deems the representation to ﬁt the “exaggeratedly dramatic” literary accounts of Arab soldiers given by authors such as Ammianus Marcellinus and Malka in Jerome.15 Whether the Arab was an auxiliary soldier or not, however, the representation actually seems to be quite different. The most dramatic feature of the mosaic is the Arab’s bulging chest.\n\nNeither Ammianus nor Jerome says anything about chests, but both highlight the long, ﬂowing hair of the Arabs; though damage to the mosaic makes it impossible to say what, if anything, the soldier is wearing on his head, it is at least clear that he does not have hair (or a kafﬁyeh) coming down to his shoulders. The clothes involved are quite different, too. Ammianus’ Arabs were wearing short military tunics, Jerome’s were dressed in cloaks and boots, but the soldier in the mosaic is wearing a waist wrap and shawl along with sandals. This could well be based on observation, for the waist wrap and shawl (ºz¸r and rid¸}) are the two chief items of male clothing in pre-Islamic poetry.16 The main feature that the three representations have in common is the skimpiness of the outﬁts described. Pitched against a horsemen encased in iron, Arabs such as these would indeed have come across as naked.\n\npatricia crone\n\n4\n\nFig. 3. Mosaic from the church of Kaianos at {Uyun Musa, Mount Nebo. (Photo courtesy of Michele Picirillo)\n\nIn sharp contrast to these representations, an image on a piece of Coptic tapestry dating between the sixth and eighth centuries and said to show Joseph and an Ishmaelite merchant on a camel depicts both Joseph and the Ishmaelite as thoroughly wrapped up.17 But the alleged camel may well be a horse,18 and the alleged Ishmaelite seems to be wearing trousers. So this can be left out of consideration.\n\nSOUTH ARABIA If the inhabitants of the Roman empire envisaged the Saracens as wearing nothing on their heads and not much on their bodies, how were they seen by the Arabs themselves? We may start in the south. Here the ﬁrst image to capture one’s attention is a crude relief on an alabaster incense burner from Shabwa in the Hadramawt, probably dating from around the third century AD (ﬁg. 4). It depicts a man riding on an unsaddled camel, positioned in front of the hump; he holds a short sword or a camel stick or some such implement in his right hand and the reins in his left, and a water skin or shield is attached by a strap to the rear of the hump. He is stark naked, and, apart from the reins, the camel is as naked as he is.\n\nThe text gives the name of the person commemorated, presumably identical with the person represented, as Adhlal ibn Wahab}il but does not otherwise tells us anything about him.19 Macdonald wonders whether the incense burner is a funerary object rather than a dedicatory one (as suggested in the catalogue of the exhibition in which it was most recently displayed20), for the inscription does not mention any deity, only a name and a patronym, and the vast majority of funerary stelae in both North and South Arabia only give the deceased’s name and patronym. If the object is funerary, the relief might in Macdonald’s opinion represent the naked soul of the deceased riding his camel on the Day of Judgment.21 But as Macdonald himself stresses, this is highly conjectural. Besides, did the pagans of South Arabia believe in the resurrection? There is nothing to suggest that the deceased was a Jew or a Christian. And the people depicted on other funerary reliefs are fully clothed. On the whole, it seems more likely that a bedouin of the Hadrami plateau is being depicted here, for there are plenty of naked Arabs in the rock reliefs, as will be seen. Why such a man should ﬁgure on a Shabwan incense burner is another question. A fully clothed camel rider appears on a funerary relief, also of alabaster, dated to roughly the ﬁrst\n\nwhat did the bedouin of the arab conquests look like?\n\nFig. 4. Relief from an alabaster incense burner. British Museum, ANE 125682. (Reproduced with the permission of the Trustees of the British Museum)\n\nto the third century AD, with an incription identifying the deceased as Mushayqar Hamayat ibn Yashuf (ﬁg. 5).22 He too is holding a short spear or camel stick in his right hand and the reins in his left, and he is sitting on a ﬁne camel saddle of a type also attested on a bronze ﬁgurine of a camel thought to be from Yemen.23 Unlike the wild bedouin on the incense burner, this camel rider was presumably a soldier in the local army, dressed in conformity with the\n\n5\n\nsense of propriety of the settled people. Of decently dressed camel-riders, presumably soldiers in the local armies, we also have an example in a relief from Dura Europos that shows such a rider seated on a saddled camel, armed with a long lance, and wearing a tunic and mantle.24 But he is bareheaded, and maybe the South Arabian was too: Calvet and Robin interpret his apparent head cover as a hair style.25 In another funerary relief, a Sabaean alabaster of the second or third century AD, the lower panel shows a horseman with the north Arabian name of {Ijl ibn Sa{dallat touching a camel with his spear, the act by which a camel raider appropriates a camel. The upper panel shows the deceased sitting at a table with his wife and child in attendance, or perhaps the deceased at a banquet, and both the stool and the table indicate that we are in a settled environment, as also suggested by the fact that the nisba of the deceased was Qryn: he may have come from Qaryat al-Faw or from Wadi ’l-Qura.26 He was not a bedouin raiding camels, then, but rather a sedentary Arab engaged in what one would assume to be camel catching staged as a sport.27 All the ﬁgures are fully clothed, the deceased in a long robe and the other two in shorter garments, and the deceased seems to be wearing some kind of head cover, though his putative wife and children are clearly bareheaded. The deceased’s headgear, if it is not simply hair, looks like some sort of stiff bonnet, certainly not like a turban. South Arabian reliefs, which usually show people bareheaded, do not in fact seem to depict any turbans at all. Moving slightly north to Qaryat al-Faw, which ﬂourished from roughly the second century BC to roughly the ﬁfth century AD, we ﬁnd a bronze statue of a man wearing nothing but a loincloth, but he is kneeling reverently, presumably in prayer, and his outﬁt is more likely to be a form of i¥r¸m than bedouin dress.28 Also at Qaryat al-Faw we ﬁnd two drawings on plaster walls of horsemen hunting or raiding camels. One horseman could be naked, but the other is wearing something like a tunic or at least a skirt. Whether they have headgear is impossible to tell.29\n\nTHE DESERT That leaves us with the countless rock drawings left by the inhabitants of the desert themselves. The most striking image among these is a drawing of a horse-\n\n6\n\npatricia crone\n\nFig. 5. Alabaster funerary relief. Louvre, AO 1128. (Photo courtesy of Michael Macdonald)\n\nman hunting an oryx with a short spear (ﬁg. 6). He is wearing a waist wrap similar to that of the Arab soldier in the sixth-century mosaic; the thickened lines across his shoulders could be taken to suggest that he is also wearing a rid¸}, and he has bushy or kinky hair that, although quite long, sticks straight out from his head, in a style that is quite common in Safaitic drawings.30 Unless we take his hair actually to be some sort of hat, he is not wearing anything on his head. Other drawings do depict headgear, sometimes very elaborate, but apparently in the form of plumes, which are hardly intended here.31 The author of the Safaitic inscription on the same stone claims to have made the drawing, which is thus roughly datable to the period from the ﬁrst century BC to the fourth century AD. By then, it would seem, the pre-Islamic “uniform” of ºz¸r and rid¸} was in place, but without the turban or other headgear by which it is usually taken to have been complemented. By the standards of the rock drawings, this horseman is well dressed, for most drawings depict males as\n\neither naked or wearing skimpy clothes “mainly meant to cover the private parts,” as Nayeem puts it.32 But these drawings are difﬁcult to date, and though some are Safaitic,33 many of them are likely to be much older than the period under consideration here. There is an example of what the makers of rock art wore in a Thamudic drawing from the Tabuk region of northern Arabia, which depicts a horseman and two men in a chariot—a driver and an archer (ﬁg. 7).34 The horseman, who is riding in front of the chariot, appears to be every bit as naked as the camel on the Sabaean stela, though one should perhaps envisage him as wearing a loincloth. He also seems to have long, ﬂowing (rather than bushy) hair. The driver could be naked, at least as far as his upper torso is concerned (the lower part of his body is hidden from view), but maybe the draftsman simply refrained from trying to depict his clothes. He could be bareheaded, but his head is pointed, perhaps to suggest the conical helmet worn by Assyrian soldiers.35 The footsoldier who is pursuing the chariot and shooting arrows at it, however (ﬁg. 8), is dressed in a long waist wrap, with a slit at the side or the front to allow freedom of movement, along the lines of those depicted on the ivory panel of Saracens buying Joseph from his brothers (see ﬁg. 1). He too seems to have long hair. This drawing is likely to be very old. The chariot points to ancient Near Eastern times, perhaps the seventh to fourth century BC,36 and the footsoldier has a long, pointed thong between his legs, a feature also found on images of Arabs on Assyrian reliefs (although precisely what it is meant to represent is unknown). Indeed, one wonders if the occupants of the chariot should not actually be identiﬁed as Assyrians (or perhaps Babylonians) pursuing one Arab while being shot at by another.37 The age of the drawing notwithstanding, the clothing and hairstyle of the Arab archer are not drastically different from those examined above, suggesting that the desert Arabs dressed in much the same way for over a millennium before the rise of Islam. In a drawing by W. Boutcher of a detail from the Assyrian reliefs showing the campaign of Ashurbanipal (688–627 BC) against the Arabs, the Arabs, with plaited hair, are shown dismounted from their camels and dressed in wraparounds, each with an opening to allow freedom of movement (ﬁ g. 9). Their wraparounds are not ﬂowing like those of the Saracens who purchase Joseph from his brothers (ﬁg. 1),\n\nwhat did the bedouin of the arab conquests look like?\n\nFig. 6.

When and why did the desert Arabs start covering themselves up? I cannot claim to know. My guess would be that they started doing so in the centuries after the rise of Islam, and in consequence of the rise of Islam, for Islam drew the bedouin closer together to the settled people, giving them shared religious and other norms. Wrapping up was what the people who mattered did, and so the bedouin came to do so too (at least when they could afford it). According to Ibn al-Kalbi (d. 819 or later), the Tanukh who met the caliph al-Mahdi (d. 785) in Qinnasrin were wearing turbans. They were trying to look their best on this occasion.39 A Byzantine miniature of ca. 976–1025 depicting Simeon Stylites venerated by Arabs shows Simeon in a hooded monk’s habit and the three Arabs wearing turbans, now apparently as a matter of course.40 But I had better leave this question for another birthday.

(Photo courtesy of Michael Macdonald)\n\nand their hair looks shorter and a good deal neater, too, but given that there are more than a thousand years between the images, the continuity is nonetheless striking. To a somewhat lesser degree, the same holds true when one compares the Assyrian representations with the Safaitic rock drawings and the Madaba mosaic. In sum, what did the bedouin participants in the conquests wear? The answer seems to be generally not very much at all: either bits and pieces of what their settled neighbors—whether the latter were Byzantines, Arabians, or (one assumes) Iranians—wore, or a wraparound and a rid¸} covering part of their upper torso, and perhaps even sandals, but rarely, insofar as one can tell, anything on their heads. It is the absence of headgear that is the most surprising. Whatever the variations, all the desert dwellers seem to have looked a\n\nNOTES Author’s note: I should like to thank Michael Macdonald for invaluable help with images, inscriptions, and bibliographical references alike.

At one point Hilal mentions the following curious rule: “It is not the custom for anyone to be mentioned in the presence of the caliph...by the name of the caliph, if his name happens to be his” (wa-laysa mina ’l-{¸dati an yudhkara a¥adun bi-¥a¤rati ’l-khalºfati...bi-smi ’l-khalºfati in w¸faqa }smuhu }smahu). 3 I shall refer to this rule (or rules very similar to it) as the namesake taboo. What the rule means can best be shown by giving an example. Let us suppose that the caliph’s name is Ahmad, as in the case of the caliph al-Mu{tadid (r. 892–902). It would then be improper to mention Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855) by name in his presence. (You could, of course, solve the problem by using the patronymic “Ibn Hanbal” on its own; the problem is the name, not the person.) Hilal follows up his statement of the rule with an anecdote about a tribesman called Sulayman ibn {Abd al-Malik, who almost missed getting his pay from the Umayyad caliph of the same name (r. 715–17) when the latter asked him his name and the unwary tribesman responded, “Sulayman ibn {Abd al-Malik.”4 Hilal goes on to add a further rule. If it is necessary to mention anything that is also the name of one of the ruler’s womenfolk, then one must substitute another word for it.5 Here too he backs up his point with an anecdote. A kinsman of Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), {Abd al-Malik ibn Salih (d. 811 or 812), sent a note to the caliph in which he had occasion to mention bamboo; he carefully avoided the word khayzur¸n and used a less elegant synonym, because Khayzuran (d. 789) was the caliph’s mother.6 But we can leave this reﬁnement aside7 and return to the namesake taboo proper.\n\nThe namesake taboo was not restricted to the names of caliphs, as we learn from an anecdote about the litterateur Abu Zayd al-Balkhi (d. 934).8 We usually know him respectfully by his teknonym Abu Zayd, but his name and patronymic were Ahmad ibn Sahl. One day he went to call on the governor of Khurasan, a certain Ahmad ibn Sahl ibn Hashim (d. 920).9 The governor asked him his name, whereupon Abu Zayd replied, with apparent disrespect to the governor, “Abu Zayd.” The governor put this down to social ineptitude, and this diagnosis soon appeared to be conﬁrmed: when Abu Zayd departed, he left his signet ring behind him in the place where he had been sitting. But when the governor examined the signet ring, he saw the name A¥mad ibn Sahl on it. He then realized that the apparent ineptitude of his visitor had actually been the height of good breeding: by leaving his signet ring behind, Abu Zayd had quietly provided the explanation for his apparent disrespect. For Abu Zayd to have spoken the name of the governor in his presence would have been a far worse lapse than calling himself by his teknonym. We also hear of the namesake taboo in the context of behavior towards kings (mul¢k). Siraj al-Din Mahmud Urmawi (d. 1283 or 1284), a scholar who studied in Mosul and died in Konya,10 was the author of a “mirror for princes.”11 He devotes a section of this work to the way one should behave towards kings; 12 for example, he advises that one should brush one’s teeth before going to see them.13 At one point in this discussion he states that when the king asks someone his name, and he happens to have the same name as the king (ham-n¸m-i p¸dsh¸h b¸shad), he should not speak his name (n¸m-i khwud na-g¢yad), but rather reply, “Your slave is the son of so-and-so.”14 In short, the namesake taboo protects the dignity of those who wield political power by forbidding the mention by name in their presence of any persons who share their names. Those who wield political power\n\n12\n\nmichael cook\n\nmay be caliphs, governors, or kings, and those who may not be named may be present or absent. There are doubtless other attestations of the namesake taboo to be found in the sources. But they are hard to locate, even with electronic search facilities, and the attestations given above are at least enough to establish the existence of this exotic phenomenon. To my knowledge it has not found more than an occasional mention in the secondary literature,15 though here too I may be guilty of oversight. Be this as it may, what are we to make of it? We can start by resolving our phenomenon into two components. First, there is the rather trivial fact that for different people to have the same name is a problem. The primary function of your name is to identify you, so if someone else has the same name, the identiﬁcation process collapses in confusion. Here we have a glitch that can affect any society in which names are not unique; where people and cultures differ is in the ways in which they attempt to work around the problem. Second, there is the fact that in societies that set a value on steep hierarchy, it makes sense that the confusion should be obviated at the expense of the inferior party. If it is taken for granted that somebody has to stand down, then it is naturally the inferior party who is temporarily denied the use of his name. This is by no means trivial, and here some cross-cultural comparison may be interesting. One way to go is to compare the namesake taboo with the way things are in the West. I take it that if during his presidency Bill Clinton had met the Harvard Islamicist Bill Graham or my late colleague Jerry Clinton, and had asked them who they were, each of them would have had a First-Amendment right to respond with his own name; and my guess is that both of them would have exercised that right. What is more, I doubt if either of them would have hesitated, if chatting to the President about his experiences in England, to refer by name to the “Hilary term” at Oxford or the London suburb of “Chelsea.” So if we see it from the perspective of the heirs of the American Revolution, our namesake taboo looks like a characteristic excess of Oriental despotism. But the more interesting comparison is not with revolutionary America, but rather with traditional China, where we encounter a whole system of onomastic taboos.16 Indeed, seen from the perspective of imperial China, the namesake taboo as we have encountered it in the Muslim world seems so rudimentary\n\nthat one could hardly call it a system; it looks more like Occidental anarchy. Apart from the fact that such practices are much older in China—where they would seem to date from at least the ﬁrst half of the ﬁrst millennium BC17— there are three major differences between the Chinese system and our namesake taboo. First, in China the taboo applies just as ﬁrmly to writing as to speech. Abu Zayd could affect to forget a signet ring with his name inscribed on it without thereby giving cause for yet further offense; in a Chinese context, by contrast, the written name would have been no less of a violation of the taboo than the spoken name. This meant, for example, that candidates taking ofﬁcial examinations in China towards the end of the Ch’ing dynasty (1644–1911) had to avoid using a set of eighteen characters in their written answers; mostly these were characters that appeared in the personal names of the emperors of the dynasty, though the same protection was extended to Confucius (d. 479 BC) and Mencius (fourth century BC).18 Second, the domain of the taboo was not limited to the immediate presence of the emperor. Since the second century BC it had extended to the whole realm.19 Thus in 1782 a provincial governor could stir up doubts about the loyalty of Muslims by pointing out that a Chinese biography of the Prophet seized in his province “does not respect the prohibitions regarding using the name of the emperor.”20 The exact rules varied from dynasty to dynasty. But the general idea was that the word or words making up the personal names of the emperors could not be spoken, and the characters used to write them could not be written—even in contexts that had nothing to do with an emperor’s personal name. It is as if it had been taboo to say or write “dollar bill” anywhere in the United States for the duration of the Clinton presidency. The third major difference between the Chinese system and our namesake taboo lies in the relationship of each to the wider culture—or the lack of it. The Chinese system was entirely at home in Chinese culture; like so much else in traditional China, it was ﬁrmly grounded in Chinese family values. Every family had its taboo names, just as the imperial family did, although the taboo of a private family was supposed to stop at the door.21 Thus for the historian Ssu-ma Ch’ien (d. ca. 86 BC) the personal name of his father was taboo, and this led him to alter two names he mentions in his history.22 A common mark of European speakers of Chinese in modern times was their\n\nthe namesake taboo insensitivity to the taboos of those they addressed and the embarrassment they thereby gave rise to;23 by contrast, a sign of the superb micropolitical skills of one Chinese emperor was that he never forgot the taboos of any family he had visited.24 Until recently, to ask a Chinese schoolboy to name his parents was to ask him to violate a taboo—just as Confucius would never pronounce the two characters of his mother’s name together.25 In the Islamic world, by contrast, the system is distinctly out of place in the wider culture. It seems to have no roots in the Arab heritage, and it has no properly Islamic underpinnings. The ﬁrst two differences, taken together, help to explain the fact that the main reason one hears about the Chinese system in Western scholarly literature is that it affects the work of modern philologists.26 Substitutions and mutilations of taboo characters are in effect a form of textual corruption, an added contribution to the ravages of time—though they can also leave behind clues to the history of a text. The name of the founder of the Han dynasty, for example, was taboo in its day, and this led to the substitution of another character in the text of the “Han Stone Classics.”27 It is as if we could infer that a copy of the Qur}an was written in the reign of al-Mu{tadid by observing that the scribe had been obliged to alter the name Ahmad in Qur}an 61:6—a thought as outrageous in Islamic terms as the idea that Bill Graham cannot be Bill in the presence of Bill Clinton is in American terms. So far as I know, there is still no major study of the taboo system as a cultural phenomenon in its own right. This is a pity; it would amply merit one. The third difference is related to a striking onomastic disparity between China and most cultures to the west of it. In traditional China it was improper to name someone after someone else—say, a monarch, a governor, or an ancestor; such an action counted as a violation of a taboo, rather than a sign of respect.28 In China one checked the family registers precisely to avoid giving a child the name of an ancestor.29 In the West, by contrast, we frequently name one person after another. George Washington (d. 1799) may not in the end have proved a very loyal subject of the British crown, but his father surely meant no disrespect to King George II (r. 1727–60) when in 1732 he named his son George.30 As for ancestors, in America we are used to whole dynasties where the personal name of the father is conferred on the son. The Islamic world has a similarly positive attitude to “naming after.” The long-lived Companion Anas ibn Malik (d. 709 or\n\n13\n\n710) was named after (bihi summiya) his uncle Anas ibn al-Nadr, who was killed at the battle of Uhud in 625.31 Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr (d. 658) was born in 632, in the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad (d. 632);32 Muhammad ibn Talha (d. 656) was given his name by the Prophet himself;33 and there were further Muhammads of this vintage.34 Moreover, it is not hard to ﬁnd people in biographical dictionaries called “Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad”35— which in Chinese terms amounts to a whole string of taboo violations. Nevertheless, the Muslim namesake taboo is not completely isolated in the wider Near Eastern context. Admittedly, I have not encountered any Near Eastern parallel in the case of the name of the ruler, the core case with which we are concerned. There are, however, scattered Muslim parallels in religious and social contexts. There is a story about Talha ibn {Ubayd Allah (d. 656), who had made a point of naming his sons after prophets—including Muhammad.36 The caliph {Umar (r. 634–44) took exception to this, decreeing that all who bore the names of prophets should change them;37 Talha won the ensuing argument, and the practice of giving such names has continued to this day—except that in some Muslim societies we ﬁnd variant pronunciations of “Muhammad” that tend to be preferred when the name belongs to someone other than the Prophet.38 There is a possible Jewish parallel to such sensitivity: we scarcely hear of Jews being named “Moses” before Islamic times,39 when Jewish customs may have come under the inﬂuence of Muslim practice. On the Jewish side, in addition, Rabbinic norms placed a taboo on the name of one’s father (and also of one’s teacher).40 Whether any such practices existed in Sasanid Iran does not seem to be known;41 a passage in a work ascribed to Jahiz (d. 868 or 869) suggests the possibility that ideas of this kind might have a Sasanid background.42 But with regard to the origin of the Muslim namesake taboo, I have no hypothesis to offer. The most interesting point in all this is not, however, about origins, but rather about the relationship between an imperial state and the society it rules.43 To us, and to the Western tradition in general, nothing is more intrinsically the property of a society than its language. From time to time governments will be found seeking to make linguistic changes for the sake of what they see or present as the public good. But for the state to appropriate words and names current in the community’s language—to claim exclusive owner-\n\nmichael cook\n\n14\n\nship of them, denying their use to the society even in reproducing the texts of its classics—is by our standards breathtaking. Yet this practice was widely implemented, and very much at home, in imperial China. This need not altogether surprise us: in no other part of the premodern world did an imperial state come as close to claiming ownership of the culture of its society, a point that can be richly documented in such ﬁelds as historiography, law, and the workings of the calendar. Against this background, the surprise is that the namesake taboo, in however modest a form, should appear in the Islamic world at all. There the role of the state was in comparative terms severely restricted in all the three ﬁelds just mentioned. The very presence of the namesake taboo in a Muslim context thus goes against the grain. This at least makes it intriguing, which perhaps does something to mitigate the shame of presenting an aniconic tu¥fa to Oleg Grabar.

The primary word for “taboo” is hui: see E.

Haenisch’s ﬁfteen-page treatment is a helpful introduction to these practices but misses signiﬁcant primary and secondary sources: see the review by G. Haloun in Orientalistische Literaturzeiting 37 (1934): cols. 576–79. See further W. Bauer, Der chinesische Personenname (Wiesbaden, 1959), 263–70. For a brief account in English see M. J.

Vissière, “Traité des charactères chinois que l’on évite par respect,” Journal Asiatique, 9th ser., 18 (1901): 325–26. The ramiﬁcations of the avoidance of these characters were considerable, and are set out at length in the rest of the article. Haenisch, “Heiligung,” 7.

I am indebted to Joseph Witztum for assistance on this point, which I believe I owe to a conversation with Haggai BenShammai many years ago. Cf. Encyclopaedia Judaica, 16 vols. (Jerusalem, 1971–72, 12: col. 809 (in the article “Names”): “Not a single rabbi is known by the name of Moses.” As Patricia Crone points out to me, Christian attitudes to the name “Jesus” may have been, and may still be, in some measure analogous. Maimonides (d. 1204) states that a son should not call his father by his name (bi-shmo) whether he is alive or dead; if others bear the same name as his father or his teacher, he alters (mshanneh) their names: see Mishneh Torah (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 1965–67), 1834: Shof«im, Hilkhot mamrim, chap. 6, section 3; A. M. Hershman, trans., The Code of Maimonides, Book Fourteen: The Book of Judges (New Haven, 1949), 154. Maimonides adds as his own view that this does not apply to common names such as Abraham or Moses when the son is not in the presence of his father. This taboo is pre-Islamic, being found already in the Babylonian Talmud, where we read: “A scholar (¥akham) alters (mshanneh) the name of his father and the name of his teacher”: Babylonian Talmud, Vilnius 1880–86, Qiddushin 31b.42; in the Soncino translation, ed. I. Epstein (London 1935–52), ^iddushin, 154. I owe these references to Joseph Braude. We can at least point out that the names of Sasanid kings could be written—they appear, for example, on their coins— and that Bahram I (r. 271–74) was succeeded by his son Bahram II (r. 274–93): R.

The author says that no king should be called by his name or teknonym, regrets that the ancient poets had done so, and afﬁrms that none of their subjects ever acted like this to the Sasanid kings: J¸¥i¬, T¸j, 83.7; the passage is cited in F.

He does deal with the situation in which the visitor’s name is one of the royal epithets (ªif¸t), like al-sa{ºd or alsayyid; if asked his name, such a visitor should avoid calling himself by it: J¸¥i¬, T¸j, 87.1.

The spectacular building enshrining the venerated Rock constituted the focus of both {Abd alMalik’s and Sultan Süleyman’s construction activities\n\nat the sanctuary in Jerusalem, projects that articulated an inextricable link between state religion and dynastic politics. The Ottoman sultan’s restoration campaigns, which in Grabar’s words amounted to “reconsecrating an old sanctuary,” involved a process of selective recovery and reinterpretation. I shall argue that this process contributed to the reemergence of a dormant substratum of local traditions and collective memories existing in a “latent state,” which “may disappear and be revived under similar circumstances.”6 Besides attempting to interpret the Dome of the Rock in light of its Ottoman glosses, I will stress its dialogical relationship with the narrative discourses of accompanying buildings in the “master plan” conceptualized by {Abd al-Malik for the gigantic complex (al-masjid al-aqª¸, al-masjid bayt al-maqdis) that came to be known as the Noble Sanctuary (¥aram alsharºf ) in Mamluk and Ottoman times. Since several publications have traced the construction history of the Haram across a broad sweep of time, I have chosen to concentrate here on the Marwanid and Ottoman layers of its “grand narrative,” without dwelling on a detailed architectural analysis of the buildings themselves.7 After presenting in the ﬁrst part of this essay my personal exegesis on the elusive meanings of {Abd al-Malik’s Dome of the Rock, an arena of considerable debate with a longstanding venerable tradition of its own, I shall turn in the shorter, second part to the relatively unexplored terrain of Sultan Süleyman’s interpretive glosses, overlaid on the building’s “palimpsestous” surfaces.8\n\nI. NARRATIVITY OF THE DOME OF THE ROCK WITHIN {ABD AL-MALIK’S MASTER PLAN The transformation of the Temple Mount into a multifocal pilgrimage complex in the course of the seventh and early eighth century paralleled both the construction of Muslim traditions articulating its holi-\n\n18\n\ngülru nec~po>lu\n\nFig. 1. Dome of the Rock with upper platform of the Haram al-Sharif, view from the west. (Photo: Yossi Zamir/Corbis)\n\nthe dome of the rock as palimpsest ness and the mapping of Qur}anic references onto its components, a process in which textual and architectural narratives mutually reinforced one another. By the conclusion of the Umayyad period (661–750), the commemorative structures of the precinct had become enmeshed within a nexus of memories, bearing witness to the saturated sanctity and redemptive power of the complex and to its special place within the divine plan, extending from the creation to the end of time. As such, it offered a new paradigm of salvation, claiming to be the future locus where God would judge humankind and specially favor the adherents of Islam, the ﬁnal monotheistic faith, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad as a reminder of the imminent day of reckoning—a revelation that reiterated earlier versions “distorted” by the “People of the Book” (Jews and Christians).9 The multiple threads of this grand narrative, translated into architectural sites of witnessing, would be recast, reinterpreted, revised, and renegotiated through subsequent elaborations over the ages. Thanks to its numinous potency, bolstered by a combination of aesthetic power and resonant layers of meaning imbued with spiritual as well as temporal signiﬁcance, the complex continued to ﬂourish in spite of conquests and changes of regime (ﬁgs. 2 and 3). The early-seventh-century architectural history of the sanctuary is veiled by mythical accounts, just as the relationship of its layout with hypothetical reconstructions of the pre-Islamic Temple Mount remains far from resolved.10 The few written sources from this period suggest that a modest congregational mosque was commissioned along the southern wall of the precinct by the caliph {Umar b. al-Khattab (to whom semi-mythical traditions attribute the uncovering of the Rock, which was hidden under debris) soon after the conquest of Jerusalem (ca. 638) and prior to the death of the patriarch Sophronius (ca. 639). That mosque seems to have been renovated by Mu{awiya b. Abi Sufyan, the governor of Syria-Palestine (640s) and ﬁrst Umayyad caliph (r. 661–80). The pilgrim Arculf (670s) described it as a rectangular “house of prayer” that could accommodate at least 3,000 people.11 The initial focus of construction, then, was a spacious congregational mosque whose two commemorative mihrabs, named after the caliphs {Umar and Mu{awiya, are mentioned from the eleventh century onwards, in books written in praise of Jerusalem, as being located within the subsequently rebuilt Aqsa Mosque.12 Nevertheless, the perception of the precinct as a sanctiﬁed place for seeking God’s forgiveness is\n\n19\n\nattested early on by the pilgrimages of several Companions of the Prophet. Moreover, the caliph {Uthman (r. 644–56), the murdered kinsman of Mu{awiya, who adopted the slogan “Vengeance for {Uthman” to justify his own caliphal claims against those of the Prophet’s son-in-law {Ali (r. 656–61), endowed for the people’s beneﬁt the nearby sacred Spring of Silwan. One of the early pilgrims was {Umar’s pious son {Abdallah b. {Umar (d. ca. 692–94), who performed a pilgrimage there in 658, having reportedly regretted his presence at the Sifﬁn arbitration during the ﬁrst civil war (657–61) between the caliph {Ali (based in Iraq) and Mu{awiya (the governor of Syria-Palestine, who was then aspiring to the caliphate).13 It was in Jerusalem that, prior to his declaration of war against {Ali, Mu{awiya made a pact with {Amr b. al-{As, whose conquest of Egypt in the summer of 658 shifted the balance of power in favor of his ally, whom the Syrians had acknowledged as caliph earlier that year. Mu{awiya’s building activities at the site of the former Temple are recorded in several non-Muslim sources, which mention his restoration of its walls as well as clearing work performed on its grounds (sometime between 658 and 660) by Egyptian workers “with the help of demons,” before the staging of the formal ceremony in general recognition of his caliphate that took place there in July 660.14 Likewise, Mutahhar b. Tahir al-Maqdisi (ca. 966) states that the sanctuary in Jerusalem remained in ruins until it was rebuilt by the caliph {Umar and then by Mu{awiya, who took the caliphal oath of allegiance in it.15 Mu{awiya is reported to have announced from its minbar that “what is between the two walls of this mosque (masjid) is dearer to God than the rest of the earth,” presumably a reference to the whole praying ground of the precinct.16 He is also said to have propagated the use of the term “land of the Gathering and Resurrection [on the Day of Judgment]” (ar¤ al-ma¥shar wa ’l-manshar) with regard to Jerusalem.17 Mu{awiya furthermore attempted to extend Jerusalem’s sanctity to the entire province of Syria-Palestine (al-sh¸m), the locus of his capital, Damascus, for he told emissaries from Iraq to his court that they had arrived at “the seat of the best of caliphs” and at “the holy land, the land of the Gathering and the Resurrection, and the land of the graves of the prophets.” He thus established a precedent for identifying the holiness of the sanctuary in Jerusalem with cosmology, eschatology, and the legitimization of dynastic caliphal authority—themes that would further be elaborated in the expanded grand\n\n20\n\ngülru nec~po>lu\n\nFig. 2.

Some sources suggest that Mu{awiya’s son Yazid I (r. 680–83) may also have received homage as caliph in Jerusalem, but his short-lived reign marked the beginning of a second civil war (680–92), during which the Umayyads came close to losing the caliphate, a still-ﬂuid institution appropriated by {Abd al-Malik’s father, Marwan I (r. 684–85), who represented another branch of the same family.18 According to most accounts, {Abd al-Malik received the oath of allegiance as caliph in Damascus in 685, but one account places the ceremony in Jerusalem, where he may have been stationed while he was his father’s deputy in Palestine. If this was indeed the case, it anticipates the close attention he would devote to the city with his architectural patronage. At that time the “counter caliph,” Ibn al-Zubayr, was based in Mecca, having established his headquarters in the holy sanctuary centered around the Ka{ba, which he rebuilt in 684 over its old foundations from the time of Abraham, following its damage during the siege of Yazid I’s army. There Ibn al-Zubayr used to revile the vices of the Marwanid family and summon the people “to pay homage to him.” The variants of an often-cited early tradition claim that {Abd al-Malik therefore forbade his supporters in greater Syria to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca and ordered the construction of the Dome of the Rock in order to divert their attention from the hajj, a claim to which I shall return later.19 Scholars generally agree that {Abd al-Malik initiated this building project soon after his accession, while he was facing major problems during the second civil war, which came to a conclusion towards the end of the year 73 (692) with his decisive victory over Ibn al-Zubayr, who was killed in battle—a victory that conﬁrmed the transfer of the Umayyad caliphate from the Sufyanid branch of the family (established by Mu{awiya) to the Marwanids (descendants of Marwan). In spite of an attempt to demonstrate that the year 72 (691–92) mentioned in the foundation inscription of the Dome of the Rock marks the beginning of construction work, most studies consider this to be the completion date of the building and deem it to have been commenced while the second civil war was in progress, with the Hijaz and Iraq still in the hands of the Zubayrids.20 After all, the repeated accusation made by {Abd al-Malik’s opponents, claiming that he built the Dome of the Rock as a counter-Ka{ba, would have made little sense had he started its construction after his victory over the rebels in Iraq and shortly before\n\nhe regained control of Mecca. Moreover, it has been suggested that new evidence concerning his ﬁscal reforms in Syria and Egypt (conquered by his father from the Zubayrids) immediately after his accession weakens the objection that the Dome of the Rock could not have been built in this early period, inconducive to “ﬁnancing major construction.”21 According to the chronicle of the Andalusian scholar Ibn Habib (d. 853), which quotes an early-eighth-century report discussed below, {Abd al-Malik “built the mosque of Jerusalem (masjid bayt al-maqdis) in the year 70 (689–90) and assigned for its construction the tribute tax of Egypt for seven years and built the dome (qubba) that is over the Rock,” along with two minor domes next to it. This reference does not specify the construction date of the Dome of the Rock, which is presented as part of a wider building program that probably extended beyond the year mentioned on its foundation inscription. A thirteenth-century Mamluk historian, citing late-eighth- and early-ninth-century authors, on the other hand, states that the construction project (comprising the Dome of the Rock and the Aqsa Mosque) began in 69 (688–89) and was ﬁnished in 72 (691–92), while other Mamluk sources date its inception to 66 (685–86) and its completion to 73 (692–93).22 Situating the building chronology of the Dome of the Rock within the context of the ideological contest between {Abd al-Malik and his opponents turns it into a locus for rallying support for his claims to be the rightful caliph, not unlike Ibn al-Zubayr’s use of the Meccan sanctuary as his propaganda headquarters. The mosque in Jerusalem had also played a legitimizing role as a power base for Mu{awiya, as had the mosque of Kufa for his rival {Ali. Hence, the architectural development of the sanctuary in Jerusalem as a pilgrimage complex can be framed between two civil wars, when the leaders of different branches of the Umayyad family vied for the caliphate and transformed it into a divinely sanctioned dynastic institution. We shall see that the theme of caliphal legitimacy was a major component of the grand narrative of {Abd alMalik’s complex, which continued to evolve during the rest of his reign and the reigns of his sons, who succeeded him as caliphs—al-Walid I (r. 705–15), who completed the Aqsa Mosque, and probably Sulayman (r. 715–17), who built a bathhouse adjoining the complex, perhaps during his governorship of Palestine.23 Recent studies have persuasively argued that {Abd al-Malik’s ambitious master plan comprised not just\n\nthe dome of the rock as palimpsest the Dome of the Rock but also the development of the whole precinct, which in time included the rebuilding of the Aqsa Mosque; the construction of a number of commemorative structures on the central raised platform; the renovation of the outer walls with some of their monumental gates; and the axial alignment of the complex with the city below. These buildings were complemented by massive rectangular administrative and residen"
