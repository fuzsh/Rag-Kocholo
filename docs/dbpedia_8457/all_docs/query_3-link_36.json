        "text": "The iOS™ apps on this page work great with your iPhone™, iPad™, iPod touch™, or other compatible device only - however, they are NOT intended for use with your PC or Mac.\n\nYour iOS™ device is designed to get compatible apps from the iTunes AppStore™. You are welcome to obtain our iOS™ apps, therefore, uniquely from the iTunes AppStore-- just as is the case for all equivalent apps from all other companies eveywhere.\n\nThese iOS™ apps (programs) have been needed to be specifically designed, programmed, and tested (a process involving hundreds to thousands of hours and specialized skills and tools) to work on iOS™ devices and they certainly do work great on them. However, this also means that they work on iOS™ devices only--purchases made via the iTunes AppStore™ are not compatible with and will not work on, for example, your PC or Mac.\n\nIf you'd like to use a given app for both your iPhone / iPad / iPod and its equivalent piece of software for your PC or Mac (where one is available), as some people do in order to get 'the best of both worlds', you would need to purchase these separately. This 'a la carte' system ensures that you pay for only that which you intend to use and is fair to all involved. At any rate, it could not be differently due to Apple's sensible policy that its AppStore is for iOS apps only and effectively that no 'intermingling' is allowed.\n\nWe thank you for your understanding that we are obliged to follow all other software vendors in following Apple's policies in this regard."
