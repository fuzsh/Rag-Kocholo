        "text": "Qatar, once one of the poorest Gulf states, is one of the richest countries in the region today.\n\nQatar has used income from its large gas reserves to bankroll its regional and global ambitions, including hosting the 2022 Fifa World Cup tournament - the first Arab and Muslim-majority country to do so.\n\nNot all of its regional interventions are popular with other Arab leaders, such as its support for the Palestinian Hamas faction in Gaza and Islamist groups in Egypt and Syria.\n\nIn 2017 Saudi Arabia led efforts to cut the country off, ostensibly to force it to abandon its support for radical and Islamist groups. Qatar says any ties with such groups are part of an independent policy of relations with regional actors and strongly denies supporting terrorism.\n\nIt also faces problems at home. Oil money funds an all-embracing welfare state, with many services free or heavily subsidised, but the treatment of migrant workers is frequently criticized by rights groups.\n\nSheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani took over from his father in a peaceful transfer of power in June 2013.\n\nLike his father, he was educated in Britain: he went to Sherborne school in Dorset and Sandhurst, the British military academy.\n\nSheikh Tamim has made diversifying the economy and investing in the national infrastructure a priority, but much of his tenure has been dominated by tension with Qatar's Gulf Arab neighbours ostensibly over the country's support for radical and Islamist groups, and its efforts to maintain good relations with Iran.\n\nHe has promoted sport as part of Qatar's bid to raise its international profile."
