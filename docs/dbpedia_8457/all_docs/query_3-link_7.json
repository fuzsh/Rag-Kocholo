        "text": "Per diem regulations established by the government\n\nThe per diem rates established by government agencies are fundamentally applicable to federal employees and are often adopted by most organizations. While many companies stick to the federal rates and keep it simple, organizations have the freedom to choose their own per diem rates. Although, it is important to note that the per diem allowance amount excess of those stated by the government is taxable. Per diem paid in excess of the federal stated allowances are treated as wages, and employment taxes are levied.\n\nPuma has been using Zoho Expense in Oceania for over 3 years and our users have found the web interface and the phone apps to be feature rich and always improving.The look and feel is modern and pleasing to the eye. Puma has recently expanded the usage of Zoho Expense to multiple new regions around the globe, and throughout, the Zoho team has been extremely supportive to the unique requirements of each region and helped to make the onboarding experience painless.\n\nMark Hawkins\n\nDirector, Operations PUMA SEA\n\nWe started using Zoho Expense across our whole IFFCO group for Travel and Expense Management as one of the key aspects to keep control on spends. It was a challenge to manage employee spend and expense reporting across our multiple office locations with disparate solutions. We found Zoho Expense as a very powerful and flexible tool which allows us to accommodate many different expense policies and compliances in respect to many different countries' regulations.\n\nJaroslaw Pietraszko\n\nDirector ERP & Digital Transformation, IFFCO Group\n\nThe Zoho Expense team has provided us with the best featuresâespecially the receipt auto-scan, which eases our expense reporting journey with its mobile functionality. Our employees use Zoho Expense and its features extensively, particularly the mobile app. Above all, with the Zoho Analytics integration, we always get the insights we need with multiple dashboards to analyze our business spend. Weâre one of those happy customers who are looking forward to seeing many new features and integrations within the application.\n\nAmit Rai\n\nCHRO, Tata Play Fiber"
