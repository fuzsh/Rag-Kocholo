        "text": "Willis Gibson, a teenager from Oklahoma, has achieved a significant milestone by becoming the first human player to conquer Tetris, the renowned Nintendo video game, thirty-four years after its release. The momentous occasion was captured on camera as Willis Gibson reached level 157, causing the game to crash. He excitedly uploaded the video of this achievement to his YouTube account. Overwhelmed, the 13-year-old exclaimed, \"I'm going to pass out, I can't feel my fingers,\" as he tumbled back into his chair. Previously, in 2010, professional competitive gamer Thor Aackerlund had used a technique called hypertapping to reach level 30, involving vibrating the controller at a speed faster than the game allows. Following this, other players adopted hypertapping and various strategies to challenge themselves. However, until last month, only artificial intelligence (AI) had managed to reach the game's actual kill screen. In Tetris, a kill screen occurs when a player completes a level, leading to the game crashing. In Willis's remarkable 38-minute run, the screen collapses, and the falling blocks stop as he emerges victorious. Known as Blue Scuti on YouTube, Willis has been playing Tetris since he was eleven and has participated in several gaming competitions. His achievement marks a remarkable feat in the gaming world. #First #Human #Nintendo #Tetris #Game #Beat\n\nResearch led by UK astronomers has revealed that our previous ideas about the colors of Neptune and Uranus were incorrect. Images from a space mission in the 1980s showed Neptune as rich blue and Uranus as green. However, a recent study discovered that both ice giant planets are similar shades of greenish-blue. Earlier images of Neptune had been enhanced to reveal details of its atmosphere, altering its true color. The researchers used data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer to produce what is claimed to be the most accurate representation of the colors of both planets. #First #Time #Colors #Uranus #Neptune\n\nIn a groundbreaking development, U.S. scientists have devised a revolutionary method to detect concealed nuclear threats using \"light with a twist.\" This innovative technique involves the use of twisted light beams, also known as vortex light, which can penetrate through materials and identify hidden nuclear substances. The ability to detect nuclear threats more accurately and efficiently is a significant advancement in national security and counterterrorism efforts. This technology could play a crucial role in preventing potential nuclear dangers by enabling authorities to identify hazardous materials before they pose a threat. As this research progresses, it has the potential to become a critical tool in the global fight against nuclear proliferation, providing a new layer of security in an increasingly complex world. #NuclearDetection #ScienceInnovation #TwistedLight #NationalSecurity #NuclearThreats #TechAdvancements #USScience #Counterterrorism #ScientificBreakthrough #GlobalSecurity\n\nIn a thrilling turn of events, \"Deadpool\" and \"Wolverine\" have taken the top spot as the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time, surpassing the iconic \"Joker.\" With their irreverent humor, intense action, and compelling characters, these films have captivated audiences and set a new benchmark in the R-rated genre. The success of \"Deadpool\" and \"Wolverine\" underscores the evolving landscape of superhero films and their impact on box office records. #Deadpool #Wolverine #Joker #TopRRatedMovie #BoxOffice #SuperheroMovies #FilmHistory"
