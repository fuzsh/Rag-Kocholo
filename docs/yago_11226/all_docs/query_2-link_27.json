        "text": "01 of 34\n\nDominic West (Jimmy McNulty)\n\nBefore he starred as Jimmy McNulty, the charming, but troubled detective, Dominic West had minor roles in Spice World (1997) and Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999).\n\nPost-Wire, West, who hit the big screen in Chicago (2002) and 300 (2006), has continued a successful TV run with Golden Globe-nominated performances on the BBC's The Hour and Showtime's The Affair. Other big screen credits include The Square (2017), Tomb Raider (2018)—where he plays Lara Croft's father—Colette (2018), and Downton Abbey: A New Era (2022).\n\nIn 2022, West began a two-season stint as Prince Charles on The Crown.\n\n02 of 34\n\nIdris Elba (Russell \"Stringer\" Bell)\n\nIdris Elba had been working steadily in British television for almost a decade before he got his breakthrough role as Stringer Bell, drug kingpin and aspiring legit businessman.\n\nAfter three seasons on The Wire, Elba began to raise his profile with supporting roles in films such as American Gangster (2007), Thor (2011), and Prometheus (2012). He earned a Golden Globe nomination and a Screen Actors Guild award for his portrayal of a warlord in Beasts of No Nation (2015).\n\nElba has periodically returned to his TV roots with his Golden Globe-winning and Emmy-nominated role on BBC's Luther. He has kept busy with turns in The Dark Tower (2017), The Mountain Between Us (2017), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Molly's Game (2018), Cats (2019), The Suicide Squad (2021), and Three Thousand Years of Longing (2022). In 2018, he got behind the camera for his directorial debut, Yardie.\n\n03 of 34\n\nMichael K. Williams (Omar Little)\n\nMichael K. Williams was a relative unknown when he was cast as stick-up artist Omar Little. He quickly became a fan favorite, with his character even identified by President Obama as his favorite of the series.\n\nFew Wire alums were busier than Williams after the show ended: He was seen in such movies as 12 Years a Slave (2013), the 2014 version of RoboCop, and 2016's Ghostbusters. He moved from one great HBO drama to another when he played Chalky White on Boardwalk Empire. Williams continued his epic run on HBO with a major role on the buzzed-about miniseries The Night Of and another on the horror drama Lovecraft Country.\n\nIn 2021, Williams died at the age of 54.\n\n04 of 34\n\nMichael B. Jordan (Wallace)\n\nBefore his turn as the sweet but ill-fated Wallace, Michael B. Jordan's few credits included a minor role in the 2001 Keanu Reeves film Hardball.\n\nWhere's Jordan now? He's everywhere. He spent a few years on All My Children, but his role as Vince on the last two seasons on Friday Night Lights started his rise to stardom. After FNL, he recurred on Parenthood and starred in the found-footage thriller Chronicle (2012).\n\nHis big break came in 2014 with Fruitvale Station, where he was heartbreaking in the true story of a young man's death at the hands of police. Jordan has gone on to roles in big franchises with Fantastic Four (2015), Creed (2015), and Black Panther (2018). Other projects include HBO's Fahrenheit 451 and A Journal for Jordan (2021). He made his directorial debut in 2023, helming Creed III.\n\n05 of 34\n\nAiden Gillen (Tommy Carcetti)\n\nBefore rising to power on The Wire as Mayor (and eventually Governor) Tommy Carcetti, Aiden Gillen came to prominence in the U.K. with his role alongside Charlie Hunnam on Queer as Folk.\n\nA few years after The Wire ended, Gillen returned to HBO as the cunning and untrustworthy Littlefinger on Game of Thrones. After landing on the big screen in the last two films of the Maze Runner franchise (2015, 2018) and Guy Ritchie's 2017 King Arthur movie, Gillen was also seen in the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) and Those Who Wish Me Dead (2021).\n\nGillen has also starred on such shows as Project Blue Book, Kin, and Mayor of Kingstown.\n\n06 of 34\n\nMethod Man (Melvin \"Cheese\" Wagstaff)\n\nThe rapper came into his role on The Wire as maybe the most notable member of the cast, primarily due to his music career, though he had appeared on Oz and starred in the stoner comedy How High (2001).\n\nDuring his run as Cheese, Method Man had his own short-lived Fox series titled Method & Red, while making appearances in Garden State (2004) and Soul Plane (2004). He has also released a few new albums over the years and made strong comedic impressions in Trainwreck (2015) and Keanu (2016). Like many of the actors in this gallery, Method Man reunited with David Simon for HBO's The Deuce.\n\nHe has a main role on the Starz drama series Power Book II: Ghost.\n\n07 of 34\n\nAmy Ryan (Beatrice \"Beadie\" Russell)\n\nPrior to playing Beadie Russell, a Port Authority cop and McNulty's girlfriend, Amy Ryan's most notable role was on the Téa Leoni sitcom The Naked Truth. In 2007, while still occasionally appearing on The Wire, she was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in Gone Baby Gone.\n\nRyan has continued a successful run in film with roles in Birdman (2014), Bridge of Spies (2015), and Central Intelligence (2016), but she's most known for her time on The Office, in which she ended up playing Holly Flax, a.k.a. Mrs. Michael Scott. She also appeared in a juicy role opposite Steve Martin on the Hulu series Only Murders in the Building.\n\n08 of 34\n\nReg E. Cathey (Norman Wilson)\n\nFor 20 years, Reg E. Cathey had steadily been working in the business, including a central role in David Simon's 2000 miniseries The Corner, before reuniting with Simon on The Wire.\n\nAfter his two-season run as Norman Wilson, Mayor Carcetti's campaign manager, Cathey eventually had a recurring role as Freddy on House of Cards, winning an Emmy award for his role. Cathey died in February 2018, at the age of 59.\n\n09 of 34\n\nTom McCarthy (Scott Templeton)\n\nAs the writer and director of The Station Agent (2003) and The Visitor (2008), Tom McCarthy had a successful behind-the-scenes career before taking on the role of Scott Templeton, season 5's fabricating reporter.\n\nMcCarthy hasn't acted much since The Wire ended, as he's been focused on his filmmaking. At the 2016 Academy Awards, Spotlight—which he wrote and directed—won Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. He also served as an executive producer and director on Netflix's hit series 13 Reasons Why and directed the 2021 film Stillwater.\n\n10 of 34\n\nLance Reddick (Cedric Daniels)\n\nLance Reddick was another Oz veteran to land a major role on The Wire, playing Cedric Daniels, the stern but loyal police leader.\n\nOnce the HBO drama ended, Reddick moved right on to two other successful television shows with a guest arc on Lost and a five-season run on Fringe. He has taken on additional roles on Amazon Prime Video's Bosch, Comedy Central's Corporate, and Netflix's Resident Evil. He also has a supporting role as Charon in the John Wick film series.\n\n11 of 34\n\nLawrence Gilliard Jr. (D'Angelo Barksdale)\n\nPreviously best known for 1998's The Waterboy, Lawrence Gilliard Jr. landed his big break with a one-and-a-half season stint as D'Angelo Barksdale, a drug dealer with whom you couldn't help but sympathize.\n\nThe Gangs of New York (2002) alum had a few short TV guest spots before joining the cast of The Walking Dead, on which he was a series regular for two years. Gilliard reunited with Simon on The Deuce, this time serving on the other side of the law.\n\n12 of 34\n\nPablo Schreiber (Nick Sobotka)\n\nHis turn as Nick Sobotka was only the second credit for Pablo Schreiber, who had previously appeared in Bubble Boy.\n\nThe actor has become a TV staple since leaving the show, with roles on Lights Out, Weeds, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Defending Jacob, Candy, and Halo. He received an Emmy nomination for his work as George \"Pornstache\" Mendez on Orange Is the New Black. Schreiber starred on the big screen in 2018's Den of Thieves and memorably played the feisty leprechaun Mad Sweeney on Starz's American Gods.\n\n13 of 34\n\nChad L. Coleman (Dennis \"Cutty\" Wise)\n\nJoining the show in season 3 was a huge break for Chad L. Coleman, whose most notable role previously had been in the 2002 TNT television film Monday Night Mayhem, in which he played O.J. Simpson.\n\nAfter his short but memorable stay as Cutty, he starred on Fox's I Hate My Teenage Daughter and had brief roles in Horrible Bosses (2011) and The Green Hornet (2011). Coleman made a big TV comeback with his run as Tyreese on The Walking Dead, Tobias Church on Arrow, and Klyden on the sci-fi comedy series The Orville.\n\n14 of 34\n\nSeth Gilliam (Ellis Carver)\n\nAnother Oz alum, Seth Gilliam also appeared in Courage Under Fire (1996) and Starship Troopers (1997) before playing Ellis Carver, an immature–turned–dedicated policeman.\n\nHe has since played a major recurring role on MTV's Teen Wolf and took on the role of Father Gabriel Stokes on The Walking Dead.\n\n15 of 34\n\nWendell Pierce (William \"Bunk\" Moreland)\n\nWendell Pierce was a veteran in the industry before landing the role of Bunk, homicide detective and long-suffering partner to McNulty.\n\nSoon after The Wire, he was back with Simon on HBO for the New Orleans-based series Treme. Pierce has been busy since, with roles on Suits, Chicago P.D., The Odd Couple, and the Amazon series Jack Ryan. He won a Tony award in 2012 for producing the play Clybourne Park. After starring as Willy Loman in a critically acclaimed production of Death of a Salesman in London on the West End in 2019, Pierce reprised the role on Broadway during the 2022–2023 season.\n\n16 of 34\n\nWood Harris (Avon Barksdale)\n\nWood Harris' first credit was a supporting role in the Tupac-led film Above the Rim (1994), but his most noteworthy pre-Wire work was as Julius in 2000's Remember the Titans.\n\nAfter his three seasons playing cold-blooded drug kingpin Avon Barksdale, Harris appeared on Justified alongside his brother Steve, and had supporting roles in Ant-Man (2015) and Creed (2015), while also costarring with fellow Wire alum Tristan \"Mack\" Wilds on VH1's The Breaks. Harris had a small role in 2017's Blade Runner 2049 and played Damon Cross on Empire and Spencer Haywood on HBO's Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty.\n\n17 of 34\n\nAndre Royo (Reginald \"Bubbles\" Cousins)\n\nWith only small roles like one-episode guest spots on Third Watch and Law & Order to his name, the role of Bubbles, the lovable character experiencing a drug problem, was a breakthrough for Andre Royo.\n\nPost-Wire, he appeared on Fringe and was one of many Wire alums in the George Lucas-produced film Red Tails (2012). Royo has also found success on TV with roles on Hand of God, Empire, and Truth Be Told.\n\n18 of 34\n\nChris Bauer (Frank Sobotka)\n\nA veteran of TV and movies, with credits for Third Watch, The Devil's Advocate (1997), and Face/Off (1997), Chris Bauer delivered an important performance in season 2 as Frank Sobotka, who turned to crime to help keep the Baltimore docks afloat.\n\nHe has continued to steadily work on TV, including a return to HBO for a seven-season run on True Blood. Bauer popped up as a detective on The People v. O.J.
