        "text": "Two years in the real world, one year in Baltimore. Things have changed and they’re still the same, which might well be, and is the underlying message of The Wire. The emphasis in season 4 is going to be the education system in America/Baltimore, but it’s also going to be the hopeless War on Drugs and the Political System as well.\n\nIt’s a slow start, the way they always are. A panorama of things as they are today before we move on into tomorrow, where things will develop. The Detail carries on, focussing now on Marlo Stanfield and his crew, Freamon now definitely the leading light, under a new and undiligent Lieutenant, so anonymous we don’t even get his name. Lester’s still following the money trail from Avon Barksdale, even though it looks like leading into City Hall. In Mayoral Election season.\n\nTommy Carcetti’s running, we see a lot of it and him. He’s the white guy up against two black candidates, one of them the incumbent. He’s polling in the middle but he needs his former friend Tony Grey to be taking a bigger bite out of Mayor Royce. It’s not going well for Tommy, in fact he’s not going to make it on the figures he’s seeing, the strain is eating him up, the demands from everywhere, fix this, fix that, the Spectre of Failure isn’t just hovering, he’s sharing the same breakfast table.\n\nOver in the Western, Major Daniels is failing in his attempts to persuade Jimmy McNulty to come back to Detective. Jimmy refuses: the simpler life of a patrol officer suits him, he’s calm, content, relaxed, not drinking anything like as much, content with Beadie Russell and ‘the ankle-biters’. Even Bunk can’t persuade him out on the piss. Meanwhile, Herc has moved onto the Mayor’s Security Detail (memories of Tim Bayliss in Homicide: Life on the Street, who volunteered for that role to get to Homicide, thinking cops: that’s not Herc’s path). And Carver has taken his former Mayor’s words to heart and is cheerfully and confidently building relationships with the cornermen and their crew, one of them Boadie Broadus, now a small-time operator himself.\n\nMarlo Stanfield is now the kingpin. His grip is even tighter than Barksdale’s was and he’s a chilling motherfucker, colder than a witch’s tit in Winter as people are wont to say. The Bunk muses about how he can rule such a big area without dropping bodies, there hasn’t been a drug-related murder in months, but the answer is simple, and it’s called Chris and Snoop.\n\nSnoop, or Felicia Pearson (character and actress), pops up in the open, in a hardware store looking for a top of the range nail gun, talking with a white middle-aged salesman who impresses her with his technical knowledge and recommendations. It’s a fascinating and mind-boggling scene as the two might as well be speaking different languages, more properly they’re aliens from different planets a Solar System apart. Snoop works with Chris Partlow. They kill people, they wrap the body in a curtain, salt it thoroughly with quicklime and leave it in an abandoned tenement house, behind a door cover. Nailed into place.\n\nNo room for everybody. Burrell and Rawles, Bubbles, Dennis Wise and Bunny Colvin appear only in the credits. New names appear in the cast, the most notable being Reg E Cathey as Norman Wilson, Carcetti’s Campaign Manager. And we see Prez in his new role, out of the Police, re-trained as a Teacher, feeling his way into his new profession at Ernest Tighman Middle School. Where, he will find, he will be teaching the four boys at the heart of this new season. Prez’s path echoes that of Ed Burns, David Simon’s collaborator, who went from Homicide to teaching himself.\n\nThese are Duquan ‘Dukie’ Weems (Jermaine Crawford), Randy Wagstaff (Maestro Harrell), Namond Brice (Julito McCullum) and Michael Lee (Tristan Wilds). Four teenagers, four black kids, growing up in West Baltimore, still at middle school, when they bother to attend. It’s summer vacation. We see them as kids playing in a tough environment. Namond is already in the Game, a cornerboy from Boadie: he’s the son of Wee-Bay from season 1, inside for life, and Boadie only employs him out of respect for his father.\n\nIt’s these four who we are here to watch in season 2, to see what life in West Baltimore will do to shape them. That’s the centre of what the next twelve weeks ae going to be about. In a sense, what everybody else does in this portrait of a city dying by inches is peripheral, however immersive it is. We are here to find out what happens to Dukie, Namond, Randy and Michael, who swims, who sinks. Be prepared. Be warned.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIf it had ended here, it would have been a good ending, it would have been complete. Everything tied up, everything resolved. Pointers to the future, because if a television series aspires to be anything like realistic it knows that there are no complete endings, that something else is always growing or diminishing, or at any rate yet to be resolved, one way or another. Dennis Wise looked to have lost his boxing gym students for a moment, but he and it carries on. Tommy Carcetti comes out in the open to run for Mayor. But from episode 1 of season 1 to today, it’s wound up, it’s been achieved.\n\nThat’s pretty much the sole purpose of this episode, tying pretty pink bows around everything and showing the aftermath of Stringer Bell’s execution as everything collapses inwards. All change, but at the same time, same as it ever was.\n\nThe open, as Bunk investigates the crime scene with Stringer’s blood-stained body still where it was, featured maybe the most telling scene in the whole series. McNulty’s there, silent, and so is Kima Greggs, but he’s the one who looks like his favourite game has been taken away from him and smashed. He’d won, but Stringer will never know it so it doesn’t count: how can I rise if you don’t fall?\n\nFrom here, so many things fall out. On the wire, everyone, except Avon Barksdale, assumes the hit was ordered by Marlo Stanfield, and thus there must be a war, even if it’s a war over a lie (an allegory for the Iraq War). Avon knows it wasn’t Marlo, that it was him. It was supposed to be business, but Avon hasn’t reckoned with what it really means, within him. What’s the point? But he will play along when the chance arises to smash Marlo, exact retribution.\n\nBut he doesn’t get the chance. From the other half of the parallel lines, ‘Bunny’ Colvin, whose career, reputation and life is going to be wrecked because of Hamsterdam, hands McNulty the address of Avon’s safe house, the one stocked up with arms. Do the Detail have enough for a Warrant? To make sure, Jimmy feeds the name of Colvin’s CI: Russell Bell.\n\nThe War never starts. The raid surrounds the house. Avon knows the game is up, that the choice is between shooting out, which will only get them the satisfaction of taking a few with them, or surrender and return to the system. He thinks he can survive it, but McNulty rubs his nose in Stringer’s betrayal of him, just as he betrayed Stringer. Dog eat Dog. In court, Marlo turns up to – what? gloat? as a mark of respect to his predecessor? Brianna, his sister, d’Angelo’s mother, won’t even look at him, won’t even stay to hear the sentence. The Barksdale organisation is brought down. Only Boadie Broadus gets out from under.\n\nThat’s not quite all but let’s turn our heads to that other parallel line. The Mayor is still trying to work Hamsterdam to his advantage but he who hesitates is lost. The TV stations descend en masse, leaving us to intuit that the tip-off came from someone with the initials TC. The shit hits the fan with a vengeance. All that is left is ducking, weaving, ass-covering and trying the hardest to get out with the least damage. Mayor Royce has waited too long. The Police are given the go-ahead to arrest everyone in sight in Hamsterdam, in Apocalypse Now fashion, down to the Ride of the Valkyries.\n\nOne body is found, OD-ed. It is Bubbles’ ex-protege, Johnny. That night, Hamsterdam is razed to the ground. But out of sight is not out of mind. Royce is going to throw Burrell to the wolves but Burrell will only take the hit on his own terms. The story about the Mayor’s Office’s response will in its detail depend on whether or not he gets confirmation of his permanent elevation to Commissioner. The real shit will all be dumped down on Bunny Colvin’s shoulders: busted down to Lieutenant to deny him his Major’s pension, dismissed, villified in the Press and to everyone, cost his job at Johns Hopkins.\n\nAnd it’s all part of David Simons’ argument that the War on Drugs is a futile war, an unwinnable war that can only be dealt with to the better effect on everyone by treating it as a given, and transformed into a health issue. That’s what Colvin did. Maybe it would work just as well if you practiced it in real life, and I rather think it might, but I still come back to Colvin’s motives. Part of the theme of The Wire, and especially this series, is the self-interest of authority versus the dedication of those actually exposed to the reality, but Colvin’s motives were never ‘pure’, he just wanted convenience for himself and his District, that’s why he started it. What happened after he stepped down was nothing to him.\n\nColvin got crushed. It probably wasn’t the show’s intention but honesty shone through irregardless, and you can’t escape the sense that he got what he deserved, or what he turned a blind eye to, thinking he could just walk away.\n\nRipples. There’s a vacancy for a Major: Daniels gets it and gets the Western District. His estranged wife is added to the Mayor’s ticket so his support is no longer necessary and he can go public with Rhonda Pearlman, yes and screw her vigorously too, just as we earlier got to see Kima enthusiastically getting it on with her wife.\n\nWe’re settling for it. This is everyone’s rewards and desserts. Bunk, the practical joker, who cuts off the ties of detectives asleep at their desks and displays them on a trophy board, falls asleep and has his cut off. Herc gets back to busting heads. And Jimmy?\n\nMcNulty’s had his own wires cut, the ones attached to the puppet-master’s controls. Daniels won’t have him in the Detail any longer becase he can’t trust him but McNulty’s ahead of him. Not to win, but to step back. McNulty thinks that the things that make him a good Police are the things that make him impossible. He’s been round to talk to Beadie Russell, not to get into her pants though he could have done, but to begin the process of building a life. He wants to go back to the Western. He voluntarily busts himself down to patrolman. We could leave him here and, if we were of a particularly sunny dispoition today, we could imagine him finally starting to grow up. We’d have to be bloody naive to do so, but if this were the last episode, which it finally turned out not to be, we might just have been able to con ourselves.\n\nLet’s prepare ourselves to leap two years in seven days. Season 4 awaits.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWhen we first watched this episode, I remember the shock of its ending. Long before we actually got to see any of The Wire we had associated it with Idris Elba, his break-out role, Stringer Bell, the performance that suddenly took him into the top rank. And, not even in the final episode of season 3, out of five, he was killed off. Cornered by the odd couple of Omar and Brother Mouzone, left without anything to argue to stop them from executing him. Shot dead. That they would so something like that was incredible. Television very rarely has that courage.\n\nEven now, a decade and a half later, in full knowledge of what Stringer’s fate will be, the impact is silencing. It takes time to come down from it, to realise that we and they have walked off a cliff.\n\nBut watching the episode with the ending in mind is a chance to appreciate in how many ways it is foreshadowed. For all his insistence on business, on being legit, once lawyer Levy, somewhat smugly, shows him how much Stringer has been ripped off by Senator Clay Bell, he reverts to the Game, demanding a kill on Davis. This time it’s Avon who shuts it down.\n\nThen the Detail works out a way to get a wiretap up on Stringer’s phone, at long last, and they record him, incriminating himself. They’ve got him. Three long years but the mission has been accompliced.\n\nMeanwhile, Stringer’s called up Bunny Colvin. He’s made a decision, a business decision, to shaft Avon, his brother-in-arms, his lifelong friend, his Brother, giving Colvin the address where Barksdale keeps his munitions, and where he can be found.\n\nWhy has Stringer shopped Avon? For that we have the balcony scene. Avon and Stringer on a balcony, overlooking the city at night. It’s the symbol of their dreams as snotty-nosed ghetto kids, their ‘Made it, Ma! Top of the World!’ Avon’s expansive, remembering things they’d done, their dreams. Stringer shuts it down, got no dreams no more, got real estate. Without it being said the audience understands that this is saying goodbye, that this is the end of their friendship. Avon does it with reminiscence, Stringer responds with betrayal to the Police.\n\nThe episode opened with this incredibly cool scene in a darkened alley at night, as Brother Mouzone catches up with the whistling Omar, to seek revenge for his shooting. Omar is unabashed: he will not stand down for anyone, he is as he always has been, prepared to die at any moment. Instead, they talk. Both have been set up. They will repay that attention together.\n\nIt’s incredible that three years work, careful, considered, complex, has been undertaken to reach this point. But when it does, it’s inevitable. Inexorable. The Wire.\n\nThis is not all, though it’s more than enough to be going on with. The exposure of Hamsterdam has caused shockwaves that ripple ever outward. Burrell, Rawls and the Police want to shut it down, instantly, right now, five minutes ago, why are we waiting, slam the door shut and count the busts, whilst it’s still possible that they can do it quietly, but Mayor Royce won’t let him. Because Mayor Royce is trying to find a way to square the outrage this is going to cause with a fourteen percent drop in recorded crime, city-wide, that’s genuine, which can only do him good.\n\nBurrell reads it as a plan to ensure that the highest part of the wall that the shit hits is at Acting Police Commisioner level, so he brings in Tommy Carcetti. Who tracks down Bunny Colvin, who’s been avoiding him, but who shows him around the Western District, the peaceful corners, the community that can now complain about trivial things… and Hamsterdam itself, that corner of Hell on Earth.\n\nAnd Jimmy’s surprised but pleased to get a call from Theresa d’Agostino, who’s drive up from Washington for a meal, a drink and a fuck with him. Except, she starts talking, artlessly, about Washington rumours about a renegade Baltimore Police Commander who’s legalised drugs, what was his name, Covin? Jimmy’s so offended by being manipulated and pumped that he leaves: yes, McNulty refuses a shag. He must be pissed off.\n\nOne last, almost incidental thing to mention for reasons that will become clear later. Bubbles, still pushing his trolley of white t-shirts through Hamsterdam, takes on a new, enterprising black kid as a partner. His old partner, Johnny, gets a fix. That’s all. That’s the penultimate week of season 3.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt’s all about trajectories now. Everyone, and there are so many players, is set on their course and cannot, will not be moved from them. And those courses lie across each others’ paths. A crunch is coming.\n\nSo much we know from the open. Barksdale’s hitting Marlo’s corners, bringing the action back to the corners, bodies dropping. Brother Mouzone (Michael Potts is so good in this role, calm, clever, confident, doing the least amount but dominating the screen every second he’s on it) is back in town with the reluctant Lamar, looking for the man who shot him, and not to shake hands.\n\nThere are little things of great wonder. Colvin brings Carver in for a talk, respecting his loyalty but stripping him bare as being no good at policing, and Seth Gilliam sits there and takes it, immobile, silent, not letting any response show.\n\nAnd the briefest moment: Mouzone sends the ultra-homophobic Lamar round gay bars, trying to track Omar. In the last one it brings out Omar’s boyfriend to follow him and be taken by the Brother. But it also offers five seconds of some guy at the bar, drinking, laughing, completely relaxed: Major Rawls.\n\n(This is indeed a moment of genius because, from the perspective of having seen all sixty episodes before, this has no bearing on anything else. It doesn’t form part of a plot point, it isn’t een mentioned ever again. It’s just an Easter Egg for the audience, a revelation and a sign that people’s sexuality can be and usually are completely irrelevant.)\n\nElsewhere, Jimmy is still being a petulant, ADHD four year old, impatient and head strong. His experience with Theresa D’Agostino has genuinely hurt him, made him feel shallow and unwanted. There’s a reason for that but Jimmy wouldn’t recognised it if it were painted on his eyeballs: he’s as shallow as fuck. Everybody tells him that all the time but he never listens. Then he sees a police officer that he thinks is Beadie Russell and goes tearing off after her, but it’s not.\n\nThe Detail’s struggling because the burner phones have already been ditched. He and Lester come up with the same thought, pre-wiretapped phones, put in the crew’s hands like a magician putting the chosen card into his audience stooge’s mitt. It’s unprecedented but Judge Phelan, influenced by Rhonda Pearlman crossing her legs in an above-the-knee skirt goes for it.\n\nOffscreen, Prez’s shooting is taken up by IAD.\n\nStringer is fightng a losing battle. Avon sets him up with bodyguards who are supposed to never leave his side, and spy on everything he does. Proposition Joe threates him, with the Co-op behind him, that if he can’t shut down Avon, the Barksdale crew will be cut off from the good shit.\n\nDennis Wise is starting to establish his boxing club, hard going though it is.\n\nThat’s the thing about The Wire. All the stuff I’ve talked about above, which doesn’t included Tommy Carcetti’s Mayoral Campaign, because all we’re getting is snippets of that story, even though this is the ‘Political’ season. So much happening that I’ve got this far without the magic word: Hamsterdam.\n\nBecause it’s got to the tipping point. A reporter from the Baltimore Sun, acting on Herc’s tip-off, has seen Hamsterdam for himself and is in shock. Colvin cons him into holding off for a week, it’s an enforcement strategy, Command knows. They don’t. But the time has come to tell them. Shit usually rolls downhill, but this time it’s a geyser, spouting upwards. Rawls. Burrell. Mayor Royce. Colvin takes sole responsibility – and vacation time – but there’s no doubt about it: the shit has hit the fan and it’s an industrial blower…\n\nThere are two episodes left to season 3. At the time it was being made, it was not known if it would be further renewed. Indeed there would be a two year gap until the series returned. For these closing episodes the scripting had to be careful, in case they were unknowingly writing a finale. It begins to show here.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAnd when it collapses, it collapses inwards, like a black hole.\n\nSome of it is slow, fighting the gravitational pull. Some of it is sudden, tragic. Some of it is halfway between, such as Jimmy McNulty.\n\nTheresa d’Agostino summons him in the night in the open, to leave his kids alone whilst he comes to fuck her. Jimmy’s not satisfied with just being a stud – Lester will burst his self-important bubble when he goes on about how the Detail, and himself, are the only real dick-swinging cops in Baltimore, by pointing out that Jimmy has nothing but the job, has no life, is a wholly empty man – Jimmy wants a date but when he gets it the difference between him and the classy Theresa becomes more gaping with every forced line of conversation, a void he can’t cross and she won’t descend to.\n\nThen there’s Hamsterdam. First, in conversation with the Deacon, Major Colvin digs a hole underneath himself, undermining any pretence to moral ground, high or low. Sure, he’s cleaned up the majority of his District, but he’s created an unstable situation that grows more unstable every hour. And he doesn’t care. He’s just looking to see out his time, get his pension, take up a role as Head of Security at Johns Hopkins that he’s secured, and whatever chaos or chasm Hamsterdam becomes at that point is no longer his business. When the bubble bursts, it will burst all over everyone except him.\n\nAnd it’s going to burst. The Detail, or rather Jimmy and Kima, are keeping their mouth shut on it but they’re still trying to get closer to Barksdale and Stringer, sending a wired Bubbles in to try to get to Boadie’s cellphone for a wiretap. But some kid breaks the rules and drops a body in Hamsterdam. Carver, who now has the fanaticism of the convert, gets the uniformed Police to drag it outside before homicide arrive: protect the project.\n\nIt’s the turning point. Carver’s best buddy, Herc, has had enough. Fuck this shit. He won’t help. And he drops a dime to the news desk of the Baltimore Sun.\n\nFor now, Colvin will keep the plate spinning. He takes responsibility for the easily-penetrated ruse. He lays down the Law. Stringer gives the nod and a kid turns himself in. Did he do it? Who cares?\n\nAvon is still determined not to see beyond a certain point in the past when he was King and owned his corners. Everyone else, except Marlo, is in with this new, Co-Operative way of doing things, they want it to carry on, only Avon (and Marlo) still cling to their blinkers. Avon’s reconciled to Stringer’s revelation about Dee, but he’s troubled enough that an injudicious word arouses Brianna’s suspicions. And Stringer has made a grave mistake, authorising a breach of the Sunday truce by giving the go-ahead to a shot at Omar as he’s escorting his silver-haired, Sunday crowned grandma to Church. She loses her hat, he loses his rag. Bad idea.\n\nBut the worst comes from out of left-field and it’s Prez. He’s in his element, working alongside Lester, analysing, using his head, his knack for puzzles, contributing where, in every other respect, he was crap as a cop. And it goes in an instant, just like that. He and Jimmy go for Chinese for the Detail. They respond to a nearby call. Prez sees a figure with a gun and shoots him dead. It’s an undercover cop. Daniels tries to protect him but Prez knows he’s finished, he won’t even call in a lawyer. He’d done, he’s out. Daniels puts him on suicide watch.\n\nIn an instant. Everything, every bit of good he can do, collapsed. Into a black hole. Just ahead of everything else that will follow it.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThere comes a point in every season of The Wire when you can feel the tectonic plates shift or, to use the vernacular of the show, shit becomes real. This was the week.\n\nThough outwardly episode 8 was just a continuation and extension of this season’s themes, it was the one in which everything was turned on its head. Not overtly. Nothing changed on the surface but behind, beneath, it all became different.\n\nThe open was pure black comedy. We’re in Hamsterdam, so comically overflowing with hustlers, a regular open air market, but also a place where predators can drag off one particular lot of dealers and rob them at gun point. Leading said victims to complain vociferously to the Police that they entitled to protection…\n\nMajor Colvin takes that seriously. The four of them go down the station, play identikit facial reconstruction, joined by Herc, until they’re building sexy faces on girls and wanting to know if there’s a machine that does asses. Carver looks on disdainfully. Officer Anthony Collichio hates the whole damned thing, playing up to this scum.\n\nColvin’s doing everything he can to keep his experiment going. He brings round the Deacon (Melvin Williams, a former real-life Baltimore drugs lord) to show him, first how quiet, clean and normal the corners are, and then how it’s done. The Deacon is horrified. Hamsterdam is a distortion, a miniature Hell.\n\nIt’s still a secret but Colvin wants it to keep going. The hustlers get Police protection. A private social concern organisation, not the City, under the radar, is brought in to provide condom, needle-exchange, STD shots. Tommy Carcetti notices and can’t believe the drastic drop in stats in the Western District. Rawls quizzes Colvin about massaging statistics that will get all of them put in jail. It’s working, but is it working?\n\nThis is an episode when the reality is drummed in, by example not explanation, that Hamsterdam isn’t real. It can’t last, no matter what Colvin does to keep it on the high wire, and when it falls the status quo will revert in a heartbeat.\n\nA brief diversion into what, for now, is still only a side story, and that’s Cutty, or Dennis as he now wants to be known. Dennis is seeking something, some way to take control of his life. The Deacon helps him. He shows him Hamsterdam, introduces one of the newcomers, seeking to provde some kind of structure to the kids’ lives. They’re playing basketball with shop crates as improvised baskets. Dennis is not a ball game guy, but boxing… They take him to a nearby boxing gym. It’s one of those scenes where nothing is said or done. It’s a proper, busy set-up. Three of them walk in. Dennis doesn’t even notice the two behind him stop. He just walks on. No gestures, no demonstrations, but you can see Dennis growing before your eyes. Chad Coleman is simply brilliant.\n\nBack to the other side of the story. Avon persists in wanting to revert, and in wanting to catch both Omar and Marlo and deal with them the way that shows his strength, his power. That’s the past. Stringer, or Russell, is seeking the future with the aid of the blatantly corrupt Senator Clay Davis. Three years, Davis promises. Stringer wants it now. He’s ready to run. but he’s not. He’s still bound up in that gangster mentality that refuses payment, refuses investment. Money does not get spent, it comes in, and obstacles are to be stepped on, not worked round. Their ‘brotherhood’ is fraying and it’s going to break, it’s just when and how.\n\nAnd Stringer has another problem. Brianna comes to see Jimmy about d’Angelo’s death. It’s another masterpiece scene as McNulty, quiet, casual, dismissive and even vicious, manipulates her to the point where she’s not going to let this go. McNulty’s an asshole, but this is him doing his job in a way that is quite genius. It could have been Frank Pembleton in the Box in Homicide: Life on the Street, and I can’t praise anything higher than that.\n\nBrianna wants Avon. Stringer wants to head her off. Avon’s laying a honeytrap for Marlo but Marlo’s paranoid about something like that. His team susses the danger out. One soldier is killed and Avon is wounded in the shoulder. He wants immediate revenge. Stringer tries to divert him. It escalates, until Stringer, goaded by the accusation that he isn’t hard enough, he’s never dropped a body, tells Avon which body he coldly, deliberately and with good reason did have dropped. D’Angelo.\n\nThey fight. Stringer easily wins. A long silence, broken only by gasps for air and the wall of tension that overwhelms the screen, ends in the closing theme music. Things have shifted.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWatching the open immediately brought to mind Ronnie Scott’s classic line about the bouncers being outside, throwing them in. Hamsterdam is up and running, in full swing, yet there are still dealers on corners who haven’t got the message. So Bunny Colvin gives Carver and his men carte blanche to spread the message to these non-conformists, which they proceed to do in some wonderfully imaginative manners, with nary a head bust.\n\nBut this turned out to be an episode without much else to laugh at, in however a black manner. It was an episode in which certain things were not trailed but given their first, spectral outline, more clearly visible when you’re watching with foreknowledge of what is to come. Most of all, what I took from this episode were a series of compare-and-contrasts, spread out amongst certain players, that exemplified the futility of everything in this War, this Game.\n\nAvon’s back. In his absence, the Game has changed, been changed by Stringer Bell, whose aspirations have ascended to legit business, Business as opposed to the Game. But Avon hasn’t changed. Avon wants to go back, wants things as they were. He wants his corners, his ‘property’, he wants to be out in front. Not so much everyone looking up to him, but everyone being afraid of him. It doesn’t help that he’s arrived at a point where the realities, the corrupt realities, of development are making themselves apparent to Stringer, who doesn’t like it but accepts its necessity.\n\nAvon’s a gangster. Always has been, always will be. He refuses to understand anything else. Compare him to Marlo Stanfield. Dead-eyed Marlo. Marlo is a gangster. He refuses to co-operate because if you co-operate you don’t get to wear the crown, and Marlo wants to wear the crown. He wants his time. Avon’s already said he’s lived longer than he expected. Marlo expects not to last. He’ll end up being dropped. But he will end up wearing the crown for his time. It’s the Game.\n\nCompare Bunny Colvin. Compare Jimmy McNulty. Compare Cedric Daniels. Compare Bunk Moreland. Four ways of policing. Daniels is still dressing up for his separated wife, supporting her political career, repaying her for the disappointment he proved to be in his police career. It’s putting a strain on his relationship with Rhonda Pearlman. Bunk’s released to pursue the murder of Tosha. It leads him to Omar, who shuts all lines down. Bunk’s provoked into a passionate and moving outburst about how the community they both come from, standing in for the city, has deteriorated. Omar’s response is a long streak of spit. Colvin’s scheming around Hamsterdam, which only he and his men know about. But another classic quote springs to mind. Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive. Just like The Picts and the Martyrs, the lie to conceal has to spread.\n\nBut Jimmy. Ah, Jimmy McNulty. McNulty’s the hero, Dominic West gets his name first in the credits each week, everyone else has to settle for alphabetical order. He’s the maverick cop. But he’s not. He’s the asshole of assholes, who has never grown up, not even a fraction, it’s always got to be what he wants, now, and fuck everyone else, especially anyone who stands in his way. Even with Greggs now fully in his camp he can’t get Daniels to let them re-open on Bell and Barksdale. Second time they try they face his white hot fury and get thrown out. It doesn’t stop McNulty. McNulty’s the guy who’ll openly shit on his wife, ‘got her hooks into’ this lawyer guy and he certainly won’t stop at going over Daniel’s head via Bunny Colvin.\n\nI’ve lost patience with him. He’s an intolerable shit in every respect. What he does in season 5… well, we’ll get to that.\n\nOne last almost detached thread. Brianna is doing Donelle’s hair. Shyly, she brings up her relationship with Stringer, afraid of disapproval, but Brianna essentially blesses her. Emboldened, she brings up Jimmy, and his theory that d’Angelo was not a suicide. Brianna takes in that thought.\n\nBut we come back to the Game and, between Barksdale and Stanfield the Game has gone back to the corners. Avon wants them, Marlo has them. Cutty organises an attack which blows up when the support team jump the gun and get at least two of them killed. Next, he and Slim Charles attack on their own. Slim Charles blows away a 14 year old kid. Cutty’s got Fruit in his sights, on his back. But he can’t pull the trigger, he just can’t. To Avon he admits it. Whatever he had to play the Game, he hasn’t got it any more. It’s gone. Avon weighs him up and then lets him go. Slim Charles muses that Cutty used to be a man. Avon says he’s still a man.\n\nOn which note…\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAt this point we are exactly halfway through The Wire, though not yet halfway through season 3: thirty episodes watched, thirty to go.\n\nAnd there was, as usual, a lot happening, though the threads seemed fewer in retrospect. The main thing this week was the establishhment of Hamsterdam. It’s slow-going, a slog, and in the end it involves not only pulling in the middle-level – save for Marlo Stanfield, who just won’t go – to tell them the future, and then virtually bussing in the corner boys and, given the logic of capitalism, the customers to follow them. There is a high degree of black comedy to this, expressed most perfectly by Johnny, Bubbles’ partner, who can’t take it in, gaping like he’s on a bad trip. Sometimes I forget just how goddam funny the show can be.\n\nEverything plays off something. In the open, Johnny’s seriously offended by Bubbles playing snitch for money. It’s not the Game, not the rules. You don’t snitch, well, ok, if it gets you out of arrest, but you don’t do it for a living. Street tricks, hand to mouth, or rather hand to vein, is fine. Silently, the episode shows Johnny making $10 from a scam and Bubbles making $40 from information to Kima.\n\nOther things are happening. Avon’s out, on parole, greeted by Stringer, treated by Stringer. He’s finding out things have changed behind his back. Stringer’s taking everything legit. Business school, property development, talking all the dealers into a Co-Operative, where they all work together, get the best shit for the best prices, resolve their divisions by Committees, instead of bodies. Not all the dealers though, Marlo just won’t go. (Jamie Hector is dazzling, doing more with less, less movement, less speaking, sheer obduracy.)\n\nMcNulty’s still wasting his time tailing Stringer. Stringer’s gotten away. Freamon makes him see abrupt sense, pointing out that Bell has insulated himself from theGame. His burgeoning Empire is impentrable, merging legit profit with Game profit and no-one can separate it out. McNulty throws his hand in, gets with the Detail on Kintell Williamson. He’s still got to be stupid though, turning up with Elena to discuss a potential school for Michael, getting bored within thirty seconds, picking up and fucking this hotshot who turns out to be Tommy Carcetti’s campaign manager, Theresa ‘Terry’ D’Agostino, who takes him back to her place, fucks him rigid (wthout taking her bra off, so Network) then kicks him out.\n\nStill, he gets a high, late on, as Kima, keeping an eye on Marlo, calls him in to witness Marlo’s meeting with… Stringer Bell. Stringer’s explaining the benefits of the Co-Op, Marlo’s not listening but Kima and Jimmy are exultant: Bell’s not that insulated from the drugs after all.\n\nI’ve mentioned Carcetti, he’s got his game to play. In a callback to The Wire‘s very first episode there’s been a State’s Witness murdered. Carcetti’s infuriated about this, so much so he’s not going to play politicsabout it. He wants the Mayor taking immediate action, for the good of Baltimore. Only if he doesn’t will Tommy take this public. The Mayor agrees. He also agrees to keep Tommy ‘in the loop’. Yeah, you bet. Tommy Carcetti is determined to become Mayor.\n\nAnd lastly, there’s Cutty. He’s lying to his grandmother – who he calls Mee-Maw: guess it’s not just Sheldon Cooper then – about still going straight, he’s walking out on the Church when he realises Grace has no interest in him and the Church has no easy options to be taken up. He’s back in the Game, soldier that he was and is now again. But something’s changed in Cutty. Something’s reacting. He can’t just do it like he’s told and have no doubts about it…\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOfficially, this episode’s title is ‘Hamsterdam’, but it was supposed to be ‘Amsterdam’ and it’s credited that way in imdb and on some of the DVD/BluRay releases. I’m going with what I know.\n\nFour episodes in and we’re still trying to plait strands of mist, but now there’s this iceberg, looming up out of the fog, radiating power, confidence, chill and disaster. It’s Bunny Colvin’s idea, not that the corner boys are taking to it seriously, yet. They know the Game, they comfortable with it, they don’t want it changing, even for the better. Because Colvin’s idea means rules being imposed, imposed on them by the Police, and they only accept their own rules being imposed by themselves: the Game. Why do you want to fuck with the program?\n\nColvin’s idea is David Simon’s idea. Simon believes that the War on Drugs is not so much lost as unwinnable, that the drugs should be legalised, turning the problem from war, death, crime and a puritan crusade into a health problem, manageable and far less destructive. He may be right. If you take a moral sense out of the equation, he probably is right. Bunny Colvin’s going to turn it into an example. Me, the only drug I take that isn’t prescribed is alcohol, and not that much of that, I have no dog in this show. But this is what is going to symbolise season 3: can you do this?\n\nEverything else is just the flux. Tommy Carcetti’s going to run for Mayor, eveen though he’s white in a black city. Cutty’s losing faith in the straight life and spiralling back inwards, to become the soldier he used to be. Bunk’s still chasing Dozerman’s gun. Stringer Bell’s meeting with business leaders after his business classes, looking to get in on the ground floor on the next tranche of redevelopment. Going legit. Avon’s parole hearing comes up: he’s coming back. Donette’s telling him about McNulty sniffing round d’Angelo’s ‘suicide’. There are clouds along more than one horizon.\n\nMcNulty. McNulty’s the hero but this is not his episode for showing it. McNulty’s the cowboy, the renegade, the hero on the white horse, off the reservation, fuck the reseervation, fuck everything except what he wants this fucking minute. The Detail’s got an assignment but McNulty isn’t playing, he’s still after Stringer Bell, and he’s dragging Kima Greggs into line with him. There’s a massive fuck-you fallout with Freamon demonstrating just how petulant a little kid McNulty is. He’s shitty to Elena over four months arrears of alimony. Twice he gets pissed out of his head, and McNulty pissed out of his head makes McNulty sober look sane and conformist, turning up at Rhonda Pearlman’s front door at god-knows-when in the morning, knocking on her door, banging on her door, roaring his head off like she’s under some duty to open her legs to him whenever he wants to wank himself off into her. No, McNulty exposes himself as some nasty piece of work here. Hero? No.\n\nAnd that iceberg is drifting closer and closer and we all know what icebergs mean.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI didn’t watch this episode at the time I would have expected to, being of no fit mind for reasons that shall remain private. And I felt the dislocation, enough that it was hard to make myself catch up, and perhaps enough to affect my appreciation of this episode, because it’s still a jumble, a disconnection, and I couldn’t thread any of the strands together. What stood out most, confident, true, solid and with the fullest intent, had nothing to do with the story or the season.\n\nI will leave that to last. I still can’t interpret, just list things that happened. Omar pulls another raid on a Barksdale stash-house, but this one goes wrong, there’s a street battle, his girl Tosha is killed (one analysis claims by friendly fire). The Police mistake her for a civilian. Stringer Bell has her given the full treatment at the Funeral Parlour, to tempt Omar in to pay his respects, but he watches from a distance.\n\nThe word is out after the blunder over Cheese. Prop Joe passes it on to Stringer, to take precautions about the wire. Daniels switches it off. in keeping with the new political directives coming down from the Mayor, crime stats have got to drop. Major Mervin Taylor, fall guy to Rawls’ contempt these past two weeks, can’t get with the program and is fired on the spot. Bunny Colvin goes in without massaging the stats at all. He gets a roasting, but he has an idea, a plan. He told his fellow Commanders what it was. They thought it was a joke.\n\nThe Detail’s next target is in the Northwestern Division, a corner dealer of no account, but he’s rumoured to have dropped bodies so Daniels’ team is helping with the push on the murder count. McNulty is openly contemptuous but then he is of anything that isn’t his private war with Stringer Bell for getting one over him. He’s been up to the prison, proven to his satisfaction that d’Angelo wasn’t a suicide. He couldn’t have been.\n\nCutty’s still drifting. His Ma has told him where to find his old girl and he’s dressed up to see her. She’s a schoolteacher now, she’s active with the Church, she has a son. His heart’s still set on her but that’s not going to happen.\n\nKima’s picking up Bubbles again, despite Johnny’s almost violent attempts to head him off.\n\nColvin announces his plan to his command. Three districts. Run-down, deserted, away from schools, residences, businesses. The dealers can deal there where they can’t anywhere else. Outside, they’ll be hassled, beaten – like Marlo’s crew do to one of the Barksdale corners threatening to cut their profits – arrested. Inside, they can conduct business. Colvin’s going to ‘legalise’ drugs there. He claims it’s building up a false sense of security, once they relax, get into it, find it easy and convenient, they become fish in a barrel rather than in an ocean. So much easier to aim and shoot.\n\nBut that’s not what came over to me the strongest. No, remember that after season 2 Executive Producer Robert F Colesberry died, even though he’s still being credited. Colesberry also played the bit role of Detective Ray Cole. The word comes through, down at the Police Gym, Cole collapsed and died. They hold a Police Wake for him at Cavanaghs, the Irish Bar. The body laid out on the pool table with booze and cigars. The Detectives in attendance. Landsman delivers an honest eulogy, sincere and moving, reminding everyone that he had his good and bad times but that Ray Cole was one of them. The Pogues sing ‘The Body of an American’ and the Detectives roar it out too. It’s a strange and esoteric thing, respectful and disrespectful at one and the same time but it had the weight of tradition behind it, this is how we do it, and it was real because it was the real man, turned into fiction, a catharsis for all. If it hadn’t happened, this scene would never have been written and there would have been no gap, not even a hairline to make you feel there had been an omission, but it was the heart of the episode, and in light of the reason I had had to delay watching and writing about it, it was beautiful.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
