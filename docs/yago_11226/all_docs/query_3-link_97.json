        "text": "100. Officer Eddie Walker\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 2\n\n# of Episodes: 6\n\nPortrayed by: Jonnie Louis Brown\n\nOne of the most awful cops in a show that could just as easily be called “These Cops Are Bad People”. His entire purpose is to terrorize the people on his beat, including breaking kids’ fingers like the psychopath he is. Not a whole lot more to this character but he inspires intense emotions and to me he’s one of the more memorable heels in Season 4.\n\n99. Miss Duquette\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 7\n\n# Episodes: 6\n\nPortrayed by: Stacie Davis\n\nMiss Duquette is the head teacher of the classroom of delinquents that Bunny collects in S4, and anyone who’s worked in education (especially special education) can relate to the kind of behaviors she sees and the techniques she uses to reach the kids. I’m surprised they didn’t do more with this character, because I think it could have added an interesting dimension to the school storylines.\n\n98. Bug\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 2\n\n# Episodes: 11\n\nPortrayed by: Keenon Brice\n\nAlthough we won’t officially meet Michael Lee until much later in this list, we can at least meet the center of his world: his little brother Bug. In many ways, Bug is more of a symbol than a character, but he represents something rare in the series: true innocence. Bug is the driving force behind Michael’s story as we see the lengths he will go to in order to shield him from harm. Even as things start getting out of control in his life, his love for Bug is clear (and made all the more believable by how adorable Keenon Brice is in the role).\n\n97. Devar Manigualt\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 8\n\n# Episodes: 3\n\nPortrayed by: Cyrus Farmer\n\nOne of the most subtly written storylines in The Wire is the story of Michael’s trauma. Where some shows might hit you over the head with “THIS BOY WAS ABUSED” The Wire trusts its actors to convey incredibly complex emotions in facial expressions and body language. When you see Michael refuse money from Marlo, shake Cutty’s hand off his shoulder, or ask him to drop him off blocks away from his apartment rather than ride alone in a van with him — these are the behaviors of a child who has been groomed before. This is when we start to realize that Michael has been a victim, and the desire to never be one again is what drives his entire story.\n\nAnd it all comes back to this man, this evil bastard who we meet in Episode 8 when he comes home early from prison. Putting a face to the abuse we know Michael has suffered creates a visceral fear for the viewers, as we see Michael truly shook for the first time. Devar’s death scene at the hands of Chris Partlow is arguably the most brutal death in the series. Even though he’s not around long, he’s there long enough to make a big impression both on Michael and the audience.\n\n96. Brandon Wright\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 3\n\n# Episodes: 4\n\nPortrayed by: Michael Kevin Darnall\n\nBrandon is another character whose importance to the story is in what he (and his death) means to the other characters. Omar’s open affection for Brandon makes even members of his own crew uncomfortable, but it also paints a target on his back when that crew knocks down some Barksdale row houses. Omar’s grief over the way the Barksdales torture and kill Brandon sets off a chain of events that spans 3 full seasons. But it’s also the beginning of the end for Wallace, one of the most iconic and tragic characters in the series, after he ends up feeling responsible for turning Wee Bey onto Brandon at the arcade.\n\n95. Caroline Massey\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 10\n\nPortrayed by: Joilet F. Harris\n\nWhy did my girl Massey only get 10 episodes? She crushed it in Season 3 — great chemistry with Lester, Sydnor, and Prez, not to mention integral to cracking the communications picked up on the wire. It’s almost like Simon and Burns have no idea how to write female characters….\n\n94. Marla Daniels\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 2\n\n# Episodes: 16\n\nPortrayed by: Maria Broom\n\nAlright, let’s talk about that. Before I talk about Marla, let’s talk about female characters in The Wire.\n\nThere are inexcusably few true, 3D female characters in this show. It is SUCH an absurd sausagefest. This is, to me, by far the most salient criticism of the series and one that has aged particularly badly. Sure, law enforcement, drug dealing, dock work, and politics are largely male-dominated fields — so in a way it makes sense that a cast centering on those trades would skew male. But there’s “skews male” and there’s “5 or fewer female characters with anything resembling character development” and that is piss poor. I refuse to believe the only way to tell that story was through comprehensively patriarchal perspectives. If there’s anything that prevents The Wire from being unequivocally “the best show ever” in my mind, it’s that it fails so critically in the gender diversity of its cast. Between my first viewing 10 years ago and now, I’ve seen too many shows benefit so much from true diversity to believe that The Wire wouldn’t have been that much better with a stronger commitment to real representation.\n\nMarla Daniels is a good example of a character who had compelling moments, but was never given enough narrative complexity to become an interesting character. Essentially there to dispense questionable wisdom to Cedric while he battles the BPD chain of command, she eventually pursues her own political career while their marriage continues on in name only. We aren’t shown much of anything from her perspective, and rather than work her into a more integral role in Season 3 and beyond, they put her on the shelf as an occasional prop in Cedric’s ascent up the ladder.\n\n93. Curtis Anderson aka Lex\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 1\n\nPortrayed by: Norman Jackson\n\nPossibly a controversial pick for Top 100 because he’s a character who dies in the same episode we meet him. But in that time, he sets in motion events that drive many important characters’ stories forward in a major way. Him murdering Fruit is an incredible scene and fantastic introduction to a pretty gruesome season.\n\n92. Theresa D’Agostino\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 4\n\n# Episodes: 15\n\nPortrayed by: Brandy Burre\n\nAnother character who feels like she could have been much more, but nonetheless is pretty effective in what she is. It’s pretty satisfying to watch her chew up McNulty and spit him out, and her political maneuvering on the Carcetti campaign is damn impressive. I was surprised they didn’t use her in Season 5 in some way, even in peripherally, but she’s still around long enough to see a little development. Disappointing that the last time we see her she’s being used as a plot device to make Tommy Carcetti seem less slimy.\n\n91. Coleman Parker\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 15\n\nPortrayed by: Cleo Reginald Pizana\n\nWatching Mayor Royce’s re-election fall apart in real time wouldn’t have been so much fun if it weren’t for his campaign manager Coleman Parker getting progressively more exasperated at every turn. His character never amounts to anything in the larger narrative, but he gets a fun scene before he leaves where he laughs with Royce, Carcetti, and Norman about how hard they went after each other in the election, reminding us that the game of politics has very different rules than the game in the streets.\n\n90. Michael Santangelo\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 25\n\nPortrayed by: Michael Salconi\n\nOl’ Santy—good on the dunkers, not so much on the stone cold whodunnits. A terrible cop, but more on the bumbling side than the actively harmful side. He never amounts to much but he pops up here and there throughout all 5 seasons and always seems a little out of his depth in a weirdly endearing kind of way.\n\n89. Dante\n\nFirst seen: Season 2 Episode 3\n\n# Episodes: 9\n\nPortrayed by: Ernest Waddell\n\nWhen Omar comes back into the fray in Season 2, he’s got a new man by his side — lover and partner in crime, Dante. They discover another stick-up crew hitting their marks, and eventually join forces. Though it’s a team-up that initially bears fruit, it ends in tragedy after Dante accidentally kills Tosha in the middle of a robbery turned shoot out. That drives a wedge in the team and sets into motion Omar’s development for much of Season 2 — ultimately bringing Bunk and Omar together for some of the best scenes in the series as Bunk tries to solve Tosha’s murder.\n\n88. Rupert Bond\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 7\n\n# Episodes: 8\n\nPortrayed by: Dion Graham\n\nBond is a minor character who exists on the periphery of the Carcetti storyline, but by beating Demper out for State’s Attorney he is lowkey a big part of the supposed “new day for Baltimore”. Just by promoting Rhonda and empowering her with resources, he singlehandedly becomes one of the most competent bosses in the series. Still, despite being wildly competent, he’s dealt a surprise defeat when Clay Davis wriggles out of his grasp, giving us one of the more memorable court room scenes in the series.\n\n87. Shaun McGinty aka Shamrock\n\nFirst seen: Season 2 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 20\n\nPortrayed by: Richard Burton\n\nShamrock is a super underrated soldier in the Barksdale crew. He steps up in Season 2 when he becomes a solid right hand man for Stringer when Avon is in prison. He especially shines in the Roberts Rules of Order scenes and for taking notes “on a criminal fuckin’ conspiracy.”\n\n86. Thomas Pakusa aka Horseface\n\nFirst seen: Season 2 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 12\n\nPortrayed by: Charley Scalies\n\nHorseface doesn’t do much besides sit there and look pretty. He also dabbles in smuggling and a little light human trafficking as a cargo checker for the International Brotherhood of Stevedores. As Frank Sobotka’s right hand man, Horse gets a lot of peripheral screen time and usually makes the most of it. He’s often seen being gross, talking about Frank’s shriveled dick or pontificating on fake tits while leafing through a porn mag. Give him credit though, he’s as loyal to his brotherhood as any soldier in the game. When the cops try to take him down to the station, and he stonewalls them, it serves early notice that the dock workers won’t be folding like West Baltimore corner boys.\n\n85. Johnny Weeks\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 14\n\nPortrayed by: Leo Fitzpatrick\n\nEven though The Wire is primarily concerned with the larger systems surrounding the drug trade in Baltimore, it also gives us a glimpse inside the belly of the beast — the addicts themselves, and the horrors they endure living their lives on the street. We meet Johnny as a relatively new addict, learning the ropes from obvious veteran Bubbles. The two form an odd but dynamic duo, attempting hair brained schemes to get their next fix. When one such scheme backfires and Johnny gets a beating, it motivates Bubbles to snitch on the Barksdales.\n\nWe never see things get better for Johnny, who recovers from his beating but never finds his way out of addiction. It’s hard to feel sympathy for Johnny when he’s doing his best to pull Bubbles down with him, but it doesn’t make it any easier to see him lying dead in a Hamsterdam rowhouse in Season 3.\n\n84. Dennis Mello\n\nFirst seen: Season 2 Episode 9\n\n# Episodes: 18\n\nPortrayed by: Jay Landsman\n\nYes, you read that right — Bunny’s loyal sidekick was played by the REAL Jay Landsman, and yes he was a longtime Homicide Squad Supervisor for the BPD and the inspiration for the loathsome Wire character. So basically he was a terrible cop, playing a decent cop, with an EXCELLENT Baltimore accent.\n\n83. Michael Fletcher\n\nFirst seen: Season 5 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 9\n\nPortrayed by: Brandon Young\n\nThe newsroom storyline in Season 5 is an absolute mess, and it never really felt truly connected to the rest of The Wire universe. Fletch is basically a morally, ethically sound reporter who stands in contrast to Scott Templeton, which automatically makes him likable, but it’s still a little unclear what the point of his character is. It really feels like they could have combined him and Alma into one character, but instead they went with two half-characters and the result feels disjointed. Still, the story that Fletch writes about Bubbles is a shining example of how real journalism can make a difference in our communities, and that’s enough to get him on this list.\n\n82. Elena McNulty\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 4\n\n# Episodes: 12\n\nPortrayed by: Callie Thorne\n\nOkay so… I have a big crush on Elena McNulty and I can’t decide who’s a bigger idiot: Jimmy McNulty for blowing it with her, or David Simon for doing absolutely nothing with her character.\n\n81. Grace Sampson\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 3\n\n# Episodes: 12\n\nPortrayed by: Dravon James\n\nWe first meet Grace when Cutty visits her school unprompted after spending 20 years in prison. It’s a tough but powerful scene, as Cutty tells her “looking at you hurts” and she just crushes him. We meet her again in Season 4 at Edward Tilghman Middle School, where she’s something of a mentor to Mr. Prezbo. Again, unfortunately, I have to say this character could have been so much more. Clearly based on the fact that actress Dravon James also played her character’s sister, she has the acting chops to carry a bigger role.\n\n80. Stan Valchek\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 3\n\n# Episodes: 17\n\nPortrayed by: Al Brown\n\nOne of the most memorable assholes in a series full of them, Stan Valchek is cringe personified. His story peaks in Season 2 when his obsession with a stained glass window causes untold death and destruction, but his presence in future seasons is no less obnoxious despite being diminished. It’s obviously a successful performance by Al Brown, as you’re not supposed to find much likeable about this cantankerous old leather boot with a hat on. If there’s one nice thing you can say about him, it’s that it was fun to watch him get punched in the face.\n\n79. Gerard & Sapper\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 3\n\n# Episodes: 7\n\nPortrayed by: Mayo Best & Brandon Tate\n\nWe meet this pair of absolute fuck ups in Season 3 as Stringer is trying to hold the organization together with duct tape. They are hilarious in their stupidity, more than once costing the Barksdales significantly due to their incompetence. Dumb enough to fire at Omar on a Sunday morning and famous for bringing Stringer Bell too many 40 degree days, these world class doofuses make the Top 100 just for being so memorably moronic.\n\n78. Anton Artis aka Stinkum\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 7\n\nPortrayed by: Brandon Price\n\nStink isn’t a very outspoken member of the Barksdale crew, but he’s as steady as they come. The party they throw in honor of his promotion ends up becoming a major part of their unraveling, though of course Stinkum himself doesn’t live to see that happen. You get to know him just well enough for his death to be meaningful, and it’s one of Omar’s major early wins against the Barksdales.\n\n77. Justin\n\nFirst season: Season 3 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 10\n\nPortrayed by: Justin Burley\n\nJustin is an awesome underrated character, as he’s often overshadowed by the 4 main boys of Season 4. But he’s a big part of Cutty’s storyline in Season 3, going from dealing in Fruit’s crew to boxing in Cutty’s gym. He’s gawky with a big mouth but it’s heartwarming to watch how he responds when Cutty refuses to give up on him. I always wish they had turned him into a bigger character, but I also can’t complain with the direction they went in Season 4.\n\n76. Dr. David Parenti\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 3\n\n# Episodes: 11\n\nPortrayed by: Dan DeLuca\n\nHonestly it’s just fun to watch this guy constantly appear out of his element the entire season, since he’s basically just there to get schooled by Bunny. As a character he is basically Simon and Burns’ indictment of academia, showing him totally out of his depth and ultimately just as self-interested as anyone on the show.\n\n75. Thomas Klebanow\n\nFirst seen: Season 5 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 9\n\nPortrayed by: David Costabile\n\nA frankly terrible boss — not evil, but so incompetent that he might as well be. Granted, he’s a middle manager in a dying industry, it’s not his fault the powers above him are constantly cutting his budget and laying off his writers. But it’s not that he should be ashamed of — it’s the way he backs Scott Templeton long after Gus has made it clear his story isn’t credible. Not the mention the fact that he actually gets rewarded for it, like any mediocre white man falling upward.\n\n74. Donette\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 2\n\n# Episodes: 12\n\nPortrayed by: Shamyl Brown\n\nCredit where credit’s due, Donette is about taking care of herself and her son. She stood by D’Angelo even through all his imposter syndrome anxiety, but when he swallowed serious time to protect the Barksdales, she set her sights on upgrading to the big man on campus, Stringer Bell. And it works, too, except she finds out he’s a dickhead and unwittingly helps jumpstart his own unraveling.\n\n73. Cheryl\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 15\n\nPortrayed by: Melanie Nicholls-King\n\nCheryl is basically a badass. Even after Kima does her dirty and leaves her (and their child) for the job, she trades up to a lawyer who doesn’t get shot at for a living. Way too functional of a human being to get more than 15 episodes on The Wire. Fun fact is that Melanie Nicholls-King auditioned for the role of Kima, which is certainly interesting to imagine.\n\n72. Marcia Donnelly\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 12\n\nPortrayed by: Tootsie Duvall\n\nMarcia Donnelly is the quintessential middle school vice principal, which is to say….. she fuckin’ suuuuuuucks dude. I understand that being an authority figure at a public school has a way of hardening a person, and she does show some redeeming qualities like sending clean clothes home to Dukie. But it’s legit evil the way she leans on Randy to snitch, knowing damn well the kind of world Randy lives in and how they feel about snitches. This would later go on to RUIN HIS FUCKING LIFE. So that’s cool, job well done, Marcia. Then she promotes Dukie to high school where his life proceeds to completely fall apart. Every time we see this woman she’s going HARD for the system, enforcing some kind of demented status quo that ends up literally destroying a child’s life. Crushin’ it!\n\n71. Donut\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 9\n\nPortrayed by: Nathan Corbett\n\nYou gotta love Donut, the lil’ joyriding maniac that he is. Watching him roll through the hood in a Cadillac Escalade always makes me smile. Unfortunately the finger breaking scene with Officer Walker always does the opposite, but that’s obviously not Donut’s fault. This little rapscallion has a soft spot in my heart for the memorable final scene of the season when he rolls past Namond in what is presumably yet another boosted SUV. Ride on, Donut.\n\n70. Albert Stokes\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 3\n\n# Episodes: 9\n\nPortrayed by: Jason Wharton\n\nThe 4 main boys of Season 4 get a ton of love and deservedly so, but the supporting cast of child actors in the season is what really brings Edward Tilghman Middle to life. Albert is a minor but super impactful character. If you’ve ever worked with kids with trauma, you will recognize Albert immediately. The scene where he tells Bunny his mom died is an absolute emotional wrecking ball and the kid just knocks it out of the park. Absolutely heart wrenching and beautiful.\n\n69. Zenobia Dawson\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 5\n\n# Episodes: 9\n\nPortrayed by: Taylor King\n\nZenobia is another stellar character who finds herself with Namond, Albert, and a half dozen other knuckleheads in class with Miss Duquette, Dr. Parenti, and Bunny. She’s incredible in the classic Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse scene, projecting both confidence and insecurity simultaneously while in completely unfamiliar surroundings. Very strong supporting character who I wish we got to know more about!\n\n68. The Deacon\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 2\n\n# Episodes: 11\n\nPortrayed by: Melvin Williams\n\nOne of my most favorite fun facts about the cast of The Wire is that The Deacon is played by Melvin Williams, the real life inspiration for Avon Barksdale. A West Baltimore drug trafficker in the 80s, Williams was arrested in 1985 by Ed Burns, and the story was covered for the Baltimore Sun by David Simon. Williams got 34 years but got out on parole in 12. I absolutely love that Simon and Burns cast him as the saintly Deacon, who does nothing but dispense wisdom and do good works for his community.\n\n67. Squeak and Bernard\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 7\n\n# Episodes: 4\n\nPortrayed by: Mia Arnice Chambers & Melvin Jackson, Jr.\n\nHonestly I wanted to rank these two even higher because I love them so much but we’re getting to the point where 4-episode characters are a dying breed. Squeak and Bernard are buoyed not just by their entertainment value but also by their importance to the overall plot. Everything about their 4 episodes matters significantly because it leads to a huge break for Major Crimes. It’s simply icing on top that watching Squeak accidentally bring down a drug empire is hilarious too.\n\n66. Tony Gray\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 12\n\nPortrayed by: Christopher Mann\n\nPoor Tony. As The Wire opens the doors to City Hall in Season 3, we meet a whole host of new political players including city councilman Tony Gray, colleague and confidante to fellow councilman Tommy Carcetti. We soon learn he has higher aspirations as he begins a run for mayor. Little does he know, however, that he’s playing right into Carcetti’s hand — a black candidate for mayor who will split the black vote with the incumbent Royce, allowing a white man to be elected mayor in a nearly all-black city. Tony gets shoved to the periphery of the narrative pretty quickly and disappears entirely after the election is over, but not before a few memorable scenes. Most notably, his final words for his former friend — “Fuck you, Tommy.”\n\n65. Monk Metcalf\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 17\n\nPortrayed by: Kwame Patterson\n\nDespite being a major part of Marlo’s crew in S4 and beyond, Monk really only has two especially memorable moments. First, when he shoots Cutty on the corner for not backing off Michael, and second when he eyeballs Bodie getting into a car with McNulty at the station. Monk is a loyal soldier to Marlo and he’s as cold as anyone in that crew, but we never learn more about him. In a world of 3D characters, he’s a little too paper thin to rank much higher than this.\n\n64. Old Face Andre\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 2\n\n# Episodes: 6\n\nPortrayed by: Alfonso Christian Lover\n\nAside from having arguably the best nickname on the show, Old Face Andre is a great side character who ends up having a pretty big impact on the narrative before shuffling off into an abandoned rowhouse with Lex and co. He has a bunch of great scenes with Marlo, Prop Joe, and Bunk. He cleans up real nice, actually! But ultimately he’s just another casualty to the Marlo Murder Machine, getting setup in a no-win situation with the fake murder/robbery (that poor delivery woman! God DAMN Chris is a cold ass motherfucker). This poor guy just gets his ass beat around for 6 episodes before meeting the nail gun. RIP Old Face.\n\n63. Jay Landsman\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 45\n\nPortrayed by: Delaney Williams\n\nThus far, I’ve mostly been eliminating bit players and plot devices, but let it be known — appearing in 45 episodes will not save you, if the primary purpose of your character is being gross and licking boots. You know what, Jay? No one wants to hear you talk about your dick some more. Okay? It’s way, way too much.\n\n62. Fruit\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 8\n\nPortrayed by: Brandon Fobbs\n\nMaybe it’s just his goofy ass kangol hat, but I think Fruit is one of the best (or at least one of the most memorable) side characters in the entire series. He’s a big part of Cutty’s journey in Season 3, first ripping him off on his “welcome home” package before pulling a gun on him. He then finds himself at Cutty’s mercy, on his ass staring down the barrel, dead to rights. He escapes when Cutty hesitates, and we remember this moment later when Fruit sees Cutty again, this time on the corner trying to get back some of his boxers. The look between them is incredible.\n\nOf course, Fruit is really only part of the story for 1 season, because he promptly gets shot dead in the Season 4 premiere over some baby mama drama. Even his death is memorable though, and sets off a major chain of events that drives much of the story in Season 4.\n\n61. Little Kevin\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 6\n\nPortrayed by: Tyrell Baker\n\nSpeaking of amazing minor characters, I just can’t get enough of Little Kevin. Every time I rewatch I love him more. Little Kevin is a smooth criminal — well, smoother than Herc, not smoother than Marlo. Somewhere in between, I suppose. Either way, he makes the most of his time before he, too, becomes another unfortunate resident of the rowhouses. His interrogation scene is epic but my favorite scene is when he evades the cops by asking “man do I look little?” Top tier, Kevin, top tier.\n\n60. Michael Steintorf\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 12\n\n# Episodes: 11\n\nPortrayed by: Neal Huff\n\nOtherwise known as “that weasely dude from Carcetti’s staff”. Not necessarily an incorrect description, but I gained some appreciation for this character on this rewatch as he plays a huge role in advising Carcetti through the quagmire of political drama in Season 5. He doesn’t even appear in the story until the very end of Season 4, but once he does he makes his presence known. He’s got a cunning and unforgiving political mind, often giving Carcetti the hard truths. Perhaps the hardest truth he delivers cuts deep, and shines a light on our society far past the confines of The Wire: “Kids don’t vote.” A true contender for line of the series, because in its simplicity it reveals so many stark truths about how and why our political system operates the way it does, and why our school system is so beyond repair.\n\n59. Odell Watkins\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 15\n\nPortrayed by: Frederick Strother\n\nStaying right here in City Hall, Delegate Watkins is a major player even if he doesn’t necessarily get major screen time. In many ways he is a kingmaker, as we see Royce and Carcetti battle fiercely for his endorsement. The scene where he officially breaks from Royce, storms out of his office and leaves Royce screaming obscenities while Coleman Parker chases after him is just a chef’s kiss moment when you know Royce is done for good.\n\n58. Nerese Campbell\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 11\n\nPortrayed by: Marlyne Afflack\n\nMan is it fun to watch Nerese crawl up Carcetti’s ass and live there as soon as he walks in the door. She’s pissed because it was her turn to run for mayor after Royce, but Tommy and Tony moved first. You can totally understand why she’s pissed, but even if you think she’s being petty, who cares? Tommy Carcetti sucks (more on that later) and anyone who’s going to serve him one of those famous bowls of shit is a winner in my book.\n\n57. Kenard\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 19\n\nPortrayed by: Thuliso Dingwall\n\nIf you’ve read this far without actually watching The Wire, I appreciate the dedication but I will strongly implore you to click away, or at least skip this entry, until you’ve seen all 5 seasons.\n\nBecause of course, it’s this little twerp who finally takes the fearsome Omar off the board. Not Avon, not Stringer, not Brother, not Chris, Snoop, or Marlo. Sure as hell not the BPD. No….. fuckin’ Kenard. The little pissant who got one over on Namond before getting his ass whipped by Michael. About 10 feet of attitude in a 4 foot body, this kid has one of the biggest mouths on the show. Who knew he’d be one of the few to actually put his money where his mouth is, taking a shot that many bigger badder gangsters had taken and missed. There’s not a whole lot more to his character, but it gives him a place in Wire lore that no one can ever take from him.\n\n56. Clarence Royce\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 16\n\nPortrayed by: Glynn Turman\n\nIt’s a shame that Tommy Carcetti sucks so bad, because then watching Mayor Royce’s slow motion crash and burn would be a lot more satisfying. We meet him as a confident but embattled mayor gearing up for re-election, but he spends the entire 3rd season trying to stay afloat while Carcetti and Gray scheme to take him down. He is an aggressively typical politician, egotistical, short tempered, and more interested in keeping and consolidating power than actually using it to do any good. It’s definitely satisfying to watch his decline and fall, even though his replacement isn’t exactly a saint.\n\nAlso, I’m told the dick was a prosthetic.\n\n55. Judge Phelan\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 15\n\nPortrayed by: Peter Gerety\n\nA pretty pivotal, if minor, character in the early going of Season 1, as the judge for D’Angelo’s case who McNulty spills his guts to. He lights the fire under Bill Rawls’ ass that kicks the Major Crimes Unit into motion, so in a way we have Phelan to thank for this whole series. Plus we get to see him serve Burrell a big plate of fuck you when he tries to take the wire down early, which is immensely satisfying. Of course, “I would love to throw a fuck into her” is….. a thing to say, I suppose. Probably not a thing that I would say, personally, but to each their own.\n\n54. Scott Templeton\n\nFirst seen: Season 5 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 10\n\nPortrayed by: Tom McCarthy\n\nMan…. FUCK this dude. There’s something infinitely more infuriating about watching someone lie and cheat when they have the absolute audacity to believe their own bullshit. Templeton is a a Grade A Certified Hack at age 20-whatever, probably always was and definitely always will be. And worst of all? The smarmy little shit gets away with it. We never see Templeton suffer TRUE consequences for his egregious legal and ethical violations, and that still stings all these years later. We DO, however, get to see him trapped in the same lie as McNulty, in possibly the most delicious moment of the season. As far as consequences go, that’ll have to do.\n\n53. Walon\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 7\n\n# Episodes: 8\n\nPortrayed by: Steve Earle\n\nWalon is character who seems to drop bombs every time he speaks. Despite being a side character through and through, he makes a lasting impact both on Bubbles and on the audience. Played by Steve Earle who is in recovery himself, I find his performance incredibly affecting even though his character is never really developed beyond “wise old recovering addict”. You almost wish he was a bigger character, but his sparse usage also gives you the vibe that Bubbles is only one of many people he is trying to help lift out of addiction. Thank god for people like Walon, truly a beautiful soul.\n\n52. De’Londa Brice\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 2\n\n# Episodes: 9\n\nPortrayed by: Sandi McCree\n\nDe’Londa is an absolutely terrible mother but an incredible character. She steals every scene and is just so deliciously awful to watch. It’s obviously a huge scene when Bunny brings Namond home and tells him to leave her son the fuck alone, and it gives him huge insight into why Namond is the way he is. Bodie tells him too — she’s what people call a Dragon Lady (lmao fuckin’ Bodie).\n\n51. Leander Sydnor\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 2\n\n# Episodes: 37\n\nPortrayed by: Corey Parker Robinson\n\nWhy wasn’t Sydnor a bigger character? I mean, why go through all the trouble of getting a smolderin’ ass man like Corey Parker Robinson to be on 37 episodes of your show and then basically force him to sit on rooftops and listen to wiretaps in a basement for 5 seasons? Sydnor was always shown to be a highly competent and moral officer of the law….. so, naturally, he would be no good as a lead character on The Wire. But he’s always a welcome presence and a solid 6th man for the MCU.\n\n50. Alma Gutierrez\n\nFirst seen: Season 5 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 10\n\nPortrayed by: Michelle Paress\n\nMy main beef with Alma as a character is more or less the same as my beef with the newsroom storyline as a whole — it doesn’t really feel connected to the fabric of Baltimore in the same way that the ports did in Season 2, that City Hall did in Season 3, or that the schools did in Season 4. Each of those seasons showed us a new angle that helped us understand the larger picture of how this ecosystem functions (or doesn’t function). Season 5 really felt more like David Simon getting some shit off his chest about his time in print media. It didn’t help us understand better how people end up caught in the riptide of the drug game, or zoom out to show us how the people we thought were big players were really just pawns in a much bigger game. It felt like trying to smoosh two shows together, and it just didn’t work.\n\nDon’t get me wrong — the worst season of The Wire is still better than most everything else on TV, and Season 5 contains some of the series’ all-time best moments. But in terms of impact, it just didn’t deliver on the same level as the other 4 seasons.\n\nIn any case, Alma is perhaps the most likable characters from this corner of Baltimore, where a declining industry is seen trying to prop itself up with shoestring and duct tape. She stands out for obvious reasons in a sea of old white guys, but fights to prove her mettle as a journalist as the old guard starts to get bought out. She is shown to be smart and ambitious, but also modest and self-reflective. Of course it’s not hard to look like a beacon of morality next to the human stain Scott Templeton, but she does a lot of strong reporting in her own right. True to form on a show where no good deed goes unpunished, Alma gets shipped off to county desk (or whatever) for doing the right thing and taking Scott’s empty notebook to the higher ups. Just in case you were worried that some systems in Baltimore/America are not wildly corrupt and broken beyond repair, Alma Gutierrez’s storyline brings you back down to Earth.\n\n49. Brianna Barksdale\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 12\n\n# Episodes: 10\n\nPortrayed by: Michael Hyatt\n\nBrianna is pretty lucky that we meet De’Londa in Season 4, otherwise she’d be a shoe-in for the Worst Mom award. Brianna is no side player in this game — she is a major part of the Barksdales leadership structure and helped build them into what they are. Though she typically plays her role from behind the scenes, she steps into the spotlight when D’Angelo got sentenced to 20 years — to make sure her son takes the years like a man and doesn’t sell out the family. It’s hard to know what’s more tragic, that she didn’t realize she was killing her son, or that she didn’t realize she effectively killed him years ago.\n\n48. Ervin Burrell\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 40\n\nPortrayed by: Frankie Faison\n\nErvin Burrell is the epitome of bureaucracy; he is red tape personified. He doesn’t care about anything but maintaining power, and he’s more than willing to play the game however he needs to do just that. Though he looks hopelessly out of his element at times, old Burrell still has some moves, and he manages to slip and slide his way through 5 seasons as possibly the most incompetent boss in the series. Of course, that is the point of his character — law enforcement is not a meritocracy, and it’s the most corrupt and self-interested who rise to the top. If you want to know why things will never change in America’s biggest police departments, Ervin Burrell is as good a case study as any.\n\n47. Thomas Hauk aka Herc\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 54\n\nPortrayed by: Domenick Lombardozzi\n\nHerc is not just bad at his job, he actively ruins lives with his incompetence. Sure, he has some entertaining moments and he is undeniably a massively integral part of the show’s driving narrative (only 3 characters appear in more episodes). That’s enough to bring him this far, but it’s hard to look past his aggressively ineffective job performance and complete lack of growth. He’s shoot first ask questions never, and it’s a testament to the BPD’s Boys Club that it takes Herc 4 entire seasons to fuck up badly enough to get fired.\n\nUnlike Herc’s partner Carver, there is zero awareness, reflection, or growth in his storyline whatsoever. Herc might not be a bad person, but he’s a terrible cop. And he’s also probably a bad person.\n\n46. Shardene Innes\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 11\n\nPortrayed by: Wendy Grantham\n\nAnother classic example of someone who’s far too good of a person to get much airtime on The Wire. Shardene turns on the Barksdales when she finds out another dancer died at Stinkum’s party and got tossed out rolled up in a rug. The scene where she flips out on D’Angelo is fantastic and from there she takes a ton of risks and ultimately plays a big part in the BPD bringing Avon down (part 1). Then she manages to do what very, very few other characters do in this show: she gets out of the game with her life. She’s an amazing part of Season 1 and then we basically never see her again, but presumably she lives happily ever after with Lester Freamon and his miniature dollhouse furniture fortune.\n\n45. Sherrod\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 2\n\n# Episodes: 7\n\nPortrayed by: Rashad Orange\n\nTragedy walking. From the time we meet Sherrod as Bubbles’ new protégé, we know he really has no chance. Much like Johnny before him, it’s not hard to predict where his journey will end. But unlike Johnny, we see Sherrod’s innocence and helplessness, and the honest effort Bubbles makes to get him out of the streets and back on the right track. His death is one of the most heartbreaking in the entire series, because it felt both easily preventable and completely inevitable at the same time.\n\n44. Sergei Malatov\n\nFirst seen: Season 2 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 11\n\nPortrayed by: Chris Ashworth\n\nA sentimental favorite of mine, despite being (mostly) confined to a single season. He’s such a stone cold motherfucker and even though he’s literally a serial killer I still get kinda bummed when he gets pinched at the end of the season. On the Way Down in the Hole podcast, they call him the White Wee Bey, which feels appropriate to me. There’s an odd charm to him despite, again, obviously being a monster who deserves to spend his life in prison.\n\n43. Maurice Levy\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 21\n\nPortrayed by: Michael Kostroff\n\nMaury Levy is a legendary piece of shit even by Wire standards, basically representing the legal arm of the various criminal enterprises we see in the series. He represents the Barksdales until their collapse and then transitions seamlessly into business with the Stanfield organization, somehow emerging spotless despite actively advising them on how to keep their criminal organizations afloat. Arguably one of the best scenes in the entire series is when Omar calls him out in open court during the Bird trial, seeing right through him. Levy is a brilliant lawyer but he’s also an incredible scumbag who uses the drug trade to his own gain.\n\n42. Brother Mouzone\n\nFirst seen: Season 2 Episode 9\n\n# Episodes: 7\n\nPortrayed by: Michael Potts\n\nBrother is kind of a polarizing character and truthfully I feel torn on him myself. On the one hand, he’s a fuckin’ badass who shot Cheese in the middle of the projects and ultimately helped take Stringer Bell off the board. On the other hand, he’s kind of an outlier in a show that trades in realism, as a bowtie-wearing Harpers-magazine-reading bespectacled ass goofball who’s supposed to be one of the most feared hitmen on the East Coast. I’m not saying they don’t get 70–80% of the way to pulling it off…. but I’m not sure it’s quite 100%. Nonetheless, he delivers massive blow after massive blow in his short 7-episode stint between seasons 2 and 3, and he does it in his own unique way. Plus he shoots Cheese which is good because Cheese is the worst!\n\n41. The Greek\n\nFirst seen: Season 2 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 10\n\nPortrayed by: Bill Raymond\n\nAs an even keeled, mild mannered old man, it makes perfect sense that The Greek would be the most successful crime boss in the entire series. Everything falls apart in Season 2 and what does The Greek do? Disappears into the wind and picks up elsewhere. This guy has really taken his adorable chess-at-the-park-on-Sunday old man vibe to the outer limits of what is possible, operating from such a height that the BPD will never even sniff him. Of course, it helps to have friends in the FBI, but the kindly-grandpa-just-drinkin-his-coffee schtick is pretty damn effective in its own right. He is the definition of muted, truly the ultimate gangster who realizes that anonymity is the only way to actually survive the drug game. That’s why he pulls the strings, and everyone else catches the bullets.\n\n40. Melvin Wagstaff aka Cheese\n\nFirst seen: Season 2 Episode 5\n\n# Episodes: 13\n\nPortrayed by: Method Man\n\nQuite honestly, this piece of shit was significantly buoyed in this ranking by the magnificently scummy performance by Method Man and an admittedly vital role in the evolution of the West Baltimore drug trade. Despite that, Cheese is absolutely one of the most awful, evil motherfuckers on the show and one of the single best moments of Season 5 is when Slim Charles finally does what we’ve been waiting to see from Season 2 Episode 5 on. I don’t care if it was fan service, it was needed. After the dogfighting scene — still the hardest scene for me to watch in the series, honestly — it was the only acceptable way for his character arc to end.\n\n39. Norman Wilson\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 23\n\nPortrayed by: Reg E. Cathey\n\nI absolutely LOVE Norman, maybe because he’s the only one that really calls Carcetti on his bullshit. Every time Norman opens his mouth he’s dropping knowledge. Norman truly is a political mastermind who helps steer Carcetti to victory despite — perhaps — not actually voting for the Great White Hope himself. You gotta love his brazen honesty and brutal one liners, and singlehandedly makes Tommy Carcetti somewhat watchable which is a titanic task in itself.\n\n38. Malik Carr aka Poot\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 26\n\nPortrayed by: Tray Chaney\n\nPoot is one of the rarest characters on The Wire — someone with a legitimately happy ending. The last time we see Poot, he’s 22 and working at a Foot Locker — a far cry from the 16 year old wannabe gangster we met bouncing up and down on that couch in the pit back in Season 1. Poot goes through A LOT in this show while never really taking the spotlight. He is of course part of one of the most tragic scenes in Wire history in Season 1, a climactic shootout in Season 2, and somehow walks away from a Snoop drive-by in Season 3. All that leads up to jailtime when the Barksdale Org crumbles, but guess who’s out 15 months later and back in the game? My man Poot. When all the big players are off the board, somehow this low down pussy hound is still alive and kicking. But even with his short time away, Poot barely recognizes the game he walks back into, and watching it swallow his best friend whole is apparently all the motivation he needs to drop that shit once and for all.\n\n37. Spiros Vondopolous aka Vondas\n\nFirst seen: Season 2 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 15\n\nPortrayed by: Paul Ben-Victor\n\nThis quote is interesting in contrast to another very famous Wire quote from the end of Season 5, and reveals quite a lot about the ethos of both characters. Spiros, like his boss The Greek, has no need for status or renown. He doesn’t want his name to ring out. He wants to be in the shadows, moving undetected and undeterred. And for the most part, that’s exactly what he does. Even though the BPD gets eyes on him in Season 2, he eludes their grasp and keeps The Greek’s business with Prop Joe flowing smoothly from elsewhere. When he returns to deal with Marlo in Season 5, he’s the same calm, cool, collected smooth operator we knew from Season 2. Nothing ruffles his feathers and you get the feeling he will be in this business for a long time to come.\n\n36. Bill Rawls\n\nFirst Seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 47\n\nPortrayed by: John Doman\n\nAnother fantastic contender for Worst Boss on The Wire, Rawls consistently undermines his own subordinates with the zeal of a career bootlicker. He seems to truly relish tearing his Majors apart at ComStat along with his buddy Burrell. While the man sure can turn a phrase and steal a scene, he is no doubt The Wire’s standard bearer for the entrenched, unchanging status quo. They do try to humanize him when he tells McNulty that Kima’s shooting wasn’t his fault, and then later on we find out that he’s a repressed gay man. So… there’s that, too, I guess. But everything else in between is complete power-tripping antagonistic bullshit, making him one of the best heels in the series.\n\n35. Nick Sobotka\n\nFirst seen: Season 2 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 13\n\nPortrayed by: Pablo Schreiber\n\nPablo Schreiber turns in a fantastic performance as the oft forgotten Sobotka, cousin Nicky. He starts out the season a loyal but underworked and dissatisfied dock worker, looking down his nose at the dealers on the corners. It doesn’t take too long for him to transform completely into what he always judged so harshly, a drug dealer rolling in a big flashy truck stashing vials and rolls of cash in his ceiling. Nicky so quickly abandons his supposed convictions as soon as he gets a whiff of the cash, and loses himself in the game before losing everyone in his life. It’s not a difficult case to make that Nicky got Frank killed by convincing him to go meet with The Greek under a bridge, truly the crown jewel in a season full of absolutely abysmal decisions.\n\n34. Butchie\n\nFirst seen: Season 2 Episode 3\n\n# Episodes: 10\n\nPortrayed by: S. Robert Morgan\n\nOh, Butchie. Poor, sweet Butchie. One of the absolute most gut wrenching deaths in the series. Despite only appearing in 10 episodes, Butchie leaves a massive imprint in the world of The Wire and his death is truly one of the most affecting in all 5 seasons. We know that Chris and Snoop are lethal, but this is just abject cruelty and it’s frankly hard to watch. No one deserves to go out like that, least of all this kindly old blind man who only ever tried to help people. And all just to draw Omar back to Baltimore…. cold as ice. Butchie will always be one of my favorite side characters, all of his scenes with Omar are just tour de forces and incredible to watch. RIP to a real one.\n\n33. Rhonda Pearlman\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 44\n\nPortrayed by: Deirdre Lovejoy\n\nI present to you Exhibit A in the case of The Wire vs. Women: a somehow-underdeveloped 44-episode character whose growth is basically limited to Being Ambitious and upgrading from McNulty to Daniels. Ronny is undoubtedly a valuable member of the team— all the work coming out of Major Crimes means nothing if they don’t have a strong ally in the DA’s office, and that’s just what she is. She also delivers a delicious smackdown to Maury Levy that felt long overdue. Deirdre Lovejoy does the most with what she’s given here, but the character is never given the complexity she deserves despite how ubiquitous she is in the major investigations of the series.\n\n32. Clay Davis\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 7\n\n# Episodes: 17\n\nPortrayed by: Isaiah Whitlock\n\nSheeeeeeeit… we are getting down to the cream of the crop here! Clay Davis is one of the most iconic characters in The Wire, and I will admit I was shocked to see his episode count is only 17 for someone who cast such a large shadow across the series. Epically quotable, slimy as hell, and slippery af. Clay Davis is the Teflon Senator. He’s as dirty as they come, but when he’s backed into a corner is when he does his best work. Clay’s OTT corruption and complete lack of consequences was far less charming and fun to watch than it was in 2012. Next to Cheese, Clay is the character I most wanted to see go down, but you know old Clay ain’t goin anywhere.\n\n31. Ronald Brice aka Wee Bey\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 20\n\nPortrayed by: Hassan Johnson\n\nHands down the most likable serial killer in the series. This guy drops bodies with the best of them, serving as primary muscle for the Barksdale Organization, but somehow I still have a soft spot for him. Maybe it’s the fish. Maybe it’s the way he realizes Bunny is right and frees Namond from the prison of life with De’Londa. It really makes me wish we got just a little more content from Bey after he swallows the life sentence, because once Avon is released we only really see him again through Namond’s story. My appreciation for Bey goes up every time I rewatch The Wire — maybe next time he’ll crack the Top 30!\n\n30. Beatrice Russell aka Beadie\n\nFirst seen: Season 2 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 20\n\nPortrayed by: Amy Ryan\n\nSweet Beatrice Russell…. you deserved far far better than that bottom feeder McNulty. I love everything about this character besides how little they used her after Season 2, and how they turned her into Jimmy’s doormat. She’s a breakout character in the ports and then she just gets relegated to the bench for the next 3 seasons, which is no less than we’ve come to expect from Simon and Burns. But she absolutely shines in her debut season and then, if nothing else, continues to be the best person on the show (and therefore, peripheral to the fuck ups running the game).\n\n29. Ziggy Sobotka\n\nFirst seen: Season 2 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 12\n\nPortrayed by: James Ransone\n\nI’ll be honest, I’ve hated on Ziggy before and for obvious reasons: he’s a petulant little shit whose life is a series of unbelievably awful decisions and childlike temper tantrums. But on this latest rewatch, I connected with Ziggy’s story in a way I hadn’t before. He is such an incredibly tragic character, forced into a world that he never belonged in and furious at his impotency to change his circumstances. What we see from Ziggy over the course of his 12 episodes is all that fury and insecurity bubbling out and overtaking him. It’s a slow motion meltdown 20-something years in the making. James Ransone turns in the standout performance of the season, playing Ziggy’s pathos with such subtly and power. The scene with Frank in the prison after he shoots Double G is arguably the scene of the season and one of the best in the entire series.\n\n28. Tommy Carcetti\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 35\n\nPortrayed by: Aiden Gillen\n\nDiscussion question — more likable Aiden Gillen character: Tommy Carcetti or Littlefinger? Okay, so Carcetti isn’t quite on the same level of moral repugnance, but he’s perhaps just as unpleasant to watch. I struggled to get through the Carcetti story in this rewatch (thankfully Norman is there for most of it).\n\nIt doesn’t help that one of the first things we see him do is cheat on his wife and weirdly stare into his own eyes in a mirror as he fucks some random woman in a bathroom….. what a charmer. Then we get to watch him take down Royce which should be super gratifying because Royce fuckin’ sucks, but watching Carcetti win isn’t honestly much better. I think we are ostensibly supposed to be rooting for this guy?? They show us his flaws of course, he’s not some squeaky clean hero (this is The Wire after all), but I still think that we’re supposed to buy him as someone who truly wants to make a difference.\n\nOf course, all that goes out the window the second he gets into office and finds out the school system is $54 million in the hole. Given the opportunity to bail out the schools with state money at the cost of some political traction, he declines so as not to hurt his chances at the Governor’s chair in 2 years. TWO FUCKING YEARS. This sniveling motherfucker runs a Hope & Change campaign for the ages while THE ENTIRE TIME not even really planning to serve a full term, but instead to leap frog to Annapolis in 24 goddamn months. Everything this guy does is about himself and increasing his own power. I believe Tony Gray speaks for us all when he says, “Fuck you, Tommy.”\n\n27. Gus Haynes\n\nFirst seen: Season 5 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 10\n\nPortrayed by: Clark Johnson\n\nGus is the undeniable highlight of the Baltimore Sun arc and Season 5 as a whole. Is he very transparently David Simon’s voice speaking directly to the audience about What Journalism Is Really About? Yes, very much so. But Clark Johnson nails this performance in such a profound way that it doesn’t even bother me. He is SUCH a newspaperman. Seen it all, never phased, cuts around the bullshit, follows his gut, tells it like it is. He’s a goldmine of quotes and memorable moments. Watching Gus sniff out Scott’s bullshit immediately is immensely satisfying, and when it all comes to a head he comes out looking like the adult while Scott storms off in a fit of gaslighting angst. Of course, the fact that Scott and Klebanow get their Pulitzer in the end is….. incredibly rage inducing, so I guess we’ll just have to hope that the 2nd half of Gus’ best quote comes true.\n\n26. Slim Charles\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 27\n\nPortrayed by: Anwan Glover\n\nSlim Charles is as steady as it gets for Baltimore muscle, and you get the feeling with how the series ends that he is only just beginning his rise. Slim talks little but says a lot. He doesn’t just drop knowledge, he does it in as few words as possible. Loyal to the Barksdales until the end, Slim ends up in Joe’s camp as a charter member of the New Day Co-op. In the end, he gets the shot off that we had been waiting to see all series long, putting one in Cheese’s head for the big man. (I know I already linked this clip on Cheese’s entry, but it’s so damn satisfying, let’s watch it again).\n\n25. Bunk Moreland\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 54\n\nPortrayed by: Wendell Pierce\n\nBunk is one of the most popular characters in The Wire, and for good reason. He is a veritable quote machine, a party animal, and a damn good detective to boot. I actually surprised myself with this ranking, because entertainment factor alone would have Bunk inside the Top 10 easily. But in considering the criteria I used to rank these characters — looking at Bunk as a whole character — this is where he tops out for me.\n\nAlthough we see Bunk in nearly every episode, he isn’t given the kind of growth arc that would elevate him into the Top 10 of this list. He is more or less the same person at the end of Season 5 that we meet at the start of Season 1. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, considering he is mostly a force for justice throughout, but it does mean that he exists primarily on the periphery of other characters’ narratives. He is there is chastise Jimmy for being a drunken asshole, or cajole Jimmy back into being a drunken asshole again, or once again chastise him for going off the deep end and inventing a fake serial killer. He is there to speak sense to Omar about the true cost of his crusade, and to tell the bosses to shove it, and to coerce confessions from perps using questionably ethical methods. We love Bunk, we cheer for Bunk, but at the end of the day, we know that this is not a story about Bunk.\n\n24. Snoop Pearson\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 5\n\n# Episodes: 27\n\nPortrayed by: Felicia Pearson\n\nSnoop is one of the most lethal characters in the series, so it’s almost a little surprising when her death hits you as hard as it does. Even though I was rooting for the Stanfields to go down, the scene with Michael in the SUV is so unexpectedly poignant and subdued that it becomes very emotional. Not necessarily what you might expect given the action Snoop was involved in throughout the series, with multiple shootouts and drive-bys. But asking “how my hair look, Mike?” in her last moments genuinely brings a tear to my eye.\n\nSnoop is played by the actual Snoop — the actress was a real life Baltimore gangster who killed people and did jail time. I know there were victims’ loved ones who were not pleased with her casting, and understandably so given how celebrated the performance has become. But truly, no one captures the Baltimore vibe like Snoop and it’s not hard to see the reason why. She adds an indelible sense of realness to the Stanfield Organization, really helping to solidify that silent menace vibe in the streets. A classic character and one of the best acting performances in the show.\n\n23. Wallace\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 13\n\nPortrayed by: Michael B. Jordan\n\nWhere’s Wallace?! The eternal question that Wire fans will yell at each other from across a crowded room. The original Tragic Death that all future Tragic Deaths would be compared to, Wallace represents the death of innocence. For the audience, it drives home the reason that the game is so fierce: the weak links are sniffed out and snuffed out very young. These are boys — 16 years old, sophomores in high school — best friends killing each other on the word of some authority figure, trying to make their way down to the end of the chess board. It is gut wrenching and sickening to watch. Before there was Ned Stark, there was Wallace — the early warning to the audience that we shouldn’t expect this show to pull its punches.\n\nBut it’s not just Wallace’s death that’s so impactful, it’s what we see from the last weeks and months of his life. Wallace is so profoundly disturbed by seeing Brandon’s mutilated carcass — and the responsibility he feels for his death — that the game immediately loses all interest to him. He slips into depression and addiction, before deciding the best place to clear his conscience is a West Baltimore police station. Although they try to protect him by shipping him out to the countryside, he decides he misses the city and finds his way back. Bad idea, Wallace.\n\nPlayed so brilliantly by Michael B. Jordan, whose career has really fizzled and died since The Wire, the character of Wallace is only with us for a short time, but makes an incredibly lasting impression. Where the FUCK is Wallace, String?!\n\n22. Namond Brice\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 14\n\nPortrayed by: Julito McCullum\n\nNamond and his friends are a major part of what makes Season 4 so compelling. Through their eyes, we see first hand how early the game can snatch up lives — not young men, not even teenagers. Boys. Caught in a riptide that will carry them far from any safe harbor, into a ruthless world that will leave most of them dead before 30. Namond Brice is one of the lucky few who manages to find himself a happy ending. We’ve met both of his parents earlier in this ranking, now it’s time to meet the boy himself.\n\nAs the son of the legendary Wee Bey Brice, whose name still rings out on the corner despite his life sentence, Namond lives under the weight of high expectations — placed on him most directly by his mother, De’Londa. But we can see almost immediately that despite his best efforts, Namond does not belong on the corner. Prideful, distracted, unfocused, with big hair and a big mouth — he doesn’t exactly make an ideal corner boy, much less a soldier. Namond wants to live up to his father’s name, and this is the only world he knows. But when Bunny convinces Dr. Parenti to set up shop at Edward Tilghman Middle School, Namond is moved to a special classroom where his usual behaviors don’t get him suspended anymore. Cut off from the corner, Namond begins to think about his life in the larger context — beyond the game, beyond Baltimore.\n\nNamond’s trauma is profound, and likely would have killed him young if it weren’t for Bunny Colvin. When De’Londa tells him to “stay the fuck away from my son,” it finally clicks. The anger, the defiance, the attitude. It’s all an act to keep the world from seeing the fear, the guilt, the insecurity. Namond’s happy ending comes when Bunny manages to convince Wee Bey to give up his parental rights, and he gets to move into a stable, loving home where he’s allowed (and encouraged) to follow his passions and achieve his full potential, instead of slinging on the street corner.\n\nNamond’s journey is fraught, and Julito McCullum’s performance is exceptional. As a child torn between two worlds — or really, for the first time learning that there IS another world — McCullum walks the line between fury, sadness, and terror with the precision of a seasoned actor. He is one of the main reasons why Season 4 is so unbelievably compelling — not just because he makes it out, but because you know that for every Namond, there’s a dozen more Randys and Dukies.\n\n21. Chris Partlow\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 5\n\n# Episodes: 26\n\nPortrayed by: Gbenga Akinnagbe\n\nChris might be the scariest person in this series, a damn near emotionless cold blooded killer. Together with Snoop, we see how the Stanfield Organization is able to rule half of Baltimore through sheer terror when these two get put on the scent. Not just ruthless but innovative, they use the abandoned row houses to kill dozens of people without arousing any suspicion for months. Chris is Marlo’s #2, his top lieutenant, ride or die to the end, and the #1 reason Marlo is feared in the streets.\n\nGbenga Akinnagbe’s performance is absolutely incredible in this role, as the layers of Chris unfold. His story builds to the moment when he viciously beats Devar to death in the streets, we finally get a glimpse into the past of this character. Ostensibly, Chris is doing a favor to Michael with the goal of recruiting the boy into their organization. But for someone who is always as calculated as Chris to lose his mind like that during a kill, we know it’s about more than recruiting Michael. Chris was likely abused himself, and it adds more complexity to his character, which Akinnagbe squeezes every drop of with his soulful (or soulless?) eyes. It doesn’t get much worse than Butchie’s murder, but thankfully there is some justice in the end when Chris gets locked up for life. It’s where he belongs, but I’m always left wondering what consequences there were for Chris’s abusers.\n\n20. Roland Pryzbylewski\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 2\n\n# Episodes: 45\n\nPortrayed by: Jim True-Frost\n\nOh, Prez. I love this strange awkward man who never had any business carrying a badge and gun. It’s absolutely tragic that the consequences of his incompetence were the death and maiming of young black men, and that can’t be forgotten or written off in considering this character. But crucially, we see growth in Prez’s 2nd Act, and he even approaches something close to redemption.\n\nPryzbylewski has a panicky trigger finger, combined with an inborn racism, and that makes him an absolutely godawful field officer. What’s so especially tragic about the shooting that eventually leads to his resignation is that it should never have happened — for once, an individual and their superiors had come to a unanimous and correct decision, that Prez should work behind the scenes not in the field. It’s only when he and McNulty happen to be getting takeout and hear a radio call that they respond to the scene. Just like in Season 1 in the high rises when Prez pistol whips the kid and blinds him in one eye, he shows his abysmal instincts for field police work by shooting a black man who turned out to be an undercover BPD officer.\n\nThat’s it for Prez at the BPD, but it’s not the end of his storyline. He becomes a major part of Season 4 when he starts a teaching job at Edward Tilghman Middle School. This is a job that plays to his strengths — a deep thinker, patient, process-oriented, and just plain smart. Just like Lester taught him. But there’s a lot at his new job he isn’t prepared for. I always love when he tells Marcia Donnelly that he was a former police officer, and she decides he might be able to handle this job after all — because it’s the exact set of skills he lacks that she’s counting on him to have.\n\nNevertheless, perhaps against all odds, Mr. Prezbo finds his rhythm and learns to teach kids what’s relevant to them. The way he bonds with Randy and cares for Dukie, we see that he’s starting to “get it” but is still naïve to the harsh realities of what’s to come. When Dukie is socially promoted out of his classroom to high school, he starts to understand. By the time Dukie comes back around to visit him in Season 5, he seems to be a bit wiser — he knows this is the last time he’ll see Dukie again.\n\nPrez wouldn’t rank this high if his story had ended with his law enforcement career. But seeing him take on a middle school classroom and turn into the kind of caring role model those kids needed gives this character a huge boost. It’s not because he is a miracle worker who immediately transforms the lives of his students and erases the generational trauma they are mired in — this isn’t a Hollywood story. It’s because he shows up for them, good bad and ugly, and sees them as people to care for, not problems to solve.\n\n19. Jimmy McNulty\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 56\n\nPortrayed by: Dominic West\n\nOh, Jimmy. Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy. The closest thing The Wire has to a main character, also easily the hardest character to rank on this list. Where to rank an objectively detestable but undeniably magnetic and talented piece of shit womanizer? McNulty is far too important to the narrative of The Wire to rank him outside the Top 20, but he makes me so damn angry that putting him much higher didn’t feel right either. This is where I settled and I don’t know if it’s too high, too low, or just right. But this is how I feel about Jimmy McNulty.\n\nWe hate Jimmy McNulty because there is a little bit of him inside all of us. There is a small part of us that wants to be the smartest person in the room, to make everyone understand just how fucking RIGHT we are about everything. Everyone has had a dumbass boss who doesn’t know the dirt trying to tell YOU how to do things, when you know goddamn well the right thing to do. We’ve all daydreamed about saying “fuck you” to our boss in some grandstanding act of rebellion and shoving two middle fingers at the system while you piss on their traditions.\n\nMcNulty is every worst instinct we’ve suppressed our entire working lives come to life. And just like we know deep down, the result is a real mixed bag. Sometimes we cheer for McNulty, like when he tells his bosses to shove it up their ass unless they want to do real police work. But sometimes it’s absolutely gruesome, like when he throws away everything good he created for himself in Season 4 so go on some network crime drama B-plot bender in Season 5. There is every reason to hate McNulty given the series ends on such a brutal season for him, but deep down we all know that the series isn’t the same without this drunken Irish lout.\n\nOne of the best and most unique parts about McNulty is how he fades in and out of the narrative. After dominating Season 1, he gets shipped off to the boat for Season 2 and plays a more supporting role. In Season 3 he again takes center stage in the hunt for Stringer Bell, but the devastation of Omar beating him to the punch drove Jimmy back to his roots as a beat cop. Season 4 sees him fade even more into the background, having built a nice quiet life with Beadie and the boys. We’re happy for Jimmy, maybe even a little proud of him. If the series ends after Season 4, maybe he’s a Top 10 or even Top 5 character, despite all his lumps along the way.\n\nBut then Season 5 happens, and McNulty morphs in Super McNulty. I don’t think it’s unfair to say that Season 5 McNulty is a small taste of what this character would have been if the show aired on CBS. Not out-of-character, necessarily, but exaggerated moving toward absurd. I rolled my eyes out loud during the fake serial killer phone call to the newspaper. It’s mildly infuriating to watch his scheme succeed, and mildly satisfying to watch it crumble, but the overriding emotion is “I don’t feel like this would actually happen” which is not the tone we’ve come to expect from The Wire.\n\nUltimately, McNulty is an undeniably iconic part of The Wire, an indelible part of its DNA, but the guy can be a real fuckin’ drag to watch. Then again, who doesn’t love a good slow motion trainwreck?\n\n18. Kima Greggs\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 56\n\nPortrayed by: Sonja Sohn\n\nAnd there it is, the final female character remaining in the list…. cut at #18. I think a case could be made for Top 15, I’m not so sure about Top 10. Kima is an undeniably beloved character but she is obviously not without her flaws. Chief among them, Kima is just as shitty a partner as any of her male colleagues, leaving Cheryl after they have a kid together with a classic “I miss us” excuse. Though she eventually seems to reflect enough to realize she owes Cheryl something, it’s too little too late for a reconciliation and she has to settle for supporting from the sidelines.\n\nHonestly, that seems to be enough for her as more than anything, she realizes that she is and always will be married to the job. Even after being nearly fatally shot in Season 1, Kima knows she belongs in the streets. Shit, even when they’re introducing her to us as the moral compass for Herc and Carver, we see her sprinting over to beat Bodie’s ass for pushing some useless old BPD officer to the ground during a raid. She’s a cop through and through, and this hasn’t changed by Season 5 when she feels even more strongly than Bunk that Jimmy is in the wrong. It’s Kima who brings it all crashing down by going to Daniels. So in a sense she is the moral, heroic figure to Jimmy’s twisted and sinister, but then you remember the police are a morally bankrupt institution completely subsumed by political interests and long since divorced of any mission to protect and serve.\n\nSo, she is a complex character who I love but I don’t always agree with. She is clearly one of the best actual cops on the show in terms of the work, showcased especially in Season 4 when she has “soft eyes” and solves the Fredo Braddock murder that none of the seasoned vets could. But she suffers from many of the same character flaws that plague Bunk, McNulty, and the rest. Maybe the fact that she isn’t a perfectly angelic character makes her more compelling in the end.\n\n17. Ellis Carver\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 50\n\nPortrayed by: Seth Gilliam\n\nCarver starts the series on roughly equal footing with Herc, who you will recall was cut from this ranking 20+ spots ago. So what separates these once inseparable lawsuits waiting to happen? Growth. Ellis Carver might have one of the most profound growth arcs of any character in The Wire, as we are literally watching him learn to give a shit right before our eyes. It’s not a smooth transition or an easy one, but Gilliam is impeccable at showing us how Carver’s conscience begins to take a more active role in his policing. Of course, he doesn’t get there on his own — he has two incredible superiors who teach him what it really means to be police. How to work a beat and know your community, so that you can actually do the work of keeping people safe rather than busting skulls. It’s a lesson that his buddy Herc never learns, and though there’s no animosity between them, they naturally drift and go their separate ways halfway through the series.\n\nAs late as Season 3, we see Carver having his Training Day moment screaming “YOU DO NOT GET TO WIN, SHITBIRD” standing on the roof of his cruiser in the middle of the ghetto. But it’s his placement in the Western that ultimately helps him see the light, as he is charged with carrying out Bunny Colvin’s Hamsterdam experiment. It’s then that we see an observant, almost nurturing side of Carver, when he looks out for the hoppers and lookouts being put out of work. He gets them a hoop and supervises their games, and works with Cutty to get kids down to the gym. And in the moment that truly represents the end of Herc & Carver, he moves a dead body out of Hamsterdam to keep the drug amnesty zone under wraps from the higher ups.\n\nBy Season 4, Carver has adopted many of the lessons Bunny taught him, telling his fellow officers (who can’t understand why he doesn’t want to just cuff and stuff all day long) “I’d like to think that until the cuffs actually fit, there’s still talking to be done.” He’s learning. Of course, he still has a lot to learn, and those lessons will unfortunately cause major damage to other characters. But Carver knows that, and it drives him to be better. When we leave Carver at the end of Season 5, there is a feeling that his career arc may closely mirror his biggest role models, Bunny and Daniels. It’s a fitting end for a character who went through his paces and learned the right lessons from them.\n\n16. Frank Sobotka\n\nFirst seen: Season 2 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 12\n\nPortrayed by: Chris Bauer\n\nFrank Sobotka is an incredible character and the beating heart of Season 2. Though Season 2 often gets a lot of hate from casual fans who don’t understand its brilliance, it gets better and better for me after every rewatch. It was a bold move to introduce a ton of new, white characters after the world they established in Season 1, and it required perfect performances from the actors tasked to fill those roles. That’s exactly what they got from Chris Bauer, who nails the embattled Frank Sobotka and in many ways carries the docks storyline on his shoulders.\n\nFrank is a man with a small amount of power working in a dying industry willing to do just about anything to keep it alive. He uses his position to run dirty cargo through the harbor for The Greek, with the intention of keeping his local union alive. Of course, play in dirt and you’ll get dirty, and Frank learns this the hard way. When 14 sex trafficking victims die in one of his cargo cans, the full heat of the BPD and FBI come down upon him. When his son Ziggy and nephew Nicky get in even deeper with The Greek than he realizes, the blowback is catastrophic. The BPD get Frank ready to spill everything, but the leak inside the FBI gives him up and Nicky gives him terrible advice, leading to his Tragic Death at the end of Season 2.\n\nFrank’s story is so perfectly paced and plotted, hitting all the right notes for a wildly compelling story of moral ambiguity. He is essentially the “would you steal bread to feed your starving family” philosophical quandary come to life. He represents a solid argument for why stealing the bread is a bad idea, as the consequences ripple out farther than you can ever predict. Though Frank only ever intends to support his family and his fellow stevedores, the mess he finds himself in is sadly too much for him to overcome and the walls close in.\n\nYou can feel how important Frank is to Season 2 by watching the season finale, where his absence is felt all over the place. He is such an important figure to so many people and stories, that his death reverberates throughout the episode.\n\n15. Cedric Daniels\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 58\n\nPortrayed by: Lance Reddick\n\nAnd the Episode Count Title goes to…. Major Cedric Daniels! Or is it Deputy Ops? Or Commissioner? Honestly he gets promoted so much it’s hard to keep track. We follow Daniels through all 5 seasons and his own personal Chutes & Ladders: BPD Edition. Though we learn that he has something of a shady past, he’s a straight shooter and a rising star by the time we meet him at the start of Season 1. Enter the Major Crimes Unit, where we get to see Daniels do what he was meant to do: lead. He’s undeniably one of the best leaders in the series, commanding respect from his detectives and standing up to the bosses when he needs to. Who could forget him telling Burrell “you’d rather live in shit than let the world see you work a shovel”?\n\nBut Daniels’ best quality is his mentorship of young officers like Greggs, Sydnor, and especially Carver. We see how the lessons imparted on them help turn them in real officers. He guides a steady ship even when he has to deal with McNulty’s outbursts, and the end result is better officers doing real police work.\n\nDespite his attempts to remain apolitical, Daniels catches the eye of Tommy Carcetti on his run for Mayor. That eventually brings Daniels into the top spot of the NYPD, but he resigns in the ultimate integrity move when Carcetti proves once again to be full of shit. Daniels ends up doing what he said he was gonna do all along, become a lawyer and argue in front of his girlfriend, Judge Ronny. Awww.\n\nDaniels might not be the flashiest character but his steady presence anchors the show and gives it at least one consistent source of competency. In a completely broken and fucked up world, you need at least one person you can count on the do the right thing. That’s our man Daniels.\n\n14. Randy Wagstaff\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 14\n\nPlayed by: Maestro Harrell\n\nNext to Wallace and Dukie, Randy (who, yes, is Cheese’s son) might have the most tragic story arc in The Wire. This bright, ambitious, and caring 8th grade boy gets his life straight up ruined because some fucking adults 1. leaned on him to snitch 2. didn’t protect him from the obvious consequences of that. You watch poor Randy go from selling candy bars in the cafeteria to being lookout for some bathroom shenanigans, which all spirals into shit. Desperate to stay with his foster mother and not be sent back to a group home, he basically spills every bean he can find. His reputation gets ugly quick and the police fuck up as usual, leading to his foster mother’s apartment getting firebombed. She ends up in ER, and Randy ends up in a group home anyway.\n\nThis story is so bleak and one of the major reasons why Season 4 is very hard to watch. You can see how each little thread gets pulled so that the sweater unravels entirely. You want to stop it, to tell Randy to tell Little Kevin to talk to Lex himself, to not be at his locker when the boys went into the bathroom with Tiffany, to just tell Donnelly that he didn’t see anything…. but each domino falls one after the other and this kid’s life falls apart completely. It’s so meticulously tragic, and yet another look into how this world chews people up and spits them out.\n\nPlayed brilliantly by Maestro Harrell, Randy is one of those characters whose story just stays with you. Like the “special dead” he was worried about haunting him, Randy will live with ghosts his whole life. When we see him again in Season 5, he’s not the same kid. He’s hard, because he has to be. He’s alive, but we don’t have much hope for the future. He’s on the pipeline. Randy is a testament to how systems fail people and leave them for dead.\n\n13. Dennis Wise aka Cutty\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 20\n\nPortrayed by: Chad Coleman\n\nTruly one of the most unique and beautiful stories told in all of The Wire, Cutty feels like that side mission that ends up impacting you more than the main story. His story always exists parallel to the main action, but it was a story we wanted and needed to hear.\n\nCutty is former muscle who’s been away for 14 years, getting out of jail when Season 3 begins. He tries his hand at leaving the game, but the world doesn’t accept him. He gets back into it, or at least tries to. When he can’t squeeze the trigger on Fruit and his goofy ass Kangol hat, he knows being a hitman isn’t for him anymore.\n\nOnce he leaves the game for good, his real story begins. Cutty opens a boxing gym and starts to train some of the restless youngins from Hamsterdam. He becomes a mentor figure and ultimately…. has sex with bunch of their moms, I guess? But he learns his lesson, and ultimately serves as one of the best forces for good in the series.\n\nChad Coleman gives one of my favorite performances in the entire cast, going from being completely Lost in the World to being muscle again to finally finding his footing as a mentor to kids. It’s another rare happy ending on The Wire, which is much needed considering how bleak the rest of Season 4 is.\n\n12. Joe Stewart aka Proposition Joe\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 9\n\n# Episodes: 24\n\nPortrayed by: Robert F. Chew\n\nProp Joe is a Baltimore legend, and it takes a cold ass motherfucker in Marlo (and a shitty, ungrateful nephew in Cheese) to finally take him down. But right up until then, it’s nothing but an absolute delight watching this smooth criminal go to work. We first meet him as a rival to Avon, specifically on the basketball court as the rival coach in the East vs. West basketball game. He’s an intriguing but still peripheral character, but we soon learn that he has a much bigger role to play in the landscape of the Baltimore drug trade.\n\nHis connection to The Greek is pivotal to the entire series, as it’s the conduit through which drugs enter Baltimore. And when Avon goes away, he and Stringer co-found the New Day Co-op. When his co-founder winds up dead, he becomes King Drug Dealer, teaming with all the major dealers to buy more for less and avoid all the turf war bullshit. It’s only when Marlo bucks that Joe finds himself needing to once again maneuver delicately, but that’s exactly what Joe does. He manages to tame Marlo and bring him into the fold, but tiger cubs don’t stay cute for long. Joe couldn’t keep him caged, and ends up being eaten by the animal he helped raise.\n\nOne of the most quotable characters in the series, his death shocked me because I always assumed he would find his way to the end unharmed. He had such an incredible penchant for playing both sides against the middle, and keeping himself, his family, and his interests protected. And he did it all with a quick wit, cool disposition, and even keel.\n\n11. Duquan Weems aka Dukie\n\nFirst seen: Season 4 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 20\n\nPortrayed by: Jermaine Crawford\n\nNo character in The Wire personifies Tragic with a capital T more than Dukie. From the first time we meet him as an undersized 8th grader getting picked on by his friends, we know the kid has no chance. But that doesn’t make it any easier to watch his story play out the way it does.\n\nDukie is shown to be an incredibly intelligent, intuitive child. We also find out early that his family isn’t really a family at all, more of a drug den where even donations from the school have to go directly into Dukie’s hands or they’ll get sold on the streets. In school, he soaks up the new computer in Mr. Prezbo’s class and is constantly seen teaching new things to his classmates and even Prez. We see that Dukie is not just gifted, but caring, when he spends an entire episode fixing a broken pocket fan and then uses it to comfort Laetitia after she attacks another student in the classroom.\n\nOf course, if you remember 8th grade, you’ll remember that smartness and kindness are signs of weakness to many 8th grade boys. And Dukie is most certainly perceived as weak, though he’s at least somewhat lucky to be in a group of friends with a “only we can pick on Dukie” mentality. Even within the group, Michael protects Dukie from Namond and keeps the balance.\n\nWhich is why it’s so incredibly devastating when Dukie’s world changes in 2 ways: 1. his “family” gets evicted and leaves town without him, and 2. he gets “socially promoted” to 9th grade, leaving Edward Tilghman Middle. As fucked up as Dukie’s life was, he had found a way to navigate it. But these events sent everything into a spiral, leaving Dukie entirely without a support system or safety net of any kind.\n\nIn Season 5, we get some renewed hope as Dukie appears to have made a new little family with Michael and Bug. But Michael’s journey gets darker and takes Dukie’s down with it, ending in a needlessly bleak separation — I’ll never quite understand why there was no way Michael could have helped Dukie in some way stay out of the absolute gutter. Like, is he not family too, at this point? After everything? Goddamn.\n\nJermaine Crawford is amazing in this role and his growth — physical and emotional — adds so much to the character. We literally watch him grow up before our eyes. We can remember the innocent boy from the beginning of Season 4, playing with bugs and tinkering with fans. It’s hard to watch but it’s a perfectly told story.\n\n10. Stringer Bell\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 36\n\nPortrayed by: Idris Elba\n\nEven at #10, people will call this a robbery. And who am I to argue? Stringer Bell is a huge fan favorite for good reason. He’s clearly the brains of the Barksdale Organization, with designs on taking it fully legitimate — “later for all the gangster bullshit.” He sees the game beyond the game. He has a magnificent rise and fall and a legendary death scene to match. Not mention Idris Elba’s masterful performance, which elevates Stringer Bell into one of the most iconic television characters ever.\n\nHere’s the thing about Stringer — he fucks up a lot, and really isn’t as smart as he thinks he is. Jemele Hill has it right on the Way Down in the Hole Podcast. The man really does orchestrate his own demise. So, excellent character? Yes. Infallible mastermind? No.\n\nStringer wants so desperately to leave the criminal business world and enter the “legitimate” business world, that he’s almost happy when Avon is locked up in Season 2. He moves the organization in the direction he wants it to go, but he makes a bunch of silly missteps in the process that get him in the long run. Most significantly, when Avon gets Brother Mouzone to enforce Barksdale territory that Stringer was giving away, Stringer galaxy brained up a plan to turn Omar and Brother against each other. Genius! Except when they figured it out, guess who two of the most dangerous characters on the East Coast wanted dead?\n\nBut that wasn’t the only decision Stringer made that got himself killed. The first was much more selfish, and much more tragic. When he had D’Angelo murdered, you knew he justified it as keeping the organization protected from D flipping. But you also know that part of it was personal, that Stringer never liked D, always thought he was weak, always thought Avon was stupid for protecting him and promoting him. He saw an opportunity to take him off the board, and he did. But he fucked up in doing that, and even more so in telling Avon just to prove that he’s hard too. That was the moment Avon cut him out, where you can see Stringer’s influence in the organization start to slip. And It’s ultimately Avon who gives Stringer up to Omar and Brother Mouzone.\n\nAnd for all Stringer’s community college business classes and overtures of legitimacy, the real world fucked him. Clay Davis, Andy Krawcyzk, all of the downtown suits he thought were his equals. They saw through him and picked his pockets, leaving him out in the cold. Avon might sound shortsighted when he rejects the co-op and insists on fighting for his turf, and in many ways he is. But he also has one thing straight, which is that the street will always be the street, and there’s no escaping. Stringer thinks he can make a break for the right side of the tracks, but he ends up as a man without a country. He miscalculated every step and it ends up costing him in the end.\n\nStringer is an amazing character, but he’s less a criminal mastermind who gets betrayed and more a wannabe businessman blinded by ambition gradually planting the seeds of his own demise. It’s a beautifully crafted downfall that begins before you even know it begins. Idris Elba gives one of the best performances in the series, with a huge range from measured to explosive. In the first 3 seasons, he looms larger than any other character in the streets, and for that, we salute you Mr. Bell.\n\n9. Marlo Stanfield\n\nFirst seen: Season 3 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 31\n\nPortrayed by: Jamie Hector\n\nMarlo is a terrorist. He is absolutely the scariest motherfucker in this series. He rules through fear and intimidation, and not the flashy kind — no bark, all bite. If you’re against Marlo, you might just disappear. You won’t see a flash of anger, or even necessarily the man himself. Just his ghosts, Chris and Snoop, a walk through the playground, and the barrel of a nail gun.\n\nI always felt like meeting Marlo made you look at Avon differently, the same way meeting Princess Azula makes you look at Prince Zuko differently. We get to see the human sides of Avon, but Marlo doesn’t have that. He’s cold blooded, almost robotic. He’s the quietest, scariest guy on the screen, from the first time we meet him: “Do it or don’t, but I got places to be”. It’s a huge credit to Simon and Burns, as well as Jamie Hector who is incredible, to realize that creating a villain scarier than the Barksdales meant making them quieter, more understated, emotionless. Marlo is the perfect villain to take over for Avon and carry the ball for the rest of the series.\n\nWith Chris and Snoop as his right and left hand, Marlo basically terrifies everyone, including Stringer who wants to get him into the co-op while Avon wants to get him into a body bag. Neither gets what they want — well, not specifically anyway. Marlo eventually joins the co-op once Stringer is out of the picture, and slowly takes that over too. The BPD eventually take him out of the game — but not off the streets (thank you Herc). With Snoop dead and Chris in for life, Marlo tries to do what Stringer never had the chance to — turn legitimate. But his haunting ending on the street corner tells us he is more Avon than String, and the streets may not be done with him yet.\n\n8. D’Angelo Barksdale\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 18\n\nPortrayed by: Larry Gilliard, Jr.\n\nRIP D’Angelo, one of the saddest deaths on The Wire. Come to think of it…. one of the saddest LIVES on The Wire. D is one of the first characters we meet who so clearly does not belong in this world. He’s forced into it because of his family, but he doesn’t belong there. Stringer knows it, Avon knows it, hell even D’Angelo knows it on some level. His inner demons wrestling with being part of the game is the most compelling character story in Season 1, from the restaurant scene with Donette to the scene with Shardene after Stinkum’s party. Unfortunately, it’s too little too late for D’Angelo, as he is asked to swallow a 20 year sentence to protect his family. Which he does, by the way, and is prepared to do the time — until Stringer decides better safe than sorry, let’s tie up this loose end.\n\nD’Angelo only gets a season and a half, but his death reverberates all the way through to the end of the 3rd season, as the Barksdales crumble under the weight of their own losses. Stringer lets slip to Avon that he was behind the hit, just to prove his street cred, and the fracture between them never heals. It’s one of the most impeccably crafted story arcs in the series, as D’Angelo starts the Barksdales troubles in Season 1 with the murder trial, and ultimately he deals the final blow to his family’s empire from beyond the grave.\n\nD’Angelo’s entire journey of figuring out too late that he’s trapped in a world he wants no part of, and being powerless to change that, is summed up perfectly in his Great Gatsby monologue. It’s an essential Wire scene, and perfectly delivered by Larry Gilliard, Jr. who is amazing in this role.\n\n“The past is always with us. Where we come from, what we go through, how we go through it; all this shit matters. … Gatsby, he was who he was, and he did what he did. And ’cause he wasn’t willing to get real with the story, that shit caught up to him.”\n\n7. Lester Freamon\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 2\n\n# Episodes: 54\n\nPortrayed by: Clarke Peters\n\nCool Lester Smooth, dollhouse master and the king of Major Crimes. He is the best detective in the show by far, despite spending 13 years (and 4 months) languishing in the Pawn Shop Unit. Experiencing something of a career revival over a decade after being shipped out of homicide for doing real police work, Lester proves to be the MVP of the MCU from the jump, manning the wire with Prez and building the case outward. Lester is just as fiercely devoted to the work as McNulty or any other dog eared detective, and he’s not afraid to color outside the lines.\n\nLester is what many would call “natural police” — he has a knack for catching criminals without leaving the comfort of his office. He knows how to build a case using wiretaps and paper trails, and by following the money. It’s by doing exactly that, in fact, that Lester earns the ire of his superiors, and the feeling is mutual when politics gets in the way of following the money all the way up the food chain. He has a rather McNultian habit of digging where he shouldn’t be digging, and he seems to get a particular satisfaction out of doing so. In that way, he’s incredibly fun to watch stir shit up with his unrelenting competence.\n\nIt’s always satisfying to see Lester drop some knowledge, or say “fuck the man”, or bust a case open….. but if we’re going to hold McNulty responsible for Season 5’s disastrous serial killer storyline, I think Lester deserves some of the blame too. He doesn’t just enable the ridiculous scheme, he actually escalates it, and yet somehow neither of them end up in jail. Despite the ending of his story being a bit of a stretch, it was nice to see him settled at home with Shardene, making dollhouse miniatures like a boss.\n\n6. Avon Barksdale\n\nFirst seen: Season 1 Episode 1\n\n# Episodes: 32\n\nPortrayed by: Wood Harris\n\nFrom the beginning of the series, Avon is the epitome of “boss”. He is the top dog of his family and his crime organization, untouchable by the law, making too much money to count. He is intelligent, never sloppy, but he has swag and personality, he jokes and laughs. He’s a magnetic person. We haven’t met Marlo yet…. but he’s everything Marlo isn’t. Wood Harris brings a vibrant charisma to Avon that immediately endears you to him, despite knowing that he’s a violent druglord who will drop bodies in a heartbeat to maintain his power.\n\nBut Avon goes through a lot in his time on the show. By the end of Season 1, Avon’s stranglehold on the West Baltimore drug game has loosened, and his anonymity from the police has evaporated. In Season 2 we get a new look at Avon, in prison but still figuring out how to run the show. We realize that this is just who Avon is and always has been: the guy who runs shit.\n\nBut even though Avon schemes his way out of jail in record time, he finds the landscape of the game permanently altered by his absence. Ditched by their suppliers after Avon’s conviction, Stringer has been cooperating with their rival Prop Joe to maintain their product. Meanwhile, young upstart Marlo Stanfield has moved in on Barksdale territory, and is standing tall. These problems come at Avon from both sides, squeezing him into a no-win situation where he can’t adapt to the new world or compete in the old one. As much as he accuses Stringer of being a man without a country, he has also clearly lost a step and isn’t as comfortable on his home turf as he once was. But he knows who he is, and he’s willing to go down with his ship before he changes.\n\nThe tragic end of the Barksdales comes when Stringer snitches on Avon to the police, and Avon gives Stringer up to Omar and Brother Mouzone. A dual betrayal 3 seasons in the making, the consequences of which leave Stringer dead and Avon locked up.\n\nAnd that would seem to be the end of Avon’s story, but we get one last glimpse of him in Season 5 — behind prison glass, taking $100k out of Marlo’s pocket for a meeting with The Greek. I love this scene, not just because we get to see Avon again, but because we see that he’s gotten his own version of the happy ending. Marlo won the turf war, but Avon is still the king of his domain — what you might call an authority figure. And he’s happy to help the heir to West Baltimore get one over on the East Side, but only if he gets his cut too.\n\nAvon is an iconic gangster in film and TV history, his decline and fall being perfectly paced and masterfully portrayed by Wood Harris. Even though he gives up the crown, he will always be the OG.\n\n5. Bunny Colvin\n\nFirst seen: Season 2 Episode 9\n\n# Episodes: 24\n\nPortrayed by: Robert Wisdom\n\nNo matter where you look up and down the chain of command, the quality of law enforcement officer employed by the Baltimore Police Department exists on a spectrum. On the far end you have out and out corruption, like Eddie Walker or Stan Valchek, who are explicitly cruel and self-serving. Then you’ve got a stable of “rip and run” officers who think stop and frisk is the pinnacle of police work (Herc, Colicchio, S1–3 Carver), and a whole mess of superiors who go out of their way to enforce this status quo (Landsman, Rawls, etc. etc.). Then you’ve got a smaller group who seem to understand “real” police work and they push back against the bosses who want to make it about the stats. McNulty, Freamon, and Daniels — we see them rage against the corruption and incompetence and think, “at least there are some good ones trying to do real good.”\n\nAnd then, we meet Bunny Colvin. At the tail end of his 30+ year career, Bunny is getting ready to break the mold on his way out the door. Even the best officers we’ve met up to this point have had a firm belief in the mission of the company. They believe that chain of command and statistics are counterproductive to that mission, and they will sometimes subvert their bosses to accomplish that mission “the right way”. But their goal remains the same: “We are the good guys, they are the bad guys, they commit crimes and we lock them up.”\n\nNot Bunny. We meet Bunny in Season 2 at the crime scene of the shootout that killed a young boy hiding under his bed. Even then, we can see the despair in Bunny’s eyes. The hopelessness of knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt: they are losing this war. They’ve been losing, and unless something changes, they’ll keep losing. The entire mission of the BPD is rotten to the core, and it’s hurting every single person involved.\n\nIn Season 3, we see Bunny put that thought into action in a major, unprecedented way. He tells his squad about the “brown paper bag” — the “great moment of civic compromise” that allowed citizens to have their drink on the corner, and allowed officers to look away and do real police work. He sets out to create a brown paper bag for drugs. Enter Hamsterdam, Bunny Colvin’s Great Experiment. Where dealers can deal, and users can use, as long as they stay in designated zones.\n\nWhat’s beautiful about Bunny is that he’s the only cop in 5 seasons who understands that the only way to actually improve the lives of people is to flip their longstanding model of community policing onto its head. It’s not “do it better” it’s “do it different”. It’s throwing out the playbook and writing a new one. It’s a revolutionary act from someone who by all rights should spend the last 6 months of his police career coasting to his pension. Of course, when the bosses get wind of his rogue policing, all hell breaks loose and Bunny loses more than he realized he was putting on the line.\n\nThe Hamsterdam storyline alone makes Bunny easily the best cop in the series. But it’s his 2nd act, in Season 4, that elevates him to Top 5 status. Stuck as the head of security for a hotel and out his pension, Bunny’s retirement is not going well. He takes an opportunity to work with Dr. Parenti, a researcher from the University of Maryland studying the worst offenders in the criminal justice system. Bunny successfully pushes Dr. Parenti to shift his focus to middle school students, to reach these kids before they’re too far gone. This is how Bunny comes to meet Namond, and becomes the man that saves his life.\n\nThis is a critical part of Bunny’s story because we see that the compassion he has for disadvantaged individuals — and the lengths he is willing to go to help them — is not part of his job, it’s part of who he is. Once again, Bunny finds himself swimming against the current, trying to do something different inside "
