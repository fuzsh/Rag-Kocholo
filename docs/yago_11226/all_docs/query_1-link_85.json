Carcetti impresses Watkins by his reserved behaviour at the funeral of the murdered witness. Bunk visits Jimmy McNulty and Beadie Russell for dinner and finds McNulty sober and enjoying domestic life. Marlo Stanfield visits Bodie's corner and muscles him into selling the Stanfield package. Marlo is impressed with Michael a second time when he sees him working for Bodie. Proposition Joe and his New Day Co-Op face problems on two fronts; New York drug dealers on the East side and the Stanfield Organization in the West; they agree to attempt to negotiate with Marlo. Omar Little robs a Stanfield stash house. Rawls sends a caustic new lieutenant to gut the major case unit from the inside. Freamon and Kima Greggs leave for the homicide unit. Howard \"Bunny\" Colvin embarks on a new career as a researcher into violent behaviour. Prez is shocked by a violent incident in his classroom.\n\nGet your 100 free minutes of transcription with Sonix using this link https://sonix.ai/invite/stripped\n\nKobi and Dave\n\nKobi's other podcast is Flixwatcher\n\nDave's other podcasts are The Cinemile and Shitegeist\n\nBurner\n\nIf you want to leave us a 30 seconds or fewer burner message, record using your favourite voice recorder app and email it to [email protected] or Whatsapp voice memo on our burner phone\n\nðŸ“ž+447534 831 658\n\nThank-yous\n\nTheme tune by Sam and Martin from Song by Song Podcast: www.songbysongpodcast.com\n\nSeason 4 Images from Michael Balistreri @BlackSnowComics on Instagram\n\nTom Whalley - Exec Producer and Editor\n\nObe Joshua - Producer\n\nBen Williams - Editing\n\nFollow Us Online\n\nWebsite: www.TheWireStripped.com\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nTwitter: @TheWireStripped\n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/TheWireStripped\n\nInstagram: @TheWireStripped\n\nLeave a Whatsapp voice memo on our burner phone ðŸ“ž +447534 831 658\n\nðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡\n\nOur Patreon in support of The Ella Thompson Fund\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TheWireStripped"
