        "text": "James E. McNulty was a man of integrity, compassion and joy. He was a true gentleman, from the way he cared for his family to the manner in which he treated strangers. Whether doing business or enjoying recreation, Jim was honest, kind and positive. He celebrated life with laughter and dance, love and faithfulness. Throughout his 87 years, Jim’s faith and beliefs were evident in how he lived his life.\n\nJim was born at the end of a decade of advancement and struggle. While the moving assembly line increased America’s ability to produce goods, workers united to gain fair labor practices. The United States was just emerging from the First World War and seeking to regain industrial strength. A nation and its people were hopeful. One family in Chicago, Illinois was especially eager as they awaited the birth of their second child. Edward and Veronica (Cassidy) McNulty welcomed their son James into their hearts and lives on November 19, 1919. He joined his older sister Eileen, and later the family grew to include two younger brothers, Donald and William. They were lovingly cared for by their mother who remained at home and their father who was employed as a stereotyper for the newspaper. Because Irish Catholicism was prominent in the life of the community, Jim grew up valuing faith, family and his cultural heritage.\n\nJim had a very well-rounded childhood. He was a real sports enthusiast, running track at Oak Park High School and excelling as an infielder in baseball (eventually, he played on a team in the Army and won a championship). Quite naturally, Jim was a fan of University of Notre Dame football and the Chicago Cubs. In his youth, Jim also served as an altar boy, learned to play the piano, and liked to dance. Jim was primed to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day, which was a big event in the community. Throughout his life, Jim relished his Irish heritage.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Jim had one year of college under his belt before he enlisted in the Army. He was based at Camp Stewart in Hinesville, Georgia. By this time, Jim had developed a relationship with a young woman whom he had met when he was 13 years old. Margaret “Peg” Robinson lived across the street from Jim’s aunt in Crystal Lake, Illinois. The two developed a summer romance when Jim visited his aunt, and over the years, their love and commitment grew. When the Army was preparing to send him overseas, Jim and Peg got married before he shipped out on April 10, 1943. Their love and faithfulness remained strong through the most difficult years of the war. He served his country with distinction and rose through the ranks from field commissioned officer to captain of an anti-aircraft battalion, stationed in New Guinea and Philippines. Jim was honorably discharged as a decorated combat veteran with the appreciation of a grateful nation.\n\nFollowing his discharge, Jim and Peg lived in the Chicago area, Elgin, Illinois, Crystal Lake, and Michigan City, Indiana. He worked as a manager for Leath Furniture Stores and traveled to many openings of the new stores, doing all he could to get them going. He was a natural encourager with his positive spirit and honest dealings.\n\nThroughout his career, Jim was on the go. In 1954, Leath transferred him to the N. Burdick Street store in Kalamazoo, until it closed. But he quickly found work (plenty of work), sometimes taking on two jobs. When he went to work for Investors Diversified Services (IDS), be started selling mutual funds and managed to become their top salesman. Later, Jim co-owned an office machine business in Rockford, Illinois and traveled back and forth from Kalamazoo. He also worked as a professional fund raiser and finished out his career in sales with Van’s Furniture. Wherever he went, Jim was an enthusiastic worker, a valued employee and a model leader.\n\nJim was also energetic in his leisure. He exercised regularly his whole life. Three days a week, he swam and worked out at the YMCA until he was 85 years old! No doubt his fitness helped Jim recover from brain surgery in 1960, when he had developed an unexplained growth from an injury he suffered during the war. For several months, he was in rehabilitation to relearn cognitive skills. He came back strong and healthy.\n\nJim lived his life fully, and he made it sweet for those around him. The family home at 754 Fairview, where Jim lived most of his life, was a focal point for family togetherness. The backyard was especially welcoming. As children, Jim’s kids had helped pour concrete for the patio and, ever after that, the memories just kept building. It was the gathering spot for Jim and Peg, their children and, later, grandchildren and great grandchildren. Jim turned the backyard into an Irish Garden, designated by a hand-painted sign, with an Irish flag and hand-made leprechauns hidden amongst flowers and shrubs. He delighted to create places for the grandkids to play in his lush garden sanctuary.\n\nAs lovely as his home surroundings were, Jim also liked to travel. Being a Civil War buff, he visited many of the historic battle sites. He and Peg also took a trip to England and the land of his ancestry, his beloved Ireland. Jim was a true patriot and devout Catholic. He was a proud founding member St. Monica Catholic Church, which he helped build with his own hands.\n\nJim was a devoted husband to his wife of 64 years. They were absolutely committed to their vows to be faithful in sickness and in health. When it became necessary for them to move from their home on Fairview Street, they went together to a seniors’ complex and, ultimately, to Bickford Cottage assisted living, where Jim died on the first day of October.\n\nJim was a wonderful man~devoted to his family, committed to his community, and faithful to his God.\n\nJames E. McNulty, age 87, of Kalamazoo, died October 1, 2007 at Bickford Residence. Jim was preceded in death by his brother, William; grandson, Joseph; and great-grandson, Addison. Members of his family include his wife, Margaret; five children: James (Mary Jo) McNulty, William (Karen) McNulty, Robert (Laurie) McNulty, Patrick (Lisa) McNulty, and Margaret (Mike) Wilson; seventeen grandchildren; twenty-three great-grandchildren; a sister, Sister Edwardine (Eileen) McNulty; and one brother, Donald (Mary) McNulty; nieces and nephews.
