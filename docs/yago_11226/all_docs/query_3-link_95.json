        "text": "There is something strange happening.\n\nI don’t mean to show off or anything, but I’ve seen every episode of the Wire as well as the majority of episodes of Law & Order. [12 out of 13 seasons (272 eps) of SVU, all 141 Vinny D’Onofrio eps of CI, first 8 seasons (176 eps) of L&O orginal flavor. That is a total of 589 episodes plus 60 eps of the Wire.] Whilst watching the American gem, L&O, I constantly spotted actors that were on the Wire. CONSTANTLY. Nearly every episode has a Sobotka or a Barksdale or a Baltimore detective. It’s uncanny.\n\nThe Wire is one of the best television programs to ever exist on the television since the machine was invented. And I’m not even exaggerating! But let’s be serious. The Wire is truly an intricately crafted, stunning and AMAZING show in every way. It makes me cry, laugh and thank my lucky stars I have never been to Baltimore. I won’t waste my time explaining what you already know. But if you don’t know about the Wire then you are a fool and should go Google, “watch wire online free.”\n\nA full investigation is under way. Be sure, I am compiling enough evidence you will be thinking, “in no way have you wasted any of your time.” I am on the edge of exposing a true Hollywood conspiracy. In the mean time, here are the TOP 10 most common actors from the Wire that have appeared on any/all versions of the Law & Order franchise. (Please note: This includes L&O: Trial by Jury and L&O: LA even though no one watched those.)\n\nDuring my preliminary research, I have found at least one appearance on a L&O episode by even the most obscure characters from the Wire. The following list only includes actors that were in more Wire episodes than L&O. Therefore, for the purpose of this investigation, they are considered official Wire actors instead of just busy character actors.\n\nExceptions:\n\nRight off the bat I’ll admit that two of the Wire’s central characters have never been on any episodes of Law & Order. By the end of this list, you’ll think they’re the weirdos. Even Idris Elba (Stringer Bell) has appeared on one Law & Order episode in 2001.\n\nDominic West and Sojna Sohn: Never on L&O, 60 eps of the Wire\n\n10. Amy Ryan: 5 eps of L&O, 20 eps of the Wire\n\nI love her, so, whatever. She can be in every episode of everything I ever watch and I’ll never get tired of her face. On the Wire, Ryan played Officer Beadie Russell and she was just as much precious as she was tough. Her character was introduced in the second season as a tie between the up-to-no-good dock workers and the we-grew-to-love-them-even-for-all-their-flaws Baltimore detectives that think recording everything everyone ever says will solve the world’s problems. Beadie was featured in all 12 episodes of that season (2003) as well as an additional 8 as McNulty’s love interest. Ryan appeared in 5 L&O episodes spanning the years, playing different characters each time. All appearances, both Wire and L&O, were before Holly Flax ever got to Scranton.\n\n9. I’m declaring a tie between the following. They were both on 5 episodes of L&O and so close to the same number of the Wire episodes.\n\nMichael K. Williams: 5 eps of L&O, 51 eps of the Wire\n\nHis performance as Omar Little has scarred me for life… and it’s not just because of the gigantic scar on his face (wakkawakka). Williams reaches new levels of he’s-out-of-his-mind-ness that makes it hard to see him in any other role. Beginning in 1997, Williams appeared in 5 episodes of Law & Order, 2 of which were SVU. It is to be noted, and not yet thoroughly analyzed, 3 out of his 5 L&O episodes were filmed during or after the Wire aired.\n\nJim True-Frost: 5 eps of L&O, 50 eps of the Wire\n\nThe first time I saw the Law & Order: Criminal Intent episode “Yesterday” (originally aired in 2002, but I watched it a couple months ago on Netflix), I saw this man’s face and a little bug of curiosity started to dig a hole in my brain. I knew I knew him. I KNEW it, but I didn’t know from where. I finally IMdB-ed it and, lo and behold, it was Prez from the Wire. It was this moment in my life that I knew, I KNEW, this whole Wire/L&O connection is worth investigating.\n\n8. Marlyne Barrett: 6 eps of L&O, 11 eps of the Wire\n\nBarrett played Council President Nerese Campbell on the Wire. Her character was not involved with the streets of Baltimore, but she quickly proved to be an obstacle for Aiden Gillen’s character, mayor candidate Tommy Carcetti. Spoiler alert: Carcetti was elected mayor. Barrett appeared in 11 episodes of the Wire between 2006 and 2008. Around the same time she was in 6 various Law & Order episodes. Most notably, as determined by myself, Barrett was in the L&O: Trial by Jury episode, “Pattern of Conduct” in which Clarke Peters (the Wire’s Detective Lester Freamon) also appeared. Two for the price of one. AND this is the only L&O episode Peters was ever in. Weird? Meh.\n\n7. Wendell Pierce: 6 eps of L&O, 60 eps of the Wire\n\nI love Wendell Pierce for so many reasons. 1. Wendell Pierce sounds like a fake name. 2. Bunk is one of the top Wire characters I would most like to hang out with. 3. I love him. 4. Did I mention that I love him? I love when I’m watching a Law & Order ep and I see his name pop up on the screen in the opening credits. I know that I am in for a treat. Pierce always brings a level of sass, guts, spunk, moxie, chutzpah, etc. to every L&O ep he is in. Also, he was in an episode of Tim & Eric which has me convinced we’d make great friends.\n\n6. Deidre Lovejoy: 7 eps of L&O, 60 eps of the Wire\n\nFor some reason, I thought she was British. I mean, her name’s Deirdre Lovejoy. She should be a lady of the house who loves watercolors. Is that sexist? But really, once I found out Dominic West AND Idris Elba are from across the pond, I don’t trust anyone any more. Lovejoy starred in 60 episodes of the Wire as Assistant State’s Attorney Rhonda Pearlman, and 7 episodes of L&O. Her involvement with L&O is relatively run-of-the-mill. They are dispersed throughout the years, varied characters, and so on. The only notable thing is that her appearance on the Law & Order episode, “Virtue” in 1994 is one of the first acting gigs she landed. … And spotting her as a student’s mother in Bad Teacher was one of the most entertaining things that happened in that movie.\n\n5. Peter Gerety: 8 eps of L&O, 15 eps of the Wire\n\nThere is a serious disease in Hollywood casting departments called type-casting. I don’t know how Gerety fell into it, but he fell hard. Gerety is in 15 episodes of the Wire as Judge Daniel Phelan. Three of his 8 Law & Order episodes were as Judge Harrison on SVU. I guess being type-casted as a judge is better than a drug dealer or rapist. In addition! Gerety played Charles Powell in 2 episodes of L&O and Dean Connors in an episode of L&O and Trial by Jury. Both of those characters are defense attorneys. All of his L&O appearances were before he was on the Wire, except for SVU which were in 2008, the final season of the Wire. Are you still following me? My theory is this: All of these characters are the same person. First, he was a defense attorney in NYC. He became a judge and moved to Baltimore. He became so corrupt he had to move back to NYC. … It could happen.\n\n4. Lance Reddick: 9 eps of L&O, 60 eps of the Wire\n\nI am trying my hardest to not go on a Fringe rant right now. I just want Peter and Olivia to be in love and in the same universe or timeline or galaxy or whatever. That’s neither here nor there. What is important right now, is that Broyles… I mean Lieutenant Daniels has been on 9 episodes of Law & Order. Six of those were on SVU as the pre-Tamara Tunie medical examiner, Dr. Taylor. I also want to point out that according to IMdb, this beautiful baby-alien-faced man was also on an episode of the Nanny.\n\n3. Seth Gilliam: 10 eps of L&O, 60 eps of the Wire\n\nSergeant Carver is my biggest Wire crush. Not quite Logan Echolls or Pacey Witter levels, but comparable to Detective Stabler. Not that the two characters are similar. Not at all, in fact. My heart broke when Carver walked down that hall, away from that kid he couldn’t help… I’m not explaining it well enough so you’ll just have to trust me on this. It’s heart-breaking. Gilliam portrays one of the Wire’s central characters. He was in all 60 episodes. He makes third place on this list because he was in a total of 10 L&O episodes. In 2005, Gilliam appeared in 4 episodes (out of only 13) of L&O: Trial by Jury as ADA Terence Wright. I assume if Trial by Jury took off, he’d be a regular cast member. Furthermore, the Wire was on hiatus in 2005. Gilliam must’ve needed his crime drama fix. I can’t end this run-on paragraph without mentioning: Gilliam was on 3 episodes of the Cosby Show (which I have also seen in bulk) as Pam’s boyfriend AND he graduated from SUNY Purchase… holla!\n\n2. Isiah Whitlock Jr.: 12 eps of L&O, 25 eps of the Wire\n\nWhitlock played State Senator Clay Davis on the Wire, appearing in 25 episodes throughout the series. Almost half of that amount, a whopping 12, is the number of various L&O episodes he has appeared on. Beginning with the Law & Order’s “Slave” in 1996 and ending with Criminal Intent’s series finale in 2011. He is all over this. A different character each time. Even multiple episodes in the same year! This guy is out of control! You should hear me exclaim, “HE’S FROM THE WIRE!” when I see him on a L&O episode. It is only comparable to the way Senator Davis pronounces, “shiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.”\n\n1. John Doman, 12 eps of L&O, 60 eps of the Wire\n\nYeah, this guy. Doman played William Rawls (Major/Colonel/Deputy Commissioner/etc.) on the Wire. He appeared on 12 episodes of L&O; 5 SVUs, 5 L&O orginals and 1 of each Criminal Intent and Trial by Jury. His roles ranged from bailiff to “Munch’s Informant” to murderers and between the years 1991 to an episode of the current 2012 season of SVU. The assortment of L&O appearances is impressive considering he has also appeared in ALL 60 episodes of the Wire. Where does he find the time? Doman was also on 10 episodes of ER, but that’s another story. He is a fine character actor with an impressive IMdb page. He’s a legend.\n\nThank you, good night."
