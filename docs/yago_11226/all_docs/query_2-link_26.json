        "text": "Nancy McNulty leaves her family with a rich legacy of being a strong role model and an exceptionally committed person to the community she loved. Known for her sincere generosity and always putting others first, Nancy would do anything to help others in need. She treasured the time she spent with her family and was immensely proud of them. There is no doubt that she will be deeply missed by her many special friends and loved ones.\n\nIn the year 1943, the Pentagon was completed while at the same time America was rationing canned meats, butter, and cheese, during challenging times. In the midst of WWII, Richard Charles and Eva Elizabeth (Delnay) Brown welcomed home their newborn daughter, Nancy Suzanne, on September 18th, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Born the second of four girls, her birth brought much hope and happiness to the family home.\n\nGrowing up on the northwest side of town near Richmond Park, Nancy lived a happy childhood. As a family, they moved often including the areas of Marne and Blue Lake before eventually landing in Wyoming. Nancy enjoyed school and attended both Stocking and Alexander Elementary. When it came to high school, she started at Ottawa Hills High and later graduated from Roger High School. Nancy was eager to enroll at Grand Rapids Junior College before finishing her teaching degree at Western Michigan University. Anything she set her mind to accomplishing, Nancy always succeeded. She was driven and hard-working in her approach to her schooling and later her professional life.\n\nNancy was a highly effective teacher. Throughout her career, she taught seventh grade at both Kentwood and Crestwood Middle Schools. Her students always knew that she cared for them and her colleagues enjoyed her sense of humor. Often, she and a group of her teaching friends were go out to socialize. One night when she was hostessing at the Common Wheel, a local hotel in town, a local fireman, James McNulty, caught her eye. He was there with a group but found a moment to ask her out. They both enjoyed the theater, so their first date was a night out to see a movie. Neither of them felt sparks that night, but she agreed to go out again. Soon, a common interest connected them and they fell in love. They married on March 26, 1977. The happy couple waited until school was out for the summer before they honeymooned in Las Vegas.\n\nNancy and Jim settled down in Walker and started their family. Their son, Dan, was adopted from Romania. They met every challenge to bring him home to the states. Stopping in Germany to get a different type of Visa, Dan had to stay with the head of the adoption agency in Romania. The head of the agency then had to take him through a different country before they were reunited back in Chicago. Trying as it was, they never regretted their decision to adopt him. Nancy relished in her role as a mother and enjoyed seeing to it that Dan had everything he needed to be successful in life. Any challenge throughout his growing years was always met with her even temper and ability to see the good in everything. It was evident, that she always wanted the best for her family.\n\nIn addition to her role as a wife, mother, and teacher, Nancy held a large variety of special hobbies. She liked to sew, crochet, and knit. For decades, she was proud to make all of her own dresses and tops. If Jim or Dan needed any mending, they knew they could count on her skills! She was also an avid reader. Although she read many genres, her favorite was fiction. When it came to television, Nancy loved movies and looked forward to the special season of watching movies on the Hallmark Channel. If she wasn’t into one of the dramas, she would easily land on the History Channel. A music lover, she listened mostly to classical hymns, yet also loved Josh Groban. His voice was always relaxing and warmed her heart. Nancy enjoyed staying home most of the time, but whenever she had the chance to travel, she loved to head to Traverse City and visit the shops. Most often, she looked forward to the many special family get-togethers and special events. Those who know her found her easy to talk to and felt connected in her presence. Loving, selfless, and generous beyond measure, she leaves behind a rich collection of fond memories. May these warm memories of the years she shared with her family and friends endure in their hearts forevermore.\n\nNancy Suzanne McNulty, age 79, of Grand Rapids, MI, went to be with her Lord and Savior on November 19, 2022. She was preceded in death by her parents, Richard Charles (Eva) Brown. She is survived by her husband, James McNulty; son, Dan McNulty; three sisters; and many nieces and nephews. Nancy was a 7th-grade teacher for the Kentwood Public Schools. The Funeral Service will be held at noon on Monday, November 28, 2022, at Heritage Life Story Funeral Home – Alt and Shawmut Hills Chapel, 2120 Lake Michigan Dr. NW.
