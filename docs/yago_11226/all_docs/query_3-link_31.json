        "text": "On Sunday night’s episode of “The Walking Dead,” viewers were introduced to Father Gabriel Stokes (Seth Gilliam), a priest haunted by his former sins as he locked members of his parish out of the church, leaving them as prey for the zombie apocalypse.\n\nGilliam is now the third former cast member of “The Wire” to join “The Walking Dead” — as these actors trade drugs and police work for zombie hunting and survival.\n\nHis appearance also comes hot off the heels of “The Wire” reunion during PaleyFest 2014, which saw several members from the show’s five seasons reunited to discuss the show’s lasting impact.\n\nCatch up with the HBO show and see what its stars are up to today.\n\nDominic West as Jimmy McNulty\n\nAfter spending a few years in the theater scene — including a stint as Iago in “Othello” — West returns to television this fall in Showtime’s “The Affair,” playing Noah Solloway, an NYC-based schoolteacher who engages in an extramarital relationship with a waitress from Long Island. The series premiered Oct. 12.\n\nLawrence Gilliard Jr. as D’Angelo Barksdale\n\nGilliard made brief appearances in a number of television programs, including “Law & Order: Criminal Intent,” “Friday Night Lights,” “Southland” and “Army Wives,” before settling in as Bob Stookey on “The Walking Dead.” It’s unclear how long he’ll stick around, as he lost part of his leg to cannibals in Sunday night’s episode.\n\nLance Reddick as Cedric Daniels\n\nReddick landed a starring role as Phillip Broyles on Fox’s “Fringe” during the show’s five-year run (2008-13). Since then, he’s made appearances on “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” “Wilfred” and “American Horror Story: Coven,” as Papa Legba. Reddick returns to the big screen this Friday in the Keanu Reeves action flick “John Wick.”\n\nClarke Peters as Lester Freamon\n\nPeters starred opposite West as the title character in “Othello” at the Sheffield Theatres’ Crucible in fall 2011. This past summer, he returned to the stage as Gloucester in “King Lear” during the Shakespeare in the Park festival in NYC. Most recently, he appears alongside Reddick in “John Wick,” in theaters this week.\n\nWendell Pierce as William “Bunk” Moreland\n\nPierce starred as Harris Green in the short-lived “Michael J. Fox Show” on NBC last season. He will next appear as civil-rights leader Rev. Hosea Williams in “Selma,” out Christmas day.\n\nJohn Doman as William Rawls\n\nFans can watch Doman continue his villainous ways as mob boss Carmine Falcone on Fox’s fall hit series, “Gotham.” He also reunited briefly with West in the pilot episode of “The Affair.”\n\nIdris Elba as Stringer Bell\n\nElba’s career took off following his stint on “The Wire,” including major roles in films such as “Thor,” “Pacific Rim” and “Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.” He also played the title role in the BBC’s “Luther.”\n\nMichael K. Williams as Omar Little\n\nWilliams, who portrayed fan-favorite Omar on “The Wire,” currently stars as Chalky White on “Boardwalk Empire,” which is in its final season.\n\nAmy Ryan as Beadie Russell\n\nRyan appears as Sylvia in this year’s “Birdman,” which was released in theaters last week and will make a strong contender come awards season. She’s also slated to appear in the 2015 film adaptation of “Goosebumps.”\n\nChad Coleman as Dennis “Cutty” Wise\n\nColeman currently stars alongside former “Wire” co-stars Gilliam and Gilliard as Tyreese Williams on “The Walking Dead.”\n\nAidan Gillen as Tommy Carcetti\n\nGillen currently stars as Petyr “Littlefinger” Baelish on HBO’s hit show “Game of Thrones.”\n\nTristan Wilds as Michael Lee\n\nFollowing “The Wire,” Wilds continued to pursue acting, with a starring role in The CW’s “90210.” He also branched out into music, releasing his debut album, “New York: A Love Story,” in fall 2013."
