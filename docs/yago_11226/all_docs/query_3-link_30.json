        "text": "The reviews on Episode 8 are bananas. I’m going to watch it soon. Believe you me.\n\n1. Silly, silly police. In Season 4, Simon went away from pointing out the inefficiency of the police department in truly comic terms. Not as much emphasis on the fuzz, so I understood. But man, having McNulty mimic the serial killer with only a wall separating him and the tap just lets you know how easy it is to pull something off when there’s no good reason to suspect anything.\n\n2. Wonder if white people are offended. I swear, the white editors at The Sun seem like they were written by black comedians. They don’t even seem real. But I do have stories…\n\n3. Told you what Clay was gonna do. He got African as he could, didn’t he? That said–this was a moment when The Wire seemed too much like a TV show. Then again, Clay Davis is realistic. And that is something a cat like that would do. Seriously–Clay Davis put himself out there like he’s Robin Hood. You ain’t Omar, fool.\n\n4. Other funny. The high-profile lawyer would be the lightest skinnedest cat. With a pony tail.\n\n5. The crooked reporter’s gotta go down. Right? I’m not sure either him or Marlo will fall, even though the cosmos should dictate these occurences be law.\n\n6. ‘Splain this to me. How is Omar hobbling around this piece and never accidentally being stumbled upon? Guess the same way he does it with two good legs. Extra gangsta points to Omar for flushing four keys.\n\n7. I hate Carcetti. Clown.\n\n8. Another moment in great parallelism. The cop meeting juxtaposed against the newsroom meeting. All of them investigating something that doesn’t exist. Interesting thing about Templeton–he could have been a hero for finding out this killer doesn’t exist. He’s smart enough to pull that off. But he messed up.\n\n9. Mike works Bodie’s patient. It makes me sad when I realize that.\n\n10. How is Michael going to fold? So many ways out there now to get him out the game. How will he do it? Would he sell Chris out? Marlo wouldn’t go down for that one. Just Chris. And Michael has to know that.\n\n11. Landsman fascinates me. He protects the institution so vigorously in the name of self-preservation, but he doesn’t have enough power to actually be evil. Just a foot soldier, and a good one. But he seemed legitimately happy the money was coming down again. Interesting dude.\n\n12. You don’t get furniture from IKEA for your kids. Not unless you have to. You love them, right?\n\n13. Know what we don’t say enough about Dukie? He is Wallace, except Wallace was more cut out for the game. The similarities are obvious. That doesn’t bode well for him.\n\n14. I preferred Bubbles when he was strung out. There, I said it.\n\n15. Donnell Rawlings has done a great job. OK, Ashy Larry. But he’s managed to offer humor without trying to be a funny man. Not the easiest thing to do. “Y’all can play it how it feels.”\n\n16. The clocks. Any ideas?\n\n17. Poor Sevino. Though, I gotta say Omar had a point. I wonder how th dude that plays Sevino felt when he got the phone call. “Hey, you haven’t been on the show in six years, but we were wondering if you wouldn’t mind coming down and having your brains blown out by Omar. Just a couple hours of your time.”\n\n18. The kid that plays Michael is incredible. You notice how he never stop selling his anxiety around men? Even before we knew that’s what it was, he sold it. Great work.\n\n19. New classic line. From bad lil’ Kennard about Omar. “Gimpy than a mu’fucka.” No idea why that’s so funny.\n\n20. They gotta give us more Clay, right? I mean, he can’t just disappear after his victory. I gotta know!"
