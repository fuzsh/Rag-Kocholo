        "text": "The Wire might just be the finest show HBO has ever produced. David Simon’s crime-drama series is raw, unapologetically rooted in the realities of life in the Baltimore projects and is underscored by its uniquely iconic characters and its exploration of intricate and multifaceted ideas centring on corruption and structural failures.\n\nThere is no other show that even comes close to The Wire in laying bare the shortcomings of the American State and public sector; and it is mainly because of the series’ outstanding writing that The Wire continues to maintain an enduring place among the very best TV has to offer, 22 years after its pilot aired.\n\nSo, I have picked out some of my favourite and very best quotes from each episode of the series. Quotes that capture the essence of what The Wire, its memorable characters and its remarkable story — which is more relevant now than even when the show premiered — are all about.\n\nS1.E1 — The Target\n\nJimmy McNulty: If Snot Boogie always stole the money, why’d you let him play?\n\nSnot Boogie’s Friend: Got to. This America, man.\n\nS1.E2 — The Detail\n\nMarla Daniels: The game is rigged, but you cannot lose if you do not play.\n\nS1.E3 — The Buys\n\nD’Angelo Barksdale: It ain’t like that. See, the king stay the king, aight? Everything stay who he is. Except for the pawns. Now, if the pawn make it all the way down to the other dude’s side, he get to be queen. And like I said, the queen ain’t no bitch. She got all the moves.\n\nBodie Broadus: Aight, so if I make it to the other end, I win.\n\nD’Angelo Barksdale: If you catch the other dude’s king and trap it, then you win.\n\nBodie Broadus: Aight, but if I make it to the end, I’m top dog.\n\nD’Angelo Barksdale: Nah, yo, it ain’t like that. Look, the pawns, man, in the game, they get capped quick. They be out the game early.\n\nBodie Broadus: Unless they some smart ass pawns.\n\nS1.E4 — Old Cases\n\nBunk Moreland: Ah, fuck.\n\nJimmy McNulty: Motherfucker.\n\nBunk Moreland: Fuck, fuck, fucking fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.\n\nJimmy McNulty: What the fuck?\n\nBunk Moreland: Ah fuck.\n\nJimmy McNulty: Fuck! No.\n\nBunk Moreland: Ah, fuck.\n\nJimmy McNulty: Fuck it. How the fuck?\n\nBunk Moreland: Motherfuck. Aw, fuck. Aw fuck.\n\nJimmy McNulty: Fuckity, fuck fuck, fuck fuck, fucker. Ah fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.\n\nBunk Moreland: Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck. Motherfucker.\n\nJimmy McNulty: Fuckin’ A. Fuck.\n\nBunk Moreland: What’s that?\n\nJimmy McNulty: Motherfucker.\n\nBunk Moreland: Fuck me.\n\nS1.E5 — The Pager\n\nDaniel Phelan: Celebrities always seem much smaller when you meet them in person.\n\nS1.E6 — The Wire\n\nLester Freamon: We’re building something here, detective. We’re building it from scratch. All the pieces matter.\n\nS1.E7 — One Arrest\n\nBunk Moreland: A man must have a code.\n\nOmar Little: Oh, no doubt.\n\nS1.E8 — Lessons\n\nOmar Little: Lesson here, ‘Bey: You come at the king, you best not miss.\n\nS1.E9 — Game Day\n\nLester Freamon: You follow drugs, you get drug addicts and drug dealers. But you start to follow the money, and you don’t know where the fuck it’s gonna take you.\n\nS1.E10 — The Cost\n\nProposition Joe: Don’t believe we met. Proposition Joe. You ever steal from me, I’ll kill your whole family.\n\nS1.E11 — The Hunt\n\nJimmy McNulty: If only half you motherfuckers at the district attorney’s office didn’t want to be judges, didn’t want to be partners in some downtown law firm. If half of you had the fucking balls to follow through, you know what would happen? A guy like that would be indicted, tried and convicted. And the rest of ’em would back up enough, so we could push a clean case or two through your courthouse. But no, everybody stays friends. Everybody gets paid. And everybody’s got a fucking future.\n\nS1.E12 — Cleaning Up\n\nCedric Daniels: If you’d wanted to do me, I’d already be done. But there ain’t nothing you fear more than a bad headline, is there? You’d rather live in shit than let the world see you work a shovel.\n\nS1.E13 — Sentencing\n\nEllis Carver: See, that’s why we can’t win.\n\nThomas Herc: Why not?\n\nEllis Carver: They fuck up, they get beat. We fuck up, they give us pensions.\n\nS2.E1 — Ebb Tide\n\nThomas Herc: If white boys wanna sell drugs in Baltimore, they have to make different laws for it, like even it out for ‘em.\n\nKima Greggs: Affirmative action.\n\nThomas Herc: Leave no white man behind.\n\nS2.E2 — Collateral Damage\n\nJimmy McNulty: They can chew you up, but then they gotta spit you out.\n\nS2.E3 — Hot Shots\n\nBeadie Russell: What they need is a union.\n\nS2.E4 — Hard Cases\n\nNick Sobotka: Every morning I ask myself, is today the day I drive down to Fort Armistead and stare out at the harbor? No, I figure eventually, if I mind my own business, uncle Frank will call and wake my ass up at seven in the goddamn morning and get my ass down there for some mysterious fucking reason. So hey.\n\nS2.E5 — Undertow\n\nLester Freamon: Colonel, respectfully, did you just fuck me over without giving me even half a chance to clear this case?\n\nWilliam Rawls: Let’s be clear, Detective Freamon. When I fuck you over, you’ll know it. You’ll be so goddamn certain, you won’t need to ask the question.\n\nS2.E6 — All Prologue\n\nOmar Little: Hey, look, I ain’t never put my gun on no citizen.\n\nMaury Levy: You are amoral, are you not? You are feeding off the violence and the despair of the drug trade. You are stealing from those who themselves are stealing the lifeblood from our city. You are a parasite who leeches off the culture of drugs.\n\nOmar Little: Just like you, man.\n\nMaury Levy: Excuse me? What?\n\nOmar Little: I got the shotgun; you got the briefcase. It’s all in the game though, right?\n\nS2.E7 — Backwash\n\nRoland Pryzbylewski: What if they’re not sneaking anything off this time? What then?\n\nLester Freamon: Ah then, tragically, you will have wasted yet another day in a life you’ve already misspent in the service of the city of Baltimore.\n\nS2.E8 — Duck and Cover\n\nBernard: So I get paid?\n\nThomas Herc: Yeah, you get paid, but you don’t get paid, we get paid.\n\nBernard: Why don’t they give you the money and leave me out of it?\n\nThomas Herc: Cause we need someone to be confidential informant #238, registered with the department. See, we get you registered, we get paid.\n\nBernard: So you’re gonna snap my picture…\n\nEllis Carver: And your Social Security number.\n\nBernard: And they give me money, which you guys keep, and I don’t get nothin’.\n\nThomas Herc: Hey, cuz, did you do anything to deserve the money? Huh?\n\nBernard: Did you?\n\nThomas Herc: Yeah, we cracked the fuckin’ case wide open. We brought back very significant information about a major drug trafficker. That’s what we did.\n\nBernard: But that’s your fuckin’ job, right? You get paid a salary for that.\n\nS2.E9 — Stray Rounds\n\nLester Freamon: You do any accents? English, British, Scottish, something like that?\n\nJimmy McNulty: [British Accent] Crikey! I was looking to get a little hanky-panky and this one bloke gave me this number to call when I got across the pond.\n\nS2.E10 — Storm Warnings\n\nBrother Mouzone: Pellets in plastic. Rat shot. What you need be concerned about is what’s seated in the chamber now: a copper-jacketed, hollow-point, 120-grain hot street load of my own creation. So you need to think for a just a moment and ask yourself: “What do I have to do before this man raise up his gun again?”\n\nS2.E11 — Bad Dreams\n\nTerrence Fitz: State your name.\n\nSergei Malatov: …\n\nJimmy McNulty: No name, huh? Well, for now, we’ll just call you Boris.\n\nSergei Malatov: Boris. Why always Boris?\n\nS2.E12 — Port in a Storm\n\nAvon Barksdale: String, this ain’t about your motherfucking business class either. It ain’t that part of it. It’s that other thing. The street. It’s the street, always.\n\nS3.E1 — Time After Time\n\nBodie Broadus: No matter how many times you get burnt, man, you just keep on doin’ the same.\n\nS3.E2 — All Due Respect\n\nBunny Colvin: You know what I was thinking? That tonight’s a good night. Why? Because my shot cop didn’t die. Then it hit me. This is what makes a good night on my watch. Absence of a negative.\n\nS3.E3 — Dead Soldiers\n\nErvin Burrell: It’s Baltimore, gentlemen. The gods will not save you.\n\nS3.E4 — Amsterdam\n\nBunny Colvin: The truth is I can’t promise you it’s going to get any better. We can’t lock up the thousands out there on the corners. There’d be no place to put them even if we could. We can show you charts and statistics like they mean something, but you’re going back to your home tonight, we’re going to be in our patrol cars and them boys still gonna be out there on the corners. Deep in the game. This is the world we got, people, and it’s about time all of us had the good sense to at least admit that much.\n\nS3.E5 — Straight and True\n\nStringer Bell: Motherfucker, what is that?\n\nShamrock McGinty: Robert Rules say we gotta have minutes for a meeting, right? These the minutes.\n\nStringer Bell: Is you taking notes on a criminal fucking conspiracy?\n\nS3.E6 — Homecoming\n\nCutty Wise: The game ain’t in me no more. None of it.\n\nAvon Barksdale: But you ain’t done shit else, you know what I’m sayin’? So what you gonna do?\n\nCutty Wise: I don’t know. But it can’t be this.\n\nS3.E7 — Back Burners\n\nEllis Carver: This shit is like unemployment insurance. Every employer gotta pay in. If I find out anyone been holding out, then he’s out of here back on the street getting his head busted. The least y’all can do is look out for your own people a little bit.\n\nThomas Herc: What are you, a fuckin’ communist?\n\nS3.E8 — Moral Midgetry\n\nTheresa D’Agostino: Do you think politics is only about winning the argument? That whoever has the right fact at the right moment wins? Clinton had facts. Kennedy had facts, yeah. But Reagan? He couldn’t have summoned a fact if his life depended on it.\n\nS3.E9 — Slapstick\n\nLester Freamon: Hey, hey, hey. A life. A life, Jimmy, you know what that is? It’s the shit that happens while you’re waiting for moments that never come.\n\nS3.E10 — Reformation\n\nBunny Colvin: This drug thing, this ain’t police work. No, it ain’t. I mean, I can send any fool with a badge and a gun up on them corners and jack a crew and grab vials. But policing? I mean, you call something a war and pretty soon everybody gonna be running around acting like warriors. They gonna be running around on a damn crusade, storming corners, slapping on cuffs, racking up body counts. And when you at war, you need a fucking enemy. And pretty soon, damn near everybody on every corner is your fucking enemy. And soon the neighbourhood that you’re supposed to be policing, that’s just occupied territory.\n\nS3.E11 — Middle Ground\n\nStringer Bell: We ain’t gotta dream no more, man. We got real shit. Real estate we can touch.\n\nS3.E12 — Mission Accomplished\n\nRoland Pryzbylewski: “Failure to properly identify myself as a police officer.” Sounds like what I was guilty of most of my career, actually.\n\nS4.E1 — Boys of Summer\n\nTommy Carcetti: You really think they’re gonna vote for the white guy?\n\nNorman Wilson: Black folks been voting white for a long time. You come correct, we listen. It’s y’all that never vote black.\n\nS4.E2 — Soft Eyes\n\nPatrolman: Single wound, upper back, no casings, no witnesses and nothing on the canvas.\n\nEdward Norris: Dead when you got here?\n\nPatrolman: Actually not. He was still conscious and coughin’ blood when I pulled up\n\nEdward Norris: Did you ask who shot him?\n\nPatrolman: Yeah, I asked who shot him. He said it was a guy with a gun.\n\nS4.E3 — Home Rooms\n\nOmar Little: It ain’t what you takin’, it’s who you takin’ from, ya feel me? How you expect to run with the wolves come night when you spend all day sparring with the puppies?\n\nS4.E4 — Refugees\n\nMarlo Stanfield: That’s my money.\n\nOmar Little: Man, money ain’t got no owners, only spenders.\n\nS4.E5 — Alliances\n\nClarence Royce: I admit I’ve made some mistakes, Burrell being one of the biggest. But he’s got a job for about 10 more days. After the primary, he’s gone believe me. And that last stunt — pulling a detective.\n\nOdell Watkins: What’d you expect?\n\nClarence Royce: Not that, huh-uh. Hey, I had nothing to do with that nonsense.\n\nOdell Watkins: Now that’s a straight-up lie. I was at that damn meeting when you told him “Slow the case down.”\n\nClarence Royce: I didn’t mean…\n\nOdell Watkins: Who the hell knows what you mean anymore Clarence?\n\nS4.E6 — Margin of Error\n\nWilliam Rawls: American democracy. Let’s show those Third World fucks how it’s done.\n\nS4.E7 — Unto Others\n\nRoland Pryzbylewski: Trick them into thinking they aren’t learning, and they do.\n\nS4.E8 — Corner Boys\n\nSnoop Pearson: Hey, let’s pray. Here we lay a couple New York boys, who came too far South for they own fuckin’ good. Where yo’ fuckin’ Yankee Pride at now, you fuckin’ bitches?\n\nS4.E9 — Know Your Place\n\nRoland Pryzbylewski: I don’t get it. All this so we score higher on the state tests? If we’re teaching the kids the test questions, what is it assessing in them?\n\nGrace Sampson: Nothing. It assesses us. The test scores go up, they can say the schools are improving. The scores stay down, they can’t.\n\nRoland Pryzbylewski: Juking the stats.\n\nGrace Sampson: Excuse me?\n\nRoland Pryzbylewski: Making robberies into larcenies. Making rapes disappear. You juke the stats, and majors become colonels. I’ve been here before.\n\nGrace Sampson: Wherever you go, there you are.\n\nS4.E10 — Misgivings\n\nBodie Broadus: He’s a cold motherfucker.\n\nMalik ‘Poot’ Carr: It’s a cold world, Bodie.\n\nBodie Broadus: Thought you said it was getting warmer, man.\n\nMalik ‘Poot’ Carr: World going one way, people another.\n\nS4.E11 — A New Day\n\nBunk Moreland: At all hazards, a man must keep up appearances. Dignity, I say. Dignity above all, Governor. Hear, hear!\n\nS4.E12 — That’s Got His Own\n\nRandy Wagstaff: You gonna help, huh? You gonna look out for me? You gonna look out for me, Sergeant Carver? You mean it? You gonna look out for me? You promise? You got my back, huh?\n\nS4.E13 — Final Grades\n\nBodie Broadus: We still in the city?\n\nJimmy McNulty: Cylburn Arboretum. Pimlico’s right up the hill.\n\nBodie Broadus: This is nice…\n\nBodie Broadus: I ain’t no snitch.\n\nJimmy McNulty: Didn’t say you were.\n\nBodie Broadus: Been doin’ this a long time. I ain’t never said nothin’ to no cop…\n\nBodie Broadus: I feel old. I been out there since I was 13. I ain’t never fucked up a count, never stole off a package, never did some shit that I wasn’t told to do. I been straight up. But what come back? Hm? You think if I get jammed up on some shit, they be like: “Aight, yeah, Bodie been there, Bodie hang tough. We got his pay lawyer, we got a bail?” They want me to stand with ’em, right? So where the fuck are they at when they supposed to be standin’ by us? I mean, when shit goes bad and there’s hell to pay, where they at? This game is rigged, man. We like them little bitches on the chessboard.\n\nJimmy McNulty: Pawns.\n\nBodie Broadus: Yo, I’m not snitchin’ on none of my boys. Not my corner, and not no Barksdale people, or what’s left of ’em. But Marlo, his kind, man, they gotta fall. They gotta.\n\nJimmy McNulty: Well, for that to happen, somebody’s gotta step up.\n\nBodie Broadus: I’ll do what I gotta. I don’t give a fuck. Just don’t ask me to live on my fuckin’ knees, you know?\n\nJimmy McNulty: You’re a soldier, Bodie.\n\nBodie Broadus: Hell yeah.\n\nS5.E1 — More with Less\n\nJimmy McNulty: I wonder what it feels like to work in a real fucking police department.\n\nS5.E2 — Unconfirmed Reports\n\nJimmy McNulty: Guy leaves two dozen bodies scattered all over the city, no one gives a fuck.\n\nLester Freamon: It’s because who he dropped.\n\nBunk Moreland: True that. You can go a long way in this country killin’ black folk. Young males especially. Misdemeanor homicides.\n\nJimmy McNulty: If Marlo was killin’ white women…\n\nLester Freamon: White children.\n\nBunk Moreland: Tourists.\n\nJimmy McNulty: One white ex-cheerleader tourist missin’ in Aruba.\n\nBunk Moreland: Trouble is, this ain’t Aruba, bitch.\n\nLester Freamon: You think that if 300 white people were killed in this city every year, they wouldn’t send the 82nd Airborne?\n\nS5.E3 — Not for Attribution\n\nBunk Moreland: Yeah, unless you got caught.\n\nJimmy McNulty: Who in this fucking unit’s going to catch me? Most of the guys up here couldn’t catch the clap in a Mexican whorehouse.\n\nS5.E4 — Transitions\n\nErvin Burrell: Sure, I deserve it. But not for doing the job. What I got, they gave me for carrying their water all these years. To Carcetti, I’m a hack. Royce was no different. Maybe I am. But every day, they send over a new priority. Go after the bad guys. No, change that. Make quality-of-life cases. Get on top of the murders. On second thought, run the whores out of Patterson Park. You think the mayor tells the schools how to teach kids, or the health department how to do its job, or sanitation how to pick up trash? But, get elected, and suddenly, they know police work… You might think it’ll be different, when you sit here. But it won’t. You will eat their shit.\n\nS5.E5 — React Quotes\n\nScott Templeton: Excuse me, sir. Sir. I’m with the Baltimore Sun. Can I talk with you a minute?\n\nHomeless Person: You make an appointment? Sorry, I’m booked up all afternoon.\n\nS5.E6 — The Dickensian Aspect\n\nDaniel Phelan: Never pick a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel.\n\nS5.E7 — Took\n\nReporter: What are you reading there, Senator?\n\nClay Davis: Promethus Bound. An ancient play, one of the oldest we have. About a simple man who was horrifically punished by the powers that be for the terrible crime of trying to bring light to the common people. In the words of… Ascyllius: “No good deed goes unpunished.” I cannot tell you how much consolation I find in these slim pages.\n\nS5.E8 — Clarifications\n\nTerry Hanning: A lie ain’t a side of a story. It’s just a lie.\n\nS5.E9 — Late Editions\n\nReginald ‘Bubbles’ Cousins: Ain’t no shame in holding on to grief, as long as you make room for other things too.\n\nS5.E10 — -30-"
