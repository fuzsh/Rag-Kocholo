        "text": "12,399 views\n\nIn this time of fear and uncertainty, I finally started #TheWire. Here goes: a middle-aged white lady watches the greatest show on earth.\n\nIâve watched the first 5 so far. There will be SPOILERS, so if you havenât seen it, feel free to mute this thread.\n\nOf course, this applies to the kind souls who havenât already muted me for my political rants and weak jokes.\n\nSo this show premiered in 2002 and People Magazine waited 16 years before naming Idris Elba the Sexiest Man Alive?\n\nInsubordinate. And churlish.\n\nI used to scoff at people who thought they discovered Michael B Jordan in Creed and Black Panther b/c I knew he was a star since Friday Night Lights. Whoâs the dumb ass now?\n\n(still/always: me)\n\n#Wallace\n\nLook at this precious, beautiful boy.\n\nOMG this scene.\n\nHis first appearance!! Thereâs no one else on screen when heâs in a scene. Not just Omar, but Michael K. Williams. I remember watching âThe Night Ofâ and I literally felt sorry for every other actor.\n\nHeâs totally fine pointing a shot gun at a baby, okay.\n\nWait.\n\nâ¦\n\n(spoiler)\n\n(seriously, donât ruin it for yourselves)\n\n(this is beautiful and youâre gonna wreck it)\n\nâ¦\n\nOmarâs gay!\n\nThe greatest character in TV history, played by one of the greatest actors in the world, is gay. And tender and loving and funny and amazing and fearless and feared and I love him. OMG.\n\nWhen I heard about âthe fuck sceneâ in #TheWire, this is not what I expected.\n\nð¤£ð¤£ð¤£\n\nWhen your new co-worker hasnât figured out youâre gay yey, so he stops by your house in the middle of the night.\n\nOMG these characters. This fool Pryzbylewski pistol whips a kid and blinds him, then proves to be invaluable in the office. Like when you think Kimaâs running down the hill to stop a police beating, but sheâs actually joining in.\n\n5 down, 8 more to go!\n\nStay tuned OMG I'm obsessed.\n\n#TheWire\n\nGive this man an EGOT.\n\nI thought McNulty's kids would be playing when Omar saw the body of his beloved. I wanted him to scream in agony so the kids would hear it from the floor above. And then thatâs exactly what happened. And it ripped my heart apart.\n\n\"You come at the king, you best not miss.\"\n\n(I watched this sequence 5x)\n\nWallaceâs little sister unable to figure out her math problem when itâs about trains, but getting it instantly when Wallace puts it in terms of a drug deal. âCount be wrong, theyâll fuck you up.â\n\nð³ð°ð­\n\nHis whole self and body is in this character. Michael K Williams was a model, a choreographer, and danced with Madonna and George Michael. #OhIndeed\n\nBubbles!\n\nClean for 3 days and thanking the Lord.\n\nWhen the guy who hates your guts can still tell you it's not your fault.\n\nWee-Bey's the gif guy!\n\nStringer: âWell, shorty was a copâ¦ And she ainât dead.â\n\nSurprisingly cute for a guy who raped a drugged girl, let her die then tossed her in a dumpster.\n\nNo.\n\nNo, no, nope.\n\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\nâThis is me, yo, right here.â\n\nHow DARE you.\n\nI was bawling. Iâm too fragile to watch this right now.\n\nThis was brutal and I was sobbing but I could still admire the touch of that Tupac poster.\n\nThe Hate You Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody:\n\nT\n\nH\n\nU\n\nG\n\nL\n\nI\n\nF\n\nE\n\nAh, Herc and Carver. Silently debating then deciding to take some money.\n\nVery happy these two got together.\n\nBack to work.\n\nHow can it possibly get better than Season One?\n\nWhen I wonder why I never watched it in the first place, I think I thought it was depressing. It's not. It's devastating which is very different and way better.\n\nThank you to everyone who raved about the show, especially @Nick_Beaton who told me he re-watches it regularly!\n\nAnd thank you to @AoDespair for creating something so beautiful, brilliant and humane.\n\n#TheWire\n\n!!!!!\n\nWhen you write about #TheWire and @AoDespair posts your thread.\n\nð³ð¤¯ð­ðð\n\nTime for Season 2!\n\nSo! #TheWireSeason2 blew my mind. I'm not live-tweeting but I scribble while I watch and I've left my crazy tangents in. I haven't read anything online b/c I don't want spoilers but I checked IMDb for a character name I got hilariously wrong.\n\nOMG -\n\nHerc: White boys wanna sell drugs in Baltimore they have to make different laws for it. Like even it out for them.\n\nKima: Affirmative action?\n\nHerc: Leave no white man behind.\n\nI love Amy Ryan and I love Beadie Russell, but wow, that got dark quick.\n\n\"I'm an XL.\"\n\n\"No doubt.\"\n\nIdris from #TheOffice interjecting to say Donette never stood a chance.\n\nHe says \"Oh, indeed\" before sex! I'm dying.\n\nThis is how you write a gay character. You don't Dumbledore that shit, you let him be who he is.\n\nI LOVE Harry Potter and I know it's harder to have LGBTQ characters in kids' books, but until the Dumbledore afterthought, the main thing that bugged me about the books was how often Hermione was described as shrill.\n\nJay is like Brad Pitt - eating in every scene.\n\nWhen your partner can't get on board with your job.\n\n$2,000 buys you an ugly new coat, but it can't buy you respect.\n\nThe betrayal in this scene!\n\nWhen you differ on what constitutes formal wear.\n\nNot ashamed to say I would 100% be seduced by this.\n\nThis is just gonna be an Omar Fan Account.\n\nWhen you tell the man with a moral code that he's amoral, he will correct you.\n\nI was yelling at the screen, wanting him to call out this dirtbag. And he did!\n\n\"I got the shotgun. You got the briefcase. It's all in the game, though, right?\"\n\nFeels like Ares and Mars: same dude, different name.\n\nAnd the same drugs that get resold under a dif. name.\n\nI can't even handle this scene. Omar is just utterly himself. Calm, confident, no filter. I don't mean \"he has no filter\" like he's rude. I mean he lets his God-self be visible. He's in a room full of supposedly powerful ppl and feels no fear b/c he has nothing to hide.\n\nTangent!! The scene made me remember the 1st time I saw Richard Pryor perform on TV. The energy literally shifted in the room and I honestly thought, \"Oh! That's God.\" Like that's what God looks like on earth - a person fully themselves.\n\nThis is nothing to do with religion and you don't even have to believe in God. It's about people and characters who make our heart soar b/c they prove that we can live like that. We can strip away whatever walls we've built btwn ourselves and the world and live life unafraid.\n\nI realize my all-time favorite movies know this...\n\nMaybe the hero is authentically himself from the outset, so he must sacrifice himself to save others.\n\n#OneFlewOverTheCuckoosNest\n\nMaybe he's been ashamed of who he is his entire life but has a moment of vulnerability at the very end when he shows one person his true self.\n\n#Moonlight\n\nMaybe he doesn't figure it out until he's dead and a child has to teach his ghost.\n\n#TheSixthSense\n\nI'M LOSING THE ROOM!\n\nOMG prison book club. I've always HATED The Great Gatsby b/c Daisy is so nothing! But D has a much richer understanding of the book.\n\n\"You can change up, you can give yourself a whole new story. But what came first is who you really are...don't matter that some fool say he different 'cause the only thing that make you different is what you really do, what you go through.\"\n\nSame dude, different name!\n\nAlso totally felt like the chess scene from S1!\n\nStill. I honestly, stupidly sat there thinking D wouldn't die. The whole time he was being strangled. When he went limp and was dragged to the door. I just thought, he'll get back up.\n\nGuys, I don't know if I recommend watching this show when the world is in crisis and your mom died suddenly of a fall 2 months ago... after the slow, gradual death of 3 years of Alzheimer's.\n\nWhen Wallace died, fictional character or not, I thought, \"This is what my therapist talks about - cumulative grief, compound loss! What am I doing?\"\n\nWhen D died, I had to take a break.\n\nFake consoling the mother of the guy you had killed - just your typical funeral scenario.\n\nWhen you know the robots will replace you.\n\nHorseface contemplates fake vs. real tits - do we care, do we not?\n\nSpeaking of... let's take a moment to appreciate the stunning perfection of Nick's wife's body.\n\nYeah, this is not gonna end well.\n\nThis duck needs to pace himself. Do what I do, duck! Glass of wine, glass of water, glass of wine, glass of water, go home!\n\nSeriously, this is animal cruelty and it's giving me severe anxiety.\n\nWhen you think you're gonna get with the office slut but he puts on his jacket and goes home.\n\n(Is she in later seasons? Do they get together?! Don't tell me. But... she's so much more interesting than Ronnie)\n\nCheese meets Brother Mouzone. It does not go well.\n\n(Confession: I thought his name was Brother Moves On until I checked IMDb!)\n\nMcNulty with prostitutes: You're late!\n\nBunk and Kima: ...\n\nAaaaaaand the duck's dead.\n\nA thought popped into my head and it made me mad so I'm gonna explore it! Is Ziggy the Wallace of S2? Because... I can't stand him. Wallace was a tender angel, Ziggy's a walking Kick Me sign. A teenage Fredo. He whips his dick out and says the n-word. Don't make me love him.\n\nBut... just like Wallace, his mother's a drug addict and grown men put him in harm's way. But in Ziggy's case, it's not for money, it's for laughs. It's like Lord of the Flies, he's (a thin, dumb) Piggy, but his bullies are adults.\n\nBut! He exposes himself. Regularly. He says the world's worst slur. Regularly. I believe it's intentional we have a hard time w/ this kid. It's easy to love Baby Killmonger. It's a lot harder to love a petulant prick who fucks up everything he touches.\n\nDAMN. David Simon wrote Joker 16 years before Joker, didn't he.\n\nFull disclosure: I never saw it, but doesn't he get tormented and kill people? Ziggy's gonna kill people, isn't he?\n\nI did see SNL's Grouch and it's brilliant.\n\nAnd there it is.\n\nDaniels is all of us when Prez punched Valchek.\n\nMerritt Weaver!! Since this season deals w/ the global disregard for female bodies, please go watch her in Unbelievable.\n\nThis petty little bitch!\n\nHelp me out b/c this scene bothered me. Why can I tell Stringer's lying but Omar can't? Not like how viewers know stuff before characters do. I mean Omar should know, shouldn't he?\n\nAnyway, please don't let him shoot Brother Mouzone/Moves On without talking to him first.\n\nWelp! So much for that. But he didn't kill him when he realized Stringer had lied.\n\nBeadie in pursuit!!!\n\n\"Now she's got game.\"\n\nZiggy to his dad: \"I got tired of being a punchline to every joke.\"\n\nSounds like a line from (my imagined version of) Joker to ME!\n\nDear God, please stop emailing this guy.\n\nSigh...\n\nThe world just keeps turning, right? You guys move on to something new, no one looks back.\n\nThis drinking scene vs. the one in episode one...\n\nThere was the same sense of tragic inevitability in Frank's world as in the towers. Like how else are they gonna survive if they don't commit crimes? It's not possible. And it's not possible b/c of the evil men far above them.\n\nSome happy images until we meet again for S3 of @AoDespair's masterpiece.\n\n#TheWire Season 3.\n\nSubtitle: Rip My Heart Open Again, Why Donât You.\n\nWow, the end of an era. Poot and Bodie watch the towers fall.\n\nâYâall some cold ass motherfuckers, man.â - Cheese to Bunk and McNulty who have no idea he's talking about an actual dog. The dog fight stuff was brutal to watch, but worth it for this scene.\n\nMARLO!!\n\nâDo it or donât. I got places to be.â\n\nDamn.\n\nBubbles thanks him for his kindness but that wasnât kindness. It wasâ¦ nothing. An absence of feeling. Blank, brutal, efficient.\n\n\"So y'all go to the movies?\"\n\nA lesson in status. Youâre on a date, you get humiliated by your nemeses, then everybody gets upstaged by Hot Cop and his Hot GF.\n\nHerc and Carver discussing their fantasies was hilarious, but I forgot how guys used to count down till the Olsen twins were legal. Sigh... men are the worst even when theyâre not.\n\nCutty meets up with his ex.\n\nâLookinâ at youâ¦ hurts.â\n\nâShouldnât look then.â\n\nDamn.\n\nâYo! My turn to be Omar!â\n\nThis is me in quarantine\n\nWorks. Of. Art.\n\nWhen you realize youâre becoming McNulty.\n\nOMG Brianna cutting Donetteâs hair.\n\nCelie shaving Mister.\n\nSame Energy.\n\nThis is a Rembrandt painting. The emotion from still images is amazing this season. Shadows and gold, dark and light. I kept yelling Chiaroscuro at the screen like a mad woman.\n\nThis felt veryâ¦ stigmata via cigarette burn to me. And again, visually beautiful.\n\nâDamn, I opened up too early, man. Stepped on your shot.â\n\nThis boy was killed by accident while pulling out his inhaler. And Cutty realizes he canât do this.\n\nâIt ainât me no more.â\n\nOmar gets a lecture from Bunk, spits when itâs done and later complains: âThat fat man gave me an itch I canât scratch.â\n\nThis is hell. This is Bubbles descending into hell. Oh my GOD.\n\nMe sending my husband into the grocery store. âI want a Shrek Slurpee, Bernard. And some Krispee Kreme.â\n\nHerc: âWhat are you, a fuckinâ communist?â as Carver hands out unemployment insurance.\n\nBunk gets the gun back from Omar and itâs gift wrapped specially for him.\n\nCutty meets with the Deacon, becomes a new man. âItâs like Iâm standing outside myself, watching me do stuff I donât wanna doâ¦ never, ever being able to stop the show.â From then on, he will be Dennis.\n\nAlso, OMG, the drugs this season are WMD and apocalypse.\n\nSurrounded by pigeons, this is the most emotion Marloâs shown all season.\n\nPretty in pink, Snoop gets her first kill.\n\nSweet, smiling Prez showing his skills on the job.\n\nI love how the detectives admire the discipline of the drug dealers. With Hamsterdam, theyâre all in one place, and âthat place is hell.â\n\n!!!!!!\n\nWhen âAre you saying Iâm not likable?â gets you a five-minute response from your campaign manager and your wife.\n\nMcNulty reminds Brianna about her son: âYou were the one who made him take the years, right?â\n\nStringer violates the Sunday morning truce to try to get Omar, but his fools shoot grandmaâs church hat instead!\n\nColvin talks about his vacation and retirement so often, thereâs no way in hell heâs gonna get either.\n\nThis is your parents on Skype.\n\nLester cautions McNulty that a job will not save you and a good case ends. Thenâ¦ pan across to BEADIE!!! Her picture on the fridge! Oh please make this happen.\n\nOh God. This gutted me.\n\nPrez: âI didnât give a shit he was black orâ¦ whatever. Or maybe I did. How the fuck do you know if thatâs in your head or if itâs not?â\n\nWhat an HONEST answer. A hell of a lot better than McNulty talking about âthe good onesâ to that cop whose wife he just realized is black.\n\nAnd when Daniels asks Prez if he identified himself as a cop first, he doesnât answer. Because he doesnât identify as a cop. !!!!!!!!!!! This whole season is about identity, oh my GOD.\n\nBrother Mouzone! âReform, Lamar. Reform!â\n\nDennis, bathed in gold, radiating purity and hope. Please donât kill him.\n\nJesus, Marlo killing that girl by shooting her in the breasts and then mouth is sick and seems to go beyond (beneath?) his non-persona to something sexually depraved. Unless he sees it as fitting for someone who used her sexuality to trap him.\n\nTheresa D'Agostino: âItâs politics. Live with it or lose.â\n\nShe and Marlo make a good pair. Machines, both of them.\n\nAre you trying to seduce me, Ms. Pearlman?\n\n(Yes Judge Phelan, and itâs comically sad how easy it is)\n\nAAHHHHHMAZING.\n\nRawls just casually in the bg of a scene in a gay bar.\n\nWhen you think you see your long lost love, but it turns out to be just a pale imitation.\n\nMcNulty: I feel like I donât even belong to any world that even fuckinâ matters. Iâm just a breathing machine for my fuckinâ dick.â\n\n!!!!\n\n#TheWire Season 3: Who are you.\n\nAuthentic, inauthentic or machine.\n\n\"Us, motherfucker.\"\n\nAdmiring the view, reminiscing, casually asking where the other oneâs gonna be later. Just curious! Not sending someone over to kill them or anything.\n\nSeriously, though. What a scene.\n\nBut what about THIS SCENE??!\n\nAnother Renaissance painting, this time with amazing dialogue.\n\nBM: I admire a man with confidence.\n\nO: I donât see no sweat on your brow neither, bro.\n\nBM: I want to ask you something. Brother.\n\nO: Omar listeninâ.\n\nLevy laughing that Stringer got ârainmadeâ while the mayor and his staff figure out how to spin Hamsterdam to make themselves look good. The politicians FREAKING when they learned about Colvin's experiment was something to behold.\n\nWith just a bowtie, a shotgun and a dream, you wonât believe what this odd couple gets up to. Joining NBCâs iconic Thursday comedy block this fall, it's... Little/Brother\n\nOmar barges in and shoots the body guard. Stringer takes off! Omar enters a room and birds fly up like in a goddamn John Woo movie! Stringer still doesnât get that it âainât about your money, bro.â\n\nAnd we end on more stunning cinematography.\n\nSeeing your ex, part 2: âIâm proud of you, Dennis. Be well.â\n\nMcNulty in Stringerâs gorgeous apartment: âWho the fuck was I chasing?â\n\nKima really becoming McNulty, using his method for cheating, then thanking him the morning after. Who is she now?\n\nPrez: 6 out of 10 black officers think Iâm just an asshole racist.\n\nLester: On the other hand, 4 out of 10 think youâre just an asshole.\n\nHe failed to properly identify himself.\n\nIt's gut wrenching and perfect.\n\nMore Chiarascuro! McNulty looks into the light (while #DrunkBunk slumps over a car. I love drunk Bunk.)\n\nMcNulty shows Avon exactly who ratted him out. Russell aka Stringer Bell. (aka Achmed if you need the FBIâs help during the war on terror)\n\nBernard: \"I canât wait to go to jail.\"\n\nHilarious!\n\nDaniels and Ronnie (did not see that coming btw) have a real date in public, Johnny finally ODs, and Colvinâs out. No retirement, no vacation.\n\nMcNulty quits, channeling George Costanza: \"Itâs not you, itâs me.\"\n\nThen... McNulty goes to see BEADIIIEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!\n\nShe invites him in for a drink.\n\nHe says no.\n\nBut he will go in to meet her kids.\n\nIâm screaming.\n\nAs we pan across to Omar looking out at the water, we see a tattered poster for Frank Sobotka! Nice.\n\nMarlo watching the trial. Still a terrifying blank.\n\nCarver goes to Dennis' gym, sees more of a kindred spirit than Herc...?\n\nMcNulty, working âwhere it feels like home.â\n\nFull circle with the woman at the community meeting who longed to know her policeman's name again.\n\nPerfection!\n\nBubbles and Colvin look out at the rubble, a mirror image to the destroyed towers in episode one.\n\nSo thereâs Season 3. Flawless.\n\nEvery morning for the last two and a half months, I wake up and think â remember, really - my mom is dead. Then I think of the characters on this show and how much I love them. All of them.\n\nThank you, David Simon. Again.\n\nUntil Season 4.\n\n#TheWire @AoDespair\n\nFinished #TheWire Season 4 on Easter Sunday.\n\nI couldnât stop crying and felt like Iâd been punched in the heart. I feel weird posting this thread b/c Twitter reads like the obituaries, and actual obituaries are 20 pages long now.\n\nI wake up scared every morning. Iâm grieving the entire world, so I thought, maybe I'm overreacting. But I watched the whole season a 2nd time and cried all over again.\n\nItâs perfect, Iâm grateful it exists, and thatâs true whether the planet is in crisis or not.\n\nI also have no job at the moment, so watching and madly writing about this show feels like the most significant thing Iâm doing!\n\n#TheWire\n\nFirst:\n\n1) The drug this season is called pandemic. PANDEMIC.\n\n2) Every bad thing that happened this season was Hercâs fault. This arrogant, incompetent clown. May everyone look upon him like Sydnor and Bunk do for the rest of his days. #FuckYourFuckinStripes\n\n3) OK, every bad thing is the fault of institutions: police, the political system, the school system. They all âjuke the statsâ and serve themselves instead of the people within them.\n\n4) Nothing Iâve ever seen has so powerfully dealt w/ abuse and shame than #Season4 of #TheWire\n\nWhen youâre quarantined, itâs fun to see other people shop for cool stuff.\n\nIn one episode, Randy goes from jubilant child planning a pee prank to haunted boy fearing a zombie he somehow created himself.\n\nSigh. I knew this angel would break my heart the minute I saw him. #Dukie\n\nThe whole political story was so fascinating, it couldâve been a show on its own. BONUS: the brilliant Reg E. Cathey who plays Norman got to call Kevin Spacey a motherfucker on House of Cards!\n\nA BABY IS DRIVING!!! â what I yelled at the screen when Donut pulled up.\n\nNorman (re: debate): Nothinâ matters more at this point.\n\nTommy: Let the truth set you free, Norman. Nothinâ matters at all.\n\nNamond Brice: Iâll take any motherfuckerâs money if heâs givinâ it away.\n\nClay Davis: Iâll take any motherfuckerâs money if heâs givinâ it away.\n\nJust a casual morning stroll for Honey Nut Cheerios. Whether youâre in a vest and trench coat or turquoise silk pajamas, everybody still yells, âOmar cominâ!â\n\nTrauma recognizes trauma.\n\nDukie trying to calm the girl who sliced her classroom nemesis.\n\nMarlo: You want it to be one way. You want it to be one way. You want it to be one way. But itâs the other way.\n\n(The final shot of Marlo in ep. 13 is by a One Way sign)\n\nBunk being Bunk while Lester works the case is my favorite thing - trying to pick up women (the plural of pussy is puss-i), dancing as Lester looks for clues, talking about JLo's \"prime cut of ass\" and \"that itty bitty little Spanish dude\" she married.\n\n\"Boy, you got me confused w/ a man who repeats himself.\"\n\nIâm stunned this didnât happen before now, and equally stunned Tommy stopped at just a kiss.\n\n!!!!!!!!!\n\nSherrod drew Bubbles in his French dictionary (that he somehow thought would help with algebra).\n\nPrez finding the ultimate stash: new textbooks and a computer.\n\nAll the boys happily learning b/c of Prez. \"The math be right, Mr. P!\"\n\nI literally screamed at this shot of Dukie.\n\n(Like I said, I watched the whole season twice.\n\nScreamed both times.)\n\nBut if you need somebody to betray an innocent?\n\nHercâs your guy.\n\n(I know Officer Walker's human garbage and ripped off Randy, Bubbles and Omar and broke Donut's fingers. Herc still does more damage.)\n\nTHIS SCENE.\n\nColvin says later: I saw them plummet from masters of the universe to abject fear to humiliated fury w/ no awareness of it â it was too much for them to process â how do you get them to believe in themselves if they canât even admit their feelings about who they are\n\nHere it is â the moment I finally knew what Michaelâs stepdad did to him. The moment where Chris sees him, the way Dukie saw that girl in the classroom. Trauma recognizes trauma.\n\nI didnât get it when Michael refused to ride home alone with Dennis. I didnât get it when Michael ran out of Bugâs classroom terrified that Bugâs dad had taken him, and I didnât get it when Michael called Dennis too friendly and a f*ggot.\n\nThe whole time, I assumed the stepdad had beaten him. I realized heâd molested him only when Chris realized it. He saw Michaelâs pain b/c heâd been molested too.\n\nHe beat Michaelâs stepdad to death with his bare hands. Chris - the guy who casually shoots someone in the head the second he knows theyâre not from Baltimore. Dumps dead bodies in deserted buildings then goes for Chinese food.\n\nIt was revenge Chris had waited for his entire life, exacted on Michaelâs sexual abuser instead of his own, and a stunned Snoop watched it happen.\n\nMichaelâs face to his mother: You promised me he would never come back. You lied. And now heâs dead.\n\nOn a lighter note! Bubbles getting Herc to chase the Reverendâs car was amazing. Only Herc would think Marloâs license plate would be PR8ZGOD.\n\nOmar entering Prop Joeâs shop to fix his clock. Why? \"It ran outta time.\" #TickleMyFancyFatMan\n\nElena looking at McNulty and saying, \"If I'd known you were gonna grow up to be a grown up...\"\n\nBubbles welcoming Sherrod home again: \"This is you, right here, right now.\" #Wallace\n\nLester: \"This is a tomb. Lex is in there.\"\n\nBubbles makes poisonâ¦ that will obviously not kill its intended target.\n\nThe Dream Team.\n\nOMG this sequence.\n\nDamn.\n\nRandy to Carver: \"You gonna look out for me? For ME? You promise? You got my back, huh?\"\n\nSobbing.\n\nBodie: This game is rigged, man. We like those little bitches on the chess board.\n\nMcNulty: Pawns.\n\n...\n\nMcNulty: You're a soldier, Bodie.\n\nBodie: Hell, yeah.\n\nCheese: This is some shameless shit.\n\nOmar: Ainât no shame in my game.\n\nOmar has no shame in the best way possible.\n\nRandy: Itâs ok\n\nCarver: What.\n\nRandy: You tried. No need to feel bad. Thanks.\n\nI mean... kill me now.\n\nThis scene. My God.\n\nAt first I was like, whoâs the guy in the car w/ Kima? I couldnât remember. How does he know Bubbles?\n\nThen he says this:\n\n\"Shameâs some tricky shit, ainât it. Makes you feel like you wanna change and then beats you back down when you think you canât.\"\n\nItâs Bubbles' sponsor. Walon!!!!! From Season 1!\n\nAND (why didnât I know this) itâs Steve Earle!\n\nWho sang the S2 closing montage song!\n\nI was fully on the floor sobbing at this scene.\n\nPrez teaches the story of Damon and Pythias which Iâd never heard of. Itâs about two great friends willing to sacrifice their lives for the other. When one is sentenced to death, the other steps in for him so he can go home and say his final goodbyes.\n\nBut these boys canât go home. They literally say that, in multiple episodes, sobbing. Their houses are burned, theyâre evicted, their stuff is thrown into the street, and their parents are abusive, addicted, both or dead.\n\nEven Sherrod â Bubbles keeps telling him he can come home, but when he finally does, he ends up dead by accident.\n\nHow do you have loyalty if you donât have a home?\n\nDespite all the efforts of Dennis, Carver, Prez and Colvin, only one boy is saved. One.\n\nâThe opposite of poverty is not wealth; the opposite of poverty is justiceâ¦ The true measure of our character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned.â\n\nI kept thinking of these words by Bryan Stevenson, lawyer and social justice activist, and the subject of \"Just Mercy\" one of my favorite movies of last year.\n\nI highly recommend watching it.\n\nBryan is portrayed by Michael B. Jordan.\n\nWallace.\n\n\"Thank you\" feels so dumb, or at least inadequate, to say after getting to see something so stunning. But once again, thank you @AoDespair for this beautiful, compassionate work of art.\n\n#TheWire\n\n#TheWireSeason4\n\nâAmericans are a stupid people, by and large. We pretty much believe whatever weâre told.â\n\nâThe bigger the lie? The more they believe.â\n\nI'm back tweeting Season 5 of #TheWire! And if it isn't the most painfully relevant thing you could see in 2020, I don't know what is.\n\nIt's taken me forever b/c I was stalling. I didnât want to come to the end. It would mean I couldnât watch it for the first time ever again. It would also, illogically, mean my mom was really dead, since the showâs been my obsession since soon after she passed away.\n\nBut here we go anyway and at last!\n\nMayor Carcetti declared it âa new dayâ at the end of Season 4, but now everybodyâs broke. Cops and journalists have no money, and âDo more with less!â is repeated ad nauseum by smug, grey haired men for 10 episodes straight.\n\nAs in Season 4, every word Walon speaks to Bubs kills me.\n\nWalon: You canât let it go until you let it out.\n\nBubs: I donât feel nothinâ!\n\nWalon: That was never your problem.\n\nI LOVE when Avon Barksdale stepped into the prison visiting booth to chat with Marlo. I missed his smirking charisma.\n\nClay Davisâ shits last at least 4 seconds each this season and I love it. #Sheeeeeeeeiiiiitt\n\nFACTS~\n\nBunk: You can go a long way in this country killinâ black folk. Young males especially. Misdemeanor homicides.\n\nMcNulty: If Marlo was killing white women--\n\nLester: White children.\n\nBunk: Tourists!\n\nLester: You think that if 300 white people were killed in this city every year they wouldnât send the 82nd airborne?\n\nIn the newsroom, Fletcher tells Alma why her storyâs not getting traction: âThe 3 murders, theyâre in the wrong zip code. Theyâre dead where it doesnât count.â\n\nThis show is a masterclass is creative cursing:\n\nMcNulty: Most of the guys up here couldnât catch the clap in a Mexican whore house.\n\nValchek: Fuckinâ Burellâs asshole must be so tight you couldnât pull a pin from it with a John Deere tractor\n\nTHE RELEVANCE!\n\nLester: A case like this, where you show who gets paid behind all the tragedy and the fraud, where you show how the money routes itself, how weâre all, all of us, vested, all of us complicit?\n\nSydnor: Career case huh?\n\nLester: Baby I could die happy.\n\nMichael, Dukie and Bug go to 6 Flags. For one day, theyâre just kids.\n\nWhen you bring in the smart guy to talk logic, but he ends up on the side of crazy. Lester tells McNulty heâs on to something, but they have to make it more elaborate.McNulty replies, âWe have to kill again!â ð\n\nBut, um, McNultyâs idea isn't... terrible? How DO you get money to solve the crimes that endanger Black people? You pretend the moneyâs for something more âinteresting.â And apparently, white homeless men chomping on each other fits the bill.\n\nYou can smell the ocean in this scene. Omar and Renaldo are living the dream, complete with sea, sun and sweet Honeynut Cheerios.\n\nWhen I watched this a second time, I realized that kids see Omar cominâ and run toward him, not away. Please tell me how this show is so perfect OMG\n\nWhen Omar learns of Butchieâs death.\n\nDevastation. Rage. Resolve.\n\nWhen Marlo met The Greek!\n\nI'm obsessed w/ these two charactersâ introductions. The second we saw the old man in the elegant coat in S2 and the young man in the terrycloth headband in S3, we knew we should be TERRIFIED.\n\nReporter Gus Haynes (Haynes!) told to lose the profanity and be more âcollegial.â I love that the bosses kept asking for âthe Dickensian aspectâ of homelessness. I remember people talking about #TheWire years ago like it was a Dickens novel, rendering it quaint, palatable. Wrong.\n\nCarver tells Herc, âIt ALL matters. I know we thought it didnât. But it does.â\n\nHerc stares blankly in response b/c heâs the guy who buys drinks for cops to get info for Levy.\n\nBeadie to McNulty: âWe had something.â\n\nI was ecstatic when these two got together and so bummed when he started drinking again. But Jimmyâs an addict. Why should his journey be so different from Bubblesâ?\n\nI like to think this was Dominic Westâs audition for #TheAffair.\n\nProp Joe to Marlo: âI treated you like a son.â\n\nMarlo: âWasnât made to play the son.â\n\nThe betrayal!\n\nThis is one of the most gut-wrenching exchanges of the entire series.\n\nDukie: âHow do you get from here to the rest of the world?â\n\nDennis: âI wish I knew.â\n\nSeriously. Just yank my heart out of my chest, smash it into a thousand pieces and kick those pieces off a cliff.\n\nWhen you call your own cell to get a fake quote for your fake story.\n\nBubsâ HIV test comes back negative and Walon can tell heâs disappointed.\n\nWalon: âThis is you trying to make the past be everything. Mean everything. You donât even wanna think about the here and now. Sorry, Bubs. Shame ainât worth as much as you think. Let it go.â\n\nWalonâs wisdom is like a decadeâs worth of my therapy distilled into a few brilliant, compassionate sentences.\n\nHow great an actor is Dominic West? Look at his face when he knows Scottâs lying.\n\nThe shoot out!!\n\nOmarâs best friend Donnie is killed.\n\nDonnie is played by Donnie Andrews, the real Omar! Heâs the basis for Omar! ð¤¯\n\nI also watched this leap about 12 times.\n\nMarlo: âThatâs some Spider-Man shit there.â\n\nItâs a great line, but itâs true too. Omarâs a legend. A super hero. Kids played him in the street. S5 is all about legacy â what will these characters leave behind? Who will immortalize them or seek to erase them altogether?\n\nSpider-Man tends to his wounds.\n\nâThatâs nobody, Mr. Mayor. Thatâs nobody at all.â\n\nNoooooo! Itâs NICK!\n\nWhen you give the speech of your career â of your life! â and itâs all over a lie.\n\nAnother gut punch: seeing a grown Randy abandoned in this hell hole.\n\nâWhy donât you promise to get me outta here? Thatâs what yâall do, ainât it? Lie to dumbass n--â\n\nAgain, just kick me in the stomach, it would hurt less.\n\nOmar: \"Tell Marlo I burned the money. Tell that boy he ainât man enough to meet Omar in the street!\"\n\nJust like with Stringer, this is not about the money. Itâs about the code. â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸\n\nWhen youâre looking for a legit job and stumble across an ad for exotic dancer.\n\nDaniels is always in a suit, looking slim and proper, so I appreciate when weâre reminded that his bodyâs basically a yield sign. (I loved Ronnie this season too!)\n\nBubs wonât take money for Fletcherâs story, but asks him to âwrite it like it feelsâ â you know, the opposite of how Scott writes.\n\nOmar: âIâm gonna drop all his muscle till he get the heart to come down to the street and dance.â\n\nMichaelâs terrified â as he should be â while that little shit Kenard is like, THAT'S Omar?\n\nâA lie ainât a side of a story. Itâs just a lie.â\n\nJoe Biden should put that statement in one of his ads.\n\nWhen youâre about to blow up a cat but stop yourself to kill the king.\n\nI thought the shop keeper was just screaming, but sheâs saying, âOmar DEAD!â over and over. Dead at the hands of a child who we first met in Season 3 playing on a sidewalk and yelling, âItâs MY turn to be Omar.â You will never be Omar, Kenard. And I will never forgive you.\n\nWhen the FBI profile of a serial killer is literally you.\n\nâTheyâre in the ball park.â\n\nBeadie goes Beyonce.\n\n(I left a note in the hallway. By the time you read it, I'll be far away.)\n\nTommyâs wife watching her husband get off to his own image.\n\nLester gets his manâ¦ even if itâs only for a little while.\n\nMarlo yells, âMy name is my NAME.â\n\nBut whatâs his legacy, though?\n\nHeâs a guy who risked nothing and sacrificed his friends for a reign of terror that protected only his ego.\n\nThe only ppl he killed himself are a girl who was the pawn in someone elseâs scheme (S3), and some guy overheard praising Omar (S5 finale). He's the opposite of Omar. The anti-Omar. His name puts the O at the end and takes the L because his legacy is one of total and utter loss.\n\nWalon finally learns Bubsâ real name is Reginald! And Bubs finally tells the story of Sherrod. âThere ainât no shame in holding on to griefâ¦ as long as you make room for other things too.â\n\nWALON AND BUBS ARE MY HEROES! ð­ð­ð­\n\nSnoop: How my hair look, Mike?\n\nMichael: You look good, girl.\n\nJesus Christ.\n\nIf that didnât destroy you, hereâs Bug saying goodbye to Dukieâ¦\n\nAnd Bug saying goodbye to Michaelâ¦\n\nAnd Dukie and Michael saying goodbye without saying goodbye.\n\nKILL. ME.\n\nWhen Dukie visited his old school, I got excited. The principalâs gonna be so happy to see him! Prez will adopt him like Colvin adopted Namond! Of course the principal didnât recognize him and Prez was guarded and wary â which he shouldâve been b/c Dukie lied to his face.\n\nWalon reading Fletcher's article: âAre you scared of somebody callinâ you good?â\n\nThen Walon gives Bubs a quote to read...\n\nâYou can hold back from the suffering of the world. You have free permission to do so, and it is in accordance with your nature. But perhaps the holding back is the one suffering you could have avoided.â\n\nâ¦ by Fonzie Kafka\n\n!\n\nThere will never be anything as funny as #FonzieKafka.\n\nBunk: How are you not in jail?\n\nMcNulty: I donât know. The lieâs so big, people can live with it.\n\nBunk canât really respond since he said the same thing in the first scene of the season.\n\nMcNulty yelling at Scott was the most satisfying scene of the season.\n\nMcNulty: You lyin' motherfucker, you're as full of shit as I am. And you gotta live with it and play it out for as long as it goes, right? Trapped in the same lie. Only difference is I know why I did it. But fuck if I can figure out what it gets you, in the end.\n\nBut, hey, I ain't part of your tribe.\n\nScott: You're not serious. You...\n\nMcNulty: No. No, I'm a fucking joke. And so are you. Now get the fuck out of here.\n\nOh, and in case, like me, you didnât know who played this smug little sleazeball, his nameâs Tom McCarthy and he went on to do a few things... like co-write UP, and write, direct and win an Oscar for Spotlight.\n\nð¤¯ð¤©\n\nHerc betraying it all for an Atta boy and a brisket dinner.\n\nJay eulogizes the dead career of âa true murder policeâ, Jimmy McNulty. The wake is so joyous, Jimmy and Lester forgive the one who made it happen in the first place.\n\nWhen the right person makes front page news.\n\n(Look at Bubs!!!)\n\nMichael emerges as the new Omar, even winking after his first theft, while Dukie goes down Bubsâ tragic path. I pray his Walon shows up soon.\n\nAs for the new Marlo? Who else but that little sociopath, Kenard.\n\n(Iâll say it for the hundredth time: this is the most staggeringly talented cast in TV history â like, how is someone this young so brilliant!)\n\nChrisâ life sentence for doing Marloâs bidding seems less bleak when he makes friends with Wee Bey.\n\nThe Feast of the Ascension! At last, Bubbles is welcomed back to the upstairs world and joins his sister and family for dinner. What a stunning and transformative story for a beautiful character.\n\nThe showâs final line: âLetâs go home.â\n\nâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸\n\nThank you forever, @AoDespair, for illuminating the complexity of a city and its inhabitants through your brutally honest and deeply compassionate lens. I checked, and I see youâve already received a MacArthur Genius Grant.\n\nGood.\n\nMy memory of this show will always be intertwined with memories of my mom. She was an elementary school teacher whose students would visit her years later to thank her for believing in them. She volunteered at a shelter for abused women, taught ESL to immigrants...\n\nand indulged a daughter who loved TV. I think sheâd be glad to know that at long last, I discovered the greatest show of all.\n\n@RobertRayWisdom @michaelpottsnyc and all the other brilliant actors I've missed or couldn't find on Twitter. ððð #TheWire @thewirepod\n\nMissing some Tweet in this thread?
