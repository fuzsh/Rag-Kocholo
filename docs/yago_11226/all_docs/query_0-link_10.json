        "text": "If it had ended here, it would have been a good ending, it would have been complete. Everything tied up, everything resolved. Pointers to the future, because if a television series aspires to be anything like realistic it knows that there are no complete endings, that something else is always growing or diminishing, or at any rate yet to be resolved, one way or another. Dennis Wise looked to have lost his boxing gym students for a moment, but he and it carries on. Tommy Carcetti comes out in the open to run for Mayor. But from episode 1 of season 1 to today, it’s wound up, it’s been achieved.\n\nThat’s pretty much the sole purpose of this episode, tying pretty pink bows around everything and showing the aftermath of Stringer Bell’s execution as everything collapses inwards. All change, but at the same time, same as it ever was.\n\nThe open, as Bunk investigates the crime scene with Stringer’s blood-stained body still where it was, featured maybe the most telling scene in the whole series. McNulty’s there, silent, and so is Kima Greggs, but he’s the one who looks like his favourite game has been taken away from him and smashed. He’d won, but Stringer will never know it so it doesn’t count: how can I rise if you don’t fall?\n\nFrom here, so many things fall out. On the wire, everyone, except Avon Barksdale, assumes the hit was ordered by Marlo Stanfield, and thus there must be a war, even if it’s a war over a lie (an allegory for the Iraq War). Avon knows it wasn’t Marlo, that it was him. It was supposed to be business, but Avon hasn’t reckoned with what it really means, within him. What’s the point? But he will play along when the chance arises to smash Marlo, exact retribution.\n\nBut he doesn’t get the chance. From the other half of the parallel lines, ‘Bunny’ Colvin, whose career, reputation and life is going to be wrecked because of Hamsterdam, hands McNulty the address of Avon’s safe house, the one stocked up with arms. Do the Detail have enough for a Warrant? To make sure, Jimmy feeds the name of Colvin’s CI: Russell Bell.\n\nThe War never starts. The raid surrounds the house. Avon knows the game is up, that the choice is between shooting out, which will only get them the satisfaction of taking a few with them, or surrender and return to the system. He thinks he can survive it, but McNulty rubs his nose in Stringer’s betrayal of him, just as he betrayed Stringer. Dog eat Dog. In court, Marlo turns up to – what? gloat? as a mark of respect to his predecessor? Brianna, his sister, d’Angelo’s mother, won’t even look at him, won’t even stay to hear the sentence. The Barksdale organisation is brought down. Only Boadie Broadus gets out from under.\n\nThat’s not quite all but let’s turn our heads to that other parallel line. The Mayor is still trying to work Hamsterdam to his advantage but he who hesitates is lost. The TV stations descend en masse, leaving us to intuit that the tip-off came from someone with the initials TC. The shit hits the fan with a vengeance. All that is left is ducking, weaving, ass-covering and trying the hardest to get out with the least damage. Mayor Royce has waited too long. The Police are given the go-ahead to arrest everyone in sight in Hamsterdam, in Apocalypse Now fashion, down to the Ride of the Valkyries.\n\nOne body is found, OD-ed. It is Bubbles’ ex-protege, Johnny. That night, Hamsterdam is razed to the ground. But out of sight is not out of mind. Royce is going to throw Burrell to the wolves but Burrell will only take the hit on his own terms. The story about the Mayor’s Office’s response will in its detail depend on whether or not he gets confirmation of his permanent elevation to Commissioner. The real shit will all be dumped down on Bunny Colvin’s shoulders: busted down to Lieutenant to deny him his Major’s pension, dismissed, villified in the Press and to everyone, cost his job at Johns Hopkins.\n\nAnd it’s all part of David Simons’ argument that the War on Drugs is a futile war, an unwinnable war that can only be dealt with to the better effect on everyone by treating it as a given, and transformed into a health issue. That’s what Colvin did. Maybe it would work just as well if you practiced it in real life, and I rather think it might, but I still come back to Colvin’s motives. Part of the theme of The Wire, and especially this series, is the self-interest of authority versus the dedication of those actually exposed to the reality, but Colvin’s motives were never ‘pure’, he just wanted convenience for himself and his District, that’s why he started it. What happened after he stepped down was nothing to him.\n\nColvin got crushed. It probably wasn’t the show’s intention but honesty shone through irregardless, and you can’t escape the sense that he got what he deserved, or what he turned a blind eye to, thinking he could just walk away.\n\nRipples. There’s a vacancy for a Major: Daniels gets it and gets the Western District. His estranged wife is added to the Mayor’s ticket so his support is no longer necessary and he can go public with Rhonda Pearlman, yes and screw her vigorously too, just as we earlier got to see Kima enthusiastically getting it on with her wife.\n\nWe’re settling for it. This is everyone’s rewards and desserts. Bunk, the practical joker, who cuts off the ties of detectives asleep at their desks and displays them on a trophy board, falls asleep and has his cut off. Herc gets back to busting heads. And Jimmy?\n\nMcNulty’s had his own wires cut, the ones attached to the puppet-master’s controls. Daniels won’t have him in the Detail any longer becase he can’t trust him but McNulty’s ahead of him. Not to win, but to step back. McNulty thinks that the things that make him a good Police are the things that make him impossible. He’s been round to talk to Beadie Russell, not to get into her pants though he could have done, but to begin the process of building a life. He wants to go back to the Western. He voluntarily busts himself down to patrolman. We could leave him here and, if we were of a particularly sunny dispoition today, we could imagine him finally starting to grow up. We’d have to be bloody naive to do so, but if this were the last episode, which it finally turned out not to be, we might just have been able to con ourselves.\n\nLet’s prepare ourselves to leap two years in seven days. Season 4 awaits.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHow does it end? Look at the photo above. It ends as we expected it to end, as it started, a long way from where it started and not ending at all. It ends with a floating body being pulled in at the Port, only this time it’s Frank Sobotka, which we knew it would be: not just dead but dead viciously, stabbed multiple times and his throat cut.\n\nAnd we watch it all fall out in every direction. The Detail once again comes up short, betrayed this time by the FBI, as Fitzhugh shame-facedly admits to Daniels. It’s investigation ends as Spiros and the Greek, at their leisure, leave the country. They will resume business, always business, elsewhere. His name is not Spiros and he isn’t even Greek.\n\nThe operation is shut down. New faces will contact Proposition Joe in a week or so. Stringer Bell is suddenly playing too many ends against the middle. Brother Mouzone has voided Avon’s contract (Michael Potts has played only a minor role but he was astounding) and will resolve the matter his way. Avon reluctantly accepts sharing with Prop Joe, but only until he’s out: there is a rift between him and Stringer now.\n\nNicky Sobotka, led by his father. comes in and gives evidence. The FBI have got what they want, the chance to de-legitimise the Union, when Ott removes himself from the election and Frank is re-elected. The Grain Pier is dead. The Port shrinks even further.\n\nHerc and Carver are overlooked: both fume but Herc gets out, going for a sergeant’s post in the Western District under Major Colvin, where we’ll see him starting next week in season 3. Prez will undergo humiliating penance from his nasty little fuck of a father-in-law but Daniels has got him off the more horrific fuck Valchek had planned for him. Kima’s wife is now heavily-pregnancy: Kima’s considering what a child will mean. McNulty’s cosying up to Pearlman again, despite the glances Beadie is making his way. She’s back to her car with the Port Police.\n\nThere’s one ray of light and it’s the least important, except to Bunk, Landsman and Rawls: Bunk and Beadie find the lever to get Sergei to talk: that’s fourteen bodies converted from red to black on the Board: clearance is up.\n\nNobody won though, because nobody wins. The Game goes on. Next, we’ll concentrate a bit more closely on that again. The Docks is done, we won’t be back here again. It’s the anomaly season, but it’s not the worst one unlike most people’s opinion. It showed us a side of life in the United States that hasn’t got any better since.\n\n‘Port in a Storm’ was directed by the show’s Executive Producer, Robert F Colesberry, who also played the minor role of Detective Ray Cole. It was his last contribution, for he would die of a heart attack before Season 3. Everybody missed him.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAnd now we are here, where we’ve been heading to all these weeks past.\n\nIt’s done, and everything collapses inwards. The Detail and the FBI got the warrants but the raids were too late. All the evidence was gone. Still, Major Valchek, the loathsome pig, was satisfied because the FBI busted Frank Sobotka at the Union, the better for publicity and for petty revenge than taking him at home. Only Nicky, whose parents’ home is raided and heroin and money found, remains at large.\n\nNicky, and Vondopolous, that is. He’s been left on the street in order that he can lead them upwards. There’s a long, calm yet tense sequence in which he’s tailed by the Police, with Beadie Russell on point, that leads to a hotel room and a meting with a suit no-one can identify. No-one pays any attention to the old guy with the hat and the moustache who seems to have just happened to get into the photograph at the same time.\n\nElsewhere, Omar has his parlay with Stringer Bell. Stringer diverts Omar’s intentions of revenge on all those who brutally killed his boy Brandon onto Brother Mouzone. Omar plots, he takes Mouzone unawares in his motel, shoots him through the stomach. Mouzone accepts it, it’s the Game. But torture is not his style: Omar has been misinformed. Mouzone is not lying, we know that, Omar knows it too. Instead of a second bullet, he phones 911, reports a shooting. That’s it for the Barksdale crew this week, a mere appendage. But not forever.\n\nBecause this is about Frank Sobotka, about how doing wrong with good intentions is still touching pitch and being defiled. Sobotka’s deals have completely fucked over the union and they’ve fucked over his family, not just his neglected son but also his brother’s son. Louis Sobotka, Nicky’s father, says it plain and hard, understanding more of human frailty than his obsessed younger brother. He showed Nicky a door: did he not think he would walk through it?\n\nIt’s all over now, but there’s still more to be done. The Greek is set on clearing up, removing anyone who can cause them harm. Spiros has a soft spot for Nicky (early on, when McNulty points out the Greeks invented Civilization, Bunk claims they also invented ass-fucking: we take that as far as we see it). They can ease things for the Sobotkas, all they want is loyalty.\n\nBut Beadie, watching a drug dealer get a deal, suggests offering one to Frank. She brings him in. She genuinely likes him, just as he genuinely lkes her. Save for the Union, Frank will tell all. All he’s got to do is come back tomorrow with a Lawyer. There are, however, two doors. The Police or the Greek. Frank’s leaning towrds Door A, but he’ll listen to what Door B has to offer. A meet with the Greek under the Bridge, on his own.\n\nAnd for once The Wire indulges in a piece of pure network television, alternating the steps of Frank Sobotka to his meeting a long way from anyone else with the progress of an internal FBI report on his meeting to tell all until it ends up on the screen of a certain Greek Agent, who immediately dials a number. The Greek turns to Spiros. “Your way,” he says, “it will not work.”\n\nAnd we are where we have been travelling to all these many weeks.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nNo change of tempo, no change of style, but coming out of left-field is the thing that starts the collapse inwards, and wouldn’t you know it? It’s Ziggy. Fucking Ziggy.\n\nThe stupid little asshole is a stupid little asshole to the end. Cocky, thinks he’s king of the world. Steals the cars as agreed with Glekas. Does everything he can to blow things because he can’t get it into his tiny little head that he’s a fool. Nobody takes him seriously because he isn’t worth taking seriously for half a second. So Glekas feels safe, and justified, in stiffing him for 50% of the agreed fee, and kicking him out when Ziggy kicks off about it. Until he walks back in with a gun, shoots a clerk in the belly to bleed out, shoots Glekas two or three times, then finishes him off.\n\nAnd goes back to his car to cry because this time… Arrest, confession. But he still has to alter his confession to make himself look bigger. No loss. none whatsoever, whatever the effect on Frank, on Nicky.\n\nBut the real catalyst comes from elsewhere. Major Stan Valchek, poison gnome, ignorant, small-minded little fucker, is pissed off that he’s not getting his way over Frank Sobotka, stamping his widdle foot in rage and taking it to the FBI, who are interested in Union Corruption. Only… the FBI move in to share with the Detail, ecognise the scale and scope, the two agencies collaborate, the strings start to be pulled tighter.\n\nThis has two effects. We start with Prez in the open, building up the picture, connecting all the photos, showing the web, content in his job, fascinated, grown-up, his metier found. Enter the poison gnome, full of outrage that the FBI aren’t dancing to his strings either. Prez is Roland, Valchek’s Division, his son-in-law. He orders him out. It’s the destruction of everything Prez has become. inarticulate, punches his father-in-law, his Commanding Officer, in the face. No more than he deserves, we’d all have done it, but that’s the end for him. The promise, the potential, gone on a pig-headed, small-minded tyrant’s whim.\n\nI’ll come back to the other. Meanwhile, the Barksdale Crew’s got good shit again, really good shit, at the price of letting them East Side niggers (I am quoting, to be accurate, rather than avoid the word I loathe but which the series uses with authentic abandon) onto their turf. Boadie bristles but Stringer tells him to leave them be. But that’s not what Brother Mouzone is about. He’s calm, he’s quiet, he’s polite, he doesn’t raise his voice but he doesn’t need to. He’s America’s nightmare, a nigger with a library card. Proposition Joe won’t go up against him. But at Stringer Bell’s word he’s trying to get a parley set up between String and Omar…\n\nAnd the other effect of Valchek bringing the FBI into this is an FBI agent in the pay of the Greek. The joint FBI/Detail operation is laid out. The Greek, via Spiros, sets everyone into shut down mode. Even as the Detail furiously type Affidavits to get them Search Warrants on the Warehouse and Glekas’s store, the places are being stripped and half a ton on heroin is being hosed down the drain…\n\nThe shit has hit the fan. Watch out for the spray.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt’s the same thing, still. As it has been every week so far, little pieces of story, moving at their own paces, people’s tales. Different aims, different ends. Yet, almost imperceptibly, there’s a sense of things starting to come together, to fall into place in a pattern we can’t yet see, or rather a pattern every one of us has to construct in their own mind, everyone forging a different shape.\n\nThere was much more from the Barksdale Crew this week, what’s going on with them trying to hold their position in the face of a boss in prison, a lieutenant having to take decisions, a weak shit product and a muscle either dead or in jail. And an avalanche starts in the crudest possible fashion, in an open where Boadie leads an attempt to re-take corners, resulting in a shoot-out, wild and ragged, bullets everywhere and the only victim an innocent: a nine year old boy.\n\nThe shit cascades downhill from there. Stringer calls out Boadie for his stupidity, which is compounded when, under Stringer’s instructions, he collects all the guns and slings them off the bridge into the Harbour. Not in the water though, onto a barge from where the Police easily retrieve them. Stringer sees no other business option: he reaches a deal with Proposition Joe, his connection in exchange for three of the Towers. But not even Brianna can sell it to Avon. It’s war or nothing. And Avon brings in muscle, highly-feared muscle, Brother Mouzone, from New York. No-one wants to tangle with the Brother (Malcolm Potts), especially not Proposition Joe. His arrival is the closing note, a small, neat, well-dressed young man with glasses, in a black suit, white shirt and grey bow-tie, excessively polite. Oh shit.\n\nBefore that, and engaged in this part of the story we meet Western District Commander Howard ‘Bunny’ Colvin (Robert Wisdom) with whom we’re going to become very familiar in season 3, together with his uncredited Lieutenant Dennis Mello, a natural born cynic.\n\nAnd here’s where the fun gets really fun because remember that Delaney Williams is playing Sergeant Jay Landsman, a real life cop from Homicide: A Year on the Killing Street? Lieutenant Mello is being played by Jay Landsman, the cop. Trippy, huh?\n\nI’ve concentrated so far on one half on the ongoing story but this season has more than just two halves. The Greek has shut down operations, suspecting the Detail. They have to stay cool. Staying cool includes a raid on the brothel with all the East European women. Who’s going undercover as the John? Who but McNulty?\n\nBut McNulty’s turned to his FBI chum Fitzhugh for any info they’ve got on the suspiciously clean characters they’re up on. One of them, Glekas, was pulled in in San Diego back in 1995. The Greek Agent who dealt with him reports it was a nothing. But he’s in the pay of the Greek. Wheels start to turn further in wheels. The asshole Ziggy, pissed off that no-one in human history will ever take him seriously, nor sympathise about his duck dying from alcohol poisoning, is running his own scam with Glekas, supplying stolen luxury cars for export. Nicky’s settling into his small but steady drugs connection. Frank Sobotka’s got $4.5 million for the Harbour. He wants one more year to bring in the dredging but Ott won’t shift – it’s the blacks’ turn.\n\nOnly Frank doesn’t know that the Greek has rewarded his San Diego Agent with a tip that scores mega-big at the dock, pure crack cocaine, worth billions, disguised as paint pigment chips! Things are starting to fall into each other.\n\nOnly there’s a potentially very disrupting fly about to get itself into the ointment. Major Stan Valchek. Pig-headed, ignorant, small-brained and fucking stupid. It’s his Detail, his, but they’ve pissed on him. It’s gotten bigger, more important, it’s target is not Frank Sobotka alone, and Valchek can’t see past the end of his piggy little nose. He’s not going to just sit there and take it, is he now?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThough still a good episode, I find it very difficult to have anything to say aout this week’s instalment of The Wire. Things moved forward, sometimes in very important ways, but the show’s rigid groundedness served to minimise such steps, and the lack of any emphasis upon them more or less disappeared them into the less significant moments.\n\nThis was a week in which the ongoing issues for the Barksdale Crew more or less disappeared into the background: no Stringer, no Avon, just scenes cutting to and from Boadie and Poot, a reminder that the shit is still weak, a confrontation with an outside gang looking to take over a corner or two that promises future violence, but that was it.\n\nInstead, we concentrated upon the Detail, and upon Frank Sobotka and the Greek’s organisation. Things are nicely balanced. Two-thirds of the way in the Detail finally gets its wiretap, but just as it does a couple of little things trigger Sobotka’s paranoia. Firstly, he discovered that his overdue cellphone bill is flagged Do Not Disconnect. Then he discovers Beadie Russell is detailed to the City Police, not working some other terminal as she told him. Frank fears they’re being watched. To test his theory he holds back a can due to disappear and sends a clean one through the system: the Detail’s response further fuels his suspicions and he demands, and gets, an actual meeting with the Greek. Where the seeds are sewn of what is to come when, with the Union’s needs in mind, he insists on still being paid during the proposed period when the system is being tested. Not good, not good.\n\nThe same must be said of the enfent terrible (i.e., bloody awful kid) Ziggy. Ziggy’s got money but he hasn’t got respect. That he deserves none at all doesn’t remotely near let alone cross his pea-sized brain. He buys a duck whose wngs are clipped so it can’t fly away, takes it down the bar, lets it drink alcohol to its heart’s content. One imdb reviewer calls this symbolism, of how ordinary people’s lives are controlled, their wings clipped so they can’t do their thing, which is an interesting and probably true theory: I just thought it was Ziggy being an asshole. He’s going to do something stupid. I mean, everything he does is something stupid, but he’s going to do something so stupid he won’t be able to walk back from. You can see it coming.\n\nThe other element is McNulty. He’s getting nowhere getting back with Elena, so he goes on a massive drinking spree, smashes up his car, once drunkenly, once deliberately, and screws a waitress in an all-night diner. He even admits to Bunk that without Elena, without policing, he’s nothing. So Bunk goes to bat with Daniels, and Daniels with Rawls, none of them being unrealistic about McNulty’s character, and the upshot is he’s off the boats and into the Detail. Just in time to be typecast as the John going undercover into the cathouse for the East European girls when they’re not dancing in titty-bars…\n\nFurther on. Still not in sight. Mosaics and kaleidoscopes. The Wire.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nStill inching forward.\n\nThe episode title refers to d’Angelo’s death last week, and the ripples it is causing. There was a strange and, in its way, touching open as Boadie visited a flower shop to arrange a tribute for the funeral, waxing philosophic about the respect due a colleague, a fellow nigga, someone he didn’t really respect but whose passing had nevertheless affected him in ways he couldn’t have explained to himself. A masterpiece of writing and a superb performance by J D Williams.\n\nThat Dee committed suicide has been accepted by all and only Stringer Bell and his hired DC gangster know different. The Wire was Idris Elba’s deserved breakthrough, but I’ve had little cause to praise him so far. Stringer is the perfect lieutenant and brother: solid, reliable, impassive whatever the circumstances. He is the rock. And now he’s hiding a secret that would get him killed if it came out, killed without a thought. We can see it but only in the tiniest degree and only because we know, and we can see why no-one in the least bit suspects because there is nothing to suspect: Stringer Bell is Stringer Bell.\n\nBut things are not going well for the Barksdale gang. The shit is weak, very weak. They losing ground. Proposition Joe attends the funeral to pay his respects but mainly to put a proposition to Stringer: he got the product, Avon got the territory, a shift would work for both. Avon will not give ground, neither physically nor metaphorically.\n\nAnd we, and the Detail, make the connection just before the end. Proposition Joe’s supplier is the Greek. A corner is turned.\n\nDaniels will still not accept Bunk’s fourteen unsolved homicides, despite all Rawls’ cajoling. In the end, seeing the case as bigger than his determination to get himself out of the basement, back into being real Police, the job he loves, he takes the lot: what the Detail is building towards is big enough to swallow the uncleared cases when it comes off.\n\nFreamon talks him into it, with his usual intelligence, his natural feel and his disgust for what was done to the dead girls. Daniels demands a free hand from Rawls, anything he wants by way of resources. We know who that’s going to mean, absent from the episode until almost the end, talking to Elena, trying to get her back, and she, being honest about the ambivalence of her feelings, the ongoing attraction versus the unanswerable appeal: how can I ever trust you again?\n\nFreamon once again is attuned to the case. He’s developing a sense for how the dockyard container computer works and identifies when the next container will vanish. With Beadie, Greggs, Prez and Bunk working seamless surveillance, the container vanishes in real time and goes to a warehouse. So too, late on, does Proposition Joe. The two sides are beginning to converge.\n\nNicky’s doing well. He’s profiting from his little share of the drug trade, enough to feel good and promise good to his girl. He doesn’t know that the chuckle brothers, Herc and Carver, have got his name and licence plate.\n\nAnd the Docks. Elections are coming up. The deal was fixed last year: Frank Sobotka is secretary this year, he hands off to Art for next year. Polacks and Blacks. Simple alternation. But Frank wants to stay on, see through his plan. The Port has got to survive, the Canal has got to be dredged, robotics and computers are coming in that will further erode the stevedore’s profession, he’s fighting for the future to be the same as the past. He’s got money: for his campaigner, whose family saw the future as leaving the past, for the wife of a stevedore whose leg is crushed by a fallen packing case. Frank’s passionate, but finally we are starting to get the sense that he is a tragedy waiting to happen, that his battle is so far uphill it might as well be Everest.\n\nThat’s what the world is. But the world also does nothing for those who progress leaves behind. That’s what season 2 is about, as well as the backwash from season 1 and the ineffectual War on Drugs. Find your own future or, if your past incapacitates you from doing so, fuck off and die.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAs I said about the first episode, season 2 of The Wire is in most fans eyes the least well-regarded (though I will have my say upon that question when the time comes). This opinion arises from the overpowering change of direction the season represents, the abrupt shift from the Drugs scene to the Docks, the sudden arrival of a new cast group who will play no part in later seasons, the sense of a temporary intrusion in a longer story that takes it out of character.\n\nAll of these things are in themselves accurate criticisms, though the story that is being told in season 2 is a powerful and very valid one. And it’s tempered by the ongoing repercussions of season 1 as it affects the Barksdale Crew, winding through the story, given time but more of a background aspect.\n\nWith episode 6, we’re halfway through the series, we’re still pointing in different directions, we haven’t begun to converge but, in its different scenes, its moments and momentous changes, I think this is one of the strongest episodes in the entires series, especially in its ending, which only the ultra percipient would honestly have seen coming.\n\nWhat we have now is four different threads. The most prominent one is the trial of Bird for the murder of William Gant in season 1, before Judge Phelan, chief witness Omar Little. This is a gas, a classic, a tour de force by Michael K Williams, especially when being confronted by the slimy lawyer Morris Levy. Omar is Omar in every glorious inch of him, completely open about who and what he is, a guy who rips-and-runs, i.e., someone who robs drugs gangs of their stash and profits. He’s brilliantly unashamed of it, which is doubly wonderful since he’s actually lying through his teeth about Bird, to fit him up, but the showstopper moment is when Levy, thinking he’s delivering the unanswerable put-down, anatomises Omar as someone who would knowingly and unashamedly lie, only for Omar to turn it back on him in an instant by pointing out that he’s no different than Levy: he do it with a gun, Levy with a briefcase. I was still a solicitor when I first saw that and you’d better believe how long I howled with laughter at that line.\n\nWhich scene bled over into McNulty’s strand. Gant was his last case from Homicide. Looking to the future he’s giving up the thought of being a murder police. He’s turning himself around. He’ll settle for the boats, he gives up trying to identify the floater, he wants another chance with his estranged wife Elena. He’s gonna give up the booze and the one-night stands. All it gets him so far is a very cagey meal and a one-night stand with Elena, a fuck for the road, that he thinks is the pathway to his second chance, only she wants him gone before the boys get back from their sitter.\n\nMeanwhile, the Detail is picking up momentum. The Union very clearly has more money that it should from legitimate means. We know that, we know where it’s coming from, and we know that none of it is going into Frank Sobotka’s hands or pockets, it’s for the Union, for the Port, for its future. In a way, it’s noble. With an idea from Beadie Russell, slowly turning into a detective, she and Lester track down a pattern of containers unloading and vanishing: same line, same checker every time. And Kima, with her suspicious wife and the clearly-embarrassed Prez, goes checking out a connection willing to talk about foreign girls dancing in Baltimore Clubs. They work where Kima and Co are getting their information: in titty-bars.\n\nFrank’s not the only one getting closely involved with the Greek. Nicky organises not just the chemicals Spiros wants but gets his cousion Ziggy out of the hole over his problems with Cheese – who turns out to not only be working for Proposition Joe but to be his nephew. Ziggy comes out with his skin unthreatened, and $2,400, and immediately lights a cigarette with a burning $100 bill. Jackass.\n\nBut whilst all this is going on, wheels are turning within wheels. Stringer Bell goes outside Baltimore to request something from a Washington crew: what, we don’t know. Inside, d’Angelo is getting ever more distant, wanting only to be let be. He flushes what’s left of the drugs he’s been taking. He snubs his Uncle in a corridor. He pushes away his Mom on a visit, wanting to be completely outside, detached from the organisation, the Game, his family. He will do his twenty on his own.\n\nBut he won’t. In a book club he analyses The Great Gatsby, seeing it as the story of a man who tried to pretend he had changed but hadn’t really done so because he was what his past had set him up to be. The prescient, and I was not one of them until this time when I knew what was happening, understood that analysis, which was worth the hearing anyway for the insight it had into a classic novel. Then this guy, this anonymous con, follows Dee into a back room in the Library, slips a belt around his neck and strangles him, leaving the scene arranged to make it look like a suicide. Stringer’s mission fulfilled,. Those who are not with us… You brought your own explanations to it, and you remembered The Great Gatsby.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHow do you review a single chapter from the middle of a novel?\n\nIt’s easy enough if you’re talking about something standalone and exceptional, such as the ‘Piper at the Gates of Dawn’ chapter in The Wind in the Willows but in the kind of novel The Wire is, where the standalones are the moments and they only threads anyway, it’s sometimes impossible without resorting simply to listing what happens, at which point I’d be doing better to tell you to buy the boxset and watch it yourself.\n\nWhat happened this week? Many things. Where are we now? Further forward. Is this coalescing yet? Only incrementally.\n\nThe open was a gem. Ziggy’s going into drugs. He’s a fuck-up, the fuck-up’s fuck-up. He gets burned by his dealer, a white boy named Frog, aping gangster style. He gets beaten by his supplier, Cheese, who takes his money, disrespects his shiny leather coat, takes his car and gives him till Friday to pay $2,700 he hasn’t got, or on Saturday he’s dead. He’s all boastful hard man and snivelling victim in every second, and we get his signature line, the one we know he’ll use every day of his life, ‘it ain’t my fault’. Everybody else in the entire population of the world knows otherwise.\n\nZiggy’s not the only one having problems with the Game. The Barksdale organisation is getting weaker and weaker shit, the slingers and the fiends are complaining, their grip is in serious danger of slipping. Stringer’s using his business school tutor for ideas on how to turn the business round (which is hilarious). But Dee’s getting ever more detached, seeing through this family love bullshit that Darlene still buys into when she visits, talking a future outside the Game, legit, being readied for him when he gets out.\n\nAnd Omar’s in touch with McNulty, preparing in his inimitable way, to give testimony. I am so looking forward to watching that again.\n\nMeanwhile, the Detail starts to operate. It gains another alumnus, temporarily at least, Detective Freamon being assigned for the duration, leaving the Bunk to carry fourteen red names on his own. Sub poenas drag the stevedores off to Grand Juries, not that that phases the Baltimore Port Unions (technical adviosor Major Gary D’Addario, the real life Giardello of Homicide: Life on the Street, has a one-line cameo, confessing wearily that they’ve just got one of the stevedores to admit that the Port is near the water).\n\nBeadie Russell uses her gentle wiles to charm an old but disappointed flame to clue her in to the fact that all the unloading details for the container holding the dead girls are in the computer system. Frank Sobotka compliantly explains just how many ways the system can glitch without a single sinister motive.\n\nMcNulty’s driving up to Jersey City still trying to put a name and a family to his dead floater.\n\nCarver’s welcome back in the Detail. He can’t understand why but Daniels assesses that the son of a bitch snitch last time will be the last to snitch this time. Carver appreciates that. His Sergeantcy means nothing here, he and Herc are under Greggs’ leadership: cavaliers reunited!\n\nIt’s going all over the place but you know the threads are part of a pattern, that they’re leading somewhere. Frank Sobotka wants to meet the Greek himself, wants a temporary shutdown till the heat cools. The Greek won’t meet, the money will talk for him. He sends Spiros, and Frank flares up, cuts off completely. But the Greek still wants the three containers of chemicals for producing drugs. He tells Nicky he will pay triple rates for each one. Nicky tells Frank. The money talks.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIf you wanted to summarise The Wire‘s second season, you would watch the open to this episode. Plot-wise, Frank Sobotka summons his nephew Nick to call him out for the theft of the cameras last week, and order them brought back, which Nick explains he can’t do because they’ve already been sold. Frank’s angry that thefts like that further harm the future of the Port and its workers, if they are not efficient and reliable. Nick explains that he can’t survive on five to six days work a month. There you have it.\n\nBut The Wire is never not about multiple things. It was one of the first series to be descrbed as a novel on television and it displays the characteristics of a novel, with its multiple viewpoints, concerns and characters. This is episode 4, a third of the way through, and it’s taken until now for the Detail to be resurrected, the old gang, reassembled: Lt Daniels to lead, Kima Greggs, Herc, Prez, Carver (offscreen), but not McNulty: Rawls will not agree it.\n\nThe Detail’s done nothing yet. To get Daniels to postpone quitting the Police, Burrell has had to promise him the forthcoming Major’s position, that the Detail become permanant, a Major Crimes Unit and his choice of staff, subject to Rawls’ approval, they being CID and coming under his direction: anyone he wants except McNulty, who will only get off the boats if he quits or drowns. Just wait.\n\nThe Detail doesn’t know what it’s supposed to be doing, except it’s part of a pissing match between two Polacks, but it’s glad to be back together and do serious work, even if they have to make it for themselves. On the other hand, two wives are unhappy: Marla Daniels, at Cedric not leaving the Police to become a lawyer, Greggs’ wife the same thing (that women is seriously pissed at Greggs not doing what she’s told).\n\nOf course, Freamon’s not available because he’s in Homicide, partnered with The Bunk on a case of thirteen, maybe fourteen Jane Doe’s, wth Rawls expressing a fact that if these deaths don’t get solved, he’s not looking afield for scapegoats. Bunk’s on McNulty’s ass over producing Omar. Jimmy lies about having him in his pocket. Jimmy’s got a lot on his plate, like finding Omar, for which he coerces Bubbles, Andre Royo coming onscreen at last, like his obsession with tracking down one of the dead girls, putting a name to the face, and a home and family, like trying to get back with his wife, Elena (you know it’s a mistake, girl).\n\nBut the season is still broadening. Ziggy Sobotka’s being a total fuck-up, it being his natural state of existence, over the cash they’ve made, eager to resume being the worst kind of criminal in the world, whilst Nicky is torn between the appeal of the money, and a place to live with his girl and their daughter, and his Uncle’s words. And in prison, five men have died from heroin cut with strychnine and eight more in the infirmary. Avon Barksdale wants d’Angelo to go in with the information that will identify Tilghman, that will shave years off Dee’s sentence. But Dee wants no more of it, wants to be left out, left alone. So Avon does the deal, Tilghman is framed, goes down. There will be consequences.\n\nBunk and Lester, left in no doubt that this is a thirteen-sided case they gotta solve, start making their presence felt, ineffectually, down at the Docks, where no-one will talk to Police any more than the corner boys will. They make Frank Sobotka nervous just by being there. That’s before they tell him that the dead girls weren’t an accident, a safe, comfortable, morally neutral accident, but murder. Frank throws up in a toilet sink, looks at himself in the mirror. But he’s not going to be able to escape from his involvement any more than he can escape from his reflection…\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
