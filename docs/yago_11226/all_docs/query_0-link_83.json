Most of the guys up here couldn’t catch the clap in a Mexican whorehouse.[to Bunk]\n\nWhat kind of detective would I be if I couldn’t track a white woman in Baltimore, right?\n\nThey can chew you up, but they gotta spit you back out.\n\nThere were two of them. I was outnumbered.[about the two hookers in the sting operation]\n\nLying to the wife’s easy. It’s looking your kid in the eye that’s the hard part.\n\nLet’s go home.[the last line of the series]\n\nI wonder what it feels like to work in a real f***ing police department."
