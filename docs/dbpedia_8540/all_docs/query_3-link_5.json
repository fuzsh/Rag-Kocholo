        "text": "What Is the Digestive System?\n\nThe digestive system breaks down the food we eat into tiny parts to give us fuel and the nutrients we need to live. As food breaks down, we get amino acids from protein, simple sugars from starches, and fatty acids and glycerol from fats.\n\nWhat Are the Parts of the Digestive System?\n\nThe digestive system is made up of:\n\nthe alimentary canal (also called the digestive tract). This long tube of organs makes a pathway for food to travel through the body. It runs from the mouth to the anus (where poop comes out) and includes the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. An adult's digestive tract is about 30 feet (about 9 meters) long.\n\nother organs that help the process by adding enzymes and chemicals to break down the food. Important organs that help with digestion include the salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nThe digestive system consists of the parts of the body that work together to turn food and liquids into the building blocks and fuel that the body needs.\n\nClick through this slideshow to learn more about the digestive system.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nMouth\n\nThe mouth is where the digestive tract begins. Enzymes released into the mouth start the process of digestion.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nEpiglottis\n\nThe epiglottis is a small piece of tissue that covers the opening of the larynx.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nGallbladder\n\nThe gallbladder is a small pouch that stores bile. The gallbladder release bile into the duodenum to help digest fats in the food you eat.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nSmall Intestine\n\nThe small intestine is called small because of its width, not its length. It's actually much longer than the large intestine. The small and large intestines form one continuous tube.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nDuodenum\n\nThe word duodeni is Latin and means \"12 each.\" The duodenum, the first part of the small intestine, was thought to be as long as the width of 12 fingers.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nJejunum\n\nThe jejunum, the middle section of the small intestine, is about 5 to 8 feet (1.5 to 2.5 meters) long.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nIleum\n\nThe ileum is the third and final section of the small intestine. It's also the longest, measuring 16 to 20 feet (5 to 6 meters) long.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nAppendix\n\nThe appendix is attached to the cecum. If it becomes inflamed, this is called appendicitis.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nPharynx\n\nBecause both food and air move through it, the pharynx is part of both the respiratory and digestive systems.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nEsophagus\n\nThe esophagus is a soft, muscular tube that moves food from the pharynx to the stomach.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nLiver\n\nThe liver is the body's largest internal organ. The liver performs many tasks, including storing energy and helping the body get rid of toxins.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nStomach\n\nThe stomach has a tough lining. It's able to hold up in the highly acidic environment needed to break down food.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nPancreas\n\nThe pancreas makes hormones (including insulin) to regulate the blood glucose level. It also makes enzymes that break down food in the intestines.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nLarge Intestine\n\nThe large intestine consists of three parts: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nCecum\n\nThe cecum is the pouch‑like beginning of the large intestine.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nColon\n\nThe colon is the largest part of the large intestine and has three parts: the ascending colon, the transverse colon, and the descending colon.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nRectum\n\nThe rectum is the final 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) of the large intestine. It stores stool (poop) until it leaves the body.\n\nThe Digestive System\n\nAnus\n\nThe anus marks the exit point of the digestive tract; it's where poop leaves the body.\n\nHow Does the Digestion System Work?\n\nHere’s how digestion happens:\n\nThe mouth: Digestion begins even before we taste food. When we see, smell, taste, or even imagine a tasty meal, our salivary glands (located in front of the ears, under the tongue, and near the lower jaw) begin making saliva (spit).\n\nTeeth tear and chop the food. Spit moistens it for easy swallowing. A digestive enzyme in saliva called amylase (AH-meh-lace) starts to break down some carbohydrates (starches and sugars) in the food.\n\nMuscles in the tongue and mouth work together to swallow the food and move it into the throat (pharynx). The pharynx (FAIR-inks) is a passageway for food and air. A soft flap of tissue called the epiglottis (ep-ih-GLAH-tus) closes over the windpipe when we swallow to keep food and liquid out of the lungs.\n\nThe esophagus: Food travels down a muscular tube in the chest called the esophagus (ih-SAH-fuh-gus). Waves of muscle contractions called peristalsis (per-uh-STALL-sus) force food down through the esophagus to the stomach. A person usually isn't aware of the muscle movements that push food through the digestive tract.\n\nThe stomach: At the end of the esophagus is a muscular ring or valve called a sphincter (SFINK-ter). The sphincter lets food enter the stomach, then squeezes shut to keep food and liquids from flowing back up into the esophagus. The stomach muscles churn and mix the food with digestive juices that have acids and enzymes. These juices help break up food into much smaller pieces.\n\nBy the time food is ready to leave the stomach, it has been turned into a thick liquid called chyme (kime). A small muscular valve called the pylorus (pie-LOR-is) controls when chyme is released into the small intestine.\n\nThe small intestine: The small intestine is where many nutrients (like protein, carbohydrates, and fats) get absorbed into the bloodstream. It has three parts:\n\nThe duodenum (due-uh-DEE-num). This C-shaped first part is where enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver are added to the chyme.\n\nThe jejunum (jih-JU-num). This coiled middle part further digests the chyme and absorbs nutrients.\n\nThe ileum (IH-lee-um). The final section that leads into the large intestine absorbs nutrients, vitamin B12, and bile acids.\n\nMillions of microscopic, finger-like projections called villi (VIH-lie) line the inside of the small intestine. The villi make lots of surface area for nutrients to get absorbed into the blood. Then blood brings the nutrients to the rest of the body.\n\nWhile food works its way through the small intestine, three organs that are not part of the alimentary canal help the digestion process:\n\nThe liver makes bile, which helps the body absorb fat. It’s located in the top right of the belly.\n\nThe gallbladder stores bile until it is needed. It’s hidden just below the liver.\n\nThe pancreas makes enzymes that help digest proteins, fats, and carbs. It’s found below the stomach.\n\nEnzymes and bile travel through small pathways (called ducts) into the small intestine, where they help to break down food.\n\nUndigested food and some water travels to the large intestine through a muscular ring called the ileocecal (ill-ee-oh-SEE-kul) valve. This valve prevents food from returning to the small intestine. By the time food reaches the large intestine, the work of absorbing nutrients is nearly finished.\n\nThe large intestine: The large intestine's main job is to remove water from the undigested matter and form solid waste (poop) to be excreted. The large intestine includes three parts:\n\nThe cecum (SEE-kum) is the beginning of the large intestine. The appendix is a small, hollow, finger-like pouch that hangs off the end of the cecum. Doctors believe the appendix is left over from an earlier time in human evolution. Today it’s no longer needed to help with digestion.\n\nThe colon extends from the cecum up the right side of the abdomen (the ascending colon), across the upper abdomen (transverse colon), and down the left side of the abdomen (descending colon). Then it connects to the rectum.\n\nThe rectum is where poop is stored until it leaves the digestive system through the anus as a bowel movement.\n\nIt can take days for food to fully pass through the digestive system.\n\nMedically reviewed by:"
