        "text": "The small intestine is also called the small bowel. It is a hollow, tube-like organ that is connected to the stomach on one end and the large intestine on the other. The small intestine is the longest part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and makes up about three-quarters of the digestive system.\n\nThe GI tract is a tube that goes from the mouth to the anus. The esophagus carries food from the mouth and throat to the stomach. The stomach receives food from the esophagus, starts the digestive process and empties partly digested food into the small intestine. The small intestine continues digestion and absorbs nutrients. The large intestine absorbs water from partly digested food, forms it into stool and stores it until it is passed out of the body with a bowel movement.\n\nSeveral other organs of the digestive system help to digest food, including the liver, gallbladder and pancreas.\n\nThe small intestine is about 4.75–6 m (15–20 ft) long. It has an average diameter of 2.5 cm (1 in). It is looped and coiled and fills up much of the abdominal cavity (the space in the abdomen that contains the intestines and other organs). The small intestine is made up of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. It is covered by mesentery."
