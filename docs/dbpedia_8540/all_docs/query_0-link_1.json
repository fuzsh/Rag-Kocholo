        "text": "Description\n\nThe large intestine (or large bowel) is the last part of the digestive system.\n\nThe large intestine consists of the cecum, colon, rectum and anal canal. It starts in the right iliac region of the pelvis, just at or below the right waist, where it is joined to the bottom end of the small intestine. From here it continues up the abdomen, then across the width of the abdominal cavity, and then it turns down, continuing to its endpoint at the anus.\n\nThe large intestine is about 4.9 feet (1.5 m) long, which is about one-fifth of the whole length of the intestinal canal.\n\nFunction\n\nThe large intestine takes about 16 hours to finish the digestion of the food. It removes water and any remaining absorbable nutrients from the food before sending the indigestible matter to the liver. The colon absorbs vitamins which are created by the colonic bacteria - such as vitamin K (especially important as the daily ingestion of vitamin K is not normally enough to maintain adequate blood coagulation), vitamin B12, thiamine and riboflavin. It also compacts faeces, and stores faecal matter in the rectum until it can be discharged via the anus in defecation.\n\nColour\n\nWhite.\n\nShape\n\nUpside down U Shaped, like a thick snake.\n\nLocation\n\nWithin the abdomen between the small intestines and anus.\n\nParts of the large intestine are:\n\nCecum – the first part of the large intestine\n\nTaeniae coli – three bands of smooth muscle\n\nHaustra – bulges caused by contraction of taeniae coli\n\nEpiploic appendages – small fat accumulations on the viscera\n\nLocations along the colon are:\n\nThe ascending colon\n\nThe right colic flexure (hepatic)\n\nThe transverse colon\n\nThe transverse mesocolon\n\nThe left colic flexure (splenic)\n\nThe descending colon\n\nThe sigmoid colon – the v-shaped region of the large intestine\n\nDescription\n\nThe average length of the small intestine in an adult human male is 6.9 m (22 feet 6 inches), and in the adult female 7.1 m (23 feet 4 inches). It can vary greatly, from as short as 4.6 m (15 feet) to as long as 9.8 m (32 feet). It is approximately 2.5–3cm in diameter.\n\nThe small intestine is divided into three structural parts: the Duodenum; Jejunum; and Ileum.\n\nFunction\n\nThe small intestine is where most chemical digestion takes place.The three major classes of nutrients that undergo digestion are proteins, lipids (fats) and carbohydrates. Digested food then able to pass into the blood vessels in the wall of the intestine through the process of diffusion. The small intestine is the site where most of the nutrients from ingested food are absorbed.\n\nAbsorption of the majority of nutrients takes place in the jejunum, with the following notable exceptions:\n\nIron is absorbed in the duodenum.\n\nVitamin B12 and bile salts are absorbed in the terminal ileum.\n\nWater and lipids are absorbed by passive diffusion throughout the small intestine.\n\nSodium bicarbonate is absorbed by active transport and glucose and amino acid co-transport.\n\nFructose is absorbed by facilitated diffusion.\n\nColour\n\nWhite.\n\nShape\n\nLike a very long coiled snake.\n\nLocation\n\nFrom the duodenum to the large intestine within the abdomen.\n\nDescription\n\nThe stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the digestion system which functions as an important organ of the digestive tract in some animals, including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. It is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing).\n\nFunction\n\nBolus (masticated food) enters the stomach through the oesophagus via the oesophageal sphincter. The stomach releases proteases (protein-digesting enzymes such as pepsin) and hydrochloric acid, which kills or inhibits bacteria and provides the acidic pH of two for the proteases to work. Food is churned by the stomach through muscular contractions of the wall called peristalsis – reducing the volume of the fundus, before looping around the fundus and the body of stomach as the boluses are converted into chyme (partially digested food). Chyme slowly passes through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum of the small intestine, where the extraction of nutrients begins. Depending on the quantity and contents of the meal, the stomach will digest the food into chyme anywhere between forty minutes and a few hours. The human stomach can hold approximately 1.5 litres of food.\n\nColour\n\nClear with whatever the colour of the food contents.\n\nShape\n\nA \"J\" shaped pouch.\n\nLocation\n\nThe stomach is located in the upper left of the abdomen between the esophagus and the small intestine sitting just below the diaphragm.\n\nDescription\n\nThe word faeces comes from the Latin meaning \"dregs”. Faeces are solid particle combinations of food residue, bacteria, and mucus. Human faecal matter varies significantly in appearance, depending on diet and health.\n\nNormally it is semi-solid, with a mucus coating. Average weight of healthy adult faeces is 100-200 grams daily. Of this, 65% will be water and 35% dry matter.\n\nFunction\n\nAfter eaten material has been digested, the remains of that material are expelled from the body as waste.\n\nColour\n\nThe normal brown colouration comes from a combination of bile, and bilirubin that comes from dead red blood cells. When ill the colour can vary from yellow, green or black.\n\nShape\n\nLike small tubes of mud. It can be hard, soft, tarry, or liquid.\n\nThe Bristol Stool Form Guide itemises seven different types of feces.\n\nLocation\n\nSolid matter excreted through the rectum and anus.\n\nDescription\n\nThe adult human brain weighs on average about 3lbs. (1.5kg) with a volume of around 1130 cubic centimetres (cm3) in women and 1260cm3 in men, although there is substantial individual variation.\n\nThe cerebral hemispheres form the largest part of the human brain and are situated above most other brain structures. They are covered with a cortical layer with a convoluted topography. Underneath the cerebrum lies the brain-stem, resembling a stalk on which the cerebrum is attached. At the rear of the brain, beneath the cerebrum and behind the brain-stem, is the cerebellum, a structure with a horizontally furrowed surface that makes it look different from any other brain area. The same structures are present in other mammals, although they vary considerably in relative size. As a rule, the smaller the cerebrum, the less convoluted the cortex. The cortex of a rat or mouse is almost perfectly smooth. The cortex of a dolphin or whale, on the other hand, is more convoluted than the cortex of a human.\n\nFunction\n\nThe brain is composed of neurons consisting of gray and white matter. The brain is the command centre sending impulses up to 170 mph down the spinal column and has nerve ending throughout the body.\n\nResearchers who study the functions of the cortex divide it into three functional categories of regions, or areas. One consists of the primary sensory areas, which receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the visual area of the occipital lobe, the auditory area in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory area in the parietal lobe. A second category is the primary motor area, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brain-stem and spinal cord. This area occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, directly in front of the somatosensory area. The third category consists of the remaining parts of the cortex, which are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex process that we call perception, thought, and decision making.\n\nColour\n\nDespite being referred to as grey matter, the live cortex is pinkish-beige in colour and slightly off-white in the interior.\n\nShape\n\nLike a small very soft melon. The living brain is very soft, having a consistency similar to soft gelatin or soft tofu.\n\nLocation\n\nIn the cranium.\n\nDescription\n\nAn exudate fluid that filters from the circulatory system into lesions or areas of inflammation. Pus consists of a thin, protein-rich fluid, known as liquor puris, and dead leukocytes from the body's immune response (mostly neutrophils). An accumulation of pus in an enclosed tissue space is known as an abscess, whereas a visible collection of pus within or beneath the epidermis is known as a pustule or pimple.\n\nFunction\n\nDuring infection, macrophages release cytokines which trigger neutrophils to seek the site of infection by chemotaxis. There, the neutrophils engulf and destroy the bacteria and the bacteria resist the immune response by releasing toxins called leukocidins. As the neutrophils die off from toxins and old age, they are destroyed by macrophages, forming the viscous pus.\n\nColor\n\nTypically white-yellow, yellow, or yellow-brown. Occasionally with blood.\n\nShape\n\nThick liquid that fills a cavity.\n\nLocation\n\nAnywhere in body."
