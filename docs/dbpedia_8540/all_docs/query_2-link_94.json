        "text": "The human gastrointestinal tract, also called the alimentary canal, is around 30 feet (9 meters) long in adults.\n\nIt consists of the following:\n\nthe mouth, or oral cavity\n\nthe esophagus\n\nthe stomach\n\nthe small intestine\n\nthe large intestine, or colon\n\nthe rectum\n\nIn addition, the following organs support digestion, for example, by chewing or adding enzymes and other secretions that enable the body to absorb nutrients:\n\nthe teeth\n\nthe tongue\n\nthe salivary glands\n\nthe liver\n\nthe pancreas\n\nthe gallbladder\n\nTogether, these organs provide mechanical processing, the secretion of enzymes and bile to help break down compounds, and the excretion of waste.\n\nSome terms to describe these functions include:\n\ningestion, which includes chewing and swallowing\n\nthe secretion of substances that enable food and nutrients to move through the body effectively\n\npropulsion, where muscles move the contents of the canal forward\n\ndigestion, the breakdown of food, for example, through chewing and secretions\n\nthe absorption of nutrients, which mainly occurs in the small intestine\n\ndefecation and urination, the removal of waste products through the rectum and the bladder, respectively\n\nThe mouth\n\nDigestion begins even before the food enters the mouth.\n\nWhen a person smells or thinks of food or eating, the salivary glands begin producing saliva.\n\nOnce the food is inside of the mouth:\n\nsaliva moistens it.\n\nthe teeth and tongue break it down mechanically.\n\nan enzyme in the saliva, salivary amylase, breaks it down into starch.\n\nChewing and amylase digestion will convert the food into a small, round blob, or bolus. This enables a person to swallow it easily.\n\nThe esophagus\n\nAfter swallowing, the bolus enters the esophagus, where gravity and muscle contractions help move it down to the stomach through a process called peristalsis.\n\nPeristalsis is the slow contraction of smooth muscles along and around the digestive system.\n\nAs the bolus moves through the esophagus, these contractions push it toward the stomach.\n\nWhat is esophageal achalasia, and how does it affect digestion?\n\nThe stomach\n\nThe bolus enters the stomach through a ring-like muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter. This sphincter relaxes, allowing the bolus to enter the stomach.\n\nIn the stomach, the following processes occur:\n\nThe stomach stores the food temporarily.\n\nCells in the stomach secrete gastric juices. These include hydrochloric acid, which maintains the pH of the stomach between 1.5â€“2.0.\n\nThe stomach has three muscular layers that churn and mix its contents.\n\nThese processes turn the food into a thick paste, known as chyme.\n\nHydrochloric acid is essential for:\n\ndestroying microorganisms, such as bacteria\n\nbreaking down proteins and plant fibers\n\nactivating pepsin, an enzyme that helps digest proteins\n\nThe acid, however, can harm the stomach lining, so some cells produce mucus to protect the lining from damage.\n\nThe stomach does not absorb many nutrients from the chyme into the bloodstream, so the chyme enters the small intestine through the pyloric sphincter.\n\nHow can you increase stomach acid naturally?\n\nThe small intestine\n\nThe small intestine is around 20 ft (6 m) long and absorbs around 90% of the nutrients from food into the bloodstream.\n\nThere are three sections:\n\nThe duodenum: This receives chyme from the stomach and digestive enzymes from the liver and pancreas.\n\nThe jejunum: Most of the chemical digestion and absorption occur here.\n\nThe ileum: This contains the ileocecal valve, a sphincter through which food passes to the large intestine.\n\nOnce the food is fully broken down, the villi absorb the nutrients, which enter the bloodstream.\n\nVilli are tiny, finger-like projections that line the walls of the small intestine. Within the villi are tiny capillaries called lacteals. By increasing their surface area, the villi maximize their absorption of nutrients.\n\nHow do the intestines work?\n\nThe large intestine\n\nAny unabsorbed food and nutrients now pass to the large intestine, or colon. The material is now feces.\n\nThe large intestine is around 6 ft (2 m) long and consists of the:\n\ncecum, a pouch through which food enters from the small intestine\n\nascending colon\n\ntransverse colon\n\ndescending colon\n\nsigmoid colon\n\nFrom the large intestine, the body absorbs water and electrolytes.\n\nFood travels slowly through the colon to allow the body to absorb water, and trillions of gut bacteria break down any undigested food.\n\nNext, peristalsis moves the feces toward the rectum.\n\nThe rectum\n\nAs the digested food moves into the rectum, nerves in the wall of the rectum known as stretch receptors detect when the chamber is full and stimulate the desire to defecate.\n\nDefecation involves two types of muscle movement.\n\nThe first happens automatically, and a person cannot control it. This is a relaxation of the smooth muscles in the internal anal sphincter.\n\nThe second, a person can control and is a conscious relaxation of the skeletal muscles in the external anal sphincter. If a person wishes to delay defection, they can avoid relaxing their muscles to move the feces back into the colon.\n\nThe longer feces stay in the colon, the more water the body will absorb. This can lead to dry, hard feces, constipation, and possibly impaction. For this reason, a person should defecate as soon as is convenient.\n\nA person should seek medical advice if they are unable to defecate for about 3 days or if they have abdominal or rectal pain or bleeding"
