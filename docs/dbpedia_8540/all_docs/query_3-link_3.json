        "text": "What is the stomach?\n\nThe stomach is a J-shaped organ that digests food. It produces enzymes (substances that create chemical reactions) and acids (digestive juices). This mix of enzymes and digestive juices breaks down food so it can pass to your small intestine.\n\nYour stomach is part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a long tube that starts at your mouth. It runs to your anus, where stool (poop) leaves your body. The GI tract is a key part of your digestive system.\n\nWhat is the stomach’s function?\n\nYour stomach’s purpose is to digest food and send it to your small intestine. It has three functions:\n\nTemporarily store food.\n\nContract and relax to mix and break down food.\n\nProduce enzymes and other specialized cells to digest food.\n\nHow does the stomach work with the rest of the GI tract?\n\nEach part of your GI tract breaks down food and liquid and carries it through your body. During the digestive process, your body absorbs nutrients and water. Then, you expel the waste products of digestion through your large intestine.\n\nFood moves through your GI tract in a few steps:\n\nMouth: As you chew and swallow, your tongue pushes food into your throat. A small piece of tissue called the epiglottis covers your windpipe. The epiglottis prevents choking.\n\nEsophagus: Food travels down a hollow tube called the esophagus. At the bottom, your esophageal sphincter relaxes to let food pass to your stomach. (A sphincter is a ring-shaped muscle that tightens and loosens.)\n\nStomach: Your stomach creates digestive juices and breaks down food. It holds food until it is ready to empty into your small intestine.\n\nSmall intestine: Food mixes with the digestive juices from your intestine, liver and pancreas. Your intestinal walls absorb nutrients and water from food and send waste products to the large intestine.\n\nLarge intestine: Your large intestine turns waste products into stool. It pushes the stool into your rectum.\n\nRectum: The rectum is the lower portion of your large intestine. It stores stool until you have a bowel movement.\n\nWhere is the stomach located?\n\nYour stomach sits in your upper abdomen on the left side of your body. The top of your stomach connects to a valve called the esophageal sphincter (a muscle at the end of your esophagus). The bottom of your stomach connects to your small intestine.\n\nHow big is your stomach?\n\nThe size of the stomach varies from person to person. Your stomach expands when full and deflates when empty. Because of this, your stomach size can vary depending on how recently and how much you have eaten.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are the parts of the stomach’s anatomy?\n\nYour stomach has five distinct sections:\n\nThe cardia is the top part of your stomach. It contains the cardiac sphincter, which prevents food from traveling back up your esophagus.\n\nThe fundus is a rounded section next to the cardia. It's below your diaphragm (the dome-shaped muscle that helps you breathe).\n\nThe body (corpus) is the largest section of your stomach. In the body, your stomach contracts and begins to mix food.\n\nThe antrum lies below the body. It holds food until your stomach is ready to send it to your small intestine.\n\nThe pylorus is the bottom part of your stomach. It includes the pyloric sphincter. This ring of tissue controls when and how your stomach contents move to your small intestine.\n\nWhat is the stomach’s structure?\n\nSeveral layers of muscle and other tissues make up your stomach:\n\nMucosa is your stomach’s inner lining. When your stomach is empty, the mucosa has small ridges (rugae). When your stomach is full, the mucosa expands, and the ridges flatten.\n\nSubmucosa contains connective tissue, blood vessels, lymph vessels (part of your lymphatic system) and nerve cells. It covers and protects the mucosa.\n\nMuscularis externa is the primary muscle of your stomach. It has three layers that contract and relax to break down food.\n\nSerosa is a layer of membrane that covers your stomach.\n\nWhat should I ask my doctor about my stomach?\n\nIf you have chronic stomach symptoms, you may speak with a gastroenterologist. Gastroenterologists are doctors who specialize in treating the digestive system. You may ask:\n\nWhat is the most likely cause of gastrointestinal symptoms?\n\nWhat tests will you use to diagnose a stomach condition?\n\nAre there any over-the-counter medications that can relieve symptoms?\n\nShould I make changes to my diet?\n\nWhen should I call my doctor?\n\nCall your healthcare provider right away if you have:\n\nChest pain.\n\nFever.\n\nNausea and vomiting.\n\nPus or blood in your stool.\n\nSevere dehydration or diarrhea.\n\nSudden and intense abdominal pain.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nYour stomach is a muscular organ in your upper abdomen. It is part of your GI tract. During digestion, your stomach contracts, relaxes and produces acids that help break down food. Your stomach size can vary depending on when and how much you have eaten. You can keep your stomach and digestive system healthy by eating healthy foods, exercising and managing stress."
