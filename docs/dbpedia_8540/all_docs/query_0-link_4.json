Preface The “Encyclopedia of Scientific and Technical Terms”, the- first of its kind in India, aims at being of service to science^ engineering and biological students. It is an ideal reference work for scientists of all disciplines, whether student or professional and particularly suitable for those involved in industry or who may come across scientific terms in the course of their work. In order to keep- pace with continuing rapid developments and expanding vocabularies- in all areas of science and technology, the editor of this dictionary decided to publish this encyclopedia in 14 volumes. An etfort has been made to bring together in the various volumes not only commonly used terms but also the more specialised and less frequently employed terms and especially new terms which have been introduced and have come into usuage with the recent developments of modern science and technology. The entries have been written in a clear and explanatory style ta provide both straight forward definitions and invaluable background information. This approach combined with an extensive cross- referencing system enables the reader to place each entry into a broader scientific context. In addition to definitions, synonyms, acronyms and abbreviations are given under the appropriate entry. These also appear in the alphabetical sequence as separate entries providing cross-references to the principal terms where units of measurement are essential to the definition, customary units are used with International System (SI) or metric equivalents. Many definitions are supplemented by detailed, informative illustrations of which there are approximately 1 000. The emphasis in this set is placed on providing definitions rather than on pronounciation, etymology and syllabication. The matter included in the various volumes of this set has been? carefully selected by university and college teachers who happen to- be highly specialised in their respective fields. The editor is happy to give credit here to the various contributors and to all those who had a hand in getting this set into its present form and particularly to. put on record my great debt to Dr. Mohan Katyal, Or. S.K. Anand, Dr. S.C. Sinha, Dr. Mohan- Prakash Arora, Dr. Keemti Lai, Dr. S.C. Chopra, and many others (iv) for the care and interest they took in clearing up complex points ■so that they might be put to simple English In compiling a dictionary of this kind it becomes necessary to draw upon the work of many authorities and seek the advice of colleagues to all of whom the author is deeply indebted This set IS an ideal reference book to be kept in all the scientific, •public and other general libraries Finally the editor expresses his sincere thanks to the publishers and printer for printing this book promptly All comments from users on omissions or shortcomings will be most welcome S 113, Malnya Nagar GVRDEEP R CHHATWAL Jlew Delht-llOan M Sc PhD MIABPS Contributors 1.

Adenine. A nitrogeneous base present in DNA and RNA- It is also a constituent of certain coenzymes, such as NAD and FAD, and when combined with the sugar ribose produces the nucleoside adenosine which is found in AMP, ADP, and ATP.

The phenomenon is Amino Acid 11 - common in certain lower animals (e.g. coelenterates and para- sitic protozoandes and flatworms) and in plants. The malaria parasite {Plasmodium) has a complex life cycle which involves- the alternation of sexually and asexually reproducing gene- rations.

These are formed from a zone liaving larger vessel elements produced by the cambium in the spring (lighter- layer), followed by a zone having smaller vessel elements (darker layer) produced during the late summer. This process is repeated annually so that the number of light or dark rings, gives idea about the age of that part of the plant. Annular Thickening.

Antilymphocyte Serum (ALS). A serum used to suppress the immune reaction in patients who are deceiving tissue or organ - transplants. It is prepared by injecting human lymphocytes into a horse, which then produces antibodies against them. ALS is then obtained from the horse and the antibodies are -extracted and purified. Now this 'preparation is injected into the transplant patient when it destroys his lymphocytes, which would otherwise have produced antibodies causing rejection of the transplant. Antipodal Cells. The three haploid cells which are found in the embryo sac of seed-bearing plants that migrate to the chalazal end of the sac opposite the micropyle. These nuclei arise due to the three meiotic divisions that produce the egg cell, synergid cells, and polar nuclei, but they themselves are not taking part in the fertilization process. They are eventully absorbed by the developing embryo, and their function is not known with certainty. Antiseptic.

In pteridophytes, the term refers to the development of the sporophyte directly from a cell of the gametophyte, so fusion of gametes is bypassed. It frequently takes place in gametophytes that have been produced aposporously and are thus diploid.

It has adenine linked to D-ribose (i.e. adenosine); the D-ribose com- ponent is having three phosphate groups which are linearly linked together by covalent bonds. These bonds undergo hydrolysis to yield either a mo\\ecxi\\e of ADP (adenosine dip- hosphate) and inorganic phosphate or a molecule of AMP (adenosine monophosphate) and pyrophosphate. Both these ■ reactions liberate a large amount of energy (about 307 kj mor^) which is used to bring about such biological processes as muscle contraction, the active transport of ions and mole- cules across cell membranes, and the synthesis of biomolecules. The reactions taking place in these processes often involve the enzyme-catalyzed transfer of the phosphate group to inter- 26 Alrxum mediate substrates. Most ATP mediated reactions need ions as cofactors. ATP IS regenerated by the rephosphorytation of AMP and A DP by using the chemical energy which is obtained from the oxidation of food This occurs during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle but, most significantly, is also due to the icduction-oxi- dation reaction of the electron transport chain, which ultimate* ly converts molecular oxygen to water (oxidative phosphory- lation) Atrium (1) Auricle) A chamber of the heart which receives blood from the veins and forces it by powerful muscular contrac- tion into the ventricle(s) Fish have a single atrium while all other vertebrates have two (2) Any of various cavities or chambers in dnimals. such as the chamber which is surroun- ding the gill slits of Acapbioxus and other invertebrate cbordates Atxopiiy.
