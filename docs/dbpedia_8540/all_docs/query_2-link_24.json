        "text": "Vertebrate Physiology\n\nBio410\n\nThis web page contains notes to accompany lectures in Vertebrate Physiology, Biology 410, taught by Dr. Peter King in the Department of Biology, Francis Marion University, Florence, South Carolina, 29502, USA.\n\nFeeding and Digestion\n\nAll vertebrates are heterotrophs.\n\ni.e. they must ingest organic compounds and reorganize them internally into the compounds they need.\n\nIt is important that the energy spent finding, ingesting and digesting food is less than that provided by the food.\n\nSome small birds and mammals need constant food supplies to maintain their high metabolic rates.\n\ne.g. hummingbirds\n\nSome snakes only need to feed a few times per year.\n\ne.g. large rattlesnake\n\nMost vertebrates swallow large chunks of food.\n\nPrey is either swallowed whole or torn apart and swallowed.\n\nChewing or mastication is only found in mammals.\n\nMammals have specialized teeth (heterodont dentition) that have different functions.\n\nMolars and premolars are designed to cut and grind food before it is swallowed. Canines are enlarged in carnivores and are used to catch prey. Incisors cut food.\n\nFish, amphibians and reptiles generally have homodont dentition.\n\nTurtles and birds have no teeth.\n\nFor some vertebrates digestion starts before ingestion.\n\nSnake venom is the product of modified salivary glands.\n\nEnvenomation starts the digestive process.\n\nSome snakes strike and release their prey.\n\nHow do rattlesnakes find their meal after it runs away?\n\nThey track the chemical trail of their own venom using their vomeronasal organ.\n\nDiets can be very specialized.\n\nThis is often for reasons other than physiology e.g. resource partitioning to reduce competition or adaptation to utilize a common resource.\n\nHognose snakes usually only eat toads.\n\nOften coevolution between predator and prey takes placed as evident by specialization.\n\ni.e. hognose snake tolerant of toad skin secretions.\n\nyoung frogs have greater resistance to cottonmouth venom than adults.\n\nBroad categories\n\ncarnivores\n\ninsectivores\n\npiscivores\n\nherbivores\n\nnectivores\n\ncarion feeders\n\nomnivores\n\nAnimal food consist mainly of\n\nproteins\n\nlipids (fats)\n\ncarbohydrates\n\nDigestion\n\nVertebrates can not be absorbed food directly into their bodies.\n\nEven if liquified to avoid physical breakup, the molecules of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates are too big to transport across cell membranes in the digestive tract.\n\nThese three food groups are all polymers and can be broken down by enzymes into smaller subunits by a hydrolysis reaction.\n\nEnzymes are biological catalysts.\n\nEnzymes facilitate a chemical reaction without being directly involved.\n\ni.e. AB + enzyme -> A + B + enzyme\n\nEnzymes often end in -ase and are descriptive of the molecules they act on.\n\ni.e. protease, lipase, endopeptidase, carboxypeptidase, amylase.\n\nMany proteases are stored in the body in inactive forms called zymogens.\n\nActivity of enzymes are effected by\n\npH\n\ntemperature.\n\nEach enzyme has an optimal range for activity.\n\nProteins\n\nProteins are made up of amino acid monomers (20 possible) joined together by peptide bonds.\n\nPrimary structue - list of AAs\n\nSecondary structure - planes or helices\n\nTertiary - three dimensional shape\n\nQuaternary - more than one chain\n\nProtein Digestion\n\nProteases cleave peptide bonds.\n\nExopeptidases cleave the first or last peptide bond.\n\nEndopeptidases cleave internal peptide bonds.\n\nProteases attract amino acids to an active site in the enzyme and cleave (break) a peptide bond associated with the amino acid.\n\nDifferent proteases have unique active sites that can attract specific amino acids and only peptide bonds associated with those amino acids will be cleaved.\n\nFor example trypsin, secreted by the pancreas, cleaves bonds after lysine and arginine.\n\nAnabolism\n\nOnly individual amino acids absorbed in intestine.\n\nIndividual amino acids are absorbed into the blood and distributed around the body.\n\nThey are recombined in cells according to RNA templates to form new proteins.\n\nAmino acids may be broken down further in times of energy crisis.\n\nSome amino acids can be synthesized in the body of vertebrates (non essential amino acids).\n\nOthers must be ingested (essential amino acids).\n\nMost vertebrates must ingest about 10 essential amino acids and only slight variation exists between classes and species.\n\nEssential amino acids Nonessential amino acids lysine glycine tryptophan alanine phenylalanine serine leucine asparagine isoleucine aspartic acid threonine glutamic acid methionine proline valine glutamine arginine tyrosine histidine cysteine\n\nLipid digestion\n\nMost fats ingested are triglycerides i.e. three fatty acid chains connected to a glycerol molecule.\n\nLipases secreted by pancreas cleave two of the fatty acid chains from the triglyceride producing free fatty acids and monoglycerides which are absorbed.\n\nProblem: How is a non soluble fat digested by enzyme?\n\nBile from the liver (via the gall bladder) emulsifies the lipids and increases surface area for action by lipases.\n\nMonoglycerides and fatty acids combine with bile salts and lecithin to form micelles in intestine.\n\nMicelles are small and remain suspended in water.\n\nMicelles allow absorption of lipids by intestinal epithelium.\n\nTriglycerides are reformed in the epithelium cells of the intestine, combined with cholesterol, phospholipids and proteins to form soluble chylomicrons.\n\nChylomicrons are too big to enter capillaries and are absorbed by lymph vessels (lacteals).\n\nCarbohydrate digestion\n\nCarbohydrates are complex sugars made up of monomers of monosaccharides.\n\nGenerally only monosaccharides are absorbed.\n\nAnimals and plants use glucose as an energy currency within the organism.\n\nPlants store this as amylose and animals store it as glucose.\n\nAmylases secreted in the saliva of some vertebrates (mammals) and from the pancreas break up starch and glycogen into smaller oligosaccharides.\n\nMany specific enzymes such as sucrase, lactase, maltase are in the intestinal brush border.\n\nLets follow the food trail.\n\nMouth - the saliva of most mammals contains amylase that begins the breakdown of carbohydrates.\n\nMastication occurs in mammals only.\n\nMammals have heterodont dentition (as opposed the homodont dentition in other classes) meaning that teeth have specialized function.\n\nTeeth are grouped as incisors, canines, premolars and molars.\n\nOrganization of teeth vary depending on diet.\n\nFood moves from mouth to stomach via the esophagus, a muscular tube that moves food by peristalsis.\n\nCan you stand on your head and drink water?\n\nHow does a giraffe drink from a pond?\n\nThe epiglottis closes the entrance to the larynx to prevent food entering the lungs.\n\nStomach - secretion of pepsinogen from chief cells in stomach lining and hydrochloric acid from parietal cells. pH is about 2 in most vertebrates. Amylase inactivated and pepsinogen activated by low pH. Only protease activity and mixing of food to form chyme.Mucus with bicarbonate buffer protects stomach lining.\n\nSmall Intestine -\n\nPancreas secretes bicarbonate buffer to bring pH up to about 7.\n\nPancreas secretes trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen and procarboxypeptidase for protein breakdown.\n\nEnzyme cascade\n\nEnterokinase produced by small intestine (duodenum) brush border activates trypsinogen.\n\nTrypsin activates trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen and procarboxypeptidase.\n\nPancreas secretes amylase for carbohydrate breakdown.\n\nPancreas secretes nucleases for nucleic acid breakdown.\n\nPancreas secretes lipases for lipid breakdown.\n\nGall bladder secretes bile to emulsify fats.\n\nBile produced by liver and stored in gall bladder.\n\nBile salts recycled, absorbed in small intestine and returned to liver. (entero hepatic circulation)\n\nBrush border produces enterokinase, and has other proteases and disaccharidases attached to surface.\n\nMost of the absorption takes place in middle part of small intestine.\n\nThe surface area of the intestine is increased by villi and microvilli.\n\nSurface area is generally proportional to body size but differs in different classes.\n\nLarge intestine\n\nMainly water absorption and compaction of feces.\n\nLarge bacterial community - breakdown of some cellulose.\n\nBacteria synthesize vitamin K that is absorbed.\n\nCellulose digestion by herbivores\n\nVertebrates lack the enzyme to cleave the bonds between successive glucose monomers of cellulose.\n\nHerbivores have symbiotic relationships with microorganisms (bacteria and protozoans) that produce cellulase.\n\nSpecies involved are more commonly mammals but birds and reptiles have also been found to utilize microbial fermentation (Willow ptarmigan, galliforme birds, green turtle, iguana).\n\nRuminants\n\nGroup of herbivorous mammals.\n\nThe true stomach of ruminants (abomasum) is preceded by three other chambers the rumen, reticulum and the omasum.\n\nRumen serves as a fermentation vat for food with large populations of bacteria and protozoans.\n\nGlucose released either used by microbes or absorbed by vertebrate.\n\nFermentation products (organic acids) make up about 70% of the energy absorbed by cattle.\n\nOther byproducts methane and carbon dioxide.\n\nMicroorganisms also synthesize protein which is later digested by vertebrate.\n\nUrea a waste product from protein breakdown is normally excreted but is recycled in ruminants.\n\nIt is used by the microbes for protein synthesis.\n\nMost nonruminant vertebrates herbivores have either compartmentalized stomachs where fermentation takes place or use the cecum.\n\nCecum not as efficient because less efficient absorption at that end of intestine\n\nCaprophagy\n\nSome rodents and lagermorphs send food through their digestive tract twice.\n\nTwo types of feces produced.\n\nOne is waste product the other is reingested direct from the anus.\n\nRabbits reingested feces come from the cecum, are surrounded by a mucus membrane and are not chewed when reingested.\n\nThey lodge in a separate part of the stomach and are not moved on directly to the small intestine.\n\nSome birds have an expansion of the esophagus called the crop.\n\nFermentation has been reported in the crop of some galliforme birds but it is generally for storage and physical softening and breakdown\n\nControl of digestive secretions\n\nEnzyme secretion is largely controlled by endocrine secretions from cells in the gastric mucosa.\n\nNervous control also plays apart and the thought of food or the smell of food can induce salivary secretions in the mouth and some gastric secretion. This is called the cephalic stage.\n\nGastric stage.\n\nAs food enters the stomach mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors are stimulated.\n\nShort polypeptides and amino acids stimulate chief cells to secrete pepsinogen and parietal cells to secrete HCl.They also stimulate G cells in the stomach to secrete the hormone gastrin.\n\nGastrin stimulatespepsinogen and HCl secretion also. This is a positive feedback system.\n\nGlucose has no effect on gastric secretion and lipids inhibit gastric secretion.\n\nNegative feedback controls the system - as pH in stomach drops gastrin secretion is inhibited, stopping completely at pH of 1.\n\nAs chyme enters the duodenum its presents stimulates chemoreceptors.\n\nFalling pH stimulate mucosal cells to secrete the hormone secretin. Secretin acts on duct cells of the pancreas to release bicarbonate rich pancreatic juice.\n\nSecretin also stimulates the liver to increase secretiion of bile.\n\nLipids in the duodenum stimulate release of the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK).\n\nCCK stimulates acinar cells in the pancreas to secrete digestive enzymes and contraction of muscle in the gall bladder to secrete bile.\n\nReturn to Index"
