List as many parts of the digestive system as you can in one minute.

Decide which organ/part is the most important and explain why.

Food is picked up by the beak, then moved down the oesophagus into the crop. It is temporarily stored here. Next, the food reaches the proventriculus, the first part of the stomach. Digestive enzymes are added to the food, acid is added and mucous is secreted by the proventriculus. This helps to soften the food, which often consists of very hard grains.

The food passes on to the gizzard, the second part of the stomach. In the gizzard, with its tough muscular wall, breakdown of the food is completed with the help of sand and small stones swallowed by the bird. The food can be regurgitated back and fro between the proventriculus and the gizzard many times to improve digestion effectiveness. The food then passes on to the small intestine, where the pancreas and liver help absorption as they did in the other systems studied.

Birds have a short large intestine, where the small and large intestines meet there are two caeca. The large intestine and the caeca absorb water. The caeca also contain microbes that break down fibre. The waste is passed out through the cloaca after uric acid has been added to it.
