Asteras Tripolis 0-0 Xanthi Skoda

Alva once again started for Xanthi and played entire game.

"Specifically, in `53 and` 77, Alva and Rantzinski - respectively-failed from the position to send the ball in the nets of Ampari."

Xanthi 2-0 Veria

Alva played since the 58'.

Cuto wasn't selected again for Veria. Veria just signed two international players this week. (One of them is a defender) and They had signed Argentinian Pietravallo who eventually took Mendoza's spot couple of weeks before. I have read that Veria will get rid of Cuto and Venezuelan Paez.
