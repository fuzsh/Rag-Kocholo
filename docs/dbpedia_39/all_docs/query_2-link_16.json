        "text": "Skoda Xanthi is a football side based in Xanthi, Greece. It was established in 1967 as Xanthi Athletic Club. In 1991 it was bought by an importing company of Skoda cars, which renamed it to Skoda Xanthi. The kit colors of the side are red and white. The home stadium is Skoda Xanthi Arena with a capacity of 7,422 seats.\n\nXanthi competed in lower leagues, before the club was promoted to Alpha Ethniki in 1989. Since then Xanthi has never faced relegation from the first division. In the 2004/2005 season the club reached the 4th place in the 1st division, which is considered to be the best result in the history of Xanthi.\n\nThe club took part in the UEFA Cup 3 times: in 2001, 2005 and 2006."
