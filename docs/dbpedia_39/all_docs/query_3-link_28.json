        "text": "This section of TNS includes Latics players and/or managers and coaches who have represented their countries either whilst with the club or their former/future clubs. Also included are Latics trialists who have more likely than not featured in various ‘friendlies’, ‘trial games’ and ‘behind closed doors’ matches. Just about everyone known (to the author) is included.\n\nThis project was inspired by the hugely popular ‘Wigan Athletic Players’ A to Z’ (first published on Latic Fanatic and subsequently plagarised by a convicted paedophile), and the equally acclaimed ‘Wigan Borough A to Z’. published exclusively by and for YOTAC before the merge with Mudhuuter and NAPO. Sit back and marvel at the cosmopolitan figures that have graced this great club!\n\nBernard Ramsdale – 1999 to present\n\nADAM KOMLOSI – FRANCISCO ZUELLA\n\nADAM KOMLOSI\n\nPlayed five times for Hungary whilst at MTK Budapest. Although he never played a competitive game for Latics he did feature in a pre season game in Belgium. He wrote to the club expressing his wish for a trial and Paul Jewell had no hesitation in inviting him over to Christopher Park when the first team returned for pre season training. He played against KVC Voerbroedering Geel on 13th July 2004 in a 3-1 win for the Blues.\n\nHowever, he failed to impress sufficiently and moved on to Preston North End. He eventually finished his international career with 10 caps, including an appearance against England, and no goals to his credit. He is currently (July 2012) plying his trade with Detreceni VSC.\n\nAHMED MIDO\n\nMido, whose full name is Ahmed Hossam Hussein Abdelhamid, played 48 times for Egypt, scoring 19 goals whilst with Ajax, Marseille, Roma, Tottenham Hotspur and Middlesbrough. He arrived at the JJB Stadium on a six month loan deal from Middlesbrough on 23rd January 2009, teaming up with his international team mate Amr Zaki. He made his debut five days later in a game against Liverpool at the JJB Stadium. The result was a 1-1 draw and Mido himself scored the goal from the penalty spot.\n\nHe is currently (August 2012) plying his trade Barnsley, having spent the second half of season 2009/10 on loan at West Ham United and later, Ajax. He signed for the Yorkshire outfit from his parent club El Zamalek. His international total now reads, 51 games played, 20 goals scored.\n\nALAN KENNEDY\n\nPlayed twice for England whilst at Liverpool. He won his first cap on 4th April 1984 against Northern Ireland and England won the game 1-0. He had been playing in Sweden before Latics took a gamble on the Liverpool legend and signed him over Christmas 1987. At the time Latics were unable to afford his services and so Mr John James’ Port Petroleum company sponsored him.\n\nHe made his Latics League debut, along with Stan McEwan (for whom the fans used to collect money for his wages) at Gigg Lane on Boxing Day 1987 when the Blues beat Bury 2-0. He made 22+0 League appearances without scoring before joining the now defunct Non League outfit Colne Dynamoes, who at the time had huge ambitions and a millionaire chairman in charge of the club. He is currently (August 2012) a very popular pundit with the Century 105 radio station.\n\nALAN MAHON\n\nPlayed twice for the Republic of Ireland whilst at Blackburn Rovers. Alan was signed on a three and a half year deal on 6th February 2004 from Blackburn Rovers for a fee of £200,000, although the Blues agreed to pay Rovers £250,000 if they won promotion to the Premier League by the end of the season. He made his Latics League debut the following day against Ipswich Town at Portman Road. Ironically he had joined Ipswich on loan from Blackburn five months earlier and although the Tractor Boys wanted to keep him they couldn’t afford his wages. The game which was televised live to the nation by SKY resulted in a stunning 3-1 victory to Latics. He was a vital part of the team that won promotion to the Premier League in season 2004/05. During this historic season he made 26 League appearances and scored 7 goals.\n\nJust the fact that he was in the squad that won promotion to the big time will ensure his contribution to the team will never be forgotten. This brought his Latics career total to 40 league games played and 8 league goals scored. After leaving the Blues he had spells at Burnley, which included a one game loan at Blackpool, and Tranmere Rovers.\n\nALAN McLOUGHLIN\n\nPlayed 42 games for the Republic of Ireland, scoring twice, whilst at Swindon Town, Southampton and Portsmouth. He was something of a veteran having played under the mercurial Jack Charlton World Cup squads of 1990 and 1994. On 9th December 1999 John Benson signed him for a fee of £260,000 from Portsmouth. The day after which Pompey boss Alan Ball was sacked. He signed a two-year contract and in all fairness he suffered a few injuries and was unable to show the fans what he could really do during the campaign. He made his debut against Brentford at the JJB Stadium on 18th December 1999 in a game that Latics won 1-0.\n\nHe stayed at the club until 25th October 2001 when his contract was terminated by mutual agreement and he played his last game for Latics against Wrexham in a LDV Vans Trophy first round game against Wrexham at the Racecourse Ground, a game in which the Blues were humiliated 1-5. He had been on the transfer list for eleven months when he left. He made just 12+10 League appearances and scored 1 League goal during his time at the club. After leaving the JJB Stadium he had a trial for Swindon Town and it seemed his playing career was over after failing to impress. However, on 23rd December 2001 he signed for Rochdale on a monthly contract. He wound his career up at Forest Green Rovers and is currently (August 2012), a commentator for Portsmouth radio station ‘Quay’.\n\nALLAN BROWN\n\nPlayed 13 times for Scotland whilst at East Fife and Blackpool, scoring 5 goals. Whilst at Bloomfield Road Allan missed two FA Cup Finals through injury (1951 and 1953), but he did have the consolation of playing for Scotland in the 1954 World Cup Tournament. He later did play in a FA Cup Final for Luton Town in 1959 against Nottingham Forest but he ended up with a losers medal for his troubles.\n\nHe arrived at Springfield Park as player/manager on Monday 6th April 1964, succeeding Johnny Ball who had left the club seven months previously. He made his Latics League debut on 11th April 1964 at the age of thirty-seven and he netted twice against Northwich Victoria in a 3-2 home win. Allan also goes down in history as the first ever Latics substitute when he replaced Walter Stanley in the 2-2 home draw against Chester Reserves. In total he made 65+2 Cheshire League appearances and scored 22 League goals before leaving the club to manage Luton Town early in the season to be replaced by team captain Alf Craig. Incredibly, under Allan’s leadership the Blues had been unbeaten for a record fifty-two League games.\n\nDuring that time Latics won the Cheshire League, the Cheshire League Cup and the Liverpool Non League Senior Cup in season 1964/65. And the following season saw the team finish as Cheshire League runners-up (for which they won a trophy called the Edward Case Cup), they also won the Cheshire League Cup and the Liverpool Non League Senior Cup again, and added the Lancashire Junior Cup to their haul as well. In the first Cheshire League game Latics played without him being in charge, they lost, a feat that was deemed impossible when he was the manager. That just shows the influence that the keep fit fanatic had on the team. After leaving Latics he managed Luton Town, Torquay United, Nottingham Forest and he then returned to the Tangerines on 5th May 1976 until a public falling out with his chairman resulted in the sack on 6th February 1978\n\nHe couldn’t keep away from Bloomfield Road and in 1981, after a spell as manager of Quadsia in Kuwait, he replaced Alan Ball as manager of the club but was unable to prevent relegation into Division Four. Allan sadly passed away on 20th April 2011 aged 84 years old.\n\nALLENBY CHILTON\n\nPlayed twice for England whilst at Manchester United. He won his first cap on 7th October 1950 against Northern Ireland and England won the game 4-1. Matt Busby once called Allenby his best ever centre-half, praise indeed. He is also in the all time United top ten of players with most appearances for the Old Trafford club with 353 to his name. He was in the 1954 World Cup squad along with other North West legends Nat Lofthouse and Stanley Matthews. Allenby was a trained boxer and as well as playing for Manchester United he played for Seaham Colliery and Liverpool and he also took part in 3 games for Reading during the Second World War.\n\nThe war period was a very busy one for Allenby as he also turned out for Airdrieonians, Cardiff City, Charlton Athletic, Hartlepool United, Newcastle United and Middlesbrough! He had retired from the game, after managing Grimsby Town to the Championship of the Third Division North, to become a publican in York, but was interested enough in the managerial vacancy (caused by the dismissal of Pat Murphy) at Latics to return to the game he loved towards the end of season 1959/60 season. His self imposed retirement had lasted all of one month! On 15th December of the following League campaign he was sacked despite Latics losing just 5 games out of 27. The last of which was against New Brighton (1-3) at Springfield Park. He sadly died in Southwick on 15th June 1996 aged seventy-eight.\n\nALI AL-HABSI\n\nPlayed 70 times for Oman before arriving at the DW Stadium on a season long loan deal from Premier League rivals and neighbours Bolton Wanderers. He made his debut for the Blues on 24th August 2010 in a Carling Cup second round game against Hartlepool United at the Victoria Ground. He kept a clean sheet as the Blues cruised to a 3-0 victory. His next game was his Premier League debut four days later, a 1-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane and from that moment on he became the Blues’ number one goalkeeper.\n\nHe went on to become the Player of the Year and was signed on a permanent deal in the summer of 2011 for an undisclosed fee, rumoured to be around the three million pounds mark. This made him the most expensive goalkeeper in the club’s history to date (January 2012).\n\nAMR ZAKI\n\nPlayed 52 times for Egypt, netting 29 times, whilst at El Zamalek. He arrived at the JJB Stadium on a season long loan deal in July 2008. When he put pen to paper he was, according to official FIFA statistics, the most prolific striker in the world! The terms of the deal were that the Blues would pay his club £1,500,000 for the 2008/09 Premiership campaign and a further £500,000 should he score more than ten goals during the season. By November he had scored 10 Premier League goals and was the top goalscorer for a while before a majoe fall out with Steve Bruce.\n\nThe remainder of the season saw Zaki frozen out of the first team picture and he returend to El Zamalek in May 2009. He spent the latter half of season 2009/10 on loan to Hull City before returning to El Zamalek. His current (January 2011) international total reads, 57 games played, 28 games scored\n\nANDY HOLDEN\n\nPlayed once for Wales whilst at Chester City. He joined Latics from Chester City for a fee of £40,000 and made his Latics League debut on 1st November 1986 against Carlisle United at Springfield Park. That was the first ever League game Latics had ever played against the Cumbrians and the Blues won 2-0. He made 48+1 League appearances and scored 4 League goals before Latics sold him to Oldham Athletic on 9th January 1989 for a fee of £150,000.\n\nJust two weeks earlier, Christmas Eve, the Blues had also sold John Butler to Stoke City for £100,000. Both these decisions taken by the club chairman, Bill Kenyon, ensured that Latics struggled to make a success of the season. He is currently (May 2011) the manager of Everton’s reserve team.\n\nANDREAS GRANQVIST\n\nAndreas was signed by Paul Jewell on a six month loan spell from Helsingborgs IF on 28th December 2006. He was already a Swedish Under 21’s star when he arrived at the JJB Stadium and he made 1 appearance for the Sweden whilst on loan at the JJB Stadium. During his loan spell at the club he made no Premiership appearances and he only featured in a FA Cup third round defeat against Portsmouth at Fratton Park on 6th January 2007.\n\nHe never really fitted into Paul Jewell’s plans, but when Paul resigned his post as Latics manager, his successor Chris Hutchings, offered him a two-year deal which he duly signed on 19th June 2007. The fee involved was £750.000. He made his Premiership debut on the opening day of the 2007/08 season, 11th August 2007, against Everton at Goodison Park, a game that Latics lost 2-1. After making just 10+6 appearances for the Blues before returning to Helsingborgs on 18th March 2008. He has since (August 2012) brought his international total up to 21 games during which he has scored twice.\n\nANDREAS JOHANSSON\n\nPlayed 12 times for Sweden whilst at AIK Solna and Djurgardens. It was from the latter that he was signed by Paul Jewell on 31st January 2005. The fee was £450,000 but Andreas became something of an enigma. After making a League debut on 5th February 2005 as a substitute for Gary Teale in a home encounter against Stoke City, which resulted in defeat, he didn’t make another appearance all season. Paul Jewell explained this by stating that Andreas had failed to acclimatise himself in this country. He did however, insist that he would be a ‘major player’ the following season.\n\nDespite his relative inactivity, nothing can take away the fact that he was a member of the squad that took Latics into the Premiership. Andreas struggled to make an impact in Latics’ first Premiership season making 6+5 appearances and scoring 4 Premiership goals as a makeshift striker. He did feature heavily in the team that got Latics through to their first major Cup Final although he didn’t feature in the final of the Carling Cup competition at the Millennium Stadium. He never managed to gain a regular first team place and was transferred to Aalborg BK on 17th July 2007 when he was released from his contract by new manager Chris Hutchings.\n\nHe is currently (August 2012) plying his trade at Odense Boldclub in the Dabish Super League and his international total is 16 appearances without scoring.\n\nANDY MARRIOTT\n\nPlayed 5 times for Wales whilst at Wrexham, as well as having played once for the England Under 21’s! Andy was brought to the club on a month’s loan deal from Sunderland following an injury to first choice Roy Carroll. He made his Latics debut on Tuesday 9th January in a 3-2 victory over Oldham Athletic in the first round of the Leyland Daf Vans Trophy. His only other appearance for the first team was at Walsall in the second round of the Leyland Daf Vans Trophy which Latics lost 1-2. He never played a League game for the Blues and the left Latics on 14th March 2001 and returned to Sunderland.\n\nHowever, he was only back at the Stadium of Light for two days when he joined First Division outfit Barnsley on loan until the end of the 2000/2001 season. He is currently (March 2012) the assistant Sporting/Technical Director at West Bromwich Albion.\n\nANDY WEBSTER\n\nPlayed 22 times for Scotland, scoring once, whilst at Arbroath and Heart of Midlothian. His arrival at the JJB Stadium was clouded in controversy as he became the first EVER player to switch clubs whilst still having over a year of his current contract remaining. He invoked a new clause under FIFA regulations that he could move, providing the transfer didn’t involve another club in his own country. A long drawn out legal battle ensued as to who was liable to pay, and how much. He signed a pre signing on form at Latics on 10th August 2006 with deal going through towards the end of the month. He made his Latics Premiership debut on 21st October 2006 at the JJB Stadium against Manchester in a game that resulted in a 4-0 win for Latics. He replaced the injured Fitz Hall for the start of the second half.\n\nHe struggled to adjust to the pace of the Premiership, and after making just 3+1 Premiership appearances for the Blues, he was loaned to Rangers on 5th January 2007. Latics signed David Unsworth on a free transfer from Premiership rivals Sheffield United as cover on the same day. The result of his transfer wrangling was that he had to pay his former club £650.000 and he was also handed a two match ban for the start of season 2007/08, whilst Latics didn’t pay a penny.\n\nHe made his debut for Rangers in a post season friendly against LA Galaxy as a used substitute. He is currently (August 2012) plying his trade at Heart of Midlothian. He has represented Scotland once since leaving the DW Stadium bringing his international total to 22 games played during which he has scored once.\n\nANGELO HENRIQUE\n\nAngelo had played one game for Chile, scoring in a 1-3 defeat against Serbia, prior to signing fdor Latics on loan from Manchester Uniuted on 2nd January 2013. His manager Alex Ferguson was keen for Henrique to gain Premier League experience and aqcnctioned the move which held up his international career whilst at the DW Stadium. His first game for Latics was against Bournemouth at home in a 1-1 draw in a FA Cup third round game.\n\nANTOLIN ALCARAZ\n\nAntolin had played four times without scoring for Paraguay prior to signing for the Blues on 14th May 2010. He arrived at the DW Stadium on a free transfer and immediately joined up with his Paraguayan team mates as they headed off to South Africa for the 2010 World Cup tournament. Whilst in Africa he was joined by six other of his new club team mates, namely Richard Kingson, Vladimir Stojkovic, Maynor Figueroa, Won Hee-Cho, Hendry Thomas and Steve Gohouri!\n\nOn 14th June 2010 he became the first ever Wigan Athletic player to score in the World Cup Finals when Paraguay drew 1-1 against Italy.\n\nHe made his Premier League debut for\n\nthe club on 14th August 2010 in a 0-4 home defeat against Blackpool on the opening day of the season. He became the mainstay of the Latics defence and a firm crowd favourite. To date (August 2012) he has made 21 appearances for his country, netting twice.\n\nARCHIE GEMMILL\n\nPlayed 43 times for Scotland during which he scored eight goals, whilst at Derby County, Nottingham Forest and Birmingham City. He will always be remembered for THAT goal against Holland in the 1978 World Cup Competition. He arrived at the club as a favour to his old friend and Latics manager at the time, Larry Lloyd, on a week to week contract from the Jacksonville Teamen in September 1982 and made his Latics League debut on 25th September 1982 in the Blues’ first ever game against Chesterfield . The game at Saltergate ended in a 0-2 defeat.\n\nHe made just 11 League appearances without scoring and left Springfield Park to join Derby County as player/coach. His decision to return to the Baseball Ground put the mockers on a move to Manchester City, against whom he impressed after a League Cup game against them for Latics. He is currently (May 2008) the coach of the Scottish Under 19’s squad.\n\nAROUNA KONE\n\nPlayed 35 times for the Ivory Coast, bagging nine goals in the process prior to signing for the Blues on 14th August 2012. He was signed a sa replacement for Hug Rodallega who had joined Fulham the previous month.\n\nLatics beat a host of team to his signature including Tottenham Hotspur, Aston Villa and Sunderland before Kone signed a three year contract for the club having signed from Levante for a fee of five million euro. He is still to make his Latics debut..\n\nBOBBY CAMPBELL\n\nPlayed twice for Northern Ireland whilst at Bradford City. Is there really any need to re introduce this guy to all we Latic Fanatics? He arrived at Springfield Park in October 1986 when Ray Mathias paid Bradford City £25,000 for his services. He made his Latics League debut on 5th October 1986 against Swindon Town at the County Ground in a game that Latics lost 1-3 in what was the first occasion that both teams had played each other. Bobby also scored Latics’ consolation goal during the game. He made a total of 61+8 League appearances and scored 27 League goals before hanging up his boots at the end of the 1987/88 season.\n\nBILLY COOK\n\nBilly won 15 caps for Northern Ireland whilst playing for Everton. His first club was Celtic with whom he won a Scottish League championship winners medal in 1931. He moved on to Everton where he won and FA Cup winners medal in 19333 and a League Championship winners medal six years later. The Second World War saw him guesting for no less than six league clubs before he finished his playing career with Wrexham. His first taste of management was at Rhyl. After spending four seasons at Sunderland as first team coach (1948/49 until 1952/53) he went on to coach in Peru, Iraq and Norway.\n\nIt was from Norway that he arrived at Springfield Park as manager on a 12 week contract in August 1956. Billy started his Springfield Park career pretty badly with the team winning only 2 of their first 12 league and cup games. In October he was forced to sell star striker Arnold Darcy to Swindon Town, but things on the results front had improved dramatically by then. A League double over Chorley was also well received by the Latics faithful. However, following two drawn FA Cup games against Netherfield Billy left Springfield Park after refusing a permanent contract. Billy passed away in December 1992 aged 83.\n\nBOBBY CHARLTON\n\nPlayed 106 times for England and scoreing one of the goals. He won everything that game had to offer whilst at Old Trafford and he is still currently (September 2007) working as an ambassador for the club. Bobby was the caretaker/manager of Latics from 5th April 1983 until the end of the 1982/83 season when the club came very close to extinction. Ironically, his last game in charge of Latics (and at the time many people thought that it could have been Latics’ last ever League game) was against Preston North End, another club he had previously managed. The Blues lost the game 0-1. An appeal was set up by former player Jimmy Shirley during the following pre season called the ‘Latics Lifeline’ and this in no small part led to the club surviving.\n\nBOBBY FINAN\n\nPlayed once for Scotland during the Second World War whilst at Blackpool. He made a name for himself as a prolific goal scorer at Bloomfield Road and he scored 85 goals in 173 league appearances for the Tangerines. He is another player to have played in the FA Cup Final, a feat he achieved whilst playing for Blackpool against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge, scoring one of the winning goals. He was still playing in the European Cup in 1960 albeit for Limerick! Bobby joined Latics from Blackpool during season 1949/50 and stayed at Springfield Park until the beginning of the following season. In total he played 31 League games for Latics scoring 14 League goals in the process as Latics finished as runners up in the Lancashire Combination. When his playing days were over more than a decade later he returned to Blackpool as chief scout.\n\nBRUCE RIOCH\n\nPlayed 24 times for Scotland whilst at Derby County and Everton. Bruce of course was appoi\n\nnted manager of the club at the start of season 2000/01. He turned down managerial vacancies at Leicester City, Sheffield Wednesday and Bradford City to take over the reigns at the JJB. His record of getting neighbours Bolton Wanderers into the Premier League was deemed a good omen by chairman Dave Whelan and outgoing manager John Benson and the fans took to him immediately.\n\nHowever, just eight months and one day later, on 27th February 2001, he sensationally resigned/was sacked? with the Blues in fourth place in the Second Division. First team coach Colin Greenall took over as caretaker/manager with immediate effect. On 12th March 2007 he left his last managerial job with Danish outfit Odense BK to look after his sick wife. He was succeeded by Michael Hemmin.\n\nBRYAN HAMILTON\n\nPlayed 50 times for Northern Ireland whilst at Linfield, Ipswich Town, Everton, Millwall and Swindon Town. Bryan replaced Harry McNally as manager on 28th March 1985 after Harry had refused to step down in order for Roy Tunks and Alex Bruce to run first team affairs. His first game in charge of Latics was against Bournemouth at Dean Court and current Latics gaffer Paul Jewell scored the Blues’ goal in a 2-1 defeat. At the end of that season (1984/85) he took Latics to Wembley and the team went down in history as the winners of the inaugural Freight Rover Trophy. At the start of the following League campaign he appointed Ray Mathias as his assistant and it was Ray who took over the managerial reigns when Bryan left at the end of the season to take over the vacant managerial role at Leicester City.\n\nBryan returned to Springfield Park as Chief Executive at the beginning of March 1988 and took over the managerial reigns once again when Ray Mathias was sacked for the first time in March 1989. Bryan himself resigned from his managers post at Latics for the second time on 25th March 1993 and left Dave Philpotts in charge of first team affairs as Latics were relegated for the first (and only) time in their Football League history. Bryan of course is the first, and only, Latics manager to ever play for and manage his country. He is currently (May 2008) a media pundit, a job he combines with his duties as Technical Director of the Antigua and Barbuda Football Association.\n\nCALEB FOLAN\n\nAlthough Caleb was called into the Republic of Ireland squad during his time with the club, it wasn’t until after his half a million pounds move to Hull City in August 2007 that he played international football. Whilst at the KC Stadium he had a spell on loan at Middlesbrough before travelling to America to continue his career.\n\nTo date (August 2012), he is still plying his trade at Colorado Rapids and has played 7 times for his country without scoring.\n\nCHARLES N’ZOGBIA\n\nAlthough Charles had represented France at Under 21’s level on thirteen occasions prior to a £6.000.000 move from Newcastle United to Latics on 30th June 2009, he hadn’t made a senior appearance. However, in August 2010, N’Zogbia was called up to the senior team for the first time by new manager Laurent Blanc for the team’s friendly against Norway on 11 August 2010 where he made his international debut.\n\nAs at January 2012 he has represnted Les Blue trwice, scoring once, despite joining Aston Villa in July 2011 to improbe his international cap count.\n\nCHARLIE SPENCER\n\nPlayed twice for England whilst at Newcastle United. He was in fact one of the first two England players to make their International debuts at Wembley. He won his first cap in a game against Scotland that resulted in a 1-1 draw on 12th April 1924. He was of course Latics’ first ever manager and in his first four seasons at Springfield Park the Reds (as they were then) won the Cheshire County League Championship three times. Charlie, a Latics legend, left Latics in March 1937 and took over the managers job at Third Division North outfit Grimsby Town, leaving team captain Frank Hancock to become player/manager.\n\nHe later (1st May 1951) brought his Grimsby Town team to Springfield Park for a friendly game in which Tom Finney turned out for the Blues. The crowd that witnessed this game was almost 16,000, an all time Springfield Park record for a friendly game. He always had a soft spot for Latics and was tipped to return to Springfield Park in 1952 following the resignation of Jimmy Milne but the equally legendary Ted Goodier got the job. On 9th February 1953 Charlie died at his home in Blackpool at the age of fifty-four.\n\nCHRIS KIRKLAND\n\nChris Kirkland created a major piece of Latics history on 16th August 2006, when he became the first ever player to play for England whilst still a Latics player. He came on the field of play in the 46th minute as a substitute for Paul Robinson during England’s 4-0 victory over Greece at Old Trafford.\n\nThere was no one more delighted than Chris’ dad who picked up a cool ten grand as a £100 wager he made when Chris was a youngster came to fruition. Chris joined Latics on 11th July 2006 on a six month loan agreement with the deal expected to be made permanent should he stay clear of his fabled injury jinx. His first game for Latics was against Perspolis (Iran) in an Austrian training camp on 25th July 2006. Latics won the game 4-2.\n\nHe made his Latics Premiership debut against Newcastle at St James’ Park on 19th August 2006. Latics lost the game 2-1. He was selected for the England squad again for a friendly fixture against Holland on 14th November 2006, but he pulled out of the squad to be at his wife’s side as she gave birth to his daughter. Chris is currently (August 2012) plying his trade at Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nCOLIN FOWLES\n\nColin made 18 appearances for the United States of America without scoring during a seven year stint at Fort Lauderdale Strikers. From 1972 until 1975 he played for the Long Island University Brooklyn as a striker. He arrived at Springfield Park in winter 1977 on a trial during his second season playing for Fort Lauderdale Strikers, for whom he played from 1977 until 1983, in the same team as Maurice Whittle, Brian Kidd, Gerd Muller and George Best!\n\nIn 1984 he signed for Fort Lauderdale Sun who later became South Florida Sun and folded in 1985. He died on 1st September 1983 when a crazed gunman opened fire on the football pitch on which he was playing. An argument broke out between two young men, one of whom drew a gun and fired randomly at everybody all over a public park in Dade County, where Colin was playing for Lauderhill Men’s Soccer Club. Colin was hit and died instantly.\n\nHe was inducted into the Florida State Soccer association Hall of Fame in 1986. He made his one and only league appearance for Latics on December 3rd 1977 against Worksop Town at Springfield Park.\n\nDAGUI BAKARI\n\nDagui, who was born in Paris and holds a French passport, had played once and scored once for the Ivory Coast, against Guinea in May 2004, when he arrived on trial at the JJB Stadium just 12 days before the club’s first game in the Premiership. He played in a friendly game for Latics against Accrington Stanley on 3rd August 2005, in a game that resulted in a 1-1 draw. He was hoping to impress enough to play in the Premiership although he had twelve months left on his contract with RC Lens.\n\nHe didn’t impress Paul Jewell sufficiently during the game and before the week was out he had signed a one-year deal with French Ligue One outfit Nancy. He is now retired after playing 5 games for his country, netting three times.\n\nDAMIEN FRANCIS\n\nDamien, who had played just once for Jamaica, signed for Latics on 5th August 2005 from Norwich City. He signed a three-year deal and the Canaries received £1.500.000 for his services. However, shrewd Carrow Road boss Nigel Worthington also demanded a further £500,000 dependent on appearances and a further £250.000 should Latics stay in the Premiership. Not content with that but Norwich also wanted 25% of any profit on any future sale!\n\nIronically it was Latics who replaced Norwich City in the Premiership when the Canaries were relegated at the end of season 2004/05 with Damien an ever present in their side. He made his Latics League debut on 14th August 2005 against Chelsea at the JJB Stadium, a game that Latics lost 1-0. He made 16+4 Premiership appearances for the Blues, scoring once, before joining Premiership new boys Watford for a fee of £1.500.000 in July 2006. He is now retired.\n\nDANNY WILSON\n\nPlayed 24 times for Northern Ireland, scoring once whilst at Brighton and Hove Albion, Luton Town and Sheffield Wednesday. Danny arrived at Springfield Park during season 1976/77 and he made 6+2 League appearances for Latics without scoring. At the time Latics were in their penultimate season in the Northern Premier League and Danny was very ambitious and felt that he needed to further his career despite playing for his hometown club. He left Springfield Park to join Bury because they could offer him League football. Ironically the Blues were elected into the Football League at the end of the following season.\n\nAt the start of season 2000/2001 he was strongly tipped and interviewed for the vacant position of manager following John Benson’s resignation. However, the job eventually went to Bruce Rioch and Danny went on to manage Bristol City who were then Second Division rivals for the Blues, with Latics drawing first blood with a 2-0 victory on 17th August 2001, the first time Danny had been on the receiving end of a defeat, as a manager, in Wigan.\n\nHe is currently (August 2012) the manager of Sheffield United.\n\nDARIUSZ ADAMCZUK\n\nHad played 11 times for Poland, scoring once, whilst at Rangers before signing for Latics on 6th August 2001 in a three-month loan deal. He arrived at the club on the same day as Gabor Bukran, a Hungarian International. Both players made their Latics League debuts on 11th August 2001, the first day of the season, in a home game against Brentford that resulted in a 1-1 draw. He opnly played 3 League games for the Blues before returning to Rangers with a month of his loan contract still to run. On his return to Ibrox he suffered a nervous breakdown and never played professionally again.\n\nDARREN PATTERSON\n\nPlayed 17 times for Northern Ireland whilst at Crystal Palace, Luton Town and Dundee United. Darren was signed by Bryan Hamilton from West Bromwich Albion early in season 1989/90. He made his Latics League debut on 16th September 1989 (along with Steve Nugent, the youngest player to ever represent Latics) against Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road in a game which the Blues lost 0-1. He made 30+27 League appearances and scored 5 League goals before being transferred to Crystal Palace at the end of the 1991/92 season. After his spell at Selhurst Park he played for Luton Town, Dundee United, York City and Oxford United before hanging up his boots.\n\nHe is currently (August 2012) out of the game after a stint as the caretaker manager at Rotherham United.\n\nDAVID ADEKOLA\n\nDavid played twice for Nigeria, scoring on his debut in the 1990 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying game against Guinea. Nigeria eventually lost in the Final 1-0 against Algeria.\n\nHe is thought to have lied about the standard of his previous cl\n\nubs prior to joining Bury in January 1993. He did however arrive at Latics on 14th October 1994 from Bournemouth but only made 1+3 League appearances without scoring at Springfield Park. His Latics League debut (as a used substitute) came on 22nd November 1994 at the County Ground when Latics lost 0-1 to Northampton Town.\n\nHis last game for the club was ironically against Bury, his former club, at Gigg Lane on Boxing Day 1994 which resulted in a 3-3 draw.\n\nDAVE BEASANT\n\nPlayed twice as a substitute for England whilst at Nottingham Forest. He arrived at the JJB Stadium on 25th October 2002 as cover for John Filan. ended a month-long search following the enforced retirement of Stewart Kerr. He signed on a non-contract basis after being released by Bradford City. Dave holds the enviable record of being the first goalkeeper to captain a winning team at Wembley in a FA Cup Final and being the first keeper to save a penalty in the competition at the venue. Both these achievements came in the same game, the 1988 Final against Liverpool with John Aldridge the unfortunate striker having to witness Dave and his Wimbledon team mates holding the famous trophy aloft at the end of the game.\n\nDave went down in Latics history when he played his first game for the club on 12th November 2002, becoming the oldest player to play for the club. The game itself was against Non League outfit Doncaster Rovers in a Leyland Daf Vans Trophy second round game at the JJB Stadium. However, the game resulted in a 0-1 defeat for the Blues. After leaving Latics he played for Brighton and Hove Albion and Fulham before retiring in 2004.\n\nHe is currently (July 2012) a highly respected coach at the Glenn Hoddle Academy where he coaches goalkeeping and other outfield positions.\n\nDAVE WATSON\n\nDave played 12 times for England without scoring, whilst at Norwich City and Everton.

He arrived at the JJB Stadium on a three-year deal from Leicester City on 31st August 2005. The fee was £2,000,000 and the Foxes stood to make a further million dependent on David’s appearances and goal scoring record in what was Latics’ first season in the Premiership.\n\nHe made his Latics League debut on 10th September 2005 at the Hawthorns against West Bromwich Albion. In what was a dream debut he scored his first goal for the club in the 40th minute in a game that resulted in a 2-1 win for Latics. Even sweeter for David was the fact that the player he had replaced in the Latics team (Nathan Ellington) was in the losing Baggies team. On 8th October 2005 he played for his country again (bringing his tally up to 41) as a substitute during a World Cup qualifier against Cyprus, a game the Irish won 1-0 (away from home).\n\nHe is currently (August 2012) out of the game after playing on the South Coast for Southampton, helping them win promotion to the Premier League. His international career is over.\n\nDAVID COTTERILL\n\nPlayed 3 times for Wales whilst with Bristol City despite only being eighteen years of age, in fact, he is the youngest player to ever represent the Welsh senior side. He was signed by Paul Jewell on 31st August 2006 from the Ashton Gate outfit for a fee of £2.000.000, a fee that raised quite a few eyebrows at the time, given Cotterill’s lack of top flight experience.\n\nHowever, he was a very talented striker and was about to sign for Norwich City earlier in the day before Latics gazumped the move! He made his Latics Premiership debut on 9th September 2006 against Portsmouth at Fratton Park. He came onto the field of play as a 78th minute substitute for Gary Teale as Latics went down 0-1. He made 7+11 league appearances for the Blues before signing for Sheffield United in July 2008 following a spell on loan at the latter end of the previous season.\n\nHe is currently (August 2012) at Doncaster Rovers.

Also making their debuts with him were then record signing Chris Lightfoot and the now legendary ‘Three Amigos’. He only made 3 League appearances before being released and joining the Non League ranks with Leigh RMI.\n\nHe is currently (August 2012) the Manchester City academy goalkeeping coach.\n\nDAVID UNSWORTH\n\nPlayed for England once whilst at Everton. He was signed by Wigan Athletic manager Paul Jewell on 5th January 2007 on a free transfer from Sheffield United until the end of the season as cover for Andy Webster who joined Rangers on loan on the same day. He made his Latics Premiership debut on 13th January 2007 against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, where an injury ravaged Latics side was beaten 4-0.\n\nHis last game for Latics was the epic last day game against Sheffield United which the Blues needed to win to stay in the Premiership. They went on to win the game 2-1 and it was David’s spot kick that won the game for Latics by 2-1! In total he made 6+3 Premiership appearances for Latics, scoring once. Four days later he was released, along with Arjan De Zeeuw, by new manager Chris Hutchings.\n\nDENNIS LAWRENCE\n\nDennis made 89 appearances and scored five times for Trinidad an Tobago in a career that took in Caledonia AIA, Defence Force, Wrexham, Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and San Juan Jabloteh.\n\nHe arrived at the DW Stadium as the assistant first team coach in the summer of 2010 having previously worked with manager Roberto Martinez in a similar capacity at Swansea City.\n\nDENNY LANDZAAT\n\nPlayed 37 times for Holland, scoring once, whilst with Willem II, AZ Alkmaar, Wigan Athletic and Feyenoord. He arrived at the JJB Stadium on 18th July 2006 in a £3.000.000 deal from AZ Alkmaar, for whom he was the team captain.

His only cap was won on 12th May 1965 in a 1-0 win against West Germany. His claim to fame was scoring the winning goal for Everton in the FA Cup Final against Sheffield Wednesday in 1966. He was signed for a £2,000 fee from Preston North End by manager Gordon Milne at the start of season 1970/71 which culminated in Latics winning the Northern Premier League.\n\nHe made 39+1 Northern Premier League appearances and scored 9 League goals before leaving Springfield Park the following season. Derek who is 63 now (2002/03) is looking forward to retirement from his job of selling cleaning chemicals for a firm just outside Liverpool. He is awaiting an operation to replace one of his kneecaps. He is pictured here in his Everton days.\n\nEAMON O’KEEFE\n\nPlayed 5 times for the Republic of Ireland whilst at Everton and Port Vale. He was signed for a then club record fee of £65,000 from Everton in January 1982. He made his Latics League debut on 30th January 1982 against Northampton Town at the County Ground which Latics won 3-2 with Eamon scoring one of the goals.\n\nDuring his time at Springfield Park he made 56+2 League appearances and scored 25 League goals and he left the club to join Port Vale at the end of the 1982/83 season.\n\nEMMERSON BOYCE\n\nEmmerson was signed by Paul Jewell for an undisclosed fee (believed to be around £1.500.000) from Crystal Palace on 31st July 2006. He put pen to paper on a four year deal, teaming up once again with Fitz Hall, who Latics had signed from Palace the previous month.\n\nHe was surprisingly called up to the Barbados squad in March 2008. He made his debut for the ‘Barjans’ on 26th March 2008 against Dominica in Bridgetown in a pre World Cup qualifier which Barbados won 1-0. As at the end of season 2007/08 he had made 60+1 Premiership appearances for the Blues without scoring and he is a key member of the 2010/11 squad.

(His goal in the home game against Bolton Wanderers was chalked off at the end of the campaign as a Premiership panel decided to award the goal as an own goal to Nicky Hunt). However, his contributions during the season’s games are said by many to have kept Latics in the Premiership that season. On 8th September 2007 he once again played for England, three years after earning his previous cap, due to his continued excellent club form.\n\nHe starred in a 3-0 victory over Israel at Wembl\n\ney in a Euro 2008 qualifier. Just four days later he earned another England cap in a 3-0 demolition of Russia, bringing his international appearances up to 45 games played, 5 goals scored.
