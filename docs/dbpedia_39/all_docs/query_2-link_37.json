        "text": "The club was formed in 1967 from the merger of two local clubs: Aspida Xanthi, who was founded in 1922 and was the club of the most popular layers of the region (the \"blues\" in 1961 had become champions in the Northern League of Beta Ethniki, losing the accession from Panelefsiniakos in the barrage game) and Orfeas Xanthi, who was founded in 1903 and was the bourgeoisie of the city. From 1957 to 1964, Orfeas competed in the Northern Group of the Beta Ethniki (which held in 3 groups). The derby of the two teams was the most characteristic, with the city divided into two in each encounter.\n\nIn June 1967, with the Greek military junta in government, the movements in Xanthi were also made to create a team that would unite the dynamics of the two clubs, while the national championships were reorganized. The strengthening of the region in sport at that time had also taken place in other parts of the country and at the same time AO Xanthi (among other clubs) participated directly in the single second national category. Not long ago, from 1967 until 1985, the club remained in the Beta Ethniki, with all the restructuring that had suffered the class and benefited in the early years. The difficulties were great, the revenues were few, but Xanthi's stadium was always filled. The yellow and black beads of Orfeas Xanthi and the shades of Aspida Xanthi, have brought the red of AO Xanthi, which has joined and united the city for many years. Those years were different, difficult, but \"sweet\". Without the abundance of images, the imagination was rampant, transforming footballers into \"holy monsters\" of the sport. Something that apply for all teams. 18 years stays Xanthi Football Club on the stadiums of the Beta Ethniki. In this timeframe, the club generally completed the racing season under the 10th place of the scoreboard, while only in 1969–70 they had reached the 7th and the 1974–75 season in the 9th place. When they started to show how they were preparing for the jump in the top division, the 1982–83 season ended 5th, the next 4th and the 1984–85 season which was ambitious for something bigger, they were downgraded.\n\nIn 1985–86, with this new administration of Mr. Kokkalas, Xanthi was reformed and returned stronger. First title in the Gamma Ethniki in 1985–86, followed by another three seasons in the Beta Ethniki until the big dream came true. From the 8th and 11th places of '87 and '88 respectively, in the summer of 1989 the city and the club lived unforgettable moments by conquering the title of the Beta Ethniki and at the same time the historic rise in the big lounges. In one year, Xanthi had first goal scorer Achilleas Adamopoulos with 30 goals.\n\nThe first experiences in the Alpha Ethniki were unique, difficult and unforgettable. With enthusiasm, passion and a \"hot\" atmosphere at the stadium, the basic goal of staying in the early years was achieved with a lot of stress. Mr Kokkala's administration first brought foreign footballers, with the Brazilians Marcelo Veridiano and Sandro making the start and following others. Especially Marcelo, he has a special place in the heart of the fans, as he still continues to be the top scorer of the club. Despite the anxiety and the result justifying the efforts, Xanthi remained until October 1991 in the Alpha Ethniki and with the same profile.\n\nDuring the chairmanship of Theodoros Kokkalas, Xanthi had already managed to win two championships in the Gamma and Beta Ethniki to advance to the Alpha Ethniki. Skoda's Greek importer, Viamar S.A., became the team's title sponsor as they were renamed \"Skoda Xanthi\". The arrangement was finalised on 10 October 1991.\n\nThe modern history of Xanthi brings broadly the signature of the great shareholder of the club, Christos Panopoulos, who is already the most long-lasting owner in Greek football, keeping the club to the same high standards that he has set since his first days at the leading peak of Xanthi, as he is called since 2016, when the cooperation with Skoda was ended and the club's name returned to its original.\n\nAlso, while several companies perceive marketing as a feature of impressions, Xanthi has been successful since Christos Panopoulos took over this business. In 1991, Xanthi giving its solutions in the economic field and at the same time becoming a rising-initially-and constant force afterwards. They were the first club that established for many years in the 1990s the award of its best Player of the Year, with a donation of a sponsor car. It was the first provincial club that in 1994 had organized an international tournament at the Xanthi Ground with the participation of Coventry City, Portsmouth and AEK Athens. That same year he had brought coach Howard Kendall, who a few months earlier was a coach in Everton. In 2005, the world's top football player, Pelé, launched its sports center and its new stadium Xanthi FC Arena, giving the world glamor to the event. In the same year, on 7 July, Xanthi announced one of the biggest transfers in its history, the Brazilian defensive midfielder Emerson.\n\nBill Papas paid US$15 million to buy the club. Since 2021 Xanthi has come in the media spotlight in Australia as Bill Papas who ran Forum Group is alleged to have defrauded 400 million Australian dollars. On 7 June 2022, it was reported that Papas’ shares in the club were frozen by Greek authorities. On the 19th September 2022, Xanthi F.C. announced that the club resigned from the Super League Greece 2 due to financial issues. Papas stated that he was unable to sell the club or find alternate ways of funding the side for over 9 months."
