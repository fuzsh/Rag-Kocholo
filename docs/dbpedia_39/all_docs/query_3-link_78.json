        "text": "For many, the European soccer leagues are the most attractive in the world. Although in Latin America soccer is very important both culturally and socially, there are many who aim to cross the ocean to take a quality leap in their careers, either as a footballer or a coach.\n\nThis time we will do a brief review of those Latino coaches who, thanks to their experience in this sport, are working hard to leave the name of their country on the bench. Having a coaching career in the old continent is complicated, but they have undoubtedly shown that anything is possible.\n\nMauricio Pochettino – Paris Saint-Germain (France)\n\nWith a respectable career as a professional player, Pochettino got his coaching license in 2008 and did his practices as the third in command of RCD Espanyol women. In 2009 the Argentine took command of the Catalan team and managed to save it from relegation , which led to its renewal for three more seasons. His jump to the Premier League took place in January 2013 with Southampton, ending that season in eighth place. Then, Tottenham Hotspur gave him an opportunity that he did not miss, achieving great results since the 2014 season that led him to a Champions League final in 2019. Now, his destiny is linked to the Parisian team until 2022.\n\nMarcelo Bielsa – Leeds United (England)\n\nEl Loco is a reference not only in South America but also worldwide. His style of play, work methods and philosophy have served as inspiration for several elite coaches such as Diego Simeone and Pep Guardiola, and even for his closest disciples such as Jorge Sampaoli, Mauricio Pochettino, or Eduardo Berizzo. Bielsa's career is worthy of admiration and study, as he has gone from directing the teams of Argentina and Chile, to being on the benches of clubs like Athletic Bilbao and Marsella. In 2018 he arrived at Leeds, a club that was in the English second division and to which he managed to promote him to the Premier League for this 2020-2021 season.\n\nDiego Simeone – Atlético de Madrid (Spain)\n\nThe footballer's claw keeps him in his role as a coach, which has been more than fruitful in the 9 years he has been in charge of Atlético. Let us remember that before landing in Spain he directed clubs such as Racing, Estudiantes, River Plate, San Lorenzo, and Catania. El Cholo managed to place the mattress team back in the European arena, winning up to seven trophies and reaching two Champions League finals. For this season he is the main candidate to stay with the Spanish league.\n\nManuel Pellegrini – Real Betis (Spain)\n\nThe Engineer is one of the most respected South American coaches in Europe thanks to his excellent career. With titles in Chile, Ecuador, Argentina and England, the Chilean strategist has had the opportunity to sit on the benches of clubs such as River Plate, Real Madrid and Manchester City. After leaving West Ham at the end of 2019, Pellegrini assumed the mission of leading an ambitious project with Real Betis for this 2020-2021 campaign.\n\nAlso read: The goalkeepers of the 5 major leagues with the most saves in 2020\n\nEduardo Coudet – Celta de Vigo (Spain)\n\nAnother ex-footballer who had an extensive career for various teams between America and Europe. The Argentine started on the benches in 2015 with CA Rosario and two years later went to Club Tijuana. His first two titles were achieved with Racing Club in the 2018-2019 season, something that prompted him to be signed by the International of Brazil at the beginning of 2020. Given the bad start to the season of Celta in LaLiga, and because it is a well-known and well-known person in the club , he was called in early November to take over and change the face of the team.\n\nJorge Almirón – Elche CF (Spain)\n\nThe Argentine-Mexican lives his first experience in Europe after passing through Asia with Al Shabad Riyadh, where he finished seventh in the 2019-2020 season. To his credit, he has three titles while he directed Lanús, in addition to a great career with Argentine, Mexican, and Colombian clubs. Now, he plays an important role in Spain with a newly promoted club like Elche, which will try to keep him in the First Division.\n\nPablo García – PAOK (Greece)\n\nWith a brilliant career as a footballer (wearing the colors of Real Madrid, Osasuna, and Celta de Vigo), the Uruguayan retired in 2014 while he was part of Skoda Xanthi in the Greek second division. His beginnings as a coach began in 2015 when he was a technical assistant in the PAOK U-17 category, going on to direct the club's U-20 category the following year, finally assuming command of the first team in October 2020.\n\nHernán Losada – Beerschot VA (Belgium)"
