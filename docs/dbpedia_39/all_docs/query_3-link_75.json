        "text": "Middlesbrough defender Abel Xavier has protested his innocence over his failed drugs test and promised he never \"intentionally doped\" himself.\n\nThe 32-year-old Portuguese international tonight released a statement confirming that his 'A' sample had tested positive following his side's 0-0 Uefa Cup draw with Skoda Xanthi in Greece on September 29.\n\nXavier's 'B' sample will be tested next week and the player has agreed to undergo a series of further tests in a bid to clear his name.\n\nThe statement from the player read:\n\n\"As agreed with my employer, Middlesbrough FC yesterday evening informed the press that in the anti-doping control I had to undergo after the above-mentioned UEFA Cup match, I tested positive. I hereby confirm this fact.\n\n\"This positive test result was found in the A-sample. In the course of next week, the B-sample will be analysed.\n\n\"I am convinced that there is a reasonable and entirely harmless explanation for such positive finding, should it be confirmed by the analysis of the B-sample.\n\n\"In order to furnish this proof, I currently undergo a number of tests in which certain of my body fluids and tissues are analysed.\n\n\"Given the fact that the anti-doping regulations establish a purely objective responsibility (the athlete is guilty as of the moment when the most minor trace of a prohibited substance is found in his body), I currently have - and this is not easy - to furnish scientific and factual proof to establish that if a prohibited substance is found in my body, this is by no means because I would have had the intention to 'dope' myself. I have never had this intention.\n\n\"I sincerely trust, ladies and gentlemen of the press, that you understand that this work is not easy and assume that I am given the time to conduct the above-mentioned research and analyses under the best possible conditions. In this context, I am therefore not in a position to communicate with the press in more detail for the time being.\n\n\"However, I will certainly do so as soon as possible in order to prove, as I hope, my innocence, and my good faith.\""
