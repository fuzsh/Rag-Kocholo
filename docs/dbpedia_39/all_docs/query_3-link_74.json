        "text": "Grant Gordon Smith (born 5 May 1980 in Irvine) is a Scottish footballer midfielder. He is the son of former Rangers and Brighton & Hove Albion striker and former Scottish Football Association chief executive Gordon Smith.\n\nSmith signed a short-term contract with Dundee United in September 2006, agreeing to stay until the next transfer window in January 2007. Smith also played for English sides Bristol City and Walsall (on loan).\n\nSmith then signed one-year contract with Finnish club HJK Helsinki in April 2007.\n\nSmith returned to Britain in January 2008 and joined Carlisle United on a short-term contract until the end of the season, after training with the club’s squad. On 8 April 2009 Grant Smith was released from Carlisle United by mutual consent after not making a single first team appearance under new boss Greg Abbott who later denied any fall out with Smith even though impressing in reserve games out of position.\n\nHe went to Singapore for trials with some of the local S-League teams for the 2010 season. He was brought to Singapore by the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) as part of their centralised scouting system of foreign players for S-League clubs\n\nOn 18 December 2009, he signed a short term injury replacement deal with North Queensland Fury in the A-League linking up with Fury manager Ian Ferguson and Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler.In February 2010, Smith returned to Scotland to sign for Ross County. After joining Scottish 2nd Division club Airdrie United in January 2011, he was released by them a few months later in May.\n\nThe following report is from the BBC sport.\n\nDavid Sloan, (born 28 October 1941), is a former Northern Irish professional footballer who played for Scunthorpe United, Oxford United and Walsall. He also made two international appearances for Northern Ireland while at Oxford United, in the process becoming the first player to receive an international cap whilst at the club.\n\nThe following is taken from Northern Ireland Footballing Greats.\n\nDavid Sloan\n\nName: David Sloan\n\nBorn: 28 October 1941, Lisburn\n\nHeight: 5.07 ft\n\nWeight: 12.07 st\n\nPosition: Winger\n\nRepresentative Honours: Northern Ireland: 2 Full Caps (1968-1970), 1 Under-23 Cap (1964), 2 Amateur Caps / 1 Goal (1962-1963), 1 Youth Cap.\n\nClub Honours: (with Oxford) Football League Division Three Champion 1967/68.\n\nClub Career:\n\nTeams Seasons Signed Fee League FA Cup FL Cup Others Bangor – – Amateur – – – – Scunthorpe United 63/64-67/68 Nov-63 – 133 (3)/42 4(0)/0 5(0)/0 – Oxford United 67/68-72/73 Feb-68 £9,500 166 (6)/28 7(3)/1 15(0)/4 1(0)/0 Walsall 73/74-74/75 Jul-73 Free 44 (5)/ 5 2(0)/0 20(1)/4 – TOTALS – £9.500 343(14)/76 13(3)/1 20(1)/4 1(0)/0\n\nBiography:\n\nA tenacious but skilful player, Dave Sloan also packed a powerful shot. Until his early-20s he worked in the shipyard and played amateur football with Bangor. In September 1963 Sloan won his second amateur international cap, against England at the Oval – he scored the winning goal to give Ireland there first win in that fixture for ten years and push the Irish towards the Home Nations Amateur Championship.\n\nA little over a month after that match against England, Sloan was transferred to Scunthorpe United. He starred right across the forward line for the Iron, but normally on the right wing. An effective goalscorer, he scored a hattrick against Grimsby on the way to a seasonal total of 14 in 1965/66.\n\nEarly good form for Scunthorpe saw Sloan add an Under-23 cap to those he had previously won at Youth and Amateur level as he played at inside-right in a 3-3 draw with Wales in February 1964. He had to wait another four years, until after a move to Oxford United, to appear in a full international.\n\nIn five years at the Manor Ground Sloan’s continued all-effort displays made him popular with the fans and in 1968 he scored the goal that clinched the Third Division title. In all he won two Northern Ireland caps while with the Us and was proud to take to the field with stars such as George Best, Pat Jennings and Derek Dougan all of whom were playing at a much higher level than he was.\n\nAfter finishing his League career with two years at Walsall, Sloan worked as a steelworker in Scunthorpe and later as a caretaker at a primary school in Burton. In 2004 Sloan hit the headlines when, 34 years after his last appearance, he finally received his international caps.\n\nSloan’s Lost Caps\n\nRage-Online – Oxford Career in Detail\n\nNorthern Ireland Cap Details:\n\n10-09-1968 Israel A W 3-2 FR\n\n11-11-1970 Spain.

Although born in Scotland, Sinclair spent his career in England, with the majority of his appearances coming with Bristol City, Stoke City and Chester City.\n\nCapped by Scotland at youth and schoolboy level, Sinclair joined Nottingham Forest as an apprentice from Stirling Boys Club and he signed professional forms in November 1982. However he failed to make a first-team appearance for the City Ground club and it was in a loan spell with Division Four side Wrexham in the closing stages of the 1983–84 season that Sinclair gained his first Football League action. Over the following two seasons he spent time on loan with Derby County, Sheffield United and Leeds United without making the first-team, but he was snapped up on a permanent basis by Leeds in June 1986 for £10,000. He made eight league appearances the following season before twice joining Halifax Town on loan.\n\nIn September 1989 Sinclair moved to Bristol City, who he helped win promotion from Division Three in his first season at Ashton Gate. By the early stages of the 1991–92 campaign he was out on loan again though, spending time with Walsall before beginning a five-year stay with Stoke City in a £25,000 move in November 1991. Sinclair faced regular competition for the goalkeeper’s shirt with Stoke but played more than 20 games in his first three seasons at the club.\n\nAfter falling out of favour, Sinclair joined Chester City on a free transfer in August 1996. After conceding just 43 goals in 1996–97, Chester qualified for the Division Three play-offs with Sinclair voted the club’s player of the season. The Blues lost to Swansea City in the semi-finals and the following season saw Sinclair miss 13 league games following the emergence of Wayne Brown. He was not selected again after a 5–0 thrashing at Exeter City on 4 April 1998 and manager Kevin Ratcliffe announced later in the month that Sinclair’s contract would not be renewed. Sinclair never played professionally again after leaving Chester and has spent most of his time working as goalkeeping coach with Stoke City (where he initially was registered again as a player). He became the assistant academy manager before moving to Aston Villa to become the academy goalkeeping coach.\n\nHe has also played non-league football with Leek Town and Witton Albion. Sinclair in recent times has continued to pull on his gloves and regularly appears in charity games and alongside former team-mates in the Masters series\n\nThe following came from Leeds United FC History.\n\nSinclair: Ronald McDonald (Ronnie)\n\n1986-1989 (Player Details)\n\nGoalkeeper\n\nBorn: Stirling: 19-11-1964\n\nDebut v Blackburn Rovers (a): 23-08-1986\n\n5’10” 11st 9lb (1987)\n\nHe went to Nottingham Forest from school and was signed as a professional in October 1982. He did not get a first-team break at the City Ground, but was loaned to Wrexham in March 1984, figuring in eleven League games and playing in the Welsh Cup Final that year against Shrewsbury Town. He was also loaned to Derby County, in November 1984, Sheffield United, in August 1985 and Leeds in March 1986, but never played a League game for any of them. He was impressive at Leeds and was signed on a free-transfer in June 1986. A Scottish Schoolboy and Youth International, Sinclair was deputy to Mervyn Day in his time at Leeds. However, his chances were few and in March 1987 he was loaned to Halifax Town for four games. He returned to Halifax in 1988-89 for another brief loan spell in which he played ten League games. Sinclair moved to Bristol City in September 1989 on a free transfer and played forty-four League games in just under two seasons. Yet another loan period followed, at Walsall in September 1991, where he had ten League games, but he enjoyed his longest spell of first team football at Stoke City, whom he joined in November 1991 for £25,000. He featured in the Potters’ 1992-93 Second Division Championship-winning team, before going on loan to Bradford City in August 1994. However, he then forced his way back into Stoke’s first team midway through that season. He was released by Stoke City at the end of the 1995-96 season, after playing a total of eighty League appearances, two as substitute. He joined Chester City in August 1996, where he made seventy appearances before leaving in June 1998. He then had spells at Cardiff City and Stoke City without getting any League games. He later played with Non-League Leek Town and Witton Albion and was goalkeeping coach at Stoke City.\n\nAppearances Goals League 8 0 League Cup 1 0\n\nWilliam Sheppard (c. 1906 – 27 December 1950) was an English professional footballer. He was capable of playing as both an inside and outside forward.\n\nBorn in Ferryhill, County Durham, Sheppard started his career as an amateur in County Durham, before joiningLiverpool in 1926.[1] He signed as a professional for Watford in 1927, who at the time were playing in the Football League Third Division South. In the 1927–28 season—his first at Watford—Sheppard scored 25 goals in all competitions, finishing as the club’s top scorer. After 39 goals in 95 Watford games, he joined QPR on a free transfer in 1930, and moved to Coventry City the following year.\n\nSheppard joined Walsall in January 1933, and one of his first games for the club was an FA Cup Third Round tie against Arsenal at Fellows Park, in front of 11,150 spectators. At the time Arsenal were competing for the First Division title, which they eventually won. Walsall were in the Third Division North. Sheppard played the game at inside right. After a goalless first half, Walsall centre-forward Gilbert Alsop scored the opening goal with a header in the second half. Five minutes later Alsop won a penalty kick, which Sheppard converted to double the team’s lead. Arsenal were unable to overturn the deficit; Walsall won the match 2–0.\n\nHe remained at Walsall until the end of the 1933–34 season. He briefly joined Chester, but returned to Walsall in October of that year, before leaving permanently in June 1935.Season 1935–36 saw him at Tunbridge Wells Rangers in the Southern League.Sheppard died in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, during a Christmas celebration in 1950.\n\nNo picture.\n\nRichard “Ricky” Sbragia (born 26 May 1956) is a Scottish former professional footballer and manager. As a coach, he spent time at Manchester United and Bolton, before joining Roy Keane’s backroom staff at Sunderland. Sbragia became manager of Sunderland following Keane’s departure, although he himself resigned in 2009 after guiding them to safety in the Premier League. Sbragia spent the next two years as a scout at Sunderland, before leaving in 2011. Sbragia was born in Lennoxtown, East Dunbartonshire and is of Italian descent. He started his footballing career with Birmingham City as an apprentice in June 1972. He signed as a professional at the club in May 1974 and made his debut during the 1974–75 season. He joined Morton on loan in the Scottish Football League during the 1975–76 season and made four appearances. He was unable to establish himself in the first team at Birmingham and after making 15 appearances and scoring one goal, he joined Walsall in October 1978 for a fee of £15,000. He won promotion with Walsall in the 1979–80 season after the team finished second in the Fourth Division, before making a move to Third Division side Blackpool for £35,000 in July 1980. After making 26 appearances and scoring one goal during two seasons at Blackpool, he was signed up by Denis Smith at York City in August 1982. His debut came on the opening day of the 1982–83 season on 28 August 1982 in a 1–1 with Torquay United at Bootham Crescent. He finished the season as an ever-present with 52 appearances in all competitions and scored a goal in a 2–2 draw against Halifax Town. He struck up a partnership with John MacPhail in defence during the 1983–84 season, when York won the Fourth Division with 101 points. He scored York’s equaliser against Liverpool in the FA Cup fifth round on 20 February 1985, which set up a lucrative replay at Anfield. Sbragia suffered from a back injury during this match and had surgery on a spinal disc herniation. He joined Darlington on loan in August 1985 and made six appearances for the team. At the end of his playing career, he played one game for Belfast side Linfield in an exhibition match against Glentoran, where he went on to score two goals\n\nHe retired from playing in 1987 and commenced his coaching career with York as youth-team coach and obtained his Football Association coaching badge in May 1990. He led the youth team to the quarter-finals of the FA Youth Cup for the first time in the 1992–93 season. He took over as youth-team coach at Sunderland in 1994 and was later promoted to reserve team coach. He moved to Manchester United as reserve team coach on 20 November 2002, where he built up a successful reserve side, nurturing the fledgling talents of Kieran Richardson and Darren Fletcher, amongst others. He was appointed as first-team coach of Bolton Wanderers on 10 October 2005. After the departure of Sam Allardyce from Bolton on 29 April 2007, Sammy Lee was appointed as manager of Bolton, with Sbragia retaining his position as first-team coach alongside Jimmy Phillips and Gary Speed.\n\nRicky at York City.\n\nSbragia rejoined Sunderland’s coaching staff in November 2007, and was appointed as caretaker manager following the departure of Roy Keane on 4 December 2008. He took charge of the team for their match against Manchester United, which was lost 1–0. This was followed up with a 4–0 victory over West Bromwich Albion and a 4–1 win at Hull City, although Sbragia remained coy over the possibility of taking over permanently. He was appointed as manager on a permanent basis on 27 December on an 18-month contract. On 24 May 2009, after guiding Sunderland to Premier League survival on the final day of the season, Sbragia resigned as manager of the club. He remained at Sunderland as chief scout, a post which he held until April 2011. Sbragia was appointed head coach of the Scotland national under-17 team in August 2011. He was moved up with the Scotland national under-17 team to coach the Scotland national under-19 team for the 2012–13 season. Sbragia took temporary charge of the Scotland national under-21 team in November 2014\n\nHector McLeod Sam (born 25 February 1978) is a Trinidadian international footballer striker who plays for TT Pro League side Central FC.\n\nHe spent eight years as a professional player in the English Football League, most significantly playing a total of 176 games for Welsh club Wrexham between 2000 and 2005, helping them to league and cup success. After spending a season on the sidelines at Port Vale following a broken leg, he signed with Walsall in 2006. Following the club’s promotion he switched to Notts County, before leaving the professional game in 2008. Either side of his adventures in the UK he played for hometown club San Juan Jabloteh.In a six-year international career he scored two goals in twenty appearances, helping his country to qualify for the2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nGrowing up with Marvin Andrews in San Juan, Sam attended Queen’s Royal College in Trinidad for a short stint, before beginning his career at Port of Spain based San Juan Jabloteh. He moved to the United Kingdom to play forWelsh club Wrexham in the summer of 2000. There he teamed up with fellow Trinidad internationals Carlos Edwards and later Dennis Lawrence.He made his Football League debut on 12 August 2000, playing a Second Division game at the Racecourse Ground against Bristol City, which finished in a 2–0 win for the visitors. Seven days later he scored his first goal for the club in a visit to Gigg Lane; Sam scored the second goal of a 4–1 hammering of Bury. He then went on to strike five times in his next five games, putting one past Wigan Athletic, Rotherham United and Colchester United, as well as a brace past Oldham Athletic. However he failed to score in the rest of his sixteen games that season. The young international made 33 appearances in 2001–02. He scored five league goals, one each away at Wigan, Peterborough United,Cardiff City, as well as a brace upon his return to Gigg Lane. His exploits were not enough to save the club from relegation to the Third Division.Wrexham went straight back up in 2002–03, Sam making 32 appearances and scoring another five goals. His goals came against Oxford United, Macclesfield Town,Swansea City, Hartlepool United and Carlisle United. He was transfer listed by manager Denis Smith in May 2003, despite penning a two-year deal two months previous. The 2003–04 season was one of Sam’s strongest. He scored twelve times in 41 games, managing to score twice in one game on two occasions – against Blackpool and Luton Town. In January 2004 Rotherham United manager Ronnie Moore expressed an interest in signing him, though nothing came of it. In 2004–05 he again scored twelve times, though this was not enough to save Wrexham from the drop – thanks to them being deducted ten points for entering administration. His first competitive hat-trick in the English game came on 10 August at Boundary Park, as he scored all of Wrexham’s goals in a 3–2 win over Oldham. He also picked up his first sending off, seeing red against Huddersfield Town on 27 November at the Galpharm Stadium, he received the red just three minutes after replacing Juan Ugarte (the sending over was later overturned upon appeal). In March 2005, he scored his seventh career goal against Oldham, though accepted he was now a ‘super-sub’ at Wrexham. His twelve goals earned the club eleven points, they would have been saved if it were not for administration. He was an unused substitute in the club’s 2005 Football League Trophy success. At the end of the season he signed for Port Vale, who themselves had narrowly avoided relegation.\n\nAfter three appearances in August 2005 he broke his leg, and had to wait until April 2006 to take to the field again. The injury limited him to just five appearances in2005–06, and at the end of the campaign he dropped down to League Two to sign with Vale’s West Midlands rivals Walsall. He scored seven goals in a massive 47 appearances in 2006–07, as the club went up as champions. Despite this he was let go at the end of the season. He was subsequently signed by Notts County in May 2007. County had a disappointing 2007–08, finishing just six points off relegated Mansfield Town – and eight points ahead of his old club Wrexham. He made 24 appearances before being dropped in January, scoring just two goals, one against Hereford United and the other against Histon in the FA Cup. He left the club by mutual agreement in March 2008.\n\nReturning to his homeland, in January 2009 he re-joined old club San Juan Jabloteh, signing in time for the start of the 2009 season. Jabloteh finished the campaign as runners-up to Joe Public. This was followed by a disappointing sixth place finish in 2010–11. He later joined Central FC, who finished fifth in 2012–13 and 2013–14 under the management of Terry Fenwick .Sam was named as a backup player for the Trinidad and Tobago national team in the 2006 World Cup. He might have made the final cut if he was not recovering from a broken leg. He made his debut for the “Soca Warriors” in 1999 and earned a total of twenty caps in a six-year stint, scoring two goals."
