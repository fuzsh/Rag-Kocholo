        "text": "August 5, 2024 - MLS NEXT Pro (MLS NEXT Pro)\n\nThe Town FC News Release\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. - The Town FC, the San Jose Earthquakes' second team in MLS NEXT Pro, announced today that assistant coach Jordan Stewart has been appointed head coach of USL Championship club Monterey Bay FC and will begin his new role effective immediately.\n\n\"Jordan has served our club well for many years in a variety of facets, both on the field as a player, and later on the sideline as a coach with our Academy and second team,\" said Earthquakes general manager Chris Leitch. \"He has a great coaching career ahead of him. We want to thank him for his contributions to the San Jose Earthquakes and wish him all the best in this new opportunity with Monterey Bay FC.\"\n\nA native of Birmingham, United Kingdom, Stewart represented England internationally at the Under-21 and Under-18 levels. He began his professional career primarily playing for various English clubs in the Premier League, The Championship and League One - namely Leicester City and Watford, where he made over 100 appearances with each club. After playing well over a decade in England (1999-2013) and a brief stint in the Greek Super League in between with Skoda Xanthi (2010-11), the standout defender made the move stateside in 2013 to San Jose.\n\nStewart played in 71 Major League Soccer regular-season matches for the Earthquakes through 2016, starting 68 of them as a defender and notching three assists. Following his playing days, he joined the Quakes Academy in 2022 as an assistant coach.\n\nLast season, Stewart, 42, was elevated to the club's second team, Earthquakes II, to serve as an assistant on head coach Dan DeGeer's staff. Quakes II made the MLS NEXT Pro Playoffs for the first time in 2023 and advanced to the Western Conference Semifinals. The team is now known as The Town FC.\n\nThis season, The Town FC currently stands in playoff position, ranking seventh place in the MLS NEXT Pro Western Conference with a 7-6-6 record (30 points).\n\nâ€¢ Discuss this story on the MLS NEXT Pro message board...\n\nMLS NEXT Pro Stories from August 5, 2024\n\nInter Miami CF II Heads North to Face Carolina Core on Wednesday - Inter Miami CF II\n\nThe Town FC Assistant Coach Jordan Stewart Named Monterey Bay FC Head Coach - The Town FC\n\nColorado Rapids 2 Named MLS NEXT Pro Team of Matchweek 21 for 2-1 Performance over Houston Dynamo 2 - Colorado Rapids 2\n\nCarolina Core FC Sign Midfielder Ozzie Ramos - Carolina Core FC\n\nHuntsville City FC Appoints Inter Miami CF U-17 Coach Chris O'Neal as Head Coach - Huntsville City Football Club\n\nTimbers2 Claim Three Points at the Death in Win over the Town FC - Portland Timbers 2\n\nReal Monarchs Fall to LAFC on the Road - Real Monarchs"
