        "text": "Nice find. I think you meant this for the last link(?):\n\nhttp://www.fussball-talente.com/Bild_einsenden-3_24-114066-1.html\n\n2nd from the right in the back row:\n\nTransfermarkt now says two U19s at Ludwigshafener SC in Germany are \"Amis.\" One is Marcus Hawk, who I've had on a watchlist for a while (he was at Kaiserslautern at one time), and the other is Malcolm Little, who I've never heard of. They are both listed with the club for the upcoming \"Saison.\"\n\nhttp://www.ludwigshafenersc.com/a1_jugendframe.htm\n\nHawk:\n\nhttp://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/marcus-hawk/profil/spieler_278129.html\n\nLittle:\n\nhttp://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/malcolm-little/profil/spieler_278135.html\n\nI started a thread for José de la Tejera here, but he problem belongs in this thread.\n\nAs pointed out by Hararea in the Youth Yanks Abroad thread in the Youth National team forum, de la Tejera's Development Academy page lists his nationality as the United States and his country of citizenship as Mexico. The Mexican league site lists his place of origin as Leon, Mexico.\n\nHe is part of the Santos Laguna U-20s\n\nSwedish Superettan club IFK Värnamo have announced on their website that they have signed a player named Phathizwe Sacolo. In their news release they describe him as american/south african and he does seem to have played some time in the u.s. but after a quick google he seems to be listed as only south african on other sites. He was also one of the guys touring with a Chicago based team in Sweden recently, looking to get signed.\n\nThanks for this. Seems unlikely, but I suppose he could have an American parent or parents. Did play some college ball here, as you noted, but came over from South Africa to do so; consequently, his American connections are unclear...\n\nWith that said, given that clubs need to know these things for passport/clearance purposes it may be true after all. I'll send the club a note and see if they response.\n\nTransfermarkt says a fellow named Michael Smith playing in Iceland for BI/Bolungarvík is American.\n\nhttp://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/michael-smith/profil/spieler_272425.html\n\nThe club doesn't seem to address it.\n\nhttp://www.bibol.is/mfl_karla/leikmenn/\n\nWiki thinks he's a Brit. There are several Brits at BI, so that wouldn't surprise me.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BÍ/Bolungarvík\n\nBut perhaps somebody here knows more about him?\n\nPretty sure we can count this guy. I think he's part of the Sonoma State/NorCal ecosystem that routinely sends guys to European teams. (Funny, I think I just looked for him a day or so a go and they hadn't updated their roster online. Nice catch.)\n\nTransfermarkt says a fellow named Mustafa Bazzi is with a club called Nejmeh in Beirut:\n\nhttp://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/mustafa-samir-bazzi/profil/spieler_286769.html\n\nCould be this guy -- Moustafa Bazzi from Michigan:\n\nhttp://www.detroittitans.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=1519\n\nHis college bio doesn't say he wasn't born in the States so it's certainly possible he's ours. Here's the club site, which I cannot read:\n\nhttp://www.nejmeh-club.com/\n\nThe player Dylan Alexis Romney, who Transfermarkt says is American, is currently on loan to Varese (Primavera I think) from Inter. Some other database sites also seem to indicate he's American, but I'm not sure how. Anybody know? (I have sent a note to Varese in hopes of finding out.)\n\nThis site has him born 8/7/92 in Dearborn, MI:\n\nhttp://www.footballdatabase.eu/football.joueurs.moustafa.bazzi.209497.en.html\n\nGood enough?\n\nThis dude (pretty reliable source) says he is a Yank:\n\nTransfermarkt lists Nigerian-born '88 striker Badum Maaloo of Germany's Waldhof Mannheim II (5th tier - Badischer Fussballerverband) as American:\n\nhttp://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/badum-maaloo/profil/spieler_255482.html\n\nAs do a couple of other sites:\n\nhttp://www.fussball-talente.com/Badum_Maaloo-3_7-129855-1.html\n\nhttp://www.cvgoal.com/en/footballer/badum-maaloo/1/\n\nFull name Badum Django Maaloo, seems like English is his first language:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NaijaRisto\n\nAny thread on him will have to take full advantage of that middle name.\n\nThere is a Badum Maaloo who came to the US at about the right age as a refugee in 1999 (see p. 10):\n\nhttp://www.ucc.org/assets/pdfs/rj.pdf\n\nI'm thinking that's probably him. Not the most common name in the US among boys that age.\n\nHe's already come up several times in the Adam Afghani thread:\n\nAdam Afghani in Germany"
