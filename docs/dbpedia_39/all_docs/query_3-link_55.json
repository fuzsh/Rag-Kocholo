        "text": "Somewhere in Eastern Europe, there is a football club with a pretty insane story behind it. It was once one of the greats on the European stage, however, that seems more like a beautiful dream nowadays. Today, the club has sunk to the second division of Romanian football, and its future looks rather bleak. Of course, I'm talking about Dinamo Bucharest (I mean the title pretty much gave that away, didn't it?).\n\nBut how did it get to this point? How did a team that once reached the semi-finals of the ECC (European Champions Cup, the old version of the UEFA Champions League) sink so low into obscurity, even by Romanian football standards? Well, its story might just be the craziest you'll ever hear. It is a story filled with controversy, betrayals, scandals, tragedy, power struggles, money issues, tax evasion, and suspected match-fixing. With that being said, let's go back to when it all began.\n\nEarly history\n\nAfter the end of World War 2, the Iron Curtain fell over Europe. Communist regimes were implemented by the Soviet Union in most of the Eastern European countries, including Romania. A lot of aspects of the country were subject to change from that point on, and football was no exception. As was the custom in the Soviet Union, both the Army and the Ministry of Internal Affairs wanted to create their own clubs. Through the forced merger of two already existing football teams, Unirea Tricolor Bucharest and Ciocanul Bucharest, the MIA created Dinamo Bucharest in 1948.\n\nIt didn't take long for the newly established Dinamo to rise to prominence. They finished 2nd in the league three years in a row, in '51, '52, and '53, after which they won the first league title in 1955 (back in those years, the league began in the spring and finished in November). As a result of this, Dinamo was allowed to participate in the second edition of the ECC, becoming the first Romanian team to take part in the competition. They knocked out Galatasaray in the first round after a 4-3 win on aggregate but were then soundly defeated by CDNA Sofia (10-4 agg.) Dinamo then won their first Romanian Cup in the '58-'59 season.\n\nThe '60s were a fruitful period for the club, winning the league title 4 times in succession ('61-'62, '62-'63, '63-'64, and '64-'65) and the cup on two occasions ('63-'64 and '67-'68.) In the '63-'64, Dinamo played Real Madrid in the round of the last 16 of the ECC, losing both legs by 3-1 and 5-3. In the home game, Dinamo gathered a crowd of a whopping 100.000 fans at the old 23 August stadium, a record that has never been broken in the arena until it got demolished years later. In the '65-'66 season, they also played Inter Milan in the same competition, even managing to win the home game 2-1. Dinamo were, however, eliminated following a 2-0 loss in Italy.\n\nThe '70s brought along more silverware in the form of 4 league titles ('70-'71, '72-'73, '74-'75, and '76-'77.) The win from '73 sparked the first controversy in the club's history (not counting its creation). The season was over, and all the matches were played, except for one: Dinamo - CFR Cluj, which, oddly enough, was initially delayed because the away team played a friendly match against Bochum. With a win, Dinamo would tie Universitatea Craiova on points and the champions would be decided by goal difference. And they did in fact win the match 4-0, by the exact goal difference needed in order to surpass Universitatea. The club and its supporters were understandably outraged by the event, which ignited the rivalry between the two teams.\n\nGlory years and the biggest controversy yet\n\nBy the beginning of the '80s, Dinamo was already a force in the Romanian football scene, alongside FC Arges Pitesti, Universitatea Craiova, and arch-rivals Steaua Bucharest. Following the rise of the communist regime, Romanian football itself grew exponentially, with its clubs now being able to rival countries like Spain, Germany, Italy, and England. Without a doubt, the '80s were the peak of their performances. While the latter half of the decade was dominated by Steaua, the first half belonged to Dinamo, with 3 more league titles being won in those years ('81-'82, '82-'83, and '83-'84.) They also won 3 cups ('81-'82, '83-'84, and '85-'86.)\n\nIn the '83-'84 season, Dinamo made it all the way to the semi-finals of the ECC, becoming the first Romanian team to reach that milestone. They kicked off their run with a win on aggregate against Kuusysi from Finland in the first round (4-0). After that, they played Hamburg, who were the reigning European Champions at the time. Dinamo smashed them 3-0 at home and went through, despite losing 3-2 away from home. In the quarter-finals, they managed to get past fellow communist side Dinamo Minsk with a 2-1 win on aggregate. After that, they met Liverpool in the semi-finals, against whom they eventually lost both legs 1-0 and 2-1. The Reds would then go on to win the competition in a final against AS Roma.\n\nTowards the end of the decade, Dinamo played in the final of the '87-'88 edition of the Romanian cup against long-time rivals Steaua. Near the end of the match, with the score tied at 1-1, Steaua managed to score again, but the goal was ruled off for offside. The players argued the decision, but the referee refused to overturn it. Steaua's players walked off the pitch in protest and never returned to finish the match. As a result, Dinamo held an improvised ceremony where the players lifted the cup, claiming to be the winners. However, Valentin Ceausescu, son of Romanian president Nicolae Ceausescu and renowned Steaua fan, decided to intervene. A few days after the final, due to huge pressure from the dictator's son and the rest of the communist party, the RFF (Romanian Football Federation) actually validated Steaua's late goal and decided the match ended 2-1, awarding them the trophy.\n\nYears later, after the fall of the communist regime, Steaua handed the trophy back to Dinamo, admitting that they didn't officially win the match. However, Dinamo officials actually refused to accept the trophy after all that had happened, leaving the Romanian cup from that year without a winner.\n\nDinamo had a good start to the '90s, winning the double in the '89-'90s season. They also played in the ECWC (European Cup Winners' Cup), beating Dinamo Tirana 2-1 on aggregate in the first round. After that, they crushed Panathinaikos after winning both legs 2-0 away and 6-1 at home. Another display of dominance took place in the quarter-finals when they beat Partizan Belgrade 4-1 on aggregate. However, they would again stop in the semi-finals when they lost both legs 1-0 against Anderlecht. After that, Dinamo only managed to win another league title in the '91-'92 season.\n\nThe fall of the communist regime and new owners - the \"fun\" begins\n\nFollowing the '89 Romanian Revolution, Nicolae Ceausescu was removed from power. After some changes in the legislation, it was decided that football clubs could no longer be financed by the state. Because of this decision, almost all of the clubs in that situation were dissolved, except for 2 of them: Steaua and Dinamo. They were \"spared\" as most of the players that played for the Romanian National team were from these two sides, and state officials were afraid that disbanding them would have damaging effects, considering that the 1990 World Cup was just months away. Both clubs had to undergo privatization in order to continue to function, however.\n\nIn '94, a newly formed association called ACS FC Dinamo Bucharest began administering the Dinamo football team (Dinamo as a whole was a complete sporting club during the communist era, competing in a lot of other sports, with the football team being just a part of the entire club; the rest of its sports are still carried out under the same CS Dinamo, the sporting club created in 1948; the football team was the only one that had to undergo privatization because of legislation regarding the sport; this is why the football team \"left\" CS Dinamo to become its own entity, now owned by ACS FC Dinamo Bucharest) The group was formed by different members of the MIA, with the businessman Nicolae Badea as chairman. In the following years, other people started joining the club as shareholders and some of them took over different positions on the club's board, with the people from the MIA eventually opting out. Out of all of those who came after '94, the only ones you need to know about and who will be mentioned again later are Cristian Borcea, Vasile Turcu, Gheorghe Netoiu, and Victor Becali. In 2001, the club would be privatized and would officially be called SC Dinamo 1948 SA, owned by ACS FC Dinamo Bucharest (I know it's confusing, but stay with me.)\n\nAt this point in time, Romanian football started a steady decline. Clubs that were formerly owned by the state or different companies during the communist era were bought by rich people who became millionaires overnight. There was no longer a serious competition between clubs, but rather a childish one between rich people who viewed their clubs as shiny new toys. And, as with every child, they would eventually grow tired of their playthings and stop financing them, leading to the disappearance of a lot of clubs with rich histories. Also, match-fixing and corruption were at an all-time high in this period, with club owners making \"deals\" with each other and bribing referees, all through the idea that \"they're too rich for anything to happen to them.\"\n\nDinamo's change in ownership wasn't really beneficial to the club, with funds being drastically lowered following the fall of communism. While we struggled in the league, even finishing 6th at one point (which was considered very low for our standards at that time), our rivals Steaua managed to clinch 6 titles in a row from '93 to '98. Our next trophies came right at the turn of the millennium in the '99-2000 season when we won the double.\n\nAs champions once again, we were now going to participate in the qualifying rounds of the rebranded UCL (UEFA Champions League.) We began our journey in the 2nd round of qualifiers against Polonia Warsaw but lost shockingly in both legs, 3-4 at home and 1-3 away. This was a huge disappointment to the fans, but especially to the owners, who were counting on reaching the group stages of the competition to receive the huge payout from UEFA.\n\nLet's divert a bit to explain why the owners were so desperate to get the UCL money. You see, one thing that the new owners didn't tell anyone about was that, since '94, the club started to gain debts, especially to private firms owned by themselves. Whenever they would pump money into the club, the cash was given as loans from their own firms. The reason why the club never got into any trouble with the RFF was that, whenever the club would apply to renew its license to keep playing in the Romanian First Division, it would do so as SC Dinamo 1948 SA. However, all the debts that the club had were under ACS FC Dinamo Bucharest, the official \"owner\" of Dinamo Bucharest. This entire mess was discovered years later by the press, by which time they were already around the range of tens of millions of Euros. So, basically, they needed the money in order to pay back the debts that the club owed to their own firms.\n\nEventually, ACS FC Dinamo Bucharest went into insolvency in 2010, and SC Dinamo 1948 SA, the actual football club, was then owned largely by Nicolae Badea himself. However, that's a story for a later time. For now, let's get back to where we left off.\n\n\"Let us prepare for the Champions League\", Cristian Borcea 2002\n\nThe 2000-2001 season was one of moderate success. After being knocked out of the UCL qualifiers, we only finished 2nd in the league table but did manage to win the Romanian Cup. Therefore, we participated in the UEFA Cup in the following season. However, that season remains in our minds for a different, more tragic reason. On October 5th, 2000, Dinamo played a friendly match away against Oltenita. During the match, Catalin Hildan, our team captain, collapsed on the pitch. Dinamo's doctor and the medical staff that were at the venue tried to resuscitate him but to no avail. Hildan passed away on that day due to a heart attack, at the age of only 24, leaving Dinamo's players, staff, board, and fans in shock. Since then, the number 11 shirt that he wore has been retired and no other player wore it since. As a final homage to him, the fans decided to name the northern stand of Dinamo's stadium, where the core of the fan base sat during matches, Peluza Catalin Hildan (PCH for short, or \"the Catalin Hildan Stand\".)\n\nPlaying in the UEFA Cup didn't have exactly the same hype as with the UCL, but the club and especially the fans were hungry for some European success, with the team being largely irrelevant in any competition since the '90 semi-finals against Anderlecht. We managed to qualify against Dinamo Tirana in the first round (4-1 agg.), but were humbled in the next one by Grasshopper Zürich (6-2 agg.) Despite this, Dinamo did get crowned as champions at the end of the season, winning their 16th league title.\n\nAt the end of the season, when all was said and done, Cristian Borcea, one of the club's shareholders had a quote that would go on to haunt every single Dinamo fan for the rest of their lives. The club officially won the title in the last fixture of the season, with a 4-0 win over FC Brasov. Following the match, when media reporters went over to Borcea to get an interview with him, his only response to them was: \"Please, let us prepare for the Champions League.\"\n\nLet's take a moment to tell you a few words to describe Dinamo's shareholders at the time. The main man, Nicolae Badea, was a quiet person who usually liked to run things outside of everyone's view. Vasile Turcu was someone with a very short temper, constantly getting into verbal altercations with people in the media. The only thing noteworthy to say about Victor Becali was that he's the cousin of the Steaua Bucharest owner, Gigi Becali, and also runs his own sports agency company alongside his brother, Ioan Becali. There's not a lot to say about Gheorghe Netoiu, other than he left his position as president of Universitatea Craiova to join Dinamo's board, while also bringing along 9 of their most prolific players with him, adding more fuel to the fire that was the rivalry between the two clubs.\n\nEven though, on paper, Badea was the man \"running the show\", Cristian Borcea was the one who people perceived as the real boss. He always appeared in interviews and articles and was by far the most vocal and flamboyant out of all the shareholders. From celebrating a goal by performing a belly dance on live TV to going into an interview and literally shouting \"It was a live massacre. A massacre, MASSACRE, MASSACRE!\" after a game (referring to the fact that the referee cost Dinamo a match through some poor decisions), he easily stood out from the rest. And, in case you couldn't already tell, he was also a very arrogant and cocky character, always viewing his club as the best in Romania and making bold statements before every match.\n\nAnyways, we were back into the UCL preliminary rounds. We started from the second qualifying round and were drawn against Club Brugge. Though the fans had high hopes for those matches, the Belgians made short work of us, winning both legs 3-1 and 1-0 respectively. This was the first of many occasions where Borcea's words would come back to bite us, the fans, in the butt, because the supporters of every other Romanian team and their mom made fun of us because of one man's arrogance. Afterward, we had a pretty bad run in the league, only managing to finish 6th. Dinamo did, however, win its 10th Romanian cup at the end of the season.\n\nIn the '03-'04 season, Dinamo participated in the UEFA Cup again. We started off strongly in the first round against Liepājas Metalurgs, winning 5-2 at home and drawing 1-1 away. After that, we met Shakhtar Donetsk, who we beat 2-0 at home and 3-2 away. Sadly, our run would stop in the 3rd round, against Spartak Moscow. Dinamo got thrashed in Russia in a 4-0 defeat and despite winning 3-1 at home, it wasn't enough to turn the tables on them. On a positive note, we did win the double (the last one to date) at the end of the season, securing both the league title and the cup.\n\nThis meant another shot at the UCL group stages in '04-'05. Dinamo started off in the 2nd round against Žilina and qualified after winning both legs 1-0. We only had one more team to get past in order to reach the group stages but unfortunately, that team would have to be Manchester United. Dinamo tried their best in the home leg in front of a 70.000+ attendance, even managing to open the score, but the difference between the two sides was far too big and the Red Devils won 2-1. In England, United won again, this time by 3-0, sending us back to the UEFA Cup (the format of this competition was changed starting with the '04-'05 season, implementing the 5-team group stages; every team that would get knocked out of the UCL 3rd round would then play in the UEFA Cup 3rd qualifying round.)\n\nOur opponents there would end up being Partizan Belgrade. The Serbians won 3-1 at home and then hold on to a 0-0 draw in Bucharest, eliminating us from the UEFA Cup as well. Things didn't go to plan in the league as well, finishing 2nd with only one point behind Steaua. We did, however, win the Romanian cup as a consolation prize.\n\nDinamo were back in the UEFA Cup in the '05-'06 season. We started the campaign in the 2nd round, narrowly winning 4-3 on aggregate against Omonia Nicosia. In the last round, we were pitted against what seemed a much tougher opponent, Everton. Despite this, Dinamo smashed the Toffees 5-1 at home and qualified for the group stages, despite losing 1-0 in England. That was a remarkable season for Romanian football as a whole, with Steaua and Rapid Bucharest also making it to the UEFA Cup group stages. Dinamo had an underwhelming start to the campaign with a 0-0 at home against Heerenveen and a 1-0 loss away to Levski Sofia. We kept our chances alive with a 1-0 victory against reigning UEFA Cup champions CSKA Moscow, but lost in dramatic fashion away at Marseille 2-1 and were ultimately eliminated. We also finished 3rd in the league table, only having won the Romanian Super Cup at the start of the season as far as silverware goes.\n\nThis season is also remembered for another controversial moment. Ioan Becali was brought in at some point as Dinamo's president. The team was doing very well in the league, sitting in 1st place with a 5-point lead over 2nd place. However, during the winter break, Becali got into a fight with then-head coach Ioan Andone and actually sacked him. After that episode, the team completely lost its form, leading to the disappointing 3rd place finish.\n\nIn the '06-'07 season, Dinamo made it into the UEFA Cup group stages again, after eliminating Hibernians from Malta, Beitar Jerusalem, and Skoda Xanthi on the way. We then continued our dominant display with a 2-1 victory at home against Besiktas, a 1-1 draw away at Club Brugge, and another 2-1 victory at home against Bayer Leverkusen, securing our place in the round of the last 32, despite a loss in the last group fixture away at Tottenham. The following spring, we came up against Benfica and unfortunately lost both matches, 1-0 away and 2-1 at home. Our dominance carried out in the league as well, having won the title with 6 matches left to play. Dinamo was simply incredible in that season and our hopes of reaching the UCL group stages were higher than ever.\n\nWe had a bit of bad luck going into the '07-'08 season. Romanian teams did really well in the last few years in European competitions and our nation's coefficient went up significantly. We even had the chance to qualify directly for the UCL group stages that season as Romanian champions, but there was a catch. As far as the qualifying spots go, Dinamo had only one chance to gain an automatic qualification into the groups: we needed the team who won the '06-'07 UCL edition to also finish high enough in their domestic league table in order to gain an automatic spot into the group stages for the '07-'08 season. The teams that reached the semi-finals that year were Chelsea, Manchester United, Liverpool, and AC Milan, and by the standings in their respective leagues, Dinamo needed Chelsea or Man Utd to win the UCL in order for the whole scenario to function. But alas, that wasn't the case as they were both eliminated and the UCL was won by AC Milan that year, so we had to go through qualifiers again.\n\nAfter Dinamo's good run in the UEFA Cup the previous season, fans were confident that we could get past any team en route to the UCL groups. And as fate would have it, we were drawn against Lazio in the 3rd round, probably the easiest out of all the opponents at the time. The hype surrounding this match was simply huge. We've played matches with the same stakes previously, but now everyone actually believed that Dinamo can pull it off. The first leg was played in Rome and Dinamo actually opened the score through Danciulescu. Lazio dominated the match, though, and even missed a penalty during the first half. In the end, they managed to equalize in the 53rd minute and the match ended 1-1.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect result, but everyone considered it to be good enough. We didn't lose and now all we needed was to beat Lazio at home. The Lia Manoliu (ex-23 August) stadium was jam-packed for the match. Everyone around the team knew that this was Dinamo's moment to shine. We opened the score in the 27th minute through Florin Bratu and the stadium \"exploded.\" Dinamo controlled the first half, with Lazio not having a single shot on goal. The UCL groups were closer than ever. And then, early in the 2nd half, we conceded a clumsy penalty and Lazio didn't miss this time around. After that, through 2 counterattacks, Lazio made it 1-3, crushing our hopes and dreams. To this day, that was one of the most painful nights for every Dinamo fan anywhere.\n\nThat match led to a lot of speculation after it was over. Many people claimed the game was thrown intentionally by Dinamo. There were 2 major aspects that led to such speculations: the player who conceded the dumb penalty in the 2nd leg, Vali Nastase, was brought to the club by Borcea against the wishes of then-head coach, Mircea Rednic (so everyone thought he was the inside man.) And after the second leg, Lazio announced the transfer of Dinamo's Stefan Radu for around 5 million Euros. It was highly speculated that a deal was made where the Italians agreed to buy the player for a then-club record fee (the most expensive player ever sold by Dinamo), provided they won the match. Of course, none of this was ever proven, but there are still a lot of people, even former Dinamo officials from that time, who claim that this is why they lost the match.\n\nThe shock of being eliminated in that fashion was so big that we couldn't even get past Elfsborg in the UEFA Cup qualifiers, losing 2-1 at home and only winning 1-0 away. Overall, that was a disaster of a season, losing the Super Cup against Rapid at the start, being eliminated from both the UCL and UEFA Cup, being eliminated from the Romanian Cup, and then only finishing 4th in the league. All we had left was to hope that we could bounce back next year. This time, if we could win the title, we would automatically secure a spot in the UCL groups.\n\nThe '08-'09 was the last big gamble for Dinamo. The owners poured millions of Euros into the club in previous years, hoping that they could reach the promised land, known as the UCL. But instead, they had to settle for the \"spare change\" received from the UEFA Cup. This time, the owners (now only 3, after Netoiu and Victor Becali departed the club) put everything they had into building a strong team that could win the title again and achieve their dream. Some big names were brought into the squad, including former AC Milan defender Julio Cesar. But early in the season, Dinamo got eliminated by NEC Nijmegen in the UEFA Cup qualifiers.\n\nOut of Europe and eliminated from the Romanian Cup as well, Dinamo had only the league to focus on. They had the lead for most of the season, with Unirea Urziceni and FC Timisoara hot on their tail. With 4 matches left to play, Dinamo met Timisoara at home and won 3-1, gaining some distance from them. Then came the away game at Urziceni. With tensions and speculations as high as they were, the RFF actually brought a Spanish referee to officiate the match, to assure anyone that there could be no doubt of match-fixing. Unirea took the lead early and Dinamo struggled to equalize. They even had a goal controversially ruled off for offside and an unawarded penalty in stoppage time. In the end, Unirea won the match 1-0 and moved into 1st place."
