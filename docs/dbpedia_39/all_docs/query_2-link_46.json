        "text": "Skoda Xanthi Arena first opened on 30th May 2004 after a construction period of around ten months dating back towards the end of 2003. Known as Pigadia Stadium which is a name inherited from the village and training complex it is situated within, the new ground was built as the result of a disagreement between FC Skoda Xanthi, the professional team and Skoda Xanthi, the amateur club.\n\nAlthough Xanthi Arena opened in time for the 2004 Summer Olympics which were hosted by Athens, the €6.5 million euros stadium was constructed independently. Consisting of three stands in total, capable of accommodating 7,422 supporters, the stadium was originally going to be four sided with a capacity of 9,000, however the southern goal-end stand failed to materialise.\n\nTo date the record attendance Skoda Xanthi Arena is 6,410 which was achieved with a game against PAOK FC on the 28th August 2005 right at the start of the Greek Superleague Season. Skoda Xanthi’s average attendance since moving to the Arena is around 1,500 per match, and based on these numbers its easy to see why there hasn’t been a rush to complete the stadium.\n\nThe highest level of football played at the new stadium has undoubtedly been matches of the UEFA Cup, and more recently the Europa League. Skoda Xanthi Arena has hosted the likes of Middlesbrough, Dinamo Bucure?ti, and Standard Liège in qualifiers over the years, but are yet to progress to the group stages.\n\nAs for the future of the ground, it’s unlikely that any major renovations will occur in the future. Two out of three of the stands feature a roof, and thus Skoda Xanthi may look to add one to the northern-stand however it’s hardly a pressing issue."
