Then he went on loan to Niki Volos F.C., a Beta Ethniki team, in order to gain more experiences. He stayed with them for the 2006–07 season participating in 29 league games. Although his team finished last and relegrated his performances were good enough to make the Skoda Xanthi coach Emilio Ferrera trust him with a place in the following year's squad. Rikka grabbed the opportunity and having played 23 league games was one of the team's best players.\n\nAEK Athens\n\nOn 16 May 2008 Rikka signed a 5-year contract for Greek Super League runners-up side AEK Athens for €600.000. Rikka did not manage to impress AEK Athens trainers in his first season, and with only 3 apps,due to a serious injury.After 2 consecutive seasons he was on loan,he returned to AEK Athens.\n\nOlympiakos Volou\n\nOn June 2010 Rikka join Olympiakos Volou FC on loan for one year.
