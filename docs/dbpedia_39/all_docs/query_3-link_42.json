        "text": "\"I seem to remember a photo from about 15 years ago, possibly in FourFourTwo, of a Brazilian lower league team with a tree in the middle of their pitch,\" writes Ian Boutle. \"Can this be confirmed? And are there any other arboreal oddities of note in the wide world of association football?\"\n\nRest assured, Ian, you're not going doolally. In fact, there are a few examples of our leafy friends finding their way on to football pitches. The Brazilian tree on the pitch can be found in São Paulo.\n\n\"Indeed it exists,\" writes Claudio Kristeller, who handily sends in this link (scroll down). \"However, this pitch is not used for any kind of official championship, it is for leisure only.\"\n\nThere was also a tree planted in the middle of the national stadium in Santiago in 2006 by the Chilean artist Sebastián Errázuriz. The project was \"a 10 metre high, real magnolia tree planted in the centre of Chile's National stadium where the dictator Pinochet tortured political prisoners 30 years ago\", notes the artist's website. \"During a whole week the decontextualised stadium was open to the public as a park. A cathartic soccer match played before 15,000 people, with the tree in the middle, was the closure of the piece.\"\n\nNot quite on the pitch, but occasionally interfering with play was the famous 'late tree' at St Albans' ground. \"Up until 1998 the ground was famous for having a large oak tree that sat in the middle of the Clarence Park terrace – the 140 year old 'late tree' – hanging over the pitch,\" writes James Sanders. \"It was not unknown for visiting goalkeepers to get the odd acorn thrown in their direction.\n\n\"The fate of this oak tree was tested in 1993 when St Albans City FC finished runners up in the Ryman Premier League (behind Chesham Utd) only to be denied promotion to the Conference due to this old oak tree. The Conference, which is known for it's strict ground-grading regulations, were sympathetic to their special case. 'St Albans have a beautiful ground, and it would be a shame to have to turn it into a normal stadium,' a representative said. But however beautiful, St Albans were eventually denied promotion in no small part due to the presence of their unique arborial oddity.\"\n\nSt Albans' problem was that the ground is part of a public park and therefore the tree (and another in a corner of the ground) was protected, though it was far from the only problem, with a lack of medical facilities and turnstiles. The Conference inspectors called for £80,000 of improvements, half for upgrading the directors' facilities. They did not at first specify the trees' removal. Then they changed their minds. \"The Conference are entitled to make their own rules,\" said Bernard Tominey, St Albans' chairman at the time, \"but what rules are the trees breaking? Hooligans will climb floodlights more easily than the oaks.\"\n\nEventually, in August 1998, the trees were chopped down after contracting a mystery illness. More information on St Albans City's history can be found here and a fantastic picture of the 'late tree' is can be spotted here.\n\nCLUBS NAMED AFTER MODES OF TRANSPORT (2)\n\nLast week we looked at the teams who are named after trains, planes and automobiles and, as ever, plenty of you have been in touch to point out the ones that we've missed.\n\nRight, deep breath: Club Ferro Carril Oeste and Ferrocarril Sud of Argentina (Ferro Carril is railway), Rosario Central (from Ferrocarril Central Argentino), the now defunct Sunderland Nissan, Hungary's Debrecen (full name: Debreceni Vasutas Sport Club, vasutas meaning railway) and Szolnoki MÁV FC (MÁV being the Hungarian State Railway company), FK Zeljeznicar from Sarajevo (Zeljeznicar is literally 'railway worker' and there Grbavica ground has an old locomotive at the back of the terracing on one side of the ground), Penarol of Montevideo started life as the Uruguay Central Railway club, before adopting the name of the part of Montevideo where most of workers lived, Swindon Supermarine (the club affiliated to women's side Swindon Spitfires mentioned last week), Russian second division side Kamaz (\"Kamskiy avtomobilny zavod – they make trucks and buses,\" writes Vedrana Nikolić), there's a Skoda Xanthi in Greece and, of course, there are plenty of 'Traktors' in eastern Europe, Traktor Plovdiv to name just one.\n\nA couple of now defunct teams were also flagged up. \"In the Industrial League of Melbourne, in which the teams were factory and industry based, there was a team comprising taxi drivers, called – not surprisingly – Taxi,\" writes Peter Humffray.\n\n\"There was a Dublin football team of the 50s and early 60s representing CIE (the Dublin bus company) who were simply named Transport,\" according to Cathal Cruise.\n\nAnd, though not strictly speaking a mode of transport, one other caught our eye. \"Cochabamba's Club Jorge Wilsterman is named after Bolivia's first commercial pilot,\" writes John Wilson. Are there any other teams out there named after individuals? Send your answers to knowledge@theguardian.com.\n\nDRIBBLING ACROSS THE EQUATOR\n\n\"The Deva Stadium, the ground of Chester City, straddles two countries,\" wrote Graham Clayton a few weeks ago. \"The pitch and stands are in Wales, while the offices and administration buildings are in England. Are there any other football stadiums in the world that straddle two countries?\"\n\nJosé Marcos 'Zema' Vieira can go one better than that. \"I don't know of any stadium that straddles two countries but Milton Corrêa Stadium in Macapá, Brazil, has its halfway line positioned exactly over the equator,\" he writes, \"which means a classy player can recover possession in the southern hemisphere and go all the way to score in the northern one. Unfortunately, considering the size of both the stadium and the city, we won't be seeing any World Cup matches there in 2014.\"\n\nKNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE\n\n\"Having watched 42-year-old Kevin Poole turn out for Derby recently, I wondered 'have any grandfathers ever played league football?' wrote Ian Cooper back in the sepia-tinged days of 2005.\n\n\"You might want to consider Norwegian third division team FK Toten's goalkeeper, one Knut Olav Fosslien [follow this link for more - if your Norwegian is up to it],\" writes Trygve Lie in Oslo. \"Fosslien, who at the time was 56 years old, enjoyed a brief spell as a national celebrity when, in 2001, FK Toten played a first-round cup match against Division One team Raufoss. Fosslien did his job fairly well and could not be held to blame for his team losing 2-0. I believe he still plays which, of course, would mean that he has turned 60 by now. He started his career in 1962 and has notched up nearly 1,000 league games during his career. He is the oldest player in the world to have played at a level as high as the third division.\"\n\nHowever, there is an example from the English non-league, Ian, involving Doncaster Rovers chairman John Ryan. Aged 52 and 11 months, the grandfather came on for the final minute of his side's 4-2 win at Hereford on the last day of the Conference season in 2003. \"I didn't actually get a kick of the ball but I had a good run around,\" he declared afterwards, safe in the knowledge that Rovers had already secured a play-off place going into the game.\n\nThat made Ryan the oldest player to ever play a competitive game in England, trumping New Brighton's Neil McBain, who played as an emergency goalkeeper in 1947 – aged 52 and four months. Faced with a severe player shortage, McBain had no choice but field himself against Hartlepool United in a Division Three (North) game. However, we can find no record as to whether he was a grandfather at the time.\n\nFor thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.\n\nCan you help?\n\n\"After reading about John Terry's 'strip penalties' training forfeits at Chelsea (as well as several other clubs' internal motivational techniques), I wondered if there are any more random examples of club forfeits?\" asks Cara Bellingham.\n\n\"As a Pompey fan, I am curious to know if our four owners thus far this season sets some sort of record?\" writes Paul Mailhot.\n\n\"What do you notice about Andriy Shevchenko's club career?\" poses Ross Wildercombe. \"That's right, it's a palindromic. Kyiv, Milan, Chelsea, Milan, Kyiv. Obviously not by the letter, but team for team. Are there any other players who have achieved such a feat? With longer chains? Please reveal all.\"\n\n\"In the Merseyside derby, Sotirios Kyrgiakos was sent off for a lunging challenge on Marouane Fellaini,\" notes Ben Fox. \"However replays showed that both players went in over the top of the ball, with Fellaini also catching Kyrgiakos above the ankle. Both players had essentially committed offences for which they could have been justifiably sent off, and so it made me wonder if there is any record of a similar 50-50 challenge where both men make such a hash of it that they foul each other and both get sent off?\"\n\n\"While many clubs maintain the rather lame tradition of reserving their No12 for their fans, I noticed that Oldham choose the No40 instead,\" notes Robert Winsome. \"Do any other clubs reserve different numbers for their faithful?\""
