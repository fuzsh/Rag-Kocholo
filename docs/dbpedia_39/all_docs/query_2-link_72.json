If the club decides to build to fourth stand in the future, this would raise capacity to 9,000 seats.\n\nHow to get to the Xanthi FC Arena\n\nThe Xhanti FC Arena is located roughly 6 kilometres outside of the town of Xhanti surrounded by farmlands. The closest village is Pigadia, which lies a few hundred metres away.\n\nAddress: Πηγάδια, Xanthi 671 00\n\nXanthi Tickets\n\nTickets for Xanthi matches can be bought online through viva.gr, or in person at the club office at the stadium.\n\nTickets are also available before the match at the stadium.
