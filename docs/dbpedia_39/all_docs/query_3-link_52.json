        "text": "The Riverside Stadium, 15th September 2005, 8.00pm>.\n\nKnow the form>\n\nBoro have suffered a pretty mixed start to the season so far - real Jekyll and Hyde stuff in fact.\n\nOne game they've been brilliant, the next pretty ordinary.\n\nBut if last weekend's win over Arsenal is anything to go by, the season could finally be under way for real.\n\nIt is clear that the new signings, Abel Xavier and Fabio Rochemback, have had a big impact on the side, adding steel and skill.\n\nAllied with the proven talents of Mark Schwarzer, Gareth Southgate, Franck Queudrue, Ugo Ehiogu and George Boateng, with summer signing Yakubu, fit-again Mark Viduka and emerging talents like Adam Johnson and James Morrison, things are really starting to look up for Boro - despite injuries.\n\nWhat a shame that Rochemback is cup-tied for this game thanks to the fact that he had turned out for previous club Sporting Lisbon in a Champions League qualifier in August.\n\nHe looks capable of making all the difference in this season's new-look side, but will be sorely missed in the European campaign - though he might come back into the equation if Boro can survive in the competition until the New Year.\n\nFlu victim James Morrison could return tonight after missing the Arsenal game and with Adam Johnson sure to have earned another crack on the left of midfield after his dazzling full debut against the Gunners, Boro could field a pacy unit tonight.\n\nAussie striker Mark Viduka will be raring to go and could line up alongside Maccarone or Yakubu.\n\nTheir boss says>\n\nSkoda Xanthi boss Ioannis Matzourakis feels that his side start as underdogs tonight but he has vowed to pose Boro plenty of problems.\n\n\"I think the majority of us feel that we have got strong odds against us and we consider ourselves as the outsiders,\" said the former Olympiakos coach, who will watch from the stands thanks to a touchline ban.\n\n\"Middlesbrough are a strong side and they are a team that we have to respect, especially because of the good result they had against Arsenal at the weekend.\n\n\"They didn't start the English championship very well, but they have the potential to go higher, that was quite obvious to anyone who saw their games against Liverpool and Arsenal.\n\n\"Skoda Xanthi is not well known outside the Greek borders. But with all due respect to Middlesbrough, our mission is to try and make sure that Xanthi becomes well known outside Greece.\n\n\"The experience of certain players will pass a positive message and psychology to the rest of the players.\n\n\"That will give us a strong base to compete tonight and we are not going to be defensive.\"\n\nWhat they know about us>\n\nBoro may not be a household name in Greece, but it's probably fair to say that Xanthi know a lot more about us than we do about them.\n\nFor a start, Boro did play that UEFA Cup game against Athens-based Egaleo last season and so Xanthi's backroom staff should have been able to get some decent information from their Greek league rivals.\n\nAnd games from the English Premiership are, of course, shown around the world on a weekly basis - unlike Greek league clashes.\n\nSo it's fair to assume that Xanthi have probably seen plenty of Boro games on the small screen in the last 12 months - there have already been three on TV from the five league games played so far this term!\n\nAnd international class players like Mark Viduka, Gareth Southgate and Yakubu should already be fairly well known - even in the more remote parts of northern Greece.\n\nWhat it all means is that Xanthi will probably have done their homework ahead of tonight's game.\n\nWhat we know about them>\n\nSkoda Xanthi are very much an unknown quantity to English football fans, despite the presence of the unmistakable Emerson.\n\nWe do know they were strong enough to finish fourth in the Greek top flight last season and will provide a similar standard of opposition as Egaleo did in Athens last September.\n\nBankrolled by Viamar SA, the official importer of Skoda vehicles, since 1991, Xanthi can punch above their weight.\n\nThey moved into a new 7,500-capacity stadium last year and like Boro, they boast a purpose-built state of the art, out of town training camp.\n\nSkoda Xanthi trace their modern history back to 1967. They were formed when two clubs - Aspida and Orfeas - merged. They broke into the top flight in 1989 and have stayed there since.\n\nThey have played two league games so far this season, starting with a 1-0 home win over PAOK Salonika followed by a 1-1 with Crete last weekend.\n\nTop Fact>: Not to be mistaken for holiday isle Zante. Xanthi is a small mainland town in the North-east of Greece ten miles from the Aegean coastline, close to the borders with Bulgaria, to the north, and Turkey to the east.\n\nFancy That>: Skoda Xanthi coach Ioannis Matzourakis has also coached Egaleo, who were, of course, drawn against Boro last season.\n\nThe key man>\n\nEmerson was a real enigma and possibly the most frustrating player ever at Boro.\n\nIn his first three months he looked the best player in Europe but after he went AWOL and left his heart in Brazil he was a shadow of his former imperious self.\n\nThe soul-glo Samba star was Portuguese player of the year and the apple of Bobby Robson's eye at Porto. When Emo was sold to Boro behind his back for #4m in May 1996 Robson quit for Barcelona.\n\nEmerson meanwhile made an massive impact at Boro. He had a fine array of tricks, feints, dummies and some body swerves that would not be out of place in a disco.\n\nAnd he was strong. When he shrugged of a challenge puny opponents bounced off him.\n\nAnd he had a sizzling shot too and scored some piledrivers.\n\nBut stories surfaced that Robson wanted him at Barca and Emo refused to return from compassionate leave in Brazil until he got a move.\n\nSteve Gibson threatened to let him rot and he slinked back a month later tail between legs - but he was never the same player. The sparkle had gone.\n\nHe blew hot and cold in the dramatic double Wembley bid in 1997 and carried the can for relegation from some quarters after a particular weak display on the final day at Leeds.\n\nHe stuck around for a low key start of the first division season but again went AWOL at Christmas and betrayed Bryan Robson finally sold him to Tenerife for #4.25m."
