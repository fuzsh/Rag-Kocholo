        "text": "The Nea Smyrni Stadium is the home of Panionios FC and we recently visited to see their match against Skoda Xanthi .\n\nTo get there we took the tram from Syntagma Square, getting off at the Megalou Alexandou stop, which took about 20 minutes. On the way back we took the tram one stop further down the line at Agia Paraskevi. Both are less than 10 minutes from the ground.\n\nWe first joined a queue to buy tickets from a booth, only to be told after waiting for 10 minutes or so that only tickets for the cheap seats were sold there ( 10-15 Euros ), and if we wanted the seats under cover in the main stand we had to go to a booth on the opposite side of the ground. So we traipsed round the stadium to get seats for 25 Euros. However, be aware that in order to buy tickets for football matches in Greece you need to show some form of identification, fortunately we had our passports in our possession.\n\nWe then had a short walk back to the turnstile entrance, and once inside the ground it wasn’t too clear where to go to get to our seats. The friendly police officers weren’t sure either and eventually pointed us to one of the stairwells, but just before we got there I saw a sign for the bar. As there were still 20 minutes to kick off we decided to go for a drink and so found ourselves in a large bar which was virtually deserted. A large glass of white wine from a plastic bottle cost only 2.20 euros and we sat down in comfort. From our table 90 percent of the pitch was in view and there was a TV showing the build-up to the match.\n\nI decided to take my seat in the main stand to watch the match but Mrs FB2000 decided to stay in the bar to watch through the windows and on TV ( which was delayed by about 5 seconds ).\n\nThe ground had quite a nice main covered stand which was reasonably full and a large open stand opposite which was mostly deserted except for a corner ( Section B - 10 Euros ) where the local \"boot-boys\" gathered. The name of Panionios was clearly viewable on these seats. There was nothing behind one goal and wall with a mural behind the other. As the stadium also appears to be used for Athletics there was a running track, long jump pit etc\n\nDespite the match featuring the teams in 5th and 8th places in the Greek Premier division, the attendance was only about 1,500 at the most, and the first half was pretty poor, with the main highlight being the 200 or so home fans in the corner Section B signing continuously through the first half despite whatever the action was on the pitch. There appeared to be zero away fans.\n\nAt half time I joined Mrs FB2000 in the bar for another glass of wine and to watch the first half highlights on the TV but only a handful of home supporters also came into the bar. At it started to rain I also decide to watch the second half from the bar, and very relaxing it was. During the second half, the bar ran out of white wine so I had to start drinking bottles of beer !\n\nThe players had their names on their shirts, but for Skoda their foreign players had their names in Roman script eg Wallace, Dimitriov etc but their Greek players names were in Greek alphabet. All the Panionios players names were in Greek.\n\nThere was no programme or team sheet but I did pick up a monthly free magazine on the Nea Smyrni suburb in which Panionios play, which had 3 pages in Greek about the football club. No idea what it was saying though !\n\nOverall, despite the bureaucracy in obtaining tickets for the match, in the end it was an enjoyable Saturday afternoon. Panionios won 3-0 so the home fans went home happy too !"
