        "text": "Of all the clubs available to manage on FM (both officially and with databases), across all your saves - who have you actually managed? Why? Who was your favourite club? For me;\n\nFM10: Sporting Lisbon, Southampton\n\nFM12: Basingstoke Town, Fiorentina, Arminia Bielefeld, Santo Andre, Philadelphia Union, Consadole Sapporo, Juventus, April 25, Hangzhou Greentown, Trabzonspor\n\nFM14: Virton, Boavista\n\nSporting Lisbon was my first ever FM save, back on FM10. I didn't do too badly, but didn't know what I was doing. I started another one with the team I support, Southampton, and that's where I really learnt how to play the game. I kept it going until around 2040. It's still my favourite ever FM save.\n\nOnce I got FM12, I wanted to bring my local team up the Premier League, Basingstoke Town. After much blood, sweat and tears, I did it, and a few CL wins later (as well as producing some of the best regens I've ever had), I got bored and moved to Fiorentina to knock Inter off their perch. Bring a couple of Italian players with me from Basingstoke, I achieved it pretty quickly. I'd probably still be playing that save had I not had to format my hard-drive (I know, should have backed it up). I downloaded a Japanese database, and took charge of Consadole Sapporo, but I used fake player names to make it a little more difficult. After success in Asia with them, Juventus offered me a job, but I abandoned the save soon after joining. Subsequent saves in the US and Brazil, with Philadelphia and Santo Andre ensued, but neither lasted more than a season or two.\n\nAfter I got back from traveling irl, I got back into the game and started unemployed for the first time ever, and got coincidentally got picked up by my old local team Arminia Bielefeld. I built a proper dynasty there, the only one I've done since my FM10 Southampton save.\n\nAfter that, I tried FM14. A prospective journeyman save, where I started unemployed and ended up at Virton, was abandoned in the second season when I lost my patience with the 14.0.1 ME. A few months, and patches, later, I started again, but this time selected fallen giants Boavista from the start. After a proper struggle to bring them up, I finally won the Portuguese league, but European success always eluded me."
