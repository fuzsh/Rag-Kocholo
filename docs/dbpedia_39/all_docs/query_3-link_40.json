        "text": "Arsene Wenger will take charge of his final game as Arsenal boss on Sunday.\n\nThe Frenchman will walk away from the Emirates at the end of the season after 22 years at the helm.\n\nIt has been an incredible tenure from Wenger, who will be in the dugout for the final time at Huddersfield.\n\nHe had hoped to bow out in the Europa League final but his Emirates tenure will come to an end at the John Smith's Stadium.\n\nWenger will be looking to go out on a high but his side haven't picked up a win away from home in 2018 - or a single point.\n\nAs such, Mirror Football has once more decided to take a look back at the players who have represented the Gunners during the Wenger years - yep, every single one.\n\nAt the very top of that was a Gunners great, David Seaman, but not all of the Frenchman's players have had such a storied career.\n\nThere's been big money signings, bargain buys and home grown heroes, but what are they all up to these days?\n\nWithout further ado, here they all are, from one to two hundred and twenty-one...\n\n1. David Seaman\n\nLong-serving goalkeeper for club and country, helping Arsenal to two league titles.\n\n2. Lee Dixon\n\nRight-back for most of 90's, regarded as one of the best in Premier League era.\n\n3. Tony Adams\n\nTitle-winning captain in 1998 after battling back from off-field issues.\n\n4. Steve Bould\n\nFormer central defender, now assistant manager at the Emirates.\n\n5. Nigel Winterburn\n\nConsistent left-back who completed resolute defence for much of the 1990's.\n\n6. Martin Keown\n\nNo-nonsense centre-half who made over 300 appearances in two spells with the club.\n\n7. Patrick Vieira\n\nSpent almost a decade in north London and was captain of Invincibles side.\n\n8. Paul Merson\n\n'The Magic Man'. Say no more.\n\n9. David Platt\n\nAttacking midfielder who often chipped in with key goals, despite spending the latter stages of his career with Arsenal.\n\n10. John Hartson\n\nStriker-turned-pundit, who recovered from cancer after hanging up his boots.\n\n11. Ian Wright\n\nHeld club's goalscoring record before being overtaken by Thierry Henry.\n\n12. Ray Parlour\n\nRomford Pele - scored key goals for club including 2002 FA Cup final wonder goal.\n\n13. Dennis Bergkamp\n\nOne of the Premier League's greatest ever imports as he offered a series of sublime moments.\n\n14. Remi Garde\n\nOnly spent a few seasons with club. Most recognised for managerial spell in France with Lyon.\n\n15. Steve Morrow\n\nScored the winner in 1993 League Cup final before breaking his arm after being dropped by Tony Adams in post-match celebrations.\n\n16. John Lukic\n\nLargely used as back-up goalkeeper during Wenger era after returning from Leeds.\n\n17. Andy Linighan\n\nKey figure in early 1990's but lost spot after emergence of Keown.\n\n18. Paul Shaw\n\nDropped down the English leads after failing to make it at Arsenal before moving to the USA.\n\n19. Gavin McGowan\n\nPart of FA Youth Cup winning team but only made handful of first-team appearances.\n\n20. Scott Marshall\n\nSpent most of his playing career in the football league. Appointed Villa caretaker manager last season.\n\n21. Stephen Hughes\n\nLeft-footed midfielder who scored a string of impressive goals for the club.\n\n22. Matthew Rose\n\nSpent almost whole career at QPR after just a handful of appearances at Arsenal.\n\n23. Lee Harper\n\nThird-choice goalkeeper at Highbury, with one solitary league outing to his name.\n\n24. Ian Selley\n\nJoined Arsenal's training camp in Dubai after a career largely spent in non-league.\n\n25. Nicolas Anelka\n\nWenger's first signing as Arsenal boss - went on to join Real Madrid (and a whole host of other clubs).\n\n26. Giles Grimandi\n\nJoined his former Monaco boss Wenger at Arsenal in 1997 and is now the Gunners' chief scout in France.\n\n27. Marc Overmars\n\nA Gunners favourite who was an integral part of the 1997-98 Double-winning side, but left for Barcelona for £25million in 2000.\n\n28. Emmanuel Petit\n\nWorld Cup winning midfielder, who moved to Barca as part of the Overmars deal in 2000 after three years at Highbury.\n\n29. Luis Boa Morte\n\nNever hit the heights at Arsenal, but managed to carve out a decent Premier League career with Fulham.\n\n30. Christopher Wreh\n\nAnother who followed Wenger from Monaco, Wreh's Arsenal career peaked with a FA Cup semi-final winner in 1998, before his CV took in a series of loan spells and short stints across Europe.\n\n31. Jason Crowe\n\nA former England youth international who forged out a decent career in the lower leagues, with spells at Northampton and Leeds United the highlights.\n\n32. Paolo Vernazza\n\nA local lad who debuted in the League Cup before moving to Watford where his slow journey down the divisions to non-league football ensued.\n\n33. Alex Manninger\n\nFondly remembered Austrian keeper, who once recorded six clean sheets in a row deputising for David Seaman. His career is still very much alive and kicking, with the 38-year-old playing for Augsburg in the Bundesliga.\n\n34. Alberto Mendez\n\nPlucked from non-league German football by Wenger, Mendez made only 11 appearances before embarking on a journeyman career across Europe.\n\n35. Jehad Muntasser\n\nA one-match wonder for the Gunners, who was the grandson of former Libyan prime minister Mahmud al-Muntasir.\n\n36. Matthew Upson\n\nJoined the Gunners for £2million in 1997, but could never quite establish himself. Would go on to win 21 England caps after leaving Arsenal and is currently at MK Dons.\n\n37. Isaiah Rankin\n\nYouth team player, who racked up 13 different clubs after he was unable to usurp the the Ian Wright and Nicolas Anelka in front of him.\n\n38. Kaba Diawara\n\nFailed to establish himself in the Gunners' team, returning to France after less than a year at the club.\n\n39. Nelson Vivas\n\nArgentinian defender who was snapped up in a £1.6million move from Boca Juniors, spending three years mainly backing up Dixon and Winterburn in north London.\n\n40. Freddie Ljungberg\n\nAlmost as good at football as he was modeling underwear, the skillful Swede was a fan favourite under Wenger, picking up eight winner's medals. Last seen doing a stint in the Indian Super League for Mumbai City.\n\n41. Omer Riza\n\nStriker, who this year returned to Harlow Town, after being plucked from the non-league side by Wenger in 1998. Did his best work in Turkey in the mid-noughties.\n\n42. David Grondin\n\nA left-back who made a handful of Gunners appearances before playing out the majority of his career in France and Scotland.\n\n43. Fabian Caballero\n\nEasily one of the best ever Argetine-Spanish-Paraguayan strikers to turn out for the Gunners, despite only making three appearances. Now a politician in Asuncion.\n\n44. Michael Black\n\nPart of the Gunners' 1994 FA Youth Cup winning side, Black made one senior appearance before dropping down the leagues.\n\n45. Nwankwo Kanu\n\nPopular (so long as you don't support Sheffield United), leggy Nigerian striker, whose 1999 hat-trick against Chelsea will live long in Gunners' fans memories.\n\n46. Oleg Luzhny\n\nFormer Soviet Union international, who spent four years filling in where needed at the back for Arsenal before being snapped up by newly-promoted Wolves in 2003.\n\n47. Silvinho\n\nTextbook attacking full-back from Brazil who displaced Nigel Winterburn from the Gunners team, only for Ashley Cole to soon take his place. Finished his playing career with a season at Manchester City.\n\n48. Thierry Henry\n\nOh, come on. You know who he is. These days found looking dismissive on Sky Sports and helping out at Arsenal's training ground.\n\n49. Davor Suker\n\nArrived at Arsenal in 1999 oozing with pedigree and was a useful contributor during his year at the club. Now runs an academy in Croatia.\n\n50. Stefan Malz\n\nGerman midfielder who turned out eight times for the Gunners in a two-year spell, which was the only time he ventured out of Germany during his career. Last spotted managing second division women's side Niederkirchen.\n\n51. Ashley Cole\n\nBecame one of the Premier League's best left-backs after coming up through the ranks at Arsenal, only to leave for Chelsea in acrimonious circumstances. Recently saw his contract with Roma terminated a year earlier.\n\n52. Tommy Black\n\nThe Academy midfielder made only two senior appearances before establishing himself at Crystal Palace. Ended his playing dats at Debden Sports Club, who play in the Essex Olympian Football League.\n\n53. Rhys Weston\n\nAnother local lad, who became a Welsh international after carving out a decent spell at Cardiff City. Would go on to turn out in Norway, Iceland and Malaysia before signing for AFC Wimbledon in 2013.\n\n54. Jermaine Pennant\n\n55. Graham Barrett\n\nIrish forward who made two appearances for Arsenal in ther Premier League between 1998 and 2003 before moving to Coventry City.\n\n56. Julian Gray\n\nCame through Arsenal's academy but made didn;t make the grade. Sold to Crystal Palace for £500,000 in 2000.\n\n57. Brian McGovern\n\nMade one appearance under Wenger, the Irish defender eventually headed back home to play for clubs like Shamrock Rovers and Bray Wanderers.\n\n58. Lauren\n\nStrongest man in the Invincibles team and penalty-taker-extraordinaire, the powerful right back never quite got the credit he deserved outside of north London. Lauren won the league twice and FA Cup three times at Arsenal.\n\n59. Robert Pires\n\nArguably the plyer who best defined the French revolution at Arsenal. PFA and FWA player of the year in the double-winning season of 2001/02, Pires was technically superb and had an excellent scoring record against Tottenham.\n\n60. Sylvain Wiltord\n\nA valuable squad member in the peak Wenger years, he'll always be remembered for scoring the goal against Man United at Old Trafford that won the league in 2001/02.\n\n61. Lee Canoville\n\nHis only first team appearance came in a 2-1 defeat by Ipswich at Highbury in the 2000 League Cup.\n\n62. Stuart Taylor\n\nBack-up to the back-ups, Taylor was the ultimate reserve goalkeeper, who continued his sitting-on-the-bench career at various clubs after leaving Arsenal in 2005.\n\n63. Moritz Volz\n\nGerman midfielder with a high work rate but not enough talent. Enjoyed a decent spell at Fulham after leaving north London.\n\n64. Igors Stepanovs\n\nIn the category of Sebastien Squilacci and Mikael Silvestre. The Latvian defender won the league and FA Cup at Arsenal, but didn't play an important role in either.\n\n65. Tomas Danilevicius\n\nIn 2000, Danilevicius played for four differnet clubs, one of which was Arsenal. The Lithuanian striker took the phrase 'journeyman' to new levels.\n\n66. Edu\n\nMuch loved by Arsenal fans, Edu balanced technique with grit and was a valuable squad member during his four-year spell at Arsenal, during which time he won the league twice and FA Cup three times.\n\n67. Sol Campbell\n\nSupremely talented centre-half and the north London derby's pantomime villain. Campbell joined Arsenal on a free from Tottenham and is argubaly the last truly world class defender Wenger ever signed.\n\n68. Giovanni van Bronckhorst\n\nThe Dutch defender spent just three seasons at Arsenal before moving to Barcelona, but was alway highly rated at Highbury.\n\n69. Francis Jeffers\n\nThe infamous 'fox-in-the-box' who never quite worked out as planned. Wenger didn't buy another English striker for quite some time.\n\n70. Junichi Inamoto\n\nArrived at Arsenal in time for the double winning season of 2001/02 but didn't play enough games to win a medal. Left that summer.\n\n71. Richard Wright\n\nWhen Arsenal signed him from Ipswich Town he was touted as a future England No.1. He had one season with the Gunners, in which he won the double, but was sold straight afterwards.\n\n72. John Halls\n\nHis debut was against Manchester United in the 2001 League Cup. He was sent off following two bookings.\n\n73. Carlin Itonga\n\nBorn in DR Congo but raised in England, Itonga (like Halls) made his debut against United in 2001.\n\n74. Rohan Ricketts\n\nAnother to make his debut against United in the 2001 League Cup, Ricketts is best known in north London for being one of the few footballers to play for both Arsenal and Tottenham.\n\n75. Stathis Tavlaridis\n\nArsenal signed him from Iraklis for £1m in 2001 but he failed to make the grade. The Greek centre-back moved to Lille in 2003.\n\n76. Jeremie Aliadiere\n\nFrench striker who signed as a 16-year-old and was likened to Thierry Henry - but would depart after just one goal in 29 league games.\n\n77. Sebastian Svard\n\nA defensive midfielder who made his debut in the League Cup against Grimsby in 2001, but made only two more appearances - both in cup competitions.\n\n78. Juan\n\nA diminutive Brazilian left-back, he couldn’t quite cut the mustard after arriving from Sao Paulo.\n\n79. Gilberto Silva\n\nThe World Cup-winning Brazilian spent six years with the Gunners, anchoring the Invincibles midfield alongside Vieira.\n\n80. Kolo Toure\n\nThe Ivorian defender impressed Wenger while on trial before signing from ASEC Mimosas for just £150k in 2002 - Seven years later, having been an Invincible and club captain, he joined Manchester City for £16million.\n\n81. Pascal Cygan\n\nMuch-maligned French defender who, looking back, wasn’t all that bad.\n\n82. Ryan Garry\n\nFormer defender who made just one league appearance in six years before joining Bournemouth in 2007. Now under-13s coach at the Gunners academy.\n\n83. Rami Shaaban\n\nA Swedish keeper who was plagued by injuries during his time at Highbury.\n\n84. David Bentley\n\nFrom the ‘English Dennis Bergkamp’ to the ‘new David Beckham’, he never made his mark at Arsenal; went on to cost north London rivals Tottenham £15million in 2008 and has since retired after falling out of love with the game.\n\n85. Justin Hoyte\n\nQuick, athletic fullback who made 68 Premier League appearances for the club before joining Middlesbrough for £3million in 2008.\n\n86. Jens Lehmann\n\nFamed for his rivalry with Oliver Kahn, the eccentric German saved Juan Roman Riquelme’s penalty to secure a place in the 2006 Champions League final - where he was subsequently sent off for an early foul on Ludovic Giuly.\n\n87. Graham Stack\n\nIrish keeper who made his debut in a League Cup match against Rotherham and scored in a penalty shoot-out win; he enjoyed a number of loan spells throughout the Football League and is now captain of Barnet.\n\n88. John Spicer\n\nThe Romford-born midfielder made just one League Cup appearance for the club.\n\n89. Jerome Thomas\n\nTricky winger who joined from Luton as a schoolboy, Thomas failed to make a Premier League appearance for the side before leaving in January 2004 to join Charlton in a £1million move.\n\n90. Quincy Owusu-Adeyie\n\nJoined the Gunners academy in 2002 from Ajax, the Amsterdam born winger was lightning quick but regularly infuriated with his final ball.\n\n91. Gael Clichy\n\nUnheralded arrival from Cannes, he played his part in the Invincibles success as back-up to Ashley Cole, making a total 264 appearances for the club before joining Manchester City\n\n92. Cesc Fabregas\n\nSpanish playmaker poached from Barcelona, he became captain and a European Championship and World Cup winner - before leaving for his boyhood club, only to return to England…with Chelsea.\n\n93. Ryan Smith\n\nLeft-footed winger last seen playing in Greece for Skoda Xanthi.\n\n94. Frankie Simek\n\nPlayed a single match for the club, in the League Cup win over Wolves in December 2003.\n\n95. Olafur-Ingi Skulason\n\nIcelandic international midfielder who can now been seen plying his trade in Turkey with Genclerbirligi.\n\n96. Michal Papadopulos\n\nStriker who has six caps for the Czech Republic - the last of which was in 2011.\n\n97. Jose Antonio Reyes\n\nSpanish forward who arrived from Sevilla in 2004 for £17million but despite glimpses of unquestionable quality never really settled enough to set north London alight; still going strong back in Seville.\n\n98. Robin van Persie\n\nThe Dutch forward arrived for a cut-price £3million from Feyenoord with questions over a volatile nature but not of his talent; left after 132 goals to join Man United in a £24million deal in 2012, and is the Netherlands all-time record goalscorer.\n\n99. Mathieu Flamini\n\nTough-tackling French midfielder who signed (for free) from Marseille, left (for free) to AC Milan and then returned to the Emirates. Now at Crystal Palace.\n\n100. Sebastian Larsson\n\nSwedish ball-player who began as a left-back but has carved out a niche for himself as a right-sided midfielder at both Birmingham and Sunderland.\n\n101. Danny Karbassiyoon\n\nYouth team prospect who never made it, but now scouts for Arsenal in north America.\n\n102. Johan Djourou\n\nSwiss international who was sold after failing to cut errors out of his game.\n\n103. Manuel Almunia\n\nSpanish stopper who never quite convinced the fans despite some good performances.\n\n104. Arturo Lupoli\n\nDiminutive striker who didn't live up to his reputation at senior level.\n\n105. Philippe Senderos\n\nOne of a number of bumbling centre-backs to stick around for a few seasons.\n\n106. Patrick Cregg\n\nIrish youth team prospect who now plays for Shamrock Rovers.\n\n107. Emmanuel Eboue\n\nA cult figure among fans for his personality and attacking raids from right-back.\n\n108. Alexander Hleb\n\nThe ultimate Wenger player: slight, technically gifted and perhaps a little too easily dominated.\n\n109. Alex Song\n\nAll-action midfielder who broke supporters' hearts by jumping ship to Barcelona.\n\n110. Fabrice Muamba\n\nMoved to Bolton before he was forced into premature retirement due to health issues.\n\n111. Anthony Stokes\n\nOne League Cup appearance for the Gunners and now playing for Celtic.\n\n112. Nicklas Bendtner\n\nThe world's greatest player... but only in his own mind.\n\n113. Kerrea Gilbert\n\nWillesden-born defender who has since tumbled down the divisions.\n\n114. Abou Diaby\n\nWhen fit, a brilliantly versatile presence. But tormented by injuries for years.\n\n115. Emmanuel Adebayor\n\nThe fans loved him for his goals but his post-Arsenal career has made him a pariah.\n\n116. Tomas Rosicky\n\n'Little Mozart' has had some golden moments in the red shirt, but perhaps could have done more.\n\n117. Theo Walcott\n\nGlorious talent but still may feel he hasn't quite hit the heights on a regular basis.\n\n118. Julio Baptista\n\nForceful Brazilian attacker who didn't quite fit in to Wenger's system.\n\n119. William Gallas\n\nMoved to north London as part of the Ashley Cole deal and became a reliable performer.\n\n120. Matthew Connolly\n\nDefender who now plays for Cardiff after a length spell with QPR.\n\n121. Denilson\n\nCultured passing midfielder who looked like the next big thing but then faded.\n\n122. Mark Randall\n\nOne of Arsenal's big hopes, he never lived up to the billing.\n\n123. Armand Traore\n\nTechnically gifted left-back, he proved a touch lightweight to stake a real claim\n\n124. Mart Poom\n\nSigned as a back-up goalkeeper and was never really called upon\n\n125. Bacary Sagna\n\nA brilliant Wenger signing: plucked from Auxerre and went on to be a Premier League regular.\n\n126. Eduardo da Silva\n\nDeadly finisher whose career went off course after that horror leg break.\n\n127. Lassana Diarra\n\nThe French midfielder never quite carved out a niche for himself at the Emirates.\n\n128. Lukasz Fabianski\n\nPolish goalkeeper whose errors earned him the nickname 'FlappyHandski'.\n\n129. Fran Merida\n\nExpected to become a star after youth team exploits but progress stalled.\n\n130. Nacer Barazite\n\nDutch youth international who is now playing for Utrecht in his homeland.\n\n131. Kieran Gibbs\n\nCultured left-back who is now a key part of the England squad.\n\n132. Henri Lansbury\n\nThe prodigiously talented midfielder was tipped for big things... but he didn't quite make it for Arsenal.\n\n133. Aaron Ramsey\n\nAll-action Welsh midfielder who has kicked on brilliantly after a bad injury.\n\n134. Samir Nasri\n\nJumped ship to Manchester City just when he was beginning to show his ability.\n\n135. Carlos Vela\n\nThe king of scooped finishes in League Cup games, now playing for David Moyes at Real Sociedad.\n\n136. Jack Wilshere\n\nTenacious, talented schemer who is hoping to put fitness troubles behind him. On loan at Bournemouth.\n\n137. Francis Coquelin\n\nLooked to be heading the way of other untapped talents, but made a sensational return to become a key man.\n\n138.

Mikael Silvestre\n\nA weird signing from Manchester United, whose arrival did not impress the fans.\n\n141.

Paul Rodgers\n\nNot the singer. Crucially, not the singer.\n\n144. Andrei Arshavin\n\nMercurial meerkat lookalike who started with a bang but couldn't keep it up.\n\n145. Vito Mannone\n\nTaciturn stopper who had to wait ages for a first-team chance and subsequently flopped.\n\n146. Thomas Vermaelen\n\nStrong in the air, comfortable on the ball, but prone to the odd costly brainmelt.\n\n147. Gilles Sunu\n\nThe pacy forward is now back in France, where he plays for Angers.\n\n148. Wojciech Szczesny\n\nConfident, cigarette-loving goalkeeper who paid the price for one too many high-profile mistakes.\n\n149. Sanchez Watt\n\nPerennial Emirates Cup superstar but never managed to make a breakthrough.\n\n150. Craig Eastmond\n\nSee above. Plays for Sutton United these days.\n\n151. Kyle Bartley\n\nGiant centre-back who had loan spells at Sheffield United and Rangers before joining Swansea.\n\n152. Thomas Cruise\n\nNever quite made it as a Top Gunner. Blame the wingman.\n\n153. Marouane Chamakh\n\nHis hair struck fear in the hearts of defenders, but the goals just didn't flow.\n\n154. Laurent Koscielny\n\nPlucked from French club Lorient (hi, Arsene!), he has since become a top-class defender.\n\n155. Sebastien Squillaci\n\nBench fodder supreme, the veteran didn't make a lasting impression at Arsenal.\n\n156. Jay Emmanuel-Thomas\n\nAnother academy product, the skilful JET shone at Bristol City and joined QPR in the summer.\n\n157. Ignasi Miquel\n\nCalled into the first team to cover for injuries in 2011/12, he dropped down the pecking list and was moved on.\n\n158.

Gervinho\n\nTwisty, bewitching dribbler who blew hot and cold before Wenger finally lost patience.\n\n161. Carl Jenkinson\n\nA cult figure in waiting, the hard-working full-back is currently on loan at West Ham\n\n162. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\n\nAnother former Southampton prodigy, The Ox is a firm fan favourite at the Emirates.\n\n163. Mikel Arteta\n\nAfter impressing as a playmaker at Everton, the Spaniard was converted into a holding midfielder.\n\n164. Yossi Benayoun\n\nCompleted his hat-trick of top clubs after spells with Liverpool and Chelsea... but didn't impress.\n\n165. Per Mertesacker\n\nArsenal's very own BFG, Mertesacker overcame a shaky start and is now one of Wenger's key men.\n\n166. Andre Santos\n\nA defender in name only, the Brazilian spent much of his time ambling around and misplacing passes.\n\n167. Chuks Aneke\n\nThe England youth international now plays in Belgium with Zulte Waregem.\n\n168. Ryo Miyaichi\n\nDiminutive schemer who made fans drool, but didn't have the physicality to make it in the Premier League.\n\n169. Oguzhan Ozyakup\n\nLeft for Besiktas in 2012 and has since become a full Turkish international.\n\n170. Park Chu-Young\n\nThe fleet-footed forward didn't get much of a look in after joining from Monaco.\n\n171. Daniel Boateng\n\nCame through the ranks in north London but now pays for Swedish side Sodertalje.\n\n172. Nico Yennaris\n\nHis versatility didn't convince Wenger that he could make an impact at first-team level.\n\n173. Santi Cazorla\n\nWho could fail to love his two-footedness, zippy passing and permanent grin?\n\n174. Olivier Giroud\n\nMuch maligned by a section of the support, but his goal record remains impressive.\n\n175. Lukas Podolski\n\nDeadly with that wand of a left foot but ultimately didn't quite fit Arsenal's way.\n\n176. Martin Angha\n\nSwiss centre-back who cameoed against Coventry in the League Cup and Olympiacos in the Champions League in 2012. Now at 1860 Munich.\n\n177. Serge Gnabry\n\nPromising winger who impressed at the start of last season before being struck down with injury. Is currently on a season-long loan at West Brom.\n\n178. Damien Martinez\n\nYoung Argentinian goalkeeper who loves a loan spell. Currently at Wolves for the season.\n\n179. Thomas Eisfeld\n\nSnapped up from Dortmund in 2012, but only made it as far as League Cup and pre-season friendly appearances before leaving for Fulham in 2014. Now at Bochum.\n\n180. Jernade Meade\n\nMade his debut in the bonkers 7-5 League Cup win over Reading in 2012, but left at the end of that season. Spend a year at Swansea and is now in playing in the Spartan South Midlands Football League for Hadley.\n\n181. Nacho Monreal\n\nSigned from Malaga in 2013, the Spain defender has established himself as a regular under Wenger.\n\n182. Yaya Sanogo\n\nAn uber-Wenger signing, the French Under-21 international was shipped out on loan to Ajax and Charlton after failing to break into the Gunners' first-team.\n\n183. Mesut Ozil\n\nWenger splashed the cash on the Germany international on the final day of the 2013 summer transfer window, making him Arsenal's record signing at £42.5million.\n\n184. Chuba Akpom\n\nEngland youth international enjoyed an impressive loan spell at Hull City.\n\n185. Kristoffer Olsson\n\nMade his debut in the League Cup clash against West brom in 2013. Technically impressive but never quite good enough for Arsenal. Now plays for FC Midtjylland.\n\n186. Hector Bellerin\n\nSigned from Barcelona's academy along with Jon Toral, Hector Bellerin broke into Arsenal's first team in the 2014/15 season after an injury to Mathieu Debuchy. He hasn't looked back since.\n\n187. Isaac Hayden\n\nIsaac Hayden has made two appearances for Arsenal in the League Cup over the last two seasons. He's currently on loan at Hull.\n\n188. Gedion Zelalem\n\nOn loan at Rangers this season, the Ethiopian-born midfielder is known for his great technique and passing. Likely to break into the first team at some point, needs to bulk up a bit first.\n\n189. Kim Kallstrom\n\nThe Swedish midfielder signed for Arsenal in January 2014 but spent the next three months injured. Helped Arsenal win the FA Cup that season.\n\n190. Joel Campbell\n\nSigned for Arsenal for £1m, he went on numerous loans in a bid to earn a work permit. Currently battling for a place in the first team, looks likely his future lies elsewhere.\n\n191. Calum Chambers\n\nSigned from Southampton in the summer of 2014, Chambers can play either right-back or centre-back. He had a brilliant start to life at Arsenal, which led to an almost immediate England call-up, before being loaned to Middlesbrough.\n\n192. Mathieu Debuchy\n\nThe France international was brought in to replace Bacary Sagna but had terrible luck with injuries in his first season. Currently struggling to regain his place off of Hector Bellerin.\n\n193. Alexis Sanchez\n\nThe Chile star signed for Arsenal from Barcelona and was the Gunners' top scorer in his first season at the club. Considered by many to be the club's current best player.\n\n194. Danny Welbeck\n\nThe England forward joined on deadline day from Manchester United in the summer of 2014. A crowd favourite who has struggled with injuries.\n\n195. David Opsina\n\nThe Colombia international was signed after impressing at the 2014 World Cup. Became Arsenal No.1 in his first season before Arsenal signed Petr Cech, who is now first choice keeper.\n\n196. Ainsley Maitland-Niles\n\nA tall, fast, powerful winger who has come through the academy at Arsenal. Maitland-Niles impressed on loan at Ipswich.\n\n197. Stefan O'Connor\n\nThe young centre-back joined Arsenal's academy as a 13-year-old and made his debut in 2014, coming on as a late substitute as the Gunners beat Galatasaray 4-1 in the Champions League.\n\n198. Gabriel\n\nSigned from Villarreal in January 2015, the Brazilian centre-back is slowly proving his worth at Arsenal. Fast, strong and a great tackler, Gabriel is starting to adapt to English football.\n\n199. Petr Cech\n\nChelsea legend Petr Cech signed for Arsenal after losing his place at Stamford Bridge to Thibaut Cortois. In his first game for the Gunners - the 2015 Community Shield - he kept a clean sheet as they beat his old side 1-0.\n\n200. Alex Iwobi\n\nThe Nigerian is already a full Nigerian international after he made his debut for the Super Eagles when he came off the bench against the Democratic Republic of Congo earlier this month.\n\n201. Glen Kamara\n\nA defensive midfielder who has represented Finland at youth level, Kamara is adapt both at protecting the backline and surging forward.\n\n202. Ismael Bennacer\n\nA France international at youth level, Bennacer is a skillful attacking midfielder.\n\n203. Krystian Bielik\n\nThe Polish youth international was bought by Wenger in January 2015 for a reported £2.7million. The 17-year-old has great size for his age and is tipped to be a top future midfield enforcer.\n\n204. Jeff Reine-Adelaide\n\nReine-Adelaide came through the ranks at Lens - the academy that also produced players such as Geoffrey Kondogbia and Raphael Varane - but never played for their first team. He joined Arsenal in the summer of 2015 and made his debut against Sunderland in the FA Cup in January 2016.\n\n205. Mohamed Elneny\n\nThe Egyptian moved to the Emirates from Basel in January 2016 and impressed towards the end of his opening season. He made his debut against Burnley in the FA Cup and scored his first goal against Barcelona.\n\n206. Rob Holding\n\nHolding came through the ranks at Bolton and after just one season in the first-team was picked up by Arsene Wenger. A defensive crisis forced Wenger to throw him straight in at Liverpool on the opening day of the 2016/17 season.\n\n207. Granit Xhaka\n\nLike Holding, Xhaka made his debut in the defeat to Liverpool in August 2016. The Swiss midfielder arrived in a £35m deal from Borussia Monchengladbach earlier in the summer.\n\n208. Shkodran Mustafi\n\nArsene Wenger swooped for the former Everton defender to solve his side's defensive problems. The German international arrived from Valencia for £35m and has already been compared to Manchester United icon Nemanja Vidic.\n\n209. Lucas Perez\n\nWith the Gunners short of forward options, Wenger pipped Everton to land Lucas Perez from Deportivo. The Spaniard made his debut against Southampton in September 2016 and scored his first goals for the club against Nottingham Forest the same month. Sent back to Deportivo a year later.\n\n210. Chris Willock\n\nThe youngster came through the ranks at the Emirates and featured against Forest in the EFL Cup. He signed a five-year deal with Benfica in 2017.\n\n211. Alexandre Lacazette\n\nArsene Wenger splashed out £52million on the Lyon striker in the summer of 2017. Lacazette had a fine start to his Gunners career, scoring on his Premier League debut against Leicester.\n\n212. Sead Kolasinac\n\nThe Gunners signed the Bosnian left-back on a free transfer from Schalke in 2017. Kolasinac found the net in the Community Shield against Chelsea before featuring on the opening day of the season.\n\n213. Reiss Nelson\n\nNelson was drafted into the Arsenal first-team fold in pre-season ahead of the 2017/18 campaign. He made his debut as a substitute against Cologne in the Europa League before his first start against Doncaster.\n\n214. Josh Dasilva\n\nArsene Wenger handed academy graduate Da Silva his debut as a half-time substitute in the Carabao Cup victory over Doncaster in September 2017.\n\n215. Joe Willock\n\nThe 18-year-old followed in his brother Chris' footsteps when he made his debut against Doncaster.\n\n216. Eddie Nketiah\n\nThe young striker made his debut on September 28th as a very late substitute against BATE Borisov in the Europa League, but made a real splash on his next appearance, coming off the bench to score twice in the League Cup win over Norwich.\n\n217. Marcus McGuane\n\nThe young midfielder stepped off the bench in the win over BATE. Left the Gunners to join Barcelona in January.\n\n218. Ben Sheaf\n\nA tall, languid midfielder, Sheaf entered the fray in the 1-0 win over Red Star Belgrade in Serbia.\n\n219. Matt Macey\n\nThe young goalkeeper played all 120 minutes in the League Cup win over Norwich, before keeping a clean sheet in the Europa League against Red Star.\n\n220. Henrikh Mkhitaryan\n\nThe Armenian international joined the Gunners from Manchester United after 18 inconsistent months at Old Trafford.\n\n221. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\n\nThe lightning-quick Gabonese hitman left Borussia Dortmund to become Arsenal's club record signing in January 2018, costing £56million. Has scored six goals in nine games since his arrival.\n\n222. Konstantinos Mavropanos\n\nThe Greek youngster was a surprise arrival in January 2018. He was handed his debut in the defeat to Manchester United and didn't disappoint."
