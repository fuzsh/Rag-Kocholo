        "text": "While India remains obssessed with cricket, other sports including football continue to find its own feet in the country. Owing to the ever-improving Team India and popularity of Sunil Chhetri, football has struck a chord, especially with the country's youth. The promotion of I-League and Indian Super League (ISL) has not only brought football to the homes of Indian fans, but also allowed the sport to find a new fanbase.\n\nThough the salaries and prize money of ISL players still doesn't come close to the earnings and wages of cricketers plying their trade in country's cash-rich Indian Premier League (IPL), the state of affairs for the beautiful game has improved considerably in this part of the world.\n\nJust like Virat Kohli, Chhetri reigns supreme on the football scene in the nation. Owing to his unmatched skills on the field which saw him notching up multiple honours and enjoying an illustrious career, Chhetri has has not only become the face of Indian football, but also a befitting role model for the youth.\n\nFor someone of his stature, Chhetri is arguably the best Indian footballer around which explains the big bucks he has earned through central contracts and ISL deals. But, at 35, old age is catching up with Chhetri. While his unbelievable fitness levels remains up to the mark, Chhetri's market value that once soared at the top has gone down considerably, currently estimated to be 375,000 euros (Rs 3,09,07,618.66), as per 'Transfer Markt'.\n\nHere's a look at top five ISL players who have a better market value than the Indian football captain:\n\nAndy Keogh\n\nJoining NorthEast United earlier this January, Andy Keogh was roped in as a replacement for injured Asamoah Gyan by the John Abraham co-owned ISL franchise. The Irishman is well known for his time in the A-League with Perth Glory where he scored 55 goals in 122 matches. With 30 international appearances under his belt, Keogh also represented Republic of Ireland.\n\nHe began his career in England with clubs like Leeds United, Bury FC, and Scunthorpe United before making the switch to the then Championship side Wolverhampton Wonderers, achieving promtion with the Wolves in 2009. The 33-year-old arrived in India after scoring eight goals in 17 matches in Saudi Arabia's second-tier side Al-Qadsiah.\n\nWhile he may no longer seem to be the goal-scoring machine he once was in his career, netting just once in 7 matches for NorthEast, Keogh remains one of the highly-sought-after footballers in the ISL. With a market value estimated to be 650,000 euros (Rs 5,35,67,800), as per 'Transfer Markt', the Irishman shares the top spot in the list of ISL footballers with highest market value.\n\nRoy Krishna\n\nArguably one the hottest properties in ISL, Roy Krishna set the tournament ablaze after joining Atletico de Kolkata (ATK) from Wellington Phoenix - a New Zealand football club that competes in Australia's A-League. Arriving at ATK last June, the Fiji football team captain was arguably one of the best strikers on show last season.\n\nThe 32-year-old, captaining ATK, emerged as the joint-top goalscorer with 15 goals in 21 matches, alongside five assists and a hat-trick to his name last season. His ability to find the back of the net allowed Atletico to become the first club to win a record three ISL titles. For someone who was roped in on a year-long contract, Krishna proved to be an invaluable asset for ATK last season.\n\nOwing to his success in ISL and other league clubs, Krishna currently has a market value of a staggering 650,000 euros (Rs 5,35,67,800), as per 'Transfer Markt'. He shares the top spot, alongside Keogh, in the elite list of ISL players with the highest market value.\n\nMarcelinho\n\nBorn in Rio de Janeiro, Marcelinho started his senior professional career at the age of 18 with the reserves of Atletico Madrid, followed by a stint with Getafe CF B. But it was at Greek club Skoda Xanthi where he really became a key figure with more than 100 appearances. Owing to his success in Greece, Marcelinho was bought in to play for Delhi Dynamos in the 2016 ISL season.\n\nIn his debut season, the Brazilian footballer repaid the faith of his employers with a sensational season, finishing as the league's top scorer and bagging the 'Golden Boot' honour. His success at Delhi saw Pune City stealing him away in 2017 on a contract that saw him providing his services over a course of two seasons (2017/18 and 2018/19).\n\nMarcelninho continued his journey in the ISL, this time with new entrants Hyderabad FC who secured his signatures for the 2019/20 season. While Hyderabad had a catastrophic debut season, finishing at the bottom of the table with just 10 points in 18 matches, it didn't really affect Marcelinho's impressive market value that is currently estimated to be 600,000 euros (Rs 4,94,61,600), as per 'Transfer Markt'.\n\nDavid Williams\n\nBorn in Brisbane, Williams played youth football at the Queensland Academy of Sport before making his professional debut for Queensland Roar. Williams has also played in Europe for Danish Superliga (Denmark) club Br√∏ndby and NB I (Hungary) club Haladas. But, it was time playing for several A-League clubs including the likes of Sydney FC and Melbourne City and Wellington Phoenix that really put on him on the world map.\n\nArriving at Atletico de Kolkata last June alongside his former Wellington Phoenix teammate Roy Krishna, the Australian forward did his bit in his new club's 2019/20 title-winning campaign. His most notable contribution came in the second leg of the semifinals against Bengaluru FC where he scored a brace to help ATK script a spectacular turnaround and storm into the last season's final with a 3-2 aggregate win.\n\nThe 32-year-old scored five goals and recorded four assists for ATK, but Williams' market value, thanks to his title-winning season, saw his market value rising to a whopping 600,000 euros (Rs 4,94,61,600), as per 'Transfer Markt'.\n\nBartholomew Ogbeche\n\nBorn in Nigeria, Bartholomew Ogbeche moved to France to join the youth teams of Paris Saint-Germain at the age of 15. While the move was undeniably a golden opportunity to establish himself, Ogbeche's consistent run-ins with injuries kept the playing field at bay. Following inconsistent game time over a course of three seasons in Paris, the Nigerian had brief spells at SC Bastia and FC Metz before leaving France to join Al-Jazira in the Middle East.\n\nIn August 2018, Ogbeche joined NorthEast United and scored on his debut against FC Goa. Few days later, he scored a hat-trick in a mere 10 minutes during the clash against Chennaiyin FC. Showcasing his goal-scoring prowess, Ogbeche finished his debut ISL season with 12 goals for NorthEast.\n\nTaking note of his exploits, Kerala Blasters secured his services and reunited him with his former NorthEast coach Elco Schattorie for the 2019/20 season. Handed the role of captaincy, the 35-year-old couldn't save Kerala from enduring a disastrous season, but that didn't stop him for scoring 15 goals in 16 matches, finishing as the joint-top scorer for the 2019/20 season. His success in the ISL has also allowed him to enjoy a handsome market value estimated to be 575,000 euros (Rs 4,73,61,600), as per 'Transfer Markt'."
