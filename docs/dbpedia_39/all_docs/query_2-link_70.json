        "text": "Greek Football\n\nby AEKTZIS » Fri Jan 07, 2011 9:18 pm\n\nThis is the place to discuss Greek football here (if anyone actually gives a damn). I'm not sure how many people here follow Greek football (or even support a team in Greece), but you could probably guess from my username I support A.E.K.\n\nby Oracle » Fri Jan 07, 2011 9:24 pm\n\nWell, what is TZIS?\n\nWelcome AEK supporter.\n\nby AEKTZIS » Fri Jan 07, 2011 9:34 pm\n\nthanks\n\nby ARMENIAN CYPRIOT » Fri Jan 07, 2011 10:20 pm\n\nGiorgos Tofas a GC played for AEK until 09 and now plays for Queens Park Rangers F.C . That is my extent on your club. If AEK signed some Cypriot players it would probably draw interest from Cyprus, Like when Okkas and Kounstantinou played in Greece.\n\nby AEKTZIS » Fri Jan 07, 2011 10:49 pm\n\nOkkas played for AEK in 03-04 before moving to Olympiakos....You are right about Tofas, he was in AEK's youth setup before moving to Anorthosis.\n\nAlso Timur Ketsbaia played for AEK and was a star for our team in the mid 90s before going to Newcastle, he was one of our best players in that period....fans loved him.\n\nAnd Dusan Bajevic, probably AEK's most famous coach (coached AEK 3 times in the past 20 years for a period of about 12 years overall) is now coaching Omonia in Cyprus.\n\nOver the years there have been many Cypriot footballers playing in Greece for the biggest teams, not just Okkas (who was at PAOK, AEK and Olympiakos) and Konstantinou (Iraklis, Panathinaikos and Olympiakos) who are probably the most famous examples but many others like:\n\nNicky Papavasiliou (the only Greek Cypriot to play in the Premiership) [OFI Crete]\n\nPanagiotis Engomitis [PAOK]\n\nElias Charalambous (now at Omonia) [PAOK]\n\nGiasemis Giasemakis [PAOK]\n\nStefanos Voskaridis [PAOK, Ergotelis, Veroia]\n\nAlexandros Garpozis [PAOK and Skoda Xanthi]\n\nKonstantinos Charalambidis (now at APOEL) [PAOK and Panathinaikos]\n\nStathis Aloneftis (now at Omonia) [Larisa]\n\nNektarios Alexandrou (now at APOEL) [Larisa]\n\nMarios Nicolaou (now at AEL) [Panionios]\n\nKostas Malekkos [Panathinaikos]\n\nGiorgos Nicolaou [Panachaiki]\n\nMarios Agathokleous [Various teams]\n\nGeorgios Pantziaras (played in the 80s) [Aris]\n\n...and probably many others I have forgotten to mention.\n\nby ARMENIAN CYPRIOT » Fri Jan 07, 2011 11:04 pm\n\nDo you follow Cypriot Football at all ?? If so any club in particular ??\n\nby AEKTZIS » Fri Jan 07, 2011 11:13 pm\n\nyes I follow it closely too. APOEL is my team. I have gone to see them twice...\n\n-Chelsea away last season in the Champions League when we drew 2-2 (one of the best days of my life)\n\n-Getafe away in August (also an excellent trip as I got to see Madrid and APOEL played a good game, we were so unlucky not to get to the Europa League)\n\nI have also seen AEK once:\n\n-This season away at Anderlecht in Europa League (we lost 3-0....worst AEK performance I have ever seen)\n\nDo you have a Cypriot team??\n\nby ARMENIAN CYPRIOT » Fri Jan 07, 2011 11:31 pm\n\nI follow Olympiakos Lefkosia and Anorthosis. Olympiakos has been a pleasant surprise this season so far, while Anorthosis seems to be unraveling since Ketsbaia has left.\n\nby AEKTZIS » Fri Jan 07, 2011 11:37 pm\n\nMy father and grandfather supported Olympiakos Lefkosia back when they were competing in the Greek league....they have done well this season.\n\nI am really confused with Anorthosis' performances. They were great at the beginning and I thought they had a nice-looking squad, but they have been so awful...they have some good players like Nacho Garcia who was at Aris Salonika in Greece and one of their best players the past 4-5 years."
