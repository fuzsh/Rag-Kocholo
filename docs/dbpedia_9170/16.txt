"If the great Phil Ochs were to rise from the dead today, he would probably be hailed as the new David Rovics" (quote from Andy Kershaw)

David Stefan Rovics (/ˈroʊvɪks/ ROH-viks; born April 10, 1967) is an American indie singer/songwriter. His music concerns both topical subjects such as the 2003 Iraq war, anti-globalization, anarchism, and social justice issues, and also labor history. Rovics has been an outspoken critic of former President George W. Bush, the Republican Party, John Kerry, and the Democratic Party.

Rovics is critical of the United States government's policies and claims that the "U.S. government's foreign policy represents U.S. corporate interests" and that "the U.S. government does not like democracy either at home or abroad."

Although some of Rovics' work is not self-published, and much of it is commercially distributed, Rovics has made all of his recorded music freely available as downloadable mp3 files. He encourages the free distribution of his work by all non-profit means to promote his work and spread political messages, and speaks out against websites or programs like iTunes that charge money for downloading his songs. Rovics has also advocated the performing of his songs at protests and demonstrations and has made his sheet music and lyrics available for download.

He has described himself as an "anti-Zionist Jew from New York".

In 2002, Andy Kershaw, then a BBC DJ and journalist, played Rovics’s song Jenin for the first time, a song Rovics wrote during the second Palestinian Intifada: it is a moving and powerful song about what may have led to someone deciding to become a suicide bomber.

As Rovics said: “This song was played many times on BBC Radio 3 by Andy Kershaw in the years after I recorded it. Playing this song, and some things Andy said in an interview with me on his popular weekly World Music show, resulted in Andy getting called to talk to the BBC Board of Governors for the first time in his 30-year career at BBC. Andy playing this and other songs of mine represents the vast majority of airplay I’ve ever gotten on a popular national radio broadcast in my entire career.” [1]

Rovics has done several sessions for Kershaw's shows on BBC Radio 3.
