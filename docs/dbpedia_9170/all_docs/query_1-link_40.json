        "text": "David Rovics wrote “Union Makes Us Strong” to communicate “the most fundamental message I and others like me are trying to communicate — in union we can achieve anything.”\n\nLyrics\n\nBack in the Depression farmers held the line\n\nWhen the bank came for an auction together they’d combine\n\nThey knew that when divided they could never win\n\nBut they stood shoulder to shoulder and didn’t let the bankers in\n\nThey stood shoulder to shoulder, that’s how they kept their farms\n\nIf one of them was threatened it was for all to be alarmed\n\nThey said this was their land and they’d help each other stay\n\nThat’s how they kept their farms, that’s why the bankers went away\n\n‘Cause the union makes us strong (2x)\n\nBack in the Depression there was not enough to eat\n\nBut the Union of the Unemployed was in the driver’s seat\n\nIf the cops did an eviction, took the bed and put it out\n\nThe neighbors would carry it in, sing a song and shout\n\n(Chorus)\n\nI can hear him talking, you’ve got to look at the long view\n\nBack in the Depression almost everybody knew\n\nIf competition was so great why don’t they do it with themselves\n\nInstead of buying off the Congress and ruling by cartel\n\n(Chorus)\n\nDuring the Depression people fought and won back then\n\nNow the battle’s global and it was must be won again\n\nThey will try to divide us but even on the darkest day\n\nWhile I listen closely I hear a billion people say\n\n(Chorus)\n\nThe audio online and MP3 download for “Union Makes Us Strong” can be found here.
