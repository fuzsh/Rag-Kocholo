        "meta_description": "Names and Addresses by David Rovics, released 01 May 2019\n\nAt 1 am on a Wednesday morning, no one knew what was in store\r\nA fire started and quickly spread until it covered every floor\r\nStairwell blocked, no way out, smoke and fire all around\r\nParents grabbed their little babies, dropped them ten floors to the ground\r\nPeople cried to no avail, 24 stories tall\r\nEngulfed in flames, the fire ladders were just like toys, no use at all\r\n\r\nThere were no sprinklers, few smoke alarms, fire extinguisher out of date\r\nAll repairs, if ever done, always too little, too late\r\nWhen they built Grenfell they believed housing was a human right\r\nBut all that changed, now if you&#39;re not rich you should be kept out of sight\r\nOut of sight, out of town, or wrapped up neatly, plastic-clad\r\nThe flats may all be falling apart, but at least they don&#39;t look too bad\r\n\r\nThe residents had tried to warn the authorities for years and years\r\nBut all their letters, all their blog posts, all their calls fell on deaf ears\r\nCouncil housing taking space, left to rot, for by and by\r\nIt would someday be turned to dust in the forward march to gentrify\r\nAnd in the meantime if people perish with their children in their laps\r\nIt&#39;s the price the market has to pay, to house the poor in fire traps\r\n\r\nIf this were murder",
