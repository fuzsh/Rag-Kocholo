Good show. Maybe you wanna stop playin yer fiddle for a minute.\n\nâ†³ Posted by Someone at The Session 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nare you talking to donno?\n\nâ†³ Posted by Banjo Joe 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nðŸ˜€\n\nâ†³ Posted 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nIf itâ€™s the Arena one that was on more than ten years ago itâ€™s a blinder, not to be missed by any Woody fan. And, if youâ€™re not a Woody fan, well what the hellâ€™s up with you!\n\nâ†³ Posted by Steve Shaw 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is allowed - tonkheads - of course I can spell.\n\nâ†³ Posted by Someone at The Session 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nAnd if any Brit reading this is kicking themselves for missing it, worry ye not - set yer recorder, itâ€™s repeated on Beeb 4 at 3.10am. ðŸ™‚\n\nâ†³ Posted by Steve Shaw 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\njust caught you there steve - yep, youâ€™re right, cheers.\n\nâ†³ Posted by Someone at The Session 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nYes, weâ€™d set ourselves to watch that and the Roy Orbison specials too. The Woody Guthrie one just finished, and so good to see Pete Seeger and his lovely long necked river boat banjo.\n\nâ†³ Posted by ceolachan 12 years ago.\n\nBBC 4 - Arena: Woody Guthrie\n\nAs Steve has said ~ it repeats from 3:10 till 4:15 a.m. Life, including the tragic parts, not forgetting Huntingtonâ€™sâ€¦\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingtonâ€™s_disease\n\nâ†³ Posted by ceolachan 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nIâ€™m recording the Woody one at 3.10am. Iâ€™ve just checked on iPlayer, and it is the Arena one I thought it was. I had it on VHS in the 90s, one of my most cherished tapes, but the missus accidentally recorded Casualty over it! Thought Iâ€™d never see it again. Never think this thread is irrelevant to Irish music. Ask Andy Irvine, or Christy, orâ€¦orâ€¦\n\nHey, Roy Orbison too. Wot a night!\n\nâ†³ Posted by Steve Shaw 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nActually I agree Steve, Woody is not irrelevant to todayâ€™s Irish music. Are there any singers out there nowadays as politically charged as Woody? Billy Bragg maybe, but is he as popular as Woody was?\n\nâ†³ Posted by Someone at The Session 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nDavid Rovics, Ethan Miller, and others.\n\nâ†³ Posted by Banjo Joe 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nOr Anne Feeney, who does have some connection to Irish music as well as being an inspirational agitator.\n\nâ†³ Posted by Jack Campin 12 years ago.\n\nWoody arena documentary 1988\n\nâ†³ Posted by cStu 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nYes! Well foundâ€¦\n\nâ†³ Posted by ceolachan 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nWe need more ethically charged singers, songwriters, less about â€˜meâ€™ and more about â€˜usâ€™ trying to strike a balance in understanding, justice and consideration ~ for all, not just the privilegedâ€¦\n\nâ†³ Posted by ceolachan 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nYears ago when I saw David Rovics he was opened by Alistair Hulett, who has since recently passed, and who I bought two CDâ€™s from. It was part of my transformation to an interest in Scottish musicians like Ewan Maccoll.\n\nâ†³ Posted by Banjo Joe 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nAlso my exposure to DADGAD tuning as it was the first live performance I had seen of a musician using it.\n\nâ†³ Posted by Banjo Joe 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nWoody told the story of the people he knew about most without bitterness, without hectoring and without preaching. Thatâ€™s what makes his songs so great. You donâ€™t have to dig around to unravel obscurantism in his words and you donâ€™t feel that heâ€™s trying hard to make you think differently to what you already think. A good few of our modern protest singers could learn a thing or two from that.\n\nâ†³ Posted by Steve Shaw 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nâ†³ Posted by AB~Unbuild the Walls ~Listen to Gaza. 12 years ago.\n\nWe shall be free\n\nâ†³ Posted by AB~Unbuild the Walls ~Listen to Gaza. 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nI think Phil Ochs was the last great protest singer. But he was generally just a great lyricist, as well as a great singer, and a great musician. I donâ€™t ever think I will stop telling Dylan fans that there once existed a man named Phil Ochs nor stop being surprised they havenâ€™t already heard him.\n\nâ†³ Posted by Banjo Joe 12 years ago.\n\nThis is aloud\n\nEach & every person has an impact, not just the oneâ€™s whoâ€™s names are recognized.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFA1fWz9lD0\n\nplay video\n\nâ†³ Posted by AB~Unbuild the Walls ~Listen to Gaza. 12 years ago.\n\nRe: donno if this is aloud\n\nAgreed, Earl.\n\nâ†³ Posted by Steve Shaw 12 years ago.\n\nIf you are a member of The Session, log in to add a comment.\n\nIf you arenâ€™t a member of The Session yet, you can sign up now.
