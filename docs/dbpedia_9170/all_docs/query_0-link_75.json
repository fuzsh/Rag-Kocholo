        "text": "Virtual Bird & David Rovics by davidrovics\n\npublished on 2021-04-08T23:27:07Z\n\nIt's been one of the great musical pleasures of my life to have been discovered by Virtual Bird. We're eventually going to put out an album together. I'm sharing what is, in one form or another, a work in progress, one song at a time. Or really, Virtual Bird is sharing them -- I send them the lyrics, they do literally everything else. At least that's been the process so far, with all but the first track, which I initially also wrote music for as well as lyrics.\n\nGenre\n\nFolk Punk\n\nContains tracks\n\nThere Is A Cage by davidrovics\n\npublished on 2021-04-01T03:07:55Z\n\nWhen Jesus Came to Laurelhurst Park by davidrovics\n\npublished on 2021-04-14T03:58:48Z\n\nIt's Been A Year by davidrovics\n\npublished on 2021-04-08T23:25:34Z\n\nDying on the Sidewalk by davidrovics\n\npublished on 2021-04-03T04:18:32Z\n\nKelly Butte by davidrovics\n\npublished on 2021-04-16T06:10:18Z"
