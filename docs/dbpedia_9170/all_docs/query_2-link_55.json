Neighborhoods throughout the city are seeing massive amounts of old homes being demolished, old trees being cut down, and shabbily-built, overpriced new houses, condos and yuppie restaurants being built where they once stood. Rent in my apartment has almost doubled since I moved in eight years ago, at the time I’m writing this. Much of the neighborhood is really unrecognizable, compared to how it was when I moved to town. They say the politicians here are progressive, but that’s complete and utter bullshit. Most of them are servants of the rich, posing as progressives in order to get votes. How do I know this? Not by listening to their lies, but by seeing what they do — the only real measure of any politician. And what they do is allow rampant gentrification, keep rent control illegal, and create a convenient fig leaf of legitimacy for the developers by talking about the glories of high-density and “affordable” housing. Affordable? It was already affordable — not any more. High-density housing? Great idea. Let’s build subsidized cohousing apartment complexes everywhere. Not these ugly little houses made mostly of wood chips and glue that they erect in a matter of days after destroying nice old houses and logging nice old shade trees."
