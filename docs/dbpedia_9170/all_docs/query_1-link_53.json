        "text": "Most of August 14th, 2024's edition of Flashpoints -- the daily news and information show hosted by Dennis Bernstein on KPFA Community Radio in Berkeley, California -- was dedicated to music and poetry related to the ongoing genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe segment consists of Kamala Emanuel and me going back and forth with the absolutely breath-takingly powerful poet, Anita Barrows, who has written a poem every day since the genocide began i...\n\nMany of the Australians I know who are now in their forties or older participated in the convergence on the Woomera detention center for refugees just after Easter, 2002. It was a protest that became especially legendary because it was during this protest that a successful breakout of refugees detained in the facility took place.\n\nIt would be hard to overstate what an impact this protest, and the Woomera Breakout, seems to have had...\n\nChet Gardiner has delivered a wonderful, old-timey remix of this song I just wrote, which shall be included in our ever-expanding upcoming album, to be titled I Heard A Rumor.\n\nThe song may or may not be the best song I've ever written. Judging from the vast majority of comments thus far, most people understand where I'm coming from here.

Farmworkers in Tolpuddle, on the south coast of England, tried to organize a union and were deported to Australia for it. A massive movement across the country forced the government to pardon the Tolpuddle Martyrs, as the farmworkers became known, and transport them back to England.\n\nThis version of the song, from a live show in Crewe, England, was ...\n\nI wrote a lot of songs during the pandemic that had a short shelf life, for one reason or another. This one still evokes, for me, the longing that I and so many others felt for the idea of being in a place that kept Covid out along with everything that generally accompanied it, like the isolation and misery.\n\nChet Gardiner has brought so much more to the song with the addition of multiple instruments. The song will be a fine additio...\n\nThere is a widespread belief that the FBI was not just running a character assassination campaign on Martin Luther King, Jr., but that they were also directly culpable for his murder. There is also a widespread belief that the reason why they escalated their campaign to the point of killing him was that the establishment was deeply worried about the unifying impact of MLK's active plans to lead a huge occupation of Washington, DC o..."
