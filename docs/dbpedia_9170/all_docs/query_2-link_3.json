        "meta_description": "Dead by David Rovics, released 01 July 2014\n\nThere were millions of bombs falling from the sky\r\nThere were children looking up being they&#39;d die\r\nThere were millions of people marching in the street\r\nHoping that their country would meet defeat\r\nThere were military contracts, lots of dollars to be made\r\nSelling heroin and fighter jets in the arms trade\r\nThere were millions of soldiers refusing to kill\r\nThere were others taking orders directly from the Hill\r\nLike the ones who were sent off to turn the campus red\r\nWho were sent to kill the students dead\r\n\r\nThere were governors talking about military rule\r\nIf they want a bloodbath, let&#39;s bring one to their school\r\nIf they want a bloodbath -- this was the very phrase\r\nThat&#39;s the language that the governors were using those days\r\nThat&#39;s the way they thought and that&#39;s exactly what they did\r\nThere were politicians talking about gunning down kids\r\nThey said the students were worse than the Nazis in the war\r\nA quote from the governor just a few days before\r\nThe Guard was sent in to turn the campus red\r\nThey were sent to kill the students dead\r\n\r\nThere was a sniper on the rooftop, ready to conspire\r\nThere were the National Guardsmen with the orders to fire\r\nThey all lined up – ready, aim, shoot\r\nThere was President Nixon in a three-piece suit\r\nHe brought the war home like he said he would\r\nThere was an entire generation who understood\r\nThere were soldiers lined up a hundred meters away\r\nA bullet in the back is the price you gotta pay\r\nWhen the Guard is sent in to turn the campus red\r\nSent to kill the students dead",
