Â Gig hosts are generally horrified to hear from someone telling them they're hosting a Nazi performer, but in the end they find the argument unconvincing. Â I thought my critics needed a theme song, to get their message across more effectively, so I wrote one.\n\nGenre\n\nFolk & Singer-Songwriter"
