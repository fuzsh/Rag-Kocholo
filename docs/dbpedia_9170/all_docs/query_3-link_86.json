        "text": "This song written back in 1996 and sung by Iris Dement expresses so much. We glorify our freedoms (mostly privilege) that mostly white males of moderate affluence enjoy at the expense of other human beings, animals and this planet as our U.S. wars and militarism both at home and abroad continue to damage and destroy what is precious, way beyond the limited concept of freedom that so many of us buy into. Thank you for your wisdom and music, Iris Dement.\n\nA Note from Iris Dement on John Prine\n\nLike so many of you, I am deeply saddened by the passing of John Prine. It is my prayer that all the love he gave to this world will be returned ten-fold to his family — the ones he cherished the most — and that that love will help sustain them through their grief.\n\nHaving known John for some 30 years now, a flood of memories are swirling around in my head. And as John had a way of making even the most mundane seem special, any one of those memories would be justified in retelling but for now, the quality about John that keeps coming to the forefront of my mind might best be summed up by something Nelson Mandela once said: “It never hurts to think too highly of a person; often they become ennobled and act better because of it.”\n\nWe all know that John ennobled the characters in his songs. Any of us lucky enough to have seen one of his shows, knows he also did this for his audience. I, for one, happen to know he did it at truck stops and Dairy Queens, too. John was one of the all-time great ennoblers of others.\n\nSome years ago, I placed a call to my now dear friend, Reverend Samuel E. Mann and I told him I wanted to join his church but that I did not take the Bible literally and I didn’t want to say I believed a bunch of things I didn’t so I could be part of a group. To which, Sam replied: “We do not believe in a magic Jesus. Jesus lived his life loving and caring for ‘the least of these’ — that was the miracle. And it was enough!”\n\nJohn Prine was, without a doubt, one of the greatest songwriters this world will ever know. Many people more qualified than me have written about why that is. And many more will follow. Greatest or not, here’s what it comes down to for me and here’s why he rests on my heart’s mountain top: Because he cared enough to look — at me, you, all of us — until he saw what was noble and then he wrapped us up in melodies and sung us back to ourselves.\n\nThat was the miracle of John Prine. And it was enough.\n\n“Wasteland of the Free”\n\nLiving in the wasteland of the free…\n\nWe got preachers dealing in politics and diamond mines\n\nAnd their speech is growing increasingly unkind\n\nThey say they are Christ’s disciples\n\nBut they don’t look like Jesus to me\n\nAnd it feels like I am living in the wasteland of the free\n\nWe got politicians running races on corporate cash\n\nNow don’t tell me they don’t turn around and kiss them peoples’ ass\n\nYou may call me old-fashioned\n\nBut that don’t fit my picture of a true democracy\n\nAnd it feels like I am living in the wasteland of the free\n\nWe got CEO’s making two hundred times the workers’ pay\n\nBut they’ll fight like hell against raising the minimum wage\n\nAnd If you don’t like it, mister, they’ll ship your job\n\nTo some third-world country ‘cross the sea\n\nAnd it feels like I am living in the wasteland of the free\n\nLiving in the wasteland of the free\n\nWhere the poor have now become the enemy\n\nLet’s blame our troubles on the weak ones\n\nSounds like some kind of Hitler remedy\n\nLiving in the wasteland of the free\n\nWe got little kids with guns fighting inner city wars\n\nSo what do we do, we put these little kids behind prison doors\n\nAnd we call ourselves the advanced civilization\n\nThat sounds like crap to me\n\nAnd it feels like I am living in the wasteland of the free\n\nWe got high-school kids running ’round in Calvin Klein and Guess\n\nWho cannot pass a sixth-grade reading test\n\nBut if you ask them, they can tell you\n\nThe name of every crotch on MTV\n\nAnd it feels like I am living in the wasteland of the free\n\nWe kill for oil, then we throw a party when we win\n\nSome guy refuses to fight, and we call that the sin\n\nBut he’s standing up for what he believes in\n\nAnd that seems pretty damned American to me\n\nAnd it feels like I am living in the wasteland of the free\n\nLiving in the wasteland of the free\n\nWhere the poor have now become the enemy\n\nLet’s blame our troubles on the weak ones\n\nSounds like some kind of Hitler remedy\n\nLiving in the wasteland of the free"
