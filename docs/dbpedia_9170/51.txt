David Rovics (OR)

As a professional flat-picking rabble-rouser, David Rovics has taken his message to far off corners of the globe, performing with and for a veritable who’s who of the progressive left. It was his experiences growing up in a conservative small town in Connecticut that inspired his activist beginnings, and his interests in nuclear disarmament and the counterculture blossomed early in life. His parents, both classical musicians and educators, were liberal in their outlook, allowing a young Rovics the freedom to pursue these matters and his heart.

Rovics’ music has been featured on Democracy Now!, BBC, Al-Jazeera and other networks. His essays are published regularly on CounterPunch and elsewhere, and he has 200+ songs available for free download on the web. His songs conjure up a mixed bag of emotions, but it is certain he will make the revolution irresistible.

These days Rovics lives in the people’s utopia of Portland, Oregon and his message is more urgent and relevant than ever as he continues to write and agitate about anti-globalization, anti-war and social justice issues. His music is most appreciated in the activist scene, and in the Wobbly tradition of sharp social commentary, David is an acknowledge master and sage.
