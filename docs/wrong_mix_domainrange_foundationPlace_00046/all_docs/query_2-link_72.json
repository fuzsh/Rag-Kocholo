        "text": "Organocatalyzed Reactions I and II presents a timely summary of organocatalysed reactions including: a) Enantioselective C-C bond formation processes e.g. Michael-addition, Mannich-reaction, Hydrocyanation (Strecker-reaction), aldol reaction, allylation, cycloadditions, aza-Diels-Alder reactions, benzoin condensation, Stetter reaction, conjugative Umpolung, asymmetric Friedel-Crafts reactions; b) Asymmetric enantioselective reduction processes e.g. Reductive amination of aldehydes or ketones, asymmetric transfer hydrogenation; c) Asymmetric enantioselective oxidation processes;\n\nd) Asymmetric epoxidation, Bayer-Villiger oxidation; e) Enantioselective a-functionalization; f) A-alkylation of ketones, a-halogenation and a-oxidation of carbonyl compounds.\n\nDr. Rainer Mahrwald\n\nDr. Rainer Mahrwald was born in 1950. He studied chemistry at MLU Halle and subsequently joined the „Manfred von Ardenne“ Research Institute in Dresden, where he led the synthetics group. He gained his doctorate under G. Wagner in Leipzig in 1979, and went on to the Institute of Organic Chemistry at the Academy of Science in Berlin, where he remained until 1990. Following a stay at the Philipps-University in Marburg, Dr. Mahrwald qualified as a lecturer at the Humboldt University Berlin, where he is now a lecturer.\n\nAccess this book\n\nSubscribe and save\n\nSpringer+ Basic\n\nEUR 32.99 /Month\n\nGet 10 units per month\n\nDownload Article/Chapter or eBook\n\n1 Unit = 1 Article or 1 Chapter\n\nCancel anytime\n\nSubscribe now\n\nBuy Now\n\neBook EUR 117.69\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nAvailable as EPUB and PDF\n\nRead on any device\n\nInstant download\n\nOwn it forever\n\nSoftcover Book EUR 160.49\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nCompact, lightweight edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nHardcover Book EUR 160.49\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nDurable hardcover edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\n\nOther ways to access"
