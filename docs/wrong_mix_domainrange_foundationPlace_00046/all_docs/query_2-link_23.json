The wine estate is the oldest in the Swartland Wine of Origin district and home to a distinctive portfolio of wines.\n\nAllesverloren Wine Estate has been under the custodianship of the Malan Family for over 150 years. Danie Malan, fifth-generation Malan cellar master, Danie, returned to Allesverloren to hone his skills and work alongside his father, Fanie, after graduating from the Elsenburg Institute for Agricultural Training in 1987.\n\nThree years later, he became cellar master, finally taking the reins as owner in 2003.\n\nUnder Danie, his wife, Juanita, and their children, Allesverloren has continued to prosper.

Cold and wet winters are followed by warm, dry summers where grapes ripen easily with high concentrations of sugar.\n\nThe prevailing westerly winds, cool summer afternoons and the shadows of the mountain refresh the vines by late afternoon. These various meso-climates prove the ideal conditions for creating big, robust red wines.\n\nThe soils on this Swartland farm are a mixture of shale and weathered sandstone – a rocky structure crucial to the character of Allesverloren wines.\n\nIt accounts for the extraordinary depth which vine roots reach here, thus sustaining strong, healthy vines and fruit of exceptional concentration that result in deeply coloured, powerful wines.\n\nApple & Pears Limited\n\nApple & Pears Limited was incorporated in the year 2012 as an Agro Allied Industry to produce soya meal for the feed mill industry, and refined edible oil for the Nigerian market.\n\nThe company has invested millions of dollars in land, building, construction of infrastructural facilities and machinery, with one goal in mind and that is to have an integrated facility encompassing the complete value chain of the soya bean business, from sourcing, processing and extraction to the packaging and distribution of a wide range of soya products.\n\nOur People\n\nOver 500 people work with us with high professional and ethical standards throughout our supply chain.

Originally serving only small businesses, the company found it could achieve far greater buying clout by also serving a selected audience of non-business members. With that change, the growth of the warehouse club industry was off and running. In 1983, the first Costco warehouse location was opened in Seattle. Costco became the first company ever to grow from zero to $3 billion in sales in less than six years.

Since resuming the Costco name in 1997, the company has grown worldwide with total sales in recent fiscal years exceeding $192 billion.\n\nCostco has transformed the retail world. When entrepreneur Sol Price introduced a groundbreaking retail concept in San Diego, California. Price Club was the world's first membership warehouse club, a place where efficient buying and operating practices gave members access to unmatched savings.\n\nAt first, Price Club was limited exclusively to business members, who could purchase a wide range of supplies and wholesale items. Jim Sinegal, the executive vice president of merchandising, distribution and marketing, was instrumental in fine-tuning the merchandise and marketing strategies, helping to turn Price Club into a success story that changed the face of retailing worldwide.\n\nSeven years later, Jim Sinegal channeled his expertise into co-founding Costco Wholesale with Jeff Brotman, and together they opened the first warehouse in Seattle, Washington in 1983.\n\nOver the next decade, both Price Club and Costco Wholesale continued to innovate and grow, and in 1993, the two mega-retailers merged, creating a gifted leadership team that soon made Costco the world's most successful warehouse club.\n\nToday, as the company evolves, it stays true to the qualities that helped attract and retain millions of loyal members around the globe:\n\nCommitment to quality.

Instead of breaking a big cube by mostly biting or crushing it, you’ll always have a half size small cube to match the finest sweetness you need!\n\n• Small cubes dissolves always faster! Because 2 small cubes, which is roughly one big cube, has more surface area between the sugar granules and the liquid in which they are dissolving, which accelerates the reaction. The size of the cube and dissolving speed makes it ideal for consumption with tea, coffee and with anything else when you want your portioned sugar to be dissolved faster.\n\n• Espresso lovers will also enjoy the size of small cubes as you can dissolve them gently in small espresso cups.

The beneficial interest in the company’s equity is held by Nigerian and Overseas shareholders. Presently, two foreign shareholders own about 56% of the company’s paid-up share capital. The balance is held by over 75,000 individuals and institutional investors.\n\nWheat milling forms the financial backbone of our diversified company. FMN pioneered flour milling in Nigeria when its first mill was commissioned at Apapa in 1962 with a grinding capacity of 500 metric tonnes of wheat per day. Today, the Apapa milling complex has a rated capacity of over 8,000 metric tons per day making it one of the largest single site mills in the world. All the mills are manned by a team of highly trained and skilled professionals working at a high level of efficiency attested to by our ISO 9001:2008 accreditation recognizing that our flour manufacturing facilities are world class and operate within an internationally recognized Quality System. FMN had over the years made huge investments in milling technology and human capital to sustain its pre-eminent position and maintain its competitive advantage in the Nigerian flour milling industry.\n\nIn its over five-decade history, FMN’s flagship food brand, “Golden Penny”, continues to be one of the best known and the preferred brand amongst bakers, confectioneries and consumers in Nigeria. The “Golden Penny” basket of foods has now grown to include products such as semovita, masavita, pasta, noodles, refined sugar, margarine, vegetable oils, and a range of snacks and breakfast cereals, instantly recognizable in any Nigerian household.\n\nFMN’s first investment outside Flour Milling was in BAGCO in 1978. BAGCO now a Division of FMN is a pace setter in woven polypropylene sack manufacturing. With its two giant plants at Lagos and Kano, it is by far the largest and supplier of choice to many industrial and agro-allied companies in Nigeria in the packaging of flour, cement, grains, salt, detergent, fertilizer, merchandise, farm harvests, shopping, etc. The BAGCO brand which has succeeded in gaining international recognition has also entered the export market with some of its polymer bags going to the African Continent and as far as the United States of America.\n\nAnother significant milestone was the company’s foray into Cement. The company operated a large cement terminal at Apapa and marketed its cement under “Burham Cement” brand, renowned for high quality and consistency. The cement terminal had a handling capacity of 10,000 metric tonnes of cement per day. In line with Federal Government’s backward integration policy, Flour Mills invested in the United Cement Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (UNICEM) Calabar, in 2002. UNICEM operates a green field, fully integrated cement plant, with a capacity of 2.5 million metric tonnes of cement per annum. In 2015, a strategic decision was made to dispose of the investment in UNICEM and refocus the group as a publicly traded, Food and Agro-Allied company that strives to use locally sourced materials to develop and produce unique consumer products for the local markets.\n\nBeyond wheat based products, FMN Group’s strategic imperative in the years ahead is to create value in the supply chain and reduce dependence on imported raw materials. To this end, FMN has recently invested billions of Naira in its agro-allied ventures. The Group’s strategic diversification into agribusiness began in 1978 with the investment in a 10,000ha Kaboji Farm, which is close to the town of Kontagora in Niger State. We have subsequently made many other significant investments in primary processing of locally grown soybean, palm fruit, cassava, maize, and sugar cane; storage, aggregation and distribution of locally sourced grains and export commodities; manufacture, and distribution of agro-inputs, such as seeds and fertilizers. These strategic investments across the major crop value chains are setting the pace for others to follow and continue to strengthen our position as Nigeria’s Premier Food and Agro-Allied Company.\n\nTo ensure the continued viability and sustainability of our Food and Agro-Allied operations in a challenging business environment, we have also invested heavily in support services in the form of manufacturing and marketing of packaging materials; power generation; ground transport logistics; and port operations; which include shipping, customs clearing, forwarding, and a shipping agency.\n\nIndeed, FMN Group is continuously exploring opportunities for strategic partnerships to grow and enhance competitive positioning in its main line of business in Nigeria and at a future date extend its investment and business activities beyond the borders of Nigeria.\n\nFriesland Campina WAMCO Plc\n\nEveryday we nourish Nigerians with quality dairy nutrition\n\nOur Company\n\nThe country’s foremost dairy company and market leader is FrieslandCampina WAMCO Nigeria PLC, an affiliate of Royal FrieslandCampina in The Netherlands.

As it is today for tokunbo (foreign used) cars, so it was then for tokunbo motorcycles, they were the status quo.\n\nBy 1987, a brand new motorcycle sold for N150,000 and a tokunbo one sold for N100,000 – N90,000. Things would have continued this way to this day, but for the intervention of a 25 years old Nigerian, named Innocent Chukwuma, the founder of Innoson Motors (IVM).\n\nDriven by his passion for people and his core business philosophy of bringing down costs and passing the gain to customers, he pioneered the first Made-in-Nigeria Motorcycle brand that sold for as low as N60,000. By year 2002, he had successfully driven out tokunbo (foreign used) motorcycles out of Nigeria forever!\n\nThe Present…\n\nWe are manufacturing durable and affordable brand new automobiles for Africans. Our brand new automobiles are selling for almost the cost of their tokunbo equivalents. And they are as good as any foreign automobile brand you know.\n\nThe statistics are alarming, according to a recent research by PricewatershouseCoopers (PwC), the ratio of brand new automobiles to foreign used ones on Nigerian road is 1 : 131. Meaning that for every brand new car bought, there are 131 tokunbo ones!\n\nOUR PURPOSE\n\n…Why do we exist?\n\nTo eradicate “tokunbo” (foreign used) automobiles from Africa\n\nOUR VISION\n\n…what do we want to achieve?\n\nTo become the pride of African roads i.e. Africa’s most preferred automobile brand\n\nOUR MISSION\n\n…how do we achieve these?\n\nTo make durable and affordable brand new automobiles for Africans\n\nIntercontinental Distillers Ltd\n\nWHO WE ARE\n\nThe history of Intercontinental Distillers Limited dates back to 1749 when two Italians, Justerini and Brooks came together to form a wine and spirit business which they called J&B (derived from the initial of their names).\n\nJ&B went through series of acquisition and ownership change until it became what was known as International Distillers & Vintners (IDV). IDV itself was the spirit division of the then Grand Metropolitan Plc of the United Kingdom.\n\nGrand Metropolitan Plc’s strategy to refocus her business, with the view to capture the international market, gave rise to the incorporation of International Distillers Nigeria Limited (IDNL) in1983.\n\nInternational Distillers Nigeria Limited (IDNL) as it then was, commenced production in 1984 with Eagle Aromatic Schnapps on a manual line. The staff strength then was 53, of which three were expatriates.\n\nTo complement Eagle Schnapps, the company imported and marketed tested brands such as SMIRNOFF, BAILEY’S Irish Cream and GILBEYS London Dry Gin. IDNL subsequently commenced a series of expansion which saw it through its first decade of operation with increased popularity, market acceptance and preference for her products such as Chelsea London Dry Gin which was introduced in 1987.\n\nThe company grew in size through the development of a wide range of portfolio of successful brands, relying on a sound understanding of the Nigerian wines and spirit market, and indeed of the West African sub–region. In 1997, International Distillers Nigeria Limited metamorphosed into Intercontinental Distillers Limited (IDL).\n\nToday, IDL produces and markets leading products such as Eagle Aromatic Schnapps, Chelsea London Dry Gin, Squadron Dark Rum, Bull London Dry Gin, Bull Dark Rum, Action Bitters, Confam Bitters, DeROK Cafe Liqueur, DeROK Chocolate Flavoured Liqueur, Commodore Aromatic Schnapps, Chapeau Wine, Veleta Fruit Wine.\n\nThe Company operates from a purpose-built distillery and bottling plant located at KM 11, Ota–Idiroko road, Ota, Ogun State and has its Head Office located at Plot 2, No. 3 Ladipo Oluwole Street, Off Oba Akran Avenue in Ikeja, Lagos State.\n\nIDL has a network of branches and distributors that covers the entire nation. It operates from regional offices which are complemented by Forty–one(41) depot locations.\n\nThe Board of Directors and Management is made up of time-tested professionals in business and in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods Industry. This is a key factor to our success story.\n\nOn April 20th 2012, IDL became NIS ISO 9001:2008 certified. This is in reinforcement of her commitment to producing quality drinks that meet customers satisfaction at all times.\n\nWHAT WE DO\n\nWe are producers and marketers of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.The operations of IDL are manned by time tested professionals in the business and in the industry. This is a key factor to a success story which we intend to maintain.\n\nWe produce and market top quality beverages at a purpose built distillery located on the Ota-Idiroko road, (near Lagos) in Nigeria. Our products are available in the West African sub-region.\n\nWe have a network of highly mobile salesmen and executives based at our various depots and an array of distributors spread all over the country.\n\nProducts manufactured & marketed: Eagle Aromatic Schnapps, Chelsea London Dry Gin, Squadron Dark Rum, Bull London Dry Gin, Bull Dark Rum, Action Bitters, Confam Bitters, DeROK Cafe Liqueur, DeROK Chocolate Flavoured Liqueur, Commodore Aromatic Schnapps, Chapeau Wine, Veleta Fruit Wine.\n\nMISSION\n\nWe are engaged in researching, producing and marketing first choice quality drinks that satisfy the needs of our customers. We aim at providing the highest returns to our stakeholders.\n\nVISION\n\nTo be the leading company of first choice quality drinks.\n\nInternational Breweries PLC\n\nInternational Breweries Plc was incorporated in December 1971 by its founder and first Chairman, Dr. Lawrence Omole under the name International Breweries Limited. The Company commenced production of its flagship product Trophy Lager in December 1978 with an installed capacity of 200,000 hectoliters per annum.\n\nFollowing the increasing demand for its products, in December 1982 the Company embarked on an expansion programme to increase its capacity to 500,000 hectoliters annually. The company was listed on the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange in April 1995.\n\nIn 2008 the Warsteiner Group sold its majority shareholding to the Castel Group and in January 2012 SABMiller Plc entered into a strategic alliance with the Castel group. During this period, significant investment was made which transformed the company and provided it with a solid foundation for growth and profitability. Starting with just two brands, Trophy Lager and Betamalt the Company has since 2010 introduced Grand Malt, grand lager, Hero Lager, Castle Milk Stout, Castle Lite, Redds, Eagle lager, Eagle Stout and most recently the introduction of premium brands like Budweiser.\n\nIn 2017 the Company through a scheme of merger sanctioned by the Federal High Court, merged with Intafact Beverages Limited and Pabod Breweries Limited (companies with similar objects) in other to provide for the optimization of efficiencies, leverage on economies of scale and ensure shareholder value creation amongst others.\n\nThis has increased our production facilities apart from ilesa, to Port Harcourt, Onitsha and Ogun State with corporate headquarters of the Company in Lagos.\n\nIn addition, the Company operates depots in Ibadan, Lagos, Port Harcourt, Abuja, Benin and Ilorin to facilitate the re-distribution of its products in the wider urban area.\n\nWith the new strategy position and increasing portfolio of local and world class beverages, International Breweries PLC is fully positioned to satisfy increasing consumer demand and poised to be the leading brand in Nigeria delivering superior returns for shareholders.\n\nKellogg Company\n\nBringing Our Best to the World\n\nFrom snacks and frozen foods to our breakfast icons, we’re passionate about our family of brands and the markets we’re in.
