        "text": "What Is a Parts Washer?\n\nParts washers are machines that clean parts produced in factories and other facilities. There are a wide variety of products, from small to large parts that are compatible with various cleaning methods. Cleaning methods include ultrasonic, vacuum, and jet cleaning. The cleaning method is determined according to the type of contamination and parts. There are also a variety of installation methods for parts to be cleaned, including automatic transport and manual movement.\n\nIn addition to cleaning, some models are equipped with air blow drying and vacuum dryers.\n\nUses of Parts Washers\n\nParts washers are used to clean a wide variety of parts, from small to large. In some cases, high water pressure is used to clean and deburr parts at the same time.\n\nUltrasonic cleaning is used to clean fine parts, such as semiconductors.\n\nCutting parts for electronics and precision parts, and smaller parts for automobile engines and undercarriages, are often placed in a basket and rotated like a washing machine for cleaning.\n\nLarge workpieces are brought in one by one and cleaned by jetting, etc.\n\nPrinciple of Parts Washers\n\nThe principle of parts washers depends on the model but is often similar to that of dishwashers or washing machines. Parts are placed in a drum and rotated with water and detergent to remove dirt.\n\nParts washers also offer a variety of cleaning methods. Each cleaning method is selected for its unique characteristics.\n\nJet cleaning is a method that uses high-pressure jets of water and detergent to remove dirt. Water-soluble alkaline detergents may be used, but hot water can be used for powerful degreasing.\n\nVacuum cleaning is a method in which air is exhausted from a chamber made of metal and the pressure is lowered to remove dirt. This method can remove even the smallest dirt that is stuck in small holes.\n\nDeaeration cleaning uses higher air pressure than vacuum cleaning, but the same principle of degreasing is used. Since it does not require as expensive equipment as vacuum cleaning, costs can be kept low.\n\nUltrasonic cleaning removes dirt by immersing parts in water and applying ultrasonic waves to remove dirt. Oil and hard-to-remove dirt can be removed without rubbing. It is also used to clean fine particles from semiconductors, etc."
