The classical tradition in Telugu is one of the richest, most original, and least explored of all South Asian literatures. We hope this collection will bring the world of Telugu poetry to the awareness of a wider audience of aﬁcionados, connoisseurs, and scholars. An introductory essay sets out our understanding of the evolving structure and dynamics of this tradition from its beginnings in the eleventh century to the twentieth century, when classical styles were gradually transformed and replaced by modern modes. We have attempted a synthesis that reﬂects our own work of the past two decades but that also stands ﬁrmly on the foundations laid by great Telugu scholars of this century: Vedamu Venkatarayasastri, Manavalli Ramakrishnakavi, Veturi Prabhakara Sastri, Rallapalli Anantakrishnasarma, Arudra, Bommakanti Srinivasacaryulu, Bommakanti Venkatasingaracarya, Balantrapu Nalinikantaravu, Bh. Krishnamurti, and others. Our debt to these pioneering scholars is profound. We wish to acknowledge with gratitude the generous support provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities during the years 1994 – 1996 —support that allowed us to meet regularly for sustained periods of work on this anthology—as well as Sharon Dickson’s skillful ministrations at the Center for South Asian Studies, University of Wisconsin.

The Sanskrit diphthongs e, o, ai, and au are always long and are unmarked; we mark the short Dravidian vowels ˘e and ˘o. Sanskrit names ending in a long vowel, appearing in Telugu texts, are consistently marked as short, in keeping with Telugu practice: Sı¯ta < Sı¯ta¯, Draupadi < Draupadı¯. Long vowels resulting from sandhi combinations, except for diphthongs, are marked with ˆ. The consonant sounds .t, d., .th, d.h, n., and .l are retroﬂex, pronounced by turning the tip of the tongue back toward the palate. In transliterating Telugu text, we have improvised a mark for plosives voiced after a nasal (drutamu: whether the nasal is a sunna or an arasunna or in its svatva-ru¯pa). A line under the plosive indicates the reciter has an option of pronouncing it as either voiced or unvoiced, according to context or convention of recitation. For sufﬁxes following upon an inﬁnitive, we reproduce the Telugu orthography. When for other reasons an unvoiced plosive turns voiced, we follow Telugu graphic conventions. No diacritics are used for the names of modern authors.\n\nxiii\n\n00-C2162-FM 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page xiv\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nA TELUGU WORLD\n\nmahi mun va¯g-anus´a¯sanun.d.u sr.jiyimpan kun.d.alıˆndrun.d.u tanmahanı¯ya-sthiti-mu¯lamai niluva s´rı¯na¯thun¯. d.u provan maha¯¯mahulai somud.u bha¯skarun.d.u ve˘layimpan so˘mpu va¯t.illun ¯ı bahul.aˆndhrokti-maya-prapan˜camuna tat-pra¯galbhyam´ u¯hin˜ce˘dan Live the exuberance of language, ﬁrst created by the Maker of Speech. A thousand tongues at the root, moon and sun above, God himself within: a whole world inheres in what Telugu says.1\n\nThis verse by the sixteenth-century poet Ra¯mara¯jabhu¯s.an.a celebrates a vital and continuous literary tradition, fully formed and mature, in the language of Andhra in southern India. The poet, working at a historic moment of intense creativity in Telugu, points to a canon already in place. Each poet is paronomastically identiﬁed with a divinity. First there is Va¯g-anus´a¯sanun.d.u, the Maker of Speech—Brahma¯, in the classical Hindu pantheon—who has both created and married the goddess Va¯c, Language or Speech. Within the Telugu tradition, however, this is also the title given to the ﬁrst poet Nannaya (eleventh century), who established the contours of poetry and poetic style. ¯ dis´es.a, The thousand tongues belong to the serpent Kundalıˆndrun.d.u-A ¯ who holds the world on his thousand hoods; Adis´es.a is also the underlying 1.

But the same title applies to the second great Telugu poet, Tikkana, who is said to have performed a sacriﬁce known as kun.d.ali (thus explaining his title here). The moon, Soma, is probably Na¯cana Somana¯tha, the author of the Telugu [Uttara-]harivam.s´amu (fourteenth century).3 Bha¯skara, the sun, is Hul.akki Bha¯skara, who produced a Telugu Ra¯ma¯yan.a (late thirteenth to early fourteenth centuries). And God himself, the Lord of Prosperity, is S´rı¯na¯tha, the fourteenth-century poet who revolutionized Telugu taste. Together, and also no doubt accompanied by other, unnamed poets, these ﬁgures created and maintained— in the eyes of the poet who sang this verse—an entire universe, rich with life and feeling, fashioned in and by language. And it is to this language, imagined as a goddess, that the poet pays tribute. Our anthology attempts to represent, in a modest way, the world of Telugu poetry as imagined by poets such as Ra¯mara¯jabhu¯s.an.a. We present selections from each of the major poets over a period of some nine centuries, from the eleventh to the nineteenth, on the verge of modern times (although in some sense the classical tradition has continued in Andhra into the twentieth century).4 Perhaps something of the integrity of this literary world and the striking originality of its makers will come through the distance of time and language. In the following pages we offer a synoptic overview of the Telugu literary tradition, pausing to consider certain key ﬁgures in detail. BEGINNINGS\n\nTelugu literature begins with Nannaya, but Telugu language is much more ancient, attested in place names from as early as the second century a.d. Prose inscriptions from the middle of the ﬁrst millennium show a gradual evolution toward the classical language. Verse and the appearance of a literary style are attested in inscriptions from the late ninth century on (or even earlier: the Turime˘l.l.a inscription of Vikramaˆditya I, in the seventh century, is sometimes seen as already marked by a “high” style).5 Early references to 2. For a seventeenth-century version of the story identifying Patan ˜ jali with the serpent, see Ra¯mabhadra Dı¯k.sita, Patan˜jali-caritra (Bombay: Nirnaya Sagar Press, 1934). 3. The original title was probably Harivam.s´amu; later generations preﬁxed Uttara- to dis˘ r r ¯apragad.a’s Harivam.s´amu. tinguish his work from E ¯¯the great modern poets, Vis´vana¯tha Satyana¯ra¯yan.a (d. 1976), con4. Surprisingly, one of tinued the classical tradition directly. See the concluding section of this introduction, p. 51. 5. See Korada Mahadeva Sastri, Historical Grammar of Telugu with Special Reference to Old Telugu, ca. 200 b.c.—1000 a.d. (Anantapur: Sri Venkateswara University, 1969), 35–36; Bh. Krishnamurti, “Shift of Authority in Written and Oral Texts: The Case of Telugu,” in Syllables of\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 3\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\n¯ ndhra-bha¯s.¯a6 or Te˘nugu or Te˘lugu: 7 the etymology of the language call it A the latter term has been much debated, with some tenaciously arguing for a Sanskrit folk-etymology from trilin˙ga, the land of the three lin˙gas, 8 and others deriving it from caste or tribal names (Te˘le˘gas, Te˘la¯ganya).9 Most probably the name is related to the Dravidian root te˘n, “south”; thus, Telugu ¯ would be the southern language, in contrast to Sanskrit or any of the 10 Prakrits. Telugu is classed as Dravidian and is thus a sister language to Tamil, the oldest attested Dravidian language, with a continuous literary tradition going back at least to the ﬁrst century a.d. The cultural presence of Tamil radiated northward into Andhra from very early times: Nannaya seems aware of a great tradition of Tamil poetry,11 and the powerful forces of Tamil religion, with its concomitant institutional features, unquestionably played a major role in the history of Telugu culture. It is also important to acknowledge that Telugu crystallized as a distinct literary tradition after the full maturation of Sanskrit erudition, including the domains of poetic theory, grammar, social ideology, scholastic philosophy, and so on. Unlike Tamil, which absorbed Sanskrit texts and themes in a slow process of osmosis and adaptation over more than a thousand years, Telugu must have swallowed Sanskrit whole, as it were, even before Nannaya. The enlivening presence of Sanskrit is everywhere evident in Andhra civilization, as it is in the Telugu language: every Sanskrit word is potentially a Telugu word as well, and literary texts in Telugu may be lexically Sanskrit or Sanskritized to an enormous degree, perhaps sixty percent or more. Telugu speech is also rich in Sanskrit loans, although the semantics of Sanskrit in Telugu are entirely distinctive. We will return to this theme.\n\nSky, ed. D.

One might think of Andhra as one of the great internal frontier zones of South Indian civilization and at the same time, as such, a melting-pot—a domain of intense interaction among rival cultural currents, with their associated social and historical formations. It is not simple to isolate the various currents or to date their appearance in Andhra history, and one must bear in mind that much of the prehistory—before Nannaya—is hardly known. Still, there are some things that can be said in a general and perhaps slightly abstract manner. The frontier is structured, in part, along geographic lines. Andhra is divided in three: (1) the coastal zone (Andhra proper), largely deltaic, especially to the north, where the Goda¯varı¯ and Kr.s.n.a¯ Rivers ﬂow into the Bay of Bengal (as elsewhere in South India, the delta is associated with heavy Brahmin settlement and inﬂuence); (2) Te˘lan˙ga¯n.a, the dry Deccan plateau, home to peasants, artisans, and warriors; and (3) Ra¯yalası¯ma (“the royal domain”), the southern reaches of this plateau, tapering off into the mixed ecological regions of northern Tamil Nadu.12 In early medieval times, Ra¯yalası¯ma was apparently far more fertile than it is today. But even the fertile delta to the north was largely wilderness beyond the immediate proximity of the great rivers; this situation changed dramatically only in the nineteenth century, when the major anicuts were created, thus opening up vast areas for rice cultivation. In medieval times the wild drylands of the interior, peopled by shepherds, artisans, warriors, and a growing proportion of agriculturists, were bound up linguistically, culturally, and sometimes politically with the hardly less untamed but wetter regions of coast and delta. Andhra history and culture reﬂect the constant interplay of these ecologically distinct zones, especially of the delta and the Deccan, with cultural innovation often emerging in the latter to be reshaped and domesticated in the former. Over time, ever more serious attempts at integration were in evidence as states based in one region spilled over into, or attempted to absorb, political units rooted in the other areas. Early Andhra history, just this side of prehistory, reveals a Deccan-based kingdom, that of the Sa¯tava¯hanas, represented mostly by inscriptions in Prakrit, with only tenuous linkages to the coast. The early state structures in coastal Andhra (especially to the north, in the region known as Vengi) culminated in the rule of the Eastern Cha¯l.ukyas, who eventually married into the Chola system in the Tamil south. Under the Cha¯l.ukya king Ra¯jara¯janarendra, Telugu literature as we know it began, with the poet Nannaya. By the thirteenth century, the center of Telugu state12. See discussion on Senji in V. Narayana Rao, D. Shulman, and Sanjay Subrahmanyam, Symbols of Substance, Court and State in Na¯yaka Period Tamilnadu (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1992), 41– 44.\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 5\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\nbuilding had shifted to the Deccan plateau under the Ka¯katı¯yas, who brought massive tank irrigation to the dry zone and instituted creative forms of military organization based on personal loyalty to the king or queen.13 Key patterns of Telugu culture were established during this period and later adopted and creatively reworked by the successor-states, including the Vijayanagara super-state based in Hampi, to the west of historic Andhra. To what extent do these relatively distinct regional-ecological systems combine in awareness to form a single cultural entity — Andhra, as we think of it today? How old is such an awareness? The great poet Tikkana, in the thirteenth century, is apparently the ﬁrst to refer to an imagined community named Andhra (andhraˆval.i),14 but the boundaries of this community are unknown. Originally, the term seems to be a purely dynastic family title. The earliest fully formed reference to a geographical entity known as Andhra within the Telugu tradition may well be S´rı¯na¯tha’s, in the late fourteenth century: here the temple of Daks.aˆra¯ma in Konası¯ma is said to be the center (karn.ika¯ ) of a lotus that is itself identiﬁed as the middle part of the Andhra country (a¯ndhra-bhu¯-bhuvana-madhyamu).15 This suggests that Andhra extends far beyond the delta, conceived (perhaps metaphorically) as the center of this cultural and geographical universe; deltaic Andhra, for S´rı¯na¯tha, is the symbolic heart of the culture. There are, however, other man.d.ala-like schemes superimposed on the geographic realities of medieval Andhra. For example, the important temple to S´iva-Mallikaˆrjunasva¯mi at S´rı¯s´ailam on the Andhra-Karnataka border to the west is said to have four encompassing gateways: Tripuraˆntakam to the east, Siddhavat.am to the south, Alampu¯r to the west, and Uma¯-ma¯hes´varam in Pa¯lamu¯ru (near Accampet.a) to the north.16 In this mapping the center has shifted dramatically to the west, to the point of intersection between Te˘lan˙ga¯n.a and Ra¯yalası¯ma. This tendency to reorient and to situate a new center contextually is perfectly 13. On Ka¯katı¯ya history, see Cynthia Talbot, “Political Intermediaries in Ka¯katı¯ya Andhra, 1175–1325,” Indian Economic and Social History Review 31.3 (1994), 261– 89; idem, “Temples, Donors, and Gifts: Patterns of Patronage in Thirteenth Century South India,” Journal of Asian Studies 50 (1991), 308 – 40. ¯ ndhra-maha¯bha¯ratamu (Hyderabad: Balasarasvati Book Depot, 1984), 4.1.30. 14.

Like so many parts of India, historic Andhra has no clear boundaries. In the early sixteenth century, the conquering emperor Kr.s.n.adevara¯ya came from Vijaya¯ ndhranagara to S´rı¯ka¯kul.am, in Kr.s.n.a District, where the god is known as A maha¯vis.n.u or Te˘nugu-ra¯ya—perhaps demarcatng yet another center.17 This same king also went on pilgrimage to Simhaˆcalam, at the northern edge of Telugu speech, and to Tirupati, at its southern limit,18 as if consciously tracing the contours of his kingdom. The frontier inheres in Andhra culture in several powerful ways. If we look ﬁrst to the northern delta, we strain to see traces of a largely invisible Buddhist proto-Maha¯ya¯na culture ﬂourishing in what is called Konası¯ma, “the corner” between the two great rivers. We know something of this Buddhist culture from archaeological ﬁndings at Na¯gaˆrjunako˘n.d.a and Amara¯vati, and from the surviving works of the famous philosopher Na¯gaˆrjuna, who may have spoken a language that was a precursor to classical Telugu. Five major temple sites in Andhra—Daks.aˆra¯ma, Bhı¯maˆra¯ma, Somaˆra¯ma, Ks.¯ıra¯ra¯ma, and Amaraˆra¯ma—were in all likelihood originally Buddhist shrines, as the name a¯ra¯ma suggests. Today all ﬁve are entirely Hindu, though Buddhist statuary is scattered throughout the temple courtyards. This process of Brahminizing an early Buddhist substratum, so evident in the ﬁve shrines, must have been general and formative. It was successful in the sense that Buddhism disappeared entirely from Andhra. And yet the Buddhist presence seems to have left behind an active and creative level of esotericism in praxis and concept, including Yogic, Tantric, alchemical, and “magical” trends that became a diagnostic feature of medieval Telugu culture.19 One sees hints of this fascination with esoteric strains of thought in central works of Telugu poetry such as Pe˘ddana’s Manucaritramu—the height of the classical tradition—as well as in a range of other textual traditions, such as Gaurana’s ﬁfteenth-century summation of the Na¯tha mythology, Nava-na¯tha-caritra, one of the earliest and richest accounts of the magically oriented Na¯ths in ¯ mukta-ma¯lyada, ed. Vedamu Venkatarayasastri, 2nd ed. (Madras: 17. Kr.s.n.adevara¯ya, A Vedamy Venkatarayasastri and Brothers, 1964), 1.11; see p. 168. It is highly unusual for a tem¯ ndhra-vis.n.u, in the classical pura¯n.ic tradition, ple to be named after a community in this way; A is the name of a king, perhaps a memory going back as far as the Sa¯tava¯hanas. “Andhra” here may thus be a dynastic title, and as such extended to the region that became known as historical Andhra. A similar perspective probably applies to the Andhras mentioned in early Sanskrit sources such as Aitareya Bra¯hman.a [S´unah.s´epha]. By the medieval period, a conﬂation of the dynastic and regional terms was clearly well-established. On S´rı¯ka¯kul.am, see the selection from ¯ ndhra-na¯yaka-s´atakamu (Visakhapatram: Nirmala Publications, 1975) Ka¯sula Prus.ottamakavi, A on pp. 248 –50 and our forthcoming essay on the temple tradition from this site. 18. Ven˙kat.am at Tirupati is already clearly seen as the northern boundary of the Tamil country in Can˙kam poetry, from the early centuries a.d. 19. See our paper [in press] on the assimilation and transformation of a Buddhist ritual in S´rı¯na¯tha’s pura¯n.a on Daks.aˆra¯ma, the Bhı¯mes´vara-pura¯n.amu.\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 7\n\nintroduction\n\n7\n\nany Indian language. And while we ﬁnd esoteric praxis and ideology in many forms throughout medieval South India,20 the organic and generative impact of these strands on Telugu religion and literature were perhaps deeper than in any other major south Indian tradition, with the possible exception of Kerala. There was also, almost certainly, an archaic Jaina impact on Telugu culture, of which little is now known; the oldest extant work on metrics, Kavi-janaˆs´rayamu, is by a Jaina author, Malliya Recana.21 Look now to the harsh Deccan hinterland, a true frontier in many senses. A long process of settlement privileged the resilient warrior, perhaps epitomized by the Deccani god Vı¯rabhadra—S´iva as hero. We ﬁnd him at Lepaˆksi, in Ra¯yalası¯ma, at the southern edge of today’s Andhra—a black, furious deity.22 The cultic history of the Deccan must include the expansion of Vı¯ras´aivism, originally a militant movement of antinomian worshipers of S´iva drawn mostly from the so-called “left-hand” castes, that is, those not tied to the land (artisans, merchants, migratory groups, and so on). At S´rı¯s´ailam, in the midst of the wilderness, one can observe stages of a long process— still encapsulated in the temple ritual—that seems to have taken this shrine through Buddhist, Vı¯ras´aiva, more normative S´aiva, and ﬁnally Brahminized/Sanskritized phases. The exotic “heroic” mode is, in any case, still apparent throughout this region, and we may look here for the ﬁrst signs of that characteristic individualism—a surprisingly powerful and self-conscious presentation of self as subject—that turns up with consistency in Telugu poetry from at least the time of S´rı¯na¯tha onward. We would go so far as to posit this interest in the uniquely individual subject, initially present in unsystematic occurrences in the literature but later exfoliated luxuriantly in Na¯yaka-period texts,23 as a diagnostic feature of the Telugu tradition over many centuries. To these two prominent thematic drives, each in its own way born of the frontier, that cut through varying strata, periods, and milieux, we may add a third, from the still more deeply internalized boundary zone of language. As the verse quoted at the beginning of this essay suggests, Telugu poets have consistently been drawn to an examination of language in its life-creating, world-generating aspect. Perhaps something of this fascination derives from the experience of living within a linguistic reality that is itself unusually lyrical and ﬂuid, a constant exposure to language itself as musical sound. It is 20. For example, in the Tamil Cittar/Siddhas. 21. The common place-name ending -pa¯d.u may reﬂect Jaina settlement. Jaina works may well have been destroyed in the course of prolonged conﬂict with Vı¯ras´aivas (vying for the same “left-hand” constituency), as Pa¯lkuriki Somana¯tha’s Basava-pura¯n.amu suggests. 22. See D. Shulman, “The Masked Goddess in the Mirror,” in Festschrift Gu¨nther Sontheimer. 23. This led directly to the appearance of the ﬁrst personal diaries in South India, begin¯ nandaran˙ga Pil.l.ai in the mid– eighteenth century, writing in Tamil but still within ning with A the late-Na¯yaka cultural mode.\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 8\n\n8\n\nintroduction\n\nprobably not by chance that Telugu became the predominant vehicle of south Indian classical music. This association of Telugu speakers with music is an old one, clearly attested in Tamil in Cayan˙ko˘n.t.a¯r’s Kalin˙kattup-paran.i in the early twelfth century.24 Certainly, the Telugu tradition has pushed the exploration of problems of language (speech, grammar, meter, words) in relation to story, perception, and creativity to a point of unusually powerful feeling and insight. FIRST POET: NANNAYA\n\nGreat literatures classicize their own texts, selecting certain major works or authors over others; they also tend to produce retrospective narratives to make sense of this selection. The result, in the case of Telugu, is a simple developmental scheme that can be found, in one form or another, in all modern histories of this literature, in Telugu or other languages. In this framing of the tradition, all begins with Nannaya, the First Poet (and First Grammarian, since an ordered, premeditated grammar must, in this perspective, precede both normal linguistic reality and the creation of poetry). Earlier poetic works may be presumed to have existed, but they are lost. Nannaya is said to have initiated the age of pura¯n.a-like compositions with his adaptation of the ﬁrst two and a half books of the Maha¯bha¯rata epic into Telugu.25 After some four centuries, this vogue in pura¯n.ic poetry gave way to full-ﬂedged ka¯vya or prabandha texts— elevated and sustained courtly compositions. The transition to ka¯vya of this type is usually said to have reached its apogee in the Golden Age of Telugu literature at the court of Kr.s.n.adevar¯aya of Vijayanagara (1509 –1529). Following the breakdown of the Vijayanagara state-system in 1565, literature is seen as slowly sinking; with the displacement southward of Telugu political power into the Tamil country under the Na¯yaka kings (sixteenth to eighteenth centuries), new forms of poetic production, some of them supposedly “decadent,” became prominent in the afterglow of the classical efﬂorescence. Modern poetry then represents a blinding ﬂash of revolutionary brilliance against the smoldering backdrop of the Na¯yaka and post-Na¯yaka decline. Such is the standard format, a still regnant mythology of poetic evolution, useful, perhaps, for rudimentary classiﬁcation of the poets. It bears almost no relation to the deeper currents of this amazingly rich and in24. Cayan˙ko˘n.t.a¯r, Kalin˙kattup-paran.i (Madras: South India Saiva Siddhanta Works, 1975), 470: some of the survivors of the defeated Kalin˙ga army disguise themselves as musicans (pa¯n.ar) from the Telugu country as they ﬂee the conquering Chola force. 25. The term pura¯n.a in Telugu, unlike the Sanskrit usage, usually applies to campu ¯ compositions of mixed prose and verse with a strong narrative intent.\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 9\n\nintroduction\n\n9\n\ntricate tradition. It seems likely that this schematic vision is itself derived from a seventeenth-century retrospective ordering of previous works in a manner that ﬁrst produced the idealized image of a Golden Age centered around Kr.s.n.adevar¯aya with his eight great poets, the as.t.a-dig-gajas, homologized to the eight elephants who hold up the cardinal points of space. (In this sense, literary history and traditional history have marched in tandem; seventeenth-century texts ﬁrst seem to have imagined Kr.s.n.adevara¯ya in the mode of synoptic “great king.”) Indeed, one could argue that it was this later moment of integration, self-reﬂection, synthesis in grammar and linguistic metaphysics, and retrospective narrativization, in the mid-seventeenthcentury Deccan, that marks the true peak of originality in the mature medieval tradition, if such a temporal deﬁnition has any meaning. We can attempt to substitute for the standard evolutionary scheme a more subtle template that will take account of the profound shifts in style and expressivity as well as changes in major cultural themes and premises. Certain key, perhaps emblematic, ﬁgures help us to orient this picture of the tradition: Nannaya, Tikkana, S´rı¯na¯tha, Pe˘ddana, and Kr.s.n.adevara¯ya, in the early stages. Each of these poets, by virtue of creative innovation, changed the rules of play and transformed the classical tradition. Here again we must begin with Nannaya, not as grammarian 26 but as the poet who ﬁrst produced a Telugu style commensurate with a complex, and entirely Telugu, sensibility. Clearly, he knew that he was doing this—knew that he was innovative in creating a musical and ﬂowing poetic form, dense with expressive possibilities and unique to his mother tongue. Listen to the way he describes himself (in the third person): sa¯ramatin kavıˆndrulu prasanna-katha¯-kalitaˆrtha-yukti-lon a¯rasi melu na¯n itarul´aks.ara-ramyatan a¯darimpa na¯na¯-ruciraˆrtha-su¯kti-nidhi nannaya bhat.t.u te˘nungunan maha¯bha¯rata-sam.hita¯-racana-bandhurud.´ayye˘ jagad-dhitambugan Nannaya then became absorbed in composing in Tenungu the whole Maha¯bha¯rata collection. His carefully uttered words glow with multiple meanings: poets with penetrating minds follow the lively narrative through to its inner purpose, while others give themselves to the harmony of the sounds.27\n\nLet us restate this achievement in somewhat different terms: what Nannaya invented was a style of poetic narrative in which the story line is clear, pleasing, and uninterrupted, but that at the same time allows the hearer/reader\n\n26. On the cultural importance of the image of the ﬁrst grammarian, see p. 49. 27. Nannaya, 1.1.25.\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 10\n\n10\n\nintroduction\n\nto reﬂect on it and to appreciate the subtleties of meaning. Moreover, the texture—which includes such components as lexical choices, the play of meter, and, above all, the way Sanskrit and Telugu are combined—is harmonious, economical, and musical. Nannaya himself suggests the following two hallmarks of his poetry: prasanna-katha¯-kalitaˆrtha-yukti, “lively narrative . . . with its inner purpose”—a feature perceptible only to “poets with penetrating minds”—and aks.ara-ramyata, “the harmony of sounds,” the phonoaesthetic interplay of syllables. All of this requires a particular and characteristic blending of Sanskrit and Dravidian words and a creative use of Sanskrit compounds, in a manner unknown in “pure” Sanskrit but, after Nannaya, paradigmatic for Telugu. The long Sanskrit compounds that appear throughout Nannaya’s poetry, in meters often adapted, again creatively, from Sanskrit into Telugu, are organized semantically rather than metrically. They tend to be longer than is common in earlier Sanskrit poems, and they often spill over line endings, since Telugu meter, unlike Sanskrit, allows complex enjambment. Put differently, the Telugu patterns established by Nannaya’s work are not limited by meter: one reads a Telugu verse by breaking at syntactic-semantic pauses. As a result, the stanza allows for more complex syntactic structures and tremendous variation in cadence. The metrical skeleton hardly ever shows through the poem. What one hears, or notices, is the play of muscle and ﬂesh that constitutes texture. By contrast, a verse that mechanically reveals its metrical organization, its caesura breaks and line endings, is considered either as a failure or as belonging to another level of the tradition, perhaps purely oral. It is this kind of sophisticated texturing, with its complex ﬂow of subtle words and sentences, that Nannaya pioneered, and it is this that helps to explain the miracle of transmutation so characteristic of Telugu literature from that time onward, whereby whole pieces of Sanskrit phraseology can be lifted from a Sanskrit source and reworked into a borrowed Sanskrit meter, and yet be entirely and amazingly Telugu. This same process applies to the transformation of genre. Nannaya’s Maha¯bha¯rata both is and is not a pura¯n.a. It follows the inherited story line, usually with remarkable ﬁdelity to the prototype. But it also allows, indeed demands, reﬂection upon this narrative and an aesthetic savoring of the texture of its telling on the part of the reader, a process mostly unknown to Sanskrit pura¯n.as. 28 Something quite new happened, and it became the starting point of a process that continued for a thousand years of Telugu literary production. Technically, too, there is the pattern of interspersing verse, in varying meters, and rhythmic prose (the campu ¯ style that became norma-\n\n28. It appears that a similar or parallel process was also taking place in Kannada poetry roughly during this same period (in Pampa, for example).\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 11\n\nintroduction\n\n11\n\ntive). At the same time, there is a unique quality that is wholly Nannaya’s and could never even be imitated by his successors: a gentleness in tone and a freshness in depiction of characters who are domesticated, but only to a certain point. His Sanskrit kings remain digniﬁed and slightly remote, though they are also brought closer to the familiar range of experience of an Andhra listener. The vehemence and wildness of the Sanskrit Maha¯bha¯rata are softened and partly tamed, even as the inner world of the characters becomes more familiar. In this sense, as in the stylistic domain discussed earlier, the existence of the Sanskrit prototype becomes a relatively abstract presence that hardly impinges upon the dynamic world of the Telugu text. Only the modern misapplication of the notion of “translation” to Telugu literary creation could see Nannaya—and a host of other Telugu poets—as primarily “translators.” Nannaya’s adapation of the campu¯ style also implies a particularly active, participatory role for the listener. The itiha¯sa epic frame normally requires the presence of a speaker and a listener; for example, San ˜ jaya speaks to Dhr.tara¯s.t.ra within the story, describing the battle to his blind master, but his words are reported by the Su¯ta-narrator to the “original” listener, S´aunaka, and other sages. The Su¯ta, however, is merely repeating what Vais´ampa¯yana recited, on the basis of his teacher Vya¯sa’s composition, to King Janamejaya at the time of the latter’s sacriﬁce of snakes. These concentric frames are reframed by Nannaya, who sings the same story to his patron, Ra¯jara¯janarendra. And we, listening to a paura¯n.ika reciter, ﬁnd ourselves in precisely the same dialogic situation. The innovation lies in the assimilation of this format to what is, in effect, a ka¯vya: an aesthetic, self-conscious literary work. Sanskrit literary ka¯vya, for whatever reason, does not share this need to internalize the listener. Part of the great power of Nannaya’s campu ¯ lies precisely in this activation and co-option of the listener—a characteristic feature of the oral storytelling mode—within a reinvented literary genre. In general, Nannaya’s manner of narration skillfully combines an economy of words with a perfect choice of phrases that embody the emotional progression in events.29 The story often unfolds with great rapidity that unexpectedly allows room for reﬂection on the depth of feeling: this is the “lively narrative with inner purpose” of which the poet himself speaks. Sometimes a single verse encompasses a carefully articulated transition in state or a progression in emotion. For example, King Yaya¯ti, riding through the forest, hears a young woman—Devaya¯ni— calling for help from the dry well into which she has been pushed by her rival. The king dutifully extends his hand to help her out: 29. Perhaps the ﬁrst to articulate this feature of Nannaya’s poetry analytically and persuasively was Visvanatha Satyanarayana in his Nannayag¯ari prasanna-katha¯-kalitaˆrtha-yukti, 4th ed. (Vijayavada: Visvanatha Satyanarayana, 1970).\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 12\n\n12\n\nintroduction jaladhi-vilola-vı¯ci-vilasat-kala-ka¯n˜ci-saman˜citaˆvanı¯tala-vahana-ks.amamb´aina daks.in.a-hastamunan tad-unnamad¯ ti nu¯ti-lo gal.ad-uru-gharma-va¯ri-kan.a-kamra-karaˆbjamu vat .. ve˘luvad.a komalin divice˘ vis´ruta-kı¯rti yaya¯ti prı¯titon (3.1.141) With his right hand, that was equal to the weight of the whole world circled by shimmering waves of many oceans, he grasped hers, held out to him, as beﬁts a proper king. Drops of sweat were trickling down her delicate skin, as he helped her from the well, with love.\n\nFirst, there is the hand itself—strong enough to bear the earth with its surrounding oceans, all part of a single strong compound. On the other end, another hand, raised, ready to be grasped, wet with the delicate drops of her perspiration that make it even more beautiful, kamra. Everything lies in the readiness that reﬂects an intention: Devaya¯ni wants to marry this king. But Yaya¯ti as yet knows nothing of this, and feels nothing; he pulls her out, divice˘, with a neutral, simple verb, utterly without feeling. Why does he do this? Because he is vı´sruta-kı¯rti, a man of good name; he is doing his duty— all part of a day’s work. And then, suddenly, unexpectedly, in the very last word of the verse, there is feeling: prı¯titon, “with love.” Before he realizes it himself, he is lost, taken with her beauty, and not only the beauty of her outstretched arm, which he has held and pulled, but also that of her whole body, since Devaya¯ni was pushed naked into the well. We are not, however, told this explicitly; it is implicit in the earlier part of the story, which the listener certainly knows. A lesser narrator might have elaborated the point, but Nannaya is content to suggest it, or to remind his audience of it, with a single word that closes the verse by revealing the shift in the king’s perception. It is one thing to show an object, another to reveal this object through the feelings of a participant or onlooker within the story. There is yet another aspect to Nannaya’s originality, at the very limit of linguistic expression. Perhaps more than any later Telugu poet, with the possible exception of S´rı¯na¯tha in his Bhı¯mes´vara-pura¯n.amu, Nannaya produces a “magical” or “mantric” effect. At certain points—for example, in the hymn to the snakes in the Udan˙ka section translated below—he exceeds the bounds of poetry, or of reference. bahu-vana-pa¯dapaˆbdhi-kula-parvata-pu¯rn.a-saras-sarij-jharı¯sahita-maha¯-mahı¯-bharam´ajasra sahasra-phan.aˆ.li da¯lci dussahatara-mu¯rtikin jaladhi-s´a¯yiki pa¯yaka s´ayyayainan ayyahi-pati dus.kr.taˆntakud.´anantud.¯u ma¯ku prasannud.´ayye˘dun\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 13\n\nintroduction\n\n13\n\nSustaining always on his thousand hoods the dense burden of the earth, the forests and oceans and rooted mountains and rushing rivers and lakes, the Snake called Inﬁnite softly bears the unbearable body of the god who sleeps on water. Won’t he make an end to whatever was badly done, and be kind to me?\n\nOne long Sanskrit compound gives us the whole massiveness and heaviness of earth, indicated both by the long string of elements (forests, oceans, mountains, rivers, and lakes) and by the repeated ha sounds—also built into the rhyme scheme in the second syllable of each line—as if to demonstrate the breathlessness of the great snake who bears this burden on his thousand heads. But this dense alliteration has only begun: it is resumed by a dangling, unusual adverb: ajasra, “always,” another Sanskrit loan that would normally require a Telugu case-ending but which here simply ﬂows into the line, rhyming with the following word, sahasra (“thousand”). The dangling adverb, in the rush of alliterating sound, suggests the uninterrupted process of bearing the earth’s burden. Now, at last, there is a small piece of Dravidian, the nonﬁnite verb da¯lci, “bearing.” The work is thus still incomplete; another ¯ dis´es.a, along with bearing the earth, burden must still be borne. The snake A is also the bed on which the god Vis.n.u sleeps in the ocean of milk, and the poet makes sure that we feel this additional, indeed inﬁnite, weight of the god by another gush of sibilants and aspirates, spilling over the line-break: duS-SaHatara-mu¯rtikin jalaDHi-S´a¯yiki pa¯yaka S´ayyayaina ay-yaHi-pati. . . . These two burdens, incidentally, are never seen together in iconography or joined in story; Nannaya has fused them, doubling the snake’s dreadful task and arousing our admiration for him. The listener, by now bent double himself under this weight, miraculously made present through the language, needs to rest. For the god, at least, a soft bed is available: the repeated cushioning of the soft double semivowels, -yy(a)-, a delicately iconic reproduction of the texture of the snake’s body. And this entire description is part of an appeal to the snakes on the part of the young Udan˙ka who, as is customary, preludes his request with ﬂattery or praise. This verbal production of overpowering sounds has the effect of making palpable and present the snake’s own experience; what is more, the verse also controls the reality it has created, like a snake-charming mantra. Indeed, Nannaya’s verses in this passage are believed to serve this very purpose of providing protection from snakes. Here, as one sometimes ﬁnds in Nannaya, it is the sound that matters most, more even than any translatable meaning. The sounds, even beneath the words, create a world of their own. Perhaps all language oscillates between the poles of denotative reference and existential creativity; Nannaya\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 14\n\n14\n\nintroduction\n\nis often closer to the latter pole. He tells us, not boastfully, that he always speaks truth (nitya-satya-vacanun, 1.9 below), suggesting a self-discipline that fashioned a purity of tongue. This “true” relation to language enables him, in effect, to transcend language. TIKKANA: BOUNDARIES OF THE OR AL\n\nNannaya belongs to the Delta, and the north, and to a transient moment in the history of the Eastern Cha¯l.ukya state. He was also, like the great majority of Telugu poets throughout the centuries, a Brahmin. Literary historians have tended to class him as a court poet and his poetry as an elitist, courtly production. These terms may, however, be inadequate descriptions of the poet’s reality. One hesitates to ascribe or to attempt to explain anything of Nannaya’s power and stature by reference to the weak, short-lived political system within which he found a place. As was so often the case in Telugu literary history, this poet dwarfed by far his supposed patron. Indeed, in a deeper sense, the poet may be said to have created his patron and to have invested him with fame. Moreover, it is the poet who supplied the ideological or conceptual frame within which the state functioned. This is, in fact, one of the historic roles of major Telugu poets. Nannaya’s immediate successor, Tikkana, came from much farther south, in Ne˘llu¯ru, and from a smaller political system, that of Manumasiddhi, loosely connected to the powerful Ka¯katı¯ya state (thirteenth century). Tikkana was minister to this king, and later traditions credited him with active roles in politics and war.30 The localization of Maha¯bha¯rata themes and contents in an Andhra cultural frame achieved a new impetus in Tikkana’s poetry. And if Nannaya invented Telugu poetry, as the tradition correctly insists, it is Tikkana who imagined this tradition into self-conscious existence, making Nannaya, retrospectively, the ﬁrst poet. “First” implies that others follow, and Tikkana is ﬁrst among these, even in his own eyes. But the Telugu world that he imagined also has expanded to include new domains: dharmas´a¯stra texts, foundational texts of grammar, and the story (katha¯ ) tradition, seen as ka¯vya, for example. Tikkana’s disciple Ketana was responsible for early works in these genres. Under his master’s sponsorship, Ketana produced the Vijn˜a¯nes´varı¯yamu, a legal commentary, as well as the Telugu ¯ ndhra-bha¯s.a¯-bhu¯s.an.amu, Das´a-kuma¯ra-caritramu, after Dan.d.in, and the A probably the earliest Telugu grammar.31 Law, grammar, poetry, and “history” 30. See the stories about him recorded in Siddhes´vara-caritramu of Ka¯se˘ Sarvappa (sixteenth century). ¯ ndhra-s´abda-cinta¯man.i are in all like31. The su¯tras ascribed to Nannaya under the name A lihood of a later period, perhaps crystallizing only in the seventeenth century together with the myth of the origins of grammar.\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 15\n\nintroduction\n\n15\n\n(itiha¯sa)—all these exist in Tikkana’s semantic universe. It was, in a way, a distinct universe, entirely conceived and ﬂeshed out in Telugu by this poet, aptly known as kavi-brahma, the Poet-Creator. In stylistic terms, Tikkana’s own large corpus—fifteen parvans of the epic —stands alone; no later poet was able to follow his example. Syntactically, his poetry embodies idiomatic, almost colloquial, Dravidian patterns. At the same time, long Sanskrit compounds serve him whenever there is an architectural need for elevated emphasis: durva¯rodyama-ba¯hu-vikrama-rasaˆstoka-prata¯pa-sphuradgarvaˆndha-prativı¯ra-nirmathana-vidya¯-pa¯ragul mat-patul. . . . [Draupadi to her tormentor Kı¯caka:] Invincible, valiant, virile, exquisitely equipped to destroy any enemy blinded by pride are my husbands, all ﬁve of them . . .\n\nTranslation fails to reproduce the effect of what is a single compound entirely in somewhat arcane Sanskrit—a kind of drawn-out explosion of language intensiﬁed by the resort to a borrowed register, where the Sanskrit phonemes, with their conjunct consonants, aspirates, and harsh plosives, carry the expressive urgency. Draupadi is threatening Kı¯caka, and the threat comes across precisely because of this borrowed but internalized phonotactic feature. Dravidian clusters tend to be softer, voiced, and much shorter; Sanskrit allows a buildup of dense linguistic pressure. But the real expressivity of a verse like this depends on the combination of these two levels: the relentlessly intensifying, semantically compacted Sanskrit compound striving breathlessly toward a pause, and the framing and containing Dravidian syntax, which tends to break into discrete, short units: gı¯rva¯n.aˆkr.tul´evur´ipd.u ninu dorlı¯lan ve˘san git.t.i gandharvul ma¯namun pra¯n.amun konut.a tathyamb´˘mme e ˘yin kı¯caka¯ gandharvas with the bodies of gods. Listen, Kı¯caka: they will easily ruin your name and kill you. Depend on that.\n\nThe verse that began with a single long compound that perfectly represents the fearsome internal qualities of the heroes devolves in its second half into a string of singular, largely indexical, staccato movements: “the ﬁve of them—right now—you— easily—getting angry—will get you—your honor—your life—no doubt—somehow or other.” There is no place inside this verse for Kı¯caka to hide: the gandharva husbands will hunt him to the ends of the earth, as if they had marked him with their pointing ﬁnger,\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 16\n\n16\n\nintroduction\n\nrepresented by the ﬁnger of the speaker, Draupadi, almost visibly waving at Kı¯caka as she utters this warning. Restated in terms of breathing—a central factor in any recitation of the verse, no less so than in the case of, let us say, a ﬂutist—the ﬁrst two lines require a single long breath, held almost beyond endurance, setting up a tension within the mind of the listener. After the compound ends and the reciter can breathe again, the poet forces him into a series of hammerlike short bursts of language, none of them allowing him to stop for a full breath until the long vowel at the end, in the vocative kı¯cakaaa—the moment of exhaustion. It is as if Draupadi had started out, fully in control, with a violent phonetic attack upon her enemy that ﬁnally renders him breathless, knocked out by the punctuating series of indexical blows. Effects such as these are standard in Tikkana. The listener maintains a necessary syntactic presence, within the verse, more than an imagined narrative presence. In this respect Tikkana remains close to an oral, conversational mode, as if speaking to a listener in front of him. His text speaks rather than sings—he is thus less lyrical and more expressive than Nannaya —and the audible dimension is never lost. These are not verses written on palm leaves, printed on pages, read silently in libraries. They exist in the living space between the poet and his listener, who hears and feels every syllable in the body. By the same token, Tikkana begins a narrative style in which the speaker within the text is entirely identiﬁed with the character. It is Draupadi who speaks the above verse, not the poet. She speaks in accordance with welldeﬁned, individualized, subjective patterns that are wholly hers, and no one else’s. This is not to say that the poet is absent; his style still overrides, or colors, the speech of his characters. However, within the frame of Tikkana’s poetic language, one can hear distinct voices. This individualized “voicing” marks a quantum leap in Telugu poetry (sometimes described, rather lamely, by modern critics as Tikkana’s nat.akı¯yata, “dramatic quality”). Strikingly, however, this feature seems to stop with Tikkana. For the same reason, Tikkana’s verse does not ﬂow with the same ease as Nannaya’s, or as purely oral poetry, which must have been dominant in his time. It is not easy to read a Tikkana verse; the syntactical breaks tend to be unpredictable—as in living speech—retarding the movement of the meter, stopping and starting afresh, laden with indexicality. This is poetry at the very edge of everyday language, with all its freshness, individuality, and continual surprise. Listen, for example, to Sudes.n.a, Draupadi’s mistress, as she urges Draupadi, against her will, to go to Kı¯caka’s house to fetch some liquor: akkat.ay enu ved.kapad.iy a¯ne˘d.un a¯savam´ arthin teraga¯n ˘okka nikr.s.tan pan˜cut.akun opaka ce˘ppina dı¯nin ¯ıvu gos´˘kkaga e cesi ninnun atihı¯na-vidha¯na-niyukta cetaga¯ ¯ sakhı¯ nikkamay¯ ummalin˜cit´idi ne˘yyamu tiyyamu kalmiye\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 17\n\nintroduction\n\n17\n\nBut I wanted it so badly—my very favorite drink. I didn’t want to send some lowly servant. But you are making a big issue of it, as if I had asked something improper. You’re all in agony. Is this how a friend helps a friend?\n\nSudes.n.a starts, breaks, starts again, breaks off, resumes; literally, the verse looks something like this: “I wanted it. Badly. My favorite drink. Didn’t want to send a lowly servant. Asked you. You’re making a fuss. As if it’s something improper. You’re upset. Really. Is this good friendship, my friend?” One long sentence, built around a series of nonﬁnites, inﬁnitives, and conditionals that break it into a choppy sequence of part-utterances. The sequence culminates in a ﬁnal appeal, a rhetorical question, which nicely masks the speaker’s true intention. Not by chance, perhaps, the fourth line begins, at the point of greatest poetic tension, with the adverb nikkama: “truly.” This is followed by the one ﬁnite verb, ummalin˜citi(vi), “you’re upset,” an example of the kind of Dravidian root that is common in Tikkana but that later gradually fell into disuse. The feeling of the verse as a whole is one of actual conversation, with a hidden subtext, in a natural syntax that continually frustrates the ﬂow of the utpala-ma¯la meter. Perhaps it is this recurring frustration in the internal movement of the verse that produced a revolutionary problem and that encapsulates the tension between Tikkana’s innovative power and the ingrained habits of recitation. Someone trained to recite, for example, utpala-ma¯la verses in the oral style comes up against tremendous obstacles when he comes to Tikkana. Oral versiﬁcation requires dha¯ra—the unimpeded ﬂow of words —and dhoran.i, the “mode” in which the ﬂow takes place. Shifting to another meter brings the expectation of another mode, but a similar ﬂow. But in Tikkana neither happens. The reciter begins, stops, tries again, is again checked—very much like in ordinary speech, but utterly unlike the normal sung stanza. The combination of speech and meter, which is required if the poem is to speak, explains this difﬁculty, apparently keenly felt by the singers. It may also explain Tikkana’s isolation within the tradition; his style was never taken up or imitated by later poets. Indeed, the tradition itself recognized and commented upon this feature. Tikkana is said to have made a pact with his scribe, Guruna¯tha, from the potters’ caste, to the effect that Guruna¯tha would record, without pausing, the poems Tikkana was improvising on condition that the poet never stop the ﬂow of verse. If Guruna¯tha were to fail to keep his side of the pact, he would cut off his right hand; if Tikkana failed, he would cut off his tongue. The arrangement worked well until, at a point in the text where the internal narrator San ˜ jaya was describing the epic battle to Dhr.tara¯s.t.ra, Tikkana became stuck in the middle of a verse, unable to complete it. In despair, he\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 18\n\n18\n\nintroduction\n\ncried out to his scribe: “emi se˘ppudun guruna¯tha¯” (“what can I say, Guruna¯tha?”). The scribe kept writing without pause, as usual, and the poem worked, since the poet’s cry completed the verse, precisely according to the meter and meaning. The nasal ending of the verb, se˘ppudun, requires that kuruna¯tha —“lord of the Kurus,” that is, Dhr.tara¯s.t.ra—become guruna¯tha in written Telugu. Tikkana was reaching for his sword to cut off his tongue when the scribe explained to him that all was well with the verse, because of this simple rule. This story, disarmingly simple in appearance, actually offers powerful expression to the peculiar boundary zone that Tikkana inhabits in Telugu poetry. It seeks, on the one hand, to rehabilitate him, turning him back into an oral poet, since at this period, real poetry is still perceived as inhering in the oral, ﬂowing qualities of a verse. Oral poetics remained dominant, and “literariness”—with its concomitant freedom—was still not poetically acceptable. A literary poem, in this sense, had to conform to the dominant poetics. On the other hand, the story implies a recognition of the innovation that Tikkana had introduced into the tradition. The ambivalence is striking: the story attempts to mitigate the full force of this innovation by assimilating the poet to the older model. Tikkana, in the story, unconsciously fulﬁlls this role, though his completion of the verse is really a cry of despair, at the moment before he will strike himself speechless, cutting off his own tongue. It is as if more deeply, unconsciously, the poet remains a singer. Guruna¯tha’s origin from the potters reinforces this claim, since the potters, a “left-hand” caste, are closely linked to the singing of texts. The story also shows us the new value attached to writing down a text, ﬁxing it graphically without relinquishing the still-valued singing mode (which depends on audible utterance). In fact, the verse “works” only when sung: in writing, kuruna¯tha becomes guruna¯tha, the cry of despair to the scribe; in recitation, this remains kuruna¯tha, an address to the Kuru lord. One can see, in this vignette, the whole burden of the transition that Tikkana articulates for this tradition. This transition has further features related to the wider literary world of Tikkana’s time. Tikkana refers to himself in the colophons to his work as ubhaya-kavi-mitra, “a friend to both [kinds of] poets.” This somewhat enigmatic phrase has several possible meanings, and implies tension between two schools of poets. It could be a question of Sanskrit in relation to Telugu; or of S´aivas in relation to non-S´aivas; or Brahmins versus non-Brahmins (this categorization, however, is probably a back-formation that we tend to read into the early medieval period); or of oral/folk poetics in relation to the written and scholarly/literary genres, newly emerging from Nannaya’s time. We have seen the originality that Tikkana brought to the reconﬁguration of Sanskrit and Telugu, and we have noted the particular prominence Dravidian syntactic, especially idiomatic, patterns have for him. But there is a sense in which Tikkana clearly faced a coherent, contemporaneous counter-\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 19\n\nintroduction\n\n19\n\ntradition—that of the Vı¯ras´aiva poets, such as Pa¯lkuriki Somana¯tha, who made the non-Sanskritic dvipada meter their main expressive vehicle. In Somana¯tha’s words, the opposition between Sanskrit and Telugu, or between the “high” campu ¯ style and the purely Telugu-based dvipada, is starkly articulated. Somana¯tha, in line with the iconoclastic and anti-Brahmin thrust of Vı¯ras´aiva religion generally, pits himself consciously against Nannaya’s literary style and the tradition that emerged from it: Since beautiful, idiomatic Telugu is more commonly understood than heavy compositions of mixed prose and verse, I have chosen to compose this [work] entirely in the dvipada meter. Let it not be said that these words are nothing but Telugu. Rather look at them as equal to the Vedas. If you wonder how that can be, remember, “If a tu¯mu is a [large] standard for measure, so is a so˘la.” Is it not generally agreed that the stature of a poet derives from his ability to compose great poetry in simple language?” 32\n\nDvipada, in the hands of Somana¯tha, offered tremendous promise, given its enormous range of syntactic variation and the hypnotic power of the chanted string of couplets. Lesser poets, however, were unable to equal Somana¯tha’s virtuoso handling of the restricted couplet form (and even Somana¯tha himself, in his Pan.d.itaˆra¯dhya caritra, fails to maintain the emotional subtleties and syntactic fascination evident in his Basava-pura¯n.a). But dvipada tends, in any case, to limit the active role of the listener (and we insist again that at this period poetry was always read aloud to a group of listeners). Campu¯, with its mixture of verse and prose and its dependence upon the elaboration of the single stanza, always allows space for breaks in recitation, for commentary and reﬂection. In this sense, campu¯, as a ﬁnal product in performance, always has two authors: the poet who produced the text and the reciter who sings it, explicates it, and opens it up to new experience. In effect, the reciter re-creates the text continually. Dvipada, despite its powerful narrative capabilities, tends to monotones and lulls the listener into passivity. This is a structural feature of the genre, incapable of resolution even by a brilliant poet; it helps to explain the eventual marginalization of the dvipada mode, as opposed to the almost inﬁnite exfoliation of the campu¯ style. Nonetheless, dvipada maintained a presence in the ongoing evolution of the tradition, at least through the seventeenth century.33 In the fourteenth century, Gona Buddha¯re˘d.d.i composed a dvipada Ra¯ma¯yan.a (the so-called 32. Pa¯lkuriki Somana¯tha, Basava-pura¯n.amu, ed. Nidudavolu Venkata Ravu (Madras: Andhra Granthamala, 1952) 1 (p. 4); see discussion in V. Narayana Rao, S´iva’s Warriors: The Basava Pura¯n.a of Pa¯lkuriki Somana¯tha (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990), 5– 6. 33. In the courts of the Na¯yaka kings, dvipada received, for the ﬁrst time, consistent royal attention and patronage (like other popular forms); Raghuna¯thana¯yaka himself composed dvipada texts.\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 20\n\n20\n\nintroduction\n\nRan˙gana¯tha Ra¯ma¯yan.a), moving the style into a Vais.n.ava realm. Tension remained between this style and the more courtly forms of campu ¯ and, later, ka¯vya, a tension which reﬂects structural fault lines within the Telugu literary world. At the same time, the campu¯ style, at least in the hands of Tikkana, clearly absorbed creative elements and linguistic features from the countertradition, especially from Somana¯tha. In this sense, Tikkana’s innovation includes the mediation between these two worlds of Telugu poetry, as his self-given epithet, ubhaya-kavi-mitra, indicates. Tikkana faced this cultural challenge directly, attempting a synthesis of the conﬂicting pulls. Populist and elitist strands— or, if one prefers, regional and pan-Indian/Sanskritic— come together in his poetry, which stylistically and thematically forged a new sensibility. The same move toward synthesis is apparent in his choice of deity, Hari-Hara, a composite form of Vis.n.u and S´iva whom he addresses in his invocations. It is also important to realize the more generalized direction of aesthetic transformation that Tikkana brought to his reworking of the Maha¯bha¯rata text. The stylistic and syntactical features we have outlined are perfectly in line with this wider shift, which turns the Sanskrit epic into a Telugu family drama of local south Indian chiefs. Emotions are “Teluguized,” situated in wholly familiar frames and integrated with a Telugu psychology. When the young hero Abhimanyu is cruelly killed in battle, the response that Tikkana produces from his audience—through the voices of Dhr.trara¯s.t.ra or Yudhis.th.ira and others—is something like, “How could you do this to my grandson (or nephew)?” Here is Dhr.tara¯s.t.ra after he hears of Abhimanyu’s death: cittamu vo˘kke˘d.um purus.a-simhuni pautra-kula¯gragan.yun a¯ . un oppe˘d.u ¯me˘ttani meniva¯nin ˘et.tyuttama-teju bhu¯ri-gun l´uttala pe˘t.t.iro paluvur´ugra-manaskulu gu¯d.iy akkat.a¯y atte˘rag´˘lla e tet.a-pad.unat.t.uluga¯ vivarin˜ci ce˘ppuma¯ 34 My mind blisters in pain.

Who would do such a thing except someone as bad as me?\n\nIf we compare Tikkana’s articulation of this moment with that of the Sanskrit original, we immediately notice a striking difference in tone, despite the very close verbal correspondence between the two texts. In Sanskrit, Yudhis.th.ira says: What can I say to Arjuna, or to Subhadra¯?. . . I have wronged Subhadra¯, Kr.s.n.a, and Arjuna, in my self-absorption and my lust for victory. A greedy person has no understanding of his faults. He acts out of confusion and hunger. I wanted the honey, and I failed to foresee this fall. We should have offered him food, or money, or ﬁne clothes and ornaments. Instead, we offered up this boy in battle.36\n\n35. Ibid., 7.2.140 – 42. 36.

Victory no longer gives me pleasure, or ruling a kingdom, or being immortal, living in the same world with the gods, now that I have seen this magniﬁcent boy, full of courage, cut down.38\n\nYudhis.th.ira, whether speaking Sanskrit or Telugu, has deﬁnite tendencies toward self-reproach, guilt, doubt, and disgust with his public persona and role. This is a given. But listen to how differently he tells us this in the two languages. In Telugu, the ﬁrst-person pronoun and ﬁrst-person verbal forms dominate the utterance: “I should have known; I am the one who sent him; I could have done otherwise; I was greedy; what can I say”—and, ﬁnally, “I am bad.” Everything is personal, immediate, and fully internalized, and grief speaks directly along with guilt. Moreover, Yudhis.th.ira takes responsibility here for the rest of the family. It is a family tragedy, focused on a Deccan patriarch-hero, that is being displayed, before it becomes the story of a warrior’s death. The quality of emotion is closer to home. In some sense, these emotions are also embedded in the Sanskrit prototype, and to that extent we can say that Tikkana is extremely faithful to the original. But the Sanskrit Yudhis.th.ira wavers, loses focus, and slips into abstract gnomic statements: “A greedy person has no understanding of his faults” (in contrast to Tikkana’s “It was greed that blinded me to my faults”). Before this thought is complete, he is already elsewhere, anticipating Arjuna’s furious revenge (and, as the Sanskrit text continues, the pragmatic usefulness of Arjuna’s rage in the ongoing war). We lose, as he himself does, the full integrity of his grief, and are left with his confusion. Then, concluding the lament, comes Yudhis.th.ira’s usual inner move (missing from Tikkana’s passage): he is sick of it all, indifferent to victory, and reluctant to rule; none of it has meaning for him any more. In short, he wants to renounce the world. The personal tragedy is already, all-too-easily, precipitated into an almost generalized cultural predicament. What this implies, among other things, is that Tikkana’s characters achieve a deliberately intended coherence in speech, in the way their actions and movements are described, and in their entire presence within the Telugu text. This is a function of a well-constructed written text, and is dis-\n\n37. Sad-as´va iva samba¯dhe vis.ame. 38. Maha¯bha¯rata (Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1933–59), 7.48.12–13, 15–19, 26. [Sanskrit.]\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 23\n\nintroduction\n\n23\n\ntinct from the reader’s usual experience of the major ﬁgures in the Sanskrit epic. Their shifting focus is a natural result of their position within an originally oral text, which we have in its recorded redaction. To state this point a little differently: the full dimensions of the characters within the Sanskrit epic depend partly upon the text as we have it, and partly upon the oral milieu outside it that supplemented the verses. That oral dimension is now lost when we come to the Sanskrit Maha¯bha¯rata, and the written text is venerated. In contrast, Tikkana offers a fully articulated, nuanced world, in which there is room for the characters to be, or to become, fully themselves. They can also cumulate internal experience and grow. For a Telugu audience, there is something irreversible in Tikkana’s reworking of the epic. While Tikkana adheres closely to the verbal text of the Sanskrit Maha¯bha¯rata, he has in effect re-created the text in a Telugu mode, alive with Telugu-speaking heroes. Once one has seen the Maha¯bha¯rata through Tikkana’s lens, which emphasizes and selects elements of the original, it is almost impossible not to experience these elements even in Sanskrit—as when a hitherto unnoticed pattern is pointed out in a design and then can no longer be ignored. A good “translation,” in this perspective, creates a new original. This is not a matter of adapting, imitating, or following. The new original preexists in the “old” original, before the translation, but it needs the translator to reveal it. (Put backward, this means that the original anticipates its own translations—perhaps an inexhaustible series—and depends on these translations for its own total expression.) This also explains why “translation,” understood in this manner, can be the beginning of an entirely new literary culture. To sum up to this point: Tikkana reveals an activist, imaginative drive toward fashioning the universe of Telugu literature and culture. This universe expanded under his tutelage to incorporate new levels and genres, including not only dharmas´a¯stra, grammar, ka¯vya, and itiha¯sa, but also the restless, antinomian S´aiva world couched in a highly regional idiom. This incorporation of wider elements actually meant the co-option of more specific modes into what now became the mainstream of Telugu poetry, directly evolving out of Nannaya’s original template. From this point onward, the distinctive, volatile, and creative fusion of elements inherent in the literary campu¯ institutionalized itself as the expressive arena for most Telugu poets. At the same time, Tikkana’s expansion of this mode, along the lines we have discussed, prepared the ground for the extraordinary developments of the fourteenth century. ˘ COD. A POEMS AND ARROWS: NANNE\n\nBefore we turn to these developments, we may pause to consider the enigmatic ﬁgure of Nanne˘cod.a, of undetermined date, but perhaps belonging\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 24\n\n24\n\nintroduction\n\nto the interval between Nannaya and Tikkana. Nanne˘cod.a, unlike most Telugu poets, was a non-Brahmin—a king of the Telugu Cod.as ruling in Orayu¯ru, in Pa¯kana¯d.u (perhaps near Nellu¯ru).39 There is a sense in which he offers us a non-Brahmin, or Ks.atriya, poetics, distinct from both Nannaya and Tikkana on the one hand, and from the other non-Brahminic, dvipada poets such as Somana¯tha on the other. Nanne˘cod.a explicitly identiﬁes the conceptual pair ma¯rga—“pan-Indian,” “supra-regional”—and des´i, “regional,” which later served to express the kind of hierarchy of styles operative within Telugu (along the lines discussed above). But for Nanne˘cod.a, ma¯rga means, simply, Sanskrit; for him, all Telugu was des´i. Earlier, there was poetry in Sanskrit, called ma¯rga. The Cha¯l.ukya kings and many others caused poetry to be born in Telugu and ﬁxed it in place, as des´i, in the Andhra land. (1.23)\n\nGiven this deﬁnition, we nonetheless hear Nanne˘cod.a demanding a radical Teluguization of both modes in the poetry he regards as best (vastu-kavita): When ideas come together smoothly in good Tenugu without any slack, and description achieves a style, and there are layers of meaning, and the syllables are soft and alive with sweetness, and the words sing to the ear and gently delight the mind, and what is ﬁnest brings joy, and certain ﬂashes dazzle the eye while the poem glows like moonlight, and the images are the very image of perfection, and there is a brilliant ﬂow of ﬂavor, and both ma¯rga and des´i become the native idiom, and ﬁgures truly transﬁgure, so that people of taste love to listen and are enriched by the fullness of meaning— that is how poetry works, when crafted by all real poets. (1.35)\n\nThis statement—and the long poem on the birth of the god Kuma¯ra that it precedes—mark Nanne˘cod.a as effectively the ﬁrst ka¯vya-poet in Telugu. And yet he stands alone, a maverick whose textures and style were never followed. Telugu ka¯vya at its height emerges out of the poetic revolution propelled by S´rı¯na¯tha. Nanne˘cod.a seems to reﬂect a consciousness of a strictly regional or local poetics, which also produced full-ﬂedged theoretical state¯ ndhra-bha¯s.a¯-bhu¯s.an.amu (in the generation after ments such as Ketana’s A 39. Nanne˘cod.a, Kuma¯ra-sambhavamu (Madras: Vavilla Ramasvamisastrulu and Sons, 1972), 1.53–54, describing his lineage and region. This work was rediscovered and published in the early twentieth century by Manavalli Ramakrishnakavi.\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 25\n\nintroduction\n\n25\n\nTikkana) and Vinnakot.a Pe˘ddana’s Ka¯vyaˆlan˙ka¯ra-cu¯d.a¯man.i.40 Certain features of this regional poetics are intimated in Nanne˘cod.a’s aesthetic program: an elevated but deeply idiomatic style (perhaps referred to by his term ja¯nu te˘nun˙gu, also used by Pa¯lkuriki Somana¯tha); 41 a density and compression in poetic statement; a notion of conscious construction (ku¯rpu) that, while common to all the classical poets, is conjoined with a belief in the innate or natural (naisargika) propensity of the poet to internalize all forms of knowledge; and a sense of the overpowering, physical effect of a good poem: An arrow shot by an archer or a poem made by a poet should cut through your heart, jolting the head. If it doesn’t, it’s no arrow, it’s no poem.\n\nIt is also striking that Nanne˘cod.a introduces explicit attacks on unsuccessful poets (kukavi-ninda) who fail to meet the standards of this regional aesthetic, and also on bad critics. Elaborate images of what constitutes a good or bad poem are now present in the introduction to a ka¯vya-work: Good color, build, apparent softness: they’re all there in a poor image, but if you look inside it’s dead. That’s what a bad poet makes. Good color, build, softness, inside and out: you ﬁnd them in a living woman, and in good poems. If you look for good lines in a real poem, they’re everywhere, in dense profusion. That is poetry. But if one goes on chattering and, by chance, a few lines come out well, like a blind man stepping on a quail, would you call that a poem?\n\nSuch attacks on the poetic antagonists become standard features of the introductory portions to ka¯vya works, but each time the antagonist is deﬁned anew, in terms of the shifting and evolving poetic ideal. For Nanne˘cod.a, poetic failure is keyed to the image of what is possible in the best poem—a compacted profusion of expression, an organic quality of liveliness, inside 40. This same tradition continued down into the sixteenth century at Tirupati with the San˙kı¯rtana-laks.an.amu of Ta¯l.l.apa¯ka Cinna Tirumalaˆca¯rya. 41. Nanne˘cod.a, 1.35. This term, which has generated much discussion, remains rather unclear.\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 26\n\n26\n\nintroduction\n\nand out. The connoisseur immediately recognizes these features, while the critic of poor taste is seduced by cheap effects: Small minds cannot enjoy a good poem, full of ﬂavor. They run to cheap poetry, like ﬂies that pass by whole sugarcane and swarm around the chewed-up pulp. You can only learn about poetry from one who knows. There’s nothing to be gained from one who doesn’t. You need a touchstone, not limestone, to test gold.\n\nDespite this highly articulated vision, Nanne˘cod.a’s model remained outside the mainstream of the classical tradition for reasons still not understood.\n\n¯ THA: POETRY AND EMPIRE S´ RI¯NA\n\nBy the fourteenth century, then, we have a ripening tradition, already extraordinarily rich in forms and resonance, with a range of available modes. An enormous effort to produce narratives, mostly from the epic and pura¯n.as, permeates the literary scene. These narratives are all in campu ¯ style, imbued with a Sanskritic atmosphere and imparting dignity to both language ˘ rra¯pragad.a’s Nr.sim.hapura¯n.amu and theme. Ma¯rana’s Ma¯rkan.d.eyapura¯n.amu, E ¯ and Harivam.s´amu, and Na¯cana Somana¯tha’s ¯[Uttara]harivam . s´amu are but a few of the major works. This vogue in pura¯n.as, in the campu ¯ style, continued all the way to the twentieth century. But the last decades of the fourteenth century and the ﬁrst decades of the ﬁfteenth also witnessed a great breakthrough in the literary-cultural domain with the appearance of the revolutionary ﬁgure of S´rı¯na¯tha, arguably the most creative poet in the entire history of this literature. Once again, the poet was aware of his own innovation. S´rı¯na¯tha is the ﬁrst to attempt to produce in Telugu a version of Sanskrit ka¯vya, a task previously considered impossible or even taboo. Here is how S´rı¯na¯tha speaks of his achievement, with reference to the Sanskrit original of S´rı¯hars.a, the Nais.adhı¯ya-caritra: . . . bhat.t.a-hars.a-maha¯-kavı¯s´varun.d.u kavi-kulaˆdr.s.t.aˆdhva-pa¯nthun.d.´ ˘onarcina nais.adha-s´r.n˙ga¯ra-ka¯vya-prabandha-vis´es.ambunan as´es.a-manı¯s.i-hr.dayam.-gamambuga¯ s´abdam´ anusarin˜ciyun´ abhipra¯yambu gurin˜ciyu bha¯vamb´ upalaks.in˜ciyu rasambu pos.in˜ciyun´ alan˙ka¯rambu bhu¯s.in˜ciyun´ aucityamb´ a¯darin˜ciyun´ anaucityambu pariharin˜ciyu ma¯tr.kaˆnusa¯rambuna ceppa-bad.ina yı¯-bha¯s.a¯-nais.adhaka¯vyamb[u] . . . vilasillun a¯-candra-ta¯raˆrkambu.¯ The erotic poem made by the great poet Bhat.t.a Hars.a, who traveled paths unseen by other poets, is here rendered into Telugu in a way that makes use of the special features of the language, to touch the hearts of the wise—\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 27\n\nintroduction\n\n27\n\nfollowing the sound of the text, aiming at the poet’s intention (abhipra¯ya), keeping the poetic feeling (bha¯va) in view, supporting the mood (rasa), embellishing the ﬁgures of expression (alan˙ka¯ra), taking care of propriety (aucitya) and avoiding impropriety (anaucitya), closely obeying the original. This Telugu Nais.adhamu will last as long as the moons, the stars, the sun.42\n\nThis statement of translators’ protocol is unique to Telugu literature; it shows us an intense awareness of the new enterprise S´rı¯na¯tha has undertaken. For the ﬁrst time, a Sanskrit ka¯vya has been entirely transmuted into Telugu in a sustained and elevated style appropriate to the original text. What has S´rı¯na¯tha translated? He lists a series of separate components— sound, intention, feeling, mood, ﬁguration, and propriety—all of which add up to an attempt to reproduce the texture of the Sanskrit. Sound lies at the root of this attempt and generates the real problem, given the obviously divergent phonoaesthetics of the two languages. Here is where the poet’s originality is truly tested. Often in this text, the Nais.adhamu, S´rı¯na¯tha appears to reproduce the phraseology of his model, sometimes to the point of lifting, verbatim, most of a verse. For this very reason, the tradition mocks him: when S´rı¯na¯tha showed his translation to Sanskrit pandits, they laughed at him and said, “Take your Telugu case-endings—d.u, mu, vu, and lu—and give our Sanskrit text back to us.” Even more trenchant an expression of this same view lies in the story that S´rı¯na¯tha, upon ﬁnishing his poem, sought the approval of a young poetic genius called Pillalamarri Pina Vı¯rabhadrud.u, whom S´rı¯na¯tha found playing in the street with his friends. The boy, called upon to judge S´rı¯na¯tha’s complex ka¯vya, asked the poet how he had handled one of S´rı¯hars.a’s arcane phrases: gami-karmı¯-kr.ta-naika-nı¯vr. ta¯ [literally, “having put into effect the verb ‘to go’ by wandering through many lands”]. S´rı¯na¯tha immediately recited his corresponding verse, with the “Telugu” phrase gami-karmı¯-kr.ta-naika-nı¯vr.tud.anai (that is, the Sanskrit original rendered verbatim, swallowed whole by the Telugu line with the sole addition of the Telugu ﬁrst-person and adverbial endings ud.an-ai). Here are the two verses, in an attempt at English translation; one should bear in mind that the Sanskrit original is deliberately opaque, erudite, and enigmatic, its diction elevated to a point of near-absurdity (which is, in a sense, the point) —while S´rı¯na¯tha’s Telugu rendition, although almost entirely couched in Sanskrit, has a happy grace and ease. The context is the ﬁrst meeting between Prince Nala and the famous captive goose, who has seen the lovely Damayantı¯ and wants to make Nala fall in love with her: sarası¯h. paris´¯ılitum . maya¯ gami-karmı¯-kr.ta-naika-nı¯vr.ta¯ atithitvam ana¯yi sa¯ dr.s´oh. sad-asat-sam.s´aya-gocarodarı¯ // 43 42.

That is how I entertained her in my vision for a moment, though I can’t be certain I saw her waist, which may, or then again may not, be there.\n\nLike all beautiful Hindu women, Damayantı¯ is so thin at the waist that one can legitimately wonder if her body has a middle part at all. The bird is evidently well-trained in grammar, as we see from the critical compound cited above, “recycled” by S´rı¯na¯tha in the ﬁrst of two verses based on the Sanskrit prototype: kamalendı¯vara-s.an.d.a-man.d.ita-lasat-ka¯sa¯ra-seva¯-ratin gami-karmı¯-kr.ta-naika-nı¯vr.tud.anai kan.t.in vidarbhambunan raman.in pallavapa¯ni padmanayanan ra¯kendubimba¯nanan ¯ ¯ ¯ sti-vicikitsa¯-hetu-s´a¯todarin 44 sama-pı¯na-stanin asti-na Since I delight in pools adorned with lotuses and lilies, I lay claim to the verb “to go,” having made “going” my vocation, peripatetically progressing from land to land. That’s how I saw her, in Vidarbha, a ravishing woman, her hands like vines, eyes like lotuses, her face— the moon in all its fullness, with two equally full breasts and a waist so tiny you might wonder if it is or isn’t truly there.\n\nObviously, S´rı¯na¯tha has completely “re-Sanskritized” the verse, which has only a single Dravidian root (the ﬁnite verb, kan.t.in, “I saw”); all the rest is a combination of elegant and playful invention (in the long composita) on the one hand, and a melliﬂuous cumulation of familiar metaphors and attributes (the conventional descriptions of Damayant¯i’s beauty) on the other. Within this ludic reshufﬂing of the given terms of the message, the refractory compound in question now stands out in all its ostentatious ob44. S´rı¯na¯tha, 2.21, correcting -pı¯ta to pı¯na.\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 29\n\nintroduction\n\n29\n\nscurity and in brilliant contrast to the clarity and predictability of the remaining assimilated Sanskrit forms. S´rı¯na¯tha has both internalized and reframed this phrase in a manner that exposes its peculiar grandiosity for what it is, a plaything for pandits situated somewhere very close to incipient irony. None of this, however, was apparently capable of impressing the young Vı¯rabhadrakavi, who is said to have remarked with scorn, on the basis of this example—like the Sanskrit pandits mentioned earlier—that S´rı¯na¯tha’s version of S´rı¯hars.a’s ka¯vya was limited to sprinkling in the occasional d.a or ai. 45 Reading through the Nais.adhamu, one can sometimes see why he (speaking for the literary tradition) adopts this sardonic view. As always, the folk-literary-critical narrative makes an incisive comment, although it fails, in this case, to illuminate the subtleties of S´rı¯na¯tha’s Sanskritizing techniques, often deeply transformative of tone despite the surface impression of wholesale, almost mechanical transposition of entire blocks of Sanskrit. If anything, the Telugu Nai.sadhamu seems to bear out a happy speculation by Seferis: My fancy sometimes reaches even this absurd limit: if all the poets of the world were permitted to use one word only—the same word—the good poets would still ﬁnd a way to differ from each other and create with this single word different personal poems (a thought that verges on Zen).46\n\nWe might also invoke the shade of Borges’s hero Pierre Menard, “the author of Don Quixote,” whose early twentieth-century version of Cervantes’ classic presents us with passages identical to the seventeenth-century original, but entirely different in tone and meaning in their new cultural and temporal context. “The text of Cervantes and that of Menard are verbally identical, but the second is almost inﬁnitely richer. (More ambiguous, his detractors will say; but ambiguity is a richness.)” 47 The story we have cited highlights both the radically innovative nature of S´rı¯na¯tha’s work and the tradition’s resistance to it. A given verse of S´rı¯na¯tha’s Nais.adhamu may look and sound remarkably like—indeed, almost identical to—S´rı¯hars.a’s original verse, but in fact it is always something quite new, and entirely Telugu. This is the true miracle of transubstantiation. However, the tradition also mocks this miracle. In effect, S´rı¯na¯tha has subverted the older distinction between ma¯rga (“high,” “Sanskritic”) and 45. Pandipeddi Chenchayya and M.

Until this moment, any Telugu work was by deﬁnition des´i. But from now on, the boundaries of ma¯rga and des´i are not linguistic but purely hierarchical: a ma¯rga work can exist within Telugu, in distinction from des´i-Telugu forms. It is this new claim to status that the story objects to, and that S´rı¯na¯tha boasts of when he describes himself as a¯ndhra-bha¯s.a-nais.adhaˆbja-bhavud.u, “the Creator-God of the Nais.adha text in Telugu.” But the actual achievement can be more precisely deﬁned. S´rı¯na¯tha’s claim is to have translated Sanskrit ka¯vya into Telugu ka¯vya. In fact, however, ka¯vya is not really a genre, but admits tremendous variation, and S´rı¯na¯tha works his own particular transformation on the Sanskrit model. Again, we need to look at a speciﬁc example. Here is S´rı¯hars.a’s description of the women of India in relation to the as-yet-unmarried Nala: s´riya¯sya yogyaˆham iti svam ¯ıks.itum kare tam a¯lokya suru¯paya¯ dhr.tah./ viha¯ya bhaimim apadarpaya¯ kaya¯ na darpanah. s´va¯sa-malı¯masah. kr.tah./ 48 “I’m a match for him, aren’t I?” A rush to the mirror. Despair. The image clouded by a sigh. So it goes, with one exception, for every woman in the world.\n\nThe Sanskrit is so densely compacted that the initial effort merely deciphers it, restoring some kind of linear syntax. S´rı¯na¯tha, however, narrativizes the verse, producing an expanded and well-deﬁned sequence of events leading up to the suggestion of Damayantı¯’s unique beauty: kori lı¯la¯-geha-kud.ya-bha¯gambula vrayudur´ammahı¯s´varuni mu¯rti vra¯si kanya¯tva-gauravamu vı¯sara -vova dars´intur´anura¯ga-taral.a-dr.s.t.i dars´in˜ciy atanik´e taguduno taganoy an˜c´ in˜cuk´in˜cuka sam.s´¯ayintur´a¯tma sam.s´ayin˜ci karaˆmbujamula krommincut.addamul´ ˘tti e cu¯turu tammu¯da¯ru ra¯jakanyalu jagatin a¯kramamun´andu kandu va¯rala nit.t.u¯rpu ga¯d.puvedi ¯ mukul .amulu ca¯ru-mohana-mu¯rtiy anaga paragu damayantı¯-ceti darpan.amu dakka (1.70)\n\n¯\n\n48.

Then they stare at it with longing—against the rules for a virgin. Staring, they start to wonder: “Am I good enough for him, or not?” Wondering, they grab the mirror to study themselves. All the princesses of the world go through these stages, and all the mirrors go blank, clouded by sighs of despair, except the one held by Damayantı¯, of surpassing beauty.\n\nIn the Sanskrit, the word order completely masks the narrative order: “Am I a match for him?”—to see themselves—in the hand—seeing him—by a beautiful woman—held— except for Damayantı¯— deﬂated—by which [such beautiful woman]—was the mirror—by a sigh—unclouded?” The reader struggles to reconstruct a more intelligible syntactic pattern, which would follow the natural sequence of events. It is this sequence that S´rı¯na¯tha has strung out and re-imagined. Moreover, each phase of the sequence is marked by a repetition, in nonﬁnite form, of the previous ﬁnite verb: “They stare. . . . staring.” This kind of repetition constitutes a ﬁgure in alan˙ka¯ra texts: mukta-pada-grasta, “picking up the earlier word.” 49 Not only does the ﬁgure serve to highlight the continuity and its recurrent, and universal, elements, it also sets off the uniqueness of the poem’s striking denouement, in which Damayantı¯ comes to constitute a set of one. Her, and her alone, the mirror does not disappoint. Even she, it seems, has run to check out her beauty, with the same doubt in her mind that afﬂicts all other women, but in her case, the doubt is ultimately dispelled. This is not merely a technical triumph, the ﬁnal decision in a beauty contest. What S´rı¯na¯tha has succeeded in suggesting is that there is something unique in Damayantı¯’s presence, a hint of subjectivity and entirely individual potentiality—almost as if she were herself emerging from the mirror.50 Of course, in a sense, the same conclusion is implicit in S´rı¯hars.a’s verse, though it appears so densely and intricately compressed and so deeply hidden by the nonlinear syntax that one can reach it only by a process of logical deduction. It is this logical progression that S´rı¯na¯tha turns into a lyrical statement, wholly unpacking the Sanskrit puzzle and ultimately projecting the image of a living, irreducily unique woman. Another way to state the difference is to notice how a near-total nominalization in the Sanskrit verse—a series of nouns and their modiﬁers—turns into a straightforward verbal series that completely dominates the Telugu poem. 49. The pattern is well-known already in Vedic texts; see S. Migron, “Catena and Climax in Vedic Prose,” Die Sprache 35 (1991–93), 71– 81. 50. We owe this observation to Don Handelman.\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 32\n\n32\n\nintroduction\n\nWhile this example may be slightly more vivid than usual in S´rı¯na¯tha’s reworking of the Nais.adhı¯ya text, it does illuminate the poetic mode that S´rı¯na¯tha has invented. It still tends more toward lyrical narrative than toward the deliberately nonlinear, timeless, self-reﬂecting expression of S´rı¯hars.a’s Sanskrit ka¯vya. We are still some way away from the full-ﬂedged, autonomous ka¯vya-world of the sixteenth-century Telugu poets—for whom, however, S´rı¯na¯tha has opened the way. Nais.adhamu is the earliest of S´rı¯na¯tha’s extant works. Already it contains many of the hallmarks of his mature style—a dimension of full-throated orality and musicality, where the words ﬂow with ease without losing their scholarly elevation; a gift for producing, perhaps even improvising, a long Sanskrit compound without scuttling the Telugu syntax; and above all, the alchemical power to do things with language that bring a reality into existence. In a sustained way, these features blended together to produce, elaborate, and establish an entire temple, that of Daks.aˆra¯ma in the Konas¯ima delta. S´rı¯na¯tha’s Bhı¯mes´vara-pura¯n.amu became the foundational text for this shrine, which it more or less sang into existence in its medieval (Hindu) form.51 Bhı¯mes´vara-pura¯n.amu is a symphony swelling slowly to a pitch of almost unimaginable presence, as the poet calls the god himself down into the shrine. This is a text which cannot be retold or paraphrased, only performed and re-performed, creating its own reality anew each time. It is, from a certain perspective, not unlike a Vedic text, pregnant with mantric power (in the sense of bringing a world into existence, not simply of controlling an already existing reality or coercing a presence). But these same qualities are abundantly evident in many of S´rı¯na¯tha’s individual stanzas, or even in single lines. He had his own way of stating this aesthetic, at the start of Bhı¯mes´varapura¯n.amu: hara-cu¯d.a¯-harin.a¯n˙ka-vakratayu ka¯la¯nta-sphurac-can.d.ika¯¯ ¯ı-paryanta-ka¯thinyamun parus.odga¯d.ha-payodhara-sphut.a-tat . . sarasatvambunu sambhavin˜ce˘n anaga¯ sat-ka¯vyamul dikkulan cira-ka¯lambu nat.in˜cucun.d.u kavi-ra¯jı¯-geha-ran˙gambulan A little crooked like the crescent moon on S´iva’s head, sharp as the contours of the ﬁrm, quickened breasts of the goddess roused to fury at the end of time,\n\n51. On the probable Buddhist prehistory of Daks.aˆra¯ma, see our forthcoming essay.\n\n01A-C2162-INT 9/19/02 1:32 PM Page 33\n\nintroduction\n\n33\n\nyet soft and delicious: good poetry is all of this together, dancing wherever poets live. (1.11)\n\nThree features produce poetry for S´rı¯na¯tha: a curved line that suggests the potential full (rounded) form; a ﬁrmness, almost toughness, replete with some destructive energy that is also somehow erotic and creative; and a ﬂuid, seductive softness. At the center of the series is the goddess, angry, intent upon putting an end to time, her breasts thrilling at this prospect— but, for S´rı¯na¯tha, they are still breasts, attractive, possibly nurturing, enticing, womanly. The compound that says all this takes up almost half of the verse, connecting to the ﬁrst two lines in a single syntagma crackling with sharp dentals and retroﬂexes: ka¯laˆnta-sphurac-can.d.ika¯-parus.odga¯d.ha-payodhara-sphuta-tat.¯ı-paryanta-ka¯t.hinyamun. Here everything is distinct, sharply outlined, yet still musical, with a suggestion of tactile softness. This is just how a good poem should work—at the edge of temporality, almost transcending time itself; destructive if misunderstood or misappropriated; and rewarding to a devoted listener. Everything depends upon the blend, as the verb sambhavin˜cu—a co-occurrence, a coming together—indicates. Or we might picture this as a process actually undergone in the course of listening to this, or any other, good verse: the articulated point at the end of time (ka¯laˆnta), where disjunction and discontinuity are present with other harsh boundaries, is superseded by the liquid internal state of softness (sarasatva) which is continuous, nonspeciﬁc, untimed (cira-ka¯lam)—an unbroken movement, a dance. The result is a new kind of poetry, a new, dynamic line, resonant with oral energy, breaking the bounds of earlier poetic forms. And what is true of the individual line is also true of this poet’s traditional biography, which sets up a new model for poetic identity. In fact, S´rı¯na¯tha is the ﬁrst Telugu poet to have a full-ﬂedged, orally elaborated biography, structured around oral verses attributed to him. These verses tell, for example, of his competition with the scholar-poet D.in.d.ima Bhat.t.u at Vijayanagara; the contest ends, of course, with S´rı¯na¯tha’s victory and the destruction of D.in.d.ima’s bronze drum. Similar stories take S´rı¯na¯tha to other courts and other kings. The poet moves throughout Andhra and even beyond its geographical range, from patron to patron, kingdom to kingdom, drawing together this spatial map into a virtual literary empire of which he, S´rı¯na¯tha, is t"
