Recently Microsoft has been very active in its support for, and use of, REST as a mechanism for implementing services. This event will cover recent and forthcoming technologies for building services with SOAP and REST, and we’ll explain REST for the uninitiated. Agenda: Session 1: The SOAP Story In this session we’ll do a lighting quick re-cap of what SOAP is, what specs surround it before looking at how far the SOAP programming model has come in Microsoft’s latest-and-greatest stack – Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) V3.5. We’ll talk about different approaches to building services and we’ll take a good look at the integration between WCF V3.5 and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) V3.5 which opens up a whole new way of implementing services. Session 2: Time for a REST Web applications have evolved; using technologies like AJAX and Silverlight they have rich client-side code that wants to consume services, but they prefer JSON, “plain xml” and REST. In this session we’ll introduce REST for the uninitiated, and we’ll demonstrate some of the new and forthcoming technology that Microsoft has for working with REST: WCF 3.5, Web3S, Windows Live Data, and Codename “Astoria”.

Because regular cybersecurity wasn't complicated...\n\nWelcome to Cyberbiosecurity. Because regular cybersecurity wasn't complicated...Snarky Security\n\nHow wonderful it is that in our modern age, every bit of our biological data can be digitized, stored, and potentially pilfered by cyber thieves! Isn't it just splendid to think that while scientists are busy pushing the boundaries of biotechnology, hackers could be plotting the next big bio-data heist? This delightful scenario is brought to you by the ever-expanding digital landscape of biology and biotechnology, where the integration of computer science, engineering, and data science transforms our understanding and manipulation of biological systems. While the fusion of technology and biology offers immense benefits, it also necessitates a careful consideration of the ethical, security, and associated social implications. But let's be honest, in the grand scheme of things, what's a little risk compared to potential scientific achievements? After all, progress in biotechnology waits for no one, and we're just along for the ride in this thrilling, slightly terrifying, adventure. So, as we continue to navigate this complex landscape, let's not forget the importance of robust data protection measures and collaborative international efforts to safeguard sensitive biological information. After all, what could possibly go wrong? ------------------------- This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the security implications biological data use. The analysis explores various aspects of biological data security, including the vulnerabilities associated with data access, the potential for misuse by state and non-state actors, and the implications for national and transnational security. Key aspects considered include the impact of technological advancements on data security, the role of international policies in data governance, and the strategies for mitigating risks associated with unauthorized data access. This view offers valuable insights for security professionals, policymakers, and industry leaders across various sectors, highlighting the importance of robust data protection measures and collaborative international efforts to safeguard sensitive biological information. The analysis serves as a crucial resource for understanding the complex dynamics at the intersection of biotechnology and security, providing actionable recommendations to enhance biosecurity in an digital and interconnected world. The evolving landscape of biology and biotechnology, significantly influenced by advancements in computer science, engineering, and data science, is reshaping our understanding and manipulation of biological systems. The integration of these disciplines has led to the development of fields such as computational biology and synthetic biology, which utilize computational power and engineering principles to solve complex biological problems and innovate new biotechnological applications. This interdisciplinary approach has not only accelerated research and development but also introduced new capabilities such as gene editing and biomanufact"
