The chemical industry is rapidly expanding in product innovation and specialty manufacturing. Any professional involved in the purchasing of tradename products has experienced problems in identifying and locating these chemicals and is usually forced to spend long and tedious hours consulting a multitude of sources. This moderately priced sourcebook, which is regularly updated, provides brief, accurate descriptions of the product lines including the chemical classification, function, and/or application. Proprietary chemicals are identified by function alone. The scope of this reference includes tradename chemicals from the entire spectrum of chemical materials used in manufacturing. Some of the areas covered are: cosmetic additives catalysts adhesives and sealants paint additives detergent materials wetting agents emulsifiers cutting oils agricultural chemicals colors and pigments fillers, modifiers, and reinforcing materials films plastic compounds, resins, and additives natural and synthetic elastomers, and additives textile specialty chemicals The second part of this book contains a detailed Manufacturers Directory including all the necessary contact information needed by the user to obtain technical and material handling data sheets on individual products directly from the manufacturers. The information provided in this book is the culmination of many years of research and direct contact with over 2300 chemical manufacturers. We are especially grateful to Roberta Dakan for her skill and dedication in the development and maintenance of the tradename database that generated this reference work. Her talent and dedication have been instrumental in the success of this project\n\nM. & I. Ash\n\nNOTE The information contained in this series is accurate to the best of our knowledge; however, no liability will be assumed by the publisher for the correctness or comprehensiveness of such information. The determination of the suitability of any of the products for prospective use is the responsibility of the user. It is herewith recommended that those who plan to use any of the products referenced seek the manufacturer's instructions for the handling of that particular chemical.\n\nABBREVIATIONS ABS acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene absorp . ...absorption ACN acrylonilrile agric agricultural AMP 2-amino -2-methyl-l- propanol anhyd anhydrous applic(s) application(s) ao, aoucous ASA acrylic-styrene-acrylonitrile ATH alumina trihydrate aux . auxiliary BMC bulk molding compound BP..........
