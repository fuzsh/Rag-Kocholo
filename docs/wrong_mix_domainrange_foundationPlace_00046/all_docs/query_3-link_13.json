        "text": "Founded in 1953 by 25-year-old chemist, Murray Glauberman, as a manufacturer of Janitorial and Industrial Specialty Chemicals (professional automotive and janitorial cleaning products). Murray’s father, Abe, joined Malco shortly after and brother, Lionel, in 1960, and together the family embarked on a series of expansions that would take the company from a small single-plant operation to a global multi-plant manufacturing company.\n\n2004\n\nJay Glauberman, son of Murray Glauberman, and brother to Stuart Glauberman, passed away at age 51. Jay, was an integral part of the third generation of leadership that led Malco for many years. His service and dedication to the Greater Akron community, Malco’s employees, his family, and the effort he put forth to build the proprietary brands at Malco, left our organization with a legacy of pride and accomplishment.\n\nStuart Glauberman\n\nFor over 50 years, Stuart Glauberman has been a steadfast leader at Malco Products, Inc. and in the greater Northeast Ohio community. He has worn many hats during his tenure at Malco, including President for over 30 years. However, Stuart’s most important role has always been dad. He proudly transitioned leadership to his children Seth Glauberman and Lauren Osina in January of 2020, and assumed the title of Chairman / Chief Change Agent. He earned a Bachelor of Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1973. Stuart currently serves on the board of the United Way of Summit and Medina County, and as board President of Jewish Akron. In his free time, he enjoys spending time with his family, sailing the Great Lakes, and is a ski instructor in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.\n\nSeth Glauberman\n\nSeth Glauberman is the CEO and President of Malco Products, Inc. He proudly took over the reins of the family company, following in the footsteps of his father, Stuart Glauberman, and Grandfather, Murray Glauberman. Seth earned his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Colorado in 2004 and his Executive MBA from Case Western Reserve University in 2011. Seth currently serves on the board of Project Outrun, where he holds the title of President. In his free time, he enjoys biking, snow skiing, and spending time with his family.\n\nTim White\n\nTim White is the Vice President of Operations at Malco Products, Inc. He manages manufacturing, procurement, and distribution at the company's three facilities in Northeast Ohio. Tim joined Malco in 1997 and has since risen through the ranks. He holds a Bachelor of Science (BS) and an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) in Environmental Chemistry from Kent State University.\n\nLauren Osina\n\nLauren Osina is the Corporate Communications and Marketing Manager at Malco Products, Inc. She is part of the fourth generation of leadership at the family business and enjoys working alongside her dad and brother. Lauren earned her Bachelor of Arts from the University of Colorado in 2007 and her Master of Arts from The Ohio State University in 2011. She currently sits on the boards of the Akron Children’s Museum and The Lippman School. Lauren spends her free time with her family and friends. She enjoys practicing yoga and hiking the various parks of Northeast Ohio with her dog Clover.\n\nKyra Gobora\n\nKyra Gobora is the Director of Human Resources for Malco Products, Inc. As of 2023, Kyra has been with Malco for 15 years. She earned her Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, Finance from the University of Akron in 1992.
