Crashpadz guests otherwise known as \"Crashers\" can stay anywhere from a day to many months. With our competitive rates Crashers can \"test the waters\" before making a longer term commitment. Crashers can enjoy the ultimate in flexibility in terms of living. Once a reservation is made, the Crasher can stay at any of the locations within our network (currently three locations). As more Crashpadz are brought into our network, Crashers will have even more flexibility when traveling and working at locations away from their home base. Crashpadz™ Inc. Overview History In 2014 Zameer Azam (Founder) was a rideshare driver for Lyft and living in one room of his parents rental home located in Daly City, California. While driving for Lyft one night he met a flight attendant, who later on went onto become his girlfriend. The two eventually moved in together into his room. Zameer Azam was working part time as a Lyft driver while also dedicating his time to renovating his childhood home and pursuing a B.S. degree at San Francisco State University. His then girlfriend had suggested that he turn his home into a Crashpad. Unbeknown to Zameer at that time what a “Crashpad” is or was. She had suggested that she take him to one. Upon completion of renovations, he began to build bunk beds in each room and set up a shared accommodation Crashpad structure. Then he listed through the major Airlines mainly United, Virgin and Skywest. Within weeks a steady supply of recently graduated flight attendants looking for an affordable place began to pour in and fill up the bunk beds in a dormitory style setting. As a few months went by flight attendants were relocated and new classes had not yet graduated so beds were remaining empty. Wanting to fill empty beds and generate revenue he decided to open the beds which were not filled on AirBNB. Since then Crashpadz has created its own website and utilizes many different OTA's (Online Travel Agencies i.e. Expedia, Booking.com and since these are aggregator sites the OTA's themselves list on like 10 different partner/affiliate sites, allowing affordable accomodations to always stay in high demand.) 2\n\n4. 3 Short term rentals in homes was a thing of the recent future, we originally priced the beds very low and as demand began to pick up so did the price per bed. Zameer was able to turn a 4 bedroom house that typically rents on the general market for about $3,500 to a whopping $13,000 per month. In effect he took a 4 bedroom house and without building any additional bedrooms, increased the net revenue by over 300%. Demand for affordable accommodations skyrocketed and this is when Crashpadz was born. Crashpadz Inc. (also referred to as “the Company '') owns and operates flexible, affordable, and strategically located crashpad in the bay area. Crashpadz is trying to help in alleviating the shortage of affordable housing in expensive cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City and surrounding areas. Crashpadz provides shared dormitory rooms that give you all the amenities and comfy feelings of being at your home away from home. Crashpadz Inc. launched its first location in Daly City known as SFO Crashpad. SFO Crashpad has become the top choice for travelers due to its competitive prices at an average of $42.40 per night, well-maintained facilities, and close proximity to San Francisco. The Crashpad is only 8 miles from downtown San Francisco, 4.5 miles from San Francisco Airport, and 100 feet from public transportation. The Crashpad currently holds a 4-star rating on Google and Facebook in addition to a “Very Good” rating from leading travel site Agoda. Crashpadz offers clean and spacious rooms as well as several value-added services to ensure satisfied customers. These services include free WIFI, snack machines, a VR game room, fantastic social settings and activities, as well as travel recommendations within the Bay Area. Furthermore, Crashpadz offers flexible rates for short-term or long-term stays, convenient check-out times, self-check-in processes, and does not require guests to provide a security deposit Management Team Zameer Azam Founder/CEO Zameer Azam is an experienced business professional with more than 18 years of experience in sales, marketing, and business development within the residential, transportation, and retail clothing industries.

He also took responsibility in identifying potential Investors for securing more funding and cash flow for the company to expand across the country. 5\n\n7. 6 Immediate Expansion Plan The Company is now raising funds to acquire one of its current business assets. Once this initial backward integration is successful, the Company plans on undertaking a state-wide and nationwide expansion. The Company also aims to bring its concept throughout key locations in major hotspots across the globe. Crashpadz Inc. is seeking a first round of $320k - $1.4M in financing to acquire one of their Crashpads. In order to backward integrate one of its mainstay locations which has actively brought in an average of $13,000 per month and expected to return even more the second year in operation. One of the potential roadblocks for Crashpadz operation would be the complications between Landlord and Tenant. Any conflict of interest between the landowner and Crashpadz could cause potential threat to smooth business operations and also leased property gives us only a certain amount of flexibility in remodelling and furnishing. With the new laws that California passed this year (AB 1482) evictions have skyrocketed and that places Crashpadz at the risk of landlords. By becoming their own landlord Crashpadz will no longer have to worry about evictions and will build equity as mortgages get paid down, instead of losing money renting properties. Crashpadz now has the opportunity to purchase one of their existing running locations. Crashpadz pays around $ 100,000 in terms of current property rentals in 2019 alone and due to an increase in locations this year property rentals go over by 80%. Our business model would be more profitable when Crashpadz owns the properties and paying mortgage and gaining equity in the property, See (Attachment A). It also gives more flexibility and freedom in substantial renovations and redecoration of the properties to bring it up to Crashpad standards. Owning the properties and utilizing the revenue the business generates in paying down mortgages secures the company from the interruptions and disturbance from the property owners and helps to build equity in the properties for the company itself. At a capital infusion of $320k Crashpadz can put 20% down on a $1.4M purchase price of the 1640 Edgeworth property and finance the remaining 80% through a bank. At $1.4 Million Crashpadz can purchase the property in whole and the company would seek an asset backed loan, in which the loan was secured against the property itself. This is the first step needed to implement our backward integration strategy. For our horizontal integration strategy. Crashpadz seeks to buy commercial properties and activate our Crashpad hubs in which short term renters are placed. At a financing of $3.5 million and $5.5 million respectively. In addition to financing costs in buying the undervalued commercial building(s). Crashpadz also seeks a $1 million dollar credit line for covering costs of renovation in bringing the building(s) up to Crashpadz standards . Our first commercial property will be acquired in Daly City, California, 1784 Sullivan Avenue, (See Attachment B) which will hold approximately 84-88 guests. This commercial building has been abandoned now for many years and is in need of rehabilitation and more recently we were able to locate the owners and now have the opportunity to purchase the building and bring about a good use.We will make our commercial Daly City property as our hub to our San Francisco and Daly City residential properties for all guests who want to stay on a long term basis. Our commercial property will be modeled after our residential properties already in our network. We will obtain a permit to run a shared accommodation boutique hotel. The planned accommodation fits into future plans for the city, See \"Daly City 2030, A Plan For The Future, 6\n\n8. 7 Administrative Draft December 2011\" ,http://www.dalycity.org/Assets/Departments/Economic+and+Community+Development/plan ning/pdf/General+Plan+Admin+Draft.pdf. Although the property has already gone through City Council and been approved for use as a 22 unit residential apartment complex. (Attachment B p.20) We would not need to demolish and reconstruct as our business would need to renovate the existing structure in order to bring the building up to city code and build out additional bathrooms and room renovations. The amenities within our commercial property will include a family room, self-use shared kitchen with family style dining room, movie room, gaming room and laundry room. Our second commercial property that will be acquired is located in San Rafael, California. This is a fully functional boutique hotel that has been since converted to long term rental use. The owners are not fully able to capitalize on the potential the property has in generating, See Proforma Statement herein attached as (Attachment C & C1, Pro Forma Statement of La Casa Grande). Crashpadz plans to revert the building back to its original use as a hotel, in doing so Crashpadz will run the hotel as shared accomodations with a 50/50 use of long term and short term guests similar to every location currently in its network. By doing so, Crashpadz should see a market cap rate of 6.81%. Over a one year time frame the building with generate revenue of $706,872 and GRM will increase to market GRM of 12.84 giving the building a valuation of $8.2 million. Calculations showing the breakdown of running a Crashpad business from this location are included as (Attachment D). We have included the financials of operating the business as a Crashpad showing all long terms, half long term and half short term and all short term. And we have included the potential of this property to generate exponential increases in revenue by acquiring additional rooms through the process of attrition. The building as it currently stands can support a $5.5 million dollar 30-year mortgage with a fixed 5-year amortized asset backed loan at 5.5% and still have a cushion. Even increasing to just market rates on current tenants would bring in a 10% increase in monthly revenue. Long-Term Expansion Plan Since the Company’s first three locations have achieved success, the Company will begin working on its long-term expansion plan. The entire scope of this plan is further outlined below. The execution of this long-term expansion plan is contingent on the Company’s ability to raise further capital to fund these initiatives. Phase 1: Commercial Property Acquisition • Crashpadz would like to raise $ 10 Million as its expansion goal for 2020 to acquire 2 Commercial buildings as a part of Crashpad to run short term rental to set up as its gateway for qualifying long term renters to its existing residential properties (refer Attachment D). • Crashpadz will expand outside of the Bay Area further in California and Nevada in 2020. Los Angeles and Las Vegas are two locations that Crashpadz are looking to expand in the near future. 7\n\n9. 8 Phase 2: Licensing the Brand to Independent Operators • The Company will seek to license the Crashpadz Inc. brand to independent operators within the United States. These operations will be able to leverage the Company’s brand presence and will be able to list their properties on the Company’s main website to make online bookings. • Crashpadz Inc. will work to streamline its operational processes, interior design requirements, marketing strategies, and available amenities to ensure that independent operators adhere by the standards set forth by the Crashpadz Inc. brand. The Company will routinely monitor the online reviews and customer feedback of each operator as a means to better understand their performance. Phase 3: The Crashpadz Network Booking Software • Crashpadz Inc. intends to build a state of the art reservation management engine that will allow Guests to find and book Crashpadz within their area. Guests will still be able to book a stay at the Company’s properties through this new portal in a traditional website and Smartphone App. • Guests will have to create an account with Crashpadz and maintain prepaid credits to make reservations and the app will allow self check-in and also manage their reservation. The app lets know about the neighbors (members inside the shared room) and also have options to contact customer support and also report any issues or grievances. • Making new reservations, Making changes to an existing reservation or transferring the reservation inside the network and also cancel the reservations. • The new booking engine will allow guests to choose the bed which they would like to book instead of being assigned one automatically by the system. Current Performance Crashpadz Inc.’s flagship property features over five co-ed bedrooms with multiple bunk-beds resulting in a total capacity of 26 guests at any given time. Demand has remained consistently high as the property is almost fully booked every month. With an average price of $42.40 per night, SFO Crashpad routinely brings in over $13,000 per month at a net income margin of over 50%. DC Crashpad and SFC Crashpad as well performed more than expectations in 2019 within 6 months of operations making it highly profitable. The Company has been able to double its gross every single year since 2015. The Company’s ability to generate significant volume with minimal overhead (approximately $5,000/month) is a testament to its highly profitable and lean business model. 8\n\n10. 9 Meet the Team Crashpadz Inc. was founded by Zameer Azam with the goal of providing affordable accommodation in the Bay Area, where hotel prices can be as high as $338/night. He is joined by his business partner Jason Voelker in 2017. The team is extremely passionate and carrying years of experience in Real Estate and Hospitality industry. The team closely works with guests in order to understand their needs and provide them with the best stay possible. Venkatesh Venkatasubramanian joining in as a CTO of the company in 2020 carry more than 5 years experience in the Information Technology industry adding value to the company's long term goals. There are currently 5 house managers and 4 Janitorial staff. Value Proposition Key Price Advantage Statista reports that the average daily rate for hotels in San Francisco was $338 – the most expensive in the world. This has resulted in limited accommodations for travelers in San Francisco. Crashpadz Inc. solves this problem by offering beds at $42.40 per night, which is more competitive than most hotel operators, Airbnb’s, and other short-stay operators in the area. Flexible and Convenient Crashpadz Inc. offers flexible rates for travelers with unique life circumstances and is able to accommodate short-term or long-term stays. Guests have the option to book a bed at a nightly, weekly, or monthly rate without the need for a security deposit. Crashpadz Inc. even offers a 100% refund on accommodations as long as the cancellation is made three days prior to a listing’s local check-in time. Key services such as free WIFI, self-check-in procedures, and flexible check-out times are also provided to ensure a more convenient stay at its property. Community-Driven Crashpadz Inc.’s main differentiator in the short-stay marketplace lies in its warm, friendly, and home-like social settings. Crashpadz Inc.’s priority is to make everyone feel welcomed at its crashpad and the Company goes to great lengths to ensure their continued satisfaction. Guests are able to interact with each other in a dedicated common room and are invited on multiple social activities such as bar crawls, guided tours, and more. Profitable Business Model Crashpadz Inc.’s business model presents an attractive growth and yield proposition, with good margins through significant volume and generally low costs. A lack of staff overhead results in low monthly expenses of $5,000, which has enabled the Company to boast an enviable net income margin of over 50%. 9\n\n11. 10 Highly Scalable Crashpadz Inc.’s first location is already producing $168,000 per year. Redfin reports that the average price of a home in Daly City is approximately $988,000. Based on the performance of the Company’s first location this would lead to a cap rate of 17%. Combined with lower startup costs, this will easily allow Crashpadz Inc. to pay off its financing for its new properties while generating a superior return than most other properties. Strategic Locations The Company Crashpadz are located in a safe neighborhoods and are within walking distance of major public transit networks connected to San Francisco. The Company will continue to adhere by this criterion when selecting new properties in order to ensure a sustained competitive advantage for its crashpadz. Every new location will also include a thorough study of demographic trends, the presence of competitors, and the distance of the property to major tourist hotspots or economic hubs. Exceptional Facilities The Company strongly believes that every guest deserves clean beds and shared facilities. The Company’s current Crashpadz also offer shared common spaces, designated bathrooms, fully functioning kitchens, and snack machines. The Company will ensure these 5S standards and offerings are kept for each new property especially as the business grows. 5S • Save • Secure • Share • Self-Service • Standardized Testimonials “Best place to stay when you're headed to the bay!

As a result, the market opportunity for Crashpadz Inc. is vast and growing. In addition, there are several factors pertaining to the Company’s industry and its local market that make a compelling case for its expansion. These are further outlined below. *Hostels: We use a hostel as a comparative industry. 13\n\n15. 14 The Growth of the Shared accomodation in the US According to IBISWorld, hostel accommodations represent a $675 million opportunity in the United States. Hostels are quickly becoming the fastest growing segment in the market, due to their appeal among Millennial travelers (aged 18-34) that prioritize affordability, convenience, and the opportunity to meet other like-minded travelers. More importantly, this age category routinely spends over $200 billion on travel every year, higher than any other age group in the US. This combined with the popularity of San Francisco among youth travelers will drive further demand for Crashpadz Inc.’s offerings, increasing its ability to generate revenues. Booming Tourism in Bay Area & California Crashpadz Inc. specifically appeals to guests seeking short-term accommodation near San Francisco for tourism or business purposes. San Francisco welcomed over 25.5 million tourists (both for leisure and business) in 2017 up 1.4% from 2016. Total spending by visitors was $9.10 billion, up 1.4% over $8.98 billion in 2016. Furthermore, the number of tourists visiting San Francisco is expected to hit 26.3 million by 2018, an increase of 3.0% from 2017. More tourism will lead to a larger number of guests in need of short-term accommodation, significantly benefitting Crashpadz Inc.’s operations and its overall expansion plan. Attractive Areas of Expansion Each of the Company’s potential areas for expansion boast high levels of spending on lodging. Based on data collected from ESRI, total spending on lodging within a 1-mile radius within these cities amounted to $6.8 million in San Bruno, $17.4 million in Oakland, and $51.1 million in Daly City. Within a 5-mile radius, these figures grow to $74.7 million in San Bruno, $143 million in Oakland, and $170 million in Daly City. The data proves that a potent market opportunity exists in all three areas the Company is considering for new crashpad properties. 14\n\n16. 15 Industry Analysis Bed & Breakfast and Hostel Accommodations Industry Overview Crashpadz Inc. is a “crashpad” and hostel accommodations company that offers hostel-type rooms with bunk beds for customers that intend to stay on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. A crashpad is a temporary place to stay, most commonly used by airline crew members (pilots, flight attendants, etc.) in between their flights. Thus, the Company primarily competes under the Bed & Breakfast and Hostel Accommodations industry in the US. This industry comprises establishments that are primarily engaged in providing short-term lodging. Excluded from this industry are hotels, motels and casino hotels. Figure 4: Bed & Breakfast and Hostel Accommodations in the US: Industry Snapshot (IBISWorld) Industry Performance The Bed and Breakfast and Hostel Accommodations industry has benefited over the five years to 2018 from a growing economy. Driven by an increase in travel rates and spending during the five-year period, which has positively affected all travel industries, demand for bed and breakfast and hostel accommodation has risen steadily since 2013. Trips by both domestic and foreign tourists have grown over the past five years as the economy has improved. As a result, industry revenue is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 4.2% during the five-year period to $3.2 billion. This includes an increase of 1.4% in 2018 alone. Figure 5: Bed & Breakfast and Hostel Accommodations in the US: Historical and Future Revenue Estimates, 2013-2023 (IBISWorld) Industry Outlook Over the five years to 2023, industry revenue is forecast to increase at an annualized rate of 1.7% to $3.5 billion. The resurgence of travel rates is expected to continue, and travel spending is projected to increase over the next five years as the economy improves. Consumer spending is expected to increase an annualized 1.8% over the next five years. IBISWorld estimates that during the same period, international arrivals will increase at an annualized rate of 3.8%, while domestic travel will increase an annualized 1.6%. The influx of tourist dollars will likely bolster revenue for bed and breakfasts (B&Bs) and hostels. 15\n\n17. 16 Key Industry Trends Growth of Hostels The hostel component of this industry is expected to continue its expansion, particularly into large cities. Hostels will invest in higher-quality facilities, enabling them to command higher room rates as they compete against homeowners and renters making their own lodging available through websites like Airbnb. Hostels will be able to offer some significant competitive advantages to hold on to their market share, such as providing sightseeing and cultural tours, day excursions, bar crawls and other value-adding services that are popular among hostel travelers. Many travelers will also seek the opportunity to meet other like-minded young travelers that they are unlikely to meet in expensive hotels or during stays in other private accommodations. Industry Landscape The industry will continue to remain primarily a small business-focused industry, despite increasing pressure for establishments to combine forces to ward off competition from hotels and providers of informal accommodation. Establishments will increasingly rely on the internet, particularly specialty booking sites, to find customers and maximize their occupancy rates. It is now necessary for industry operators to understand review sites to learn and better understand the preferences of their customers. Products and Services Segmentation Figure 6: Bed & Breakfast and Hostel Accommodations in the US: Products and Services Hostels Other accommodations, including hostels, make up 21.1% or $675 million of industry revenue in 2018. Youth hostels are commonly identified by having low rates, quite often ranging between $15.00 and $50.00 per person per night, depending on the facilities and location. Typical hostel facilities include: separate gender and shared accommodations in dormitories that have between six and 10 beds; shared, but separate, gender shower and restroom facilities; and common or shared facilities, including kitchen, lounge and entertainment areas. Some hostels also offer semiprivate rooms (with anywhere between two and four beds). Whether or not bed linens and towels are provided can also vary among establishments. Some offer on-site educational and other programs linked with local tour guides and tour companies. Nearly all hostels now supply guests with complementary wireless internet. 16\n\n18. 17 Market Analysis Market Overview Crashpadz Inc. will be targeting a wide variety of potential customers in San Francisco. The Company will ensure that its crash pad and hostel accommodations services fit the needs and expectations of foreign and domestic travelers, transport crews (Uber/Lyft Drivers), general consumers and individuals who are transitioning to a new job or new home. Bed & Breakfast and Hostel Accommodations Major Markets The majority of hostel and bed and breakfast (B&B) travelers are leisure travelers, which make up 80.0% of industry revenue. Among leisure travelers, 58.2% of industry customers are vacation travelers, while 21.8% are family travelers. Business customers generate 12.0% of industry revenue while an additional 8.0% comes from other sources, including business meetings and special events. Figure 7: Bed & Breakfast and Hostel Accommodations in the US: Major Markets Youth and Backpacker Hostels In general, these facilities are targeted at international and domestic backpacker visitors. Guests sometimes have to be members of a domestic or international hostel association. Facilities are generally used by younger people, though there are no age restrictions. Most international guests come from Europe (including the United Kingdom), Canada, Australia and New Zealand. While backpackers may seek out inexpensive lodgings for the night, they usually spend the bulk of their travel budget on cultural, environmental and other unique attractions and experiences. Most of the revenue of hostels is derived from accommodation. There may also be some additional revenue from commission on tours booked by guests through the hostel and from the sale of some everyday need items, which may be stocked. Consumer Trends Among Younger Travelers The Appeal of Hostels Among Millennials The enormous growth in the hostel industry has been spurred by millennial travelers (aged 18-35) who are spending more money on longer trips and want to see as much of the world as possible. This age group has revolutionized the hospitality industry as a whole as millennials overwhelmingly prioritize social interactions and shared adventures with newfound friends against the average traveler population. Hostels have swiftly become the preferred choice for millennials they typically offer amenities suited to their needs and expectations. These amenities often include free wireless access, guided tours, bike rentals, libraries and social activities to name a few. A report by PWC on the hostel industry also found that an overwhelming 70% of hostel travelers are millennials. The report goes on to further state that the top reasons among millennials for choosing hostels were: 17\n\n19. 18 • Low Cost (44%) • Convenient Locations (44%) • High Overall Value for Money (43%) • Opportunities to Meet Other Travelers (31%) All of which the Company provides through its unique hostel format. Millennial Spending Habits According to a recent report by PWC, millennials tend to spend at greater levels than the average traveler population despite being much younger and having a lower overall average income. In fact, a 2018 survey by Travelport found that millennials on average spend the most out of any age group with over 34% planning to spend over $5,000 on upcoming vacations. Moreover, Travelport also found that a whopping 55% of millennials surveyed plan to travel in the next 12 months, much higher than the 31% of Generation X respondents and the 20% of Baby Boomer Respondents. According to a 2016 report by Futurecast, millennials spend on average $200 billion on travel every year and this figure is projected to grow as the number of travelers among this age group increases and reach their most lucrative spending years.

Among the remaining businesses, 61% are actually distributed across different counties in the bay area and 10% are based in locations outside the bay area. Because a great percentage of TNC drivers come from outside San Francisco, there is also large demand for temporary living facilities such as Crashpadz Inc.. The breakdown of TNC businesses by their registration areas is found in the table below.

Newly employed individuals may need short-term living facilities, especially those who are coming from other areas outside the city. Further, among the entire work force of the city, more than a third (247,465) are in-bound commuters to San Francisco. These individuals are also potent target markets for the Company. In addition to the different target markets presented above, Crashpadz Inc. will also aim to attract individuals who are transitioning to their new homes. According to Trulia, there were 15,432 homes that were sold in San Francisco in the past 12 months.

Most bed and breakfast (B&B) establishments were reported to be owner-occupied and having only eight rooms. In 2018, the top four industry players earn well under 5.0% of total industry revenue. Hostels, however, can vary from 25 beds in rural areas to up to 500 beds in central city locations. Due to the nature of the industry and its requirement to maintain very high levels of personal hospitality with guests, few operators run more than one establishment. Also, it is not surprising that nearly 87.0% of establishments are small-business operators with nine or fewer employees. There are also no operators that employ more than 250 people. Given the structure of this industry, IBISWorld estimates that this concentration level is unlikely to change over the next five years. 26\n\n28. 27 Crashpadz Inc. will be directly competing with Marriot, Hotel V, Budget Inn, and Motel 6. The Company will supplant its competitors by providing superior services and amenities. The Company places great importance in the cleanliness and overall maintenance of its beds, rooms and the entire establishment. Further, Crashpadz Inc. will be providing movie projectors, coin operated washers & dryers, virtual reality game, Play Station 4s, Xbox 1s, and television sets. Additionally, Crashpadz Inc.’s target locations provide easy access to transportation as well as safe and secure communities. The Company further ensures the safety of its guests by installing CCTV cameras in key areas of each establishment. These features of the establishment are provided in order to provide guests with the best possible experience during their stay. More importantly, Crashpadz Inc. will be providing all mentioned services, features, and benefits at very competitive prices, much lower compared to other hotels and motels in its various target locations. These elements of the Company’s strategy will enable Crashpadz Inc. to outpace its competitors, regardless of their company size and years of operation.

Crashpadz Inc. will increase its reach within the Bay Area by continuing its marketing efforts on several lodging reservation websites such as www.booking.com, www.expedia.com, www.hostelworld.com, and more. Crashpadz Inc. will ensure that each new property is hosted on these websites while providing a budget for web ads and pay-per-click marketing to boost their presence among potential customers. Crashpadz Inc. also has its own booking website (https://www.uscrashpadz.com/) which will also be updated with new properties. The Company deeply understands the long-term importance of good feedback and customer relations on various social platforms and review sites. Thus, Crashpadz Inc. will continue building positive experiences for every customer in order to encourage more positive word-of-mouth referrals and five-star reviews for its current and future locations. We use Review Boost as our online reputation management partner. These initiatives will help Crashpadz Inc.’s reputation online and will help deliver more guests to the business as it grows. Marketing Goals The goal of the Company’s marketing plan is to raise awareness and demand for the Company’s current and future locations while reinforcing an image based on convenience and comfort. Doing so will result in the Company’s ability to attract more guests and acquiring a greater share of the overall market. Crashpadz Inc. will continue to use the following marketing 33\n\n35. 34 channels and tactics to grow demand for accommodations and strengthen customer satisfaction levels. Direct Marketing Initiatives Word-of-Mouth Referrals Positive client testimonials and reviews are one of the strongest forms of advertising and can be a key decision point for many potential customers. Data from the White House Office of Consumer Affairs shows that news of bad customer service reaches more than twice as many ears as opposed to praise for a good service experience. Furthermore, loyal customers are worth up to ten times as much as their first purchase. Cultivating satisfied clients is therefore extremely valuable and profitable towards a business as their opinion and endorsements with colleagues, friends, or family can help result in significant recurring demand for accommodations with Crashpadz Inc. Every positive experience with Crashpadz Inc. encourages guests to share their experience with others. Understanding this, the Company will continue to provide positive experiences worth sharing, and a rewards system for those who do. 34\n\n36. 35 Operational Structure Corporate Information Ownership Zameer Azam/Jason Voelker Business Entity Crashpadz Inc./S-Corp State of Registration California 35"
