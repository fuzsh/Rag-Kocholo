        "text": "Lesotho meets approximately 50 percent of its maximum energy needs with domestically produced hydroelectricity. The government plans to expand hydropower capacity under the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) Phase II and establish wind farms, offering the prospect of an entirely green energy economy within this decade. Lesotho has the potential to supply the Southern Africa grid with its excess power generation. The population primarily lives in small, rural communities, which could benefit from solar energy investments. The government is also interested in taking advantage of carbon credits. There are opportunities for technical experts in energy generation and distribution.\n\nLesotho imports almost all of its manufacturing inputs and consumer goods. It exports its unprocessed primary resources—diamonds, water, wool, and mohair. Opportunities exist to introduce new consumer goods and invest in manufacturing for both local and international markets.\n\nThe government has expressed interest in attracting more U.S. tourists and U.S. investment in the sector. Tourism is one sector that has significant employment potential; however, it is not fully exploited. Lesotho has one of the most pristine and unspoiled natural environments in the region, with spectacular scenery and a huge potential for eco-tourism. The rugged countryside makes Lesotho ideal for off-road sports; Lesotho hosts the “Roof of Africa” motorcycle rally every year. It has the world’s longest commercial single-drop abseil at 204m. Other outdoor sports include canoeing, ski runs, horseback rides, pony trekking, mountain climbing, hiking, fishing, and camping.\n\nLesotho is known for its large and high -quality diamonds and the mining sector has potential. Its mining operations are mostly concentrated on diamonds. The country has five operating mining companies. The Ministry of Mines undertook surveys which reflected potential for additional mines.\n\nLesotho has a comparative advantage in producing high quality agricultural produce due to its climate and abundant water reserves compared to other countries in the region.\n\nThe construction of dams under the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) has led to opportunities in the aquaculture space. Lesotho currently has two companies that export trout to South Africa, Japan, and the United States. The completion of the Polihali Dam will provide more opportunities for new companies to enter into this sub-sector.\n\nThere are also opportunities for U.S. businesses in franchising , restaurants, services, retail shops and hotels. The commercial agriculture sector which includes trout farming, livestock, and horticulture is another area of opportunity. Lesotho is an eligible country under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). This provides Lesotho with duty-free access to the U.S. market with over 6,400 products."
