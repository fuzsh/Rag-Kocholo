        "text": "Up close and personal with one of the GREATEST wonders of the WORLD - The Pyramids at Giza: The Giza Pyramids, built to endure an eternity, have done just that. The monumental tombs are relics of Egypt's Old Kingdom era and were constructed some 4,500 years ago. Egypt's pharaohs expected to become gods in the afterlife. To prepare for the next world they erected temples to the gods and massive #pyramid tombs for themselves‚Äîfilled with all the things each ruler would need to guide and sustain himself in the next world. Each of the three massive pyramids is but one part of a larger complex, including a palace, temples, solar boat pits, and other features. Here‚Äôs what to know about who built them, how they were built‚Äîand the treasures we‚Äôve discovered inside. Who built the Pyramids of Giza? Pharaoh Khufu was the first Egyptian king to build a pyramid in Giza, a project he began in circa 2550 B.C. His #GreatPyramid is the largest in Giza and originally towered some 481 feet (147 meters) above the plateau‚Äîit‚Äôs a bit shorter now with its smooth casing stones long gone. Its estimated 2.3 million stone blocks each weigh an average of 2.5 to 15 tons. Khufu's son, Khafre, built the second pyramid at Giza, circa 2520 B.C. His necropolis, or burial ground, stands out on the landscape because it also includes the Sphinx, a mysterious limestone monument with the body of a lion and the head of a pharaoh. The Sphinx, which before the 1800s spent thousands of years buried in the sand with only its head visible, may stand sentinel for the pharaoh‚Äôs tomb complex, although there‚Äôs no definitive proof that he built it.

Buffett, chairman and CEO, took control of Berkshire, a struggling textile business, in the 1960s and transformed the company into a sprawling empire that encompasses #insurance, #railroad, #retail, #manufacturing and #energy with an unmatched balance sheet and cash fortress. Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway became the 10th public company to surpass the $1 trillion market capitalization milestone on Wednesday, further reshaping the dynamic leaderboard of the most valuable company in the world. What Happened: Under the long-time #leadership of #WarrenBuffett, #BerkshireHathaway has reached the $1 trillion mark, with shares up 28% year-to-date in 2024. The stock is one of eight companies to currently be valued at $1 trillion or more. Berkshire Hathaway is also the first U.S. based non-technology company to pass the milestone. The current list of $1 trillion valued public companies is: #Apple: $3.47 trillion #Nvidia: $3.12 trillion #Microsoft: $3.06 trillion #Alphabet: $2.02 trillion #Amazon.com: $1.80 trillion #SaudiAramco: $1.79 trillion #Meta Platforms: $1.30 trillion Berkshire Hathaway: $1.03 trillion Fun FACTS: As of 2023, the GDP of AFRICA (55 countries) was roughly 3.1 TRILLION U.S. dollars. This was the highest value since 2010 when the continent's GDP amounted to approximately 2.1 trillion U.S. dollars.

But plans to partner and work with other countries are still on the table. Here‚Äôs what to know: Ethiopian Airlines is exploring plans to expand on the #continent, where it has already partnered with operators in #Togo, #Malawi and #Zambia. ‚ÄúA few African governments have requested us to go there to form airlines in partnership,‚Äù Tasew said. Others ‚Äúhave requested us to manage their own airlines without equity partnership, which we are considering as well,‚Äù he said, adding that his company will have ‚Äúsome sort of partnership with at least two African nations in the coming 12 months.‚Äù This could involve investing in existing operators or starting brand-new #airlines together with an African government, he said. Meanwhile, plans to establish a carrier together with institutional investors and the Nigerian government have ended, Tasew said. ‚ÄúIt was not welcomed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur intention was to help the country, but since they objected to the idea, there is no need for #EthiopianAirlines to go there.‚Äù The proposed carrier would have given Ethiopian Airlines a foothold in Africa‚Äôs most populous country, where about 23 domestic airlines compete for influence. Previous government attempts to start a flag carrier have failed.

Biles, 27, memorably withdrew from the #TokyoGames in 2021 due to #mental struggles and attempted to return three years later in the French capital. While her venture was successful, bagging three golds and a silver, Biles admitted to being human and feeling nervous when stepping onto the mat. She also opened up about the relief she felt after her last event. 'Going into, not as nervous,' she told Olympics.com. Coming out, it's just like a breath of fresh air. I feel so much better now that it's over because you know how stressful it is. 'So I just couldn't wait to be done,' Biles continued. 'But I was still trying to cherish every single moment along the way.' Furthermore, Biles also credited going to therapy as a key factor in her performing well and finding balance in and out of #gymnastics. 'I owe a lot of it to #therapy, making sure I'm physically and mentally well,' Biles shared. 'I feel like that's where I find my strength nowadays. I think that translates to the competition floor.' Biles spearheaded a young team and won golds in Individual All-Around, Team All-Around, and Vault. She also won a silver on Floor. Despite becoming the most decorated #Olympic gymnast, she admitted that it came with its challenges and detailed the difference between team and individual competition. 'The girls, they could tell you,' said Biles. 'We were way more nervous for all-around than we were for team. Team, we were so calm and collected and we were having a great time. And then I think the realness set in and it's like, 'Oh this is all-around, this is pretty big.' 'I felt pretty good warming up but not like I did for teams. I really had to calm my nerves and make sure I was in a good headspace before I went out. 'I did not have the best [bar] routine. I had to refocus and re-center myself so I had a good rest of the meet. But it was crazy. The nerves were there and apparent.'

Here‚Äôs what to know: Dada Morero this month became #Johannesburg‚Äôs eighth mayor in just four years (he previously served for 25 days in 2022) and promised an improvement in services. How the city will pay for it is unclear. While Morero says South Africa‚Äôs commercial capital needs $2.5 billion, council documents seen by Bloomberg show it requires $12 billion to repair and upgrade the city‚Äôs neglected #roads, #water and power networks. ‚ÄúThe challenges are huge, but there is appetite to confront them and to find solutions,‚Äù he said in an interview this week. Known as eGoli, or the place of #gold in #Zulu after the source of its once-fabulous #wealth, Johannesburg is a poster child for the nation‚Äôs wider challenges. Few expect much to change in the city of 5 million people. Morero is from the #AfricanNationalCongress, the biggest party in a coalition that runs the council. He replaces Kabelo Gwamanda, who ‚Äî as a member of a tiny party ‚Äî held the post by virtue of a compromise between the alliance‚Äôs largest members. Gwamanda quit amid a storm of criticism following a crippling rise in #electricity prices, an outage that left some suburbs without water for 11 days, a downtown fire that killed 77 people and a methane explosion that ruptured a street in the old central business district. For a city that has almost twice as many millionaires as its closest rivals on the #continent ‚Äî #CapeTown and #Cairo ‚Äî and is the headquarters for several of Africa‚Äôs biggest companies, the decay is hard to fathom. It‚Äôs a glaring example of decades of poor governance that has left many municipalities dysfunctional. The government has recognized the decline in towns and metropolitan areas, with a unit in President Cyril Ramaphosa‚Äôs office planning to focus on fixing local governments. It‚Äôs also hosting a conference this week to work out how to repair and expand creaking power grids. For now though, there‚Äôs likely to be little respite from #potholes, uncollected #garbage and rampant #crime in Johannesburg ‚Äî no matter who‚Äôs in charge.

Four years ago this month, a group of Malian soldiers descended on a #military base in Kati, close to the capital #Bamako, arrested their most senior #leaders, and seized weapons from the armoury. Shortly after, they stormed Bamako in trucks, where they detained then-President Aboubakar Keita, as Malians jubilated in the streets. The August 18, 2020, #coup d‚Äôetat came after weeks of protests against Keita who faced calls to resign, amid accusations that his government was #corrupt and failed to clamp down on an armed rebellion in the country‚Äôs north waged by groups linked to al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS). The new military government promised to tackle the fighters swiftly. That August marked an end to eight years of political stability in #Mali, where between 2012 and 2020 there were no military takeovers in an area that was coup-prone. The takeover also stamped the start of a political ripple in the wider #WestAfrica region that has since seen other civilian governments fall. ‚ÄúWe largely saw civilian rule strengthening in #Africa up until that moment, and I think that the Mali coup was a critical juncture in the weakening of that norm,‚Äù said Dan Eizenga of the United States-based Africa Center for Strategic Studies (ACSS). The slew of coups is reminiscent of the 1980s-1990s when African countries newly liberated from colonial rule faced a barrage of rebellions. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find another four years that has seen so many coups and counter-coups since [that time],‚Äù Eizenga told Al Jazeera. Here‚Äôs how the Malian coup unfolded, and a timeline of the military takeovers that have since followed: https://lnkd.in/eWWA9AuF #NoToCoupsInAFRICA #Africa #Democracy #OneAfrica #Unity #ThisIsAfrica #NoToCoups #AfricanUnion #AU #ECOWAS #BrandAfrica #Peace #Agenda2063 #UnitedAFRICA #NoToCorruption #NoToMilitaryRule\n\nWhy economic emancipation through the Africa-Caribbean partnership really matters: The convening power of the African-Export Import Bank (Afreximbank) was on full display in June as twenty-five current and former Heads of State from the continent and the Caribbean, Ministers and Heads of International Agencies, Aliko Dangote, Jeffrey Sachs, Viola Davis, Wyclef Jean, Rick Ross, Folakwe Olowofoyeku, Boris Kodjoe, and numerous other global brands and renowned individuals, descended on #Nassau the #Bahamas from 12 ‚Äì 15 June, for the Afreximbank‚Äôs 31st Annual Meeting (AAM) and the third AfriCaribbean Trade and Investment Forum (#ACTIF). The theme ‚Äì ‚ÄòOwning our Destiny: Economic Prosperity on the Platform of Global Africa‚Äô. In recent years, Caribbean-Africa relations have been building momentum. In 2021, the inaugural Caribbean Community (CARICOM)-Africa Summit was held virtually. This meeting breathed new life into this historic relationship, given the reality of Africa as the fastest growing continent in the world. In fact, Africa‚Äôs economy sees immense potential. The #AfricaContinentalFreeTradeArea notes that by 2035, there is expected to be a US$450 million boost to the #economy, lifting 30 million people out of #poverty. Recently, the #AfricanUnion declared the #Caribbean as the sixth region of #Africa, marking a full-circle moment, hinging on a proud and celebrated history, but one that holds immense economic and transformative potential for the regions. The #Afreximbank has cemented their role in this partnership, moving beyond rhetoric and sentimentality. In Bahamas, delegates were reminded of the role of the Bank in securing much needed vaccines for Africa and the Caribbean when, during the #COVID19pandemic, individual Caribbean and African vaccine orders were insignificant to garner the attention of vaccine #manufacturers. The Afreximbank under the leadership of Professor Benedict Oramah, guaranteed up to US$ 2 billion through the Africa Medical Supplies Platform for millions of doses to contain the pandemic across the regions.

The satellite was launched at 6:46 p.m. GMT on Friday (16th) from US Vandenberg Air Force base in #California, according to a statement made by Faye on social media platform X. \"After five years of tireless work by our engineers and technicians, this advancement marks a major step towards our technological sovereignty. I would like to express my pride and gratitude to everyone who made this project possible,\" Faye wrote on X. According to reports, GAINDESAT-1A was designed and manufactured by Senegalese engineers in collaboration with the French Space University Center of Montpellier (CSUM). The satellite will primarily gather #data for various state agencies, including the Directorate for Water Resource Management and Planning, to enhance the management of the country‚Äôs resources. Meanwhile, it is also set to provide data for the National Civil Aviation and Meteorology Agency to improve weather forecasting and aviation safety. The launch of this new satellite opens new prospects for #Senegal, both nationally and internationally, while positioning the country as a major player in Africa‚Äôs space sector. Senegal is the latest African country to put at least one satellite in orbit. According to SpaceHubs Africa, 61 satellites have been launched by 17 countries in Africa as of August 19. #SouthAfrica üáøüá¶ and #Egypt üá™üá¨ have the most with 13 satellites each, with #Nigeria üá≥üá¨ a distant third with seven. According to Business Insider Africa, citing the latest annual report from Africa Space Industry, 125 new satellites have been lined up for development in 23 African countries by 2025, while the African space industry is projected to be valued at US$22.64 billion by 2026.
