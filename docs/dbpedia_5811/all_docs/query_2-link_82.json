Participants also considered how to effectively employ different channels for publicising reports and other committee work.\n\nCommittee Scrutiny Workshop,Virtual, 10-12 May 2021\n\nCPA UK partnered with the Parliament of Lesotho to deliver a virtual three-day conference on parliamentary committees. Parliamentarians and clerks from the UK and Lesotho Parliaments shared expertise and considered techniques to increase the effectiveness of committee work, including around launching and delivering inquiries, selecting and questioning witnesses, and maintaining committee cohesion.\n\nParliamentary Procedure & Scrutiny Workshop, Virtual, 26-29 October 2020\n\nThis programme was the first of seven activities of CPA UK's Parliamentary Partnership Programme (PPP) with the Parliament of Lesotho to strengthen the skills and capacity of parliamentarians and parliamentary officials in fulfilling their scrutiny roles. Participants from the UK Parliament, the National Assembly, and the Senate explored recent changes to parliamentary procedure, committee work, women's representation, and communications.\n\nEffective Committees Workshop, Maseru, 5 March 2020\n\nThe workshop provided an introduction to the UK Parliament’s committees and their role in supporting Parliament's work on legislation and scrutiny. It looked at what helps to make them effective at holding the government to account. It was attended by over 50 parliamentarians from the National Assembly and the Senate, including committee chairs, members, clerks and parliamentary staff.\n\nCommonwealth Parliamentarians' Forum – Westminster, 26 February 2018 - 1 March 2018\n\nCPA UK hosted the first Commonwealth Parliamentarians' Forum ahead of the UK hosting Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in April 2018. The Forum brought together national legislators from across the Commonwealth and set the scene for the CHOGM 2018 theme – ‘Towards a Common Future’. The Parliamentarians' Forum sparked dialogue, engaged parliamentarians in the summit agenda and created opportunities for in-depth cross-Commonwealth discussion. The Forum was an invaluable opportunity to reinforce and reinvigorate the Commonwealth’s aspirations, opportunities, challenges and relevance in the coming years."
