        "text": "King Letsie III highlighted the importance of this day in the history of Basotho, stating that it deserves to be celebrated and remembered with dignity. He noted that their forefathers went through many challenges fighting for this country to attain its independence, “We need to protect and take care of our independence as the current generation so that it benefits every Mosotho. We also must work hand in hand to fight against poverty and corruption that has caused instability in our country.” He noted.\n\nHe further said for the past years, the Government of Lesotho celebrated this day by doing improvements but this year, they decided to celebrate it in a special way by launching the bicentenary which is celebrating an anniversary of 200 years since King Moshoeshoe I formed Basotho nation, and it will be celebrated next year. He indicated that historians revealed that Basotho nation was formed with different clans being Bakuena, Bataung, Batlokoa, Makhoakhoa, Bafokeng and many other clans. He said King Moshoeshoe I was able to gather many people under his care as he was a very merciful person and peace lover, “This says Basotho nation was formed under a strong foundation of love, peace and compassion,” he concluded."
