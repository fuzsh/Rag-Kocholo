        "text": "Lesotho officially the Kingdom of Lesotho is a landlocked country and enclave entirely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa. Formerly Basutoland, it is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nBackground History\n\nBasutoland was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho upon independence from the UK in 1966. The Basuto National Party ruled the country during its first two decades. King Moshoeshoe was exiled in 1990, but returned to Lesotho in 1992 and was reinstated in 1995 and subsequently succeeded by his son, King Letsie III, in 1996. Constitutional government was restored in 1993 after seven years of military rule. In 1998, violent protests and a military mutiny following a contentious election prompted a brief but bloody intervention by South African and Batswana military forces under the aegis of the Southern African Development Community. Subsequent constitutional reforms restored relative political stability. Peaceful parliamentary elections were held in 2002, but the National Assembly elections of February 2007 were hotly contested and aggrieved parties disputed how the electoral law was applied to award proportional seats in the Assembly. In May 2012, competitive elections involving 18 parties saw Prime Minister Motsoahae Thomas Thabane form a coalition government - the first in the country's history - that ousted the 14-year incumbent, Pakalitha Mosisili, who peacefully transferred power the following month.\n\nGovernment\n\nCountry Name:\n\nconventional long form: Kingdom of Lesotho\n\nconventional short form: Lesotho\n\nformer: Basutoland\n\nCapital:\n\nname: Maseru\n\ngeographic coordinates:29 19 S, 27 29 E\n\ntime difference: UTC+2 (7 hours ahead of Washington, DC during Standard Time)\n\nIndependence:\n\n4 October 1966 (from the UK)\n\nGovernment Type:\n\nparliamentary constitutional monarchy\n\nExecutive Branch:\n\nchief of state: King Letsie III (since 7 February 1996)\n\nhead of government: Prime Minister Motsoahae Thomas Thabane (since 8 June 2012)\n\nelections: the leader of the majority party, or coalition of parties, in the Assembly automatically becomes prime minister; the monarchy is hereditary, but, under the terms of the constitution that came into effect after the March 1993 election, the monarch is a \"living symbol of national unity\" with no executive or legislative powers; under traditional law, the college of chiefs has the power to depose the monarch, determine next in line of succession or shall serve as regent in the event that the successor is not of mature age\n\nLegislative Branch:\n\nstructure: bicameral Parliament consists of the Senate and the Assembly\n\nJudicial Branch:\n\nstructure: High Court; Court of Appeal, Magistrate Courts, customary or traditional courts\n\n​\n\nPeople & Society\n\nPopulation:\n\n1,942,008 (global rank: 149)\n\ngrowth rate: 0.34% (global rank: 167)\n\nNationality:\n\nnoun:Mosotho (singular), Basotho (plural)\n\nadjective: Basotho\n\nMajor Cities:\n\nMaseru (capital): 239,000\n\nEthnic Groups:\n\nSotho 99.7%, Europeans, Asians, and other 0.3%\n\nReligions:\n\nChristian 80%, indigenous beliefs 20%\n\nLanguages:\n\nSesotho (official) (southern Sotho), English (official), Zulu, Xhosa\n\nLife Expectancy at Birth:\n\ntotal population:52.65 years(global rank: 211)\n\nmale: 52.55 years\n\nfemale: 52.75 years\n\nInfant Mortality:\n\ntotal population: 50.48 deaths/1,000 live births(global rank: 37)\n\nmale: 54.38 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nfemale: 46.45 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nHIV/AIDS:\n\nadult prevalence rate: 23.1% (2012 est.)

Lesotho produces less than 20% of the nation's demand for food. Rain-fed agriculture is vulnerable to weather and climate variability; an estimated 725,500 people will require food assistance in 2012/13. The distribution of income in Lesotho remains inequitable. Lesotho relies on South Africa for much of its economic activity. Lesotho imports 90% of the goods it consumes from South Africa, including most agricultural inputs. Households depend heavily on remittances from family members working in South Africa, in mines, on farms and as domestic workers, though mining employment has declined substantially since the 1990s. Government revenue depends heavily on transfers from South Africa. Customs duties from the Southern Africa Customs Union accounted for 44% of government revenue in 2012. The South African Government also pays royalties for water transferred to South Africa from a dam and reservoir system in Lesotho. However, the government continues to strengthen its tax system to reduce dependency on customs duties and other transfers. Access to credit remains a problem for the private sector. The government maintains a large presence in the economy - government consumption accounted for 39% of GDP in 2013 and the government remains Lesotho's largest employer. Lesotho's largest private employer is the textile and garment industry - approximately 36,000 Basotho, mainly women, work in factories producing garments for export to South Africa and the US. Diamond mining in Lesotho has grown in recent years and may contribute 8.5% to GDP by 2015, according to current forecasts. Lesotho's $362.5 million Millennium Challenge Account Compact, which focused on strengthening the healthcare system, developing the private sector, and providing access to improved water supplies and sanitation facilities, will end in September 2013. Despite the 2008/09 global economic crisis, the economy has had strong, but declining growth since 2010.\n\nGross Domestic Product:\n\nGDP (PPP): $4.265 billion (global rank: 175)\n\nGDP per capita (PPP): $2,200 (global rank: 192)\n\nreal growth rate: 4.1% (global rank: 75)\n\ncomposition by sector: agriculture: 7.4%, industry: 34.5%, services: 58.2%\n\nCurrency:\n\ncurrency: Lesotho Maloti (LSL)\n\nexchange rate (per US Dollar): 9.575\n\nPoverty:\n\nunemployment rate: 25%\n\npopulation below poverty line: 49%\n\nAgricultural Products:\n\ncorn, wheat, pulses, sorghum, barley; livestock\n\nIndustries:\n\nfood, beverages, textiles, apparel assembly, handicrafts, construction, tourism\n\nExport Commodities:\n\nmanufactures (clothing, footwear), wool and mohair, food and live animals, electricity, water, diamonds\n\nImport Commodities:\n\nfood; building materials, vehicles, machinery, medicines, petroleum products\n\nGeography\n\nLocation:\n\nSouthern Africa, an enclave of South Africa\n\nArea:\n\ntotal:30,355 sq km(global rank: 142)\n\nland: 30,355 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncomparative: slightly smaller than Maryland\n\nClimate:\n\ntemperate; cool to cold, dry winters; hot, wet summers\n\nLand Use:\n\narable land: 10.14%\n\npermanent crops: 0.13%\n\nother: 89.72%\n\nNatural Resources:\n\nwater, agricultural and grazing land, diamonds, sand, clay, building stone\n\nCurrent Environmental Issues:\n\npopulation pressure forcing settlement in marginal areas results in overgrazing, severe soil erosion, and soil exhaustion; desertification; Highlands Water Project controls, stores, and redirects water to South Africa\n\n​\n\nTransnational Issues\n\ninternational disputes: South Africa has placed military units to assist police operations along the border of Lesotho, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique to control smuggling, poaching, and illegal migration\n\nhuman trafficking: Lesotho is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking and for men subjected to forced labor; Basotho women and children are subjected to domestic servitude and children, to a lesser extent, commercial sexual exploitation within Lesotho and South Africa; some Basotho women willingly migrate to South Africa seeking work in domestic service only to be forced into prostitution; some Basotho men who voluntarily migrate to South Africa for work become victims of forced labor in agriculture and mining or are coerced into committing crimes\n\nPublished: Monday, March 30, 2015\n\nLesotho officially the Kingdom of Lesotho is a landlocked country and enclave entirely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa.
