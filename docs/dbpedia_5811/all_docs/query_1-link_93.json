        "text": "For Lesotho Independence Day, we are investigating the diplomacy and legacy of King Moshoeshoe I.\n\nChief Moshoeshoe, named after a Sotho or Sesotho term that translates to ‘The Shaver’, was born in modern-day Menkhoaneng, Lesotho in 1796. Born into a royal Basotho lineage, Moshoeshoe inherited his royal status from his father, Chief Mokhachane of Bamokoteli.\n\nHe and his father expanded the Bamokoteli kingdom by conquering other clans in the Southern African region. Moshoeshoe then created his own sept, and became the chief of the group, settling with them at the Butha-Buthe Mountain. He became the founder of the kingdom of Basotho, an area now known as Lesotho, when he and his followers migrated to the Qiloane plateau. Moshoeshoe granted prisoners of war land, and through this political strategy, he successfully united clans. Two-thirds of Lesotho is composed of mountains. Seeing the strategic benefit of the mountains, Moshoeshoe built his home on a fortress atop a mountain. Basotho hats, known as Mokorotlo, commemorate Lesotho’s sacred heritage."
