        "text": "In 1843, Moshoeshoe negotiated British protection over the Basotho people to protect them from falling under the control of the Boers in South Africa. Lesotho became a British Protectorate, known as Basutoland, on March 12, 1868 and was annexed by the British Cape Colony in 1871. In 1884, Basutoland became a British High Commission Territory and ceased being part of the Cape Colony. Lesotho remained under British control when the South African Union was formed in 1910. On October 4, 1966 Lesotho gained its independence as a constitutional monarchy.\n\nThroughout its history, Lesotho has used the monetary system of South Africa. The British Pound Sterling (GBP), and especially British coins, circulated in South Africa until 1920 when South Africa established the South African Pound (ZAP) as a separate currency at par. The Pound was divisible into 20 Shillings or 240 Pence. The South African Rand (ZAR) replaced the South African Pound on February 14, 1961 at the rate of 2 Rands equal to 1 Pound. The Rand is divisible into 100 Cents. South African Rand are still legal tender in Lesotho. The South African Reserve Bank began issuing banknotes in 1921. Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa and Swaziland left the Sterling Area on June 23, 1972 when the United Kingdom officially went off the gold standard.\n\nA set of commemorative coins was issued for Lesotho in 1966 and the first coins were issued for circulation in 1979. On January 22, 1980, Lesotho began issuing its own currency, the Lesotho Loti (LSL) (plural, Maloti), which is tied to the South African Rand at par. The Loti, divisible into 100 Lisente, was issued by the Lesotho Monetary Authority from 1980 until 1981, and by the Central Bank of Lesotho since then. The South African Rand is legal tender in Lesotho, and South Africa makese seignorage payments to Lesotho."
