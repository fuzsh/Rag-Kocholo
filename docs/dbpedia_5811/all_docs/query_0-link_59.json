As you interact with the Program Website or the Unity App, we will automatically collect technical data about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns. We collect this information by using cookies and other automated technologies as described in Sections 19 through 39. We may also receive technical data about you if you visit other websites employing our cookies. We may use such information to analyze the use of the Program Website and improve its features and performance to provide you with a better browsing experience.\n\n(a) Cookies.\n\n18. The Program Website uses “cookies” to help us understand which parts of the Program Website are the most popular and the preferences of Program Website users. We may also use cookies to study traffic patterns on the Program Website, to improve its functionality and usability, to improve the effectiveness of our communications with users, to customize your experience, and to provide greater convenience to you during your interactions with the Program Website.\n\n19. A cookie is a unique alphanumeric identifier that websites use to help identify the number of unique visitors to a website, whether or not those visitors are repeat visitors, and the source of the visits. If you prefer to disable cookies, you may do so through your web browser’s security settings. Please note that certain features of the Program Website may not be available once cookies have been disabled.\n\n20. We may use two types of cookies: (i) Session cookies; and (ii) Persistent Cookies. Session Cookies and Persistent Cookies are categorized as: (a) Strictly Necessary Cookies; (b) Performance Cookies; (c) Functional Cookies; and (d) Targeting Cookies.\n\n21. Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off your device. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are visiting the Program Website. If you have logged into your Account, this allows us to process your online transactions and requests, and verify your identity as you navigate through the various online pages. If you have disabled your Session Cookies as a guest without logging into your Account, your choice will only be effective for that single session, and you will need to opt-out again.\n\n22. Persistent Cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your device.\n\n23. Strictly Necessary Cookies. Strictly Necessary Cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. Strictly Necessary Cookies do not store any Personal Information.\n\n24. Performance Cookies. Performance Cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of the Program Website. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the Program Website. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow Performance Cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and we will not be able to monitor its performance.\n\n25. Functional Cookies. Functional Cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow Functional Cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.\n\n26. Targeting Cookies. Targeting Cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. Targeting Cookies do not store directly Personal Information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.\n\n(b) Clear GIFs or Web Beacons.\n\n27. Clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs, or pixel tags) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your device’s internal storage, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs in connection with the Program to, among other things, track the activities of Program Website visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Program Website usage.\n\n28. We and our service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our guests, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.\n\n29. Some of our email communications to you may contain links to content on the Program Website. When you click one of these links, it passes information through the Program Website web server before you arrive at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications.\n\n30. If you prefer not to be tracked, simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in emails you receive from us. In addition, you may view and change your preferences at any time by using the ‘Privacy Settings’ in your web browser.\n\n(c) Server Log Files.\n\n31. The Program Website gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (“IP”) addresses, browser type, operating system, internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, date/time stamp of access, and clickstream data, and information about the content you view on the Program Website. When you visit the Program Website, the servers automatically log your IP address, the time and duration of your visit, and the time and duration spent on the pages of the Program Website which you view. If you arrive at the Program Website by clicking a paid advertisement or a link in a communication, then the server will capture information that tracks your visit from that link. If you arrive at the Program Website by clicking on a non-paid source, such as a search engine result or link on another website, the server captures information that tracks your visit from that source, to the extent available. The server also captures information from direct traffic. The server log files are not analyzed with respect to individuals.\n\n(d) Geolocation.\n\n32. If you have provided permission (opt-in) through the Unity App on your mobile device to allow us to collect location information, we may obtain your physical location information from technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell tower proximity. We may use the geolocation features and geolocation information that is collected to provide you with information regarding Participating Locations, events, and promotional offers in, or near, your area or current location.\n\n33. You are able to withdraw your permission for us to acquire physical location information from your mobile device through your mobile device settings at any time. If you have questions about how to disable your mobile device's location services, we recommend you contact your mobile device service provider or the mobile device manufacturer.\n\n(e) Do Not Track Signals.\n\n34. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in the Cookies Section of this Privacy Policy (e.g., by disabling cookies). Please note that we do not collect, and are not aware of third parties that collect, Personal Information from users of the Program Website, or about their online activities on third party websites.\n\n(f) Third-Party Analytics.\n\n35. We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of the Program Website, Unity Apps, and our online services. You can learn about Google’s practices by clicking on https://policies.google.com/privacy, and you may opt out by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser. The server also captures information from direct traffic. We use these tools to help us improve the Program Website, Unity Apps, our online services, and your user experiences. These devices and applications may use cookies, tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies to perform their functions. We do not share your Personal Information with these third parties.\n\n(g) Unity App.\n\n36. When you download or register to use the Unity App, you may submit Personal Information to us such as your name, email address, phone number, username, password, and other registration information.\n\n37. Further, when you use the Unity App, we may collect certain information automatically, including technical information related to your mobile device, your device's unique identifier, your mobile network information, the type of mobile browser you use, and information about the way you use the Unity App.\n\n38.

We may also share your Personal Information with third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your Personal Information in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy.\n\n53. We may sell your Personal Information to third parties with whom we may partner in order: (a) to provide you with a better guest experience; or (b) for you to receive offers from those third parties that we believe may be of value to you. As of the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we have not sold any of your Personal Information.\n\nHOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR?\n\n54. We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which we collected the Personal Information, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may retain your Personal Information for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.\n\n55. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we Process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or other requirements. Notwithstanding, as a general policy, we do not retain Personal Information for longer than seven (7) years.\n\n56. In some circumstances we will anonymise your Personal Information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for historical research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.\n\n57. When we no longer need to Process or retain your Personal Information, records, both physical and electronic, will be destroyed.\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.\n\n58. As a global organization, we may internationally transfer your Personal Information we collect between the Hard Rock Affiliated Parties (including Hard Rock’s headquarters in the United States), Participating Locations, service providers, and third-party partners.\n\n59. We may store and/or Process your Personal Information in the United States, or in Canada, or in other jurisdictions.\n\n60. Some of the jurisdictions to which Personal Information is transferred may not provide the same level of privacy protection as your local jurisdiction. However, whenever we transfer your Personal Information outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or the United Kingdom (UK), we rely on the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF) and the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, as described in the following section and, in the event of its future invalidation, we implement adequate safeguards in accordance with Applicable Laws in order to ensure a similar degree of protection as the country of origin.\n\nEU-U.S. DATA PRIVACY FRAMEWORK (DPF) AND THE UK EXTENSION TO THE EU-U.S. DPF COMPLIANCE\n\n61. Hard Rock participates in and complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), and the UK Extension of the EU-U.S. DPF as approved by the European Commission in its adequacy decision issued on July 10, 2023. Hard Rock complies with the EU-U.S. DPF and UK Extension DPF Principles, that were developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission in order to provide organizations in the United States with a reliable mechanism for personal information transfers to the United States from the EU and UK while ensuring that EU data subjects and UK data subjects continue to benefit from effective safeguards and protection as required by European legislation with respect to the processing of their personal information when they have been transferred to non-EU countries.\n\n62. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF and UK Extension DPF Principles, the EU-U.S. DPF and UK Extension DPF Principles shall govern.\n\n63. To learn more about the EU-U.S DPF and UK Extension DPF and view our certification, please visit the DPF website at https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search.\n\n64. Hard Rock commits to cooperate with the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU and UK in the context of the employment relationship.\n\n65. Hard Rock and the following U.S. subsidiaries comply with the EU-U.S. and UK Extension DPF Principles:\n\nBoardwalk 1000, LLC\n\nHard Rock Cafe International (STP), Inc.\n\nHard Rock Cafe International (Hollywood), Inc.\n\nHard Rock Cafe International (Orlando), Inc.\n\nHard Rock Cafe Merchandise, Inc.\n\nHard Rock Casino Cincinnati, LLC\n\nHard Rock Hotel Licensing, Inc.\n\nSeminole Hard Rock Support Services, LLC\n\nHard Rock Sacramento FM, LLC\n\nSeminole Hard Rock Digital, LLC\n\nSeminole Hard Rock Entertainment, Inc.\n\nSpectacle Gary Holding, LLC\n\n66. In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, Hard Rock commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Information.\n\n67. If you have any question or complaint regarding our participation in the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension of the EU-U.S. DPF or the processing of your Personal Information you may contact us as indicated below in the section of this Privacy Policy “HOW TO CONTACT US”.\n\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION\n\n68. When other dispute resolution avenues are exhausted, you may invoke the binding arbitration. Hard Rock Cafe International (USA), Inc. has provided a private sector independent recourse mechanism (located in the United States) to investigate and expeditiously resolve individual complaints and disputes. This dispute mechanism will cover all Personal Information except for human resource data. For more information, visit the website for ICDR®/AAA®EU-U.S. DPF: International Centre for Dispute Resolution®, the international division of the American Arbitration Association® (ICDR/AAA) at https://www.icdr.org/dpf. The services of ICDR/AAA are provided at no cost to you.\n\n69. Under certain limited conditions and as a last resort, the individual can invoke binding arbitration. The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Hard Rock’s compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF.\n\n70. If Hard Rock transfers your Personal Information to a third party, we will ensure the third party is contractually obligated to process your Personal Information only for limited, specific purposes consistent with this policy, to apply the same level of protection to that data as the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and notify us if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet this obligation. Upon notice, Hard Rock will take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of Personal Information received pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF, Hard Rock is potentially liable.\n\nYOUR RIGHTS.\n\nOverview.\n\n71. Under applicable data protection laws, you have a number of rights in relation to the Personal Information that we hold about you. These rights might not apply in every circumstance. You can exercise your rights by contacting us at any time using the details set out in this Privacy Policy (see the Section headed, “Our Contact Details”).\n\n72. The table in this Section sets out the rights that you have over your Personal Information. Please note that although we take your rights seriously, there may be some circumstances where we cannot comply with your request. For example, if complying with your request would put us in a position of non-compliance with our own legal or regulatory requirements. In these instances, we will let you know why we cannot satisfy your request.\n\nYOUR RIGHTS DESCRIPTION Right of Access This is commonly known as a “data subject access request”. It entitles you to inquire whether we are processing your Personal Information, what type of Personal Information, how we process it, and also to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you. Right to Rectification\n\nThis right entitles you to request us to correct any incomplete or inaccurate Personal Information we may hold about you.\n\nWe always take care to ensure that the information we hold about you is accurate and where necessary, up to date. As part of the Membership Terms, you are required to provide complete and accurate information in connection with your enrolment and participation in the Program, and to update that information promptly if there are any changes or if it becomes inaccurate.\n\nIf you believe that there are any inaccuracies, discrepancies, or gaps in the information we hold about you, you may change your personal details anytime in your account profile on the Program Website or Unity App, or by contacting Unity Customer Care by telephone at +1 (888) 519-6683 or by email at [email protected].\n\nNote that we may need to verify the accuracy of any new data you provide to us. As such, we may require you to send supporting documentation prior to allowing certain changes (e.g., any changes to your legal name). Right to Erasure or Right to be Forgotten\n\nThis right entitles you, in certain circumstances, to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information. These circumstances include, for example:\n\nwhere we no longer need your Personal Information for the original purpose we collected it for;\n\nwhere you have exercised your right to withdraw consent;\n\nwhere you have successfully exercised your Right to Object to processing; or\n\nwhere we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law.\n\nNote, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure. While we will assess every request, there are other factors that we will need to take into consideration. For example, we may be unable to erase your information if retention of your Personal Information is reasonably necessary to:\n\nmeet our legal obligations;\n\nresolve disputes;\n\nmaintain security;\n\nprevent fraud and abuse; or\n\nenforce the Membership Terms.\n\nWe may also need to retain your Personal Information if required by gaming industry regulations, tax statutes, and other legal requirements (e.g., information on our guests who self-report; tax reporting documents; player winnings, and any statistics, reports or listings that are required to comply with Applicable Laws or protect Participating Locations). Right to Restriction\n\nThis right entitles you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in certain scenarios including the following:\n\nif you want us to establish the accuracy of your Personal Information;\n\nwhere our use of your Personal Information is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it;\n\nwhere you need us to hold the Personal Information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or\n\nwhere you have objected to our use of your Personal Information, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.\n\nRight to Data Portability\n\nThis right entitles you to request the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party in certain circumstances.\n\nWe will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to processing carried out by automated means which you initially provided consent for us to use, or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. Right to Object\n\nThis right entitles you to object to our processing of your Personal Information in certain circumstances.\n\nIn some cases, we may refuse your request to object to our processing of your Personal Information, for instance, when we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your Personal Information which outweighs any prejudice to your rights and freedoms.\n\nWith respect to direct marketing, you have certain controls over the extent to which we market to you, and you have the right to request that we stop sending you certain marketing messages at any time. For information about how to let us know you do not want to receive certain marketing messages, see the Section entitled, “Marketing Communications And Your Communication Preferences”.\n\nPlease note that even if you exercise this right because you do not want to receive certain marketing messages, we may still send you Program, Account, and transactional related communications where necessary. Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on Automated Decision-Making, including Profiling\n\nWe may use your Personal Information and share it with advertisers and advertising networks, analytics and search engine providers, social networking companies (i.e., Facebook), and rewards companies for the purpose of “profiling”, which includes evaluating your personal aspects to analyze or predict aspects concerning your economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location, or movements and segmenting you into a group with other Members or other persons who have similar personal characteristics. We may use this profiling to make automated decisions, meaning without human interference, to improve the efficiency of our marketing and to offer certain benefits to you or other persons based on this profiling. You have the right to opt-out at any time of our sharing of your Personal Information in this way.\n\nIn addition, we may also use your Personal Information to generate a “lookalike audience” or similar audience of prospective customers through the platforms of advertisers and advertising networks, analytics and search engine providers, social networking companies (e.g., Facebook) and rewards companies. This allows us to target advertisements to potential customers who appear to have shared interests or similar demographics to you (based on the platform’s own data). By way of example, we do this by uploading a data list to Facebook that is encrypted and anonymized (i.e., you cannot be individually identified on the data list). Facebook then matches the encrypted and anonymized data list against Facebook’s own customer base to generate the lookalike audience. Facebook then deletes the data list we provided to them, and uses it for no other purpose. We do not have access to the identity of anybody in the lookalike audience generated from Facebook’s own customer base, unless they choose to click on the ads for our products and services.\n\n73. You can exercise your rights described in this Privacy Policy by contacting us using the contact details set out in the Section entitled, “How to Contact Us”. As a security measure, we may need to verify your identity when we receive your request, and we may need you to provide valid proof of identification. In addition, we may also contact you to ask for more information about your request to help us with our response.\n\n74. Note that if you exercise your rights over your Personal Information and have more than one account with us, you will need to instruct us on each account separately.\n\nNo Fee Usually Required.\n\n75. You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your rights described in this Section). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if we, in our sole discretion, consider your request is unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request.\n\nResponse Time.\n\n76. We try to respond to all legitimate requests based on your rights described in this Privacy Policy within one (1) month. Occasionally it could take us longer than one (1) month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.\n\nTHIRD-PARTY LINKS.\n\n77. The Program Website and the Unity App may contain links to third-party websites, plug-ins, and applications (“Third-Party Platforms”) whose privacy policies may differ from ours.\n\n78. Clicking on those links may allow third parties to collect or share Personal Information about you. If you leave the Program Website or Unity App, we encourage you to carefully read and understand the privacy policies issued by these Third-Party Platforms.\n\n79. Please note that we do not control these Third-Party Platforms and are not responsible for their privacy policies, statements, and practices (even if you access such platforms using links from the Program Website or Unity App). We do not accept any responsibility or liability in respect of these Third-Party Platforms.\n\nHOW WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE.\n\n80. We use industry standard security safeguards to help protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. In addition, we limit access to your Personal Information to those employees, agents, contractors, service providers, and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only Process your Personal Information on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. Despite these efforts, please understand that as no system is perfect, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access or theft of data will not occur, so you should exercise caution when transferring personal and other sensitive information over the Internet.\n\n81. Please advise us immediately at [email protected] of any incident involving the loss of or unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal Information that is in our custody or control. We maintain Incident Response and Business Continuity Plans to address data incident situations.\n\n82. You are responsible for keeping your Account Credentials confidential. You should not share such Account Credentials with any other person, as you are responsible for all activity on your Account. Be sure to sign off when finished if you are using a shared device. You must notify us immediately if you are aware or suspect any unauthorized use of your Account. Please note that we will never ask for a password other than on the log-in page on your Unity online account (which is accessible through the Program Website or the Unity App). Links are available on the Program Website and the Unity App to request assistance for logging into your online Account.\n\nPROTECTING CHILDREN.\n\n83. We are mindful of the privacy of children as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards concerned, and their rights in relation to the processing of Personal Information. For these reasons, promotions, and activities by us addressed to children always receive specific attention and protection. We always rely on consent as a lawful basis for processing of Personal Information relating to children, and we always get consent from whoever holds custodial responsibility for the child.\n\nUPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.\n\n84. We reserve the right to update, change, revise, modify, amend, supplement, or replace this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Changes”) at any time in our sole discretion by providing notice of the Changes by posting the revised Privacy Policy (incorporating the Changes) to the Program Website. In addition, we, in our sole discretion (unless required by Applicable Laws), may provide notice of the Changes by sending a copy of the revised Privacy Policy via email to Members. If you continue to access or use the Program Website or the Unity App, or continue to participate in the Program, after the revised Privacy Policy has been posted, or after receiving a copy of the revised Privacy Policy (incorporating the Changes) by email (if we choose to send you an email); then subject to Applicable Laws, you will be deemed to have accepted such Changes and the revised Privacy Policy shall become binding upon you as of the date that the revised Privacy Policy became effective. We therefore encourage you to review our Privacy Policy periodically for the most up-to-date information.\n\n85. If you disagree with the revised Privacy Policy, then your sole and exclusive remedy is to withdraw from the Program and terminate your Membership in accordance with the Membership Terms.\n\nU.S. STATE-SPECIFIC PRIVACY LAWS.\n\n86. If you reside in U.S. States with comprehensive data privacy laws, then, in addition to the rights you have under this Privacy Policy, you are entitled to the additional disclosures and rights set out in the U.S State-Specific Privacy Laws depending on the particular State in which you reside.
