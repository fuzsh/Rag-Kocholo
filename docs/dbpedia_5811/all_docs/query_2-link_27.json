Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLesotho is officially known as the Kingdom of Lesotho and is located in southern Africa. Lesotho is one of only three enclaved countries, along with Vatican City and San Marino. It is entirely bordered by the nation of South Africa.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on the Lesotho or alternatively, you can download our 19-page Lesotho worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nBRIEF HISTORY\n\nLesotho was originally occupied by the Khoisan, which were local tribes of hunter-gatherers.\n\nAfterward, the Bantu tribes came, and they were followed eventually by the Sotho-Tswana peoples.\n\nKing Moshoeshoe I united the land under one rule for the first time in 1822.\n\nFormerly named Basutoland, Lesotho was constituted as a native state under British protection in 1843 by a treaty signed with the native chief, Moshoeshoe.\n\nLesotho was annexed to Cape Colony in 1871. However, it was restored to direct control by the Crown in 1884.\n\nThe colony of Basutoland turned into the independent nation of Lesotho on October 4th, 1966, with King Moshoeshoe II as sovereign.\n\nFor the first 20 years, the Basotho National Party prevailed in power.\n\nLesotho has since had shifts in power and leaders with some protests and some unrest.\n\nGEOGRAPHY\n\nLesotho is a small mountainous country, with the capital being Maseru.\n\nLesotho is located on the African continent. The country is landlocked and is an enclave of South Africa, which means Lesotho is entirely enclosed and surrounded by South Africa.\n\nLesotho is approximately the size of Belgium, or a little bit smaller than Massachusetts in the USA.\n\nThe country lies on a high plateau with hills and mountains.\n\nLesotho is the world’s highest country considering the entire country is situated over 1,000m (3,280ft.) above sea level. Eighty percent of the county lies above 1,800m (5,906ft) above sea level.\n\nThe highest point of Lesotho is Thabana Ntlenyana at 3,482m (11,423ft.) high.\n\nLesotho’s climate is a temperate climate with cold and dry winters from May until September. The rainy, hot summer season is experienced from November to March.\n\nThe Sehlabathebe National Park belongs to the UNESCO world heritage site.\n\nMaloti-Drakensberg Park houses several endangered species, such as the Cape vulture.\n\nThere is a small international airport in the capital city of Maseru, in which only smaller planes can land and depart from the country.\n\nECONOMY\n\nThe main economy in Lesotho is driven by manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism.\n\nLesotho’s main agricultural products include corn, wheat, pulses, and sorghum.\n\nKatse Dam is the main source of energy in Lesotho. The country is one of the few in the world that generates and uses only renewable energy through hydroelectric power. However, most of the locals (70%) in Lesotho live without electricity.\n\nIn common Basotho families, the main breadwinners work either on their own farms, in the textile industry, or in the government, which is the biggest employer in the country.\n\nMost of them also have at least one family member who works in South Africa on farms or in the mines.\n\nThese members of the family send remittances (money) back home to support their family in Lesotho.\n\nThe main exports are clothing, footwear, wool, food, electricity, water, and diamonds. The biggest export partners are South Africa (57%) and the USA.\n\nPEOPLE IN LESOTHO\n\nBasotho is what the people in Lesotho are called. More than half of the population is extremely poor, with many still residing in thatched-roof huts made from bricks and mud. These huts are called rondavels.\n\nThese rondavels have been replaced by contemporary houses and multi-story buildings in the towns and cities, as you can observe in the capital city of Maseru. Additionally, about 75% of the population lives in rural areas.\n\nThe traditional clothing attire of the Basotho people is a blanket, a beautiful patterned woolen garment that every Basotho person wears proudly!\n\nLesotho has the world’s second-highest HIV rate. This means that one in four people is infected with AIDS. Thus, the life expectancy of the Basotho people is quite low.\n\nThe health system is very limited, with only 7 doctors for every 100,000 people in Lesotho.\n\nHowever, education has developed significantly in the last decade. Most adults in the country can now read and write, as seen by the literacy rate of 80%.\n\nSesotho and English are the official languages in Lesotho, but some people also speak Xhosa or Zulu.\n\nLesotho Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the Lesotho across 19 in-depth pages.
