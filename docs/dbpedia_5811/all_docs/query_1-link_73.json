        "text": "3 ‘…there are among these people all the elements of a regular government, nearly allied to the representative form, which only require to be developed by the aid of Christianity, in order to furnish every possible security of justice and good administration.’ E. Casalis, The Basutos, J. Nisbet & Co., London, 1861, p. 236.\n\n12 The colonial government’s defence would be that (a) the system was agreed to by all parties, and (b) if it had wanted to defeat the BCP it would have backed the MFP, which looked a stronger challenger to Congress than did the National Party. A detailed examination of all the points which caused friction can be found in P. B. Sanders (Chief Electoral Officer), Draft Report on the Basutoland General Election 1965 (photocopy in Rhodes House Library, Oxford).\n\n18 ‘Before any important public occasion it is, or was until recently, the custom for a great chief to send two specially doctored oxen driven by a naked runner through the night to the grave of Moshesh on the summit of Thaba Bosiu. At dawn the Chief himself arrives and he too climbs the mountain. The nature of the ceremony which takes place is kept secret; the appropriateness of the place selected is obvious.’ G. Tylden, The Rise of the Basuto, Juta, Cape Town/Johannesburg, 1950, p. 112. The British officer commanding the police at Thaba‐Bosiu was even likened to the Boer Commandant, L. Wepener (The Friend, 31 March 1967), who was killed in an attempt to storm Thaba‐Bosiu in 1865. D. C. F. Moodie, History of the Battles and Adventures of the British, the Boers, and the Zulus, & c., in Southern Africa, Murray & St. Leger, Cape Town, Vol. II, 1888, pp. 109–15.\n\n51 It is noteworthy that in the three by‐elections held after the general election in 1965 the average swing from the BNP to the BCP had been 6·3 per cent. Three subsequent vacancies were never filled (Kolberg, ‘Maletsunyane and Qeme). The opposition view was that the government was afraid to test its popularity.\n\n53 The Friend, 28 January 1970; this was after the report of the one serious incident of the campaign, the shooting of one man by the police at Bela‐Bela, Koeneng constituency, just after the polling station had closed at 5 p.m., Koena News, Vol. IV, No. 19, 28 January 1970.\n\n56 The Electoral Act 1968 provides (Section 58): ‘(1) When the counting of votes… has been completed, the returning officer shall declare by word of mouth, inside and outside the building in which the votes were counted, the candidate who has received the greater or the greatest number of votes, to be the duly elected member of the National Assembly for the constituency in which the poll was held, with effect from the date of the Polling day in respect of the election in question.… (3) The returning officer shall advise the Chief Electoral Officer and the electoral officer concerned, in the prescribed form… and shall cause a copy of such declaration to be posted on the principal outer door of the building where the votes were counted. (4) Any declaration by the returning officer under this section shall be final, subject to reversal on petition to the court that such declaration to be set aside’ (my italics).\n\n57 Following the expression of doubts as to the impartiality of a single civil servant Chief Jonathan announced that a commission of international composition, under an internationally respected chairman, would be appointed, Rand Daily Mail, 3 February 1970. He subsequently reverted to the idea of an enquiry by A. S. Mohale, Lesotho’s former ambassador to the United Nations, Koena News, Vol. IV, No. 25, 8 February 1970.\n\n75 Moeletsi, Vol. XXXVIII, No. 1799, 24 October 1970. Nevertheless, talk of a coalition government has remained the major political talking point. Ultimately, despite the combined opposition of Commissioner Roach and Chiefs ‘Maseribane and Peete, it appears that a coalition government including Mokhehle will be a sine qua non for restoring some degree of normality to the troubled kingdom."
