Vulnerable people, such as mothers during childbirth, under-nourished and malaria-affected children, victims of trauma and accidents, and patients suffering from sickle cell and other chronic diseases, particularly benefit from this care1.\n\nMafeteng- The 7th of April every year is celebrated as World Health Day. Health is a fundamental right of every human being regardless of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or social status.
