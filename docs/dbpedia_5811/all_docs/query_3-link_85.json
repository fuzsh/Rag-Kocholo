It should be acknowledged that around 20,000 nodes existed in Lesotho at the start of 2014. Predominantly these were the main highways, and tourism locations and a selection of large public buildings in Maseru City. This mapping was sporadic. The first \"co-ordinated\" effort to Map Lesotho started in February 2014, initially in a residential suburb called Ha Foso, which is at the north of Maseru City straddling the border with Berea district.\n\nPhase 1 - Completed Mar - Jun 2014\n\nA pilot phase existing for a few months between March and June 2014. Here the mapping related to specific towns, and also to a cluster of rural villages to establish any issues that could arise in the future with tagging, tracing and network use in Lesotho. The following tasks existed at at time.\n\nMafeteng which was 100% done and 27% validated\n\nQacha's Nek which was 99% done and 2% validated\n\nHlotse which was 99% done and 13% validated\n\nMokhlakeng which was 99% done and 5% validated\n\nPhase 2 - July 2014 - May 2016\n\nThere were four large tasks set up for the Lesotho Mapathon basemap phase that started in July 2014. These tasks enabled the completion of a basic base map for the country comprising of all highway types, all waterway types and settlements mapped as landuse=residential. These tasks were completed in May 2016,\n\nPhase 2 Mapping Tasks Task # 597 Task # 599 Task # 894 Task # 1169 Link Link Link Link\n\nPhase 3 - Jun 2016 - Nov 2017\n\nThese tasks began in June 2016. These involved mapping the whole country in much finer detail, down to the level of buildings, barriers, landuse, highway classification etc. These tasks were broken out according to district boundaries as well as Maseru City having a task on its own due to the volume of mapping to be completed in that area. All tasks were largely completed by Nov 2017. Details of each task associated with this phase are listed in the table below.\n\nJob no.

This phase is envisaged to move more towards traditional surveying and mapping in the OSM context where an area is selected, surveyed in detail and mapped to a greater degree.\n\nThere is a series of guides outlining how to complete phase 4 mapping available from here.\n\nSpecial Lesotho Content\n\nThis section provides those special features that are there in Lesotho and not found in other countries. The table below provides those features and their tagging names as they appear in JOSM.\n\nCLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION TAGS PICTURE SATELLITE IMAGE Khotla A place where only men and boys spend their evenings close to the kraal (Lesaka) and women and girls are not allowed to stay.\n\nFor this area no existing tags.\n\narea=yes\n\nfemale=no\n\nmale=yes\n\nMotebo A small hut enclosed by a kraal in the cattle post areas used by shepherds as shelter and keeping their valuable materials. building=hut\n\nhut=motebo\n\nMophato A place and normally a small hut in the mountains where circumcision takes place. building=hut\n\nhut=mophato access=private\n\nMokhoro A round Basotho house constructed by stones and straw roofing. building=hut\n\nhut=mokhoro roof:material=thatch\n\nLipatlo White zebra markings on the road allowing pedestrians to cross the street often includes a traffic calming hump. traffic_calming=table\n\nhighway=crossing\n\nSpaza Small shop constructed by using corrugated iron and sell informally. building=shop\n\nshop=convenience\n\nshop:convenience=spaza\n\nLesaka An enclosure for domestic animals usually constructed by rocks. barrier=wall\n\nwall=dry_stone\n\nLanguage\n\nLesotho has 2 official languages, Sotho (Sesotho or Southern Sotho) and English. It is also home to several other languages, including Phuthi, Xhosa and Zulu\n\nUse the following language codes when naming features\n\nEnglish - lang:en\n\nSesotho - lang:st\n\nPhuthi - lang:ss\n\nXhosa - lang:xh\n\nZulu - lang:zu\n\nRoad Network\n\nTagging schema for mapping the Lesotho road network is being done in accordance with Highway_Tag_Africa\n\nThe Classification is divided according to Urban and Rural areas. Code relates to the Lesotho route reference.\n\nCLASSIFICATION CODE DESCRIPTION URBAN RURAL Primary A The main artery connecting districts Yes Yes Secondary B Shorter roads, normally paved, and connecting towns within districts Yes Yes Tertiary C roads connecting villages from town centers Yes Yes Residential D roads within a residential area, connected to tertiary roads Yes Yes Unclassified D Roads connecting different Residential areas, they connect to Tertiary roads on the one end, and Residential roads on the other Yes Yes Path D Paths not large enough for cars, normally unpaved and mainly for pedestrians, both inside and outside residential areas. Yes Yes Track D The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have connecting function with other roads. No Yes\n\nAir\n\nThere are a total of 28 airports in Lesotho, of which 3 have paved runways.[2] The only international airport is the Moshoeshoe I International Airport in Mazenod, a short distance southeast from Maseru. The main runway of the Moshoeshoe Airport is the only one with a runway longer than 1,523 meters; it measures at 3,200 meters.\n\nOf the other airports, one has a paved runway between 914 and 1,523 meters in length and one a paved runway with a length of under 914 meters. Four of the airports have unpaved runways of between 914 and 1,523 meters in length, and the others have unpaved runways of less than 914 meters.[2] All of the classifications are made by the length of the longest runway on an airport.\n\nUseful Resources\n\nAs always, respect copyright & licences if they are applicable to any of the following\n\nOSM Related\n\nOSMStats - Daily, weekly & monthly stats for qty of people editing, nodes added, deleted & modified\n\nNew Mappers - Shows 2 day & 7 day markers for new people editing in the Lesotho area\n\nExternal To OSM"
