        "text": "Lesotho is one of the smallest countries in the world, with just over 30 000 km2 of land. It has a population of approximately two million. The country gained its independence from Britain on 4 October 1966. The day has become known as Lesothoâ€™s National Day and is celebrated yearly. Lesotho is the only country in the world that entirely lies above 1000 metres in elevation. It is also unique in being one of a few countries that are completely surrounded by another country. The Lesotho government is a constitutional monarchy.\n\nReferences\n\nInfoplease Lesotho[online] Available at:www.infoplease.com[Accessed on 13 September 2013]|\n\nAfrica Lesotho Its people, issues and history[online] Available at: https://africa.co.ls[Accessed on 13 September 2013]"
