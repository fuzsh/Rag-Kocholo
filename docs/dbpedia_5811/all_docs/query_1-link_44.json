        "text": "3.1 Position of international law in the legal system of Lesotho prior to independence\n\nLesotho was formerly known as Basutoland, named after a nation called the Basotho which occupied the territory during the 1800s. The Basotho nation was founded by Moshoeshoe who unified people from a number of clans who had come to him for protection having fled their homelands in the 1800s due to the invasion by Shaka Zulu and the boers. These conflicts drove most indigenous Southern African communities out of their homelands and forced them to seek refuge in Thaba-Bosiu where Moshoeshoe had established a fortress. Moshoeshoe subsequently gathered all those who had come to him for protection and founded the Basotho nation of whom he became King. His Kingdom became known as Basutoland (later named Lesotho).\n\nDuring the Great Trek, the boers left the Cape Colony. In the mid-1820s they crossed the Orange River into Moshoeshoe’s territory and allegedly requested from him a right to settle there. Moshoeshoe was of the opinion that he had lent the said territory to the boers but later they claimed to have rights over it. These divergent views about the ownership of land led to conflicts between the Basotho who occupied Basutoland and the boers who occupied territory in the current South Africa. The conflicts gave rise to a number of bilateral treaties between the two territories, thus bringing international law into play.\n\nThe first territorial treaty was signed between Moshoeshoe and Napier who represented Great Britain in 1843. According to this treaty the British recognised Basotho sovereignty over the land between the Orange and Caledon rivers. The boers, who had settled in some areas included in the 1843 treaty, did not recognise this description and continued their invasion and attempts to conquer more of Moshoeshoe’s land. In 1845 the territorial treaty was altered by Governor Maitland to legally recognise the boer settlement. The alteration of the 1843 treaty fuelled more conflict between the Basotho and the boers. The British ended up drawing new boundaries which separated the territories, this time leaving less land for Moshoeshoe. These boundaries became known as the Warden Line (named after the British Resident in Bloemfontein, Henry Warden). The Warden Line was not welcomed by Moshoeshoe and his people and a fierce conflict between the British and the Basotho ensued, resulting in the Battle of Viervoet in 1851 and another in 1852 in the Berea Plateau. The British were defeated in both battles. They then realised that the cost of maintaining sovereignty was too high and they signed the Sand River Convention in terms of which they handed over the disputed territory to the boers.\n\nUpon their takeover, the boers demanded land beyond the Caledon River, and named the new territory the Republic of the Orange Free State (Free State). The demand for more land ignited new feuds between the Basotho and the boers. The President of the Free State, Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff, declared war against the Basotho, resulting in the War of Senegal in March 1858 in which Moshoeshoe was almost defeated. After this war, an uneasy peace between the two territories followed, and in 1861 Moshoeshoe requested protection from Britain. Moshoeshoe’s request for Britain’s involvement in the conflict between himself and the boers also brought international law into the picture.\n\nIn 1865 the Free State launched heavy attacks against Moshoeshoe and his people. This conflict became known as the Seqiti War. By the late 1860s, Moshoeshoe and the Basotho people were exhausted and on the edge of famine as a result of these struggles. Their total defeat by the boers loomed. Moshoeshoe then renewed his entreaty for British protection and in March 1868 the Basotho Kingdom was declared a British protectorate. The boers discontinued the war and in February 1869, boundaries were agreed upon between Basutoland and the Republic of the Free State, now known as Lesotho and a province of South Africa respectively. These boundaries were drawn in the Convention of Aliwal North.\n\nThe above history reflects that from its foundation as a sovereign Kingdom and even when it had become a British protectorate, Lesotho’s relationship with its neighbour, South Africa, was governed by international law. The conflicts which Lesotho had with the British, as well as with the boers, resulted in the conclusion of several peace and boundary treaties. Moshoeshoe viewed the said international law as binding on him and his people. To date, the boundaries between Lesotho and South Africa remain as stipulated in the Aliwal North Convention. However, there is no literature suggesting that international law was applied to solve domestic disputes during Moshoeshoe’s reign. This situation could be influenced by several factors, such as the fact that during that time Moshoeshoe and his chiefs, who also acted as legislatures, focused more on stabilising their territories and solving territorial disputes than on internal disputes among their subjects. Another factor could be the effect of General Proclamation 2B of 1884 which dictated that domestic disputes were to be resolved by domestic laws.\n\nThe British handed the administration of Basutoland to the Cape legislature since it realised that due to non-ending conflicts, its administration would be expensive and not easy to handle. As far as the legal system was concerned, the High Commissioner issued General Law Proclamation 2B of 1884 (Proclamation) which made law that was applicable in the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope at the time to be equally applicable in Lesotho. The Proclamation reads as follows:\n\nIn all suits, actions or proceedings, civil or criminal, the law to be administered shall, as nearly as the circumstances of the country will permit, be the same as the law for the time being in force in the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope: Provided, however, that in any suits, actions, or proceedings in any court, to which all parties are Africans, and in all suits, outcomes or proceedings whatsoever before any Basotho courts, African law may be administered.\n\nThis Proclamation imported Roman-Dutch law and its legal traditions into Lesotho although it still left room for the application of African law (later known as Sesotho customary law). It created a dualist system which still applies today, in which Sesotho customary law operates side by side with the ‘received law’. Presumably, it is at this stage that the Roman-Dutch law traditions, including a dualist approach to international law, were imported into the legal system of Lesotho.\n\nDuring the time when Lesotho was its protectorate, the United Kingdom concluded international treaties and extended their application to Lesotho. At the same time the Cape passed proclamations which were meant to run the country. Proclamation 2B made no reference to international law nor to its status vis-à-vis other proclamations that were passed. However, an inference that can be drawn from its wording is that the status of international conventions in Lesotho during its protectorate days would be what obtained in the Cape Colony of Good Hope, which was dualism as influenced by the English legal system.\n\nAlthough it is argued in this article that the categorisation of Lesotho as dualist is mainly influenced by the British legal system, Killander and Adjolohoun warn that ‘the description of the English legal system as the epitome of dualism is arguably exaggerated’ for a number of reasons. First, customary international law formed and continues to form part of the law of the land in England as well as in many common law countries; second, ‘unincorporated treaties still play an increasingly important role, though the courts may not directly apply them’. This objection notwithstanding, it suffices to conclude that the dualist approach to international law in Lesotho became more evident when Lesotho became a British protectorate. Therefore, the English legal system as introduced by Proclamation 2B acts as a cradle for continued dualism in Lesotho.\n\n3.2. Position of international law in the legal system of Lesotho post-independence to the state of emergency (1966-1970)\n\nLesotho continued to be a British Protectorate until 1966 when it had its first democratic elections.\n\nThese elections were governed by the first Constitution, which came pursuant to a British Royal Decree in January 1965. The elections prepared Lesotho for independence from Britain, and on 4 October 1966 it gained independence. Following the 1965 elections and the attainment of independence the 1966 Constitution was adopted on the basis of the Independence Order of 1966 passed by the Parliament of Lesotho. It largely followed the British model except that it had a Bill of Rights, which was similar to the United States constitutional practice.\n\nThe 1966 Constitution did not make any provision for international law, but had a constitutional supremacy clause. That is, the international instruments to which Lesotho was a party would be applicable only to the extent that they did not contradict provisions of the Constitution.\n\nAs far as other laws which had been passed by the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope were concerned, the 1966 Constitution did not do away with these. They continued to operate. Some laws were slowly phased out and today some still form part of the laws of Lesotho. This status is highlighted by Palmer and Poulter as follows:\n\nThe newly independent state of Lesotho took over the existing laws that had previously been in force in Basutoland, though in future they were to be construed with any modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions required to bring them into conformity with the independence legislation, namely the Constitution.\n\nAs an acknowledgment of the relevance of international law to Lesotho as a new independent state, in the same month that it gained independence Lesotho ratified three conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). These conventions were later domesticated through the Labour Code Order 1992, which provides:\n\nNo provision of the Code or of rules and regulations made thereunder shall be interpreted or applied in such a way as to derogate from the provisions of any International Labour Convention which has entered into force for the Kingdom of Lesotho.\n\nLesotho also took cognisance of the fact that there were international treaties which the government of the United Kingdom had concluded on its behalf during the time when Lesotho was under British protection. However, Lesotho neither hastened to be bound immediately by these treaties, nor to discharge itself from their obligations altogether. It proposed a 24-month period, running from the date of independence, within which to review its position as regards these treaties. What was to happen to Lesotho’s treaty obligations in the interim during this review period was contained in a letter of 22 March 1967 written by the Prime Minister of Lesotho to the Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN). The letter, which is quoted verbatim in the judgment, reads as follows:\n\nYour Excellency\n\nThe government of the Kingdom of Lesotho is mindful of the desirability of maintenance, to the fullest extent compatible with the emergence into full independence of the Kingdom of Lesotho, [of] legal continuity between Lesotho and the several states with which, through the actions of the government of the United Kingdom, the country formerly known as Basutoland enjoyed treaty relations. Accordingly, the government of the Kingdom of Lesotho takes the present opportunity of making the following declarations:\n\n1 As regards bilateral treaties validly concluded by the government of the United Kingdom, on behalf of the country formerly known as Basutoland, or validly applied or extended by the said country to the country formerly known as Basutoland, the government of the Kingdom of Lesotho is willing to continue to apply within its territory on the basis of reciprocity, the terms of all such treaties for a period of twenty-four months from the date of independence (ie until October 4, 1968) unless abrogated by mutual consent. At the expiry of that period, the government of the Kingdom of Lesotho will regard such of these treaties which could not by application of customary international law be regarded as otherwise surviving, as having terminated.\n\n2 ...\n\n3 The government of the Kingdom of Lesotho is conscious that the above declaration applicable to bilateral treaties cannot with equal facility be applied to multilateral treaties. As regards these, therefore, the government of the Kingdom of Lesotho proposes to review each of them individually and to indicate to the depository in each case what steps it wishes to take in relation to each such instrument, whether by way of confirmation of termination or confirmation of succession or accession. During such interim period of review, any state party to a multilateral treaty which has, prior to independence been applied or extended to the country formally known as Basutoland, may, on the basis of reciprocity, rely as against Lesotho on the term of such treaty.\n\n4 It would be appreciated if your Excellency would arrange for the text of this declaration to be circulated amongst all members of the United Nations.\n\nPlease accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.\n\nSigned LEABUA JONATHAN (Prime Minister)\n\nThe implications of this letter for Lesotho’s international human rights obligations are discussed in more detail in the decision of the Privy Council, which at the time acted as Lesotho’s Appeal Court, in the case of Joe Molefi v Legal Advisors & Others. What is important to highlight from this letter is that from the time of independence, Lesotho was aware that being a party to international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral, carries with it certain obligations with which state parties are expected to comply. Hence, immediately upon entry into power the government took a stance as regards such obligations. The letter does not reflect a dualist approach to international law in which case the government would claim that in the absence of any domesticating laws any international instrument to which the British government was a party or made Basutoland a party would not be binding on the government of Lesotho.\n\nAfter the 24-month review period Lesotho continued to ratify international treaties, such as the four Geneva Conventions 1949, and the Convention of the Privileges and Immunities of the UN 1946. Some aspects of the Geneva Conventions have been domesticated in the Penal Code Act which criminalises grave breaches of international humanitarian law, including torture, committed as part of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Penal Code Act specifically makes reference to the Geneva Conventions.\n\n4.2 Courts’ application of international treaty law\n\nThe earliest case after independence in which the question of the application of international treaties in the courts of Lesotho was discussed is the case of Molefi. The appellant sought to be declared a refugee in terms of the UN Refugee Convention. The United Kingdom had ratified the Convention and extended its application to Lesotho during its protectorate days. One of the issues was whether the applicant could be declared a refugee under Lesotho law based on the definition of refugee contained in the UN Refugee Convention. The Court of Appeal (Privy Council) was confronted with the interpretation of section 38 of the Aliens Control Act 1966 in contrast to the UN Refugee Convention. It held that the letter written by the Prime Minister of Lesotho to the UN Secretary-General was a positive manifestation of the extent to which Lesotho intended to be bound by international instruments, including the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. It further held that on this ground the Appellant was a refugee as defined by the UN Refugee Convention. However, the petitioner’s circumstances did not fall within those contemplated in article 38 and, therefore, he could not be declared a refugee in terms of the Aliens Control Act. The Court held that the Refugee Convention was binding on Lesotho only because it had been transformed into the laws of Lesotho by virtue of section 38 of the Aliens Control Act.\n\nThe case of Mohollo Tšoenyane illustrates the theory of dualism in practice in that the High Court specifically held that whether bilateral or multilateral, in order for international agreements to be relied upon in domestic courts ‘they require adoption by domestic legislatures’. In another case, Basotho National Party & Another v Government of Lesotho and Others, in which the applicant sought an order directing the government of Lesotho to ‘adopt such legislative and other measures necessary to give effect to the rights recognised in international conventions’, the Court dismissed the application and stated that ‘these Conventions cannot form part of our law until and unless they are incorporated into municipal law by legislative enactment’. The Court emphasised:\n\nThe Court cannot usurp the functions assigned the executive and the legislature under the Constitution and it cannot even indirectly require the executive to indirectly introduce a particular legislation or the legislature to pass it or assume itself a supervisory function over the law-making activities of the executive and the legislature.\n\nThe refusal by the courts to apply international human rights instruments in the cases of Tšoeunyane and BNP is evidence of a strict dualist approach to international law during Lesotho’s early years of democracy. A similar approach is seen later, in 2013, in the case of Masupha. This case was lodged by the daughter of a late principal chief. She sought an order declaring section 10 of the Chieftainship Act 1968, on the basis of which succession to office of chief is limited to first-born male children, discriminatory and, therefore, unconstitutional. Among instruments cited to advance the arguments that Lesotho had an obligation not to discriminate on the basis of sex were ICCPR, CEDAW, the African Charter and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (African Women’s Protocol). However, the Court held:\n\nThese instruments, it is clear, are aids to interpretation not the source of rights enforceable by Lesotho citizens. In the present matter, there’s no aspect of the process of interpreting section 10 of the [Chieftainship] Act, which leaves its meaning exposed to any uncertainty, to the resolution of which the instruments in question could contribute further than the considerations, which have already been taken into account.\n\nThe Court did not rule out international instruments as completely irrelevant to the inquiry, but stated that they could be helpful only as interpretative guides if there was uncertainty in the interpretation of section 10 of the Chieftainship Act. By holding that international human rights instruments to which Lesotho is a party are ‘not the sources of rights enforceable by Lesotho citizens’, the Court exonerated the state from its international human rights obligations in the absence of an Act of Parliament. That is, despite its being blatantly discriminatory, the Chieftainship Act was upheld and not tested against international human rights standards against discrimination. In the context of this article it may be concluded that the Court erred as it did not take into account the fact that non-discrimination on the basis of sex is an established principle of customary international law which binds all states even in the absence of ratification of an international human rights treaty that outlaws discrimination.\n\nPrior to the BNP and Masupha cases, the High Court of Lesotho, in the cases of Sello v Commissioner of Police & Others and Law Society of Lesotho v Right Honourable Prime Minister had approached human rights cases in a more pragmatic manner. The case of Sello was an application of habeas corpus for production in court of a woman who had been detained under the Internal Security Act (General) 1984 for more than 20 days without access to any visitors. The Court held that while the Internal Security Act authorised such an arrest, the Act should be interpreted bearing in mind the rights of individuals, and further held that it ‘may it also be remembered that this Kingdom is a signatory to the Declaration of Human Rights Charter’ (sic). The Court implied that the rights of the individual as contained in international human rights instruments should be given preference over a domestic law where such law authorises the violation of such rights.\n\nThe case of Law Society of Lesotho v Right Honourable Prime Minister involved the independence of the judiciary in which a former officer of the Attorney-General’s office and Director of Public Prosecutions had been appointed as an acting judge. The Court was called upon to interpret the Human Rights Act of 1983, which has since been repealed by the 1993 Constitution. In its interpretation of the Human Rights Act, the Court of Appeal relied on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Universal Declaration) and the extent to which it had influenced the Human Rights Act. The Court concluded that the interpretation of the Human Rights Act should be done in accordance with international human rights law. It reiterated the role that international law played in shaping the national legal framework, including the Human Rights Act. The reminder that the Human Rights Act was anchored in international human rights law thus reflects the Court’s willingness to align its interpretation with what obtains in the realm of international law.\n\nIn the case of Sole the Court had to determine whether the right to legal representation as contained in section 12 of the 1993 Constitution could be extended to include an accused person’s right to be represented in a criminal trial by a former Director of Public Prosecutions who had been involved on behalf of the state in the investigations leading to his charge. The Court referred to a number of cases from different jurisdictions in the Commonwealth, namely, South Africa, as well as to the European Court of Human Rights, and to a number of international treaties such as ICCPR, the African Charter, the European Convention and the Inter-American Convention. The Court found the dicta of the European Court ‘instructive’. It considered all arguments and the relevant instruments, and ultimately drew inspiration from a judgment by the European Court. That is, although the Court did not hold that Lesotho has obligations under the European Convention, it used jurisprudence of the European Court, which forms part of international law, to justify its own decision that the right to legal representation is not an absolute right.\n\nIn the case of Lesotho Revenue Authority v Master of the High Court & Others, the Court held that in interpreting the national laws, as well as the Constitution, a fair balance between the public interest and the rights of the individual has to be established. The Court borrowed the principle of fair balance from article 1 of the European Convention, which had been used by Ackermann JA in the South African case of First National Bank and Another v Commissioner of South African Revenue Services & Others. Although the Court’s use of the principle of fair balance was not a departure from dualism as it was used to justify the Court’s own interpretation of the Constitution, this approach, however, is illustrative of the role that the rights of individuals play in the interpretation of national laws, regardless of the source of such rights.\n\nIn cases involving the rights of children, the courts have not flinched from considering CRC and African Children’s Charter where the best interests of the child principle is employed. The courts’ justification in such instances could be the fact that the Children’s Protection and Welfare Act (CPWA) 2011 incorporates the said conventions in the following words:\n\nThe objects of this Act are to extend, promote and protect the rights of children as defined in the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 1990 African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and other international instruments, protocols, standards and rules on the protection and welfare of children to which Lesotho is a signatory.\n\nThe case of Malefetsane Mohlomi was a review of a criminal trial of two accused persons aged 16 and 17 years who had been convicted, together with two adults, for a contravention of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The Court held that because the 16 and 17 year-olds were children as defined in the CPWA, they ought not to have been tried together with the two adults. It held further that the joint trial was a violation of their rights and ordered a fresh trial which took into account the best interests of the child principle as expounded in CRC and the African Children’s Charter.\n\nA similar approach regarding the applicability of the African Charter and CRC was adopted in the cases of Mapetla v Leboela and L v M, which dealt with the custody of minor children. In the former case the Court specifically held that the international law principle of best interests of the child was particularly relevant in the courts of Lesotho because of section 4 of the Children's Protection and Welfare Act 2011, which reiterates the said principle. In the latter case the Court of Appeal held that the High Court had erred by ignoring arguments based on CRC and the African Children’s Charter as these international instruments were ‘authoritative since Lesotho had ratified them in March 1992 and November 1992 respectively’.\n\nIn a similar manner, conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) are applied with ease by both the Labour Court and the Labour Appeal Court because of section 2 of the Labour Code Order 1992, which provides:\n\nIn cases of ambiguity, provisions of the Code shall be interpreted in such a way as more closely conforms with the provisions of conventions adopted by the conference of the ILO and of recommendations adopted by it.\n\nThe above cases reflect the courts’ move from relying exclusively on domestic laws when dealing with human rights to incorporating Lesotho’s international human rights obligations in their interpretation. While this move does not contradict the theory of dualism, the cases mark a starting point from which the courts then took a further step and made pronouncements in which they regarded international instruments as sources of rights for the people of Lesotho. The cases in which this paradigm shift is illustrated include the case of Judicial Officers of Lesotho & Another v the Right Honourable Prime Minster & Another in which magistrates sought an order declaring Rule 16 of the Judicial Commission Rules, as well as the government directive which assigned magistrate’s courts to District Administrators, unlawful and contrary to the principle of separation of powers. The Court held that besides section 118 of the Constitution ‘Lesotho is also a party to ICCPR, the African Charter and Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which all impose on state parties, the duty to guarantee independence of the courts’.\n\nSimilarly, in Moosa & Others v Magistrate Ntlhakana & Others the Court took cognisance of the fact that ‘Lesotho has signed the African Union Convention on the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (sic) regarding the rights of citizens’. Makhasane was a trial for damages arising out of unlawful arrest and detention, as well as verbal and physical abuse. In determining the amount of damages, the Court took into account the fact that the ‘African Charter protects a number of civil and political rights, including the right to dignity’, and held that such rights had been infringed by the police who unlawfully arrested and detained the complainant.\n\nThe Makhasane case illustrates the shift even more clearly in that the Constitution of Lesotho does not provide specifically for the right to dignity. Therefore, in finding that the plaintiffs’ right to dignity had been violated the Court relied on article 5 of the African Charter. Similarly, when making reference to the right to freedom from torture, the Court of Appeal of Lesotho in the case of Makotoko Lerotholi & Others v Director of Public Prosecutions held:\n\nEven the police are mandated by the law as well the provisions of international laws and conventions regarding the rights of suspects to which this country is signatory, to treat suspects humanely and in accordance with the law ... the suspects are equally entitled to a fair, human and just treatment in keeping with domestic and international law.\n\nThe most celebrated cases in which the courts’ pronouncements on international law were very clear are the cases of Molefi Tšepe and Fuma. These decisions are celebrated not only because of their contribution to the enforcement of the rights of women and people with disabilities, respectively, but also because of the courts’ bold and extensive interpretation of Lesotho’s international obligations as contained in the international human rights instruments. In the Tšepe case the applicant, a male local government elections candidate, sought an order declaring the reservation of a one-third quota of all local government seats for women under the Local Government Elections Act 1998 (as amended by an Amendment Act of 2005) to be discriminatory and unconstitutional. Relying on articles 3 and 26 of ICCPR, HRC General Comment 18, articles 3 and 4 of CEDAW, articles 18(3) and (4) of the African Charter, as well as the SADC Declaration on Gender Equality, the Court held that the Amendment Act was not discriminatory but constituted an affirmative action measure which Lesotho had an international human rights obligation to observe. The Court stated:\n\nIf regard be had to Lesotho’s international law obligations, these, if anything, reinforce the interpretation of section 18(4)(e) of the Constitution and require equality, which is substantive and not merely formal and restitutionary in its reach.\n\nThe Fuma case was lodged by a member of the Lesotho Defence Force (LDF) who had been forced to retire in terms of section 24 of the LDF Act on the grounds that he was legally blind because of an HIV infection, among others. He challenged the decision of the LDF to retire him as discriminatory as there was an option of giving him lighter duties which befitted his condition - as had been done with other visually-impaired army officers. He argued that his HIV status was the only factor on which the decision to retire him was based. In deciding in his favour the Court held:\n\nThe unreservedly ratified United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities stands not only as an aspirational instrument in the matter, but that by default, it technically assumes the effect of municipal law in the country.\n\nHaving considered the relevant provisions of CRPD, the Court went further to hold that ‘[t]he [CRPD] stands not only as an inspirational instrument in the matter but that by default it technically assumes the effect of the municipal law in the country’. The Court found a violation of sections 18 and 19 of the Constitution of Lesotho, which it held had to be interpreted so as not to contradict with Lesotho’s obligations under CRPD.\n\nAs illustrated above, in the majority of cases the courts were persuaded by the international instruments and were satisfied by the fact that Lesotho had ratified such instruments and, therefore, was bound to act as mandated thereby. The courts raised no issues about whether the relevant treaties had been domesticated or not. This stance notwithstanding, one other visible trend in Lesotho courts is the limited application of international human rights instruments adopted under the auspices of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the African Union (AU). The majority of cases in which international treaties were referred to were continental treaties, and in very few cases treaties that had been adopted at the regional level were referred to or used as interpretative guides."
