        "text": "World Facts Index\n\nBasutoland was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho upon independence from the UK in 1966. The Basuto National Party ruled for the first two decades. King MOSHOESHOE was exiled in 1990, but returned to Lesotho in 1992 and was reinstated in 1995. Constitutional government was restored in 1993 after seven years of military rule. In 1998, violent protests and a military mutiny following a contentious election prompted a brief but bloody intervention by South African and Botswanan military forces under the aegis of the Southern African Development Community. Subsequent constitutional reforms restored relative political stability. Peaceful parliamentary elections were held in 2002, but the National Assembly elections of February 2007 were hotly contested and aggrieved parties continue to periodically demonstrate their distrust of the results.\n\nGeography of Lesotho\n\nLocation:\n\nSouthern Africa, an enclave of South Africa\n\nCoordinates:\n\n29 30 S, 28 30 E\n\nArea:\n\ntotal: 30,355 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\nland: 30,355 sq km\n\nArea comparative:\n\nslightly smaller than Maryland\n\nLand boundaries:\n\ntotal: 909 km\n\nborder countries: South Africa 909 km\n\nCoastline:\n\n0 km (landlocked)\n\nClimate:\n\ntemperate; cool to cold, dry winters; hot, wet summers\n\nTerrain:\n\nmostly highland with plateaus, hills, and mountains\n\nElevation extremes:\n\nlowest point: junction of the Orange and Makhaleng Rivers 1,400 m\n\nhighest point: Thabana Ntlenyana 3,482 m\n\nNatural resources:\n\nwater, agricultural and grazing land, some diamonds and other minerals\n\nNatural hazards:\n\nperiodic droughts\n\nEnvironment current issues:\n\npopulation pressure forcing settlement in marginal areas results in overgrazing, severe soil erosion, and soil exhaustion; desertification; Highlands Water Project controls, stores, and redirects water to South Africa\n\nGeography - note:\n\nlandlocked, completely surrounded by South Africa; mountainous, more than 80% of the country is 1,800 meters above sea level\n\nPopulation of Lesotho\n\nPopulation:\n\n2,128,180 (July 2008 est.)\n\nAge structure:\n\n0-14 years: 36.8% (male 374,102/female 369,527)\n\n15-64 years: 58.3% (male 572,957/female 606,846)\n\n65 years and over: 4.9% (male 39,461/female 59,438)\n\nMedian age:\n\n20.3 years\n\nGrowth rate:\n\n-0.46%\n\nInfant mortality:\n\n87.24 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nLife expectancy at birth:\n\ntotal population: 34.4 years\n\nmale: 35.55 years\n\nfemale: 33.21 years\n\nFertility rate:\n\n3.28 children born/woman\n\nNationality:\n\nnoun: Mosotho (singular), Basotho (plural)\n\nadjective: Basotho\n\nEthnic groups:\n\nSotho 99.7%, Europeans, Asians, and other 0.3%,\n\nReligions:\n\nChristian 80%, indigenous beliefs 20%\n\nLanguages:\n\nSesotho (southern Sotho), English (official), Zulu, Xhosa\n\nLiteracy:\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 84.8%\n\nmale: 74.5%\n\nfemale: 94.5% (2003 est.)\n\nGovernment\n\nCountry name:\n\nconventional long form: Kingdom of Lesotho\n\nformer: Basutoland\n\nGovernment type:\n\nparliamentary constitutional monarchy\n\nCapital:\n\nMaseru\n\nAdministrative divisions:\n\n10 districts; Berea, Butha-Buthe, Leribe, Mafeteng, Maseru, Mohale's Hoek, Mokhotlong, Qacha's Nek, Quthing, Thaba-Tseka\n\nIndependence:\n\n4 October 1966 (from UK)\n\nNational holiday:\n\nIndependence Day, 4 October (1966)\n\nConstitution:\n\n2 April 1993\n\nLegal system:\n\nbased on English common law and Roman-Dutch law; judicial review of legislative acts in High Court and Court of Appeal; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction\n\nSuffrage:\n\n18 years of age; universal\n\nExecutive branch:\n\nchief of state: King LETSIE III (since 7 February 1996); note - King LETSIE III formerly occupied the throne from November 1990 to February 1995 while his father was in exile\n\nhead of government: Prime Minister Pakalitha MOSISILI (since 23 May 1998)\n\ncabinet: Cabinet\n\nelections: according to the constitution, the leader of the majority party in the Assembly automatically becomes prime minister; the monarch is hereditary, but, under the terms of the constitution that came into effect after the March 1993 election, the monarch is a \"living symbol of national unity\" with no executive or legislative powers; under traditional law the college of chiefs has the power to depose the monarch, determine who is next in the line of succession, or who shall serve as regent in the event that the successor is not of mature age.\n\nLegislative branch:\n\nbicameral Parliament consists of the Senate (33 members - 22 principal chiefs and 11 other members appointed by the ruling party) and the Assembly (120 seats, 80 by direct popular vote and 40 by proportional vote; members elected by popular vote for five-year terms); note - number of seats in the Assembly rose from 80 to 120 in the May 2002 election\n\nJudicial branch:\n\nHigh Court (chief justice appointed by the monarch); Court of Appeal; Magistrate's Court; customary or traditional court\n\nEconomy\n\nSmall, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho relies on remittances from miners employed in South Africa and customs duties from the Southern Africa Customs Union for the majority of government revenue. However, the government has recently strengthened its tax system to reduce dependency on customs duties. Completion of a major hydropower facility in January 1998 permitted the sale of water to South Africa and generated royalties for Lesotho. Lesotho produces about 90% of its own electrical power needs. As the number of mineworkers has declined steadily over the past several years, a small manufacturing base has developed based on farm products that support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries, as well as a rapidly expanding apparel-assembly sector. The latter has grown significantly mainly due to Lesotho qualifying for the trade benefits contained in the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. The economy is still primarily based on subsistence agriculture, especially livestock, although drought has decreased agricultural activity. The extreme inequality in the distribution of income remains a major drawback. Lesotho has signed an Interim Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the IMF. In July 2007, Lesotho signed a Millennium Challenge Account Compact with the US worth $362.5 million.\n\nGDP:\n\n$3.063 billion (2007 est.)\n\nGDP growth rate:\n\n0.8%\n\nGDP per capita:\n\n$2,500\n\nGDP composition by sector:\n\nagriculture: 16.3%\n\nindustry: 44.3%\n\nservices: 39.4%\n\nInflation rate:\n\n4.7%\n\nLabor force:\n\n838,000\n\nLabor force - by occupation:\n\n86% of resident population engaged in subsistence agriculture; roughly 35% of the active male wage earners work in South Africa\n\nUnemployment:\n\n45%\n\nIndustries:\n\nfood, beverages, textiles, apparel assembly, handicrafts; construction; tourism\n\nAgriculture:\n\ncorn, wheat, pulses, sorghum, barley; livestock\n\nExports:\n\nmanufactures 75% (clothing, footwear, road vehicles), wool and mohair, food and live animals (2000)\n\nExport partners:\n\nHong Kong 43%, China 23.4%, India 5.5%, South Korea 5.1%, Germany 4.4%\n\nImports:\n\nfood; building materials, vehicles, machinery, medicines, petroleum products\n\nImport partners:\n\nUS 97%, Canada 2.1%, UK 0.3%\n\nCurrency:\n\nloti (LSL); South African rand (ZAR)\n\nSOURCES: The CIA World Factbook, U.S. Department of State, Area Handbook of the US Library of Congress"
