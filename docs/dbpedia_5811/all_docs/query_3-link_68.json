        "text": "Lesotho’s media landscape is very polarised and characterised by a lack of independence. The country has ten weekly newspapers (nine privately owned, one state-owned) but remains one of the only countries on the continent with no daily newspaper. The broadcasting sector has gradually opened up since 1997 and now has 26 radio stations – two of which are state-owned stations and six community stations – as well as the public TV broadcaster created in 1988. The state media are still largely controlled by the government and politicians. Online news continues to be relatively free of constraints, but Internet access is limited because of the lack of infrastructure and the cost of a connection.\n\nJournalists are often the targets of intimidation campaigns, and investigative reporting on the activities of politicians is difficult. A state-owned newspaper was closed on a minister’s orders for daring to feature the leader of the opposition on its front page. Self-censorship is widespread and some journalists have chosen to go into exile, particularly to South Africa, to escape it.\n\nLesotho decriminalised defamation in 2018 and adopted a new media law in 2021 that improved their legal framework and access to information. However, it did not repeal the many other laws that can still be used to undermine journalism. The law on access to information, the first version of which dates back to 2000, was never adopted.\n\nPressure against journalists has intensified in recent years, often driving them to self-censorship. They are often victims of intimidation campaigns and threats on social media, and physical attacks are not uncommon. At the end of 2021, there were several very violent attacks perpetrated by the police. Investigative reporter Ralikonelo Joki’s murder by unidentified men in May 2023 sent a new, chilling message regarding the safety of journalists in the country."
