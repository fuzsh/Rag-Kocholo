CDC also helps strengthen local workforce capacities for effective coordination of laboratory programs to improve the quality of services like testing and sample transportation.\n\nEmergency response\n\nCDC's longstanding partnerships and investments in laboratory systems and disease surveillance enabled Lesotho to leverage existing infrastructure to respond to COVID-19 and other health threats. In response to COVID-19, CDC continues to support Lesotho to ensure equitable access and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, disease surveillance, and outbreak control, and robust reporting of COVID-19 cases to information systems.\n\nCDC also collaborated with WHO to provide technical guidance on the rational use of personal protective equipment and development of IPC training.\n\nKey achievements"
