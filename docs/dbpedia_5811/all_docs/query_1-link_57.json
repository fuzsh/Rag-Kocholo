        "text": "What Happened On This Day – October 4\n\n1992 End of the Mozambican Civil War\n\nThe 15-year long civil war was fought between the Mozambique Resistance Movement and the Mozambican government. The conflict, which began in 1977, just a couple of years after the War of Independence against the Portuguese, resulted in massive losses of human life and property. The civil war ended with the signing of the Rome General Peace Accords by both of the warring parties.\n\n1966 Lesotho independence\n\nLesotho gained independence from British rule.\n\n1957 World's first artificial satellite launched\n\nThe Soviet Union launched the Sputnik from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Baikonur Cosmodrome is the world’s oldest and largest space launch facility still in operation. The successful launch of Sputnik spurred the Space Race – a race between Cold War rivals USSR and US to gain supremacy in spaceflight.\n\n1895 First US Open for Golf\n\nThe now annual event was played at the Newport Country Club in Newport, Rhode Island, for the first time. 11 people played the 36-hole competition in a single day. Horace Rawlins, a 21-year old Englishman won the tournament and took home a trophy and $150 cash.\n\n1582 Last day of the Julian Calendar in Catholic countries\n\nThe next day, the Gregorian calendar took effect in Italy, Poland, Portugal, and Spain by the order of Pope Gregory XIII. The calendar was put in place to realign events like equinoxes and solstices with the calendar, ensuring that Easter is always celebrated around the Northern Hemisphere's spring equinox. Because of the new calendar, several days were skipped, and October 4 was followed by October 15. Today, the Gregorian calendar is the most used calendar around the world.\n\nBirths On This Day,\n\nOctober 4\n\n1988 Derrick Rose\n\nAmerican basketball player\n\n1973 Abyss\n\nAmerican wrestler\n\n1946 Chuck Hagel\n\nAmerican politician\n\n1895 Buster Keaton\n\nAmerican actor, director, producer\n\n1822 Rutherford B. Hayes\n\nAmerican politician, 19th President of the United States\n\nDeaths On This Day,\n\nOctober 4\n\n1982 Glenn Gould\n\nCanadian pianist, composer\n\n1974 Anne Sexton\n\nAmerican poet\n\n1970 Janis Joplin\n\nAmerican singer-songwriter\n\n1951 Henrietta Lacks\n\nAmerican patient, HeLa cells derived from her cervical cancer\n\n1669 Rembrandt\n\nDutch painter"
