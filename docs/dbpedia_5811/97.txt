1 Establishment of Kingdom of Lesotho. U.K.

On 4th October 1966 (in this Act referred to as “the appointed day”) the territory which immediately before that day constitutes the Colony of Basutoland shall cease to form part of Her Majesty’s dominions and shall become an independent kingdom under the name of Lesotho.

2 Operation of existing law. U.K.

(1)Subject to the following provisions of this Act, on and after the appointed day all law which, whether being a rule of law or a provision of an Act of Parliament or of any other enactment or instrument whatsoever, is in force on that day or has been passed or made before that day and comes into force thereafter, shall, unless and until provision to the contrary is made by Parliament or some other authority having power in that behalf, have the same operation in relation to Lesotho, and persons and things belonging to or connected with Lesotho, as it would have apart from this subsection if on the appointed day Basutoland has been renamed Lesotho but there had been no change in its status.

(2)Part I of the Schedule to this Act (which relates to enactments applicable to Commonwealth countries having fully responsible status) and Part II of that Schedule (which relates to enactments excepted from the operation of the preceding subsection) shall have effect on and after the appointed day in relation to the enactments therein mentioned; but that Schedule shall not extend to Lesotho as part of its law.

(3)Subsection (1) of this section applies to law of, or of any part of, the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and, in relation only to any enactment of the Parliament of the United Kingdom or any Order in Council made by virtue of any such enactment whereby any such enactment applies in relation to Basutoland, to law of any other country or territory to which that enactment or Order extends.

(4)For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that nothing in this section is to be construed as continuing in force any enactment or rule of law which would limit or restrict the legislative powers of Lesotho.
