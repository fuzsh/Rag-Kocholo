Other than another "Scream" installment, January was a bit of a dud when it came to new movies. But now we're in February, where things are looking up with the moon falling on us and clown prince of chaos Johnny Knoxville again doling out testicular trauma for laughs.

This weekend, Halle Berry and Patrick Wilson are astronauts trying to prevent a global catastrophe in "Independence Day" director Roland Emmerich's latest sci-fi disaster movie, while Knoxville, Steve-O and the "Jackass" gang embrace nutty stunts and injurious shenanigans for their latest big-screen project.

Here's a guide to new movies that'll satisfy every cinematic taste, plus some noteworthy theatrical films making their debut on video-on-demand platforms and streaming services:

If you dig out-there space tales: 'Moonfall'

This sci-fi action flick proves yet again that no one can pulverize civilization like Emmerich. John Bradley ("Game of Thrones") enters the goofy disaster spectacle as scientist/conspiracy theorist KC, who tries to warn people that the moon is out of orbit, and only disgraced astronaut Brian (Wilson) will believe him. Brian needs to hug it out with estranged NASA honcho Jo (Berry), and the trio launches to the moon to save the world as all hell breaks loose on Earth. It's no "Independence Day," but kudos for the over-the-top depictions of rampant global destruction and one far-out, mind-exploding finale.

If you find people doing ridiculously stupid things appealing: 'Jackass Forever'

After the last two years, there is something to be said for watching a bunch of friends get together and laugh a lot – even when they're hitting each other in the ding-dong and one of them is named "Poopies." Knoxville and Co. have been inflicting painful practical jokes on each other for more than two decades and the stunts have just gotten crazier (or dumber, depending on your taste for these hijinks). The cameos are fun, bruised private parts are plentiful, you'll probably wince at least a few times, but you'll never let a vulture near your crotch ever again.

Johnny Knoxville: Your 'Jackass Forever' questions answered

If you like romantic comedies: 'Book of Love'

Get the Valentine's Day preparation started with this predictable albeit still enjoyable tale. Sam Claflin is an uptight British author whose writing is chaste and book sales are nonexistent until he finds out his novel has become a phenomenon in Mexico. He's sent there for a book tour with his Spanish-language translator (Verónica Echegui), whom he's horrified to learn has rewritten his prose as a sexy, saucy, telenovela-ish work. The two bicker yet (of course) grow close as both bring out new sides of the other.

If you don't like romantic comedies: 'The Worst Person in the World'

Norwegian director Joachim Trier demolishes all the rom-com genre's tropes and Renate Reinsve gives a standout performance in the melancholic and engaging film as a young woman equally indecisive with careers and her love life. She first falls for an older, hotheaded comic-book artist (Anders Danielsen Lie) and later for a kind yet also involved barista (Herbert Nordrum). The movie navigates her travails and self-sabotage through various episodes, even utilizing a fantastical bent – like dancing through time-frozen streets – to further innovate in the funny and heartbreaking narrative about finding love. Enjoy it now before the inevitable American remake starring Dakota Johnson.

If you love period supernatural stories: 'Ghosts of the Ozarks'

There's mystery and intrigue afoot in post-Civil War Arkansas in this indie thriller, starring Thomas Hobson as a young Black doctor recruited by his uncle to be the physician of a Southern mining town, a seemingly utopian place walled off from mysterious, murderous creatures that roam the nearby forest. "Ozarks" screenwriter (and "Fresh Beat Band" alum) Tara Perry co-stars as a goodhearted local who helps the newcomer, and the supporting cast features David Arquette as an eccentric haberdasher/photographer and Tim Blake Nelson as a blind bartender who's key to the town's dark history.

If you feel like being freaked out: 'Alone With You'

A romantic homecoming gives way to claustrophobic creeps in this horror film about a woman (Emily Bennett, who also co-writes and co-directs) who, when anxiously awaiting the return of her girlfriend (Emma Myles), gets trapped in their apartment and begins to experience eerie visions and sounds around the place and at home and on a video call with her overbearing mom (Barbara Crampton). The solid thriller winds up in some dark places, though the best part is the ride getting there, with nonstop tension and an impressively unnerving sense of doom.

Where to watch: In theaters (and on VOD Tuesday)

If you could use a brain-bendy fable: 'The Other Me'

While pretty normal compared to your average "Twin Peaks" episode, this drama executive produced by David Lynch falls squarely in his interestingly deep, oddball wheelhouse. Jim Sturgess plays an aspiring architect diagnosed with an eye disease that's gradually blinding him, though his condition opens up a virtual world where he connects with a mysterious artist (Andreja Pejic), rethinks the rocky relationship with his wife (Antonia Campbell-Hughes) and comes to grips with his identity.

Also on streaming

Those who missed seeing Lady Gaga in theaters strutting her stuff to another possible Oscar nomination can check out the very soapy historical drama "House of Gucci" on Apple TV and VOD platforms now (and Blu-ray/DVD come Feb. 22 if you're old school).

Guillermo del Toro's psychological thriller "Nightmare Alley," a new version of the noir tale starring Bradley Cooper as an ambitious carny and Cate Blanchett as a ruthless femme fatale, is streaming on Hulu and HBO Max.

And with the Super Bowl approaching, now's a good time to check out the faith-based football biopic "American Underdog" – with Zachary Levi playing NFL hall of famer Kurt Warner – as it hits VOD.
