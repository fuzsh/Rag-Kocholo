They are the sons of Statler Brothers members Harold and Don Reid. (Photo submitted)\n\nBy J.J. KINDRED\n\nJ.Kindred@theknoxvillejournal.com\n\nDon't confuse the name Wilson Fairchild as the name of an individual recording artist.\n\nWhat is perceived as a solo artist is actually the name of a duo who are actually cousins, with a relationship as if they were brothers.\n\nWil and Langdon Reid have performed together for more than 15 years. It also helps that they come from a musical legacy, being the sons of Harold and Don Reid, members of the legendary Statler Brothers.\n\nWil and Langdon Reid have had more than 30 songs published and recorded as songwriters, with their most recent success coming with their song co-written with award-winning songwriter Gordon Kennedy, \"Make God First,\" recorded by Ricky Skaggs. It was recorded for Skaggs' \"Mosaic\" album, and nominated for a Grammy.\n\nThe duo is also very versatile in that they can play many different instruments.\n\nOriginally called Grandstaff, under which they recorded several albums, the duo changed their name to Wilson Fairchild last year, coming from Wilson as Wil Reid's middle name and Fairchild as Langdon Reid's middle name.\n\nWhen the Statler Brothers were inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2007, the duo was asked to be a part of the ceremony by singing a song to them, \"The Statler Brothers Song,\" in which they wrote to dedicate their own success to the group and their fathers. The following year, the Statlers were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and again the duo was asked to be a part of the ceremony.\n\nWilson Fairchild continues to perform all over the country, and have heavily toured with country music legend George Jones.\n\nWil Reid took time to conduct a telephone interview with The Knoxville Journal to talk about the duo's success.\n\nThe Knoxville Journal: Who were some of your influences?\n\nWil Reid: Obviously our dads who were part of The Statler Brothers. Their music always influenced us. We loved George Jones, Merle Haggard, we loved all the decades in country music.\n\nTKJ: With all those artists you grew up with, do you try to incorporate anyone's style?\n\nWR: We have our own style. We have tried to be like our dads, but we go to our own sound.\n\nTKJ: What kind of message do you try to send through your music?\n\nWR: The message we send is probably a reflection of our lives and our lifestyles. We are both in our 30s and we both have kids. Family is very important to us. In the songs, it is a reflection of the way we live. We're not rock stars, but we certainly don't act like country stars.\n\nTKJ: What's it been like to tour with George Jones?\n\nWR: It's been great. A year or more ago we met with him and we saw a connection. George had performed in Virginia and I did everything I could to beg and plead to get on the tour with him. We got a phone call and had a chance to meet the people that work for him. I have so much admiration and respect for him and what he did for country music. It reminded us of when our dads were on tour, and we wanted to be a part of it.\n\nTKJ: Lastly, what can people expect from your part of the show?\n\nWR: They should expect some laughs, because I only want people laughing because there's something funny. We do some older country music and do some music that celebrates the Statlers' heritage. We are definitely going to get people warmed up for George Jones when he comes out, and that they'll be ready for him."
