        "meta_description": "The Everly Brothers Park is the newest addition to the City of Knoxville's Parks and a great addition to the Bearden neighborhood. This beautiful passive park is the only commemorative park in the United States to honor rock-and-roll duo Don and Phil Everly. Don and Phil moved with their family to Knoxville in 1953 and attended West High School. Performing as a duo, the brothers appeared on the Cas Walker Farm and Home Hour radio show on WROL-AM. In 1955, Chet Atkins, manager of RCA Victor's studio in Nashville offered to help them with their recording career. The Everly Brothers, along with musical pioneers Buddy Holly, Elvis, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry ushered in the early years of rock and roll. Some of their best-loved tunes include “All I Have to Do is Dream”, “Cathy’s Clown”, and “Wake Up Little Susie”. The pocket park connects to the Bearden Village Greenway at the corner of Kingston Pike and Forest Park Boulevard. Enjoy a stroll with inlaid plaques featuring signatures and quotes from famous musicians on the impact the Everly Brothers has on both their careers and rock music around the world. Artists include Graham Nash of Crosby, Stills, &amp; Nash, Paul McCartney of The Beatles, Paul Simon &amp; Art Garfunkel, Carole, King, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, Joan Baez, and Bob Dylan. \"The Everly Brothers still remain unsurpassed in bringing their traditional brotherly harmonies into early rock and roll - musical heroes of the highest order. They played a big part in inspiring most everybody who heard and wanted to play music.\" —Bob Dylan \"Phil Everly was one of my great heroes, and with his brother Don, they were one of the major influences on The Beatles. When John and I first started to write songs, I was Phil and he was Don.\" —Paul McCartney \"The Everly Brothers' impact exceeds even their fame; they were a big influence on Simon and Garfunkel. Phil and Don were the most beautiful sounding duo I ever heard. The Everlys were part of the birth of rock and roll.\" —Paul Simon",
