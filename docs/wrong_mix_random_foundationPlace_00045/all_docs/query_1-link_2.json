        "text": "Mrs. Downtown and I spent this past Saturday afternoon roaming the bustling streets of Knoxville to take in the sights and smells of the Dogwood Arts Festival and enjoy the local atmosphere. Our first stop, though, opened us up to some blossoming international flair going on downtown.\n\nWe started our roaming at The French Market Creperie to enjoy some savory crepes and chocolate croissants. The business recently moved from Gay Street to 412 Clinch Ave. The move allowed the owners to increase their space and double down on their “you might be in Paris” theme.\n\nThe move also puts them very near Kaizen, the “izakaya”-style Japanese pub at 416 Clinch, and just a short hop around the corner from Yassin’s Falafel House, at the corner of Church and Walnut. I’m about ready to declare this downtown’s “International Dining District.” Mrs. Downtown is always hoping for an Indian restaurant to pop up in the Central Business District. Maybe such a spot could make for a quorum of around-the-world tastes in the future.\n\nWe wandered from there through the Dogwood Arts Festival booths and such on Market Square, picked up some summer clothes at Mast General Store, and did the sidewalk cafe thing at Sugar Mama’s on Gay Street for a while. Lots of other folks had the same idea. Downtown was hopping.\n\nI spent a similar weekday afternoon in Nashville back in March. I hauled it over the plateau for a Flaming Lips concert at the War Memorial Auditorium, an interesting venue very near the Tennessee State Capitol building. The Wednesday foot traffic in this corner of Nashville was a lot less than the Saturday crowd in Knoxville, but there was still a decent amount of milling about. I arrived way too early, found a good parking lot nearby, and explored the exterior of the venue. Mostly I was trying to find something that looked like the main entrance. It was not obvious — there were many doors and they were all still locked.\n\nThe building does have a dandy courtyard, though, with an imposing statue standing tall in the center. It was quickly apparent that the auditorium was just one part of the overall War Memorial complex. It boasts several elegant pieces of statuary honoring the service of soldiers from various historic conflicts.\n\nAs I was standing out front admiring the architecture, a beauty queen strolled across the plaza in front of the auditorium. I’m not saying I saw her and thought, “She is so beautiful, she should win the pageant.” I’m saying she was dressed for it. Tiara and sash, red dress and heels, strolling across the plaza on a Wednesday afternoon. Like she was busy all morning in the state beauty queen office and then remembered she had to drop something off at the Legislature.\n\nI couldn’t help but think, “Well, that’s Nashville for you.”\n\nI figured one of the auditorium’s many doors would open when the time was right, so I set out looking for dinner. I was in “I’ll just have a salad” mode, since I had splurged on the way over at my favorite Cookeville ice cream shop, Cream City Ice Cream in that city’s old downtown area. If you ever wondered if I was the type of fellow to have favorite ice cream shops across the countryside, know that I am.\n\nI was struck by more classic architecture as I made my way around Nashville, notably the Downtown Presbyterian Church. Its twin bell towers rise majestically from the street below, admirable even in the shadow of the city’s towering modern skyscrapers.\n\nThe difference in the old church and the more contemporary giants around it stayed in mind as I strolled over to the salad oasis of a Panera Bread near the Ryman Auditorium. Everything old is new again, they say. That axiom stands out in the renovation and repurposing that revitalizes a downtown area.\n\nBack in Knoxville, some of the biggest new construction going on downtown is on the south side of the river at the former Baptist Hospital site. It’s starting to shape up into something, if for the time being that means a lot of orange cones and backed-up morning traffic. Hopefully these growing pains won’t take too awfully long to give way to the kind of urban liveliness that inspires folks to wander through the neighborhood and make some lazy afternoon memories.\n\nRandall’s picks\n\nBrian Wilson: Pet Sounds\n\nBeach Boy mastermind Brian Wilson and band will present the Pet Sounds 50th Anniversary World Tour at 8 p.m. Saturday at the Tennessee Theatre, 604 S.
