This time we got to sit down with Joe backstage ahead of his show at Tuffy’s Music Box in Sanford, FL. The wonderful songwriter and friend of the show Michael McArthur opened with Josh Davis on guitar. The atmosphere was welcoming and beautiful and I am so grateful to bring you this episode. Everyone, it is my great honor to bring you the return of Joe Pug.\n\nFollow all things Joe Pug at: https://joepugmusic.com/\n\nSupport The Marinade on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/marinadepodcast\n\nJaimee Harris is a singer and songwriter from Waco, Texas, who is one of my new favorite artists. Her debut full length record Red Rescue was released in 2018 to well deserved high praise. For whatever reason, that album snuck by my ears, but her follow up Boomerang Town, which came out last year got its hooks in me on the first listen.\n\nAs fate would have it, Jaimee was on tour with the legendary Mary Gauthier at that very moment and the tour was stopping just down the road.\n\nThankfully, Jaimee agree to sit down with us at Gram Parson’s Derry Down in Winter Haven, FL, earlier this month for a delightful conversation about writing, teaching, her incredible new record Boomerang Town, and of course, pinball.\n\nThe Marinade is a free-flowing conversation about the creative process with creative people. Each episode we welcome musicians, actors, comedians, authors, visual artists, filmmakers- anyone who creates art to talk about how and why we make stuff.\n\nListen on Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-marinade-with-jason-earle/id1281080492?i=1000643882805\n\nListen on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/episode/0DeaRPA9if1wK1wd6Sn8Hc?si=b0a8941d08134944\n\nFollow Jaimee Harris at: https://www.jaimeeharris.com/\n\nSupport The Marinade on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/marinadepodcast\n\nFind a pinball game near you: https://pinballmap.com/"
