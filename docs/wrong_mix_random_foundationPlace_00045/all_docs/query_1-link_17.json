        "text": "That's one of my main concerns too. Even in a film like THE THIN RED LINE (which I love), Cusack appears and I'm like...hey it's John Cusack. Mind you, he's one of my favorite actors of his/mine generation...he doesn't possess chameleon-like qualities as an actor, IMO.\n\nBased on the screening you attended, what would you say the percentage is on Dano/Cusack scenes? Also, pardon me for being nosey, do you live in Minneapolis/St. Paul? I think the film just had it's debut at that film festival this weekend, that's why I ask. And according to what I have read, this was the first time the film has been screened with \"One Kind of Love\" from Brian's newest record.\n\n\"One Kind of Love\" was definitely not in the print I saw at TIFF in September. The end credits were a live version of \"Love & Mercy\" plus about five minutes of session tape from \"Good Vibrations\" (the unused \"hum-be-dum\" section). I almost can't imagine where else they'd work \"One Kind of Love\" into the picture I saw.\n\nThe version I saw was probably 40/60 Dano/Cusack. It's close to an even split since the Dano scenes (which involve his relationship with Murry as well as the rest of the band) are in constant dialogue with Wilson's dependence on, and desire to extricate himself from, Landy.\n\nI've repeated myself a lot in this thread, but I was much more impressed by Cusack in the picture than by Dano, who is good but does a bit of mugging. Cusack successfully evokes Brian as he was in the eighties without getting too hung up on impersonation. It's a great movie.\n\nI've been fortunate to see the EPK for the film. It lists, of course, the normal production notes but probably the coolest thing (it's all interesting) is all of the music used in the film. Based on the screenplay and some of the descriptions by board members that have attended screenings, I'm guessing these are more or less in order (artist/performer only listed when it isn't the Beach Boys or Brian Wilson)\n\nSurfin' U.S.A.\n\nDon't Worry Baby\n\nSurfer Girl\n\nI Get Around\n\nI Get Around — Love & Mercy Musicians\n\nFun, Fun, Fun\n\nSongbird — Kenny G\n\nThese Dreams — Heart\n\nNowhere to Run — Martha Reeves & the Vandellas\n\nThe In Crowd — Ramsey Lewis Trio\n\nOn the Wings of Love — Jeffrey Osborne\n\nNights in White Satin — The Moody Blues\n\nGod Only Knows — Paul Dano\n\nI'm Waiting For the Day — Love & Mercy Musicians\n\nPet Sounds\n\nPet Sounds — Love & Mercy Musicians\n\nWouldn't It Be Nice\n\nWouldn't It Be Nice — Love & Mercy Musicians\n\nYou Still Believe In Me — Paul Dano\n\nYou Still Believe In Me\n\nLove & Mercy — Darian Sahanaja\n\nHang On to Your Ego\n\nHere Today\n\nCaroline, No\n\nCaroline, No — Love & Mercy Musicians\n\nI Live For the Sun — The Sunrays\n\nHeart Full of Soul — The Yardbirds\n\nDon't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\n\nSloop John B\n\nYou Don't Have to Say You Love Me — Dusty Springfield\n\nGood Vibrations — Paul Dano\n\nGood Vibrations\n\nSurf's Up\n\nSurf's Up — Paul Dano\n\nThe Elements: Fire\n\nHeroes & Villains\n\nDo You Like Worms\n\nIn My Room\n\nDay by Day — The Four Freshmen\n\nTil I Die\n\nOne Kind of Love\n\nLove & Mercy\n\nGood Vibrations\n\n***\n\n\"Black Hole\" composed by Atticus Ross contains portions of:\n\nDon't Worry Baby\n\nCalifornia Girls\n\nGood To My Baby\n\nHelp Me, Rhonda\n\nWendy\n\nDance, Dance, Dance\n\nDenny's Drums\n\nFun, Fun, Fun\n\n\"End Date\" composed by Atticus Ross contains portions of:\n\nDon't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\n\n\"Believe\" composed by Atticus Ross contains portions of:\n\nYou Still Believe In Me\n\nDon't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\n\nPet Sounds\n\n\"Silhouette\" composed by Atticus Ross contains portions of:\n\nGod Only Knows\n\nLet's Go Away For Awhile\n\nDon't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\n\nSloop John B\n\n\"Headphones\" composed by Atticus Ross contains portions of:\n\nI Live For the Sun — The Sunrays\n\nI Know THere's An Answer\n\nSloop John B\n\nPet Sounds\n\nDance, Dance, Dance\n\nDon't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\n\nHelp Me, Rhonda\n\nHere Today\n\n\"Knives and Forks\" composed by Atticus Ross contains portions of:\n\nGod Only Knows\n\n\"Deep End\" composed by Atticus Ross contains portions of:\n\nHeroes and Villains\n\nBarnyard\n\nI Love to Say Da Da\n\nWind Chimes\n\nDon't Worry Baby\n\nOur Prayer\n\n\"B&M Studio\" composed by Atticus Ross contains portions of:\n\nDon't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\n\n\"Baby No Morph\" composed by Atticus Ross contains portions of:\n\nI Love to Say Da Da\n\nHere Today\n\nDon't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\n\n\"Bed Montage\" composed by Atticus Ross contains portions of:\n\nDon't Worry Baby\n\nCalifornia Girls\n\n\"Into Mercy\" composed by Atticus Ross contains portions of:\n\nGod Only Knows\n\n***\n\nThanks for that!\n\nApparently my brother's interview with Brian was, in his own words, \"painful.\" Cusack was there to take up much of the slack, however.\n\nI saw the movie a couple weeks ago. I had some issues with how Melinda was portrayed as Brian's savior (in the same ways, ironically, Landy was painted in Brian's \"autobiography\" many years ago). But aside from that, I really loved it - it hit on all the major beats that you'd expect from a Brian Wilson biopic (at least for one that was so narrowly focused on two crucial time periods in his life). And they were clearly doing their homework when it came to Brian in the studio - a lot of the dialog was lifted pretty much verbatim from the Pet Sounds box set.\n\nThe film's composer, Atticus Ross, did a Q&A after our screening. Very interesting stuff. Apparently he was given complete access to literally every mutlitrack the Beach Boys ever recorded (on hard drive, delivered to his studio) in order to create the sound collages used in the film. I think they were incredibly effective in portraying how Brian's head was (and still is) constantly swimming in music.\n\nI wonder what Mike has to say about this movie...\n\nA lot of the actual Beach Boys music used in the film (as opposed to Ross's mash-up score) are only snippets, and a lot of the vocal performances (of Brian at least) are either Dano, or Dano's voice mixed with Brian's. And a lot of the scenes of the Wrecking Crew recording Pet Sounds/\"Good Vibrations\"/Smile aren't the original recordings - they're new recordings (albeit, mimicking the originals very closely). I don't recall any really \"in your face\" surround mixes on that material. However, Ross's score has a beautiful surround mix. There's bits and pieces flying all over the place. You're literally swimming in Brian's melodies. Some are easily recognizable, some have been chopped up and rearranged, but still sound very \"Brian-esque.\" I really can't wait to hear this on my home system when it comes out on Blu-Ray, quite honestly, and I'm hoping they put out a soundtrack of just Ross's work. (And instead of a soundtrack of the \"real\" Beach Boys songs used in the movie, they should just point people to the Pet Sounds & Smile box sets!)\n\nI take it Atticus Ross didn't hint at a soundtrack or score being released? It was reported last year in Billboard that there would be a soundtrack and I think the Wikipedia page still says there will be. But I wonder if things didn't change with the release of Brian's new solo album since \"One Kind of Love\" is included there. I too would love to hear the \"mashups\" as presented in the film (a film I've still yet to see, mind you).\n\nHope you don't mind me bugging you with minutiae but I'm compelled to ask all that have seen it, what's the breakdown of Dano/Cusack, percentage wise? I gather than only a few minutes are spent on the Beach Boys ascent up the charts and the bulk of the Dano scenes are from 1965-1967. I believe I read that the \"bed period\" is only briefly referenced in some dialog. The screenplay has the film opening with Brian in bed during the \"bed period\" and remembering the Beach Boys ascent to fame. I have gathered from the reviews and reports I have read from others that none of that imagery remained in the finished product. Which is fine.\n\nSomething else I'll mention is that I hope that with a Blu Ray/DVD/digital release that Lionsgate chooses to include some of the scenes that were excised from the film. For example there's a powerfully written scene in the screenplay that I don't believe is in the film (or, I should say, I was told was not) of Murry interrupting the \"I Get Around\" session (transposed from the actual \"Help Me, Rhonda\" session). I've followed the production of this film since Oren Moverman was writing the screenplay (maybe even earlier) so I'm enthused about anything related to it.\n\nReally has been a long time coming for a well made film about BW. I'm glad BW is still around the see the accolades.\n\nNo one thought to ask! I kinda wish I had. (He did answer one of my questions, about Brian's impressions of what he did - he said Brian was a bit concerned with how \"dark\" some of it was, but in the end he liked it.)\n\nAs others have said, it's about 50/50. I didn't watch it with a stopwatch, really! Obviously, I would have been happier if they had focused more on the earlier period, as I think they did such an incredible job re-creating moments I've known from box sets and bootlegs for years. And I felt the whole Cusack/Banks love-story aspect felt somewhat awkward. Cusack does a serviceable job capturing Brian's latter-day quirks, but as others have mentioned, you watch the movie and just can't get past the fact that it's John Cusack playing Brian Wilson. Dano, on the other hand, completely loses himself in the part. I did enjoy Paul Giamatti's performance quite a bit, as well.\n\nPretty much true. The group's ascent is handled more like a prologue. Some flashes of them performing on TV and in concert, a few in-the-studio snippets, etc.\n\nThere's a bit of the \"in bed\" period covered towards the end of the Smile period, but basically it ends there, and there's no reference at all to anything in the Seventies (except for a beautiful use of \"Til I Die\"). They don't even really cover how Landy entered into Brian's life in the first place.\n\nI was a bit surprised that the \"Rhonda\" stuff didn't end up in the movie either, as it's probably the single greatest example of Murry's overbearing relationship with Brian. I do believe there's a snippet of the \"I'm a genius, too\" line in one of the montages, though. And there's certainly scenes of Murry being Murry, which is probably why that particular scene was cut. But honestly, my recollection was that the \"An American Family\" TV movie did a better/more accurate/more thorough job of portraying Murry than this movie did. (And that one did use the \"Rhonda\" exchange, if I recall correctly.)"
