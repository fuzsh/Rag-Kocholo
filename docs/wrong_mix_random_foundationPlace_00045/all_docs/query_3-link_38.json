        "text": "The family of Brian Wilson is seeking a conservatorship for the 81-year-old Beach Boys co-founder just weeks after the death of his longtime wife, Melinda Ledbetter.\n\nWilson's longtime publicist and manager Jean Sievers said in a statement that Wilson's family, \"after careful consideration,\" have appointed Sievers and LeeAnn Hard, Wilson's longtime business manager, as \"co-conservators of the person,\" according to Los Angeles ABC station KABC.\n\n\"This decision was made to ensure that there will be no extreme changes to the household and Brian and the children living at home will be taken care of and remain in the home where they are cared for by Gloria Ramos and the wonderful team at the house who have been in place for many years helping take care of the family,\" the statement said.\n\nThe statement concluded, \"Brian will be able to enjoy all of his family and friends and continue to work on current projects as well as participate in any activities he chooses.\"\n\nWilson's family filed court documents this week in the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles County seeking the conservatorship, with Wilson's doctor noting that Wilson \"has a major neurocognitive disorder (such as dementia).\"\n\nLedbetter attended to her husband's \"daily living needs\" before her passing, according to the filing, as he \"is unable to properly provide for his own personal needs for physical health, food, clothing, or shelter.\"\n\nThe filing also notes that Wilson had an Advance Health Care Directive naming Ledbetter as the agent for his health care but no successor was listed as the reason for seeking a conservatorship of the person.\n\nThe filing explains that Sievers and Hard are being named co-conservators due to their close relationship with Wilson and the fact that he trusts them.\n\nA hearing on the matter is scheduled for April.\n\nWilson announced in an Instagram post last month that Ledbetter died Jan. 30 at the age of 77, writing, \"Melinda was more than my wife. She was my savior.\"\n\nThe couple married in 1995 and adopted five children together. Wilson also has two children from his first marriage, Carnie and Wendy Wilson of the band Wilson Phillips."
