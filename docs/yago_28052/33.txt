He took the Polish throne in 1079 when Boleslaus II died, but resigned the royal title and supported Henry IV in a bid to restore peace.

Wladislaus Herman was first married to Judith of Bohemia, then to Judith of Swabia, the daughter of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor.

Wladislaus and Judith of Swabia had a daughter named Agnes of Gandersheim.
