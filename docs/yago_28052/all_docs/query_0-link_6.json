He was crowned as a child during his father's lifetime in order to ensure his succession, but his uncle BÃ©la managed to dethrone his father and ascend to the throne. Some years later, Solomon enforced his cousins, GÃ©za, Ladislaus and Lampert to accept his reign with the military assistance his brother-in-law, King Henry IV of Germany provided him. During the following years, Solomon and his cousins cooperated efficiently in order to strengthen the position of the Kingdom of Hungary, but finally they broke with each other. Following his cousins open rebellion, the major part of the kingdom accepted his cousins' rule and Solomon could maitain his power only in the Western part of Hungary. Finally, he had to accept his cousin, Ladislaus' reign. He spent his last years in exile fighting against Hungary with the assistance of the Pechenegs.\n\nChildhoodSolomon was the first son of King Andrew I of Hungary and Anastasia, a daughter of Grand Duke Yaroslav I the Wise of Kiev. Before his birth, his uncle, BÃ©la was the designated heir to the crown, who was governing the Tercia pars regni (i.e. one third of the kingdom). However, Solomon's birth changed the situation radically, because King Andrew decided to ensure his son's inheritance and he had Solomon crowned in 1057.\n\nAfter the child's coronation, Duke BÃ©la left the royal court. In September 1058, when King Andrew concluded peace with King Henry IV of Germany, the child Solomon was engaged to the German ruler's sister, Judith. In 1059, according to the chronicles, King Andrew called back Duke BÃ©la to his court, and placed before him a crown and a sword, representing royal and ducal power, respectively, and asked his brother to take his choice. Having been forewarned by a courtier that choosing the crown would mean his life, Duke BÃ©la instead selected the sword. Shortly afterwards, Duke BÃ©la fled to Poland and returned followed by Polish troops placed at his disposal by King Boleslaw II of Poland.\n\nWhen King Andrew was informed on his brother's return, he sent his wife and children to Melk in Austria. Afterwards, the king lost two battles against his brother, and died before 6 December 1060, when BÃ©la I was crowned.\n\nFollowing his father's death, Solomon lived in the imperial court three years, during which his followers tried to acquire assistance against his uncle, but it was only in August 1063 when the Imperial Diet decided in Mainz to send troops to Hungary. King BÃ©la I died in an accident before the imperial army entered to the kingdom, and his three sons (GÃ©za, Ladislaus and Lampert) left for Poland.\n\n[edit] King of HungaryAfter his uncle's death and his cousins' escape, Solomon returned to Hungary where he was crowned again and he married the German king's sister in September 1063 in SzÃ©kesfehÃ©rvÃ¡r. When the German army left Hungary, his three cousins came back followed by Polish troops. The parties, however, wanted to avoid the civil war; therefore they accepted the mediation services of the bishops, and they made an agreement on 20 January 1064 in Gyor. Under the agreement Dukes GÃ©za, Ladislaus and Lampert accepted Solomon's rule, and they received their father's former duchy, i.e., one third of Hungary. Following the conclusion of the peace, the king and his cousins celebrated Easter together in PÃ©cs. However, when a fire broke out, the two parties accused the other's followers of incendiarism. The bishops had to intervene again in order to appease the king and the dukes.\n\nIn the next years, Solomon and his cousins collaborated successfully. In 1067, they lead an army together to provide assistance to the dukes' brother-in-law, at that time ban of Croatia, Dmitar Zvonimir against Venice. In 1068, when the Pechenegs had overrun the territories of Transylvania, Solomon and the dukes went together against them and they won a victory at Chirales.\n\nIn 1071, Solomon and the dukes lead a campaign against the Byzantine Empire and laid siege to the fortress of Belgrade (NÃ¡ndorfehÃ©rvÃ¡r). The siege lasted two months, and the Greek commander surrendered the fort to the dukes not to the king. Moreover, Duke GÃ©za denied to hand over the king's share of the booty and set the Greek captives free without the king's permission. Having the Byzantine troops reoccupied Belgrade in the next year, Solomon and Duke GÃ©za lead their armies together against the Greeks, but GÃ©za left his two brothers behind, because he was worrying about that the king's partisans would try to occupy their duchy during their absence. The campaign was a total failure, because the king and the duke were not able to cooperate during the siege any more.\n\n[edit] Struggle for the throneDuring 1073, both the king and his cousins were preparing for the coming struggle; Solomon sent his envoys to his brother-in-law, King Henry IV of Germany, while his cousins were seeking the help of their Polish and Czech relatives. In the beginning of 1074, before the Polish and Czech troops arrived, Solomon led his armies against the dukes' territory and defeated Duke GÃ©za on 26 February at Kemej. However, after the arrival of the reinforcement from Poland and Bohemia, the dukes' armies started a counter-attack and they won a decisive victory over Solomon's troops on 14 March in the Battle of MogyorÃ³d.\n\nAfter his defeat, Solomon run to the Western borders of Hungary and sought help from the German king, whose supremacy he accepted, while his eldest cousin, GÃ©za was declared king, supported by the Hungarian tradition which preferred seniority. In August 1074, the imperial troops invaded the Northern part of the kingdom and advanced till VÃ¡c, but the German king was obliged to return to his domain because of the Saxons' uprising. King Solomon could only maintain his rule over the Counties (megye) of Moson and Pozsony.\n\nHowever, Solomon could beat off the troops GÃ©za sent to siege Pozsony and GÃ©za, who became more and more ill, was thinking of his abdication and the acceptance of Solomon's rule. But after GÃ©za's death on 25 April 1077, his followers proclaimed his brother, Ladislaus king. In 1079, King Ladislaus I managed to occupy the fortress of Moson from Solomon's adherents, and he also repealed the German king's troops. Solomon also lost the support of the clergy when Pope Gregory VII, because of his alliance with the German king, acknowledged the legitimacy of King Ladislaus' rule.\n\nSolomon had to realize that he did not have any chance to win over Ladislaus and he abdicated in 1081. In exchange for the acceptance of Ladislaus' rule, Solomon received extensive landholdings.\n\n[edit] Conspiracy and failureSolomon, however, did not give up his ambitions and tried to plot against the king, but he was betrayed and Ladislaus had him imprisoned. On 15 August 1083, on the occasion of the canonization of Stephen I, the first King of Hungary, Solomon was released. His release was attributed to the newly canonized Saint Stephen's intercession, whose coffin could only be opened when Solomon retrieved his freedom.\n\nSolomon left for Regensburg, where he tried to obtain military assistance from his brother-in-law, the German king, but his attempts failed. Afterwards, following a long wandering, Solomon made an alliance with Kuteshk, the leader of a Pecheneg (besenyo) tribe that had settled in the territory of the future principality of Moldavia. Solomon married Kuteshk's daughter, even though his first wife was still alive (she had left Solomon years before). Solomon promised to hand over parts of the kingdom of Hungary to Kuteshk in exchange for his new father-in-law's military assistance. In 1085, Solomon lead an army of Pecheneg troops against Hungary, but King Ladislaus I defeated them.\n\nIn 1087, Solomon took part in the Pechenegs' campaign against the Byzantine Empire. He was killed in battle near Hadrianopolis. Later chronicles claimed that Solomon escaped from the battlefield and went to Pula, where he lived as a monk. His remains are interred at the Pula Cathedral.1\n\nNote on Wife: Judith of SWABIA\n\nJudith-Maria of Swabia (b. Goslar, 9 April 1054 â d. 14 March ca. 1105?) was a German princess, a member of the Ottonian dynasty and by her two marriages Queen of Hungary and Duchess of Poland renamed Sophia in 1089.\n\nShe was the daughter of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor by his second wife Agnes, daughter of William V, Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitou.\n\nJudith (also named Maria in some sources) was the youngest of the six children born to Emperor Henry III and Empress Agnes. Her older five siblings were: Adelaide (later Abbess of Quedlinburg), Gisela (who died in infancy before her birth), Matilda (later wife of Rudolf of Rheinfelden, Duke of Swabia and Antiking), Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor and Conrad II, Duke of Bavaria (who also died in infancy). In addition, Judith had an older half-sister, Beatrix I, Abbess of Quedlinburg and Gandersheim, born from her father's first marriage with Gunhilda of Denmark.\n\n[edit] Queen of Hungary\n\nSoon after her birth on 9 April 1054, Judith was betrothed to Philip, eldest son and heir of King Henry I of France. However, the engagement was broken in September of 1058, when her brother Emperor Henry IV concluded a peace treaty with Andrew I, King of Hungary; as a part of the alliance, she was engaged to the Hungarian King's son and heir, Solomon. When King Andrew I died in 1060, his widow and sons took refuge in the German court. With the support of his powerful brother-in-law, Solomon could recover the Hungarian throne after the death of his uncle BÃ©la I in 1063 and soon after married with Judith in (StuhlweiÃenburg) SzÃ©kesfehÃ©rvÃ¡r.\n\nThe marriage proved to be unsuccessful, and apparently both the King and Queen had love affairs. Although it is generally believed that the union was childless, some sources[1][2] state that Solomon and Judith had a daughter, Sophia, who later married Poppo, Count of Berg-Schelklingen. If this parentage is correct, Judith was the great-grandmother of Salomea of Berg, second wife of Boleslaw III Wrymouth (her later stepson).\n\nDuring the 1070s, a struggle for power commenced between King Solomon and his cousins (sons of the late BÃ©la I). On 14 March 1074 at the Battle of MogyorÃ³d, the King's forces were decisively defeated by his cousins and their allies, the Dukes of Poland and Bohemia. Judith fled to Germany while Solomon continue his fight for the Hungarian throne; in 1077 he accepted the rule of his cousin King LÃ¡szlÃ³ I, who gave him in exchange extensive landholdings after his formal abdication (1081). Despite this, Solomon never gave up his pretensions and began to plot against King LÃ¡szlÃ³ I; however, his plans were discovered and he was imprisoned by the King in the Tower of VisegrÃ¡d until 15 August 1083, when on the occasion of the canonization of IstvÃ¡n I, the first King of Hungary, Solomon was released.\n\nIn the meantime, Judith remained in Germany and settled in her residence in Regensburg (with short breaks) from May or July 1074 until 1088. After his release, Solomon went to Germany and tried to reunite with his wife, but she refused to receive him. After a long wandering, Solomon made an alliance with Kuteshk, the leader of a Pecheneg tribe settled in the later principality of Moldavia. Between 1084-1085 he married his daughter, committing bigamy with this act.\n\nSolomon promised to hand over parts of the kingdom of Hungary in exchange for his new father-in-law's military assistance. In 1085, Solomon led the Pecheneg troops against Hungary, but King LÃ¡szlÃ³ I defeated them. Two years later, in 1087, Solomon took part in the Pechenegs' campaign against the Byzantine Empire and was killed in a battle near Hadrianopolis.\n\n[edit] Duchess of Poland\n\nIn 1089, Judith married with Wladyslaw I Herman, Duke of Poland. This union considerably benefitted German-Polish relations; on the occasion of the wedding, Emperor Henry IV commissioned to the St. Emmeram's Abbey the creation of Gospel Books to the Polish court, now kept in the library of the chapter in the KrakÃ³w Cathedral.\n\nAfter her marriage, Judith changed her name to Sophia, perhaps to distinguish herself from Wladyslaw I's first wife, Judith of Bohemia. She bore her husband four daughters: Sophia (by marriage Princess of Vladimir-Volynia), Agnes (later Abbess of Quedlinburg and Gandersheim), Adelaide (by marriage Countess of Vohburg and Margravine of the Northern March),[3] and an unnamed daughter (later wife of a Polish lord).\n\nShe probably had a big impact on Poland's political life. It's believed that she was the mistress of Sieciech, the Count Palatine and true governor of the country. Judith actively aiding Sieciech in his schemes to take over the country; the death of Mieszko Boleslawowic under mysterious circumstances was, in all probability, caused by orders of the Count Palatine and Judith. With the help of Sieciech, Judith convinced her husband to postpone the return of Wladyslaw I's first-born son Zbigniew, who seems to be a strong candidate to the succession despite his illegitimacy; also, they wanted an eventual alliance with the only legitimate son of Wladyslaw I, Boleslaw, born from his first marriage with the Bohemian princess.\n\nAfter discovering the plans of Sieciech and Judith to take over the country, Boleslaw and Zbigniew became allies. Both brothers demanded that the reigns of government should be handed over to them. Eventually, after some attempts to break the alliance between the brothers, Sieciech was defeated, deposed and exiled (ca. 1100-1101). On 4 June 1102 Duke Wladyslaw I died. The country was divided between Boleslaw III and Zbigniew.\n\nJudith's date of death was disputed among historians and web sources. Although 14 March is stated as the correct day in almost all the known sources, in the case of the year is more difficult to ascertain. Sources established that she died between 1092â1096, but this seems improbable, because is known that in 1105, Boleslaw III entered into an agreement with her, the so-called Tyniec Accord. In exchange for a generous grant, Judith guaranteed her neutrality in the Duke's political contest with his half-brother Zbigniew. Thus, she died after that date. Gerard Labuda stated that Judith spent her last years of life in Regensburg with her (supposed) daughter Adelaide, wife of Count Dietpold III of Vohburg and Cham; since the date of the marriage between Adelaide and Count Dietpold III was ranked between 1110â1118, it's assumed that Judith died after the latter year, in a relative advanced age.[4] Her place of burial, Admont Abbey in Austria, apparently confirm this theory.\n\nSources"
