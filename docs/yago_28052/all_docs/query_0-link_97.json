        "text": "Now, this Letter of Alliance would probably be a lot similar to the OTL Letter of Union, however, I was thinking that rather than establishing Norway, Sweden and Denmark (perhaps we should scrap the Norrige idea?) under a single monarch in personal union, it is established that the three monarchs are equals and have their primary jurisdictions over their separate realms, but it would include clauses that would ensure that no territorial disputes could ever arise, and that they must share military intelligence amongst each other, as well as rush to each others' aid in war. Could we perhaps form such a body as the Kingly Quorum where the three monarchs and a collection of their most prominent jarls meet annually to make sure that disputes doesn't arise? Do you think the three monarchs could agree to something like that?\n\nThey can certainly agree, but maintaining said agreement would rely on three conditions: 1) the Kievan threat to their east remains credible, ensuring that betraying your allies is never a real option, 2) the three kingdoms remain relatively equal in power and none clearly dominates the alliance, 3) three separate dynasties continue holding the respective thrones. Once a crown union is achieved between two of the kingdoms, I doubt the lucky ruler would stop himself/herself from claiming the third crown.\n\nIf so, then we would have established the Scandinavian Confederacy, the Holy Roman Emperor's ally in the Baltic.\n\nSpeaking of the Holy Roman Empire, is Denmark going to pursue a seat at the electoral college of the Empire? In a role similar to that of the King of Bohemia? \"The King of Bohemia, who was in fact not a prince of the Empire but a neighbouring and independent monarch, might vote at an imperial election, but was allowed on no other occasion to meddle in the affairs of the Empire.\" The members of the college were not formalized to just 7 people until the 13th century. We can have the college take a different course and include more allies of the Empire and members of the German nobility. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince-elector#cite_note-0\n\nA final thing that intrigues me about Raud the Strong is the fact that not only was he an influential pagan Seidmann, he was also a well-known and respected sea-faring warrior. We had established that rather than two Christian missionaries, those who follow Leif to Greenland and later on Vinland would be a pagan priest and two warriors. For this, we invented the character the pagan priest Asgeir. But we don't need to invent any character now when you think about it. Raud the Strong is king Olaf's trusted man who follows Leif to Greenland to stabilize Aesir worship there, along with two disciples, and later on goes with him to Vinland. Either Raud eventually returns to the court of king Olaf, or someone like him takes the role of the court Seidmann. Your thoughts?\n\nI doubt Raud was the only Seidmann in Norway. We can have him claim a seat at court and then convert more practitioners to the royal cause. We can then have pagan priests send towards different directions and fulfilling a variety of missions.\n\nSounds like a plan. In this timeline she gives birth to Harald IV, on the other hand. ... What year would you suggest Harald IV to be born and what year would you propose his father dies and he is made king of Norway?\n\nI would place the marriage of his parents c. 1044, when they are both in their mid-20s at most. The couple at first have a couple of daughters, then Harald IV is born c. 1048. He is 18-years-old when his father rises to the throne in 1066. Meaning that Harald gets to be involved in the politics of the reign. Magnus I enjoys a peaceful reign but succumbs to a disease c. 1078. A 30-year-old Harald IV rises to the throne and is allowed to pursue his own policies. (I wanted to avoid an overly young and inexperienced king or a middle-aged and tired one. Leaving open the options for what kind of king Magnus turns out to be).\n\nAs for marital alliances for Harald, I'd suggest looking for closer relations with Denmark, Sweden, Munster, or Kiev. These four kingdoms seem to have served as the main source of spouses for Norwegian monarchs between c. 1050 and c. 1150.\n\nOn second thought, let's bring him down to Constantinople, and remain at the imperial court for the rest of his life. Doux Alexios Komnenos may wish to marry one of his daughters?[/FONT]\n\nHarald Hardrada was born c. 1015, Alexios Komnenos was born c. 1056. Harald was old enough to be Alexios' father, rather than son-in-law. But Harald did have a Byzantine mistress named Maria. Supposedly a niece of empress Zoe but the relationship is in doubt. Zoe's only two siblings were childless. She might have been instead a maternal relative of the Empress. Or perhaps a niece-in-law, through one of Zoe's three marriages. See: http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/BYZANTIUM.htm#_Toc204564500\n\nThe Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson (1179-1241) reports the following, see: http://omacl.org/Heimskringla/hardrade1.html\n\n\"There was a young and beautiful girl called Maria, a brother's daughter [niece, but Zoe had no brothers] of the empress Zoe, and Harald had paid his addresses to her; but the empress had given him a refusal.\" A refusal to a marriage proposal by the legal guardian of the girl, not the girl herself. ... \"The same night King Harald and his men went to the house where Maria slept and carried her away by force. Then they went down to where the galleys of the Varings lay, took two of them and rowed out into Sjavid sound. When they came to the place where the iron chain is drawn across the sound, Harald told his men to stretch out at their oars in both galleys; but the men who were not rowing to run all to the stern of the galley, each with his luggage in his hand. The galleys thus ran up and lay on the iron chain. As soon as they stood fast on it, and would advance no farther, Harald ordered all the men to run forward into the bow. Then the galley, in which Harald was, balanced forwards and swung down over the chain; but the other, which remained fast athwart the chain, split in two, by which many men were lost; but some were taken up out of the sound. Thus Harald escaped out of Constantinople and sailed thence into the Black Sea; but before he left the land he put the lady ashore and sent her back with a good escort to Constantinople and bade her tell her relation, the Empress Zoe, how little power she had over Harald, and how little the empress could have hindered him from taking the lady. Harald then sailed northwards in the Ellipalta and then all round the Eastern empire.\"\n\nIf Harald is allowed to marry this Maria, he can stay in Constantinople and further serve Constantine IX Monomachos in military campaigns. He might rise to become \"prōtomanglabitēs (πρωτομαγγλαβίτης, \"first manglabitēs\") or epi tou manglabiou (ἐπί τοῦ μαγγλαβίου, \"in charge of the manglabion\")\", chief bodyguard to the Augustus/Augusta. Or rise from Spatharokandidatos to higher dignities. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manglabites and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatharokandidatos\n\nThe hierarchy seems to have been (from lower to higher):\n\n*Spatharokandidatos. Mid-ranking dignity, its distinctive badge (brabeion) was a golden chain (maniakion) worn around the chest.\" Equivalent to the administrative and military ranks of asekretis (senior secretary), kleisourarches (commander of a frontier district), topoteretes of a tagma (lieutenant of a battalion/regiment) and tourmarches of a thema (provincial army commander).\n\n*Dishypatos. Nominally \"twice consul\". Holding a high rank among the honorary consuls. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishypatos and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatos\n\n*Protospatharios. Title reserved for senior generals, senior court officials, provincial governors and foreign rulers closely allied to the empire. The lowest rank required to get a seat at the Byzantine Senate. Occassionally merely equivalent to the office of katepano (regional commander) of border provinces, such as Antioch, Mesopotamia, and Chaldia. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protospatharios and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katepano\n\n*Patrikios. Literally \"Patrician\". Rank mostly reserved for senior provincial governors, generals, and court officials. Also held by the majority of members of the Byzantine Senate. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrikios#Late_Roman_and_Byzantine_periods\n\n*Anthypatos. Literally \"Proconsul\". Title reserved for high-ranking administrative and military officials, the upper class of the patricians. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthypatos\n\n*Magistros. Literally \"Magister\", though it started out as a descendant rank of \"Magister officiorum\" (Master of Offices). Title reserved for senior ministers, there were reportedly between 12 and 24 persons concurrently holding the rank during the 10th century. Holders often also held the ranks of vestes or vestarches. Their ranks included some of the most notable generals of the 11th century, and senior judicial officials. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistros#Byzantine_Empire and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestes and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestarches\n\n*Proedros. Literally \"President\", since holders were the Presiding officers of the Byzantine Senate. The senior non-imperial title available to males. There was only one such man at any point in time during the Macedonian dynasty, who reserved the title for eunuchs. Holders often were Prime Ministers in all but name. The Doukai and Komnenoi devalued the title by granting it to more people and opening it to the aristocracy. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proedros\n\n*Zoste Patrikia. Literally \"Girded Lady-patrician\", roughly equivalent to the British \"Mistress of the Robes\". The senior lady or ladies of the Imperial household. Chief attendant to the Augusta, head of the Women's Court, and the only woman/women who were Patricians by their own right, not the right of their spouses. The title was typically held by a single woman, though there are indications that since the 10th century there were times that two or more women concurrently held the title. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoste_patrikia\n\n*Kouropalates. Literally \"the one one in charge of the palace\", roughly equivalent to \"majordomo\". Originally reserved for members of the imperial family, and key allies to the Emperors. Most notably the rulers of Caucasian Iberia (Georgia) and Armenia. The Komnenoi devalued the title, but mostly replaced it with their own version, Sebastos/Sebaste (Venerable One, Augustus/Augusta). The title and variations of it were originally reserved for members of the wider imperial family and closely allied aristocrats. Notably the King of Georgia, the Duke of Naples, the Doge of Venice, and the Sultan of Rum. The title signified imperial favorites, and not all family members automatically qualified. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curopalates and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastos\n\n*Nobelissimos/Nobilissumus. Literally \"Most Noble\". Title usually reserved for senior members of the imperial family. But in the 11th century, its use expanded to first the senior commanders of the Byzantine Army (effectively chiefs of staff), then other high officials and foreign dignitaries. For example Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia held this rank, despite being a Byzantine enemy for most of his career. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobelissimos\n\n*Kaisar. Literally \"Caesar\". Title usually reserved for the most influential member of the imperial family who still doesn't have an actual imperial rank. Fourth highest title among the Komnenian hierarchy. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_(title)#Byzantine_Empire\n\n*Sebastokrator. Literally \"Venerable Ruler\". Title created by Alexios I Komnenos for his brother. Originally second only to the emperors, and the lowest rank allowed to wear a crown. The title was awarded to a Grand Prince of Serbia in the late 12th century, at the time the most powerful vassal of the Empire. Later the title was used by several Balkan states, reserved for their own highest ranking nobles. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastokrator\n\n*Despotes. Literally (Lord, Master). Title created by Manuel I Komnenos in the 1160s for Bela III, King of Hungary, his son-in-law and heir presumptive. Originally reserved for younger sons, and son-in-laws of the Emperors with no inherent claim to the throne. Later granted to various monarchs which were closely allied or subordinate to the Palailologoi emperors. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despotes\n\n*Symbasileus (plural symbasileis). Co-king, co-emperor. The junior co-ruler to a reigning emperor. Position typically reserved for the senior son of the Emperor. Though several of them were co-rulers with several sons, son-in-laws, brothers, or uncles. There was no apparent limit on how many co-rulers could be active at any point in time. There were no specific duties of the title. Depending on the political situation at court, a symbasileus could be active in politics, in administrative duties, in charge of parts of the armies. Or he could be a cipher with no actual powers. The purpose of the \"college of emperors\" was that the throne does not remain vacant when any of them dies.\n\n*Basileus. King or Emperor, depending on the context. Basilissa being the feminine form, though Augusta was still in use. In Byzantine matters mostly reserved for the senior emperor, equivalent to Latin Augustus. The title Augustus had mostly fell out of use for males by the time of the Komnenoi, but the feminine form was in common use. Typically in charge of everything, but the actual authority of an Emperor depended on his personal qualities and the climate at court.See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basileus#Romans_and_Byzantines\n\nPartial commentary:\n\nUnless stonewalls and earthworks were thrown up back in the day, I think the stockade barriers of the early days would be long gone as the city area expanded.\n\nFrankly, I don't know that as they started out as a small agrarian settlement at the beginning, that they would have possessed enough manpower for digging stone quarries. I imagined that this settlement developed on trade instead over warfare. The expanding numbers of Norse and other groups from Europe moving into a fixed area would have been enough to give the Boethuk pause to attack anyway. The crusader would have to build up some ramshackle defences after they capture the port of the city. [...] But if the crusaders are defended by mere wooden stockading, and if the Vinlanders have anyone among their own with knowledge of siege warfare or engineering, this could reduce the amount of time the crusaders have to occupy Aesirskagi.\n\nWell, I've been looking into the possibility of the Aesirskagians building stone walls, and frankly, it does not look too good. The best comparable architectural feat would be the city wall of Visby on Gotland, which was constructed mainly in the 13th century, with one tower dating back to the 12th (it was originally named the lamb tower but has since, surprisingly enough, been renamed the gunpowder tower). In the early 13th century, they manage to build one as high as 5 metres, in the late 13th century being rebuilt even higher.\n\nHowever, there exists an important difference between Markland and Gotland, namely, Gotland was subject to several conquests, as well as raids by Baltic pirates. Building a wall would have been a matter of priority for the Visbyans. I don't really think the Vinlanders would have any need to build such a wall at Aesirskagi, certainly not that early, unless they were subject of constant raids or attacks. Now it is certainly possible that the Havenusanir have acquired Norse shipbuilding designs in their own trading networks in the Great Lakes, but by the time they get this far, either the Great Peacemaker or Hiawatha are at power, and I expect them to be too smart to start systematically raiding Vinland. No need to wake a sleeping giant.\n\nThe Penavaskir (the Penobscot) I assume to initially have become victims to various raids for slaves by the Vinlanders, considering their geographical position, although later on these likely have become more and more rare, with the practice of slavery in Vinland itself declining. In any case, I doubt that the Penavaskir will be as advanced technologically as their Havenusanir cousins in the 12th century, and though they may have a grudge against the Vinlanders, they have neither the manpower nor the ships to pose a threat to the city of Aesirskagi even nearly great enough to justify the construction of such a great wall. I mean, the Penavaskir lives in OTL Maine. They may on land attack settlements in Vinland (OTL New Brunswick and Nova Scotia) but to go all the way up to Aesirskagi in Markland (Newfoundland) frequent enough to pose a threat if at all? You'd need an alien space bat to provide them with bazookas for that to be possible.\n\nThe truth is, there are nobody posing an active threat to the inhabitants of Aesirskagi. With annoyance, I have to concede the point to you, Lysandros. There is no logical reason for the Aesirskagians to invest the manpower and resources necessary to construct such fortifications around the city. We can still be optimistic and say that during the early days the Aesirskagians, freshly emerged from having dealth with the local Skrælings, may have found it prudent to construct a couple (less than five) towers around their settlements in stone over a few decades for maximum security, but little (if anything) more. And then we're being nice to them.\n\nHowever! ...Aesirskagi has one important advantage that will make it easier for the Crusaders to defend it! See, we have positioned Aesirskagi to correspond OTL St. John's on the Avalon Peninsula, which will be easier for the Crusaders to defend. They already have the ships necessary to patrol the coasts, the only place where fortifications and the positioning of land-based troops will be necessary is the narrow piece of land that connects the peninsula to the Markland mainland. Right there, the Crusaders have been given a significant advantage when it comes to keeping and defending their settlement.\n\nYou know, there hasn't been any discussion on just how Asaism develops, which I presume, forms just shortly after the Canonic Sagas is written. Would Seidman play a major part in its founding or development from an ethnic belief-system to a written theology of rules, precepts and tenets?\n\nI would actually expect to have Asaism gain its enduring shape and form concurrently with the compilation of the Canonic Sagas (like with early Christianity and the Council of Nicaea). Anyway, Seidmen will undoubtedly play an important role in writing down and interpreting passages, and there will be a lot of conferencing with the visions of völvas, as well as having the galds and göthi present the “historical” records for the composition.\n\nHow would it carry to other Heathen groups of ethnic Slavs, Balts, Finns, Sami, and even Skraeling allies? The European pagan's religions are related and have common themes, but at what point would they begin to identify themselves Asaists?\n\nI guess that after a century, enough of them would have acculturated sufficiently into Nordic Vinlander society, that distinctions would be blurred between the different ethnicities as they live close together and begin to participate in each others religious festivals, building up a communal spirit among them. By then, the rise of literature within their own society would be seen as their collective achievement in their culture. Holy books based on their collective folklore and beliefs would not require personal \"conversions\" to a new faith, because it would really be the same faith they already have, only that the old faith has been given a new name.\n\nPretty much exactly what I was thinking.\n\nHmmm... wide use of Euhemerism?\n\n\"Euhemerus has become known chiefly for a rationalizing method of interpretation, known as \"Euhemerism\", which treats mythological accounts as a reflection of historical events, or mythological characters as historical personages but which were shaped, exaggerated or altered by retelling and traditional mores. In more recent literature of myth, such as in Bulfinch's Mythology, Euhemerism is called the \"Historical Interpretation\" of mythology.\"\n\n\"Euhemerism is defined in modern academic literature as the theory that myths are distorted accounts of real historical events. Euhemerus was not the first to attempt to rationalize mythology through history, as euhemeristic views are found in earlier writers, including Xenophanes, Herodotus, Hecataeus of Abdera and Ephorus. However Euhemerus is credited as having developed the theory in application to all myths, considering mythology to be \"history in disguise\".\"\n\nWhile I knew about the concept, I wasn't aware of that there actually existed a word for it.\n\nWonder how the various mythologies help shape a new historical view for the Christian Europe of the 12th century.\n\nAnimism as an undercurrent in Monotheism? Interesting thought. Are we going to have traditions concerning the Alfar (Elves), Vaettir (Wights), Dvergar (Dwarfs) etc mostly survive and find their way into written accounts?\n\nWell, it wouldn't actually be that farfetched, would it, seeing that animism endured for centuries after the Christianisation process in the Scandinavian countries in our timeline, with people seriously worrying about trolls breaking in to replace farmers' children with their own and gnomes killing their livestock. Euhemerism too was amazingly long-lived in Scandinavia. Right up until the 19th century, scholars insisted that Odin and Thor really had been actual historical characters that had enjoyed significant mythologization.\n\nHowever, like in our timeline, I doubt that these traditions will spread at all throughout Europe, but pretty much remain a Scandinavian practice. Still, the Scandinavian monarchs may use the Euhemerist history to justify claiming certain territories, etc.\n\nThis might need some changing attitudes on the subject in wider Christianity. While divination was widely practiced among early Christians, its connection to both paganism and Montanism had it banned and persecuted by the 5th century.\n\nThe more doctrinally permissible Holy Roman Catholic Church can surely deal with that reasonably. A century or so, with a pope intrigued by divination can open up the legalisation and acceptance of such practices.\n\nThey can certainly agree, but maintaining said agreement would rely on three conditions: 1) the Kievan threat to their east remains credible, ensuring that betraying your allies is never a real option, 2) the three kingdoms remain relatively equal in power and none clearly dominates the alliance, 3) three separate dynasties continue holding the respective thrones. Once a crown union is achieved between two of the kingdoms, I doubt the lucky ruler would stop himself/herself from claiming the third crown.\n\nI am in complete agreement.\n\nThe Kievan threat to the east remains credible as long as Finland remains Kievan territory and there is a significant Kievan navy in the Baltic. It will also be worrisome to see the Kievans find more and more influence thanks to their alliance with the Rhomaioi. Point 2 I believe can be handled easily by the mechanism behind point 1. Part 3 is the interesting thing, and here I agree with you there is a problem. The Confederacy may stand in its original form for two, maybe even three centuries, but eventually it will either collapse back into two or three separate nations, or, they will all be joined together under a single monarch.\n\nSpeaking of the Holy Roman Empire, is Denmark going to pursue a seat at the electoral college of the Empire? In a role similar to that of the King of Bohemia? \"The King of Bohemia, who was in fact not a prince of the Empire but a neighbouring and independent monarch, might vote at an imperial election, but was allowed on no other occasion to meddle in the affairs of the Empire.\" The members of the college were not formalized to just 7 people until the 13th century. We can have the college take a different course and include more allies of the Empire and members of the German nobility.\n\nA greater electoral college seems desirable. And I like the idea of the Danish monarch having a seat there. How large do you think we could make the electoral college at most?\n\nI would place the marriage of his parents c. 1044, when they are both in their mid-20s at most. The couple at first have a couple of daughters, then Harald IV is born c. 1048. He is 18-years-old when his father rises to the throne in 1066. Meaning that Harald gets to be involved in the politics of the reign. Magnus I enjoys a peaceful reign but succumbs to a disease c. 1078. A 30-year-old Harald IV rises to the throne and is allowed to pursue his own policies. (I wanted to avoid an overly young and inexperienced king or a middle-aged and tired one. Leaving open the options for what kind of king Magnus turns out to be).\n\nThen all of the above is decided!\n\nAs for marital alliances for Harald, I'd suggest looking for closer relations with Denmark, Sweden, Munster, or Kiev. These four kingdoms seem to have served as the main source of spouses for Norwegian monarchs between c. 1050 and c. 1150.\n\nI say, let's go with Munster. I've been consciously postponing dealing with the Irish situation for far too long now! Ireland will now be highest priority (I'm gonna have to reread your original post on what the Irish situation was like in the 11th century and how the butterflies will affect it, expect more commentary later on).\n\nHarald Hardrada was born c. 1015, Alexios Komnenos was born c. 1056. Harald was old enough to be Alexios' father, rather than son-in-law.\n\nI fear you misunderstood me, the intended meaning was that Alexios may wish to marry one of Harald's daughters, thus becoming Harald's son-in-law.\n\nBut Harald did have a Byzantine mistress named Maria. Supposedly a niece of empress Zoe but the relationship is in doubt. Zoe's only two siblings were childless. She might have been instead a maternal relative of the Empress. Or perhaps a niece-in-law, through one of Zoe's three marriages. [...]\n\nIf Harald is allowed to marry this Maria, he can stay in Constantinople and further serve Constantine IX Monomachos in military campaigns. He might rise to become \"prōtomanglabitēs (πρωτομαγγλαβίτης, \"first manglabitēs\") or epi tou manglabiou (ἐπί τοῦ μαγγλαβίου, \"in charge of the manglabion\")\", chief bodyguard to the Augustus/Augusta. Or rise from Spatharokandidatos to higher dignities.\n\nAll of that seems like wonderful ideas! Let's go with it. Now what position should Harald advance to?\n\n*Proedros. Literally \"President\", since holders were the Presiding officers of the Byzantine Senate. The senior non-imperial title available to males. There was only one such man at any point in time during the Macedonian dynasty, who reserved the title for eunuchs. Holders often were Prime Ministers in all but name. The Doukai and Komnenoi devalued the title by granting it to more people and opening it to the aristocracy.\n\n*Kouropalates. Literally \"the one one in charge of the palace\", roughly equivalent to \"majordomo\". Originally reserved for members of the imperial family, and key allies to the Emperors. Most notably the rulers of Caucasian Iberia (Georgia) and Armenia. The Komnenoi devalued the title, but mostly replaced it with their own version, Sebastos/Sebaste (Venerable One, Augustus/Augusta). The title and variations of it were originally reserved for members of the wider imperial family and closely allied aristocrats. Notably the King of Georgia, the Duke of Naples, the Doge of Venice, and the Sultan of Rum. The title signified imperial favorites, and not all family members automatically qualified.\n\nWhile my first choice would have been Proedros, President of the Senate, I like the idea of having that office preserved only for eunuchs. And I doubt that Harald's political ambitions extends as far as to cutting off the family jewels. So, he can't be given that position.\n\nKouropalates, or majordomo on the other hand, seems perfect. married to a niece of Empress Zoe and of royal Norwegian blood as well, we could easily have him become considered a close ally of the imperial family. Allowing him to have that position, we can then allow many of his and Maria's descendants get the position as well, becoming close allies of the Komnenos family.\n\nSeeing then that such an alliance would be well-cemented by having Alexios marry a daughter of Maria and Harald, what do you propose we name this daughter, the wife of Alexios of Antioch?\n\nSome other things, seeing that I'm the kind of person who loves details, would be to wonder if we could bring coffee drinking up the the imperial court in Constantinople? The imperial Rhomaioi bureaucrats seems like the guys who deserves a drink with some caffeine in it, seeing how stressed they must be and how intricate their assignments must be...\n\nFrom wikipedia, I read the following: “The earliest mention of coffee noted by the literary coffee merchant Philippe Sylvestre Dufour is a reference to bunchum in the works of the 10th century CE Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi, known as Rhazes in the West, but more definite information on the preparation of a beverage from the roasted coffee berries dates from several centuries later.” See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_coffee.\n\nI suggest that we have the Rhomaioi merchants around the Yemenite coast be the ones who begin roasting the coffee beans and drink the final beverage, thus refining the process of making bunchum. Bunchum can then make its way up to the Med in just a few short years and become a popular drink at the court once it obtains the Emperor's blessing. The Rhomaioi Emperor is after that keen to have bunchum together with his generals when discussing military matters and with the bureaucrats, senators and noblemen when discussing administrative matters. And after a hard day's honest work, the bureaucrats all pop down to the merchants' quarters to have a nice cup of bunchum.\n\nFinal little thing would be a hint towards Mormonism in having the medieval Jews come over to the Americas. According to the Book of Mormon, the first Jews (actually, to be completely accurate, they are Ephraimites and Manassehites, seeing they are not of the tribe of Judah) to come to the Americas is the family of Lehi, among whom his son Nephi is the most prominent figure. So I was wondering, can we, just as another humorous reference call the rabbi leading the first Jewish congregation across the seas to Vinland something similar? The name Lehi appears in the Bible, but then as a place rather than an individual, see: http://www.biblicalproportions.com/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=2826. Unless we're willing to accept the Book of Mormon as a historical document, we will have problems making the case that a Jew would actually be named Lehi. Still, Levi sounds close enough. Additionally, there's the name Nephi. Though most Hebrew linguists are in consensus that Nephi is not an ancient Hebrew name, scholars at Brigham Young University have suggested that it could be a Hebrewification of the (common) Egyptian name Nefer, see: http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/jbms/?vol=1&num=1&id=12. Still, I suggest that we should adhere to mainstream opinion in this case: it would be unlikely that an 11th century Jew would be named Nephi. However, from my own perusals of the Bible, I was stunned to discover that a similar name, Zephi, actually does occur, in 1 Chronicles 1:36. I would therefore suggest that as a nod to Mormonism, we name the rabbi leading the first Jews to Vinland Zephi ben-Levi. What would you think?\n\nAbout the names in the Komnenoid dynasty. I would have the descendants of Isaac II Komnenos be somewhat more keen on recalling the Rhomaioi's Roman heritage, and thus begin to use ancient Roman imperial names for their sons. Raphael will thus name his son Titus II (rather than Theodosius).\n\nProblematic, considering that Titus I destroyed the Temple in Jerusalem? Not necessarily. The historian Josephus wrote that Titus did in fact not want to see the Temple fall, but that this was an accident (other chroniclers disagree). If the Komnenoids adhere to Josephus, this is not a problem. We could perhaps have the Komnenoids regard Titus as merely being an instrument of God, fulfilling the prophecy of the Lord scattering the Jews (after all, aren't they praying in the Synagogue of Satan?).\n\nWell, I've been looking into the possibility of the Aesirskagians building stone walls, and frankly, it does not look too good. The best comparable architectural feat would be the city wall of Visby on Gotland, which was constructed mainly in the 13th century, with one tower dating back to the 12th (it was originally named the lamb tower but has since, surprisingly enough, been renamed the gunpowder tower). In the early 13th century, they manage to build one as high as 5 metres, in the late 13th century being rebuilt even higher.\n\nI think they would have the capacity to build a few fortified watchtowers, but as times go by, they'll demographically outgrow the Boethuk population, so that stone walls around settlements would be viewed as an unnecessary luxury.\n\nHowever, there exists an important difference between Visby and Gotland, namely, Gotland we subject to several conquests, as well as raids by Baltic pirates. Building a wall would have been a matter of priority for the Visbyans. I don't really think the Vinlanders would have any need to build such a wall at Aesirskagi, certainly not that early, unless they were subject of constant raids or attacks. Now it is certainly possible that the Havenusanir have acquired Norse shipbuilding designs in their own trading networks in the Great Lakes, but by the time they get this far, either the Great Peacemaker or Hiawatha are at power, and I expect them to be too smart to start systematically raiding Vinland. No need to wake a sleeping giant.\n\nEven two hundred years in, the Vinlanders are going to be dominant on the water. Drekkar ships would be reborn in the New World.\n\nBy the late 1400's and after wars aplenty with both the nations of Europe and in competition with the increasingly formidable Havenusanir, stone walls around cities will become a necessity for the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Penavaskir (the Penobscot) I assume to initially have become victims to various raids for slaves by the Vinlanders, considering their geographical position, although later on these likely have become more and more rare, with the practice of slavery in Vinland itself declining. In any case, I doubt that the Penavaskir will be as advanced technologically as their Havenusanir cousins in the 12th century, and though they may have a grudge against the Vinlanders, they have neither the manpower nor the ships to pose a threat to the city of Aesirskagi even nearly great enough to justify the construction of such a great wall. I mean, the Penavaskir lives in OTL Maine. They may on land attack settlements in Vinland (OTL New Brunswick and Nova Scotia) but to go all the way up to Aesirskagi in Markland (Newfoundland) frequent enough to pose a threat if at all? You'd need an alien space bat to provide them with bazookas for that to be possible.\n\nSpeaking of them, unless you have other plans for their future, the Penavaskir could become the victims of later territorial expansion from Vinland down the road, given how close they are. The city of Bangor in Maine is widely believed to be situated on the site of the legendary city of Norumbega on the Penobscot River. Bangor in OTL was called once the \"lumber capital of the world\". Certainly, raiding deep in the interior for slaves would drive many communities inland.\n\nThe truth is, there are nobody posing an active threat to the inhabitants of Aesirskagi. With annoyance, I have to concede the point to you, Lysandros. There is no logical reason for the Aesirskagians to invest the manpower and resources necessary to construct such fortifications around the city. We can still be optimistic and say that during the early days the Aesirskagians, freshly emerged from having dealth with the local Skrælings, may have found it prudent to construct a couple (less than five) towers around their settlements in stone over a few decades for maximum security, but little (if anything) more. And then we're being nice to them.\n\nHowever! ...Aesirskagi has one important advantage that will make it easier for the Crusaders to defend it! See, we have positioned Aesirskagi to correspond OTL St. John's on the Avalon Peninsula, which will be easier for the Crusaders to defend. They already have the ships necessary to patrol the coasts, the only place where fortifications and the positioning of land-based troops will be necessary is the narrow piece of land that connects the peninsula to the Markland mainland. Right there, the Crusaders have been given a significant advantage when it comes to keeping and defending their settlement.\n\nTrue. The crusaders are going to take what advantage could be gained by the native geography. Most of their ships will have to ring the harbour to prevent any Vinlander squadrons from retrieving the city, while a few ships will explore the coastline for easy-pickings in terms of food sources.\n\nI would actually expect to have Asaism gain its enduring shape and form concurrently with the compilation of the Canonic Sagas (like with early Christianity and the Council of Nicaea). Anyway, Seidmen will undoubtedly play an important role in writing down and interpreting passages, and there will be a lot of conferencing with the visions of völvas, as well as having the galds and göthi present the “historical” records for the composition.\n\nLooks good.\n\nWell, it wouldn't actually be that farfetched, would it, seeing that animism endured for centuries after the Christianisation process in the Scandinavian countries in our timeline, with people seriously worrying about trolls breaking in to replace farmers' children with their own and gnomes killing their livestock. Euhemerism too was amazingly long-lived in Scandinavia. Right up until the 19th century, scholars insisted that Odin and Thor really had been actual historical characters that had enjoyed significant mythologization.\n\nI expect they'll be some heated discussions down the line between Asaist and Christian theologians from Scandinavians about the validity of the Aesir.\n\nThe Kievan threat to the east remains credible as long as Finland remains Kievan territory and there is a significant Kievan navy in the Baltic. It will also be worrisome to see the Kievans find more and more influence thanks to their alliance with the Rhomaioi. Point 2 I believe can be handled easily by the mechanism behind point 1. Part 3 is the interesting thing, and here I agree with you there is a problem. The Confederacy may stand in its original form for two, maybe even three centuries, but eventually it will either collapse back into two or three separate nations, or, they will all be joined together under a single monarch.\n\nSurrounded by the Holy Roman Empire, the Kievan Rus and the Scandinavian Confederacy, I wonder how long Lithuania, Prussia, Estonia and Latvia will hold out against the Christianization from these states?\n\nI say, let's go with Munster. I've been consciously postponing dealing with the Irish situation for far too long now! Ireland will now be highest priority (I'm gonna have to reread your original post on what the Irish situation was like in the 11th century and how the butterflies will affect it, expect more commentary later on).\n\nSeeing as how the OTL Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland at the behest of King Henry II Plantagenet and Pope Adrian IV has been rippled away, would Ireland still end up as an English province? Or would they look to the growing Scandinavian powers for to help preserve the independence of the Irish kingdoms?\n\nFinal little thing would be a hint towards Mormonism in having the medieval Jews come over to the Americas. According to the Book of Mormon, the first Jews (actually, to be completely accurate, they are Ephraimites and Manassehites, seeing they are not of the tribe of Judah) to come to the Americas is the family of Lehi, among whom his son Nephi is the most prominent figure. So I was wondering, can we, just as another humorous reference call the rabbi leading the first Jewish congregation across the seas to Vinland something similar? The name Lehi appears in the Bible, but then as a place rather than an individual, see: http://www.biblicalproportions.com/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=2826. Unless we're willing to accept the Book of Mormon as a historical document, we will have problems making the case that a Jew would actually be named Lehi. Still, Levi sounds close enough. Additionally, there's the name Nephi. Though most Hebrew linguists are in consensus that Nephi is not an ancient Hebrew name, scholars at Brigham Young University have suggested that it could be a Hebrewification of the (common) Egyptian name Nefer, see: http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/jbms/?vol=1&num=1&id=12. Still, I suggest that we should adhere to mainstream opinion in this case: it would be unlikely that an 11th century Jew would be named Nephi. However, from my own perusals of the Bible, I was stunned to discover that a similar name, Zephi, actually does occur, in 1 Chronicles 1:36. I would therefore suggest that as a nod to Mormonism, we name the rabbi leading the first Jews to Vinland Zephi ben-Levi. What would you think?\n\nInteresting that you bring that up. The first Jewish settlers might originate from the ShUM-cities (Mainz, Speyer and Worms) of Germany.\n\nAfter Iceland develops a more solid reputation for commerce, coupled with the stories of how they successfully resisted the royal Norwegian attempt to Christianize them, some Yiddish-speaking merchants from the German cities and the County of Flanders buy passage to Iceland and establish a presence at the location of the Thingvellir. Meeting with Norse merchants from Markland on their annual business trips to Iceland, they learn of the colony's existence. A few interested in the business opportunities would accept an invite to sail west on the Vinland knarrs. By the following summer, news of the vast tracts of land and, the indigenous plants and animals and the hospitality of the settlers there and the relatively good life they have would be welcome news. It could still take at least another decade for enough Jews migrating to Iceland to appreciate the notion of sailing westward across an ocean before the followers of a Zephi ben Levi would settle Vinland in there hundreds.\n\nWould this Zephi fellow be a rabbi or a merchant? Because I don't know whether it was or is permissible to serve in both vocations.\n\nAlright, then, Byzantine's original post on 11th century Ireland, its kingdoms and its royalty, along with my commentary:\n\nIreland probably had no actual High King in the 1020s. Though the title was most likely used by Donnchad mac Briain, King of Munster (reigned c. 1025-1064), it is uncertain whether he managed to extend his authority over the other Kings.\n\nSigtrygg Silkbeard was only the King of Dublin (reigned c. 995-1036). [...] The 1020s were a difficult time for Sigtrygg. His army was defeated by the forces of Leinster in 1021. His fleet was destroyed by the forces of the Ulaid in 1022. Dublin became vulnerable and was forced to politically submit and offer hostages to other Kingdoms. To the King of Ailech in 1025, and to the King of Munster in 1026. Making Dublin a contested area between two powerful kingdoms. While the Ulaid continued leading raids into Dublin's areas. In 1027, an attempt to ally with Brega against Meath backfired. Resulting in heavy casualties for the forces of Dublin. In 1029, a new King of Brega turned against Dublin. Managing to capture Sigtrygg's heir and demanding a royal ransom to release him.\n\nIn the 1030s, the alliance with Canute and the plunder from Wales allowed Dublin to restore its military might. Defeating several rival kings.\n\nThe butterflies then reaches Ireland at the latest in the 1030s. Established.\n\nIn Wales itself, the invasions from Dublin probably undermined the authority of Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig, Prince of Gwynned (reigned c. 1023-1039). Theoretically Iago was the most powerful ruler in Wales, but he failed to defend his own territory. He was eventually killed by his own soldiers. The throne was then offered to Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (reigned 1039-1063).\n\nGryfydd started his reign by annilhilating an invasion force from Mercia,and then leading his own invasion into Dehuebarth. By 1055, Gryfydd managed to unite the whole of Wales under his control. He was King of Gwynedd, Powys, Deheubarth, Gwent, and Morgannwg. He started styling himself \"King of Wales\". He celebrated his success by leading new invasions into England. He sacked the city of Hereford in 1056, and was a major enemy to Edward the Confessor. However his reign ended when Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex (term 1053-1066) led a counter-invasion into Wales. Gryffydd himself was killed and his kingdom divided among rival kings. Harold himself claimed Gryfydd's widow as his new wife. The success made Harold the most successful Entglish general and opened the way for his usurpation of the English throne in 1066.\n\nClearly, the butterflies are gonna have frakked up Welsh and Irish history quite a lot compared to our timeline as early as about fifty years into the 11th century.\n\nIn a timeline with no Canute, there are only two options for Sigtrygg. 1) He may seek an alliance with England anyway, seeing it as his only chance to restore his kingdom. If so the invasions into Wales still take place 2) He may stay devoid of allies and the target for several other Irish kingdoms. Eventually some ambitious ruler may decide to fully annex Dublin. The Kingdom of Mide/Meath and the Kingdom of Leinster would be the most likely to attempt this, due to being the neighbours of the Kingdom of Dublin. In the original timeline, Dublin was annexed by Leinster in 1171. In the new timeline the event may take place 140 years earlier.\n\nOption no. 2 seems most likely. The Wessexers have been quite busy recently simply trying to defend their own rule against Danish and Scottish invasions. Expansion isn't as much on the agenda as mere endurance. Leinster thus takes Dublin in either the 1030s or 1040s (whichever you two would consider most likely).\n\nIn Wales, the lack of foreign invasions in the 1030s may help Iago stabilize his hold over Gwynedd, preventing the rise of Gryfydd and the unification of Wales. Instead of Welsh invasions into England, we might have the Earls of Mercia leading invasions into Wales in the 1040s.\n\nSounds reasonable.\n\nThough I am not sure who would be Earl of Mercia at the time. In the original timeline Eadric Streona was Ealdorman of Mercia from 1007 to 1017. His early death resulted in an unrelated figure becoming Earl of Mercia: Leofric (c. 1017/1030-1057). [...] Leofric was the Earl of Mercia who appears heavily involved in Welsh events. In the new timeline Eadric doesn't die in the 1010s and Leofric might never rise to power. He might instead replace his father as Ealdorman of Hwicce, a less prestigious position.\n\nAgain, reasonable, so let's go with that. Are we then to have Eadric's descendants remain Earls of Mercia?\n\nWhat happens in Wales would probably result from the policies that the surviving Iago and Eadric decide to pursue. We might even see the two fighting against each other for a while.\n\nIf both are ambitious and expansionist, then such a course is inevitable. How would you propose that this plays out?\n\nMoving back to the Jewish immigration to the Commonwealth...\n\nInteresting that you bring that up. The first Jewish settlers might originate from the ShUM-cities (Mainz, Speyer and Worms) of Germany.\n\nAfter Iceland develops a more solid reputation for commerce, coupled with the stories of how they successfully resisted the royal Norwegian attempt to Christianize them, some Yiddish-speaking merchants from the German cities and the County of Flanders buy passage to Iceland and establish a presence at the location of the Thingvellir. Meeting with Norse merchants from Markland on their annual business trips to Iceland, they learn of the colony's existence. A few interested in the business opportunities would accept an invite to sail west on the Vinland knarrs. By the following summer, news of the vast tracts of land and, the indigenous plants and animals and the hospitality of the settlers there and the relatively good life they have would be welcome news. It could still take at least another decade for enough Jews migrating to Iceland to appreciate the notion of sailing westward across an ocean before the followers of a Zephi ben Levi would settle Vinland in there hundreds.\n\nWould this Zephi fellow be a rabbi or a merchant? Because I don't know whether it was or is permissible to serve in both vocations.\n\nGood you brought that up (I'm quite illiterate as far as 11th century German Jewish practices are concerned, good you are able to see potential problems come up in advance).\n\nZephi would be a rabbi, seeing as that is the best position to lead a larger group of Jews to travel further to Vinland. Zephi would undoubtedly be well-connected with the Icelandic merchants, and it is through that road that he manages to engineer the further emigration to Markland (Newfoundland) where he founds Nýjorsala. Seeing that there probably aren't too many Jews in Iceland even per the most optimistic estimates, I would assume that Zephi is the only rabbi in all of Reykjavik. His father, whom I suggest we call Levi ben-Ephraim, could have been the rabbi leading the first Jews to Iceland. If the whole Icelandic-resistance-proves-successful occurs in the 1020s, then what is the earliest date we can place a reasonably large Jewish congregation in Reykjavik who under rabbi Zephi takes it upon them to travel further to Markland?\n\nAnd some more things:\n\nSurrounded by the Holy Roman Empire, the Kievan Rus and the Scandinavian Confederacy, I wonder how long Lithuania, Prussia, Estonia and Latvia will hold out against the Christianization from these states?\n\nSounds like we are looking at a race for religion. Who is to win the devotion and loyalty of the Baltics? The Patriarch of Constantinople or the Bishop of Rome?\n\nSeeing as how the OTL Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland at the behest of King Henry II Plantagenet and Pope Adrian IV has been rippled away, would Ireland still end up as an English province? Or would they look to the growing Scandinavian powers for to help preserve the independence of the Irish kingdoms?\n\nHrm... Gonna have to wait with that until the Irish 11th century situation has been cleared up.\n\nI think they would have the capacity to build a few fortified watchtowers, but as times go by, they'll demographically outgrow the Boethuk population, so that stone walls around settlements would be viewed as an unnecessary luxury. [...]\n\nTrue. The crusaders are going to take what advantage could be gained by the native geography. Most of their ships will have to ring the harbour to prevent any Vinlander squadrons from retrieving the city, while a few ships will explore the coastline for easy-pickings in terms of food sources.\n\nGlad we're in consensus on that! Four or five stone towers around Aesirskagi, to keep an eye at the sea it is then, along with a ring of ships patrolling the peninsula's coast, keeping it clear from attacks!\n\nThe question then becomes, how successful would the Crusaders be in finding any food at all? Are there any places they could get hold on some grain and some livestock. To survive those Crusaders are gonna need more than just fish...\n\nEven two hundred years in, the Vinlanders are going to be dominant on the water. Drekkar ships would be reborn in the New World.\n\nBy the late 1400's and after wars aplenty with both the nations of Europe and in competition with the increasingly formidable Havenusanir, stone walls around cities will become a necessity for the Commonwealth.\n\nGood to keep in mind later on...\n\nSpeaking of them, unless you have other plans for their future, the Penavaskir could become the victims of later territorial expansion from Vinland down the road, given how close they are. The city of Bangor in Maine is widely believed to be situated on the site of the legendary city of Norumbega on the Penobscot River. Bangor in OTL was called once the \"lumber capital of the world\". Certainly, raiding deep in the interior for slaves would drive many communities inland.\n\nHaven't really thought that much about the Penavaskir, seeing they do not have as much potential as the Havenusanir. Territorial expansion though, would seem like a natural consequence of a Vinlandic population boom. I pity the Penavaskir, so far away from God, yet so close to Vinland...\n\nI expect they'll be some heated discussions down the line between Asaist and Christian theologians from Scandinavians about the validity of the Aesir.\n\nHadn't really thought about that. Interfaith dialogues in the distant future will certainly be more interesting.\n\nOne more final (albeit possibly controversial) idea I would have would be that there would be a forest in Vinland named Draumblómi, the Old Norse translation of Dreamflower, as that is what Lothlórien means in Sindarin. We could have the Draumblómi Forest be considered a sacred forest by the Asaists, with seidmen and göthis travelling there for deep meditation and to feel close to the Gods. We could otherwise place it among the Finnish settlement and get the (arguably) more aesthetically pleasing Unikukka Forest. Similarly, the original name of Minas Tirith in the universe of Tolkien's design was Minas Anor, the Tower of the Setting Sun, which in Norse would be Sólbjørggnæfa (I have to give it to Prof. Tolkien, he came up with some rather supremely beautiful languages, Sólbjørggnæfa doesn't sound nearly as beautiful as Minas Anor). Anyway, seeing that the sun sets in the west, Sólbjørggnæfa could be the westernmost settlement on the island of Markland. There could then also be other places in the Commonwealth with similar names to places in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth.\n\nThe more doctrinally permissible Holy Roman Catholic Church can surely deal with that reasonably. A century or so, with a pope intrigued by divination can open up the legalisation and acceptance of such practices.\n\nWell, this would require open-minded Popes or ones with a personal interest in occultism to keep being elected. On a related subject I would like to keep the Medieval attitude on magic instead of the Renaissance one. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_trial#Middle_Ages and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_trials_in_Early_Modern_Europe#History\n\nMedieval: \"The Council of Paderborn in 785 explicitly outlawed the very belief in witches, and Charlemagne later confirmed the law. The Council of Frankfurt in 794, called by Charlemagne, was also very explicit in condemning \"the persecution of alleged witches and wizards\", calling the belief in witchcraft \"superstitious\", and ordering the death penalty for those who presume to burn witches.\"\n\nRenaissance: \". Pope John XXII had authorized the Inquisition to prosecute sorcerers in 1320, but inquisitorial courts became systematically involved in witch-hunts only in the 15th century. In the case of the Madonna Oriente, the Inquisition of Milan was not sure what to do with two women who in 1384 and in 1390 confessed to have participated in a type of white magic. A major public figure who helped pave the way for the explosion of the later Witch Craze of Renaissance Europe was popular Franciscan preacher, Bernardino of Siena (1380–1444), whose vociferous, incessant, and widely-circulating sermons against witches, witchcraft, and superstition, not only spread the belief in the reality of witches as an organized subversive band of demon-worshippers but also frightened the populations into taking extreme measures against all suspected witches. Bernardino's extensive pages on the topic of witches and witchcraft are valuable primary sources into the history of these phenomena.\"\n\n**\"In 1484 Pope Innocent VIII issued Summis desiderantes affectibus, a Papal bull authorizing two inquisitors, Kramer and Sprenger, to systemize the persecution of witches. As a result, the notorious Malleus Maleficarum was published in 1487, at the very end of the medieval period, ushering in the period of witch hunts in Early Modern Europe which would last for the following two centuries.\"\n\n\"The beginning of the witch-hunts as a phenomenon in its own right become apparent during the first half of the 15th century in south-eastern France and western Switzerland, in communities of the Western Alps, in what was at the time Burgundy and Savoy. Here, the cause of eliminating the supposed Satanic witches from society was taken up by a number of individuals; Claude Tholosan for instance had tried over two hundred people accusing them of witchcraft in Briançon, Dauphiné by 1420. Soon, the idea of identifying and prosecuting witches spread throughout the neighbouring areas of northern Italy, Switzerland and southern Germany, and it was at Basel that the Council of Basel assembled from 1431 to 1437. This Church Council, which had been attended by such anti-witchcraft figures as Johann Nider and Martin Le Franc, helped to standardise the stereotype of the Satanic witch that would be propagated throughout the rest of the trials. Following the meeting of the Council and the increase in the trials around this area of central Europe, the idea that malevolent Satanic witches were operating against Christendom began spreading throughout much of the Holy Roman Empire and several adjacent areas.\"\n\n\"According to historian Robert Thurston, \"From this heart of persecution the witch stereotype spread, both through a flood of new writings on the subject and through men who had been at the Council of Basel and now went elsewhere to take up new assignments in the church.\" The most notable of these works was published in 1486, written by the German Dominican monk, Heinrich Kramer—allegedly aided by Jacob Sprenger—known as the Malleus Malificarum (The Hammer of the Witches) in which they set down the stereotypical image of the Satanic witch and prescribed torture as a means of interrogating suspects. The Malleus Malificarum was reprinted in twenty-nine editions up till 1669.\"\n\n\"On December 5, 1484, Pope Innocent VIII issued the Summis desiderantes affectibus, a papal bull in which he recognized the existence of witches and gave full papal approval for the inquisition to move against witches, including the permission to do whatever necessary to get rid of them. In the bull, which is sometimes referred to as the \"Witch-Bull of 1484\", the witches were explicitly accused of having \"slain infants yet in the mother's womb\" (abortion) and of \"hindering men from performing the sexual act and women from conceiving\" (contraception).\"\n\nThe Renaissance was in general noted for its intolerance towards minorities and for a gradual decline in the political and social position of women. ... \"Many historians now point out that most of the negative social factors popularly associated with the medieval period – poverty, warfare, religious and political persecution, for example – seem to have worsened in this era which saw the rise of Machiavelli, the Wars of Religion, the corrupt Borgia Popes, and the intensified witch-hunts of the 16th century. Many people who lived during the Renaissance did not view it as the \"golden age\" imagined by certain 19th-century authors, but were concerned by these social maladies.\" See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance#Debates_about_progress\n\nA greater electoral college seems desirable. And I like the idea of the Danish monarch having a seat there. How large do you think we could make the electoral college at most?\n\nI haven't really though of its size, but I would envision positions for the following influential leaders:\n\n*Count of Holland. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_Holland\n\n*Count of Luxembourg. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monarchs_of_Luxembourg\n\n*Duke of Bavaria. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rulers_of_Bavaria\n\n*Duke of Carinthia. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Carinthia#Dukes_of_Carinthia\n\n*Duke of Lower Lorraine/Duke of Upper Lorraine. Perhaps we can have the Duchy reunified. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Lower_Lorraine#Dukes_of_Lorraine\n\n*Duke of Saxony. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Saxony\n\n*Duke of Swabia. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Swabia\n\n*Margrave of Austria. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rulers_of_Austria\n\n*Margrave of Carniola. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_Carniola#List_of_margraves\n\nWhile my first choice would have been Proedros, President of the Senate, I like the idea of having that office preserved only for eunuchs. And I doubt that Harald's political ambitions extends as far as to cutting off the family jewels. So, he can't be given that position. ... Kouropalates, or majordomo on the other hand, seems perfect. married to a niece of Empress Zoe and of royal Norwegian blood as well, we could easily have him become considered a close ally of the imperial family. Allowing him to have that position, we can then allow many of his and Maria's descendants get the position as well, becoming close allies of the Komnenos family.\n\nSeeing then that such an alliance would be well-cemented by having Alexios marry a daughter of Maria and Harald, what do you propose we name this daughter, the wife of Alexios of Antioch?\n\nHow about Zoe, after her aunt? This would allow these line of Fairhair and Komnenoi to emphasize their connection to the Macedonian dynasty, disregarding the fact that Maria is probably not a direct descendant of the Macedonian emperors.\n\nSome other things, seeing that I'm the kind of person who loves details, would be to wonder if we could bring coffee drinking up the the imperial court in Constantinople? The imperial Rhomaioi bureaucrats seems like the guys who deserves a drink with some caffeine in it, seeing how stressed they must be and how intricate their assignments must be...... I suggest that we have the Rhomaioi merchants around the Yemenite coast be the ones who begin roasting the coffee beans and drink the final beverage, thus refining the process of making bunchum. Bunchum can then make its way up to the Med in just a few short years and become a popular drink at the court once it obtains the Emperor's blessing. The Rhomaioi Emperor is after that keen to have bunchum together with his generals when discussing military matters and with the bureaucrats, senators and noblemen when discussing administrative matters. And after a hard day's honest work, the bureaucrats all pop down to the merchants' quarters to have a nice cup of bunchum.\n\nInteresting idea. The introduction of coffee to (Christian) Europe was originally a result of intense trade in the Eastern Mediterranean. If we can have the trade start earlier, we can have coffee and other goods spread faster. Accelerating the historical process. \"The vibrant trade between Venice and the Muslims in North Africa, Egypt, and the East brought a large variety of African goods, including coffee, to this leading European port. Venetian merchants introduced coffee-drinking to the wealthy in Venice, charging them heavily for the beverage. In this way, coffee was introduced to Europe. Coffee became more widely accepted after controversy over whether it was acceptable for Catholics to consume was settled in its favor by Pope Clement VIII in 1600, despite appeals to ban the drink. The first European coffee house (apart from those in the Ottoman Empire, mentioned above) was opened in Venice in 1645.\" See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_coffee#Europe\n\nThe name Lehi appears in the Bible, but then as a place rather than an individual\n\nNo surprise there. In the story of Samson, \"Ramath-lehi\" means \"Hill/Height of the Jawbone\". Since Ramath does mean \"hill\", \"height\" in several other texts, this leaves Lehi translated to \"Jawbone\". Rather unusual for a name.\n\nAdditionally, there's the name Nephi. Though most Hebrew linguists are in consensus that Nephi is not an ancient Hebrew name, scholars at Brigham Young University have suggested that it could be a Hebrewification of the (common) Egyptian name Nefer\n\nI don't know its etymology, but the name Nephi turns up in the Second Book of Maccabees. \"So when this matter was known, it was told the king of Persia, that in the place, where the priests that were led away had hid the fire, there appeared water, and that Neemias had purified the sacrifices therewith. Then the king, inclosing the place, made it holy, after he had tried the matter. And the king took many gifts, and bestowed thereof on those whom he would gratify. And Neemias called this thing Naphthar, which is as much as to say, a cleansing: but many men call it Nephi.\" The term is rendered Nephthar, and Nephthai in other editions. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Maccabees and http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/2_Maccabees#Chapter_1 and http://eastonsbibledictionary.com/nephthai.htm\n\nIt has been suggested that Naphthar, Nephi, Nephthar, and Nephthai are all cotrrupted forms of the same term: Naphtha. \"The second book of the Maccabees in the Septuagint, part of the Old Testament canon in some Christian denominations, uses the word \"naphtha\" to refer to a miraculous flammable liquid. This account says that Nehemiah and the levitical priests associated with him called the liquid \"nephthar,\" meaning \"purification,\" but \"most people\" call it naphtha.\" See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naphtha#Etymology\n\nAs for Nefer, it literally means \"beauty\" or \"Beautiful on the inside and the outside\". It turns up more often as part of feminine names, though rare occasions of masculine use have been noted. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefer\n\nHowever, from my own perusals of the Bible, I was stunned to discover that a similar name, Zephi, actually does occur, in 1 Chronicles 1:36. I would therefore suggest that as a nod to Mormonism, we name the rabbi leading the first Jews to Vinland Zephi ben-Levi. What would you think?\n\nZephi seems to be a minor figure, a son of Eliphaz. The lineage given is Zephi, son of Eliphaz, son of Esau, son of Isaac, son of Abraham. Good enough for me, though the name might reflect Edomite ancestry. Since Esau is the legendary ancestor of the Edomites. Heh, this Zephi might even claim descent from the Herodian Dynasty. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edomites and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodian_Dynasty\n\nAbout the names in the Komnenoid dynasty. I would have the descendants of Isaac II Komnenos be somewhat more keen on recalling the Rhomaioi's Roman heritage, and thus begin to use ancient Roman imperial names for their sons. Raphael will thus name his son Titus II (rather than Theodosius).\n\nTitus was an extremely common Roman name and also the name of a significant Saint. I don't see a problem with reviving it. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_(praenomen) and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Titus\n\nAnyway, the emperor himself seems to have had a mostly positive reputation during the Renaissance. Dante Alighieri (c. 1265-1321) mentions in his Divine Comedy: \"Back in the days when good Titus, with the Highest King's help, avenged the wounds that shed the blood betrayed by Judas\". For a different translation of the same passage, see: http://books.google.com/books?id=-7...m=3&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Titus&f=false\n\nMore partial commentary:\n\nWell, this would require open-minded Popes or ones with a personal interest in occultism to keep being elected. On a related subject I would like to keep the Medieval attitude on magic instead of the Renaissance one. [...] The Renaissance was in general noted for its intolerance towards minorities and for a gradual decline in the political and social position of women. ... \"Many historians now point out that most of the negative social factors popularly associated with the medieval period – poverty, warfare, religious and political persecution, for example – seem to have worsened in this era which saw the rise of Machiavelli, the Wars of Religion, the corrupt Borgia Popes, and the intensified witch-hunts of the 16th century. Many people who lived during the Renaissance did not view it as the \"golden age\" imagined by certain 19th-century authors, but were concerned by these social maladies.\"\n\nWait a second, people in the Middle Ages were actually less superstitious than those in the Renaissance? That's new knowledge to me, as I would assume it also would be to many people. Quite counterintuitive, to be honest, as it would seem that otherwise when it came to this history of the witch hunts, that the witches and vampires only appeared where lack of education and knowledge prevailed. In light of what you just told me, you could almost argue that no actual Renaissance followed the medieval times, only a different Dark Age.\n\nAnyway, your proposition is highly appealing. So I agree that we should definitely go along with it, though I'd be intrigued were you to tell me what the consequences of keeping this general opinion in place. I would assume that since alchemy would not be equated to witchcraft, the alchemists could relax, but what would you have in mind?\n\nInteresting idea. The introduction of coffee to (Christian) Europe was originally a result of intense trade in the Eastern Mediterranean. If we can have the trade start earlier, we can have coffee and other goods spread faster. Accelerating the historical process. \"The vibrant trade between Venice and the Muslims in North Africa, Egypt, and the East brought a large variety of African goods, including coffee, to this leading European port. Venetian merchants introduced coffee-drinking to the wealthy in Venice, charging them heavily for the beverage. In this way, coffee was introduced to Europe. Coffee became more widely accepted after controversy over whether it was acceptable for Catholics to consume was settled in its favor by Pope Clement VIII in 1600, despite appeals to ban the drink. The first European coffee house (apart from those in the Ottoman Empire, mentioned above) was opened in Venice in 1645.\"\n\nPerhaps it's my Swedish heritage that makes me find the history of coffee so appealing. Though I am aware this could be apocrypha, it is said that coffee arrived in Sweden by the way of king Charles XII, who in his wars against the Russian Empire allied with the Ottomans and even travelled down to Turkish territory, where he developed a fondness for the drink. In broader history, it should be noted that the seemingly harmless, innocent coffeehouses were banned in several European countries at different times, with monarchs fearing that they fostered seditious and rebellious sentiments, and that by outlawing them, the monarchs did not need to fear insurrections or revolutions.\n\nThis does of course, to any sane individual, sound ridiculous. How could coffee possibly be blamed for insurrections? But believe it or not, at the beginning of the Libyan civil war, Ghaddafi quite frankly blamed drugs in Nescafé for the dissatisfaction with his regime.\n\nIn any case, coffee actually did play a larger role in history than intuitively assumed, so I'd say it would only be prudent that it'd be given some attention in this timeline as well.\n\nI guess Zephi would go down in history as the founder of Vinlandic Judaism as far as many people are concerned, but it would really be to the credit of the Jewish merchants that pave the way for their people's presence in the New World.\n\nIt would roughly be a decade after Iceland's defiance prevails over the demands of Norway before sailors from elsewhere in northern Europe gain a stronger presence in Iceland. Timber and furs may be a vital export from Markland to Iceland, but Maize, Squash (if prevalent in north-east America) and maybe exporting Turkey-fowl from Vestigard would draw further commercial interest to Iceland. The exotic vegetables reaching the ports of northern Europe and the stories of Iceland standing up to Norway would inspire a few Jews to check out if Iceland is a worthy refuge. The knowledge of Vinland/Markland would reach the foreign sailors shortly after they land. After a couple of years in Iceland, maybe 50-100 Jews reside in the country. After maybe 5-10 years, a couple hundred Jews have would chosen Iceland as their home for its relative freedom and its lack of taxation. During this time, some Jewsih merchants would have made a few crossings over to Vestigard and reported favourably on the situation there. Iceland would still be a raw spot for a well-developed Jewish community to live, as yet without a Beth Din or Yeshivot, but Jews in Europe would have a positive opinion for the future there. And once in Iceland, many will take a year or two before deciding to move on to Markland after accounts of its existence are verified. Maybe twenty or thirty years after settling in Iceland, would a few boatloads of Jews make the trip westward.\n\nSeems like we are once again pretty much in consensus. My preliminary date for Jewish immigration to Vestigard at the inception of the idea was to have it commence during the 1070s, though I expected this decade to be a bit optimistic. However, such as you describe it, it could actually work: Jews start coming to Iceland in the mid-1050s, the first Jewish settlers arriving at the coast of Markland in the late 1070s/early 1080s.\n\nWhat interests me about this is how long they, the native Pagan Balt kingdoms and tribes, can resist the onslaught of crusades. These would be the last source of the final waves of migrating Pagans from northern Europe to Vestigard. I'm wondering if like OTL, indigenous ethnic polytheism would endure, in all sections of native Baltic society, until the 1300-1400's.\n\nIn all honesty, I actually would doubt that. The pagans here, unlike the ones from our timeline, actually has a place to go when they feel threatened. Plus, they're surrounded by Christians eager to convert them to their branch of Christianity on all sides. They're gonna have a pretty shitty time with a lot more preaching and proselytising going on around them. The prospect of leaving the old family farm and travel to a new country far away may seem quite terrifying for these pagan peasants, but given enough pressure and reassurance about the tolerance on Iceland, and they'd be off.\n\nChristian apologist: \"Your gods were just mere mortals...our God is the true God. The father of creation!\"\n\nAsaist apologist: \"Your one god is the great deceiver. Loki will doom you all!\"\n\nSeems like we were thinking in pretty much the same way. It was my belief that the Vinlandic pagans would equate Vite Krist (as the Norse called Jesus) with Loki, the cunning deceiver. I've even sketched out a discussion this timeline's Leif Ericsson will have with the seidmann he's taking with him to Greenland about the matter.\n\nI think this may have been mentioned earlier, but during Norway's trade embargo on the Icelandic Commonwealth during the early 11th century, perhaps the one of the few nations in northern Europe to disregard Norway's sanctioning would be the Baltic Curonians from Courland. They were seafarers and pirates themselves much like the Vikings, working both alongside and in opposition against them, including Icelanders. The Oeselian merchants from Estonia also would ignore the Norwegian embargo on Iceland. Ties between these countries would be solid, if informal. If Maize is sold in Iceland during this time, then perhaps the Curonians and the Estonians would be the first to acquire them in Icelandic markets.\n\nNo, that has not been mentioned before, so I'm glad you brought it up.\n\nThat will certainly play well with Icelandic-Curonian-Oeselian foreign policy. However, I don't think maize will have reached Iceland as early as the 1020s. Rather, I estimate that it will first become used as a crop beginning in the 1050-1060s (at the earliest) after there has been some trading relations established with the Havenusanir. It would then reach Iceland a decade or so afterwards, where it would have to thrive for some period before emerging in Europe.\n\nOh, and by the way, Tolkien's inspiration for Theoden came from the Old English word þeoden, meaning “leader of a people”, and Thengel (in Lord of the Rings, the name of Theoden King's father) from þengel, meaning “king” or “prince.” A similar Old Norse word (with the same meaning, no less) to Old English þeoden would be þjóðann, and the word þengel exists in Old Norse as well, with the same spelling and meaning. So how about a lawspeaker named Þjóðann Þengelsson, a name that would actually be pronounced as Theoden Thengel's son? Because I like it.\n\nFinally, was there any interest in my far-fetched idea of producing clockwork medieval computers?\n\nWould it be possible to have computers develop long before the invention of steam engine and the discovery of electricity? It appears to me that all we need is an analytical engine of sorts that works by the same mechanism as medieval clockwork. For that to develop, we need difference engines. For that to develop, we need Jacquard looms. For that to develop we simply need to develop machines for weaving. Then, when electricity and steam engines finally comes along, there already exists computers at every important court in Europe (for bureaucratic purposes) as well as some monasteries and universities for mathematical studies.\n\nAgain I admit that what we are looking at is quite hard to produce, yet it should be conceivably possible. There were some surprisingly intricate clockworks around in the medieval Islamic world, and as any James Burke fan knows, there were furthermore several water-powered systems that had remarkably ambitious and impressive designs. I still believe that if we can only bring about into existence the Jacquard looms in the middle ages we are on our way. As usual per my ideas, we're looking at very long-term developments here. For the Jacquard looms to be developed we need to begin with having a large market for intricately detailed textiles emerging in Europe, which will then lead to some fellows beginning to wonder how to produce such things back in Europe and make some monies. And then if it is possible to produce mechanism allowing for that. Do you think that the trade with India and China could produce such a market and hence such a demand?\n\nWait a second, people in the Middle Ages were actually less superstitious than those in the Renaissance? That's new knowledge to me, as I would assume it also would be to many people.\n\nThese people tend to underestimate the mess that was the 14th century. Besides the severe drop in population in many countries, due to the Black Death in combination with a couple of major famines and overly enthusiastic use of the chevauchée as a combat tactic, we have the survivors fearing scared of their lives. A few turned to religion with more fervor and fanaticism than ever before, while others started seeking those responsible for their misery. More often than not, convenient scapegoats. As always, \"the sleep of reason begets monsters\". The cultural climate got more repressive.\n\nWikipedia summarizes some of the consequences. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequences_of_the_Black_Death#Persecutions\n\n\"Renewed religious fervor and fanaticism bloomed in the wake of the Black Death. Some Europeans targeted \"various groups such as Jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims\", lepers and Roma, thinking that they were to blame for the crisis. Lepers, and other individuals with skin diseases such as acne or psoriasis, were singled out and exterminated throughout Europe. Anyone with leprosy was believed to show an outward sign of a defect of the soul. Differences in cultural and lifestyle practices also led to persecution. Because Jews had a religious obligation to be ritually clean they did not use water from public wells and so were suspected of causing the plague by deliberately poisoning the wells. European mobs attacked Jewish settlements across Europe; by 1351, sixty major and 150 smaller Jewish communities had been destroyed, and more than 350 separate massacres had occurred.\" ... \"According to Joseph P. Byrne in his book, The Black Death, women also faced persecution during the Black Death.\"\n\nQuite counterintuitive, to be honest, as it would seem that otherwise when it came to this history of the witch hunts, that the witches and vampires only appeared where lack of education and knowledge prevailed. In light of what you just told me, you could almost argue that no actual Renaissance followed the medieval times, only a different Dark Age.\n\nWhile vampire and revenants legends have been recorded even in Summerian texts, there seem to have been no major \"vampire scares\" in Europe prior to the 17th and 18th century. \"During the 18th century, there was a frenzy of vampire sightings in Eastern Europe, with frequent stakings and grave diggings to identify and kill the potential revenants; even government officials engaged in the hunting and staking of vampires. Despite being called the Age of Enlightenment, during which most folkloric legends were quelled, the belief in vampires increased dramatically, resulting in a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe. The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg Monarchy from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities.\" See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire#Medieval_and_later_European_folklore\n\nAs for education killing superstition, what do you make of Antoine Augustin Calmet (1672-1757)? Famous teacher of theology, philosophy and in-depth Biblical studies. And also the first major author on the subject of vampires. \"Dom Augustine Calmet, a well-respected French theologian and scholar, put together a comprehensive treatise in 1746, which was ambiguous concerning the existence of vampires. Calmet amassed reports of vampire incidents; numerous readers, including both a critical Voltaire and supportive demonologists, interpreted the treatise as claiming that vampires existed.\" I often find the argument that without Culmet, the vampire legends might have simply died out.\n\n\"Calmet had read most of the interviews with people in parts of Eastern Europe concerning the strigoii and was impressed with them. He thought it unreasonable to dismiss themm completely out of hand as Davanzati had done. Besides, such walking dead would have theological implications for the belief in an afterlife.\" See: http://books.google.com/books?id=lK...age&q=Antoine Augustin Calmet vampire&f=false\n\nAnyway, your proposition is highly appealing. So I agree that we should definitely go along with it, though I'd be intrigued were you to tell me what the consequences of keeping this general opinion in place. I would assume that since alchemy would not be equated to witchcraft, the alchemists could relax, but what would you have in mind?\n\nThe obvious consequence is that occultism and mysticism would form a notable undercurrent in Christian thought while state authorities don't bother to go witch-hunting. , The appeal of \"Platonism, Neoplatonism, Aristotelianism, Hermeticism and Kabbalah\" on several Renaissance philosophers might expand to include Christian theologians. Leading to religious syncretism as well, not only philosophical one. I wonder if one of the basics belief of Neoplatonism, the idea of reincarnation, might find new adherents. \"After bodily death, the soul takes up a level in the afterlife corresponding with the level at which it lived during its earthly life. The Neoplatonists believed in the principle of reincarnation. Although the most pure and holy souls would dwell in the highest regions, the impure soul would undergo a purification, before descending again, to be reincarnated into a new body, perhaps into animal form. A soul that has returned to the One, achieves union with the cosmic universal soul, and does not descend again, at least, not in this world period.\" See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism#Salvation\n\nPerhaps it's my Swedish heritage that makes me find the history of coffee so appealing. Though I am aware this could be apocrypha, it is said that coffee arrived in Sweden by the way of king Charles XII, who in his wars against the Russian Empire allied with the Ottomans and even travelled down to Turkish territory, where he developed a fondness for the drink. In broader history, it should be noted that the seemingly harmless, innocent coffeehouses were banned in several European countries at different times, with monarchs fearing that they fostered seditious and rebellious sentiments, and that by outlawing them, the monarchs did not need to fear insurrections or revolutions.\n\nIn my native Greece, coffeehouses (kafeneia, καφενεία) have a history of being used for polιtical discussions and political meetings. I am not surprised to see them connected with rebelliousness elsewhere. \"Modern Greek\" (1987) by Theodore C. Papaloizos explains it better. \"Most of the time, the patrons discuss topics such as politics. The Kafeneia are politically oriented. Patrons will not go to a Kafeneio whose proprietor belongs to a political party different from their own.\" The old Kafeneia functioned partly as clubs for the supporters of one party or another. This has declined in recent decades, with people being increasingly disillusioned with the political parties. The sharp polarization between right, center, and left, active throughout the 20th century, is now mostly gone.\n\nOh, and by the way, Tolkien's inspiration for Theoden came from the Old English word þeoden, meaning “leader of a people”, and Thengel (in Lord of the Rings, the name of Theoden King's father) from þengel, meaning “king” or “prince.” A similar Old Norse word (with the same meaning, no less) to Old English þeoden would be þjóðann, and the word þengel exists in Old Norse as well, with the same spelling and meaning.\n\nNot much of a surprise there. One consequence of the Viking Age in the British islands was that Old English and Old Norse speakers regularly interacted. As usual this resulted in the existence of many loanwords. \"The second major source of loanwords to Old English were the Scandinavian words introduced during the Viking invasions of the 9th and 10th centuries. In addition to a great many place names, these consist mainly of items of basic vocabulary, and words concerned with particular administrative aspects of the Danelaw (that is, the area of land under Viking control, which included extensive holdings all along the eastern coast of England and Scotland).\"\n\n**\"The Vikings spoke Old Norse, a language related to Old English in that both derived from the same ancestral Proto-Germanic language. It is very common for the intermixing of speakers of different dialects, such as those that occur during times of political unrest, to result in a mixed language, and one theory holds that exactly such a mixture of Old Norse and Old English helped accelerate the decline of case endings in Old English.\n\nApparent confirmation of this is the fact that simplification of the case endings occurred earliest in the north and latest in the southwest, the area farthest away from Viking influence. Regardless of the truth of this theory, the influence of Old Norse on the English language has been profound: responsible for such basic vocabulary items as sky, leg, the pronoun they, the verb form are, and hundreds of other words.\" See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English#Norse_influence and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Old_Norse_origin\n\nSo how about a lawspeaker named Þjóðann Þengelsson, a name that would actually be pronounced as Theoden Thengel's son? Because I like it.\n\nWhy not?\n\ninally, was there any interest in my far-fetched idea of producing clockwork medieval computers?\n\nI am not familiar enough with the subject to contribute much to this idea. Sorry.\n\nFurther partial commentary:\n\nLets not forget though, that Lithuanian Paganism survived discreetly among the peasantry and was notoriously difficult to eradicate until it largely faded away by the 17th century. Vinland might still be receiving pagan migrants long after the Christianization of the Baltic countries.\n\n17th century?!\n\nThat I was completely unaware of!\n\nRegarding the decline of ethnic polytheism in the Baltic countries, I wonder if a few exiled Lithuanians and Balts from Iceland would return to their ancestral homelands and inspired between the 1300-1400's. Inspired by Asaism from Vestigard, these populist Asaist preachers would contribute to \"peasant revolts\" in the Baltic region against the authority of Catholic and Orthodox Christian overlords. It may not catch on, largely due to persecution, but it'll serve as a reminder to lingering Pagans in northern Europe that Vestigard is the \"promised land\".\n\nWell, the facts you have enlightened me with really gives thorough support for you suggestion of continued paganism in the Baltics. I must concede that such a direction is not only possible, but likely. Let's go with it!\n\nWith Ireland being divided by Diarmait mac Mail na mBo of Leinster and Toirdelbach Ua Briain (Turlough O'Brian) of Munster, I wonder if the Irish Church can preserve its autonomy from Rome?\n\nKing Diarmait of Leinster IOTL was on friendly terms with Harold Godwinsson, whose sons fled to his kingdom after the Norman victory at Hastings in 1066.\n\nIf Diarmait mac Mail is similarly aligned with a prevailing House of Wessex in this TL, would this entail the Holy Roman Church's bid to assert it's supremacy in Ireland through the kings of Leinster? then again, Munster's impending marriage alliance with Norway could eventually lead to the same thing happening. The primacy of Ireland seems to have been disputed between the Archbishopric of Armagh and the See of Dublin, which had ties with Canterbury.\n\nSounds like it is impossible to butterfly religious strife away from Ireland. From Wikipedia, I read:\n\n“The lengthy reform process of assimilating the Celtic churches into the European mainstream was caused in part by the slow reform of the Papacy itself over many years, but it quickened after the Gregorian Reforms (1050–80). In Britain the Synod of Whitby is considered important, and in Ireland the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1111 established modern dioceses.”\n\nI wonder if we could introduce yet another Schism in the church, or at least prevent British/Celtic from becoming proper Catholicism, with the Archbishop of Dublin becoming the head of the Celtic Church. Britain will then be the stage for an epic play about which church is the true church of God: The Celtic Church, the Apostolic Church and the Holy Roman Church.\n\nIn modern Greek, the term for both \"computer\" and \"calculator\" is hypologistes/ypologistes (υπολογιστής) which literally means \"the one performing estimates, and calculations\". Originally used for a certain class of accountants, and attested in writing since 1840. Derives from the verb \"hypologizo, ypologizo\" (υπολογίζω) and one of its meanings. The verb is used since ancient times and can be found in the writings of Plato and Demosthenes.\n\nHypologist sounds like an excellent name for the clockwork computers, with hypologer then being the name for a hypologist machinist.\n\nYes, because it would allow for significant changes in their thoughts about the afterlife.\n\nThat's interesting. Remind me that must introduce a Dante of this timeline who writes a very different Divine Comedy. For fun measures, he could also be influenced by gnostic currents re-emerging in this timeline. I wonder what that Divine Comedy will look like.\n\nAlright then, summing up all Ireland-discussion hitherto:\n\nIreland probably had no actual High King in the 1020s. Though the title was most likely used by Donnchad mac Briain, King of Munster (reigned c. 1025-1064), it is uncertain whether he managed to extend his authority over the other Kings.\n\nSigtrygg Silkbeard was only the King of Dublin (reigned c. 995-1036). [...] The 1020s were a difficult time for Sigtrygg. His army was defeated by the forces of Leinster in 1021. His fleet was destroyed by the forces of the Ulaid in 1022. Dublin became vulnerable and was forced to politically submit and offer hostages to other Kingdoms. To the King of Ailech in 1025, and to the King of Munster in 1026. Making Dublin a contested area between two powerful kingdoms. While the Ulaid continued leading raids into Dublin's areas. In 1027, an attempt to ally with Brega against Meath backfired. Resulting in heavy casualties for the forces of Dublin. In 1029, a new King of Brega turned against Dublin. Managing to capture Sigtrygg's heir and demanding a royal ransom to release him.\n\nIn the 1030s, the alliance with Canute and the plunder from Wales allowed Dublin to restore its military might. Defeating several rival kings.\n\nThe butterflies then reaches Ireland at the latest in the 1030s. Established.\n\nIn Wales itself, the invasions from Dublin probably undermined the authority of Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig, Prince of Gwynned (reigned c. 1023-1039). Theoretically Iago was the most powerful ruler in Wales, but he failed to defend his own territory. He was eventually killed by his own soldiers. The throne was then offered to Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (reigned 1039-1063).\n\nGryfydd started his reign by annilhilating an invasion force from Mercia,and then leading his own invasion into Dehuebarth. By 1055, Gryfydd managed to unite the whole of Wales under his control. He was King of Gwynedd, Powys, Deheubarth, Gwent, and Morgannwg. He started styling himself \"King of Wales\". He celebrated his success by leading new invasions into England. He sacked the city of Hereford in 1056, and was a major enemy to Edward the Confessor. However his reign ended when Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex (term 1053-1066) led a counter-invasion into Wales. Gryffydd himself was killed and his kingdom divided among rival kings. Harold himself claimed Gryfydd's widow as his new wife. The success made Harold the most successful Entglish general and opened the way for his usurpation of the English throne in 1066.\n\nClearly, the butterflies are gonna have frakked up Welsh and Irish history quite a lot compared to our timeline as early as about fifty years into the 11th century.\n\nIn a timeline with no Canute, there are only two options for Sigtrygg. 1) He may seek an alliance with England anyway, seeing it as his only chance to restore his kingdom. If so the invasions into Wales still take place 2) He may stay devoid of allies and the target for several other Irish kingdoms. Eventually some ambitious ruler may decide to fully annex Dublin. The Kingdom of Mide/Meath and the Kingdom of Leinster would be the most likely to attempt this, due to being the neighbours of the Kingdom of Dublin. In the original timeline, Dublin was annexed by Leinster in 1171. In the new timeline the event may take place 140 years earlier.\n\nOption no. 2 seems most likely. The Wessexers have been quite busy recently simply trying to defend their own rule against Danish and Scottish invasions. Expansion isn't as much on the agenda as mere endurance. Leinster thus takes Dublin in either the 1030s or 1040s (whichever you two would consider most likely).\n\nIn Wales, the lack of foreign invasions in the 1030s may help Iago stabilize his hold over Gwynedd, preventing the rise of Gryfydd and the unification of Wales. Instead of Welsh invasions into England, we might have the Earls of Mercia leading invasions into Wales in the 1040s.\n\nSounds reasonable.\n\nThough I am not sure who would be Earl of Mercia at the time. In the original timeline Eadric Streona was Ealdorman of Mercia from 1007 to 1017. His early death resulted in an unrelated figure becoming Earl of Mercia: Leofric (c. 1017/1030-1057). [...] Leofric was the Earl of Mercia who appears heavily involved in Welsh events. In the new timeline Eadric doesn't die in the 1010s and Leofric might never rise to power. He might instead replace his father as Ealdorman of Hwicce, a less prestigious position.\n\nAgain, reasonable, so let's go with that. Are we then to have Eadric's descendants remain Earls of Mercia?\n\nWhat happens in Wales would probably result from the policies that the surviving Iago and Eadric decide to pursue. We might even see the two fighting against each other for a while.\n\nIf both are ambitious and expansionist, then such a course is inevitable. How would you propose that this plays out?\n\nOption no. 2 seems most likely. The Wessexers have been quite busy recently simply trying to defend their own rule against Danish and Scottish invasions. Expansion isn't as much on the agenda as mere endurance. Leinster thus takes Dublin in either the 1030s or 1040s (whichever you two would consider most likely).\n\nHow about the 1040s, becoming one of the successes of Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó (reigned c. 1042-1072). His reign seems to have expanded the influence of Leinster consideranly, noting that his title apparently reflected states subordinate to him. “Diarmait son of Mail na mbó, king of Britons and the Hebrides and Dublin and Mug Nuadat´s Half [southern Ireland]”.\n\nHe is certainly known to have installed one of his sons, Murchad mac Diarmata, on the throne of Dublin (reigned c. 1052-1070). Murchad went on to successfully claim the throne of the Kingdom of the Isles (reigned c. 1061-1070), while still subordinate to his father.\n\nIt is uncertain which areas of Great Britain were subordinate to Leinster, though it might just be the Kingdom of the Rhinns, a Norse-Gaelic in modern Galloway. Just another Irish colony in Scotland.\n\nPerhaps in the new timeline Diarmait manages to create a more centralized and unified state out of Leinster, Dublin, and the Isles. Though Norway might not be happy with another kingdom controlling the Henrides, islands traditionally either allied or subordinate to it.\n\nNote that Dublin was a significant port and would allow the Leinstermen to get revenues from naval trade. Wikipedia points that the cities of Waterford and Wexford were also in close proximity to Leinster.
