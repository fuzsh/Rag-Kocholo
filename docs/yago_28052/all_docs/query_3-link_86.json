        "text": "Wetterau is the broad, flat valley of the river Wetter in Franconia (now in Hesse), some thirty miles north of Frankfurt. It is fertile farmland and has been settled since prehistoric times.\n\nThis family is sometimes called the Konradiner,(a nickname, and was never a last name in the family), after Konrad the old, father of Konrad the younger,(Konrad I), one of only two members of the family that would be King, they produced. The earliest know ancestor is Gebhard I, Graf im Niederlahngau at the time of Charlemagne, father of Udo, who is believed to have married Judith, daughter of Konrad, Graf im Linz- und Argengau, a relative of Louis II 'the German' (according to FMG) or maybe a daughter of Herbert I de Vermandois (euweb). They were the parents of (1) Konrad \"der Ältere\"( the old) von der Lahngau, Graf im Oberlahngau, Hessengau, und Gotzfeldgau (killed in battle in 906), who married Glismodis of Carinthia and was the father of (a) Emperor Konrad I (911-918) and of (b) Eberhard von der Lahngau, Graf in der Hessengau; see note at the bottom of the page; (2) Gebhard II von der Lahngau, Graf in der Wetterau, Graf im Oberen Rheingau (killed in battle 910), briefly Duke of Lotharingia, had descendants including a son Udo, Graf von der Oberrheingau und Wetterau. Konrad \"Kurzbold\"; (3) Eberhard, see below; and (4) Rudolf, Bishop of Würzburg (killed in battle 908).\n\nEberhard von der Lahngau, Graf in der Ortenau (killed in battle at Bamberg in 903) married Wiltrud. One son: Gebhard von Wetterau (died 949), married Kunigunde. One son: Konrad \"Kurzbold\" von Wetterau, Vogt von Schwarzach, Graf in der Ortenau (died 982), married Judith. (FMG notes that the parentage of these children is debatable, as some sources make him too young to be their father, though they were certainly siblings. An alternative paternity is Udo, Graf von der Oberrheingau und Wetterau, see just above.) Five children: (1) Heribert, see below; (2) Konrad, see farther below; (3) Kuno, Graf von Oehningen, who married Richilde (died 999), thought to be a daughter of Emperor Otto I, but by which wife is not known (see Saxony); she might also be Otto's sister rather than daughter; we are descended from their daughter (a) Emma, wife of Friedrich I, Graf von Diessen, and maybe also from (b) Judith, married Ludwig von Dagsburg - they may be the parents of the Heilwig of Dagsburg who married Hugo 'Raucus', Graf im Nordgau; and probably also from their third daughter (c) Ida, married Duke Rudolf of Lower Bavaria; (4) Udo, Duke of Swabia (died 982), no known descendants; and (5) Judith (died 973), who married Heinrich I \"der Kahle,\" Graf von Stade.\n\nHeribert I von Gleiberg, Graf von Kinziggau (c925-992) married Imiza or Irmintrud, daughter of Megingoz (died 966), Graf im Wormsgau, and Gerberga, daughter of Gottfried, Graf in Avalgau and his wife Ermentrude (maybe a daughter of Charles III 'the Simple'). Note that FMG is not sure that Heribert is really a son of Konrad \"Kurzbold.\" He and Irmintrud had four children: (1) Otto, Graf von Hammerstein (died 1035), married Irmgard, daughter of Godefroi, Graf von Bidgau and Comte de Verdun (see Lorraine) and his wife Mechtild (Billung) of Saxony; our ancestors by other lines; one son who died young and one daughter, Irmintrud, married Rutbert I von Zütphen; their daughter Jutta has many descendants, but as far as I can tell not us; (2) Gerberge, married Heinrich, Graf von Schweinfurt - we have a descent via Billung; see also Bavaria; (3) Irmintrude, inherited Gleiberg and married our ancestor Friedrich, count of Moselgau - see Luxembourg; and (4) Gebhard, apparently died young.\n\nWe retun to Konrad, probable second son of Konrad \"Kurzbold\" von Wetterau, above. He was Duke of Swabia (982-997), and Graf von Oehningen; his wife was Regelindis (died c990), daughter of Emperor Otto I and his second wife Adelais of Burgundy. Four children: (1) Hermann, see below; (2) Konrad III, Graf von Ortenau (died 994); (3) Ida (died 1009), married Rudolf II von Schwaben, Graf in Altorf; and (4) Judith, may have died young.\n\nHermann II, Duke of Swabia (c965-997-1003) married Gerberge, daughter of Conrad \"the Peaceful,\" King of Burgundy, and his second wife Mathilde (daughter of Louis IV \"d'Outre Mer\"). Five children: (1) Berthold (992-993); (2) Herman III, Duke of Swabia (998-1012); (3) Gisela (990-1043), married first Bruno von Braunschweig, second Duke Ernst I of Swabia, and third Emperor Konrad II; she is our ancestor by all three marriages: see Braunschweig, Babenberg and Salians; (4) Mathilde, married Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine; and (5) Beatrix (died 1025), married Adalbert von Eppenstein, duke of Carinthia."
