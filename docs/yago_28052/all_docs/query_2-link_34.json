        "text": "The Annales of Berthold record the betrothal in 1059 of \"Andreas Pannoniæ rex…filio suo Salomoni adhuc puero\" and \"sororem eius [Heinrici regis] minorem Iuditham\". The Annales Yburgenses refer to the wife of \"Ungariam…[rex] Salemannum\" as \"regis Heinrici sororem\" but do not name her. The Gesta Hungarorum records that King András forced the marriage of \"Salomoni regi\" and \"Henricus imperator…Sophiam suam filiam\", specifying that she had earlier been betrothed to \"filio regis Franciæ\". Having left Hungary for Germany after her husband was deposed in 1074, she was living in Regensburg when her husband attempted to reclaim the Hungarian throne. She refused to receive him when he returned in 1083. Her second marriage is confirmed by the Chronicæ Polanorum which records that King Wladyslaw married \"sororem imperatoris tertii Henrici, uxorem prius Salemonis Ungariæ regis\". The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum specifies her name \"Iudite\".\n\nThe necrology of Weltenburg records the death \"II Id Mar\" of \"Iudita de Polonia soror Heinrici imperatoris IV\". The necrology of Regensburg St Emmeran records the death \"II Id Mar\" of \"Iudita regina\". The necrology of Speyer records the death \"II Id Mar\" of \"Iudda regina imperatricis filia\". 1"
