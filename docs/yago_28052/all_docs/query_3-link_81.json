        "text": "Otto I (c. 948 - November 4, 1004), also known as Otto of Worms, was a member of the Salian dynasty, and was Duke of Carinthia from 978 to 985, and again from 1002 until his death.\n\nOtto was born in 948 as the only son of Conrad, Duke of Lorraine and Liutgarde of Saxony. As a grandson of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor, Otto was born into a life of power. His mother died five years after he was born and Otto lived much of his early life in his grandfather's court. His maternal uncle, Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor, ascended the imperial throne in 973 when he was 25. Otto of Worms was first documented as a count in the Nahegau about 956. He was appointed a Duke of Carinthia in 978. Otto lost the duchy in 985, however, when Emperor Otto's widow restored Carinthia to the Luitpoldings.\n\nOtto died on November 4, 1004 and was succeeded as Carinthian duke by his son, Conrad.\n\nFamily[]\n\nOtto married Judith, probably a granddaughter of Duke Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria."
