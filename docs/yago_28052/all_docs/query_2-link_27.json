        "text": "AKA: Adelaide of Vohburg\n\n1147-1153: Duchess of Swabia\n\n1152-1153: German queen\n\nAdela de Vohburg was born 1122 in Eger, Hungary to Diepold III von Vohburg (1075-1146) and Adelaida von Polen (1090-1127) and died 1187 Weissenau Abbey, Swabia, Germany of unspecified causes. She married Friedrich I Barbarossa of the Holy Roman Empire (1122-1190) 1147 JL in Vohburg, Nardgau. She married Diego von Ravensburg (1149-1187) 1156 JL .\n\nAdelaide of Vohburg was Duchess of Swabia from 1147 and from 1152 until 1153, as the first wife of the Hohenstaufen king Frederick Barbarossa, the later Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nLife\n\nAdelaide was a daughter of the Bavarian margrave Diepold III of Vohburg (c. 1079 – 1146), probably from his first marriage with Adelaide (Adelajda; c. 1091 – 1127), a daughter of the Polish duke Władysław I Herman and Judith of Swabia. Since the days of Emperor Henry IV, her father's ancestors ruled over the Egerland territory in the Bavarian March of the Nordgau, which, however, was seized by King Conrad III of Germany upon the margrave's death in 1146. To secure his hold on the Egerland, Conrad III married his nephew Frederick of Hohenstaufen to Diepold's daughter, Adelaide, before 2 March 1147 in the city of Eger. Frederick had just returned from the Second Crusade; he succeeded his father Frederick the One-Eyed as Duke of Swabia one month later and added his wife's extended dowry to his estates.\n\nAdelaide and Frederick's marriage was not successful, however. According to some later sources, this was because Adelaide committed adultery.[6] Adelaide rarely made public appearances and was not present for Frederick's election as the successor of his paternal uncle, Conrad III, on 4 March 1152, nor for his coronation as King of Germany at Aachen Cathedral five days later.\n\nAdelaide was Frederick's queen consort, but the couple remained childless. In 1153 Frederick petitioned Pope Eugene III for an annulment. The separation was granted and confirmed by the Bishop of Constance in March 1153; the justification given on grounds of consanguinity.[6] Frederick immediately began to court the Byzantine princess Maria Komnena, though to no avail.\n\nNo longer a queen, Adelaide, apparently unhampered by her former husband, soon after entered into a morganatic marriage with Dietho of Ravensburg, a ministerialis in the service of Duke Welf VI. The marriage produced several children. Dietho died about 1187; Adelaide died shortly afterwards at the Premonstratensian abbey of Weissenau near Ravensburg.\n\nSiblings\n\nResidences\n\nSee Also\n\nAdela Vohburg\n\nAdelaide Vohburg\n\nVohburg Family\n\nHoly Roman Emporer\n\nFrederick Barbarossa Family Ancestry\n\nBibiliography\n\n[Adela von Vohburg (1128-1187) at Google Books \"Annales Palidenses, a. 1155. 1156.\"] (in la), Monumenta Germaniae Historica Inde Ab Anno Christi Quingentesimo Usque Ad Annum Millesimum et Quingentesimum.
