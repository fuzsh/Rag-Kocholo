        "text": "Henry IX\n\n[FONT=&quot] Emperor Henry IX, some times called the Merchant’s Emperor, greatly improved the finances of the empire, furthering trade along his holdings. In 1202, Henry IX granted charters to merchants from Frankfurt, Hamburg, London, Lübeck, Rouen and York to freely operate in England, Normandy and Saxony. And in 1212, he extended these rights to the merchants of all Imperial Cities. But, so as to be eligible for these charters, the merchants were forced to be organized into imperial-recognized guilds, paying special taxes for this status.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nIn 1207, he elevated Frankfurt, Lübeck and Nuremberg to the status of Imperial City, and in 1209 granted Rouen, London and York the title of Imperial Cities, although this was merely a technicality. In 1217, he elevated the city to Augsburg to rank of Imperial Cities.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nThrough his reign, Emperor Henry IX proclaimed many laws standardizing the monetary and measurement units. He adopted both the English Penny (which was pronounced pfennig in germany) and the Saxon Thaler as the official currency of the empire, although they were only fully adopted in the lands which he personally ruled. He also adopted the Roman Mile (equal to 5000 feet) and the Anglo-Saxon inch as the official units of length.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Nonetheless, Henry IX is more commonly remembered for his many marriages and his search for a male heir. In 1190, Emperor Henry IX had married Judith of Swabia (1173-1198), the youngest daughter of Frederick III Barbarosa (1122-11981), Duke of Swabia, and Clementia of Zähringen, daughter of Conrad, Duke of Zähringen. Empress Judith gave him three daughters, Judith of Winchester (1191-1200), Marguerite of Nuremberg (1194-1234) and Gertrude of Rouen (1195-1210).\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Two years after Empress Judith’s death, Henry IX remarried to Matilda of Bavaria (1185-1203), sister of Henry XIII (1183-1205) Duke of Bavaria (1195-1205), Conrad II (1184-1213), Margrave of Tuscany (1195-1213), and Frederick I of Burgundy (1190-1211), Count of Burgundy (1195-1211). Empress Matilda died in 1203, while giving birth to a stillborn son.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nThe Emperor married a third time the following year to Irene Angelina (1178-1208), daughter of Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelus, who gave birth to three sons, Henry Isaac (1204-1247), William of Winchester (1205-1225), and a daughter, Irene of Nuremberg (1207-1222).\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Empress Irene died in 1208, and Henry IX remarried for a fourth and last time to Leonor of Leon (1197-1241) in 1210, who birth to two sons, Conrad of Nuremberg (1212-1218) and Frederick of London (1215-1235), and a daughter, Leonor of Winchester (1216-1258).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nEmperor Henry IX died in 1218, been succeeded by Henry Isaac, who was in 1219 crowned King of England as Henry VI, and as Holy Roman Emperor Henry X in 1220.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] 1 Without the disastrous Battle of Hattin, and so no Third Crusade proclaimed in 1187, Frederick Barbarrosa did not take the cross and therefore he die while crossing the Göksu River at Anatolia. Barbarrosa instead lived for 8 more years, dieing of old age.[/FONT]\n\nThe Byzantine Empire\n\n[FONT=&quot] In 1195, Byzantine Isaac II Angelos (1156-1204) was deposed by his brother, Alexios III Angelos (1153-1211). Isaac’s son, Alexios Angelos (1182-1249), managed to escape from his imprisonment in 1201 with the help of two Pisan merchants. Alexios spent the following years going from court to court, unsuccessfully attempting to raise an army to restore his father to the Byzantine throne.

I mean its getting to the stage where in OTL Magna Carter is signed, first Parliament and conquest of Wales etc etc don't know how its affected here\n\nThe Kings of France\n\n[FONT=&quot] In 1161, King Louis VII married Gertrude of Nuremberg (1142-1197), sister of Emperor Henry, who bore him two sons, Philip (1162-1207) and Louis (1167-1188), and a daughter, Agnes de France (1165-1211).\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] With a failing health, Louis VII had his oldest son, Philip, crowned at Reims in 1179, ensuring his succession after his death in September 18, 1180. Louis VII was unable to be present at either his son’s coronation, or at his marriage to Constance of Brittany (1161-1201), on May 1180. This marriage, instigated by Emperor Henry VII, cause a intriguing situation, as, through his marriage, Phillip II became not only Duke of Brittany, but also Earl of Richmond, and so both the Kings of England and of France became simultaneously each other vassal and suzerain.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Aided by the Confrères de la Paix, a order of warriors dedicated to maintaining peace and order in France, Phillip II was able to keep the order and contain the powers of his vassals, and even restore the royal power which had been lost during the reign of his father.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nPhillip II promoted the prosperity of France, bringing financial stability to the realm. A Visionary, he established the States-General, a legislative assembly composed of members of the different estates of France. Although the States-General had limited power, they, with help of the centralized bureaucracy formed by Phillip II, greatly served to counter the power of the nobles and to increase the King’s authority.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]But Phillip II’s personal life was marked by tragedies, as of the four sons and four daughters bore by Queen Constance, only the last two children, Constance of France (1194-1232) and Phillip (1198-1246) lived to reach their majority, and even so Phillip II died without been sure of the continuity of his line as, when his only surviving son was crowned Phillip III in 1208, he was then still only 14-years-old.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nPhillip III seized the throne in 1216, and shortly afterward married Constanza of Leon (1202-1236), daughter of Alfonso IX of Leon. Queen Constanza gave him three sons and six daughters, of which only Louis of France (1218-1251), Isabelle of France (1220-1276), Blanche of France (1222-1262), Marie of France (1224-1266) and Phillip of France (1230-1279) survived to came of age.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nA lover of knowledge, Phillip III stimulated the intellectual and artistic activities of the realm, greatly financing the University of Paris. His patronage of arts brought innovations to the gothic art and architecture.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nIn 1223, Phillip III was pressured by Pope Gregory IX to recognize Henry I of Aquitaine as Duke of Narbonne and Count of Toulouse. This was made not only to reward the actions of Henry I and his father, Theobald III, but also to weaken Phillip III, who was a devoted ally of Emperor Henry X.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nIn 1225, Phillip III elevated the Bishop of Laon, the Count of Flanders and the Count of Anjou to the ranks of Peers of the Realm.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1226, Phillip III gained a great opportunity to increase his land with the wealthy county of Champagne. The House of Champagne had had troubled times, in terms of successions, since the death of Henry I of Champagne in 1181. Henry I had been succeeded first by his second son Henry II (1168-1188), and then by his third son, Theobald III (1172-1197). Theobald III had died in 1197, leaving only a 1-years-old son, Henry III (1198-1226), who in turn died leaving only daughters.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Phillip III seized Henry III’s four daughters and engaged the oldest, Eleanor of Champagne (1215-1249), to his heir (and then also his only son), Louis (1218-1251), and led the other three to join the Church. This move was heavily contested by King Henry I of Navarre (1196-1247), who claimed that Henry III of Champagne had promised Eleanor to his oldest son, Henry of Navarre (1222-1286).\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Because of Henry I’s claims of the engagement of his son to Eleanor, Pope Gregory IX briefly declared the marriage invalid, until Phillip III paid a heavy bribe to the Pope. Henry I of Navarre also declared war against France, but was forced to back down when the fearsome Emperor Henry X declared his support for Phillip III.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1246, Phillip III died and was succeed by his oldest son, Louis VIII (1218-1251), called Louis the Greedy. Louis VIII was noted for his persecution of the jews, not out of religious devotion, but as a mean to increase his coffers. In three occasions he seized their properties, and four times he forced them to pay heavy fines to ensure the permanency of their activities in France.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Louis VIII also signed a commercial treaty with Henry X, extending the free trade rights issued by Henry IX to the merchants of Brie, Champagne, Nantes, Paris, Reims, Saint-Malo and Troyes, as well as granting permission for the german, norman and english merchants to freely trade in the royal holdings of France. For such, the anglo-german merchants involved would have to pay an annual tax to the Kings of France, while the French merchants would have to pay a similar one to the Holy Roman Emperors.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Louis VIII was succeeded by Philip IV (1231-1292). Philip IV married in 1250 Adeides of Namur (1231-1286), who gave him three daughters and four sons, of which only two daughters, Isabelle of France (1250-1301) and Eleanor of France (1251-1282), and three sons, Philip of France (1255-1328), Louis of France (1262-1302) and Charles of France (1265-1291), lived to came of age.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1270, on the death of Count Fulk VI of Anjou (1245-1270), his only daughter Sibylle of Anjou (1266-1322) became the sole heiress of Anjou, Bolougne, Maine and Mortain, and was wedded to Philip of France in 1280.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1292, Philip of France, Count of Anjou, Bolougne, Maine and Mortain succeeded his father as King Philip V of France, Duke of Brittany, Earl of Richemound and Count of Champagne. Known for his debauchery and many scandals during his youth, Philip V changed overnight after the birth of his first son, Louis of France (1280-1322), becoming an extremely religious and devoted men. Phillip V heavily donated to the church, building great cathedrals across his domains, and his reign was marked by many theological debates.[/FONT]"
