Sharing a photo of some street art, Binzer wrote: “I’m a lover than a fighter … but the one I need to love more instead of fight with is myself ... mr shifty true Love # Sober alive and grateful.”

Crazy Town was founded by Binzer and Bret Mazur in 1995, when they began performing under the name The Brimstone Sluggers.

While the duo teamed up with Adam Bravin, they did not release any music until 1999 when they recruited Rust Epique, James Bradley Jr, Doug Miller, Adam Goldstein and Antonio Lorenzo into the band.

Going on to release their debut album, The Gift of Game later that year, the band toured as a support act for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and released two singles, Toxic and Darkside, from the album.

In 2001, the band released Butterfly and went on to see industry success with the tune reaching number one on Billboard’s Hot 100 in America, Austria, Germany, Norway and Switzerland.

The single reached the number two slot in New Zealand and the number four slot in Australia.

Two years later the group disbanded after their second album, Darkhorse, failed to chart.

They briefly reunited in 2007, 2013 and again in 2017.
