Epic Mazur (born Bret Mazur on August 31, 1970) is an American vocalist, rapper, and record producer. He is best known as a founder and frontman of Crazy Town.

Bret Mazur grew up in Brooklyn, New York before his parents moved across the country to Hollywood, Los Angeles. It was here that he began to work as a DJ at age 16, and received the pseudonym "Epic" from a friend. Mazur graduated from William Howard Taft High School in Los Angeles. He then collaborated with Richard Wolf as part of the production team Wolf & Epic on albums by Bell Biv DeVoe, Ralph Tresvant, MC Lyte and MC Serch, among others.

Crazy Town

Crazy Town was formed by Mazur and Seth Binzer, who started collaborating in 1995 under the initial name of "The Brimstone Sluggers". By early 1999, they were calling themselves Crazy Town, and the full band consisted of Mazur, Binzer, Rust Epique, James Bradley Jr., Doug Miller, DJ AM, and Antonio Lorenzo "Trouble" Valli. Their debut album, The Gift of Game, was released in November 1999, having been recorded earlier that year. It would become a major success after their single Butterfly reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, sparking record sales in excess of 1.5 million.[3] Their 2002 follow up album, Darkhorse, was a commercial failure in comparison, and the band broke up shortly after its release.

Current

After Crazy Town announced they had reformed in 2007, Mazur stated that Crazy Town's third album, tentatively titled Crazy Town Is Back, would be released right after his upcoming solo album, Strip to This in Spring 2008. Neither album has yet been released. In 2011 Mazur formed the band LA EX, together with Crazy Town member Kraig Tyler and Antonella Barba. They released their first music video "Lipstick" on YouTube in July 2011. They are currently working on an EP.

Mazur is a record producer for various recording artists and also works as a music supervisor for TV and film.
