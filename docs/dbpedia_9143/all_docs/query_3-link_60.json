        "text": "Embattled Crazy Town frontman Shifty Shellshock died on Monday June 24th. His passing was confirmed by the Los Angeles Medical Examiner. No cause of death has been reported. The veteran vocalist, born Seth Binzer, was reportedly found in LA-area home. He was just 49 years old.\n\nShifty's career began in 1992 when he met Crazy Town co-founder, Bret Mazur. The two would begin making music under the name, Brimstone Sluggers. The project would eventually change names to Crazy Town and would be filled out with the full band which included Rust Epique, James Bradley Jr., Doug Miller, Adam Goldstein, better known as DJ AM and Antonio Lorenzo “Trouble” Valli.\n\nThe band would hit pay dirt in 1999 with the release of their debut album, The Gift Of Game. The album would go platinum and secure the band a number one on the Billboard charts, with \"Butterfly\" becoming the band's breakout hit. The song would remain definitive throughout their tumultuous run.\n\nWhile Crazy Town would fizzle following the release of their 2002 follow up Darkhorse, Shifty would begin his solo career, dropping Happy Love Sick in 2004. While the release would see moderate success internationally, it failed to bulld the same momentum of Crazy Town's initial launch.\n\nBinzer and Mazur would reform Crazy Town in 2007. While the band would see a few different configurations, the tandem dropped the band's third album in 2015, The Brimstone Sluggers. Shortly thereafter, Mazur would leave Crazy Town, while Binzer pressed on under the name Crazy Town X.\n\nThroughout his career, Shifty infamously battled addiction problems. He was featured on two seasons of VH1's \"Celebrity Rehab\" and would appear on two seasons of the series, \"Sober House\"."
