        "text": "Shifty Shellshock, the former singer of rap-rock group Crazy Town, is currently in a coma.\n\nTMZ reports that the 37-year-old, whose real name is Seth Binzer, has been in an unresponsive state at a Los Angeles hospital since Thursday. While the singer's reps have yet to confirm why Shellshock was admitted to the hospital, sources close to him told TMZ that it's most likely drug-related.\n\nOn Monday, Shellshock's ex-girlfriend Jasmine Lennard had an altercation with the singer's family at the hospital.\n\nSecurity was eventually called and we were all separated . . . the family is blaming me for leaving him during Christmas for this relapse, Lennard, 26, told TMZ, adding that she didn't know of his hospitalization until friends told her days later.\n\nLennard, a model from the UK, is the mother to Shellshock's 2-year-old son.\n\nShellshock has had an extensive history of drug abuse, much of which has been documented on Celebrity Rehab and the follow-up show Sober House.\n\nThis past February, the singer was busted in Los Angeles for possession of rock cocaine. He was scheduled to appear in court this week for a pre-trial hearing of the drug bust, and according to TMZ, was extremely anxious about the possibility of going to jail.\n\nCrazy Town first arrived on the mainstream music scene in 2001, when they unleashed the catchy rap rock tune Butterfly. The song sat on the number one spot in more than a dozen countries, including the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Prior to their one-hit-wonder success, the band, which Shellshock co-founded with Bret Mazur (aka. Epic), also included the likes of James Bradley Jr., Doug Miller and the late Adam Goldstein (DJ AM) and the late Rust Epique.\n\nFollowing Crazy Town's two albums, The Gift of Game (1999) and Darkhorse (2002), Shellshock hit the airwaves solo, with his debut album Happy Love Sick. He went on to release three singles, including Starry Eyed Surprise with Paul Oakenfold.\n\nIn 2010, Shellshock went back to group mode, this time forming Shifty and The Big Shots. The band's material failed to chart that year.\n\nCrazy Town was rumored to be working on a third album, but the rumor has disintegrated in recent years."
