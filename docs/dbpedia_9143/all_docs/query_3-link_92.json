        "text": "Crazy Town frontman Shifty Shellshock has died.\n\nReports are coming in from the United States, with multiple outlets confirming news of his passing. According to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s website, the singer – real name Seth Binzer – was found dead at his residence in Los Angeles. A cause of death has yet to be disclosed; he was 49 years old.\n\nCrazy Town will forever be tied to the cusp of the Millennium, with the band producing a succession of summer-ready hits. The immortal ‘Butterfly’ rode on an elastic bass line, while Shifty Shellshock’s vocal blended rap flows with rock crunch, and a hefty dose of pop into the bargain.\n\nThe group started almost a decade before that.

Appearing on VH1’s Celebrity Rehab, he was admitted to hospital in 2012 and fell into a coma. He later made a full recovery.\n\nCrazy Town reformed for live dates, but in 2022 made headlines for a high profile spat with a former drummer.
