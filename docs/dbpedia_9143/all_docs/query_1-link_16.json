        "text": "Shifty Shellshock, lead singer of the rap-rock band Crazy Town, has died. He was 49.\n\nShellshock, born Seth Binzer, died at a Los Angeles residence on Monday, according to Los Angeles Medical Examiner records. A cause of death is unknown at this time.\n\nIn a statement to The Sun published Saturday, Shellshock's family said the musician's \"dedication to his music and fans never wavered.\"\n\n“Seth struggled with addiction throughout his life. He did so on a very public platform, which was particularly challenging,\" the family said. “God knows he tried so hard to beat his demons but sadly he lost his battle.\n\n“Our hearts are shattered by his loss. Seth's larger-than-life presence touched so many. Seth was a troubled soul, but he was a beautiful one and he had a heart of gold.\"\n\nCrazy Town was known for the 1999 single \"Butterfly,\" which reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in 2001. Their debut album, 1999's \"The Gift of Game,\" sold 1.6 million units. The band broke up in 2003 after declining success in subsequent music projects.\n\nThe band included more than a dozen current and former members, including co-founder Bret \"Epic\" Mazur, DJ Rick One, Mark White, Adam \"DJ Adam 12\" Bravin, Charles \"Rust Epique\" Lopez and the late Adam \"DJ AM\" Goldstein.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the LA medical examiner's office and Crazy Town's label.\n\nBinzer and Mazur reformed Crazy Town in 2007 and released an album in 2015. Mazur left the band in 2017, and Binzer changed the band's name to Crazy Town X.\n\nBinzer appeared on the VH1 reality television series \"Celebrity Rehab\" Season 1 for cocaine addiction in 2008 and returned in Season 2 after producer and star Dr. Drew Pinsky learned of his relapse. The singer also appeared on the short-lived spin-off \"Celebrity Rehab Presents Sober House\" Season 1 in 2009 and Season 2 in 2010.\n\nMore stars we've lost 2024: Tamayo Perry, Taylor Wily, Jodie Devos\n\nTributes came in on a post on Shellshock's Instagram page, which hasn't been active since April.\n\nPhotographer Mike Azira wrote: \"RIP old friend… remember you best as a kid in a skateboard with the entire world in front of you… sending love to your family.\""
