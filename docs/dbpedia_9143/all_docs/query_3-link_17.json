        "text": "Shifty Shellshock, the lead singer of the late-1990s rap-rock band Crazy Town known for the hit song “Butterfly,” whose legal name was Seth Binzer, died at his home in Los Angeles on Thursday. He was 49.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner confirmed his death, the cause of which was still being investigated.\n\nCrazy Town rose to prominence after the band released its debut album, “The Gift of Game,” in 1999. In 2001, the record reached No. 9 on the Billboard album chart ranking the most popular albums, in large part because of the success of “Butterfly.” The song, which Rolling Stone magazine described as “a sweetly floating ballad that’s atypical for these hard-rocking B-boys,” gained wide acclaim, holding the top spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 ranking for two weeks.\n\nMr. Binzer was open about his struggles with substance abuse. He appeared on two seasons of the VH1 series “Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew” in 2008 and also on the spinoff series “Sober House” from 2009 to 2010.\n\nSeth Binzer was born on Aug. 23, 1974, in Los Angeles to Rollin Binzer, who worked in advertising and directed films for rock bands, and Leslie Brooks, who was a model and worked in script development. He was raised in Southern California and spent part of his childhood in Marblehead, Mass.\n\nHe was a creative child but also had a wild streak that got him into trouble, according to his mother, and sister, Aubrey Binzer. When he was about 10, he would break dance on the pier in Marblehead for tourists, Ms. Brooks said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
