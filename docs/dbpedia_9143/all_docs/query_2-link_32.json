        "text": "Getty\n\nShellshock is survived by his three children, Halo, Gage and Phoenix.\n\nThe lead singer of the American rap-rock band Crazy Town, Shifty Shellshock has died.\n\nThe \"Butterfly\" singer -- whose birth name was Seth Binzer -- was 49-years-old. He passed away Monday at a residence in Los Angeles, according to the Los Angeles Medical Examiner. A cause of death has not yet been disclosed.\n\nShellshock is survived by his three children, Halo, Gage and Phoenix.\n\nMTV/Facebook\n\nReal World Miami Cast Reacts After Costar Sarah Becker's Death by Suicide\n\nView Story\n\nThe LA based vocalist met fellow Crazy Town co-founder Bret Mazur (a.k.a. Epic) in 1992, when they began making music under the name Brimstone Sluggers. The group then switched to the name Crazy Town and expanded their lineup by hiring Rust Epique, Doug Miller, James Bradley Jr., Antonio Lorenzo Valli and Adam Goldstein.\n\nTheir debut album, The Gift of Game, was released in November 1999 and the band opened for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on tour shortly after. Their number one hit \"Butterfly\" (an ode to attractive women), topped the Billboard 100 and catapulted the band's album to platinum status in 2001.\n\nThe song samples the Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Pretty Little Ditty\" and features Shellshock's unique rapping style for their iconic lyrics -- \"Come my lady, come-come my lady // You're my butterfly, sugar baby\"\n\nCrazy Town went on hiatus in 2003 following the release of their second album, Darkhorse. However, the band reunited in 2007. They released their third album, The Brimstone Sluggers, in 2015.\n\nDuring the band's hiatus, Shellshock released his debut solo album Happy Love Sick in 2004. The artist was also open about his struggles with addiction throughout his career, appearing on reality TV shows including VH1's Celebrity Rehab and Sober House."
