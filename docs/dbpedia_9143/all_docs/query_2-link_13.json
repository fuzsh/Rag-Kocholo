Even though the lyrics could be argued to be rather simplistic; “Come, my lady. Come, come, my lady. You’re my butterfly. Sugar. Baby.” There is no denying that ‘Butterfly’ is an extremely catchy, throwback tune.\n\nThe music video for the song was directed by the team who worked on the well-known movie, The Matrix as well as What Dreams May Come. The video depicts the band in a fantasy, make-believe forest surrounded by butterflies. The fantasy, magical vibe continues as Shifty’s star tattoo flies off into the air, as well as two women sporting butterfly wings, walking around in the forest.\n\nWhat are your thoughts of this massive hit track? Have you got a #ThrowbackThursday track to recommend us? Please leave your thoughts or song suggestions in a comment or via social media.\n\nFrankie – Muzik Speaks\n\nwww.twitter.com/ifronk\n\nwww.instagram/iifronk"
