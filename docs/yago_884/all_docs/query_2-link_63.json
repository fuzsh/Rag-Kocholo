        "text": "This article contains major character or plot details.\n\nFine, call us clingy. The Love Is Blind Season 6 reunion just dropped, and we already miss (almost) everyone. Feeling the same way? Well, keep reading because there’s much more to this love story.\n\nFirst, let’s recap what went down when the pod squad got back together. Co-hosts Nick and Vanessa Lachey caught up with Johnny and Amy, the sole couple to make it out of the experiment as husband and wife. Yes, they are still very much in love and have, in fact, heard of condoms. Laura appeared virtually to confront a united Jeramey and Sarah Ann, who are now a full-fledged couple. Clay shot his shot (again) with AD, who didn’t exactly close the door on getting back together one day. But don’t expect a second act from Jimmy and Chelsea, who’ve decided that they’re far better off as friends and allies against the, uh, passionate fan response to their romance. There’s nothing brewing between Chelsea and Trevor, who addressed the social media swirl about some of his recent incriminating text messages. As for Kenneth and Brittany, they found their happy ending as friends.\n\nBut that’s only the beginning, as the Season 6 cast has much more to say about their journeys from the pods to the reunion couches. Hear from the singles and couples below to learn more about what their lives look like now, who’s still together, and why Love Is Blind is an experience they’ll never forget.\n\nAmy and Johnny have “grown so much individually and as a couple.”\n\nSTATUS: STILL TOGETHER\n\nAs the only couple to tie the knot this season, Amy and Johnny are basking in the glow of both commitment and compromise. Since we last saw them, the two say their love has “kept growing and growing” over their first year of marriage. “When I look back at [the experiment], I love her so much more now than in the pods or when we were first married,” Johnny tells Tudum. Amy adds that they both have “grown so much as individuals and as a couple.” The first step? Moving in together. “He paid to break my lease and then we just went into it,” says Amy.\n\nFamily ties have only strengthened their bond, as their respective broods have “clicked perfectly” ever since the wedding. “My family is obsessed with John. My dad and him are bros and they call [each other] all the time,” Amy shares. “It’s the relationship that I always wanted for my dad to have with my husband.” Johnny actually accompanied Amy’s loved ones on a trip to France, while she spent the holidays with his family. “It’s so nice being able to just go to her parents’ house, see her family, and just have that community over there,” Johnny adds.\n\nLove Is Blind Relationship Rewind: Amy and JohnnyYou had me at anime!\n\nAs for starting their own family day, the two say it’s a “continuous conversation” about having children three to five years from now. “I am still firm on my stance that I don’t want any birth control at the moment, but that’s something that can change in the future,” Amy explains. “When the time comes, I’m sure that I’m going to end up consuming some sort of birth control.” For now, the couple is most focused on strengthening their foundations before taking any major next steps. “We’re still young and our relationship is still young, too, so we want to make sure that’s going to be growing and flourishing before we welcome a child into this world,” says Johnny.\n\nBut no matter what they decide, Amy and Johnny have pledged to move forward with the utmost respect and understanding for each other. “We would talk everything out and do temperature checks every day in the pods,” says Amy. “It’s something that we still do in our relationship and it’s just a huge game changer. I haven’t experienced that in the past and I’m very, very grateful for it.”\n\nLaura is dating a “grown, established man who is not looking for a mother.”\n\nSTATUS: IN A RELATIONSHIP\n\nBoth Laura’s new man and her ex Jeramey are “extremely clean and organized,” but that’s where the comparisons begin and end. She and her current boyfriend met through friends of friends and have been dating ever since. Laura describes him as “handsome, kind, patient, and thoughtful,” and notably, she says that the two complement each other extremely well. “In the past, I have needed to be my boyfriend’s financial provider, mother, maid, cook, etc., but the person I’m dating now is a grown, established man who is not looking for a mother,” she tells Tudum. “He’s only interested in being my partner and equal, which is lovely but still new for me.”\n\nOpening up her heart again after all the drama with Jeramey wasn’t exactly easy. “It was difficult for me to trust men prior to the experiment, but now it’s even more tough,” Laura says, adding that “being honest about who you are up-front” is of paramount importance to her. “I have a hard time believing anyone really is who they ‘say’ they are,” she shares. “I need time for them to prove they’re authentic.” Luckily, the new guy in Laura’s life is putting in the work. “The guy I’m dating now has been very patient with me, and so far, he seems to be exactly who he said he was when we first met,” she says.\n\nWhile she left the reunion on slightly better terms with Jeramey and Sarah Ann, Laura still doesn’t believe that the couple “feel remorse in their hearts for their actions.” Their apologies didn’t ring true because, as Laura sees it, the two are “only sorry for getting caught,” instead of taking real accountability for their behavior. “They have only ever ‘apologized’ after they got tangled up in their lies and then tried to blame me for their actions,” she says. “I do not wish them any bad luck but they are both irrelevant to me and my life.” And while time heals most wounds, don’t expect to see Laura and the duo grabbing drinks any time soon. “I have no respect for either of them,” she says. “There will never be a friendship.”\n\nJeramey and Sarah Ann are sharing their location… permanently.\n\nSTATUS: STILL TOGETHER\n\nJet Skiing off into the sunset was only the beginning of Jeramey and Sarah Ann’s love story. Since the pod squad barbecue, the two locked down the relationship and have been living together since October — pretend to be surprised, social media sleuths. And, in case you were wondering, yes, Jeramey does share his location with his new girlfriend after all the drama. “It’s my thing,” he jokes at the reunion. Both, however, still maintain that absolutely nothing physical happened the infamous night they met up while he was engaged to Laura, despite what others, including his ex, might allege.\n\nWhile the road to each other wasn’t exactly traditional by Love Is Blind standards, Jeramey and Sarah Ann still consider themselves proof of the experiment’s success. “I fell in love with who Jeramey is as a person and we had a strong connection from the very beginning of this experiment,” Sarah Ann says at the reunion. “I don’t think for a second that anything between us is fake.”\n\nLove Is Blind Relationship Rewind: Laura and JerameyCleaning is its own love language.\n\nThere have been some bumps along the way for the duo, according to Chelsea –– who revealed at the reunion that Jeramey had told her they’d split multiple times since the barbecue. “We have gone through real-life relationship stuff since we have been together,” he admits. “We did realize, fighting through things continuously, that we do love each other and we wanted to support each other through this process itself… and we’re still fighting for that every day.” Receiving a “ton of hate on the Internet” has seemingly only brought them closer. Plus, after Sarah Ann was booted from the girl’s group chat by Jessica, she doesn’t have many friends in the cast to depend on. But once the couple offers a sincere apology at the reunion to all who may have been hurt by their actions, there might just be hope for some reconciliation. “I think this experiment does work,” Sarah Ann says. “I’m sitting next to someone that I love with all my heart. In my pursuit of love, hearts got broken and I apologize for that. That’s not what I wanted. I’m sorry.”\n\nAD is “happy, lit, single, and ready to mingle.”\n\nSTATUS: SINGLE\n\nIt’s safe to say that after getting rejected at the altar, AD was… so not oh Clay. Looking back on her wedding, however, she doesn’t have any regrets about giving her heart to her ex-fiancé. “I said yes because I loved Clay, and I trusted him,” she tells Tudum. “I thought that we could have a beautiful life together if he were to open up and fully commit to me in the process.” Of course, Clay just couldn’t get there, admitting at the altar that he doesn’t believe he’s husband material. AD says she wasn’t exactly “blindsided” by his decision, adding that “Clay made a game day decision” in the moment. “Although it wasn’t in my favor, I think he did what was best for him,” she says.\n\nAfter the big day, AD took some distance from Clay to sort through her emotions. She even circled back to Matthew, whom she developed an early attraction to in the pods. “There was a little bit of connecting with Matthew,” she explains. “We had a few conversations and went on a few dates, actually.” But ultimately the two didn’t end up sparking a relationship, as AD says she’s currently “just happy, lit, single, and ready to mingle.” As for where she stands with Clay, who knows what the future holds — especially after he declared his love for her at the reunion. She maintains that the two “did not explore a relationship by any means” but have remained close. “We talk a lot. Not every day, not all day, but we do talk,” she says. “Clay’s the homie. We are friends. I’m happy for him and I’m happy for me.” And despite the deep affection the two have for each other, AD is standing strong in her convictions. “I really felt like Clay had his time, and what he did with that time is now something he has to deal with.”\n\nWith Love Is Blind behind her, AD has completely reevaluated her approach to relationships, saying, “Dating for me looks completely different now.” In the past, she’s been drawn to “a very particular type of man — kind of flashy, egotistical, very loud.” But now guys who don’t “present with their money or their looks” grab her attention. At the end of the day, AD says she’s searching for someone who really appreciates everything that she has to offer. And, for the record, that has nothing to do with appearances. “This experiment allowed me to go deeper and be proud of who I am, what my story is, and to share it with a man who’s going to openly receive it and accept me,” she says. “Moving forward, that’s how I will date in the future.”\n\nClay is committed… “to the money.”\n\nSTATUS: SINGLE\n\nConsider Clay completely “humbled” by his Love Is Blind experience. “It was a whole process of me building myself up, and then I had to get taken down a little bit, which is something I’m not really used to,” he tells Tudum. “I have a self-proclaimed huge ego, and I lead with that a lot, so I had to break that down.” Through it all, he credits AD for being his co-pilot on this journey of self-discovery, adding that she “did an amazing job of just sticking with me and helping me have that breakthrough moment.”\n\nLove Is Blind Relationship Rewind: Amber Desiree “AD” and ClayCan we get an “Oh, Clay!”\n\nClay has nothing but gratitude for his ex-fiancé, whom he called the “love of his life” at the Season 6 reunion. The two are “constantly in communication” and have remained friends, though clearly Clay has left the door open for something more. But admittedly, it will be an uphill battle after their disastrous wedding day. “Once you say no at the altar in front of someone’s family, it’s hard to pedal back and get back to where you guys were before,” he explains, adding that he’s grateful to AD for understanding what his perspective was and why he said no at the altar. “There’s no disrespect,” he adds. “At the end of the day, I love her and she’s an amazing person. I want to make sure that’s always stamped and clear.”\n\nFor the time being, Clay is focused on his career, including his booming rental business, while he puts dating on the back burner. “I’m committed to the money,” he says. “We went through a whole wedding process, so I don’t think it was easy or would be a good look for me to just jump back on a dating scene. I’ve been taking it easy, giving myself grace and focusing on the things that are giving me money.” But for the right person, Clay says he’s more than ready to make a commitment after working on himself in therapy over the past few months. “If I open my mind and heart up, I could accomplish amazing things,” he says. “I didn’t know if I was capable of giving or receiving love, and I definitely know that I am now.”\n\nChelsea knew she was strong, “but not this strong.”\n\nSTATUS: SINGLE\n\nYou might think you know Chelsea after watching her Love Is Blind journey, but she’s ever-changing. “The woman I am today doesn’t compare to the woman in the experiment,” she tells Tudum. “I knew I was strong but not this strong. I learned very quickly. I know my heart and who I am, so I never let it interfere with the love I have for myself.” Self-love is what she’s all about these days: Chelsea is currently single and embracing all that life has to offer. “I’ve spent this past year truly growing and focusing on myself,” she says. “I’m fully content with being by myself, but I am ready to start dating.” And thankfully, Chelsea has “the most amazing people” in her corner, helping her every step of the way, even at times when the social media discourse feels overwhelming.\n\nWhen it comes to her relationship with Jimmy, Chelsea says she regrets having worn “rose-colored glasses the entire relationship” because of how committed she was to their happily ever after. “I was so hopeful and overjoyed to be with him and feel loved,” she shares. “But I was always overlooking issues that would not fly with me today.” Reflecting on their time together, Chelsea says that her frustrations with Jimmy were absolutely “valid” and would never be ignored in the relationship she’s seeking in the future. “I was insecure in a relationship that didn’t make me feel secure,” she adds. The broken engagement opened Chelsea’s eyes to her non-negotiables going forward, including never settling for “disrespect, the lack of boundaries, or ever being made to quiet my emotions or feelings.”\n\nAs for the Megan Fox incident, Chelsea has a message to pass along. If she were to meet the actor one day, Chelsea already knows what she would tell her. “You are not just MGK’s wife or girlfriend to me. You are a queen. I had no business comparing myself to you,” she says, jokingly adding, “We are not even the same species.”\n\nJimmy is “not quite ready to take the plunge back into dating.”\n\nSTATUS: SINGLE\n\nIf Jimmy could go back in time, he’d make different choices about how his relationship with Chelsea ended. “I regret not breaking things off a bit earlier,” he tells Tudum. “After our last fight, to be specific, I promised her I’d take things day by day, forgive and try to move on. But ultimately, forgiving doesn’t always make things better.” However, Jimmy stands by the way he handled much of the rest of their engagement — including his infamous clash with Chelsea earlier in the Dominican Republic following his taquito-induced injury. “I bit the shit out of my lip and it hurt to talk,” he recalls. “It was kinda hard to be lovey-dovey and have a happy tone of voice after I chomped on it full force, six beers deep.”\n\nThese days, Jimmy is very much single — and that’s exactly how he’d like to stay for now. “Going through the experience was a lot for me, and after that I took some time to reflect on myself and really figure out what I want in a partner,” he says. Watching Love Is Blind with the rest of the world has also put his journey in perspective. “I still am going through those emotions and not quite ready to take the plunge back into dating,” Jimmy adds. But when he eventually decides to get back out there, he’ll be looking for “someone who can resolve conflict openly and have honest communication with boundaries set in place.” Thanks to his experience in the experiment, Jimmy knows he’ll approach dating differently this time around. “Love Is Blind opened me up to having deeper conversations faster and subscribing to the idea that I’m not in a rush,” he says.\n\nJess is looking for a guy to “teach [her] how to love better.”\n\nSTATUS: Tune in to Perfect Match later this year to find out 👀\n\nLay down your swords (and your EpiPens) because Jess is breathing easy on her own. As expected, life is all about Autumn, her 12-year-old daughter, who’s become a social media star in her own right. “Right now I’m very busy with Autumn and just taking care of myself,” Jess tells Tudum. “I’m just kind of relishing these last couple years before she’s a teenager and doesn’t want anything to do with me because right now, we are best friends. We do everything together.”\n\nAfter healing from her breakup with Jimmy, Jess says she’s “single, but not really dating.” For the record, there are zero lingering feelings for her former flame — Jess says that she “never had an afterthought about him” once she left the pods, even when they met in person at the barbecue. “When I heard about him and Chelsea not making it to the altar, I was so heartbroken for her,” Jess says, adding that she and Chelsea are “really good friends” today. “I was rooting for them the entire time.” As for her own love story, Jess is keeping the hope alive for the right guy to walk into her life. “I want to be with just a man who is a leader — someone who is humble, kind, and just teaches me how to love me better.” And while some guys might be intimated dating a woman with a child, Jess knows that her soulmate won’t just accept, but embrace her family.\n\nHoping for a second shot at love, Jess hit the beach for Perfect Match Season 2, where she developed a relationship with Harry Jowsey of Too Hot to Handle Season 1. The two instantly connected once Jess entered the villa, despite hearing warnings from some of the other women. Ultimately, Harry didn’t beat the allegations about his wandering eyes, or lips, after a dalliance with another cast member, leading to the pair’s eventual split. “I wouldn’t quite call us friends, but we’re definitely not enemies,” she tells Tudum about Harry in the official Perfect Match Season 2 status update. “At this point, I just have to meet him where he is. I mean, Harry is Harry.”\n\nTrevor is “going on dates with a new mindset.”\n\nSTATUS: SINGLE\n\nAfter experiencing the highs and lows of the experiment, Trevor has come out the other side with a different point of view. “I learned to just be myself right off the bat and not try and change who I am to appease a girl who I think is attractive and want to date,” he tells Tudum. “If you’re looking for a relationship, then get right into the nitty-gritty details of what you want.” In the future, Trevor plans to jumpstart sensitive conversations — be it about building a family or locking down a marriage timeline — with partners, so nobody wastes their time.\n\nThe project manager is currently single and dating around, but hasn’t found that special someone to take the next step with since filming ended. “I am definitely going on dates with a new mindset,” he says, adding that now he’s “giving different people a shot” who aren’t necessarily his type. “I’m not judging someone by their looks right off the bat in a good or bad way.”\n\nHe appeared on Perfect Match Season 2, where he joined the villa after many connections had already been formed — so the search for love continues.\n\nLove Is Blind Relationship Rewind: Chelsea and JimmyForget love triangles — this season brings us a love square!\n\nLooking back on his connection with Chelsea, the exes still don’t align on the proposal timeline. “I had an early morning date with Chelsea the day before proposals, and she had a night date with Jimmy,” he explains. “Jimmy was the first proposal and it’s hard to say no if someone proposes to you, so I think whoever went first might’ve got the yes because I do believe she had feelings for both of us, obviously.” When he and Chelsea eventually reconnected at the barbecue, Trevor says he “didn’t go in with any expectation to steal her back,” as he’d also formed a friendship with Jimmy. But if Chelsea had expressed some doubts, things might’ve been different. “I would definitely have given her another shot, but I wasn’t going to be the one to initiate that move because I didn’t see it as my place. I don’t want to ruin anybody’s happiness.”\n\nWhen he heard about her eventual breakup with Jimmy, Trevor says he’d already accepted that he and Chelsea weren’t meant to be together romantically. Today, the two consider each other close friends and speak frequently. “I like having a friend that I went through a crazy experience with and relate to,” Trevor says. “I don’t have any really close girlfriends like that, so I love that she’s in my life.”\n\nKenneth is “chilling on the love thing right now.”\n\nSTATUS: SINGLE\n\nWith Love Is Blind in the rearview, Kenneth is keeping his focus on building his career as a middle school principal. “The kids have seen [the show] and they’re fans of it,” he tells Tudum. “Everyone at my school is very supportive.” When it comes to dating today, Kenneth is currently single and keeping it that way for the time being. “Of course I’ve had opportunities, but I’ve just kind of been in the space of just wanting to really reground myself,” he says. “That’s kind of what my mindset has been, so I’ve just kind of been chilling on the love thing right now.” As for where he stands with Brittany, the two have remained great friends through it all. “I gained a true relationship with Brittany that I think will always be there no matter where we go,” he says. Most importantly, their experience together taught Kenneth that he’s able to “find someone who looks great,” whom he can also “connect with emotionally.”\n\nWhile the split might’ve seemed abrupt, Kenneth says that he was keenly aware of how the pressures of real life could overwhelm their relationship once they returned to Charlotte. “When we were in the Dominican Republic, I kept telling Brittany, ‘We are in bliss right now,’ ” he recalls. “I’m such a forward thinker, and I wanted to see how we would navigate the world when we’re back working, meeting each other’s families, and [doing] day-to-day responsibilities. [That’s when] different parts of our personalities showed up.” Kenneth readily admits that his introverted tendencies came to the forefront back at home. “Brittany saw those sides of me she hadn’t really seen,” he says. “For me, I got to see sides of Brittany that aren’t as bubbly.”\n\nAnd while Kenneth accepts that he was perhaps a bit too attached to his phone, he maintains that he was very present with Brittany. “I tend to unpack things internally, so being on my phone wasn’t me being disengaged. It was really me just taking a moment,” he explains, adding that he was even using his phone to “self-regulate” his emotions through the Mindfulness app. “I was reading prompts like ‘take a deep breath’ or ‘look outside the window right now,’ so I wouldn’t respond impulsively.” Despite the challenges, there was still no question in Kenneth’s mind that he would marry Brittany, adding that he was “running 100 miles per hour to the altar.” But when she expressed concern over not having the “crave” for Kenneth, he had to slow down and reevaluate. “My perspective was: Even though we were having challenging moments that’s just part of this [experience], she was still my person,” he says. “So I needed Brittany to say that for me to [realize] that it’s admirable to be willing to fight for her, but I also had to respect where we both were.” While he didn’t end up at the altar, Kenneth looks back on the experience with only fond memories, especially when it comes to Brittany. “It’s just been a joy to watch our love story unfold again,” he says. “I don’t have any regrets. I just learned so many things about me that I wouldn’t have if I didn’t experience this.”\n\nBrittany is “confident in being alone” until the right guy comes along.\n\nSTATUS: SINGLE\n\nSo, has Brittany gotten that “crave” for anyone else lately? Not exactly. “I am single and not dating,” she tells Tudum. “I’m actually really enjoying this process, being in the moment, and truly focusing on myself. I’m confident with being alone until I know exactly [which] person’s going to meet me here.” Going forward, she’ll continue to not budge on having “very high standards” when it comes to nonnegotiables in a relationship. “It’s okay to ask for your wants and your needs,” Brittany says. “If someone isn’t doing what you like, then it’s okay to actually pull back. ‘Here’s my standards, here’s my boundaries, and I need you to meet them.’ ”\n\nAnd while Kenneth may not have been her perfect match, in some ways the two have only gotten closer since their split. “We established the foundation [for our friendship] literally 10 minutes after the cameras cut off,” she recalls. “We were like, ‘This is no one else’s decision but ours, and we’re going to remain friends because that’s what we want to do.’ We have gotten so close and we didn’t go through this alone.” Reflecting on their breakup, Brittany says the two ultimately couldn’t make the transition from pod life to real life. When they were first dating, Brittany says that she and Kenneth were on the same page after forming an intense connection from the start. But once they got to the Dominican Republic, things began to shift. “Our chemistry and our passion for each other kind of dwindled,” she says. “Having that crave is very vital within a relationship and when we weren’t able to feel it, that’s where our relationship kind of took a turn.”\n\nLove Is Blind Relationship Rewind: Brittany and KennethIntroducing the pod squad's two young hearts with old souls.\n\nTelling Kenneth that she didn’t desire him physically was “actually very hard” for Brittany, who “tried to approach [the conversation] in the best way possible.” But his measured and compassionate response in the moment revealed why she chose him in the first place. “It was handled with maturity and respect and allowed both of us to walk away from that situation in confidence and in a companionship. We had a wonderful experience and we’re going to remain close friends and honor what we had, because there’s no reason to throw it away.”\n\nThrough the tears and the hardships, Brittany is proud of how she led with vulnerability and showed up as her authentic self. “I can confidently say that I don’t have any regrets throughout the experience watching it back,” she says. “The world is getting me truthfully… and there’s so much beauty in that.”"
