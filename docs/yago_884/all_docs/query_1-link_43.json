        "text": "Before the final title, Visions of Eight, was chosen, the film was known by several working titles: A 31 Jul 1972 HR news item referred to it as, Munich ‘72; in a 12 Aug 1972 LAHExam news item it was called XX Olympiad; a 13 Dec 1972 Var news item listed it as The Official Film Olympiad and a 23 Jan 1973 HR news item used the name “The Official Film XX Olympiad”; and a 23 Mar 1973 HR news item declared that Pieces of Eight was set as the final title. Although the film was not copyrighted at the time of its release, it was registered on 28 Aug 2001 under the number RE-851-259.\n\nPrior to the opening credits, the following written statement appears: \"Sunflowers are familiar to millions, yet no one ever saw them the way Vincent Van Gogh did. So with the Olympics: a recurring spectacle familiar to people around the world. This is no chronological record, no summary of winners and losers. Rather, it is a separate vision of eight singular film artists.\" After the opening title, the words \"A Film by (in alphabetical order)\" appear, followed by eight title cards, one for each of the film's directors: \"Milos Forman (Czechoslovakia); Kon Ichikawa (Japan); Claude Lelouch (France); Juri Ozerov (U.S.S.R.); Arthur Penn (United States); Michael Pfeghar (West Germany); John Schlesinger (Great Britain); Mai Zetterling (Sweden).\" Individual title cards for each of the film's eight segments, with attributions for the respective director, then appear, listed in the order in which the segments appear.\n\nAt the end of the film, prior to the end credits, a title card is presented with a quotation attributed to Baron Pierre de Coubertin, President of the International Olympic Committee, 1896--1925: \"The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.\" Following several screens listing the film's principal production credits, credits for each segment are presented. For the segment \"The Longest,\" Jim Clark's credit reads \"Associate director and editor.\" Most of the directors provided off-screen narration for their respective segments.\n\nAfter credits for individual segments, the remaining production credits are presented. Then, a statement reading \"Filmed with the cooperation of Bavaria Atelier GmBH, Munich\" is followed by another title card reading \"The producers wish to acknowledge the cooperation of the Organizing Committee of the XXth OLYMPIAD and its President, Willi Daume.\" At the conclusion of the end credits, a written dedication reads: \"In memory of the 11 slain Israeli Athletes, tragic victims of the violence of our times.\"\n\nA 20 Oct 1971 Var article reported that a deal had been made between Wolper Pictures and Bavaria Atelier to co-produce the official film of the 1972 Olympic games, with each company contributing fifty percent of the proposed $1,500,000 budget. The Olympic committee itself was not to invest in filming, but would retain “artistic control” and global video rights. The Var article also disclosed that, initially, Wolper intended to employ international directors, national directors noted for special work and young student directors from film schools throughout world, each representing one nation. Contracted at this point to represent their countries were Schlesinger and Ozerov, Federico Fellini of Italy and Francois Truffaut of France. It was also revealed in the article that Japan’s Akira Kurosawa, Spain’s Luis Bunuel and ex-Polish national Roman Polanski were interested, but not yet been signed for the project.\n\nA 1 May 1972 DV article reported that nine directors had been contracted for the picture. In addition to Zetterling and Ichikawa, whose intended subjects were filmed and included, Ousmane Sembene from Senegal was to film Africans during training and in Olympic competition, and Penn was to follow the story of incarcerated pugilist Bobby Lee Hunter. A 24 May 1972 Var article reported that Hunter, who was serving time for homicide in a South Carolina penitentiary, might temporarily be released in order to join the United States Olympic boxing team, and that Penn already had filmed some scenes of him training in prison. The 20 Oct 1971 Var article also disclosed that a tenth director, Franco Zeffirelli, representing Italy, would depict bearers of the Olympic Flame on their relay race from Greece to Munich’s opening ceremony. However, an 11 Sep 1972 Newsweek article reported that Hunter did not become part of the American team and that Zeffirelli had quit the project in protest over the “politicalization of the Olympic spirit” when Rhodesia, then an apartheid country, was excluded from the games. According to the Newsweek article, Wolper was able to secure every director he wanted for the film except one, Sweden’s Ingmar Bergman. A 9 Aug 1972 Var news item revealed that renowned French mime Marcel Marceau had been cast to do impressions of the major Olympic events throughout the picture; however, he was not included in the film.\n\nIn a 17 Sep 1972 LAT “Calendar” article, producer Stan Margulies’ son Lee disclosed some of the difficulties of filming the project: The film was the first documentary project for Margulies and most of the directors, three of whom did not speak English; seventeen nationalities were involved; just as the athletes had only one chance to accomplish their tasks, no retakes were possible for the filmmakers; two of the segments needed as much planning as entire feature films, with the men’s 100-meter dash requiring thirty-four cameras and the marathon race requiring sixty; when Palestinian guerrillas took eleven Israeli athletes hostage, there was a possibility that the games would end prematurely before three of the directors had not finished their sequences. (For additional information on the crisis, consult the entry above for the 2005 film Munich.)\n\nA 7 Sep 1972 HR news item reported that the Wolper Pictures made an extensive record of the terrorist situation. Wolper’s team photographed the events throughout the ordeal, and from his hotel room at the Olympic Village, they witnessed the boarding of the helicopters to the NATO airport where all of the hostages and some of the guerrillas were killed. Lelouch was at the airport with his crew during the fatal exchange of gunfire between the terrorists and the West German police, but it was too dark to record any usable footage. After the memorial service in the Olympic Stadium, Wolper decided that the tragedy would be included in the film.\n\nThe final sequence by Schlesinger, which focused on marathon runner Ron Hill, was the only part of the film that included the subject of the terrorist attack and caused some controversy. A 22 May 1973 HR “Report from Cannes” news item reported that, after the screening, many journalists were shocked at Hill’s disinterest in the killings as shown in the segment, but Wolper defended the director’s choice to focus on the total involvement of athletes in their sports. A 23 May 1973 HR “Report from Cannes” news item disclosed that after the screening, Wolper was confronted with the accusation that Sembene’s segment had been cut because it contained footage of the killings. Wolper responded that, after delivering his film, Sembene had not responded to repeated communications from the producers, who were therefore unable to prepare the music and soundtrack to complete his segment. Wolper insisted that Sembene’s segment did not contain footage of tragedy and offered to show the footage to prove it. Reviews of the film were for the most part positive, and most did not mention the hostage crisis; however, the 27 Aug 1973 New York review stated that a straight documentary with one director would have been better able to address the unexpected tragedy, noting “a hole in the center” of the film.\n\nA 25 Jun 1973 DV news item disclosed that Visions of Eight was given a special award at the Cannes Film Festival, after which EMI made the first deal for British distribution. As reported in a 27 Aug 1973 DV news item, the film was selected for a special screening at the Atlanta Film Festival and was also shown at the Moscow Film Festival. Visions of Eight won the 1974 Golden Globe for Best Documentary Film.\n\nLess\n\nThis documentary about the 1972 Munich Olympics consists of eight segments, each made by a different director and covering one aspect of the games. In “The Beginning,” director Juri Ozerov explains his interest in showing the tension of athletes waiting to perform. Then a narrator describes the Olympic Village as people wait for the games to begin, and athletes are seen praying, practicing, stretching and pacing. When a starter pistol signals the beginning of a race, intercuts show action shots of contestants from various sports. The next section, “The Strongest,” by Mai Zetterling is about weightlifting. Zetterling explains that she knew nothing about the sport but was fascinated by the obsession of the participants. Weightlifters are shown first during their strenuous training, then in Olympic competition as their coaches nervously watch. After a winner is announced, five soldiers are required to lift the dumbbell and place it on a forklift for removal. As the next segment, “The Highest” by Arthur Penn, comes gradually into focus, the featured event is pole vaulting, presented in slow motion as man after man attempts to clear the bar. Some succeed and others fail as the crowd cheers. The segment ends with one man smiling broadly as he slowly falls to earth in triumph. “The Women” begins with director Michael Pfleghar's revelation that women were not allowed at the first Olympics, even as spectators, but were represented at Munich that year by the greatest number in the history of games. Women athletes from all nations are seen in swimming and various track and field events. The camaraderie of the women and disappointment of the losers is emphasized, and the segment ends with a gymnastics routine by one young girl, seen in slow motion. Director Kon Ichikawa introduces “The Fastest,” explaining that men in one-hundred meter finals cover that distance in ten seconds, and that he used thirty-four cameras and 20,000 feet of film to capture these fleeting moments. Several racers are seen in extreme slow motion as a narrator analyzes their facial expressions, and after this, the entire race is shown in real time. “The Decathlon” opens with director Milos Forman’s narration recalling his boyhood dream to see the Olympics and revealing that the Decathlon is the toughest discipline in track and field, requiring athletes to perform in ten different events in two days. As Bavarian folk music and yodeling are heard on the soundtrack, footage of the musicians is interspersed with action on the track, and an orchestra performs Beethoven’s 9th Symphony as the fifteen-hundred meter race is run. In “The Losers,” Claude Lelouch's narration describes his desire to show how the competitors accepted their losses and met their sudden loneliness. The segment opens with a boxer who resists accepting his defeat, then losing athletes from various sports display their anger and disappointment. In the end, after trying to complete his event several times, an injured wrestler finally accepts his loss and is helped out by the winner. “The Longest,” by John Schlesinger, begins with the director explaining his fascination with the individual effort of marathon runners, who train alone for a year for the twenty-six mile race. As a runner begins his daily practice, news of the Palestinian terrorists holding nine Israeli athletes hostage is heard over a radio and news photographers surround the Olympic Village. Newspaper photographs and headlines detail the tragedy, while one English runner, Ron Hill, declares that he will not be distracted from his marathon by the hostage crisis. Hill is then shown in England during his long preparation for the Olympic event as a narrator describes his grueling routine. The marathon is shown at its start in the stadium, through the streets of Munich and returning to the stadium, where Hill finishes sixth. The closing ceremonies of the twentieth Olympiad are briefly shown, as the torch is extinguished and people weep for the murdered Israeli athletes. Finally, Hill is shown back in England, returning from a pre-Olympics practice run.\n\nLess"
