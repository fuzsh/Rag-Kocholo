        "text": "Remember when a disposable camera was on every summer camp packing list as a kid? There was such a thrill in taking the photos and not knowing how they might turn out. Then finally getting to see them all developed after you returned home was like magic. Well, this nostalgic couple’s film photography session felt just like that!\n\nDestiny & Zach met up with me at the beach in Laguna, California just before sunset for a quick film photography session. We ran around the beach laughing and playing, just wanting to document the evening in a very authentic and romantic way. Shooting on film was the perfect choice to capture this living-in-the-moment feeling. There was no fixing hair, no re-do shots, no fuss. Just capturing things as they happened and seeing how they turned out later.\n\nWell, the results were incredible! The images made for the most nostalgic couple’s film photography and perfectly captured the carefree feeling of the evening. If you love the look of the film and all the romantic vibes they bring, then consider adding a film package to your session! I would love to create some images like these to add to your gallery.\n\nPhotographer: @marissa_kaitlyn_"
