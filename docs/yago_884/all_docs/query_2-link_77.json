        "text": "NETFLIX'S LOVE IS Blind is going full swing into season six — which, as always, is more than delivering on the drama and tension. This year, the series united a bunch of Charlotte, North Carolina-based singles to participate in the dating experiment. Like most past seasons, there were plenty of love triangles as the men and women were sorting through their options in the pods. Numbers-wise, five couples were engaged and got to know each other in the Dominican Republic and Charlotte.\n\nAs the season progressed, some contestants couldn’t handle the pressure of the show or the challenges that were present in their relationships. The finale saw two weddings take place. However, those who have yet to watch might wonder who tied the knot this year.\n\nIn the final batch of episodes, Amy and Johnny continued the smooth sailing in their relationship, as his family absolutely adores her. On the flip side, Jimmy and Chelsea hit some rocky moments with intense arguments. And one of the other couples completely crashed and burned over an overarching love triangle.\n\nThis doesn’t even account for anyone who might have rekindled their relationship between the time the cameras stopped rolling and the reunion picked back up. Thankfully, the recent reunion had no shortage of drama and also managed to clear up any questions viewers had about what the couples have been up to since filming wrapped nearly a year ago.\n\nHere’s what to know about where the Love Is Blind season six couples are now.\n\nWhich Love Is Blind Season 6 Couples Are Still Together?\n\nAmy & Johnny\n\nAmy and Johnny remained arguably the most solid of the couples this season. During the time in the pods, the two focused solely on their relationship without feeling torn between other options or being tied to any drama. This led them to get engaged early on — and their connection grew even stronger in the real world.\n\nThe couple’s biggest downfall throughout the season was the fact that they approached sex differently, but they worked on growing through it together. They take a dance class. They laugh and chase each other around the kitchen. His family loves her so much. And Amy and Johnny just seemed to enjoy each other’s presence — proof that they were able to fall in love behind a wall.\n\nTheir close bond pays off, as Amy and Johnny say yes to each other on their wedding day, making them the only couple to do so this season. It served as a beautiful ending to the love story that fans had watched play out, and it was only fitting that the scenery and Amy’s outfit looked straight out of a fairytale.\n\nThe reunion confirmed that the two are still going strong in their marriage, making them another success story from the show.\n\nBrittany & Kenneth\n\nBrittany and Kenneth seemed like a sweet couple, given how similar they were regarding their beliefs in love and life. While getting to know each other in the pods, they had some emotional bonding moments about the fact that they had both lost a parent. The two seemed like they had genuine potential to go the distance.\n\nShortly after they started living together, though, their relationship fizzled out. The two had an incredibly awkward final conversation, where Brittany felt he wasn’t putting in the effort that was matching hers in the time they spent together, and Kenneth just sort of shut things down. Viewers also didn’t like that instead of Kenneth taking accountability for no longer feeling connected to her, he tried to blame their issues on Brittany.\n\nHe did give some insight into what his thought process was during filming at the time. “And so, even with me feeling those moments of Brittany and I might maybe not be on the same page, I still said to myself, ‘I’m going to go with it,’” Kenneth shared with People Magazine recently. “But at that final moment, I was like, ‘Yeah, this is it… We’re here, with a week’s time,’ so not the best thing to keep going.”\n\nWhile this wouldn’t rule out the fact that they could be just dating after filming the show, Brittany and Kenneth haven’t interacted with each other much on social media outside of a standard follow. At the reunion, they did still seem to be in a good place with one another.\n\nAmber Desiree “AD” & Clay\n\nAmber Desiree “AD” and Clay had a little love triangle before pairing up. AD was building relationships with him and a financial advisor named Matthew. While it seems like she was leading to pick the latter, things take a turn when she catches that Matthew had been telling her the same phrases as another woman.\n\nBecause of this, she leans further into Clay’s arms, even if there had been a little bit of a toxic dynamic in the pods. But, to be fair, production warned us a bit, as he first appeared to chat with AD right after she was discussing red flags in a confessional.\n\nClay’s family is a little hesitant about her too. AD is a VIP Manager at a club and works as a realtor while wanting to be an investor eventually. Because of her current job, they are a bit wary about the long hours. Their differing work schedules made AD feel distant from him and wish that he would come home to spend time together. Clay is just very stuck in a mindset of wanting to work and further his career. He also has an intense fear of feeling like he’s going to cheat for some reason.\n\nHowever, AD’s mom also thinks he is a man with a good head on his shoulders and a strong ethic who can see just how strong their connection is — as long as he can remain faithful. As the final decision approaches, their nerves start to set in, but Clay receives an encouraging speech from his father in the finale that seems to provide a clear decision in his mind.\n\nAs the first wedding decision is up, AD walks down the aisle as a violin orchestra plays, raising the emotions and the tension. It turns out there was something to worry about, as she says “I do” and he does not, pointing out that while he loves her and is “rocking with” her, it wasn’t responsible for them to tie the knot just yet. It’s unclear if the two will continue to date, but they both confirmed that they still have feelings for one another, so a reconciliation could be in the cards.\n\nChelsea & Jimmy\n\nIt’s hard to even know where to begin when it comes to Chelsea and Jimmy. The two had a rollercoaster of a time in the pods. Jimmy had been pursuing a relationship with Jessica, who he ultimately rejected to be with Chelsea — leading to Jessica giving one hell of a rejection speech. Meanwhile, Chelsea was torn between the secure choice of Trevor, who was all-in for her and different than who she typically dates, or Jimmy. Because of this, it is a match that already seems doomed.\n\nThen, there’s the clear discomfort Jimmy felt when meeting her for the first time in person. In the pods, Chelsea had mentioned she had been compared to Megan Fox in the past — which has also since divided the internet regarding whether she actually does.\n\nAs soon as they started hanging out in the Dominican Republic, Chelsea felt unloved and disconnected from Jimmy. He also makes an uncomfortable comment about AD’s body while meeting the other couples, which adds to Chelsea’s spiraling. When living together, the two have an explosive fight where Jimmy reveals he feels that she is smothering him — but they discuss it the morning after and make up during an emotional conversation. They both take accountability for the things they need to work on. Jimmy also admits he “loves her so much more” after meeting her friends.\n\nWhen they seem to be moving in the right direction, Chelsea’s distrust gets in the way once more. The two fight over the fact that Jimmy went out for a drink without her for a friend’s birthday — and other girls were there. She feels lied to because he told her he didn’t like to party. She once again questions who he texts and where he goes without her, suggesting he could be cheating and secretly meeting up with Jess.\n\nHe denies this, and after another heart-to-heart, the two seemingly grow even stronger and set boundaries. Chelsea even manages to feel secure when Jimmy meets Jess in person, proving she is making an effort to trust her love. However, in the final moments, the two crumble into pieces over whether their relationship is in a place where they can be in a marriage during a hard-to-watch conversation.\n\nJimmy simply admits that while he loves her and they both want to stay together, he can’t go to the altar and Chelsea does not take the news kindly. She bursts into tears and feels that he wasted her time, given that she had been planning their wedding. Just like that, another couple is crossed out from season six.\n\nLike the possibility of Clay and AD, Jimmy and Chelsea could simply just be dating off the show since the two still follow each other on Instagram. Chelsea liked one of Jimmy’s posts as recently as last month, according to Radio Times, which seems to be a hopeful sign — and he has been liking more of hers also. The two were also spotted together at an airport and having dinner recently. However, while at the reunion, they didn’t clarify exactly where their relationship stands today, so hopefully, those questions get answered soon.\n\nLaura & Jeramey\n\nIt wouldn’t be Love Is Blind if there wasn’t somehow a third love entanglement this season. Jeramey is a construction department manager who had been pursuing Laura (whom he ultimately proposed to) and Sarah Ann. Although he had an amicable breakup with the latter, the two made it clear in the pods that they felt they had a stronger sexual chemistry.\n\nSo, it wasn’t surprising that as soon as these two stepped out of the pods, there was instantly trouble in paradise. At the beach party, Jeramey shared a “joke” that Laura made about doing something inappropriate to AD, which made AD (and Clay) weirded out, and Laura upset at her fiancé for selling her out.\n\nLater in the season, while meeting her parents, the two continue their awkwardly tense dynamic when Laura explains how they are still sort of in a love triangle because Sarah Ann DM’ed Jeramey on Instagram, and he chose to respond. During a time when they should be convincing love to her family, the two just seem like they hate everything the other person does. She admits she gets the ick from certain things he does (like wearing Hawaiian shirts), and he throws subtle digs at her. “You guys talk pretty harshly to each other sometimes,” her mom points out in their private conversation — proof that maybe they do know best.\n\nIt seems she was right because things turn out to be even worse when Laura discovers that Jeramey spent the night with Sarah Ann, as all the couples and past contestants are back in close proximity. The conversation is frankly uncomfortable to watch as Jeramey lies with a straight face and digs himself into a deeper hole until Laura reveals that she is fully aware he was actually at Sarah Ann’s house. Even his mom knows he messed up when he tells her the situation.\n\nThe chance of these two reconciling is close to impossible. Laura stopped speaking to him for days, and when they discussed it at a public event with the entire cast, she ripped into Jeramey. Apparently, he attempted to send her flowers, she claims she politely declined, he disagrees, and she goes full throttle — telling him to pull the texts up for once. She even went as far as to call him a “con artist” and he packed up her stuff to come pick up. Jeramey then had no problem jumping back into his relationship with Sarah Ann in minutes during a jet ski montage that felt right out of a horror movie.\n\nJust like that, Laura and Jeramey were done before even making it to the altar for an answer."
