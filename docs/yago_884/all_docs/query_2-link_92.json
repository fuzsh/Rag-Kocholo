        "text": "WORDS: elliott hughes | PHOTOGRAPHY: romantic road\n\nRomantic Road is a travelogue film that chronicles the 8000-mile, six-month odyssey undertaken by an older upper-class English couple across the Indian sub-continent in a battered 1936 Rolls-Royce.\n\nThe protagonists of Romantic Road are Rupert Grey, a lawyer and descendant of 19th century Prime Minister Earl Grey, and his wife, Jan. The film’s appeal stems from the duality of Rupert’s identity as an establishment figure with rebellious, hippie tendencies, and Jan’s reasoned and tempered influence.\n\nThe retired couple nurse their pre-war car through the attrition of the Himalayas, attend a photography festival in Bangladesh, and even get involved in a Bollywood film in which Rupert is cast as a tyrannical British coloniser, much to his discomfort.\n\nRupert and Jan also become acquainted with a diverse array of people along the way, interacting with chai wallahs, maharajas and over-zealous border officials.\n\nWhile the geographical endpoint for the couple’s journey is a human-rights festival in Bangladesh, Rupert yearns for the journey to conclude with something more ethereal; a spiritual reconnection with his late father, the original owner of the Greys’ faithful Rolls.\n\nMore information on Romantic Road can be found on the official website. The film was released on October 8 and is showing specially chosen UK theatres, including:\n\nZEFFIRELLIS Ambleside [ Oct 8th 20:30 ] [ ongoing ]\n\nKINOKULTURE Shropshire [ Oct 13 19:30 ] [ Oct 14 19:30 ]\n\nARTS PICTUREHOUSE Cambridge [ Oct 15th ] [ ongoing ]\n\nILKLEY CINEMA [Oct 15th 11:30 ] [ Oct 18th 17:30 ] [Oct 20 13:30 ] [ Oct 21st 14:00 ]\n\nCINEMA CITY NORWICH PICTUREHOUSE [ Oct 8th 10:20 & 12:20 ] [ Oct 11th 10:15 & 16:30 ] [ ongoing ]\n\nKESWICK ALHAMBRA CINEMA [ Oct 29th ] [ Nov 5th ]\n\nLIGHTHOUSE POOLE CINEMA [ Nov 6th ] [ Nov 9th ]\n\nCORN EXCHANGE NEWBURY [ Nov 5th ] [ Nov 6th ] [ Nov 10th ] [Nov 11th]\n\nPLYMOUTH ARTS CINEMA [ Nov 26 ]\n\nNO.6 CINEMA Portsmouth [ Dec 9th ]\n\nMore screenings are constantly being added to the list, while Romantic Road will be available on DVD and via streaming services in early 2022."
