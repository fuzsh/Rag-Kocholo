It was ostensibly the era of the \"swinging\" married couples, although this phenomenon may have been more widespread in the movies than in the the bedroom. This film purports to shine a light. Please note that someone has taped a handwritten note to the poster giving it an unofficial \"R\" rating, resulting in our grading it in very good condition MovieArt Austin guarantees that this poster is an authentic U.S. one-sheet poster for this film. MovieArt Austin will sell no reproductions.\n\nMACK BING - Director"
