        "text": "Geraldine Brown Giomblanco has faith. Her husband, Mark, has insight.\n\nThat's how they met. She was taking the word of her mother's neighbor that this blind date — when she was 49 and still, by choice, unmarried — would be different.\n\nHe had seen only the photo she had sent. No glamor portrait, it was an impromptu shot of her, wrapped in a beach towel, sans makeup, wet hair slicked back and hugging her two young nieces. In that photo, Mark Giomblanco still saw a sincere and affectionate person he could possibly spend time with.\n\nThanks to that faith and insight, the couple now have each other. And, as it turns out, they have a story that is on track to become a film.\n\nBrown Giomblanco, now 56, wrote a book, \"Geraldina and the Compass Rose,\" detailing her search for love over 30 years of her adult life. It unflinchingly details her mistakes, the near-marriages, the disasters as she navigates a career in marketing. There was, it recalls, a brush so close with Mr. Wrong she wrote a list of top 50 qualifications for Mr. Right.\n\nThis book looks like a movie\n\n\"Geraldina and the Compass Rose\" was written, she says, to give hope to those people who are still waiting for that right person, that filling of that void in their lives. But while the couple have been marketing the book, it caught the eye of with Rob Simmons CEO of JARS Media Group, producer of over feature films such as “Wild Oats,” “Ten Thousan Saints,” and “Human Capital.”\n\nSweet beginnings: Naples 'Table Wars' finalist brings Valentine table ideas\n\nAND: 'Bright Star' set to sparkle at TheatreZone, with Martin-Brickell songs, true story\n\nNext came the screenplay, which is complete to the point at which Brown Giomblanco admitted she's now calling incidents in her book \"scenes.\"\n\nAnd there are plenty of scenes:\n\nThe Italian romance that taught her a valuable lesson in expecting 1960s film stories to come to life.\n\nThe party psychic she laughed at — until his predictions began coming true.\n\nMost of all, the stranger in the Milwaukee airport, who appeared out of nowhere to keep her company for a six-hour layover, and who told her that her grandmother, Rosaria Gentile, had a message for her.\n\n\"Now, my grandmother had died in 1993.This happened June 20, 1995,\" said Brown Giamblanco, recalling how the whole experience had moved her. \"I wrote it all down in a diary as soon as I got home. And I said I'd met my guardian angel, and my Grandma Rose sent him to me.\"\n\nHer grandmother, Rosaria Gentile had been Geraldine's \"compass rose,\" a constant in her life, radiating faith and unconditional love. She had even named her granddaughter, calling her \"my little Geraldina,\" the Italian form.\n\n\"For 20 years, that sustained me,\" Brown Giomblanco said of the stranger's words. \"But sometimes I'd be standing, looking up at the sky, saying to Grandma, \"Is this the one?' Or maybe a job, move something that's going on — what is this message that she had for me?\"\n\nShe would only find out at the tail end of a bad romance, when her mother's neighbor pressed her to take Giomblanco's phone number. In the meantime, he was reeling from a divorce after 25 years of marriage, a wonderful marriage for most of it, he thought.\n\n\"It's as though you lost an arm or a leg. You have to spend some time alone. After that long, you develop these co-dependencies you're not aware of,\" he said. \"I spent a good eight months by myself. I really wanted to heal.\"\n\nHe's looking for genuine\n\nMark had just begun dating when their mutual friend suggested he meet Geri. Her photo, meant to ward off anyone looking only for appearances, actually attracted Mark.\n\n\"I was intrigued right away,\" he said. \"All you see is this lovely smile and, to me, someone who looks so happy.\"\n\nTheir first date was an entire weekend aboard his boat off Montauk, New York — with her own cabin provided. Within a weekend, it was the comfort zone, the tastes, the enthusiasm for outdoor life that made Geri feel her grandmother was sending her signs.\n\nTen best: Wines and cocktails for Valentine's Day 2022: Sip and savor the romance\n\nWhen the two made plans to be married, it was Mark who pestered Geri to get her an engagement ring. She dismissed it as a tradition for young kids — and an expensive one at that. But he eventually goaded her into Lord & Taylor, \"just to look.\"\n\nThe white gold diamond ring with triple-tiers of three baguettes won her over. But its significance would go far beyond its classic style. When their salesperson, a friendly older Italian-born woman, handed them her business card, Geri began shaking.\n\nIt was Rosaria Gentile. Her own grandmother's name.\n\n\"That was like a Hail Mary pass,\" Mark declared. \"She almost jumped over the counter to hug her.\"\n\nThe two were married Aug. 6, 2016, aboard the 45-foot Viking boat Mark had owned, and rechristened it that same day.\n\n\"We changed the name from Passing Through to Geraldina,\" she said, beaming.\n\n\"My guy friends were not happy. They were like, 'My wife wants her name on their boat now,'\" Mark Giomblanco said, chuckling.\n\nThey're here, but not retired\n\nThe couple retired in 2019 to Naples, where Mark's parents lived. They didn't stay retired long.\n\n\"When I was younger, I'd hear older couples where the wife would say, 'I wish my husband would do something now that he's retired.'\" he said. \"Two years later (after retirement), Geraldine's saying, 'You think you could find something to do?'\"\n\nA charter captain by trade, Mark had learned the tricky shallows of the Gulf canals by taking smaller boats out when he came down to visit his parents. He learned the waterways in depth from Dean Murphy of the Naples Princess charter.\n\n\"I took all those years of boating experience traveling up and down the East Coast and put it into this part-time fun gig that I have,\" he said, but emphasized it requires a commitment to the learning curve. \"There are shallow waters and it can be tricky here. You really have to know what you're doing.\"\n\nValentine's dinner: Where to find specials in Naples, Bonita Springs\n\nGeri knows she wants to \"be in places that bring me joy.\" She's thought about returning to shopping center development \"because this is Florida and it's going crazy here.\" But she is enjoying both teaching as a catechist at St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church and doing wedding setup work for a local florist, Jardin Floral Design.\n\nYet her passion is motivational speaking. She's hoping \"Geraldine and the Compass Rose\" will give her an entrée into that world. (She has a public meeting and book signing 4-7 p.m. Friday, Feb. 18, at The Gallery in the Ritz-Carlton Beach Resort, 280 Vanderbilt Beach Road, Naples.) Still, Brown Giomblanco is philosophical about the future.\n\n\"When you're on a faith-filled journey the outcome is not up to you,\" she said.\n\nAnd it's all about that faith-filled journey: \"If I didn't have that I don't where I'd be right now.\"\n\n“Geraldina and the Compass Rose (gbg Books; $18.99) is available at the Barnes & Noble at Waterside Shops, on Amazon and other online bookstores; it is available in an audiobook version as well.”\n\nHarriet Howard Heithaus covers arts and entertainment for the Naples Daily News/naplesnews.com.
