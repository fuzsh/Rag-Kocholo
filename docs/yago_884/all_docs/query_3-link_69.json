        "text": "In this essay I intend to discuss the new woman in Mai Zetterling’s film The Girls (Flickorna, 1968) following and developing the thoughts of Louise Wallenberg in her essay Stilleristic Women: Gender as Masque and Ambivalence in the Work of Mauritz Stiller on early cinema’s filmmaker Mauritz Stiller and the female characters in his film Erotikon (1920). Although a paradox in understanding the Swedish middle class I will look for guidance from an advocate of the working-class woman and Soviet scholar Alexandra Kollontai in her 1918 essay “New Woman”. I believe that her thinking although written almost 50 years prior to Flickorna remains relevant and resonates perfectly with the gender struggles of middle-class women of the west, or at least how Zetterling interpreted in the film the political climate of that time.\n\nSwedish contemporary cinema is full of different attempts to present the Swedish culture and landscape through different genres. many of those films found their way to European and even the global market. However, the majority remains under local or regional exposure especially since they are not targeting a global audience and using the Swedish language which makes them less appealing to the international audience except in some cases. In this essay, I will discuss how three different films were perceived differently at the global and local box offices and what are the mutual elements that can be found in these films. And what are the differences when it comes to the representations of society?\n\nWhen Cyndi Lauper tweaked the lyrics of Robert Hazard’s “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” she gave us more than a 1980s feminist anthem about sexual freedom; she centred pleasurable female experiences in the pop-cultural imagination and made girlish fun a birthright. Since its release, the song has functioned as narrative shorthand for feminine enjoyment, accompanying film and television sequences that expand its meaning beyond its erotic origins and spotlight female-identified protagonists indulging in fun activities. While not all on-screen moments of girlish fun rely on Lauper’s remake, they hold in common the spectacularised expression of a feminine sensibility presumably shared by all girls and women."
