From her childhood in Sweden, to Hoolywood and beyond; Mai takes us through each stage of her life with uncompromising honest and self-awareness. She describes her relationship with her children ('I was a no good mother'), her two husbands ('I have been ruled by love all my life and I know that marriage is not the answer') and her lovers, including Herbert Lom, Peter Finch - and Tyrone Power, with whom she had a much publicised and passionate affair."
