        "text": "\"What's wrong with the world is that women always say that love is all that matters. It isn't.\"\n\nSince December, Criterion Channel has offered three works directed by actress-turned-filmmaker Mai Zetterling in the 1960s, including her masterpiece, The Girls, I find myself just as intrigued by her feature debut, Loving Couples, for similar reasons; despite the tendency that the audience may have to compare her with Ingmar Bergman - specifically thanks to the cast and also the cinematography by Sven Nykvist - there is no question that Zetterling had her own distinct voice, her own ways of approaching subjects unique to women's experiences.\n\nAdapted by Zetterling and then-husband David Hughes from a cycle of novels by Agnes von Krusenstjerna and…\n\n\"Does one have to be happy?\"\n\nIn between its singular reflections on labor agonies and opulent, dissipated midsommar festivity, Zetterling's probing take on femininity, selfhood, love, sexuality, and existence deftly bespeaks the societal oppression, two-facedness existing amidst the fragility and impermanence of mankind. Having both- the cynical mirroring of the repressive, illiberal structure of society and an account of war-time desolation, thick with the trials and tribulations of birthing, whether it's physical or psychological, and introspective deliberation, this one seeks the sense of individual existence in the overwhelming ambience of anxiety, dejection, and loneliness.\n\nAlthough conveying a discernible Influence of Bergman in its entirety, the merits of \"Loving Couples\" lie in the stirring, subversive commentary on sexuality, female identity, mothership,…\n\nComparisons to Bergman are inevitable as there are many similarities – the themes (resembling those in Brink of Life and Smiles of a Summer Night), cast (Harriet Andersson, Gunnar Björnstrand, and Eva Dahlbeck), and even cinematographer (the immortal Sven Nykvist). However, Mai Zetterling makes this film her own, showing a distinctly female point of view in this story of three women about to give birth at a hospital. We see misogyny in the various patriarchal figures, one of whom is a pedophile, but we see that even in a male-dominated world, women are empowered in their sexuality. This includes lesbian attraction, romps in the woods, becoming pregnant out of wedlock, and marrying a gay man to conceal the true father.…\n\nActress (largely in Sweden and the UK) turned director Mai Zetterling's impressive feature film debut after her Venice Golden Lion winning and BAFTA nominated short The War Game. With Loving Couples Zetterling, who previously starred in the Ingmar Bergman directed Music in Darkness and scripted Torment, produces a highly derivative work on the surface, aping the structure and themes of early Bergman and employing the talents of key Bergman collaborators Sven Nykvist, Harriet Andersson, Gunnel Lindblom, Eva Dahlbeck, and Gunnar Björnstrand, but there's an original voice to be heard here if approached with an open mind. It's an ensemble piece set in early twentieth century Sweden focusing on the back stories of three young pregnant women (Andersson, Lindblom and Gio…\n\nBlu-Ray. Swedish drama. First film directed by actress Mai Zetterling. Three pregnant women recall events from their lives while in hospital.\n\nThey're all there, those actors we used to see in Ingmar Bergman films: Harriet Andersson, Gunnel Lindblom, Anita Björk, Gunnar Björnstrand, Eva Dahlbeck and the others.\n\nThis adaptation of a novel by Agnes von Krusenstjerna deals with the place of women in Swedish society at the beginning of the 20th century, sharing the daily lives of couples from the artistic, bourgeois, aristocratic and proletarian worlds. The deep love between a man and a woman is portrayed as an ideal that cannot last forever. Some scenes hint at the possibility of Sapphic love, which could be more solid.\n\nThe scenes…"
