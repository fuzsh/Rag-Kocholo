        "text": "01 jul 2021\n\nPioneering Women in Film - Swedish director and actress Mai Zetterling (1925-1994) is the focus of a film programme at ACMI Cinemas in Melbourne in July.\n\n1 - 20 July 2021\n\nGemini Rising: The Cinema of Mai Zetterling\n\nACMI Cinemas, Federation Square, Melbourne\n\nACMI, Australia’s national museum of screen culture, has reopened after more than 18 months of building-wide redevelopment, being transformed architecturally, programmatically, and technologically.\n\nAs part of the film programme in July 2021 ACMI aim to celebrate one of the most unappreciated talents to emerge from a thriving, mid-century Swedish film industry, and her empowering transition from acting to directing.\n\nMai Zetterling directed very progressive films for her time and often depicted taboos that are still relevant today, such as female objectification, reproductive rights, and sexual misconduct.\n\nAfter a working-class upbringing, including growing up for a few years in Australia, Mai Zetterling carved out an unexpected acting career as a movie star and as a stage performer. By transitioning from acting to directing, Mai Zetterling reclaimed a power. Of being an actress, she said, \"showing my legs and my cleavage, I had been no threat at all: men could fantasise about me\". When she became a director, that changed. Mai Zetterling is a feminist champion. Her feminist films in the 1960s were ahead of sweeping change as the second wave of feminism gathered momentum.\n\nThe programme shines a spotlight on a strong female voice from the 1960s and asks at a relevant time in contemporary society why Mai Zetterling is not more widely recognised. When many people think of Swedish cinema, Ingmar Bergman will come to mind, but at the height of his career, another\n\ndirector was directing a fresh crop of films, sometimes banned, frequently ignored, often undervalued, that heralded a new wave of feminism.\n\nFilm titles will include (subject to change):\n\nTorment (aka Hets), dir. Alf Sjoberg, Sweden\n\nFrieda, dir. Basil Dearden, UK\n\nMusic in Darkness (aka Musik i Morker), dir. Ingmar Bergman, Sweden\n\nThe War Game, dir. Mai Zetterling, UK\n\nLoving Couples (aka Älskande par), dir. Mai Zetterling, Sweden\n\nNight Games (aka Nattlek), dir. Mai Zetterling, Sweden\n\nDr Glas, dir Mai Zetterling, Sweden & Denmark\n\nThe Girls (aka Flickorna), dir. Mai Zetterling, Sweden\n\nScrubbers, dir, Mai Zetterling, UK\n\nAmorosa, dir. Mai Zetterling, Sweden\n\nThe Witches, Dir Nicolas Roeg, USA & UK\n\nFor more information about the film programme see;\n\n> Home | ACMI: Your museum of screen culture\n\n> Swedish Institute Sharing Sweden\n\nMore information about Mai Zetterling;\n\n> Swedish Film Database"
