        "text": "AT first glance Mai Zetterling doesn't look like Van Gogh. She doesn't look like a Swedish film star either (she was), or even a movie director (she is). She is squat, frumpy, likable, with a sagging, fleshy face and serious Scandinavian eyes. She exudes a cool, stoic confidence. And she seems absolutely without pretension.\n\n“I've shown a little bit of talent, that's all,” she says. “I don't know if I'm ever going to do something that's very good—I haven't so far. But God knows, I'll keep on trying. You see, I haven't done very much yet, only four films.”\n\nShe is, in fact, one of the few women movie directors in the world, and before that had a successful career as an actress. She began on the Swedish stage at the age of 17, graduated to films and made a great impression on American audiences shortly after World War II in the Swedish shocker, “Torment,” which had a screenplay by an unknown young man named Ingmar Bergman. Later she acted under Bergman when he began directing, and then worked extensively in England and became leading lady to such stars as Danny Kaye (“Knock on Wood”) and Peter Sellers (“Only Two Can Play”). Just as the fat Hollywood offers began to roll in and the press began to talk about another Garbo (they always do), she turned her back on it all to make her own films.\n\nSo far her films have been more successful critically than commercially. Now she and her second husband, English novelist David Hughes, live in a crumbling house on the unfashionable south side of the Thames. They drive a Land Rover, never go out to a restaurant, rarely entertain formally. Their idea of a holiday a camping jaunt with a once‐a‐week bath in a hotel.\n\nBut at least they are doing what they want to do; and that, she explains, is “my big luxury.” They began by collaborating on TV documentaries. Then came four Swedish feature films, including “Loving Couples” (“that was about women—people finding their own strength, finding what the hell it is all about”) and “Night Games,” which was based on her own novel and caused a furor when it was banned for public showing at the Venice Film Festival in 1966.\n\nNow they have completed a one‐hour TV film on Vincent Van Gogh which will be shown on the BBC and in the U.S. on NET. It's about an actor, played by Michael Gough (no relation), who goes to Arles to portray Van Gogh and slowly turns into the painter he is acting. It is a transfer of identity not unrelated to Mai's own life.\n\nWhy Van Gogh?\n\n“I love him,” she says simply. “It was my idea, I've wanted to make a film about him for years. I love him because he was an uncompromiser. He was an absolutely marvelous man, he loved mankind, yet the pathetic part of him was that people didn't love him. He had this tremendous tenacity, he went too far in everything he did. He was a lay evangelical pastor to a mining community in Belgium, but the church fired him because he gave all his clothes away, living in a freezing house—they told him, you can't live like Christ!\n\n“His letters to his brother move me to tears. Everything in the film is based on them, we don't show a single painting. But we show the landscape. My husband and I have a house near Arles, you see, very close to where he did his greatest paintings. I've been bewitched by that landscape—not the Mediterranean lushness but that kind of bleak, weird, rough feeling. It's very demanding; it demands things of you, it demanded things of Van Gogh. So I decided to do something about the creativity in man, and take him as our spokesman.”\n\nThe telephone rings. It's about the next day's work in the cutting room. Mai answers in a calm, decisive voice which still has a trace of Swedish accent. It's not always easy being a woman director.\n\n“You come up against all sorts of silly little prejudices,” she explains. “People think you don't know what you're doing, or that you'll go away and cry in a corner if you can't get what you want. It's so stupid. One thing I do suffer from, though —I'm not used to being openiy criticized. That's much harder for a woman, to take than a man, because women are more vain than men. A man can take it, he's used to it; but we've been brought up to please, to be sweet, to be nice.\n\n“I hate It, the way men think that because you're making a film, leading the battalion, you're being aggressive. So what, so it's a woman making a film. So she has to give certain orders. But that doesn't mean to say you have to lose your …” She searches for the word, hesitates, takes the plunge. “… sensuality. It's so childish, so old‐fashioned. I don't think I lose any femininity. It has nothing to do with it.”\n\nMai Zetterling's movies, in fact, were sexually frank long before it was fashionable. The reason? “Because I'm Swedish, I suppose.” The answer is deliberately disingenuous. Don't the movies reflect her own sensuality? “You'll have to ask my husband, won't you?” she parries. Hasn't she got any idea of her own? “Well, could say, oh yes, I'm a great sexy bitch, I think about men the whole time, but that's so disgusting—cheap, vulgar stuff.”\n\nShe believes in censorship for children, but otherwise thinks there should be no limits to sex on the screen. “The trouble is, nudity has become very very boring indeed,” she says. “I sit in the cinema and I think, oh no, we're not going to have those bare breasts again…. “ What about violence? “I don't know the answer to that. Obviously unbalanced people and young people can be very badly affected.”\n\nThe sexuality of Zetterling's films has largely centered on women; her latest feature, “The Girls,” is based on the Lysistrata theme. It's understandable, she says. “There are many things I feel haven't been aired on the screen, haven't been looked at from a woman's viewpoint. So naturally I make films about women.” She supports Women's Lib, but thinks it has been forced to become too hysterical. Her favorite directors? Pasolini and Buñuel, who manage to combine eroticism with intellectuality. Ken Russell? “I liked his TV films on the composers Elgar and Delius —his Delius was a very brilliant tearjerker. So okay, maybe Russell's too bloody much sometimes, but it's refreshing.”\n\nShe and her husband work on scripts together; she has an idea for another novel, and has made “hundreds and hundreds of notes.” As the more famous and more ostentatiously creative of the couple, does she have to safeguard her husband's ego? “David's a very grown‐up man, we have a very close relationship,” she says quietly. “A less adult human being might feel insecure. Conflicts? We don't have conflicts. Some people say ‘How dull!,’ but it isn't, it's absolutely bloody marvelous. I don't believe in wasting energy or time. You're up against time all the time.”\n\nNor does she believe in restricting her creativity to films. “Life should be creative,” she says. “I cook a great deal, I'm extremely good at it and I care a great deal for it because I think it's all connected with giving love to people and it's a marvelous thing to feed people good things. That's very creative. And I love gardening, I'm going to start an herb farm in France. I plant trees, and love digging, and being outside—I'm very involved in the environment and the whole pollution issue.”\n\nHaving children, too, is creative; she had two by her first husband, a boy and a girl. After the marriage broke up, she reared them herself for seven years while working as a film and stage actress. Although she is now well into her forties, she says she may even have more children. “Yes, it's not too late. Why not?” She is, obviously, a very determined woman.\n\nWhy isn't she making feature movies still? “I haven't been able to do any.” Why not? “Why not? I don't know.” Her expression is wry, self‐deprecating. “It's a very difficult thing. Yes, I'll tell you why. One reason is that I want very strongly to do things I believe in. I can't do jobs for the money, I just can't do it. I can only do things in my own way and on my own terms.”\n\nHer last two projected feature films fell through for that reason. One was on the world of advertising. Another was on methylated spirits drinkers in London's East End, called “Bury Me in My Boots.” She had the “final cut” right written into the contract, and agreement to a small crew (“I don't think I could work with a large American unit with hundreds of people—I'd be swamped, I'd be so frightened“), but there was pressure to make it a glossy movie with a big star. “I didn't make the picture,” she says. “I stand very firm on those principles.”\n\nWhat about the financial sacrifice involved? “I don't really believe in having possessions, I've given almost everything away,” she replies. “I had a lot of silver. There was my bloody dressing room table filled with silver, which somebody came to polish every week. One day I suddenly looked at it with disgust; I said, what am I doing with this? I'm not sentimental—to hell with it! Silly silly things, but it's part of a change.”\n\nShe pauses, fiddles with some of her collection of rocks on her study table.\n\n“rve cnanged more in the last three years than I've ever done before. I was cluttering up my life, I didn't have one particular goal. I wanted to be much stronger, much clearer. Sometimes you want to clear your brain out; crystallize things, clean the cobwebs away, and say to yourself, what the hell do you want to do? So now I am taking time to find out.”\n\nWill it mean another radical switch of direction in her life, as when she turned her back on film stardom to become a movie director?\n\n“I don't know, I don't know what's going to happen. That's a mystery. The change is still within me. But whatever is, I won't compromise.” Mai Zetterling looks up, smiles with her mouth, but her eyes are unflinchingly serious. “It will be something I believe in.”\n\nTenacity, stripping away of possessions, lack of reward, no compromise. It sounds familiar. Van Gogh?"
