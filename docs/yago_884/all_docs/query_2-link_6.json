Even more so, because he finds out about it from Stephanie, Greg's deserted TV weather girl girlfriend.",

        "text": "1980 In Review - October\n\nA Beverly Hills doctor (James Coburn) sleeps with a TV weatherwoman (Susan Sarandon) whose boyfriend sleeps with the doctor's wife (Shirley MacLaine).\n\nDecent cast in this really bad, sometimes embarrassing ‚Äòcomedy‚Äô that is neither funny or interesting. A total waste of some really great actors. Another early 80‚Äôs ‚Äòcomedies‚Äô obsessed with marriage and infidelity.\n\nThere are many films that have gone into obscurity over the years, this is one of those films that deserves to stay there.\n\nJames Coburn watches Susan Sarandon on the beach (build a sandcastle) then they go into the hotel pool and Coburn unzips his blue short shorts to reveal a blue speedo!?\n\nThe James Coburn-Susan Sarandon half of the couple swap is much more enjoyable than the Shirley MacLaine-Stephen Collins half. The Stephen Collins of it all definitely factors in. It's before his time, but, in my head, I cast David Hyde Pierce in Collins' place.\n\n‚ÄúIt was a change of pace. It was a comedy. I thought it was pretty good. But, there was another film out around the same time with Shirley MacLaine called A CHANGE OF SEASONS. You know, that film was a lot like LOVING COUPLES. It was almost the same fuckin‚Äô story. Shirley played the same kind of character. I don't know why.‚Äù - James Coburn\n\nSusan Sarandon #4\n\nwhy did i think greg and walter were gonna kiss in that last scene together? and why didn't evelyn and stephanie get scenes together? susan sarandon and shirley maclaine were in a movie together and they don't get to girlboss together (and maybe even kiss a little)???\n\nGreg: we both have been dumped; why are we doing this for? why we don't go get a drink?\n\nWalter: ... why not?\n\nAnd then they get drunk, kissed each other, and lived happily ever after...... I would have written if I were the scriptwriter.\n\nEVERYTHING was wrong in this movie; the only things that I really liked was the '80s aesthetic (a forever fan for the eighties), and Susan Sarandon (only for her I watched the movie), so the 2 stars go only for them.\n\nGod, what a waste of timeüò≠"
