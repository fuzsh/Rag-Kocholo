What 16 personality type is Mai Zetterling?

Based on the available information, Mai Zetterling from the United Kingdom could potentially be an INFJ (Introverted-Intuitive-Feeling-Judging) personality type. INFJs are known for their introverted nature but also possess strong intuition and empathy towards others, which may be reflected in Zetterling's work as a director who often conveyed social commentary and sensitive subjects in her films. INFJs also tend to have a strong sense of justice and morality, which may have influenced Zetterling's activism and involvement in feminist movements. However, without a comprehensive understanding of Zetterling's personality and tendencies, it is impossible to accurately determine her MBTI type. It is important to keep in mind that while MBTI types can be helpful in understanding personality traits, they are not definitive or absolute and should not be used to stereotype or define individuals.

Based on Mai Zetterling's notable traits, it is possible that she could be classified as an Enneagram Type 8 (The Challenger).
