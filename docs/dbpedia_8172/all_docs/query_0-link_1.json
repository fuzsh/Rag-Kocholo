        "text": "Tripolitan Recognition of the United States, .\n\nU.S. Minister to Great Britain John Adams entered into treaty negotiations with Abdurrahman, the Tripolitan diplomat stationed in London in February of 1786, but the negotiations were inconclusive. Abdurrahman stated that without a treaty, the Tripolitan government would regard the United States and Tripoli to be at war with one another. The Tripolitan government formally recognized U.S. independence by the signing of a peace treaty in Tripoli on November 4, 1796. The treaty was subsequently also signed by the Dey of Algiers, who claimed authority over Tripolitan affairs, although this authority was denied by Pasha Yusuf Qaramanli. The subsequent treaty between the United States and Tripoli, signed on June 10, 1805, was concluded without Algerian supervision.\n\nTripoli/Libya under Ottoman and Italian Control, .\n\nTripolitan authority to conduct international relations ended when the Ottoman Empire chose to reassert its formerly nominal suzerainty over its Libyan provinces in 1835. The Ottoman Empire formally ceded Libya to Italy under the Treaty of Ouchy on October 18, 1912. Libya formally remained an Italian colony until 1947, when Italy relinquished its claims upon Libya, which had been under joint Franco-British occupation since 1943.\n\nConsulate at Tripoli and Italian Libya, (with interruptions).\n\nJames Leander Cathcart arrived in Tripoli to assume his duties as U.S. Consul on April 5, 1799. Yusuf Qaramanli, Pasha of Tripoli, formally accepted Cathcart’s credentials between that date and April 15, when he stated his acceptance of Cathcart in a letter to U.S. President John Adams. The Consulate closed on May 14, 1801 owing to the beginning of the Tripolitan War. Tobias Lear, who conducted the 1805 peace negotiations, appointed John Ridgely “U.S. agent” for Tripoli, but it is unclear if this was a consular position, or if it meant Ridgely was a signatory to the treaty. The Consulate had re-opened by 1807, when George Davis was U.S. consul at Tripoli. Although Tripoli ceased to be an independent state after 1835, the consulate remained open until July 22, 1882, when it was closed by order of Congress. The office re-opened on June 10, 1908, closed again on August 15, 1916, reopened April 24, 1935, closed again March 15, 1937, then reestablished June 6, 1948. The office was raised to the rank of Consulate General July 1, 1949.\n\nUnited States Interests Section and Liaison Office Established, .\n\nThe United States established an Interests Section at the Belgian Embassy in Tripoli, February 8, 2004. It became the U.S. Liaison Office on June 28, with Gregory L. Berry as the Principal Officer. Libyan diplomats reestablished a presence in Washington on July 8, 2004, when they opened the Libyan Interests Section as part of the United Arab Emirates Embassy, Libya’s protecting power.\n\nResumption of U.S. Embassy Tripoli Operations, .\n\nThe United States appointed a Special Representative to the Transitional National Council in Benghazi in March 2011 and maintained a diplomatic presence there from April 2011 to September 2012. The U.S. Government officially recognized the Transitional National Council (TNC) as the legitimate government of Libya on July 15, 2011. On September 22, 2011, the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli resumed operations.\n\nSuspension of U.S. Embassy Tripoli Operations, .\n\nThe Department suspended U.S. Embassy operations in Tripoli on July 26, 2014 because of ongoing violence between Libyan militias in the immediate vicinity. The embassy temporarily relocated to Tunisia in March 2015 where it operates as the \"Libya External Office in Tunis under the authority of the U.S. Ambassador to Libya, facilitating engagement with Libyans and U.S. foreign assistance."
