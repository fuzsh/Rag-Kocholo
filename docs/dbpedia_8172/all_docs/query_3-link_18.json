        "text": "In 1940, Italy's fascist dictator Benito Mussolini wanted to expand his African Empire. His forces in Ethiopia attacked neighbouring British possessions, but in 1941 were expelled and defeated.\n\nIncursions from Libya into Egypt also met defeat. The British forced the Italians into headlong retreat.\n\nIn February 1941, Hitler sent the Afrika Korps, commanded by General Rommel, to bolster his ally. The German counter-offensive pushed the British back to the Egyptian frontier.\n\nPhotographs\n\nField Marshal Erwin Rommel\n\nField Marshal Erwin Rommel, Commander of the German forces in North Africa, with his aides during the desert campaign.\n\nThe see-saw struggle in the Western Desert continued for the next 18 months. British forces, under a succession of commanders, were continually out-fought by Rommel. The vital port of Tobruk was besieged twice.\n\nThe turning point came at El Alamein in October 1942, when General Montgomery inflicted a decisive defeat on the Axis forces.\n\nPhotographs\n\nSherman tanks during the Battle of El Alamein\n\nSherman tanks of the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers, 1st Armoured Division, during the Battle of El Alamein, 5 November 1942.\n\nThe Desert War\n\n© IWM E 14671\n\nSecond World War\n\nA Brief History Of The Eighth Army And The Desert War\n\nThe Eighth Army, formed in September 1941, was a diverse formation made up of units from all corners of the British Empire, with infantry divisions coming from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India.\n\n© IWM (E 16132)\n\nSecond World War\n\nHow The British Secured A Victory In The Desert During The Second World War\n\nWhen Italy declared war on 10 June 1940, the Italian Army in Libya threatened the vital Suez Canal in British-occupied Egypt. Italian forces attacked Egypt on 13 September. General O’Connor’s Western Desert Force was outnumbered, but his commander-in-chief, General Wavell, ordered a surprise attack at Sidi Barrani three days later.\n\nSecond World War\n\nHow Italy Was Defeated In East Africa In 1941\n\nIn October 1935 Italian troops invaded Ethiopia, forcing the country's Emperor, Haile Selassie, into exile. Ignoring protests from the League of Nations, the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini proclaimed a new Italian empire in East Africa, comprising Ethiopia and the pre-existing territories of Italian Somaliland and Eritrea.\n\nSecond World War\n\nThe Special Forces That Helped Win The Desert Battles Of The Second World War\n\nWhen Italy declared war on 10 June 1940, the frontier in the Libyan desert posed a challenge to both sides. The difficult terrain included vast sand seas of giant dunes which made it impossible for large forces to penetrate inland.\n\n© IWM HU 63611\n\nSecond World War\n\nHow The Royal Navy Helped Win A War In The Desert\n\nFollowing Italy's entry into the Second World War on 10 June 1940, and France's surrender on 22 June, British Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham's Mediterranean Fleet at Alexandria in Egypt was outnumbered and surrounded by a largely hostile shore.\n\nSecond World War\n\nHow Erwin Rommel became The Desert Fox\n\nIn this episode of IWM Stories, John Delaney explores Rommel's first campaign in the desert. How did he pull off such a stunning reversal? How did the British stop him at Tobruk? And is Rommel’s reputation deserved?\n\n© IWM E 1416\n\nSecond World War\n\nThe Tanks And Guns Of The Second World War's Desert War\n\nThe open nature of warfare in North Africa accentuated the importance of armoured fighting vehicles and artillery. British tank design was governed by tactical principles which assigned slow but well-protected 'I' tanks to support the infantry, while speedy but lightly armoured Cruiser tanks fought the enemy armour.\n\n© IWM (E 10147)\n\nSecond World War\n\nHow Camouflage Helped The Allies Win The Desert War\n\nVisual deception played a crucial part in Allied operations during the Second World War in North Africa and the Middle East, where the desert terrain offered little opportunity for concealment. In 1941 the filmmaker Geoffrey Barkas was made Director of Camouflage at General Headquarters (GHQ) Cairo.\n\nDesert battles\n\n© IWM CM 3327\n\nSecond World War\n\nA 5-Minute History Of The Battle Of El Alamein\n\nAt 9.40pm on Friday 23 October 1942, the Battle of El Alamein began with a four-hour ground and air bombardment launched by Britain and its allies. As it subsided, the troops began their advance.\n\n© IWM (E 18542)\n\nSecond World War\n\nHow the Second Battle of El Alamein was won\n\nThe Second Battle of El Alamein is one of the most famous of the Second World War, an old-school infantry slog through deadly minefields more akin to the First World War than the Second. A battle which would prove the tide of the war had truly turned in the Allies' favour. In this episode, Bryn Hammond examines how the Allies won the Second Battle of El Alamein.\n\nSecond World War\n\nWhat You Need To Know About The Siege Of Tobruk\n\nTobruk was the only deep water port in Eastern Libya and as a consequence it had been heavily fortified by its former Italian garrison. The capture of Tobruk was essential for an advance on Alexandria and Suez.\n\n© IWM (CNA 804)\n\nSecond World War\n\nA Quick Guide To The Air War Over North Africa In The Second World War\n\nWhen fighting commenced in North Africa in June 1940, the Royal Air Force's (RAF) Air Headquarters Egypt immediately mounted bombing missions against Italian targets in Libya and helped repel the Italian offensive into Egypt.\n\nRelated content\n\n© IWM (A 4154)\n\nSecond World War\n\nWhat Was The Battle Of Crete?\n\nAfter their successful conquest of Greece in April 1941, the Germans turned their attention to the island of Crete. Its capture would give them a useful base in the eastern Mediterranean and deny its use to the British.\n\n© IWM (TR 3292)\n\nConflict since 1945\n\nThe End Of The British Empire After The Second World War\n\nAfter the Second World War, the disintegration of Britain's empire transformed global politics. Before the war, Britain maintained colonies all over the world, which provided valuable raw materials, manpower and strategic bases. By 1945, however, colonies were an expensive liability for Clement Attlee's newly elected Labour government.\n\n© IWM\n\nPermanent Gallery\n\nSecond World War Galleries\n\nIWM London\n\nPermanent\n\nShare this"
