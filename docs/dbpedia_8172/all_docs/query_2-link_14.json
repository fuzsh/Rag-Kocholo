Half of each man's daily ration of 4.5 litres went towards cooking and topping up vehicle radiators. The rest was for drinking, washing and shaving.\n\nVisibility in the desert was hampered by heat haze, dust and sandstorms. Although troops were kept fit by their officers, adequate drinking water and medical supplies were not always available."
